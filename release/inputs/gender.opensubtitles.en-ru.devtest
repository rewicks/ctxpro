Hi.<eos> I want to report someone stalking me and my child.<eos> Can you tell us what happened?<eos> Somebody sent me...<eos> ca children's book.<eos> And...?<eos> And it contained violent and graphic images of my child and me being murdered.<eos> Can we have a look at the book, please?<eos> I burnt if.<eos> You burnt it.
Come on.<eos> Caesar.<eos> We're coming your way, where are you?<eos> In this filthy river, behind you.<eos> Try to stay as close as you can.<eos> Make room for Caeser.<eos> Move your ass in.<eos> Who's that?<eos> A huge black guy on a boat.<eos> Hold it, hold it, you got it going.
He's gonna keep following us, man.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> He's moving.<eos> What's going on with you, brother?<eos> I said what's going on, brother?<eos> I want my car back.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> You ain't gettin' it back.
It's got three people in it.<eos> It hasn't stopped here.<eos> They needed petrol.<eos> I haven't got any petrol.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> I haven't seen a car with three people in it.<eos> Do you want to buy something?<eos> I've got tins of stuff and some auto accessories and other things.<eos> I'm looking for a car with three people in it.<eos> Have you seen it?
- It's Cleo-<eos> - She is one of us.<eos> - Oh, we love her.<eos> - Is she parked illegally?<eos> Is she sitting on a yellow line?<eos> I<eos> - No.<eos> That's right, little man.<eos> There's only one line that separates your pathetic little world from ours...<eos> - and you just crossed it.
- Yeah.<eos> So what's his deal?<eos> Why does he want to have a clean slate now?<eos> What's his game?<eos> Turn around.<eos> You should turn around just now.<eos> Chechnya.<eos> This ugly, dirty, little godforsaken country.<eos> Oil, however, lots of it.<eos> Filthy Chechen terrorists didn't want to give it to us.
Just now. I'm sorry.I clicked record before I had a chance to position the camera.<eos> Oh, that's OK.<eos> - And I mixed two questions into one.<eos> - Ah! That's OK.<eos> By the way, where are you right now?<eos> I'm here,at the hotel.<eos> But the convention is happening right now.<eos> I know.I'm watching it.<eos> Aren't you at your hotel?<eos> I'm watching it on my laptop.
A blog contest which all of a sudden... Poof! Just disappears.<eos> How long have you been doing this to me?<eos> It's up to you, Nick.<eos> Where to?<eos> I gave you an arrow.<eos> Follow the arrow.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Drive!<eos> Turn off that awful music, will you?<eos> You're the one who left it on.
Apparently you're 14.<eos> She's old and still has it.<eos> Who knows where you'll end up.<eos> You're not that nice, you know?<eos> How the fuck can you be 14?<eos> Are these the baptism records?<eos> No. Um...<eos> Your father's uncle, he told us that this is where your father was baptized, and this church was built in 1887, so I'm looking for a church built in 1887.<eos> Here.<eos> I found it.
Are you messing with me?<eos> No. It's really cool.<eos> I'm a journalist.<eos> I've done some...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't write anything, really.<eos> I thought I would, but I mostly just read.<eos> I read the news. I don't know.<eos> Anyway, so what does a post-modern romantic writer do all day?<eos> Find beauty and praise it. Wow.
No matter how many times I see it, just...<eos> Wow!<eos> Indeed.<eos> Okay, but if there's blue dust, why can't there be other colors?<eos> Because there aren't.<eos> And maybe those other colors do other things.<eos> What if there was, I don't know, purple?<eos> What if there's pink?<eos> The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.<eos> Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it?
What if there's pink?<eos> The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.<eos> Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it?<eos> Listen carefully, Zarina.<eos> We do not tamper with pixie dust.<eos> It is far too powerful.<eos> But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of.<eos> That is not our job.<eos> We're Dust Keepers.<eos> We nurture the dust, maintain it, measure it, package it, and distribute it.
What do you think you're doing?<eos> No, no, no... it's not...<eos> Look at this!<eos> - It's The Kuntu Zangpo.<eos> - Fresh from our apartment.<eos> Wait your apartment?<eos> I thought you said it was yours?<eos> It is.<eos> Richard, put that down right now or I am calling the police.<eos> Oh, you want me to put it down?
Why is this man pointing a gun at us?<eos> I thought we were handling this.<eos> Yes, you were.<eos> Then I realized that you two have an issue with trust.<eos> Give me the Zangpo.<eos> Uh-uh, hold up, sweetheart.<eos> You want that thing, you got to come through me.<eos> Who the hell is he?<eos> He's a buyer, Paige found on the Craig's list.<eos> Well, I went over all Bhutan for that figurine, and I want it now.
Here it is.<eos> That is called "take-charge shit," son!<eos> "That is called 'take-charge shit," son!<eos> "Yes, indeed.<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> "Hi, my name is Stretch,<eos> "aka Billy Big Balls With Bad Ideas."<eos> Karl would appear to me occasionally when I was exhausted or otherwise beat.<eos> - I thought you hated this job?<eos> - Doesn't mean I can afford to lose it.
Liotta's $200 tip, while generous, isn't going to save me from a pair of shattered kneecaps.<eos> I know what you thinking.<eos> It's stupid of me to be lavishing attention on my love life the same day that a very agitated member of the Mexican mafia has promised to break things I don't want broken.<eos> And there's always the chance that this "Pinkminx" isn't actually a woman, there was just something about the...<eos> Pink.<eos> Huh.<eos> Well, if that's stupid, then this is just plain old reckless.<eos> The one addiction I haven't been able to shake.<eos> Her.<eos> Let's not call it stalking.
But, if I'm honest...<eos> I had a real issue with my own image.<eos> It made me anxious.<eos> But now, I'm approaching my own death, so...<eos> I need to learn to relinquish control.<eos> Newman Loslein, who was your mentor and guide, instilled in you the idea of art and nature as a means of healing.<eos> And I'm assuming part of his teachings touch on love.<eos> Could you elaborate a little bit on that?<eos> I'm not interested in elaborating.<eos> You're asking me to perform, like, pluck love out of the sky and examine it for you.
Welcome, everyone.<eos> As you all know, it has taken a long time to prepare ourselves.<eos> To build our ships, and to replace the young men that we lost to the plague.<eos> But now, now we are ready, and this summer we shall finally go West again.<eos> Yay!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We will return to England, for that land was so generous to us the last time.<eos> But this time, we shall not go alone.<eos> For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.<eos> And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for awhile, explore it, maybe even winter there.
I like your hat, by the way.<eos> Thank you!<eos> It's new.<eos> You're very dear to me, you know?<eos> To all of us.<eos> There you go.<eos> Well this is... nice.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Keel's Rosewater.<eos> I could have just come into the shop to collect it.
I don't know.<eos> She could be.<eos> She's very em...<eos> -Social girl by all accounts.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> Her family have heard nothing you say?<eos> No, she sent in a sick note and that's the last anybody's heard.<eos> -Have you seen it, the sick note? -No.<eos> Might be worth a look.<eos> See if she signed it herself.
You okay?<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't feel my hand.<eos> What do you mean, you can't feel your hand?<eos> Why can't I feel my hand? I can't feel my hand.<eos> What... what...<eos> Hold that.<eos> What about the other one?<eos> Can you feel this hand, Marshall?<eos> W... a-are you touching it?
No hospital... your brother dies.<eos> Those are not our options!<eos> We have no options!<eos> We came here from Uganda, and my brother... is gay, okay?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I know the situation there.<eos> Then you know if I go home, I'll be killed.<eos> We can't go home.<eos> Okay, I'll take out the bullet.<eos> - Let's take it out.
We need as much pressure as we can get.<eos> What did you do to my brother? !<eos> The bullet was plugging a hole in your brother's artery, Paul.<eos> I removed the bullet. The hole was exposed.<eos> I promised to save you. Now I've killed you.<eos> - My brother, my only brother!<eos> - Paul, you need to be calm right now.<eos> We're gonna try and fix him right here.<eos> Okay, that artery is torn to shreds.<eos> But you know what? I do believe that I can tie it up, though.
Can't see much.<eos> How's the liver look?<eos> - Brutal.<eos> - Is that the technical term?<eos> Sponges.<eos> Keep them coming, please.<eos> Her liver's been pulped.<eos> I don't think it's viable.<eos> Both the right and left lobes have been severely damaged.<eos> Okay, let's pack it, and then let's get her into imaging and see how badly damaged that spinal cord is.
Or solitude of any kind?<eos> Your place is great.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Is this private? - No, no secret.<eos> I just have to figure out what to do with my apartment.<eos> Alex, you know if you need any money, I'll...<eos> No, I mean, yes, I do, but I-I don't.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't you just dump it?
But then suddenly you were gone.<eos> Iran under the tree, but you weren't there anymore.<eos> I called out, and you called out in response.<eos> But from up in another tree.<eos> I ran to it but you weren't there.<eos> And then suddenly it was already summer.<eos> And I still ran and called out but only the wind blew and the leaves rustled.<eos> You weren't anywhere.<eos> I was spent and started crying.<eos> Your saw was on the ground. Iwanted to pick it up but then you suddenlyjumped out from behind a tree and laughed, pushing me down.
I was just... You know, before you come tomorrow night.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to destroy your play.<eos> But you didn't even see it.<eos> Um, you know, did I do something to offend you?<eos> Actually, you did.<eos> You occupied a theater which might have been used on something worthwhile.<eos> Okay. But you don't even know if it's any good or not.<eos> That's true.<eos> I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview... but after the opening tomorrow,
Find the fucking folder!<eos> A fucking janitor? You're a dumb fuck!<eos> A dumb fuck!<eos> -Find the folder!<eos> -Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Tanner!<eos> Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been?<eos> -We have an issue.<eos> -Okay, now is not the time.<eos> I gave Neiman the folder and Neiman lost it.
If we're having a problem fornicationally, then we should discuss it.
With those things up there and stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're blades.<eos> Well, this looks like a third-grader did it, man.<eos> This blueprint<eos> - The scale's Way off.<eos> Everything doesrft make sense.<eos> If you Want a sweet blueprint of this...<eos> I got this blueprint software on my computer.<eos> I'll give it to you for free.
You up for Easter then?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What happened? !<eos> Some men attacked me, but don't worry about it.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> Do you own that boat?<eos> Do you own that boat?<eos> I borrowed the boat, I'll get it back.
Partners.<eos> If you were anyone else I would've buried you this morning.<eos> If I were anyone else, you'd understand.<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> Forget this mess, cut a path, right aways.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go see Caleb.<eos> When you're done with that bottle, put it on the ground.
Bye bye.<eos> Sorry to wake you.<eos> You know, I sold your machine ten years ago for a reforestation project.<eos> Six owners since then.<eos> I love thinking about all they've seen.<eos> Them wheat farms of yours are never supposed to be as far west as they are.<eos> You ever heard of manifest destiny?<eos> No sir.<eos> I like history.<eos> Everyone's so damned scared to repeat it, they never thought how bad the alternatives was.
- More right, more right!<eos> Oh! - Lottie!<eos> Well done!<eos> I've been trying to hit that for years.<eos> - What did it say?<eos> - It said "Do not let children drive".<eos> ♪ Oh, Mother, can I go out to swim?<eos> ♪ Yes, my darling daughter<eos> ♪ Watch the boys don't see your bum<eos> ♪ Keep it well under the water
We're on television!<eos> The three children from this family who cannot be named for legal reasons... - Oh! ...are inside the house.<eos> - The police have announced...<eos> - We can only confirm that the body of a man in his mid-seventies was... destroyed and floated out to sea possibly with some valuables.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I forgot to put the brooch in my drawing.<eos> - Yes, it was.<eos> - Brooch?<eos> Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.
- Brooch?<eos> Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.<eos> All Vikings went to Valhalla with their treasure.<eos> You morons!<eos> Well, that's just rude.<eos> You, stupid, stupid little...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, enough!<eos> - They've destroyed a family heirloom.<eos> - Dad found it.
Toby Franzen.<eos> We've been after that piece of shit for years.<eos> Sergeant at Arms now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the very one who sponsored our mate Collard as a nominee in the bike club.<eos> Well, unless Franzen's gone soft in his old age, I don't imagine you got much out of him.<eos> Hasn't said a word.<eos> But luckily for us, Collard has.<eos> You seen that tattoo anywhere before?<eos> Oh, I seen it every day, eh.
Urca de Lima, the largest Spanish treasure galleon in the Americas.<eos> A page was torn from the log with the Urca's course and schedule.<eos> Take them into custody.<eos> The schedule is here on the island.<eos> The thief who stole it has offered to sell it to me.
When I got here, I'd made so many wrong turns, felt empty, dead inside. You guys brought me back to life.<eos> You showed me that my past is exactly that.<eos> I have a life today.<eos> Is it better? Sometimes.<eos> It's different, and then there are moments when I get little glimpses of hope.<eos> Those are good days, and the rest of the days, I'm working on those.<eos> This dinner's for your niece? Yeah.<eos> She wants me to meet her new boyfriend.<eos> I have no idea why.<eos> Maybe because she's excited to have you in her life and wants to share it with you. Could be that.
We slept anywhere.<eos> The world belonged to us.<eos> Life seemed endless.<eos> The energy of youth.<eos> It's not my thing, the stop.<eos> I need autonomy.<eos> I want to support myself.<eos> That's why I prefer the bike.<eos> And you sleep in hotels?<eos> No, I have a tent, but then I did not want to mount it.
Where's the weapon?<eos> Go on, search me, no weapon.<eos> Bainbridge was on parade, he came off duty five minutes ago.<eos> When's this supposed to have happened?<eos> You obviously stabbed him before he got into the shower.<eos> No. No? !<eos> He's soaking wet and there's shampoo in his hair.<eos> He got into the shower, then someone stabbed him.<eos> The cubicle was locked from the inside, sir.<eos> I had to break it open.
I couldn't imagine life out of this uniform.<eos> I suppose, given the circumstances, I don't have to.<eos> When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue.<eos> Whatever you're doing in there, James, stop it, right now!<eos> I will kick this door down!<eos> Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.<eos> Yes, I think we are.<eos> There's a proper time to die, isn't there?<eos> Of course there is.<eos> And one should embrace it when it comes.
The entrance to my vaults.<eos> This is where I keep you all.<eos> OK, so where are the vaults, then?<eos> Vaults?<eos> What vaults?<eos> There are no vaults beneath this building.<eos> They're all in here.<eos> The Appledore vaults are my mind palace.<eos> You know about mind palaces, don't you, Sherlock?<eos> How to store information so you never forget it, by picturing it.
Really?<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> So now it's time for the talk.<eos> - The talk?<eos> - The 401k talk.<eos> Have you decided which plan you'd like to adopt?<eos> What's a 401k?<eos> Your retirement savings plan.<eos> You're eligible to participate.<eos> Every month, you deposit part of your salary into your 401k, and the company matches it, tax-free.
Easy peasy.<eos> Hey, you're the helper guy, right?<eos> The T.A., yeah.<eos> Yeah, I don't understand my grade on this paper.<eos> That would be a "D".<eos> Yeah, no, thanks, I get that.<eos> Um, but why?<eos> I mean, I misspelled Tennyson or something?<eos> Uh, yeah, I remember this one.<eos> I graded it.
Hey, you're the helper guy, right?<eos> The T.A., yeah.<eos> Yeah, I don't understand my grade on this paper.<eos> That would be a "D".<eos> Yeah, no, thanks, I get that.<eos> Um, but why?<eos> I mean, I misspelled Tennyson or something?<eos> Uh, yeah, I remember this one.<eos> I graded it.<eos> Oh, you... you graded it, not the Professor?
He's got the package. He has the package.<eos> I got it; what do I do with it?<eos> Aardvark, there are people coming.<eos> You have to act now.<eos> Secure the package, secure the package.<eos> - What do I do with it?<eos> -They're coming right towards you.<eos> They're gonna see it, they're gonna see it.<eos> You got to hide that little missile.<eos> I have to hide it somewhere?
I've never seen Valyrian steel before.<eos> She's a beauty.<eos> The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.<eos> And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.<eos> I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.<eos> Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.<eos> Best time to attack a man.<eos> Mind yourself.<eos> - If I still had my right hand...<eos> - Plan on growing it back?
No?<eos> How tolerant of you.<eos> I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.<eos> Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.<eos> I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.<eos> It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.<eos> Please give him our regards.<eos> With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.<eos> They call it the rich man's disease.<eos> A wonder you don't have it.
Mr. Hamund?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> My name is John Silver.<eos> And I have a proposition for you.<eos> I've heard your crew has been freed to hunt again.<eos> And I understand with Mr. Rackham out of favor, you're the man the crew now looks to.<eos> Seems our paths were meant to meet in this moment.<eos> Me with something to sell, and you with means to use it.<eos> Piss off.<eos> I was the whore's partner, the one who stole the page from Flint and then tried to sell it to you.
Oh, drugs, not bugs.<eos> And this not the gardening show?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Let's take another caller.<eos> So, we've successfully moved on from that relationship, have we?<eos> This is the Commissioner's house?<eos> Is someone gonna get that phone?<eos> Can you two stop fighting?<eos> Turn it off, please.
Arty stuff.<eos> He said he wanted a few keepsakes, so... I gave him my old camera.<eos> Ros lent us her penthouse, her love nest as she calls it, not that I think it's ever seen much love.<eos> When he stopped returning my calls, I got scared.<eos> I knew he'd want money and gifts.<eos> Price you're paying for dirty little secrets.<eos> When I'd heard he'd died, it felt like a reprieve.<eos> All I could think of was getting hold of that red book before it fell into the wrong hands.<eos> I couldn't bear it if Pat and Ellie found out.<eos> Well, let's just wait till we get the phone call, eh? From whoever's got it, to see what they want.
Spirit?<eos> Signal us once for "Yes."<eos> Twice for "No."<eos> Harry, are you okay?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Spirit, if you can hear me, give me a sign.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I mean, damn it, Stanley, we've both done levitations.<eos> I once raised a real tiger, but we both have our tricks.<eos> There was nothing supporting this candle, no threads, no wires, it was floating until I brought it down.
To fuck you.<eos> And as a friend.<eos> Jesus Christ, friends don't pressure friends to fucking sleep with them.<eos> Actually, that's not true, Nina.<eos> Because as I'm sure you know, a friend is a gift you give yourself.<eos> Okay, a left on Roth, and then six blocks to the ramp.<eos> You're putting me on the 5?<eos> Yeah, the 2 to the 5 to the 110 to the 10.<eos> Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?<eos> Did I read it?
We wanna share her with the world at just the right moment.<eos> The people who tried to kidnap her are very powerful people.<eos> They want all of her talents for themselves.<eos> They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world.<eos> Yeah, even if all of it's true, why me?<eos> State-of-the-art GPS tracking device.<eos> We'll know where you are, plus or minus 2 feet.<eos> That's just to make sure you maintain your end of the bargain.<eos> And if you want it off, you'll have to chop off your leg.<eos> Well, maybe I'll chew it off.
- No.<eos> We can't just open the doors.<eos> Hey, just back it up, guys.<eos> Stop.<eos> The air could be toxic.<eos> If the air is toxic, we're all dead, anyway.<eos> Bellamy?<eos> My God, look how big you are.<eos> What the hell are you wearing, a guard's uniform?<eos> I borrowed it to get on the drop ship.
You want that on your hands, Chloe?<eos> Yates got greedy.<eos> Began selling data to the highest bidder like it was some sort of auction house or something.<eos> Also I caught him hacking into military weapon systems.<eos> Why?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> I knew it was time for him to go.<eos> I don't do that sort of thing.<eos> Take direct action like that.<eos> We don't. We just acquire information and disseminate it.
Do we?<eos> Get started, Chloe.<eos> I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.<eos> Pete, make sure the others have access to the closed- circuit surveillance system from the London transport.<eos> Uh, okay, which ones?<eos> All of them.<eos> We'll be doing lots of backtracing.<eos> We may need to piggyback servers.<eos> Chell, pull up your facial recognition program.<eos> We'll use it for the cctv.
Don't you walk away from me.<eos> Irisa!<eos> Look.<eos> Losing you was hard.<eos> I've been a bit on edge.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - All right, good.<eos> So if we're finished with this mushy stuff, we need to come up with a plan before Varus and his crew regroup and come after us.<eos> Now, I got this sweet little boat.<eos> I say we get down to Lima, we swap it out for a bigger one, and then straight to Antarctica.
You know, if the safe is the same make, this place would be child's play.<eos> But if you get jammed up front...<eos> There is an alley running behind the whole block.<eos> I'm sure they have a door to it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> What?<eos> That car.<eos> - A tail?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - But you've tagged it before?
Way to alienate your most loyal friend.<eos> What was I supposed to do... not tell him the truth?<eos> Well, what makes you so sure it's the truth?<eos> Maybe you came up with this unusual diagnosis just to satisfy your own preconceived notions.<eos> Now you sound like him.<eos> Well, you must admit... your theory's pretty out there.<eos> It makes perfect sense!<eos> Then why are you still struggling?<eos> Because it's... just a theory.<eos> I can't prove it.
Can't say it that loud. -Okay.<eos> I think you're gonna dig it.<eos> Let's raise minimum wage.<eos> Blind people are people too.<eos> A very enjoyable read...<eos> It's complex...<eos> I'm exhausted!<eos> The journey is endless, you know?<eos> Global issue...<eos> I call it Some New Beginnings because it's plural.
Maybe we should be talking to Jason.<eos> No.<eos> W... we all agreed that it was too dangerous to tell anybody.<eos> Whoever tried to kill Ali's still around.<eos> Okay, but suppose Jason already knows she's still alive.<eos> At least then we wouldn't be the only ones in charge of a secret.<eos> Okay, I've been thinking, and I have a theory.<eos> You have what?<eos> A theory.<eos> Do you want to hear it or not?
See, here's the death certificate I signed last week.<eos> "Cause of death: Gunshots to the chesty area."<eos> I remember this guy.<eos> He was killed trying to rob a shooting range, which just proves that Darwin was right.<eos> And there's my signature.<eos> I think that's a forge.<eos> Uh, why would I forge my own signature, Shawn?<eos> No, no, Woody, not that one.<eos> This one here.<eos> I think someone took your signature and then drew over it.
He needs to see a specialist.<eos> Keeps happening over and over again.<eos> - Ridiculous. - No doctors.<eos> No doctors.<eos> All right, no doctors.<eos> A little water.<eos> Stephen.<eos> I need help.<eos> If only for Robert. He's missing out on his childhood.<eos> I keep looking for a way to make this work, but... I can't find it on my own.
No.<eos> But his buddy owns<eos> - 21 service hangars.<eos> - 21!<eos> Twenty-one of them, and he's gonna check his inventory, and he's gonna put the word out for you, Duster.<eos> - It's a good start, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> It's a great start!<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Because if that gearbox is out there, we're gonna find it for you, buddy.
It's how I contacted you in the first place.<eos> I just needed to know if you were serious.<eos> That's Cashew.<eos> Why did you contact me?<eos> Because you're desperate.<eos> And I'm not fond of authority.<eos> Just today, under the leadership of Vice President Underwood, the Senate passed HR 934, along with an historic entitlement reform amendment.<eos> By raising the retirement age to 68 and 64 for normal and early retirement respectively, we will ensure entitlements for generations to come.<eos> And when the House passes that bill in a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do, we will put the government freeze to rest.<eos> We will continue the business of serving our country rather than paralyzing it.
Thanks, CJ.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> What is it? !<eos> What is it? !<eos> We got nothing.<eos> Security camera on this level's been out for a week.<eos> Well, that's awfully convenient.<eos> Well, the question is did our guy get lucky, or did he know that the camera was out?<eos> Well, if he works here, maybe he disabled it.
Think of it this way... you'll have more time to devote to your writing.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> In fact, uh, it's funny you said that.<eos> I was just writing something now.<eos> A new book?<eos> No, a letter, actually, to you.<eos> It says, "I have been part of Chicago-Lake Michigan University "for more than half of my life.<eos> "I've been true to my school, chancellor.<eos> "But if my school doesn't want me anymore, then I will find one that does."<eos> You can take your research position, and shove it up your pompous ass.
Oh, I envy you that.<eos> How is it you've never been photographed?<eos> It's funny, actually.<eos> I have a bit of a resistance to it.<eos> Then why did you agree?<eos> You seem a man born to overcome resistance.<eos> There are native tribes who believe you give away something of your soul when you're photographed.<eos> Perhaps you do.<eos> And what will you do with this bit of my soul?<eos> Protect it.
You cannot live only in your work.<eos> My work is preoccupying.<eos> I was much the same.<eos> Never looking up from the cadaver.<eos> I imagined that I was content.<eos> And then one day, I'm having lunch. Bent over my anatomy books, I looked up and there she was.<eos> Pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.<eos> So look up, my friend.<eos> Our work cannot control us.<eos> We must control it.
I have to see her.<eos> To do what?<eos> Make this right.<eos> I always thought my traveling would kill my family.<eos> Being away so long.<eos> My thoughtlessness...<eos> I never imagined it would be a cruel little girl.<eos> When the illness came, it was absolute.<eos> I was aware of almost nothing.<eos> The doctors were at a loss to explain it.
You will make me an immortal mate.<eos> My bride must be beautiful.<eos> You're brooding, Mr. Chandler.<eos> It's Miss Croft.<eos> She's not well.<eos> Best you didn't kiss me anymore.<eos> Keep a safe distance.<eos> Hold her arms still!<eos> Miss Ives is manifesting a deep psychosexual responsiveness.<eos> Something or someone has triggered it.
Do you value cleanliness?<eos> I suppose I do.<eos> That's why you're a virgin.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> Who can tell about such things?<eos> Such hidden things.<eos> Such secrets we all have, don't we, Doctor?<eos> There's a line from Shelley that haunts me.<eos> A single line, from Adonais.<eos> I can't seem to get it out of my head.
You're keen to get back in the swing, and that's to be commended...<eos> But?<eos> Tying in a suicide to a missing girl off the back of a single word?<eos> Got to admit that's a bit of a stretch - even by your standards.<eos> "Suspected" suicide, isn't it?<eos> In any event, we'd be better placed to know if certain of his possessions hadn't taken a walk.<eos> What's that?<eos> Meeker's notebook's gone missing.<eos> Somewhere between the scene and the Exhibits desk.<eos> Could be the Coroner's men swept it up with the rest of the detritus when they bagged the body.
Do you see him much?<eos> No.<eos> But I still miss him.<eos> There's not a day I don't think of him.<eos> He wanted to see the world.<eos> Wanderlust, they call it.<eos> After Father passed, it was only him and me.<eos> It was lonely at first.<eos> But you get used to it... the silence.<eos> Finally, you come to love it.
Why last night, what was the trigger?<eos> Has a few drinks at the party for Dutch courage.<eos> Comes on to Anna in the lab.<eos> Get's rebuffed.<eos> Humiliated and angry...<eos> The fact that he tried to destroy the memory card gives us enough to arrest and question him at least.<eos> That's me heading out, Billy.<eos> In this weather?<eos> I've got a lead on Finlay Caulfield.<eos> I'm going to check it out.
Jack of all trades, as long as it pays.<eos> Saving up for another wedding to cancel?<eos> Isbister's in the dry dock.<eos> Thanks, Drew.<eos> Give my best to Tosh.<eos> Inspector Perez.<eos> I told your man I'd call back.<eos> He's my sergeant!<eos> He's not my butler.<eos> And the next time you've got information relating to a crime, you give it to whoever's on the desk, do you understand?
Did you tell anybody about it, I mean, did he...?<eos> - Was he charged?<eos> - No.<eos> Because at the time I felt that I was somehow at fault. I knew I wasn't.<eos> But I just didn't want to be stared at.<eos> I didn't want to be known as the girl who got raped.<eos> And when I became pregnant, I wasn't gonna drop out of school.<eos> I wasn't going to let this man ruin my life.<eos> So I made a choice.<eos> I ended it.
We shared a cigarette and he walked back.<eos> - No one shot him?<eos> - I should have.<eos> It's only when he got back I realised he had stolen my cigarettes.<eos> And my lighter.<eos> Mr. Connor.<eos> I'm sorry if I disturbed you.<eos> If I could pick up my bag.<eos> Of course.<eos> Orhan put it in your room.
- l don´t know if I love him!<eos> I don´t know if he´s the one for me...<eos> He´s an asshole!<eos> Well, then...<eos> To hell with him.<eos> And don´t worry about the guests, you´re not the first woman at that party to be cheated on.<eos> Plus, if you spend your time worrying about what other people think you´re screwed, kiddo.<eos> All better?<eos> Look... lf I were you, I´d go downstairs,<eos> move the party along, end it early, and then, back at home, tell him it´s over.
Why not?<eos> What people are willing to say to me, they have to do in confidence.<eos> I'm your employer.<eos> Yeah, and you employ me to find things out, which is what I do.<eos> But how I do it, the methods I use, you should leave that to me.<eos> How do you know people are telling the truth?<eos> You don't.<eos> You have to use your judgment.<eos> What do you do if you've made a mistake?<eos> Then you try and rectify it, which is what I'm trying to do here.
What happened when you were kidnapped?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What happened to Kasim's father?<eos> You know what happened.<eos> Well, tell me again.<eos> He was driving the car the day we were taken.<eos> He was killed.<eos> The toothbrush wasn't Kasim's.<eos> It was new.<eos> I saw you use it.
Yeah.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Ollie?<eos> No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry.<eos> I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> - You threw away my card.<eos> - I already read it.
Go ahead.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Ollie?<eos> No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry.<eos> I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> - You threw away my card.<eos> - I already read it.<eos> You don't wanna save it?
There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.<eos> Stannis.<eos> He's got the birthright.<eos> He's in his prime.<eos> He's a tried and tested battle commander.<eos> And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.<eos> Thelookoutseesa pirate ship sailing their way.<eos> The captain shouts to his first mate,<eos> "Bring me my red shirt."<eos> The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
Did you call me "babe"?<eos> I did.<eos> Oh, Peter.<eos> Ew! Mom!<eos> You'll never have this, Meg.<eos> All right, back in the car, kids.<eos> For this leg of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Our car!<eos> Someone's stealing it.
Yeah, hi.<eos> I'd like to report a mugging.<eos> A girl's just been shot, and she's bleeding, so please hurry.<eos> Uh, it's at the park<eos> At North Beverly and Sunset.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a good singer.<eos> I've seen you perform.<eos> You watch the show?<eos> Oh, yeah, I love it.
Don't get mad.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> Got a good thing going here.<eos> What, and end up just like Terry?<eos> You think I gave him that disease?<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Doctor told me they don't know how he got it.<eos> Maybe it's hereditary.<eos> Maybe I'm next.<eos> Maybe you got it already.
- I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?<eos> That's where I found your Seaborg medal.<eos> How hard can it be to find a 160-year-old pump handle?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On who's doing the finding.<eos> - Where did you...<eos> - Where you left it.
Do you want to introduce her to Yojo?<eos> He's kind of shy.<eos> I understand.<eos> ♪ ...so far away ♪<eos> ♪ still so far away ♪<eos> ♪ still so... ♪<eos> No, wait. Wait.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Cleaning this place up.<eos> They'll have it back to normal in a few hours.
I'm, uh, trying to fix the darn thing.<eos> It looks like the motor mount broke.<eos> You sure you know what you're doing?<eos> Seems pretty straightforward.<eos> So wanna give her a try?<eos> - There's nothing in it. - Oh.<eos> For... for a test, I'm saying.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> You killed it.
I wish I could climb into that autoclave myself.<eos> I'll tell you what might cheer you up.<eos> Tickets to My Fair Lady for Chummy's birthday.<eos> And you won't believe the deal we got.<eos> I know every word!<eos> Go on, we'll unpack your bags.<eos> Run yourself a nice hot bath with plenty of salts.<eos> Thank you, are you sure you don't mind?<eos> I... ..G...<eos> I've soaked my uniform, but I could happily burn it.
It was like a dream within a dream.<eos> A nightmare?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait a second, Lydia.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Stiles, where are you going?<eos> I'm just gonna close the door.<eos> Just go back to sleep.<eos> No, no, I should close it.
Who else has access to your office?<eos> No one.<eos> There's only one key and I keep it on me.<eos> Could someone have broken in?<eos> No, cos I was in there phoning the change machine people.<eos> Did you give the key to someone?<eos> No.<eos> Who are you protecting?<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline here.<eos> Take it.
That would imply that you had some clue as to what you were doing.<eos> That's Dr. Claire Barnes, special liaison to the senate subcommittee on health-insurance regulation and reform... you know, the people that hold the fate of your industry in their hands.<eos> See, they don't think you guys should decide for yourselves what is and what isn't experimental.<eos> They want a panel of doctors and bureaucrats to do that for you.<eos> And they are just dying for a case just like this to hammer you with.<eos> And, boy, are we gonna hammer.<eos> Little teary Tyler and his curable heart condition are gonna be sitting in front of Congress, and you're gonna be twisting in your chair, covered in so much flop sweat,<eos> Mark McGuire's gonna call to say that you come off poorly.<eos> And then when you end up with some committee telling you when and how to pay up, you're gonna be sobbing at the memory that someone once offered you a gift-wrapped win-win "get out of jail free" card<eos> but you were too stupid to accept it.
[Chuckles] I know what this is, Paul.<eos> It's a shakedown.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna kowtow before that son of a bitch.<eos> Tell Pierce, "forget it." There's no job for him here.<eos> C-chancellor, look. [Stammers]<eos> [Cellphone vibrating] I'm sure this is just a negotiating position.<eos> You make a counteroffer, I'm pretty sure Daniel would take it.<eos> There's not gonna be any counteroffer.<eos> Pierce had one chance to be reinstated,<eos> - and he blew it by being greedy.
After Kate and I got here.<eos> You knew she wouldn't leave me behind if I was in jail or in the nuthouse.<eos> You knew we'd take care of him.<eos> And then Miranda would be free to go on your little trip.<eos> You did tell me that Daniel would be okay now that his friends got here.<eos> [Cello playing] Serge: Okay, even if I were trying to convince you to leave Daniel, I could have stayed with you here in Paris.<eos> I wouldn't need you to go on tour with me, right?<eos> [Playing continues] You didn't need her.<eos> You needed her cello.<eos> You broke it so that you could have it repaired.
- Well, of course he does.<eos> He and your mother are a couple.<eos> I mean, it's not like I want my parents to get back together, but...<eos> Mnh-mnh. You don't think it's icky that my boss is... sleeping with my mother?<eos> No.<eos> But I-I can see why you do.<eos> You're never old enough to hear the details of your mother's sex life.<eos> Ma just told Tommy and Frankie she needs moral support.<eos> Got a hit on the victim's credit card.<eos> Guy was using it right down the street at a 7-eleven.
That's what Natasha had in her guitar case, and that's why the killer took the bottle.<eos> It sounds better when Natasha sings it, doesn't it?<eos> I'm ... I'm rehearsing.<eos> I've got a show.<eos> Your shy roommate didn't know how valuable her songs were, but you did, didn't you?<eos> Natasha told you she was gonna take that microphone and sing her own song in front of the record company that signed you.<eos> Broad Sound records wanted to hear their new star.<eos> Because it's my song.<eos> That's why Broad Sound records signed me.<eos> When did you write it?
Why couldn't you sleep?<eos> Are you worried about us?<eos> I know that I was in a strange place earlier.<eos> And you were right about this not working unless we tell the truth.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just really glad you stayed.<eos> Me too.<eos> Wait. He has a surveillance camera?<eos> What if the building manager put it there?
He thinks that one of us did it.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Well, now we know it's a work of fiction.<eos> Which one of us is he trying to pin it on?<eos> I didn't get that far.<eos> You didn't think to ask?<eos> Why?<eos> We know that that's not true.<eos> Just because he wrote a book doesn't mean he's not "A".<eos> You know, he could be using it as a way to place the blame on one of us and keep suspicion off of him.
If he came to help his mother, why wouldn't he be?<eos> Probably because "chiffon versus taffeta" isn't where he's most helpful.<eos> We're never getting upstairs.<eos> Why?<eos> The house is event headquarters.<eos> We're not going to be able to squeeze past Alison's mother without her noticing.<eos> I'm lucky if I can squeeze out of this tent.<eos> Ladies, when you're finished with your touch-ups, please remember to check the list by the stage.<eos> Spencer, what happened to your veil?<eos> Oh. I think I must have left it inside
But he believed me when I said that CeCe and I were roommates at UPenn.<eos> We hung out a lot at this pub near Hollis.<eos> That's where I met Ezra.<eos> Excuse me, can I have a gin and tonic?<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's tragic, isn't it?<eos> Oh, sorry?<eos> The book.<eos> It's one of my favorites.<eos> I read it every summer.

Yes, of course, let me grab his number for you.<eos> Right.<eos> His name is Dr. Thomas Larkin.<eos> At 202-251-6258<eos> And if you'd like, I can give him a call before hand and let him know you'll be reaching out.<eos> OK, you let me know if I can be of any help.<eos> Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.
- We have to get the bridge approved now.<eos> - I'll call Linda.<eos> Bypass her, I don't want her in the meeting.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Meechum, get in touch with the plane have them make ribs for the flight back.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> [door closes] Mr. Vice President, do you have a moment?<eos> I'm sorry, the president asked to see me.<eos> No he didn't, you requested the meeting and I took it off the schedule.
- We can't trust any of the results.<eos> - Are there any infected on this floor?<eos> No.<eos> No one's reported in, but we can't trust that everyone downstairs is a positive.<eos> I'm really sorry I let you down.<eos> - And Walker.<eos> - No...<eos> - I made a mistake.<eos> There's no excuse.<eos> - Right now you get to fix it.
It's called hybristophilia -- monster worship.<eos> These women like to write letters to horrible men.<eos> Those letters can turn into visits and sometimes a prison wedding.<eos> It's prison policy to scan all documents received by inmates.<eos> Any letter Luanne wrote to Luther would be kept in a database.<eos> I'm already in.<eos> Scan for places -- homes, hotels, vacation spots.<eos> Here's something.<eos> Luanne wrote about a farmhouse her grandmother owned.<eos> "She's gonna leave it to me in her will."
Whoo! I'm a little flushed.<eos> We're a good team, aren't we?<eos> Sally...<eos> Hey...<eos> You've been reading that book for 2 days.<eos> Don't you think it's time to come up for air?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Can't.<eos> - Get rid of it.<eos> Take it back and bury it in the soup rubble where you found it, because it's bad juju.
Bartholomew!<eos> Good to see you, old sport.<eos> Where's Freedom?<eos> Well, my dad said don't bring home any more dogs, cats, turtles or snakes, but he never said anything about predatory birds.<eos> Okay, in your terms, points are like mice...<eos> Don't interrupt.<eos> I just thought it would be nice if we shared an interest.<eos> You Korean girls know what a soldier likes.<eos> Fine!<eos> But the game is much more enjoyable if you understand it.
Jailbird, A Snake. That's his real name.<eos> Albert Knickerbocker Aloysius Snake-- has been arrested for a series of thefts and may be put to death under a controversial new statute.<eos> Yeah, we had a law stating<eos> "Three strikes and you're out."<eos> But I thought it was "You're out." So I let people go.<eos> So now it's "Four balls and you walk.<eos> Right to the electric chair."<eos> It's, uh, much clearer, Kent.<eos> Bart, I'm so sorry.<eos> I just wanted to ruin his life, not end it.
Oh, I can't tell you how many mill pigs we get in here who have bumblefoot or the slobbers.<eos> You don't have children, do you?<eos> This one whistled at me!<eos> Ooh, that could be the one.<eos> Oh, but that orange guy looks like a pumpkin.<eos> But this fellow is so fuzzy!<eos> Well, they all have their charms.<eos> This one's nibbling a sunflower seed.<eos> Look at that hair.<eos> Aw, I just want to comb it forever!
Quite valuable.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I expect it to go somewhere between 80 to $100,000.<eos> Nobody touch it!<eos> Bart, stop looking at it!<eos> But I want to see it!<eos> No, you'll wear it out!<eos> Baby, you saw something in this painting, and you were right.<eos> Wow, the Van Houtens owned this for years, and never knew how much it was worth.<eos> Think how happy they'll be when we sell it and split the money with them.
Look at the paddles!<eos> Stop the auction!<eos> That painting belongs to me!<eos> Dawn?<eos> Good to see you again, Beef Kirky.<eos> Who is this woman?<eos> While you two were separated, Kirk and used to be friends... with banana-fits.<eos> You told me you didn't see anyone during our separation.<eos> Madam, are you saying this painting belongs to you?<eos> Kirk stole it from me!
I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> It's a Johan Oldenveldt.<eos> Wrong!<eos> It's a me!<eos> A what?<eos> I painted it!
What?<eos> !<eos> You only cared about that painting when you thought it was created by someone famous.<eos> Well, no, but now when I look at it, all I see is a fraud.<eos> Beauty is beauty.<eos> My forgeries give pleasure to people all over the world.<eos> The only real question to ask about art, whether it's in the Louvre or on a freshman's wall at Cal State Fullerton is, "Did it move you?"<eos> But, you still, I mean...<eos> Oh, I suppose you're right.<eos> What if I never liked the painting and only wanted it for money?
Somebody want to tell me what the hell's going on here?<eos> Metatron is trying to play God.<eos> Play God?<eos> Cass, he erased angel warding.<eos> He friggin' blew out Holy Fire.<eos> He is God.<eos> He's powering up with the angel tablet.<eos> How the hell are we supposed to stop this guy?<eos> All right, so what if there is a stairway to heaven?<eos> We find it and get a drop on the guy.
Magic that powerful comes at a price, and right now we don't know what that price is.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm fan-friggin'-tastic.<eos> And I'm glad, honestly.<eos> I-I'm not saying we bury the thing.<eos> I'm saying we just save it for when we really need it.<eos> Crowley.<eos> Metatron.<eos> The big boss fights.<eos> You don't have to have it with you all the time, right?
Someone will die for this.<eos> Remarkably, I don't disagree.<eos> However, I would like to know where they learned such dark magic.<eos> I had hoped never to see that symbol again.<eos> I recall it is the signature of a fool who once stood against us.<eos> Clearly, some upstart witch is salvaging old tricks.<eos> I'll do for him as I did the other.<eos> Diego.<eos> When night falls, I want you to gather every vampire in the quarter.<eos> Get me the head of whoever did this and put it on a stick.
We've no room for slackers of cowards in our kingdom.<eos> Now that you've regained your composure, let's move on to the next item of business, shall we, with a little help from our dear friend Sophie.<eos> I got no reason to help you, and I sure as hell don't have a reason to help him.<eos> Now, now, don't be difficult, luv.<eos> You'll only live as long as you're of use to me, and right now, your best use is to explain why a witch I killed 100 years ago has come back for revenge.<eos> Come on.<eos> Resurrected witches with vast power?<eos> It's the harvest.<eos> 4 girls were meant to die and be reborn.<eos> I don't know how, but someone jacked that power, and they used it to bring back 4 witches, just not the right ones.
Tuesdays are notoriously quiet.<eos> Well, if Tuesdays are quiet, Fridays are...<eos> Do you ever have a busy day in here?<eos> Please.<eos> So... how is every little thing?<eos> Fine.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Welcome.<eos> These walnuts were grown in the Hunter Valley.<eos> Marcel has taken the meat of the walnut and fused it with Tasmanian truffle oil, shaved fennel grown in his own garden, and an infusion of herbs and aged Benedictine, served on a lime and beetroot smear.
Well, it was fine half an hour ago, so...<eos> Oh. We'll sort it out when we get home from work, hmm?<eos> Alright.<eos> You just relax.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Cleave.<eos> I'm right to come back to work.<eos> The prosecution's case consists of actual footage of Abbott and Costello breaking into the building.<eos> Um... Phil then takes his mask off to catch his breath, and then remembers and pulls it back on again.
Well, there's not much to tell, unfortunately.<eos> She's resisted every move I've made.<eos> She did come to the hospital the moment that she heard you'd been shot.<eos> You should have seen the look on her face.<eos> She was worried.<eos> Yeah, your point is?<eos> Well, you do have a knack for being blind to opportunities, especially when it comes to romance.<eos> Oh, you can talk.<eos> I have opened the window of opportunity to you at least twice.<eos> And I opened it for you probably four times.
He's even talking about redecorating.<eos> Redecorating?<eos> He says he wants to sell that painting of yours.<eos> The big one in the living room.<eos> That's an original.<eos> He can't sell that.<eos> He can do whatever he wants.<eos> With your house, with your bank accounts...<eos> You gave him power of attorney.<eos> Of course, now that you're getting stronger, you can always take it back.
- I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?<eos> That's where I found your Seaborg medal.<eos> How hard can it be to find a 160-year-old pump handle?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On who's doing the finding.<eos> - Where did you...<eos> - Where you left it.
Who can take down 5 opponents.<eos> Express their creativity. Break the rules without actually getting arrested.<eos> All of these reasons are in there somewhere.<eos> The player himself might not even know.<eos> He might not even understand it himself.<eos> But it's there.<eos> Medford, Oregon<eos> Gaming fulfills my competitive need.<eos> I'm a very competitive person. When it comes to sports, I consider gaming a sport.<eos> So I use my competitiveness and I fuel it with Dota.
He's gonna jump out!<eos> He goes for the Dream Coil!<eos> He gets them!<eos> He gets EHOME!<eos> Holds them in the middle lane.<eos> Na'Vi already on their way out of the pit.<eos> They're coming in to help out Dendi.<eos> Then we just went in and demolished them.<eos> Now they're on top of the Tier 3 tower.<eos> They're going to bring it down.
They're saying he's not even human.<eos> - Gary...<eos> - What is he?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> What the hell is he, and how come you're not out there looking for him?<eos> I'm doing everything I can.<eos> You're getting coffee!<eos> You need to get outta here.<eos> Now.<eos> Hey, you gonna do your job, Sheriff, or are you gonna let other people do it for you?
Doing it when there's a mass murderer spotted nearby is insane!<eos> If I was four years younger, I'd punch you.<eos> What?<eos> Coach, that doesn't make sense.<eos> Oh, well, it does to me!<eos> There.<eos> We didn't find anything.<eos> Not even a scent.<eos> It's 3:00, so school's over.<eos> If there was a bomb, wouldn't he have set it off by now?
She wants to talk.<eos> She shouldn't have done that.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> It's just the opposite.<eos> Esme probably wanted to be the one to tell you this, but...<eos> She won an audition to the high-school program at the avalon academy of performing arts.<eos> Oh, my God, Joshua, that's fantastic!<eos> I know. It's huge.<eos> And it comes with a scholarship, so if she gets it, you don't have to pay anymore for her fancy private school.
See, Claire and Anna had two issues...<eos> The Capgras and lesbian bed death.<eos> I realized you could use one to solve the other.<eos> Go on.<eos> You know how some people really get off on illicit sex?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, apparently, Claire and Anna have super-hot sexual love when Anna thinks she's cheating on Claire with a stranger.<eos> And voila... no more LBD.<eos> And when Anna hears Claire's voice without actually seeing her face, she recognizes Claire as her loving, devoted wife.<eos> So, they can totally have their cake and eat it, too.
My day at the Cube was amazing.<eos> Don't forget your sheet music.<eos> Uh, mom.<eos> Where'd you get that shirt?<eos> I thought you'd like it.<eos> [Laughs]<eos> Not on you!<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> You can't really pull off that kind of thing at all.<eos> Just take it back.
(CHUCKLING) Okay.<eos> (PATS ARM)<eos> (FLASHLIGHT CLICKS)<eos> I think these things just unscrew.<eos> No, you got to go in through the drain, like a nasoscopy.<eos> Guys, I'm pretty sure it's righty-loosey, lefty-tighty.<eos> Don't you take computers apart and put them back together in your sleep?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's too bad she didn't lose her ring down a hard drive.<eos> We need one of those things that grabs the pipe and... Yanks it in a twisting motion.
Bye.<eos> (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS)<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> (LAUGHING) Oh, my God.<eos> Um, I'm working.<eos> I told you to go home.<eos> Chill.<eos> The restaurant's slammed.<eos> I'm just helping out.<eos> If I need help, I'll ask for it.
Scalpel.<eos> All right, clamp.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> You can't use metal instruments in the live ordnance.<eos> Well, how do you suggest I get it out?<eos> With your fingers...<eos> Very carefully.<eos> The round is impact-detonated.<eos> The slightest excess manual pressure could set it off.
You suffered trauma.<eos> There must be another attending who could do this.<eos> They're all scrubbed on other cases.<eos> - It's me or nobody. - One, two, three, lift.<eos> The hematoma has to be evacuated now.<eos> Bick, you cannot operate on someone who shot you.<eos> I've seen the scan.<eos> The tumor invaded the amygdala.<eos> It's not this kid's fault.<eos> I want to take it out.
Don't try to play me, Catherine.<eos> I know Bickman hangs out at the Mirabella.<eos> Esme told me.<eos> Is this where you were the night you told me you lost your phone?<eos> - What?<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> Okay, this is absurd.<eos> I mean, the pen could be Bickman's.<eos> Of course it can.<eos> I mean, I could've picked it up at work.
Could you tell me what brings you here today?<eos> Look at me, okay?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Really look at me. I'm a mess.<eos> I'm not normal right now.<eos> I have these emotions, okay?<eos> I laugh.<eos> I cry.<eos> Right now, I want to throttle you.<eos> I want to... I want to take your head, and I want to pop it right now.
- You're on the wrong side, Remy.<eos> - Yeah, well, one of us sure is.<eos> And when the bumblebee flew home, all his friends were waiting with buckets of honey, right?<eos> And he's got his worm friend, and his mouse friend, and his spider friend, and his snail friend, and they all had tons of honey.<eos> - I like his feet.<eos> - - And he looks happier now, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - They're funny, right?<eos> - So they all buzzed with happiness, because life is sweet when you spend it with your friends.
That swamp bitch can't even spell her own name, and now she gets the keys to the kingdom?<eos> I mean, I came back from the dead.<eos> Yeah, Misty brought you back.<eos> I could be the Supreme.<eos> Yeah, the mind reading's a real party trick, Mumbles the Clown.<eos> My powers are growing.<eos> I can do mind control.<eos> Prove it.<eos> Put out that cigarette.<eos> Now stick it in your vagina.
I cannot tell you how playing this instrument soothes my soul in tempestuous times.<eos> Nothing could soothe my soul.<eos> I have nothing to offer this coven anymore.<eos> Who am I?<eos> What do I do?<eos> You buck up, is what you do!<eos> Face reality headlong and carry on. But how?<eos> I have no one, and my powers are gone.<eos> Your salad dressing is absolutely magical.<eos> Maybe you could bottle it.
Over and over, over and over.<eos> It's okay, it's okay, I'm right here.<eos> I'm right here, it's okay.<eos> Are we all back?<eos> Everyone but Misty.<eos> Freak.<eos> You're a freak.<eos> Mr. Kringley, she did it again.<eos> Where's the dissection frog?<eos> It's right there, she brought it back to life.
Not sure.<eos> I saw him at the White House a lot when I was on presidential detail.<eos> I never really knew what he did.<eos> Imagine growing up with that guy, going to bed worried the tooth fairy's gonna slit your throat.<eos> He did something right.<eos> She's incredibly driven.<eos> Or still seeking his approval.<eos> That stuff's hard to shake.<eos> That's why everyone in my family ended up dying on some dusty battlefield somewhere.<eos> I'm the fifth Vaughn to go to war, first one to survive it.
Now there is an internal investigation.<eos> I'm under the microscope.<eos> The Office of the Inspector General has ordered a psych eval to determine my competency to sit in this chair.<eos> Well, what do you want me to do?<eos> If you don't want me to go back, I won't.<eos> We didn't have this conversation.<eos> And... since we didn't have this conversation, I want you to go and do whatever it is you believe it is your job to do.<eos> Do you know what your job is?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Then do it.
She doesn't...<eos> She has a heartbeat.<eos> Something's beating.<eos> I don't want you to see me.<eos> I don't want you to see what I do.<eos> I want to calm you, comfort you.<eos> There's so much comfort in darkness.<eos> But not for one of you.<eos> I took your life...<eos> And then tried to give it back to you.
I believe my brother won't stop.<eos> How does it make you feel?<eos> Angry.<eos> Anger is an energizing emotion, prompts action against threat.<eos> If you're angry, you're optimistic you can stop this from happening again.<eos> I know how to stop it.<eos> If you really want to kill your brother, Margot, wait until you can get away with it.<eos> Or find someone to do it for you.<eos> You said you were worried about the bird.<eos> Thought you might like to see it.
We might have three.<eos> I'm a good fisherman too, Will.<eos> They tell me you were hard to find.<eos> That was the idea.<eos> Thank you for visiting me in the hospital and for what you said.<eos> I didn't say enough.<eos> And now's your chance to say it all.<eos> You've been granted immunity from prosecution by the US Attorney from District 36, and by local authorities in a memorandum attached, sworn and attested.<eos> Let's talk about Hannibal Lecter.<eos> Some psychiatrists are so hungry for insight that they may try to manufacture it.
Mr. Verger, you are a patient of Dr. Hannibal Lecter, isn't that right?<eos> Dr. Lecter, yes, yes.<eos> Have you ever seen or met another patient of Dr. Lecter's, a man called Will Graham?<eos> Will Graham.<eos> The man that didn't kill all those people.<eos> - That Will Graham?<eos> - Yes. Can't say that I've had the pleasure.<eos> Do you find that Dr. Lecter's therapy has been helpful to you?<eos> I've benefited greatly from Dr. Lecter's therapy.<eos> I'm still benefitting from it.
- God, stop talking.<eos> ... re-record my vocals on party fowl.<eos> No, sativa gives me anxiety attacks.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Someone's here.<eos> - Someone has keys?<eos> - Should I hide the weed?<eos> - Yeah, it's my sister.<eos> She's got keys, and yes, hide the pot, or she'll smoke it all.
Mostly 'cause I don't give a crap.<eos> You can beat Michael Rubenstone.<eos> I mean, what has he got that my delicious boy doesn't?<eos> Cookies!<eos> His mom made them, and they're the perfect mix of chewy and crunchy.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Oh, so we're baking political cookies now, huh?<eos> You wanted war?<eos> You've got it, Betsy Rubenstone.
Inshallah.<eos> Oh. Haven't you ever heard,<eos> God helps those who help themselves?<eos> The Koran says,<eos> "Indeed, Allah will not change the condition of a people until they change what is in themselves."<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> Let's change our condition and get the hell out of here.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> Take off your clothes.<eos> And throw it in the fire with anything else you think we can use to smoke up this place.
Do you think you're smarter than your old friend Peter Burke?<eos> Yes.<eos> And Peter thinks he's smarter than me.<eos> Well, you can't both be right.<eos> Which has resulted in years of debate.<eos> Now, one for one, truth for truth.<eos> Tell me what happened in Caracas.<eos> May 21, 2009.<eos> An opera at the Teatro Teresa Carreno, tight security--<eos> I snuck in, removed a wire from the orchestra's piano, and slipped it...
No, he thanked me, then proceeded to bolt out of the building.<eos> It looks like he tucked something small in his pocket.<eos> Looks like a thumb drive.<eos> Where was he headed?<eos> Home.<eos> I bet he had a reason.<eos> Like hiding the drive from the FBI.<eos> Firms like DCFI pay a fortune for their trading algorithms.<eos> Yeah, a millisecond means the difference between gaining and losing millions.<eos> If there's an algorithm on that drive, it makes sense that Worth would want to steal it.

Looks like 1,500 private and government intelligence experts attended.<eos> Check the cellphone towers near that hotel.<eos> Maybe she stayed there.<eos> Yeah, she was within range of their towers for all three days.<eos> Maybe something happened at that hotel during the conference.<eos> Or maybe she met someone and decided to leak or sell intelligence.<eos> Senator Bloomfield's giving a press conference.<eos> Some claim that my daughter was about to divulge sensitive intelligence information.<eos> Well, she got out in front of it.<eos> The media must have been about to break it.
Exalting their dignity by showing a little of it ourselves.<eos> - By showing a lot of it.<eos> - Will, they've got to keep...<eos> Don't reach for common ground.<eos> Reach for higher ground.<eos> Am I saying this right?<eos> - He's saying we're the grown-ups.<eos> - Get back to work.<eos> - I think I blew that speech.<eos> - They got some of it.

Then he took it all away from me.<eos> But I stayed good.<eos> I'm talking too much.<eos> My mother always said,<eos> "Don't burden others with your problems."<eos> Such a pretty shade.<eos> I've done something, Mrs. Steinmetz.<eos> Something very, very bad.<eos> It's opened a door.<eos> And I don't think I can close it again.
I forgot.<eos> You haven't been smoking out here, have you?<eos> Why do you assume I'm a smoker?<eos> 'Cause you grew up in Oswego.<eos> Well, I quit.<eos> More money for whiskey.<eos> I smell smoke.<eos> Is that mascara?<eos> Why do you have mascara?<eos> 'Cause they sell it at commissary.
Look, I got to get back to work.<eos> Has Roy mentioned anything about the man in the skull mask who injected him?<eos> Roy is not the kind of guy who is comfortable discussing his feelings.<eos> Not like you and me.<eos> Don't yell at me, but I really think we need a new plan on how to find this creepy mask guy.<eos> Scaring the crap out of low-lifes isn't yielding results.<eos> Felicity, I am open to any and all suggestions.<eos> Oliver, maybe we're over thinking this.<eos> What if the mask simply got wind that you were after him and decided to skip town?<eos> He didn't go to all the trouble of recreating the serum and testing it on people just to walk away.
I didn't have a choice.<eos> The earthquake--<eos> I needed to see my family, make sure they were safe.<eos> And so they are.<eos> Come home.<eos> I can't.<eos> Look, I can't go back, Nyssa.<eos> I don't have much of a soul left in me, but what there is, it can't take the killing anymore.<eos> You swore an oath.<eos> My father sent me here to make sure you honor it.
She came to see you?<eos> No.<eos> No, because... she's staying with that man.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I told her that she had to face my dad.<eos> How'd he take that?<eos> How did he say he took it, or how did he really take it?<eos> There's this empty part of me.<eos> It's always been there.<eos> I filled it with schoolwork and ambition, but... deep down, I knew... it could never be filled, because... she was gone.
Good call, maybe.<eos> And...<eos> Yep.<eos> That's our bench.<eos> What, you don't know the Latin for "bench"?<eos> No need to be snippy just because I was right.<eos> I said "good call" already.<eos> What now?<eos> Well, it's too late today.<eos> We come back tomorrow at lunchtime, leave the newspaper, see who picks it up.
Yes. Jane?<eos> Ronaldo did not have much of a life outside the Cruz case.<eos> Guess not.<eos> This is weird.<eos> What?<eos> Everything taped to the walls is old except for this map.<eos> Looks brand-new.<eos> What's it doing here?<eos> Got me.<eos> Let's make sure we take it back with us.
Do you have Madison's phone?<eos> Here.<eos> The techs say that there's an audio file recorded at 5:52 the morning of Madison's murder.<eos> Apparently, she recorded a message for herself.<eos> That was around the same time she was killed.<eos> What if she got audio of the -- of the killer?<eos> What's on it?<eos> They don't know.<eos> It's too damaged.<eos> They can repair it, but it'll take weeks.
I know when something's real.<eos> And when it could get serious.<eos> I feel that way about us.<eos> Do you... feel that way?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Look, one thing I know is that when you feel that way about someone, you got to hang on, 'cause...<eos> Because it doesn't happen very often.<eos> Marcus.<eos> You cannot turn down this job.<eos> They are not gonna offer it to you again.
Madeline pratt.<eos> How do we find her?<eos> Finding her is easy.<eos> Catching her is difficult.<eos> Luckily, she has asked me to help her plan a heist.<eos> To steal what?<eos> Novak: The effigy of astarte.<eos> The effigy was thought to be lost. Disappeared from the british museum in 1983.<eos> Two months ago, it pops up at an estate sale in henderson, kentucky.<eos> The feds raided the auction and repatriated it back to the syrians.
Gone with her.<eos> I have what you want.<eos> When you've wired payment, I'll contact you with the location of the effigy.<eos> If I don't hear from you within the hour, it's gone.<eos> Where the hell is reddington?<eos> He told me he was going to try and locate pratt.<eos> For all we know, he set up this whole thing So he could get the identities of the russian spies, Damaging national security.<eos> The syrians know the safe was opened as a distraction, And they're still trying to account for exactly who Was in that panic room with the effigy.<eos> They're attributing the whole heist to reddington.<eos> She knew where the effigy was the entire time And she used us to get it.
That is the last thing I want.<eos> It's not always about what you want, liz.<eos> Want me to rough him up for you?<eos> I hate this job.<eos> How do you know madeline pratt?<eos> She called me last month. Asked about the effigy.<eos> I'd never met her before, And I don't know how she found me.<eos> So why did she call you then?<eos> Because the effigy of astarte once belonged to my father.<eos> He stole it from the british museum.

He was a patriot who revered astarte.<eos> He thought it belonged in syria.<eos> Then why put it up for auction?<eos> He didn't.<eos> Until the americans raided our compound. What were they looking for?<eos> All I remember is opening a door And seeing him holding the statue.<eos> He slipped something in it. A piece of paper.<eos> Ressler: What did it say?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But he placed the effigy in my arms And told me to run and protect it.
You place one of these near a high profile target, The fallout alone guarantees mass casualties.<eos> Get a nest team on standby.<eos> Where are we on kalif?<eos> We confirmed reddington's allegation.<eos> Rasil kalif is an asset working undercover for the russian mafia.<eos> If they get their hands on these nukes,<eos> God knows who they may sell them to.<eos> The syrians aren't getting the effigy back.<eos> It's gone.<eos> I've already sold it to the russians.
"Alan Ray Rifkin."<eos> It's a case folder.<eos> Research, evidence.<eos> Frank was reviewing trial transcripts for The Judge.<eos> ...<eos> Alan Ray Rifkin. American college student. Dropped out, joined the Army.<eos> In 2003, he was tried and convicted as an enemy combatant. Fought alongside the Taliban.<eos> He's scheduled for execution tomorrow.<eos> According to the charges, Rifkin and a few dozen Taliban fighters raided an Afghan village, killing dozens of civilians.<eos> At trial, Rifkin's lawyers claimed it was friendly fire, that the American military destroyed the village from the air, mistaking it for a Taliban outpost.
Uh, Brian.<eos> Examine the injury.<eos> What?<eos> - You wanted to run point.<eos> - Take a look.<eos> Uh, Brian, how's it look?<eos> It's up there.<eos> It's really up there.<eos> I could've told you that.<eos> Can you get it out?
Accidentally, I swear.<eos> I thought no-one will believe this.<eos> I panicked.<eos> And... You put his body into the river.<eos> I nearly called you.<eos> I nearly did.<eos> But, instead, you just carried on as normal.<eos> And the next day, off you went to Berwick.<eos> But not before picking up his car from the restaurant.<eos> And driving it back to his place, so it would look like he'd returned.
I did.<eos> I think so. Mm-hmm.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get this started.<eos> I'm Doug Greathouse, as you all know.<eos> I don't usually emcee these things, but, uh, as my wife says, "There's more to life than the problems between a shapely pair of knees."<eos> Uh, tonight, we tackle rubella.<eos> Rubella, or German measles as it's more commonly called, is a worldwide scourge.<eos> No disrespect to any Germans here tonight, but it's called German measles because it was discovered by a Kraut.<eos> Now, it could have just as easily been discovered by a Jap and then we'd be calling it fried rice.
Of all the gin joints.<eos> Well, I might say the same, Betty, since I would be expected to be at a medical fundraiser.<eos> Oh, I get invited to all these rubber-chicken deals.<eos> It's not 'cause they like me.<eos> It's 'cause they like my money.<eos> And everybody loves my wife.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But it is pure luck running into you tonight.<eos> You know, um, well, Bets and I are, uh, we're having a hell of a time getting in a family way, if you catch my drift.<eos> Uh, yeah, he catches it, uh, honey.
Do not give yourself over.<eos> D... do not move.<eos> Do not call anyone.<eos> I am coming to you right now.<eos> [Beep] First, I'm sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> She's pretty much admitting she murdered her husband.<eos> Where did you get that tape?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> We can't use it... inadmissible.
Where's the bomb? - You must be Eli.<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Exactly as Marie described you.<eos> - Where is the bomb?<eos> - And you must be Olivia.<eos> I haven't seen you since you were... how old were you?<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Where is it, Dominic?<eos> I'm an artist.<eos> Just because I sell you a canvas doesn't mean I know where you're planning to hang it.
After you.<eos> I'm telling you, fellas, you need to buy in now before the gas starts flowin' and I up the minimum investment.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All my money's tied up in the yacht.<eos> I've been in that movie.<eos> So is he planning to stick around?<eos> Like, what was he doing in Bali?<eos> And what kind of name is "Tag"?<eos> Mel, I work for Krista now. Did you not get that memo?<eos> Because you wrote it.
We can put the world back to how it was.<eos> Can't go back, Bob. We can!<eos> You don't have to do this!<eos> We saw you go into the woods with a bag and come out without it.<eos> Had to pull my spotters back before we could go look for it.<eos> What was in it?<eos> You hid it, right?<eos> In case things went bad?<eos> Smart.<eos> Still, we'll find it.
Who saw that ad?<eos> Doesn't matter, alright.<eos> At least I am trying.<eos> At least I am not scared and taking a U-turn, like you.<eos> You're a coward.<eos> - Fine. I am a coward.<eos> Happy.<eos> Now get him out of my room.<eos> You know what, my Amitabh Bachchan DVD collection.<eos> Give it back.
I have people who do that for me.<eos> I just want you to take care of it before I arrive.<eos> Just keep in mind how much this will benefit us both, yeah?<eos> Mr. Quinn, plane's waiting for you, sir.<eos> And you can't think of anyone here who'd want to hurt you?<eos> I don't know anyone.<eos> Donnie, I'm gonna have you escorted back to your room.<eos> You get some rest and stay warm.<eos> Sorry I ruined your lecture.<eos> I was really looking forward to it.
Please don't cry<eos> We should wait here<eos> Alright<eos> Send me your address<eos> Okay, bye<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I gotta go to Taichung<eos> You really don't have to come with me<eos> You should go to the exhibition<eos> We were supposed to see it together
There's this guy<eos> His friends gave him a can of soda<eos> Hold on...<eos> So he put it in the refrigerator<eos> After a few weeks He took it out For some reason<eos> The can just kept on swelling<eos> He didn't know what to do<eos> He didn't know how to get rid of it<eos> So he just...<eos> Kept holding it in his hands
Yes, I do. Come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Okay, perfect.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm a Chicago cop with a gun on his ankle, and I'm shaking like a leaf.<eos> It's the adrenaline.<eos> The metal taste in the back of your mouth, it's how you know you're alive.<eos> Who are you?<eos> All right, the maid's almost done.<eos> Get the cart and go around the corner with it.
Sir, don't look at me that way.<eos> I am not a terrorist.<eos> I just move things from one place to another.<eos> I know about you moving things, Bashir.<eos> I know about your remodeled car.<eos> I know about Pendleton.<eos> Pendleton... was a long time ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You think that changes who you are?<eos> All this time I have done a job, and I have done it to perfection.
I'm trying to sleep.<eos> There's a woman shacking up in here.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Come on down.<eos> She hot?<eos> Don't grab your pecker just yet.<eos> She ain't here.<eos> What the hell you hollering about?<eos> Found her shirt.<eos> Must have washed it this morning.
Oh, god Anna.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Tom turned out negative and... Lydia didn't wanna know. But I'm positive.<eos> Baby how are you feeling?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> One good thing, at least I found out now before the next IUI testing.<eos> I guess there's a way they can test the embryo so... they can make sure the baby's gonna be ok.<eos> Anna where are you?<eos> I'm on my way to a lecture... but I can cancel it and I can be right there.
Do you want me out of the office or the building, in general?<eos> 'Cause I... you just got to be clear with me right now.<eos> Get out of here and close the door... behind you.<eos> Okay, I'm going.<eos> I'm not looking.<eos> I'm a gentleman.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> - Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I catch the bird, you want me to bring it back?
Just checking. Stay with me here.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Okay.<eos> No inter-abdominal metastases.<eos> Proximal sigmoid is mobile.<eos> Rectosigmoid's clear.<eos> Okay.<eos> Part of the tumor is stuck to the side of the uterus.<eos> Can you get under it?<eos> I think maybe if I can get my fingers in there... might be able to peel it off.
I dare say that was always their plan.<eos> I dare say it was, Your Ladyship.<eos> I should be glad to accept.<eos> Now, if you can all put your swords away, perhaps we can finish our dinner in a civilised manner.<eos> But I admire it, when young people stand up for their principles.<eos> Principles are like prayers. Noble, of course, but awkward at a party.<eos> James, did my eyes deceive me, or did Lady Anstruther pass you a note during dinner?<eos> Yes, Mr Carson.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> He's thrown it away.
Hi.<eos> Well, that was awkward.<eos> Armageddon can be.<eos> Just ask Ben and Liv.<eos> You have to forgive her, Kenz.<eos> Life is too short.<eos> Yeah, I remember, my boyfriend just died.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And Rainer's also dead.<eos> Which means I have his soul, and a second chance to deliver it where I should have in the first place.
- is for Walker to call him off personally. - Then make that happen.<eos> I cannot force a man who thinks I'm his enemy to suddenly call me his friend.<eos> I've done what I had to do.<eos> Now you do what you have to do.<eos> Seduce him.<eos> Give him your heart.<eos> Cut it out and put it in his fucking hands.<eos> [Frank] Dear Mr. President.<eos> I'm writing you on an Underwood portable my father gave me when I left for the Sentinel.<eos> It was the words my father said when he gave it to me that resonated even more than this 70-year-old machine.
Stuck in an eternity of watching over that hideous creature my children call brother.<eos> You're dead.<eos> How can I be here?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> The baby!<eos> The baby? Aah!<eos> That kid never had a chance!<eos> And as if your bloodline isn't filth enough, you poison it by merging it with Klaus'?

Go to wardrobe, get dressed.<eos> Okay.<eos> No need to write a speech. I wrote it for you.
Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Ma'am!<eos> You didn't sign the back of the check.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, you know, I wasn't sure if there was a special teller I should go to for checks that are this large?<eos> Ooh, 8K, unh!<eos> You know how she got it, dude?<eos> This bitch right here drew this illustration, and a sexy-ass new dating web site bought it for $8,000!
Do I or do I not have herpes?<eos> I do, you don't.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I want to read so many of this books.<eos> This is unreal.<eos> I can't believe I can get a room in Manhattan for 900 bucks a month.<eos> See, I told you you'd find something.<eos> This place is perfect.<eos> Hey, if she doesn't get the room, I might.<eos> No, I'm taking it.
You're still working on that memory thing.<eos> Not just memory.<eos> It's more of a friend.<eos> Maybe one day, this guy will watch over you, learn from you... protect you.<eos> Well, if anyone can do it, it's you.<eos> The world spins on dreamers like you, Harold.<eos> Yeah, I should change, shouldn't I?<eos> You know, I'm gonna tell everybody at The Pines my son is changing the world.<eos> Why does Control want the drives to a broken program?<eos> The program's only broken until somebody smart fixes it.
- Who else has access to the loft?<eos> - Maid comes once a week.<eos> Handyman.<eos> The doormen all have keys.<eos> Is it the same handyman that I had fix the lock on the window?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe someone came in that way.<eos> You can walk right across the roof.<eos> May... Maybe she had someone help her kill herself.<eos> The only way we're gonna know is if we get this cork, bring it to the lab and let them test it for drugs.
Here you go.<eos> One for each of you.<eos> Don't send it all back home, okay?<eos> Thanks, amigos.<eos> Hey, Paco, get a round of half shots for my friends here.<eos> Make sure it's half shots, okay?<eos> - Yo, Kev.<eos> -Yeah? - You clean out that apartment yet?<eos> -Yeah, just got it cleaned out.<eos> I'm gonna set up some flyers and see if I can rent it out.

Yeah.<eos> Good, so regarding the pot...<eos> Mmm-hmm. We can get you that 60 bucks A.S.A.P.<eos> Okay.<eos> Or...<eos> This office warehouse gift card has $135 on it.<eos> Whoa. I know, it's like, what do they even have there?<eos> Only any office supply known to man.<eos> I mean, I think they even have food now.<eos> Oh, yeah... no, I'll take it.

I'm not gonna be a tax expert overnight, you know?<eos> It's a process, we're all going through a process.<eos> You know, last year they got me $600 back, so.<eos> I think they might just be sending you money.<eos> They're just sending you money.<eos> I think you're very wrong.<eos> No, I think I'm right.<eos> I just wanna get home and watch my shows.<eos> I need you to take this pot.<eos> I can't even, like, have it on--
Hey, Bevers, you hear the door knock earlier?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Why didn't you answer it?<eos> I know you don't like me to answer the door because I don't technically live here.<eos> Yeah, you don't technically live here, but when I'm not home, feel free to answer the door.<eos> It could be something important.<eos> Okay, now we've worked that out.<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Hi, thanks for holding.<eos> So your package is still on the truck, but you can pick it up from the distribution center after 4:30.
You messed up my entire thing today.<eos> I think we should talk.<eos> We're talking right now.<eos> I think what needs to happen is you need to go home 'cause you don't live here.<eos> What?<eos> You need to grab all your little flip flops and all your socks and you need to get out.<eos> Jesus, what?<eos> Whoa. Jeremy.<eos> Okay, I don't have the package.<eos> I don't have it.

This sounds like something the one true Morty might say.<eos> I'm sick of being a human shield.<eos> I want to be a gardener!<eos> I want to write really crazy, intense action novels!<eos> I'm more than just a hammer!<eos> He is the one true Morty!<eos> Hooray! The one true Morty!<eos> Hey, keep it down!<eos> You've lived quite a life, Rick.<eos> It's a real shame you're not gonna be around to see it through.
Just what every girl wants to hear from her boyfriend.<eos> So I'm still your boyfriend?<eos> As long as you understand it's not a part-time job.<eos> Understood.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rem, you have to get some rest, okay?<eos> We can't have you sleepwalking again.<eos> I will.<eos> But first I need to find out what's so important about this cameo.<eos> Esther must have put it in that suitcase for a reason.
He'd be dead right now if you wouldn't have stopped me.<eos> But he's not.<eos> That's all that matters.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I wanted to kill Roy.<eos> Because that's what I do.<eos> That's who I am.<eos> I spent six years in the darkness.<eos> And I looked into the eyes of the devil and I gave him my soul.<eos> Let me help you get it back.
Sara's gone.<eos> Slade must have taken her.<eos> Chert.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's sonar.<eos> I was monitoring the "Amazo."<eos> She's moving.<eos> We have one torpedo left, right?<eos> Da.<eos> Could you rig it to fire in a straight line?
Please, I've made plenty of girls laugh, sometimes just by asking them out.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I fake my orgasms.<eos> Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses?<eos> Really?<eos> How much for three?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I'll call you back.<eos> Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing.<eos> I didn't mean to call it idiotic.
Yeah?<eos> Well, I fake my orgasms.<eos> Yes, how much for a hundred long-stemmed red roses?<eos> Really?<eos> How much for three?<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, I'll call you back.<eos> Look, I know you were just trying to help with your Star Wars thing.<eos> I didn't mean to call it idiotic.<eos> Well, I don't think you called it idiotic.
What other choice do I have?<eos> Have faith that my plans proceed as they must.<eos> I intend to take my rightful place at the appropriate time.<eos> The Bible has offered me no guidance here.<eos> So you've turned to another book?<eos> Oh, Lupo.<eos> The Book of Leaves is a distraction.<eos> Here my brother and I agree.<eos> Your brother has hidden the page from me.<eos> Locked it away in the bowels of the secret archives, forbidden me from even touching it.
Now you have nothing to eat for lunch.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> It's nice to get some attention from a man who's not trying to sell me a reverse mortgage.<eos> (groans) So, we cool, Lorna?<eos> Yeah, we cool.<eos> (chuckles) See that?<eos> Everybody's cool.<eos> Everybody is not cool!<eos> Ginny is being so unreasonable.<eos> I scratched her car, then I fixed it, but we're still not cool.
That is sick, man.<eos> Dorian, will you stop punching things?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Low charge again.<eos> Kennex.<eos> What are we dealing with, a victim or a criminal?<eos> Victim, but he definitely robbed the bank.<eos> We found the money.<eos> What about the bomb?<eos> Well, he claims someone attached it to him.
John,<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> There's nothing we can do.<eos> Tell my wife I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> What kind of bomb was it?<eos> Propylene oxide.<eos> The filler is typical, but the wiring is very sophisticated...<eos> multiple decoys.<eos> I'm still trying to reconstruct it.
Troy Megliarino.<eos> He spent a hot sec in jail, but he lives in South Jersey and I know he'd steal a car and come up for the night.<eos> Chris Wazcyleski, he was a nude model in my life drawing class and he, like, always angled himself out to me.<eos> Chad Michael Fong.<eos> We met at a hardware store, he was disgusting.<eos> You know, I'm picking all white dudes right now.<eos> I must be craving pink dick.<eos> I'm gonna go with this.<eos> (Abbi) Okay, who else, who else?<eos> Henry Rowdenbush, had a unibrow all through middle school and then he started waxing it and all of a sudden it was like, glasses off, you're (bleep) gorgeous.
So this is my phone, this is your phone.<eos> My phone, your phone, okay?<eos> There's two.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I must have taken that on incident.<eos> I swear.<eos> Like, that makes sense 'cause I called my mom and she was like, way nicer than usual.<eos> I've been following you, like, all day today, I don't know how you didn't feel this vibrating at all.<eos> This purse is enormous.<eos> I carry it to make me look petite.
Okay, so, we both know that I'm 25, but what Mary doesn't yet know is that my license is expired.<eos> We're gonna need to come up with a plan in the next 20 seconds inside this huddle, 'cause when I created the huddle, I thought by this time I'd have a plan.<eos> I don't.<eos> - I'm gonna keep... - Here's my license and the AMEX should cover insurance.<eos> This isn't a sugar daddy thing.<eos> This is just an old, established "guy paying for his younger friend he has sex with" kind of thing, so just get that right out of your mind, you know?<eos> Well, you're all set.<eos> There's only one vehicle left.<eos> It doesn't have AC, but it's really spacious.<eos> We'll take it.
I like it, that's my frog costume.<eos> You're gonna have to let go of the frog costume, dude.<eos> Did you know that male giraffes will head butt the girl giraffes in the tummy and then it makes them pee and then they smell the pee to check if they're ovulating.<eos> Are giraffes like, your thing?<eos> I just like 'em, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I like, love rabbits, they're my thing.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> Now, I think now is the time to eat the ham.<eos> Okay, do you need help?<eos> We can leave it in there for longer if you think people aren't hungry, though.
- No, I wouldn't.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're not really interested in caring about others.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I'm interested in caring about others.<eos> I care about John.<eos> I keep John alive.<eos> His water bowl is always empty.<eos> I fill it.
No.<eos> Can we get Mexican pizza?<eos> No, Mexican pizzas are stupid.<eos> That does not make sense.<eos> I'd love Mexican pizza.<eos> Well, then maybe we should get a delicious Mexican pizza.<eos> Nobody likes you.<eos> I think that we should probably give Tom some pizza.<eos> Okay, Tom, uh, you can have some pizza.<eos> But what you have to do is you have to order it, and when you order it, you have to ask for extra jalapenos... except, instead of saying jalapenos, you have to say "jalapenos."
I dunno.<eos> You didn't tell anyone when you did it.<eos> It's different.<eos> - How?<eos> - I didn't plan it.<eos> She planned it.<eos> Okay.<eos> She left me a note.<eos> Okay.<eos> I haven't read it.
You and him out a deal?<eos> Sorry, son.<eos> Well, one more question before I go.<eos> How did you spend your take of our first hit?<eos> That's what you're asking me?<eos> I invested it.<eos> It's always best to make your money work for you.<eos> That's funny.<eos> I did much the same.<eos> I didn't even take my cut. I split it three ways.
Th-this does not end well for you.<eos> If you just put the remote down, we'll never speak of this ever again.<eos> I surrender.<eos> Hey.<eos> About before, I'm sorry if I was a little prickly.<eos> Yeah, you were.<eos> Without the "-ly."<eos> I know, I know, I know, I know.<eos> I'm just tense because this meeting is so important to me.<eos> Well, you can relax, because Mansfield told me to cancel it.
No!<eos> - Ah! Damn!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - I'm hanging up!<eos> No, you're n...<eos> You just transferred the call.<eos> Do any of you guys know how to use these phones?<eos> Look, you... you cannot cancel that meeting.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll do it without him.
Please advise.<eos> Mario.<eos> This was two weeks before the messenger was murdered.<eos> "Angie's weekly" must be her heroin.<eos> Maybe the rest of the package wasn't drugs.<eos> [Squeals] Oh, this is so freaking exciting.<eos> - What?<eos> - Police stuff.<eos> I feel like I'm in a TV show.<eos> If the note is here, he never sent it.
Oh, this is definitely bigger than mine.<eos> No, don't-don't worry about that.<eos> I am taller than you...<eos> No, the lump is slightly larger than mine and... rounder.<eos> Mine was oblong. Yeah.<eos> Now, texture-wise...<eos> Oh!<eos> Ooh, don't press it like that!<eos> You might dislodge it.<eos> Then we'll never find it in my body.
You're right.<eos> I did say that.<eos> And I'm sorry I lied.<eos> I just wanted a fair shot, and I didn't think you'd see me otherwise.<eos> And you'd be right.<eos> But I believe you will come to find that there is no one else in this town, this county, this state who is better qualified for this job than me.<eos> - Than I.<eos> - And with your consent,<eos> I-I would love to share my dissertation with you.<eos> And I would love to read it as soon as it's completed.
- How can you know that?<eos> - Because I hired someone to pretend to offer money to file a lawsuit.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's just lies.<eos> Everything out of your mouth is lies and lies.<eos> The point is, Clark is better off.<eos> Great.<eos> See?<eos> You want the truth.<eos> Then you punish me for saying it!
! Because I do know what he's capable of.<eos> Lock the door.<eos> I know you're scared.<eos> But I just need you to calm down and just look at me.<eos> Okay?<eos> I need you to trust me.<eos> Access my personnel file.<eos> How do I do that?<eos> Gabriel, we used to listen to Mozart's 5th symphony together, okay?<eos> You... you hated it, but in learning to identify a single violin, that taught you how to exclude all but one sensory input.
- Ah!<eos> - Whoa.<eos> Not the face.<eos> Aah!<eos> Fore.<eos> Nice shot.<eos> Mr. Reese, it seems that the ISA took a mutually beneficial financial interest in the Black Market Bazaar, which they could ill afford to have come out.<eos> It still doesn't explain why the machine put me on this plane.<eos> I didn't program the machine to detect national embarrassments, Mr. Reese.<eos> I designed it to prevent a national tragedy.
I was nuts about it.<eos> I was passionate.<eos> Nobody told me yet that adults are supposed to be ashamed of those feelings.<eos> I learned that lesson the night the Colts beat the Giants.<eos> '58 Championship, greatest game ever played, and I didn't see a single snap.<eos> I was hooked up to machines at St. Peter's.<eos> To this day, I don't blame them.<eos> I don't think they meant to chase me off the roof.<eos> After IBM, I went across the country just looking for answers.<eos> I'd read your article and I couldn't stop thinking about it.
You may continue.<eos> April created a new position for herself, and I wanna do the same.<eos> The town could use more private-sector money after the merger.<eos> So as business liaison, I would find companies looking to move or expand, and convince them to do it in Pawnee.<eos> Now this is a good idea.<eos> You've come a long way, son.<eos> And while I got you here... talking tissue.<eos> Go for it.<eos> [Tom's voice] Yo, dog!<eos> Life is what you make of it.
This is really gonna help the campaign, Mr. Hendrie.<eos> I told you, call me Bruce.<eos> Right.<eos> So sorry.<eos> Thank you, Bruce.<eos> The question is, does he know your first name?<eos> I'm betting that he doesn't.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, Bruce.<eos> You still taking the boat out tomorrow, Leo?<eos> Assuming that your staff remembered to put gas in it this time.
Do I really need to start this entire process right now?<eos> I mean, I feel fine.<eos> I didn't even know I was sick three days ago.<eos> What if I hadn't gone to the blood drive?<eos> I may not have found out about this for months.<eos> Thank God you did, right?<eos> - This is just really bad timing.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> It's never a good time to get that kind of news.<eos> Or to be the one giving it.
If you wanna hook up with someone whose biggest scoop is the impact of skrillex on society, go for it.<eos> What I wanna know is...<eos> Who's Natalie Ortiz?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who is she?<eos> Some girl whose car you took a picture of.<eos> - Why?<eos> - That was in my desk.<eos> Yep, and now it's not.<eos> Natalie Ortiz rented this car two days ago at Logan and returned it today.
Well, it felt like 10.<eos> If I'm not out of there in 15, please press your call button.<eos> There's no way I'm gonna be able to fall asleep in here.<eos> I thought that might happen.<eos> And I came prepared.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Where did you find this?<eos> In the attic.<eos> Remember, dad taught you how to read with that book.<eos> And we would read it to you when you couldn't sleep.
- Louisville.<eos> Right.<eos> I was in Louisville at this public pool that my girlfriend Susannah and I liked to go to.<eos> You remember Susannah, don't you?<eos> Looks like Eleanor Roosevelt?<eos> She was one of my bridesmaids.<eos> So, Susannah and I were splashing around like ninnies, trying to get the boys to notice us, when I realized that I had lost an earring.<eos> It was just some dime-store piece of junk, but I had said that it was real, so I had to make a big show of diving down to the bottom to get it.<eos> And then suddenly a shock wave hits.<eos> A man had jumped into the pool to get it, but all he had succeeded in doing was sending it directly down the drain. Oh.
Were there tears when it happened?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> A 12-year-old girl, she cries when she's being penetrated for the first time.<eos> Were you that 12-year-old girl?<eos> Yes, Hold you.<eos> Then why not say "I"?<eos> "I cried."<eos> Well, I did.<eos> And I've cried plenty in telling the story, maybe not tonight, but I have.<eos> To whom have you told it?
That our mother is an alcoholic?<eos> Who's next, Frank? Me?<eos> Of course.<eos> It took spending time with you to see it.<eos> You mask it better than most, but... You have all the signs.<eos> Mood swings, aggression, impulsive decision-making, chronic lying.<eos> Really?<eos> Who am I lying to, Frank?<eos> Yourself.<eos> We are a family with a shared disease, a corrosive disease, and if you view us through that lens, if each of us is able to address our sickness and treat it...
I know.<eos> I-I mean just...sleep.<eos> When we admitted publicly that the U-2 belonged to us...<eos> Looks like someone worked up an appetite.<eos> I missed lunch.<eos> We were doing something that in a modern world... I swear, slap a beard on him, he's a dead ringer for father time.<eos> Come friday, we'll have a president with a full head of hair.<eos> That's a first in my lifetime.<eos> When I first saw a picture of Jackie, I thought, "Now I know what the american dream is." And John Kennedy?<eos> He is living it.
Well, you're still a connected man, Barton,<eos> Because whatever you did, our film is now officially dead.<eos> I thought you'd look happier about that, Bill.<eos> It was what you wanted, wasn't it?<eos> I mean, why you called me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Your work is better than Kaufman's.<eos> You know that.<eos> You just aren't ready to show it to the world yet.
Don't you see what we have here?<eos> It's worth it.<eos> When can I get it?<eos> Soon.<eos> I want to see it work for myself.<eos> Follow me.<eos> We'll use her.<eos> Have to kill her anyway.<eos> So Anton sells his genius tracking software - to arms dealers.<eos> - Who take it and use it to create a guidance system for a new kind of bullet that can track down anyone wherever they are.
We need these guys' help.<eos> They'll create a diversion on the day of the surgery.<eos> I'm told you have a plan already in place.<eos> We can take down the President of the United States.<eos> Tell me more.<eos> Once the President flatlines, we're going to need five minutes alone with the body.<eos> We need to create a crisis inside the hospital, while you're operating on the President.<eos> I left a bag.<eos> Inside there's a smoke grenade.<eos> Stick it inside the fire extinguisher case closest to the operating room.
I just keep forgetting.<eos> PILAF (chuckles): We all pitched in.<eos> Except for Irene, who's still in Reno at the Ferret Nationals, whatever that is.<eos> I hope everyone realizes how important this party is to Kim, and shows up, and aren't disappointed that it's not on a boat.<eos> Michael and I showed up for my Semester at Sea, and it was moved to a double-wide trailer in a parking lot next to the football stadium because of budget reasons.<eos> It was a wonderful four months.<eos> KIM: Check it out, guys!<eos> A piñata!<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Yes, I made it by hand, and yes, the eyes are inspired by Ginny.
When you gonna tell me what's going on, Ghost?<eos> I ain't no kid.<eos> New phones and shit?<eos> Guessing y'all had a car accident?<eos> We got run off the road.<eos> Your car still running?<eos> Still running, but the repairs might be too expensive to make.<eos> And the other guy's car?<eos> Totaled.<eos> We had to tow it.
New phones and shit?<eos> Guessing y'all had a car accident?<eos> We got run off the road.<eos> Your car still running?<eos> Still running, but the repairs might be too expensive to make.<eos> And the other guy's car?<eos> Totaled.<eos> We had to tow it.<eos> So now it's about the next move.<eos> You take it to the chop shop?
Goodweather, what are you doing to me here?<eos> Just tell me what you have.<eos> I'm just getting into it now.<eos> I haven't finished cutting all of them yet.<eos> Just give me anything you can.<eos> Okay, top of the charts... is here.<eos> Can you see this here?<eos> Yeah, what is that?<eos> It's an incision.<eos> Deep enough to puncture one wall of the carotid artery without rupturing it.
Great.<eos> Mr. Kent, here, can take down your information...<eos> Time is of the essence, Doctor.<eos> It certainly is.<eos> Jim...<eos> Eph...<eos> You have to listen to me.<eos> I have seen this disease before.<eos> I have faced it before.<eos> You... you must contain it.
Is that an option?<eos> 'Cause I can do that.<eos> You need to get a new job.<eos> Someone around here needs to get a new job, and it ain't me.<eos> I'm not sure if I understand...<eos> I'm not sure I want to explain it to you again.<eos> - Dan...<eos> - No, too busy.<eos> Load faster, you asshole.<eos> Gary, get your arm out of my airspace before I shoot it down.
No!<eos> Captain, hey.<eos> You're looking stoic today, like a wise old oak.<eos> I'm not gonna give you more cases so you can win your bet with Santiago.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, right, the bet.<eos> Totally forgot about that.<eos> Well, granted, this friendly competition has led to you and Santiago putting in more hours and arresting more perps, especially this last week.<eos> Up by one, Peralta.<eos> Anything you want to say to your car before you never see it again? Hmm?
They're, like, 0% fat.<eos> Jake, that's not true at all.<eos> It's actually the opposite.<eos> What?<eos> That nut vendor lied to me.<eos> I think a pigeon just flew out of your car.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The windows don't exactly roll up.<eos> The car's a piece of crap.<eos> Why do you love it so much?
Yeah.<eos> The windows don't exactly roll up.<eos> The car's a piece of crap.<eos> Why do you love it so much?<eos> You really want to know?<eos> I was two days out of the academy, super nervous.<eos> Saw this guy run out of a bodega, clutching a bunch of cash.<eos> So I pursued him on foot, 11 blocks.<eos> Finally catch him, cuff him, throw him up against that car.<eos> Turned out there was a for sale sign in the window, and, it being the best day of my life, I bought it.
Okay, thank you, April, for that... wonderful lesson in female empowerment.<eos> Amen!<eos> Amen, but... why are we all holding these plastic champagne flutes?<eos> 'Cause we are about to pop the cork with some bubbly.<eos> But don't worry, this Spumante is virgin.<eos> Probably like you will be for a long time.<eos> Anyways... Will and I want you to raise your glass to celebrate the glee club by singing hands down the best song New Directions! ever did.<eos> Wait a second, the New Directions! never sang<eos> "Raise Your Glass." The Warblers did that.<eos> I was wondering why it didn't annoy me every time I heard it in my head.
But you hid the fact the entire time you were in Glee Club so Mr. Shue would allow you to, quote,<eos> "Park and Bark"?<eos> No comment.<eos> Good.<eos> Last question.<eos> Do you know what song you're going to sing for Mr. Shue's last assignment?<eos> Yes. "Defying Gravity."<eos> What?<eos> ! No, you can't sing that song.<eos> Kurt and I are singing it, but we're switching parts so that I can belt out the high note at the end.
- What is it?<eos> - Don't you remember?<eos> You were going to put a proposition for me?<eos> Was I?<eos> Yes!<eos> And I am still waiting!<eos> The thing is, Floki, I'm not entirely sure I can trust you.<eos> Porunn, you are a free woman now.<eos> What will you do with your freedom?<eos> I will use it to choose.
It's not as lame as it sounds.<eos> We also did physics, so...<eos> Right. So, Mitch, what are you up to these days?<eos> I'm still teaching orchestra.<eos> I'm at this public school up in the Bronx.<eos> It's totally underfunded, a lot of the kids can't afford instruments, but I really...<eos> Take my cello.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, you gotta take it.

Okay.<eos> I just came from the doctor.<eos> Well, not, uh, just.<eos> I've been walking around for a while...<eos> Right, I get it.<eos> Then I headed back to work, and I thought, uh what am I doing?<eos> Well, what did the doctor say?<eos> Well, there's chemo.<eos> You know, I knew that.<eos> Then there's, uh, surgery to remove the radius, replace it with an artificial one, if they... uh, don't have to amputate.
XR2!<eos> XR2i, 16 valve.<eos> 16 valve?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> See, I've gone for the coveted Mk2 eight-valve model.<eos> Eight valve?<eos> Eight valve.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, the comedy stickers.<eos> The thing is, James, what you have to remember is, you know when you look at a car, how has it been treated? Who's owned it?
- Yeah, no, I--<eos> - It's typical of Max that he can't let things go.<eos> So it's irrational, it's frustrating...<eos> - Yeah, no, I know.<eos> - But I just want you to know, don't take it personally.<eos> I mean, you know, to be honest, I did break a promise to him, so- well, that happens.<eos> - Yeah. And he needs to learn how to deal with that.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And I brought you this book on asperger's syndrome.<eos> I don't know if you have time to read it, but it might help understand Max a little bit better, because we really want this to work out here.
We need to find another victim.<eos> Setrakian said he knew where the bodies were going.<eos> Back to their loved ones.<eos> - Emma arnot. Her father.<eos> Jesus...<eos> - We'll bring her to the hospital.<eos> Run some tests.<eos> - Then we'll have video of both redfern and her.<eos> - I'll never get used to this car.<eos> - You know I traded my rolex for it back...
They're shooting at them!<eos> And I'd love nothing more than to shoot back, Pam, but somehow I can't find my gun! Huh. For the love of God, just pull over!<eos> Uh, okay! Cyril, do not stop this bus!<eos> Okay!<eos> Let's just give them Cherlene, that is the very definition of a win-win!<eos> Yes!<eos> Why do you always ruin everything for me?<eos> Why do you always never shut up?<eos> Because where the hell is my gun?<eos> Are you, like, sure you brought it?
So what the hell are you doing here?<eos> I could ask you the same thing.<eos> I could also ask how long you've known he speaks English, but I won't.<eos> You blew this when your people were hunting us.<eos> You saved our lives.<eos> I have to believe there's more like you.<eos> I stabbed you.<eos> And we tortured you.<eos> If the two of us can get along, the maybe there's hope.<eos> Learn from history instead of repeating it, right?
Ladies and gentlemen, we are cleared for takeoff.<eos> We're all gonna die!<eos> We're all gonna die!<eos> During the flight, I'll admit, I-I had a few... difficult moments, but, you know, by the time we'd landed...<eos> Here already.<eos> Well, I have to say, it wasn't so dreadful after all.<eos> Oh, I do apologize if I caused any distress.<eos> And, oh, I'm terribly sorry about the door.<eos> I had no idea it would fly off like that.<eos> Please, please send me a bill, because I'd like to replace it.
He's the man whose DNA was found at the scene of the Magpie's murder.<eos> And Jerome Thomas.<eos> They collaborated on that book, which is used as the introductory text for almost every entry-level course.<eos> Now, Andrew Donnelly's reputation would be ruined if "Dead Clade Walking" were proven correct.<eos> So what do you think would happen to sales of his textbook?<eos> I'm sure they would plummet.<eos> What do you suppose would happen to the reputation of his close associates?<eos> They'd be tainted, too.<eos> What one earth are you two doing?<eos> You found out there was a fossil that could prove "Dead Clade Walking"" and you killed Doug Newberg to get your hands on it.
Shake your belly!<eos> Keep it moving!<eos> Huh. I always wondered how they made sponges.<eos> Somebody need a hole plugged?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> There's a... old tarp in the shed.<eos> Just cover as much of the roof as you can, and I'll get a roofer out here next week.<eos> A roofer? [laughs]<eos> La-di-dah! When did you get so middle-class?<eos> Can you find the leak, cover it with hot tar, and then reshingle?
the use of drones to listen in on communications.<eos> Now, this is all in the development stages, but definitely something DoD would not want to go public.<eos> All right, but is it serious enough that someone from the government would be willing to stage a fake car crash, murder a woman, just to... keep it a secret?<eos> Just because you're not paranoid doesn't mean they're not following you.<eos> In this case, backseat driving.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> One of the files references--<eos> One of the files refers to Wi-Fi technology, which enables a user to hack a car's onboard CPUs-- specifically, after-market black boxes, like the one that was installed in Merchiston's rental car.<eos> So you're saying that they've developed a software that allows you to take control of a car... remotely.<eos> And remotely crash it.
Come on, J-Ju, get your dance on!<eos> I'm doing it, Zeke.<eos> My little tiny dancer.<eos> I got something new for our act... magic rope.<eos> Cool!<eos> A rope!<eos> No, that's not how it works.<eos> Whoo! No... Giddy up, magic cowboy!<eos> Come on!<eos> Look, you're supposed to cut the rope, then restore it.
And I can't live with that.<eos> And the only way I'm not gonna reopen this case is if he passes that test.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll be in room nine.<eos> Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Bates Motel.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Emma.<eos> Would you mind bringing up my book?<eos> I think I left it on the desk in the office.
Okay.<eos> You'll be in room nine.<eos> Let me know if you need anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Bates Motel.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Emma.<eos> Would you mind bringing up my book?<eos> I think I left it on the desk in the office.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, it's right here.<eos> I'll run it up to you.
Mr. Arnot?<eos> Have any of the personal effects of the deceased been returned to the next of kin, by any chance?<eos> What?<eos> What!<eos> When?<eos> OK, I'm on my way.<eos> This thing was on her pillow. When she woke up,<eos> - bit her in the face. - Hm.<eos> I want this rat found and killed.<eos> I'm not here to rehabilitate it.
- Oh, nice.<eos> - That are also super mandatory.<eos> Uh, we can't use Facebook anymore?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Massive time waster.<eos> Kills productivity.<eos> Hey, sanitation.<eos> Listen, let's talk health insurance.<eos> Your dependents don't have it anymore.
Oh. Seriously, that's just for the rehearsal dinner.<eos> That sounds elaborate.<eos> All we did was punch "jewelry store"<eos> into our car GPS.<eos> You remember that romantic moment, Chris?<eos> I was getting gas.<eos> No, I don't remember it.<eos> Hey, Tom, I don't mean to bug you or anything, but I notice that my super system binder is closed.<eos> Just checking that you had a chance to refamiliarize yourself entirely.<eos> Yeah, flipped through it.
We live on a farm.<eos> I saw the doctor on the second day of school.<eos> They didn't find Marla till my friend Andrew's birthday.<eos> Eight months.<eos> And he shipped us off to Winnipeg, then they tell us it's too late, there's nothing that can be done.<eos> And we're supposed to accept that?<eos> So you've come here for a second opinion?<eos> Second, third, sixth.<eos> And then we found your paper.<eos> You can cut it out, Dr. Reid.
So we need to deliver this bad boy "en bloc," in one piece.<eos> Reycraft and I will free it from the intestines.<eos> Then I can extend the incision and use the perispinal muscles as my posterior medial margin.<eos> We'll go in the front door and start clearing house.<eos> Then I'll come in and clean up after you.<eos> And what is my job?<eos> You are our good-luck charm and our muscle.<eos> - Muscle?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Once we lift up the tumor to start cutting, - you can't put it down.
Maggie, you're gonna have to hold that up, too.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I'm feeling some resistance here.<eos> Uh, could be the presacral plexus.<eos> (sighs) I don't know.<eos> I just... I can't...<eos> There.<eos> There is a monster vein heading right into the tumor.<eos> I c...<eos> I can't visualize it without risking tearing it out.
I'm feeling some resistance here.<eos> Uh, could be the presacral plexus.<eos> (sighs) I don't know.<eos> I just... I can't...<eos> There.<eos> There is a monster vein heading right into the tumor.<eos> I c...<eos> I can't visualize it without risking tearing it out.<eos> (Reycraft sighs) All right.<eos> - You're gonna have to cut it.
Why?<eos> I won 500 bucks on a scratch ticket.<eos> I'd throw it in if that would help.<eos> Walter, you know how we've been discussing your self-esteem and how it's easier for you to stay home with Vallenwe'en and take care of her than to go out and how socially, your experience is feeling withdrawn?<eos> Yeah. And I'm gonna work on that, now that Vallenwe'en has a home.<eos> (exhales) Well, actually, Walter, about that, um...<eos> I've got a good feeling about that doctor.<eos> She's a heart doctor, and she is so beautiful.<eos> Walter, wait. Uh...<eos> I gotta say, I love that guinea pig so much, but I can't believe how nice it feels to give it to the doctor who fixed my heart.
Yeah, not my choice.<eos> And you find yourself drawn to dangerous activities?<eos> - Extremes... like skydiving?<eos> - Gotta stay alert.<eos> - Stay strong.<eos> Gotta stay combat ready.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, the key to resolving traumatizing events is remembering them and telling your story over and over.<eos> They're better out than in.<eos> If you knew what my "unresolved issue" was, you wouldn't ask me to relive it.
You got us milling around out there like a bunch of Frenchmen.<eos> Randy, I'm with someone.<eos> I'll wait in line for a Ferris wheel.<eos> I'll wait in line for a beer.<eos> But damned if I'll wait around till 11:45 to get fired by flipping you or flipping Joe MacMillan.<eos> Wait, you're firing me?<eos> I'm being fired?<eos> - Just calm down.<eos> - My reference letter.<eos> And don't worry, I wrote it myself.
I'll order a pizza.<eos> She took my soda.<eos> Nothing like a bubble bath to make you forget life's little traumas.<eos> - Works for me.<eos> - Oh, we also got them a little something.<eos> Oh, you shouldn't have.<eos> "Bowser"?<eos> It's not exactly a bird's name.<eos> Poor thing's dead by now.<eos> I expect you can call it whatever you like.
- Of course, Joseph.<eos> - Joe MacMillan, Loulu.<eos> Travis, Joe MacMillan here.<eos> So, Joseph, where do you hail from?<eos> - Hudson River Valley.<eos> - Oh, I adore that area.<eos> - You get to the city?<eos> - Yes, often.<eos> Travis and I go annually.<eos> He ignores the opera, I sponsor it.
- Let's just go home.<eos> - No.<eos> I know what you're trying to do.<eos> If we go home, the firewall is up, and then you don't have to deal with me anymore.<eos> Instead, fellow employee, I will meet you in the basement conference room at 6:00 P.M., and we will solve this chard issue once and for all.<eos> Don't forget your approval pen.<eos> What?<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> I made it for you last night.
It was so weird...<eos> he was wetting my bread, and then my bread was wet, if you know what I'm saying.<eos> Okay, thank you. I'm finally off bread.<eos> Look, I understand.<eos> You can't always help who you're attracted to.<eos> It's like with me and Nicolas...<eos> This is not the same as you and Frenchie.<eos> I wasn't attracted to Deke before today.<eos> The first time you met Nicolas, your vagina fell on the floor and tried to crawl up his leg.<eos> Yes, but I scooped it up and snapped it back on because I was not born to have sex with a married man.
Um, minimal damage to the clothing.<eos> However, there was a button missing at the top of the trousers, front right-hand side.<eos> And there...<eos> Oh, hang on a second.<eos> Ah, there was also an unusual amount of dust inside the trousers.<eos> Dust?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> The missing button may not mean anything, either.<eos> I'll get Davis to keep an eye out for it.
Hardly qualifies as an affair.<eos> I spent my entire marriage turning a blind eye to this sort of thing.<eos> I just don't want it thrown back in my face in public.<eos> Might there be an angry husband who wanted to hurt Mr Trevorrow?<eos> Maybe.<eos> And what about you, Mrs Trevorrow?<eos> I gave everything to Graham.<eos> People tended to do that, you know?<eos> Now that he's gone, his reputation is all that I have.<eos> Please don't destroy it.
I-I came into my office and she was there.<eos> She knew.<eos> What happened?<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> She ran out onto the landing.<eos> I grabbed her and she toppled over the rail.<eos> But I couldn't hold her.<eos> And Graham Trevorrow?<eos> We found traces of blood on the bat.<eos> Even though you'd cleaned it and oiled it at some point over the last few days.
One day in London, I saw Mr Krupa coming out of a club.<eos> What did I do?<eos> I followed him.<eos> And as he was getting into a taxi, he dropped his handkerchief on the pavement.<eos> And I picked it up and kept it.<eos> In fact, I probably still have it somewhere.<eos> You just wanted something that was his.<eos> Now, this song.<eos> I'm guessing you don't like it.<eos> No, I love it.
And I picked it up and kept it.<eos> In fact, I probably still have it somewhere.<eos> You just wanted something that was his.<eos> Now, this song.<eos> I'm guessing you don't like it.<eos> No, I love it.<eos> It's their best.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I had a look at the record earlier and that's all scratched out.<eos> Well, I told you, I found it outside the pub.
Sticky tape. Why?<eos> Well, because we're out of ideas.<eos> (Sighs) Alright.<eos> You keep up a fair pace. Yes, well, I have to around here.<eos> Oh, cup of tea, Richard?<eos> Lovely. JEAN:<eos> Lucien? In here!<eos> What's through those doors?<eos> It's his mother's room apparently.<eos> He keeps it locked.
Of course it's his real name.<eos> It's my name now.<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> Well, no reason, really.<eos> I'm dreadfully sorry.<eos> Forgive me for asking.<eos> At least now I know what happened to him.<eos> Excuse me. Hmm?<eos> I'm looking for a poem.<eos> I'm not entirely sure who wrote it.
He died a couple of days ago, the police are investigating.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened?<eos> We don't know yet.<eos> But if the cops are involved?<eos> I heard he was at Fromelles.<eos> Yes, that's right.<eos> Bloody terrible, isn't it.<eos> He survives the war and cops it back home in Ballarat.
She was much nicer than I am.<eos> Miss Clasby.<eos> Jean.<eos> Here you are, Agnes.<eos> When are you getting rid of all these tat on the walls?<eos> Tat?<eos> What about your mother's paintings?<eos> Where are they?<eos> You realise the gallery is putting her work into storage?<eos> They bought one solitary painting, then they go and hide it.
No.<eos> We have far more valuable paintings.<eos> So, why steal it?<eos> Mr Baldwin, Dr Lucien Blake.<eos> A little tight of chest?<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's check that pulse of yours to begin with, shall we?<eos> Not much of a gap.<eos> It's obviously big enough.<eos> That's why they took the frame off and passed it out the window.
Agnes Clasby's talking about her, someone tries to steal her painting from the gallery.<eos> And look - I found this in the flat of that girl who was murdered.<eos> That's Agnes Clasby.<eos> Yes.<eos> Isn't that your mother's work?<eos> Certainly appears to be.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> Well... look at you.<eos> - You stole it!
Someone's painted alizarin crimson over that section there.<eos> I think...<eos> I think they may have been trying to hide some damage.<eos> Who?<eos> Virginia Mackay.<eos> She had the very same pigment on her belt buckle.<eos> You think this painting has something to do with her death?<eos> Her boss was complaining about her clumsiness.<eos> So, how does it work?<eos> Her belt buckle catches on the painting, scratching it.

In fact, no-one's been in here for years.<eos> Your mother was a gorgeous girl.<eos> Why don't you take a seat here, Agnes?<eos> I'd like to ask you some questions, if I may?<eos> Did Mother ever mention a painter by the name of David Davies?<eos> All the time - not that your father approved.<eos> He was a jealous man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Did she ever mention anything about a specific painting, one depicting a farmhouse?<eos> He gave it to her.
She lost the painting.<eos> Lost?<eos> Well, apparently, it's fairly easy to lose a painting.<eos> Now, you sat for her while she painted your portrait?<eos> Right here.<eos> You knew what she was doing?<eos> Of course I did!<eos> Michael Tyneman was a philistine.<eos> So was your father.<eos> So she hid the painting where neither of them would ever find it.
Right here.<eos> You knew what she was doing?<eos> Of course I did!<eos> Michael Tyneman was a philistine.<eos> So was your father.<eos> So she hid the painting where neither of them would ever find it.<eos> And good for her, I say!<eos> Your mother was given a painting by a famous artist?<eos> Yes.<eos> And your father sold it to old man Tyneman?
I am just the housekeeper.<eos> Father Morton left that night to meet with a penitent.<eos> That's right.<eos> To be honest, it's been a long time since I...<eos> Anyhow, I can't imagine late-night confessions would be standard practice.<eos> I'd never known anyone to call that late.<eos> And tell me, you worked for Father Morton for a long time?<eos> Yes.<eos> I never really understood the importance of religion before meeting Cyril.<eos> Sometimes it helps to put a face to it.
He's also been shot in both knees.<eos> And here... ..one shot to the back.<eos> Obviously taken by surprise.<eos> But I'll tell you something, Superintendent, he wasn't taken by surprise.<eos> And look here.<eos> I'd say he's raised his hand, trying to shield himself and, again, one shot.<eos> The Dennison family, they... ..they were involved with just about every charity I can think of.<eos> Who would do such a thing?<eos> Are you familiar with the police surgeon brief, Doctor, as per the police handbook?<eos> Yes, I've read it.
I saw my father a week ago.<eos> Mum and the others, not for ages.<eos> What did you discuss with your father?<eos> He told me I was cut out of the will.<eos> I thought he disowned you a long time ago.<eos> He was just making it official.<eos> I thought when he called he wanted to... make things better.<eos> Mr Corrigan, how did you hurt your leg?<eos> It's an old injury.<eos> Yes, but how did you get it?
Ah. Ashby ask why you needed these?<eos> He doesn't know. Hm.<eos> So what's worrying you, Doc?<eos> Lividity, Charlie.<eos> Lividity.<eos> Now, they were at the table.<eos> Someone came in, took them by surprise.<eos> They were reading the newspaper.<eos> Well, the newspaper was on the table.<eos> Whether or not they got around to reading it, I don't know.
Yes. Le Rouge Et Le Noir.<eos> We studied it at school.<eos> Le Rouge Et Le Noir.<eos> It's the story of, um... of a carpenter's son, Julien Sorel.<eos> He rises up through French society in the 19th century.<eos> It's a satire.<eos> Can you think of any reason why that would be of interest to Richard?<eos> No.<eos> And even if it was, he couldn't read French, so the book would have been useless to him.<eos> Then why take it to a party?
Lived together two years before I got pregnant.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. He was so excited he was gonna be a dad.<eos> He brought me strawberry milkshakes every day.<eos> He made you a crib out of leather.<eos> And then, you surprised us a couple of weeks early at a... at a Blue Oyster Cult concert.<eos> My water broke right in the middle of "Don't Fear the Reaper."<eos> - I never liked that song.<eos> - Uh, understandable.<eos> You were stuck in my pelvis the first time you heard it.
My contractions are nine minutes apart!<eos> (groaning) Just go to the bathroom, Gene.<eos> You made it all the way to Sunday.<eos> It's still heroic.<eos> You just don't understand the pageantry of the Super Bowel.<eos> Oh, my God, it's almost kickoff.<eos> Our commercial is gonna air any minute.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> I can't wait to see it, Bobby.
You copied Pesto! What?<eos> !<eos> No!<eos> I did it first!<eos> Pesto copied me!<eos> Cry-baby copycat!<eos> (laughs): Cry-baby copycat!<eos> No!<eos> The commercial with Sandy was my idea!<eos> And Jimmy Pesto stole it!
Yes.<eos> Ow! Come on!<eos> 36 percent!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> None of this ever should have happened.<eos> I-I made a great commercial with my family.<eos> It was funny and cute.<eos> Well, it wasn't that funny, but it was good.<eos> Well, it wasn't that good, but... but it was us.<eos> And I scrapped it to make a commercial I thought would get more customers.
Besides, no offense... they're after bigger game.<eos> Good night, Agent Beeman.<eos> Good night, sir.<eos> Wow.<eos> Wow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's very, um...<eos> Actually, I hated it.<eos> I don't know anything about classical music.<eos> Well, you certainly picked it.
Do you copy?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Just a misfire.<eos> Now stop worrying about me and get back to work, all of you...<eos> And tell raven to hurry her ass up.<eos> All right, that's long enough.<eos> Tie those two ends together.<eos> Get that door open.<eos> All right.<eos> Now get up and toss it over.
Come on.<eos> Dad, seriously, I'm okay.<eos> Why were you not headed to lunch like everyone else?<eos> They left their bags.<eos> I was just trying to do something nice.<eos> You do something nice and you make friends.<eos> Or so I've heard.<eos> Scott. I think I know what she was looking for.<eos> You took the doll from the car?<eos> Yeah, I thought you could use it, you know, for like her scent.
And Tate is out there with a rifle.<eos> I want you to stay out of those woods.<eos> You got that?<eos> Stiles?<eos> - It's the doll.<eos> - Stiles?<eos> It's the doll?<eos> All right, but why would it go all the way to the school and then all the way back to the house just for a doll?<eos> One that was in the car wreck in the first place.<eos> We didn't find it in the coyote den.
No, there was something else I found.<eos> If you somehow offend a nogitsune, it can react pretty badly.<eos> How do you offend a nogitsune?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But if it's doing something this bad, then someone really, really offended it.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Anybody catches the slightest glimpse of Stilinski, you contact the first available teacher.<eos> - Got it!<eos> - Yes, Coach.<eos> There's a card on my desk for Isaac Lahey, and every one of you losers is not only going to sign it, you're going to write a personal message so profound and deep, it's gonna bring a tear to Coach's eye.
She stays.<eos> Do you actually think I was trying to kill you when I bit you?<eos> You were my backup plan, remember?<eos> Not to mention, the bite is what brought out your nascent abilities.<eos> You think power like that was going to come out on its own?<eos> I'm the spark that lit your fire, sweetheart.<eos> You attacked her and nearly killed her.<eos> Power doesn't come without a little pain and struggle.<eos> I didn't ask for it.<eos> But you're embracing it now, aren't you?
Stop.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Hey, look at me.<eos> You should have done your reading, Scott.<eos> See, a nogitsune feeds off chaos, strife and pain.<eos> This morning, you took it from Isaac, then you took it from Coach.<eos> And then from a dying deputy.<eos> All that pain.<eos> You took it all.

- Dad, it's okay.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You're never going to be able to fall asleep.<eos> We...<eos> We got to go back.<eos> It's fine, Dad.<eos> I don't need it.<eos> I can't believe I forgot it.<eos> I mean, every time that we've ever stayed in a hotel, the first thing you pack is your pillow.<eos> You can bring it tomorrow.
It's, um-- it's Giselle.<eos> Giselle's back. Awesome!<eos> Hey.<eos> Look, Mark.<eos> We're, uh, kind of in the middle of something, you know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let me in.<eos> Ok, ok.<eos> We didn't want you to find out this way, but, you know, there's always been that unspoken thing between Giselle and I?<eos> Well, we've been exploring it.
You mean the guard?<eos> No.<eos> Why is that chair moving?<eos> Keep an eye on that group.<eos> What happened to the video?<eos> It's some kind of, uh, interference.<eos> There's a frequency coming through that's just unusual.<eos> Unusual how?<eos> Well it's a frequency that won't be used for decades.<eos> Can you isolate it?
You talk to Marjorie lately?<eos> It scares me, the way your mind works.<eos> - You expecting anybody?<eos> - Nope.<eos> What do you think?<eos> - What do I think of what?<eos> - Your new car.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> No, no.<eos> I got it at a police auction.
Nice girl.<eos> Hard worker.<eos> Well, I'd like to say on behalf of all of us, getting married?<eos> What the hell are you doing, Marty?<eos> Why do you need seven wives?<eos> You can barely get through nine holes of golf!<eos> She's a sweet kid, and I need a little warmth and comfort at the end of the day.<eos> Have you ever considered a nice piece of toast?<eos> Uh, well, I would like to say something.<eos> Uh... I might be in the minority here, but I still believe in love, and it's inspiring to know that even at your age, you can still find it.
- Ordinary?<eos> Ordinary.<eos> Worthless.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Worthless.<eos> - It would be that chair, wouldn't it?<eos> Well, the Tiffany lamps, I saw a Tiffany lamp in a store, in the Kings Road, and I thought, "Oh, it's kind of "a kitschy kind of thing, but it's all right."<eos> And it was like 80 grand or something ludicrous.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> - So you bought it. - They sold a very...
Yes, indeed. And they are a rather wonderful device.<eos> Invented in the 1930s.<eos> You have a disc like this.<eos> You can pull it out, pop it in, and you press a lever and you get a 3-D picture.<eos> And what you have got are the army versions that were used to help members of gunnery crews and various other things to recognise the outlines and shapes of either friendly or enemy aircraft.<eos> - And that is what you will see.<eos> - Thomas the Tank Engine, I have got.<eos> We have given Alan Thomas the Tank Engine.<eos> We thought he would be confused by the aeroplanes.<eos> So what does your card say when you pull it out, Alan?
Do you young people in the audience play Snakes and Ladders?<eos> AUDIENCE MEMBER: No.<eos> That man's taken a survey.<eos> Don't you, of an evening?<eos> That one didn't sound very young.<eos> Is there a Snakes and Ladders app?<eos> No?<eos> Well, while we're in a playful mood, I have one of my knick-knacks to show you.<eos> The great Lord Kelvin in the 1890s was wandering along a beach with a friend called Hugh Blackburn, who was a mathematician.<eos> They found a pebble and a surface on which to spin it and they found it had a peculiar property, not unlike this, which is called a tippe top.
- Tanzania and also Sri Lanka.<eos> - So, that's nutmeg there?<eos> Love that.<eos> And nutmeg is related to mace in which way? What way? How way?<eos> - Cousins. - Well, I think it's that I put mace in my beef stroganoff but not nutmeg, does that work?<eos> Mace and nutmeg are the same plant,<eos> - just different parts of the same plant. - Oh, OK.<eos> - Actually, yeah.<eos> But the one we're talking about is cinnamon.<eos> And the salesman of cinnamon, in order to sell it at the most premium price they could, used to tell of where it came from.
And it's all about to come crashing down unless there's an act of God or something.<eos> Well, I can't do anything about the God part.<eos> But I might have an angle on the, uh,<eos> "or something."<eos> Dr. Breeland?<eos> James Boyd,<eos> Montgomery Press.<eos> Is it true that you're preventing this girl from connecting with her dead father?<eos> What?<eos> I understand that he gave her his practice and you ripped it away from her.

Ripped it away!<eos> And she's gone to extraordinary lengths to get it back, but you're shutting her out.
How about that choir, people?<eos> I thought I saw the box move. Aah!<eos> What can you say about Conrad?<eos> Conrad.<eos> He was a lot of things to a few people.<eos> He was a loud man with strong opinions.<eos> Although I didn't find him attractive, many of our wives did.<eos> He was a good Jew... and even better anti-Semite.<eos> But I never judged, 'cause I thought he had inside information.<eos> Information... there's so much of it out there.
Hey, one question.<eos> Um, where do you think you're gonna stand, in front of the graffiti that says "Pawnee, you suck,"<eos> or "Go home, Eagleton snobs"?<eos> I painted over that graffiti a week ago.<eos> These people are the worst!<eos> I cannot announce a unity concert in front of a picture of a bald eagle giving the middle finger.<eos> Yeah, you probably wanna stand to the side so people can see it.<eos> You know, why do we even have this wall?<eos> We're supposed to be uniting the two towns, and this literally divides them.<eos> - We should just knock it down.
I'm finding it hard to imagine Judge Stone as a killer.<eos> Oh. Easier than imagining her having a sense of humour?<eos> Oh, er, please!<eos> These women hired Carlton, he made them all happy.<eos> How?<eos> Most men struggle to make one woman happy.<eos> Clearly, he was good at his job.<eos> Yes, then there's the mobile.<eos> And the book and...<eos> It makes no sense, I read it from cover to cover.
They did the same thing to me.<eos> Five years ago.<eos> Or was it six?<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I'm you.<eos> Couldn't mix the right serum the way they wanted, so they caged me.<eos> What do you know about this Barnes guy?<eos> He wants to make...<eos> A beast?<eos> That's why they want to make the serum; they want to combine it with beast blood.
Sure.<eos> It's supposed to scare us.<eos> That doesn't work on me.<eos> Hell can't be that bad.<eos> At least it's warm there.<eos> Colonel, we have guests.<eos> Gentlemen, at ease.<eos> Is that how you appreciate punctuality?<eos> We're friends.<eos> Drop the toy, sweetheart, or I'll shove it up your ass and use the silencer.
We need to find this guy.<eos> I think Troy Parker just reached out.<eos> CSI Russell, Jenny Carroll.<eos> Ms. Carroll is in charge of the chess tour.<eos> How do you do?<eos> How can I help you, Ms. Carroll?<eos> We received this package at our reception area an hour ago.<eos> It was sent to our grandmaster- in-residence, Karl Schrute.<eos> Has anyone else touched this besides you?<eos> My assistant and I. He's the one who opened it.
Ripped By mstoll<eos> Ah, very inspirational speech, ma'am.<eos> Oh, come on, you wrote it, you can't review it.
Ripped By mstoll<eos> Ah, very inspirational speech, ma'am.<eos> Oh, come on, you wrote it, you can't review it.<eos> How are you?<eos> I meant that you read it very inspirationally.
It doesn't matter.<eos> - I don't understand what's...<eos> God! Whatever makes me happy?<eos> - It's complicated, isn't it?<eos> - It is, it is.<eos> But my job is to discover how America thinks.<eos> And right now, the public is interested in tax relief for tech firms. Interesting.<eos> Yeah, but they're still deciding.<eos> There is a lot of interest in the Chung torture story.<eos> The public may decide to put it on the Clovis front page after all.
Everything's fine, huh?<eos> We got to get out of here.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Wait, no, I mean, please let her go.<eos> Uh, it's her birthday for...<eos> Anybody else want to be a hero?<eos> Let's go, let's go, move, move, move.<eos> Keep moving, keep moving...<eos> Get behind the tape, move it.
"Sayonara" or "short stuff"!<eos> I would go with "sayonara," short stuff.<eos> That got off quicker than a 12-year-old looking at Megan Fox.<eos> Quick?<eos> I've been trying to get out of this thing for three years.<eos> This zipper is stuck!<eos> This is like a horror movie!<eos> Help me!<eos> Get this damn thing off me!<eos> Tear it off, cut it off, light it on fire!
- All right!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Don't touch my shin every time there's a big play.<eos> - Yeah, no, I got it. Oh, yes!<eos> - Don't touch it every time!
It gets more interesting.<eos> Look at the investigating officer.<eos> This was your father's case.<eos> The collar of his career.<eos> Right before he was killed.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My dad's case notes are sealed.<eos> It's strange.<eos> John, your father was still under investigation for stealing seized robotic tech from the evidence locker and reselling it on the black market.
He's using a modified organic printer.<eos> He can print the skin with bio-ink... skeleton, musculature...<eos> The old bio-printer couldn't print the organs to scale.<eos> A medical examiner would have noticed right away.<eos> That's why he uses straw.<eos> This wasn't the ritualized need of a serial killer, this was a way to hide that the bodies were bio-printed copies.<eos> That means his victims could still be alive.<eos> Your father was the lead investigator at Costa's trial.<eos> If he knew he was putting an innocent man behind bars...<eos> He knew he made a mistake, and he was gonna own up to it.
- OPTION THREE. UGH!<eos> I SHOULD HAVE SEEN THAT COMING.<eos> WELL, STORMFLY AND I ARE GONNA PROVE WE'RE NOT THE PROBLEM BY WORKING WITH YOU.<eos> - [scoffs] NOT AS WELL AS WE'RE GONNA WORK WITH YOU!<eos> RIGHT, HOOKFANG?<eos> - I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT IF I WASN'T SEEING IT<eos> WITH MY OWN TWO EYES.<eos> - I GUESS MY DAD WAS RIGHT.<eos> THEN AGAIN, I DID PUT MY OWN HICCUP SPIN ON IT.<eos> THAT'S WHAT ALL GREAT LEADERS DO, FISHLEGS, THEY TAKE AN IDEA, THEN THEY SHAPE IT.
- Come on, will.i.am!<eos> # Everyone I see just wants to walk with gritted teeth<eos> # But I just stand by and I wait my time<eos> # They say you gotta toe the line<eos> # Want the water not the wine<eos> # When I see the sign I jump on that lightning bolt...<eos> - Come on, Ricky!<eos> - Go on!<eos> # People talking all about fortune<eos> # Do you make it or does it just call you?
You sang the hell out of it.<eos> It's not that you didn't do a good job on it, but it was too much like the original.<eos> There was nothing wrong with it, but it wasn't fresh.<eos> Thanks a lot for your comments, guys, I really appreciate that.<eos> - Well done, John.<eos> To perform in front of the coaches was awesome and obviously to get to speak to all of them and get the advice from them and that's great for me.<eos> I will take that somewhere.<eos> Another style, another sound. It's Melissa.<eos> Today I'm going to be singing an Amy Whitehouse track.<eos> I've listened to it thousands of times over and I really want to do it justice.
We're not gay.<eos> Way to sell it.<eos> ♪ We endlessly creep ♪ What about your girlfriend?<eos> She's not my girlfriend.<eos> What, do I have eye boogers?<eos> We could stop right now if you want.<eos> Aah! What the are you doing?<eos> What the are you doing in my room?<eos> Measuring.<eos> Turns out it's 37 square feet bigger than mine, which means I want it.
- It's not ready.<eos> Since when do you share songs with me when they're ready?<eos> You're JT, I'm Timbaland, we workshop them till they're dope, and then you perform them for your cats.<eos> This one's different.<eos> It's personal.<eos> I'm baring my soul, so I want it to be perfect.<eos> Ooh, is it a power ballad?<eos> Come on, give me a hint.<eos> Nope.<eos> But I promise you'll be the first person to hear it.
Call him and tell him I'll meet him at the lobby bar at 1:00.<eos> What are you doing, arranging a vendor meeting without me?<eos> They were headed back to Tokyo in the morning.<eos> It was now or never.<eos> - Never.<eos> Cancel it.<eos> - What?<eos> No. I don't have time to explain this to you.<eos> - Just cancel it.<eos> - You keep asking me for the moon and I finally get it for you and now you're saying no.
I want it from your nasty place.<eos> - Fuck you. - Ooh.<eos> - Oh, you like it rough.<eos> - Now that's enough.<eos> She's mine.<eos> Now, I'll share her, but only if you treat her with the respect she deserves.<eos> - Jason, come on.<eos> - Yeah, I'm coming.<eos> As I'm sure you can tell, my human friend here is quite special. You will not drink her blood.<eos> You will sip it.
Yeah, not anymore.<eos> He knows exactly what he's doing and why he's doing it.<eos> You just talk to him.<eos> No.<eos> No?<eos> Fuck him if he wants to die.<eos> Who's being a toddler now?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Death is scary.<eos> I've been avoiding it for 1,000 years.

Does that mean my grandma's coming back?<eos> And my dog?<eos> I'm sorry, boys and girls, but there's no question and answer period after story time.<eos> But these are good issues to discuss with your parents in what I'm sure will be an uncomfortable ride home.<eos> Tough crowd.<eos> Who picked this book?<eos> Yeah, but the moral was so sweet.<eos> If you truly love something, it'll never go away.<eos> Oh, that's ludicrous.<eos> I love this library, and they're taking it away.

Have you got Natasha's bank records?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Ha!<eos> There!<eos> 10,000 euros?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why is he so much in debt?<eos> It might be something to do with his life-style.<eos> He wears an elastic band around his wrist, it's a classic addicts' device.<eos> They ping it whenever they get a craving, to remind them they're trying to quit.
Considered.<eos> They plan things.<eos> They're very precise. You just described a murderer.<eos> Maybe Natasha spurned him.<eos> She wasn't interested, she wanted to end it, who knows?<eos> We only have Adam's word they were in love.<eos> Even though they were buying a farm?<eos> Again, we only have his word.<eos> Even if his lawyer confirmed the purchase, she may have still tried to end it.<eos> Maybe decided to buy it on her own?
I suppose people have got over worse, people with less than us, if you want to try?<eos> If Adam had accepted your olive branch at that very moment, you may well have got away with this murder.<eos> But he didn't, did he?<eos> I was with Tash because I didn't want to be with you any more.<eos> I loved her, because I didn't love you. I'm sorry.<eos> And at that very moment, you hatched a new plan, didn't you?<eos> To frame Adam for the murder you committed.<eos> Using the missing key, you let yourself in.<eos> You'd already stolen a bottle from Adam's room, knowing it would have his fingerprints on it.<eos> You emptied it, cleaned it and put the poison in.
- ♪ You're never ♪<eos> Hold that out a little.<eos> - You sound really good. - Thank you.<eos> And you will, too, if you do what I said.<eos> Good morning, sleepyhead. Morning.<eos> I didn't hear you come in last night.<eos> Yeah, the count was off, so we stayed to make sure it was right.<eos> And then y'all woke me up with those beautiful voices. You keep singing like that,<eos> I guarantee you'll get the lead.<eos> The fifth graders never get it.
Is this Louis Vuitton?<eos> This thing costs, like, $1,000.<eos> 2,000.<eos> My husband brought it back from his last business trip.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> That is real love.<eos> It's not about the gift.<eos> It's about the fact that he's thinking of you, and he thinks you're worth the money.<eos> I'm sure Tommy will get you anything you ask for.<eos> Tommy wouldn't know that bag if I hit him in the face with it.
A Mr. Brain Jensen here to see you, sir.<eos> It's Brian.<eos> Not according to this note<eos> I wrote on my hand very quickly: "Brain."<eos> Captain Holt, we recently met at the African-American Gay and Lesbian New York City Policeman's Association.<eos> Yes, that name is quite a mouthful.<eos> Just call it the "AAGLNYCPA."<eos> Your organization has meant so much to me.<eos> Well, it's not my organization.<eos> I mean, I did found it and I've been president for the last 25 years and I oversee every detail, but really, it's our organization.
Probably.<eos> That's great.<eos> All right, let's go over our disguise<eos> I am Herbert Goffleman from San Diego.<eos> I came here to stand in the cold outside the today show, holding a sign with a misspelled word on it.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> You win.<eos> That neon green fanny pack screams, "gullible tourist."<eos> It's mine.<eos> I brought it from home.
We've had things moving about by themselves.<eos> We've had, fluctuations in the power bills.<eos> Now, I'm not sure that qualifies as bulletproof evidence.<eos> But, see, I think that's the thing.<eos> I think that's part of it.<eos> And they do that on purpose so that you don't know if you're imagining it or not.<eos> - Yeah, well.<eos> - Having said all that, there was one incident in particular that I know, beyond a shadow of a doubt, took place in the real world and not in my imagination.<eos> There was one this night, and I was in the basement getting a chicken out of the freezer.<eos> I was just bending over and getting it out, and all of a sudden, I got what I can only describe as an enormous sense of dread.
This watch was handed down from my great-grandfather.<eos> He was the owner of the St. Paul Pioneer Press and Dispatch back in 1914, when he received this watch, and it was handed down to my father and then he gave it to me.<eos> It's a beautiful watch.<eos> It's manufactured by the Patek-Phillipe company of Geneva, Switzerland.<eos> This is a photocopy of the original warranty, depicting some of the complications of this watch.<eos> You let the fire go out.<eos> ...the front of the watch has the hour and minute hand and the second hand.<eos> Kylie, where's that meat loaf?<eos> - I made that for tonight.<eos> - Well, I've eaten it.

No, it's okay.<eos> Do you have the bag I gave you?<eos> Kiran?<eos> Kiran, do you have the bag?<eos> Baba found it.<eos> Kiran, can I...?<eos> I need the bag, please.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Kiran, tell me.<eos> He destroyed it.

That's a good point.<eos> You are not destroying it.<eos> You're gonna bring it to my office, place it on my desk, and you're gonna close the door behind you, - today.<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> And what if Margo found out?<eos> I shot that before she turned me super Christian.<eos> Hey, who's uncomfortable?<eos> Okay, this is great.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll just destroy that tape before anyone important sees it.
Got it.<eos> Small portions.<eos> Thin slice of pie, nothing a la mode.<eos> So, this is the salad bar.<eos> Where's the rest of the all-you-can-eat buffet?<eos> It's an all-you-should-eat buffet.<eos> All the food options are healthy, and the plates are specially designed for portion control.<eos> So it's crappy food that we only get a little of?<eos> Barney, this isn't food.<eos> This is the food they feed to your food before they feed it to you.
What does it fix if I turn off that machine?<eos> You've got a lot of healing to do, and we can't start wrestling with the real issues until you say good-bye.<eos> I don't know if I'm ready for that.<eos> Is it because you're afraid you'll never get the answers you need?<eos> It's because it's my fault.<eos> That's what he told me in the note.<eos> You told everyone he didn't leave a note.<eos> The police...<eos> Me.<eos> Oh, well, he didn't leave it for you.
- I stuck.<eos> And it was so dark.<eos> - Now it is bright, yes?<eos> I get no air.<eos> You Welcome Help me. - But you get ...<eos> Look at me. Now it is bright.<eos> I'll go with you further.<eos> Very slowly.<eos> No Please. I do not get by.<eos> Take my hand and hold it tight.
Anyway, my point is, I've never met a more upstanding, conscientious, and loquacious young woman.<eos> So, you think I'll be okay?<eos> I do. I do. I really do.<eos> But your door is always open, right?<eos> Well, semi-open.<eos> You-- l-limited, uh... office hours.<eos> But, you know, Reverend Timtom is always here, too.<eos> Save some stuff for him.<eos> Okay.<eos> When you borrow my car, put some gas in it!
"Heat" is cold.<eos> "Off" is cold.<eos> Smacking the thing with a hammer-- even more cold.<eos> - Maybe you should call Darrin.<eos> - I did.<eos> He'll be here sometime Friday between 8:00 and 5:00.<eos> Oh, the long window.<eos> I bet that's the first thing they teach him.<eos> How are you doing, Sue?<eos> There was a cousin clothes box out front, and Brick hid it in the laundry room!
We can talk to the consulate in the morning.<eos> Maybe they know something.<eos> Isn't he the head of the consulate?<eos> You know what?<eos> I can pull the front door security video, check for other cameras on the block.<eos> I mean, the guy's pretty brazen.<eos> We might get something.<eos> Anything from the front door?<eos> That video's gone.<eos> The perp must've taken it.
Easy.<eos> That is the reaction for when there's a man behind me with a gun.<eos> All I said is I don't care about wedding dresses.<eos> Because you've never been in one.<eos> I'm gonna pick some for you to try.<eos> Okay, no, no.<eos> No need. Mnh-mnh.<eos> Come on, you'll feel beautiful.<eos> Then you can go back to your... boy clothes.<eos> Hey. I bought this shirt for Luke and I couldn't return it.
Well, it can make you feel kind of crazy.<eos> I understand. I...<eos> But the fastest way to get beat on the battlefield is to let the enemy make you forget who you are.<eos> I had a drill sergeant back in basic training that used to tell us that the true soldier doesn't fight because he hates what's in front of him.<eos> He fights because he loves what's behind him.<eos> Okay.<eos> So what do you do with all the hate?<eos> What do you do...<eos> with all the hate?<eos> I'll tell you what you do with it.
All right, you could say something li.<eos> "I didn't understand that I shouldn't edit those photos "without talking with you.<eos> I thought you would understand exactly what I was thinking."<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> That's great. That's good.<eos> I didn't understand, and then the--say the first part again.<eos> Just slow.<eos> How good is this?<eos> You know, the best part is, this pizza place is, like, two blocks down, so we can order it anytime.
Look at this! All those teeny, tiny, little seeds that you planted are big, beautiful, tasty vegetables now.<eos> Look.<eos> Where did these come form?<eos> - These weren't here yesterday.<eos> - Well- oh, they've been here for-- they've been growing over the last month.<eos> This is all-- this is all your stuff.<eos> All right, let's pluck some vegetables.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Where did the corn come from, daddy?<eos> We plucked it yesterday.

What, you mean that little bit?<eos> It's in the freezer.<eos> Oh, hello.<eos> What are you doing home?<eos> Adam had a work meeting, so I decided to come home.<eos> What are you painting?<eos> That little bedroom upstairs.<eos> Lilac.<eos> By that little bedroom, you mean my-- my little bedroom?<eos> You're painting it lilac?
No!<eos> No!<eos> No, this is my mom.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> That was hardly subtle.<eos> - That's Verrat.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Where's your car?<eos> - Downstairs, parking garage.<eos> Get it, meet us out front, and follow me.
Ridley? I can't find Ripley.<eos> We'll have to go. I'm so sorry.<eos> We'll have to go.<eos> Ripley?<eos> Stay there.<eos> What shall we do?<eos> !<eos> We switch the desk. What?<eos> !<eos> We take everything off, turn it round, and then it's done.
Who are Burwick Trading?<eos> They're a local company with no apparent income, no head office, no staff - but they do have one owner.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Jacob Doran - our recently-deceased Minister for Commerce.<eos> It looks like he's been illegally importing goods from South Africa.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> Great work, guys.<eos> What's he importing?<eos> We don't know, sir, but the next delivery to Burwick Trading arrives in port today.<eos> And when we impound it, we'll finally find out what this case is really all about.
Flash him the dog, will ya?<eos> - Are you kidding me? - Make him see that you're, you know...<eos> That I'm what?<eos> That I'm with an idiot?<eos> I'll see you around the Dog Park, jackass.<eos> Mel, it's Karee...<eos> With dad out of the apartment, Katie finally got to hang out with the guy of her dreams...<eos> - Was this your card?<eos> - No. Who was a complete nightmare.<eos> Guess I must've... Ate it.
Hey, that's my agent.<eos> If I got the part, it's still the second best thing<eos> I've heard all day. Hello?<eos> Am I a terrible person?<eos> No.<eos> No, it was a mistake.<eos> Am I a terrible person that it crossed my mind that she might die and never see the card?<eos> Now I think you're flirting with the line.<eos> Good news?<eos> No, I didn't get it.
- Exactly.<eos> Positronic charges.<eos> They scramble arkbrains.<eos> These things should knock those doomsday cultists on their asses long enough for us to get Irisa clear.<eos> You can't have an apocalypse without your key horseman.<eos> What are these for?<eos> I'd put those down and wash your hands.<eos> Ah. A-ha. Memory card.<eos> See what's on it.<eos> I'll take it to the workshop.
Did you threaten him physically?<eos> Ok, I went in, I knocked, I called out and I went in.<eos> He was hiding in the wardrobe.<eos> He ran.<eos> I didn't make him run.<eos> And what about the jacket?<eos> Where did he get the jacket?<eos> Mr lanagas doesn't remember a jacket.<eos> Well, then, he's lying.<eos> I'm sorry, he must have hid it.
What's going on?<eos> We need the head.<eos> He's back?<eos> And he's taken Crane's wife.<eos> The witch?<eos> How did she get out of purgatory?<eos> That's part of the problem.<eos> And why things may go from bad to worse.<eos> But the head?<eos> We're gonna use it against him.
Perhaps you and I have more in common than you think.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I want the machine to be free.<eos> You wanna control it.<eos> I won't bore you with academic theories about competing civilizations.<eos> It's human nature to want to control the means to wealth, hmm?<eos> Whether it be salt or gold or oil.<eos> Or information.<eos> It is the new currency.<eos> And if someone's gonna control it, it might as well be you?
He's a kid.<eos> He doesn't know what he wants.<eos> He doesn't get it.<eos> He's not a kid anymore, Kristina.<eos> He's a teenager.<eos> He is a kid.<eos> [Sighs] I think he just wants some more independence.<eos> We gave him that radius at the beginning of the year, which, for the most part, worked out really well.<eos> I think he just wants a little more.<eos> I say we give it to him.
Just don't--don't cry, 'cause...<eos> The work that you did... Was phenomenal.<eos> You should be proud of it.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> So, no matter what happens, just know that.<eos> ♪ 'cause you say that you do ♪ Don't even think about putting that guitar down.<eos> You're embarrassing.<eos> Drew, you have to play me that song right now.<eos> - I'm not playing you anything.<eos> - It's been in my head ever since I heard it the other day.

But what I've been through today, standing here and seeing you two there so... - soft...<eos> I'm set free of my anger. - Uh, okay!<eos> I ain't gonna lie to you. Dewey Crowe's future ain't what it once was.<eos> - I'm leaving.<eos> - Again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm here for my necklace and my turtle dog.<eos> Oh. The ... the turtle thing?<eos> I think I have it.<eos> Where do I have it?

I don't think that concerns you.<eos> Oh, my God, is this some of the money you stole?<eos> No, that's money I earned.<eos> But the Feds will take it if they know I have it.<eos> How'd you earn it?<eos> Selling Mary Kay cosmetics.<eos> Now... are you still good for being my character witness in court tomorrow?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure.<eos> Should I bring the box of stolen money with me?<eos> No. You can leave it and the sarcasm at home.
I've lost control of my squad.<eos> Should we turn some lights on?<eos> Trying to save electricity, Gina.<eos> Your massage chair is on.<eos> Yeah, I'm poor.<eos> I'm not a savage.<eos> Man, what am I gonna do?<eos> Well, what if I bought the apartment?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> And then I could rent it to you till you find a new place.
"Whoa"?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> What's it look like?<eos> In my bed?<eos> What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Jerk.<eos> Bitch.<eos> Get a room, you two.<eos> Had a room till you two soiled it.
Not to mention, you have your facts wrong.<eos> You said Peter was wearing his wire when he was killed.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible.<eos> So you knew about the wire?<eos> You admit you were in on it with him.<eos> Jamie.<eos> It's not illegal to know.<eos> And I guarantee you you will never link me to that payment, so you'll never be able to prove witness tampering.<eos> But, yeah, I knew about the wire.<eos> And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed because he had already left it for the feds at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.

- Don't lie to me!<eos> Yeah, well, the plane just turned around, for god's sake!<eos> How is this happening, then?<eos> H.Q. can override automated control of the avionics, take us anywhere they want.<eos> Let me check the instrument panel, and I'll be able ...<eos> - No way!<eos> - You're not going anywhere till you explain what ...<eos> It's not me!<eos> Why did you have an encrypted hard line?<eos> And try to shoot me when we found it?
By tomorrow morning, there'll be 100 more.<eos> And you want me to slow down?<eos> Of course not.<eos> We've spent six months in the woodshed living off table scraps.<eos> We both know our design is better than Akley's.<eos> But if you go in there to persuade Oppenheimer half-cocked, it's finished.<eos> Was that Frank Winter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I submitted my thesis to the Princeton physics journal when he was the editor.<eos> Six peer reviewers backed it for publication.
We can cut 12 weeks off Akley's timeline.<eos> I thought we were going to the airport.<eos> Lamy train depot.<eos> General's seen fit to ground me.<eos> It's too dangerous to fly.<eos> Isn't that right, Tommy?<eos> It's very touching, their concern for my health.<eos> It's been road-tested and triple-checked, Robert.<eos> If you'll just give me some IBM machines and 30 more men, I can have the hydrodynamics worked out in the next month.<eos> This country, the Valles Caldera, we call it a desert, but it's a crematorium.
All right.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> All right, here.<eos> Hold that there.<eos> That.<eos> Now, you got to hit it hard.<eos> This just... it... this feels wrong.<eos> No, hey, look, I told you the bone is misaligned, all right, so we have to complete the break before we can put it back together.
Yeah. Auto shop called after the broadcast.<eos> Driver's side's pretty banged up.<eos> Car's been in the shop for a month.<eos> Obviously hasn't been repaired yet.<eos> A month?<eos> You know, we keep running into this four-week wall.<eos> It's like life just stopped for that entire family in an instant.<eos> Yeah. The mechanic called the Conners with the estimate.<eos> Never heard back, so he put the car on hold.<eos> Hasn't touched it.
Here we go.<eos> Yeah, it's...<eos> Just gonna put this on here.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh, this is my long shirt.<eos> Yeah. Oh.<eos> That's why you're laughing.<eos> I had it on the wrong way.<eos> That must have been funny-looking the way it was.<eos> I've never broken it out before you because, you know, we didn't live together, but... it keeps the top really warm and lets my bottom breathe.
I had to.<eos> Also I had a banana on the way over here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I get why you don't want any more to know about Duke Silver, and you don't have to worry.<eos> You secret is safe with me.<eos> To even it out, I'm gonna tell you all of my secrets.<eos> Oh, no, that's not necessary.<eos> I once forgot to brush my teeth for five weeks.<eos> I didn't actually sell my last car.<eos> I just forgot where I parked it.
All right, well, I'm gonna go confuse everyone on Facebook with a, "So sad, terrible day" status and nothing more.<eos> Your mother was a good woman, Peter.<eos> Thanks, Lois.<eos> I just, I just can't believe she's really gone.<eos> And I can't believe this funeral home has a skylight with a sinister clown staring down at us.<eos> Thank you for coming, everyone.<eos> We're here to celebrate the life of Thelma Griffin.<eos> Here to say a few words about Thelma is her son, Peter.<eos> My mother always hoped to be buried with her pet cat, Mittens, so I'd like to thank the Quahog Veterinary Society for putting Mittens down so quickly.<eos> Yeah, just-just go ahead and toss it in there.

Everyone gets what they want.<eos> We all walk out of here alive.<eos> Sorry, pal.<eos> For what it's worth, you were never getting out of here alive.<eos> [Distant gunshots]<eos> Kara?<eos> [Gunshots stop]<eos> I'm fine, John.<eos> [Body thuds]<eos> Caught a little grief from the suicide squad, so I had to give it right back.
- Why is turning that way?<eos> - Can you stop it from turning... - I don't know...<eos> - that way, please?<eos> - Don't!<eos> - I'm going to topple off of the bed, Didi.<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> The thing is stuck, Dawn.<eos> - Why is it stuck?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Get your finger off of it, that's what's stuck.
I would, but I'd also like to keep my job.<eos> - Execs at this level...<eos> - Four, please.<eos> ...they want to hear what they want to hear.<eos> Eight, please.<eos> They asked us to present the report, so that's what we're gonna do.<eos> We can play dress-up and then play Cabbage Patch.<eos> A dance party.<eos> Mommy left lasagna in the freezer.<eos> We could put it in the oven and then play Cabbage Patch.
If you or your men take one step towards us, I will cut your throat.<eos> What you went through must have been insane.<eos> It wasn't all bad...<eos> I had a cold beer, and that was nice.<eos> Did you ever think about it?<eos> About... just... staying?<eos> It wasn't real.<eos> It wasn't you.<eos> What is happening?<eos> The nano were absorbing the power, keeping it off.
By lunchtime, I'll officially be the filthiest bastard on the base.<eos> - The jockstrap of joy will be mines.<eos> - Gleaming.<eos> And Bluestone 42 can celebrate a big win for my balls.<eos> Do you not listen to a word I say?<eos> - Not really, no.<eos> - Eh? Roger that.<eos> Boss! Car approaching from the south!<eos> It's coming in quite fast.<eos> Nah, the ANA cordon will stop It.
I would not say that.<eos> People, hands are a documented infection risk.<eos> Thousands of people are... Are dying of infections.<eos> You know what?<eos> A big problem with that was Howie Mandel, and the whole antibiotic soap of it all.<eos> He wouldn't even touch his shoelaces because he thought they had germs.<eos> The man never even ate at a buffet.<eos> - He didn't want to touch nothing.<eos> - And another problem is once you wash, you have to open the door by the unsavory handle.<eos> I push it open with my backside.
Callie, come on. We got to go.<eos> Well, we said we'd each do a box a day.<eos> I'm doing mine, so come do yours.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Sophia's ready to go.<eos> Come on... it'll just take a minute.<eos> - Callie...<eos> - Unpack this box!<eos> You know, the whole world is not going to end if I don't open this box...<eos> Open it.
It's Leonard and Carlton!<eos> You blokes want to join me for one last bit o' noggin' bogging'?<eos> I saved your bowlers.<eos> Hmm? Once again, the glugs was hittin' the streets all slow-motion like-- and just as scarifyin' and intimidato as ever.<eos> Hey, keep up!<eos> We put nasties in a hat and selectoed out one.<eos> Hey, what kind of Whoo-hoo is this?<eos> Welcome to the most frustrating, befuddling and, yes, erotic book release party you've ever attended.<eos> Sir, are you done with my bird mask?<eos> Oh, I don't think you want to wear it now.
So we're not going every Sunday, then?<eos> Oh! Dad!<eos> I learned a new new trick.<eos> Here -- pick a card.<eos> Not today.<eos> Paige!<eos> Here, pick a card.<eos> Any card.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Put it in anywhere.
You really hate this man?<eos> Oh, I hate religion.<eos> I hate the hypocrisy of it, and that man exemplifies precisely that.<eos> Do you even believe in God, Joe?<eos> Please. Whose God?<eos> Heh heh.<eos> You know, there are over 2,000 gods that the sheep of this world have chosen to believe in.<eos> So, no. I do not believe in any god.<eos> No.<eos> I made that mistake once before, and I'm not about to make it again.
Sheldon, have you ever considered not rushing into something new?<eos> I mean, why don't you take your time, enjoy your freedom?<eos> Maybe something new to study will find you.<eos> That's actually not bad advice.<eos> You know, I didn't seek out string theory.<eos> It just hit me over the head one day.<eos> How does that happen?<eos> A bully chased me through the school library and hit me over the head with the biggest book he could find.<eos> Okay, how about we toast your newfound freedom?<eos> Ah, normally I refrain from alcohol, but since my cerebral cortex is twiddling its proverbial thumbs, why not soak it in grape juice that's been predigested by a fungus?
It's fine.<eos> She looks a lot better in a suit than all you do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> And I ordered my men directly to the second floor, where the witness heard the children.<eos> Lieutenant Casey, I understand you were the first inside.<eos> Can you tell us what happened after you went in?<eos> [Clears throat] Yes.<eos> Three members of my unit, as well as two from Lieutenant Severide's, entered the main floor and proceeded immediately up the stairs to the second floor.<eos> The door was locked, so we had to take it down.
A little bit, and then it'll be over.<eos> I'm a pro.<eos> I'm gonna put this tube into your nose, and then it is going to go up and around and down.<eos> Slather, slather, slather.<eos> Where do you live?<eos> I used to live in Guatemala and Santa Fe, but now I live here with her for the last seven years.<eos> I was actually born in this hospital, 51 years ago this January.<eos> You do not look 51 at all.<eos> Didi.<eos> I'm putting it in. I'm putting it in.
I feel like you tricked me - into getting you pregnant.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> Yeah, I do, and then I feel like you trapped me into that apartment, and I am only speaking my deepest, most inner truth.<eos> You know what?<eos> Eat me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get out of my way, Freddie.<eos> Cones are up.<eos> Stairs are wet.<eos> Patsy: I have to say my truth, because it's my truth and I have to say it!
where you work out how to keep the door with a broken lock shut.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's three main schools of it - you've got the Tom Daley, where you lean forward with the arms like that.<eos> Use the fingertips. Yeah.<eos> But I can't BLEEP unless I'm playing Candy Crush, so that doesn't work.<eos> Then you've got the Bowing Monk, where you put your head forward and just use it as a doorstop.<eos> But someone can, like, knock you out if they're too insistent on getting in.<eos> Then your third option, which is the best one, which you should always use, is the Woman In Labour, where you plant two feet onto the door.<eos> But I committed to this recently in a petrol station just outside of Bolton, and I'd fully committed, but you have to be a master of your surroundings, I didn't realise the door in question opened both ways!<eos> This, like, hairy trucker ripped it off and literally thought I was kind of presenting myself to him!
"Well, who are you trying to kid, love?<eos> "You didn't get to that size by eating salads."<eos> No-one would say anything to you.<eos> Not while I was around.<eos> They might not say it, but they'll think it.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I can see it behind their eyes.<eos> You know, I used to think that I loved food.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I fucking hate it.
Well, she was so well-spoken that I imagine she... was probably too embarrassed to continue trying.<eos> And I think she's mad at me.<eos> I promised her I would visit her one weekend and I couldn't, and she went into her room and stopped talking to me.<eos> And for the most part she stopped eating as well...<eos> Where are we on a feeding tube?<eos> Is that something you would like to discuss?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alright, well, I'm gonna make some notes.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> So she followed around behind me, tottled around with this little plastic tiara on, and she just wouldn't take it off.
Is the parking lot possum back?<eos> Why are you going all Uncle Frank on your bag?<eos> Who's Uncle Frank?<eos> He's my uncle from Tallahassee who had a thing for bludgeoning.<eos> You know, there's a documentary about him on Netflix.<eos> Hey, listen, I felt bad that we laughed at your bag, so I came by to apologize.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You guys were right, man.<eos> This thing's too new.<eos> That's why I'm trying to beat it up a little.
Ugh. Fine.<eos> LOUISE: No... no, no!<eos> TAMMY: Why isn't it falling?<eos> Because of your big mouth, Tammy!<eos> Someone's gotta notice I'm missing.<eos> This is my party.<eos> The theme is me.<eos> What are you planning to do with this stupid head after today anyway?<eos> Um, hello?<eos> I'm gonna donate it to charity.
I'm so, so sorry.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> You tried.<eos> You-you-you stepped up.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you.<eos> What do you do for a living?<eos> I'm an orthopedic surgeon.<eos> Do you enjoy your work?<eos> I love it.
Quiet!<eos> Please!<eos> I've got about four hours to get through all their research.<eos> Can you please take the party outside?<eos> San Francisco's fogged in.<eos> They've grounded all commercial flights for at least another couple of hours.<eos> Well, he's getting worse.<eos> I don't think that he has that kind of time.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ross will transport the kidney once I take it out, and then you'll join me for the transfer.
Vascular clamp.<eos> When Ellis won, it ate at me.<eos> Didn't make me a better surgeon.<eos> Made me a jealous one.<eos> I'm not jealous!<eos> Okay, I'm jealous.<eos> Happy now?<eos> Therapy's over.<eos> Not enough length on the right renal vein.<eos> We'll need to mobilize it.
♪ Enlist in Vietnam ♪<eos> ♪ Ain't no woman in the world ♪<eos> ♪ As beautiful like my mom ♪<eos> ♪ America ♪<eos> Man, you were in the bathroom forever.<eos> The receptionist said that Chipp will be out in just a second.<eos> Uh, I just need a minute.<eos> I'm going to call Ben about nothing.<eos> My parents make me so mad sometimes.<eos> Just like the time they couldn't decide who gets the dog, so they just dropped it off at a local synagogue.
Bye.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes, fine.<eos> Never better.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Going to the retirement home?<eos> Of course! Of course!<eos> OK, so, the kitchen prepared two room service meals yesterday, both chicken curry.<eos> And Sylvaine took one of them to Judith Musgrove in her room, and the other she delivered to Emma Redding.<eos> Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with the food while she was delivering it, and as at least one other guest had the same meal, it couldn't have been tampered with in the kitchen.
A fresh approach.<eos> Your point being?<eos> We've spent our whole time trying to reach down to the water, so why not make the water reach up to us?<eos> One minute.<eos> Let me open the door for you!<eos> Step away from the door!<eos> Are you OK, sir?<eos> So, two men break down a door - that requires a lot of force.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Don't worry, Camille, neither do I, but we've hit a brick wall and I'm trying to come at it from a different angle.
You can't.<eos> How can you take any trace of the pills out of the curry after it's been eaten?<eos> You can't do that either.<eos> Yet if the only explanation is that someone did, then that's what must have happened.<eos> He must be still drunk.<eos> I heard that, Dwayne.<eos> Unless it's different.<eos> What if the door isn't the door, or at least not the door that we thought it was?<eos> What if the curry wasn't the curry?<eos> 'Sylvaine doesn't think anyone could have tampered with her food whilst she was delivering it.'
And you already had her key, so you could let yourself in.<eos> You then made sure you left Emma's empty packet of sleeping pills at her side, and a glass of water.<eos> It was then the work of a moment to replace the incriminating curry with the plate you brought.<eos> And now the scene was set for the final part of the illusion.<eos> You were going to get out of a locked room.<eos> All it took was a little re-enactment to realise how you did it.<eos> See, first you opened the latch lock, but made sure the steel bolt was closed.<eos> It wouldn't have been too hard to break the bolt, not for someone who was already prepared to commit murder.<eos> But then, having smashed only one of the locks, you left, using the other lock to secure the door.<eos> You then placed the plate of poisoned curry on a tray outside your own room, knowing that Sylvaine would carry it away later.
Hey, deetmore.<eos> If you're gonna bag evidence like a five-year-old, You should have the proper tools.<eos> It's a "my first police kit."<eos> The walkie-talkie blows bubbles.<eos> Hope you can handle it.<eos> He mislabeled the weapon, like an idiot.<eos> And it almost got filed with the wrong case.<eos> You humiliated officer deetmore in front of his peers.<eos> He submitted an official complaint against you.<eos> Did he fill it out in crayon?
- Hey, Nick, what's up, man?<eos> - What's up, Winnie?<eos> - Hey, Nick.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Can we talk for a second?<eos> - Can I talk to you?<eos> Schmidt fired me, and now I'll never get to use this briefcase I just bought, and it was $19!<eos> - I think my thing is a little bit more...<eos> - Do you think I'm sexier when I hold it or when it's down?<eos> 'Cause I think it's kind of sexier when I hold it, like this.
- Coolidge!<eos> - Too late, man.<eos> It's too late.<eos> All right, guys, get out there and make me proud!<eos> - Ms. Day?<eos> - What?<eos> What is going on?<eos> I thought you fired Coach.<eos> Look, Coach loves the kids, and the kids love him.<eos> I want this job, but I'm not going to do it your way.
I can't get over HP's touch screen.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Yeah, it's a fad... - Oh, look, look, look.<eos> - ...guaranteed.<eos> High-density floppy disks.<eos> Oh, someone's hot.<eos> - Let's check it out.<eos> - Why?<eos> They'll be down at our booth in, like, 60 seconds.<eos> And so I ask you, what is the point of a revolution if you have to sell your car to afford it?
We're supposed to be partners in this shit, 50-50.<eos> You trust me, right?<eos> You and me were sure it was Anibal.<eos> And then you and me were sure it was Ruiz.<eos> See, Tommy, the problem is, we can't be wrong again.<eos> I'm not wrong.<eos> Not this fucking club or any other bullshit that's been a distraction from what we're doing.<eos> This is gonna happen, one way or another.<eos> One way or another.<eos> If you don't want a war, there's only one way to stop it.
Come with me.<eos> We shall find you something to eat, something to wear that's a bit more...<eos> Well, a bit more.<eos> Well, what about him?<eos> I can fend for myself.<eos> No, you're hurt.<eos> He was shot yesterday.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> I bandaged his shoulder, but I wasn't able to clean it or dress it properly.
"What ails her?"<eos> Oh. Who knows?<eos> Come on, anything can happen.<eos> We can push him down the stairs!<eos> Hey. Thanks for coming to hang out.<eos> No problem.<eos> How's your mom feeling?<eos> Okay, but she'd feel better if she took her medicine.<eos> You know, when Cinnamon won't take her medicine, I hide it in a piece of cheese.<eos> Good idea. We can wrap the pill in cheese, feed it to Cinnamon, and then my mom can eat Cinnamon.
Not just for him, but for... most anybody, really.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> What is that, polenta?<eos> Amy, get out.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> Hey, Sheldon.<eos> What happened?<eos> I was cooking in the back room last night and the hot plate caught on fire.<eos> And you couldn't put it out?
We want some answers, Jerry.<eos> What were you doing at the boatyard?<eos> I go there to think sometimes.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Nobody goes somewhere to think.<eos> - Where's the boat?<eos> - What boat?<eos> - Bobby's boat.<eos> - I don't have Bobby's boat.<eos> - So you sold it?

Gumshoe.<eos> Man, Jerry's right.<eos> These crab cakes are great!<eos> Okay, we may have taken this a step too far.<eos> We don't even know if the boat was really stolen.<eos> [ Muffled ] But-- [ Cellphone rings, beeps ]<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah, sure, I can put you on speakerphone.<eos> [ Altered deep voice ] I have your boat.<eos> If you ever want to see it again, come to the boatyard at 10:00 AM tomorrow.
- Uh, Big Daddy Cool, Smooth Dyn--<eos> - Ain't gonna happen.<eos> Okay.<eos> My boat!<eos> It's back!<eos> My boat!<eos> Yo! I missed you, Boat Travis!<eos> Ooh, are you, okay?<eos> Mwah! Did they hurt you?<eos> Jules: They just brought it back?
Well, he didn't drive all the way here without it, so it has to be here somewhere.<eos> When he told you about it, he was trying to get out of bed, like he was gonna show you where it was.<eos> It wouldn't be in that hospital room.<eos> He never got out of the bed.<eos> Maybe he wasn't trying to get up.<eos> - He was asking for his cane.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> He's had this forever.<eos> He got it from his dad, who got it from his dad.<eos> - Did I break it?
We're in the middle of a crisis, Mom.<eos> Hope's goldfish died.<eos> That's not a crisis.<eos> A crisis is when they move your favorite show to Friday night.<eos> Now I don't know whether Booth and Bones are still boning on Bones.<eos> Or when your granddaughter swallows a marble and you go to the hospital, and then you realize you forgot to VCR your favorite show. Bones.<eos> Wait, did that actually happen to Hope?<eos> Don't change the subject.<eos> So about this dead fish, here's what you do:<eos> don't tell Hope and just replace it with one that looks exactly the same.
She's not dead!<eos> Very well.<eos> If you're right, we'll find an empty grave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I buried her body just over this next rise.<eos> Marked her grave.<eos> Planted a small patch of flowers.<eos> These flowers of yours, they weren't lavender by any chance, were they?<eos> How can Kenya Rosewater possibly be alive?<eos> You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.
You assured me she'd been killed when the Votanis Collective raided my facility and burned it to the ground.<eos> I was told there were no survivors.<eos> Obviously, someone recognized her value as a hostage.<eos> I couldn't have predicted this.<eos> All the same, you better fix it.<eos> There's nothing to fix.<eos> Right now, we need to focus on not getting caught.<eos> I refuse to accept that.<eos> You need to stop thinking like a human and accept what is real.<eos> If Joshua Nolan figures out what you did to Amanda, he will take his great big gun and stuff it in your mouth and pull the trigger, evacuating the contents of your sick little head.
His people are conquerors.<eos> Alak does not want to conquer me.<eos> Well, not personally, no. But it's a struggle against his DNA.<eos> Castithans are better suited for survival than humans and they know it.<eos> They are the next draft of dominant life on Earth.<eos> Yet, how frustrating it must be for these elegant, streamlined creatures that grotesque humanity stubbornly endures.<eos> Well, this is our planet.<eos> A human planet. We were here first.<eos> Well, ask the Irathients how that argument worked out for them.<eos> The Castis conquered their home planet and renamed it "Casti."
I'm sleeping.<eos> I want you awake.<eos> Today is a special day.<eos> What's so great about it?<eos> Open your eyes and find out.<eos> You know, someone could get ahold of that footage.<eos> And do what?<eos> No more Internet.<eos> Let's enjoy it.<eos> Your boss could see it.
- Yes. - Leslie is a spy.<eos> - No.<eos> Tom has something wrong with his butt.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - What?<eos> Did you hear that? They need an encore.<eos> Honey, they want--the kids want an encore, I'm sorry.<eos> What song should we do?<eos> You wanna do Toots?<eos> I hope you don't mind, but I noticed that your right rear tire was a little flat, so I patched it, and I inflated it for you.
What the hell?<eos> They're playing Cones of Dunshire.<eos> Hey, you invented that game.<eos> Are they playing any games I invented?<eos> Are they throwing dirt into a fan?<eos> The key is, you have to throw the dirt - into the back of the fan.<eos> - How the hell did they...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How did you guys get your hands on this game?<eos> Someone sent it to us.
- Yes, yes I was.<eos> Why?<eos> - No reason.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> Apparently, and I don't know how, but the game has spread.<eos> I mean, it's all over the Internet...<eos> Austin, Charlotte, San Diego.<eos> I mean, people are playing with my Cones, babe.<eos> That's great.<eos> I'm just bummed I never copyrighted it.
Last chance, Ron.<eos> The slots are finalized, but I can squeeze in ten minutes if a certain mister...<eos> Duke Silver wanted to come out.<eos> Come on, Ron, it's gonna be so fun.<eos> Thank you, Andrew, but fun or not, playing music is something I like to keep private, along with my family, my conversations, and my whereabouts at all times.<eos> Okay, everyone, welcome to the very last Unity concert planning meeting.<eos> Andy, you are in charge.<eos> This is your show.<eos> Take it away.<eos> Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to accept the following missions.

No, I didn't.<eos> And you are blocked.<eos> ♪ La-la-la-la-la-la-la- la-la-la-la-la-la-la. ♪ A nice thick layer of chocolate squares make up the base.<eos> A couple of handfuls of crushed pretzels.<eos> Top it all off with marshmallows, and...<eos> Whoa! Voila!<eos> Teddy Brulee.<eos> Finally, arson and food together!<eos> Hey, Teddy, can I play with that blowtorch?<eos> I just want to inspect it, you know, learn about it.
I'm not sure. I just woke up.<eos> ...work that is extremely difficult.<eos> ...rock formations...<eos> The bark beetle carries the wood to its nest on the way to Kessel.<eos> He shoots, he scores!<eos> Gophers are playing.<eos> If that's what you wanna watch.<eos> Forcing a turnover and the assist to Kessel.<eos> Ben Schmidt says you put down a guy with an assault rifle.<eos> Well, he was pointing it at me.
I need to see you, Mick.<eos> It's important.<eos> Honey, I don't want you to see me living like this.<eos> I don't care.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Look, if Pop and Sully had ever met, I'm sure I'd have known about it.<eos> Sounds like you two are close.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He's my father.<eos> Well, if there's any way I could talk to him, even if there's one Sully story, I'd like to hear it.
Check every shelf in that house for a wooden box.<eos> What's in the box?<eos> The answer to this case.<eos> So I had Blake search that house for that ice pick in a box, and then I presented that box to you.<eos> Is that coming back to you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We found it in Joe's bedroom.
Tell them when you're ready.<eos> Don't do it for me.<eos> Do it for yourself.<eos> See?<eos> You are my super-awesome best friend.<eos> My homework packet is not where it usually is.<eos> Max, get out!<eos> And the only thing that's changed is that you're home.<eos> Get out!<eos> So the only thing I can assume is that you or Lauren moved it.
Well, it's good to see you.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> - All right, have a--<eos> - Have a--oh. Ah, jinx.<eos> Bye, Mr. mark. What the...<eos> What's going on here, slinky robe?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Got a little- that's my favorite robe.<eos> - I know. That's why I wore it.
It's not eharmony.<eos> It's children.<eos> Play a game with them.<eos> I'm not doing it. - Drew, you're doing it.<eos> 4:00.<eos> - Beautiful framing job.<eos> - Yeah, there you go.<eos> - I love it.<eos> - I don't know. Hanging a picture of a brochure is a little weird, but all right.<eos> Don't call it a brochure.
Oh, no, no, no.<eos> No, it can't be.<eos> I mean, it's too late.<eos> I mean, because I drove up here from Berkeley, California 'cause, you know,<eos> Paulie and I had agreed on a price and talked about it- well, this is not Paulie's place!<eos> Do you see Paulie's name anywhere up there?<eos> No, it says, "Ernie's salvage yard."<eos> Okay, we're getting off to a bad start.<eos> Maybe we could just look at the grill.<eos> You might not even want it.

She's really good.<eos> I'm glad you've still got pink hair.<eos> I'd miss that if you had dyed it another colour.<eos> - It's not going to happen.<eos> - Pink, pink!<eos> What song have you picked?<eos> I've chosen to do I Love Rock'n'Roll by Joan Jett amp; The Blackhearts.<eos> Ah! I love that song.<eos> Everybody knows it as this hardcore rock, you know, anthem.<eos> I thought, "I want to strip it back and turn it into a Melissa song."
The security guard is a liar.<eos> You know why we're in here, Todd?<eos> 'Cause the only real thing about your story is a severed human hand.<eos> Whose hand is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You killed somebody.<eos> You took their hand to fake a story, to make yourself look like a hero.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't hurt anyone.<eos> He gave it to me.

I've got one living in my closet.<eos> You people can believe whatever you want.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Apparently she's also stopped believing in cleaning up her own messes.<eos> ♪ Whoo!<eos> ♪ Here we go, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh! ♪<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Huh? Nothing.<eos> You're not trying to put that stupid pigurine back together, are you?<eos> Well, I was hoping when you cooled off, you might want it again.

Nothing.<eos> You're not trying to put that stupid pigurine back together, are you?<eos> Well, I was hoping when you cooled off, you might want it again.<eos> I tried to buy you one, but it turns out they're not selling them anymore 'cause apparently they're made out of asbestos.<eos> I tried to fix it, but it's impossible.<eos> Now I see why God never actually made a pig Sasquatch-- it's-it's very time-consuming.<eos> Don't bother trying to fix it.
I can barely see.<eos> I'm wearing giant sunglasses and a girly hat.<eos> Alex and I are having a blast.<eos> But you got the gift, right?<eos> That's what people tell me.<eos> Honey, the bowl.<eos> I have the bowl.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'll-- I'll see you at home.<eos> Hey, here's a thought-- now that you told mom you got the bowl, how about we actually go get it?
Go!<eos> Figured I'd find you out here.<eos> Hey, you saved all those men's lives today.<eos> Unfortunately, the evidence didn't fair so well.<eos> We lost DNA, prints.<eos> All the hardware was incinerated.<eos> Oh. Is that right, D.B.?<eos> Well, yes, Avery, it is.<eos> I found a photo of Susan's house on her phone.<eos> She never posted it to Friend Agenda.

Help!<eos> That's an alarm clock, isn't it?<eos> ! Oh, sorry, James!<eos> The bottom of this river's made out of turds.<eos> I know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Try not to drink more than a pint.<eos> As I was carried away by the current, I noticed that the end of the bridge was now beyond the reach of our cranes.<eos> So when I returned, we built a home-made piledriver.<eos> Mounted it to a home-made barge...
Vicki what's-her-name from Real Housewives of Orange County.<eos> Is that the one with all the face work?<eos> You're gonna have to be more specific.<eos> Welcome, welcome.<eos> Wipe your feet on the way out.<eos> Deke, I'm warning you right now, I am not in a partying mood.<eos> Ain't no party like a Caroline party, 'cause a Caroline party don't start.<eos> I'm heavy with guilt, and that cheese omelet we just split.<eos> We're not partying, but I did snatch back the weed, 'cause I's perfect.<eos> I got it from Earl, and he says it knocks you out so hard, he once used it and faked death to cash in a life insurance policy.
You eschew the electronic age, because if you knew...<eos> Love that word. "Eschew."<eos> [*]<eos> You reject it all, because if you knew how to Google and Skype and tweet and that stuff, you would no longer have an excuse for not facing the truth.<eos> Please don't psychoanalyze the section leader.<eos> Besides, you're one to talk.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, why haven't you opened your card yet?<eos> Hmm?<eos> You should open it.
Rainbow Trout.<eos> One of the biggest ever taken out of the lake.<eos> July 1971.<eos> You remember.<eos> Twenty nine inches, eight and a half pounds.<eos> Wow, what a memory.<eos> Not me, can't remember what I had for breakfast.<eos> But this fish is right here.<eos> Right up there.<eos> I see it every day.

Wow, what a memory.<eos> Not me, can't remember what I had for breakfast.<eos> But this fish is right here.<eos> Right up there.<eos> I see it every day.<eos> You'd remember it, too.<eos> Who caught it?<eos> Is there a name?<eos> Well, there was a name plate on it, fell off back some time around Reagan.<eos> So you don't know who caught it?
I don't know, sir.<eos> We're both off-roading it here.<eos> My internal GPS has been recalculating for a week.<eos> This is Isaac.<eos> He used to be a pusher for the bay Ridge boys.<eos> Dude, drugs don't need pushing.<eos> They push themselves.<eos> People love drugs.<eos> Tell him about the donations.<eos> All right, look, every friday, I put cash into a duffel bag and bring it to Wint community center, room 265, and they mark it down as a charitable donation in their account book.
Sorry to hear about your hand.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It makes it really hard to manipulate my egg sack.<eos> Look.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> I did my Junior year abroad in Tokyo.<eos> And my girlfriend Chiaki?<eos> She broke my heart.<eos> I stared at the paper walls for weeks until my roommates showed me how to vent my feelings.<eos> Take a plate and smash it.
Always the hardest to kick.<eos> I got a "niece" special right over here.<eos> One owner.<eos> Little old lady?<eos> Drove it to church?<eos> To atlantic city, actually.<eos> Back and forth a lot.<eos> She had a gambling problem.<eos> Another bad habit.<eos> Had to sell it for beans.
I don't know how long this stitch is gonna hold.<eos> - pH and bicarb? - Man: 7.0 and 14.<eos> Dr. Yang, now she's oozing from the IVC.<eos> - I see it, Shane.<eos> - Aren't we gonna put in a suture?<eos> If we just keep throwing in stitches, she'll dissect all over the place.<eos> We have to get Frankie off this table.<eos> How?<eos> She's getting a transplant.<eos> In this state, she'll never survive it.
What do we got?<eos> It's cleared out.<eos> Every box.<eos> CSU's dusting for prints.<eos> What about Martinez?<eos> She was shot execution-style, in the back of the head.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> New York Times just ran a piece on the Stapleton case.<eos> I'll get this out momentarily.<eos> Do I want to read it?
Kris and Kim are in Vienna and someone stole Kris's Bottega bag and her Chanel clutch with the matching pumps that she bought in Paris.<eos> All right, well, I have to go take my morning tinkle.<eos> But when I come back, I want you two to be out of here because I need that swing for my exercises.<eos> We have to do this show.<eos> It'll be so great for our business.<eos> The only way we'd get more exposure is if Orlando Bloom and Bieber bitchslapped each other in front of our shop.<eos> Who cares about our business?<eos> I want that mother to adopt me!<eos> Her kid makes a sex tape, she turns it into millions.<eos> The only thing my mother ever did with my sex tape was copy it and give it to her boyfriend.
We should use the money to pay down our debt.<eos> - See?<eos> Mike, I was trying... - Oh. To do something nice for you that you wouldn't do for yourself.<eos> Come on, sit in it.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, sit in it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll sit in it.<eos> No!<eos> Nobody is sitting in this car except Molly to take it back.

No!<eos> Nobody is sitting in this car except Molly to take it back.<eos> I'm not taking it back.<eos> You're taking this back.<eos> Mike, don't be a jerk.<eos> I love you.<eos> Take the damn car.<eos> Molly, I love you, too.<eos> Don't be stupid.<eos> Take it back.
She did in chapter three.<eos> Speed bump!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello, dummy.<eos> What's your problem?<eos> On behalf of every man in this country, I should kick you in the potatoes.<eos> Good luck.<eos> They've already been peeled and mashed.<eos> She wanted to give you a car.<eos> Why couldn't you just take it like a good little husband?
That's the world I want to live in.<eos> Well, if it includes you in a red hat with bare shoulders, I'm going to stay here with my swollen prostate.<eos> So what if you're a little rusty around the edges.<eos> You still got a couple of good years left, don't you, girl?<eos> MOLLY (playfully): Kill me.<eos> Kill me.<eos> That's very funny.<eos> So, how's the old bucket of bolts doing?<eos> If you remember correctly, this bucket of bolts was good enough for you when we first started dating.<eos> No, I hated it from the beginning.
COM-Third-Fleet, this is Talon Five-Five.<eos> Roger, out.<eos> Lord have mercy.<eos> Kill them.<eos> Ali.<eos> Can we get this thing to the surface?<eos> Ah. It took on too much water and the power's out.<eos> Our only hope is a free ascent.<eos> We're not gonna be able to open that hatch till the sub fills with water, the pressure equalizes.<eos> We got to flood it.
Lewis was discovered missing at 8:45 this morning.<eos> But how'd he get out of that ward?<eos> Still don't know.<eos> This nurse was found raped, hanging in the closet.<eos> Still hasn't regained consciousness.<eos> Her cell phone, purse, car keys... all missing.<eos> We have an alert out on her vehicle.<eos> Which is a white camry, New York plates. N-S...<eos> Don't even bother.<eos> He'll ditch it before he escapes Manhattan.
Maybe I misread you.<eos> Unlike dogs, I can't lick your hand and know what's in your heart.<eos> So you'll let us adopt a dog.<eos> Not yet.<eos> In order to get you off the no-dog list, I have to put you through a three-day trial period, but then... you'll be dog owners.<eos> We're so gonna kill it.<eos> Not the dog, we're gonna love it to death.<eos> (laughing): Oh, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... here's what I think, if it's a girl, we should name it Puppy Dogstocking.
It's two days in a row now that girl owes her life to you and that Sam guy.<eos> It's good you made it to the cell in time.<eos> I don't think Joe would've done it.<eos> I'm really glad we didn't have to find out.<eos> Jim will probably tell people he saved your life today.<eos> He didn't have to tell me about that reserve tank. But he did.<eos> Yesterday, we save his life, he can barely utter a thank-you.<eos> I think in some strange way he tried.<eos> A few words does not change the fact that all he cares about is his folklore status.<eos> And he's not the only one fueling it.
No.<eos> I can't afford the gas or insurance.<eos> But I slept in it.<eos> I think the leather is made from clouds.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I'm looking for the guy who bought my Rolls-Royce.<eos> I recently purchased a Rolls.<eos> Perhaps I can help you.<eos> Give me my car back now.<eos> Excuse me, but he bought it fair and square.

Oh, hey, Brian.<eos> And who's your date?<eos> Wow, you must be such a good person to knowingly go out with a herpes-riddled dirtbag.<eos> Ew! I'm sorry, Brian. I-I've got to go.<eos> Damn it, you guys!<eos> Her dad's really rich!<eos> Wow, you weren't kidding.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, you bums!<eos> If you bastards want our booth, you got to go through us to get it.
On behalf of the United States armed forces,<eos> I order you to stand down.<eos> I repeat, stand down.<eos> Colonel Talbot?<eos> There have to be better things for you to do than chase four S.H.I.E.L.D. agents.<eos> I wasn't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra, Coulson.<eos> - I wouldn't push it.<eos> - I'm flattered you came in person.<eos> Fury's private base on North American soil?<eos> I just had to see it for myself.
I wasn't a huge fan before chasing you to the damn tundra, Coulson.<eos> - I wouldn't push it.<eos> - I'm flattered you came in person.<eos> Fury's private base on North American soil?<eos> I just had to see it for myself.<eos> If I come out, will you shoot me?<eos> 'Cause then I won't come out.<eos> Hold your fire, soldiers.<eos> This is one of the most classified facilities on the planet, Colonel.<eos> How the hell did you find it?
What's that for?<eos> Your next lesson.<eos> Your turn.<eos> Stick with me, kid.<eos> In a couple years, you'll shoot better than that.<eos> Something about that woman unnerves me.<eos> It's those eyes.<eos> No, it's what's behind those eyes.<eos> What did she text you about earlier?<eos> She had questions about your decision to pack up the lab and move it to the States.
You have to fight that weakness in you.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now take care of Buddy, and we'll get out of here.<eos> That's not a weakness, is it?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll be at the truck.<eos> Internal battery must have fried.<eos> I'm gonna have to open it up, see if there's a mechanical fix.
He's got a tip on some armored van thing.<eos> Sarge, why aren't we looking into Jin's murder on our own?<eos> For the same reason I told you last time you asked.<eos> They don't want us anywhere near it since we has in our unit, okay?<eos> He was a police officer.<eos> Area central is all over it.<eos> So they had no updates this morning?<eos> The update...<eos> The update is they're coming after my badge!<eos> So when there is another update I will convey it, okay?
And don't call me again until it's done.<eos> And get rid of that car.<eos> Sir, stop where you are.<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> We need to see your I.D.<eos> You the owner of this vehicle?<eos> No, no, it belongs to a friend of mine...<eos> Henry Slocombe.<eos> He loaned it to me for the weekend.
I thought...<eos> I could prove, at least to myself, that I was... more than what they thought.<eos> Idiocy.<eos> Took your time.<eos> Oh, that's the store that Julian Afkhami owns.<eos> The man who Arthur West thought was an Iranian spy.<eos> The same man he thought was corresponding with the mole.<eos> Well, I get why you'd want to surveil it;<eos> what I don't get is why you thought you needed to rent a car.<eos> I didn't rent it.
Let's say he disappeared some other way and someone out there a and this is about revenge.<eos> Okay, or it could be that Alan and Laura were simply witnesses to what happened, and our killer tried to silence them.<eos> Okay, but either way, why wait 25 years?<eos> I got that case file you asked for.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> I was a rookie back then, but I remember the case.<eos> Corey Johnson was a strong swimmer.<eos> The night he disappeared, the surf was calm-- ankle slappers at the most.<eos> Was foul play ever suspected?<eos> There was no evidence to support it at the time.
They must've shaken hands.<eos> That's how she got the chemical on her.<eos> Right.<eos> All right, so where's the film?<eos> She told the owner that she didn't have it on her, and that she would come back later.<eos> He kept the shop open, but she never showed up.<eos> Whatever's on that film got Laura killed.<eos> Okay, but we didn't find any film on her.<eos> Killer could have taken it.<eos> Or maybe Laura was killed before she could get her hands on it.
Hey.<eos> I got you, buddy.<eos> I'm right here.<eos> I got you.<eos> My leg's pinned.<eos> I think I broke a rib.<eos> Where's the other guy? Huh?<eos> He's dead.<eos> Okay, listen to me, this thing's too heavy.<eos> I can't lift it.
Previously on "Manhattan"...<eos> - We're waging a war of ideas.<eos> - You're building an atomic bomb.<eos> We prefer to call it a gadget.
And is there anybody else there?<eos> An immigrant family from Syria who had a horrific time getting to America.<eos> - They're gonna be good to talk to.<eos> - SUE: Ma'am. Ma'am.<eos> Oliveri Systems just withdrew its donations and so has Dugdale Recycling. - Just now.<eos> - (PHONE CHIMES) Yeah, it's out there.<eos> Quincy ran an online piece about the GUMMI code.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - MIKE: No.<eos> You're kidding... DAN: I've got it right here.
I don't know.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Look, I've never entirely trusted your machine, but you built it, and I trust you.<eos> You're the one who said we can't underestimate the threat of Samaritan.<eos> Mr. McCourt, you have to call off your deal with Decima.<eos> Their surveillance program cannot be approved.<eos> What... what are you, one of those privacy nut jobs?<eos> Is that what this is about?<eos> With access to the government's surveillance feeds,<eos> Decima will be able to acquire any information, any secret it desires, and sell it to the highest bidder.
Hold here until the light changes.<eos> The camera angle switches with oncoming traffic.<eos> Come on!<eos> John.<eos> When that light switches, we're screwed!<eos> We can't worry about irrelevant numbers now.<eos> What is it thinking...?<eos> - There's no time!<eos> - This is a life.<eos> And Finch would tell us to save it.
$320, tucked away in a heater vent.<eos> I thought Paw Paw must've put it in there, but when I asked Maw Maw about it, she said "Who's Paw Paw?"<eos> So I think we're good.<eos> Burt, I put that money in there.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> If you found money, you were supposed to buy me a gift.<eos> Does that mean I get the chair?<eos> No, Burt...<eos> I didn't find the money.<eos> I got a raise and I've been hiding the cash 'cause I didn't want you to see it and feel bad.
We... we'd love to drive up there.<eos> Or down there.<eos> Or fly, or sail...<eos> All right, we don't know where Sedona is.<eos> But we'd still love to come stay there.<eos> Yeah, that, uh... that, uh, that would be, uh... great, at some point.<eos> What do you mean, "at some point"?<eos> Well... the condo is, uh... sort of out of my hands, at this point.<eos> And whose hands would the condo that's supposed to pay for Hope's college be in?<eos> The people I sold... it to... t... to pay for this wedding.
[fast tempo acoustic intro playing]<eos> Previously on Reign:<eos> - Is that my husband's child?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just lied to Francis for you!<eos> You made a mistake and now you have to fix it before it destroys my marriage.
If you two didn't live in this building, then we'd drift apart and we'd only see each other on saturdays for coffee.<eos> Well... I'd probably only go once.<eos> Look, just give me 90 seconds.<eos> I mean, he's got a pump.<eos> How hard could it be?<eos> She's amazing.<eos> We should probably get her something for this.<eos> What would be appropriate?<eos> That good candle under the sink?<eos> We've only used it once.
Please, would you take some?<eos> Because I have to get it out of my house.<eos> The lieutenant was a good man.<eos> Smart guy.<eos> Top of his class at Stanford.<eos> He always committed 100% to everything he did.<eos> He like his job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, y-yes, of course he did.<eos> He... he died doing it.
What is the problem, Tim?<eos> That you getting in trouble hits home for me.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, you into the PX's Tor protocols?<eos> Funny that a program developed by the Naval Research Lab now makes hidden Web sites possible.<eos> I wrote a layman's summary for Gibbs.<eos> "There are 500 times as many hidden sites "as there are public ones.<eos> They are called the Deep Web, or Dark Web."<eos> Well, ow Gibbs; he probably wouldn't have read it anyway.
All of our last names are Reagan and we all got careers to worry about, but family comes first.<eos> How's it going, Jamie?<eos> Oh, hey, you guys.<eos> Uh, this is my brother, Danny.<eos> Hey.<eos> Word is your sister's going pretty hard after Cutter.<eos> Can't talk about that.<eos> He's a good cop.<eos> She should cut him some slack.<eos> Hey, how about I buy the next round, okay, and you guys take it back from where you came from?
Plus, living in the state where it happened.<eos> Might make a good story for your next book.<eos> You do have investigative experience.<eos> You know, I was never going to make detective there.<eos> Not after what happened.<eos> Is that your way of telling me you somehow got access to my personnel records?<eos> Jack, look, I just heard about it, thought you might be interested in it as a cop.<eos> This Bill Anderson guy either kills himself in a week or gets caught in 18 months with some waitress in pig's knuckle, Iowa.<eos> Always ends the same.<eos> They have one life to live, and they can't help blowing it.
So does the camera.<eos> Well... you're really hot, so there's that.<eos> There's definitely that.<eos> But I... I love my girlfriend.<eos> The one who doesn't have sex with you?<eos> I-I'm also feeling kind of scared.<eos> Of me?<eos> Well, it's just that this job is really important to me.<eos> It's a dream come true.<eos> I'm just worried that if I don't give you what you want I-I might lose it.
Well, I mean, I know it's gonna come back to haunt my nightmares In a year or two but I'm just gonna make light of it until then.<eos> Nick, seriously, you don't sound OK.<eos> - No, I do have some residual tension. - Mm-hm?<eos> Some...unrelieved residual tension.<eos> - I'm not sure I like where this is going.<eos> - Where do you think this ls going?<eos> I think you're probably going to ask for a handjob... - Mm. - ...<eos> Or something. Before I choose, what's the something?<eos> Do you know I do actually quite like my job?<eos> So I'm not going to throw it away just so I can touch your penis.
Weapons Intelligence ls here. WISWO!<eos> I've come about your special bomb-making friend.<eos> - You've got someone?<eos> Awesome.<eos> - No, actually. - We've had a bit of a setback. - Oh.<eos> We thought we had someone from a partial print, but he was just being paid to stick the things In the ground.<eos> - Ten-dollar Taliban.<eos> - Shit. Then we saw a device with the orange wire here, and Bluestone 44 found another here, completely fucking our location profiling.<eos> So, we've had to widen the search to this area here.<eos> We're referring to it as Area A.
"it comes from the lord, "the maker of heaven and earth.<eos> "he will not let your foot slip. "he who watches over you will not slumber.<eos> Indeed, he..."<eos> Disarm system now.<eos> Disarm system now.<eos> System deactivated.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard the alarm.<eos> I just wanted to make sure it was you.<eos> Oh, thanks for setting it.
Be patient."<eos> That someday, something will click, but it never has, and he just keeps getting sadder and more lost.<eos> The other day, he even looked at me and asked if he had ever been in love, and it just broke my heart, because I think he had.<eos> We are very sorry to have upset him.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It happens a lot.<eos> They say it's part of the healing process, but I just can't help wondering if he'll realize how much he's lost... the music, the girl...<eos> Even the guitar.<eos> What did you say, Rita?<eos> She kept it in a special cabinet.
I know it all happened very quickly, but that's where we are.<eos> Together.<eos> With our secrets.<eos> With our pasts.<eos> I swear, if I believed knowing every single thing about one another could protect us from future troubles, I would tell you every moment of my past.<eos> But... my life... this... wonderful life, began the day you agreed to be my bride.<eos> Then why do I feel afraid?<eos> Because life is full of uncertainty.<eos> That's why we love.<eos> To face it with someone.
- Boston police.<eos> - What the hell's going on?<eos> !<eos> - Are you John Brooks?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm Ralph Comstock.<eos> That's what his license says.<eos> Why are you driving Brooks' car?<eos> We were roommates.<eos> I bought it from him.
I've told him.<eos> It makes absolutely no difference.<eos> Talk to me about the boat.<eos> Well, it was doused in gasoline.<eos> The seawater eventually put out the fire.<eos> But if they took it out at, say, 4:00 a.M. To burn it, How did they get back?<eos> Rear section has marks where a motor might've been.<eos> Could've used that to get back on another boat.<eos> Or could be they just towed it.<eos> Any hint why they burned it?
It has a rare production defect.<eos> It has camel toe.<eos> It has camel toes?<eos> No.<eos> Camel toe.<eos> Oh...<eos> Well, this is ridiculous. She's just a kid.<eos> And I bought that the night before your fifth birthday when your mom remembered we didn't have anything else for you.<eos> I'm going down to that convention and I'm getting that doll back.<eos> Bronconius isn't gonna just give it back, Dad.
- Yeah, yeah, rub it in.<eos> Everything changes. Everything.<eos> - Tough time to be a cyborg.<eos> - Tough time to be anybody.<eos> Here.<eos> This might hurt a little.<eos> I swear that's your favorite part.<eos> My job has its perks.<eos> Hey, whatever happened with that?<eos> You know, I've been trying to fix that thing ever since the day you brought it in.
It's too late, Talos.<eos> Nothing can stop it now. Hull breach verified. I'm on top.<eos> I think I like you.<eos> You're too late.<eos> She's already dead.<eos> No.<eos> But you are.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> That thing is a monster.<eos> No wonder Talos wanted it.
Did you really think it would be so easy to escape us, Mr. Sibley?<eos> There, up ahead!<eos> George?<eos> George?<eos> You're the servant?<eos> Yes, sir, sent by Mrs. Sibley to retrieve her ailing husband.<eos> This is worse than I had feared.<eos> Which is why he needs to be taken to hospital at once.<eos> No.<eos> It is not the injury that troubles me, but how he came by it.
Maybe the Volm can help, okay?<eos> I'll talk to Cochise.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> A hatch door that does not open.<eos> We'll get it open.<eos> We just haven't figured out how yet.<eos> What is that?<eos> Bioelectrical wiring.<eos> We should be able to follow that to a control panel and open it.
How's it looking out there?<eos> Not good.<eos> Poor guy.<eos> He loved that car.<eos> You know you're smiling, right?<eos> I can't help it;<eos> I hate that piece of crap.<eos> Is there any hope?<eos> None.<eos> It's gonna cost two times what it's worth to fix it.
It's tearing us apart!<eos> Why couldn't that whale have pooped three equally sized poops like I do!<eos> This isn't like you, Louise.<eos> You used to be nice, sort of.<eos> If you're gonna sell that thing, then you're doing it alone.<eos> Yes, that's the plan.<eos> That's exactly what I'm doing.<eos> Wh-What are you doing?<eos> You don't walk into a deal just holding the stuff.<eos> You tape it to your back.
From a private residence to a zoological garden.<eos> That's a bloody ridiculous idea.<eos> Well, I think we need a lunch meeting to discuss it, don't you?<eos> Change of use, you say?<eos> It's you again.<eos> Yes. Please.<eos> Frankie can get the forms for you.<eos> Get your husband to fill them out and get them back to us sharpish.<eos> Planning committee meets quarterly, so if he doesn't hit the deadline then he'll have to hold fire for three months.<eos> You can stick that in your pipe and smoke it.
But he'll make a mistake.<eos> Men like him always do.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, it's good as new, son.<eos> I told you, Dad, not to go in there!<eos> It was too much work to fix the small one up in the time we had.<eos> Well, this was all your idea, I suppose, is it?<eos> Excuse me? Eh?<eos> As well as ignoring my telegram.<eos> I didn't ignore it, I ripped the bloody thing up, if you must know.
Doesn't stop him being a slimy devil.<eos> "In formal dining, the fabric of the napkins should be compatible "with the fine, smooth texture of the formal table cloth."<eos> Are you planning a sit-down supper?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I suppose canapes could work for an event like this.<eos> And a clear soup, maybe?<eos> People do like something warming.<eos> Yes, they do, don't they?<eos> What drinks will you be serving?<eos> I would lend you Lord Ainslie's punch bowl but he's a bit touchy about it.
I hadn't heard that.<eos> She hates her because she got a c in Western civ.<eos> She corrects my English.<eos> I went to school in England.<eos> Are we going to walk into school with these?<eos> We'll say they're Sarah's.<eos> Is my purse in your bag?<eos> The senior class sent her flowers because they're all so concerned.<eos> Half of them think her name is Sally.<eos> Shit, I must have left it at the coffee shop.
Did you?<eos> Because there's still a dead girl in Alison's grave that the police...<eos> I don't know who that is. And I had nothing to do with it, and whether you believe me or not, Mom, that is the truth.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm not accusing you of anything right now but poor judgment.<eos> While you were gone, your father and I were dragged down to that precinct.<eos> What?<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> In Philly.<eos> They found your car and impounded it.

Yes, you do.<eos> Why?<eos> How did Carnivore get that story about Will?<eos> - Did you see my byline on it?<eos> - No.<eos> No. 2,000 reporters and he thought he was going to get away with it?<eos> He didn't knock over a bank.<eos> He sang an aria about how messed up the Correspondents' Dinner was, said ACN wasn't going and then showed up.<eos> You weren't aware of the aria until I told you about it.<eos> That story was waiting and ready to go and I'm the one who leaked it.
Will may have been at his best when you were his EP. But I'd remind you that you were at your best when he was your anchor.<eos> I'm offering you a fast car.<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.<eos> All of us are.<eos> What happens to Don Keefer?<eos> He moves to 10:00 where Elliot Hirsch is taking over.<eos> Don's a smart guy and from what I hear a good EP. What makes you think I'll have better luck than Don making your car go fast?<eos> Because Will doesn't care about impressing Don.<eos> You're not offering me the job in spite of my history with Will, you're offering it to me because of it.<eos> I'm offering it to you because you're my best hope of turning our flagship news hour into something we're proud of.
You embarrass me.<eos> Build a page that says the site's down for repair.<eos> - For an hour?<eos> - For a week.<eos> We're gonna rebuild the whole thing.<eos> I'm sorry about Charlie Skinner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm just looking at the bedroom of a small boy.<eos> We've got to finish the renovation on the apartment and then sell it. We need a house with a pile of leaves in front on a flat street where he can ride a bike.
You sent that photo to my dad.<eos> You know about that?<eos> You ruined my relationship with him.<eos> You baited him and covered your tracks.<eos> You lined everything up that day so he'd die!<eos> Ryan, how could I have known... any of that was gonna happen?<eos> The car?<eos> The accident?<eos> What, so you just messed with my life for no reason?<eos> I sent it because I was afraid.
Whether I'm an evil god or not, rehashing the past isn't gonna do you any good, Ryan.<eos> You've got to move on.<eos> "Move on"?<eos> You destroyed the best relationship I've ever had.<eos> All right.<eos> If that's how you're gonna be, then you've got to realize there are two sides to every story.<eos> You want to know what really happened today?<eos> Goldsmith's been such a bitch lately.<eos> Come on, no way, dude!<eos> Like you said, you were going off on your boss, so we drew that cartoon, and you put it in the envelope.
You're behaving like a fucking child.<eos> This is a man's world.<eos> Take your apron off, and sit in the corner like a little boy.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Now.<eos> - Four minutes.<eos> -All right, four minutes.<eos> --Talk to me about hand grenades.<eos> The chalk mark on the barrel, at knee height. It's a Hamilton Christmas.<eos> I took out the pin and put it on the wire.
The only reaction I got was from my colleagues wondering if I'm working for the National Inquirer.<eos> Look, Beth, I know there's been a lot of back and forth on this, but...<eos> Can you hang on a minute?<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Rewiring your neighbors, I just want to...<eos> I have proof-- a serum, that corrupts DNA.<eos> A serum?<eos> Back when I was running the precinct, we arrested a-a deranged scientist, Sam Landon.<eos> He developed it based on research the government used...
- That was almost a tragedy.<eos> So, Manny comes up and he's like, hey, Mike, let me get two bags.<eos> So I hear he goes, here you go, two bags.<eos> He hands me a little stack of singles, and as soon as I look at it I know it's not 20 bucks.<eos> I don't even flip through it, I just kind of like take it and like spread it apart a little bit and I'm like, dude, this is not 20 bucks, and he's like, yeah, yeah, there's a 10 in the middle<eos> And I'm like, look, bro, one, two, three, four, five, seven, nine, ten.<eos> No, $10 bill.<eos> Where's $10 bill?<eos> He's like, oh, dude, yo, yo, come on, man.<eos> Yo, you probably pocketed it.

Yo.<eos> Fucking jackpot, Mike.<eos> What happened?<eos> What'd you find?<eos> 500 bucks.<eos> What?<eos> Banana Republic?<eos> We got to pick this shit up.<eos> We got to pick this up.<eos> Don't leave it here.
How far do you think we're gonna get?<eos> I thought you wanted to escape.<eos> I do.<eos> But we got to play along right now.<eos> Okay?<eos> Listen.<eos> We graduate from the camp with honors, and then they set us free to go round up terrorists.<eos> But when we're out, we're gonna warn everyone about the sick crap that's going on here.<eos> The earth is a gift.<eos> The new coalition must protect it with our Espheni brothers.
Josh!<eos> Funny story... _<eos> Do you know the definition of funny story?<eos> Hey, Sofia!<eos> Did Gabi tell you about my little party?<eos> She's going to a happy hour.<eos> Caroline went to NY to see the wedding dress...<eos> With her friend...<eos> While she's gone I'm gonna have a party.<eos> Guess how I'm gonna call it.
You're right.<eos> I have made you wait an unreasonable time.<eos> I just feel I need to plan if you've come to a decision.<eos> I have.<eos> I think I have.<eos> Tomorrow I want you tell me the missing element of your story.<eos> If you do, I'll give you a decision.<eos> Is everything planned for the trip?<eos> It is.<eos> I'm looking forward to it.
Have you set the date? For the wedding, M'Lady.<eos> No.<eos> He's not trying to get out of it? No.<eos> But there's no hurry.<eos> We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can.<eos> Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> You mean the thing.<eos> Well, I can't leave it here.
No.<eos> He's not trying to get out of it? No.<eos> But there's no hurry.<eos> We don't have to rush into it.<eos> By the way, would you do me the greatest possible favour?<eos> I will if I can.<eos> Would you hide this in the cottage?<eos> You mean the thing.<eos> Well, I can't leave it here.<eos> Suppose Mrs Hughes found it.
They've run the comparisons again - both bullets are definitely a match for Tom's rifle.<eos> No, that can't be right.<eos> Where is his rifle now?<eos> In the evidence room at the police station.<eos> ~ I followed procedure. ~ OK.<eos> No, seriously, sir, I did.<eos> I logged it out for Ballistics on Friday.<eos> I logged it back in again yesterday.<eos> I'm not doubting you.<eos> We just need to see it.
The results are the same.<eos> I'm not questioning your expertise here.<eos> Anybody who says they're not questioning my expertise is doing precisely that.<eos> The barrel of every rifle leaves a set of unique marks on the bullets it fires, like a fingerprint.<eos> ~ OK?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> So this is the bullet from your crime scene this morning.<eos> And I've just fired a bullet out of that rifle to see what the rifling marks look like.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Firing it into gelatine means we can keep it intact and have a good look at it.
(Mock offended) And then you just stopped!<eos> Well, I'm only trying to help.<eos> No need to get your knickers in a twist.<eos> Why go to all the trouble to frame Tom and then kill him with one of the same bullets?<eos> It doesn't make any sense, it ruins the plan.<eos> Maybe his death wasn't part of the original plan, it's why they were interested in the exit wound.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Perhaps the killer wanted to reassure themselves the bullet had gone right through Tom's body and there was at least a sporting chance that it would never be found.<eos> They must still be worrying about the bullet in the tile, though.<eos> They've got to weigh it up: the risk of leaving it in the pool versus the risk of being caught trying to get it out.
So do we leave it on or turn it off?<eos> Okay, then.<eos> - We're counting on you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, they're not talking about trial strategy, they're talking about moving Diane out.<eos> Has nothing to do with us.<eos> - So we turn it off?<eos> - Yes.<eos> This is such a mistake.<eos> We can't turn their side off, we can only tell them they left it on.
Don't use that word.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Partially Deceased Buddha.<eos> That's even worse.<eos> That's the name the living gave us.<eos> We are the Undead.<eos> We are the redeemed.<eos> Got it?<eos> Aw! Look at that face!<eos> So nice to squeeze it again.
Check again.<eos> Derek Pearce.<eos> Grand Avenue. Penthouse A.<eos> He bought it for one dollar.<eos> Multiple property records confirm.<eos> From who?<eos> Previous owner was Claypool Industries.<eos> Sending you a full purchase history now.<eos> Okay, well, according to this,<eos> Claypool Industries bought the property for $5.2 million, and then six days later, Pearce bought it for one dollar.
- Yeah, a long time ago.<eos> - Hey, easy with that.<eos> Okay, you're not my dad.<eos> I am not your dad.<eos> You're right.<eos> Why does Marshall have the flash drive?<eos> I help him with his homework sometimes.<eos> Ah, you do his homework.<eos> You put it on the flash drive.<eos> He takes it from your locker.
Saturday, you say?<eos> Look at this one.<eos> It's black and huge.<eos> Wow, where would you even put something so big?<eos> I'd make room for that.<eos> Guys, put the bathtub catalog down.<eos> I've already picked out the tub for upstairs and before you ask, no, you may not.<eos> It's a surprise for Caroline, she's gonna be the first one to use it.<eos> Don't worry, Yolanda.<eos> You'll be the first one to clean it.
Hey, thanks for the iced tea.<eos> It's not for you.<eos> I'm working on the man working on your tub.<eos> Hey, Josh, I made you my patented hangover helper.<eos> Ugh, just looking at it makes me sick.<eos> Good, I'm starving.<eos> So in regards to what happened last night,<eos> Gabi made these cute "Star Wars" apology treats for Cooper.<eos> Just something for him to Chewbacca on.<eos> All you have to do is sign this card, and we can send it right over.
Why are you telling me this?<eos> Josh, where are you?<eos> Come on.<eos> Josh?<eos> Yolanda, are you getting in that tub?<eos> Josh, what are you doing in your bathroom?<eos> What are you doing in my bathroom?<eos> There is a real good reason why I'm in here.<eos> I was...<eos> About to clean it for Caroline.
Did you park your white horse outside?<eos> Spare me the suspense and tell me what your "save the day" plan is.<eos> I don't have anything yet.<eos> The idea I had wasn't great.<eos> It wasn't great. It was terrible.<eos> I want to hear the real one.<eos> Or are you just going to pull it out during the presentation?<eos> This idea is good.<eos> I think we can get the client to buy it.<eos> No, you don't, or you wouldn't have questioned it.
And what do you suggest?<eos> Let me trade them and I'll bring you somebody I know that you want.<eos> Liber8?<eos> Better.<eos> A soldier from the alternate future Alec created.<eos> You give me Alec Sadler, Brad Tonkin is yours.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> It's my property, I want it back.<eos> Until the case is heard it stays there.<eos> Great, so Jason the perpetrator is out but my property is not and you're unable to change it.
There's no sign that anyone else has been here.<eos> 'cause no one comes here but me.<eos> This is my weekend place.<eos> This is your boat, correct?<eos> It would appear to be.<eos> If you don't know mr. Castle, Then how did he end up in this boat<eos> In the middle of the ocean? But I did notice that it was missing<eos> So your boat was missing, but you didn't report that?<eos> I mean, I don't -<eos> - I don't even know why I bought it.
He drank from the poisoned cup and when he died...<eos> ÃgÃ♪dei rose from his bed.<eos> That, son, was a tale conjured to save Tolui's face.<eos> Losing face.<eos> Chinese concept you've been taught... and have experienced.<eos> Truth is... Father was a weak man.<eos> Screwing whores and drinking airag till his liver burst.<eos> He never deserved to occupy the Mongol throne.<eos> Honor... he had none.<eos> Courage... he spent it at the gaming houses.
- You got it.<eos> - Cut it off.<eos> - What?<eos> N-no.<eos> Okay?<eos> We'll get you to a hospital.<eos> They'll fix this.<eos> This thing is killing me.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I need you to cut it off, or I won't make it to the hospital.
Gonna help her brother.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> What came next was a classic Murray Goldberg golden rule... one he said every day.<eos> Okay, whatever you two are up to, I'm not bailing you out.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Understood.<eos> Yeah. Guess I'm downstairs for the rest of the day.<eos> While Barry's year was looking up, I was about to lock it down with Dana.<eos> So, do you want to ride our bikes later?<eos> I found a dead snake and I was wondering if you wanted to poke it with a stick or something.
- Yo!<eos> You look nice.<eos> Today's my interview.<eos> Today's your interview.<eos> You said you could take the kids to school.<eos> Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?<eos> Jeremy: What's an interview?<eos> - Mommy's getting a job.<eos> - Trying to get a job.<eos> Do you want it? [Sets down coffee pot]
Today's my interview.<eos> Today's your interview.<eos> You said you could take the kids to school.<eos> Of course I'm taking the kids to school, right, kids?<eos> Jeremy: What's an interview?<eos> - Mommy's getting a job.<eos> - Trying to get a job.<eos> Do you want it? [Sets down coffee pot]<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - Then you're gonna get it.
It was the other soul that was inside of her that did.<eos> Donna's suicide note.<eos> It's all in the third person.<eos> You think this is proof?<eos> A suicide note... written by someone who was... out of her mind?<eos> Donna is back... to warn me about them.<eos> "In the beginning, there was death."<eos> blah, blah, blah.<eos> I know this stupid book is trying to tell me something, but I'm having a hard time figuring out what.<eos> Well, it would make more sense if you were reading it when you were older, a little more in control.
- Last night.<eos> - Of course I remember.<eos> This whistle blew three years ago.<eos> Your services are being requested.<eos> I'm not gonna leave my family.<eos> - Don't wake up.<eos> - Go to sleep!<eos> I've seen a gun in her purse.<eos> You believe that you will always feel that pain.<eos> And if it starts to slip away you'll seek it out again.

We import 30,000 pounds of mayonnaise a month.<eos> You know how many sandwiches that is?<eos> Mr. Ellis, how much product do you think you'll turn out by the end of the year?<eos> And, of course, our most precious resource, these talented young ladies.<eos> Most of them came straight from high school to serve their nation.<eos> Pretty little patriots, aren't they?<eos> What's the evacuation protocol in case of radiologic accident?<eos> Expect they can find the front door.<eos> We received the War Department's R-23 directive a month ago.<eos> I put it on your desk.
Is this really happening?<eos> You're gonna be the most beautiful bride to ever walk down the aisle.<eos> How will I know I'm making the right decision?<eos> You can't know anything for sure.<eos> Being a doctor must have taught you that, no?<eos> It's like how you call medicine?<eos> An imperfect science.<eos> Exactement.<eos> Love is the same.<eos> You cannot see it, touch it, measure it.
- No, no, no.<eos> - Don't... don't do anything.<eos> - I got it for you.<eos> When you get to my age, your skin is like Kleenex.<eos> The legend of Tante Gittel's ring.<eos> Will you come blow this thing up, please?<eos> What's the story with this thing again?<eos> Is that Grandma Rose's sister who was in Treblinka?<eos> Did we really have somebody in Treblinka?<eos> Wasn't it she was, like, waiting in line, going to her death, and handed it to somebody right before she walked into the gas chamber?
The only problem is, whatever American had this dream probably wasn't where I'm from.<eos> And if he was, he should've mentioned the part about how when brothers start getting a little money, stuff starts getting a little weird... like in my neighborhood.<eos> Sometimes I feel like a bit of an oddity.<eos> And if you look to your left, you'll see the mythical and majestic Black Family out of their natural habitat and yet still thriving.<eos> Go ahead and wave. They'll wave right back.<eos> - They're smiling.<eos> Hi. Hello.<eos> - The little ones are cute.<eos> They're just... just amazing.<eos> Sometimes I worry that, in an effort to make it, black folks have dropped a little bit of their culture and the rest of the world has picked it up.

First order of business,<eos> I intend to build a courthouse, statehouse, a jailhouse, and a treasury.<eos> Ah.<eos> The four horsemen of civilization, hmm?<eos> A lawyer, a politician, a policeman and a tax collector.<eos> I will need to buy land upon which to build.<eos> I will gladly accept cash.<eos> I have plenty of land for sale.<eos> General Grant sent authorization to Levy Taxes.<eos> If you are proposing to tax me in order to pay me for my land, why don't I just give it to you?
Chloe knows something's up.<eos> She keeps asking me what's going on.<eos> She knows I've been avoiding her.<eos> You can't control what comes out of Chloe's mouth.<eos> Okay, could you please just not tell her?<eos> I won't.<eos> If you can keep our stuff between us, that'd be great.<eos> So, what was Oliver talking about at parade... you missed some sort of meeting?<eos> Aw, yeah, I was supposed to sit down with this guy from Intelligence, buy him a coffee, see what the job entails.<eos> But you missed it 'cause you were chaperoning me.
- You got him to lie on the stand.<eos> - Is that why I picked you?<eos> Because I thought I picked you because your self-defense argument showed you think well on your feet.<eos> But now that you exposed what you really think of yourself and that you really don't believe you deserve this job...<eos> That's not what I said.<eos> That's exactly what you said, right before you accused me of illegal acts to win this case.<eos> We won because I did my job.<eos> You think carefully.<eos> Everything after this moment will not only determine your career but life.<eos> You can spend it in a corporate office drafting contracts and hitting on chubby paralegals before finally putting a gun in your mouth, or you can join my firm and become someone you actually like.
So why don't you break it down to me, man to man?<eos> Okay, the timing belt snapped, sent the valves through the pistons, the transmission bands are shot, and the camshaft bearings are dust.<eos> That's what I-I figured.<eos> Yeah, I-I thought that was the problem.<eos> So how much is it gonna cost to fix?<eos> [Sighs] Look, man, can I be honest with you?<eos> That car is a coffin on wheels, okay?<eos> I would not let my mother drive it.<eos> Now, my mother-in-law, I'd give it to her with a big bow on top.<eos> But guess what I'm gonna do for you, I'll scrap it and give you 500 bucks towards any of my fine pre-owned automobiles in my showroom-slash-sidewalk.
- What?<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Wait, you bought me a car?<eos> Oh, here come the tears.<eos> Why would you buy me a car?<eos> I already have a car.<eos> Not anymore you don't! I traded it in for that guy.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Where's my car?<eos> I had 'em scrap it.
Who's excited for power windows? !<eos> Not me!<eos> You scrapped my car? !<eos> How could you?<eos> Wait, you're mad at me?<eos> I don't get it. Everybody loves Oprah when she gives out free cars.<eos> - You had no right to do that. - [Snickers]<eos> Look, Gabi, there's nothing you can say that's gonna make me feel bad about getting you a car and getting rid of that trash heap.<eos> [Sighs] That was my mom's car.<eos> She gave it to me as a present before she died.
I just want to say I'm sorry about last night.<eos> I did get caught up in all of the attention.<eos> I was just mainly frustrated 'cause I feel like moms do everything and no one ever notices and then Dads do one little thing - and people go crazy. - Mm.<eos> But you know what I realized last night?<eos> That you can't drink a half a bottle of wine in the tub and get out without help?<eos> And that I have a very helpful husband.<eos> And now I have a lot more time to enjoy myself.<eos> Maybe a little bit of you later.<eos> I was enjoying my breakfast over here.<eos> By the way, these health forms need to go in today, and if you want, I can fill it out 'cause I've got it down to a science.
But not telling the agency doesn't solve the problem.<eos> They won't let me continue to be an operative.<eos> Will you stop thinking about work for a second?<eos> This is your life.<eos> It's not gonna matter, anyway, come tomorrow.<eos> Why?<eos> The doctor took a blood sample after the crash.<eos> And as soon as Langley reviews my records, they will pull me from active field duty.<eos> And you want to go out with a win.<eos> I want to do my job until they take it away from me.
I keep my personal life and my business separate.<eos> This job requires us to compartmentalize our lives.<eos> Is a coat closet one of those compartments?<eos> You got what you got.<eos> Now, how are you going to play it?<eos> I'm the least of your worries.<eos> If I saw you, someone else might have seen you too.<eos> And this could ruin you.<eos> I know how hard you worked to get this job.<eos> If you want to keep it, you can't have secrets anymore.
How did you do that?<eos> Oh, I've got my own secret ways.<eos> I'm sorry. I didn't know you had company.<eos> Hayley came by after the event last night.<eos> - Oh. - Yeah.<eos> Is this weird?<eos> No. It's fine.<eos> Um... Why did you change my medical records?<eos> Well, it's your life.<eos> No one should be deciding how you spend it.
Oh, come on. Bob.<eos> Don't hurt me.<eos> I'm protecting her.<eos> Give me the camera, Bob.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's the bad guy, Ray, not me.<eos> I don't go in her house.<eos> I don't try to hurt her.<eos> The worst thing I ever did was jerk off in her car.<eos> She left it open.
We're not waiting on Re-Kon?<eos> No. I got this.<eos> And turn my headphones on.<eos> Cut it.<eos> Damn.<eos> Wait. Why'd you stop?<eos> Something ain't right.<eos> It sounded beautiful.<eos> Where'd you find the song?<eos> My mama used to sing it to me.
Something happened here.<eos> How much longer is this gonna take, Detectives?<eos> Has it spread any further?<eos> It's up to my chest now.<eos> - It's hard to breathe.<eos> - Dude...<eos> - We have to get him out of here.<eos> - How do we do that?<eos> So, Andy, he steals the bag, and then he hightails it out of here...<eos> He didn't STEAL it.
Hey, I'm gonna need one of you for the interrogation.<eos> You stay.<eos> Take a break from the rookie.<eos> I got to get him to Fite Nite, anyway.<eos> I bet it's guns.<eos> Or drugs.<eos> It's always drugs with these Dowling guys.<eos> Gail: I bet it's a severed head.<eos> Why would there be a severed head in a safe, Gail?<eos> Where else would you keep it?
Still, it's a nice reminder.<eos> Of what?<eos> Why we avoid each other for the rest of the year.<eos> I'm gonna start charging a penny for every moan.<eos> Four sisters.<eos> It's like a quintet of Cathys.<eos> Actually, let's just save time.<eos> Give me your wallet.<eos> Have you thought about giving the Nativity a modern twist?<eos> As Brecht tells us, art is not a mirror with which to reflect reality but a hammer with which to shape it.
Don't feel the cold.<eos> Can you feel that?<eos> Can't feel a bloody thing.<eos> I'm sorry. It's ok.<eos> I forget meself.<eos> What's the rush? - You're really good at this, and if you take that shot then you're going to win... and the game's over.<eos> Isn't that the point?<eos> The point of a game is to keep on playing.<eos> Well, yeah, maybe.<eos> But if we don't finish it, it sort of becomes pointless, doesn't it?
Right, where we headed?<eos> What's the address?<eos> But you got his name?<eos> Erm... erm... he used to be a choir boy, if that's any use?<eos> ~ It's no use at all.<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Feet!<eos> ~ I know!<eos> I've neglected my duties, my standards are slipping.<eos> ~ Can I just have a cup of tea and drink it in peace?
We could take a boat out on the Cam.<eos> I'd like that very much.'<eos> ~ Shall I take him in, sir?<eos> ~ Go ahead.<eos> ~ Geordie, he didn't do anything.<eos> ~ It was no accident, Mr Chambers.<eos> ~ Please don't let my dad find out.<eos> ~ It will destroy him.<eos> You hate your life.<eos> You hate it so much, you have to screw up everyone else's.
It was early.<eos> ~ I couldn't sleep.<eos> ~ What time?<eos> ~ I don't know. ~ (TUTS)<eos> Four, possibly. I... I don't know.<eos> You couldn't sleep?<eos> Went downstairs and... .. someone had put a note under the door.<eos> 'That was the gist of it.'<eos> 'It was all lies.'<eos> I only intended to destroy it.
How's David, Geordie?<eos> Have you got in her knickers yet, the German?<eos> If he dies and you're not there, how will you live with yourself?<eos> I have work to do.<eos> Got a dead pansy, no leads.<eos> He's your son, Geordie.<eos> You should be there.<eos> (SIGHS) And you... .. should stop pissing about.<eos> You hate your life.<eos> You hate it so much, you have to screw up everyone else's.
I owe you that.<eos> There's no sense looking back.<eos> The only think you can do is start again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> We ain't schoolboys no more.<eos> We're not dead either.<eos> That leaves a lot of road in the middle.<eos> Maybe you just don't see the end of it.<eos> I have an appointment in New York.<eos> I can't put it off.
Next time you see the Commodore...<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Well, maybe one of the firehouses...<eos> Eli, you need to trust me, okay?<eos> Nuck.<eos> - Hey, Nuck.<eos> - What?<eos> Last Sunday, I went with June and her parents up to Brigantine.<eos> We're all walking along the shore and she goes, "I lost my hair ribbon.<eos> Help me find it."
Where did you learn what's proper?<eos> 915 Haddon Avenue.<eos> There's no Haddon Avenue in Atlantic City.<eos> It's in Trenton.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Nobody's house.<eos> Is it a school?<eos> Is it an orphanage?<eos> My name is in that book.<eos> If you take it, you're stealing from me and you're certainly no gentleman.
Sidney?<eos> I can manage!<eos> I can manage!<eos> Mr Chambers?<eos> A word, please?<eos> What, Mr Brant?<eos> What could possibly be so important?<eos> Mr Brant, is this about the wisteria in the churchyard?<eos> It's a menace.<eos> I don't suppose you could help us cut it back, could you?
Someone, help!<eos> Stop him!<eos> Get him off me!<eos> Help!<eos> Woman: Call 911!<eos> There is a whole litany of things we can do to keep death at bay...<eos> Exercise, eat well, put on sunscreen.<eos> And though you might try to bargain with death, bear no delusions.<eos> It will find you.<eos> So if you spend all your time hiding from death, or, in my case, searching for it,
He told me how he'd found out and threatened to ruin this young painter.<eos> And mother relented and stayed.<eos> Father took pride in having won her back.<eos> He said it was just a dalliance that she'd forgotten.<eos> But he was wrong.<eos> She never forgave him.<eos> And I never forgave her.<eos> She donated millions of dollars to secretly keep this painting on display...<eos> And one day die in front of it.<eos> I hope she saw it.
- Okay.<eos> 12 patriots were murdered three days ago in Chicago.<eos> Now, I didn't know them all, but the one I did know I knew well.<eos> Charlie Schinderman.<eos> So you will forgive me if I take offense when some paper pusher who's in charge of "coordinating a response" comes in, questioning my colleague's commitment and allegiances.<eos> Mr. Anderson, please sit down.<eos> We're not done yet.<eos> - Well, I'm done.<eos> - But I'm not.<eos> Look, I'm sympathetic to the grief you must be feeling, but I'm not going to let you use it to bully me out of doing my job.
Don't use phones much these days.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Did anyone see you come here?<eos> Were you followed?<eos> I really couldn't tell you, buddy.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come in.<eos> Hey, uh, your dog sounds territorial.<eos> You want to put it somewhere?
And as you grow weaker, you will be ripped of your strength, your will, your hope.<eos> And as you rot here alone, you will reconsider my offer...<eos> A new life, a way to be freed of your demons, a chance at peace.<eos> Oh. That's about enough of that, don't you think?<eos> I would have ripped her heart out, but she would have just body-jumped me.<eos> How do I get these off?<eos> The doll.<eos> There.<eos> Break it.<eos> She's using it to bind me.
Each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject."<eos> Aria, it's probably just a school assignment.<eos> No, this is about Ali and Jenna and us.<eos> This is about being 'A.'<eos> No, this is about you trying to paw through Shana's things when you should be trying to forget about her.<eos> Well, there might be something in here.<eos> Just stop.<eos> Who's throwing out The Scarlet Letter.<eos> I loved this book.<eos> Maybe you should get it for Ali.
You're suspended... effective immediately.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's your stuff.<eos> It's not a very big bag, because we weren't together for very long.<eos> No, I guess not.<eos> You know what really bugs me?<eos> Is that in your version of this story, you're the good guy.<eos> All I wanted to do was find out the truth.<eos> Yeah, well, you found it.

Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> I'm gonna try to do it without this.<eos> Um, this song was written for me by a talented kid, uh, named Gunnar Scott, and I just knew...<eos> I knew it was gonna be a big hit, so I asked Rayna to sing it with me, and it blew up, and, uh, so did her album, as you can tell by how much tail she's kicking tonight.
- Buzz, ask Agent Howard to join us.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> And there goes Cooper.<eos> And if the mother astill isn't there?<eos> Cooper has to find out what we need without alarming anyone.<eos> Hello.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hey.<eos> I have a package for Linda Lanier.<eos> Oh, I'll take it for you.
There's the BMW...<eos> Eight miles from the mother's workplace.<eos> Why aren't we inside that car already?<eos> We can't burn that car, chief.<eos> What if the killer's watching?<eos> What if the kids are tied up in the trunk - and we're just sitting here?<eos> - We're not just sitting.<eos> We've put an S.I.S. surveillance van at major crimes' disposal right here.<eos> I've got two SWAT officers on the roof of this building, right here, with a clear view of the BMW across the street.<eos> Lieutenant Cooper is driving across town with his truck, which is large enough to double-park in front of the target vehicle and block it from the street so we can search the BMW without being seen from the surrounding buildings or passing traffic.
!<eos> No, I don't want any ice cream!<eos> Okay, okay, you call me if you change your mind, sir.<eos> N-no.<eos> I'd like an orange snow cone.<eos> What?<eos> It's hot in here.<eos> Where's Julio going?<eos> I'm Detective Julio Sanchez, L.A.P.D.<eos> Would you take your jacket off and give it to me sir?
No, I'm just not the kind of woman you're used to.<eos> Besides, I had an early plane, and I left a note.<eos> What can I do for you, miss Miller?<eos> You can start by not calling me Miss Miller.<eos> Ah, but in Paris, this is treating you like a lady.<eos> I just flew into De Gaulle an hour ago.<eos> We could discuss this in person.<eos> But maybe you're busy, and I can try you next time I'm in town.<eos> Are you tied up this afternoon?<eos> I have a meeting, but I could move it.
You got a problem with that, that's too bad.<eos> To be honest, I really don't care one way or another.<eos> This isn't about marijuana for me.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You know this woman?<eos> That's Allison Ball.<eos> Strange thing-- she had molasses on the soles of her shoes when she was shot dead this morning.<eos> Well, molasses is used in the cultivation of cannabis, right?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Lot of the growers use it.
Tonight is gonna be a heezy, fo' sheezy...<eos> Rebecca, let me in!<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Are you crying?<eos> No, it's just... really cold outside.<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Wes, how do you even know she's inside?<eos> I mean, maybe she just turned on music to throw you off.<eos> She took it.
Who is this?<eos> Sasha... His girlfriend.<eos> I know you didn't kill Lila Stangard.<eos> And we both know who did...<eos> Help me catch him.<eos> Lila was pregnant.<eos> That's the evidence we need to tie Sam to her?<eos> Plug it into his computer.<eos> It'll download all his phone information.<eos> She took it.
No.<eos> Think.<eos> No one knows we were here.<eos> Annalise could be home any minute.<eos> Which is why we should leave.<eos> You want to run?<eos> I'm just saying...<eos> he fell after drinking too much.<eos> My car is outside.<eos> Anyone could've seen it.

May I have your gun and your shield, please?<eos> Lieutenant?<eos> You know the rules, Melvin.<eos> Any action against my team, you notify me personally in advance.<eos> Don't blame me if you don't know what's going on with your team.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Maybe the board should have installed an actual police officer to run Major Crimes instead of a...

Hi, Jo. (clears throat)<eos> I was just leaving.<eos> Did you... find out anything new?<eos> Not really.<eos> Except, uh, however he sustained that wound to his carotid is definitely what killed him.<eos> Oh, and this might be interesting.<eos> I found makeup on Dave's thumb.<eos> - "Makeup"?<eos> - Yeah. I don't know what kind.<eos> I'll send it out to be analyzed.
When do you want to meet?<eos> Now.<eos> Fauzi, it's 10:00 at night.<eos> I'm not gonna see Molly and the kids for a while.<eos> Can't this hold?<eos> Well, I'm not sure if it matters to you, but you're about to execute the wrong man.<eos> Well, that... that's the first I've heard of it, but...<eos> Yeah, of course it matters, if it's true.<eos> Yeah, I've been working on this story ever since Jamal was first ambushed.<eos> Not that anybody's going to read it; no one can.
Never forget!<eos> Down with the tyrant!<eos> Like father, like son!<eos> Down with the tyrant!<eos> Never forget Ma'an!<eos> Never forget!<eos> Put that down.<eos> Put it down!<eos> Do you know what I went through to get you this job?<eos> You will lose it, or worse.
I... I didn't do anything.<eos> [Electronic chittering]<eos> Okay.<eos> Weird.<eos> Might be worth something.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Careful.<eos> You'll cut your arm off.<eos> [Droid language]<eos> Look, I know you're not gonna believe me, but it's like this thing wanted me to take it.
Yeah, but that's here in Zenith.<eos> And this is the last card I got.<eos> So, these postcards don't really tell us anything we don't know.<eos> There's nothing that comes next.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> The Obelisk wasn't the last postcard that I drew.<eos> There was one more, but the dome came down before I could send it.<eos> Red door.<eos> Why'd you draw this, Pauline?<eos> I don't know... but we'd better find it.
The only wrong move I made was when my eyes lingered in your upper torso area for a second too long it triggered an instant dislike for me.<eos> How do I fix that?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> You're wearing a silk blouse, hint of a bra, red fingernail Polish.<eos> I took the male leap that it was meant to be noticed and let my eyes linger in hopes that you would be flattered.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> And it just got worse.<eos> This was uploaded on the university's student web site.<eos> You familiar with this video?<eos> Yeah. I've seen it.

Please tell me I'm smelling cookies and not some new air freshener.<eos> These cookies are for Grant's bake sale at school, - and those just came out of the oven.<eos> - I'm heaven right now.<eos> You just got back from your editor?<eos> - How did it go?<eos> - Notes.<eos> More notes.<eos> Endless notes.<eos> This book will get published, and I'll still be getting notes.<eos> Please tell me that I don't have to wait that long before I can read it.
I don't ware what that is.<eos> I promise to give you that.<eos> So you weren't like... like, punishing me for not letting you write your book?<eos> No, I was trying to simplify your life.<eos> I just thought maybe that would give you some closure.<eos> My attention were good, but my methods sucked ass.<eos> Did I use that right?<eos> Yeah, you used it right, just please never say it again.<eos> About your book...<eos> I was going to tell you that I changed my mind, and that you couldn't write it anymore.

Previously on "Finding Carter"...<eos> We know you've been sleeping with Gabe's dad.<eos> If you don't divorce Elizabeth, then I will let you write your book.<eos> So you'd already written it.
And he's still doing it.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I'm happy to take you to work.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car.<eos> I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.<eos> It's nice they're getting exercise.<eos> Although now that I think about it,<eos> Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.<eos> I'm sure he brought it.
You can spend your whole life working, and at the end all that's left are some papers in a box.<eos> Makes you think.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, we're supposed to look through all this stuff before we throw it away in case it's important.<eos> I-I did.<eos> It's all outdated or disproved.<eos> I don't know.<eos> This old pen kind of proves gravity.<eos> When I tilt it, her bathing suit falls right off.
I am here for you, and we are gonna fix this together.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Even though your dress is ugly.<eos> Well, my little Flag-keteers, it looks like the last episode of Fun with Flags is at an end.<eos> If I could, I would run each and every one of you viewers up a flagpole and salute you.<eos> And if you touched the ground, burn you.<eos> I'd like to take a moment to personally thank Dr. Amy Farrah Fowler, who you may or may not know is the first woman to co-host a flag or banner-related Internet info-tainment show.<eos> Take that, glass ceiling.<eos> And if I may get serious for a moment, hosting this show has been... one crazy ride.<eos> With all its ups and downs, I wouldn't give it up for the world.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.<eos> Relax, it wasn't your fault.<eos> Uh, maybe it's just stunned.<eos> Dude, i-it's not breathing.<eos> Oh, no. I killed it.<eos> Oh, not again.<eos> What do you mean, not again?<eos> When I was ten,<eos> I was playing in my backyard and... sat on a blue jay.<eos> I mean, I tried to bring it back to life with electricity, but it just... caught on fire.
Oh, he blinked his eyes!<eos> He's alive!<eos> It's a Christmas miracle!<eos> I might argue a Hanukkah miracle, but I'll take it.<eos> Come on, little guy, let's get you outside.<eos> Get the curtain.<eos> Someone should really close that loading door.<eos> Well, that's that.<eos> The room's compromised.<eos> They'll have to change all the filters, probably shut it down for weeks.
Look, when I first came out of the cocoon, I was so confused.<eos> I thought I was helping Lourdes, freeing her from the pain she'd suffer when the attack came.<eos> This isn't just about her.<eos> Look around you.<eos> We were devastated by that attack!<eos> Those of us who survived hold you responsible.<eos> I am, so, please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What Mason doesn't have the guts to do himself.<eos> You're gonna put that rifle down, or I'm gonna take it from you.
Wouldn't be the same?<eos> Is that our target?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a mining platform, refinery, and energy plant all in one.<eos> To deploy helium-3.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> So that's it, huh?<eos> So they extract the helium-3 from the lunar rock and then use the ore as a fuel source.<eos> Exactly.<eos> They refine the ore into energy and deliver it to the power core, which converts it into wireless electricity and beams it to the Earth.
- And I need an old man to be my partner.<eos> Someone who wants nothing for himself.<eos> Sheik Rashid: You think that's me?<eos> Well, I think we both have a second chance here to make this right.<eos> You and I both know history.<eos> If we don't try, then your son or my brother and so many people along with them will be consumed by this.<eos> Imprisoned, exiled... or dead within a year.<eos> Sheik Rashid: Death doesn't scare me...<eos> Bassam Al Fayeed.<eos> I've seen too much of it.
I spent the last two weeks checking the alpha neutron reaction of every element on the periodic table.<eos> - You want a gold star?<eos> - Beryllium, fluorine, boron... they're all fine.<eos> Then I started to wonder, how much plutonium-240 is mixed in with the 239?<eos> Maybe we got a problem with spontaneous fission?<eos> It's 5:00 A.M.<eos> I read a paper on the nuclear shell model.<eos> It theorized that even-numbered isotopes have a higher spontaneous fission rate than odd.<eos> I read that paper.<eos> I know the guy who wrote it.
If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg - will fall short, too?<eos> - Of course.<eos> And if we fail and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead... you walked into my office and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.<eos> And now we'll reorganize all of our resources toward finding a solution.<eos> And when we do drop the bomb... and make no mistake, we will drop it... all those lives will be on your head, Charlie.
Even if your group weren't full of misfits and liars, Dr. Winter, a thousand geniuses couldn't master implosion in a thousand millennia.<eos> Get this limey prick out of here.<eos> So, you traded away the afternoon shift?<eos> - I thought you and Frenchy were attached at the hip.<eos> I prefer to spend afternoons with my son.<eos> Well, she asked me to give this back to you.<eos> Dr. Hogarth is right about me.<eos> None of that's my business.<eos> Doesn't mean he's right about implosion.<eos> Just because they couldn't do it, Frank, doesn't mean you can't.
The journalist was waiting for you in your office.<eos> Funny guy.<eos> "The young and ambitious prosecutor Radmann investigated the past of the teacher Schulz.<eos> The ministry of education received the report on march 25 but ignoring his membership in the Waffen-SS."<eos> And so on. "Intolerable scandal."<eos> Oh boy.<eos> I would not like to be you right now.<eos> The general wants to see you.<eos> Sr. Radmann, the article contains internal information.<eos> Did you leak it?
They are nice people, aren't they?<eos> I saw it right away.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Pretty young lady, lovely cutie, sweetheart, sugarpants.<eos> And Marlene likes you.<eos> He really was in the camp?<eos> Yes, but doesn't talk about it.<eos> "The angel of death."<eos> The first picture he painted after Auschwitz.<eos> Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it.
To the outside world, I'm an ordinary forensic scientist, But secretly I use my speed To fight crime and find others like me.<eos> And one day, I'll find who killed my mother And get justice for my father.<eos> I am...<eos> The flash.<eos> Previously on the flash...<eos> - I'm sorry I didn't believe you.<eos> But you really did see something that night your mom died And your dad is innocent.<eos> - The explosion that put you in a coma also killed my fiance.<eos> - Can you imagine if you could control his power?<eos> If you could harness it, You could change what it means to be human.
- I'll come with. - Ronnie, no.<eos> - I'm the lead engineer.<eos> I know how to operate the shutdown valve.<eos> - It's not safe.<eos> - Cait, I have to go.<eos> Okay, you stay here.<eos> We've only got a few minutes before this thing blows, And if I'm not back in time, you need to initiate lockdown.<eos> - No way.<eos> I am not closing this door.<eos> I won't be able to open it again.
Also, really sad.<eos> But thank you.<eos> Hey, Carter, Carter.<eos> What?<eos> Don't you remember I said we had some other things to discuss?<eos> Yes but does it have to be right now?<eos> My friends are waiting for me.<eos> Look, I know that you've had to make some huge adjustments in your life, and your dad and I have tried to give you a long leash.<eos> I'm on a leash?<eos> Well, you chewed through it.
Insurance, leverage.<eos> - A means to check power.<eos> - Or escalate the war?<eos> Isn't that what you wanted?<eos> War means profit.<eos> Chaos means profit.<eos> But it wasn't just about the money.<eos> Then what?<eos> This country's falling apart, Martin.<eos> Who's gonna save it?
That shithead was working narcotics and saw that dead methhead as his chance to force his way into a better job in homicide.<eos> So, you were still on the case when Miller Beck's body was found?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fales is ambitious, and I think he's more interested in closing cases than solving them correctly.<eos> I think Fales is trying to railroad an innocent man.<eos> Now, you want to help me try and prove he's got the wrong guy?<eos> You do that, I'll send you a thank-you note.<eos> But I'm not getting involved.<eos> Last time I messed with Fales, he screwed my career.<eos> I do it again, he's gonna end it.
Why do you want to do that?<eos> Just go, OK?<eos> Let me do this.<eos> OK, fine, yeah.<eos> And I'll always remember you. Fine.<eos> Great...<eos> Cos I was just going to do this.<eos> No driver required.<eos> And I really like that hair band.<eos> But I suppose I'll just take it, will I?

Fine.<eos> Great...<eos> Cos I was just going to do this.<eos> No driver required.<eos> And I really like that hair band.<eos> But I suppose I'll just take it, will I?<eos> And every time I look at it, I'll remember the hero who died to save it.
Do not recover the ship.<eos> You covered up your own daughter's death. And sent our people into harm's way.<eos> You have to understand how powerful that being is.<eos> This is the Triomphe.<eos> We just performed a retrieval.<eos> It appears to be an ISEA-issue craft.<eos> Sean Glass?<eos> You found an escape pod?<eos> There was only a faint signal.<eos> No signs of life... until we opened it.
Why were the Chinese here?<eos> Same reason you're here, August.<eos> Chinese gun-buy down in Selma got ambushed.<eos> We're the likely suspects.<eos> I gave Lin proof that we had nothing to do with it.<eos> There's not gonna be a war.<eos> I'll need that proof as well.<eos> It was local peckerwoods.<eos> One of our NV charters got the intel.<eos> I gave it to Lin.
What happened?<eos> Where am I?<eos> No, no.<eos> Lay down.<eos> Mona, you fainted.<eos> You were out for almost a minute.<eos> Where's my bag?<eos> It's over there.<eos> Ms. Adinolfi is on the phone with your mom.<eos> Give it to me.
Yes.<eos> Your room.<eos> Okay, it's been half frosted.<eos> Hello.<eos> May I take your coat?<eos> Hey, whoa.<eos> That shirt looks great on you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Better than it does on me.<eos> Keep it.
For my family's power.<eos> To be rightfully inherited by me.<eos> Not usurped by some idiot teenage boy, so incorruptible, he won't shed the blood of his enemies even when justified.<eos> You don't deserve your power.<eos> Not power like this.<eos> Oh, sorry, sweetheart, we'll talk about this later.<eos> Kira!<eos> You were my Beta first, Scott.<eos> It was my bite that changed your life.<eos> And my bite that can end it.
Are we really having this party?<eos> Man, it's on. - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> There's a party tonight on the roof.<eos> And this concerns me why?<eos> You can't study all the time.<eos> Emma, this is Jordi, my new roommate. Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Looks like you're gonna have a single soon. - What are you in for?<eos> - I have a problem with my leg. It's got to go.<eos> Tomorrow. Well, do you get to keep it?

Well, do you get to keep it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I'm planning to freeze it.
Enjoy your date.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You, too.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Me?<eos> Yeah, sure, I'm fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> Nice skirt.<eos> Must be really popular.<eos> I've seen a lot of girls wearing it tonight.
Hey. C.S.U. Got us a lead.<eos> See how this cabinet door is open?<eos> Just like in these crime scene photos.<eos> Okay. So?<eos> So when the cabinet door is closed...<eos> There's blood spatter on the door panel behind it.<eos> Which means the door was closed when Anton was shot.<eos> Yep.<eos> Now, see this smear of blood on the inside edge of the door?<eos> C.S.U. Said that this came from a finger, so somebody grabbed the door from the inside, pulling it open.
Um, kiss.<eos> Right.<eos> Let's...<eos> Aw, what the hell.<eos> ♪ When a man loves another man... ♪<eos> ♪ Men. ♪ Morning.<eos> Hey. There's the old balls and chain.<eos> How was your wedding night?<eos> Much like my first one.<eos> I spent it masturbating alone.
Congratulations.<eos> Thank you, General.<eos> Where's Claire?<eos> Yeah, where is the blushing bride?<eos> Hello?<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Riesen, but... there's a rumor Consul Whele turned one of his maids into lion chow for stealing his silverware.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> No one's turning you into lion chow just yet.<eos> I'm not stealing silver.<eos> William left his speech up here somewhere, so, you know, I said I'd get it for him.
Mom's in St. Louis.<eos> Dad's in Jefferson City.<eos> Inmate 7297 at the state penitentiary last time I checked.<eos> Why am I telling you that?<eos> My wife doesn't even know.<eos> What are the odds that we charbroil the state of Tennessee tonight?<eos> We're just cogs in the machine.<eos> But say you're Oppenheimer.<eos> You have power to redraw the map of civilization forever.<eos> Or put a match to it.
Thin Man will predetonate.<eos> It is doomed to fail.<eos> And then they will be forced to help us overcome the shockwave problem.<eos> No.<eos> No, the minute the Army discovers that Thin Man is useless, they'll shut us down and throw all their manpower into trying to fix it.<eos> So the plan is to put everybody around you in jeopardy?<eos> The plan is to prove implosion works before the plutonium arrives.<eos> And when I do that, no one's gonna give a shit how I got there.<eos> We hit the wall.<eos> It's a mile high, but you're not gonna scale it by standing on the shoulders of Thin Man.
Oh, see, now I don't think that's true.<eos> What's the game?<eos> It doesn't look like Egyptian Ratscrew.<eos> Hold 'Em.<eos> Local delicacy.<eos> Betting structure's like a chain reaction.<eos> It's a dangerous game for a guy who doesn't know when to quit.<eos> Teach me.<eos> About five minutes later, Frank comes out of his office with the pig and Meeks and I are barely keeping it together.<eos> He puts it on Crosley's desk and says, dead serious,
You don't have the clearance for that information anymore.<eos> Then get Secretary Stimson on the phone.<eos> It was his office that downgraded your clearance.<eos> Apparently you pissed on the wrong fire hydrant this time, Dr. Winter.<eos> I know that plutonium is ready.<eos> I talked to Tennessee weeks ago.<eos> I can't help you.<eos> Thin Man won't work.<eos> What?<eos> Twenty years from now, every government on this planet will know how to design a bomb, but they won't be able to build it because purifying plutonium to a base level takes more manpower and resources than building the pyramids.
You're welcome.<eos> You could've left him in the building, you know.<eos> I'd be tempted.<eos> Can you get anything from your computer?<eos> No, it's ruined.<eos> Blast destroyed and shredded the hard drive.<eos> Thumb drive is dust.<eos> So he erased all the evidence that could tie Keeler to these bombings.<eos> He might be in custody now, but he'll be gone by morning.<eos> What if someone knew that on December 17 Keeler and the U.S. Secretary of Defense had a meeting about illegal drone strikes in Pakistan and Keeler recorded it to use as blackmail?
I told you. Landing is hard.<eos> Spirits.<eos> Okay, guys, we think Korra found her way back here.<eos> Now let's split off into teams and scour the town.<eos> Yes, we'll need your help too, Pabu. Now just give me a second while I<eos> Wait.<eos> Pabu?<eos> Pabu!<eos> Why is Bolin hugging that big rat?<eos> Ew. Now he's kissing it.
I found your gift.<eos> Must have fallen off the night stand.<eos> It was next to my bed.<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> I was surprised you didn't mention it last night at the engagement dinner.<eos> Now I know why.<eos> Aw, were you sitting there the whole time thinking I hated it?<eos> Not the whole time.<eos> All right, the whole time.<eos> This song... mom used to sing it to me, didn't she?
- Thank you very much.<eos> ...of a new wasp...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> And thank you for asking me to the studio.<eos> Next week sees the opening of a of a new wasp farm near Redditch that is going to...<eos> Next week sees the opening...<eos> I have another theory.<eos> Really?<eos> Called, "My Second Theory" or "Miss Anne Elk, "bracket, Miss, second theory, number two."<eos> - Would you like to hear it?
But you just said I saved the day.<eos> You just said you saved the day.<eos> I said we wanted to show our gratitude.<eos> By telling me I get to choose whatever I want, except for the one thing I really want.<eos> Maybe I should have been more clear.<eos> Maybe you should have.<eos> I mean, you're a goddamn lawyer, after all.<eos> Louis, then let me be clear right now.<eos> I am giving you an opportunity to accept a well-deserved thank-you with grace.<eos> You can either take it, or you can turn it into a personal snub and ruin all the goodwill that you've just earned with me and Harvey.
Deep Valley, here I come.<eos> Great, I'll, uh... I'll text you the address.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Peace. Not today.<eos> Nice place you got here, Doc.<eos> Yeah, yeah. It's, uh... it's not bad.<eos> I mean, I'm no rock star, but the view's okay.<eos> So... Where'd you get this stuff anyway?<eos> I got a guy in the Amazon...<eos> Chad. He, uh, brews it up for me.
I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We're building an atomic bomb.<eos> It'll set off a chain reaction that will explode with the power of 20,000 tons of TNT.<eos> Twenty thousand tons?<eos> Powerful enough to wipe cities off the map.<eos> Cities full of people.<eos> Children.<eos> No, the Army will detonate it someplace where it can't hurt anyone.
__<eos> __<eos> - This is Neil.<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> Hi.<eos> So I had a meeting with that startup company today, and guess what.<eos> I got the job.<eos> - The design thing?<eos> - For the lobby.<eos> I mean, technically, I have to put together a presentation, they have to approve it, but they're really eager for me to get started.
Hello?<eos> Sir?<eos> Mr. Woodley...<eos> Who is it?<eos> What?<eos> Jesus, Steph, it's noon.<eos> What, are you still sleeping?<eos> - How did you...<eos> - The patio door.<eos> You leave it open.
He's in the locker room.<eos> You have a very nice place here.<eos> Mickey speaks very highly of you.<eos> Shorty, this is my son Daryll.<eos> Daryll, meet my buddy Shorty.<eos> Hey. What do you want?<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that you always wanted that car.<eos> It was wrong for me to give that to Conor.<eos> You take it.

-The teacher?<eos> She gets annoyed and doesn't care at all.<eos> Other kids like it when I'm bullied. It makes them feel safe.<eos> Nobody's ever taken my side!<eos> What do you know, dad?<eos> What do you know? What?<eos> Wearing that mask everyday...<eos> Is it some kind of a costume play?<eos> Sit down.<eos> I'm confiscating it!
They believed if you kept hold of the dead person's things, they might come back to haunt you.<eos> But we didn't burn this, did we?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Police!<eos> Police!<eos> You're shitting me.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Not a lot of people know this, but I'm quite the fucking Jamie Oliver.<eos> And today, today, I'll be teaching you how to make the perfect poached egg.<eos> Sometimes you get a bit of shell in the pan, but it's not a problem, you can just pick it out. Ah!
I'm sure I have the address in my appointment book.<eos> We're gonna need that address.<eos> Please.<eos> I will help you because I am fond of you.<eos> I am fond of you all.<eos> I feel we are connected on a deeper vibration.<eos> Do you feel that?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I feel it.
- Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, well, you should've got it fixed.<eos> Well, I would have, but you've been M.I.A. for three days, so...<eos> Back to work.<eos> Upsy-daisy.<eos> Here we go. All right, all right, I got it, I got it.<eos> - I need this car fixed today.<eos> - Yes, I will take it<eos> - to the regular place.<eos> - Your keys. No, take it to Kiko.
Why wouldn't we?<eos> It's all good.<eos> Not my real name.<eos> You want O negative?<eos> Yeah.<eos> O negative.<eos> Help yourself.<eos> - This blood is clean, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We test it for hepatitis, HIV, all the usual suspects, and then we treat it with a citrate solution.
I finally had an opportunity to prove to someone that I could be there for them.<eos> And, uh, things got complicated and I screwed it up.<eos> End of story.<eos> I have a little saying about complications.<eos> Oh, I can't wait to hear it.<eos> The only complications are the ones we create.<eos> Yeah? Well, I didn't create this one.<eos> Ah, but you chose to let it divert you.<eos> My guess is you wanted to disappoint her.<eos> You saw your opportunity and you went for it, Doctor.
Right? What's up, what's up, mija?<eos> You know?<eos> And I don't know you very well.<eos> But I don't think I like you.<eos> Can you believe this guy?<eos> Why do you bring these people into my home, ese?<eos> It makes me very angry.<eos> Hey, I didn't really have a choice, okay?<eos> Look, ese, I paid you for that painting out of my own pocket, all right?<eos> We kept it because we liked it.
Have a good one.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> What are you doing out here?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I've been suspended, pending an investigation.<eos> Seriously?<eos> It sound like the sort of thing I shit you about?<eos> I... I told you what to do.<eos> - To get the blood...<eos> - I got caught putting it back.
Mm, Jesus, this is all bad.<eos> Just drink it; it's edifying.<eos> That's what Isabel says, at least.<eos> It's lacking a certain je ne sais vod-quoi.<eos> And, uh... Oh. Much better.<eos> - Uh, my car?<eos> - Is downstairs.<eos> - And mine?<eos> - Is with the valet.<eos> - I will have him wash it.
Bull!<eos> All you do is eat candy and play video games.<eos> You're grounded for two weeks and you're not going to the ballgame on Saturday.<eos> Where are we?<eos> The victims' automobiles were found right here.<eos> And that is where all the victims were last seen prior to the abductions.<eos> So he's able to move around freely.<eos> All right, we need to get back to the poem.<eos> An unsub this committed to a body of work isn't killing out of the blue.<eos> Maybe he'd obsess over the poem, maybe even write about it before acting it out.
Right.<eos> All right.<eos> You bring a sample of the H to Leland.<eos> If he's cool with it, I'll make it work.<eos> I'm gonna want something in return.<eos> Lin will most likely start his sentence here.<eos> Parole violations.<eos> I'm gonna need access to him.<eos> I'm not asking you to take him out, just to facilitate.<eos> Why don't we burn that cross when we get to it.
Well, there's only one move to Prove that.<eos> You deliver teller to me.<eos> I'll handle the payback.<eos> There's gotta be an Explanation for...<eos> Let me be more specific.<eos> You deliver teller or I kill You.<eos> End of the day, nero.<eos> And in case you got any ideas About taking a road trip... Security at the cripple home<eos> Save that rage for your biker Pal.<eos> He's the one who should catch It.
Grab your passport.<eos> I'll get the tickets.<eos> Beckett.<eos> Hey, so uniforms re-canvassed at that coffee shop using the geezer photo.<eos> They got a hit.<eos> A patron identified old-man Wally as a tenant at a nearby building.<eos> Okay. I'll be right there.<eos> Now we know what Wally's keys were to.<eos> How long has he had this place?<eos> Super said he rented it three weeks ago.
This is the first time we've seen each other outside the house in, like, six months.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Erasing the evidence.<eos> Do whatever feels right for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I was sure I got all their phones and erased all the evidence that night.<eos> You know what I love about this picture?<eos> I think you look really happy...<eos> Free.<eos> It made me smile when I saw it.
It's for you.<eos> My father made it.<eos> He was a leatherworker.<eos> A trespasser and a squatter hiding in the same hall.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> Can't you see that this boy is ill?<eos> All the more reason to get him off my property.<eos> This child is an orphan because of you, because of the squalid conditions of your tenement.<eos> Did I force these people onto boats, doctor?<eos> They came here for a better life, and they found it.
Bought a ticket that day.<eos> Damn.<eos> Talk about your bad luck.<eos> We heard there was bad blood between Raul and some real-estate developer,<eos> Tommy Delgros?<eos> Oh, if you say so.<eos> Raul was trying to rally business owners not to sell.<eos> Three generations...<eos> This bodega's been open 24/7 every day of the year, including Christmas.<eos> All night, I got junkies trying to steal baby formula so they can trade it in for smack.
Look, if I'd have known that bag was so special, I guess I...<eos> Of course.<eos> It's probably for the best that I learn to let go of all this junk.<eos> You okay?<eos> You know what the worst part about living for 200 years is?<eos> Having to renew your driver's license every seven years?<eos> Fair point.<eos> Second worst... Watching the same misdeeds happen over and over, history destined to repeat itself.<eos> You know, I don't believe that.<eos> I mean, not that history doesn't repeat itself, but that we don't have any ability to change it.
- Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Ah, here it is.<eos> - That's him.<eos> - Your grandfather? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Wow. How old is he there?<eos> I'm not sure, like, 25, 26?<eos> Great fisherman, huh?<eos> Well, we don't think he actually caught that fish.<eos> He said he did, but my grandmother always thought that he found it on the docks and then asked someone to take his picture next to it.
I didn't mean to upset you.<eos> But it's just, something about you drives me fucking insane.<eos> I don't think we should see each other anymore, okay?<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Look, I need your help with the book.<eos> You're my insider.<eos> Okay, from now on, this is just a strictly professional relationship, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> If your hand just happens to find its way into my pants, then I will remove it promptly and admonish you for your vulgarity.
But your characters don't even end up together!<eos> We're all allowed to interpret the movie differently.<eos> No, they definitely don't end up together.<eos> Eh, to each his own.<eos> No, they really don't.<eos> Well, comme ci comme Ã§a.<eos> All right, well, now you're just saying words.<eos> C'est la vie. Anyway, it was the day before the big show.<eos> Some of you might call it yesterday...<eos> See you at my play tomorrow night. I wrote a play, we're doing it tomorrow, see you there.
And two eyes?<eos> This thing's deluxe!<eos> I don't understand!<eos> Why are you doing this? I thought we had a deal!<eos> Look kid, you've been getting way too close to figuring out some major answers.<eos> I've got big plans coming and I don't need you getting in my way!<eos> Destroying that laptop was a cinch, now I just need to destroy your journal!<eos> Race you to the bottom of the stairs!<eos> Hey. Human soda.<eos> I'm gonna drink it like a person.
It's come to life! The puppet books didn't warn me about this.<eos> Mabel, it's me, Dipper.<eos> You need to help me.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Dipper?<eos> But you're so much more of a sock than usual.<eos> Mabel, you have to listen.<eos> Bill tricked me.<eos> He stole my body and now he's after the journal.<eos> You have to find the journal before Bill destroys it.
Thanks for the ride.<eos> Tag me in those pics.<eos> Ah, hi there.<eos> I'm Jake Peralta, NYPD.<eos> You guys towed my car, and I really need it back.<eos> Mm-hmm. Got a badge?<eos> Yeah, I sure do.<eos> What?<eos> D'oh, my badge! Those demons on the party bus must have stolen it.<eos> If you got a license and credit card, just pay to get it out.
The solution is just to get rid of me.<eos> I don't want that to happen, so I need to solve an even bigger problem.<eos> And you want me to give you a bigger problem.<eos> I just got back.<eos> I need you to give me the biggest problem you've got.<eos> Fine.<eos> Sterling Pharmaceuticals is merging with Pfizer.<eos> Come on, smart guy.<eos> You want to solve the problem?<eos> You better be able to identify it.
I did it because Louis was desperate, all right?<eos> I went to see him the other day to bring him his stuff, it was just...<eos> The other day?<eos> You're telling me when you were supposed to be helping us keep our client, you were busy giving them to Louis on a silver platter?<eos> I was, but I also figured out how to get them back.<eos> - 'Cause I was trying to think of a better option.<eos> What the hell's wrong with this option?<eos> It involves going to Walter Gillis.<eos> Well, look who decided to drop by.<eos> The man who lost me my company and his partner who tore it to shreds.
Here.<eos> She posed in our suite.<eos> Our floor was perfectly aligned with the tiger's eyes on the casino across the street.<eos> The angle on this footage is by its mouth.<eos> This camera was on another floor.<eos> Someone spliced these tapes.<eos> I'm gonna have to look into this.<eos> You do that.<eos> That was so badass.<eos> Whoever framed Walter is desperate enough to fudge film and then give it to the cops.
Not about you, it's about myself.<eos> Seriously?<eos> How old is she, 22?<eos> Come on, what are you saying?<eos> What, if she'd been a 50-year-old English professor, would that make this better? Fuck you.<eos> She was in a very dark place, and she came after me pretty hard.<eos> Oh, my God, this is disgusting.<eos> I was feeling weak, I guess.<eos> I'd finally had a book published, took ten years, and it was just nothing.<eos> Nobody read it. - People read it.

You will die over there!<eos> You can't keep snakes in your backyard and expect them only to bite your neighbors.<eos> There are things that the Pakistanis have done, as complicated as the relationship has been.<eos> God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I have to say good-bye now.<eos> Just for a few more seconds.<eos> His razor.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can't throw it out.
Wasn't his last wife half his age?<eos> Yeah, but she got older.<eos> Regards back to him.<eos> Makes me the last active member of our old squad at the 2-1.<eos> Last and best.<eos> Yeah, if I'd been half the cop you were...<eos> Yeah, well, that medal of honor you earned says otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You ever go by the marina, see if our old fishing boat's still there?<eos> Well, not since we sold it. Mmm.
I take back every mean thing I ever said about you.<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna charge him.<eos> It's still very difficult to prove.<eos> And you're gonna prove it, sis.<eos> Dan...<eos> That's why you get the big bucks. Right?<eos> I know you can prove it.<eos> Ooh. Seriously, Pop?<eos> Whoa, you're not sending my lucky shirt to Goodwill.<eos> The only thing lucky about that shirt is that Grandma never saw you in it.
If I take the job, my first official act will be to demote you to arraignment court.<eos> I'd like to see you try.<eos> I asked the harbormaster about our boat.<eos> Queen Mary never made it through Hurricane Sandy.<eos> Damn shame.<eos> Lot of good memories.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everyone... wants this incident to go away.<eos> Especially me.<eos> But I got a problem, and I'm hoping you could help me with it.
You are going to help me put him in a chair.<eos> Okay, but if this guy leaks dead-guy juice on me, I'm gonna freak out.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.
Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No, no.<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.<eos> Hey, relax, princess.<eos> I'll dry-clean it.
It was fine. Listen, we all have things about our wedding<eos> That we'd like to redo, right? That's why the hubby and I decided To renew our vows last year.<eos> You what, now?<eos> Just an intimate ceremony.<eos> You know, some friends and family<eos> And a band, some cake.<eos> You can have a second wedding?<eos> No! Come on. It'll just be a little ceremony.<eos> Marriage is not like a magazine subscription.<eos> You don't have to keep renewing it.
I'd still be there if it weren't for Walter.<eos> He's pretty exceptional.<eos> Don't tell him I said that.<eos> You spooked him.<eos> He won't talk.<eos> The FBI gave us one hour with him and we're at zero.<eos> That's what happens when a guy gets chased by a bunch of weirdos in a van covered in chicken feathers.<eos> The FBI searched his house, his storage locker, his records, everything, turned up nothing.<eos> The painting's worth $100 mil.<eos> If he doesn't talk fast, we'll never see it again.
We're talking wine, one of my specialties.<eos> Doesn't really matter right now.<eos> All we have is the word of an admitted forger.<eos> We'll never get a search warrant with that alone.<eos> I'll call in some favors and see if I can't get a wiretap, but that'll take some time.<eos> You hang tight until you receive further orders.<eos> I'll update you as soon as I have something.<eos> Okay.<eos> So Labeaux commissioned the fake, so we have to assume he has a real painting.<eos> Chances are he's trying to move it.
How could I have possibly known that was a wine cellar?<eos> The painting could be somewhere else in the house.<eos> No, not anymore.<eos> By now, Labeaux's found the broken wine bottles, he knows someone's hacked into the power.<eos> He knows we're onto him.<eos> He's gonna try and move that painting fast.<eos> Sylvester?<eos> You search his call history?<eos> Art world's supposed to be rarified air, but instead it's full of thieves.<eos> This guy stole it from the museum, who stole it from the Mueller family.
Sounds awfully real.<eos> Somewhere along the line, you had a breakthrough. You're improving.<eos> SYLVESTER: Okay, Labeaux made half a dozen calls to one number in the 48 hours before the original painting disappeared.<eos> The name is encrypted, but I think I can break it.<eos> In how long?<eos> That long.<eos> And I thought I didn't like him 'cause he was a know-it-all art jerk.<eos> Here's an e-mail from Labeaux to Paulson with his bank's routing and account numbers.<eos> Labeaux provides access to the fake, Paulson provides access to the original.<eos> We didn't find the painting at Labeaux's because he never had it. Paulson does.
What, like...?<eos> Handed in her notice.<eos> No-one knows where she is.<eos> Joe?<eos> - Joe!<eos> - No, leave him.<eos> I was still hopeful that she would get in touch, or at least remove the block so that I could contact her.<eos> But no.<eos> When there's a block, you can't even wallow properly.<eos> You can't switch it off.
You think that semicolon was a mistake?<eos> No, it was a juicy piece of bait and she unhinged her jaw and swallowed it whole.<eos> So, you wanted her to say no to us?<eos> Rejecting a valid request for such a petty reason? That's all the ammunition I need to go over her head.<eos> I secretly scheduled us a one-on-one with Madeline's boss, Chief Fisker.<eos> You want to hear the funniest thing ever?<eos> I also split an infinitive and she didn't notice.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Did you check out the department video camera by any chance?<eos> Yeah, I was going to take it home and videotape the top of my head.

Cool.<eos> So, I accidentally left a tape in there, and I... I want it back.
Thank you.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Are you okay, sir?<eos> I don't want to sound dramatic, but today has been sub-optimal.<eos> That doesn't leave this office.<eos> Wuntch beat me, the squad was a disaster, and in the end, do you know who I'm angriest with?<eos> Yourself?<eos> No.<eos> Wuntch.<eos> I need this task force to succeed, and there's not a detective here who is adult enough to lead it.
So, what now?<eos> Are we done?<eos> I'd like to go to the hospital.<eos> You sit tight.<eos> We're gonna check out your story.<eos> Okay? Get out of here!<eos> You're drunk!<eos> Go home!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Buzz, would you make a copy of this and send it to Lieutenant Provenza, see if anyone in Keisha's family knows this young man?
You're a good boy.<eos> Your mother, she'd be proud of the man you're growing up to be.<eos> Give me another puff.<eos> Will ya?<eos> Ya know, now don't take offense.<eos> But the only thing worse than that mug of yours is your breath.<eos> Not my fingers, you animal!<eos> I was offering you the last hit.<eos> Well, fine.<eos> I'll bogart it myself then.
Okay, just an FYI, words like that make my eye twitch.<eos> Look, we're trying to articulate U.S. policy on a broad variety of topics, so the speech has been vetted...<eos> By various departments and agencies.<eos> I know.<eos> I...<eos> Not to mention, we have to factor in the positions of our allies to avoid offending them.<eos> And trying to fit that all in one speech is, like... super hard.<eos> Well put.<eos> Ma'am, this speech is in two days.<eos> We need to finalize it.
And he's one failed test away from flunking out.<eos> Ooh, but don't take my word for it.<eos> Hey, Turk.<eos> 70 yards passing, not bad!<eos> Oh, Chugga-Brew.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> Uh, I'm busy, Turk.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> This vertex of the para-boola is driving me nuts.<eos> You're the only one who can explain it to me.
And Turk's.<eos> You needed it to save Mason.<eos> You're the one who killed Turk and Messner.<eos> Your original plan wasn't too bad.<eos> I mean, you heard the rumblings around school that Turk was looking for the Chem IV test answers.<eos> It's pretty easy, setting him up.<eos> This is you entering the school library at 1:16. That's the same day that Chet Messner was killed.<eos> And at 1:19, you logged on to a computer using Hannah Hunt's password.<eos> You logged on to VidTree, and you sent a message to Rob Turkla.<eos> Telling him where to find the cheat sheet, but Messner found it instead.
We've been trying to reach you.<eos> Where the hell were you?<eos> I waited at the drop site for an hour.<eos> Calm down, Mr. Creel.<eos> There's no need to panic.<eos> We're being cautious now that S.H.I.E.L.D. is a factor.<eos> Forget them.<eos> I got a real problem.<eos> That thing really messed me up.<eos> I turned to rubber when I touched it.
I'm not gonna throw my life away.<eos> I'm... sorry.<eos> The bathtub in Daycia's room was already full, so I thought, why not... why not just make it look like an accident?<eos> Make it look like she just... slipped away.<eos> I put her in the water.<eos> I got the piece of tubing from the fish tank, and I made it look like she drowned.<eos> Insane part of this whole thing is, I made it, you know that?<eos> I didn't drink.<eos> Even after she was dead and it was quiet in that room.<eos> I took that bottle, and I poured it in the toil... toilet.
But for me...<eos> So I need something to be good.<eos> I need a reason to get up every morning, to not crawl back to that cave that I was in before I met her.<eos> I mean, you know she saved me?<eos> You were there.<eos> You remember how I was.<eos> I was... dark.<eos> That war made me dark.<eos> And that darkness... it is still in me.<eos> She just lit it up.
Joe gravano,<eos> Local mob boss, wanted for 39 counts of murder, Racketeering, and drug smuggling.<eos> One of the most heavily protected men in starling city.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> What's "n.P.P.?"<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can definitely find out.<eos> Where are we with the cell phone from her apartment?<eos> Crazy pants encrypted the sim card.<eos> I can crack it, but it's going to take some time.
They describe him?<eos> Young, male, Caucasian.<eos> Wearing a backpack.<eos> Nothing more than that.<eos> Think they were staring at the knife and not his face.<eos> We do have a photograph of him fleeing one of the thefts, but... it is useless.<eos> Why?<eos> It was taken by a tourist near the Vietnam Memorial.<eos> Unfortunately, it only shows the back of his head.<eos> I'd get it to NCIS.
The results may surprise you it appears Lucie is not your daughter<eos> Whose daughter is she?<eos> Zacharie Gabaï's<eos> - Did you never suspect?<eos> - No<eos> But why would he kill them?<eos> There's a lot we still don't know<eos> Did you want to say something?<eos> When Lucie was little... a parcel arrived on her birthday<eos> When Sandrine saw where it came from... she threw it in the bin
I told you, it was stolen<eos> What do you know about the car?<eos> I lost my job two years ago<eos> I didn't need a car... and I couldn't afford the petrol anyway<eos> I advertised, but couldn't find a buyer<eos> So... I reported it and said it was stolen<eos> I got 600 Euros from the insurance<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> In the car park<eos> - I still use it sometimes
Move!<eos> I'm gonna make this simple:<eos> give us the acetate, or everyone dies.<eos> What acetate?<eos> Don't waste my time.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's very dangerous.<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> - Give it to us!
Midnite's men.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> That recording... it's got a demonic energy. It wants to be played.<eos> Once it gets in their heads, they won't be able to resist.<eos> - You bring my bag?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's in the back of the truck.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Bastards.<eos> They took it to a club, gave it a spin.
Ian, no.<eos> I won't let you do this.<eos> What?<eos> Cancer?<eos> Yeah, sure, 20 years ago I didn't have a shot.<eos> But they have better treatments today.<eos> And now I got a lot more to fight for.<eos> All right, rat boy, you're up.<eos> You're the one that brokered this deal.<eos> You're the only one who can break it.
I'd like to report a murder.<eos> Please!<eos> Stop! Don't!<eos> No!<eos> No...!<eos> He's killing her right now.<eos> He wants us to hear him do it.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Got a cell tower.<eos> Phone's pinging off it.
I've got all the last guy's caseload, plus new patients.<eos> There's almost no time for research.<eos> Yes, I've made friends.<eos> "What are their names," mom?<eos> My record for the Friday New York Times crossword Is 11 minutes... when I was 13.<eos> I'm still trying to beat that.<eos> Why do I need to make friends?<eos> I'm here to run a department.<eos> Okay, that sounds braggy.<eos> I just mean once I pick a puzzle up, I can't put it down until it's solved.
Ah... my office.<eos> Either that or, Martin, can your car fit two?<eos> Post-divorce, I had a rebound fling with a 16-stone lady trucker called Fat Pat.<eos> Romancing a woman of that size in the back of the flame-red Tigo could prove taxing.<eos> Getting her bra and truss off alone was a three-man job.<eos> Luckily she had a friend - Mick, her husband.<eos> Dark days!<eos> I'll probably just rent.<eos> Dad! About your car...<eos> Before you see it, can you just remember that I was really, really angry.
I apologize.<eos> It's a recent development.<eos> Abe sort of absconded with this ledger.<eos> Problem is, the customers are written in some sort of code.<eos> You're saying he stole it?<eos> "Borrowed."<eos> The antique weaponry game is a cutthroat business.<eos> But I'm sure I can crack the code, given enough time.<eos> If Devin Bentley's name is in here, that's all the evidence we need to arrest him.<eos> Yeah, until the court finds out that you obtained this evidence illegally, and they throw it out... Devin will walk.
Honey, it doesn't seem like the Griffins are leaving anytime too soon!<eos> Oh. Hey, Peter.<eos> Hey, Joe. What are all these pictures?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> They're just some stupid scribbles I've been working on for a children's book.<eos> I don't think that's stupid.<eos> I think that's awesome!<eos> I mean, my one note on these would be to hide a bunch of dongs in the backgrounds, but, otherwise, I think they're great!<eos> Wow. Well, that really means a lot to me, Peter.<eos> I've been working on this book for nine years, but I've been too afraid to show it to anybody.
And?<eos> Mrs. Wilcox, do you remember anything unusual about the night Tommy disappeared?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> Are you absolutely sure?<eos> There's nothing.<eos> Anything might help.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Toilet paper maybe.<eos> Sorry, ma'am?<eos> I went to the store to buy toilet paper and when I got back I couldn't find it.
Yeah, well, you got to go to Boston to get it...<eos> I know you can't feel, but you were shot in the chest.<eos> You need to get to a hospital.<eos> Bullet missed my lungs, went through.<eos> I'll be okay.<eos> And you know too much about getting shot.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Slow down, tiger.<eos> Remember that black blob you saw floating out of the police station?<eos> Mara called it aether.

This television program is the comprehensive account of their relationship... From A to Z.<eos> Stu: I don't believe it.<eos> What?<eos> Is that tea?<eos> Yeah, Zelda got me into it.<eos> Oh! Did she?<eos> So, you're a tea drinker now, huh?<eos> Drinking tea?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> There was, but we fixed it with the Revolutionary War.
Zelda's song had already been listened to by 11 Wallflower employees, including Silent Arnold, who secretly ripped every song...<eos> Minus the Kate Hudson album.<eos> Silent Arnold shares his library with the entire office park, which is how it was heard by...<eos> Cool song, Zelda.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> There's the rock star.<eos> Yes!<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> Somebody must have yanked it from my computer...
Kind person.<eos> Get the hell out of my office.<eos> Okay.<eos> This traffic, huh?<eos> Like the Lakers are playing the Dodgers.<eos> I don't really feel like talking right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> My phone is linked up to my stereo, so...<eos> It says you played it 53 times?
Well, for starters, it turns out it is world pneumonia day.<eos> But we're also checking into any news events, births, deaths that occurred on that day.<eos> If it even is a date.<eos> 11, 12, 13 could be part of a number sequence.<eos> Yes, Castle, we're also looking into that, as well as anyone Garrett put away while he was in cyber.<eos> Detective Beckett?<eos> I was able to identify one of the images.<eos> It was cropped from this photo of a food blogger named Mary Fuchs.<eos> Where did you find that photo?<eos> She posted it on her Snappamatic feed a few days ago.
That's okay.<eos> Try again.<eos> Wow!<eos> I'm learning.<eos> And games are making it fun.<eos> What would you like to talk about?<eos> I'd rather just click your face.<eos> You are so funny!<eos> Man, this game is amazing.<eos> I don't know why anyone abandoned it.
Soos!<eos> We saw the whole thing, Soos.<eos> That was amazing! You talked to a real girl.<eos> - And you got a date!<eos> Ah! This is the best day of my life!<eos> You were in the zone, you made eye contact.<eos> It was like you'd done this a million times before!<eos> Don't you see? That game really worked!<eos> You don't need it anymore!<eos> - You can toss it out!
I could have you...<eos> That won't stick, and you know it.<eos> Hasn't this office been embarrassed enough?<eos> I didn't hear you deny it.<eos> I didn't come here to negotiate.<eos> I came to say good-bye.<eos> Who knows-- could be another 15 years until we see each other again.<eos> Take care, Erin.<eos> The tape.<eos> You haven't seen it, have you?
Oh.<eos> I have some ice for that at home.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> So, what you're about to see is a work in progress.<eos> Emphasis on the word progress.<eos> Which, uh, on my note card here is written in capital letters and underlined.<eos> I helped him come up with that.<eos> Okay, so a couple years back Addison introduced me to a little book called Moby Dick.<eos> I... I just, I loved it, and I wanted to see if there was a way we could bring its epic scale to a more intimate dimension with our bodies, and we're just now at a place where we're looking to get some feedback.
I guess there's somebody around here She's not ready to say goodbye to.<eos> He friended me!<eos> Okay, come on. We have something to show you.<eos> Is it dinner, or is my mouth too ugly to put food in?<eos> Okay, no.<eos> And please don't say things like that about yourself.<eos> You picked one?<eos> We sure did, and we're sorry we made you feel bad.<eos> We just weren't used to your new smile,<eos> But now we are, and we love it!
Ben: It's a hoodoo spiritual trap used in ritual.<eos> The iron in the nails attracts evil spirits, and the moss and the leaves grabs a hold of them.<eos> Yeah, but what about the white powder, and what's this?<eos> That's the talisman which marks the trap, and the powder creates a trail to lead the evil spirits to it.<eos> How do you know all this?<eos> My grandmother practiced brujeria.<eos> Janice:<eos> Refers to Latin American witchcraft.<eos> Beth: It had been there a while untouched, and the house does have a history.<eos> So somebody could've left it there for protection.
- It's fru...<eos> It's frustrating.<eos> - So frustrating.<eos> Let me ask you something, guys, haveou er considered modeling?<eos> Now, that would be a great way to share your beauty with the world.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - What?<eos> Winston, we're grown men with real jobs.<eos> Modeling is a real job and, trust me,<eos> - neither one of you could do it.
You're just gonna make them worry.<eos> I was thinking of doing a colonic interposition.<eos> I fix the kid in one surgery, he can go home sooner.<eos> No, using the native esophagus is better.<eos> It's a prolonged hospital stay, but...<eos> We could have him in a coma for weeks, maybe months.<eos> I mean, that'll put the parents through hell.<eos> Using the colon has increased risks of stricture, anastomotic leaks, GERD.<eos> I mean, it's not fun to watch your kid go through that, either.<eos> Are you gonna let me do my job, or are you gonna do it for me the whole time?
Thank you.<eos> And no, I will not hold a press conference.<eos> But the story's out there.<eos> And the usual anti-cop suspects are already making noise.<eos> Ask the mayor's staff to field it.<eos> They won't; you know that.<eos> Ask the manufacturer of the camera to stand up there.<eos> Oh, now you're just being...<eos> Did the camera malfunction?<eos> Did our officer turn it off?
He must've hit his head.<eos> To me, sounds like a clean arrest with an unfortunate outcome.<eos> I didn't mean to hurt him.<eos> He escalated the situation.<eos> I mean, you hit a cop, all bets are off.<eos> Sure would be nice if we had the rest of the incident on video.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I've been wearing that camera for almost three weeks.<eos> I've never had a problem before.<eos> And you didn't turn it off so you could tune up James Prince without an audience?
Yeah.<eos> Hannah had reached out to her.<eos> The dean asked me to collect physical evidence from the girl's dorm room.<eos> Wait.<eos> What evidence?<eos> Hannah still had the skirt she wore that night.<eos> It was torn up pretty good.<eos> Had what looked like bloodstains on it.<eos> Where's that skirt now?<eos> I delivered it to the dean's office.
Who she had only known for a few hours.<eos> That doesn't excuse what he did.<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> But in the end the only one who can keep you safe is you.<eos> You're not listening.<eos> I'm saying it's over.<eos> The manufacturer found a faulty sensor in Officer Taylor's body camera.<eos> I am listening, but how does that make it over?<eos> The camera malfunctioned.<eos> Taylor didn't turn it off.
Is there a problem?<eos> I still don't have anyone to go with me to the mayor's reception for the AG.<eos> That is a problem.<eos> You sure you won't reconsider?<eos> Who have you asked?<eos> A few people.<eos> Name two.<eos> How's your case going?<eos> My investigator just delivered Hannah's torn skirt from the night of the attack.<eos> The dean of students apologized for not turning it over right away.
You studied the mysteries of this town and wrote this book.<eos> Dude, you're the genius Dipper's been searching for all summer.<eos> Uh, genius?<eos> I'm no genius.<eos> I never done nothin' worthwhile in my life.<eos> Everyone knows I'm no good to nobody.<eos> I can't remember what I used to be, but I must've been a big failure to end up like this.<eos> But the laptop has your name on it.<eos> What about this book?<eos> Are you sure you didn't write it?
Ah. The bodies just disintegrate.<eos> I saw references to this weapon in HYDRA's lab.<eos> Yeah, sent from their demolitions expert,<eos> - uh, Toshiro...<eos> - Toshiro Mori.<eos> I've crossed paths with him before.<eos> He has a lab in Okinawa.<eos> Good.<eos> Then that's where you're going.<eos> We need to find the location of the next attack and stop it before it happens.
I've been better.<eos> It's one thing for your girlfriend to get you into a gallery show, another to get people to buy.<eos> Is that why you asked David to sell your pieces to Bridget Michaels?<eos> I'm sorry, who?<eos> - Will? - Problem was, in order to launder the money<eos> David could only sell Bridget pieces that she could resell later.<eos> David told you he was only going to sell to Bridget one more time, so you went to that poker game in order to convince him that his last sale should be one of your pieces.<eos> We even know which one.<eos> I bet that you used framer's glue to attach those crystals.<eos> You showed David this piece, he refused to take it, you lost your temper, and you took a swing.
- Let's walk before we can run, huh, pal?<eos> Hey, Winston, he's asking about bleach!<eos> Man, that is way too soon.<eos> - Warm-warm, warm-cold...<eos> - You got this, don't get flustered!<eos> Cold-cold, hot-cold, hot-hot?<eos> It's hot-hot!<eos> - It's always warm-cold.<eos> - Well, what's "permanent press"?<eos> - Fake button, nobody uses it.

The...<eos> Everybody here is a roofer.<eos> Look, the last time I saw you, I kissed you.<eos> I know that.<eos> We both know that.<eos> But this can't happen.<eos> Are we attracted to each other? Yes!<eos> Do I sing Oasis songs to myself, and pretend that they were inspired by your love for me?<eos> But my job is to enforce the rules.<eos> And I love my job, and I worked hard to get it.
Well, congratulations on having sisters, but I know women.<eos> You blindfold me, spin me around and drop me into a rainstorm, and I'll still find the G-spot.<eos> - Let us not forget that I had boobs for the first 19 years of my life.<eos> I grew up as a fat, asexual friend-zoner.<eos> You can't buy that kind of access.<eos> Schmidt, I'm talking about how women act towards other women.<eos> - You don't want to get in the middle of that.<eos> - Coach...<eos> Jess has the purse.<eos> I saw it in her closet when it was rainy and I was bored and I was feeling snoopy.
If she's worth it.<eos> I mean, when she comes in, she comes in and just goes,<eos> "Well, you've done that all wrong.<eos> "Been waiting six months for you to get that finished and it's wrong.<eos> "Do it again.<eos> I should have got somebody in to do it."<eos> LAUGHTER Anyway, the male puffer fish attracts his lady with a heart exhibition.<eos> Now, what do we call a fish that drives a tank?<eos> Tank fish.<eos> You might call it tank fish, but when I say "we", I mean WE.
So they only needed a minute to get through that wall.<eos> They attach a transmitter to catch a signal to open the gate, which is then sent to a cell phone.<eos> A transmitter is small.<eos> But a cell phone?<eos> Nothing that big could get in or out of my prison.<eos> Except convicts.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, has this door been opened anytime over the last few days?<eos> Antonovich dropped a can of cleanser through the bars, and we opened it to let him get it.
If there's a bigger plan at play here, what is it?<eos> HAPPY: Hold on.<eos> Rewind that.<eos> Look at Percy's hands.<eos> He's messing with something behind his back.<eos> He took this number five from the price sign and stuck it next to the "X."<eos> And he pushed it all the way to the right from the middle of the rack.<eos> Why?<eos> Okay, the "X" is Roman for ten, plus five is 15.<eos> He wasn't pushing it right, he was pushing it east.
PT repeated.<eos> It's got to be initials.<eos> Peyton Temple.<eos> Peyton Temple was a name found on Reid's phone records.<eos> Well, if he wrote this, I'd like to ask him what he was using the equation to optimize.<eos> You... you'd like to ask him?<eos> This could be the killer.<eos> This could be anyone.<eos> How's your handle on Frame Invocation Theory?<eos> Because he used it in this equationC#, and it might be helpful to understand it fully.
The death of William's parents probably triggered a psychosis.<eos> Idolization of a dominant role model in the wake of tragedy could often blur the lines between right and wrong.<eos> Like Slenderman.<eos> Childhood imagination took precedence over social norms.<eos> I'll tell Hotch.<eos> I'll tell Garcia.<eos> Agent Morgan.<eos> Is this my fault?<eos> He looked up to you when there was no one else to look up to.<eos> I think he probably saw your obsession with the Mirror Man legend and just decided to bring it to life.
Yes, you did.<eos> You hit her and you killed her friend.<eos> Mom, she's telling the truth.<eos> No. Had she been paying attention, none of this would have happened.<eos> I had the right of way.<eos> The ground was wet.<eos> Mom, please-- Shut up!<eos> Whose side are you on?<eos> You ruined my life.<eos> Washed it into the gutter.
Ok.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> ♪ Gone forever, we don't know ♪<eos> ♪ like a prayer ♪<eos> ♪ the circle lost somehow along the way ♪<eos> ♪ why are you gone? ♪ ♪ Lost me ♪<eos> It's not that I don't want to be married.<eos> I just don't want to stay here.<eos> My job is here, David.<eos> And I'm not asking you to leave it.
Worst party ever, by the way.<eos> Uh, worse than being at a dance club That has a price club?<eos> Max Black in the house of grain.<eos> And now he saw me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna go hide before she sees me.<eos> I'll be in Tom's Shoes.<eos> Nobody's ever over there.<eos> I'm bustin' out some free range electronic dance music.<eos> That's right!<eos> I'm bringing it in my own bag.
That'll be $28.<eos> There's only $14 here.<eos> $28 for a salad?<eos> Well, that's dinosaur kale.<eos> Oh!<eos> Mistake.<eos> Didn't want the Dinosaur kale.<eos> Never liked dinosaurs and really don't like them in my kale.<eos> Dinosaur kale gone.<eos> You're just putting it on the counter?
He needs to take accountability.<eos> Moving on.<eos> (thumps coffeepot on table)<eos> So... nothing on Tina's cell phone? No. No threatening voice mails or text messages and every outside call came from a disposable.<eos> Well, Little G did say this nutjob preferred to scare her in public. Yeah.<eos> Stalking with a personal touch.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> He knows Jamie from the business card.<eos> Then he would have to touch it or put his hands on it to read the name, right?<eos> So if we get the card from the property clerk and we run it for prints...
Nah, I was at work until midnight.<eos> You can ask my employees.<eos> Yeah, they'll alibi for you.<eos> You're their boss.<eos> Yeah, and of course you're gonna try to railroad somebody 'cause you're the cop's brother.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I heard her call you Reagan.<eos> Same name that's on that card.<eos> So, you admit you saw it.<eos> Yeah, Tina showed it to me. So what?
We do have something in common here, Pop.<eos> We do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Our obituaries are gonna start the same way...<eos> Whoa, Dad!<eos> "Former New York City Police Commissioner."<eos> So? So?<eos> !<eos> For better or worse, it defines us.<eos> So, respect the office, even if you're not in it anymore.
You still at it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Cars can be stubborn.<eos> That ain't the only thing.<eos> I've been thinking why you haven't fixed the car yet.<eos> What'd you come up with?<eos> Well, if the car doesn't work, Linda's gonna keep calling.<eos> Keeps her in your life.<eos> Once it's fixed, less reason to call. Ah. Not going to Linda.<eos> I'm selling it.
Wait.<eos> You met my mother?<eos> And your dear papa as well.<eos> A very regal couple.<eos> The fact they thought I wouldn't recognize royalty was charmingly naive of them.<eos> Honestly, I liked them.<eos> Sold them the star at cost, actually.<eos> The Wishing Star?<eos> That doesn't make sense.<eos> If they had it, they would've used it to take away Elsa's magic.
It's tiny!<eos> How am I supposed to feed eleven people with this pigeon!<eos> Hey dad.<eos> How is it coming?<eos> Great!<eos> Just some last-minute touches, and we're good to go.<eos> Great.<eos> Panic in Turkey Town.<eos> The back-up turkey is in Lily's book bag.<eos> Bring it to me.
There was gunshot residue on his right hand, his gun was found beside him, and he had a blood tox level of .23.<eos> Tell me, please, what is it about this that doesn't indicate suicide?<eos> In the tox report, Sara found a peak from the GC that was never analyzed.<eos> Got that tox report right here.<eos> What peak are we talking about?<eos> That one.<eos> That's minor.<eos> It has the same retention time as ibuprofen.<eos> That's why it wasn't analyzed.<eos> Could be, but you can't be sure unless you do a Mass Spec, so please, Doc, just pull the blood for me. Retest it.
- He's perfectly fine.<eos> Aren't you, archie?<eos> - [weakly] yeah.<eos> - Ma'am, given that he's a minor, I'm making the call to transport your son to the hospital.<eos> Now, you're welcome to ride with us if you like.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Can i have a word?<eos> - Sure. What's up, candidate?<eos> - I trained on sledge at the academy.<eos> You didn't have to yank it out of my hands.
OK. Copy<eos> Come on<eos> OK?<eos> Yeah<eos> Nothing to report<eos> Bugger all<eos> We've lost him.<eos> Shit<eos> Why didn't you take your car?<eos> Christine took it
Look.<eos> Color is consistent with Reed's uniform.<eos> I think we found our point of entry.<eos> Well, if we did, we didn't just stumble upon it.<eos> You don't just dump a body here by chance.<eos> Whoever did this knows the area.<eos> I wonder who owns the property.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> Here's the information on that property.<eos> Oliver financed it through the trust, purchased a year ago, recently rented to the moonshiner.
Thanks.<eos> I kind of have a headache now.<eos> Excuse me, spirit?<eos> Can I talk to... And you're gone.<eos> Just like all the other spirits.<eos> They're abandoning the city.<eos> So let me ask you about metalbending.<eos> Su tried to teach me, but I couldn't get the hang of it.<eos> I used to have an academy to train metalbending.<eos> Even blockheads like you can figure it out with the right instruction.
You ask me every time you throw my trust issues in my face.<eos> You did it this morning and you did it 20 years ago.<eos> I sat 10 years in jail alone.<eos> What were you proving then?<eos> Or did you not know that I was innocent?<eos> Of course I knew.<eos> Then where the hell were you?<eos> September 1st, 1993.<eos> That date is etched in my memory.<eos> I said it over and over, even after it passed and you were in prison.
Which else...?<eos> Oh, yes, Ted Sorensen was JFK's speech writer, who came up with perhaps his most famous phrase that he used in his inauguration.<eos> "Ask not what you can do for your..." No...<eos> "Ask not what your country can do for you..."<eos> Have a kebab.<eos> "..but what you can do for your country."<eos> Known as a chiasmus, exactly, and a fine example of one.<eos> And that was written by Sorensen.<eos> And Ronald Reagan said of his autobiography, do you know what he said?<eos> He looked forward to reading it.

"I hear it's a terrific book.<eos> I look forward to reading it."
Don't be ridiculous, dearie.<eos> When Belle and Henry wake up tomorrow morning in New York City, they won't remember a thing about tonight.<eos> I'll tell then the Snow Queen destroyed Storybrooke, whilst I saved everyone I could.<eos> I won't be a villain.<eos> I'll be a hero.<eos> _<eos> Stop.<eos> This must end, Ingrid.<eos> Our magic is a part of us now.<eos> We control it, and we control it really well.
When in Rome.<eos> Claudine Bouchard.<eos> Wanted for murder in Colombia.<eos> Suspected of killing heavily protected witnesses and five innocent bystanders.<eos> Collateral damage doesn't seem to be an issue with her.<eos> Witness was supposed to testify against the cartel.<eos> After that, Claudine left Colombia, flew to Amsterdam, then vanished.<eos> Well, now she's un-vanished.<eos> So this Claudine Bouchard... hires Drayer... to break into Bell's computer, steal some kind of information about Admiral Hume.<eos> Once she gets it...
Some of the subjects were quite traumatized and resentful.<eos> And... maybe vengeful?<eos> Some.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm gonna need those video files, along with the names of those subjects.<eos> I'm sorry, but that information falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Okay, Skinner.<eos> My simulated sun is shining.<eos> My blood is in the soil pack.<eos> Now let us see how these plants absorb it.
- She'll love it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hello.<eos> Madame?<eos> We have a lovely new collection of lingerie.<eos> It's over in intimate apparel.<eos> I'm not interested in lingerie today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If I may, our line is conservative with just a touch of naughty.<eos> We call it the Judi Fench collection.
I don't know if he owned the place, but I'm pretty sure he owned the box.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> My guess, halfway to Chicago Med.<eos> He was pretty banged up when they loaded him into the ambo.<eos> Hey, call dispatch, get a twenty on that ambulance.<eos> I want somebody with that guy when they roll into Chicago Med.<eos> So you didn't touch the box or its contents?<eos> No.<eos> Didn't open it?<eos> Pretty hard to do without touching it.
I take a spin class.<eos> I thought I could get some fresh air for a change.<eos> It's a gorgeous morning, isn't it?<eos> You know, I was only gonna go like another 3 miles, but I can stretch it out if you want to join.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I mean, uh, thank you.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just picked up a new audiobook.<eos> - Oprah recommended it.
Can't you see that?<eos> I mean, ugh!<eos> Why didn't anybody stop him?<eos> !<eos> All right, listen... call Hunt or any trauma surgeon that's on call.<eos> - On it.<eos> - Graham, move.<eos> Move!<eos> Your mother had a spinal-fluid leak.<eos> I was able to stop it without opening up her skull.
It's like working inside a beaver dam.<eos> Oh no, a next-to-desk-sit-down.<eos> Santiago, you're putting yourself under too much pressure.<eos> And that stress is making it even harder for you to quit.<eos> Some things might come easier to you if you stop being such a perfectionist.<eos> A concept you should become familiar with.<eos> "Familiar with?"<eos> Mm. A dangling preposition?<eos> I'm setting an example.<eos> I made an error and I'm not going to correct it.
Did anybody hear me screaming?<eos> There was a crazy amount of bugs flying at my face.<eos> Bobby, calm down.<eos> We caught the ghost.<eos> His name is Jeff.<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> Everything is not fine, Lin.<eos> We have a horrible bug problem in there, and I'm sick of all this ghost stuff.<eos> Ghost stuff is over.<eos> Now we do the ceremonial throwing it away in the trash.
I found him on the ground.<eos> You should really be more careful.<eos> Great.<eos> Now he's got ground on him.<eos> Sorry the candle smells like lavender.<eos> Kind of changes the vibe a little bit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm feeling really relaxed all of a sudden.<eos> The door slammed shut!<eos> Well, somebody open it!
Anyway, ignore her.<eos> Everyone's on edge with the contagion spreading throughout town.<eos> But it only targets troubled people, Rebecca has a free pass.<eos> Well, the disease sets off troubles without needing any emotional prompting.<eos> Every troubled person could go off soon.<eos> So no one in Haven is safe.<eos> Over 15 people already have the first stage of the contagion.<eos> Pete's over at the morgue right now keeping an eye on them.<eos> Soon, all their troubles will be activated and any one of those could claim multiple lives.<eos> So it's a race, stop the contagion and find the troubled person causing it before all the troubles go off.
Oh, hey, and look!<eos> I also got this rock.<eos> Hey, Wirt, want to learn some rock facts?<eos> So, you want to go look for frogs with me like you said you would awhile ago and haven't done it yet?<eos> - Nah.<eos> Nah, I'm busy.<eos> - Is that bee named Sara?<eos> - W-What?<eos> - Your tape says "for Sara."<eos> Are you gonna give it to Sara the bee?
- That tape has got poetry and clarinet on it, Greg.<eos> Poetry and clarinet! Sara and Jason Funderberker are gonna start dating, and then they'll hear that tape, and then they'll just sit and listen to it and laugh and laugh - and laugh and laugh.<eos> - Why don't you ask Sara out first? - That way ...<eos> - No, no!<eos> Ugh!<eos> Why did you have to take the tape?<eos> - My life is crumbling all around me!<eos> - Okay, I think we should put our frog hunt on hold and go get that tape back.<eos> - Guys, where's the tape?<eos> - We put it in Sara's jacket for you.
Didn't it, Rudy?<eos> So you killed him and took the only thing that was worth something.<eos> Look, I wasn't the only one whose face Izzy was in that night.<eos> Did he happen to tell you where all this money was coming from?<eos> Ever since I've known him, Izzy claimed that his pops was the one who really wrote "6 A.M.," that Lionel Hubbard, jazz legend, cheated him out of a single.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> Killing someone literally for a song?<eos> It's not just a song.<eos> "6 A.M." changed everything.<eos> That track broke all the rules, changing keys and time signatures as if the person who wrote it had so much joy inside his heart he couldn't pick just one way to let it out.
Came back three days later.<eos> They had written me out of everything.<eos> Why didn't you fight it?<eos> Take Al to court.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> My son's dead.<eos> I never should have told him that story.<eos> Um... Where did you find that?<eos> In your son's car.<eos> You recognize it?
Bud Gray had a record deal, whole career ahead of him.<eos> Why would he kill a guy over royalties of one song?<eos> He didn't want his father, the great Lionel Hubbard, to go down in jazz history as a fraud.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> I thought you should have this.<eos> I don't care about the money.<eos> Whatever's on it has caused my family a lot of pain.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just...<eos> I thought you should know that he wrote it for you.
- Fucking pensioners<eos> They'll brag that they used to foster kids and can take care of Léo<eos> No one cares that they were a foster family<eos> This is about you and your ability to care for Léo<eos> These accusations of multiple partners - are they true?<eos> Of course not!<eos> This is rubbish.<eos> They're gunning for me<eos> They say it wasn't the first time you'd taken Sandrine's bank card<eos> I didn't take it.
- A pretty black girl of about 20<eos> Now that things have died down, maybe she'll come back<eos> - And the robbers?<eos> - No.<eos> We don't know them it's the third time they've raided cash points here it's often for small change<eos> They've taken about 30,000 Euros.<eos> Not much, considering the risks<eos> The hooded guy on fire...<eos> The picture isn't very clear but if you enlarge it...<eos> The judge has sent it to the lab.
- Please Mrs. Dewar.<eos> Mr. Hume, you reported the fictitious Randolph Sampson missing.<eos> Mr. Sampson is my employer, sir.<eos> He is away on business.<eos> I borrowed his office.<eos> And his good name.<eos> The torn pages from the novel led me to your bookshop, Mrs. Dewar, And you in turn led me to Ruby Rosevear and Annie Cranston, who furthered the myth of the Bearded Man.<eos> I was led to a series of clues including Blue Sky, and the photograph which featured you, Miss Cranston, and the mysterious Mr. Maxwell, which was in fact, you, Mr. Barnes, with a false beard.<eos> It wasn't false.<eos> - I grew it especially for the part.
I need to see you<eos> Now isn't a good time<eos> Come on, it won't take long<eos> Have I ever let you down?<eos> OK.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I knew we were mates<eos> What's this car?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Just help me shift it
I promise<eos> That kid means nothing to me if she dies, it'll be your fault<eos> This is all your fault<eos> You told me not to pay<eos> That's why we're in this mess<eos> Where's her bag?<eos> You want to help with her homework?<eos> Where is it?<eos> - In the van<eos> - Go and get it

Leave me.<eos> Leave France.<eos> You're listed here as a Catholic,<eos> - self-declared.<eos> - I am that.<eos> A believer good and true, I swore it.<eos> Then why are there witnesses, your brethren, who swear they've seen you attending Protestant services?<eos> It's not true; they're lying!<eos> The only liar here is you.<eos> The Bible says, "If your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off.
What is it?<eos> It's Kitty.<eos> The police have indeed found Mr. Zupko.<eos> Oh, that's a good thing, isn't it?<eos> The good news is it looks like Zupko was our guy.<eos> We found all the maps that were taken from the library. Including the Bray map.<eos> It was the only one that was laid out.<eos> Zupko must have been standing here.<eos> Obviously, he was examining the map when he was killed.<eos> Or displaying it for a buyer.
You wanted to roll a one-day story into a fight.<eos> I didn't know you threatened to stab a teacher.<eos> The story was already out. Well, so?<eos> They didn't offer me any context.<eos> They just asked me if I would prosecute a woman for threatening to stab a teacher, and, yes, oddly enough,<eos> I said yes. I...<eos> I didn't know it was about you.<eos> Then correct it.<eos> - Correct what?<eos> - Tell the Correspondent that you know what I wrote was a joke, and that they were wrong to take it out of context.
Never a dull moment in the illegal sport of cock magic.<eos> Let's rejoin the battle now as we wait for gadnuk's six move.<eos> Gadnuk, Breaker of worlds, plays a creature card.<eos> Jesus, paragon of fierce defiance.<eos> Now every red creature gadnuk plays will have a plus-one attack.<eos> Come on, Kenny.<eos> What did he play?<eos> - Did he tap all his mana? - Dude, he just cast psychogenic probe.<eos> Now every time the other rooster has to shuffle his deck, he loses two health.<eos> He just had to shuffle it. - Did you hear that?
My theory is that it was moved.<eos> In certain cultures, rebel factions will display corpses as a show of power.<eos> U.S. serviceman would offer the ultimate bragging right.<eos> Question is: where did they move it to?<eos> Hey.<eos> Been looking for you.<eos> Oh, just had to get some air.<eos> Heard we got a lead on the jacket.<eos> Barely.<eos> Len Bowers said he bought it from some rug importer named Hameed.
Where'd you get it?<eos> At the port.<eos> Here in New Orleans?<eos> In Karachi.<eos> I visit a few times a year to get rugs to sell.<eos> There is a boy, Sami-- he helps me load cargo.<eos> He was wearing the coat.<eos> Why'd you want it?<eos> There's a market for these things, and I'm a businessman.<eos> This boy, Sami-- where'd he get it?
It's a province about 100 klicks south of Daykundi, which is where the explosion occurred.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Navy LNO in Ghazni located the boy.<eos> They're patching him through right now.<eos> Agent Pride, Lieutenant Commander Blake Conner.<eos> We located the child wrangling odd jobs at the port.<eos> Hi, Sami.<eos> Wanted to ask you a few questions.<eos> Sami... do you remember this jacket?<eos> Can you tell me where you got it?
Gay Jim upstairs, and straight Jim across the hall who's only gay when he's drunk.<eos> "When is your space available?<eos> Always, sometimes, one time."<eos> Oh, just like our sex lives.<eos> Always for me, sometimes out of boredom, and one time for you.<eos> Earl, guess what Max and I did. I know what you didn't do.<eos> Clean this dessert carousel.<eos> There's a Napoleon in here since Napoleon.<eos> We rented our apartment on Airbnb.<eos> You rented to Arabs? Well, good luck getting it back.
- So does it then say, "Are you sure?" - On the third screen... - Are you sure?<eos> Come on now.<eos> - In 15 seconds...<eos> Have you seen the word "die"?<eos> ..you will be given a lethal injection.<eos> Press yes to proceed.<eos> - It's that simple.<eos> - That's heavy, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> SANDI: And where do you get it, Amazon?
- is obviously illegal.<eos> - It is frowned upon.<eos> Dealt with by magistrates.<eos> - If I had to lose a liver, I mean, sorry, not a liver...<eos> - A kidney.<eos> - A kidney, yeah.<eos> - Don't lose your liver.<eos> How many livers have you got?<eos> A liver transplant, maybe.<eos> I might give my old liver to someone and say, "By all means fry it up with some onions if you want to."
Oh, sorry.<eos> Did you read Terry's book about us? No.<eos> He said not to read it.<eos> Okay, fine, I read it.<eos> My character, Cricket, is such a pushover.<eos> She just lets all the forest folk take her magic moose wishes.<eos> Well, June Bug is a stone-cold bitch.<eos> She told all the baby platy-pups they had weird feet.<eos> Is that how people see us?<eos> Well, you did just steal that danish out of my hand and start eating it.
We're not friends anymore.<eos> "Friends?"<eos> I don't care if you're friends.<eos> This is not a playdate.<eos> This is your commanding officer ordering you to do your job.<eos> Fine, but I hope you can live with the fact that you're forcing people to spend time together who would rather not.<eos> I'm fine with that.<eos> Sarge, I need to talk to you about the kid's book.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I'm wrapping it right now, and I need to focus.
And if we see him close up, you might notice...<eos> He's Tom Cruise.<eos> It's quite hard to see, but the front two, the left one is curled inwards a bit, but the right one is straight up, are actually penis legs.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What?<eos> He has eight legs like any spider, but the front two are penises and are charged with his seed.<eos> I've got a couple of them down under here.<eos> The old penis leg there.<eos> They're called pedipalps.<eos> And the thing he does, in order to get a better chance of shagging that enormous female, is he actually spins some silk and ties it round one of his penis legs and pulls, so that it basically pulls it off.
Doesn't make any sense.<eos> Why would Flynn replace his own gun with a toy?<eos> As you know, it's not uncommon for opioid addicts to spend thousands of dollars a week on pills.<eos> Or, roughly, the entire weekly salary of an NYPD patrolman.<eos> Flynn sold everything he had to fuel his addiction.<eos> His wife's jewelry, his TV, his computer...<eos> We believe that, finally, he reached the point where his only possession of any value was his service pistol.<eos> So he sells his Glock, then he gets clean.<eos> He's called back to full duty, but he doesn't have a sidearm anymore, or the money to buy one.<eos> So he buys a replica to make it look like he's armed and prays he's not gonna have to use it?
- There you go.<eos> I am cutting off my legs this evening.<eos> Oh! Oh, goodness me.<eos> But the point is, the brain has a mental map of the body from birth and even if that map is distorted by an amputation, it takes a lot for the brain to lose its sense of where everything is.<eos> It can be fooled, as the rubber hand showed you.<eos> I remember once being in bed with my girlfriend and doing that thing where I fell asleep on my arm.<eos> And of course your arm goes numb.<eos> And I rolled then over onto my back and my arm fell across my stomach.<eos> But because it was numb, I actually thought it was her arm on my stomach.<eos> And I actually started stroking it.
CHEERING AND APPLAUSE Now, before we even begin with the first question, one of your buzzers has been investigated by the FBI.<eos> Let's listen to all of them and see if you can get some early points by guessing which one.<eos> Jimmy goes... ♪ Lola, la-la-la-la, Lola... ♪<eos> Ronni goes...<eos> # Lay, lady, lay ♪ Lay across my big brass bed... ♪<eos> David goes...<eos> # Louie Louie, oh, no ♪ Gotta go Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi... ♪<eos> And Alan goes... ♪ Little Willy really won't go home... ♪<eos> So, we've got Little Willy really won't go home.<eos> Your song, do you recognise it?
- Look at that!<eos> - Look at your bullshit lava lamp.<eos> - Mine has dried.<eos> Ours is so brilliant.<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Your lava lamp is... - Hey!<eos> - Give...<eos> Steal another one of the...<eos> - RONNI: - It's happening. It's all happening in our corner.<eos> - I can feed it.
I mean, think of Oedipus and...<eos> - RONNI: - They don't listen.<eos> Well, sometimes, the Oracle is quite enigmatic and difficult.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But if he said, "Don't go to Ios..."<eos> - That's really straightforward.<eos> - ..and he goes, you know...<eos> Anyway, Homer went to Ios and he encountered a group of fisher boys.<eos> He asked them what they'd caught and they gave him this riddle.<eos> And I'll repeat it again. "All that we caught, we left behind, "and carry away all that we did not catch."
Have they not done it now...?<eos> You get these Ironmen that do these swims.<eos> Someone must've done it.<eos> But some of the prisoners who did escape were never found, so...<eos> It was assumed, I think, to keep the reputation.<eos> - Assumed dead, but they may have escaped.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It probably suited everyone.<eos> Yeah, because they didn't want the myth of Alcatraz to die.<eos> Who was the first person to put stuff between two slices of bread and eat it? ♪ Lay, lady, lay... ♪ Lord Sandwich.
You must get this everywhere you go, you're going to get it everywhere.<eos> I've gotten used to it, you know.<eos> It'll take a couple of minutes for the navi computer to calculate the coordinates.<eos> Yes. No, that's exactly it.<eos> That wasn't even my line and I get...<eos> We all started saying those things.<eos> You started to say it, that's right.<eos> For the jump into hyperspace.<eos> And it goes... MAKES CHEWBACCA NOISE I remember you with Harrison Ford where he said he had a problem with the dialogue.<eos> - He said, "You can write this stuff, but you can't say it."

Now, you got a good thing going with Victoria... don't ruin it.<eos> Yeah, but I don't want to lose her, Mike.<eos> You're not gonna lose her.<eos> Look, relationships, they got ebbs and flows.<eos> Like me and Molly, okay?<eos> Whenever I feel like maybe she's a little bit sick of me, I make an effort.<eos> I unload the dishwasher a couple times, we're right back on track.<eos> All right, I hope you're right.<eos> No, I am right.<eos> And if you do do the dishwasher thing, make sure they're clean before you unload it.
After watching the news, I realized I was wrong.<eos> I'm reflecting right now.<eos> Is it your mother?<eos> Yeah. She's acting cool about it, but I think she's really upset.<eos> Now I feel bad.<eos> I told you. I'm going to continue to make you feel bad.<eos> I'm really upset right now.<eos> Director.<eos> Is this your earring?<eos> Where did you find it?
Are you cold?<eos> Do you want me to put the roof back on?<eos> N...no.<eos> Spring is so nice.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> Who's going to be at the villa?<eos> Ah, a senior I'm close with and a younger friend I know.<eos> Ah, it'll be nice and cozy.<eos> You said we're having a barbecue party, right?<eos> I'm really looking forward to it.
Hey, punk! Did I curse at you or something? All I said was that she was pretty!<eos> You're..<eos> What's with you guys?<eos> Is there something going on?<eos> So are you positive it's Jeong Seon Saeng? I'm asking if you confirmed it.<eos> Why didn't you tell me earlier?<eos> There's no tangible evidence, although we have reasons to think that.<eos> Even if we tell him we saw, I'm sure he's going to insist he didn't.<eos> The sample has either been hidden or given to another cosmetics company.<eos> I borrowed a camera from a friend and already set it up.
Excuse me?<eos> No, not, not...<eos> Jesus.<eos> Not for us, for you.<eos> In case you don't have friends in the city.<eos> I don't have friends in the city and I don't have a cell phone.<eos> And then my I.D. and my credit cards were in that purse, so I am screwed.<eos> Okay.<eos> Want to go try and find your purse?<eos> What, like the person who took it is just gonna put it back?
We just don't, uh, march as much as we used to.<eos> - Jazz.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You listen?<eos> - I like it.<eos> I like jazz.<eos> I-I don't know it.<eos> - I know "My Funny Valentine."<eos> - A classic.<eos> I actually did it one year at summer camp.
There'd be nothing left to you.<eos> So maybe you just don't understand who the fuck I am.<eos> John. Easy?<eos> Don't "easy," Frank.<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> Fucking flipperhead.<eos> See, I hate you fucking Russians.<eos> You're all crazy and you're arrogant.<eos> Now, the Irish, we came here for a piece of the American dream.<eos> You people come over here to steal it, so fuck all of you.
Put the safety doors on manual override.<eos> I cannot do that!<eos> Keep the doors open.<eos> My wife is still in there!<eos> Come on... let's go!<eos> Takashi, tell me this door's on manual.<eos> Manual, yeah.<eos> But Joe, we are starting to breach!<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.
No, no, yeah, but I want this car.<eos> Okay?<eos> I want this car.<eos> This one we're sitting in.<eos> - Oh, the floor model?<eos> - Yes, it's your favorite, right?<eos> - You want...<eos> - It's special.<eos> You understand?<eos> - Can I have it?
So, let's say, you take some place like Lowndes County, where there are no Negroes who are registered and you've got to have someone who is registered to vouch for you.<eos> What are you supposed to do?<eos> Nobody you know, not a single black person for 100 miles is registered.<eos> So how do you get the voucher, right?<eos> To get you into the courthouse door to pay the poll tax to get your name published and get yourself dead.<eos> That's true.<eos> We need a new plan!<eos> I can't take him back to Washington and waltz into the White House with a list of empty demands.<eos> Tactics, my friends!<eos> We must break down this institution into the tangible tactics that it takes to dismantle it.
We heard them say we'd never make it here.<eos> We heard them say they'd stop us, if it was the last thing they did.<eos> We heard them say we don't deserve to be here.<eos> But today, we stand as Americans.<eos> We are here, and we ain't gonna let nobody turn us around.<eos> This mighty march, which will be counted as one of the greatest demonstrations of protest and progress, ends here in the Capitol ofAlabama for a vital purpose.<eos> We have not fought only for the right to sit where we please and go to school where we please.<eos> We do not only strive here today to vote as we please.<eos> But with our commitment, we give birth each day to a new energy that is stronger than our strongest opposition.<eos> And we embrace this new energy so boldly, embody it so fervently, that its reflection illuminates a great darkness.
Okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> Sit down.<eos> You got to pick somebody to trust, Jack.<eos> Now, sit down.<eos> You brought your dog?<eos> Q.P. dog.<eos> Quasi-Personal.<eos> Why else am I out for a walk?<eos> Grabbed it out of somebody's yard.
Every last one of you!<eos> Because your shield wall was weak.<eos> Dead.<eos> Dead.<eos> Very dead.<eos> Soldier, many lives depend on you.<eos> When attacked, lock your feet in the ground.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> When a shield wall is strong, nothing can ever defeat it!
Let us tell an old story anew.<eos> And we will see how well you know it.
He told her it was true love's kiss.<eos> But it was not to be.<eos> As the years passed<eos> Stefan's ambition called him away from Maleficent and towards the temptations of the human kingdom.<eos> While Maleficent, the strongest of the fairies rose to become the protector of the Moors.<eos> Maleficent often wandered alone and sometimes wondered where Stefan might be.<eos> For she had never understood the greed and envy of men.<eos> But she was to learn.<eos> For the human king had heard of a growing power in the Moors.<eos> And he sought to strike it down.
From the cameras?<eos> Yeah, they're going like...<eos> Come here.<eos> Do you hear that?<eos> It's just a camera.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, you've got to move it back.<eos> What?<eos> Move the camera back.<eos> Move it back.
Come on. Adari... I've been trying to wake you since seven.<eos> Maybe you're lacking B-12.<eos> I'll take you with me to work and get you checked out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get up.<eos> I'm letting her win.<eos> You're so mature for your age.<eos> You're so beautiful for yours.<eos> Where's my jeans skirt?<eos> I hid it from you.
Mommy's Hector.<eos> Not too bad.<eos> - Hello!<eos> - Hello!<eos> Oh. Oh, God!<eos> I got you seeing Professor Coreman tomorrow.<eos> You owe me.<eos> That guy is on a fast track to the Nobel.<eos> His happiness book is going through the roof.<eos> I know, I read it.

- Tommy, it's Ned.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Nick died.<eos> God damn.<eos> I'll call later when I know more about the memorial.<eos> I have this tradition.<eos> It's something I do now when a friend dies.<eos> I save his Rolodex card.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?
Oh, Father, turn it up.<eos> Please, Mr. Dragomir, I love this song.<eos> This song is sick... the traditional "vomit" definition of the word.<eos> Shut up, Andre.<eos> Me and Rose want to hear it.
To prove to everyone you haven't turned?<eos> Get away from that freak.<eos> Maybe I just like the way the moonlight hits this spot.<eos> It's as if you're on another planet.<eos> What was it like... outside the academy?<eos> It was kind of scary, just the two of us out there, but... it was also kind of great.<eos> No one knew who I was.<eos> It does sound kind of great.<eos> But what did you do for blood?<eos> I mean, it's not like you can pick it up at 7-Eleven.
It was only gonna be guys, but I can...<eos> Oh, thanks, but I'm going to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.<eos> I think everyone is.<eos> He has a frozen yogurt machine and a trampoline.<eos> So do we!<eos> We have a frozen yogurt machine and a trampoline.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Well, yeah...<eos> My lab book!<eos> Put it out!

At least for music, we're the same.<eos> Did you know Leo only listens to classical?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I always wanted to learn classical music, but I never had the patience.<eos> How come?<eos> It's the best type of music there is.<eos> -Don't exaggerate<eos> -But guys, it really is, isn't it?<eos> Why do you like it so much?
Dr. Jane gave me that, but...<eos> I wasn't going to be Izzy Finklestein from Brooklyn any more.<eos> I was going to be Isabella Patterson.<eos> From wherever I wanted to be.<eos> What a thrill to see you walk in!<eos> -Delta, you know Josh?<eos> -Of course.<eos> Your play's only gotten better, Joshua.<eos> Thank you!<eos> I can't wait to see you do it.
Because I might be thinking about some guy, too, right?"<eos> "I don't know how we got here.<eos> "All I said was, 'why don't we go to a vegetarian restaurant.'<eos> "And this had to happen."<eos> "Give me that."<eos> -"No, you quit." -"So did you."<eos> "Well, just because I'm breaking my thing, doesn't mean I..."<eos> "What...<eos> I can't have a puff on your cigarette?"<eos> -"I didn't say that." -"Well, then, give it to me."
Just because someone stumbles, loses their way... it doesn't mean they're lost forever.<eos> Sometimes we all need a little help.<eos> I'm not the man I was.<eos> I open my mind... and it almost overwhelms me.<eos> You're afraid, and Cerebro knows it.<eos> All those voices... so much pain.<eos> It's not their pain you're afraid of.<eos> It's yours, Charles.<eos> And as frightening as it may be... that pain will make you stronger.<eos> If you allow yourself to feel it... embrace it... it will make you more powerful than you ever imagined.
Initiating final approach.<eos> Masks on.<eos> See, I know all the depravity, the deceit and the cruelty of The Capitol's pampered elite.<eos> But the biggest secrets are about our good President, Coriolanus Snow.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Command, this is Team Leader.<eos> Prepare to deploy gas.<eos> We will confirm once inside.<eos> Such a young man when he rose to power.<eos> Such a clever one to keep it.
Maybe a little bit of him wants to return the favor, but it's that little bit that makes him so valuable.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> Okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> But that's not what my people would say.<eos> What would your people say?<eos> Take him out?<eos> Kill him?<eos> And then what have you got?<eos> A great big fucking hole, and who's going to fill it?
These are the charities you specified with their bank details.<eos> Each of the transfers is logged in to our system and is ready to go.<eos> Oh. Would you please check all the details?<eos> The name of the account holders and the money assigned to each recipient and then authorize each one with your signature.<eos> I would like to make a substitute.<eos> I need to change a name.<eos> Seven Friends Navigation Company?<eos> Yes.<eos> It is a shipping company, but one whose business is charity.<eos> We can have all the aid in the world but it's worthless unless you can get it to the people who need it.
It's not a purse, it's a knapsack!<eos> We have to bring this to the Nova Corps.<eos> There's a chance they can contain it.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> We're wanted by the Nova Corps.<eos> Just give it to Ronan!<eos> So he can destroy the galaxy?<eos> What are you, some saint all of a sudden?<eos> What has the galaxy ever done for you?<eos> Why would you wanna save it?
Happens all the time.<eos> - 13B, Fahim Nasir. - Bullshit.<eos> - Stand. - Thank you, sir.<eos> Feeling okay?<eos> Flying is not my cup of tea.<eos> Tell me about it.<eos> - You're a doctor.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Your bag.<eos> Can you fetch it up, please?
Cut him loose. Nancy.<eos> We need to start moving all the luggage towards the back.<eos> And move the women and children, move them up to the front of the plane.<eos> That's your plan?<eos> My job is to prepare for the worst possible outcome.<eos> Well, my job is to prevent it.<eos> Women and children, no exceptions. Men move up in coach.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> There's a plan of action that exists called the Least Resistant Bomb Location Protocol.<eos> You place the bomb against the rear door and stack anything and everything against it.
Why would I do something to you?<eos> You're my family member, I'm yours.<eos> So..<eos> One of us could still win, if we wanted to.<eos> Do you want to?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Just getting my bag.<eos> - Mikey, just leave it.
Not like their eyes or something they were born with<eos> That's how they know that you like them, you like their taste, you like their...<eos> Shut up!<eos> I just hate this song.<eos> You're joking!<eos> This is like my favourite song.<eos> Oh I know..<eos> I just.. I've heard this so many times.<eos> Oh, yeah, that's true.<eos> They do play it a lot.
Let's go. There's nothing here.<eos> There's no signs.<eos> We got nothing.<eos> Sir, we have a live armed missile in the trash.<eos> Live?<eos> I carried that to the trash! You told me that was a dud, dude.<eos> I could be dead. Right?<eos> Look.<eos> Okay, yes, I found a truck, all right.<eos> I towed it back for the parts. I left it here last night. This morning, it's gone.
Are you gonna go back?<eos> I love you, Tina.<eos> Just not enough to quit.<eos> I think you're wrong, but I understand.<eos> If I could say one word to you to change your mind, would you give me that chance?<eos> This isn't a game.<eos> We don't have to stay in the same room, we don't have to sleep together, that's not what I'm asking.<eos> If that becomes important, you'll be the one to decide.<eos> I'll hear the music, and then I'll know.<eos> And if I never hear it... I've already gotten more than I deserve.
He wouldn't speak.<eos> But physically he was fine, he didn't seem injured.<eos> I can't let you just leave.<eos> Not with the baby...<eos> I'll get you a bed.<eos> And some food. Alright?<eos> Hey guys!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Was that you who killed the dog?<eos> But damn, why did you kill it?
Penny for the guy?<eos> Penny for the guy?<eos> JOHN: 'That was the most ridiculous thing I've ever done.'<eos> SHERLOCK: 'You invaded Afghanistan.'<eos> DOOR OPENS<eos> HE CLEARS HIS THROAT<eos> You have been busy, haven't you?<eos> Quite the busy little bee. Hmm.<eos> Moriarty's network.<eos> Took me two years to dismantle it.
You alright?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take a look.<eos> We've made a breakthrough with the nanotechnology.<eos> We can rebuild any material faster than before.<eos> Synthetic stem cells, tissue regeneration.<eos> The medical applications are now limitless.<eos> It's extraordinary.<eos> They'll be scared at first.<eos> But once they see what the technology can do, I think that they will embrace it.
I picture cracking her lovely skull... unspooling her brains... trying to get answers.<eos> The primal questions of any marriage.<eos> "What are you thinking?"<eos> "How are you feeling?"<eos> "What have we done to each other?"<eos> The Irish prince graces us with his presence.<eos> His majesty prefers not to be moistened.<eos> I got you a present.<eos> - I hated this game.<eos> - You loved it.

And he grabbed me.<eos> But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.<eos> And he clubbed me.<eos> Icoflapsed.<eos> That club was actually the handle to a Punch and Judy puppet.<eos> Right.<eos> Treasure hunt.<eos> I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...<eos> Then how did Desi have that handle?<eos> I'd just found it.

Just, like, one-time.<eos> One-time thing.<eos> No big commitment or stress to each other.<eos> What about school and football and your wonderful new life?<eos> I have time off.<eos> I'm on spring break.<eos> Cool tingling.<eos> Got room for one of these babies.<eos> A grenade.<eos> Why you gonna put it there?
Don't look at me!" Do this, do that.<eos> I will show him!<eos> What is this?<eos> Oh, it's me!<eos> It's a spitting image of me.<eos> What a wonderful gift.<eos> I wonder who could have made such a beautiful doll?<eos> Where are you hiding?<eos> Come out, I won't eat you.<eos> I will put it here.
I love you, Mum.<eos> Me too.<eos> Her nose is broken in two places. She's gonna need surgery.<eos> I'll pay for everything.<eos> You can't even pay your own bills.<eos> Look, I really have to go.<eos> Claire, I think someone is stalking me and Samuel.<eos> What?<eos> A book turned up at our place.<eos> I threw it away, but somebody glued it back together and put it on our doorstep.
Hi.<eos> I want to report someone stalking me and my child.<eos> Can you tell us what happened?<eos> Somebody sent me...<eos> ca children's book.<eos> And...?<eos> And it contained violent and graphic images of my child and me being murdered.<eos> Can we have a look at the book, please?<eos> I burnt if.<eos> You burnt it.
Come on.<eos> Caesar.<eos> We're coming your way, where are you?<eos> In this filthy river, behind you.<eos> Try to stay as close as you can.<eos> Make room for Caeser.<eos> Move your ass in.<eos> Who's that?<eos> A huge black guy on a boat.<eos> Hold it, hold it, you got it going.
He's gonna keep following us, man.<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> He's moving.<eos> What's going on with you, brother?<eos> I said what's going on, brother?<eos> I want my car back.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> You ain't gettin' it back.
It's got three people in it.<eos> It hasn't stopped here.<eos> They needed petrol.<eos> I haven't got any petrol.<eos> Did you see it?<eos> I haven't seen a car with three people in it.<eos> Do you want to buy something?<eos> I've got tins of stuff and some auto accessories and other things.<eos> I'm looking for a car with three people in it.<eos> Have you seen it?
- It's Cleo-<eos> - She is one of us.<eos> - Oh, we love her.<eos> - Is she parked illegally?<eos> Is she sitting on a yellow line?<eos> I<eos> - No.<eos> That's right, little man.<eos> There's only one line that separates your pathetic little world from ours...<eos> - and you just crossed it.
- Yeah.<eos> So what's his deal?<eos> Why does he want to have a clean slate now?<eos> What's his game?<eos> Turn around.<eos> You should turn around just now.<eos> Chechnya.<eos> This ugly, dirty, little godforsaken country.<eos> Oil, however, lots of it.<eos> Filthy Chechen terrorists didn't want to give it to us.
Just now. I'm sorry.I clicked record before I had a chance to position the camera.<eos> Oh, that's OK.<eos> - And I mixed two questions into one.<eos> - Ah! That's OK.<eos> By the way, where are you right now?<eos> I'm here,at the hotel.<eos> But the convention is happening right now.<eos> I know.I'm watching it.<eos> Aren't you at your hotel?<eos> I'm watching it on my laptop.
A blog contest which all of a sudden... Poof! Just disappears.<eos> How long have you been doing this to me?<eos> It's up to you, Nick.<eos> Where to?<eos> I gave you an arrow.<eos> Follow the arrow.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Drive!<eos> Turn off that awful music, will you?<eos> You're the one who left it on.
Apparently you're 14.<eos> She's old and still has it.<eos> Who knows where you'll end up.<eos> You're not that nice, you know?<eos> How the fuck can you be 14?<eos> Are these the baptism records?<eos> No. Um...<eos> Your father's uncle, he told us that this is where your father was baptized, and this church was built in 1887, so I'm looking for a church built in 1887.<eos> Here.<eos> I found it.
Are you messing with me?<eos> No. It's really cool.<eos> I'm a journalist.<eos> I've done some...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't write anything, really.<eos> I thought I would, but I mostly just read.<eos> I read the news. I don't know.<eos> Anyway, so what does a post-modern romantic writer do all day?<eos> Find beauty and praise it. Wow.
No matter how many times I see it, just...<eos> Wow!<eos> Indeed.<eos> Okay, but if there's blue dust, why can't there be other colors?<eos> Because there aren't.<eos> And maybe those other colors do other things.<eos> What if there was, I don't know, purple?<eos> What if there's pink?<eos> The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.<eos> Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it?
What if there's pink?<eos> The day someone finds pink pixie dust is the day I trade in my kilt for trousers.<eos> Well, what if we don't find it? What if we make it?<eos> Listen carefully, Zarina.<eos> We do not tamper with pixie dust.<eos> It is far too powerful.<eos> But if we don't, we'll never fully understand what it's capable of.<eos> That is not our job.<eos> We're Dust Keepers.<eos> We nurture the dust, maintain it, measure it, package it, and distribute it.
What do you think you're doing?<eos> No, no, no... it's not...<eos> Look at this!<eos> - It's The Kuntu Zangpo.<eos> - Fresh from our apartment.<eos> Wait your apartment?<eos> I thought you said it was yours?<eos> It is.<eos> Richard, put that down right now or I am calling the police.<eos> Oh, you want me to put it down?
Why is this man pointing a gun at us?<eos> I thought we were handling this.<eos> Yes, you were.<eos> Then I realized that you two have an issue with trust.<eos> Give me the Zangpo.<eos> Uh-uh, hold up, sweetheart.<eos> You want that thing, you got to come through me.<eos> Who the hell is he?<eos> He's a buyer, Paige found on the Craig's list.<eos> Well, I went over all Bhutan for that figurine, and I want it now.
Here it is.<eos> That is called "take-charge shit," son!<eos> "That is called 'take-charge shit," son!<eos> "Yes, indeed.<eos> Yes, indeed.<eos> "Hi, my name is Stretch,<eos> "aka Billy Big Balls With Bad Ideas."<eos> Karl would appear to me occasionally when I was exhausted or otherwise beat.<eos> - I thought you hated this job?<eos> - Doesn't mean I can afford to lose it.
Liotta's $200 tip, while generous, isn't going to save me from a pair of shattered kneecaps.<eos> I know what you thinking.<eos> It's stupid of me to be lavishing attention on my love life the same day that a very agitated member of the Mexican mafia has promised to break things I don't want broken.<eos> And there's always the chance that this "Pinkminx" isn't actually a woman, there was just something about the...<eos> Pink.<eos> Huh.<eos> Well, if that's stupid, then this is just plain old reckless.<eos> The one addiction I haven't been able to shake.<eos> Her.<eos> Let's not call it stalking.
But, if I'm honest...<eos> I had a real issue with my own image.<eos> It made me anxious.<eos> But now, I'm approaching my own death, so...<eos> I need to learn to relinquish control.<eos> Newman Loslein, who was your mentor and guide, instilled in you the idea of art and nature as a means of healing.<eos> And I'm assuming part of his teachings touch on love.<eos> Could you elaborate a little bit on that?<eos> I'm not interested in elaborating.<eos> You're asking me to perform, like, pluck love out of the sky and examine it for you.
Welcome, everyone.<eos> As you all know, it has taken a long time to prepare ourselves.<eos> To build our ships, and to replace the young men that we lost to the plague.<eos> But now, now we are ready, and this summer we shall finally go West again.<eos> Yay!<eos> Yeah!<eos> We will return to England, for that land was so generous to us the last time.<eos> But this time, we shall not go alone.<eos> For King Horik and Jarl Borg have agreed to join us.<eos> And perhaps we will not have to return so quickly, but stay in their land for awhile, explore it, maybe even winter there.
I like your hat, by the way.<eos> Thank you!<eos> It's new.<eos> You're very dear to me, you know?<eos> To all of us.<eos> There you go.<eos> Well this is... nice.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Keel's Rosewater.<eos> I could have just come into the shop to collect it.
I don't know.<eos> She could be.<eos> She's very em...<eos> -Social girl by all accounts.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> Her family have heard nothing you say?<eos> No, she sent in a sick note and that's the last anybody's heard.<eos> -Have you seen it, the sick note? -No.<eos> Might be worth a look.<eos> See if she signed it herself.
You okay?<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't feel my hand.<eos> What do you mean, you can't feel your hand?<eos> Why can't I feel my hand? I can't feel my hand.<eos> What... what...<eos> Hold that.<eos> What about the other one?<eos> Can you feel this hand, Marshall?<eos> W... a-are you touching it?
No hospital... your brother dies.<eos> Those are not our options!<eos> We have no options!<eos> We came here from Uganda, and my brother... is gay, okay?<eos> Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I know the situation there.<eos> Then you know if I go home, I'll be killed.<eos> We can't go home.<eos> Okay, I'll take out the bullet.<eos> - Let's take it out.
We need as much pressure as we can get.<eos> What did you do to my brother? !<eos> The bullet was plugging a hole in your brother's artery, Paul.<eos> I removed the bullet. The hole was exposed.<eos> I promised to save you. Now I've killed you.<eos> - My brother, my only brother!<eos> - Paul, you need to be calm right now.<eos> We're gonna try and fix him right here.<eos> Okay, that artery is torn to shreds.<eos> But you know what? I do believe that I can tie it up, though.
Can't see much.<eos> How's the liver look?<eos> - Brutal.<eos> - Is that the technical term?<eos> Sponges.<eos> Keep them coming, please.<eos> Her liver's been pulped.<eos> I don't think it's viable.<eos> Both the right and left lobes have been severely damaged.<eos> Okay, let's pack it, and then let's get her into imaging and see how badly damaged that spinal cord is.
Or solitude of any kind?<eos> Your place is great.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Is this private? - No, no secret.<eos> I just have to figure out what to do with my apartment.<eos> Alex, you know if you need any money, I'll...<eos> No, I mean, yes, I do, but I-I don't.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why don't you just dump it?
But then suddenly you were gone.<eos> Iran under the tree, but you weren't there anymore.<eos> I called out, and you called out in response.<eos> But from up in another tree.<eos> I ran to it but you weren't there.<eos> And then suddenly it was already summer.<eos> And I still ran and called out but only the wind blew and the leaves rustled.<eos> You weren't anywhere.<eos> I was spent and started crying.<eos> Your saw was on the ground. Iwanted to pick it up but then you suddenlyjumped out from behind a tree and laughed, pushing me down.
I was just... You know, before you come tomorrow night.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'm going to destroy your play.<eos> But you didn't even see it.<eos> Um, you know, did I do something to offend you?<eos> Actually, you did.<eos> You occupied a theater which might have been used on something worthwhile.<eos> Okay. But you don't even know if it's any good or not.<eos> That's true.<eos> I haven't read a word of it, or even seen a preview... but after the opening tomorrow,
Find the fucking folder!<eos> A fucking janitor? You're a dumb fuck!<eos> A dumb fuck!<eos> -Find the folder!<eos> -Okay, I'm sorry.<eos> Tanner!<eos> Jesus fucking Christ, where have you been?<eos> -We have an issue.<eos> -Okay, now is not the time.<eos> I gave Neiman the folder and Neiman lost it.
If we're having a problem fornicationally, then we should discuss it.
With those things up there and stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> They're blades.<eos> Well, this looks like a third-grader did it, man.<eos> This blueprint<eos> - The scale's Way off.<eos> Everything doesrft make sense.<eos> If you Want a sweet blueprint of this...<eos> I got this blueprint software on my computer.<eos> I'll give it to you for free.
You up for Easter then?<eos> No.<eos> What happened?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> What happened? !<eos> Some men attacked me, but don't worry about it.<eos> Why didn't you go to the police?<eos> Do you own that boat?<eos> Do you own that boat?<eos> I borrowed the boat, I'll get it back.
Partners.<eos> If you were anyone else I would've buried you this morning.<eos> If I were anyone else, you'd understand.<eos> No.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> Forget this mess, cut a path, right aways.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go see Caleb.<eos> When you're done with that bottle, put it on the ground.
Bye bye.<eos> Sorry to wake you.<eos> You know, I sold your machine ten years ago for a reforestation project.<eos> Six owners since then.<eos> I love thinking about all they've seen.<eos> Them wheat farms of yours are never supposed to be as far west as they are.<eos> You ever heard of manifest destiny?<eos> No sir.<eos> I like history.<eos> Everyone's so damned scared to repeat it, they never thought how bad the alternatives was.
- More right, more right!<eos> Oh! - Lottie!<eos> Well done!<eos> I've been trying to hit that for years.<eos> - What did it say?<eos> - It said "Do not let children drive".<eos> ♪ Oh, Mother, can I go out to swim?<eos> ♪ Yes, my darling daughter<eos> ♪ Watch the boys don't see your bum<eos> ♪ Keep it well under the water
We're on television!<eos> The three children from this family who cannot be named for legal reasons... - Oh! ...are inside the house.<eos> - The police have announced...<eos> - We can only confirm that the body of a man in his mid-seventies was... destroyed and floated out to sea possibly with some valuables.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I forgot to put the brooch in my drawing.<eos> - Yes, it was.<eos> - Brooch?<eos> Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.
- Brooch?<eos> Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.<eos> All Vikings went to Valhalla with their treasure.<eos> You morons!<eos> Well, that's just rude.<eos> You, stupid, stupid little...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, enough!<eos> - They've destroyed a family heirloom.<eos> - Dad found it.
Toby Franzen.<eos> We've been after that piece of shit for years.<eos> Sergeant at Arms now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And the very one who sponsored our mate Collard as a nominee in the bike club.<eos> Well, unless Franzen's gone soft in his old age, I don't imagine you got much out of him.<eos> Hasn't said a word.<eos> But luckily for us, Collard has.<eos> You seen that tattoo anywhere before?<eos> Oh, I seen it every day, eh.
Urca de Lima, the largest Spanish treasure galleon in the Americas.<eos> A page was torn from the log with the Urca's course and schedule.<eos> Take them into custody.<eos> The schedule is here on the island.<eos> The thief who stole it has offered to sell it to me.
When I got here, I'd made so many wrong turns, felt empty, dead inside. You guys brought me back to life.<eos> You showed me that my past is exactly that.<eos> I have a life today.<eos> Is it better? Sometimes.<eos> It's different, and then there are moments when I get little glimpses of hope.<eos> Those are good days, and the rest of the days, I'm working on those.<eos> This dinner's for your niece? Yeah.<eos> She wants me to meet her new boyfriend.<eos> I have no idea why.<eos> Maybe because she's excited to have you in her life and wants to share it with you. Could be that.
We slept anywhere.<eos> The world belonged to us.<eos> Life seemed endless.<eos> The energy of youth.<eos> It's not my thing, the stop.<eos> I need autonomy.<eos> I want to support myself.<eos> That's why I prefer the bike.<eos> And you sleep in hotels?<eos> No, I have a tent, but then I did not want to mount it.
Where's the weapon?<eos> Go on, search me, no weapon.<eos> Bainbridge was on parade, he came off duty five minutes ago.<eos> When's this supposed to have happened?<eos> You obviously stabbed him before he got into the shower.<eos> No. No? !<eos> He's soaking wet and there's shampoo in his hair.<eos> He got into the shower, then someone stabbed him.<eos> The cubicle was locked from the inside, sir.<eos> I had to break it open.
I couldn't imagine life out of this uniform.<eos> I suppose, given the circumstances, I don't have to.<eos> When so many want you dead, it hardly seems good manners to argue.<eos> Whatever you're doing in there, James, stop it, right now!<eos> I will kick this door down!<eos> Mr Holmes, you and I are similar, I think.<eos> Yes, I think we are.<eos> There's a proper time to die, isn't there?<eos> Of course there is.<eos> And one should embrace it when it comes.
The entrance to my vaults.<eos> This is where I keep you all.<eos> OK, so where are the vaults, then?<eos> Vaults?<eos> What vaults?<eos> There are no vaults beneath this building.<eos> They're all in here.<eos> The Appledore vaults are my mind palace.<eos> You know about mind palaces, don't you, Sherlock?<eos> How to store information so you never forget it, by picturing it.
Really?<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> So now it's time for the talk.<eos> - The talk?<eos> - The 401k talk.<eos> Have you decided which plan you'd like to adopt?<eos> What's a 401k?<eos> Your retirement savings plan.<eos> You're eligible to participate.<eos> Every month, you deposit part of your salary into your 401k, and the company matches it, tax-free.
Easy peasy.<eos> Hey, you're the helper guy, right?<eos> The T.A., yeah.<eos> Yeah, I don't understand my grade on this paper.<eos> That would be a "D".<eos> Yeah, no, thanks, I get that.<eos> Um, but why?<eos> I mean, I misspelled Tennyson or something?<eos> Uh, yeah, I remember this one.<eos> I graded it.

He's got the package. He has the package.<eos> I got it; what do I do with it?<eos> Aardvark, there are people coming.<eos> You have to act now.<eos> Secure the package, secure the package.<eos> - What do I do with it?<eos> -They're coming right towards you.<eos> They're gonna see it, they're gonna see it.<eos> You got to hide that little missile.<eos> I have to hide it somewhere?
I've never seen Valyrian steel before.<eos> She's a beauty.<eos> The problem is, if you fight with an edged blade, I'll have to.<eos> And if I fight with an edged blade, I'll have no one left to pay me.<eos> I haven't used a sparring sword since I was nine.<eos> Bold warrior you are, attacking a man when his guard's down.<eos> Best time to attack a man.<eos> Mind yourself.<eos> - If I still had my right hand...<eos> - Plan on growing it back?
No?<eos> How tolerant of you.<eos> I expect it is a relief, Lady Cersei, giving up your regal responsibilities.<eos> Wearing the crown for so many years must have left your neck a bit crooked.<eos> I suppose you'll never know, Prince Oberyn.<eos> It's a shame your older brother couldn't attend the wedding.<eos> Please give him our regards.<eos> With any luck, the gout will abate with time and he will be able to walk again.<eos> They call it the rich man's disease.<eos> A wonder you don't have it.
Mr. Hamund?<eos> Who the fuck are you?<eos> My name is John Silver.<eos> And I have a proposition for you.<eos> I've heard your crew has been freed to hunt again.<eos> And I understand with Mr. Rackham out of favor, you're the man the crew now looks to.<eos> Seems our paths were meant to meet in this moment.<eos> Me with something to sell, and you with means to use it.<eos> Piss off.<eos> I was the whore's partner, the one who stole the page from Flint and then tried to sell it to you.
Oh, drugs, not bugs.<eos> And this not the gardening show?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> Let's take another caller.<eos> So, we've successfully moved on from that relationship, have we?<eos> This is the Commissioner's house?<eos> Is someone gonna get that phone?<eos> Can you two stop fighting?<eos> Turn it off, please.
Arty stuff.<eos> He said he wanted a few keepsakes, so... I gave him my old camera.<eos> Ros lent us her penthouse, her love nest as she calls it, not that I think it's ever seen much love.<eos> When he stopped returning my calls, I got scared.<eos> I knew he'd want money and gifts.<eos> Price you're paying for dirty little secrets.<eos> When I'd heard he'd died, it felt like a reprieve.<eos> All I could think of was getting hold of that red book before it fell into the wrong hands.<eos> I couldn't bear it if Pat and Ellie found out.<eos> Well, let's just wait till we get the phone call, eh? From whoever's got it, to see what they want.
Spirit?<eos> Signal us once for "Yes."<eos> Twice for "No."<eos> Harry, are you okay?<eos> Are you happy?<eos> Spirit, if you can hear me, give me a sign.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I mean, damn it, Stanley, we've both done levitations.<eos> I once raised a real tiger, but we both have our tricks.<eos> There was nothing supporting this candle, no threads, no wires, it was floating until I brought it down.
To fuck you.<eos> And as a friend.<eos> Jesus Christ, friends don't pressure friends to fucking sleep with them.<eos> Actually, that's not true, Nina.<eos> Because as I'm sure you know, a friend is a gift you give yourself.<eos> Okay, a left on Roth, and then six blocks to the ramp.<eos> You're putting me on the 5?<eos> Yeah, the 2 to the 5 to the 110 to the 10.<eos> Did you read my traffic memo yesterday?<eos> Did I read it?
We wanna share her with the world at just the right moment.<eos> The people who tried to kidnap her are very powerful people.<eos> They want all of her talents for themselves.<eos> They think that whoever controls her abilities will control the world.<eos> Yeah, even if all of it's true, why me?<eos> State-of-the-art GPS tracking device.<eos> We'll know where you are, plus or minus 2 feet.<eos> That's just to make sure you maintain your end of the bargain.<eos> And if you want it off, you'll have to chop off your leg.<eos> Well, maybe I'll chew it off.
- No.<eos> We can't just open the doors.<eos> Hey, just back it up, guys.<eos> Stop.<eos> The air could be toxic.<eos> If the air is toxic, we're all dead, anyway.<eos> Bellamy?<eos> My God, look how big you are.<eos> What the hell are you wearing, a guard's uniform?<eos> I borrowed it to get on the drop ship.
You want that on your hands, Chloe?<eos> Yates got greedy.<eos> Began selling data to the highest bidder like it was some sort of auction house or something.<eos> Also I caught him hacking into military weapon systems.<eos> Why?<eos> I really don't know.<eos> I knew it was time for him to go.<eos> I don't do that sort of thing.<eos> Take direct action like that.<eos> We don't. We just acquire information and disseminate it.
Do we?<eos> Get started, Chloe.<eos> I don't want to be here any longer than I have to.<eos> Pete, make sure the others have access to the closed- circuit surveillance system from the London transport.<eos> Uh, okay, which ones?<eos> All of them.<eos> We'll be doing lots of backtracing.<eos> We may need to piggyback servers.<eos> Chell, pull up your facial recognition program.<eos> We'll use it for the cctv.
Don't you walk away from me.<eos> Irisa!<eos> Look.<eos> Losing you was hard.<eos> I've been a bit on edge.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - All right, good.<eos> So if we're finished with this mushy stuff, we need to come up with a plan before Varus and his crew regroup and come after us.<eos> Now, I got this sweet little boat.<eos> I say we get down to Lima, we swap it out for a bigger one, and then straight to Antarctica.
You know, if the safe is the same make, this place would be child's play.<eos> But if you get jammed up front...<eos> There is an alley running behind the whole block.<eos> I'm sure they have a door to it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> What?<eos> That car.<eos> - A tail?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - But you've tagged it before?
Way to alienate your most loyal friend.<eos> What was I supposed to do... not tell him the truth?<eos> Well, what makes you so sure it's the truth?<eos> Maybe you came up with this unusual diagnosis just to satisfy your own preconceived notions.<eos> Now you sound like him.<eos> Well, you must admit... your theory's pretty out there.<eos> It makes perfect sense!<eos> Then why are you still struggling?<eos> Because it's... just a theory.<eos> I can't prove it.
Can't say it that loud. -Okay.<eos> I think you're gonna dig it.<eos> Let's raise minimum wage.<eos> Blind people are people too.<eos> A very enjoyable read...<eos> It's complex...<eos> I'm exhausted!<eos> The journey is endless, you know?<eos> Global issue...<eos> I call it Some New Beginnings because it's plural.
Maybe we should be talking to Jason.<eos> No.<eos> W... we all agreed that it was too dangerous to tell anybody.<eos> Whoever tried to kill Ali's still around.<eos> Okay, but suppose Jason already knows she's still alive.<eos> At least then we wouldn't be the only ones in charge of a secret.<eos> Okay, I've been thinking, and I have a theory.<eos> You have what?<eos> A theory.<eos> Do you want to hear it or not?
See, here's the death certificate I signed last week.<eos> "Cause of death: Gunshots to the chesty area."<eos> I remember this guy.<eos> He was killed trying to rob a shooting range, which just proves that Darwin was right.<eos> And there's my signature.<eos> I think that's a forge.<eos> Uh, why would I forge my own signature, Shawn?<eos> No, no, Woody, not that one.<eos> This one here.<eos> I think someone took your signature and then drew over it.
He needs to see a specialist.<eos> Keeps happening over and over again.<eos> - Ridiculous. - No doctors.<eos> No doctors.<eos> All right, no doctors.<eos> A little water.<eos> Stephen.<eos> I need help.<eos> If only for Robert. He's missing out on his childhood.<eos> I keep looking for a way to make this work, but... I can't find it on my own.
No.<eos> But his buddy owns<eos> - 21 service hangars.<eos> - 21!<eos> Twenty-one of them, and he's gonna check his inventory, and he's gonna put the word out for you, Duster.<eos> - It's a good start, right?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> It's a great start!<eos> Can you believe it?<eos> Because if that gearbox is out there, we're gonna find it for you, buddy.
It's how I contacted you in the first place.<eos> I just needed to know if you were serious.<eos> That's Cashew.<eos> Why did you contact me?<eos> Because you're desperate.<eos> And I'm not fond of authority.<eos> Just today, under the leadership of Vice President Underwood, the Senate passed HR 934, along with an historic entitlement reform amendment.<eos> By raising the retirement age to 68 and 64 for normal and early retirement respectively, we will ensure entitlements for generations to come.<eos> And when the House passes that bill in a few weeks, as I fully expect them to do, we will put the government freeze to rest.<eos> We will continue the business of serving our country rather than paralyzing it.
Thanks, CJ.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> What is it? !<eos> What is it? !<eos> We got nothing.<eos> Security camera on this level's been out for a week.<eos> Well, that's awfully convenient.<eos> Well, the question is did our guy get lucky, or did he know that the camera was out?<eos> Well, if he works here, maybe he disabled it.
Think of it this way... you'll have more time to devote to your writing.<eos> Well, that's true.<eos> In fact, uh, it's funny you said that.<eos> I was just writing something now.<eos> A new book?<eos> No, a letter, actually, to you.<eos> It says, "I have been part of Chicago-Lake Michigan University "for more than half of my life.<eos> "I've been true to my school, chancellor.<eos> "But if my school doesn't want me anymore, then I will find one that does."<eos> You can take your research position, and shove it up your pompous ass.
Oh, I envy you that.<eos> How is it you've never been photographed?<eos> It's funny, actually.<eos> I have a bit of a resistance to it.<eos> Then why did you agree?<eos> You seem a man born to overcome resistance.<eos> There are native tribes who believe you give away something of your soul when you're photographed.<eos> Perhaps you do.<eos> And what will you do with this bit of my soul?<eos> Protect it.
You cannot live only in your work.<eos> My work is preoccupying.<eos> I was much the same.<eos> Never looking up from the cadaver.<eos> I imagined that I was content.<eos> And then one day, I'm having lunch. Bent over my anatomy books, I looked up and there she was.<eos> Pale blue dress with embroidered flowers.<eos> So look up, my friend.<eos> Our work cannot control us.<eos> We must control it.
I have to see her.<eos> To do what?<eos> Make this right.<eos> I always thought my traveling would kill my family.<eos> Being away so long.<eos> My thoughtlessness...<eos> I never imagined it would be a cruel little girl.<eos> When the illness came, it was absolute.<eos> I was aware of almost nothing.<eos> The doctors were at a loss to explain it.
You will make me an immortal mate.<eos> My bride must be beautiful.<eos> You're brooding, Mr. Chandler.<eos> It's Miss Croft.<eos> She's not well.<eos> Best you didn't kiss me anymore.<eos> Keep a safe distance.<eos> Hold her arms still!<eos> Miss Ives is manifesting a deep psychosexual responsiveness.<eos> Something or someone has triggered it.
Do you value cleanliness?<eos> I suppose I do.<eos> That's why you're a virgin.<eos> Or maybe not.<eos> Who can tell about such things?<eos> Such hidden things.<eos> Such secrets we all have, don't we, Doctor?<eos> There's a line from Shelley that haunts me.<eos> A single line, from Adonais.<eos> I can't seem to get it out of my head.
You're keen to get back in the swing, and that's to be commended...<eos> But?<eos> Tying in a suicide to a missing girl off the back of a single word?<eos> Got to admit that's a bit of a stretch - even by your standards.<eos> "Suspected" suicide, isn't it?<eos> In any event, we'd be better placed to know if certain of his possessions hadn't taken a walk.<eos> What's that?<eos> Meeker's notebook's gone missing.<eos> Somewhere between the scene and the Exhibits desk.<eos> Could be the Coroner's men swept it up with the rest of the detritus when they bagged the body.
Do you see him much?<eos> No.<eos> But I still miss him.<eos> There's not a day I don't think of him.<eos> He wanted to see the world.<eos> Wanderlust, they call it.<eos> After Father passed, it was only him and me.<eos> It was lonely at first.<eos> But you get used to it... the silence.<eos> Finally, you come to love it.
Why last night, what was the trigger?<eos> Has a few drinks at the party for Dutch courage.<eos> Comes on to Anna in the lab.<eos> Get's rebuffed.<eos> Humiliated and angry...<eos> The fact that he tried to destroy the memory card gives us enough to arrest and question him at least.<eos> That's me heading out, Billy.<eos> In this weather?<eos> I've got a lead on Finlay Caulfield.<eos> I'm going to check it out.
Jack of all trades, as long as it pays.<eos> Saving up for another wedding to cancel?<eos> Isbister's in the dry dock.<eos> Thanks, Drew.<eos> Give my best to Tosh.<eos> Inspector Perez.<eos> I told your man I'd call back.<eos> He's my sergeant!<eos> He's not my butler.<eos> And the next time you've got information relating to a crime, you give it to whoever's on the desk, do you understand?
Did you tell anybody about it, I mean, did he...?<eos> - Was he charged?<eos> - No.<eos> Because at the time I felt that I was somehow at fault. I knew I wasn't.<eos> But I just didn't want to be stared at.<eos> I didn't want to be known as the girl who got raped.<eos> And when I became pregnant, I wasn't gonna drop out of school.<eos> I wasn't going to let this man ruin my life.<eos> So I made a choice.<eos> I ended it.
We shared a cigarette and he walked back.<eos> - No one shot him?<eos> - I should have.<eos> It's only when he got back I realised he had stolen my cigarettes.<eos> And my lighter.<eos> Mr. Connor.<eos> I'm sorry if I disturbed you.<eos> If I could pick up my bag.<eos> Of course.<eos> Orhan put it in your room.
- l don´t know if I love him!<eos> I don´t know if he´s the one for me...<eos> He´s an asshole!<eos> Well, then...<eos> To hell with him.<eos> And don´t worry about the guests, you´re not the first woman at that party to be cheated on.<eos> Plus, if you spend your time worrying about what other people think you´re screwed, kiddo.<eos> All better?<eos> Look... lf I were you, I´d go downstairs,<eos> move the party along, end it early, and then, back at home, tell him it´s over.
Why not?<eos> What people are willing to say to me, they have to do in confidence.<eos> I'm your employer.<eos> Yeah, and you employ me to find things out, which is what I do.<eos> But how I do it, the methods I use, you should leave that to me.<eos> How do you know people are telling the truth?<eos> You don't.<eos> You have to use your judgment.<eos> What do you do if you've made a mistake?<eos> Then you try and rectify it, which is what I'm trying to do here.
What happened when you were kidnapped?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What happened to Kasim's father?<eos> You know what happened.<eos> Well, tell me again.<eos> He was driving the car the day we were taken.<eos> He was killed.<eos> The toothbrush wasn't Kasim's.<eos> It was new.<eos> I saw you use it.
Yeah.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Ollie?<eos> No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry.<eos> I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> - You threw away my card.<eos> - I already read it.
Go ahead.<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Ollie?<eos> No, I don't need to talk about it, Henry.<eos> I'm done.<eos> All right.<eos> - You threw away my card.<eos> - I already read it.<eos> You don't wanna save it?
There's only one reliable leader left in Westeros.<eos> Stannis.<eos> He's got the birthright.<eos> He's in his prime.<eos> He's a tried and tested battle commander.<eos> And he doesn't just talk about paying people back, he does it.<eos> Thelookoutseesa pirate ship sailing their way.<eos> The captain shouts to his first mate,<eos> "Bring me my red shirt."<eos> The first mate brings the red shirt and the captain puts it on.
Did you call me "babe"?<eos> I did.<eos> Oh, Peter.<eos> Ew! Mom!<eos> You'll never have this, Meg.<eos> All right, back in the car, kids.<eos> For this leg of the trip, I was thinking of driving with my shirt off like New Mexico trash.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Our car!<eos> Someone's stealing it.
Yeah, hi.<eos> I'd like to report a mugging.<eos> A girl's just been shot, and she's bleeding, so please hurry.<eos> Uh, it's at the park<eos> At North Beverly and Sunset.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're a good singer.<eos> I've seen you perform.<eos> You watch the show?<eos> Oh, yeah, I love it.
Don't get mad.<eos> This is only the beginning.<eos> Got a good thing going here.<eos> What, and end up just like Terry?<eos> You think I gave him that disease?<eos> Is that what you think?<eos> Doctor told me they don't know how he got it.<eos> Maybe it's hereditary.<eos> Maybe I'm next.<eos> Maybe you got it already.
- I can't find it.<eos> - Did you look under the desk?<eos> Why would it be under the desk?<eos> That's where I found your Seaborg medal.<eos> How hard can it be to find a 160-year-old pump handle?<eos> - Depends.<eos> - On what?<eos> On who's doing the finding.<eos> - Where did you...<eos> - Where you left it.
Do you want to introduce her to Yojo?<eos> He's kind of shy.<eos> I understand.<eos> ♪ ...so far away ♪<eos> ♪ still so far away ♪<eos> ♪ still so... ♪<eos> No, wait. Wait.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> Cleaning this place up.<eos> They'll have it back to normal in a few hours.
I'm, uh, trying to fix the darn thing.<eos> It looks like the motor mount broke.<eos> You sure you know what you're doing?<eos> Seems pretty straightforward.<eos> So wanna give her a try?<eos> - There's nothing in it. - Oh.<eos> For... for a test, I'm saying.<eos> Turn it off.<eos> Turn it off!<eos> You killed it.
I wish I could climb into that autoclave myself.<eos> I'll tell you what might cheer you up.<eos> Tickets to My Fair Lady for Chummy's birthday.<eos> And you won't believe the deal we got.<eos> I know every word!<eos> Go on, we'll unpack your bags.<eos> Run yourself a nice hot bath with plenty of salts.<eos> Thank you, are you sure you don't mind?<eos> I... ..G...<eos> I've soaked my uniform, but I could happily burn it.
It was like a dream within a dream.<eos> A nightmare?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait a second, Lydia.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Stiles, where are you going?<eos> I'm just gonna close the door.<eos> Just go back to sleep.<eos> No, no, I should close it.
Who else has access to your office?<eos> No one.<eos> There's only one key and I keep it on me.<eos> Could someone have broken in?<eos> No, cos I was in there phoning the change machine people.<eos> Did you give the key to someone?<eos> No.<eos> Who are you protecting?<eos> I'm offering you a lifeline here.<eos> Take it.
That would imply that you had some clue as to what you were doing.<eos> That's Dr. Claire Barnes, special liaison to the senate subcommittee on health-insurance regulation and reform... you know, the people that hold the fate of your industry in their hands.<eos> See, they don't think you guys should decide for yourselves what is and what isn't experimental.<eos> They want a panel of doctors and bureaucrats to do that for you.<eos> And they are just dying for a case just like this to hammer you with.<eos> And, boy, are we gonna hammer.<eos> Little teary Tyler and his curable heart condition are gonna be sitting in front of Congress, and you're gonna be twisting in your chair, covered in so much flop sweat,<eos> Mark McGuire's gonna call to say that you come off poorly.<eos> And then when you end up with some committee telling you when and how to pay up, you're gonna be sobbing at the memory that someone once offered you a gift-wrapped win-win "get out of jail free" card<eos> but you were too stupid to accept it.
[Chuckles] I know what this is, Paul.<eos> It's a shakedown.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna kowtow before that son of a bitch.<eos> Tell Pierce, "forget it." There's no job for him here.<eos> C-chancellor, look. [Stammers]<eos> [Cellphone vibrating] I'm sure this is just a negotiating position.<eos> You make a counteroffer, I'm pretty sure Daniel would take it.<eos> There's not gonna be any counteroffer.<eos> Pierce had one chance to be reinstated,<eos> - and he blew it by being greedy.
After Kate and I got here.<eos> You knew she wouldn't leave me behind if I was in jail or in the nuthouse.<eos> You knew we'd take care of him.<eos> And then Miranda would be free to go on your little trip.<eos> You did tell me that Daniel would be okay now that his friends got here.<eos> [Cello playing] Serge: Okay, even if I were trying to convince you to leave Daniel, I could have stayed with you here in Paris.<eos> I wouldn't need you to go on tour with me, right?<eos> [Playing continues] You didn't need her.<eos> You needed her cello.<eos> You broke it so that you could have it repaired.
- Well, of course he does.<eos> He and your mother are a couple.<eos> I mean, it's not like I want my parents to get back together, but...<eos> Mnh-mnh. You don't think it's icky that my boss is... sleeping with my mother?<eos> No.<eos> But I-I can see why you do.<eos> You're never old enough to hear the details of your mother's sex life.<eos> Ma just told Tommy and Frankie she needs moral support.<eos> Got a hit on the victim's credit card.<eos> Guy was using it right down the street at a 7-eleven.
They give me free stuff.<eos> No, they love me.<eos> You're just exploiting my brand for personal gain and destroying my reputation.<eos> So there's, like, no toilet on the sleigh, so you're, you're just, you're just crapping in people's houses, right?<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Stop wearing that suit, or else.<eos> Or else what?<eos> Or else I will put you at the top of my naughty list.<eos> You know, you're not talking to a little kid anymore, so get the hell out of my face, Santa.<eos> I like this suit, and I'm keeping it.
She's not fit to be out in the field right now.<eos> I've got eyes on one of them.<eos> He's headed south down a park path.<eos> Wait for me so we can box him in.<eos> No, I can get him.<eos> Jane... wait for me.<eos> Jane, do not engage!<eos> Do not engage!<eos> Can you find a power source?<eos> I can't see it, it must be underneath the payload.
Try again.<eos> That's weird.<eos> - If you're stalling...<eos> - Let me try to reset it.<eos> What kind of chemo meds are you on?<eos> Uh, something called Capecitabine, why?<eos> Oh, damn it.<eos> That's why the fingerprint sensor isn't working.<eos> One of the side-effects is a skin condition that obscures your prints.<eos> I had a fugitive once using it to evade capture.
I got 22 so far.<eos> And don't think I'm ignoring the fact that you lied to me, too.<eos> When I showed up at your door two months ago, you acted like you didn't remember abandoning me.<eos> I was respecting your mother's wishes.<eos> Which is why I'm second maddest at you.<eos> You're in third place. But...<eos> I've been trying to get your mother to tell you the truth since I found out.<eos> Which is why there isn't a Beth or William list.<eos> My mother's the one who betrayed me.<eos> And as soon as I'm finished with this list, I'm gonna read it to her, and make sure she hears every damn word.
You brought your ex to our family cabin?<eos> Look, Kate, it's fine.<eos> I mean, everyone's got exes, right?<eos> It's...<eos> It's okay. Uh... Who are you right now?<eos> Hey, anybody know what happened to my smoothie?<eos> It was supposed to last all day.<eos> Had these super top-shelf mushrooms in it, really gonna open up my world.<eos> Half of it's gone.<eos> Who drank it?
Take me home.<eos> Tell me why you want the deposits.<eos> My God... she is beautiful.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You fool.<eos> She loves you.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> He checked in just like you were told, but he never actually boarded the flight, so we pulled his bag before takeoff.<eos> When no one claimed it, it came here.
- Lohank?<eos> - Yeah, it was so gross, but I want to apologize.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Well, I kept talking about how I wanted everything to go back to normal, but if that actually happened, this little guy wouldn't be here.<eos> Or is he big?<eos> I don't know what size kids are supposed to be, or anything about kids, really.<eos> I think maybe that's part of the problem--it doesn't matter.<eos> I got a present for Nikolaj.<eos> - Thanks, Jake.<eos> Come on in, give it to him.
I was surveilling from across the road when all of a sudden, from out of nowhere, this lad... runs up and jumps in.<eos> Now, I took him for part of the gang until they drew their weapons.<eos> He was a Navy petty officer.<eos> Yes.<eos> And he was dead before I could do anything.<eos> They would have killed me, too, if I hadn't identified myself.<eos> They cut my GPS... right out of my arm, right there in the alley.<eos> And they dragged me back here to find out what I knew.<eos> Huh. Where'd you get the burner phone?<eos> One of them dropped it.

Where'd you get the burner phone?<eos> One of them dropped it.<eos> It took me ages to grab ahold of it, and send that text.<eos> Praying that you'd get it.
You a Bond fan?<eos> Yeah, little bit.<eos> Me too.<eos> Love his movies.<eos> And the books.<eos> So... you lot are chasing an atomic weapon?<eos> - Those are only theoretical.<eos> - No, they're real.<eos> This high-level threat we're tracking, he stole a functional prototype.<eos> We think he's going to give it to the Nazis.
Some Cuban fishing vessel.<eos> Keen was on board.<eos> So she's alive?<eos> You can come in, Aram.<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to hear the update, which is... the greatest update ever.<eos> - Did you talk to her?<eos> - No, but we heard her voice.<eos> The pilot was in the middle of giving the coordinates when the transmission cut out.<eos> The signal cut out?<eos> Why? Could you get it back?
But the answers you've been looking for are here.<eos> Reddington, he was in love with your mother and he's obsessed with you.<eos> But it can't be true.<eos> But you know it is.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I said too much.<eos> You must be feeling overwhelmed.<eos> I'll go and check on your daughter's arrival.<eos> Do you know why I call this cottage the Summer Palace?<eos> We came here for a vacation one July, and my little princess loved it.
When he was killed, one of the detectives was in the process of uploading a photo to NSY London.<eos> - Who's the photo of?<eos> - We don't know yet.<eos> The upload was interrupted mid-stream by the killer.<eos> Data was incomplete.<eos> Aram's looking at it now.<eos> Looks like we're involved, whether you like it or not.<eos> How's it going with the photo?<eos> Uh, it's, uh-- it's not.<eos> I tried to re-create it using a hex editor and a customized bit of forensic software to carve it off the drive...
The guy with the case.<eos> Please do not tell me that you parted with the best samples.<eos> Just one.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I told you I had a partner.<eos> I'm your partner now, Johan, and I've been out promising prospective buyers the full complement of Class A weaponry.<eos> Do you have any idea what was in that sample?<eos> Sorry, Raymond. I don't know what to tell you.<eos> Well, I insist on speaking with this so-called partner.<eos> At least let me try to buy it back.
A problem with what, Aram?<eos> Visibility.<eos> Drop it!<eos> Okay, don't pull out the flash drive.<eos> To corrupt the entire zipped file, hit "Abort" on the data-transfer dialogue.<eos> Yes!<eos> We didn't get Agnes.<eos> I know.<eos> I talked to Ressler.<eos> This, um, SVR report, when I talked to you earlier, I hadn't finished reading it.
We're not landing.<eos> Head south. CHAM:<eos> Hera, there is no time.<eos> Just turn around!<eos> We'll take care of the Empire.<eos> Is she serious?<eos> (SCOFFS) My daughter is always serious.<eos> Ha. Runs in the family.<eos> Rebel transport incoming.<eos> Shoot it down!
Oh, yeah, I hear you.<eos> Cost of doing business.<eos> I had to meet him for a guilt mani-pedi today.<eos> I'm sorry, I can't watch this.<eos> Show off.<eos> Michael!<eos> We agreed no more venti lattes.<eos> Okay, I was in a hurry.<eos> The drive-thru was right there.<eos> The budget only works if we both stick to it.
On to happier subjects.<eos> This is the explosive device that Bruno was going to use to commit mass murder.<eos> It has a wireless receiver and it was built from a toy remote-control car kit.<eos> Can you trace it?<eos> Hopefully or eventually.<eos> Don't be so impatient.<eos> How close did Bruno need to get to trigger the explosive?<eos> Well, it's a long-range transmitter, so he wasn't, like, suicidal, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> As a matter of fact, he was trying to quit smoking and that is what actually killed him.<eos> The killer spiked his nicotine patch with a cyanide analogue about 20 minutes before he put it on, according to the adhesive oxidation.
You got to go.<eos> Go.<eos> Fire department!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, we got to get you out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> We'll get you out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> My backpack!<eos> Leave it.
Anyway, if you want to listen to two old men dribble on about music and opera whilst I have fun, there'll be more of that later on.<eos> But now it's time for us to check our mirrors and make a smooth left into Conversation Street.<eos> It is.<eos> Now... I have to say, James was very, very excited about coming to Whitby, because he'd heard that it's the centre of the British jet industry.<eos> He was very much looking forward to spending a couple of days looking at old drawings of Concord, but then he discovered that Whitby jet is actually this.<eos> It looks like coal.<eos> -It is coal.<eos> -Is it?<eos> Thing is, though, they've worked out...<eos> Obviouasly, you can't burn coal any more because Al Gore goes nuts and a polar bear falls over, so they polish it up and then say it's precious.
Oh, yes! Yes.<eos> Now, right at the beginning of this series,<eos> Jeremy Clarkson said, when we were at a race track in Portugal - and he said it on the television - that if his McLaren P1 wasn't faster than Hammond's Porsche 918 or my Ferrari The Ferrari, we could knock his house down.<eos> Well, it wasn't, so, one weekend when Jeremy was away, we...<eos> Well, roll the tape.<eos> This is it, 200 years old and built from beautiful Cotswold stone.<eos> Now, I want to make it absolutely clear that this is Jeremy Clarkson's actual house.<eos> Yeah, it really is.<eos> I'd swear to my children's lives on that.<eos> It's Jeremy's house. He bought it when he fell in love with the view.
-Well...<eos> Sadly, before I could tell him, Jeremy arrived... in a snuff movie.<eos> Gentlemen, I can see what's happened. Wha...<eos> You're speechless, because all the words in your head have been sucked out by the magnetism of my genius.<eos> A car made from bone and skin.<eos> - What bones?<eos> - Animal bones.<eos> Bones are no good for this.<eos> You can't use bones to make cars.<eos> Why not? When your dog dies, what do you do now? You bury it.
Here it is.<eos> Oh, for God's sake!<eos> I like their marketing department a lot.<eos> I think that's enough Conversation Street, so let's get back to our film.<eos> Yes. Earlier on, I was in the right-hand-drive Ford Mustang, showing it the sights around our country.<eos> Unfortunately, he turned up and tried to argue that the similarly priced Ford Focus was a better bet.<eos> - Yeah, I did do that.<eos> -I responded by driving off and refusing to talk to you.<eos> A bit rudely, I thought.<eos> I'm sorry, this is my film, my tour of England, and I didn't want him spoiling it.
- It's better than Monterey Jack in a tube.<eos> - You're ruining this!<eos> No, you are, because you are telling everyone that the Mustang is better than the Focus.<eos> - Well, it is.<eos> - It isn't.<eos> - It is.<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> Look, I'm not saying this is perfect, cos it isn't.<eos> There's a vertical choppiness to the ride, which is annoying.<eos> If you put your phone in the phone holder in front of the gear lever and then accelerate, it shoots under the seat. You never see it again.
He's such a peasant, isn't he?<eos> It's just unbelievable.<eos> That evening in the restaurant, Hammond never did join us.<eos> But James and I were not short of company.<eos> Look, there's rhinos!<eos> There's actual rhinos!<eos> And they've been dehorned.<eos> They've had to take its horn out to stop poachers shooting it.<eos> But you know what the poachers are doing?<eos> They shoot the dehorned ones, because if they track for a couple of days, a rhino, and then it's got no horn, they shoot it, and then they'll never track it again, so it saves time.
"That doesn't even look like a beach buggy."<eos> It does and it is! It's a beach buggy.<eos> Enhanced, but in the spirit of beach buggying.<eos> - It isn't.<eos> - Jeremy, yours is... a freak.<eos> Had it existed 100 years ago, it would have been exhibited.<eos> People would come from miles and children would peak at it through curtains.<eos> "Look at the monster!"<eos> The point is, I have always loved the spirit of the beach buggy.<eos> I love the era that created it and all of that.
Get Gooti and Jonner to safety while you still can.<eos> Incoming targets.<eos> Intercept with the forward batteries.<eos> I got 'em. I got 'em!<eos> I didn't get them.<eos> His engines are hit. Power's fried from that coupling.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - We have to go.<eos> No, we have to save him.<eos> Hera gave you a direct order and you said you would follow it.
Then we threw him in my trunk and drove him to the dam.<eos> Fun.<eos> Then what happened?<eos> If we didn't intend to kill him...<eos> I mean, if it was an accident...<eos> You could still be looking at murder charges.<eos> I can't represent you, but if you tell us everything, I promise I'll get you the best possible defense.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I had my old helmet.<eos> We put it on and took turns tackling him like a practice dummy.
Being with Amy has awoken the sexual creature within.<eos> When I see a pretty gal walking down the street, I think,<eos> "hubba hubba" like any other guy.<eos> You kiss your mother with that mouth?<eos> 'Cause it's fine.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Shall we toast?<eos> To Howard and Bernadette, and the house key they never asked me to return.<eos> You said you got it back.
It's just so much easier to give him what he wants.<eos> Oh, true, but think of how much you've accomplished.<eos> Who got him to stop Purelling his pocket change?<eos> Me.<eos> And who got him to put things other than gloves in the glove compartment?<eos> Me.<eos> It was mittens.<eos> Mm.<eos> And who got him to try a turkey dog?<eos> That was actually Koothrappali, but I did let him spit it out in my hand.
I don't know what he's talking about, okay?<eos> I believe you.<eos> I even looked in here. I couldn't find anything about this document.<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, this is Lucy's journal.<eos> What... she never told you about it?<eos> - What's he talking about?<eos> - I didn't write it.<eos> Well, it's complicated.<eos> You see, she's going to write it - a few years from now.
Ooh, let's see.<eos> At the train station in 1865. The Nazi castle in Germany.<eos> Lucy, what have you told them about us?<eos> Is that true?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> No.<eos> The truth is not complicated.<eos> I don't know what the truth is anymore.<eos> Okay, the truth is she didn't believe in Rittenhouse until President Nixon just confirmed it.<eos> But for now, if Rittenhouse wants this document so badly, whatever it is, I want it first.

Let him?<eos> No, sir, I didn't let him.<eos> Like I had a choice...<eos> Isn't that what happened?<eos> It kills me that I couldn't help him.<eos> Couldn't or wouldn't?<eos> Look at me and answer the question.<eos> Couldn't.<eos> I could not save him.<eos> I had a choice, and a split second to make it, and I chose to protect my little girl.
That's the way this goes.<eos> That is all.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Tara?<eos> I-I'm so sorry to bother you, but I am in huge trouble.<eos> What happened?<eos> I moved all my stuff to the alley behind the building, but then, this big scary guy said it was his spot, and he grabbed my laptop and ran off...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, but my whole life is on that computer.<eos> If I don't get it back, I'm gonna get fired.
You know, I never thought I'd be a fugitive.<eos> Where you been?<eos> Walking, mostly.<eos> Hung out at Grand Central for a while.<eos> Surprised you didn't try to catch a train home.<eos> I thought about it, but I figured you'd have police looking for me up there, too.<eos> That's some good figuring.<eos> You bought a gun a couple of weeks ago-- you still got it?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna need you to give it to me.

Your chest sounds good.<eos> That's great.<eos> Let me.<eos> Mr. Collins, we're gonna have to redo your aortic valve replacement.<eos> - What?<eos> - Dr. Latham?<eos> Apical systolic murmur.<eos> I didn't hear it.<eos> It's subtle.<eos> I'm sorry, I still don't hear it.
Sorry, um...<eos> If you were living in a better situation, you might not be depressed.<eos> You mean leave them?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, I-I can't.<eos> These people, they'll hurt me.<eos> We can protect you.<eos> What about the heroin?<eos> I need it, you know that. They give it to me.
That's what we need, then.<eos> We just need a day to relax.<eos> (Laughing)<eos> (Children screaming happily)<eos> Woman (Over p.A.): A reminder, there is no running, no diving, and absolutely no glass containers in the pool area.<eos> Feeling relaxed yet?<eos> (Shouts, laughter)<eos> There's a chair!<eos> Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.<eos> Go get it!
But I have to if we're gonna have any chance of accessing The Thrushes' servers.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I've got my own Rubber Ducky.<eos> What if she doesn't have her laptop with her?<eos> Oh, she'll have it. Trust me.<eos> We're, uh... We're binge-watching "Stranger Things."<eos> Talk about life imitating art, huh?<eos> - How long to upload the worm?<eos> - A few minutes.<eos> I, uh, designed it to ping the main servers and to e-mail us GPS coordinates.
Um, should we wait for Jeremy to get back?<eos> Uh, no, his stomach goes bonkers when he's stressed out, so he might be a while.<eos> Uh, I wanted to talk to you about scheduling the DE.<eos> Dr. Karev said there was a surgery.<eos> Why aren't we doing that surgery?<eos> Because it's very risky to you, to the baby.<eos> I already have an expiration date.<eos> Aren't we past a little worried about some risks?<eos> If we did this, if we could remove the tumor and keep your pregnancy intact, by the time you deliver, the cancer will have still grown unchecked for six months.<eos> It'd be too far along by then for us to treat it.

- Come on!<eos> Hello?<eos> Max: Hey, so I know you said I shouldn't call you or whatever or I shouldn't call you back or anything, but I did something really stupid and I really need to meet up and chill out with your stuff, man.<eos> It's like totally an emergency!<eos> - I just found this phone on the street.<eos> - You what?<eos> I'm the delivery driver.<eos> I just found this phone.<eos> That's my friend's phone!<eos> I'll take it for him.
- Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> I really thought I was much stronger... than I actually am.<eos> Ah! There you go.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Have a good one.<eos> I started defrosting some lamb.<eos> Can you take it out of the refrigerator, - and we can put it in the rice?
But we're sitting ducks the second we step out of here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Alex, I don't know if you're still downtown or if you got out, but call me or text me as soon as you get this. I'm worried about you.<eos> But President Todd authorized the release of the prisoner they asked for.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> Boyer's release was a diversionary tactic.<eos> They planned the assassination all along.<eos> Why?<eos> To create fear...<eos> To disrupt the countries of the G20 as they dismantle their surveillance programs, to prove that not only spying was necessary, but they have to escalate it in order to prevent exactly what they're doing from happening again.
Your head doesn't even look good on your body.<eos> How are you not more worried about this?<eos> 'Cause, dude, they got no evidence.<eos> There's nothing that links us to the crime.<eos> That's not entirely accurate.<eos> Aw, is that the cow horn?<eos> Dude, why did you bring this here?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> When we got out of the Winnebago to check the damage,<eos> I picked it up.

- Really, this isn't funny.<eos> I liked it.<eos> What are you doing right now?<eos> Yeah, let me know how that pen works out, man.<eos> Hey, can I offer you guys a complimentary housewarming edible?<eos> Oh, that's very kind.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> We're fine, babe. - Oh. - Okay.<eos> I actually have a colleague who wanted your number.<eos> Can I just give it to her or do you need...
- How are you doin'?<eos> - Mm, good. So what do you guys want today?<eos> I got, uh...<eos> - I'm carrying pens now.<eos> - Oh, nice.<eos> And I got some edibles and, uh, of course I have just plain ol' flowers.<eos> - Oh, cool.<eos> - Cool case, man.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, the cops, they can't ask you to unlock it.
Well, you know, it could have gone a lot worse.<eos> But the thing is, it was my fucking fault because I didn't fucking double check a referral that came in to me last moment, and I thought I could just knock one off for the rest of the day.<eos> Goddammit, this job was supposed to be way more fucking chill than this!<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Just be glad you're okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And they didn't take my phone, which is good, I guess. Unless I fucking broke it just now.
It's kind of embarrassing.<eos> Why?<eos> I kept having to call Ralph on the big white phone.<eos> You were seasick?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, I accidentally dropped my phone in the toilet on the last one.<eos> I mean, doesn't even...<eos> even work now, if you need proof.<eos> No, that's all right.<eos> Yeah, I cleaned it.
I get it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Help him if you have to.<eos> But promise me you're not gonna hurt yourself in the process.<eos> I promise.<eos> Harbor Patrol and Customs will meet you on site.<eos> - What's the ETA?<eos> - Red Hook Harbor Master has the ship docking in 45 minutes.<eos> Is there a manifest?<eos> Yeah, already e-mailed it to you.
Okay, but what does that mean?<eos> Uh, you know, you do the-the... the... like,<eos> The Big Short.<eos> You do the Ponzu schemes.<eos> Oh, dude, it's ponzu sauce, Ponzi schemes.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Look, the point is, you don't know what I do, and that's fine.<eos> What difference does it make if I didn't watch The Manny?<eos> You hated the show!<eos> You were so ashamed of it, you quit.
Previously on This is Us...<eos> You took the sourest lemon that life has to offer. and turned it into something resembling lemonade.
I have financial aid.<eos> Oh!<eos> There you go.<eos> It says that your financial aid got rescinded because you failed to renew it.<eos> Tuscaloosa.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I didn't have to renew it.<eos> I have the four-year package.<eos> It came in this huge envelope.<eos> We had to use six stamps to mail it back.
No, stop.<eos> This is not your fault.<eos> She can stay with us - for a few days until this ends. - No.<eos> - Yes, Yes.<eos> - No, that woman cannot stay here.<eos> You don't get to make that decision.<eos> This is not about you.<eos> This is about our little girl, who is missing.<eos> Do you think I don't remember that every second?<eos> If that woman can help us get Casey back because she's Chris MacNeil... so crazy... if there's even a chance, we're gonna take it.
They think it was a bracelet that smashed to pieces on impact.<eos> Waste.<eos> You talking about the bracelet or the Vic?<eos> Bullets.<eos> Mr. Nealy was doomed the moment he stepped off that building.<eos> It's just...<eos> So, base jump parachutes don't have a rip cord.<eos> Instead, they have a pilot chute.<eos> It's held around the waist.<eos> You throw it out, the wind fills this, inflates it, and that, in turn, pulls the main chute from its case.

You're suggesting that Mark planned a different kind of memorial.<eos> I ran out of coffee, so I made us some tea.<eos> Anything useful?<eos> Amongst other things, confirmation that Bennett Nealy and his compatriots were in a sort of addiction spiral.<eos> Each stunt of theirs was more dangerous than the last.<eos> A cavalcade of risk, served up electronically to an audience of sensation-craving millennials.<eos> Your phone rang while you were downstairs.<eos> It was Marcus.<eos> The police pinged Mark Trenchman's phone.<eos> They found it in a trash can a block from where Nealy died.
That's your cab right there.<eos> You trying to tell us that's not you?<eos> Yeah, it's me, but...<eos> I didn't hurt that girl.<eos> Then what are you doing outside of the cab, standing over her in the park?<eos> I was... taking her wallet.<eos> Taking her wallet?<eos> Why?<eos> You just randomly happened upon this dead woman in the park, and decided you were gonna steal her wallet?<eos> I didn't steal it!
I blame the Iron Lady here.<eos> This is like when they brought in the second Aunt Viv.<eos> You remember that?<eos> That was messed up.<eos> Hey, Josh, what do you got?<eos> How about a murder weapon?<eos> A couple of beat cops just found a knife in a drainage ditch near Jones's residence.<eos> What kind of knife?<eos> Don't know, just came in.<eos> Killer must've dropped it down a sewer on his way out.
Restrict the Akkadian's movements, make him come to us.<eos> Nas, you and I'll clear the floor.<eos> Jane, you stay with Rich.<eos> You watch him.<eos> Be ready for anything.<eos> You're just gonna avoid the elephant in the room?<eos> You hid an elephant in there as well?<eos> Look, I'm sorry, all right?<eos> About the bug?<eos> Or the fact that we found it?
Move.<eos> Matty McConnell.<eos> Five-O!<eos> Well, it looks like the Lord of Lead finally got that Minigun he wanted.<eos> Be careful what you wish for.<eos> - Hi. - Hey.<eos> Just in time.<eos> This photo was uploaded to Matty McConnell's FlicPhoto account for his 12 million followers to see.<eos> Okay, but CSU never found McConnell's phone at the scene.<eos> We're thinking that the killer must have swiped it to access his social media.
- Are you...<eos> - Get out!<eos> Go!<eos> You want to do this again sometime?<eos> How could you possibly resist?<eos> Standard Hotel.<eos> Yeah, I'm, uh...<eos> I'm obsessed.<eos> And that hotel's a modern marvel of architecture.<eos> I think... if he were alive today and saw it...
Where is he?<eos> Who?<eos> Oh, I sort of made a deal with the Dark One and let him out of his cage for a ticket home.<eos> Regina!<eos> What if he's, like, razing villages or something?<eos> Well, dearie, on behalf of all Rumplestiltskins everywhere, I'm here to make good on my word.<eos> Sure you want to leave all this behind, Princess?<eos> Where's that bean, Rumple?<eos> As promised.<eos> Just throw it down and think about where you want to go.
A fight ensued, he or she was disarmed before grabbing the poker to finish the job.<eos> What specificity?<eos> Timing of the attack.<eos> Just as Mr. Cole gets home.<eos> Plus the fact that, by appearances, the only other thing missing is his laptop.<eos> This bag is dusty, bleached by the sun, apart from this area here.<eos> Now, this bag comes with a removable laptop sleeve.<eos> It sits right there.<eos> So, if his laptop is missing, perhaps the killer has it.<eos> Well, we haven't found it yet.
What do you mean, this one?<eos> This one.<eos> This...this floor.<eos> You're gonna take the whole floor?<eos> Look, there are five floors here.<eos> It's almost meant to be.<eos> So, Carol and I will take this one.<eos> Who wants the second floor?<eos> It's got a working ATM.<eos> - I'll take it.
This is ridiculous.<eos> H-How did you even get a warrant?<eos> We looked through the trash you put out on the curb last night, Mr. Lima.<eos> We found pet store receipts that show you purchased the supplies needed to house and feed a coastal taipan.<eos> The venom from that species poisoned seven people at Arrondissement 21 and killed your friend Brian Beale.<eos> I don't even know who that is.<eos> Sure you do.<eos> You went to Gracely High together.<eos> You signed his yearbook.<eos> We found it at his apartment.
(CHOPPER GRUNTING) Chopper! Hey, we have to find the brig.<eos> Hmm. This might be the last job Hera puts you in charge of for a while, big guy. Save it, kid.<eos> Now's not the time. Chopper!<eos> Right. Let's get off this ship.<eos> And be careful. That sentry droid's still around somewhere.<eos> Let it go by.<eos> Oh, oh, oh. Here we go!<eos> Take that!<eos> I told you to let it pass!<eos> It looked right at me, and I blasted it!
You've been looking at Gibbs weird all day, and now you're looking at Gibbs' desk weird.<eos> No.<eos> It's my subconscious-- it cracks me up sometimes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I had a-a dream about Gibbs last night.<eos> Oh, I totally get it.<eos> Was it the one where he tells you to grab your gear, and then, your gear is gone?<eos> No.<eos> Wait.<eos> Is it the one where he cooks you a steak, but it's raw inside, but you eat it anyway because he's staring at you?
The radicals and the left-wingers who, ten years before, had dreamt of changing America through revolution did nothing.<eos> They had retreated and were living in the abandoned buildings in Manhattan.<eos> The singer Patti Smith later described the mood of disillusion that had come over them.<eos> "I could not identify<eos> "with the political movements any longer," she said.<eos> "All the manic activity in the streets.<eos> "In trying to join them, I felt overwhelmed "by yet another form of bureaucracy."<eos> What she was describing was the rise of a new, powerful individualism that could not fit with the idea of collective political action.<eos> Instead, Patti Smith and many others became a new kind of individual radical, who watched the decaying city with a cool detachment.<eos> They didn't try and change it.
They weren't politicians, they were science fiction writers, and in their stories, they expressed the strange mood that was rising up as the Soviet Empire collapsed.<eos> Their most famous book was called Roadside Picnic.<eos> It is set in a world that seems like the present, except there is a zone that has been created by an alien force.<eos> People, known as "stalkers", go into the zone. They find that nothing is what it seems, that reality changes minute by minute.<eos> Shadows go the wrong way.<eos> There are hidden forces that twist your body and change the way you think and feel.<eos> The picture the Strugatskys gave was of a world where nothing was fixed.<eos> Where reality - both what you saw and what you believed - had become shifting and unstable.<eos> And in 1979, the film director Andrei Tarkovsky made a film that was based on Roadside Picnic.<eos> He called it Stalker.
- I told her...<eos> - No, no, stop!<eos> I don't care!<eos> No more fighting in front of Mateo.<eos> In addition to his tantrums, he is now biting people.<eos> And he is not an aggressive kid.<eos> So we are all gonna stay calm around him from now on, understand?<eos> !<eos> Starting now.<eos> Look, I know how upset you are about the choice I made, but I made it and it's done.
Sometimes.<eos> Everything okay, baby?<eos> Can I just say... I hate the way your mother treats you.<eos> Man, if you think Petra hated being frozen before, now people think she's sleeping with Scott.<eos> Okay, listen, when you caught me in Rafael's office, I wasn't checking up on the hotel's finances.<eos> I-I was looking for dirt.<eos> To blackmail him with.<eos> That's what I assumed.<eos> And so you know, I've got dirt on everyone at the Marbella.<eos> I've been collecting it for years.
- What do they want?<eos> - They want us to be together.<eos> - How?<eos> - The boy in the flier.<eos> He can bring me back.<eos> - Who is he?<eos> - The key to everything.<eos> The one that's gonna teach us. We're all dreaming the same dream.<eos> How'd you build this?<eos> Your mother built it for us.
Being confronted with what I want, not being what you want, not being what someone else wants. It just... surprised me.<eos> You were surprised by that?<eos> I suppose what I'm trying to say is, I never had a desire to leave the institute, disregard everything I've learned, abandon all my friends.<eos> I never felt the need to just leave and take 60 people with me.<eos> Everything you've learned.<eos> What have you learned there, Parker?<eos> Well, it helped me.<eos> I felt protected by it, elevated by it.<eos> And the institute teaches a freedom that does not exist out here.<eos> Can you stop calling it an institute?
I stole the knife that killed Jones.<eos> I was trying to protect you.<eos> Tasha, I didn't kill him.<eos> Why can't you believe me?<eos> Well, I believe you now.<eos> The knife isn't yours.<eos> It's Freddy's.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know it's Freddy's?<eos> I saw him with it when he was staying in your apartment.
Well, I believe you now.<eos> The knife isn't yours.<eos> It's Freddy's.<eos> What?<eos> How do you know it's Freddy's?<eos> I saw him with it when he was staying in your apartment.<eos> I have evidence for a murder case underneath a beach towel in my closet, and I can't figure out how to put it back without getting caught.<eos> Put it back?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That knife convicts Freddy, you can't put it back now.
Whoa, what are you doing?<eos> She's still lying to you, but it's not for Emile.<eos> That equipment that you were trying to get out of the catering van, there was a hard drive in there.<eos> The blast damaged the fireproof housing pretty badly, but the inside was intact.<eos> And I just cracked it.<eos> Yeah, very, very not good for you.<eos> She builds the money transfer sites for Marconi's sales, and they're pretty good, actually, super secure, unhackable, but the real beauty is... that her cut is automatically wired to her on completion of the sale.<eos> You want this Chen sale to go through because you're still getting paid.<eos> Except I just found your offshore bank account that you're transfer empties into... and it's just been seized by the FBI, so you're not gonna make a cent off this sale.<eos> And if it does go through, you'll be implicated in human trafficking, so I suggest you hand over the site you built and let us shut it down.
The auction's going live.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> My God.<eos> A top FBI official for sale on the black market is a unicorn.<eos> Weller is a wealth of intel.<eos> Look, the auction site is airtight.<eos> I've got my whole team trying to trace it to a location, and so does Patterson, but... that would take weeks.<eos> Weller and Chen will be long by then.<eos> Can't Lynn just shut it down?
- But Mommy is still his best.<eos> - The latest Dolan?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - New people! This is bad, guys.<eos> We'll need backup.<eos> It's like Ray Bradbury's The Martian Chronicles.<eos> We were saying that too.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Shit, the battery's dead!<eos> You didn't recharge it?
- What advice?<eos> You know, about living your life.<eos> Are you asking me if I have a guy here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?<eos> Okay, if you're gonna bust my balls, I'm gonna leave.<eos> Okay, I'm kidding.<eos> Listen, you remember that truck that Eva said she saw before her mom's disappearance? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, the blue camper.<eos> Yeah, I saw it the other day.
Sheldon, this is not a big deal.<eos> It's a little white lie, everyone does it.<eos> Not me,<eos> I'm a 100% honest in all of my relationships.<eos> And how single are you right now?<eos> Eating-cake-on-the-toilet single.<eos> Well, I won't tolerate deception in my relationship.<eos> I have no choice but to confront her.<eos> Don't do that, you've got gold here.<eos> Hang onto it until you're in trouble and then... throw it in her face.
- Your name is Daniel Lawrence.<eos> - How do you know my name?<eos> I'm your girlfriend.<eos> I've never been to Queens, and I don't know you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> All I want is to get back what I lost.<eos> Previously, on "Frequency"...<eos> You remember that truck that Eva said she saw before her mom's disappearance?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, the blue camper.<eos> Yeah, I saw it the other day.
So, uh, what exactly did Dana say on the phone?<eos> She owns this house, she rents it to her daughter and three of her friends.
Dana, tell me everything I need to know right now.<eos> I-I'm not proud of this, but I-I've been reading her diary.<eos> - What?<eos> - I was worried about her.<eos> She's been so moody and distant.<eos> Two days ago, she wrote that she wanted to kill Johnny.<eos> - Where's that diary now?<eos> - Before the police came, I searched her bedroom.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Please don't tell her I read it.
We were His first creations.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> We were loyal and perfect in every way.<eos> And do you know what God did?<eos> God got bored.<eos> He got bored with our perfection.<eos> So He created Man, mortal and ugly, and... and then<eos> He built them a sandbox, and He filled it with tangible and sensual delights.<eos> Delights that we could never feel or taste or experience.<eos> He created paradise, and he handed it over to a pack of primates rutting in the dirt.

- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Are you planning on speeding up at any point?<eos> Oh, my God, Schmidt, are you walking on a decline?<eos> This is what we call a "trudge," Jess.<eos> My wife has given up on me, why shouldn't I?<eos> Uh, license and registration, please.<eos> I had a great time last night, you know?<eos> And thank you for taking that cake off my hands.<eos> I would have eaten it for breakfast.
- Okay.<eos> There we go.<eos> Donovan, these terms are unacceptable.<eos> He's really screwing you.<eos> - Aww... - You know what?<eos> I'm gonna get on the phone with him, because if we start treating our attractive people like this, our society is gonna collapse.<eos> Hey, man, you busy writing?<eos> - What does it look like?<eos> - Want a rain-stick?<eos> Some girl gave it to me.
So, you'll just be swimming in beefcakes all day and then you'll just... be coming home to this sock full of meatloaf.<eos> Uh-huh, sister.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> I'm going back to the gym.<eos> Don't need this fat man scarf.<eos> - Want help?<eos> You got it?<eos> - You didn't like my gift?<eos> It just goes on forever.<eos> You literally just got to take it off.
Now it's in the courts' hands.<eos> You can wait for a decision if you want, but I got to tell you...<eos> I'll take our lawyers over theirs any day.<eos> If you don't mind, I have a lunch meeting.<eos> You want to help me, don't you?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> When I was pressuring your boss, you retrieved a document from a printer just a few feet behind us.<eos> Despite the fact that there's another printer of higher quality and faster output much closer to your desk.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You then disposed of said document without even reading it.
Papa, Papa, come in here!<eos> Hey, Papa's here.<eos> Papa, I'm so scared.<eos> There's a monster in my closet.<eos> Oh, buddy. Shh.<eos> It's okay, I'm here.<eos> Monster's aren't real, my little pierogi.<eos> But I saw it.
But we got 'em there, and we got 'em back.<eos> You can use this photo for your book, if you'd like.<eos> What was security like at NASA on the day of the Moon landing?<eos> I can only imagine stricter than usual.<eos> Sure, threat of Commie spies...<eos> I mean, that was really a big deal.<eos> They gave everyone in my department new ID badges with a special magnetic strip, first of its kind.<eos> You wouldn't happen to still have that badge, would you?<eos> I wish I did.<eos> I could make a fortune with it on eBay.
Looks like we have a winner.<eos> The birdie with the broken wing.<eos> Aw.<eos> Casey, dear.<eos> I want you to pick up that hammer.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on. There we go.<eos> Good.<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> Yeah. Pick it up.
I couldn't just take the compliment.<eos> I had to ask why.<eos> You know, I do understand what you're feeling.<eos> My brother and sister's accomplishments have always been held over my head.<eos> How did you deal with it?<eos> I wet the bed until college, but I don't think that's a quality fix.<eos> I can't believe I was surpassed by a geologist.<eos> I mean... rocks!<eos> He studies rocks!<eos> If rock is so great, how come paper beats it?
If you and Ducky's mother were such a hot item, why did she take out an ad in the paper looking for an old fiancé?<eos> She didn't.<eos> I did.<eos> In her delirium at the end, she thought she saw Balthazar in the street.<eos> So she asked me to place an ad to find him.<eos> I didn't feel slighted.<eos> She wasn't well.<eos> And I would have done anything for her.<eos> Look, you don't have to believe me.<eos> She wrote it all down in her diary, and she gave it to me when she got sick.
Yo, you need help lighting that?<eos> All right. Where's your damn wallet?<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Get it out!<eos> I'm getting it. I'll cut you, man.<eos> I swear. Take it easy. I'm getting it.
Garrett, this isn't just an image problem for us.<eos> There is a practical problem as well.<eos> That's right.<eos> The investigation is stalling out because the community has stopped cooperating.<eos> They're buying into when Potter says we can't be trusted.<eos> Which is why we have to get him back on our side publicly.<eos> And immediately.<eos> The longer we let this case go on, the more it's gonna cost us in the long run.<eos> So, what, we bow down to Potter just because he's on the megaphone once again?<eos> But in this case, he is using it as a man who lost his only son.
Do you guys know - a drug dealer named Flaco?<eos> - Oh, yeah, he's a big-time supplier, consolidated half the territory in Brooklyn.<eos> Well, the bag belongs to one of his runners, and it contains, like, a football's worth of cocaine...<eos> I'm not good with sizes...<eos> and a cell phone.<eos> And you think that the cell phone might have Intel that could lead us to Flaco.<eos> I do now.<eos> That's a great theory!<eos> Whoa. But the bag is missing, so...<eos> Hey, how big of a deal is it if I, um, if I never find it?
Thank you.<eos> I'll be right back with all the cellos.<eos> Oh, Rihanna, yeah.<eos> Oscar...<eos> Wake up!<eos> Hey!<eos> That was like an actual sit-up.<eos> What time is it?<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> I took it from you last night, remember?
No wonder you didn't have time for a haircut.<eos> I know, look at me.<eos> I'm like one of the Grateful Deads.<eos> What's this?<eos> Open it.<eos> It wouldn't be Christmas if I didn't make my famous buche de Noel.<eos> Hey, what a coincidence,<eos> Felix made... sure that there's plenty of counter space in the kitchen for your masterpiece.<eos> Ah, perfect as usual.<eos> I will find a home for it in the kitchen.
Apparently, its owner, Mr. Durant, had been giving a few lessons on how to butcher your own meat, and that attracted the attention of the animal rights movement.<eos> None of the protestors suffered from albinism, however...<eos> That guy has vitiligo.<eos> Yeah, we're not looking for an albino.<eos> We're looking for this fellow here.<eos> And who is he?<eos> Got no idea.<eos> The woman he's having a heated discussion with, however, that's a nurse at Mountview Hospital in Bayside.<eos> I see the scrubs, but there's no way to read the I.D. tag from this angle.<eos> Don't need to read it.
This world is not safe.<eos> Not for me, and especially not for you.<eos> So get out.<eos> While you still can.<eos> It's now or never, Doc.<eos> Hello?<eos> You turned your phone off, Watson.<eos> Or the battery died.<eos> In either case, shame on you.<eos> Actually, I put it on silent.
I told him I wanted to talk.<eos> I haven't heard back.<eos> Just as well. 'Cause the conversation we're gonna have is better had in person.<eos> Shinwell, it's Joan.<eos> So, you don't think he killed Ricky Morales.<eos> I also assume you don't think he's on the other side of that door, pointing a Nambu pistol at us?<eos> I mean, I can't guarantee it.<eos> Wherever he is, he's left his phone.<eos> Perhaps he's worried the police might use it to locate him.<eos> Hmm? Or he forgot it.

Or he forgot it.<eos> He also forgot to close those drawers, as one might do from when they're packing in a hurry.<eos> His toolbox is gone.<eos> I gave it to him as a housewarming gift.
I need your help, Doc.<eos> Something happened last night.<eos> A member of a rival gang was shot and killed in SBK territory-- you were there, weren't you?<eos> I didn't have nothin' to do with what happened to that man.<eos> Next you're gonna tell me that you're not back with SBK.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Then what is it?<eos> You want my help, right?<eos> Here's your phone.<eos> I got it from your apartment.
You and Tall Boy were in a club.<eos> He got a text around half past midnight.<eos> You both left.<eos> You went to dispose of the body.<eos> That's why you were at the scene almost an hour after the murder took place.<eos> Yeah, the police showed up right after we did.<eos> But we ran.<eos> Which one of you threw the gun?<eos> Me.<eos> Tall Boy gave it to me weeks ago.

It's the cloth I used to wipe the gun.<eos> Hadn't been processed yet.<eos> When it is, there won't be any prints on it.<eos> It's your second second chance.<eos> Do make the most of it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> About...?<eos> Table.<eos> I saw it downstairs.<eos> Thought I'd restore it as a gift.
A woman named Janine Roth.<eos> I was picking her up from work that night.<eos> I couldn't tell Marla, so I lied about how the window broke and kept the rest to myself.<eos> I was a bad husband.<eos> But Marla, she was a saint.<eos> Okay, the stress on her, the time and effort to take care of Ethan, I could have never done that.<eos> And I could never have hurt her.<eos> So where's the gun now?<eos> In the garage at the house.<eos> I stashed it in my tool drawer after I shot the man who attacked me and Janine.

It seems pretty unlikely.<eos> Last week, I lost my car at the mall.<eos> I was sure it was on P4, but I found it an hour later.<eos> You'll never guess where I found it.<eos> P3.<eos> What, you think there's a downstairs, do you?<eos> It's a bloody street, love.<eos> My van has been stolen...<eos> My child's wheelchair van.<eos> I bet she parked it somewhere else.
Uh, we have some bad news.<eos> Yeah, I was in the track meeting, and, uh, when I came outside, the van was stolen.<eos> What?<eos> Our van?<eos> But...<eos> Oh, no.<eos> How's JJ gonna get around?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We filed a report.<eos> They'll either replace it or insurance will cover it.
You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.<eos> I've been on that side of the table.<eos> I know what you wanna do.<eos> You want to keep me talking long enough... hoping I'll reveal something about where we might be.<eos> I could do the same... hoping you might tell us something about your beautiful wife.<eos> I'm not wearing a ring, Will.<eos> No.<eos> But you are wearing a tan line, meaning you removed it before you walked in here and that you had a holiday recently.
- Can you fly?<eos> - That's a piece of cake.<eos> - Show me next time.<eos> How many other brides have there been before me?<eos> The first and last one.<eos> I understand you saying that I'm your first. But how do you know that I'll be your last?<eos> Because that's what I've decided.<eos> What happens if I say that I won't be your bride?<eos> I won't ever be able to get this blade out.<eos> You're the only one who can pull it out, you see.
- Unbelievable.<eos> You're heading home, right?<eos> Is this your delayed reaction about the fact that Eun Bi is Hye Jin's daughter?<eos> What is going on?<eos> What kind of memory is that?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What is it?<eos> What'll happen if I say that I won't be your bride?<eos> I won't ever be able to get this blade out.<eos> You're the only one who can pull it out, you see.
They took my horse.<eos> - Really?<eos> Just stay there.<eos> How much do you love your master?<eos> I'll do it.<eos> Back off!<eos> Pity.<eos> It would have make a good coat.<eos> Over here!<eos> - You took it alone.
Protect the king.<eos> I got them.<eos> Move back!<eos> Shield FORMATION !<eos> Retreat to the plateau.<eos> Fall back!<eos> Up the hill.<eos> Move!<eos> Medivh.<eos> Medivh, take it down!
- Then why is it fried?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> Here we go.<eos> - I need a new phone.<eos> - You do?<eos> No more phones, honey.<eos> This isn't a luxury item, Dad.<eos> It's a necessity.<eos> What if you need to reach me in an emergency?<eos> We can't afford it, honey.
I can put it on Monday morning if you like.<eos> What time do I start?<eos> Nine?<eos> They just moved to Willow Point.<eos> My brother had a house in that development back in the 90s.<eos> We'd never visit him because of the cemetery thing.<eos> The thought of it just gave me the willies.<eos> What "cemetery thing"?<eos> Just that that development was built on a former cemetery.<eos> - Yeah, but they moved it though.
All right, just so we're all clear.<eos> First, we use the rope to bridge the way in to the way out.<eos> The rules are different in there.<eos> There is no up, there is no down... and there are no straight lines.<eos> Which is why we have to make one.<eos> This rope is our lifeline.<eos> If we let go of it, we'll never find our way back.<eos> It worked!<eos> Once we've done that... we send the drone in to get eyes on Maddy.<eos> Keep it steady, now.
Yeah.<eos> The box in our kitchen that keeps things cold.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. Uh, what about it?<eos> It's leaking... it's been leaking for two weeks.<eos> The refrigerator's leaking.<eos> Please don't do that thing where you repeat part of what I said so I'll think you're paying attention.<eos> I'm not doing anything.<eos> The refrigerator's leaking, I didn't notice.<eos> Can't you just fix it?
- You're late.<eos> - Am I?<eos> I get it.<eos> I left you for dead in Kabul... and this is your pretty cheap revenge.<eos> Can't buy the sky, Carson.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> I'm the bad guy to you... because I'm trying to protect our country... our American culture.<eos> You can't stop the future with one silly, desperate act.<eos> I'll build another rocket.<eos> There was a second payload, with weapons... and you almost got it by everybody.
Beneath that hangar Skynet has hidden its final weapon.<eos> When Skynet realizes it has lost, it will deploy that weapon to ensure its own survival.<eos> We take it tonight, or there is no tomorrow.<eos> Then we'll take it.<eos> You're my right hand, Reese, and I've never thanked you for it.<eos> You don't need to.<eos> You gave us all a future, John.<eos> I'm gonna use mine.<eos> When this is all over, I'm gonna find my parents' house.<eos> Rebuild it.
Rebuild it.<eos> Use my hands for something other than killing.<eos> How about you?<eos> A cold beer would be good.<eos> - That's some pretty big plans. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I guess I don't think about it too much.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Well, I figure, whatever happens, it's got to be better than this.<eos> So many of us have died to get here.<eos> I want you to know, Kyle, if there was another way, I would have taken it.
Even if it kills me.<eos> Anyway, that's the kind of man your son was.<eos> Is.<eos> Will be.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Time travel makes my head hurt.<eos> Alternate timelines are not complicated.<eos> It's merely a matter of tracking possible futures using an exponential growth and decay algorithm.<eos> Right.<eos> There is a switch, and I will find it.
Fire!<eos> See that?<eos> - See that? - Yeah.<eos> That is magic.<eos> Huh?<eos> We want to take that bridge.<eos> Now we are going to take that bridge.<eos> Formation!<eos> - Formation! - Formation!<eos> That bridge, we are taking it!
I just wanna see the landsman scared.<eos> Mr. Coffin, put the pistol down.<eos> That's an order! - Do as the captain says!<eos> Now! - Say it!<eos> - Henry. - Say it!<eos> Say it!<eos> Henry!<eos> Put the pistol down.<eos> Henry!<eos> Put it down.
Good day to you, Captain.<eos> For the record, then...<eos> The Essex was stove by a white whale 1,200 leagues west of Ecuador.<eos> It was as if Owen Chase himself had spoken.<eos> Told them the truth.<eos> Captain Pollard's conscience was clear.<eos> But the inquiry was a sham.<eos> Pollard went out again,<eos> looking for the white whale.<eos> He never found it.
Wait, what?<eos> This is a science fair not a magic competition.<eos> I don't see any real science here.<eos> And you're paying for the backboard.<eos> - Did you put in the sensors? - Everything is the same.<eos> I know, but your smashing the buttons.<eos> It's delicate, you can't smash it.<eos> Hey, kid, I'm really sorry about your plane.<eos> You're a dick.<eos> - You cranked it up too high. - I didn't crank it up too high.
- Oh! Oh! - Oh, my God!<eos> - Oh, my gosh!<eos> - Goddamn it!<eos> Oh, my God! Why did you have me do that?<eos> Oh, I didn't have the sensor activated.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm an idiot.<eos> - Do it again.<eos> - No, absolutely not.<eos> - It'll be fine. I just activated it.
- I love you. That's what I said.<eos> - I love you too. - I said, I love you.<eos> Let's just see how far it is.<eos> - You are 9.2 miles from destination.<eos> - All right. Check the best route.<eos> Oh, I changed the language.<eos> That's not it, heh.<eos> What is that?<eos> - Uh, I don't know. Korean?<eos> - Oh, God, it's horrible. Just please turn it off.
Well, the guy also did not know he had a rat on his shoulder, so there's that.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Wow, honey, this is beautiful.<eos> - Isn't it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> All right, everyone.<eos> In your bathing suits.<eos> Now!<eos> Looks like we found our own private hot spring.<eos> - I say we call it "Griswold Springs." - Heh.
Oh, my God, yeah.<eos> He's been on Dr. Oz like 10 times.<eos> He's one of the top five reproductive endocrinologists in the country.<eos> See? People wait years to get an appointment with this guy.<eos> Do you really think he would see us?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, hold on.<eos> - I know he would.<eos> If anybody can help you have a baby, he can.<eos> Mommy's going to have a baby?<eos> Cool! Can we name it Griff?

Can we name it Griff?<eos> Thanks, D-man.<eos> Look, you guys, I don't know if this is a good idea.<eos> You don't wanna name your baby after a black person?<eos> You probably want to name it something really white, like Connor or Gordon.
Michael, do you hear me?<eos> I want my money back.<eos> Give me my fucking money back you motherfucker.<eos> The market's in an itsy-bitsy little gully right now.<eos> It's like everybody said, "Okay, that was crazy.<eos> "Let's just all calm down."<eos> I sold that house for $350,000 the year it was built.<eos> Two years later, $480,000.<eos> Then $585,000 maybe 18 months ago.<eos> This couple bought it for $650,000 last year.
Well, my firm offers NINJA loans.<eos> Okay.<eos> "No Income, No Job."<eos> I just leave the income section blank if I want.<eos> Corporate doesn't care.<eos> These people just want homes.<eos> And they go with the flow.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Your companies don't verify?<eos> If I write a loan on Friday afternoon, a big bank will buy it by Monday lunch.
Are you worthy of becoming the 37th?<eos> I testify that I am.<eos> Do you promise to serve our brother Kaulder in all things?<eos> To know him only as he knows himself?<eos> I promise.<eos> So you're the new guy.<eos> We've actually met before.<eos> A long time ago.<eos> You see that cornerstone?<eos> I watched them lay it in when this was nothing more than a cornfield.
I also got another meeting with her later today.<eos> So, what, we just let Gaby go with Uncle Rudi?<eos> If there's a chance he'll lead us to her father, do we have a choice?<eos> This could be like leading lamb to slaughter.<eos> Going soft, peril?<eos> What you talking about?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Your tracker's not sending a signal.<eos> Have you turned it on?
Yeah.<eos> And they don't have girls in Jersey?<eos> It's not that.<eos> It... people know me back home.<eos> It's hard to go out and have privacy.<eos> I should go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Can I have your number?<eos> I don't have any paper.<eos> Write it on my arm.
because she was right?<eos> Because in this one instance justice has prevailed.<eos> Come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you, detective Wells.<eos> We anguish over this situation.<eos> And detective hester is in our prayers.<eos> But our decision is gonna have to stand.<eos> The state made a bad law.<eos> The state made a bad law and it's up to them to fix it.
I love motorcycles and she hates them.<eos> Our house, it isn't fancy.<eos> But it was a labor of love.<eos> You know, working on it and renovating it.<eos> And Laurel put a lot of thought into every detail.<eos> The light fixtures and the tile.<eos> And, um...<eos> We worked so hard on it 'cause we thought we were gonna live in it forever.<eos> But I guess that's not gonna happen.<eos> So the house, I'd just really like to hold onto it, you know?
Order arms!<eos> About face!<eos> Piece of garbage.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's not so bad.<eos> Maybe I'll keep it.<eos> Do you want it?<eos> You want it back?<eos> Then you're gonna have to get it.<eos> Come and get it.
Give me two.<eos> I'm sure Ari has seen an unfinished film before.<eos> Not one I've directed.<eos> You're really nervous, huh?<eos> It's cute.<eos> What, you never get nervous before a photo shoot?<eos> No, I know what I look like.<eos> Everyone make sure you fill out a non-disclosure agreement or you cannot stay for the screening.<eos> Oh, e, this house is sick.<eos> When did Vince buy it?
Yeah, and he's in my movie.<eos> Oh. Just four scenes.<eos> Four pivotal scenes.<eos> He's amazing.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One of the reasons why I wanted to make this movie is because I knew what that role would do for my big bro.<eos> It's gonna change his life.<eos> Thanks, bro.<eos> Well, I can't wait to see it.
The past behaviors that almost ended your marriage.<eos> Yes.<eos> You don't feel that is true, Ari?<eos> No, of course I don't feel that It's true 'cause It's not true.<eos> I promised my wife that If she let me go back to work, it would be nothing but fun, and it has been.<eos> I do almost nothing but smile all day.<eos> And the anger meds didn't make me calm.<eos> They just made me not able to come, which just made me angry.<eos> And just made my wife sore.<eos> Now, currently, I am a little bit stressed about this giant movie because I haven't been able to see it until yesterday.
No, this isn't pointless.<eos> I get the point.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, n-not thank you, but, I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Whew.<eos> It's still too bleak.<eos> Yes, this movie will be an Oscar contender, but it also has commercial appeal, as well.<eos> The poster needs to let toothless guys in Texas, who snort meth and possibly fuck their sisters, know that It's also fun for a Saturday night.<eos> If only we could see it, Ari.

We're all in it.<eos> We minimize our risk.<eos> And maximize our position as pussies by kowtowing to cowtippers?<eos> I told you, with this movie, I didn't want any of their fucking farm money.<eos> I didn't need it.<eos> The board disagreed.<eos> And so did I.<eos> About how much you spent and about how you made it.<eos> So this is all about Vince.<eos> Nobody thought he had any business directing this film, but you bullied it through.
I'm grasping' at straws here, Ari.<eos> I-I don't know how to fix my problems.<eos> Vincent chase is great in this movie.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> He sucks.<eos> His too-pretty face ruins the fuckin' thing.<eos> It's distracting.<eos> How the hell are you gonna fix his face with editing?<eos> I guess I'm not.<eos> Which is why I told my father we should just bite the bullet, put some more money into this thing, and reshoot it with new actors and a different director.
This is where you want to be, and, Maria, already people are starting to ask the question,<eos> "who will the big winners be?"<eos> Mm-hmm. If you've been paying attention, you probably get the idea that Vincent chase and "Hyde"<eos> are gonna have a huge night.<eos> That's right, Matt.<eos> "Hyde" has been a box office monster with $450 million worldwide and counting, five nominations, including best picture and two acting nods.<eos> And that surprise of the year.<eos> You have a best-supporting-actor nomination for Johnny chase, and he's only in four scenes in the movie.<eos> What'd I tell you, turtle?<eos> You visualize success, you get it.

You never met a bear like this, before, Beckett.<eos> And if you did, you wouldn't know what to do with it.<eos> - Alright, are you done?<eos> - Yeah, I'm done.<eos> OK.<eos> - I'm just tellin' ya.<eos> - And I'm hearin' ya.<eos> Sully, call me after you find the next body, 'cause you will find it.<eos> Beckett!<eos> When you're out there... and you see that, listen to me... and you see that bear, you kill it.
You go in there without a local guide, without somebody who grew up here, somebody who really knows the trails, you're gonna die.<eos> - Ah! - You gotta trust the locals on this.<eos> Beckett's been out there since he was a kid.<eos> - He'll find that bear.<eos> - Yeah, b... must be somebody to help him.<eos> Here.<eos> You mind... carrying' this for me?<eos> - It's a tranquilizer gun.<eos> - You really wanna capture this bear?<eos> Well, I... prefer to save it.
He's down there.<eos> Came to find Michelle.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, what the hell do you think you're doin'?<eos> Leavin'.<eos> No, you're not, alright?<eos> No, 'cause I need you to take the girls back down, tomorrow, OK?<eos> There's a killer bear out here.<eos> Three people are already dead.<eos> I need to get after it.
To help the one guy, who stood up for me.<eos> Thought it'd be a great idea to hide it from me?<eos> Three people dead.<eos> Michelle got attacked.<eos> - Yeah, that's right, and I saved her life.<eos> - That's not what I'm talkin' about, dumbass!<eos> I tell you my wife is out here camping' and you keep quiet?<eos> Johnny Cadillac and a couple of poachers didn't go down by no bear.<eos> You take the girls home, tomorrow.<eos> If I see your bear, I'll kill it.
It's almost like he knew better than to give me a clean shot.<eos> That was the biggest bear I've ever seen.<eos> Michelle says that it's... she never got a chance to thank you.<eos> It's OK.<eos> And... I'm-I'm sorry, OK?<eos> I could really use your help on this.<eos> Look, I'm not givin' up on Johnny, so whatever you need from me, just don't ask me to do that.<eos> And if Douglas is out there, he's gonna beat us to it, anyway.<eos> That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Do you wanna kill this bear, or do you wanna save it?
Do you only have one suit?<eos> Well, I left Moscow with only $25.<eos> Russia has very little foreign currency, and that was all they could afford to give us.<eos> I get paid expenses here in Mexico.<eos> Or I get paid expenses, and I have to share with Tisse and Grisha.<eos> That suit is taking some punishment.<eos> You should buy yourself another.<eos> It's my first American suit.<eos> I bought it to walk down Sunset Boulevard with Charlie Chaplin.<eos> It's a sentimental matter. I could not part with it.
We just need... My plane!<eos> There it is!<eos> It's okay.<eos> Hurry!<eos> We did it!<eos> No!<eos> Which button?<eos> No, no, no...<eos> Yes!<eos> We can catch it on top of the next pile!
And that will get worse.<eos> This okay?<eos> Who is Jackie Joyner-Kersee?<eos> You don't like chicken noodle soup?<eos> How the fuck do you not like chicken noodle soup?<eos> I don't like noodles, okay?<eos> Makes me think of worms.<eos> Surprise.<eos> My uncle took me fishing one time.<eos> He took the worm, put it in his mouth and he ate it just to fuck with me, okay?
Okay, very good.<eos> -Yeah, yeah.<eos> -Anyway, checkout's noon.<eos> -Sweet.<eos> Christ, what, did he send you out here to check up on me?<eos> Well, the hotel didn't know what to do with the damn piano.<eos> So I thought you might want it.<eos> -I don't want his piano.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> Well, it took six hours to move it out of the Hilton and I don't know anyone else in New Jersey.

Daddy'll get me the bodies... then I have to get my consciousness out of here and into there.<eos> - The helmet!<eos> - No. What are you doing?<eos> - I can use this.<eos> - Put that back. Leave it alone.<eos> - Put that down.<eos> It's illegal!<eos> - I'm gonna take it! No.<eos> - Chappie. Chappie, wait!<eos> - I'm taking it!
It was uncalled for.<eos> But you should consider the threat to be valid.<eos> Your computer virus.<eos> - Did you send it out from this machine?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So if I break this computer, your virus dies with it?<eos> No, silly goose.<eos> The virus has already spread throughout the city.<eos> So the virus cannot be stopped?<eos> There's no way to deactivate it?
Thank you.<eos> Personally I'm of the opinion that for a paper to best perform its function, it really needs to stand alone.<eos> Ah. Of course.<eos> But my offer still stands.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come in.<eos> Ah.<eos> Thank you, Maureen.<eos> A little gift, Marty.<eos> Think of it as a Cardinal's guide to the city of Boston.
Tom Doyle, the secretary canonist for the Papal Nuncio, co-authored a report warning pedophile Priests were a billion-dollar liability.<eos> That was in 1985.<eos> 1985?<eos> That's right.<eos> Who saw that report?<eos> Anyone from the catholic hierarchy?<eos> Sure.<eos> Doyle tried to introduce the report at the national conference of catholic bishops.<eos> In fact, Cardinal law initially helped to fund the report.<eos> But then he backed out and they shelved it.
I watched you die.<eos> - You look terrible.<eos> - You've looked better.<eos> You're not even remotely nice to say that to me now.<eos> I was never the nice one.<eos> You were.<eos> When I saw you die, I remembered something.<eos> About the bread.<eos> I remember... you in the rain.<eos> And I burned it on purpose.
If I kept it open, it would ruin the effect, which is everything.<eos> Pardon my wife.<eos> She has no respect for showmanship.<eos> - Hugo Gernsback.<eos> How may I help you? - She has a pin.<eos> She has a pin.<eos> I saw that you were looking for one online...<eos> - Where did you get it?<eos> - What can you tell me about it?<eos> I can't tell you anything about it unless you tell me who gave it to you.
Pleasure.<eos> Well, Frank, it's been wonderful catching up, but as we were fairly clear about the terms of your exile and the consequences of violating it,<eos> I have to ask what the hell are you doing here?<eos> I think she can fix it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I think she can fix it, David.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> I've been pirating your signal.<eos> Every time you turn it on here, I can see it there.
No, you didn't.<eos> Systems failing.<eos> Activating last thoughts saved for Frank Walker.<eos> Log 15: September 1965.<eos> Frank Walker is looking at me in a manner that is difficult to recognize.<eos> It seems imperative to explain to him that I am an Audio-Animatronic...<eos> Athena...<eos> But I am concerned that he may be adversely affected when he finds out that I am not human.<eos> He has potential.<eos> I don't want to damage it.
Okay. And that's why people shouldn't do drugs.<eos> It weakens their defenses. It's true.<eos> That's why I stopped doing the hard stuff.<eos> Yeah, and hey, besides, everybody knows that all of that stuff from those shows is like totally made up anyway.<eos> Which is why they're stupid, kinda like Tyler.<eos> You're... You're a dumb-ass, Sean.<eos> Okay, I've only...<eos> I haven't seen the show every week, all right'?<eos> I've only seen it maybe three times.<eos> The world is going to hell in a hand basket, and my man sees it that way.
No, no, she loves hockey.<eos> She can't give up hockey.<eos> - Hey! Look at that!<eos> Very nice shot!<eos> - Hey!<eos> Bing bong, we have to get to that station.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> This way, just past Graham cracker castle. Hey. That's weird.<eos> Graham cracker castle used to be right here.<eos> I wonder why they moved it?
You know, they got sodas in the store.<eos> Water is free, White.<eos> How long have you guys been at it?<eos> Since five.<eos> Five?<eos> 5:00 a.m., White.<eos> "AM" means morning, ese.<eos> Not the radio.<eos> Hey, White.<eos> Chop and channel your Jeep, glass finish it, crank up the bass, hop up and down... You'll fit right in.
They're too busy going to discos and having sex with each other.<eos> It's actually a pretty cool lifestyle.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I really like your pin.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Where'd you get yours?<eos> - My friends gave them to me.<eos> Where'd you get yours?<eos> I made it, actually, at this prison pen-pal convention thing.
Coming through.<eos> I'm one of tonight's heroes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I think I might have found our next trophy.<eos> It's Q*bert.<eos> Yeah, I know! I know.<eos> Can I kill it?
You gonna go back to the Nerd Brigade?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Probably.<eos> I mean...<eos> What else would I do?<eos> I mean, it just seems like someone with your skills, you'd be better off inventing technology rather than installing it.<eos> No, of course.<eos> I would love to do somethin' different.<eos> You know, I had my shot when I was a kid in the arcades.<eos> But I blew it.
Then we're predicting them.<eos> Then we are predicting them.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Hi, Dad.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> I was wondering if there was room for my bike.<eos> Thought that I could ride it to class, then I wouldn't have to buy a parking pass.<eos> That's a great idea.<eos> I'm sure I could figure out a way to fit it in.
Why were you standing by my house earlier?<eos> Uh, I was waiting on your dad.<eos> - Did you get all wet?<eos> - Oh, just a little.<eos> Wanna say hi to your grandfather?<eos> Could we go feed the ducks now? Come on.<eos> Let's go put your coats on.<eos> - Okay, Lily, you got the bread?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - You're gonna hold on to it?
- Oh, just a little.<eos> Wanna say hi to your grandfather?<eos> Could we go feed the ducks now? Come on.<eos> Let's go put your coats on.<eos> - Okay, Lily, you got the bread?<eos> - Yup.<eos> - You're gonna hold on to it?<eos> - Got it!<eos> You have to give some to your sister too, okay?<eos> No, I won't eat it.
- Si.<eos> They make signs to stop people.<eos> - Even on the Champs-Élysées?<eos> - No, it's too classy.<eos> - Clément's come back to help. - Yeah, I can see.<eos> He was just telling me about Paris.<eos> - Hot chocolate?<eos> - No, I prefer coffee.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'll make it.
I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Elliot!<eos> Shit.<eos> So how will you get to Paris?<eos> By train.<eos> So why don't you?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I want to find the deer.<eos> This is stupid. Putain.<eos> What will you do if you find it?
Elliot!<eos> Shit.<eos> So how will you get to Paris?<eos> By train.<eos> So why don't you?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I want to find the deer.<eos> This is stupid. Putain.<eos> What will you do if you find it?<eos> I'll bury it.

- And I... - Yeah?<eos> Basically, I'm just trying to avoid ending up on the pole.<eos> Like you.<eos> But you never know.<eos> Stripper Pissing on Beach in Contemplative Pose could sell for thousands one day.<eos> If that's true, I will whip it out and start peeing on whatever you tell me to pee on...<eos> - Heh. - ...and we can just cash in.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> I love the enthusiasm.<eos> Save some of it, though, because you and I are going to untie that sailboat... and organize a first-ever cross-dressing search party out to that island.
- I shouldn't have closed my eyes.<eos> - Well, that's definitely true.<eos> Fuck, yeah.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> - Hey, go easy on him. - Easy?<eos> He's fine.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine, but the truck...<eos> Yeah, the truck is towed.<eos> It's going to take a few days to fix it.
- I don't even know what that means!<eos> - Guys, just chill.<eos> This is the comedown from the Molly. Get a grip.<eos> You're goddamn right it's a comedown.<eos> This trip's over!<eos> All I wanted was one more fucking ride!<eos> Is that too much to ask?<eos> Is Richie gonna cry because life isn't exactly the way he wants it right now?<eos> Oh, okay, Mr. CEO.<eos> Why don't you take your bullshit advice and give it to your fucking employees?
It's a long, long story, but, uh...<eos> Rome and I met each other at a very interesting time in our lives and... I guess you could say that we had a thing.<eos> - I'd say you had a thing.<eos> - Yeah, well... until I, uh, went to work with Dallas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So is she going to come help us, or what?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't think that's going to actually happen.<eos> Rome likes to stay in her castle.<eos> That's why she built it.
Doctor's in the house, baby. The doctor has checked into the building!<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Fuck, Ken!<eos> - Whoo! - What the fuck?<eos> Y'all know that was my audition song.<eos> Yeah, it was one of them.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> Oh, God, I just love this fucking night!<eos> I love it!
That's impossible!<eos> Well, it was full of money just last week.<eos> And then I bought that airplane and built that tank.<eos> Sounds to me like someone's just a wee bit broke!<eos> Well, Krabs, I guess you've won.<eos> I've spent every penny I've ever made trying to put you out of business.<eos> Except this one.<eos> My last penny.<eos> Besides, what can I do with one measly cent anyway?<eos> You could give it to me.
Well, I was trying to tell you there's an angry mob outside.<eos> But now they're inside.<eos> I just work here.<eos> We'd like to have a word with you!<eos> You all look very hungry.<eos> Can I get anybody a Chum Burger?<eos> Enough with the niceties, Plankton!<eos> This is the last time I'm going to ask you.<eos> Where is me formuler?<eos> I told you, Krabs, I don't have it.
Uh...<eos> Correct!<eos> It is you!<eos> SpongeBob!<eos> - SpongeBob.<eos> - Patrick!<eos> SpongeBob!<eos> Why aren't you at The Krusty Krab making Krabby Patties?<eos> Well, I'd love to, but the formula's gone.<eos> Yeah, Mr. Krabs says you and Plankton took it.

I told you, I don't have the formula, you monsters!<eos> - Hey, baby, how are you?<eos> - Plankton!<eos> My hero!<eos> You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back.<eos> Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.<eos> It doesn't matter, Plankton.<eos> Krabs knows all your plans.<eos> He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.<eos> I never had it.

Yeah, okay.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> I'm looking right at monthly expenses, and the planned expenses...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Businessman 42!<eos> Can I get a picture?<eos> 42!<eos> So, today we have this down day.<eos> Or, as we call it, a push day.
It's just gonna drive you crazy.<eos> You just did that.<eos> What are you, preparing for surgery?<eos> Okay, seriously?<eos> How did this even happen?<eos> No, no, I can set it up.<eos> She's just in a meeting.<eos> Hi, something I can help you with?<eos> Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent jacket.<eos> Can you take it to the photo studio?
Apparently, I'm a classic noisy sleeper.<eos> Fun getting to know me, huh?<eos> - It is.<eos> I never fall asleep in the car, so that was actually amazing.<eos> Apologize for the racket.<eos> Barely noticed.<eos> I'll pretend I believe you.<eos> I love this house.<eos> It just looks happy to me.<eos> Like, if it was in a kids' book, it would make you feel good when you turned the page and saw it.
Is this your closet?<eos> Busy man about town.<eos> What's in all these drawers?<eos> Boxers, T-shirts, pocket squares, handkerchiefs.<eos> Okay, what's the deal with the handkerchief?<eos> That one I just don't get at all.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's essential.<eos> That your generation doesn't know that is criminal.<eos> The best reason to carry a handkerchief is to lend it.
Come on!<eos> My mother wanted you to know that the golf club is inaugurating a prize in Rose's name.<eos> A special trophy for the best score by a lady newcomer at the club.<eos> She was always very nice to the newcomers, my mother says.<eos> I hope you're pleased.<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course.<eos> So every year someone will win the Rose Lacey Trophy?<eos> Yeah, every year, as long as there's a golf club.<eos> And I think she'd like you to come along and present it to the first winner.
He created the Syndicate.<eos> Where does he come from?<eos> He's former British intelligence.<eos> Well, if British intelligence knows the Syndicate exists, why don't they just tell the CIA?<eos> Because they don't want anyone knowing the Syndicate was created by one of their own.<eos> I was sent undercover to earn Lane's trust and eventually identify the members of his organization.<eos> And for the first time in two years, I'm close to knowing who they are.<eos> Lane had a ledger.<eos> It contained the identities of his operatives, his terrorist associates, the entire inner workings of the Syndicate.<eos> One of his agents stole it, hoping to blackmail him, and kept it in a secure computer facility for safekeeping.

Your card isn't working.<eos> Benji, we're in.<eos> One more time. You'll have three minutes.<eos> Two and a half minutes to switch the security profile.<eos> Thirty seconds to escape through the service hatch.<eos> Remember, conserve oxygen.<eos> Don't move a muscle if you don't have to.<eos> I'm in the elevator.<eos> That current will carry you to the torus.<eos> Once you're there, I'll shut it down.
- Doesn't sound good.<eos> - Meaning it's triple-encrypted.<eos> You're not getting into that thing unless you have fingerprints, retinal scan, and a voice phrase spoken by a specific individual.<eos> The Prime Minister of Great Britain himself.<eos> Yes, him.<eos> So what you're saying is there is no ledger, which means we have no proof that the Syndicate even exists.<eos> So we're back to square one, only now we are all wanted by the CIA.<eos> I'm so proud of us.<eos> What I don't understand is why is there a red box sat in a private data vault in Morocco?<eos> And why would Lane want it if he can't open it?
This isn't strategy.<eos> This is rage.<eos> - It's going around.<eos> Come on, use your words, buddy.<eos> I have more than enough words to describe you, Stark.<eos> Thor.<eos> The Legionnaire.<eos> Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.<eos> And it has the sceptre.<eos> Now we have to retrieve it, again.
Like old times?<eos> This was never my life.<eos> You two can still walk away from this.<eos> Oh, we will.<eos> I know you've suffered.<eos> Captain America.<eos> God's righteous man.<eos> Pretending you could live without a war.<eos> I can't physically throw up in my mouth, but...<eos> If you believe in peace, then let us keep it.
When they see, they'll understand.<eos> I just need a little more time.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> Stay close.<eos> Dr. Cho!<eos> He's uploading himself into the body.<eos> Where?<eos> The real power is inside the Cradle.<eos> The gem, its power is uncontainable.<eos> You can't just blow it up.
Two minutes.<eos> Stay close.<eos> Dr. Cho!<eos> He's uploading himself into the body.<eos> Where?<eos> The real power is inside the Cradle.<eos> The gem, its power is uncontainable.<eos> You can't just blow it up.<eos> You have to get the Cradle to Stark.<eos> First, I have to find it.
Cap, can you keep him occupied?<eos> What do you think I've been doing?<eos> Okay, package is airborne.<eos> I have a clean shot.<eos> Negative.<eos> I am still in the truck.<eos> - What the hell are you...<eos> - Just be ready.<eos> I'm sending the package to you.<eos> How do you want me to take it?
War Machine coming at you!<eos> Right...<eos> Okay, what?<eos> We gotta move out.<eos> Even I can tell the air is getting thin.<eos> You guys get to the boats.<eos> I'll sweep for stragglers.<eos> Be right behind you.<eos> - What about the core?<eos> - I'll protect it.
Hope you don't mind me crashing the party.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> They've told me so much about you.<eos> We hit a coyote on the way up here.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> It just came out of nowhere.<eos> I mean, there was nothing we could do.<eos> It was in horrible shape.<eos> He had to kill it.

Just enough for me to do nothing.<eos> Which was exactly what I did.<eos> How much is left?<eos> Do you read the reports I send you?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> Have you at least listened to my messages?<eos> How much?<eos> There is $482 and 12 cents left in your fund.<eos> Now as I have mentioned before...<eos> Jesus had you been able to replenish it with any kind of regular income, we'd have been able to keep it afloat.
You're a cop, Will.<eos> You understand procedure.<eos> I do.<eos> I've been on that side of the table.<eos> I know what you wanna do.<eos> You want to keep me talking long enough... hoping I'll reveal something about where we might be.<eos> I could do the same... hoping you might tell us something about your beautiful wife.<eos> I'm not wearing a ring, Will.<eos> No.<eos> But you are wearing a tan line, meaning you removed it before you walked in here and that you had a holiday recently.
My wife and I wanted a son like you.<eos> Your wife is nothing but a pile of dirt now.<eos> What did you do with her?<eos> Huh?<eos> Dad!<eos> What did you do with her?<eos> Dad!<eos> Where is the bag?<eos> Where's the bag?<eos> Ow! I don't have it!
All right?<eos> You gonna come bring the books by the garage later?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.<eos> He's in the basement.<eos> I'm joking with you.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> Kids, we're gonna do something fun later, OK?<eos> We're doing something fun now.<eos> Oh, we found your luggage but it's in Cleveland.<eos> So now we just need to get it back to New York City.
Come on out of there.<eos> - Where'd you get this ship?<eos> - Niima Outpost.<eos> Jakku? That junkyard?<eos> Thank you!<eos> Junkyard.<eos> Told you we should have double-checked the Western Reaches.<eos> Who had it?<eos> Ducain?<eos> I stole it.
Thought maybe it was pneumonia but seems like it was just a bad cold.<eos> Good to hear.<eos> Give her my regards.<eos> I will.<eos> Good night.<eos> Dear Samantha, I hope things are going good for you back in Bright Hope.<eos> And that Doc Taylor is drinking less.<eos> I am in Wyoming now.<eos> The ride here was long and difficult and the foreman had to discipline a lot of men and let some go which made things harder for the rest of us, especially in this cold weather.<eos> I've been in charge of the night round-up for a while and I've organized it pretty good.
Wake me then.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Oh, Mr. Brooder...<eos> Mr. Brooder found a pond and we filled your canteens.<eos> And, we put some provisions in your squirrel bag.<eos> Lots of things with food energy like cheese and nuts and some beef cobs.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> - Mr. O'Dwyer.<eos> - Sheriff?<eos> We'll mark our route with the four rocks so you can see it.
I'll get you a ticket.<eos> Buddy, I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I told you, I just can't, okay?<eos> I will tell her, Buds.<eos> Bye.<eos> Tell her what?<eos> Buddy wants me to come home.<eos> He got us a present.<eos> He says he can't bring it to the wedding.
Nobody leaves Hench.<eos> Definitely not Buddy.<eos> Hench loves the kid.<eos> You shouldn't have never have come back.<eos> But it's not too late.<eos> Give me the phone and get away from this town.<eos> I won't say a word.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - Give me the phone.<eos> Give it to me!

But it's yours now.<eos> After your audition.<eos> You got his audition set up, Franco?<eos> Yup.<eos> Hey, where's Jakey?<eos> He went on his audition.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you think he's gonna pass that test?<eos> Do you?<eos> He's gonna fail it.
Vee, I got a surprise for you. Okay?<eos> We're gonna go take a little drive. Okay?<eos> I wanna take you somewhere.<eos> Come on.<eos> Grab my jacket.<eos> Come on.<eos> Welcome to your new home.<eos> My home?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, when I built it, I didn't know your name.
I can't leave Julius now.<eos> I got a job to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Garza.<eos> You know that.<eos> What's a job for, Buddy?<eos> What?<eos> It's for the family.<eos> Hand me your wallet.<eos> Just give it to me.
Unsinkable, or so they say.<eos> All ships are unsinkable, Jan.<eos> Until they sink.<eos> Places, everyone!<eos> They are again in the minority.<eos> Incredible! These cheese makers I want to take a thrashing.<eos> Where 'the admiral?<eos> Admiral Michiel de Ruyter, sir.<eos> And 'the new flagship.<eos> They called it 'The 7 Provinces.

- Okay.<eos> Mr. Burley.<eos> While I am aware that convention dictates that I should wait for your assessment of our proposal please take my interruption less as rudeness than proof of our profound excitement at the opportunity to meet yourself and your fine company.<eos> And let me say right here and now...<eos> Alright, that's enough, that's enough.<eos> We agreed that my colleague would do the speaking and rightly so for while her language may be... salty, it has great economy and pith.<eos> I don't care about any of that.<eos> No, listen and learn, son.<eos> Tea is an herb that's been dried out.<eos> So to bring it back to life, you have to infuse it in boiling water.
- Absolutely positive.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Maybe 18th.<eos> Please admire the beautifully carved...<eos> Now please admire these beautifully carved pillars that are engraved with typical Rajasthani which are engraved with typical Rajasthani carvings.<eos> ...typical carvings which...<eos> And you, you, you can see...<eos> Look, I could talk and talk but all that counts in the end is this one had an idea.<eos> I know, I know, but it works.<eos> The proof of our success is we are victims of it.
- Do you know what I mean?<eos> - Not sure.<eos> What I meant to say is that the internet is a magnificent thing.<eos> You can practically just download the chicks.<eos> You sure couldn't pull tricks like that in my heyday.<eos> You just log onto a chat room, finding millions of lost souls dying to chat and this often leads to something.<eos> There are multiple cases of people finding their soul mates online.<eos> Sealing their vows, even.<eos> But even if it doesn't lead you all the way to the altar, it's a nice way to get a taste of life.<eos> Have your cake and eat it too.
Okay, there's no water, either.<eos> When are you girls going to get used to living up here?<eos> When you finish fixing the house.<eos> Lights on.<eos> Come on, captain consumers.<eos> Time to hunt and gather some fossil fuels.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Oh, shit, shit, shit!<eos> I'm so sorry...<eos> I came out to get the head lamp and I must have left it open.
He's gone.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yeah, he's gone sweetie.<eos> I got you.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Take this aspirin.<eos> It's the last one.<eos> We should save it.
He's gone.<eos> Yeah, he's gone sweetie.<eos> I got you.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> Take this aspirin.<eos> It's the last one.<eos> We should save it.<eos> Take it.
Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I was afraid of that.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay, we'll figure it out.<eos> Right?<eos> Figure what out?<eos> Surely you're not against stopping an unwanted pregnancy.<eos> No, I don't think any baby should be unwanted.<eos> Well, there might be a safe way-<eos> I want it.
A feast.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> Is this some, like, wacko pregnancy thing?<eos> Like magical mystery imaginary smells?<eos> No.<eos> It's like smoke, but it's not ours.<eos> Can you smell it?
It's okay.<eos> Alright, I'm gonna get all the food out of the house.<eos> Eva, what are you doing?<eos> Where's the gas?<eos> What?<eos> The gas.<eos> It's under the microwave.<eos> Why?<eos> I won the bet, right?<eos> I can use it any way I want.
Master!<eos> What happened?<eos> They must have come here to kill her.<eos> Looks like she got the better of them.<eos> Master!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> A cave!<eos> We never knew this existed!<eos> Looks like it goes all the way to the top of the mountain!<eos> If the lady was holding the baby up, pointing to the top, Maybe she wanted us to take it back there!
"Our Mahishmati Kingdom shall remain unconquerable."<eos> "As long as the sun, moon and stars are shining there."<eos> "Felicity and glory reigns supreme here."<eos> "A flourished kingdom, happy subjects"<eos> "and the home of peace."<eos> "May the glory of Mahishmathi soar sky high."<eos> "Our flag with the emblem of the rising sun"<eos> "our golden throne flanked by to stallions."<eos> Your Majesty, it is just been two days since we caught that bull in the forests.<eos> We haven't broken it yet.

Ask my friends.<eos> - He's a dick.<eos> -Big 0l' dick.<eos> Look,lgetyou.ldo.<eos> I know what it's like to feel unappreciated, like just a member of the pack.<eos> I just want you to know that despite what I said before, I do appreciate you.<eos> And I'm appealing to your sense of humanity right now.<eos> There is a maniac trying to kill me.<eos> And I'm asking you to be the bigger car and help me out.<eos> I'm just a guy looking at a car and asking it to love me.
No, not people like us.<eos> What you did... When you chose to play God, can never be undone.<eos> You can't run from what you are.<eos> So I should...? Embrace it?<eos> Re-start the Program with you as it's head?<eos> Yes.<eos> You always were a small man, Antoine.<eos> A derivitive thinker, at best.<eos> This desperation suits you.<eos> The key to everything... is in your mind, and you're going to give it to me.
You telling me some hacker in prison is hitting our financial markets?<eos> No.<eos> But we want Hathaway on the team so he can help out the investigation.<eos> He hit four major banks, ran up $46 million in damages.<eos> And that's just what we know about.<eos> You want the DOJ to do anything other than laugh?<eos> Daniels said two authors wrote the virus.<eos> I don't know who wrote the second half, but the first half, the RAT, the remote access tool that Daniels called "lean and graceful"?<eos> One of the original authors is me.<eos> I co—wrote it, as a gag, years ago at MIT.
They were gonna send a journalist up the hill and asked me if I was interested.<eos> It was his call in the end.<eos> All right, Caroline MacKenzie, team doctor. Why don't you kick it off, Caro.<eos> - Hi, everyone.<eos> - Hey, Caro.<eos> Hi there.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> So Rob and Harold and Mike will tell you all sorts of stuff about mountaineering, but from a medical standpoint getting you to the top of Everest is really about oxygen.<eos> And the lack of it.
- My Goodness ...<eos> Was there a monster?<eos> Do you have fought it?<eos> - Yes ...<eos> Bring it to me!<eos> I am not a good fighter ...<eos> Everyone has a monster in itself.<eos> That you have to let out!<eos> And if it is eating me?<eos> It's Your Monster! Ready to control it.
Run!<eos> - Come on!<eos> You can not hurt me!<eos> Why are you running away from me?<eos> How So?<eos> Because of you I have remained.<eos> Lily ...<eos> To kill a monster, must be a monster you!<eos> Please, Rusty ... You are not a monster!<eos> You can control it.
If it wasn't for this doll, you'd have a pretty hard time convincing me that you didn't just... imagine all of this.<eos> Why would I... why would I imagine it?<eos> - How old would Evie be now?<eos> - Come on, Dunc.<eos> Elizabeth Valentine.<eos> That was her name, wasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> That was on her train pass.<eos> - Where is her train pass?<eos> - I gave it back to her.
Barb.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's late.<eos> If you're looking for Peter, he's not here.<eos> It's probably a good thing.<eos> Can we talk?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - What's on your mind?<eos> I pulled out your old report on the train crash.<eos> Do you remember it at all?
You wanted the 100 bucks.<eos> Which I want a receipt for, by the way.<eos> All right, I asked around... junkie transvestite who turned out to be completely useless, and a closeted D.E.A. agent who was the exact opposite of useless in, oh, so many ways.<eos> Okay, Valentine, I ordered a bowl of soup.<eos> I don't want to hear how it was made.<eos> Heroin used to be funneled onto the campus through the cambodian cooking staff, but they were taken out by city cops last year, which opened the door for a downtown meth dealer named Visser to take over the franchise.<eos> Visser, huh?<eos> What's his system?<eos> Well, heroin's dead-dropped on campus pre-cut.<eos> Visser's guy picks it up and distributes to the college kids.
Feeling nauseous?<eos> Ears ringing?<eos> No?<eos> Where's my shoe?<eos> It flew off when you crashed.<eos> When you start experiencing any of those things, let me know. Okay?<eos> I don't know whether to thank you for rescuing me... or to kick your ass for throwing me off a cliff.<eos> Thank us or kick our ass, huh?<eos> How about you tell us where that device is?<eos> I mailed it to a friend.
So you find me amusing, do you?<eos> Goodness, it's Mr. Oak.<eos> ...and after that she was gonna be a governess.<eos> But she was far too wild.<eos> Always has been.<eos> Miss Bathsheba Everdene.<eos> I've brought you a lamb.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Oak.<eos> He's such a dear thing.<eos> He's come too soon and won't last the winter, so I thought you'd like to rear it instead.
You're writing me a ticket?<eos> Oh, I am protected by a meter maid.<eos> No, I am recording all pertinent details... in my incident report log before they slip my mind.<eos> Jue madre, this is your first day?<eos> Take me home!<eos> Do not touch my I.R.L.<eos> Now, protocol states I have to contact my precinct.<eos> Do you have a telephone on you?<eos> Yes!<eos> I packed it... with my computer... with my floppy disk... while running for my life.
This is a suicide mission.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - I do care.<eos> You're kind of mean, and I only understand about 30 percent of what you're saying... but somewhere, around there, there is a heart.<eos> Don't try and kill Cortez.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> It's here in my tighty whities.<eos> It's stuck.<eos> You want me to wear a wire?<eos> Yes, but I'm not exactly sure where we're gonna put it.
You don't have proper security.<eos> Thank you. I can manage.<eos> I'll be frank.<eos> You have two options.<eos> Concert or complex.<eos> In our world disasters don't go hand in hand. We suggest buying both.<eos> - Do you know who I fucking just played for'?<eos> - We do.<eos> And that's why we give you a choice.<eos> - You have talent, Mr. Tom. - It would be a shame to lose it.
Yuck!<eos> Look!<eos> Wow!<eos> i lt's amazing!<eos> Saulius, sit down<eos> You're so close to the worm<eos> Lay down<eos> You're lying with the worm<eos> Take the worm<eos> Take it

This is my granddaughter.<eos> Beautiful concert, thank you.<eos> Livia?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Would you come here, please?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.
You never like anything, even at work and you ruin things.<eos> It's the way I work.<eos> No, it's the way you live and make people who love you live that way too.<eos> - I was wrong to come.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have answered your call.<eos> - Yeah, maybe.<eos> - It would have been better.<eos> That's enough, the negotiation ends here.<eos> This is the contract, take it or leave it.
You must've taken in an orphan and raised her as Hong-yi.<eos> Blinded by greed, that's what you want to see.<eos> It is regrettable that you've lost your sight.<eos> I wanted to show you... what I have gained and will own.<eos> You must see.<eos> How I became Yu-baek... and will soon marry the princess.<eos> Then you'll finally feel... regret that will last forever.<eos> Does anything cause you pain?<eos> If so, dispose of it.<eos> If your tooth hurts, pull it out.

Why would you want to pick a fighter's life when you don't have to?<eos> If Apollo was around, he would tell you that, too.<eos> Well, he ain't around.<eos> I been fighting my whole life.<eos> I ain't got a choice.<eos> It's always about a choice.<eos> I was in the ring.<eos> I saw how it went down.<eos> That fight should've been stopped.<eos> I should have stopped it.
I can't see!<eos> What do you mean, you can't see me?<eos> I'm good.<eos> You've got SUVs approaching.<eos> Go to the dock!<eos> Dock.<eos> Excellent idea.<eos> Boyanov's boat is at the end. Uh... No keys, Coop.<eos> The panel's on the lower left under the steering wheel.<eos> You can hotwire it.
Too late.<eos> My God, does that ever work?<eos> I will take that as...<eos> That's a "no."<eos> A "no." Take that as a "no."<eos> You were just hitting on me.<eos> I like to play the odds. Yeah.<eos> Well, good luck.<eos> Here is my phone number.<eos> Memorize it, then burn it.
So if you wanna live, and you wanna unload that bomb... you stick with me.<eos> And if you got a problem with that... you know what you can do, Rayna?<eos> You and your bullshit accent can land this fucking plane by yourselves.<eos> Okay, bodyguard.<eos> But if I find out you're lying to me about any of this... I'll show you ways to die you never even dreamed of.<eos> Now, let's go to Budapest.<eos> I need a fucking drink.<eos> Yeah, I bet you fucking do. Oh, my God.<eos> ♪ People want my power And they want my station<eos> ♪ Stormed my winter palace But they couldn't take it
I'll make your dream come true and send you and your boyfriend to heaven.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Mr. Dudaev.<eos> Welcome to Hungary.<eos> Like Chechnya, only easier to pronounce.<eos> Enough with the bullshit.<eos> Where is the package?<eos> Once my client sees the payment... she'll take us all to its very secure hiding spot.<eos> Wherever that may be.<eos> I got it, handsome.
Although I fear I may have become overexcited at certain points.<eos> Little bit.<eos> By way of apology... should your work ever bring you to London...<eos> I would love to take you for dinner.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I think that would be nice.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> God!<eos> How you like my English accent, huh?<eos> I learn it from the Downton Abbey. No, I'm only joking.
You have girlfriends.<eos> Boyfriends?<eos> Wives?<eos> No, Billie, we're single just like you.<eos> No, no that's just baloney.<eos> It is not baloney.<eos> Here, check my phone.<eos> Go ahead. Scroll through the texts, emails--<eos> No, no, no.<eos> You go ahead and check it.
- You and me?<eos> Well, Frank, I have singlehandedly pushed the limits of high-altitude eroticism.<eos> - You banged her?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to the classy broad?<eos> Oh, happily married.<eos> Yeah. Turns out she takes her ring off when she flies because her fingers swell. Yeah.<eos> But it-it's all good, Frank.<eos> You know, hey, turns out Boggs, he didn't hit it out of the park every single time at bat.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - He just tried to get the ball in play and hope that he could squeak it through the hole.
I don't know how I'm gonna follow these.<eos> They were so good.<eos> You guys are really brave.<eos> Thanks for trusting.<eos> One time, I had sex with this guy, and we couldn't find the condom.<eos> So, three days later, I found out it was attached to my cervix.<eos> It had been kind of pounded up there.<eos> And so I googled what do I do, right?<eos> So it said just kind of bear down.<eos> Just fish it out.
Not that great of a guy.<eos> He was kind of racist, and homophobic.<eos> He was a drunk.<eos> He was a drunk.<eos> He once apologized to me for missing a volleyball game that he was at.<eos> He had made signs with my name on them.<eos> When lwas11, this kid, Brandon Lipinsky...<eos> Remember Brandon?<eos> He stole my bike.<eos> And he maybe was just borrowing it, but our dad went over there and beat the shit out of Brandon's dad, and his grandpa, and Brandon.
All his mates who worked the motor pool came home without a scratch.<eos> I shouldn't have said what I said.<eos> Lesson there, then.<eos> Don't say everything you think.<eos> Look.<eos> - How did you find that?<eos> - In your desk.<eos> - Couldn't have.<eos> - The one in the corner.<eos> Didn't know it was a desk until I opened it.

Yeah, we could, but...<eos> Then what? ... We'd ran out of food.<eos> And we don't know the code to the door.<eos> Hey!<eos> The Grandma and Grandpa could come.<eos> Jack, they don't know where we are.<eos> Room's not on any map.<eos> Jack, listen to me.<eos> Now we got a chance.<eos> We've nearly missed it but we got our chance.
- Honey, please!<eos> - What book?<eos> Grace, what book?<eos> - Hurry!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Elise, hurry!<eos> Quinn's diary.<eos> This is it. "Quinn, I wanted you to find this on the day you graduated."<eos> This is the letter that Lily hid from Quinn.<eos> She wanted her to find it on her graduation day.
How's your boy?<eos> Fine.<eos> Still in the navy?<eos> Yes, he's First Lieutenant.<eos> You raised a real hero.<eos> Which is why I would like to tell him that we are doing as much for this country as he is.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Trumbo, the others, all have contracts.<eos> Oh, L.B., you helped build this business as did I.<eos> We're not gonna watch these pissants defile it.
Guy who just got nominated for an Academy Award.<eos> Everyone at that table's been nominated.<eos> There's Alvah Bessie, and Adrian Scott.<eos> Arlen Hird.<eos> And Ring Lardner, Jr.<eos> and Albert Maltz and...<eos> It'll be like this.<eos> I'll find the writer and work with him.<eos> He'll deliver the script to me.<eos> If it's good, I'll give it to you.
I killed a woman yesterday.<eos> Part and parcel.<eos> You care not to share your company with a murderer?<eos> I'd be a lonely man if I did.<eos> I am no judge... nor father.<eos> In a short time... this will be a long time ago.<eos> Camp here.<eos> - Blanket?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I shall dream up some advice, and in the morning, dish it up with fresh eggs.
So I'm thinking the only way to stop this kid from croaking' more innocents is to draw up a poster. Let him find it.<eos> The next morning, I pinned the poster outside the watering' hole he was drowning in.<eos> Wasn't long before he sees the poster,<eos> "Bill Allson, $500 dead or alive."<eos> - He yells me over.<eos> - Skelly!<eos> And what he says chills me to the bone.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> - "Be a thousand by the 'morrow."<eos> The next morning, I go to get the poster, and pin it up in the next town.
I have been in contact with your husband.<eos> I am to watch over you.<eos> When the time of our disenchantment comes, I will show you the path.<eos> Until then, please try to hold some memory of who you once were.<eos> ~ And of your husband.<eos> ~ Husband?<eos> My ladies, this is the very picture of beauty.<eos> To see my two rarest and finest flowers entwined so happily.<eos> You know, it is said, that in the lands on the far side of Hell, they dance a dance of three partners.<eos> I was taught it once, 4,000 years ago, but sadly, I have forgotten the steps.
Where is Childermass?<eos> He is gone.<eos> He received a...<eos> A box from you and he left.<eos> I like your labyrinth.<eos> You use Hickman?<eos> De Chepe.<eos> A minor scholar, but very good at labyrinths.<eos> It was meant to be impenetrable.<eos> How did you break it?
Kill him.<eos> Kill him!<eos> My library.<eos> My books.<eos> That is not the Raven King.<eos> Mr Strange.<eos> Mr Norrell.<eos> That is Sir Walter Pole's butler.<eos> Come, Mr Norrell.<eos> I have but one shot, and I mean to use it.
I see you, silly.<eos> There...<eos> Okay, I'll keep this.<eos> - At the closing of the day, oh Lord.<eos> - Watch over us as we sleep.<eos> Keep us safe and warm in Your heart.<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's me... your king.<eos> Did you like my present?<eos> Have you tried it on?
Oh, I love this song.<eos> Come here and dance with me, Mr. Burke.<eos> Come on.<eos> We have to talk really quiet.<eos> There's mikes under the barstools.<eos> You said he tried to escape.<eos> I was supposed to escape with him.<eos> How were you gonna do that?<eos> He had a plan. He had this notebook.<eos> I found it.

- Aah! - Sorry.<eos> I don't have any actual medical training.<eos> No kidding.<eos> Let me get it.<eos> Can't they track us in here?<eos> I've hidden in here before with the chip.<eos> I think the thick stone walls disrupt the signal.<eos> Ow.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it, I got it.

You trust me, don't you?<eos> The last time I trusted one of you guys, I got ditched.<eos> All right, well, I'm not gonna ditch you, okay?<eos> Look, I've known Kate for a long time, and right now, I don't trust her any more than you do.<eos> But if we skip out on this dinner, they're gonna know something's up.<eos> I worked it into the plan.<eos> I found a route that will conceal us till we get to the outskirts of town.<eos> And tonight, at some point during the course of dinner, I'm gonna excuse myself to the bathroom and check for mikes.<eos> When I come back, I want you to wait three minutes. I want you to get up, I want you to go to the same bathroom,<eos> I want you to take out your chip, and I want you to leave it there, somewhere where they're not gonna find it.
Reckoning.<eos> You call it whatever you want.<eos> It's murder.<eos> You sat there with those people and you watched them cut her throat.<eos> We didn't turn you in, but Pope said we did, as a warning, because we're supposed to police our neighbors.<eos> But I... didn't stop it.<eos> So I have blood on my hands.<eos> Just let me tell you.<eos> There are no second chances here, and you got one, so take it.<eos> Hold on to your tracking chip or they'll know you took it out.
- Henry.<eos> - How many noses does a monkey have? - Dr. West.<eos> How many noses does a monkey have?<eos> How many noses does a monkey have? How many noses does a monkey have?<eos> You can't control something like that.<eos> I don't care who you are, how many weapons you have.<eos> All those things that went on... you don't get to play games with the Devil.<eos> And if you do, you damn sure don't get to make the rules.<eos> That type of evil... just thinking about it, talking about it.<eos> Even you people making this movie... and the people watching it... you're inviting bad things into your life.
Appreciate her, too.<eos> A good nemesis only makes you better.<eos> Break a leg.<eos> Well, that can't be good.<eos> Okay, you ready for this?<eos> All right, cool.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Oh! Okay.<eos> This is, this is a, uh, a creamy pasta dish.<eos> And we said that if we ever had a celebrity child, this is what we would name it.
"I lost so much time because of you, Michael. "<eos> "I lost the best years of my life."<eos> Good morning.<eos> I have never told you how sorry I am about How things ended between you and Julian.<eos> I mean, I want to apologize for his behaviour.<eos> You don't have to apologize, it's not your fault.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> As a father, I could've done more.<eos> Let's face it, Julian picked up the scent.<eos> I've started to smell it too.
Like is he a liberal?<eos> Like is he a Misesian like he says he is?<eos> He believes in libertarian market principles, and you know man against the state and all these these principles of freedom and axioms of... or is he someone else?<eos> Like who I hope he is or someone like I would try to hope to be, who's just looking for a way, a mechanism, to help peek beyond good and evil a little bit.<eos> And... is he more enthusiastic about what he's... what he's allowed to be opened up, the doors he's opening. Of course, there will be a dark side to the dark web.<eos> And if we want to enable this...<eos> this true crypto-anarchic future, anyone who's working on that, I think, has to reckon with the fact that... they're going to be enabling really nasty things along with this kind of information freedom revolution that they're taking part in. By August 2012, business was booming.<eos> The Silk Road had become a thriving, anonymous and unregulated black market.<eos> The Internet being used in this way, posed a major threat to the government, greater perhaps than selling drugs.<eos> Even as a law enforcement officer, I still wouldn't know where to go and buy crack on the streets or buy heroin, but I do know how to go online and find it.
I hate to be ungentlemanly, but we're going to need your clothes.<eos> As the manhunt for Adem Qasim intensifies, all passengers travelling on the UK's national rail network will have to show valid ID and face on-board bag checks.<eos> The Home Secretary has authorised police checkpoints...<eos> I have your wife.<eos> - So let me speak to her, then.<eos> - The Russians have sedated her and... - Bullshit.<eos> - Do not interrupt.<eos> The deal's changed.<eos> I'm bringing her to London.<eos> You name the time and the place, and if you attack before the exchange, I'll cut your baby out of her and drown it in a toilet.
Well, now we don't want to rush to judgment here.<eos> No one was supposed to know that weapons facility ever existed.<eos> Records were classified.<eos> It was ten floors down for chrissake.<eos> Right.<eos> And cleaned up 70 years ago, supposedly.<eos> I think you'll just wanna stick with accident, Jonas.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Oops, sorry.<eos> Didn't realize you were living on top of a chemical weapons dump until someone, and we still don't know who, blew it up.
Maybe they have evidence.<eos> That's Brady material.<eos> They'd have to turn that over.<eos> Only if she were charged.<eos> She hangs herself in her cell, this all goes away.<eos> Let's get her some clothes and get the hell out of here.<eos> Couldn't find any milk.<eos> I hope it's okay.<eos> We have tea now?<eos> I stole it from the financial office next door.
I've seen their signs all over Hell's Kitchen.<eos> The last two years have transformed the business.<eos> There's new owners, new grants, new contracts.<eos> Yeah, the world watched half of New York get destroyed.<eos> That's a lot of sympathy.<eos> And Union Allied benefited from every dollar of it.<eos> I was the secretary for the chief accountant.<eos> And one of my jobs... was to coordinate the pension claims for the company.<eos> About a week ago, I was emailed a file called, "Pension Master."<eos> It must have been meant for my boss, but I made the mistake of opening it.
When the third moon rises, he must fly.<eos> If he lives, he's the one.<eos> One second.<eos> And if he dies?<eos> He's an imposter.<eos> His death will be justified.<eos> Three days!<eos> I've got the necklace.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> You could've stolen it.
LET HIM SEE THE MAN UNDERNEATH.<eos> NICE. JUST A FEW MORE.<eos> GOOD.<eos> SO, SAM, YOUR MOTHER -- UM, YOU'VE CITED HER AS BEING A SOURCE OF INSPIRATION -- WAS ARRESTED ON A NUMBER OF OCCASIONS<eos> WHAT DOES SHE THINK ABOUT YOU BECOMING A FEDERAL PROSECUTOR?<eos> WELL, SHE PASSED AWAY BEFORE I GOT THE JOB, BUT... I HOPE SHE'D BE PROUD OF ME.<eos> WOULD SHE HAVE SUPPORTED YOUR PROSECUTION OF, UH, MEDICAL MARIJUANA FACILITIES, FOR EXAMPLE?<eos> WELL, NIGEL, MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME FROM AN EARLY AGE TO FIGHT FOR JUSTICE, PROTECT THOSE WHO ARE VULNERABLE.<eos> THE LAW'S THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT.<eos> THE U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE PROSECUTES THOSE WHO BREAK IT.
So you'll take the lead.<eos> I mean, music's your thing and it's...<eos> - It'll be fine.<eos> - Totally. I mean, this doesn't have to be...<eos> Doesn't have to be awkward.<eos> We can handle it.<eos> Guess who's staying in Boston.<eos> Surprise, bitches.<eos> I thought your flight was this morning.<eos> Yeah, I missed it.
So how did you get Stalin to let me out of the Gulag?<eos> It was easier than you think.<eos> Let's just say don't underestimate the power of "Nurse Jackie" on DVD.<eos> And I promised I'd stick to your schedule.<eos> What is on the schedule for tonight?<eos> Bath at 9:00.<eos> Oh, and look at the time.<eos> And look at this giant bathtub in front of us.<eos> That pool is really cold.<eos> Not when you heat it up to 95Â°.
And... congrats on your donor, by the way.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, things are really starting to look up for me, which is good, 'cause track trials are starting up in the spring,<eos> - and I'm ready to kick a little ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, after transplants, it can take months to fully recover<eos> - and get used to your new immune system...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> If not years.<eos> Hey, if there's someone out there willing to help me get a second chance, then I'm not gonna waste it.
What's behind that iron door there?<eos> You can't take this off the boat?<eos> You're not supposed to.<eos> Them's their rules and all they are is rules for smugglers and the like which doesn't apply to us.<eos> So we'll obey 'em by not telling them.<eos> That grate's locked.<eos> You know where the key is?<eos> In the hall closet.<eos> There's a good lad.<eos> - Go grab it.
See you in the school yard, Jeem ee.<eos> That boy there's a bully Mark his shifty eyes, Jim.<eos> What?<eos> He's bullying you?<eos> All the time.<eos> With Grendel.<eos> Grendel?<eos> Grim and greedy Grendel?<eos> They named their dog after Grendel?<eos> That's its name Todd trained it to come after me.
God save us all!<eos> Hurrah!<eos> Augh!<eos> You said rum was good.<eos> Yuck!<eos> Raise our colours!<eos> Fly the black flag!<eos> Calico Jack designed this flag.<eos> The skull and crossed swords.<eos> Everyone uses it now.
"Next year's book awards have been decided..."<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> "The plaques and citations can now be put into escrow."<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> "With Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, a plutonium-dense, satirical quiz-kid opus "that runs to almost 1,000..." What? ,000 pages,<eos> "not including footnotes, the competition has been obliterated. "It's as though Paul Bunyan had joined the NFL, "or Wittgenstein had gone onto Jeopardy!<eos> "The novel is that colossally disruptive, and that spectacularly good."<eos> That's the fucking opening paragraph.<eos> What if it actually is that good?<eos> You might just have to read it.
There better.<eos> David, hi.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's David Lipsky.<eos> Where are you?<eos> You know, I think I may have made a wrong turn somewhere.<eos> Uh, let's see, I'm on County Highway 29, just across from the Circus Video.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> Uh, your publicist sent it in her e-mail, just in case.<eos> Hey, you'd do me a favor by losing it.
How are you?<eos> Ah, 'cause I'm terrified.<eos> - Are you?<eos> -Yes, you're not alone in this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> -We'll do this together.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> The thing about the tours, like, yes, I would like to get laid off of it a couple times.
- It goes right there.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> That's, um...<eos> Mmm. Actually, can I use your bathroom for a second?<eos> - I believe it's unoccupied.<eos> -Right.<eos> So, uh, do you not have a television?<eos> I do not have a TV, no.<eos> How come?<eos> Because if I had a TV, I would watch it all the time.
That's, um...<eos> Mmm. Actually, can I use your bathroom for a second?<eos> - I believe it's unoccupied.<eos> -Right.<eos> So, uh, do you not have a television?<eos> I do not have a TV, no.<eos> How come?<eos> Because if I had a TV, I would watch it all the time.<eos> Ah.<eos> I don't even know if I'd watch it all the time, but it would be on all the time.
I hope you don't expect me to clean up this mess.<eos> Darwin?<eos> You're, you're cured!<eos> Hey, that tickles!<eos> Ha!<eos> Is this even possible?<eos> With this, it is.<eos> I just swallowed some, and now I'm fine!<eos> Hold on, you just drank this liquid and now you're cured?<eos> This globe, my mother gave it to me the last time I saw her.
Uh, uh, just give me one second.<eos> One second.<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah. No, false alarm.<eos> It was a malfunction in the, uh, IM 714 chip in the breadboard circuit.<eos> Yeah. Okay.<eos> Mal: Carlos!<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Way to go, Jay.<eos> Now we have to go to school tomorrow.<eos> If someone hands you a crying baby, do you, a, curse it?
John Ruth.<eos> - Are you a lawman?<eos> - I'm takin' her to the law.<eos> - You're a bounty hunter?<eos> - That's right, Buster.<eos> - Do you have a warrant?<eos> - 'Course I do.<eos> May I see it?<eos> Why?<eos> You're suppose to produce it upon request.
get the two of you back together.<eos> I see. I see.<eos> So you are tired of your little affair?<eos> You're all done with it.<eos> Now you want to make sure you don't feel guilty so you're going to manipulate us all into some absurd happy ending.<eos> I have met a lot of control freaks in my life, in fact, I thought I was one, but you, you make me look like an amateur.<eos> I didn't mean to insult you.<eos> Have the decency to leave him and face the fact that you poisoned my life and my children's life, and probably John's life with your own selfishness.<eos> That's your burden.<eos> You earned it.
Knuckles.<eos> As a memento, I put on a strip of cloth from the dead Kung Fu master.<eos> I decided I would use my new super Kung Fu powers to fight crime.<eos> So, I became the best cop in the world.<eos> I became, Kung Fury.<eos> I don't wanna hear it Kung Fury.<eos> I just got back from city hall, $50 million worth of damages, and I got the mayor up my ass like a fag on Viagra.<eos> How am I going to explain this to the press, hm?<eos> You just destroyed an entire city block for Christ's sake.<eos> Didn't you tell me to block it out?
Is that not enough, Claire?<eos> Do you not want me anymore?<eos> Do ye wish to live separately?<eos> I feel that's what I should want.<eos> But I don't.<eos> The key to Lallybroch.<eos> What?<eos> Yer ring.<eos> I had the blacksmith fashion yer ring from my key.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that before, when you gave it to me?
What...? So, what's good? What do you got?<eos> Crombie.<eos> Okay, what's a crombie?<eos> Crombie is a crombie.<eos> That's all we got.<eos> Okay, two crombies then.<eos> Whatever those are. Heh.<eos> Whoa. Look at that thing.<eos> This world is so much better than ours.<eos> I want it.
Can you do that?<eos> Yeah. Why not?<eos> Well, I don't know.<eos> It just seems like it's kind of cheating.<eos> Tell it to my yacht.<eos> Harry. Harold.<eos> Sir.<eos> That's 699.<eos> Got that.<eos> This is an opportunity, Beatrix, and I am seizing it.
But it didn't just appear out of thin air.<eos> Somebody, somewhere made that thing.<eos> Nobody knows why, but whatever crazy world that is, whatever the hell that place is, that's what people call the Core World.<eos> If they had the technology to punch a hole through every parallel universe, think what kind of a crazy goddamn Earth that must be.<eos> I mean, they must be a thousand years ahead of us, technology-wise.<eos> And no one's ever been there before.<eos> But every once in a while, somebody stumbles across a piece of technology.<eos> It's like a scrap from the grown ups' table.<eos> Something that's so crazy, cool and sophisticated that it has to be from the Core World.<eos> How did your dad get it?
I saw her die.<eos> Not all of her.<eos> What?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> She's the only one that who knows how to get to the Core World.<eos> Find her.<eos> Bring that device to her.<eos> Why?<eos> Son, the building's been running for a long time now.<eos> Whatever its original purpose was, whoever built it, they're long gone.
Holy water, garlic?<eos> Ooh, I make a really good 40-clove chicken.<eos> But we probably don't have time for that right now, guys.<eos> Sunlight.<eos> That burns them up.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Does it?<eos> Because, I mean, it's daytime right now and they don't seem to be too bothered by it.<eos> Correct, but that's because this facility has a limited number of windows to minimize visual distractions and maximize climate control and security.<eos> You're telling me sunlight does kill vampires, but we get so little of it in this fluorescent shithole, that they're just fine?
I might as well go down in flames.<eos> Good shot. Good chops.<eos> It's something I should have done a long time ago.<eos> He's right.<eos> He should have.<eos> I'm embarrassed to ask but can I have some of that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course. Of course.<eos> I love coffee.<eos> I'd drink it in my sleep if I could.
No, no, no!<eos> No, don't cut the wire!<eos> Don't cut my wire!<eos> No!<eos> Nobody gives a damn about your wire!<eos> -There's too much tension!<eos> It will snap! It will hurt somebody!<eos> You have to believe me!<eos> Hold on. Hold on, guys.<eos> -You have to loosen it with the grip hoist.
You got Peter's job.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I certainly hope you do better than poor Peter.<eos> Of course, I knew he'd never make it.<eos> Far too much of a freethinker.<eos> You know what?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Let's take a look at this house.<eos> I really think you're gonna love it.
This necklace belonged to Rachel.<eos> Yeah, she gave it to me for my birthday.<eos> My dad and I got in a fight because he thought it was from Kyle.<eos> I got mad and I threw the necklace at him.<eos> You saw it happen?<eos> What, were you spying on us from your window?<eos> I saw you that night in the driveway, with the garbage bag and the shovel.<eos> Yeah. So?<eos> So?<eos> I had a bag of gravel in the basement, I brought it up and put it in my truck with a shovel to gain some traction.
- You suffered a compound fracture--<eos> - I know what I fucking suffered!<eos> I need you to hear me this time.<eos> There was damage to your left frontal cortex.<eos> Your motor skills will be a struggle.<eos> Your emotions will be unpredictable.<eos> There's a long road ahead, and we can't rush it.<eos> - Let's do the test later.<eos> - No.<eos> We'll finish it now.
- Uh, congratulations.<eos> - You are an inspiration to men everywhere.<eos> - Thanks, buddy.<eos> - I really appreciate that.<eos> - When I met Michelle,<eos> I was rocking a Jamiroquai hat.<eos> - Oh. - Honestly, it was a crutch.<eos> Uh, you proved the old-fashioned way still works.<eos> This Tinder stuff,<eos> I just don't get it.
My eyes aren't working.<eos> What asshole invented this stupid thing?<eos> - Hey, man.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Hey, dude.<eos> How's it going?<eos> - I'm Isaac.<eos> - Hi, Isaac.<eos> I hate to bug you.<eos> I lost my phone, and I'm using this app to try to find it.
- Yes, boss.<eos> Freeman, move your arse.<eos> - How long have I slept?<eos> - Five hours.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Tea.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How can you still have tea?<eos> - I saved it.
Freeman, move your arse.<eos> - How long have I slept?<eos> - Five hours.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Tea.<eos> - Tea?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - How can you still have tea?<eos> - I saved it.<eos> - Share it with me.
So, one soldier climbed, while the other four held off the natives.<eos> Then a second soldier climbed, while the other three held them off.<eos> Then a third soldier climbed, while the other two held them off.<eos> That left only two soldiers on the ground and for one of them it was certain death.<eos> Because the last soldier to climb would have nobody holding off the natives.<eos> Mr and Mrs Mulrooney, your son Michael demanded to be that last soldier.<eos> He gave his life so that another man might live.<eos> I know Michael wanted to test himself in battle, we spoke about it often.<eos> How sad, then, that his first battle - his first test - should be his last.<eos> But how glorious that he should pass it with flying colours.
You are suggesting we stop feeding the sick?<eos> The dying.<eos> We stop wasting food on the dying.<eos> ~ Reverend?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> What do you say to that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Can we, as Christians, stop feeding the dying?<eos> I will treat that question with the contempt it deserves.<eos> If you wish to debate it, do so in my absence.
Spragg.<eos> Yes, definitely Spragg.<eos> I will be your informer.<eos> I will grass on everyone and everything, if you just say, "I need not hang Tommy Barrett."<eos> Informers are easy to find. Hangmen are more difficult.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> Please...<eos> You promised me rum.<eos> Yes?<eos> May I have it now, please?
- Sorry.<eos> - Trouble with mini-me?<eos> Uh, just trying to figure out how to fix Adam's vineyard for this weekend.<eos> Fix it?<eos> I thought the Cromwells only own five-star properties.<eos> Well, not this one.<eos> It's trashed.<eos> No upkeep for years.<eos> I swear, her majesty's dumb-ass has no marketing savvy.<eos> After the show's done, all he has to do is sell it as Adam Cromwell's Retreat for Everlasting Romance.
Chet and I are together now, so you need to suck it up and do your job.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Which is what, exactly?<eos> I just want to clarify.<eos> You want me to go into Adam's room and convince him to do something that he doesn't want to do, right?<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> Since when is that news?<eos> Okay, how would you like me to do it?<eos> Because you've taken away his winery.<eos> You've turned it into the "Everlasting" theme park.
Where's my dog?<eos> Boris!<eos> Boris!<eos> Everything was pretty much cleared out when I got here.<eos> - (Laughing) - You got here just in time.<eos> We had him down to be euthanized first thing in the morning.<eos> But, he must have only been here for a few hours.<eos> Not what the records say. 96 hours, and we put 'em down.<eos> Didn't you check the microchip on him?<eos> We scanned it, and the only thing that came up was this.
Geo location services were turned off, GoPro camera around her wrist.<eos> Where did that camera come from?<eos> All the footage from last night came from smartphones.<eos> I think I know where it's from.<eos> It's the driver's.<eos> Yeah, well, unfortunately, he didn't fork out the 50 bucks for the waterproof case.<eos> It's full of sea water.<eos> The data is still intact when it gets wet.<eos> You have to put the chip in distilled water to get rid of the salt and minerals.<eos> Then, dry it out using rice.
If you're right, Amy would get the driver high while Max scared the rest of her friends on the ship.<eos> He uses a P.A. System to broadcast the wailing they talked about.<eos> And after Max locks them in, they're all so drunk or high that they wanna be scared.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Hello?<eos> Max wore some kind of mask that Amy made.<eos> Even the bus driver believes he saw The Stowaway and corroborates the story.<eos> Serves him right.<eos> Jerk gave me the creeps.<eos> Max moves the bus, trashes it.
Guys, I found the footage for Beth and Nick that night.<eos> All I'm getting is this.<eos> You don't get to play here. (Giggling)<eos> You don't get to play. (Laughing)<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> We need to talk to Beth.<eos> HE CHEATED ON ME, TOO.<eos> WHO IS THIS?<eos> How did you get my user name?<eos> I found it on his computer.
Do you know the date she died, Jane Doe number?<eos> December 22, 2012.<eos> Labeled 30-34.<eos> I was losing anyway.<eos> So... buried...<eos> First quarter of 2013...<eos> They'd have been on the southeast side of the island.<eos> Next to the old asylum.<eos> Asylum?<eos> Yeah, they turned it into a drug rehab center for women.
Hey, over there.<eos> Someone's already been here.<eos> What's going on, Jake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we've come this far.<eos> We should dig.<eos> Can't do it alone.<eos> I can't find Tessa's phone anywhere.<eos> It's not on her body.<eos> He took it.
Magnifly.<eos> Pleasure to meet you, Magnifly.<eos> Catherine?<eos> I think I found our way in.<eos> Lindy, what did you find?<eos> - The file is my case file.<eos> - What?<eos> The Cyber Crimes Unit's case against me.<eos> It's redacted.<eos> I can't read it.
We should talk about how to make your place here more...<eos> Official.<eos> Okay, people, not sure what that is, but we gotta move it out.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Move, move, move.<eos> Lindy, where are you?<eos> It worked.<eos> I'm inside.<eos> Here we go.<eos> I'm gonna grab her password hash from memory and try and crack it.
Hello?<eos> You're getting warmer, Lindy.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> They don't love you.<eos> Not like I do.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - George, it was him.<eos> What are you calling me on?<eos> The killer led me down here, left me a phone to find.<eos> Can you trace it?
She's up to something.<eos> Wait.<eos> I just remembered.<eos> That red-hot ginger freak that Tessa was devouring, I know where he's from.<eos> That night you signed Lindy up, he was one of the guys she matched with on Flirtual.<eos> See, my perfect social memory strikes again.<eos> Coincidences happen.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just give it to me.
Yeah, I've been texting, Stace. I've been texting.<eos> It's Lawless.<eos> Hey, it's getting late.<eos> I guess you're still out.<eos> Not getting texts.<eos> If you could just let me know, maybe ballpark when you're gonna...<eos> Or whatever.<eos> I can just leave a key under the mat.<eos> The one right at the front door.<eos> I'll leave it under there.
- Jesus Christ.<eos> He wants to post a photo of us from last night.<eos> Who gives a fuck?<eos> Dan, you're not the gatekeeper of the Facebook page.<eos> Please, give him the password.<eos> Oliver is not a committee member, Lucy.<eos> Yeah, but Craig is.<eos> But he's just gonna give it to him, Jerry.<eos> No, I won't give it to him.<eos> Because I can only give it to people who are on the committee.
Who sells your equipment...<eos> Goodwill?<eos> What are we gonna do, Russ?<eos> We gotta be able to record this buy.<eos> Oh, I know, I know, um...<eos> Okay, um,<eos> Teddy calls us from his phone and he puts it on speaker.<eos> Yeah, and as soon as a horn honks anywhere within the block, I get to get raped.<eos> - We'll mute it.<eos> - And just leave it on the table?
Well, he's gotta uncrawl.<eos> Chuckie, why didn't you stay in Karen's room?<eos> I had a bad dream.<eos> Well, you might as well get up and get ready for school.<eos> And you, mister, meds and vitals.<eos> I can't.<eos> I gotta work on my project. Busy.<eos> Frank.<eos> Meds and vitals now.<eos> Why are they tearing it down?
You mean like live together?<eos> Isn't that what we've been doing?<eos> Yeah, but you got your own dorm room.<eos> I'm gonna miss my plane.<eos> Look, uh, have a good summer, man, yeah?<eos> You too, dude.<eos> It's been real.<eos> Yeah, let's get out of here.<eos> It's the only one I could find in all that crap in the yard. Ah.<eos> Put it in the window.
But-- we should be careful not to spread rumors.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who is it, Ruby?<eos> A fellowship gathering. Mandatory attendance.<eos> Give me a reading on Ruby's chip.<eos> She was late to work.<eos> Pine needles in her hair.<eos> She's at home in bed.<eos> Let me see.<eos> She must have taken her chip out last night and left it in her room.
Well, your mum.<eos> I mean, I'm not being funny, but the thought of your mum answering that door is a bit shocking, so...<eos> I thought she'd give me grief on account of where I've been.<eos> - You mean prison?<eos> - Yeah, prison.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You look beautiful, too.<eos> I know it's a bit late, right, but...<eos> I've got your Christmas present here.<eos> - Do you want me to throw it up?
- You mean prison?<eos> - Yeah, prison.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You look beautiful, too.<eos> I know it's a bit late, right, but...<eos> I've got your Christmas present here.<eos> - Do you want me to throw it up?<eos> - No.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to deliver it?
You work for me, now.<eos> But you have to be careful.<eos> This Brown is a-a-a pretty unpleasant character... ..and he's clever.<eos> So your job is to observe, that's all.<eos> If you feel you're in any danger, then you report to this telephone number.<eos> 3, 7, 9.<eos> Say it now.<eos> - 3, 7, 9.<eos> - 3, 7, 9.<eos> You memorise it.
Cut it out, Bev.<eos> Why don't you just bugger off like Tolly?<eos> Leave it.<eos> What am I doing here, Braith?<eos> Huh?<eos> We've all read Homer.<eos> We've read all the Greeks.<eos> Gods of this place will destroy you on a whim.<eos> Lack of men, sickness, ill luck and now stasis.<eos> I'm facing a Gordian knot, Braith, and I must cut through it or the gods will tear me apart.
Thought you were dead.<eos> I am dying.<eos> Come back to get ya, you'd better watch out.<eos> Right then, let's show these Turks...<eos> Oh shit.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Move!<eos> Come on!<eos> But I thought you say we lost that hill.<eos> We did, sir but we retook it.
Oh shit.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Move!<eos> Come on!<eos> But I thought you say we lost that hill.<eos> We did, sir but we retook it.<eos> Third time?<eos> No sir, it would be a fourth time.<eos> Good.<eos> We've lost it again.
- Yes, a drug trafficker.<eos> Back then, we were just finding out about the effects of cocaine - on the human brain.<eos> We didn't know much, but we knew it was some pretty powerful shit.<eos> ...this will give us better results, OK?<eos> Cocaine hijacks the pleasure centers in the brain.<eos> A rat will choose cocaine over food and water.<eos> It would choose cocaine over sleep, over sex... over life itself.<eos> The human brain isn't quite the same as a rodent's... unless we're talking about cocaine.<eos> Cockroach knew he had the perfect product.<eos> He just needed to smuggle it to the right markets.
No, no, no.<eos> "Cockroach" to my friends.<eos> All right, yesterday we were talking, and I think this business can make us a lot of money.<eos> Explain.<eos> Well... I get the paste in Peru.<eos> I will handle the chemical part of production, and all the other details in producing this exquisite white powder.<eos> What I need from you is to help me get it into Colombia.<eos> - Now tell him how much it costs.<eos> In Chile, this little thing costs ten bucks a gram.<eos> - They sell it by grams?
Importing potatoes from Peru is easy.<eos> - Of course. Same old contraband routes. If we all start buying potatoes at the same time, the Peruvians will raise the price.<eos> Be careful, guys.<eos> They also grow potatoes in Bolivia.<eos> We can reduce the cost of the refining process if we buy together.<eos> Well, guys, the hard part is getting the merchandise to Miami.<eos> You need a lot of creativity for that.<eos> How much would you charge us to be "creative"?<eos> You deliver the product to me, labeled.<eos> I will take it to Miami and deliver it to your contact there.
I don't think there even is a Mrs Owen.<eos> We must all have something in common, someone who knows us all.<eos> Well, how can that be possible?<eos> I can imagine crossing paths with a doctor... a judge, but someone like Mr Lombard?<eos> Well, we've crossed paths now. Haven't we?<eos> Mr Lombard, Blore tells me that you have a revolver.<eos> Oh, Tubs.<eos> Why have you got a gun?<eos> He's got a gun?<eos> I carry it everywhere.
What, Wargrave and Armstrong?<eos> You wait up here for me.<eos> It was locked.<eos> Which means there must be a master key.<eos> Rogers must have had a master key.<eos> You two dealt with the body!<eos> And you found it!<eos> Or did you?<eos> You shrieking like a woman, was that a bit of amateur dramatics, was it?<eos> I did nothing to Rogers. I didn't take any master key, we don't even know if there IS a master key, and we only had your word that the gun was stolen, you could've taken it.
Well done!<eos> Almost.<eos> We can't just sit here doing nothing!<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Light a fire on the headland, signal for help?<eos> Not in this weather.<eos> Where's... where's she going?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To make tea.<eos> I'll bring it in.
There we are.<eos> I thought there was somebody in the room with me.<eos> Here, have some brandy.<eos> Good for you, Vera.<eos> What, you think I've done something to it?<eos> I'm going to go and fetch another bottle that hasn't been opened.<eos> - I need some water.<eos> - This brandy's all right.<eos> I haven't done anything to it.<eos> Brandy's good for shock, that's why I got it.
- Are you sure?<eos> - Well, look at him!<eos> We searched everywhere for that gun.<eos> You went back downstairs to get the bottle.<eos> You went downstairs, too, to get a glass of brandy.<eos> And you, you disappeared for a bit.<eos> To fetch my bag so that I could attend to...<eos> Vera!<eos> We didn't hear the shot.<eos> You could have muffled it with a cushion.
And you'll come down for that?<eos> I have to go.<eos> Poor little Cyril.<eos> Poor little Cyril.<eos> Vera?<eos> It's us.<eos> It was just on your bed.<eos> It was just... on my bed.<eos> Well, how do I know you didn't plant it in there last night?<eos> If Philip had the gun before now, he would have taken it with you when you went after Armstrong, wouldn't he?
Who did you get the scent on, right from the off?<eos> (Armstrong.)<eos> Red herring.<eos> He's been playing us off each other from the start.<eos> And he's still alive.<eos> Because people don't just vanish, not on an island this size.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> I've got an allotment at home.<eos> In Edmonton.<eos> I love it.
No!<eos> No, I'm not going to kill you, Vera.<eos> - But there's somebody else on this island...<eos> - No, there's no-one else!<eos> There's somebody on this island and they're going to kill us both if you don't give me that gun.<eos> There's no-one else, you've killed them all!<eos> Listen to me, we're being hunted!<eos> Right now, we're being hunted!<eos> I need the gun!<eos> Give it to me.
It's killing me... what happened.<eos> What I did to Mr. Gates.<eos> I keep on replaying it in my mind every waking moment, trying to see another way.<eos> I don't expect you to understand, but I need you to know that no one on this ship feels his loss more keenly than I do.<eos> I know he developed a great affection for you.<eos> Perhaps if I can support you in this moment, it will be some small penance for what I've done.<eos> How exactly do you propose to support me?<eos> By giving you good counsel.<eos> We're losing our favorable wind.<eos> Been losing it for hours.
It's a Spanish warship!<eos> There's a Spanish galleon anchored in the harbor!<eos> Is today some sort of holiday that I've forgotten about?<eos> Spanish warship anchored in the bay.<eos> Word is it's Flint's crew sailing her.<eos> And it's scaring the shit out of everyone on the beach.<eos> Flint's sailing a Spanish warship?<eos> Think we should try and lure some of them inside?<eos> Wait.<eos> Does he have it?
Allow me introduce your new caregiver, Miss Yoo Jiyeon.<eos> You're showing up later than expected.<eos> As if you'd had to come half way round the world.<eos> Since it's a live-in job, I've had to make a lot of preparations for life on board.<eos> And I had to say my farewells to the elderly lady I've been caring for in a nursing home.<eos> So you were late because of some old hag?<eos> Insolent wench.<eos> Did you ever take a look at that logo?<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - You'll see it in half the casinos in Macau
Um...<eos> We have some extra robes.<eos> I'll, uh, go get them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yay.<eos> This is literally saving our lives.<eos> Yeah, we could get sick and die.<eos> You have your phone?<eos> Uh yeah, why?<eos> I can try and fix it.
I'll, uh, go get them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yay.<eos> This is literally saving our lives.<eos> Yeah, we could get sick and die.<eos> You have your phone?<eos> Uh yeah, why?<eos> I can try and fix it.<eos> Really? Oh.<eos> My kid dropped mine in the tub, and you won't believe this, but if you put it in rice it kinda dries it out.
I forgot.<eos> I got rid of all the stink bombs before you babysat Leslie's kids.<eos> Being responsible adults sucks butts.<eos> Butts, that's it.<eos> I'll streak across the stage.<eos> Yes, I love it.<eos> I'm gonna get naked.<eos> I'm gonna get up there.<eos> Everyone is gonna see my weiner.<eos> I mean, you've seen it.
Even Leslie is crazier than we are.<eos> They're still gonna serve that cake, right?<eos> And then I said, uh, you might want to check with the penguin.<eos> I get it.<eos> You Gryzzl guys are a real hoot.<eos> - And you have so much money.<eos> - Thanks, Jessie.<eos> And, hey, enjoy that new prototype Gryzzl tablet, huh?<eos> I will.<eos> I just love it.
– Are you driving now?<eos> – Yes, I'll do that.<eos> – Good.<eos> – Drive up and we'll see you soon.<eos> – OK.<eos> We're leaving soon too. – Out, quickly!<eos> Everyone has to get out now!<eos> – Please, listen to me!<eos> – What about the luggage?<eos> To hell with it!
Into the hotel?<eos> I'm not talking about this just now.<eos> While your son is sick?<eos> There's nothing I can do about that, is there?<eos> Just concentrate on your job, frank.<eos> I need you to do that.<eos> The gpr scan that you gave to the professor.<eos> Yes.<eos> Morton has the scan.<eos> He found it in the professor's house and he took it.
No, it's ALS.<eos> Yeah, that's short for Alzheimer's, right?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Okay, so how can I help?<eos> Well... you could be there for your daughter.<eos> Linda?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Please have IDs and tickets ready to view.<eos> Belts and shoes off, please.<eos> If you have a laptop, please put it in a bin by itself.
Hard to decide what's best when Mo's cooking.<eos> Come on, Linda. Sit down.<eos> Have some breakfast.<eos> No, I'm good, thanks.<eos> I'm not really hungry.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> Okay, well, suit yourself.<eos> By the way, you look good in my robe.<eos> Keep it.
Even if somehow we can set sail to retrieve this gold without anyone knowing it, even if the intelligence is correct and the gold is retrievable, we haven't even begun to address the issue of where we'll put all that gold, much less defend it.<eos> I mean... is this really something we're capable of doing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Yes, we are capable of doing this and more.<eos> We will have that prize, Mr. Featherstone.<eos> We've all come too far to let an opportunity like this pass us by.<eos> Would you not agree?<eos> I humbly suggest you continue unloading the hold.<eos> By the time anyone expects to reload it, you will be close enough to departure to tell them the truth, yes?
Idon'tseeany reasonthose instructions don't apply to you, too.<eos> - If anything--<eos> - Stop!<eos> They're telling the truth.<eos> He's an old friend of my father's.<eos> I remember him.<eos> I know him.<eos> And if you strike him again, my father will know you did so after I made this clear to you.<eos> Welcome to Charles Town.<eos> Charles Vane corralled 40 of the hardest men in the New World, brought them in line, brought them across an ocean to this fort and conquered it with no support from the water, no siege engineering, just the will to take it,
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Where are you?<eos> Just on our way out of Jerusalem.<eos> Had to take a small detour.<eos> What's going on?<eos> The breastplate.<eos> It's supposed to be worn by some high priest.<eos> He uses it as some kind of a device to communicate.
- Yes, that's it.<eos> Head down.<eos> Wha...<eos> And what about Yussef Khalid?<eos> How does he fit in?<eos> - Huh? - Sh... She was at the market.<eos> And I don't think it was a coincidence.<eos> I think she was meant to give him something.<eos> A st... A stone.<eos> I think that's what he was looking for in her apartment, and he took it off me and ran.
Yes.<eos> As long as it's not that bad.<eos> -And if it's bad?<eos> What image do you see then?<eos> -Stabs like hell.<eos> Like hell?<eos> Like a sea urchin.<eos> Interesting.<eos> -What's so interesting about it?<eos> Is it possible that there's a very, very evil sea urchin living in your head? That hurts so much sometimes that you want to destroy it?
She fell in love, what was I supposed to do?<eos> Say something maybe?<eos> That three men could be her father?<eos> Yeah, why not?<eos> She must never find out, please!<eos> That's what Köck was blackmailing him with.<eos> That's why he shot him!<eos> -You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Where is Saarinen's gun, do you still have it?<eos> -I threw it away a long time ago.
Be brave.<eos> Go out and discover the world.<eos> There are so many stories I should have told you about my own childhood.<eos> How good it was to just lie on the pier and wait for life to begin.<eos> "Make every film as if it's the last thing you do," said Bergman.<eos> What began as a small film has grown bigger and bigger.<eos> Sometimes I think you'll be adults before I have time to finish the movie.<eos> Where does it come from, this irresistible urge to outdo yourself?<eos> Lately I've thought about the story of the great white whale, Moby Dick.<eos> About the captain who pursued it, knowing he risked everything, including his own life. But he did it anyway.
So he's going back on himself.<eos> North, South, East, West.<eos> "Don't try and second guess me or look for any pattern".<eos> Which doesn't mean there isn't one.<eos> Nothing off the M25 cameras yet?<eos> Too much - "dark coloured Volvo" is such a wide search parameter.<eos> They're flooded with possible suspect vehicles.<eos> "Overwhelmed" is the word they used.<eos> - Got his phone.<eos> - I'll take it.
Are you sure this is allowed?<eos> Well, I'm allowing it.<eos> I am Acting Sister every Tuesday.<eos> Besides, we can't possibly leave you on your own on your first night.<eos> Gosh, Cinzano Bianco!<eos> We're branching out.<eos> And it won't be Bianco for very long because I'm putting some rosehip syrup in it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Oh, Patsy!<eos> We can't give it away at the clinic.
You're down for two pints a day.<eos> Tell your mother to be sure to put them out each morning.<eos> Thanks, Nurse.<eos> He leaves a bit of an aroma in his wake, poor little tyke.<eos> Lucky that will soon be a thing of the past, with the new housing and indoor bathrooms.<eos> I didn't notice.<eos> I think the only indoor bathroom in my father's parish was ours.<eos> Oh, well done.<eos> You managed to get rid of quite a lot of rosehip syrup.<eos> I told them all I drink it myself and really like it.
Always.<eos> Nurse Crane!<eos> Nurse Crane.<eos> Dolores McEvoy and her family...<eos> Mr Lancing had a change of heart, they're being rehoused.<eos> Woohoo!<eos> That conscience weighed too heavy on him, after all.<eos> I hoped it would.<eos> Barley sugars, I hear they're your favourites.<eos> My birthday's some months off, I'm not given to celebrating it.
Or as a housewife?<eos> ~ I went to visit a very nice mother and baby home last week.<eos> ~ Oh.<eos> I know about those places.<eos> Dormitories, daily chores, lots of prayers...<eos> This place isn't at all like that.<eos> One of the midwives from Nonnatus works there and she's very good at setting up fresh chances for new mums.<eos> KNOCK AT DOOR<eos> The desk woman say it's OK.<eos> Well, all right. But you must put on this gown and take it off and wash your hands before you leave.
Because there's a boyfriend on the scene, and I know the difference between diabetes-related nausea and morning sickness.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> The results came back positive.<eos> ~ Oh, hell's teeth!<eos> ~ 'Hell's teeth, indeed.'<eos> Diabetes and pregnancy are a very dangerous... 'combination.'<eos> I can't be in the family way!<eos> I can't...<eos> I labelled the sample myself, and saw it packed up and sent off.<eos> You never told me you were sending it anywhere!
No-one is invincible.<eos> No. They aren't.<eos> I wish you'd just come and sit down and get cracking.<eos> I think my eyes will not permit it.<eos> Indisposition has dimmed them.<eos> You mean disinclination has dimmed them!<eos> You're always harping on about wanting to be needed.<eos> Mrs Turner looked worn out when she brought these round.<eos> This reminds me of when I first came to the Order, and I had to mark my habit and my veil with my number.<eos> I always liked the idea that a Sister I'd never known had had my number once, and that one day another girl would get it.

~ I'd come with you, but I'll be late on duty if I don't fly.<eos> ~ Gosh, yes.<eos> ~ It's 20 to.<eos> ~ 20 to?<eos> I thought it was about quarter past.<eos> ~ Oh, I must have got water in my watch.<eos> ~ Take my bike.<eos> ~ Are you sure?<eos> ~ Park it outside the nurses' home.<eos> I'll fetch it before my shift tonight.
Oh, Mrs Mills... ~ There are dressings in the tin...<eos> I shan't take from his care.<eos> We have enough care for both of you.<eos> (I'm sorry...)<eos> Gert kept all that worry to herself, because she didn't want to upset Tommy.<eos> They couldn't live without each other, you can see it, can't you?<eos> You need a hot drink.<eos> You made your point.<eos> Turkish coffee.<eos> My son, Derek, brought it back from a holiday and I've been saving it.
Johanssen, Jesus.<eos> The problem is water.<eos> I have created 126 square meters of soil.<eos> And every cubic meter of soil requires 48 liters of water to be farmed with.<eos> So, I gotta make a lot more water.<eos> Good thing is, I know the recipe.<eos> You take hydrogen, you add oxygen, you burn 'em.<eos> Now, I have hundreds of liters of unused hydrazine at the MDV.<eos> If I run the hydrazine over an iridium catalyst It'll separate into N2 and H2.<eos> And then if I just direct the hydrogen into a small area and burn it, likely remake the history of humanity.
You wanna remote controlled ascent with no backup coms?<eos> He's not even got to the bad stuff yet, Vincent.<eos> Well, let's get to the bad stuff!<eos> We need to remove the nose airlock, the windows and Hull Panel 19.<eos> You want to take the front of the ship off?<eos> Sure.<eos> The nose airlock alone is 400 kg.<eos> You want to send a man into space without the front of his ship?<eos> Well, no.<eos> We're gonna have him cover it with Hab canvas.
Finally, they are reunited.<eos> And for the first time, Kumar meets his son.<eos> But if Maya's man wants to stay, he's got work to do.<eos> Step one, befriend the alpha's lieutenants.<eos> Step two, put in some grooming time.<eos> Soon, Kumar can sit back, and the others come to him.<eos> But this all means nothing without the alpha's support.<eos> Step three, make up with Raja.<eos> Kumar's opportunity arrives in the form of jackfruit.<eos> Sloth bears have the best noses in the forest, so they always find it first.
I guess I'm taking you.<eos> - Putz.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Now we're talking.<eos> I'm telling you, it's getting dangerous out there.<eos> I don't feel safe going out.<eos> There's a rage in the air.<eos> You know what your problem is?<eos> You telegraph fear.<eos> The militants can smell it on you.
# Come on, baby Don't fear the reaper<eos> # Baby, take my hand Don't fear the reaper<eos> # We'll be able to fly Don't fear the reaper<eos> # Baby, I'm your man<eos> # La, la, la, la, la... #<eos> You got everything?<eos> Can I have my sign?<eos> - It's mine.<eos> - Dickhead.<eos> Give it to Lois for the trophy cabinet.
Remission!<eos> You've worked hard for it, son.<eos> They're saying we can probably go home in the meantime.<eos> What have you done to his hair?<eos> It was getting ratty.<eos> (Tell him about Christmas.)<eos> - Beg your pardon?<eos> - (Put your hearing aid in.)<eos> - 'Put your hearing aid in.'<eos> - I don't like wearing it.
Do they ever take a bath?<eos> They could.<eos> I could write that passage.<eos> What'd happen?<eos> Mm. Maybe she would look at his body in the glistening water, and the water would be warm and slippery.<eos> And then maybe she would take his...<eos> Sorry, guys.<eos> I think I left my... yeah, here's my phone right here.<eos> Uh, hi, Liza.<eos> Yeah, I found it.
But I still love him.<eos> I think I always will.<eos> Of course.<eos> Come here.<eos> Crap, it's Diana.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Liza.<eos> I'm at Monkey Bar, and I left my wallet on my desk.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I need you to bring it to me.
I do not know if you are kidding, Lieutenant Powers.<eos> I am not.<eos> What do you know about the plane, is as secret as the plane itself.<eos> If capture is a foregone conclusion. You go down with your plane.<eos> Now, if you think, you can ditch and get away. If you are, close enough to a border, fine.<eos> You know the ejection protocol.<eos> But, if you ditch. You bring the dollar with you.<eos> There is a pin inside.<eos> You scratch your skin anywhere, it is instantaneous.<eos> If you think, you will be captured... You use it.
-It's for my friend's son.<eos> - Who should he make it out to?<eos> - Sue Wilson.<eos> He's named after me. - Oh.<eos> - Is this the speech?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Any snags?<eos> - No, all good.<eos> Sir, Freddy Wallace may use the term LGBT.<eos> I remember it this way.
- Ben: That's what you do.<eos> - Bill: Shit shoveler.<eos> - Well, some shit doesn't get off.<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> And why is everybody calling my Families First Bill the Mommy Meyer Bill all of a sudden?<eos> You told me to connect your name to the bill.<eos> What is the tone that you're using right now?<eos> It's been a shitty day, ma'am, I apologize.<eos> - Uh-huh. - You asked me to call it the Meyer Bill.

Absolutely.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.<eos> Mr. Cafferty, pardon me being blunt, but why did Families First fail?<eos> It happens.<eos> Rain gonna fall, bar's gonna close, bill's gonna fail.<eos> There's a job for you at Hallmark, Mr. Cafferty.<eos> You don't seem upset that the bill failed.<eos> If I had kids, which actually I do, this bill would be my baby.<eos> I and the entire White House, we sweated a full transfusion of blood to pass this bill.<eos> So Jonah Ryan wasn't sent here to defend the bill, to deliberately undermine it?
- Three of those apple fritters.<eos> Fuck it, let's get a half dozen.<eos> - Paddy...<eos> - I'm on it. Yep.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - I did.<eos> That was sexy talk, there.<eos> Half dozen.<eos> This pool is even better than I remember it.
Mr. Bachman's walking back to you now.<eos> That's not my name.<eos> My name is Richard Hendricks.<eos> Hey, remember us?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> What's up?<eos> You know what you did.<eos> Okay? I saw your live stream.<eos> Okay? I saw your "algorithm."<eos> That's mine. You stole it.
But that would cost a ton. And we don't have that kind of money just lying around.<eos> It seems as though we do have that kind of money just lying around.<eos> But that's for the office space.<eos> -Was it?<eos> -No, no, no, no!<eos> Jared, we already signed the lease.<eos> It's too late, right? We can't break a lease.<eos> I mean, we haven't given them the check yet.<eos> -Here it is.<eos> -I could go mail it right now.
You talked me into staying here even though you knew we were breaking the law?<eos> (COUGHING) I'm sorry, Erlich, but I'm pissed.<eos> -You're pissed at me? -Yeah.<eos> -I should be pissed at you.<eos> You know why?<eos> Because when one is given a parting gift and one never parts, shouldn't one return the said gift?<eos> Isn't that what decorum would dictate?<eos> This is about the kimono?<eos> Okay, I will give it back to you right now, gladly.<eos> Now I'm really pissed. Because if one appreciated a gift of such magnitude, then one would put up more of a fight before returning it, wouldn't one?
- Just that?<eos> There's nothing else?<eos> - MAN: Nope.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Blaine doesn't die, but he is horribly incapacitated.<eos> And then while he's in the hospital he gets a flesh-eating virus, and then he dies.<eos> Well, obviously... His incessant suffering will be a strength.<eos> But our ability to enjoy it is an opportunity.<eos> What if before he dies<eos> Gina catches the virus? And then she spreads it from her vagina to your penis.
"EndFrame is a compression company<eos> "specializing in middle-out compression technology."<eos> Those pricks!<eos> They stole my algorithm!<eos> I know guys at the FBI we could call.<eos> Were you fucking hacked?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Well, how did they get it then?<eos> -L'm sorry?<eos> - How did they get it then, Richard?
Now?<eos> I would say this city is impregnable.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> - Go away, Bjorn!<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want this child.<eos> I don't want this child! I don't want this child!<eos> I do.<eos> It will be weak, deformed.<eos> Maybe you will love it just the same.
They must not get into the city.<eos> Show no mercy!<eos> Fight on!<eos> Your Highness is to be congratulated for the brave defense of our city.<eos> Hail the Emperor! - Has my son died?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Next time, we will not make the same mistakes.<eos> - All of this disaster is my fault. - Athelstan.<eos> Paris is everything you told me it would be.<eos> And I am bound and determined to conquer it.
All of it.<eos> You will tell them about the affair with Thomas.<eos> You will tell them how it ended.<eos> You will explain to them what it drove you to do.<eos> You will reveal everything.<eos> And when you do,<eos> Captain Flint will be unmasked, the monster slain.<eos> And in his place will stand before all the world a flawed man, a man that England can relate to and offer its forgiveness.<eos> What you're asking of me...<eos> I wish there were another way, but I have given it great thought and I cannot find it.
- They have toilet paper.<eos> All right, all right, they have toilet paper.<eos> Let's not get bogged down.<eos> The idea is, they're buying these basic human necessities, with the exception of toilet paper... (chuckles) which they already have.<eos> Well, they do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> And this is the part I love... (Laughs)<eos> They can spend their points to do shit to the people in the other boxes.<eos> They can make someone else's box colder or hotter or fill it with bugs.
- Still no fucking question.<eos> - Oh, okay.<eos> So I-I realize it's yours, but just, like... investment-wise... if you didn't have to sell it, would you buy this place?<eos> What do you mean, if I didn't have to sell it?<eos> Who told you I have to sell it?<eos> - Uh... - I may have said something.<eos> I don't have to sell it.<eos> I thought Britta said...<eos> Yeah, I probably misheard.<eos> I don't have to fucking sell it at all.
- Hey, Matt!<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Matt!<eos> Matt! - Hey, how are ya?<eos> Hey, you made it.<eos> Don't you look sharp?<eos> Yeah? You like the vest?<eos> - Very spiffy.<eos> - It's terrific.<eos> Yeah, well, that asshole won't let me wear it.
Thank you, sir.<eos> Let the cares of the day fade away.<eos> I lost some money.<eos> Jackass kid I picked up on the highway, knocked me out cold, took the money.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Not much.<eos> His car broke down.<eos> His car was on the highway?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Did you go find it?
Kill him?<eos> People die for less.<eos> At weddings, sometimes.<eos> Things get out of hand.<eos> You don't know what will happen.<eos> I would've killed him.<eos> I was so mad.<eos> I was outraged.<eos> Tore up the rosebush.<eos> We could plant it.
I need a doctor!<eos> - What happened?<eos> - The truck exploded.<eos> People are gonna want to hear from you.<eos> What does it matter what I think?<eos> Ben, you survived a terrorist attack.<eos> You're a hero now.<eos> Give me a reading on Ruby's chip.<eos> She's at home in bed.<eos> She must have taken her chip out last night and left it in her room.
You know, he goes to the bank, takes out a lot of cash and leaves it here.<eos> For the blackmailer to collect later.<eos> Which means there has to be two keys.<eos> Hang on. Hang on.<eos> How do you work that out?<eos> Because if this key was in Elias's safe, then how would the blackmailer get the cash out after he'd left?<eos> He had a copy!<eos> Which means this one must be the copy.<eos> The blackmailer has the original.<eos> So if you want to know who got the money, we just need to find out who got the key copied before they gave it to Elias.
It's close.<eos> What is that?<eos> That's her tracking implant.<eos> She clawed it out.<eos> How would it know to do that?<eos> She remembered where they put it in.<eos> It can camouflage!<eos> Evacuate the island.<eos> We'd never reopen.<eos> You made a genetic hybrid, raised it in captivity.
Okay.<eos> So, that leaves us with the mother goose treaty of 1918.<eos> They never forgave the way Beatrix Potter rewrote that bloody history.<eos> And Aesop's lyre.<eos> Loose nukes, nerve gas I know how to find.<eos> Where do we even start here?<eos> Autopsy.<eos> Autopsy on who?<eos> Well, the giant dead wolf, of course.<eos> Bring it back here.

There's a significant difference between preventing Ashe from making a trophy of Flint and saving Flint's life.<eos> Who's to say Vane doesn't help Flint escape from shore and then slit his throat the moment we're in open water?<eos> Along with all of ours?<eos> That was dark.<eos> You and your men are going to remain under guard while I go ashore.<eos> You know, we could help if you let us go.<eos> You can also try and take back this ship if I let you go.<eos> We share an interest in seeing Flint rescued, but make no mistake, this ship belongs to my men now.<eos> It was bargained to us.<eos> We claimed it and we intend to keep it.
No interest in fencing their plunder.<eos> No interest in lording over them in any way.<eos> For people like us, power in this place is most effective when it is least perceived.<eos> That is my offer to purchase your inherited interest in this tavern.<eos> It is more generous than any of the others received by your colleagues.<eos> I will expect your response by nightfall.<eos> Why is this so important to you?<eos> Why offer more for this place than the others?<eos> Sit.<eos> The conflict ahead promises much risk for us and very little reward to compensate for it.
I would think one would have to negotiate with the trees.<eos> You've moved churches and rivers.<eos> I cannot think it would be so difficult to move a forest - it is not so very large.<eos> These are living things, my Lord.<eos> They will have humours of their own.<eos> They may not care for soldiers.<eos> Perhaps we have reached the limits of your abilities, Mr Strange.<eos> Grant.<eos> Daylight, take a few men and escort Mr Strange into the forest.<eos> Do your best to see he's not shot... ~ at least till he's moved it. ~ My Lord.
Please.<eos> Tesla cut a deal with the government, they could have some of his patents if they never touched the old facility.<eos> They erased the records, built over the town, but they had to leave this dam.<eos> Tesla spent the rest of his life trying to figure out how to bring us back, but he was never able to in his lifetime.<eos> No, how could he?<eos> I mean, dimensional reintegration takes an enormous amount of energy, particularly for people who have been in flux as long as you have.<eos> This is a capacitor.<eos> Tesla built a capacitor to store the energy.<eos> The turbines are at the dam.<eos> I've been charging it for the past hundred years.
The capacitor was amplifying the harmonics exponentially.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Will it still work?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If this doesn't work the energy won't just blow out the gas lamps.<eos> It's going to blow everything around it.<eos> For how far?<eos> For miles.<eos> Hundreds of miles.<eos> We need to shut it down.
Up there.<eos> Au revoir, ma'am.<eos> It was working.<eos> It was going to work.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Col. Baird was trapped for a day, the rest of them had been in there for a century.<eos> We just... we just don't know that it would've held together long enough to help them.<eos> It will really take another hundred years for the capacitor to power up and try again?<eos> There's no capacitor.<eos> The discharge fried it.
I'm sorry that it wasn't.<eos> Nice meeting everybody.<eos> Sorry I ruined the book club.<eos> - Good-bye! Nice meeting you!<eos> - Bye, Howard.<eos> Hey.<eos> We followed you after you staggered out of the house.<eos> Yeah, we thought it best to keep a respectful distance until you were done crying and punching trees and trying to steal other people's children.<eos> Plus, Eric wanted a churro.<eos> I would give you some, but Stosh tried to take it, so I licked it.
Can we just change the subject of Abe Lucas, please?<eos> You've been singing his praises for half an hour.<eos> All right, well, then, how about I sing yours?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Good.<eos> - How's that?<eos> I love you in that sweater.<eos> Of course, you love me in this sweater.<eos> You bought it for me.
It's totally...<eos> I'm taking the bullets out.<eos> Do you shoot this?<eos> No, my dad takes it out into the woods sometimes.<eos> Where they play Russian Roulette.<eos> What's Russian Roulette?<eos> What's Russian Roulette?<eos> - Just explain it. - All right, fine.<eos> Okay, so, you take a bullet.<eos> Take a bullet and you put it in the chamber.

Then you spin it around, right?
So next time we go into France, we'll need a sea coast. Of course<eos> - Normandy, Brittany.<eos> Master Cromwell, your reputation is bad.<eos> You don't defend yourself?<eos> Your Majesty can form your own opinions.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.<eos> Are we to paint out the Cardinal's coat of arms?<eos> No.<eos> Paint it again.

I drove ambulances in the blackout.<eos> Well, what if someone runs into you?<eos> Miss Shepherd, what if someone runs into you?<eos> You have no business saying that.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> No one is going to run into me!<eos> Where's the key?<eos> - What key?<eos> - The car key.<eos> I put it down.

Which is why I was hoping to discuss the matter with you.<eos> ~ Indians may not use the mall before sundown, which I'm sure you, Mr Sood, very well know.<eos> Mr McLeod.<eos> ~ Good day, sir.<eos> ~ Good day.<eos> Thank God this is only once a year. Come on.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> So, 150 fruit scones, 150 plain scones, 150 rounds of sandwiches.<eos> All in time for the Sipi Fair.<eos> The challenge of re-creating afternoon tea at Claridge's, only serving it in the Himalayas.
Colonel Baird.<eos> Eve, if I may, I've never asked for anything in my life.<eos> Please, let me have this.<eos> It grants wishes, Eve.<eos> Know what I wish right now?<eos> I wish I had something for this eye!<eos> The house doesn't grant wishes.<eos> It helps people in need.<eos> It was built as a refuge.<eos> No one ever expected a serial killer to find it.

Get off the line.<eos> Go ahead, raise the pin.<eos> No.<eos> Slowly slowly.<eos> Go.<eos> Tire it toward you.<eos> I hold.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Hold it well.
Kill him.<eos> Eugene, no.<eos> No, Eugene.<eos> No !<eos> I beg you.<eos> I do not want to lose you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> Put that gun.<eos> Put it down.
Are we on the same island?<eos> I just got stoned by a bunch of kids!<eos> And someone just stabbed Sarah!<eos> We're so far past panic, it would take the light from panic 100 years to reach us.<eos> OK.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'll talk to Michael.<eos> I'll tell him about the mycotoxin in the honey.<eos> You go to the orchard, cordon off the infected hive.<eos> We need to destroy it properly and then bioseal the remains.
- I got my orders.<eos> - Then, they can recite them at your funeral.<eos> Because if you don't let me out of these cuffs, none of us are getting off this island alive!<eos> Let me go! Grr!<eos> Hey, keep them away from me!<eos> I need those sedatives.<eos> What's the holdup?<eos> I was just explaining.<eos> We only have 20 injectable doses of diazepam.<eos> And I can't allow you to use it on our people.
Glad your path brought you here where you can be the most help.<eos> I know a few places my path is gonna take me - when this is over.<eos> - Please, let's not let our unfinished business get in the way of caring for the sick.<eos> And don't let dogma prevent healing.<eos> It's the CDC's job to make sure our people get well.<eos> - Isn't that right? - The sedatives will provide a degree of comfort for the next 6 hours.<eos> - And what do we do after that?<eos> - Sominus.<eos> It's a hybrid of valerian skullcap and motherwort.<eos> Agnes was making it before she...
Previously on Helix...<eos> - You're being evacuated.<eos> - Why? - Pathogen is spreading.<eos> Make me immortal and you will get your child back.<eos> You can try it on me first.
All right, ladies and gentlemen, five more minutes.<eos> Use them well.<eos> We got one hour of daylight left.<eos> So we move in the search to higher ground.<eos> That'll give us a chance to pick up a SAT signal.<eos> Dr. Kyle, are you hungry?<eos> The flavor's oatmeal.<eos> Come on, eat some.<eos> It's good.<eos> Eat it!

Man: [We all sound the same underwater.]<eos> [We all sound the same underwater.]<eos> [We all sound the same... ]<eos> How the hell this disease is spreading so fast.<eos> - Any number of ways.<eos> - My cutter...<eos> Has it gone airborne?<eos> Screw this!<eos> We gotta get back to the ship.<eos> Stow it, Lieutenant.
You're so much more than that now.<eos> You have shed your old clothing along with your old life.<eos> You're reborn now.<eos> Ascendant.<eos> Under your guidance, we will prevail.<eos> We will take back our abbey.<eos> Our island.<eos> Why stop there?<eos> The outside world is soul-sick, Anne.<eos> Why not heal it?
Congressman Escobar...<eos> Sir!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Allow me to remind you of the norms of etiquette.<eos> You cannot enter the hall if you don't have a tie.<eos> All right.<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Juan.<eos> Look, Juan... that is a really nice tie.<eos> - My girlfriend gave it to me.
But if this turns out bad...<eos> it'll be on your conscience.<eos> What do we got?<eos> Routine airport surveillance.<eos> We tagged Poison.<eos> Who's this guy?<eos> I don't know, but if Poison showed his face to pick him up, he must be really important.<eos> Here's your payment, sir.<eos> It'll be taken to the coast of Spain on a cargo ship.<eos> From there, our trucks will take it to the Basque country.
Against orders, we did high-altitude flyovers of the prison<eos> - with our infrared cameras.<eos> - No tunnels.<eos> Tomography report indicates nothing.<eos> Seismic measuring, nada.<eos> Can we measure radio frequency energy?<eos> Well, we could try.<eos> Doesn't penetrate deeper than 30 feet.<eos> If he's bringing shit into this tunnel, you can bet he's going out that way.<eos> If there's a tunnel there, he must have dug it to China.
Putting Harry away, these are issues that could haunt us forever.<eos> (Rosie) And you know this how, Anouk?<eos> By writing your TV show?<eos> Oh, I'm incapable of holding an opinion about a child because I've never had children.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Rosie... (Anouk) Aisha, let me finish.<eos> She shouldn't ask what I think if she doesn't want to know.<eos> I mean, I'm fascinated by this perception that unless one has children, one is somehow exempted from...<eos> Fine, why don't you tell me what you would do if it were your child.<eos> If I had a kid and Harry slapped it, I would kill him myself, but I wouldn't drag in the law...
- Roberts.<eos> - Roberts, you have to help me.<eos> - Who is this?<eos> - It's me.<eos> Prank-calling the police station might not be the smartest thing to do, young man.<eos> There were two necklaces.<eos> - Two versions of you...<eos> - And two Garys.<eos> But Alice doesn't have a talisman here...<eos> Which means for some reason she never had it here.

Er, yes?<eos> Are we doing something wrong, Detective?<eos> - Yes, you are, Mia.<eos> - Such as...?<eos> - Well, you... you know.<eos> - No. I don't.<eos> Well, you could do so much better than this... clown.<eos> Gimme your skateboard.<eos> - W-why?<eos> - I'm confiscating it.
It was Alice's.<eos> She doesn't have one here.<eos> - Which she should, shouldn't she?<eos> - There were two necklaces.<eos> - Two versions of you.<eos> - And two Garys.<eos> - I-I'm confused.<eos> - He's back!<eos> But Alice doesn't have a talisman here - that's why she was after yours.<eos> Which means, for some reason, she never had it here!

- I'll go willingly.<eos> - You can keep your powers.<eos> - He's going after Andy by himself.<eos> - Wait!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> - We completely understand!<eos> - We have to get out of here.<eos> - Seriously, dude, now!<eos> Order must be restored.<eos> You must restore it.
Here's your choir.<eos> - It will be fine. - We know it will be fine.<eos> Thanks for calling.<eos> Good to see you again. It's been a whole week!<eos> Let's stretch our vocal chords, so that we can last all night.<eos> And I thought we'd do this one. Remember it'?<eos> I bought a tablet this weekend.<eos> Know how they work'?<eos> No. I had a mobile phone, but it was in the shower with me.<eos> I'd put it on the window sill, and I was going to answer it.

Weren't you gonna steal it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're leaving tomorrow.<eos> You know we're going to beat those postcards home.<eos> I want them to say key west.<eos> Who gave you cocaine as a birthday present? My old partner.<eos> It's all over malibu.<eos> We said we'd try everything.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think you're supposed To sniff it off your fingernail.
Come on, Ozzy.<eos> Okay, be good. Have fun.<eos> Hey, can we pet your service dog, you little wuss?<eos> Hey, leave him alone.<eos> Pick on someone your own size.<eos> Oh, are you his girlfriend?<eos> Are those your girlfriends?<eos> Hey, give me back my backpack.<eos> Give it...<eos> Give it to me!
Now!<eos> Bobby!<eos> Look out.<eos> Bobby!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Bobby.<eos> You okay?<eos> We missed the callbacks for the show.<eos> Now we'll never have a chance to save the house.<eos> We had our one chance, and we missed it.
I told you, 'cause we're going steady.<eos> - He's my main squeeze.<eos> - You sound like a 12-year-old.<eos> It's a total turn-off.<eos> My cock ring is sliding off.<eos> Why my father is talking to me with a cinch around his penis is beyond my grasp.<eos> You gotta be ready for when the orgy breaks out.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It fell off. - Ugh...<eos> - Help me find it.
Isn't this a decision that people typically make together?<eos> - So you wanted a baby?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> That's kind of absurd.<eos> We've been together for less than seven weeks.<eos> I don't think that we're ready for a child.<eos> Crazier things have happened.<eos> People do crazy things.<eos> My parents got married after a fucking week.<eos> Okay, so we should have the baby and put it in your toolbox as a cradle and feed it sardines and tell it that you don't know my middle name?
Hands in the air!<eos> Don't turn around!<eos> Okay. Don't turn around!<eos> Get on the ground!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Give me your gun!<eos> I said do it!<eos> Your 211 pager.<eos> Now!<eos> Put it down!
Excuse me.<eos> Is this where Agent Vega worked?<eos> Sorry?<eos> I'm Detective Brian Portis, Austin homicide.<eos> I've been assigned to Agent Vega's case.<eos> She work here?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Which was her desk?<eos> I'm gonna have to ask that nobody touch that till I've had a chance to go through it.
Thanks for coming in.<eos> Glad to.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Nice office.<eos> I don't get a lot of air-conditioning in my life.<eos> Anything going down in the park that we should know about?<eos> Like what?<eos> Something Donnie and Megan may have seen that somebody didn't want them to see.<eos> Maybe a drug operation?<eos> Uh, we did a major sweep of the park a few months ago, cleaned it out.
Yeah.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> I'm Agent Wylie.<eos> What do you know about the murders?<eos> He's shy.<eos> I had to drag him over here.<eos> He doesn't like talking, but I told him he had to say what he saw.<eos> He witnessed the crime?<eos> No, he didn't witness it.<eos> He saw it.
All right.<eos> Get some dinner.<eos> Be ready in an hour.<eos> Okay.<eos> Closing time.<eos> I'm kicking you out.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> I have a free game here.<eos> Okay, tell you what.<eos> You bring me that case of beer and put it over there, and I'll let you play your free game.
It's calories, energy.<eos> Help warm you up.<eos> But someone's had it already.<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Here.<eos> You have that.<eos> I don't like cheese.<eos> Well, that's why I've given you the pie.<eos> Look, no one's eaten this bit here.<eos> No one's touched it.
Why are you carrying it around?<eos> Just found it, shoved it in my pocket.<eos> No reason.<eos> This was found in Stoddart's bedroom.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a diagram of a mammoth's jawbone.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> I showed that tooth to Stoddart in the car park.<eos> I told him I found it in the ground.
Stick it in a microwave.<eos> I want to examine the evidence, not cook it. Evidence?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, it's a really long shot.<eos> He went after the ice drill? Yes.<eos> Alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> You think Jason might have stolen it? Uh, maybe.<eos> We won't know till Eric tracks the thing down.<eos> Well, if it's not Jason, then it's someone ruthless enough to cave a man's skull in just to steal some stupid piece of machinery he can't even get off the island.<eos> Eric intends to make the arrest and bring the drill back to town, no matter who took it.
Bill Pettigrew found it, and this is the place.<eos> Come on!<eos> Eric, we found Jason.<eos> We have him under arrest.<eos> Right.<eos> I still need to talk to him, so... - Okay. - Thanks, Ciaran.<eos> Listen, I know what happened to you.<eos> The thing you found has made you very, very ill.<eos> And I know that the mammoth is real.<eos> You found it, didn't you?
If I remember my theological studies correctly, - that's quite impossible.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A mythical language.<eos> - No.<eos> A dead language.<eos> The word of the devil.<eos> According to Biblical lore, the Verbis Diablo is a corruption of angelical speech.<eos> What Adam spoke in Paradise before the serpent made his memorable appearance.<eos> The story goes,<eos> Satan took God's language and turned it inside out.
Good Christians fear hellfire so to avoid it they are kind to their fellow man.<eos> Good pagans do not have this fear so they can be who they are.<eos> Good or ill, as their nature dictates.<eos> We have no fear of God so we are accountable to no one but each other.<eos> That's a profound responsibility.<eos> And why you do this, no doubt.<eos> Helping those in need.<eos> I came here for selfish reasons.<eos> Do you truly not believe in heaven?<eos> I believe in this world and those creatures that fill it.
Sorry I'm late.<eos> Mr. Ferdinand Lyle Dr. Victor Frankenstein.<eos> How do you do?<eos> Doctor.<eos> Charmed.<eos> So you're the chappie who's going to translate the mythical language?<eos> Not so mythical as you think, young man.<eos> The Verbis Diablo, the Devil's Tongue, has roots as old as Aramaic and likely much older.<eos> It was an oral tradition for the most part like most now dead languages.<eos> We haven't entirely lost it, we've just forgotten it.
Trust me, you've quite a challenge.<eos> I feel like a mule.<eos> All right, I'm finished.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Have on.<eos> I can't believe you've ever been this silent in your entire life.<eos> Lily... you look beautiful.<eos> - I can't breathe.<eos> - That's the corset.<eos> Yes, I know what it is, cousin, I'm wearing it.
They'd take over the world.<eos> The only way we men prevent that is by keeping women corseted... in theory... and in practice.<eos> They're meant to flatter the figure.<eos> To a man's eye, anyway.<eos> All we do is for men, isn't it?<eos> Keep their houses... raise their children, flatter them with our pain.<eos> No.<eos> Does this corset flatter me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you want me to wear it?

And I'm the guy to find him.<eos> Because you're the best?<eos> Yes.<eos> And then you can extoll the wonders of McCann. Everybody wins.<eos> I don't need to poach.<eos> You know, I helped you for free after that stupid merger.<eos> And then you sent Peggy to Gerald what's-his-name when she was in need.<eos> This is how I make my living, Pete.<eos> I've paid you at some point.<eos> You'd want this business if you knew you couldn't have it.
Second, you must protect yourself against chemical warfare.<eos> Tammy does not abide by the Geneva convention.<eos> I made this Tammy de-programming kit in case I ever fell victim to her again.<eos> First, this is a chastity belt that I made by hand.<eos> It might be a couple sizes too big for you, but you can just pad it.<eos> The first step is to cut out all sex.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> We haven't done the deed yet.<eos> She lets me rub up against her leg sometimes.<eos> Well, all the more reason to wear it.
It's in the Constitution.<eos> There's no cursing in the Constitution.<eos> Look, before you do that--<eos> - Too late.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Fire in the hole!<eos> I gave you that as a gift on your fifth anniversary as Parks director.<eos> You told me this was a genuine partially defused claymore mine.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> I bought the empty shell off of eBay, and then I filled it with, you know, balloons and confetti and such.
God, I don't think I can do it, though.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I'm getting ready to go on a big trip, to space.<eos> That'll be really fun too.<eos> Everything in life is always just so fun, right?<eos> It really is.<eos> See, this guy knows what's what.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That was--yeah.<eos> Hey, Ben, have you ever been to space?<eos> You should check it out.

Excuse me, Judge Perd?<eos> I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.<eos> What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That's a serious allegaysh, homie.<eos> We are hella chill.<eos> And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz.<eos> Well, we kind of do.<eos> I mean, the internet is no longer optional, it's a necessity for everyone.<eos> And I think you do know that data-mining isn't chill, because you snuck it into the 27th update of a 500-page user agreement.
We don't know anything about that.<eos> (Ron) Boys, think.<eos> We are on a quest, and we are not leaving until we get an answer.<eos> Well, we're on our own quest, which is to squeeze this just tight enough to make my eyes bulge out a little bit, but not so tight that I die.<eos> (Andy) Oh, I've been there.<eos> That's a real tightrope walk.<eos> Oh! Hey!<eos> Last week this real scary ghost came down here looking for it.<eos> It had black hair, but you could see through its skin, and it didn't like me, but that's just 'cause I got a soul of a Ghostbuster.<eos> Yeah, it said something about how it was worried Brett was gonna mug it.
He just spoke.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I just got here.<eos> I had a broken bike chain.<eos> My bad.<eos> So I guess we are celebrating that you trusted me and I let you down.<eos> Great.<eos> I change my house locks every 16 days.<eos> That key has been useless since the second Tuesday after I gave it to you.
I gotta go pull the plug on my dad in ten minutes.<eos> I heard you were buying JJ's Diner and kicking everybody out.<eos> That's true.<eos> Real estate prices in this turd town are through the roof.<eos> I'm gonna turn that place into an elbow art salon and make a killing.<eos> Plus, who's gonna miss some dumpy diner?<eos> Why don't you ask the people gathering outside of your building right now?<eos> What do we want?<eos> Breakfast!<eos> When do we want it?
Can I get the "me" soft-shell crab?<eos> Josh Groban!<eos> He's eating his own sushi!<eos> That's the most baller thing I've ever seen.<eos> Welcome to Beachview Terrace, the sad, unsalvageable, broken-down armpit of Pawnee.<eos> Yeah, we tried to clean up this neighborhood so many times.<eos> Nothing's worked.<eos> We sent a street cleaner through here a few months ago.<eos> Raccoons ate the wheels right off it.<eos> Councilman Dexhart represents this district, and ten years ago when he was elected, he promised to clean it up.
I am sorry I let you down, ok, all of you, but the way that you are feeling right now...<eos> This despair, this hunger...<eos> I have been through it, and if you let me help you survive it, I guarantee you, it will only make you stronger.<eos> At sundown, Vincent is gonna drop that barrier spell, and those doors are gonna open, and we are gonna be smack in the middle of a parade full of innocent people.<eos> We can't fall apart now. Gia:<eos> Innocent, guilty, we're hungry.<eos> We have to feed.<eos> We don't feed on locals.<eos> That's our rule.<eos> That is how we survived 300 years in this city, and that is why we get to call it home, because we live by a code.
Say your name after the tone.<eos> - This is your daughter Hannah.<eos> Please pick up.<eos> - Honey?<eos> - Is it Hannah?<eos> Yeah, collect. She's calling collect.<eos> Accept the charges. - Hi.<eos> - Honey, what happened to your phone?<eos> Askherwhathappenedtoherphone.<eos> Oh, I just dropped it in a creek 'cause I was... creek walking with just a group of my new friends.
Now you're just abusing the metaphor.<eos> This is the last of it... and if you ask me, this oatmeal should be for breakfast, not voodoo.<eos> It's not abracadabra.<eos> It's nature's anti-itch cream.<eos> It's medicine.<eos> So why you making it and not the infirmary?<eos> Good fucking question. Dame.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Inmate, there've been complaints about moldy rice.<eos> I need you to show me where you store it.
Norma is gonna do for jungle magic.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Luschek.<eos> Remember when I... what the fuck?<eos> !<eos> All right, listen.<eos> Remember when I said the heroin is stolen?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Okay, well, I'm the one who stole it.
What if she's mean or likes Coldplay or something?<eos> It's all gelling right now.<eos> So, I'm supposed to put on that feo hair net and scrub pots and pans every day because it's gelling?<eos> I'm so much better than that.<eos> - You saying you're better than me?<eos> - No!<eos> You're good, too.<eos> All I'm saying is that I got aspirations.<eos> I always have, even in here.<eos> You know, when I wear that apron in the kitchen... I'm really wearing it ironically.
No, no. No chiming in.<eos> What, you think I don't know how to run my kitchen?<eos> All right, Maria. You're in charge while I take my visitation.<eos> You're gonna leave me here with these clowns?<eos> Try not to fuck it all up, huh?<eos> It's good to see you back in here, Gina. Hey, Red.<eos> We've come to see Norma, actually.<eos> A bunch of us were wondering if you would meet with us in a group.<eos> My wiccan circle's getting weird.<eos> Protchnick keeps rubbing the energy ball on her cooter, and who wants to touch it after that? You know, so...
I should hang a slip of brochures on my back for "frequently asked questions about being transgender."<eos> Hey, Michael, Benny, I'm about to make dinner.<eos> - Benny's staying for dinner? - Uh-huh.<eos> Michael, what is that?<eos> String cheese.<eos> God.<eos> Thanks, Michael's mom.<eos> Did I tell you he started wearing cologne?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sprays it on like it's insect repellent.
That is all, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey. She went back to him for sex.<eos> That's so cheap.<eos> Everything in this book is all about sex.<eos> That's because it's meant to be.<eos> It's smut.<eos> It doesn't have to be.<eos> She had a chance for love, but she blew it.
Yeah, but it wasn't a big deal.<eos> I didn't know she was in there till, like, seven months.<eos> How could you not know?<eos> You weigh 90 pounds.<eos> You must have looked like an egg with four sticks in it.<eos> I'm not a scientist, okay?<eos> I was smoking a lot of pot that summer.<eos> I got pineapple!<eos> You eat this, things will go fast.<eos> La china found it on the bottom shelf in commissary.
- Do what?<eos> - Anything.<eos> You don't have to do anything.<eos> We're friends now.<eos> I like you.<eos> If you want ice cream, you just ask. Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's your favorite flavor?<eos> My favorite flavor is... double-fudge chocolate.<eos> Though I've never been able to understand how you can take chocolate, right, and then double it?

It was her who done the wicked deed, sirs.<eos> I know it in my bones!<eos> I was on that hill that night, but I didn't harm your child!<eos> I was trying to help him!<eos> So you admit it.<eos> Witch!<eos> I am a healer!<eos> I am a healer!<eos> I could not abandon a dying child!<eos> I was trying to save it!
Bonnie, I want you to go down to the police station to retrieve Sam's laptop.<eos> Take Mr. Millstone with you for backup.<eos> So, I know there's a lot of crazy stuff going down right now.<eos> You're not doing this here.<eos> I'm just saying I can't stop thinking about last night.<eos> Try harder.<eos> Did your boss give you the okay?<eos> Sorry, the records say the laptop's being held pending review by D.A. Parks' office.<eos> Okay, Wendy Parks is on record saying Sam Keating isn't a suspect here.<eos> She's only keeping it so she can bury evidence she knows will weaken her case.
That way I can help you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bonnie can never know.<eos> I was just pre-gaming, you know, putting on the war paint, getting turnt up before the bonfire.<eos> That's when I realized the trophy was gone.<eos> A trophy Professor Keating gave to you.<eos> She awarded it to me.<eos> It's like the Stanley Cup of law school.<eos> Why did you think you'd find Michaela or the trophy at the Keating house?<eos> I figured she was turning it in to get out of the exam, which is a ballbuster, by the way, and right around the corner, so, my peeps, if we can hurry this up.
You said you'd protect us.<eos> - Aren't I?<eos> - How could we know?<eos> I mean, you...<eos> You only talk to us in code.<eos> You expect us to continue going to class and work your cases, even though nothing makes any sense anymore.<eos> I want to trust you.<eos> I do, but...<eos> Do you know why I gave you that trophy the first day?<eos> Not because you screwed your way to it, although...
Dashell?<eos> No, but wait.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> You're not librarians, are you?<eos> You saw Leonard's volcano...<eos> What happened to Tim, everybody else...<eos> All of the weird sicknesses and accidents.<eos> This is gonna sound crazy, but you have an app on your phone...<eos> I knew it.<eos> My mom gave it to me, but I didn't use it.

- No.<eos> - It's necessary.<eos> Sure?<eos> - No, never mind.<eos> - Have it your own.<eos> Shall I play?<eos> - Good.<eos> What's this?<eos> A list.<eos> I'm keeping it since the fifth grade.
Wanna hit Citibank?<eos> I knew we forgot something.<eos> We forgot it was too soon.<eos> I didn't hit a skunk.<eos> It was a black and white bucket.<eos> Then what was that smell?<eos> What the heck is this?<eos> _<eos> I can't read it.<eos> You can eat it.
- Hey, brother.<eos> - Hey, Kev.<eos> - How you doing today?<eos> - All right.<eos> That's a piece of work.<eos> You think there's any way you can tell me where this boat was built?<eos> Well, it's definitely been repurposed.<eos> Cobbled together from God knows where.<eos> Doubt it's local.<eos> Thanks for letting us tow it out here.
Yo, that's crazy. I love that.<eos> Lay that down for Dad, you're gonna be fine.<eos> I'll get the band to hook us up.<eos> Yes!<eos> Okay.<eos> The last time you called me this late, your brother had been murdered.<eos> You forgot me.<eos> I've been with you since the beginning, and you can't even give me a measly 25 large.<eos> That's 'cause you would lose it.<eos> If I gave you a million dollars, you'd give it away to some bookie.
Yeah.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> I don't know, Juliette.<eos> Is there?<eos> Hey.<eos> Listen, I'm so sorry about the other day.<eos> My album.<eos> It just needs artwork and a release date.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I look forward to listening to it, and then we can make those decisions together.
- Hey, listen.<eos> We gotta make a bit of an adjustment.<eos> Tiny and Jojo, they don't want to do the construction, so I was looking into what cults do to force people into labor when the mind tricks don't work, and one of them was a personality test, right?<eos> You basically just get a bunch of dirt on people and you hold it over their heads.<eos> So, blackmail.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So this is a basic personality test.<eos> It's really simple.<eos> It just measures the amount of guilt stressors that you're feeling.<eos> You know, I took it, and I just... it's changed my life.
- Kevin was in the car.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> My God.<eos> I've issued a description of Kevin and put out an order to detain him.<eos> He told me he was staying with his grandparents.<eos> We'll check the grandparents' house first.<eos> Is there any way you can prove the hamster belonged to him?<eos> No.<eos> We can't prove it belongs to him, but we may be able to place it in his possession.<eos> If we trim some of the fur and place it in an aliquot of water,
No, God, God no.<eos> I'm your friend bringing you a new friend, one with training in not collapsing roofs.<eos> Is she, excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Is she above us or below us?<eos> She is, woop!<eos> I'm getting a call, here, and I'll have to take it.<eos> Frankie, why don't you explain what your role will be, while I leave to take this call.<eos> My phone is vibrating, but it is In your office, which you didn't realize, when you started the fake phone call move.<eos> My phone is in my pocket, Jeffrey.<eos> Mm. I'm walking away, so I can get it out and answer it.
Abed.<eos> Hey, Annie.<eos> This place is so conceptual.<eos> It's practical, too.<eos> We made enough money to save Shirley's.<eos> And in an ironic way, because if Shirley saw this, her soul would die.<eos> Hey, Abed, check this out.<eos> Oh, Britta's still the worst?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The bar gets dirty. You're gonna need someone to clean it, probably after hours, and those floor polishers can get pretty loud.
Well, there's plenty of leftovers, Howard.<eos> Beer it is.<eos> Phone's dead, too.<eos> Mom!<eos> What, Max?<eos> There's a snowman in our yard.<eos> See?<eos> That's...<eos> That's great, Max.<eos> But who built it?
It's not the kids' fault if you don't go out.<eos> You think I wouldn't like to go out on my own too?<eos> Go, I don't know, to the theatre, see people?<eos> I'm never allowed out!<eos> I don't care, I won't say where I'm going!<eos> Frank said "excited". He's winding you up.<eos> If you'd like another drink...<eos> Call Sarah, see if Wolfgang's still sleeping.<eos> - Where's your phone?<eos> - I didn't bring it.
Are you scared?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Your mother is dying, and the world is on fire.<eos> If history teaches us one thing, it is this: terrible things happen to kings.<eos> You were anointed by God, blessed by the sun,<eos> but you do not yet possess what really matters:<eos> the power!<eos> Without it, you will perish, and all of France along with you.<eos> For a king without a castle is no king at all.<eos> And now, you dream of paradise, but you must build it for yourself.
You're gonna have to take it black.<eos> We're out of milk?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Why are you in that space blanket?<eos> You brought your cellphone in here last night.<eos> It was in your pants pocket.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Where, uh... where is it?<eos> Outside...<eos> I threw it out the door.
I mean, I don't have time for this.<eos> All...<eos> All right!<eos> Hey. I'm gonna...<eos> I'm gonna park right here.<eos> I don't think you want to be doing that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> You got a poop-filled diaper in there?<eos> Are you gonna throw it at me?
Andy, we can see movement on the balcony.<eos> Hey! Don't move!<eos> Okay!<eos> Okay, but -- uh, i'm gonna fall!<eos> Chris, gail, you got him?<eos> Gail: Yeah, we see him.<eos> We got him. So, then, fall.<eos> I used to live there.<eos> My ex locked me out. I was just trying to get my laptop back.<eos> She said she was gonna sell it to pay her rent.

I was just trying to get my laptop back.<eos> She said she was gonna sell it to pay her rent.<eos> So, what, you were sneaking in to get it back?
I don't know. I'm gonna give them a call.<eos> [Police radio chatter] Andy, what do you got?<eos> Gas-station manager said that this employee closed early last night and did not show up this morning.<eos> - Yeah? - Connor Frye, 21.<eos> Okay, were there security cameras?<eos> No, but he has a record... uh, car theft and a couple minor BEs.<eos> That's it?<eos> This is Connor Frye's juvenile record.<eos> It was expunged.<eos> So, what, you un-expunged it?
- No, he goes for days.<eos> He likes the open road...<eos> Just like his deadbeat father.<eos> All right, let's, uh...<eos> That's his tarantula.<eos> W-where... where is it?<eos> Look, I know I'm supposed to tell you he's a good boy.<eos> But he's not.<eos> Maybe jail would straighten him out.<eos> God knows I can't. You think it got out, or he he just took it with him?
- [applause]<eos> - Yes! Thanks.<eos> All right. Okay.<eos> Come on, Diaz!<eos> Come on, Diaz!<eos> For your future! For your future!<eos> DIAZ: Gimme that golden arm!<eos> Come on!<eos> - Here we go. - Whoo!<eos> Better hit it now. Better hit it now.
She was using the knife to separate it.<eos> I do it all the time 'cause I live alone.<eos> Well, you don't say.<eos> I'm constantly forgetting to put the chicken out the night before, so it's always rock-solid, so I have to use the knife to wedge it apart.<eos> It's actually really dangerous, which is why...<eos> Which is why what? What?<eos> Which is why I use a hammer to pound on the end of the knife.<eos> She was... she was... she was carrying the hammer.<eos> That's why her prints are all over it.<eos> And she was bringing it back downstairs.
Nothing.<eos> And he took a chance on me.<eos> And then I let him down.<eos> Now I'm coming to you, like this.<eos> It's okay, Carlos.<eos> We should talk about the charges against you.<eos> I pulled your file.<eos> The prosecution is not going to make this easy.<eos> They're charging you with larceny, robbery, and the knife makes this aggravated assault.<eos> I had the knife on me, but I didn't use it.
You know, I don't want to tell you how to do your job, but when a mouse completes a maze, it gets a food pellet.<eos> It also gets its brain plucked out with tweezers.<eos> And his last meal was a food pellet?<eos> You're a monster.<eos> All right, next, we're gonna introduce an anxiety-inducing stimulus, measure your stress levels and see how it affects your problem-solving rate.<eos> Very well.<eos> And good luck-- I'm a pretty laid-back guy.<eos> Ready?<eos> Begin.<eos> Why'd you pop it?
You're not messing with me?<eos> Not at all.<eos> In fact, I have got something for just such an occasion.<eos> I was starting to think I might never get a chance to give it to you.<eos> Good job.<eos> You're giving me a sticker?<eos> Not just a sticker.<eos> That is a sticker of a kitty saying, "Me-wow!"<eos> I'm not a preschooler.<eos> Fine, I'll take it back.
Well, we did it.<eos> Yes, we did, my friend.<eos> Is your tongue blue?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Okay, movie night-- what do you want to watch?<eos> Whatever happened to that ape movie you were in?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Probably nothing.<eos> I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.<eos> Search for it.
I think I saw the director twirling a sign outside the Verizon store.<eos> Search for it.<eos> Wha... no.<eos> No!<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause it would be fun to watch.<eos> It would be humiliating.<eos> Well, now we have two reasons.<eos> They have it.<eos> Please, can we watch it?
"And while you hide behind your anonymity, "we stand behind our paper.<eos> And later tonight, your mother".<eos> And you don't think that's too rough?<eos> We're just standing behind her.<eos> It's not like we're gonna say "boo" and scare her.<eos> How could you not tell us you were in beauty pageants?<eos> 'Cause it's embarrassing.<eos> It is; it truly is.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Amy writes Little House on the Prairie fan fiction about herself and posts it on the Internet.
We used the coordinates to locate the cities.<eos> I'm putting the city names in the grid now.<eos> I'm sure that'll give us the code to the safe.<eos> Solve puzzle too fast!<eos> Slow down!<eos> Yup!<eos> Got the code.<eos> Just saying... no refund for finish early!<eos> Sure you don't want to go home?<eos> When the bag's returned, they'll deliver it to us.
We're not selling it-- it's mine.<eos> You can't just decide.<eos> How about I arm-wrestle you?<eos> That's not fair.<eos> It's like me challenging you to a sexy pants contest.<eos> You could play Ping-Pong for it.<eos> I would do that.<eos> How is that fair?<eos> You grew up with a table.<eos> Yes, but I mostly used it as a battlefield in an ongoing war between the Transformers and the ThunderCats for control of a bra I had found in the woods.
Earlier today, it was pointed out to me that I tend to force my ideas on people.<eos> You're really not gonna tell me?<eos> No, that train has left the station.<eos> Now, we can play this one of two ways.<eos> You can say, "Trains, tell me more,"<eos> or... you can just look at me like that and I'll start.<eos> What's going on in here?<eos> I am making molecular cocktails.<eos> This sphere is actually a cosmopolitan.<eos> How do you drink it?
But, Daddy, I-I miss my family so much, and with you and Mummy getting a divorce, I feel sad and empty.<eos> Buying a little toy every now and then helps me fill that void.<eos> So while I can't hug you every day, flying that helicopter...<eos> I'm cutting you off.<eos> Just to be clear, financially or mid-sentence?<eos> No red and yellow, no red and yellow.<eos> Yay!<eos> It's green!<eos> We did it!<eos> Oh! God, if it's this much fun to rotate, imagine when we fly it.

I have to return the helicopter.<eos> My father...<eos> What did you do?<eos> !<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> He went to MIT.<eos> He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.<eos> I don't freaking believe this!<eos> Relax, it'll be fine.<eos> No, you have to put this back together right now, so I can return it!
She says you should go visit her when you're feeling better.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> You know you're still a dick, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever.<eos> What's that?<eos> There's your clothes from the party.<eos> There's no money in the wallet.<eos> But that's how I found it.
She loves you fiercely, and ye have her worried sick.<eos> Tell me what I can do to help.<eos> Jamie.<eos> Yer blade.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> And what would ye be needing it for?<eos> To put me out of this black misery.<eos> Jamie, ye don't mean it.<eos> It's not a matter I wish to discuss.<eos> - Now hand it over.
It was someone on her team. You know?<eos> I mean, hey, just took some elbow grease and clean living...<eos> People noticed.<eos> I knew you had it in you.<eos> I don't see the journal here.<eos> - Right. Here you go.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Albuquerque journal... it's not here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't see it outside.
I knew you had it in you.<eos> I don't see the journal here.<eos> - Right. Here you go.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Albuquerque journal... it's not here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't see it outside.<eos> Wasn't out there?<eos> It's always out there.<eos> I didn't see it.
I don't see the journal here.<eos> - Right. Here you go.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Albuquerque journal... it's not here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't see it outside.<eos> Wasn't out there?<eos> It's always out there.<eos> I didn't see it.<eos> Maybe they forgot to deliver it.
Oh, here's your coffee.<eos> Hope it's good to the last drop because I'm billing you the full hour for it.<eos> That's for you.<eos> Oh, that's very thoughtful.<eos> You serious? Why'd you have me bring it to you?<eos> All right, here's what's gonna happen:<eos> Those two cops out there are from Philadelphia.<eos> They've come a long way to see me.<eos> When they come in here, we're all gonna have a little chat.<eos> When it's over, the young one who's been writing in his little notebook he's gonna take it and put it in his jacket, and when he does that I want you to take that coffee and spill it on him.
It seems like a good job for a ginger.<eos> Ser Alliser.<eos> You have more experience than any other ranger at Castle Black.<eos> You proved your valour many times over by defending the Wall from the wildling attack.<eos> I name you First Ranger.<eos> Lord Janos.<eos> I'm giving you command of Greyguard.<eos> Greyguard is a ruin.<eos> Yes, the fort is in a sorry state.<eos> Restore it as best you can.
I'm so sorry, my queen.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> "Barristan the Bold" they called him.<eos> He crossed a continent to serve me.<eos> He was a loyal friend.<eos> And he died in an alley, butchered by cowards who hide behind masks.<eos> We could pull back to the pyramid district, secure it, and use it as a base from which to operate.
Sons of high lords, sons of fishermen.<eos> If you break his laws, you will be punished.<eos> Don't you walk away from me.<eos> You don't give commands here, Lady Olenna.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> Gold?<eos> I'll make you the richest septon who ever lived.<eos> What, then?<eos> I imagine this is strange for you.<eos> Everyone you meet has a hidden motive and you pride yourself on sniffing it out.
David Beckham's gay.<eos> Harry Judd is gay.<eos> Ryan Reynolds, he's gay.<eos> - You wish!<eos> - No.<eos> Just listen.<eos> - I haven't heard this for years. - Do Ryan Reynolds!<eos> OK.<eos> I know for a fact that Ryan Reynolds is gay, cos there is nothing Ryan Reynolds loves more... than cock.<eos> He's got his very own cock, and he loves it.
Just listen.<eos> - I haven't heard this for years. - Do Ryan Reynolds!<eos> OK.<eos> I know for a fact that Ryan Reynolds is gay, cos there is nothing Ryan Reynolds loves more... than cock.<eos> He's got his very own cock, and he loves it.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Ryan Reynolds is filming some movie, he's far away from home, he's in some hotel and he gets back to his room...<eos> He's hot... he's fit he's got a hard-on and it's packed into the denim, he's trapped in his jeans.<eos> Maybe there's a mirror.<eos> He's looking in the mirror as he heaves it out, he's got his jeans around his knees and he's looking in the mirror and he loves it, he loves what he sees, cos he holds his cock and he wanks it, and he loves it.
With the both of us, and then<eos> - you can stay the night.<eos> - Lance, we should stop!<eos> There's a man in my house.<eos> - There's no need to hurt him! - Aaah!<eos> Can I stay?<eos> Every happy couple has a secret.<eos> They try to ignore it, they turn a blind eye, but every happy couple is in danger, because every happy couple has a mobile phone.<eos> I've invented a test.<eos> I call it the Henry test.
I think, given the unfortunate events of that night, my client simply wishes to ask about the timeline.<eos> Who said what, when.<eos> Just for clarification.<eos> Of course.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Shoona?<eos> Would you... ?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> I know this is difficult, but, um... we've established the events of the afternoon, when you gave that file to my husband, Mr Best.<eos> I think you could argue that he took it with the intent to steal, and, um... I'm sorry for that.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I'm not sleeping with them.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't even sleep with me!<eos> Do you know what, Lance?<eos> If you know me so well, do you know what I really think?<eos> Do you know what I think all day long, every single day, right down deep in my heart?<eos> I think there's got to be one more cock!<eos> Out there!<eos> Just one more cock, for me, and I'm in danger of missing it!
Do you know what I think all day long, every single day, right down deep in my heart?<eos> I think there's got to be one more cock!<eos> Out there!<eos> Just one more cock, for me, and I'm in danger of missing it!<eos> And I love you, Lance.<eos> I do. You're very nice.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But do you know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go out there and find it.
It's just, I forgot... last time we talked.<eos> I left something out.<eos> I love you.<eos> That was it.<eos> I've had this song in my head all day this earworm, going round and round some stupid old Eurovision song.<eos> It's not even like I'm one of those idiots who likes Eurovision.<eos> But it's stuck.<eos> It won't stop.<eos> Nice bread.<eos> I got it from that shop.
- I want to fuck you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Can I fuck you? - Not like this.<eos> Will you fuck me?<eos> Is that what you want?<eos> Will you fuck me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> One day.<eos> Will you fuck my arse?<eos> Will you fuck it hard?
So, what are you doing these days?<eos> Things.<eos> How are you doing there, Henry?<eos> Are we looking after you?<eos> - Yes, all good, thanks. Hello.<eos> - How's the project?<eos> - What was that?<eos> - You had to do a project, you worked late, you had to get it finished by the weekend?<eos> Oh, the schedule, I did it, yes!<eos> I won, I beat it!
I got her a gift.<eos> A pair of hair pins with horses on them.<eos> - I don't know if she'll like it.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> She'll love them.<eos> Especially since they're from you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> [laughs] What, are you not a fan of cilantro?<eos> Yeah, I don't really like it.
They each have a nanny? Yes.<eos> I know you want a quesadilla.<eos> You said you were starving.<eos> Well, Yohania, she's got enough to do.<eos> - She's not a slave.<eos> She's a nanny.<eos> - Right.<eos> Dad, are you locking the wine fridge because Lip is here?<eos> - Please, don't pick a fight.<eos> - Well, he never locks it.
All right. The top four answers are on the board.<eos> We asked a hundred people on the street,<eos> "Name something people groom themselves with."<eos> Dennis!<eos> Laser beams, Grant.<eos> - La-Laser beams? - Yeah, laser beam.<eos> It's the only way to completely obliterate the follicle.<eos> Show me laser beam!<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah. That noise, it's too loud.<eos> Can we, can we just turn it down a touch?
- I guess that's just... I put all these expectations on myself to be funny all the time.<eos> You know? Because that's what people have come to expect from me.<eos> But that's not fair. It's too much pressure for me.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> No, I don't think anyone expects that at all.<eos> Wait, what about you? What do you want to do?<eos> Okay, uh, well, I would like to get a chicken sandwich, but, - uh, but I think I want to get the beak on the side?<eos> - Mm. Frank's always making me eat it first and frankly I'd rather it last if I'm gonna have to eat it all...<eos> Ooh, I can help you here.<eos> Instead of eating it last, you don't have to eat beak at all.
There was nothing unusual at that house?<eos> Nothing, except there was orange paint all over the porch.<eos> He was painting before he got here.<eos> He was stoked about finding some headboard in the garbage this morning.<eos> Well, that's weird.<eos> I talked to a guy who mentioned finding a, uh, an old bar sign this morning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Doesn't seem like the kind of neighborhood where people are just throwing out old furniture onto the street.<eos> Maybe somebody had something out for pickup, like a junk collector or charity pickup or something.<eos> Then that would mean that there was a van in that neighborhood today, and I want to know who was driving it.
It's not glamorous.<eos> I know.<eos> You know how I kicked your ass at that partner game?<eos> No, you didn't kick my ass.<eos> Yeah, well, um... We both agree I buy the better gifts.<eos> And you know what... before this whole mess started, I bought you the perfect gift at the dollar store.<eos> It's right in that glove box.<eos> You go... go for it.<eos> Get in there.<eos> [Laughs] Ohh. Where did you find it?
How are we handling the brother?<eos> Well, initially we're only telling him about the murder of his neighbor across the street.<eos> Um... listen.<eos> Since Oderno's already started this case, maybe we should re-think having Julio back today.<eos> What?<eos> There's no need to re-think anything, Andy.<eos> Oderno started on this case, and he should finish it out.<eos> Yes, Mike?<eos> Uh, casings confirm Lisa Lewis and Gary Erwin were shot with the same gun.<eos> Any hope of finding it?
- Do you mind?<eos> I'm trying to do something.<eos> - What?<eos> Use a different wall.<eos> I couldn't hear you over the noise of the ball.<eos> Fine, then make me the goalie.<eos> Saved!<eos> Now the goal's smaller.<eos> Is this how you treat your home?<eos> Do you want to destroy it?
Where's the money?<eos> You spent it.<eos> - Put it in my room.<eos> - Bring that hunk of junk here now.<eos> - They paid with an engine.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> I warned you not to buy anything.<eos> It's not bullshit.<eos> I'll pay you next week.<eos> Give us more scrap metal I'll sell it at the junkyard again.
We'll leave.<eos> We didn't know this was private property.<eos> No, no. you're coming with me.<eos> We can leave now, we'll go.<eos> No way.<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> So you say this house can walk?<eos> - It has wheels and an engine?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Where did you find it?

Return the ball and you two can leave.<eos> No.<eos> Where's the guarantee?<eos> Once they get their ball back, they'll finish us.<eos> No, we'll step back 30 meters.<eos> You'll do the same.<eos> That's 70 meters.<eos> - Actually, that's 60 meters.<eos> - I mean, er, 60 meters.<eos> You'll put the ball on the ground, so that when we pick it up, you'll be far away.
Morgan Le Fay warned me something was coming.<eos> The loom of fate!<eos> I saw Dulaque cut the threads.<eos> Dulaque's dead.<eos> I killed him after he killed you.<eos> Taking the library was one thing, but Cassandra... when Excalibur healed her, I knew that she was the chosen one.<eos> In my timeline, when Dulaque cut the fabric of the loom, he wanted to go back to when Camelot was around.<eos> How would that even work?<eos> Uh, well, the loom of fate just spits out history.<eos> So if you cut it...
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will?<eos> You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.<eos> It feels clean and pure, like a...<eos> fresh start or a beginning.<eos> For others, it's frightening.<eos> Cold and silent and... isolating.<eos> What are you thinking about when you look at the snow?<eos> That I'm gonna have to shovel it.
as a souvenir.<eos> That's all it's good for, now.<eos> Hello?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Okay.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I need to speak to the president.<eos> Through our laws, we seek to create a more perfect union.<eos> Government officials who abuse the law, or, at the very least, exploit the edges of it for their own personal gain, tarnish our democracy and weaken the bonds of our great nation.
Security room's in the fourth floor.<eos> I'm sure they've already pulled the tapes In light of the attack last night.<eos> What attack?<eos> Stop.<eos> This guy is trained.<eos> Possibly military.<eos> We should get the sketch to the various services, See if we get a hit.<eos> Agent Bennigan.<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Now, you've been holding up protocol on the sketch Ever since you saw it, and now...
Okay. Looking good.<eos> We're just going for a little ride.<eos> Here. Let me get that for you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - Just a sec.<eos> - Oh, crap. - What is it?<eos> I must have left my stupid phone on last night.<eos> It's dead.<eos> Well, could you put it in the trunk?
- Oh, crap. - What is it?<eos> I must have left my stupid phone on last night.<eos> It's dead.<eos> Well, could you put it in the trunk?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That everyone?<eos> They'll be here in one minute.<eos> Anyone still have a phone, add it to the collection now.
The whole lobby of HHM applauding for you.<eos> They love you.<eos> Now, you threaten to pull out, Hamlin would be insane to screw with you.<eos> You've got the nuclear option.<eos> Launch the doomsday device.<eos> Game over.<eos> If working with me is what you really want, right, Chuck?<eos> You called him.<eos> You called Hamlin.<eos> I always turn my phone off before I put it in your mailbox.

Because I always do.
Battery drained.<eos> I was so damn sure that I turned it off, you know. Because I always do.<eos> It's a habit, right?<eos> So it was nagging me.<eos> It was nagging me.<eos> So I called the phone company.<eos> Turns out... there was a deleted call at 2 a.m. when I was asleep right there.<eos> And you know whose number?<eos> Hamlin's.<eos> The only person who could have made that call and deleted it is you, Chuck.
The rocket blew up on launch.<eos> So Aaron owed $12 million to the Swedish government and his inability to come up with the funds led him into a pit of despair, AKA, PCP.<eos> Nobody wants to end up in prison.<eos> But if you do end up in prison, Swedish prison's the way to go.<eos> It's a lot like living in a very modern home with mid-century finishes.<eos> And once again, people assumed that was the last they would ever hear of Aaron Williams.<eos> So, Charles, you're now number two in the world.<eos> You're favored to win Wimbledon, which would make you number one.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Yeah, well, when I'm playing I serve the ball and the man opposite me on the other side of the court, he plays it back to me.

Hey, do you know where I can plug this in?<eos> You want to plug a USB connector into a 1969 computer?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> But I think I can fix the...<eos> Yes.<eos> I need to establish a connection through any of the NASA guidance systems in the world. You got that?<eos> Let's go home, sweetie.<eos> You'll be my personal trophy.<eos> He has the flag!<eos> Let's get it back.
I love being generous.<eos> No, wait!<eos> It's all over.<eos> No, we can't give up now.<eos> There's nothing else we can do.<eos> Time's up!<eos> We accept your deal.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Bring me the flag.<eos> I found it!
Not job interviews. Um...<eos> Working here has sort of inspired me to do more in law enforcement.<eos> - Uh-huh. - So I applied to law school.<eos> - What? ! - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Took the LSATs. - Wow, that's... that's fantastic.<eos> Good for you.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Nice.<eos> Why did you want to see Milt's record?<eos> And why did you only glance at it?
I'm sorry, Juliette, I-I got to go. O... okay.<eos> Yeah, we'll talk about this later, okay?<eos> Love you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just wanted you to hear one good pass with the slide, without all the noodling, just so you could get a good listen to...<eos> - [music stops] - I'm not using the damn slide.<eos> You're not even listening to the damn slide, Avery! Yes, I'm listening to it.<eos> No, you're not!<eos> - I heard it when you first came up with it, when you insisted on tracking it.<eos> Now you're shoving it down my throat!
Right.<eos> Oh!<eos> Man, yeah.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Look.<eos> I'm pulling a track from my record, "Good Woman."<eos> I'm looking to replace it with something a little more accurate, seeing as the person it was written for was not all that good to me.
- Previously on "Nashville"...<eos> - You've been served.<eos> My recommendation is that we make a settlement offer.<eos> I hate that idea.<eos> I filed a restraining order, but he just figured out a way around it.
But, you know, I think it's a real vote of confidence that Rayna believes in me and my music.<eos> Uh, I'm sorry, but I actually just remembered that I have to go meet some friends, so y'all have a great night.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - Okay. Bye.<eos> Oh, hey!<eos> Bucky.<eos> We were just talking to Layla about her new single.<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> - Her new single?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I downloaded it this morning.

- [Singsongy] Where's my baby brother?<eos> ! - Hey, Beverly.<eos> - I got liver cancer.<eos> - He needs a liver transplant.<eos> The answer is "no."<eos> The F.B.I. does have you under surveillance.<eos> I could disappear for a while, but I'd need money.<eos> I hope that wherever you go, you can start over.<eos> - You promised me immunity.<eos> - You'll get it.
The wizard got sick, so they gave us the rest of the show off.<eos> You didn't even stay, did you?<eos> Baby, I couldn't take it.<eos> There was so much singing.<eos> I think I know why that is.<eos> Because it's a freakin' musical!<eos> But they don't have to sing every little thing!<eos> They're like... ♪ I'm going to the door ♪<eos> ♪ This is how is feel ♪ Will you at least listen to the soundtrack?<eos> I put it on your phone.
That he was involved in the murders of the consul and the reporter.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Rashid is not a killer.<eos> He was not the only one who was nervous.<eos> I was nervous, too, be...<eos> Because of what happened to the contract.<eos> The contract with Navilet?<eos> What happened to it?<eos> Rashid came to the office to pick it up.
What?<eos> No.<eos> Rashid is not a killer.<eos> He was not the only one who was nervous.<eos> I was nervous, too, be...<eos> Because of what happened to the contract.<eos> The contract with Navilet?<eos> What happened to it?<eos> Rashid came to the office to pick it up.<eos> He was supposed to deliver it to the drug company.
Who recommended him?<eos> Miss Webb.<eos> Don't cause trouble, Mama.<eos> For the first time, it's actually working between us and the Selfridge's.<eos> And if Harry thinks you're snooping, it will ruin everything.<eos> Leave well alone.<eos> The vote is defeated.<eos> Seven votes to two.<eos> I gave you all a chance.<eos> But you are too wet to take it.
And it was musty.<eos> And it was hot.<eos> Not Florida hot.<eos> Like, fire in my face hot.<eos> That's really great, Beth.<eos> What else?<eos> Banging.<eos> Like someone hammering on a furnace.<eos> And I think... there was something about like a... a shield?<eos> I think she was giving it to someone. Trick:
The Aegis Shield.<eos> This is Hephaestus.<eos> Or Hepha.<eos> I think I just Hepha'd my lunch.<eos> He's the son of Zeus and Hera.<eos> He's he forger of weaponry and armour for the Ancients.<eos> But why would Zee relinquish her shield?<eos> It was her protection.<eos> Hephaestus only grants one weapon per god.<eos> Zeus could be trading it in for something stronger.
Our servants demand exorbitant wages and seem to have lost all sense of place.<eos> We have former soldiers, unemployed, falling into lives of poverty and crime.<eos> We have women who want to vote and work... .. forsaking the duties of hearth and home.<eos> So... .. I give you the Loxley Charitable Foundation for Former Servicemen.<eos> We should help them take their place in society again, these brave men...<eos> .. who gave their all for King and Country... .. who have returned to a world turned upside down.<eos> Let us bring them out of the shadows... .. and into the light.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is the handwriting at all familiar?<eos> I don't recognize it.
I recognized it as soon as I saw it.<eos> It's my family's.<eos> My dad popped the top off a jar with it when I was eight and broke the handle.<eos> - There's a chunk missing right in the center.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How do you know what this knife looks like?<eos> Because I've used it.<eos> Many times.<eos> It's from my family's cabin.<eos> When I saw it, I froze.
- There's a chunk missing right in the center.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How do you know what this knife looks like?<eos> Because I've used it.<eos> Many times.<eos> It's from my family's cabin.<eos> When I saw it, I froze.<eos> A million things went through my head.<eos> And for a moment I forgot I was a cop, so I didn't know what to do.<eos> - I just left it there.
I couldn't do it.<eos> What do you mean you couldn't do it?<eos> I felt like I was being followed.<eos> I drove to the lake and when I got there, I...<eos> I just couldn't do it.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll do it then.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> As long as that knife exists,<eos> "A" is gonna find a way to get it back.
I'm Jonny.<eos> Raymond.<eos> You're...<eos> Spencer Hastings.<eos> The sister who hasn't checked out yet.<eos> I'm psyched about the space.<eos> I don't think that you really should be.<eos> You don't want to live in our backyard.<eos> Why?<eos> Because somebody was buried in it.
Keep hitting me.<eos> Let's see who drops first.<eos> Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Go in through here, right above the eye.<eos> That's the supraorbital foramen.<eos> You want to go in right under there.<eos> Hold still.<eos> I might do some serious damage if you squirm.<eos> How will I know when I find it?
It would be helpful if we could see the cipher machine.<eos> At the square.<eos> You don't trust us.<eos> I have no reason.<eos> Musketeers are men of honour.<eos> The King of Spain swore he loved me, then had me arrested on false charges.<eos> He was a man of honour too.<eos> I don't trust Alaman.<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> We promised them the cipher and we don't even have it.

Your leeches have done their work?<eos> As a man of science, I must conclude that it was the steam, and not I, that saved his life.<eos> Madame Bonacieux should receive the credit.<eos> Ah. Well, then, I suppose we had better not hang her.<eos> Perhaps you were right this time, Madame.<eos> But I assure you, leeches are generally an infallible cure.<eos> I wanted that gunpowder, Treville.<eos> Now the machine is destroyed,<eos> Alaman is dead and the secret is lost forever.<eos> But at least the Spanish do not have it either, Sire.
Your ears?<eos> Your toes?<eos> 'Cause you didn't cover up your bell-end?<eos> You want to be answering to the name of Daddy?<eos> Coupled off to some mistake with a face like a bulldog chewing a wasp?<eos> Now I know what you're thinking.<eos> But pulling out of her cave at the last second and painting her belly won't save you.<eos> All the docs say so.<eos> There's only one way to go here, fellas, and it's right here in my hand.<eos> Don't slip it in till you slip it on.
Daddy.<eos> Please.<eos> - Don't make it worse.<eos> Please.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> - You know what you earned yourself.<eos> The Polish doctor discovered the gland secretion existed.<eos> Doc at Johns Hopkins thought he'd crystalized it, but turned out he had only isolated a benzoyl derivative. Then this Japanese fellow on 103rd Street, he crystalized it for real.<eos> Genius.<eos> No, the genius was that he patented it. He's the one who called it adrenaline.
Well, let's go next door so I can perform a proper examination.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> At least allow me to look at your stool.<eos> Not even if you went up there and got it yourself.<eos> It's a fine house, Mr. Barrow.<eos> I can think of any number of prospective buyers to show it to at your convenience, of course.<eos> To be honest with you, Mr. Stern, I currently find myself in a bit of financial distress.<eos> Consequently, I haven't time to show the house publically.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How do you intend to sell it?
He didn't tell me his name, but he told me all about the new house and the remarkably modern vacuum system.<eos> 74th Street.<eos> How stylish.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, Herman, who is he?<eos> He's an architect.<eos> Formerly in my employ.<eos> When were you planning on telling me?<eos> I suppose now is as good a time as any.<eos> Maybe we can drive round and see it after dinner. No.
An anonymous letter, a word to the hospital board about the way I've conducted my business dealings.<eos> I think you now have a good idea of the price you'll pay for any and all indiscretions.<eos> Today you're only swallowing a few teeth, tomorrow it could be much worse.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> You want to try that again?<eos> I understand.<eos> Very good.<eos> This is the last place I expected to see you today.<eos> Seems I missed one minstrel show at the ball. Couldn't pass up the opportunity to see another.<eos> Now that I've made the transverse elliptical incision around the hernia and the umbilicus, I will now deepen it to the base of the hernia intrusion.
She was gone for an hour, but Wanda wouldn't do it.<eos> I know it.<eos> Again, I ask...<eos> Wanda, where were you?<eos> I don't want to say.<eos> You poisoned Shelby.<eos> I didn't!<eos> Then where were you?<eos> Laszlo ate Shelby's costume;<eos> I had to go fix it.
Nothing's going on.<eos> Are those Cheese Flavies?<eos> Oh, can I have some?<eos> My fetus goes gaga for Cheese Flavies.<eos> I'm gonna need that back for studying.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Rose: I saw Rudy take a package into Shelby's dressing room.<eos> (murmuring) What was in the package?<eos> It was dry ice for our act.<eos> We were storing it in Shelby's fridge.
Shelby tells me your act is really shaping up.<eos> I think it is so brave of you two, forging ahead with a song that's clearly arranged as a trio.<eos> Especially with all the money for Fancie's on the line.<eos> Well, that's us.<eos> Very, very brave.<eos> Lemon, I don't want to see you lose your restaurant and all your hopes and your dreams along with it.<eos> So... I have come up with a solution.<eos> You're dropping out of the contest?<eos> (laughs): No, silly.<eos> I'm gonna take my prize money and the savings from selling Fancie's last year and buy it back!
Take it.<eos> ♪ We can't undo it... ♪ You thought you were in love with Lemon? (laughs)<eos> Oh, really? This coming from the girl that's about to marry to Scooter McGreevy?<eos> The heart is a mysterious thing.<eos> (laughs) It is.<eos> It is, but I have learned... a valuable lesson here.<eos> And that is that I need to push myself outside my comfort zone.<eos> I have faith in you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Now, listen, Wanda, if the goat means that much to you, - we can keep it.
I am loving that shirt on you! (whoops)<eos> What do you want?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I am just super-excited about your shirt.<eos> And all the awesome doctoring I'm going to do today.<eos> Well, great, 'cause I'm going out now, and good luck holding down the fort.<eos> Lavon.<eos> Zoe: Oh, I'm gonna hold down this fort.<eos> The fort's not gonna know what... held it.
Oh, no.<eos> Make sure he wears his suit.<eos> His seersucker suit.<eos> - It's not important anymore.<eos> - Morn wants him to.<eos> Yes, please, the suit.<eos> Thank you, Meg.<eos> Do you have it?<eos> No.<eos> He must have taken it with him.
It's not possible.<eos> I agree.<eos> Detective Agnew.<eos> Detective?<eos> What?<eos> Come on, we're up.<eos> - What?<eos> - We're up.<eos> Come on.<eos> All right, if you see a gun, you stop and... You don't touch it and... You leave the area... and...
Or to confess.<eos> Especially now he knows that his niece isn't going to rat on him.<eos> You are pathetic.<eos> We know you took the heroin<eos> - out of the evidence vault.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> - Commander, I already told...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> We know you took it, but we can't prove it.
Yeah, Donna, and then they-- they rolled the dice.<eos> Well, what about now?<eos> Are those trains still messed up?<eos> Because that would make them monsters.<eos> They are monsters, but that would also make them idiots, and they're not idiots.<eos> Well, what are you talking about?<eos> Well, they must have fixed the sensors by now; otherwise if it happened again, they'd all go to jail.<eos> Well, if they fixed the sensors, then there has to be - a paper trail.<eos> - Of course there is.<eos> Then all you have to do is get it.
Then, once I'd learned the basics, the only things left on the trolleys were travel books.<eos> But, that's all I had for 18 months.<eos> Then when I got my first GCSE, the staff bought me this atlas of the world.<eos> It was literally nearly as big as me.<eos> Didn't sprout up till I was 17.<eos> I couldn't have my plastic surgery till that happened so... that's the place where I stayed the longest.<eos> They weren't allowed to write any dedications in it.<eos> Now, I wish they would have.<eos> But, if they would have,<eos> I wouldn't have been able to take it everywhere with me, which I have.
It's like working at a landfill.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Ian stole a baby.<eos> Uh, who's Ian?<eos> My brother. I told you about him.<eos> Oh, right, the one who's in college.<eos> No, no, no, the one that ran away and joined the army.<eos> Wait, now... and he stole a baby?<eos> Well, he more, like, borrowed it.
You mean Raja went to Georgetown with you?<eos> Yeah, he was that kind of cokehead that never paid for it himself.<eos> Cheap bastard owes me.<eos> He did a lot of coke.<eos> Lot. - I never did it, you know.<eos> - Of course not, sir.<eos> Can I offer you and your men any pistachios?<eos> A fax was sent from this house. A fax that could greatly jeopardize Pakistan.<eos> You don't say.<eos> If you do not tell me who sent it, you will all be arrested and charged with treason.
You mark that?<eos> Chase that and we'll hope to catch copper.<eos> Judas!<eos> I can hear 'ee kickin' up a dido three mile away!<eos> ~ 'Tis this great buffle 'ead!<eos> ~ Hush yer creenin', woman!<eos> You'd think cheese wouldn't choke 'ee!<eos> Be she who started it!<eos> Mr Ross's rum again?<eos> He won't miss it!
Haven't we, Demelza?<eos> Yes, Ross.<eos> It's a quiet house since father died.<eos> Though Elizabeth plays the harp and speaks French to Geoffrey Charles.<eos> And I have my needlework.<eos> Aunt Agatha her spinning.<eos> ~ And Francis?<eos> ~ Is... .. often away.<eos> This pie is delicious, my dear.<eos> Did you bake it yourself?
Choake sold his shares in Leisure.<eos> To whom?<eos> (Oh, damn!<eos> )<eos> ~ Your health and prosperity, Ross!<eos> ~ And yours, George, particularly in the light of your recent acquisition.<eos> Ah, my shares in Wheal Leisure?<eos> You must take that as a compliment.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> Clearly you know a fine investment when you see it!
"And then, upon taking my position at the rear of the establishment, I heard gunfire."<eos> Lieutenant Backstrom?<eos> Yes, madam chairperson.<eos> You're simply reading from your statement.<eos> That's because my statement is what happened.<eos> The veracity of your statement is exactly what this committee is questioning, so we'd prefer if you put it aside and answered our questions.
- Trust me.<eos> This is where I bring all the truly special birds.<eos> When a woman lets your cucumber slip slowly through her fingers into a lukewarm vinegar bath, you're bonded for life.<eos> Well, she does like cucumbers...<eos> - Who doesn't?<eos> - But I don't know.<eos> Come on.<eos> Pickle my cucumber and see for yourself.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on, take it.
Your maybe-baby with my mother was not my secret to tell.<eos> How could she keep this from me?<eos> Because she knows you can't handle it.<eos> You're not man enough.<eos> Would you stop saying that?<eos> I'm man enough.<eos> - And I'm gonna prove it.<eos> - How are you going to do that? By raising this child as my own.<eos> It is your own.<eos> Which is why I'm gonna raise it as such. Not unless I raise it first.
What are you doing?<eos> Everyone's looking for you.<eos> It's your party, you know.<eos> I know, I just needed a breather.<eos> You got a mix tape?<eos> That's an awesome present.<eos> What's on it?<eos> You know, just the usual stuff.<eos> I've got the best present for you.<eos> I'm not gonna give it to you yet, though.
She looks 16, right?<eos> Did you engage in coitus with Talia?<eos> M-maybe.<eos> Coitus is sexual intercourse.<eos> That's when you put your penis inside...<eos> - Oh, my.<eos> - Okay, no, no, no.<eos> I did not have sexual intercourse with Talia.<eos> I've... never had sexual intercourse with anyone.<eos> I-if there's, like, a test for that, I will gladly take it for proof.
Take off your hoodie.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Take off your damn hoodie.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Her cellphone bill...<eos> you pay it or she does?<eos> - I do.<eos> - I'd like to take it.
- John!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Monsoon!<eos> Monsoon!<eos> This is Reclamation Agent John Jaqobis.<eos> I'm staring at a warrant for 200 crates of primo Qreshi sea salt that magically got up and walked into your hold.<eos> So what say you throttle down and we see if we can't turn that cargo back towards Westerley.<eos> Killjoy!<eos> You think you can slow me down back there?<eos> You can take your warrant and shove it where the air ain't sweet.
I just wanted to make sure we talked it through properly.<eos> - Do you have vegetarian pho?<eos> - Yes, tofu.<eos> - So, it has a vegetarian stock.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Um, just... there's no meat in the stock?<eos> - No meat.<eos> - I'll have that then.<eos> You really didn't trust there was vegetarian pho.<eos> Yeah, well, sometimes they bring it out in chicken stock.
We had ice cream.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> I know people like you.<eos> You think you're better than the rest of us.<eos> Not better or worse, just different.<eos> You got a smart mouth.<eos> Only if one assumes that a master's in economics constitutes a smart mouth, as opposed to educated.<eos> Many educated people are quite stupid, and many stupid people like to start fights for no good reason on a truly beautiful day.<eos> Let us not ruin it.
There's gotta be a point where self-defense is justified.<eos> Tracy killed her own father.<eos> And Lucas would have killed you.<eos> They're not the bad guys.<eos> They're the victims.<eos> We shouldn't be killing the people we're supposed to save.<eos> Please empty your pockets into the container.<eos> We're here to see...<eos> Please empty your pockets into the container.<eos> Please remove your belt and place it into the container.
Valentine.<eos> Niedermayer.<eos> [ sighs ] will you two stop gaying up My personal private quiet space?<eos> So, we completed the forensic analysis On the hooked dagger that jimmy brought us.<eos> It's the murder weapon, but not the murder weapon.<eos> Wow. How buddhist.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The dagger is a perfect match For the puncture wounds found on the victim.<eos> However, there was no blood residue Found on the weapon at all.<eos> Could he have cleaned it?
Well, Tessa needs the room now.<eos> Everybody's headed to bed.<eos> - She can sleep with Henry.<eos> - They're too old, they say. Meaning they're self-conscious about boy/girl issues.<eos> - This is my work space.<eos> - During the day.<eos> And for sleeping, you will have to head back to our room.<eos> That is...<eos> The mattress in that room dates back to the Confederacy. You remember last time, my back spasmed for weeks. Bill, all of the rooms are spoken for.<eos> There is a spare mattress, you could drag it into the living room.
♪ happy birthday to you ♪<eos> ♪ happy birthday, dear Jonathan ♪<eos> ♪ happy birthday to you ♪<eos> Make a wish.<eos> Oh, excuse me.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I don't mean to interrupt.<eos> The doc is, uh, in jail, and I need you to bail him out so that I can back to the office and misdirect and confuse The Little, Brown man.<eos> Please, I need your help.<eos> The suitcase is already packed, still right where I left it this morning when I was going someplace completely different.
We can't become a city that is both... in contempt and bankrupt.<eos> The issue is that someone is gonna put together a housing plan.<eos> Do you want to have a say in it?<eos> Do we want to make sure that the plan is a moderate one?<eos> 'Cause that is the only issue now--<eos> Let him finish.<eos> That's it.<eos> We are no longer allowing signs - in the council chamber.<eos> - You.<eos> Anybody who is carrying a sign shall relinquish it or be removed.
That's seven, eight hundred people, and just drop them right here.<eos> So, if the housing gets built, will you move from here?<eos> I love this house. I have always loved our little house. It's on my favorite block in the whole city.<eos> It's true. I always said to my husband,<eos> "Buddy, if I can't have a brick house on Saint John's Avenue, - "I don't want a house." - (CHUCKLES)<eos> It is beautiful.<eos> It is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It really is.<eos> I fell in love with it the first time I saw it.
And so, for all of us, this special day is a validation of the city's future.<eos> We're here today to celebrate a new beginning, a new life of a different sort.<eos> This one for five residents of public housing, who'll be the first to move into the new townhouses.<eos> If those five residents would please come forward, I would like, as the mayor of Yonkers, to present you each with a symbolic key to your new townhouse.<eos> Hey!<eos> Wh-where you been?<eos> Oh, hey, Jack. Everything good? Nice to see you.<eos> We're making real progress knocking down the affordable housing part of the court order.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> And the compromise plan the council approved fell apart the day before they were going to give it to Sand.
But I can't make you care about things.<eos> I can't even make myself care about things right now.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> And I can't make you try, either.<eos> It's gonna have to come from you.<eos> Well, I'll try to try.<eos> I got a spare room and a blow-up mattress.<eos> Nothing fancy.<eos> Sounds perfect.<eos> I'll go blow it up.
Then pretended like he was alive for the next month or so.<eos> Look, I panicked, Carl, okay?<eos> I panicked.<eos> Pure Dee plain and simple.<eos> I did some stupid, impulsive shit.<eos> That's his gun, right?<eos> That's your gun.<eos> No, the other gun, lid... that one.<eos> That's the one they found at his trailer.<eos> Right, that's 'cause I put it there.
My Infant Fabuleux press preview's tomorrow.<eos> Carla--amazing, by the way-- Is helping me design the space.<eos> - You two know each other?<eos> - Uh, yeah, this is my--<eos> This is Phoebe, my ex-wife.<eos> - May I have a word with you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What the hell are you playing at?<eos> I asked you months ago if I could use the lounge for a launch party.<eos> We booked it, remember?
Guardians of Royal children control their lands.<eos> Maybe that's why they want the baby.<eos> - Steal the kid, steal the land?<eos> - That only works if the baby lives.<eos> Put me in front.<eos> I can act as a shield for the others.<eos> You're too weak.<eos> Let's move, people! Now!<eos> I have a synthesized adrenaline shot.<eos> I stole it from the Matron's cabinet.
There you go, sugar.<eos> You doin' okay up there?<eos> I'm doing as good as dew on a mornin' full of sunshine.<eos> Hey, what's the deal with you and Naomi?<eos> You two an item or something?<eos> An item?<eos> Hey, it's none of my business, but...<eos> You must think I'm pretty stupid, don't you?<eos> I mean, you're right.<eos> I can take a core apart and put it back together with my eyes closed.
You will put out the fire you started by telling everyone, everywhere, that Mars is innocent.<eos> That the Canterbury was destroyed through the actions of Naomi Nagata, an operative of an OPA sleeper cell.<eos> Are you willing to make that statement?<eos> That can't be true.<eos> Even if Naomi is OPA.<eos> She saved her own life, too.<eos> - Bring up the bogie.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> That's the drive plume of a ship decelerating hard toward us.<eos> We've been tracking it inbound ever since we picked up your distress call.
OPA! OPA! OPA!<eos> Remember the Cant!<eos> O-P-A!<eos> At least you had the respect to stab me in the chest.<eos> They sell it at the shop on 25th and 8th.<eos> You know what I love most about Mars?<eos> They still dream.<eos> We gave up.<eos> They're an entire culture dedicated to a common goal, working together as one to turn a lifeless rock into a garden.<eos> We had a garden and we paved it.
I want ids.<eos> We need to know their capabilities.<eos> I'm sorry, sir, but there's nothing matching their profile in mcrn or un records.<eos> Isolate each vessel.<eos> I want detailed imagery and drive signatures on every one of them.<eos> CaptaintoDC-4.<eos> I've seen a ship like that before.<eos> Splash three and four!<eos> Lieutenant, the main drive is overloading.<eos> We have to shut it down.
Look, Dyson's right.<eos> You controlled it.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> It just happened.<eos> Because you're evil!<eos> Not helping.<eos> You know what, let her, she's actually pretty good at this.<eos> You're evil.<eos> But you're also good.<eos> We all have both inside of us, good and evil. And if he created a monster, let's use it against him.
I'm here for my baby.<eos> Then you'll have to get through me first.<eos> As long as I'm around, I'm the favourite child.<eos> Is that a fact?<eos> Time for our first Father-Daughter dance.<eos> (chuckling)<eos> You want a fight, Bo?<eos> I'll give you one but, you'll lose.<eos> The child cometh. I can smell it!<eos> Give it to us. It belongs to Hades.
Now that there's a truce, it's safe for me to go and say good-bye.<eos> Well, then you can get someone else to take you.<eos> I'm told the graves are unmarked.<eos> You can show me which is his.<eos> You can hold the mop...<eos> Or you can hold the gun.<eos> Easy.<eos> Control your breathing.<eos> Squeeze the trigger.<eos> Don't pull it.
Let's go home.<eos> Let's move out!<eos> There's your shot.<eos> Crosswind... 5 knots.<eos> Mountain men.<eos> Go with her.<eos> No.<eos> Her kill.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Finish it.
No.<eos> Please. Hey!<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Stop!<eos> There has to be another way.<eos> - There isn't.<eos> - No.<eos> What have I done?<eos> No one has to die for bone marrow.<eos> We can donate it.

It's not your fault that Mr. Selfridge sacked Mr. Thackeray.<eos> Am I a yes man, Mildred?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Would you say I had backbone?<eos> You're the bravest man I know.<eos> Mr. Selfridge has always been able to count on my loyalty.<eos> But I'm torn, Mildred.<eos> He's about to embark on a charity project.<eos> But it's risky.<eos> And I'm not sure I can endorse it to the board in all conscience.
Both shots bang on target.<eos> Impressive.<eos> 'Impressive'?<eos> Damn near bloody professional!<eos> Oi!<eos> Get off my desk!<eos> Your desk?<eos> Blake, what are you doing here?<eos> Er, a copy of the autopsy report on Emma Kenneally.<eos> I asked the forensic registrar to deliver it directly to me.
Oh. Thank you.<eos> Second of all, I just wanted to ask you to reconsider guilting your husband into quitting his job and becoming an accountant.<eos> Here's what I've learned in the years since I left high school.<eos> There's who you are, and there's who you think you are.<eos> And your level of personal misery is determined by how big the gap is between them.<eos> It's my job as a wife to help my husband see who he really is, rather than going after who he thinks he ought to be.<eos> That's how I keep him happy.<eos> But isn't the point of life to imagine yourself doing something greater, then working hard to achieve all of your dreams?<eos> Yes, if it's realistic.<eos> See, I want a bigger house, and I want to decorate it with the entire catalog from Pottery Barn, and I can have those things.
No, he's not only popular.<eos> He's at the top of the damn McKinley High food chain.<eos> But I don't know... Maybe he needs us, too.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> The guy with the perfect life needs to hang out with the damaged goods.<eos> Who you calling "damaged goods"?<eos> No one!<eos> I'm just saying that I don't trust him.<eos> I mean, he already gets everything that he wants.<eos> What is he doing barging into our club and taking it over?

N... no, there must be some mistake.<eos> You're gonna run it again.<eos> I did.<eos> Three times.<eos> These results are accurate.<eos> You mean to tell me that this rock has traces of every element known to man in it?<eos> Yep, plus one more.<eos> Element of unknown origin?<eos> What? I told you this rock was special.<eos> Show it to me again.
These results are accurate.<eos> You mean to tell me that this rock has traces of every element known to man in it?<eos> Yep, plus one more.<eos> Element of unknown origin?<eos> What? I told you this rock was special.<eos> Show it to me again.<eos> Wait.<eos> How... ?<eos> Where's the rock?<eos> I left it right here.
In the beginning, a star fell from heaven and changed us.<eos> Made us angels and gave us a new destiny:<eos> to stop the Apocalypse and the Devil himself.<eos> We must pass God's test and prove humanity is still worth saving.<eos> For we are the Messengers.<eos> Previously on The Messengers...<eos> The military covered up a giant hole in the earth.<eos> And I think this piece of meteorite has something to do with it.<eos> - Where's the rock?<eos> - I left it right here.
No speeding, okay?<eos> I really don't want to get pulled over by the cops again.<eos> First of all, you were driving.<eos> Secondly, this car won't go over 35.<eos> - Stop that.<eos> - What?<eos> - Stay out of my head.<eos> - I'm not hearing anything.<eos> You know, my gift's a lot like yours.<eos> I can't control it.
With this union, Hayley will share here unique gifts with her pack.<eos> And now your vows.<eos> I pledge to honor and defend you and yours above all others...<eos> To share in blessings and burdens, to be your advocate, your champion...<eos> To be your comfort, your sanctuary, and for as long as we both shall live... To be your family... To be your family.<eos> You two have endured all the traditional werewolf rituals and trials.<eos> There's only one remaining.<eos> Jackson, you may kiss your bride.<eos> I know that look.<eos> I've seen it all too often.
She's also the one person who intimately understands the enemy we now face.<eos> Both of you, just stop it.<eos> I was protecting hope from someone it is obvious none of us completely trust.<eos> Correct.<eos> We've done nothing but doubt Freya.<eos> Nevertheless, she kept her promise, and she saved your life.<eos> We certainly haven't demonstrated the same kindness towards her.<eos> So what the bloody hell do we do now?<eos> There's a jazz club in Algiers by the name of the St. James infirmary.<eos> Marcel has acquired it, and Josephine is fortifying it as a sanctuary against magic.
And finally, blood of her adopted child, my beloved daughter Freya...<eos> The closest thing to love that miserable witch has ever known.<eos> All the sources of her power bound together form a weakness.<eos> So what do you want me to do?<eos> Simple.<eos> Bind those ingredients to a weapon.<eos> Well, am I supposed to go to the toy store and get a slingshot?<eos> Use this.<eos> You just wouldn't be you if you didn't have a knife, would you?<eos> Well, perhaps you can steal it later and dull its blade with your art.
I have known that from the second we met.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Then you are already lost.<eos> No!<eos> Quite the sinister plot they had planned.<eos> It would have failed in the end, though.<eos> Just as well you came to your senses and sided with me.<eos> - Have you lost your mind?<eos> - My mind is quite clear.<eos> I just decided to purge it of treacherous barnacles.
It would be a shame if you were the one who now found himself so.<eos> It doesn't have to be like this of course, but be careful.<eos> I have only so much patience.<eos> So as we dress ourselves in the armor needed for this new fight...<eos> We must first tend to our wounds, starting with the deepest.<eos> Freya.<eos> You were wrong about me.<eos> I loathe Dahlia more than you could ever know.<eos> You don't see that light in me?<eos> That's because she snuffed it out.
This one breakthrough, is all we need, is one--<eos> Psst. Yeah.<eos> One second.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh. I need the keys to your helicopter.<eos> How would you even fly it?<eos> I got that covered.<eos> Can you please just give me the keys now?<eos> I... Promise, promise, I will not crash it.
I am not asking you.<eos> I am telling you.<eos> You should be very afraid.<eos> Well, I'm not. 'Cause my father taught me not to be.<eos> You taught me how to stand my ground and how to not give an inch in a battle.<eos> I'm not afraid of this man and you shouldn't be, either.<eos> He should be afraid of us.<eos> Then we'll stay.<eos> Your helicopter is back on the roof.<eos> I didn't crash it.
If you like, I could have some of my old associates look into Oliver's whereabouts.<eos> Would you?<eos> Of course.<eos> He's family.<eos> According to Laurel, Fisher's lawyer called Brick with the time and the place of the outgoing call.<eos> Can you trace that call back to where Brick is?<eos> At least where his phone is.<eos> His burner phone, to be exact.<eos> It's at a warehouse in the Glades.<eos> We'll check it out.
I ask myself the very same question... over and over.<eos> Slade...<eos> Don't.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You've come a long way.<eos> I have yet to make good with my promise, kid.<eos> Hello, Oliver.<eos> I told myself I was recording this message in case I died suddenly, but I wonder if it isn't just easier to say what I have to say to a video camera.<eos> I'm not the man you think I am, Oliver.<eos> I didn't save our city, I failed it.
Whether or not you break Roy out of Iron Heights, there is no more Arrow.<eos> Ra's took that from you.<eos> I was told once that a man cannot live by two names.<eos> Well, right now, I can't live by either.<eos> So I don't know who I am.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> Whether you're in a--in a suit or under a hood, you're the man that I...<eos> You're the man that I believe in.<eos> Uh, Ray finished the transponder.<eos> I have to upload it to a power source and, uh, hopefully it'll bring us right to Simmons.
What have you done?<eos> He failed this city.<eos> And I'm giving him the justice he deserves.<eos> This isn't justice!<eos> It's...wrong.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> Just passed out from the pain.<eos> What'd you find?<eos> My father isn't using any of the League's ordinary redoubts in the city.<eos> If Ra's is here with the virus, why hasn't he used it yet?
There's an electrical spike at 52nd and Robson.<eos> Wait, go back.<eos> The top floor of the Essex is closed.<eos> My father doesn't frequent hotels.<eos> According to internal emails, the floor was shut down for a Damien Darhk.<eos> A name like that has to be an alias.<eos> Damien Darhk is in Starling City.<eos> My father's most bitter enemy.<eos> That's why Ra's hasn't released the virus.<eos> He wants to use it to kill Damien Darhk.
You're not inoculated.<eos> This is my father's doing.<eos> I will see it undone.<eos> You choose a sword that has already defeated you in battle.<eos> Miss Smoak, I've taken out one of Ra's' men.<eos> Don't take chances. Put that body some place airtight, and try not to kill anyone else, while you're at it!<eos> The virus is spreading.<eos> Can you replicate the inoculant?<eos> That is the easy part.<eos> The hard part is disseminating it over a three block radius.
Father, come out of there.<eos> Father!<eos> Father, come out of there.<eos> Father.<eos> Luxury...<eos> What is a luxury and what is not?<eos> This silk is a luxury.<eos> And this cotton is not.<eos> Who will you give that writing to?<eos> I shall hold it dear until the day I die.

He was an accomplice.<eos> But who's her accomplice this time?<eos> The nerdy kid.<eos> Blowing up a control station is the number-one way To get a terrorist to sleep with you.<eos> Except klassen had him shipped out of town, Where no press could ever get to him.<eos> What about klassen? Klassen said he was from klamath falls<eos> And his family gave up the farm. So?<eos> So, a while back, the government did something really dumb<eos> In 2001.<eos> To protect an endangered fish, The federal government took over the klamath basin And cut access to anyone using it for irrigation,
And we're definitely not gonna watch a romantic comedy together.<eos> I'm not your boyfriend.<eos> Besides, we have paperwork to do.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Michelle!<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> How was school?<eos> You don't have my bracelet.<eos> You know what, I had to use it.

Oh, yeah.<eos> Hey, Sam.<eos> Haven't seen you in the jungle in a dog's age.<eos> What's the story, tolson?<eos> Fire was called in at 4:45 A.M.<eos> Hook and Ladder couldn't get it under control till 9:00.
Not your kind of justice.<eos> Point One of our 10-Point Plan:<eos> - We want freedom.<eos> - Freedom!<eos> We want power to determine the destiny of our black and oppressed community.<eos> We believe that black and oppressed people will not be free until we're able to determine our destinies in our own communities ourselves by controlling all the institutions which exist in our communities.<eos> - You really want my job?<eos> - Not the way you do it.<eos> All right, I didn't make the world and neither did you.<eos> No, but we can change it.

Your age is not even a consideration.<eos> Really? Really.<eos> Officers said they put sarah daniels in here.<eos> What is it that you think I've done?<eos> I've been in a wheelchair since I was 16.<eos> I was paralyzed from the waist down In a high-school gymnastics accident.<eos> Your driver's license was used in a prison visiting office.<eos> Uh, w-was it about three months ago?<eos> That was about the time I lost my wallet.<eos> You remember where you were when you lost it?

It's a pasta maker.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes. You said you wanted to learn how to make homemade ravioli.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll roll out the dough, and then you can put it through the machine.<eos> All right. And for our stuffing, I got us lobster, duck, Chanterelle mushrooms,<eos> And your favorite, sausage and ricotta cheese. Yum.<eos> So, did you bring your bucket list?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I know you're gonna make fun of it.

I may have some constructive criticism, but...<eos> There you go.<eos> There's mine. Wow. And you typed it.
Zoe Blyer's still missing.<eos> Hey!<eos> Get the hell outta there!<eos> Put your hands in the air.<eos> Boston P.D.<eos> Don't shoot.<eos> - What's in the bags?<eos> - Garbage.<eos> You can't arrest me for picking up garbage.<eos> If it's outside, I can take it.
About what?<eos> Well, about...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, investments or...<eos> - Closets.<eos> - Closets?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So I did a comprehensive analysis on the poison.<eos> The reason wasn't able to identify it is because it's from an entirely new synthetic hallucinogenic.
Well, I'll need to autopsy to confirm the cause of death, but these wounds are consistent with a gunshot, yes.<eos> - Drive-by maybe? Stray bullet?<eos> - It's possible.<eos> Maybe wrong place at the wrong time?<eos> Then again, people will do anything for a good parking spot.<eos> Hey.<eos> So we tried to call Ned's wife to notify her of his death, but her cell phone was in his car.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Turns out she forgot it on her way to work this morning.

- Jesus Christ. Did I insult him again? - Fix it!<eos> - I don't know, I'll find out.<eos> - Fuck me.<eos> Joanne, I am... I really want to talk about this, but I don't have the time right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm taking the Pentagon job.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Fuck.<eos> This outfit belonged to my father.<eos> Try not to get blood all over it.
Help me get rid of Nyx.<eos> I assume you mean with the box.<eos> If it contained you, it can contain her, too.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> Yeah, let's hold off on the father daughter bonding for now, shall we? Alright.<eos> But you're right.<eos> The box can contain a force and send it back to Tartarus.<eos> But only one.<eos> So, if you use it to contain her, that means...
Come on, man.<eos> I got a pulse.<eos> I lost him.<eos> Always wanted to try that.<eos> - Oh, hey, beige scrubs.<eos> - Dr. Prince.<eos> Hey, listen, I totally fucked my shoulder trying that precordial on our little buddy here.<eos> - It was pretty cool, though.<eos> - Yeah, well.<eos> Would you mind popping it back in for me?
- The fish!<eos> It makes sense.<eos> Charlie is Lena's cat, but Lucien is allergic to its hair.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> We were living in Lyon at that time, which wasn't good for his cholesterol.<eos> He doesn't want anything old.<eos> He wants something ultra modern.<eos> I need a piece of wood and string to draw a circle accurately.<eos> I've got a compass.<eos> You can borrow it.
- Pieces of wood.<eos> No, it points there.<eos> See something?<eos> See anything?<eos> Help me.<eos> Come!<eos> - Look at the axe.<eos> - Axe?<eos> On the ground with the red handle.<eos> - You saw it this morning?
Yeah.<eos> Since when do you wear a tie?<eos> Says the girl in the party dress?<eos> Had a mix-up with ZoGo this morning.<eos> Couldn't get a car and didn't want to be late.<eos> Well, looks like it's you and me, Krumitz.<eos> Let's take over the world.<eos> Detective Linney.<eos> Crime Scene recovered Mr. Matthews' phone at the scene.<eos> Left it for you cyber guys to handle.
That's impossible.<eos> No one passenger could be assigned five drivers for a single trip.<eos> Well, Cade Matthew's ZoGo profile suggests otherwise.<eos> Well, we did experience a glitch in the system last night.<eos> Um, we ran a check and we rebooted the entire system along the Eastern Seaboard.<eos> That could easily explain the confusion.<eos> There were several complaints and a couple missed rides.<eos> No, you were hacked.<eos> At 5:10 a.m., to be exact.<eos> Looks like a hacker wrote a script that took the unique identifier of the passenger's phone and bounced it to five separate drivers.
I think it's U-G-L-Y, this quilt ain't got no alibi.<eos> It's ugly.<eos> It's ugly.<eos> Do you see where I'm going with this?<eos> You can talk.<eos> Respectfully, I-I have no clue.<eos> Phil, sometimes, in quilting, you just don't have the right scraps.<eos> And no matter how much effort you put in, you make a quilt that looks like this.<eos> I will agree that it's ugly.<eos> And you worked so hard on it and you trick yourself into thinking it's beautiful and you display it proudly in the entryway on you divan.
Horseperson.<eos> A Horseman.<eos> You know, maybe the stone glows red because of her evil actions.<eos> Like a Messenger mood ring?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> You sure you want to do this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just one last thing.<eos> You sure you're not aliens?<eos> ABADDON's clock is ticking down, and we can't stop it because Koa ran off with Leland Schiller's address.
Make you a deal.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You play a good song, and I'll dance with you.<eos> Trust me, if there was some Bob Marley up in here, I would already be on the floor.<eos> Come on.<eos> You helped save the world today.<eos> Yeah, I don't know about that.<eos> The meteorite, it's still out there.<eos> It's got powers we don't understand.<eos> And even without a Horseman, what if the military manages to harness it?
For the bride, it's always the happiest day of her life, for the father, it's often bittersweet.<eos> Did somebody tell you I was courting, Father?<eos> It's not true, I assure you.<eos> All I meant to say was, sometimes it's hard for a father to let go of his daughter.<eos> But it's necessary to give her some freedom or let her access her own finances, at least.<eos> He's unreasonably strict.<eos> If my second novel is published, I hope it will give him the chance to see how I've matured.<eos> If?<eos> From what I hear, the literary establishment is waiting with baited breath.<eos> I wanted to ask, if you'd be the first to read it?
- Returning customer.<eos> - Hey, Lydia, what's going on?<eos> She's got a rapid heart rate, had a syncopal episode.<eos> I was selling a lottery ticket and next thing I knew, flat on my back.<eos> Any dizziness, shortness of breath?<eos> A little dizzy, yeah.<eos> - Oh, thanks.<eos> - Hey, Lydia, how's the bodega?<eos> Oh, it's a nightmare.<eos> You can have it.
- Wes.<eos> We don't really know... we don't really know what he's been through, what it did to him, what he's done, what he'll do.<eos> He's gonna be fine.<eos> We're...<eos> Gonna be fine.<eos> Just be careful, Claire.<eos> Cassandra, you left this in daddy's car.<eos> Oh, thank you, mommy.<eos> Now, I couldn't find my phone.<eos> Uh, are you sure you put it in my purse?
Is Drill here?<eos> I want to talk to him.<eos> About what?<eos> I... I need... I need him to do something.<eos> He's not here, mommy, but we can ask him later.<eos> Where is he?<eos> He's with a new friend... an important friend.<eos> Why is this new friend so important, Minx?<eos> Something terrible is coming.<eos> Before I crashed, I felt something enter my mind, as if something was ripping it apart looking through my memories.
I'm not doing this.<eos> You're not doing what, the hearing?<eos> - No, I'm not doing the fucking pee test.<eos> - It's your last one.<eos> Look, Zoey, I'm about to fight for my life in there.<eos> I don't have time to sit on the fucking toilet.<eos> You don't like to check boxes, I don't like to check boxes.<eos> This whole thing's been fucking humiliating.<eos> I need you to take the test.<eos> I'm not gonna do it.
"Refusers" or "refused".<eos> You can sew?<eos> Don't tease. It's my great-aunt.<eos> Pierre-Hubert, Camille, passports!<eos> We're reaching East Germany.<eos> Passports, please.<eos> Guys, your passports...<eos> Why?<eos> East Germany. Hurry.<eos> When do I get it back?
- How kind. When I got home, I had to look on a map.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Not many people do.<eos> I wrote to you last year.<eos> Maybe Ivan gave me the wrong address.<eos> No, I got your letter.<eos> I didn't want to answer.<eos> I started to write, then I stopped.<eos> You wanted Esther's address.<eos> I figured you'd get it from someone else.
Everyone here.<eos> (Croatoan): So, you like to watch, Dave?<eos> Take a look at this!<eos> - He spoke to me.<eos> He said my name!<eos> What do you think it means?<eos> Could Croatoan tell when I'm having a vision?<eos> ls he going to come after me next?<eos> - We'll protect you, I promise.<eos> - You saw aether fragments in Charlotte's go bag, that means we can use the rougarou device to track it down.
They're dropping in the order Ona brought them back.<eos> - Then Charlotte only has a few minutes left.<eos> - If this is really goodbye... I need to tell you about your father.<eos> - She wants to see you.<eos> - Come here.<eos> It's never fair, is it?<eos> - No, it isn't.<eos> - What did Charlotte tell you about the Barn?<eos> - She said the next piece we need is in the Void.<eos> She called it the controller crystal.
Probably the location where the laptop was used.<eos> Looks like it's a storage place off of the turnpike.<eos> It's still there.<eos> I logged in to the security company's website.<eos> So that blinky thing, that's where Ali hid Mona's laptop?<eos> Could Mona have set this up to alert the police?<eos> It's an option, but she didn't.<eos> She sent it to the four of you.<eos> And usually, Mona's security is incredibly tight, but it's almost like she purposely made it easy for me to log in.<eos> So we could get her laptop back if Ali took it?
And she cried?<eos> They still haven't figured it out yet.<eos> Wait, have you been with Spencer this whole time?<eos> You didn't even call me back.<eos> Yeah. I got your message.<eos> Listen,<eos> Spencer asked me to look into something, and it took longer than I thought.<eos> About the storage unit?<eos> I found out the name on the rental agreement.<eos> Well, who rented it?
'So she gets up and goes to the kitchen.<eos> 'Makes sure the tap there is turned off properly.<eos> 'Gets back into bed.<eos> 'Sticks her hand under the bed.<eos> 'Dog licks it.<eos> 'But she can still hear it.<eos> '"Drip, drip,<eos> '"drip."<eos> 'And now she realises it's coming from the wardrobe in her bedroom.<eos> 'Terrified, she gets up, 'goes over to the wardrobe 'and opens it.'
You know you like that.<eos> Uh-uh. You didn't know your mama could move like that, did you?<eos> Ma, no offense, but this song is... is really old school.<eos> I know it is, but there's something there.<eos> You got to listen, listen.<eos> See, you hear that? Yeah, I kind of like the little riff, but the, um... lyrics suck.<eos> Lucious, the song is about a man who's in love with a woman who don't love him back.<eos> Ah, I remember that hook.<eos> I always thought that was a good hook.<eos> Play it.
I had a dream about you.<eos> I can't ever remember my dreams.<eos> Barely sleep anyway.<eos> Where's your badge?<eos> Well, it's...<eos> You shouldn't do that.<eos> Whatever you saw on the news, or whatever pissed you off, you'll wake up one day and you'll miss it.<eos> I won't miss it.<eos> There ain't no PD anymore.<eos> Well, if you're gonna throw it away, I'll take it.
No, it's for...<eos> It's to just go, Ray.<eos> It's an alternative.<eos> Go somewhere.<eos> Before we can't turn back.<eos> Whatever happens, those questions, a custody battle, it's not gonna be easy for Chad.<eos> So don't start it.<eos> The way those two investigators sounded, it's a matter of time, Ray.<eos> You put that envelope away.<eos> I'm gonna pretend like you never really thought I'd take it.
Caspere's murder, if it was them, it just opened up all this other stuff.<eos> We were always set up.<eos> So was Frank.<eos> Your gangster buddy. Yeah, he's actually not a bad guy, but, yeah, Caspere was playing him.<eos> So we find Osterman.<eos> Tyler. Says here Lenny's with the union.<eos> They'd have some kind of address.<eos> Unless you just want to take off.<eos> I'm pretty sure I can get us out of the country.<eos> If there's a chance to get them, I want to take it.
Now, please, enjoy the evening.<eos> Full moon is the best time to ratify alliances.<eos> A nation's strength is determined by two things, its energy resources<eos> and its capacity for war.<eos> Oh, yes, here we are.<eos> You care to watch for a while?<eos> I do so enjoy the natural state.<eos> You're the prettiest little girl I ever seen.<eos> I heard there's a unicorn in those woods.<eos> You wanna help me look for it?
You must be famished.<eos> There is an inescapable parallel between you and Jezebel, Mason.<eos> Keen Bible student that you are, you'll recall dogs ate Jezebel's face,<eos> - along with the rest of her. - Well, if Jezebel was right with the risen Jesus, the Riz would have provided her with a new face, as He has provided mine.<eos> The transplant surgery is extremely skillful, which is why Cordell here will be performing the face-off.<eos> Hello.<eos> You boys remind me of that German cannibal who advertised for a friend and then ate him and his penis before he died.<eos> Tragedy being, the penis was overcooked.<eos> Go to all that trouble to eat a friend and you overcook his penis.<eos> They ate it anyway.
Mason would've preferred to brand your face.<eos> He fought bravely and with his own funds against the Humane Slaughter Act, and managed to keep face-branding legal.<eos> It's very important to Mason that I have the pig's experience.<eos> Mason has done beautiful things with these creatures. Hm!<eos> Very special.<eos> Truly visionary.<eos> He has a wealth of information and resources in his faceless skull.<eos> The longer you're respectful, the longer you'll keep your tongue.<eos> And when I do lose my tongue?<eos> I'll boil it and slice it very thin, marinate it in olive oil, garlic, parsley and vinegar.
Came off Mrs Leeds's eye.<eos> Never did that before.<eos> Er, I just...<eos> Erm, sorry, but I'm just surprised to see you back.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Jimmy...<eos> OK.<eos> The mirror pieces all had those smooth prints.<eos> Forefinger on the back of the piece wedged in her labia, a smudged thumb on the front.<eos> He polished it after he placed it, so he could see his face in there.
I want to participate.<eos> I'd prefer to go alone. Really.<eos> But I want to be there at every stage, to be sure it's done properly, and that you...<eos> "Sure it's done properly"?<eos> Gabrielle.<eos> Gabrielle!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Is it the baby?<eos> - Don't you want it?
I thought you--<eos> I don't pay you to think!<eos> I pay you to do! What have you told him?<eos> I've told him nothing, ma'am.<eos> I believe he mentioned reading an old journal of Malcolm's.<eos> I assumed you gave it to him in an attempt to reveal the truth, as you said you would.<eos> I did no such thing.<eos> Bart is very impressionable!<eos> And I can't have him falling subject to the wrong influences.<eos> Now find me the journal and get it back to me immediately!
Let me help you down.<eos> I'm all right, man.<eos> You hear so much about a story in the news, and you forget that real people are involved.<eos> I just have to go pick up my daughter.<eos> Right. Of course.<eos> And I'm sorry... again.<eos> I bought this for you.<eos> It's just like the one I had when I was your age.<eos> Back when I got my first bike...<eos> You wouldn't take it out of the garage without one of these.
We will talk about this when I get home.<eos> What, am I too loud?<eos> What is it?<eos> What happened?<eos> My flashlight came back.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> It fell out of the truck when I opened it.<eos> Okay.<eos> You didn't miss it the first time you looked?<eos> Somebody put it there.
I thought it was Scott.<eos> He got into the house so easy, why not the truck, right?<eos> That makes sense.<eos> Yeah, it did, until I found out that Scott didn't kill Tom.<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> So he never had the flashlight.<eos> Do you even know if the flashlight is the murder weapon?<eos> It is.<eos> Okay.<eos> You didn't touch it, did you?
I often remember you, Gilles.<eos> Your smiling face as you tried to get between the cars.<eos> You couldn't get through, and you smiled.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You're innocent.<eos> But I'm not guilty.<eos> I know who's guilty.<eos> Turkish fascists, negationists and governments that support them.<eos> I understand your act.<eos> But that doesn't justify it.
Fine.<eos> Safer for everyone.<eos> All right, let's move this fucking couch.<eos> All right, keep still.<eos> Okay, stand back!<eos> You've got it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> May I approach?<eos> No!<eos> No. I'm gonna throw it.
- That's him.<eos> 11:28 p.m.<eos> And that's her license-plate number.<eos> Let's track down the junkie messiah, throw him in jail, and come back and enjoy a couple of cold ones.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> S01E09 Inescapable Truth<eos> Gravely: Is this your van?<eos> Yeah, that's my van.<eos> It used to be, anyway.<eos> A few weeks ago, I donated it to one of my patients.
Can you?<eos> Haven't seen her broomstick.<eos> Where is she who must not be named?<eos> Working in my office.<eos> Hey, Christy.<eos> You look great.<eos> _<eos> ... Let me know if the flashlight is the murder weapon.<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> I wiped it off.
It's too dangerous.<eos> If I'm working with her and sleeping with you, she's going to figure it out.<eos> She won't.<eos> She will.<eos> And then that's it for my career and your marriage.<eos> We're gonna end up with nothing.<eos> I know it's scary, but that's a risk we've gotta take. It's the only way for us to be together.<eos> Sebastien...<eos> I hope that's not true, became your plan is terrible.<eos> I'm not going through with it.
- end with that. - Good.<eos> I thought we should start with something simple.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - A toy.<eos> I thought we might get into some light torture play in the comfort and privacy of our home.<eos> What makes you think I would ever agree to that?<eos> I'm selling my beloved estate for you.<eos> I scratch your back, you... [Whip cracks] ...whip mine.<eos> Adrian, it is bad enough that our home is a murder house.<eos> I won't let you turn it into a sex dungeon, as well.
But this time, you have to be clear with him about us.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> It's not you I don't trust.<eos> Mon coeur, I wanted to talk to you about the other night,<eos> - when we... - when we didn't do anything.<eos> You know, thank God Mr. Powell walked in on us because it would have been a huge mistake.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> I love you, and you love me.<eos> Well, I love chocolate, but it's bad for me, so I don't eat it.
Hey, Marisol.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good, Gail.<eos> I was just calling to see how it's going with Jesse.<eos> Oh, wonderfully.<eos> He is a gem -- an absolute professional.<eos> So, you're happy with his housework?<eos> Because I haven't received a check for his services.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I dropped it in the mail last week.
Have you told Spence?<eos> He won't return my calls.<eos> Anyway... (Sniffles)<eos> (Exhales sharply) what did you want to talk to me about?<eos> Well, maybe now's not the best time.<eos> Please.<eos> I need to think about something else.<eos> Okay, then... care to see what's behind door number one?<eos> Mrs. Taylor's old sofa.<eos> I bought it back from Kivnik's.
No, I lost my stupid phone.<eos> Oh, I thought you were mad at me.<eos> Where was the last place you had it?<eos> - If I knew, it wouldn't be lost.<eos> - Oh, let's see.<eos> The last text you sent was... when you were with Jacklyn.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I left my phone at your house!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll go home and find it.
I'll call the gym for you.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> You know what? I don't wanna trouble you.<eos> I'll call them myself.<eos> Uh, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Carmen Luna to see you... without an appointment.<eos> You know, it's not a good time, Carmen.<eos> I just wanted to ask you if I left my phone at your house.<eos> You did.<eos> Yeah, I found it between the sofa cushions.
Oh, I'm so sorry. I assumed the worst.<eos> Can you forgive me?<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> Of course I forgive you.<eos> Oh! Thank you.<eos> Ah! Well...<eos> Now that that's out of my system, let's grab some coffee so we can chat about your big TV debut.<eos> Hi.<eos> I didn't know what the traditional gift was for accusing of your boyfriend of murder, so I went with a plant.<eos> Don't kill it.
I'll be there tomorrow at 3:00.<eos> Make sure your husband is present.<eos> Of course.<eos> He'll be so excited.<eos> This is boring.<eos> Well, we should be playing golf. But somebody took so long finding his shoes this morning that I missed my tee time.<eos> I want chocolate milk.<eos> It's a country club.<eos> They don't have that.<eos> Mom would get it for me.
You're great, and I am so flattered, but it... it feels... it feels wrong.<eos> Yeah, oh, you're... you're not into it.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> [Sighs] Are you okay with us keeping it professional?<eos> Of course.<eos> Okay.<eos> Jacklyn... you deserve to be happy.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means you shouldn't deny who you are.<eos> And if your marriage is not making you happy, I think you should... just end it.
Oh, yes.<eos> Go ahead, take it.<eos> We'll chat.<eos> So how was your run?<eos> Good, thanks.<eos> You got my message?<eos> Does that sound good to you?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> I'll leave the key with the doorman.<eos> But you don't have to give it back.
I've still got bills to pay.<eos> If I stop paying Columbia House, I stop getting my tapes.<eos> Look, we both listen to the tapes.<eos> Let me take care of Columbia House.<eos> Let me take care of the rent for a little while.<eos> I got my job back.<eos> I don't know, baby girl.<eos> I mean, rent is one thing, but I need new head shots, new clothes, new teeth, Botox to stop my sweating.<eos> Well, that costume's got to be worth something.<eos> Maybe you could sell it.
No, you don't.<eos> I'm 15, and I'm pretty much your boss.<eos> Um... can you go?<eos> We're, like, in here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No way, man.<eos> I can't give you your security deposit back.<eos> There's all kinds of wear on this thing.<eos> That is ridiculous.<eos> I treated this suit like a beautiful lady, which is to say, I did not touch it.

[ Sighs ] Did you say sparkling?<eos> I'm fine with either.<eos> Or maybe you'd prefer to have a glass of wine?<eos> I mean, just because I'm not supposed to drink doesn't mean other people can't.<eos> You don't drink?<eos> Well, not really supposed to because of my condition.<eos> What condition is that?<eos> I'm dying, Karen.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> If you could just give me an address, ma'am, I can plug it into waze --
I... was just telling Karen about this guy I met at Lucy's school.<eos> I thought we had a connection, so I went over to his office and flirted my little butt off, waiting for him to ask me out.<eos> And, uh... Nothing.<eos> Why don't you ask him out?<eos> Oh, 'cause that's just...<eos> [Laughing] I mean, that's a little too forward for me.<eos> Yeah, no, no, April's literally never asked a man out in her entire life.<eos> That may be true, but you don't get anything in this life without going after what you want.<eos> You didn't wait around for someone to offer you this fabulous store.<eos> I'm sure you had to fight tooth and nail to have it.
But I-I do think that I can be more.<eos> More how?<eos> What have you done besides open a restaurant?<eos> Two restaurants.<eos> Wunderbar is also mine.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes, I'm the head chef... uh, currently.<eos> It's... yeah.<eos> Why does Greta Jager's picture come up when I type in your restaurant?<eos> - Yeah, she opened it, but, um...
I'm... I'm sorry to bother you this late.<eos> Ah, it's no bother at all.<eos> Jessica?<eos> - Josslyn.<eos> - Josslyn.<eos> That is such a pretty name.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Come in.<eos> You know, I think I may have left my phone here.<eos> I... I can't find it anywhere.
Just accept it with grace.<eos> Okay, I'm not a religious person, but I'm pretty sure that that's not what they mean by divine intervention.<eos> Look, I don't want you pouting in a corner somewhere tonight.<eos> Everyone is gonna have a plus-one... except me, but I will be busy.<eos> Busy with what?<eos> And what is so funny?<eos> Father John thinks me and Vivian are lesbian lovers.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry. What?<eos> I left my phone here yesterday.<eos> And I brought it to her, and he caught our energy, I guess.
Well...<eos> Despite everything, I still love them.<eos> And you...<eos> You want to have this baby with them?<eos> No.<eos> But maybe they want it without me.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Okay, honey...<eos> Now that Vivian's health is good again, they might really want this.<eos> Do you realize what it would feel like to carry a baby to term, then hand it over to someone else?
And, yes, tonight is important to me.<eos> And if you help me, I help you.<eos> You understand?<eos> The husband, the wife, and you?<eos> Yes, father.<eos> It's called a throuple.<eos> Well, that's a kitschy little term.<eos> Karen, you know that I'm open-minded about a good many things, but in a situation like this, there is only one thing to do.<eos> What's that?<eos> Carry the child to term, then give it up for adoption.

When I catch you, I swear I'm going to rip out your disgusting little ball sack until you (Bleep) throw up your own dick!<eos> Damn it!<eos> Stop, we're the FBI, bitch!<eos> Hey, watch it!<eos> Stop that guy!<eos> Watch out, watch out!<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Hey!<eos> My wig!<eos> Leave it, leave it!
What happened?<eos> Bethany Young's parents have petitioned the court to have your bail revoked.<eos> Okay.<eos> They've been trying to do that for months.<eos> Yes, but this time, it may work.<eos> Why?<eos> They unsealed your indictment today.<eos> We finally know why you were arrested.<eos> Ah, it's an open file.<eos> I didn't break any rules looking at it.
Sometimes one doesn't know if what one is doing is the right thing.<eos> - It's just a feeling one gets.<eos> - You fucking little brat.<eos> Sometimes feelings can be associated in a strange way with direct pain.<eos> We find what we keep.<eos> That's how it's always been.<eos> Always.<eos> Ove?<eos> Do whatever you want with the purse.<eos> It was you who found it.

Aether caused the troubles.<eos> It can end them too?<eos> It's like uranium... powerful, and if manipulated correctly, it could be our salvation.<eos> Then why didn't we use aether to end the troubles from the start?<eos> Because to do so, we'd need a lot of aether, more than I've ever seen.<eos> You can't bring more in?<eos> Not with the thinnies sealed.<eos> Then we need to find the stash William left here.<eos> William left a stash here?<eos> Mara was looking for it.
Why?<eos> Audrey will marry me.<eos> The ceremony is about to happen.<eos> Once she says "I do," her choice is made to accept me fully.<eos> And after that, I'll have her mine for the rest of my life.<eos> Why are you telling me all this?<eos> Because you can't do anything about it.<eos> And I enjoy that.<eos> What if I forced my way into your little fantasy world?<eos> And tore it all down.
That's sweet.<eos> - Any progress?<eos> - Some, but not enough.<eos> Did you mean it today, when you raised your hand?<eos> No.<eos> But I knew if I did, the others who wanted to would be less afraid.<eos> Is that it?<eos> The bill?<eos> Yes.<eos> They delivered it just after the cabinet meeting.
We're police officers, Glenn.<eos> We want to ask you a few questions, but you gotta put the gun down.<eos> Glenn?<eos> Glenn, there are more cops on the way.<eos> This is gonna get to a bad place really fast, a place that we're not gonna be able to pull it back from, Glenn.<eos> -Put it down. -Shafe:<eos> That's your wife.<eos> -Put the gun down.<eos> -Put the gun down.<eos> Shafe: Put it down.

Maybe somebody didn't wait for the, uh, warrant to be issued?<eos> So, what, we should have just left the scene so the old lady could burn it while we went to a judge?<eos> The guy pulled a gun on me.<eos> He and his wife both claim that you were already drawing your weapon before you identified yourself as a police officer.<eos> And given your whole... (Scoffs)<eos> Well... it's somewhat understandable.<eos> Which brings us to your report, detective.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Gee, I submitted it.
And given your whole... (Scoffs)<eos> Well... it's somewhat understandable.<eos> Which brings us to your report, detective.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Gee, I submitted it.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> -Not yet, no. -I didn't?<eos> Wow. With all the confusion...<eos> I know I typed it up.

The stone moved to the right, by a metre.<eos> Not bad.<eos> About turn!<eos> Tighten the locking mechanism.<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> Faster!<eos> Camouflage appearance<eos> No good.<eos> Move it further across.
Come on, faster!<eos> The Germans aren't gonna wait for you to finish!<eos> Remember, don't let them get close.<eos> The second you see an officer, take the shot.<eos> Kill the commander and I reckon you can take down half the squad.<eos> And don't waste your ammo.<eos> Questions?<eos> We've got tanks, Comrade Captain.<eos> A tank can be stopped two ways.<eos> Number one, bombard it with grenades from a close distance.
We know that he detonated a bomb in Italy and another in France.<eos> And now, here in the States.<eos> Hey, you guys got to check out this Web site.<eos> It's trending like crazy on ToggleFly, FriendAgenda-- it is everywhere.<eos> Who's behind this?<eos> We don't know.<eos> Metadata's been scrubbed.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> You are responsible for this bombing.<eos> You could've prevented it if you'd just left your cell phone at home.
Your addiction to technology is going to kill you.<eos> And now for another lesson.<eos> When this Web site gets one million viewers, a second bomb will explode.<eos> Our target is using page views on a Web site to make the public responsible for the next explosion.<eos> The site was uploaded a few hours ago.<eos> Has already 460,000 views and counting.<eos> The site has an auto-run feature.<eos> The video starts playing the moment you access the site.<eos> We have to pull it down now.<eos> We've tried to hack it.
We need to find a way to break through that site's firewall.<eos> Then, you better get moving here, Avery, 'cause human curiosity puts us on an unpredictable clock.<eos> We got no way of knowing when or where that bomb is gonna explode.<eos> ♪ CSI Cyber 1x05 ♪ Crowd Sourced Original Air Date on April 8, 2015<eos> Guys, were you able to break through the firewall<eos> No, still working on it.<eos> Target's Web site's protected by a legendary hardening package.<eos> It's not just one firewall. It's ten.<eos> Whoever set this up has mad skills.<eos> Well, can you recode it and get in?
Tobin betrayed Avery by trying to sell confidential FBI Intel to the bad guys she was chasing.<eos> Nobody saw his double-cross coming?<eos> Tobin was the first black hat she rescued.<eos> Avery handpicked him. She saw something special in him.<eos> We trusted him because she did.<eos> Tobin knew Avery had a soft spot for him, and he played her.<eos> Tell me that's the bomb's hard drive.<eos> It is.<eos> I was able to rebuild it and pull off the unique I.D. number.<eos> I used it to track the tablet's movement from the theater back to where it was first turned on.
- Yeah.<eos> - Code sent from a computer did all this?<eos> It's pretty amazing, huh?<eos> That's terrifying.<eos> Someone's figured out how to set a fire through the Internet.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> At an office supply store.<eos> Do you want to play games?<eos> The code, Rusty.<eos> The code in the flash drive-- who gave it to you?

That's why hackers spend so many hours searching for them.<eos> I figured I could get at least a grand for that, whether it worked or not.<eos> It's one thing to sell flaws to FriendAgenda.<eos> It's another to walk around with detailed instructions on how to remotely set a fire.<eos> Oh, is... is that against the law?<eos> I was just trying to earn a living here.<eos> This is my business.<eos> Now it's our business. If you didn't write the code, who did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I traded for it on the wire.
I did.<eos> After I got busted for the stock exchange hack, you guys took everything away from me.<eos> You took my cell phone, my video games, my computers, 60,000 MP3s on my laptop.<eos> But you didn't get this.<eos> Flash drive?<eos> Holds 128 gigs.<eos> Not enough for all my music, but a safe place to back up all my favorite codes.<eos> Like the printer exploit.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I called it Ghost Print.
I compared it to what we got from your C.I., and it all lines up.<eos> But, look, j-just the first part.<eos> Look, you got to believe me.<eos> I only wrote code that allowed the intrusion, not the code to set a fire.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Who else knew about this code?<eos> See, that's the thing; I don't know.<eos> Nelson.<eos> Okay.<eos> I shared it on a few forums.

Had to make sure you came alone.<eos> No Feds hiding in the bushes.<eos> So, uh, you're behind all this, huh?<eos> You're Justice?<eos> Man, I almost told you earlier, all right?<eos> You kind of caught me off guard.<eos> Your probation officer got you looking into his cases or something?<eos> I mean, it's a part of my deal.<eos> I know a piece of my code was being used on the printers.<eos> I mean, anybody could have had it over the wire.

"The Great Red Dragon and the Woman Clothed in Sun"?<eos> Blake's Dragon stands over a pleading woman caught in the coil of its tail.<eos> Few images in Western art radiate such a unique and... nightmarish charge of demonic sexuality.<eos> The man who killed the Jacobis and the Leedses saw something in them that drew him and drove him to do it.<eos> He chose them, because something in them spoke to him.<eos> The Jacobis were the first to help him, the first to lift him into the glory of his becoming.<eos> The Jacobis were better than anything he knew.<eos> Until the Leedses.<eos> As the Dragon grows in strength and glory, there are families to come.<eos> I have to believe there is a common factor and we will find it... soon.
My husband usually makes their food from scratch, but he's out of town and it's a lot of work so I've been feeding them canned food.<eos> Was it canned food made in China?<eos> - Is it bad to be made in China?<eos> - If you're pet food.<eos> Dogs get poisoned by Chinese pet food all the time.<eos> No, they're not gonna...<eos> Are the dogs going to die?<eos> Are the dogs gonna die? I mean, you got them here really fast and the activated charcoal should soak up whatever's in their system.<eos> It would help though if you could bring me a sample of whatever it is they've been eating so we can run some tests.<eos> - I'll bring it by tomorrow.
Careful.<eos> Now I'm going to see if I can trust you.<eos> Go to the front door, lock it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'll wait right here.<eos> Don't try to run.<eos> I can catch you.<eos> Oh, Reba.<eos> Now lock the door, and put the key around my neck.<eos> Hang it around my neck.
Mmm. Delicious!<eos> What did you do?<eos> - I... added the delicious.<eos> Spencer!<eos> - Jenny!<eos> Are you taking me for that drink, or what?<eos> Would you like to try our jam?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Looks awful.<eos> I helped make it.
What's in the salad?<eos> Avocado, lime, oil, coriander, tomatoes.<eos> Coriander?<eos> I hate coriander.<eos> - You've always liked coriander.<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - I don't like coriander.<eos> - What's coriander?<eos> - Just don't eat it.

I'd gone out early for a jog, to run off a headache.<eos> It went past me down the beach road.<eos> But you didn't see the driver?<eos> I just recognised the Jeep.<eos> 'I'd seen her driving it.<eos> 'I remember thinking Isla Jonas was starting early.<eos> 'Only, when I got back, I saw the other two were still here.'<eos> What time was this?<eos> Quarter to eight?<eos> So, if you saw the Jeep leave at 7.40 and you saw it again on the beach road a few minutes later, how much longer before you all left the resort?
They also correspond to the end of the tax year, Selwyn, when, as you know, I'm always very keen to donate any excess I have to worthy charitable foundations.<eos> Charitable foundations of which you, presumably, are the patron?<eos> But I suspect, if I were to continue to follow the paper trail, I would inevitably discover just whose pocket that money ends up in.<eos> Why don't you do that, then?<eos> Um, would you mind... showing me your mobile?<eos> I did tell you I had my best team on the job.<eos> They secured this phone from one of our players.<eos> A call had been made to it the day of the semifinal offering a sum of money very similar to the ones you so generously donate to your charitable causes.<eos> The number, naturally, was unregistered.<eos> Shall we dial it?
Still on the road?<eos> They decided to turn the caravan around.<eos> Who made this decision?<eos> The road from Paris is dangerous, especially the royal lands round this lodge.<eos> We cannot have court materials taken hostage.<eos> That is what has happened, Monsieur Louvois.<eos> The masters of the tailor's guild arrived safely. You'd think the king's guard could survive.<eos> We think only of security.<eos> - We merely serve Your Majesty.<eos> If Louvois does not hold his tongue I may volunteer to hold it for him.
Do you allow me? If you stop him, your plan will fail.<eos> If you put him in prison, it will be necessary to put all the noblemen in it.<eos> Let me correct it at least for the affront which he made to you.<eos> If a head is cut, he will grow other one.<eos> Destroying him would lead us to the civil war. The Englishmen have showed us what he costs.<eos> I am not ready yet.<eos> I do not come to carry out my duty, but to thank you. You have kept your word by receiving our guest warmly.<eos> You have been at the height and I am grateful to you for that.<eos> I would like to give you a present.<eos> I accept it!
So consider this merely the repayment of that loan.<eos> - Where is my share?<eos> - I have it right here<eos> Is that enough, or would you like some more?<eos> You murder a noble family on the road and then come to my house.<eos> She knew my voice<eos> How is that even possible?<eos> Unlikely, but I couldn't take the risk.<eos> In any case you wanted chaos.<eos> Now you have it.
Okay, get me another EKG and start her on Amiodarone.<eos> Everything's great.<eos> Baby's heartbeat is fine.<eos> I think you just have a little indigestion.<eos> Hey. Becca, this is Michael.<eos> You need something Michael?<eos> I've done five IVs, ordered tox screens on everybody, cleaned up a lot of vomit.<eos> - But still no therastrap?<eos> - No.<eos> PT needs to order it.
Um, yeah, sure, you can crash. Just, uh, there's a key above the...<eos> - Porch light?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Some things never change.<eos> - See you later.<eos> It's my job, Paul.<eos> That little piece of cesium can kill everyone in this hospital.<eos> Look, you...<eos> you've trained me, Topher.<eos> You know I can remove it.
- Well, here's your chance.<eos> - Ah. - Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I just tweaked my ankle going down the well.<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I'll just put some ice on it.<eos> Do not listen to her.<eos> She passed out from methane.<eos> She needs fluids and a blood-gas.<eos> - And Jordan needs the same test.<eos> - Yes, and I will get it.
It's a surgical procedure I'm not trained in.<eos> So I just have to watch her die?<eos> Let's go!<eos> Heading to the O.R.!<eos> Jordan, rough night?<eos> Yeah, I've had better.<eos> You should've seen your girl in action... total badass.<eos> Not so bad yourself.<eos> Hey, look, I got to get to the O.R., and don't think I didn't see your bike sitting out there.<eos> I-I told you I was gonna buy it.

We'll know more in a couple of hours.<eos> Colonel.<eos> Tell me you beat the hell out of that coward, son-of-a-bitch brother-in-law of mine.<eos> I just did what I needed to do, sir.<eos> Yeah, there was a lot of people there.<eos> You were the only one who acted.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> But we're here to talk about you.<eos> Dr. Bell-Hart assisted in your surgery.<eos> Right, so, Colonel, the bullet ruptured your heart valve, and we replaced it.
Nice!<eos> There you are.<eos> I thought we were gonna - make some money betting at darts.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you know, it's just, uh...<eos> It's a lot of happiness in there.<eos> What's that?<eos> My breast-cancer-gene test.<eos> What did it say?<eos> I haven't opened it yet.
Hey, did you know part of my new job is to do an end-of-shift checklist?<eos> And one of the things that I check is the new pharmacy tracking records.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And according to those records, I took out nebulized antibiotics at 4:47 A.M.<eos> Except I didn't.<eos> Kenny.<eos> You really did that?<eos> Y... you stole my badge?<eos> I didn't steal it, okay.

That bubble reaches the kid's coronary, he's dead.<eos> Increase O² to 100%.<eos> - I'm losing his pulse.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> Okay, I can try to aspirate the air from the atrium.<eos> But, uh, let's place the central line.<eos> No time for that.<eos> He'll be dead by then.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> We take it directly out of the heart.
So we change the plans.<eos> He either leaves London or we attack.<eos> Backing out now makes us look weak.<eos> If we can't get to him at the Elysium, we hit him elsewhere.<eos> We can't be the ones that blink first.<eos> Death or glory?<eos> I owe it to the other guys.<eos> All those who did their bit, then came home to find their city sold from underneath them.<eos> Their neighbourhoods, their communities, even their bloody football teams - all gifted to rich foreigners.<eos> The politicians may have given London away, but we're going to take it back.
I know how you feel right now.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> You know how I feel, huh?<eos> How about--how about I screw your wife?<eos> - And then you can tell me if you know how I feel.<eos> - Let her go.<eos> - No, you're gonna watch.<eos> - No!<eos> - Listen!<eos> Listen, you think I ruined your marriage, but I may have been a part of saving it.
Dana!<eos> How did...<eos> I love you.<eos> Thank you,<eos> Flash.<eos> Dude.<eos> That was insane.<eos> I mean, even I'm having a hard time getting mad at you for dirtying up my suit.<eos> Okay, when are we going to start considering it my suit?<eos> I'd be comfortable calling it our suit.
- Who lives here?<eos> - I got no idea.<eos> But I know they're not at home.<eos> Light on at 11:00 means somebody's home, but a light on at 3:00 in the morning means someone wants burglars to think that somebody's home.<eos> Pull in.<eos> All right, no sign of my car.<eos> No hits on license plate readers.<eos> No helicopters have spotted it.<eos> Safe to assume that he ditched it.<eos> And Russ's phone is apparently off, but if he can manage to turn it on, even for a moment, we can track it that way.

- Let's go.<eos> - Griffin's gonna pin it on you!<eos> Your client just confessed.<eos> Got it all on tape, too.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> They made me say those things.<eos> There was nothing going on with me and that girl.<eos> Sam, why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?<eos> So, how did you end up with her phone?<eos> She left it at my apartment the night before.
Then I want to hear each of your cases against the defendant.<eos> If Rebecca's case went to trial, then the prosecution would have argued that Griffin and Rebecca were so high that they killed Lila after she found them sleeping together.<eos> What if Rebecca acted alone?<eos> In her taped confession, Rebecca stated...<eos> I was standing there watching Griffin pin her down.<eos> "His hands were around her neck."<eos> Meaning Rebecca already knew Lila was strangled even though that was not yet public knowledge.<eos> - Look at this.<eos> - So, how did you end up with her phone?<eos> She left it at my apartment the night before.
- Admiral?<eos> - Sir.<eos> Cancel Infinite Wisdom.<eos> Yes!<eos> Nice job, Larson.<eos> So, uh, what's going to happen with him now?<eos> He will be tried before a jury of his peers, and then hanged until he dies.<eos> We are a democracy.<eos> Right.<eos> The mail plane is out there right now and nobody's watching it.

No, man, all my boys are ride or die.<eos> - Even Broc?<eos> - That's my nigga from way back.<eos> He talk a lot of shit sometime, but at the end of the day, he down.<eos> So you trust him?<eos> Sure.<eos> Yo, I fuckin' love this song, man.<eos> Cesar, my code isn't working.<eos> Yeah, let... let me look.<eos> It says Mrs. St. Patrick changed it this morning.
Just saying, if it's days, she'll smell...<eos> Fuck! What?<eos> - Mickey, Debs, this is Bianca.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Say, is, uh, Lip at school?<eos> He's not in his room, is he?<eos> No.<eos> - What's in the crate?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - You were locking it.
Say, is, uh, Lip at school?<eos> He's not in his room, is he?<eos> No.<eos> - What's in the crate?<eos> - How should I know?<eos> - You were locking it.<eos> - I never touched that lock.<eos> Get your eyes checked.<eos> - True, I was right here.<eos> He never touched it.
I asked for information on the Queen and you failed to provide it.<eos> So I must assume you wish me to speak to your father.<eos> No...<eos> No! The shame... it would kill him.<eos> Please...<eos> I will give you one... last chance.<eos> (Anything, anything.)<eos> I will do anything.<eos> Aramis wears a jewelled crucifix.<eos> Bring it to me.
Oh, my God!<eos> Sir?<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> TREVILLE COUGHS AND CHOKES<eos> A moment, my lady.<eos> What is it?<eos> Have we not said enough to each other today?<eos> I know, forgive me.<eos> My crucifix is missing.<eos> You haven't seen it?
TREVILLE COUGHS AND CHOKES<eos> A moment, my lady.<eos> What is it?<eos> Have we not said enough to each other today?<eos> I know, forgive me.<eos> My crucifix is missing.<eos> You haven't seen it?<eos> Not recently.<eos> I thought perhaps it might be in your chambers.<eos> Don't you know where you last had it?
The only way I, I could.<eos> I cast off my spiritual protections, invited the demon, Pazuzu, in to take my body for a spin.<eos> Unholy bastard's first order of business was to heal its host.<eos> You're possessed by a demon.<eos> I feel surprisingly good.<eos> Demonic permeation's like a flu.<eos> There's an incubation period between first infection and... Full-on possession.<eos> I figure I got a couple of days before it takes up permanent residence.<eos> John, stop.<eos> What if you can't get it out?
It's the only way to stay alive!<eos> They run this place!<eos> Now I run this place!<eos> Now sod off!<eos> You'll do exactly as I tell you.<eos> Start by telling me everything you saw last night.<eos> I only saw after it was over.<eos> The Santa Muerte were dead.<eos> You truly have a devil inside.<eos> I'm just trying to keep it inside this prison.

So...<eos> What's the new plan, John?<eos> There is... No new plan, mate.<eos> There's no time left for a straight-up exorcism.<eos> What about the mill house?<eos> Jasper's defenses might weaken the entity enough - for the ritual to work.<eos> - That might work, but even if we could get John out of here, - that's a 24-hour drive.<eos> - Ah, I'd never make it.<eos> This demon's ready to claw its way out.<eos> Well... unless we can slow it down.
You have the strength.<eos> You shot me to save those babies.<eos> I just need you to summon it up just one last time.<eos> Anne, please.<eos> You're our only hope.<eos> At least try.<eos> Bloody John Constantine.<eos> Center of attention again.<eos> This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us.<eos> If it emerges, don't listen to it.
What the hell is going on with this case?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Good question.<eos> But we have got less than two hours to figure it out.<eos> Which means we got to stop avoiding each other and start working together before Zalman dies.<eos> All right, I'll keep you posted.<eos> Tess is sending forensics.<eos> Any sign of the cooler?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think the thief would have brought it here.

Okay, but even if we can find the heart in time, the same thing's gonna happen to Zalman.<eos> Unless my antidote works.<eos> Antidote?<eos> How do you have an antidote?<eos> Well, I've been working on one for me.<eos> I mean, cool as it is to have a superpower, I really don't want to end up like all the other victims.<eos> I didn't realize that you were worried about this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm not... much.<eos> And I don't even know if the antidote works, so the sooner you get me the heart, the sooner I can try it out.

I know.<eos> Brought up a few issues, didn't it?<eos> Yeah, about how you keep obsessing over the cases?<eos> And how you avoid them.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Maybe marriage counseling isn't such a bad idea.<eos> You were supposed to make sure they didn't find the heart.<eos> And now we have to make sure my husband doesn't get it.
Have you been crying?<eos> No, no. I'm...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> But I can see tears on your face.<eos> Is it because your friend Detective Flass was arrested?<eos> What do you need, Mr. Nygma?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've been suspended and won't be seeing you anymore.<eos> So I wanted to return this pencil.<eos> I took it from your office some time ago.

Maroni wants my scalp and you'd have me redecorate?<eos> This nightclub makes a lot of money.<eos> Without money, we lose influence.<eos> Without influence, we lose control.<eos> And without control, Maroni killing you is no longer a hypothetical, it's a foregone conclusion.<eos> That's why I want to reopen it.<eos> Under your care.<eos> I can have the club?<eos> - It's mine?<eos> - You've earned it.
This was an academic paper that Gerald wrote a few months ago.<eos> He asked me to proof it for him.<eos> See, Gerald had a theory that fear was an evolutionary flaw in humans.<eos> Said that war, rape, theft, murder, it was all caused by fear. He was obsessed with it.<eos> So Crane killed these people and took their glands<eos> - to test a theory?<eos> - No.<eos> Gerald wasn't trying to prove he was right about fear.<eos> He was trying to cure himself of it.<eos> Crane's idea of curing fear was to inoculate himself against it. - Like a disease?
I start a new job in the morning.<eos> A new job?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm coming to work at the GCPD.<eos> I'm your new medical examiner.<eos> I have some questions I need to ask the members of the board.<eos> - What kind of questions?<eos> - About Arkham. It seems very likely those gangsters were actually given their shares in Arkham by Wayne Enterprises.<eos> This nightclub makes a lot of money.<eos> That's why I want to reopen it.
But it won't be necessary.<eos> I've realized there are far better men in the world than Arnold Flass.<eos> So Loeb's been collecting dirt on cops for years and using it to control the department.<eos> I doubt it stops there.<eos> He's probably got leverage on businessmen, politicians.<eos> He's got nothing on me.<eos> Just checking.<eos> Anyway, yeah, that's the source of all his power.<eos> And you want to steal the dragon's gold.<eos> If we find his cache of evidence and destroy it, he'll be toothless.
- Might have needed it for fuel, might have needed it for a weapon.<eos> If he's alien, he might need it to breathe.<eos> Not to breathe.<eos> Only seven intelligent species across the known realms require heightened levels of nitrogen gas, none humanoid.<eos> I learned this as a child. Did you not?<eos> Bobbi, anything?<eos> Sir, we have evidence he's here at the hospital.<eos> It's a big place, though.<eos> He might be hiding anywhere.<eos> Well, we know he needs nitrogen, and they use it in hospitals to power surgical equipment.
You see, we got these kids here, these kids with their whole lives in front of them.<eos> Aren't you gonna help? Hmm?<eos> Are you gonna stand by while we hurt them?<eos> Aw, Phil.<eos> This is between us!<eos> No one else needs to get hurt.<eos> - Let them go.<eos> - They can't go anywhere.<eos> What did you do?<eos> ! Took a cue from S.H.I.E.L.D. we took their potential and contained it,
Do you expect us to believe he's not part of theta protocol?<eos> You can at least tell us what you do know about it.<eos> Coulson doesn't bore me with the details Of every little operation.<eos> May, we know this is massive.<eos> We have evidence that coulson has quietly been moving Alarming amounts of resources and manpower all over the globe.<eos> The only thing we found linking all these activities Is a code name... Theta protocol.<eos> There's no more details he shared with you?<eos> Any director of S.H.I.E.L.D. Has secrets.<eos> We're not talking a few black-bag operations.<eos> Take your entire current budget And match it with this one program.
No one has made it past this stage of our experiments with alien enhancement.<eos> Well, no one other than the twins, of course.<eos> And Strucker has them in Segovia.<eos> Oh, it would be so nice if they were not our only viable subjects.<eos> Well, perhaps he will prove the answer.<eos> - He's due in surgery about now.<eos> - Dr. List.<eos> A cloaked plane is on approach.<eos> Cloaked?<eos> But how can you see it?
When your dad was a boy, he brought back a dead cat and cut it open on the dining-room table!<eos> - Did you kill it?<eos> - No! No, he was on his paper round - and it was just lying there.<eos> - Dad!<eos> And you picked it up?<eos> Well...<eos> I wanted to see how it worked.<eos> - Wanted to see what the heart looked like.<eos> And the lungs and muscles and the blood.<eos> Thing was, the cat had been dead for a few days and when he cut it open, the stink!
Nice cup of tea and a biscuit?<eos> Come on, David.<eos> What about civil liberties?<eos> The press are going to have an absolute field day.<eos> I can see the headlines now - "Vampire police take young men's blood!"<eos> We're not going to ask them to do anything we don't want them to do.<eos> Why would anyone volunteer?<eos> Because the killer of these women is living amongst them.<eos> I can't believe YOU're part of this!<eos> I realise the scale of what I'm asking - a radical new proven science, together with the scientist who invented it.
Never even thought to look at what he was working on.<eos> And the Avengers ... they let one man do whatever he wanted, and the world was almost destroyed for it.<eos> We're SHIELD. We're better than that.<eos> Or at least we should be.<eos> May?<eos> You're awfully quiet.<eos> Gonzales should go.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I asked you to stay and give me advice.<eos> I'd be a fool not to take it.
Why can't you be in there right now?<eos> I told you, we needed someone objective.<eos> I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you.<eos> A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.<eos> - Where did you...?<eos> - SHIELD recovered it from Whitehall's office after his death.<eos> I know that you were separated from your daughter.<eos> I thought that that might belong to her.<eos> A traditional Chinese gift to ward off evil spirits, isn't it?<eos> I never got a chance to give it to her.
- Coulson wouldn't do any...<eos> - I can't do this right now.<eos> I'd like everyone to leave.<eos> I need rest if I'm going to heal.<eos> Her phone's not picking up...<eos> not even voicemail.<eos> Flight records suggest that Bobbi's Quinjet left before the other three.<eos> There's no indication of a crash.<eos> The transponder's offline.<eos> Uh, it's possible that somebody disconnected it, though.
Neither of us would ever do anything to hurt our daughter.<eos> No.<eos> But you'd do anything to protect her.<eos> Look at yourself.<eos> Whatever was in these...<eos> it's killing you.<eos> Was getting rid of you part of her peace plan?<eos> You got it all wrong, Phil.<eos> That little concoction is my own special formula.<eos> I took it of my own free will.
Load the rest on the Quinjet.<eos> We have a problem.<eos> I disabled the communication systems, but an emergency beacon was sent out to Coulson's base.<eos> It's hard-wired, and there's no way to cancel it without the proper code.<eos> Do one of you have the code?<eos> I suggest you surrender peacefully.<eos> When Coulson gets the message, he'll come at you with everything he has.<eos> Coulson's being dealt with.<eos> I don't need you to cancel the beacon.<eos> I want you to expand it.
He's clear of his infection.<eos> You should have checked with me before you went and allocated that heart to Leila Patterson.<eos> I don't need to check with you.<eos> I am the chief of surgery.<eos> You can pull that card all you want, but the fact is that this mix-up is your fault.<eos> While we are in here wasting time, they are extracting that donor heart.<eos> There is no turning back.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Elliot Stout had first priority.<eos> He only lost it because of hospital mistake.
No one ever told me, and I'm not about to ask.<eos> You shouldn't either.<eos> So how is she going to be able to help me?<eos> She won't know until she meets you.<eos> And she might ask you to do certain things.<eos> Like what?<eos> Sort of an evaluation to see what you're made of.<eos> When do I meet her?<eos> Call this number.<eos> Memorize it.
No.<eos> That's Cyrus Petrillo.<eos> Hanna?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Where's Emily?<eos> She left early.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just left my phone at my dad's office and I can't reach anyone.<eos> And you can't go back and get it?
I don't understand it either!<eos> To be honest, I don't believe in ghosts and devils.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Yet you had no problem calling me a devil girl, huh?<eos> Okay, I admit that.<eos> But I really don't believe in such superstitious nonsense.<eos> Now I think I do, though.<eos> I saw Judas' ghost.<eos> Not.<eos> Everyone in the class has seen it.
Cancel them both.<eos> And I shall... cancel them both.<eos> Good night, Mr. Jarvis.<eos> I do wish you'd change your mind and allow me to accompany you.<eos> I can be your second pair of eyes.<eos> I can't imagine there being much danger at the dairy hub.<eos> I'm only going to hunt a truck.<eos> Whoever drove that truck is a man that needs questioning.<eos> Good night.<eos> And how do you plan to find it?
Who writes this rubbish?<eos> I rather enjoy it, actually.<eos> Although, the... the real thing is considerably more impressive.<eos> Are you trying to butter me up, Mr. Jarvis?<eos> Merely pleased to receive your call.<eos> Well, you are faster than a train.<eos> How flattering.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> You did dispose of the old car?<eos> I left it in hoboken with the keys in the ignition.
I may not always be truthful with Anna, but I am always honest.<eos> Difficult balance, that.<eos> One that I imagine you know all too well.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Mr. Brannis couldn't have gone very far with a whole raft full of volatile technology.<eos> Not far at all.<eos> Mr. Brannis' symbol.<eos> Well, she looks to have seen better days.<eos> It's still connected to the electric.<eos> Someone's using it.
You're a woman.<eos> No man will ever consider you an equal.<eos> It's sad, but it doesn't make it any less true.<eos> I can always come to you for the truth.<eos> Good night.<eos> You get it?<eos> What's in the vial?<eos> What vial?<eos> What is in the vial?<eos> You opened it.
Pretty bad for the Navy Cross winner.<eos> Everybody freezes sometimes.<eos> You recovered.<eos> That's the most important thing.<eos> They were carrying a white flag.<eos> The soldiers that came into my camp in Okinawa...<eos> The ones I killed.<eos> They were coming to surrender.<eos> I just didn't realize it until it was too late.<eos> I buried the flag before anyone else saw it.
This is Mr. Stark's bloody inventions.<eos> You're right.<eos> Leviathan tasked Leet Brannis to steal something.<eos> What was it?<eos> The blood.<eos> Well, that's just great.<eos> Screaming baby during the picture?<eos> Oh, don't pay any attention to him, dear.<eos> Dexter, dispose of your litter properly.<eos> Nah! Let somebody else pick it up.
We heard about your work with special children and thought maybe you could help.<eos> Not for free.<eos> His father left a sizeable inheritance.<eos> What about the mother?<eos> Is she dead?<eos> No, she's...<eos> Well, that's another story.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Make the check out to cash.<eos> I'll take it from here.
Matt wouldn't understand.<eos> You know what he would say.<eos> That we're awesome?<eos> No, that we're being stupid.<eos> I prefer the term "foolheartedly provocative."<eos> Yeah, that's lawyer talk for stupid. You want coffee?<eos> If we're gonna be Nancy Drew-ing together, I think a certain level of honesty is required.<eos> What?<eos> You don't like my coffee?<eos> No, I hate it.
Gao reached out.<eos> She'd like a word.<eos> - Send the car around.<eos> - She's coming to you.<eos> Now.<eos> Can you be here before she arrives?<eos> I'm already on my way.<eos> Thank you, Wesley.<eos> She approves of your choice of tea.<eos> I picked it up on my last visit to your country.
And a priest happened by... saw the traveler.<eos> But he moved to the other side of the road and continued on.<eos> And then a Levite, a religious functionary, he... came to the place, saw the dying traveler.<eos> But he too moved to the other side of the road, passed him by.<eos> But then came a man from Samaria, a Samaritan, a good man.<eos> He saw the traveler bleeding in the road and he stopped to aid him without thinking of the circumstance or the difficulty it might bring him.<eos> The Samaritan tended to the traveler's wounds, applying oil and wine.<eos> And he carried him to an inn, gave him all the money he had for the owner to take care of the traveler, as the Samaritan, he... continued on his journey.<eos> He did this simply because the traveler was his neighbor.<eos> He loved his city and all the people in it.
Of course, of course I'm gonna be here.<eos> - He's had a pretty bad setback.<eos> - Right.<eos> We're still trying to pinpoint exactly what happened.<eos> Right now, we're waiting to see how he responds to the medical therapy that we've already given him.<eos> We just want to make sure his heart, his lungs, his kidneys, are as strong as possible before we consider any more treatment.<eos> What kind of treatment?<eos> Um, it could be as simple as taking him up into the cath lab and putting some stents in.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - But... if the valve is part of the problem, we're probably going to have to go back in surgically and repair it.
It's fine, it was just an idea.<eos> Um... see you at home?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Hi.<eos> Yes, I'm here.<eos> I missed you too, honey, so much.<eos> I'm in the baby section.<eos> I got this red sweater for him, it's so beautiful, you have to see it.
- Sure.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Kate!<eos> Look!<eos> They've deleted them.<eos> Give me the key.<eos> Give me the key!<eos> They've changed it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You knew I was here and you changed it!
Overt come-on.<eos> Mildly embarrassed defensiveness bordering on hostility.<eos> Playfully witty sign-off.<eos> This takes me back.<eos> I used to work on old cars as a boy.<eos> Yo, Nutella, could use a hand.<eos> Here.<eos> Which cable controls the elevator's mechanical lock?<eos> The coiled one.<eos> But cutting it will alert Samaritan's operatives.
But it's all good because she's doing great now and I got a new desk.<eos> You're a glass half-full person, aren't you, Barry?<eos> I try. I really do.<eos> Did you really tell everybody they had to go home and use lube?<eos> - That is so...<eos> - Inappropriate.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Well, I have leftovers if you want to try some.<eos> No, no.<eos> I don't have anyone to use it with.
We have been arguing and fighting about her for months, and now you think I would purposely not invite her to our wedding and that somehow you would magically not notice!<eos> All I know is you wouldn't be this mad if you didn't feel guilty about something!<eos> I feel as if I'm flying towards a secret sky without feet.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> - I mean, it tingles.<eos> - And the fragrance?<eos> Ugh!<eos> And the texture...<eos> Well, wait, did you use it with Greg?
But, that is the very reason that this mission is so important.<eos> We have gathered together a coalition of seven nations to bring stability to a region that has suffered from unrest for decades.<eos> It will take time.<eos> And there may be lives that will be lost.<eos> But this is not just important for the Middle East's security, it's important for the security of the United States and the rest of the world.<eos> And I hope that I've answered your question.<eos> Now, who was next?<eos> Uh, let's see here.<eos> Well, how about this young woman right here?<eos> Now, I'll give you my microphone, but only if you promise to give it back.
And I'm prepared to give him both if necessary.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Don't toss the mission aside, Francis.<eos> Claire, you're too invested in this.<eos> The mission is dead.<eos> It was dead the moment those troops got blown up.<eos> Your plan failed.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I approved it.
I'm giving you an opportunity to bow out gracefully, just like Robert.<eos> But you have to do it before the caucus.<eos> I'll give you three days.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The one you asked Doug to destroy.<eos> I wouldn't be so certain that he did it.<eos> So... you're finally one of us.<eos> One of who?<eos> The men. In their smoky back rooms.<eos> And even if there was a journal... you don't have it in you.
- In the bowl up there.<eos> Why didn't you destroy it when I first asked you to?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something stopped me.<eos> Maybe I would need it one day.<eos> For you. To prove my loyalty.<eos> You told her.<eos> I'd hardly call that loyalty.<eos> I had to show her I was serious. The journal was a way to do that.<eos> I never came close to putting it in her possession.
I'm your son.<eos> You haven't been, not for 10 years.<eos> Now, why should things be different?<eos> 'Cause I saw the people you killed for Foster, and it took me 10 years to understand why.<eos> That faith you have in him?<eos> Look, maybe I don't deserve that faith... but neither does Foster.<eos> This isn't necessary.<eos> Colonel, we were just looking for Samuel's stuffed rabbit.<eos> Yeah, I'm familiar with it?<eos> I'm the one that gave it to him, right?
Sexist public commentary, fascist political screeds, taking credit for shutting down websites, hacking into people's cloud-based accounts, sharing their personal content.<eos> What kind of person does that?<eos> Click right there and hear for yourself.<eos> It's the one known recording of Simon Cutler, a customer service call gone very wrong.<eos> Customer service, this is Shanie.<eos> Shanie, perfect!<eos> I've been on hold for 45 minutes.<eos> I'm sorry about that, sir.<eos> Can I have your account number, please?<eos> I've given it.
I won't.<eos> It's, like, for the baby.<eos> Okay, you should get off the bus.<eos> Mm-hmm...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hello?<eos> Ms. Villanueva, this is sister Margaret.<eos> Oh, oh, is this about the gift?<eos> Because if I'm not allowed to accept gifts,<eos> - I will return it immediately.
Indicates... a struggle.<eos> Most likely, a crime of passion.<eos> Detectives canvassed the hotel guests.<eos> Nobody heard or saw anything.<eos> Crime scene lifted a few prints.<eos> Most belonged to the victim, the rest to housekeeping.<eos> However,<eos> I did find this in the plumbing.<eos> The victim's cell phone.<eos> The target tried to destroy it and then flush it.
Which means he already made a mistake that will lead us right to him.<eos> We are gonna find Adel Foster's murderer.<eos> You know, I really could have used these things two years ago.<eos> But you know every time Apple introduces a new device, there's a new cord, a new connector, and then all the old stuff is not compatible with the new stuff, so then you... you know, you got to go back, buy all the new Apple products, connect them and...<eos> Dude, dude, really?<eos> We're trying to work here.<eos> Okay, well, then give me something to do.<eos> Here.<eos> Lay out all the pieces of this cell phone.<eos> Disassemble it, remove the circuit board, then scrub the resistor jumper connections.
My God.<eos> Even when women get the courage to leave abusive relationships, sometimes they still get killed.<eos> So what's his next move?<eos> Well, he's angry.<eos> He's calculated.<eos> He's got nothing to lose.<eos> And he's armed and dangerous.<eos> I just hit a dead end.<eos> Tillman's phone's not showing a signal.<eos> He must have turned it off.
Let her go and put down the gun.<eos> He killed my girlfriend, and you did nothing.<eos> You set him free.<eos> At the count of three, I'm gonna discharge this weapon.<eos> You need to decide what you're gonna do.<eos> One, two...<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> Now kick it towards me.
!<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Uh, there was a cup in the middle of the floor.<eos> Hey, welcome back.<eos> Good job.<eos> He has been preoccupied with a little spider.<eos> What is all that?<eos> What?<eos> Some compressed air.<eos> I was gonna turn it over, zap it, freeze it, then I was gonna set it free.
He has been preoccupied with a little spider.<eos> What is all that?<eos> What?<eos> Some compressed air.<eos> I was gonna turn it over, zap it, freeze it, then I was gonna set it free.<eos> Aw. Cryonic preservation?<eos> I'm not hunting that thing down again.<eos> Okay, I will help you look for your spider.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll find it, and Elijah will arrest it.
Yes, but this product will work.<eos> It comes from the United States.<eos> So it must be good.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Serve your future husband first.<eos> Thank you, Maria.<eos> What's going on with Maria?<eos> Might be the snake-repellent.<eos> It smells too strong.<eos> Do you smell it?
I'm telling you, it won't work.<eos> Go on, do it right!<eos> It's the flame of life.<eos> I can't do anything.<eos> It is his destiny to live.<eos> We must tell your father.<eos> Tie it tightly.<eos> Hide your belly.<eos> Another magazine?<eos> Ignacio gave it to me.
Go on, do it right!<eos> It's the flame of life.<eos> I can't do anything.<eos> It is his destiny to live.<eos> We must tell your father.<eos> Tie it tightly.<eos> Hide your belly.<eos> Another magazine?<eos> Ignacio gave it to me.<eos> Don't burn it before I finish looking at it.
He called it the Night Room.<eos> It's an off-site lab with his teeny tiny little secret locked inside.<eos> The virus.<eos> I knew where it was.<eos> But I wouldn't say.<eos> I saw the blood.<eos> The voices came back screaming and... and one by one...<eos> Something broke inside me.<eos> I couldn't speak.<eos> And then I saw someone running away... the only other one of us who could find it... the one that got away.
- Maybe I killed him too.<eos> - No.<eos> No, that was someone else.<eos> Been here ever since.<eos> 773 days locked in a cell, apologizing to ghosts.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Jennifer, listen to me.<eos> The Army of the 12 Monkeys are gonna steal the virus from that lab.<eos> They're gonna use it to kill everyone.
- No.<eos> No, that was someone else.<eos> Been here ever since.<eos> 773 days locked in a cell, apologizing to ghosts.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Jennifer, listen to me.<eos> The Army of the 12 Monkeys are gonna steal the virus from that lab.<eos> They're gonna use it to kill everyone.<eos> You need to tell me where it is so I can find it.
All that brutality... you haven't found it either.<eos> 12's not primary!<eos> Bring her.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - We need to go.<eos> - All right.<eos> - "The Night Room." - Yeah.<eos> She said that's where her father kept the virus.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And Jennifer is how the 12 Monkeys are gonna find it.
- Cassie, stay on the line!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Somebody just grabbed Cassie.<eos> Put the car in gear.<eos> Drive us out of here.<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I have a knife.<eos> I have a knife.<eos> I do not want to use it, but I will if I have to.
Truly, for the last time, tell us how to find the Night Room.<eos> It's in Westminster, Maryland.<eos> - _ - Leland Goines' black budget lab.<eos> Cassie found it using records from the CDC.<eos> She needs to confirm it.<eos> I'm supposed to meet her there.<eos> On a first name basis with Dr. Railly now?<eos> This is the only lab we found that uses that specific type of containment system.<eos> That's gotta be where Leland kept the virus.<eos> And where you'll destroy it.
Let him go. Let him go.<eos> Can't save everyone.<eos> I thought that was the point.<eos> - They're going to kill us.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> Look, I don't care about living through the next two hours.<eos> The plague is right down there.<eos> This is why I'm here.<eos> This is what I came here for.<eos> We've gotten this far, we have to get down there and destroy it.
Okay, take that one.<eos> I saw one upstairs.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Come on.<eos> Open it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> How about the fail-safe?<eos> Jennifer, the virus in there is gonna kill everyone.<eos> - We need to destroy it.
Shit!<eos> I should have got the license plate.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's the number on the back of the car.<eos> 7XYD42.<eos> Wait a minute, you sure?<eos> Yeah. Why?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm calling in a favor.<eos> You didn't get it.
Do you want to talk about it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm sorry, Cass.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's over now.<eos> No, I wasn't there for you.<eos> The past two years... you were alone with all of this... and you were right.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> The virus is still out there.<eos> They're gonna find it, and we have to stop them.
It's over now.<eos> No, I wasn't there for you.<eos> The past two years... you were alone with all of this... and you were right.<eos> So what happens now?<eos> The virus is still out there.<eos> They're gonna find it, and we have to stop them.<eos> Operation Troy.<eos> What's that?<eos> I don't know exactly, but... but I think it's what we're looking for.<eos> Who took it?
Those remains in the Night Room... They were human? Yeah.<eos> Jennifer said it was the origin of the virus.<eos> We destroyed it.<eos> It's gone.<eos> Yet the virus is still out there.<eos> This Operation Troy, the one that I... She told you about...<eos> The other you said it's how the virus starts in 2015, somewhere in Chechnya.<eos> No, no, but not anymore, because you saved Dr. Railly, and the plague is, as it always was, in 2016.<eos> But whatever this Operation Troy is, it involves the very same virus.<eos> And, perhaps, if the 12 Monkeys didn't find it in the Night Room, they found it there.
There's intel that he's hiding out in Chechnya.<eos> Who are you guys talking about?<eos> Adam Wexler, former CIA analyst.<eos> He's been leaking classified secrets.<eos> Senator Royce insinuated Operation Troy was connected to Wexler.<eos> They're gonna use the virus to kill him.<eos> The agency had some kind of deal with Leland Goines.<eos> This could be the Markridge virus.<eos> M5-10, the strain you were talking about.<eos> The CIA would use it to kill one of their own?
They're gonna use the virus to kill him.<eos> The agency had some kind of deal with Leland Goines.<eos> This could be the Markridge virus.<eos> M5-10, the strain you were talking about.<eos> The CIA would use it to kill one of their own?<eos> Must be way off book.<eos> It's why I haven't been able to dig anything up.<eos> Jones was right.<eos> The 12 monkeys know the virus is going to be in Chechnya.<eos> They're going to send someone there to try to get it.
Cole just called from Chechnya.<eos> He has the virus, but someone is trying to kill him.<eos> Operation Troy is happening right now.<eos> He said something about you and me giving him the details a week from now.<eos> It's impossible, I haven't...<eos> We have to call someone.<eos> We have to tell the CIA, now.<eos> Listen to me, Mike.<eos> At my house, there's an envelope, top desk drawer.<eos> Go right now and get it.

I was.<eos> This hasn't happened for you yet but it has for me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - In a week's time,<eos> Aaron is going to come into the bookstore and tell us that Operation Troy has already happened.<eos> But Aaron doesn't know anything about...<eos> He doesn't know now.<eos> But one week into your future, he will know.<eos> He'll know exactly how to intercept the virus, because it will already have happened.<eos> That's how the two of you help me to get back to today, to stop it.
We need to torch this place.<eos> Everything.<eos> You have no idea what you've just done.<eos> No.<eos> But you're gonna tell me.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Put me on the phone with Cole right now.<eos> - Not happening.<eos> I know there's a virus.<eos> It's not going where you sent it.
I can use this to get the courier before he delivers the virus.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, I gotta go, but good luck.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, it was good work.<eos> This could actually work.<eos> I need to write the names of these streets down.<eos> I won't remember them.<eos> What is this, anyway, Russian?<eos> All right, so once I get the virus, how do I destroy it?
I think this thing is some kind of battery.<eos> - Battery? - As in Wells was using it to power himself.<eos> To gain more speed.<eos> And that's why he's so much faster than you.<eos> The accelerator, it's been reactivated.<eos> - It can't be.<eos> - How is that possible?<eos> It blew up.<eos> It had to have been rebuilt.<eos> Wells. Even if he did rebuild it, how did Dr. Wells turn the particle accelerator on?
"Why does nobody understand me like you do?<eos> Have a great holiday.<eos> I miss you."<eos> Thank you.<eos> And the transcript of 16 May, please.<eos> "I know your dad will be sorry for hitting you.<eos> You can talk to me any time."<eos> What evidence do you have to prove that Mr Miller was using his phone at the time the calls and messages were sent?<eos> They were sent from his private number.<eos> Someone else could have picked up the phone and used it.
Phone mast records have placed the phone at Mr Miller's house.<eos> The computer with the email account used to correspond with Danny, was that a private computer?<eos> It was Mr Miller's home computer.<eos> It was the family computer, wasn't it?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> ~ Was it password protected?<eos> No, but we believe Mr Miller was the main user of the computer.<eos> But not the sole user because it was the family computer.<eos> Accessible to anyone who lived in or visited the house.<eos> Well, I doubt the baby used it.
~ You built a bloody house there!<eos> ~ I see the families every month. I write, phone and visit.<eos> ~ I didn't run!<eos> ~ I had no choice.<eos> No-one stood up for me.<eos> ~ Maybe you should've made more friends.<eos> ~ Like you and Dave (? )<eos> Right, I'm gonna leave.<eos> Don't be late for dinner.<eos> Daisy's looking forward to it.
~ It was obvious what had happened.<eos> Why didn't you call the police?<eos> I didn't want to dump Nigel in it.<eos> How do you explain police forensics finding four cigarette butts with your DNA on them next to Danny's body?<eos> I've smoked a lot of cigarettes on that beach.<eos> ~ Why did you take the skateboard?<eos> ~ I thought it might get nicked.<eos> It did get nicked, didn't it?<eos> By you!<eos> I thought the family would want it back.
We're gonna set a fire under her.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hi, it's me.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Like you care.<eos> I saw the photograph, Claire.<eos> Why were you wearing a pendant belonging to Pippa Gillespie?<eos> It wasn't Pippa's.<eos> It was mine.<eos> My gran gave it to me.
Meanwhile, we're in the middle of the sticks.<eos> And I forgot my phone.<eos> And I'm hungry.<eos> Of everyone here, who would you eat first?<eos> I think first I'd ask if someone could spare an apple.<eos> Or half a sandwich.<eos> I was watching TV on Saturday and I saw an egg salad sandwich.<eos> And I was like, "I loved egg salad when I was alive."<eos> There's gotta be an equivalent I can make.<eos> Vegans can pull it off with tofu, so why can't I do it with brains?
Unless I get him out of here.<eos> Jim, Jim, Jim, Jim.<eos> - I could use some help. - No way.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> He's a bad man, but he's the best bad man we got.<eos> If Falcone loses control,<eos> Maroni's too wild to run Gotham.<eos> There'll be anarchy.<eos> Yeah, probably, but Falcone already lost control.<eos> And he'll get it back.
He is... so weird.<eos> (so... so...)<eos> Beautiful, huh?<eos> I'm gonna miss this town.<eos> You won't change your mind?<eos> - The town needs you.<eos> - No. Gotham needs a lawman now, not a criminal like me.<eos> A strong lawman.<eos> You looking at me?<eos> Someone needs to grab this city by the neck and shake it hard.
That's you, Jim.<eos> I know it in my bones.<eos> There's a lot of powerful men who would disagree with you on that.<eos> Nice knife, huh?<eos> That was your father's.<eos> He gave it to me a long time ago.<eos> A spur-of-the-moment birthday gift.<eos> I said no.<eos> Such a beautiful knife and I have men with guns to protect me.<eos> He said: "Take it.
But I would support - you making the move.<eos> - Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I sent the samples over to Hodges, and I'm heading out.<eos> All right.<eos> See you later.<eos> Mom, what did you get me this time?<eos> Castor and Pollux.<eos> The twins.<eos> Did you get my present?<eos> If you wanted my attention, you've got it.
- Perfect.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No, you can't be here.<eos> Nice to see you too.<eos> It's not over?<eos> No, it's not.<eos> You're alive.<eos> So are you.<eos> The virus is still out there.<eos> 12 Monkeys got their hands on it somehow.
The petals... that's how I found Jeremy.<eos> What's with our Tall Man and flowers?<eos> He uses them to mask the smell of death.<eos> It's an old plague trick.<eos> That's not Peters.<eos> It's his husband.<eos> Peters is gone.<eos> They must've gotten to him first.<eos> And his hard drive.<eos> We destroyed the virus, but not the man who made it.
That sounds like Foster.<eos> You getting superstitious on me?<eos> I don't think that God's wrath requires my belief.<eos> What if I have to choose? Injections or Ramse?<eos> We need those injections.<eos> I don't want any trouble.<eos> I just have a few questions.<eos> That symbol.<eos> The face.<eos> I know it.
He was never synchronized.<eos> We have no tracer signal.<eos> His trip was one way.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This treatment was a temporary solution for your condition.<eos> It just gives us one more jump.<eos> James... we are out of time.<eos> 1987 is the endgame.<eos> You must find the source of the plague and you must eliminate it.
Only choice we had.<eos> But... do you know what the first rule of hustling is?<eos> Supply and demand.<eos> (laughter) Hey, who said that? COOKIE:<eos> That's right, baby.<eos> Smart man.<eos> That's right-- you create your own customer base. Give them some of that good stuff. Make 'em want more.<eos> You see, Lucious did that with music.<eos> He created... a sound.<eos> They call it "the Lucious Lyon sound."
Nice to see you again, John.<eos> We must be on our way.<eos> Right, chief?<eos> Put her in gear.<eos> Say hi to Martin.<eos> Gently now!<eos> Treat her like a lady...<eos> ...just with the gearstick.<eos> Bye.<eos> Put it in here.
What, you're psychic now?<eos> Ten minutes ago, patrol responded to a homicide in Kips Bay.<eos> Some guy wearing the same kind of mask knocked on a woman's door and killed her as she opened it.<eos> I'm guessing that's the guy we're looking for.<eos> Alana Robbins.<eos> 26, Rhode Island license.<eos> The neighbors all describe the killer as the guy with the heavy coat and mask we saw in Duane Park.<eos> Stabbing's a different M.O., though.<eos> Yeah, but I think this was plan B.<eos> Killer must have got the gun jammed, tossed it over here.
Yeah, like what?<eos> Like to trust me.<eos> This ought to warm you up.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait, cut.<eos> Cut!<eos> She seems talented.<eos> I'll be sure to let Linda know you're a fan.<eos> I'm just saying, I recognize a talent when I see it.
-Hello!<eos> -Hey!<eos> How's it going?<eos> -Going alright, what about you?<eos> -Not bad.<eos> -Did Pejdan leave some tools here?<eos> -No.<eos> -Nah, he didn't leave shit.<eos> -We've got to fix Jonny's camper.<eos> -He's gonna sell it.
-I'm not, not at all.<eos> -I heard you and Benneth talk<eos> -Just now, yeah.<eos> But I didn't before.<eos> Like... I don't get it...<eos> I'm trying to get the car started so you can go meet your boy.<eos> -Goddamnit!<eos> -Pull the choke lever.<eos> The bracelet too?<eos> Did you steal it?
- It's not funny. - Just messing with you.<eos> - This way.<eos> Okay.<eos> If Tyler did send you that yearbook, we're following a dead man's trail.<eos> Great, or a live man's trap.<eos> Who's to say a woman couldn't torture and kill just as well as a man?<eos> Well, it was a man's voice that called me.<eos> A voice like this?<eos> $1.99 voice-changer app.<eos> We used it for Rachel's zombie movie.
Noah, do you have any idea where Audrey is?<eos> She's not answering her phone.<eos> She's taking the midterm she missed in the clink.<eos> Her phone's off.<eos> You okay?<eos> No, not really.<eos> - Look, Will needs help.<eos> - Finding his moral compass?<eos> No, finding his phone.<eos> Do you have any idea how to track it?
I never thought I'd say this... but you got to be more careful.<eos> You found the truck.<eos> It entered Maple and never left.<eos> Shaw's still here in town.<eos> We're close.<eos> Welcome to Maple.<eos> What brings you to town?<eos> Catching up with a friend.<eos> How long you two had this place?<eos> Laura bought it a half year ago.
Answer the question, Chief.<eos> Setup's buggy, video disappears time to time.<eos> Not recently, though.<eos> When footage is corrupted, is it concentrated to a geographic area?<eos> How should I know?<eos> What's this got to do with anything in my juris--<eos> You talk so much and say so little.<eos> I found the truck.<eos> It has an eagle-shaped hood ornament.<eos> I spoke to a rest stop waitress who had seen it.
Man, get back inside!<eos> What are you, crazy?<eos> Little bit, but I didn't come out just for you.<eos> I do not trust D'avin.<eos> If he was the last man in the universe, I wouldn't trust him.<eos> Our proximity to the storm is interfering with the device.<eos> - Its components are finely...<eos> - Shut up! Lucy, you have to start the engine!<eos> - The device won't let me.<eos> - OK, override it!
By their capacity to visit evil on each other.<eos> And you'll be the judge and carry out the sentence?<eos> As the Angel of Death passed over Egypt and took the pharaoh's firstborn.<eos> As the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah were burned for their wickedness.<eos> As the waters of the great flood washed the world clean of man's iniquity.<eos> My blade will cleanse humanity of its ills.<eos> The Horseman is first.<eos> Along with that witch that sided with him.<eos> Wait, Katrina is not evil.<eos> There is no room in this world for those that harbor it.
Stop it now.<eos> There, stopped.<eos> Early this morning in New York, a high speed car collision erupted in a dangerous shootout involving four private security contractors and a man and woman wearing ski masks.<eos> Senator Garrison.<eos> There's a problem.<eos> 22 minutes ago, ISA operatives in Detroit raided a four-man sleeper cell and only found three targets.<eos> The fourth, Yasin Said, remains at large, and Mr. Travers, our Samaritan representative, just shut down Research.<eos> Hold on, there's a terrorist in Detroit?<eos> And we can't access Research or the terrorist's hard drive.<eos> Travers won't let us see it.
These guys in Detroit weaponized a piece of computer code.<eos> You mean like a virus?<eos> Like a nuclear virus.<eos> Samaritan quarantined the code to protect itself.<eos> I should be allowed to view the material.<eos> You wouldn't understand it anyway, so what's the point?<eos> Who the hell do you think you are, Travers?<eos> Mr. Travers is my eyes and ears inside your operation.<eos> We gave you a marvelous car.<eos> Surely, you didn't think I'd let you drive it yourselves.
Surely, you didn't think I'd let you drive it yourselves.<eos> Of course I did.<eos> You said we would.<eos> As for your missing terrorist,<eos> Samaritan has tracked him to an address in Detroit, but he won't stay there long.<eos> I'm wondering, would you like Mr. Travers to put the key back in the ignition?<eos> Samaritan found the terrorist.<eos> How about that-- the hard drive was irrelevant after all.<eos> If we want the intelligence back on, we need to let this go.<eos> Turn it back on.
I don't like to play. Well, you don't, but you are not you.<eos> No, you are a beefy lake-house owner in town for the sailing convention, and you are hungry.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I just had grapes. Damn it!<eos> ♪ I'll cut ya, headbutt ya ♪ Mom, Eddie's rapping at my always-there bear.<eos> Did they give you that pin for narc-ing?<eos> No, that's tattle-turtle.<eos> This is for the school's best attendance record.<eos> Why is this billboard so far away?<eos> You could have put it here.
Jessica?<eos> Here you are.<eos> I was waiting downstairs.<eos> We should go. We'll be late for our reservation.<eos> And whose fault is that?<eos> - You look bad.<eos> - I need money.<eos> You can have my TV.<eos> Thanks, Malcolm.<eos> You keep it.
Here you are.<eos> I was waiting downstairs.<eos> We should go. We'll be late for our reservation.<eos> And whose fault is that?<eos> - You look bad.<eos> - I need money.<eos> You can have my TV.<eos> Thanks, Malcolm.<eos> You keep it.<eos> - I stole it.
You have to take it now, all right?<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm gonna have to give it to you if you don't take it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Listen to me. Here.<eos> She's guilty.<eos> Mmm. She had a gun in her purse.<eos> It was premeditated.<eos> She aimed it at her parents and pulled the trigger repeatedly.
I'm sorry, I don't discuss cases.<eos> You took pictures.<eos> It's called "Private investigations" For a reason.<eos> All I can think is you hired yourself to get rid of Luke's women, thin out the competition.<eos> You jealous? Some kind of stalker?<eos> I'm not a stalker.<eos> Luke said Andre knew.<eos> 'Course, he knows now that I asked him about it.<eos> Look, I'm sorry that you screwed up your marriage, but...<eos> You screwed it up, digging around.
He wore a white dress shirt...<eos> - Intense eyes.<eos> - ...and a tie.<eos> A red T-shirt...<eos> I think.<eos> He never wears a shirt.<eos> He's hot.<eos> I was waiting for the L train.<eos> And he said, uh, "Nice jacket.<eos> You wanna give it to me, right?"
I'll call you when I find him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me ten minutes to clear the area.<eos> It was Hogarth.<eos> Who cut the wire.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Process of elimination.<eos> You got some, um...<eos> Shit.<eos> I bought Jessica her bloody childhood home and restored it perfectly.
It has.<eos> It's really quite extraordinary.<eos> The stem cells have inherited some of your genes.<eos> But will it work?<eos> Well, we need to do another test when it's ready.<eos> - Why is it not ready now?<eos> - Because I'm tired!<eos> If you'd let me rest, I could focus better.<eos> Dad... go to the blender.<eos> Turn it on.
Get out of here.<eos> New York State Liquor Authority.<eos> Undercover.<eos> We got reports of underage drinking in here.<eos> We ID everyone at the door.<eos> Oh, including those underage high school girls doing shots of Jäger in the front row last night?<eos> Well, you got bad info.<eos> Then you got nothing to hide.<eos> We need to see video of the show.<eos> You want a raid, you got it.
Right?<eos> Come on.<eos> He was fishing for money.<eos> He needs to raise $6 million to make the movie.<eos> He said he had all the money lined up.<eos> Yeah, he was bluffing.<eos> When you took the call, he hit me up for a million, and asked if I knew any other retired ballplayers who might be interested.<eos> Does he...<eos> Even want to make the movie?<eos> If I finance it, yeah.
Hey, let me use your phone.<eos> I'm waiting for a call.<eos> What's wrong with yours?<eos> It's out of minutes.<eos> - It's important.<eos> - So is the call that I'm waiting for.<eos> What, your boyfriend?<eos> I have to call Robbie's lawyer about getting him out.<eos> You remember Robbie, the guy who got busted because of you.<eos> You can borrow it as soon as I'm done with my call.
I know how painful it is.<eos> Wait.<eos> They took everything but this.<eos> I don't know what it is or where it opens.<eos> But I know Greg wouldn't have wanted them to have it.<eos> Hey, Liat, I need a favor.<eos> Just between us.<eos> I'm gonna send you a picture of a key.<eos> It has a serial number on it.<eos> I need you to try and track it for me.
I'm more pissed about you leaving, after you promised to teach Giddy math.<eos> If he fails his test, it's on you.<eos> Here.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's your case.<eos> In a couple of days...<eos> Maybe a week, maybe a month, your suspected killer in there is gonna be found dead in his cell.<eos> They'll tell you he killed himself like Yussef Khalid, and the case will be closed.<eos> The real answer lies in whatever this key fits.<eos> Just take it.
I could get sued.<eos> There isn't an NDA on this planet that can protect against criminal activity.<eos> BELL:<eos> That's Marissa Ledbetter.<eos> She was a nurse, too.<eos> These are the men that signed up for the study.<eos> Two of them are missing.<eos> Two of them are dead.<eos> Their families don't have closure.<eos> You can help us bring it to 'em.
Wait, what do you mean "and"?<eos> Well, it's against the law to drive with an expired license.<eos> Yes, yes, yes, yes,<eos> I get that.<eos> When was the last time you were in Blairsville?<eos> I try never to go, but I think I was there six months ago on official business.<eos> - Did you get a parking ticket?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - You did.<eos> And you didn't pay it.
Emily, where are you?<eos> At the house.<eos> Are you alone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> The FBI there?<eos> Put them on the phone.<eos> Kyle, Ryan Hardy.<eos> Love your house, man.<eos> Too bad you're never gonna see it again.
Okay?<eos> I'll stay here with you.<eos> Please.<eos> Bring her back.<eos> She's all I have.<eos> I put your sleep demon to bed.<eos> A deal is a deal.<eos> Let's have the girl's soul, Faust.<eos> Yes, I felt the power return.<eos> But our deal was to banish the beast to hell... you destroyed it by energy dispersion.
'Cause that one over there's his mother, but this one, he's gonna be a bull one day.<eos> Might as well get used to it, right?<eos> We'll need to hurry to town if you want to catch the last night bus.<eos> Or you're welcome to bunk in our guest room, get a fresh start in the morning.<eos> If it's not too much trouble, we'd love to stay.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So this is what you were telling me about.<eos> The meteorite contains every element known to man, plus one we've never seen before.<eos> But every time we try to extract it, let's just say it becomes very volatile.
Weird... there's only a couple of buildings.<eos> Like an industrial ghost town.<eos> The power plant looks like the only one intact.<eos> Maybe Vera's there.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing, I'm just...<eos> I've been forgetting things lately.<eos> Names, memories of my childhood.<eos> Joshua says it could be a cost of my gift.<eos> Makes me not want to use it so much.
The Rapture isn't gonna happen on our watch.<eos> You've got balls.<eos> Unfortunately, your fellow Messengers are gonna have a hard time stopping the Rapture with one less among their ranks.<eos> It's glowing blue again.<eos> Like earlier.<eos> While you were spirit-walking, perhaps?<eos> The Genesis element hasn't changed its appearance at all before today.<eos> But now, for some reason, it's behaving quite differently.<eos> Based on what I know about this woman and her friends, I bet I know why.<eos> Move it closer to me.
He's alive.<eos> How am I even supposed to be sure that you have my son?<eos> - Mom!<eos> - Sweetie.<eos> Give me back my daughter.<eos> You lost the right to call her that when you dragged her halfway across the country.<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> They're probably gonna use the Genesis element as some sort of weapon to break the Fifth Seal.<eos> This element in the right hands... our hands... it could be a force for good, I know it.<eos> When I was distilling it, I felt this rush of positive energy.
We're a long way from saying this happened to George by another's hand.<eos> Where's the gun then?<eos> I'd check in on Trey Willis, if I was you.<eos> You're gonna be residing at your sister's at the Hollingdale apartments?<eos> And you're gonna be there until?<eos> I go into exile.<eos> For a month?<eos> 24 days, to be exact.<eos> You're gonna need her to sign this and return it to me by Wednesday at the latest.<eos> If you know her primary number, you can go ahead and fill it in now.
This part of my life continued to develop, and it was much more satisfying than the rock.<eos> In one of the tropical moon caves, I found an abandoned nest of eggs.<eos> It's purple!<eos> You open the lids like that and it comes off.<eos> What is that?<eos> A monster.<eos> That's his mouth?<eos> No, that's his mouth.<eos> Stop it you silly thing!<eos> I named it Simon.
Nonsense, your master may be down but you're not poor and you've got everything below in good working order, haven't you?<eos> Alice, what have I told you about drinking wine?<eos> Your nose is glowing.<eos> Why am I bringing you to Westminster?<eos> I'm off to see Lady Anne.<eos> You didn't say so.<eos> I can't tell you all my plans, Stephen.<eos> What would young Wriothesley have to do, then?<eos> Oh, dear God, I'm starving.<eos> I wish I'd lain hands on the white rabbit. I'd eat it raw.
- With Alice?<eos> -Apparently not.<eos> You keep spies in his house too?<eos> Don't you ever think of getting married, Stephen?<eos> I'm in holy orders.<eos> Oh, come on, you must have women.<eos> What kind of a Putney inquiry is that?<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> I like your grey velvet.<eos> Where did you get it?
~ Did you give permission for this?<eos> ~ No.<eos> ~ Did your wife know?<eos> There you go, bonny lad.<eos> Don't say I never gave you nowt.<eos> ~ Mine's a pint.<eos> ~ Cheers, gaffer.<eos> ~ Good man.<eos> All right.<eos> Where did you dump it?
A Saracen, apparently has experience of what we hunt.<eos> Is that so?<eos> He's a bad omen.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Sign?<eos> Several bodies were dragged through here, away from the path.<eos> We go on foot from here.<eos> Feel like looking for a needle in a haystack.<eos> Saracen. What do you know of this beast?<eos> We called it, jinn.
Saracen. What do you know of this beast?<eos> We called it, jinn.<eos> Huh?<eos> It's mean, demon.<eos> Have you actually encountered one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?
Ugh, we got 12 more in isolation beds as we speak.<eos> And it's getting worse.<eos> You know, Catherine's right.<eos> This thing can't be a coincidence.<eos> Our neighborhood, her precinct, the hospital--<eos> I mean, it's all too close to home for my liking.<eos> Yeah, well, it's closer than you think.<eos> Take a look at this.<eos> Studying the parasite sample, I thought I recognized something in the way it mutated the victim's DNA.<eos> I wasn't sure, but then I compared it to the serum sample in the earlier victims.
You're telling me you don't have mine now?<eos> Is that how you want to play this?<eos> Come on.<eos> I'm just looking for a little professional courtesy.<eos> I'll see what I can do, Bill.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I don't understand why you have to write the damn report.<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> I'll write it, D.C. will ignore it, and we'll get on with our lives.
See you later.<eos> I'm guessing by your look that you just talked to Peterson.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> I worked for him about ten years ago when he was running a task force on the border.<eos> Rio Bravo station.<eos> We were working with the Mexican police, trying to do something about the cartels.<eos> Tough work.<eos> It was war.<eos> The Zeta cartel would send their men out dressed like soldiers.<eos> They would wait for a bus to come through, stop it, force all the passengers off, and shoot them.
Yo, V... smile, motherfucker. Don't give him a reason to shoot.<eos> You ever hear of probable cause, Officer?<eos> Come on, T, don't fuck with the officer. He's got plenty of probable cause.<eos> - And what's that?<eos> - TOMMY:<eos> DWB. Driving while black, on account of my friend over there.<eos> Sorry, Officer. I'll never drive while black again.<eos> Cute.<eos> But this van was identified as a vehicle used in the commission of a crime.<eos> I will be searching it.
He's got a job to do, same as you do.<eos> I worry about him having your ear.<eos> Well, don't.<eos> Look, I like you; I respect you; in many ways, I genuinely look up to you.<eos> But I think you have a blind spot when it comes to how you view your command.<eos> Do you, now?<eos> Yes.<eos> And lately I think you put too much emphasis on how you're connected to your officers and not enough emphasis on how you're connected to, and perceived by, the rest of the world out there.<eos> It does matter.<eos> Bring me the release when you have it, please.
Ok.<eos> Ok.<eos> They dumped his cell phone a block away.<eos> We're pulling traffic cam footage, see if we can identify what they're driving.<eos> Well, it's got to be the couple from the hotel.<eos> They must have been taking him to that garage to be tortured, which means they're looking for a backup location now.<eos> So we've got a small window to find them before they go underground.<eos> We have an incoming Skype call.<eos> It's Mark Gray.<eos> Trace it.
- a few things in it before...<eos> - I'm sure I'll love it.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Mayor, esteemed council members.<eos> It's... a pleasure to be here with you today for the opening of our first Freedom Center<eos> "I know that most of you didn't come here "to listen to some blowhard "congratulate himself on what he's done<eos> "You came here to get food and necessities for your families... "and we're going to let you do that in a moment... "but I think it's worth reflecting on the quality<eos> "you all have in common. "You are the survivors.<eos> "You're the ones who didn't run, "who hung on.<eos> "Why?<eos> "Because as much as we all love to bitch "about our city, we're not about to let anyone "or anything take it from us.
For what?<eos> - Infractions, attitude, disrespect.<eos> That was you, I'm betting.<eos> Oh, I gave them a lot of lip, ran away all the time, too... - other stuff. - Other stuff?<eos> Like what?<eos> Fighting mostly.<eos> I was mad 24/7.<eos> I'd kick your ass if you bumped me in the lunch line or talked shit about my mother.<eos> So, I spent a lot of time in the trunk... so did Waits.<eos> If that notation's not in the file, put it aside.
Watching everyone move on, and wondering why you can't.<eos> Losing Thomas was probably the hardest thing I've ever been through.<eos> I guess back then, I got pretty good at compartmentalizing things when I was practicing focusing on the patient, not the person.<eos> You weren't here to see it, but I just completely shut down.<eos> April had to move home to keep the family functioning.<eos> It's not an easy recovery.<eos> Well, that's what we're here for.<eos> I'm just now being able to put things behind me, despite all of Thomas' secrets.<eos> Do you know the girls were asking about some manuscript of Thomas', something he was working on before he died.<eos> Did you read it?
Brains count for more than muscles.<eos> Long live women's rights and all that, but it's not a good idea to take on a job that wears you out.<eos> - I'm doing it now, aren't I?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But you'll be dead by the year's end at this rate.<eos> I suppose we only know what we're capable of when we test our limits.<eos> And we certainly know what you're capable of.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Isobel, what's Granny done wrong?<eos> We're to have a fight about the hospital, and she began it by concealing the facts.
And for what it's worth, I wish you the best of luck, Mr Carson.<eos> Thank you, Mrs Patmore.<eos> That is worth a great deal.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb Your Ladyship.<eos> Yes, Spratt. What is it?<eos> I just hope you will be kind enough to give me sufficient warning.<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> So I may find myself alternative employment, before I am cast out.<eos> Oh, Spratt...<eos> You have clearly had a bad dream and are confusing it with reality.
Well, you and I differ when it comes to the importance of things.<eos> Does it ever get cold on the moral high ground (?<eos> ) I wanted to come because I don't want us to fall out over the hospital.<eos> I need to be sure that we can disagree, without there being any bad feeling between us.<eos> - Well, it depends who wins.<eos> - Surely not!<eos> Which means you are confident of victory.<eos> Well, we shall see.<eos> Shall I ring for some tea?<eos> It's rather early, but I think we deserve it.
Anna!<eos> I knew this day would come, I really did.<eos> Everyone, take a glass, quick as you can, while I propose a toast.<eos> British justice!<eos> Envy of the world.<eos> I suppose if it comes out right in the end.<eos> We could've done with the result a little sooner.<eos> Amen to that, m'lady.<eos> Andy, Daisy, go and fetch the gramophone.<eos> We never seem to use it now Lady Rose has gone.
No.<eos> I wasn't the last person, because it wasn't Jason in the car.<eos> Looked like him...<eos> The suit, the slicked-back hair.<eos> But it wasn't him.<eos> Are you blowing smoke here, Kevin?<eos> All these broker douches look alike.<eos> But I grew up with Jason. I know what he looks like.<eos> The steering wheel from Jason's Aston Martin.<eos> They found it at the garage.
I told him I had a friend who was, uh, fairly familiar with that time period, so to speak.<eos> It's a pretty rare tray, huh?<eos> You okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll, uh, give him a call now and take care of this.<eos> Okay.<eos> That silver tray was not easy to find, you know.<eos> But seeing as how we're old friends now...<eos> We're not friends.<eos> Well, nonetheless, I wanted to give you it in person.
But one day, I'll be gone.<eos> We're not having this conversation.<eos> But whether you ignore it or not, it will happen.<eos> I'm not gonna be here forever.<eos> Don't you understand me?<eos> Y- you need somebody.<eos> S- someone to be there for you, someone to share your secret with.<eos> What's Blair Dryden doing with an ancient Roman dagger?<eos> She worked at the national museum.<eos> Checked it out that day.
We found a cut in her neck made from a bread knife.<eos> Our lab said the white particulates in the cut...<eos> They were from styrofoam.<eos> You know, like the kind they use to package gifts in from, say, a wedding registry.<eos> We'll get a warrant for your place.<eos> You can just relax.<eos> I have a feeling you're gonna be here a while.<eos> Okay!<eos> Blair told me about the dagger.<eos> She found it in a box, and she thought it could be valuable.

He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Further proof...<eos> Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.<eos> She thinks I'm completely mad, and I don't blame her.<eos> She has no idea the danger she's in.<eos> Well, there has to be a way to protect her.<eos> Perhaps I can slow down the case, keep her off the scent of the dagger and then find it myself.
- No.<eos> It's been here since the Earth began?<eos> - Could be.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, it has. I can feel it.<eos> We're so used to these things being extraterrestrial, but this might be the most terrestrial thing of them all.<eos> Wow. So you found The Blessing and you worked out this morphic field.<eos> The Blessing exists in a symbiotic relationship with the human race.<eos> It transmits a morphic field around the planet, binding us together like magnetism, like sunlight.<eos> But finding it wasn't enough.

I'm going to find you.<eos> I don't think so, Steve.<eos> You have one hour to get the money together or the remaining hostages die.<eos> There will be a bus full of kids parked in a location that I will give you the address to, next time I call.<eos> Once you deliver the money, we'll all go to the Honolulu Airport.<eos> Make sure there's a private plane, fully fueled, and ready to go.<eos> Once my associates and I are on the plane the hostages will be released.<eos> You never mentioned a plane, okay?<eos> I need more time.<eos> You don't have it.
Hey, yeah what's up?<eos> I want you to check me out.<eos> Why, what's wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Coruthers was supposed to meet his parole officer last week he didn't show.<eos> We checked his neighborhood, no one has seen him since he got out.<eos> The Judge's wife got a ransom demand.<eos> Delivered?<eos> The courier said it was left in a drop box downtown with a hundred dollar bill taped to it.<eos> No way to find out who dropped it off.
You are very observant.<eos> You believe in evil, Mr. Logan?<eos> - Do I believe in evil?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I've seen evil.<eos> - Have you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Have you looked in the eye.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> Well then you know the only way to cure it is to cut it out.
That's what I'm afraid of.<eos> Let's take a different tact.<eos> How'd you come by the watch?<eos> It was in a safe deposit box in New York.<eos> Was there anything in the box with it?<eos> A ring.<eos> A Claddagh ring.<eos> I gave you a Claddagh ring when you were ten.<eos> It was your mother's.<eos> I was told you wore it every day after that.
A ring.<eos> A Claddagh ring.<eos> I gave you a Claddagh ring when you were ten.<eos> It was your mother's.<eos> I was told you wore it every day after that.<eos> Then it definitely has something to do with opening the program.<eos> Maybe I inscribed something on the inside.<eos> Where's the ring now?<eos> It's at the safe house.<eos> Can you get to it?
Yeah, which is why they didn't make sense at the scene.<eos> Oh... "Comiskey."<eos> Comiskey?<eos> Yeah, you know him?<eos> It's a baseball stadium.<eos> Charles Comiskey.<eos> Chicago Black Sox?<eos> 1919?<eos> You're so obsessed with baseball.<eos> Okay, so why pick that name and put it on a wrapper?
Keep filling those bags, people!<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go!<eos> Having fun?<eos> A little.<eos> Kinda takes you mind off the whole wedding thing, doesn't it?<eos> Actually, it hasn't been so bad.<eos> You know, I took you up on your advice, and I found a dress.<eos> Hey!<eos> Ellie was right.<eos> When I put it on, it felt like magic.
One sec.<eos> - Want a drink?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Pitcher of gin, please.<eos> [Chuckles sarcastically] Well...<eos> Amber kicked my ass.<eos> Yeah, well, you deserved it.<eos> She's got your genes.<eos> Listen, I, uh... I got a change of plans.<eos> This club up in Seattle, they offered us a very sweet deal on a gig, and the band wants to take it.
Yes.<eos> Looks great.<eos> Everything looks amazing.<eos> Listen, a couple of the kids have to leave a little bit early, so I was wondering, I know we said we'd start at 2:00, but is there any way we could start 15 minutes early?<eos> We said we'd start at 2:00.<eos> It's not 2:00.<eos> I know.<eos> But I-I'm sorry that I've changed things up on you.<eos> I just...<eos> I really want to show these kids your show 'cause they're so excited to see it.
- Do you mean that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I thought I would lose the children, and I was almost relieved.<eos> I'm not sure I want more children with you.<eos> It felt as if I didn't have to make a decision.<eos> - Can we get by with more children?<eos> - If our relationship gets by.<eos> Can we get by?<eos> We should publish that photo.<eos> Let's paste it on every wall.
Business arrangement?<eos> He's hopped up on painkillers.<eos> Which just means his inhibitions are down.<eos> Oh, come on, Richard.<eos> Look, even if he meant what he said, I... I don't feel that way. I...<eos> And scans are up.<eos> Damn it.<eos> He's got a mass.<eos> It's close to his heart.<eos> I'm gonna have to take it out right away.
I have to go.<eos> How are you?<eos> Um... I almost got my hand straight.<eos> - That's great mm-hmm.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But surgery is a trauma in and of itself.<eos> So today?<eos> I can see her today?<eos> And once it's over, the real healing begins.<eos> We call it recovery.
Now, I have teaching duties, patients.<eos> I live ten minutes away.<eos> You have all my numbers.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> Pretty please.<eos> Can't be too careful.<eos> I'm telling you, Amy was dead when I found her.<eos> I never hurt her.<eos> Then why did you try to run away?<eos> I knew you'd dig up that stupid report and completely misread it.
Ah, Caroline.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Caroline Hope, English Department.<eos> What happened?<eos> She was fine this morning.<eos> We think she might have been poisoned.<eos> She drank from this bottle of wine.<eos> Ah. St Gerard's Chianti.<eos> Do you make the wine here?<eos> We buy it from Tuscany, where it's given our own label.
Oh, wait, wait.<eos> Do you think that if we freeze this, it'll keep till next month?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, there's a father-daughter dance at school, and dad's gonna be out of town, so I was hoping that Luc would go with me.<eos> Oh, I will... I will be honored.<eos> - Maybe we could buy him a new one. - Okay.<eos> Can I see your dress?<eos> Oh, my God. It's gorgeous.<eos> And... and Tiffany's gonna let me wear it again.

In the spring waters.<eos> Narcissus?<eos> You don't know Narcissus?<eos> I can neither read nor write, my Lady Lucrezia.<eos> Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection.<eos> In the waters of a spring.<eos> Do not move.<eos> It is impossible.<eos> To fall in love with a reflection?<eos> To kiss it.
I could have if I was still fast.<eos> Our friends need our help.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm gonna charge in there, I'm gonna grab him.<eos> Should I sneak up behind him?<eos> Damn motherfucking flamethrower!<eos> No, no, just clean up the mess.<eos> Dinner time.<eos> I'm gonna want to cut your heart out, boy.<eos> I'm going to want to eat it.
Among them, the fact that you are a cardinal.<eos> Can you explain?<eos> If I can find the words.<eos> Your priestly collar makes me hope my heart is safe.<eos> Because I am not fully in command of it.<eos> So the fact that you are a cardinal pleases me as it distresses me.<eos> I thought I would not be cardinal for today.<eos> Then my heart is in danger.<eos> Would you endanger it, Cardinal Borgia?<eos> I would put it in fear of its life.
Linda.<eos> Zoey, don't.<eos> Please don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, don't do it.<eos> This is going to suck.<eos> Nick?<eos> What?<eos> Well, I...<eos> Spit it!<eos> I know I'm under strict instruction to never, ever interrupt you when you're writing your closing, but... oh, you are writing it.
Can you?<eos> There's something down there.<eos> What do you got?<eos> It's called a Gimmel ring.<eos> The husband and wife-to-be wear individual bands during the engagement and at the wedding.<eos> You see the markings in the middle?<eos> Gaelic.<eos> Doyle gave it to her.<eos> This ring is more than just a souvenir.<eos> Otherwise, why hang on to it all this time?

How do we get Easter to talk?<eos> He won't cooperate willingly.<eos> I'll handle that.<eos> The rest of you focus on Doyle's location.<eos> I hate to be the one to ask this, but how long does Emily have?<eos> Her best chance is also the most troubling.<eos> Doyle saved her for last because he views her as his stressor.<eos> Which means he'll take his time.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> I flushed it.
What a ragmop!<eos> I'llSlit your throat like a pig's.<eos> Let me go!<eos> - 'Let me go! '<eos> Why should I?<eos> A hostage might be useful to us.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> We received a letter from Papa.<eos> You can read it.
I know he is.<eos> I wish I could help you, but I'm no Ranger.<eos> It's the steward's life for me.<eos> There's honor in being a steward.<eos> Not much, really.<eos> But there's food.<eos> Here you begin anew.<eos> A man of The Night's Watch... Lives his life for the realm. Not for a king, or a lord, or the honor of this house or that house;<eos> not for gold nor glory nor a woman's love;<eos> but for the realm and all the people in it.
Okay, so, what are we going to do?<eos> Just give up.<eos> I come from a long line of surrenderers.<eos> When the going gets tough, the Guptas have been gone for hours.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, gone.<eos> Fft.<eos> If we blink on the computers before they blink on the a/c, they'll own us.<eos> What you need is some intel.<eos> You need to know their next move before they make it.
- What?<eos> - She said she'd finally met her match.<eos> So if you think she's just gonna replace you when you're gone, then you are the putz.<eos> Thanks, kid, I appreciate that.<eos> I thought you liked me when I first showed up.<eos> Please.<eos> For the first month, I didn't even bother to learn your name.<eos> - Is she back yet?<eos> - She's on her way.<eos> - Did you find it?
Oh, the double tap is really hard.<eos> Maybe he's cut the lines.<eos> Oh, it's not online.<eos> Maybe Dylan hasn't paid his bills.<eos> That's exactly right.<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> What was that guy drinking?<eos> Um... single malt with a chaser of gastric juices.<eos> Bathroom window won't open.<eos> D must have fixed it.
You have every reason to not be attracted to him, which is why I ask the question.<eos> Why are you attracted to him?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - I'm just...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Take out the scope.<eos> - But I don't see-- not the monitor.<eos> Look at his eyes.<eos> Sclerae turned yellow.<eos> Did X-rays. Looks like there's a mass in his liver, but the conductive metal rod in his ribs is blocking it.
Ready?<eos> Ready!<eos> Come on, damn you!<eos> Yes!<eos> To the victor, the spoils.<eos> Did you plant that tree?<eos> Steady on.<eos> It must be 40 years old.<eos> It's not a flattering light.<eos> My father planted it.
Controlling human emotion.<eos> Tyler has reached back out to his mother.<eos> The injection of the pooled human D.N.A. has triggered an unforeseen emotional response in him.<eos> All of your plans rest on eliminating human emotion.<eos> Unless we do so, a new generation of Visitors will be born with them.<eos> I do not believe I will solve the problem by the time we're ready to begin interbreeding, my Queen.<eos> Then we must find another way to control humans.<eos> Amy is a hybrid of human and Visitor D.N.A.<eos> The Visitor in her accepts my bliss.<eos> But the human side does not reject it.
That's when they attack.<eos> And we're talking any moving object.<eos> Did you know that a caged, rabid dog will break its own teeth trying to chew through the bars?<eos> It'll even rear back and snap its own spine.<eos> Can you imagine the amount of force it would take to do that?<eos> It's a complete character reversal.<eos> This harmless animal turned into a perfectly vicious killer.<eos> And it all started with that one bite.<eos> - But it died, didn't it?<eos> - Yes, because your grandfather shot it.
Allison's necklace.<eos> This is gonna be impossible, you know.<eos> Why don't you just ask her if you can borrow it?<eos> - How? - It's easy.<eos> You just say, "Hey, Allison,<eos> "can I borrow your necklace to see if there's anything on it or in it "that can lead me to an Alpha werewolf that I need to kill "in order to get back together with you... "<eos> - You're not helping.<eos> - Why don't you just talk to her.<eos> She won't talk to me.<eos> What if she, like, only takes it off in the shower or something?
For the future.<eos> Your future.<eos> Harvey Wratten didn't get one and he was one of yours.<eos> Gatehouse gave him an opportunity to retire.<eos> He didn't take it.<eos> So you made him by putting him in jail.<eos> But then Glickman had this crisis of loyalty and told him about us.<eos> And Harvey threatened to tell everybody else unless we got him out, so get him out we did.<eos> So then you gave the money to Gatehouse. To buy drugs to give to Customs to get Harvey a royal pardon.<eos> And when he got it, I think we might have left it at that.
This was a bad call, Bobby.<eos> You weren't there.<eos> Rule of nines is a way to calculate an approximation of how much a patient's body is covered in burns.<eos> She had less than 50% burns.<eos> And which one of us can measure 5% either way?<eos> Me.<eos> You know, for 90 days we're gonna torture her with our advanced care, and on the 91st day, she'll be overwhelmed with infection and she'll die.<eos> And in the meantime, you'll turn Commander Royal and his nurses against us.<eos> I made my decision.<eos> But did you make it from a practical viewpoint or an emotional one?
Slight acquaintances.<eos> There you go.<eos> All right, so all we have to do is get an SOB dictator to disown the son who's a chip off the old block in favor of the frivolous playboy who disowned him ten years ago.<eos> Any thoughts?<eos> Operation Mincemeat.<eos> Mincemeat.<eos> A classic.<eos> One of the greatest deception schemes ever.<eos> 1943. The Allies were about to invade Nazi-occupied Europe in Sicily.<eos> They wanted to fool the Germans into thinking they were landing somewhere else, so they found a dead body, and dressed it as a military courier carrying bogus invasion plans.
Amen! It would sound so much richer, but all the volunteers are spoken for.<eos> How's it going?<eos> All right, I suppose, if you don't mind singers who can't sing and actors who can't act!<eos> It helps to keep their spirits up.<eos> So they say, although I can't think why.<eos> I had a letter this morning from Sir Richard Carlisle.<eos> Oh?<eos> He...<eos> He tells me he proposed when he was staying here.<eos> He apologizes for not asking my permission, but he's asking it now.
Will he come through it?<eos> Her Ladyship said it sounded bad, but we don't know more than that.<eos> Can you walk with me to the church this afternoon?<eos> If you want me to.<eos> Because I'd like to say a prayer for them.<eos> For both of them.<eos> We only cater for officers.<eos> Doctor Clarkson, I am no Jacobin revolutionary, nor do I seek to overthrow the civilized world.<eos> We just need one bed for a young man from this village.<eos> And if it were within my power, you should have it.
I gather Carson was looking for me.<eos> Shall I go and find him, m'lord?<eos> It's all right.<eos> Tell him I'll be in the dressing room.<eos> Has he done the red wine, yet?<eos> It's over here, m'lord.<eos> I'm pleased.<eos> It's a new one on me.<eos> I had some at a dinner in London and ordered it.<eos> Carson thought we might try it tonight.
I just have one more.<eos> Would you kindly gather all the case files related to your investigation and your father's private files?<eos> Why?<eos> The Agency has taken an interest in your investigation of Noshimuri and the Yakuza.<eos> That's all I can say.<eos> That's all you can say?<eos> All right, well, I'm gonna say something then.<eos> The Yakuza was targeting my father and is responsible for my mother's murder.<eos> I'm sorry, but this matter has been classified as above your pay grade.<eos> Why don't you un-classify it and I won't even ask for a raise.
You can send letters to the dead?<eos> He can...<eos> Really?<eos> I-I don't know anything about it!<eos> I want to send a letter to my dad.<eos> Wait here!<eos> This is a bad turn of events.<eos> A letter?<eos> It was on my desk.<eos> Have you seen it?
I wanted to say a few words...<eos> No...<eos> A few words in honor of the guy!<eos> Time.<eos> Fuck, man.<eos> He was your friend.<eos> The Admiral realized that if he keeps waiting for Noam, he won't get the mouse, or anything else.<eos> So he came up with plan B:<eos> There's bleach in the cabinet.<eos> He'll dump it in the lake and send in Bill, the diver.
Ran a hedge fund called the H.V. Wilder Fund.<eos> But his wife's family has the real money. Name's Cook. The Cooks?<eos> Yeah, I guess. Wife's name is Peregrine.<eos> I'll deal with the family.<eos> You go and talk to the people he worked with.<eos> Anything on the missing corpse?<eos> Forensics found no usable prints on the van<eos> And nothing from the tire tracks at the scene.<eos> Why steal a dead body?<eos> What can they use it for?
I don't know.<eos> The question is, does she need to know?<eos> Yeah, it's tough.<eos> Your call.<eos> You saw the news story on Hartley's body?<eos> Well, I lied.<eos> I did find the body.<eos> There is evidence on it, And it will convict you of murder.<eos> But I haven't given the police the body.<eos> I've kept it, and I'm willing to sell it, Along with my silence, for $50,000.
- Oh, good morning, doctor!<eos> - Good morning, doctor!<eos> Do you understand what's going on here?<eos> From talking to you, doctor!<eos> - Nico, please, calm down!<eos> Calm down?<eos> - Quiet, this doctor's office!<eos> How can you calm down?<eos> People are dying one by one!<eos> He instead forget about this medicine, passionately continues to use it, increasing the dose!
Mia's lucky to have you.<eos> You're like, the best baby brother ever.<eos> I'm just trying to do my job .<eos> What do you mean by I should listen to him?<eos> Don't you like the dress?<eos> It's an ugly 70's dress.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> What is it that's so important to you about that dress?<eos> I don't know, I've always liked it since I was little.<eos> I've always told Mom I'm going to wear it when I get married.
It's possible it was hidden.<eos> For 17 years?<eos> Might explain the trace I found on one of the slugs from today's attack.<eos> Analysis came back with traces of asbestos, gypsum plaster, and old copper insulation.<eos> None of which is present in the crime lab.<eos> I think that AK-47 was hidden inside a wall.<eos> It's a perfect environment to store a rifle and ammunition- - Cool, dry.<eos> Harris retrieves it, doesn't clean it.<eos> When he goes to shoot up the lab this morning... the bullet picks up some trace.<eos> If the weapon was hidden in Harris' old apartment all these years, he may have gone back to retrieve it.
This guy...<eos> He drove her down to the water...<eos> And asked her if she ever wondered what it was like to drown.<eos> Did this guy have a name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something... Foreign.<eos> I don't remember his real name.<eos> What about the girl?<eos> Uh, Céline, I think.<eos> Someone e-erased the message on the board, or I'd show it to you.
I-I know that, 'cause h-he showed it to me.<eos> He was saving up all summer to get this thing.<eos> And, uh... I go into his room... And...<eos> I'm walking out, and I look down, and...<eos> And he's awake.<eos> Looking at me. He was just staring at me.<eos> And then I walk out.<eos> See, I-I don't expect forgiveness.<eos> I know that I-I-if it comes or not, it's... It's none of my business.<eos> All I know is that... The only thing that matters is what I do to earn it.
Right, right.<eos> Uh, the DJ will be back in a minute, I promise.<eos> He's in the bathroom, so... don't worry.<eos> What am I looking for?<eos> Well, the Zephyr's small, like a portable hard drive.<eos> Bruno's clean.<eos> SARAH: So is Paulie.<eos> This one, too.<eos> Then where's the device?<eos> How do none of them have it?
Not yet.<eos> Then what?<eos> Something I saw in the file got me thinking.<eos> I did a little research.<eos> Ohh. Crap.<eos> Please state your name for the record.<eos> - Steven Bay.<eos> - Your legal name.<eos> - Richard Dunkelman.<eos> - Why did you change it?
Work friends, you know.<eos> Were you aware that he was taking anti-depressants?<eos> Mm-hmm. You know, the defense have suggested that he might have had a reaction to his last medication.<eos> You mean the Elvatyl?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I - I don't see how.<eos> He never took it.<eos> He...?<eos> How-How do you know?<eos> When he told me he was going on it,
Peter will be better than Wendy Scott-Carr.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she is more idealistic than practical, and the world chews up idealistic people.<eos> Peter will not be chewed up.<eos> All I need is two hours this afternoon.<eos> That's all.<eos> Eli, even if I wanted to, I work.<eos> This case has been bubbling along for a year.<eos> It's here.<eos> I can't abandon it... especially when the client is in the hospital and Venezuela is trying to steal it.
Not this time.<eos> When Will found out who his partners really were... he felt like he'd been kicked in the gut.<eos> We were blind sided.<eos> And now he's dead and the whole world thinks that Will was a crooked businessman.<eos> I can't even begin to imagine how difficult this has all been for you.<eos> They killed my husband, then they destroyed his reputation.<eos> I can't bring him back.<eos> I just wanna save his good name.<eos> We will.<eos> Don't irritate it.
I can't bring him back.<eos> I just wanna save his good name.<eos> We will.<eos> Don't irritate it.<eos> It can't get out right...<eos> I mean everything is...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> How's it going to get out It doesn't have opposable thumbs.<eos> All right.<eos> Well I guess look, if it's for Sandy I guess you can keep it in the locker room.
And we got to get out of here before Vivian finds out we know about it and calls it off.<eos> Come on, let's go before your girls kill each other.<eos> You don't have to tell me twice.<eos> Everything's still locked down.<eos> Hold your fire.<eos> They'll never kill me.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No interruptions, guard.<eos> Hello again, Frost.<eos> Sarah, the weapon's been moved; Vivian's selling it.
Now we are, yeah.<eos> We just wanted to get our money back;<eos> everybody's money back.<eos> So why did James bring the gun?<eos> He didn't.<eos> Yeah, you sure?<eos> I mean Winters is out on appeal.<eos> How easy would it be for him to get a gun?<eos> It was in his office.<eos> Police would have found it.
Well, n-no.<eos> Not at first.<eos> But it-it sounded like a...<eos> a pretty steady stream, like you were peeing standing up.<eos> What?<eos> ! It's okay.<eos> Mark Walberg has three nipples, and he's a big star.<eos> But I don't pee standing up!<eos> I was pouring out my beer.<eos> I didn't want to finish it, because I'd had too much and I was embarrassed.
His own fecking funeral!<eos> So I suggested we have a pretend funeral, and let Granddad, you know, hear them!<eos> That might work!<eos> That could be great fun.<eos> I could be real sad.<eos> Am I the only sane person in this fecking house?<eos> A pretend funeral!<eos> I haven't been in mourning since your father died.<eos> Everyone said I looked lovely in that black dress.<eos> I still have it.
Oh, right!<eos> Hello, ma'am!<eos> Come in, come in. Come in, quick!<eos> Don't let anybody see you!<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> I've been expecting you!<eos> Excellent.<eos> We are here to shine a light on the path to God, and, may I just say, we are delighted with such a welcome.<eos> Ah, that's very nice.<eos> Have you got it with you now?
Lana!<eos> Zoo ?<eos> Ici ?<eos> Go, dumbass!<eos> Because if we don't get my 401K back, you won't live long enough to regret you were ever born.<eos> Doesn't even make sense...<eos> Now is that bulletproof, or what?<eos> Yeah, y'all I didn't even feel that!<eos> - This shit's pretty tight, man.<eos> - I can let it out, and I can let all this stuff go for forty-one thousand six-hundred eighty-eight dollars, and I'll even throw in the Chokebot.
- See?<eos> Twelve straight weeks and Pam's still on Team Live Badass.<eos> Yeah, and Team Live Badass?<eos> That's the best you could come up with?<eos> Well, Lana, since you already had dibs on<eos> - Team I Have An Oversized Vagina...<eos> - Hey shut up!<eos> You shut up!<eos> And everybody else shut up and watch "Terms of Emrampagement!"<eos> Why don't you call it "Magnum P.U."?
Hmm, I might need to bring another genius in on this.<eos> - Frothgar?<eos> This guy's son was abducted by us.<eos> Should I run a stock check or just give him store credit?<eos> No, I don't want store credit!<eos> I want my son back!<eos> Okay, this says he agreed to be taken and made part of any experiments Apple wants to perform.<eos> Yeah, but it's all a mistake.<eos> He actually didn't read the agreement.<eos> He didn't read it? We know.
We're gonna have to try to get you separated right away.<eos> Yes, please hurry!<eos> That cuttlefish and asparagus is not sitting well!<eos> We got it!<eos> Doctor, can you take this thing apart?<eos> If I'm going to perform surgery, I need permission.<eos> Sign this release so we can operate!<eos> No!<eos> Damn it!<eos> It didn't read it! End simulation.
They've recovered the weapon.<eos> And are we prepared on this end?<eos> We're close. We'll be ready in time.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you for letting me know.<eos> Why isn't Michael helping you with this?<eos> I tried calling him.<eos> He hasn't called me back.<eos> Must have gotten held up.<eos> Sophia, once the weapon is in our hands, how are we gonna deliver it on the scale we need?
And she stole a photo of my wife and child.<eos> Then she vanished, and you don't believe she exists.<eos> Did you find her?<eos> No. Went home.<eos> You have witnesses who can corroborate that?<eos> No, because my house is completely empty these days because my wife and daughter are dead.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> Is this the photo Esther Taylor stole from your house?<eos> Yeah, except it was in a frame.<eos> Where did you get it?
Where did you get it?<eos> Is this from your house, too?<eos> I think that's one of Lucy's friends.<eos> Amy.<eos> But I've never seen the photo before.<eos> What have they got to do with Geraldine's death?<eos> What about this?<eos> Why are you showing me this?<eos> Come on!<eos> But I've never seen it before.
Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon, five years ago.<eos> How are you spending your second childhood?<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, you've been doing such a good job, I put together a little surprise for your viewing pleasure.<eos> Is this what I think it is?<eos> Evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.<eos> You said in class how you were really into this case.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I was obsessed with this case.<eos> I have followed it night and day.
- I see.<eos> So my question to you is...<eos> Can I make this problem go away?<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> A minute.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> What?<eos> The engagement ring.<eos> Fuck me in the ear, I never gave it back to you.

I mean, you've had a lot on your plate lately.<eos> I better go.<eos> Got some professors to harass.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Jamie, it's Debra.<eos> I need a little favor from you.<eos> About two weeks ago, I brought a ring box home with an engagement ring in it.<eos> You lost an engagement ring?<eos> I left it on Harrison's side of the apartment.<eos> - Have you seen it?

Okay.<eos> I know you seem like a nice guy.<eos> I just wouldn't want to see you get hurt.<eos> So when Jessica Morris OD'd, there was definitely someone in that hotel room with her.<eos> No doubt.<eos> Then why is Laguerta on my ass to close this thing?<eos> Maybe she wants to keep a low profile?<eos> So what am I supposed to do?<eos> If I do my job and I investigate a possible homicide, then-- I piss off captain close-it.<eos> And if I close it, this guy walks.
Direct action.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Occupy the site, picket his farm.<eos> Anything to stop him ploughing the meadow.<eos> Anything (? )<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous!<eos> Murder?<eos> It's unthinkable.<eos> Well, somebody thought it.<eos> Somebody planned it.
Caradoc Singer.<eos> Few questions?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> This row.<eos> What was said?<eos> It was about Preston's intention to plough... Gorse Meadow.<eos> But what was said?<eos> Canning maintained it was sacrilege.<eos> Preston told him he was talking drivel.<eos> Canning said...if he had a heart, he'd rip it out.
No. I don't approve of our symbols being manufactured as gift shop trinkets, Mr Barnaby.<eos> Faith comes from within.<eos> What did she say it was?<eos> An Awen.<eos> A symbol of druidical power.<eos> The word means inspiration.<eos> Loosely translated from the er... mediaeval Welsh.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> What I don't know is how the killer got Preston's body from the road to the circle.<eos> He must've been strong enough to er...move it singlehandedly.
Listen, I need to go.<eos> We -- we found pink fibers from your scarf in the transporter.<eos> Zane gave me that scarf.<eos> I wear it all the time.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Jack Roush has his straw hat.<eos> You have the pink scarf.<eos> Which I knew was pink 'cause Shaz gave me this color original.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Only you hadn't worn it since last Wednesday, so I got a search warrant and searched your place.
No. She... she didn't leave me. I left her.<eos> What?<eos> I felt terrible, but after a couple of months, I just kind of realized she wasn't right for me.<eos> - You realized that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I mean, I thought I'd found the one, but... guess I was wrong.<eos> Did she run up any bills on your credit card?<eos> No.<eos> What about the engagement ring?<eos> She gave it back to me.
Whatever you say.<eos> I found a keeper.<eos> There you go.<eos> What's going on, Parker?<eos> We need to finish your evaluation.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I am not on the clock right now, so this can wait.<eos> I wanted to retract my prior critique.<eos> Oh. Well, in that case...<eos> Your friend brought you a worthwhile case, and your emotions kept it on track.
And I'm organizing an inmate sit-in if conditions don't improve.<eos> All right, don't cause trouble.<eos> I don't cause trouble.<eos> I act against injustice.<eos> Or don't you remember?<eos> How could I forget?<eos> Toughest dad on the block.<eos> So, according to the charges, you've been bottling camel milk and selling it on the Internet.<eos> Camel milk is chock-full of vitamins and fatty acids that help cancer patients, autistic children, diabetics.<eos> Then why hasn't the USDA legalized it?
I think they made the whole thing up to get attention.<eos> I heard Ian and Spencer were having an affair.<eos> ( Chatter continues )<eos> You mean that he fell to his death and then disappeared?<eos> They just got used to everyone looking at them after Ali died.<eos> I don't know what's more pathetic... People who gossip, or people who listen to gossip.<eos> ( Scoffs ) Look at Suzy Lipton strutting her bony ass in those skinny jeans.<eos> I heard she lost all that weight drinking rice milk.<eos> - What?<eos> - Bull milk... you can buy it online.
And you're not allowed to do that, either.<eos> I didn't leave without saying good-bye.<eos> Was I unconscious during that exchange?<eos> I should've told you in person, I just...<eos> I had never said the things that I was feeling, and I didn't feel that I could say those things without making a complete ass of myself, pretty much like I am doing right now.<eos> So, I wrote you a letter, and in the letter I said I was sorry.<eos> Most of my life, I have felt alone, even when I was with people.<eos> That was until I met you.<eos> So, what happened to this letter?<eos> I gave it to Mona.

Who are you?<eos> Agent Diana Berrigan, FBI.<eos> Damn right, I'm overqualified.<eos> Talked to my buddy at the FDA.<eos> Turns out the bad Zybax causes brain hemorrhages if taken with certain medications.<eos> PV figured they'd shut down Mendell and Helen, then roll the dice on any medication still out there.<eos> Settling lawsuits would've been cheaper than a recall.<eos> Well, at least the drug's off the market, and we've got Carter and Sullivan on conspiracy to commit murder.<eos> Any chance of getting that case report by the end of the day?<eos> If I can get it to you by lunch, can I go to that tech conference in Miami?
You don't seem congested.<eos> Hmm, intriguing.<eos> You have any thoughts about our patient?<eos> Got some questions about whether Thirteen really believes in karma or just wants to.<eos> As for the patient, it's not gonna be easy to break into her office.<eos> Might want to start with her home.<eos> We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.<eos> Sure.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?
The Bureau requested that I authenticate the will.<eos> I don't remember you being mentioned.<eos> - Not me?<eos> - Not you.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Hi.<eos> Josh Roland.<eos> You're here to authenticate my will?<eos> Agent Peter Burke.<eos> My associate Neal will take a look at it.
- What?<eos> Uh, I'm gonna fence the Degas tonight.<eos> Yeah. That's great news, Moz.<eos> But can we handle the book, please?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Oh.<eos> -Yeah. - We need to cut a hole.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just big enough for the pointer to turn the page.<eos> And we can seal it with a polymer filament.
Somewhere inside...<eos> Does a Stanley hide?<eos> Somewhere inside...<eos> Does a Stanley hide?<eos> Image, like a penciled sketch...<eos> Little saint wading through innocence<eos> Never waiting nor hesitating<eos> Elves and fairies giving guard...<eos> To that melting dissolving face...<eos> Did you leave it behind
Unaware of hunger or thirst<eos> Boys, hurry up the food is getting cold<eos> Unaffected by class divide<eos> Bathed in sunshine, all sunny<eos> Morsels of happiness, not too many<eos> Innocent heart believes in any...<eos> Lost yourself in crowded herds, have you?<eos> Rosy, what happened?<eos> This essay is so funny!<eos> And who has written it?
- Yeah.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Always a pleasure.<eos> - All right.<eos> We just got shut down.<eos> Search warrant on Vega's house and car was denied.<eos> No grand jury on Vega, either.<eos> What?<eos> How can Merck shut down a grand-jury investigation?<eos> By delaying it till after the playoffs.
I never wanted a Sweet 16.<eos> I wanted a bottle of vodka, which you bought for me.<eos> I feel really bad about not being able to be there for you then, but I can be here for you now.<eos> And you can be here for Brandi.<eos> Wow.<eos> I know, right?<eos> We've talked, Brandi and I, and if you don't want to be maid of honor, fine.<eos> But at least, as a sister, help her pick out her wedding gown.<eos> Dress.<eos> Let's start by calling it a dress, okay?
It's Cody.<eos> Okay. Okay, Cody.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Yeah, he's burning up.<eos> We have to get him to the hospital.<eos> Do you see his Fuzzy anywhere?<eos> His Fuzzy?<eos> Yeah, his little blue blanket.<eos> Okay, well, I'll try and find it.
I was self-destructive.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> I'm making changes.<eos> I'm gonna stop doing stupid things.<eos> Great.<eos> The smart thing to do would be to talk about why you did it.<eos> If you don't understand...<eos> I think I can avoid putting another hole in my leg without talking about my mother.<eos> I don't wanna find out you're wrong by getting another phone call from you in a bloody bathtub.<eos> I'm a big believer that the best way to get past the past is to shoot it in the head, bury it in a deep pit and pour lye on it.
It's him, right?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> I will call you back.<eos> Okay?<eos> You..<eos> When did you come?<eos> A while ago.<eos> Neha's parents were sitting and..<eos> How was your interview?<eos> Couldn't complete it.
Get up!<eos> Uh, I can explain.<eos> Really?<eos> I'd like to hear it.<eos> Can I... can I talk to Fred in private?<eos> You have two minutes to talk and disinfect my sofa.<eos> I heard about your new house.<eos> I was gonna stop by.<eos> Yeah, actually...<eos> But then I decided I didn't want to see it.
it's "I love you." "I love you," Ray.<eos> That's Lenore.<eos> She fucking stole our clients!<eos> Well, I told you, Tanya.<eos> I knew something was up.<eos> Who doesn't listen?<eos> - I have a plan.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> - Huh? It's the broken-window theory.<eos> If you have a house and there's a broken window... and you don't fix it right away, you get more broken windows.
what Nucky ships doesn't.<eos> I tried talking to 'em.<eos> All they see is the dollar signs.<eos> I'm Owen Sleater.<eos> I'm to ensure your home is safe for Mr. McGarrigle's visit this evening.<eos> - Kerry. - Family there still?<eos> - No.<eos> Here, apparently.<eos> If you're in the market for quality liquor,<eos> - I can get it for you.
Hello?<eos> DC Bailey, Major Incident Team.<eos> Can you PNC a vehicle for me, please?<eos> Yeah, pin number 11-23-1.<eos> It's for intelligence.<eos> Registration is Tango Romeo Five Eight Victor Lima Delta.<eos> It'll be a silver Mercedes CLK 2-20.<eos> Possibly registered in the name of Nick or Nicholas Savage.<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> You know I'm just as culpable for not reporting a discipline offence I've witnessed as you are for committing it? Ssh.
Georgios Stelikos changed his story.<eos> (READS) 'I dropped Maya off outside her parents' house.<eos> I watched her walk up the path.<eos> I saw her let herself into the house.'<eos> And you've seen the police interview with Mr Stelikos, where he elaborates on seeing her take the key out of her bag.<eos> We now know that this didn't happen.<eos> Because the police subsequently found that key on the floor at Mr Stelikos' flat.<eos> And that's when he was obliged to change his story.<eos> And that's all it was, a story, a lie.<eos> A lie he had to construct, because Maya Woods was already dead when he drove her body there and dumped it.
Anything you suggest?<eos> - Is he medicated?<eos> - No. Well, just make sure you get him in a very calm place first. And if he gets violent, call 911.<eos> You've been a big help.<eos> Did you have Braxton Hicks contractions with Adam?<eos> - Hey, Adam.<eos> - Hey, what's up?<eos> Hi, Sean, how are you?<eos> I feel like my blood is carbonated.<eos> I usually don't get this excited about the female body when I'm on the outside of it.
Yes, sir.<eos> So - what happened?<eos> Crazy woman.<eos> Went all the way there, nothing.<eos> No body?<eos> No nothing.<eos> I need you to go back to the beach.<eos> What for? If there WAS a gun, the tide wouldn't be able to carry it out, would it?<eos> I mean a body, maybe - it would float - but a gun's too heavy.<eos> If the tide dragged it, it'd just get stuck in the sand, correct?
"Now you see two of me".<eos> Why do we need catchphrases?<eos> You know... for when shit goes down, man.<eos> C'mon. D'you really think we're going to spend the next seven weeks ambling around, picking up litter?<eos> He's got a point.<eos> Maybe it'll be different this time.<eos> Maybe there won't be any shit going down.<eos> Oh, trust me. There'll be shit.<eos> It's in the air.<eos> I can smell it.
I want other people to congratulate me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> No one else is here.<eos> I know. Nice meeting you.<eos> Paradise, huh?<eos> (Chuckles) Wow, Brick.<eos> Can you believe it? Only a couple more days till you're a fourth grader.<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure that's gonna happen.<eos> What?<eos> Apparently, I missed some sort of journal assignment, and if I don't turn it in,
Here you go.<eos> Oh...<eos> Eh, don't bother. We're a long way from summer.<eos> (Sighs)<eos> (Bell rings) You know the old saying--<eos> "Never buy a tiki torch before its time."<eos> That isn't really a saying, but trust me, don't do it.<eos> Oh, um, Ms. Rinsky, quick question.<eos> About the assignment I'm scheduled to hand in on Friday--<eos> You didn't do it.
- No.<eos> - You said he kept his private life private.<eos> Do you know anything about girlfriends, lovers?<eos> - He never shared that stuff with me.<eos> But over the last few months, he was acting different.<eos> - Different how?<eos> - He wasn't putting in those 20-hour days.<eos> He seemed happy.<eos> - Study guide to proust.<eos> - He brought it in to work yesterday.
So now our parents are thinking that we just shouldn't hang out as much.<eos> Oh. That's so unfair.<eos> So I'll get the gift for mr. Fitz,<eos> But I can't help you with hanna.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'll come up with something.<eos> Aria: So the videos are gone?<eos> Totally gone.<eos> That was our only evidence.<eos> Well, we don't have it anymore.
- Sit. - Um, here...<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> I'm not that fussy.<eos> - Here. - Oh.<eos> Strange.<eos> Wonder where Maura gets it.<eos> You like greasy hamburgers?<eos> Actually, I'd love a hamburger.<eos> It's been years.<eos> Oh, good, 'cause this place has some really good ones after the health department shut it down.
I was kind of talking in general.<eos> You've been a little different since we got back.<eos> So people have been telling me.<eos> Well, if it matters or not, I like it.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's nice to know we have each other to rely on.<eos> How Brady Bunch was that?<eos> I loved that show.<eos> You hated it.
Want me to put my phone number too?<eos> Falls!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Just Barry?<eos> No last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know like Prince.<eos> What was your original name?<eos> David Fletcher.<eos> But you wanted a bit of pizzazz so you changed it to Barry?
Who wants to dance with me and my massive fucking sword? Oh!<eos> Shit!<eos> Take it easy mate.<eos> Now as I see it we've got three options.<eos> One we fight you lose limbs.<eos> Two we take that picture to Bobby's office like a bunch of pussies.<eos> Or three truce.<eos> You walk away we delete the picture.<eos> It's your move.<eos> I want to see you delete it.
- You okay? All right.<eos> - Yeah, thanks.<eos> Nobody move!<eos> What is it?<eos> Why don't you stay where you are?<eos> Mr. Scott?<eos> Fuck me.<eos> All right.<eos> Bad news is we're standing in a minefield.<eos> The good news is we're almost out of it.
We can take your car to the clinic.<eos> What do you got there, buddy?<eos> Hey, hey, Allen, Allen...<eos> Hey, can't die on me, yet.<eos> How do you know all that shit about me?<eos> What happened to me in Iraq?<eos> That consignment of WMD...<eos> You shouldn't have asked so many questions...<eos> That shit is still out there.<eos> He's going to use it.
"Po-tay-to," "po-tah-to."<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Let's solve the case.<eos> All right.<eos> The thief parked the take in a Swiss bank under an alias -- Cameron Duponte.<eos> Duponte is a specter.<eos> The FBI barely knows where to start.<eos> Oh, that's where we have an advantage over the feds.<eos> We have a keen grasp of the criminal mind.<eos> Okay, say I've stolen an incalculable fortune and secreted it away.
I see you've found Mozzie's bug scanner.<eos> Sorry, June.<eos> I didn't know you were home.<eos> I-I don't like those federal agents around the house without supervision.<eos> Sure.<eos> You and Mozzie don't care much for authority.<eos> Let's just say it's an acquired distaste.<eos> Well, this place is incredible.<eos> It's like Franklin Castle.<eos> Who built it?
I got to sit?<eos> A woman's heart is a deep and mysterious place, almost impossible to reach.<eos> Much like the G-spot.<eos> Although at least we know the heart, in fact, exists.<eos> Okay, is that it?<eos> Can I stand up now?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> H-hang on.<eos> Hang on.<eos> When that heart closes itself to a man-- and in my experience, it inevitably does-- the only way to reopen it is to allow time to pass.
Hoshino!<eos> I can't exist that way.<eos> It seems...<eos> It's impossible for me.<eos> stop!<eos> I'm sorry for the interruption.<eos> - Hoshino!<eos> - This is... turn the feeder up!<eos> the volume!<eos> Turn it up!
I'm even stronger than I knew.<eos> Stronger and crazier.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Ricky?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I just wasn't expecting you.<eos> No one was.<eos> Did you get my message?<eos> No, I didn't exactly.<eos> I got it, but I erased it.
Excuse me, sir.<eos> It's the right way to go.<eos> We need fresh blood.<eos> I'm right with you, Tom.<eos> We'll make it work.<eos> - What was that about?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> In there with Cullen, what just happened?<eos> He gave us an opening.<eos> Why didn't we take it?
Pursuit of happiness and all that.<eos> Know what makes me happy?<eos> That.<eos> There's nothing more fun than fucking up the social order and then kicking back and watching the fallout.<eos> What's happened to your date?<eos> He left me.<eos> The cad.<eos> My self-esteem's in tatters.<eos> That's too bad.<eos> I wonder if you'd be a gentleman and help me restore it?
Cook something?<eos> Yeah, i make these great butterscotch brownies.<eos> - Aww. - Bay:oh, she's pretty. she's smart.<eos> She bakes.<eos> What doesn't she do?<eos> You do lots of things too, honey.<eos> So it's set, right? Thursday barbecue<eos> - You, regina and your grandma?<eos> Here's some rhubarb jam.<eos> Some people don't like it, but i love it.
I'm sort of leveling the playing field.<eos> This...<eos> - Ew.<eos> - Is Dale.<eos> My weird ingrown toenail that grows in two directions.<eos> It's infected most of the time.<eos> In case you're wondering, he is why I always have sex with my socks on.<eos> Oh, I have a mole in the shape of Jesus.<eos> - Right next to my butthole.<eos> - Oh! Yeah, I figured you're gonna see it eventually, so it might as well not come as a surprise.
Previously on "the vampire diaries"...<eos> Does Elena enjoy having both of you worship at her altar?<eos> I've heard about you...<eos> The crazy, impulsive vampire, in love with his brother's girl.<eos> Klaus is a vampire born of a werewolf bloodline.<eos> The curse has kept his werewolf aspect from manifesting, but if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.
And sleep in your dead parents' room or my dead girlfriend's room...<eos> Right.<eos> Hey, Elena...<eos> Happy Birthday.<eos> Thanks.<eos> We are out of champagne.<eos> Huh.<eos> No, you are out of champagne, 'cause I don't drink in the morning.<eos> Well, would you be a dear and...<eos> I think you can probably get it yourself.
Make what legal?<eos> Custody, so he can register for school.<eos> Custody?<eos> ! She went to jail for me.<eos> Now she's out, so I'm going to find her.<eos> Where's Silas?<eos> He had stuff he had to do.<eos> Yeah, still mad at me.<eos> What's inside the radio?<eos> You wouldn't hide it if it was just a radio. I know you.
Are you hungry?<eos> Do you want to get something to eat?<eos> I have a car service outside.<eos> Silas, please come, too.<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> All right. I'll catch up with you later.<eos> I'm gonna... get my higher self probed.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> What's inside the radio?<eos> You wouldn't hide it if it was just a radio.
Trying to...<eos> I went too far, didn't I?<eos> What happened, Sergeant?<eos> Why can't we find John Blackburn?<eos> You're late for school.<eos> The school of hard knocks, where you will eventually learn discipline.<eos> And respect.<eos> Out yous get.<eos> Where's the body?<eos> I buried it.
I've got a great case... big divorce.<eos> Mine.<eos> Oh, you mean your divorce that was "almost final" last Christmas?<eos> All right, I hired the wrong lawyer, Kim.<eos> This guy was an amateur.<eos> He sold me on something called, um, binding arbitration.<eos> Yeah, there's nothing wrong with that.<eos> It's fair for you and Doug.<eos> Well, we've been going back and forth for months.<eos> And this butt-for-brains arbitrator approved a final offer and told me I had to take it.
Do you want to put those facts in front of a jury?<eos> What is the matter with you?<eos> Mia was raped.<eos> What's the matter with me?<eos> I'm trying to help your clients.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have a really big decision to make.<eos> If we don't hand over the video, we'll go to jail?<eos> There's a good chance, yes.<eos> If we hand it over, Vince wins again.
Leave it to "A" to make you feel bad about your mom feeling good.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Horseshoe?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> Is this some kind of a joke?<eos> I-I brought in a ring.<eos> Not according to the ticket.<eos> You gave me that ticket 48 hours ago.<eos> Lot of people come through here in that time.<eos> I need that ring back today, so I need you to get back down there behind that counter and find it.
I mean, Danby is a beautiful campus, and I could come visit, and...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Oh, my God, you don't want to go to Danby?<eos> Or you don't want me to come to Danby?<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> That letter is not real.<eos> The coach from Danby didn't write it.<eos> I...<eos> I did.<eos> Wow, so you just mailed it to yourself?
In it, Ayn Rand attacks head-on the idea of altruism, the care of others, as an organising principle for society.<eos> In the story, the government and the state control everything. But one by one, the creative individuals in America - the industrialists, the inventors and the artists - are all mysteriously disappearing.<eos> They have gone on strike, and they hide out in a remote mountain valley as America falls apart.<eos> At the end of the book, they reappear, and set out to build Rand's vision of the world to come, a world in which politics has disappeared and is based instead on what she called "the virtues of selfishness."<eos> The critics hated it.<eos> And let me start by quoting from a review of this novel, Atlas Shrugged, that appeared in Newsweek.<eos> It said that you are out to destroy almost every edifice in the contemporary American way of life - our Judeo-Christian religion, our modified government-regulated capitalism, our rule by the majority will.<eos> Are these accurate criticisms? Er, yes.<eos> I'm challenging the moral code of altruism, the precept that man's moral duty is to live for others, that man must sacrifice himself to others.<eos> I say that man is entitled to his own happiness, and that he must achieve it himself, and nor should he wish to sacrifice himself for the happiness of others.
Yes, boss.<eos> Hit people with a stick, Marcus.<eos> And don't give them your mobile.<eos> Now, look, that one is pretty.<eos> Too short.<eos> Right, well, what are you going to buy her, Jackson?<eos> Early Christmas present.<eos> Thank you, Santa.<eos> There might be a weird message on your phone from me.<eos> Just delete it.
This isn't the time for this guys.<eos> But we're not doing this.<eos> - Lady, lis-<eos> - She's crazy.<eos> I told Peter he'd be a fool to trust any of them.<eos> What is out there?<eos> Okay, listen everybody just relax, all right?<eos> We're gonna be safe in here.<eos> No we're not.<eos> The kind of force that attacked Ben focused on this building is gonna destroy it.
Bingum, the insurance company's lawyer just asked for a meeting.<eos> He is on his way over.<eos> Oh, that can only mean one thing.<eos> Settlement.<eos> Big settlement.<eos> What's this?<eos> I see numbers but no dollar signs.<eos> It's Mr. Shayne's bloodwork, taken shortly before he died.<eos> It shows the presence of a drug called clenbuterol, which is illegal in the United States.<eos> Now, Ms. Shayne just so happens to have a prescription for it in Canada, where it is legal.
Mr Garrow.<eos> Where James Hadfield bears the appearance of purpose and planning, he retained no capacity to appreciate the legal consequences of his behaviour.<eos> And by the law's notion of intent,<eos> James Hadfield had not chosen to kill the King.<eos> I hope that your sound understandings, gentlemen, will easily enable you to distinguish infirmities which are misfortunes, from motives which are crimes.<eos> Well, gentlemen, depravity or disease?<eos> The true self displaced, or an act of wilful deliberation and wicked purpose?<eos> Mr Garrow argues here for a change in the law on madness.<eos> No small debate.<eos> Will you allow it?
- Edwards?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> There's definitely a connection between cecile Edwards and Michelle Turner, the woman she I.D.'d as the shooter.<eos> Cecile Edwards is her mother.<eos> Were you even gonna tell me?<eos> Jo, I do not need to ask your permission to marry Andy.<eos> Well, you do when you give her my ring.<eos> It was never your ring.<eos> You said no.<eos> Yeah, and yet you hung on to it all these years.

This case is making me sick.We need a bust tonight,okay?<eos> So let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Let's go!<eos> You working undercover again tonight?<eos> - That is the plan.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Does that mean you're gonna be wearing that outfit?<eos> I am.<eos> And I'm probably gonna be very,very tired,So I'm gonna need you to help me take it off.
I'm here talking to Copenhagen residents about a miraculous new invention.<eos> Excuse me, sir, what would you say is the toughest part about life in Copenhagen?<eos> The Muslims.<eos> I'm kidding. Kidding.<eos> No, the commute, for sure.<eos> Biking up these hills leaves me zeer pooped.<eos> Well, try this.<eos> Wow!<eos> Thank you, stranger!<eos> Celebrities love it, too.
What mental state is that?<eos> Mr Naylor's seeing an expert in delusional behaviour.<eos> She's helped him understand what triggered the events.<eos> Really?<eos> Some kind of deep-seated trauma, I presume.<eos> I had some emotional problems when I was a medical student.<eos> I now see that I had some kind of breakdown.<eos> Mr Naylor, in this case, your mental state can't be used as a defence.<eos> Can we agree to drop this groundless manslaughter charge?<eos> I'd hardly call it groundless.
Then we will have to get to it later.<eos> Ah. There you are.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> One more thing.<eos> I love this space.<eos> Do -- do you love it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> High ceilings!<eos> Mm.<eos> Do you rent it out?
What about those bodies on the beach in Long Island?<eos> It's a big deal, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll bet you wish you were working on that.<eos> Hmm, not so much.<eos> I'm good for now.<eos> How about we talk about your burglary charge instead?<eos> Want to?<eos> I mean, there is a certain school of thought that says an engagement gets broken up, the girl should give back the ring with you there.<eos> That doesn't mean you get to break into her place and take it back.
I'd like to begin today's session by introducing our newest member to the group.<eos> Shawn "Gthorndall".<eos> It's pronounced "Thorndall".<eos> It's a silent G.<eos> Nurse McElroy, she has a mirror.<eos> Didn't I tell you about mirrors?<eos> What's his problem with mirrors?<eos> He thinks they steal a person's soul.<eos> - Um-- - You gotta stop scratching.<eos> Would you just make her put it away?
I get us some milk.<eos> So much cake make baby kick up storm.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Why did you walk out of therapy?<eos> You weren't going to reveal your secrets, and I have cakes to taste, so if you'll excuse me,<eos> I haven't even begun the buttercream.<eos> Dr. Krueger thought you were upset I returned the ring.<eos> He has too many PhDs.<eos> They cancel each other out and make him a moron.<eos> I returned it because you asked me to let you go.
What?<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> OK.<eos> What?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> What is it?<eos> There was an ignition device.<eos> Where?<eos> Oggy had it.
Oh, shit!<eos> OK.<eos> What?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks, Mike.<eos> What is it?<eos> There was an ignition device.<eos> Where?<eos> Oggy had it.<eos> He was reassembling it.
Something's missing.<eos> I won't be a minute.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> I'm Rosa Gilbert, a forensic investigator for the Home Office.<eos> We're looking at the Josephine Collins case.<eos> I need to see the rest of this file.<eos> I'll need a doctor's permission.<eos> What if you have her dad's permission?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Give it to her.
Well, we need to speak to Mr Penton now and we'd like to take a DNA sample from him.<eos> I don't want to encounter any medical problems, so do you mind coming with us?<eos> OK, mate, I just need to put you to sleep.<eos> Sorry, I mean death.<eos> The plants from the first burial site were killed by cold.<eos> What, frost?<eos> Colder, like something minus 20 was pressed down upon them.<eos> The body - it was frozen.<eos> Penton kills the kid, they don't know what to do with the body.<eos> They need time to think, so... they put it in the freezer, come back to the burial a couple of days later.
Best you've ever felt.<eos> Heaven.<eos> And then you wake up... in hell.<eos> So you'll meet me back here when you've done, you give me the cash and I'll give you some good shit.<eos> No!<eos> I know you did not just try and thieve from me!<eos> Meet me here when you're done.<eos> You were working for Penton and he sexually assaulted you?<eos> I don't want to go there!<eos> You made the allegation and then you withdrew it.
You wanna tell me what you're doing?<eos> Nope.<eos> Doesn't seem fair to the person whose idea it was.<eos> You're gone.<eos> - You wanted to talk, talk.<eos> - I did. I want to put this competition aside, call it a draw.<eos> Tapping out, Harv?<eos> This isn't about that.<eos> This is about real people.<eos> You make them a reasonable offer, I'll get them to take it.
That's why they're not here tonight.<eos> Yeah, they've-- they've seen me in jail.<eos> They've seen me rushed to emergency rooms.<eos> They've seen me dragged into court.<eos> But seeing me on basic cable would kill them.<eos> But I know-- I know that my family will always be there for me, so...<eos> What I'm trying to say is that I'm done with "the winning," because I've already won.<eos> This roast may be over, but I'm Charlie Sheen.<eos> And in here-- in here burns an eternal fire.<eos> I just have to remember to keep it away from a crack pipe.
So, what are you saying, that she cheated?<eos> No, I worked really hard on that paper.<eos> I promise.<eos> Is this the only proof you have?<eos> The fact that Sutton's essay is so good?<eos> Then I'd say you have nothing.<eos> Her last two teachers said...<eos> I don't care what her last ten teachers said.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> And if she says she wrote it, I believe her.
Yeah.<eos> I know that.<eos> Got him.<eos> He's in the server room.<eos> - Go invite Agent Finley up here.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> This place?<eos> This is where Gibson's holding the children?<eos> Based on the recollection of the released kids.<eos> You recognize it?
Nice.Beachy.<eos> Hello,Tony,how are you?<eos> Working.Looks like you are,too.<eos> There's someone I need to see - friend of a friend.<eos> Is it about the microchip you took out of Levin's arm?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I can't,not till I get back.<eos> I don't know what you're mixed up in,but people are looking for you,okay?<eos> People who don't have the same personal investment as yours truly.<eos> I made a promise to someone,Tony,and now I need to fulfill it.
Jen's real mother died in childbirth.<eos> It was in the adoption records.<eos> Jen knows that.<eos> I just can't believe she arranged to meet this person and didn't say anything about it.<eos> I don't know why she'd lie to us.<eos> Yeah, well, my guess is Jen's abductor found out she was adopted, fabricated information about her birth mother and used that into luring her to meet up him.<eos> Okay, so it had to be someone who knew she was adopted.<eos> Well, she talked about it in her interview for Aloha Life magazine.<eos> I mean, thousands of people could know.<eos> I'm gonna go take this letter to the crime lab, see if I can get a print off of it.
I could tell you were lying.<eos> Yeah, that never gets old.<eos> Take a look at that oil painting. It's right across from the broken window.<eos> It is a van Gogh.<eos> Stormy Night. Been missing for years.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> It's bounced around Europe since World War I, and death has followed that painting wherever it's been spotted.<eos> If it's an artifact, why don't we just take it?<eos> And tell them what?<eos> "Your priceless painting murdered a man, please can we have it"?
When something has no explanation, there can only be one explanation.<eos> Leo has an artifact?<eos> That's the only thing that makes sense.<eos> I mean, he vanished into thin air.<eos> We know that they're out there, right?<eos> That we do.<eos> But I didn't know that three years ago.<eos> So I didn't know what I was looking for.<eos> Okay, you know what, I'm gonna go back to Sam's office. I'm gonna look at his notes on the old case.<eos> What, are you gonna re-open it?
I remember you.<eos> We were friends.<eos> We are friends.<eos> And now the reason you're here.<eos> Gloria tells me you know how to contact the original witch.<eos> The original witch.<eos> What do you have that Gloria needs?<eos> Where's my necklace?<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> I never take it off!

You wore trousers so women today could wear nothing.<eos> And what is this music?<eos> It sounds like a cable car accident.<eos> It's dance music.<eos> - You would dance to this? - Hmm.<eos> Are we done?<eos> And why are you so grumpy?<eos> I needed one thing from you for my witch to find out why my hybrids are dying, one thing.<eos> Your necklace.<eos> And you lost it.

Since when did you learn how to cook?<eos> Damon helped a little.<eos> Damon's helping you cook now?<eos> Both of you stop judging.<eos> He's just trying to be a good... ow!<eos> Ahh! Did I splash you?<eos> No, no, my necklace.<eos> I can sense something.<eos> It burned me.<eos> Maybe it's a sign you shouldn't be wearing it.
Previously on "the Vampire Diaries"...<eos> You must be Elena.<eos> How do we look exactly alike?<eos> - I killed the doppelganger.<eos> - I broke the curse.<eos> So what am I doing wrong?<eos> You'd have to contact the witch who created it.
I don't want you getting in the middle of that.<eos> I'm here because you upset the balance of nature.<eos> And it's your duty to set it right.<eos> You need to close that door.<eos> How do we do that?<eos> Apparently the old witch can draw power from this side because of her talisman.<eos> Talisman...<eos> My necklace?<eos> It's some ju ju power source.<eos> And I know you're not going to like this, but Bonnie needs to destroy it.
It's not anywhere in this room.<eos> What do you want, Jeremy?<eos> Caroline?<eos> Did you find that necklace?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Wait, what's going on?<eos> Ghosts of the tomb vampires killed Tobias Fell.<eos> You might want to find that necklace before they start going alphabetically through the founding families.<eos> Well, it's not where it's supposed to be.<eos> Unless someone took it.

You have trust issues.<eos> Anyone ever tell you that?<eos> Yo.<eos> Help a brother out?<eos> Mason?<eos> Where is Anna now?<eos> I don't know, ok?<eos> I don't even know for sure if she took the necklace.<eos> She was the only person who heard us talking about it.<eos> Of course she took it. Ok?

No!<eos> No... not until I break through.<eos> I can't, Lexi.<eos> They have a necklace.<eos> They're going to close the door.<eos> The necklace.<eos> Ok.<eos> That necklace.<eos> At least tell me you remember how you felt about that.<eos> You found it during your darkest time.
For every strength, there would be a weakness.<eos> The sun became our enemy.<eos> It kept us indoors for weeks.<eos> And then my mother found a solution.<eos> There were other problems.<eos> Inside.<eos> Neighbors who had opened to their homes to us could now keep us out.<eos> Flowers at the base of the white oak burned and prevented compulsion.<eos> And the spell decreed that the tree that gave us life could also take it away.<eos> So we burned it to the ground.
What would Carrie Bradshaw do?<eos> Seriously, if I knew, I would be married to Mr. Big, living in a fantastic apartment in the great state of Not Alabama.<eos> Don't ask my advice.<eos> I have liked the wrong men since I can remember.<eos> I'll just go sit on the other side of the square and try to read your lips.<eos> So, uh...<eos> Hi.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> Um, Brick asked me to look for loopholes in his partnership agreement with Harley.<eos> It's 25 years old, so I hadn't seen it.
Isn't it cute?<eos> Well, yes, that is, uh... Cute, yeah.<eos> - Did your sister see that?<eos> - I knew it.<eos> Always running off to daddy when you don't get your way.<eos> He said my dress was cute.<eos> Daddy, this dress shows places that only God should see.<eos> It's like something that Zoe Hart would wear.<eos> Hey!<eos> Magnolia said that she would march right back to the store and go return it, but now she's just traipsing around in it so they won't take it back.
Any chance he was flashing that around your bar, maybe showing off with it, trying to sell it?<eos> Like any of my customers could afford a rock like that.<eos> Maybe you know anyone else that might want him dead for another reason?<eos> I don't know about dead, but I got plenty of customers that weren't too happy with what he did to some of their favorite bars.<eos> Was he planning on remodeling your place?<eos> He talked to his business people about it, but they weren't interested.<eos> Any hard feelings between you and Josh about that?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> The hotel next door has been after my place for years.<eos> If I wanted to sell it, it'd take me like 15 minutes.
What are you talking about?<eos> I've never seen that before.<eos> You didn't see this up in Josh's hotel room on his tablet?<eos> I mean, I did, and I'm not even sleeping with the guy.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Josh said he had a great idea for remodeling Dwight's bar.<eos> But he never showed me that.<eos> He never showed you Maggie's place?<eos> That's what Josh wanted to call it.
The life savings that Kyle said you gave to Josh to help him buy Dwight's bar.<eos> From what, my tip jar?<eos> I don't have a life savings.<eos> I don't know where Kyle got that idea from.<eos> While you're here, you think maybe you could hit my lower back for me?<eos> No.<eos> While I'm here, do you think maybe you could stop lying to me?<eos> Okay, look.<eos> I gave Josh what I had, which wasn't much -- believe me.<eos> He said his company didn't want to buy Dwight's place because it wasn't inside of a hotel, but that the two of us should buy it, and I could manage it.
It's about supporting Naomi and supporting Navid and... sorry for the tough love, man, but quit your complaining, 'cause you're going.<eos> Simple as that.<eos> The lawyers for the Templeton family called this morning and they are interested in your offer to split the inheritance.<eos> Oh, my gosh, you have no idea how bad I needed to hear some good news.<eos> There's just one outstanding issue.<eos> The family started cataloging the estate to determine how to divide the assets, and it appears there's a necklace missing.<eos> Oh, that's not missing.<eos> Marla gave me that necklace as a gift.<eos> Great.<eos> We'll need to return it for appraisal.

We're closing now.<eos> Look, I know that you said you can't give me a name, but if you would just hear me out....<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We take the confidentiality of our customers very seriously.<eos> You have a nice night, now.<eos> But... but when I sold you the necklace, I didn't even realize that it was a family heirloom.<eos> I... I... It was, it was my grandmother's.<eos> Marla Templeton was your grandmother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, and if I don't get it back right away, then I'm gonna be in so much trouble.
I don't mind helping.<eos> It's really not a big deal.<eos> No, it is a big deal.<eos> Mom, you can't treat her like that.<eos> She's my guest.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> She's my intern.<eos> You're the one who took my internship.<eos> Oh, she didn't take anything.<eos> She earned it.
Leila, this is not a good time.<eos> What?<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I knew you were a gold digger, But I never pegged you for a common thief.<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> Give me the necklace.<eos> No.<eos> It's mine, and you know it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I'll take it.
In case you haven't noticed, she's dead.<eos> Well, don't you care about what marla wanted?<eos> Why would I care about her?<eos> She sure as hell didn't care about me.<eos> Well, maybe if you spent some times with her...<eos> I mean, she was a pretty incredible woman.<eos> I really loved her.<eos> You loved her so much you sold the necklace Before her body got cold.<eos> I sold it so that my brother could go to school.<eos> How did you even know That I didn't have it?
I just have to get busy.<eos> I have this meeting with Juice Randall tomorrow and I only have two tracks done.<eos> I been staring at this freaking computer program for hours.<eos> I'm gonna have to pull an all-nighter, and I'm already losing energy.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> That's no problem, man.<eos> I can help you with that.<eos> I got my, uh, ADHD medication in here somewhere.<eos> Here you go.<eos> I've been prescribed it since I was a kid.

Here.<eos> That's my mother's handwriting.<eos> She had to be the one to put the spell on Heather.<eos> I need to know why.<eos> It's a suppression spell of some kind.<eos> Why would my mother do that?<eos> She would never hurt someone like this.<eos> Not the mother I knew.<eos> I'm sorry, Cassie.<eos> Does it say how to undo it?
Pretty sure it's in the back.<eos> Look, I need you to text Cassie and tell her that Jane's home already.<eos> Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.<eos> Jane was performing a spell over his body when I got there, and I didn't want to risk leaving behind any signs of magic.<eos> No one will find his body.<eos> I moved it.
It's not brain surgery.<eos> It's kind of why my grandma and me didn't get along.<eos> I mean, she'd go full smoke-machine, but she still actually believed in all that stuff, so...<eos> You don't?<eos> You do?<eos> I've got an open mind.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Hmm.<eos> I'm sorry to have to ask, b-but there's a necklace of your grandmother's.<eos> Don't have it.
The original nuns at the Priory were French aristocrats, Inspector, and the present lot regard themselves as their heirs.<eos> Whatever was going on, they'd put up a show in front of the servants.<eos> It is essentially how they see me.<eos> And you resent that, understandably. Not at all.<eos> I find it quite amusing.<eos> But for their own sakes, I wish they'd be a little more open to good advice.<eos> Can you give us an example?<eos> They need to adapt to the modern age.<eos> It's absurd, four women... three now... rattling round in that huge building, when they haven't the money to maintain it.<eos> I've told them they should move somewhere more modest, rent the Priory out, sell it.
So... How can I help you, gentlemen?<eos> By telling us how you acquired the Midsomer Priory chapel silver.<eos> If you don't mind, sir.<eos> (SIGHS) Good afternoon, Mr Barnaby, Mr Jones.<eos> What is it now?<eos> Thank you, Catherine.<eos> Good news for once, Mother Julian.<eos> We've found your silver.<eos> Where?<eos> A dealer called Peter de Winter is about to export it to a private museum in Chicago.
They're guilty, and now we can prove it.<eos> Did you miss me?<eos> This doesn't just look bad, it is bad.<eos> Homicide is a capital offense in the state of Pennsylvania, and you girls are going down.<eos> Dr. Sullivan, Are you home?<eos> Hi, You've reached Anne Sullivan.<eos> I've been called out of town on a family emergency.<eos> If you need immediate attention, please see your physician for a referral.<eos> I got the same voicemail.<eos> Yeah, she probably sent it to all of her clients.
Because the thing you didn't know is that yesterday Kelsey Price bought United International.<eos> You shouldn't go behind people's backs, Louis.<eos> You shouldn't try and access information that's none of your business.<eos> It could backfire.<eos> I think we need to talk to Harvey.<eos> I'm sorry, Harvey.<eos> You set me up.<eos> No, Louis.<eos> You set yourself up.<eos> The sales offer was meaningless until you read it.
Against all odds, they found each other.<eos> I know what that's like.<eos> And you do, too.<eos> So we just have to play that, okay?<eos> We, as actors, have to tap into that.<eos> Okay?<eos> Shouldn't you be celebrating?<eos> I'm going over this move.<eos> I messed it up tonight.<eos> I know I can do it better.
Uh, today, after school.<eos> Bring your Trouble Tones.<eos> Are you suggesting what I think you are?<eos> Yeah, I am. Dodgeball.<eos> Hey, Rachel.<eos> Hi.<eos> As you might have heard, I'm applying to the New York Academy of Dramatic Arts.<eos> Ugh! All the girls who beat me out in the auditions when I was in New York, they all graduated from there.<eos> Well, my grades are perfect, and I was the lead in the school musical and I plan on winning the election for student class president, so I just need a letter, a killer letter of recommendation.<eos> Wait. You're asking me to write it?

You're asking me to write it?<eos> Actually, I've, I've already written it, so all you would have to do is just sign, and my resumé's in there as well with the letter, so...
Would you like something to drink?<eos> Do I look like I need a drink?<eos> I was only trying to help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now that was an awfully big threat.<eos> Destroy everyone's happiness?<eos> How do you plan on accomplishing that?<eos> The dark curse.<eos> Are you sure, your majesty?<eos> You said you'd never use it.
The dark curse?<eos> Really?<eos> You must know that not even its unholy power can bring your loved one back from the dead.<eos> Have you considered a pet?<eos> They can be quite comforting.<eos> The only comfort for me is Snow White's suffering.<eos> Well, it's her wedding night.<eos> I doubt she's suffering right now.<eos> I need that curse.<eos> I know you keep it hidden in the orb above your staff.
I did.<eos> I like cinnamon, too.<eos> Don't you have school?<eos> Duh.<eos> I'm 10.<eos> Walk me.<eos> So what's the deal with you and your mom?<eos> It's not about us.<eos> It's about her curse.<eos> We have to break it.
Has he been seeing you longer than that?<eos> Um... yes, he has.<eos> So it's Regina, isn't it?<eos> Uh, his mother is a... very complicated woman, and, uh, over the years, her attempts to try and bring Henry closer have only backfired.<eos> Why don't you take a look at the file?<eos> Um, see what I mean.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> Well, he talks about you a lot, and you're very important to him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just, uh, see that I get it back, okay?
Your move.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> The forces you're summoning are darker than we can conceive.<eos> Tect me?<eos> It's what I do.<eos> I know.<eos> You're the only one who does.<eos> Helping you is my life.<eos> Well, then help me understand why this curse isn't working.<eos> If you want to know that, then you need to go back to the person who gave it to you in the first place.
I wanted to get to know you.<eos> You think I'm crazy.<eos> No, I think the curse is crazy, and it is.<eos> But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.<eos> It is a lot to ask anyone to believe in, but there are a lot of crazy things in this world.<eos> So what do I know?<eos> Maybe it is true.<eos> But you told my mom... what she needed to hear.<eos> What I do know...<eos> Is that if the curse is real, the only way to break it is by tricking the evil queen...
You don't have to, because you guys are in Level One.<eos> You can't even drink hard alcohol, anyway.<eos> You're trying to trick us. They're trying to trick us 'cause then we'll not drink it and it'll be a rule that we had to drink it.<eos> No, no, it's fine. No tricking us. Hey, we're playing the game.<eos> We're playing the game.<eos> It's Chardee MacDennis. This tastes like water.<eos> This is water.<eos> I knew it!<eos> Well... I knew it was water.<eos> When he threw his beer in my face, I could taste it.
I was out saving people.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And how were you out saving people?<eos> When someone from our family kills a cursed person, we don't just kill their body.<eos> We kill the curse, too.<eos> That's our trouble.<eos> Oh. So you save them from being alive.<eos> Got it.<eos> The curse dies in the whole family.<eos> No one will ever get it again.
I said forget it! Delgado:<eos> I'd love to, sergeant, but if I "forget it," a murderer walks.<eos> How about you do what you've been ordered to do?<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> Okay, read my lips ... I don't know where my C.I. is.<eos> Is that clear enough for you?<eos> Hey, show some respect, sergeant.<eos> Ms. Delgado's just trying to do her job, which is more than I can say for you.<eos> The judge has ordered you to present the informant.<eos> I want his name, and I want it now. Vince, you got to give her the name, even if you don't know where he is.
He interviewed hundreds of people. Yeah.<eos> So...<eos> Exclude any name with an address...<eos> Or a follow-up interview.<eos> Not following you.<eos> Korsak's protecting this informant.<eos> That means, the only thing we're gonna find is a name, all by itself ... that'll be the giveaway.<eos> And that's the name of the informant.<eos> You do have mad skills.<eos> Frost, I got it.
Got it.<eos> DA won't back us up on this one.<eos> They say that the case law is murky.<eos> I'll say it's murky.<eos> A life-extension researcher is killed, then a shadowy cryonics company absconds with the body?<eos> This has all the hallmarks of a vast and insidious conspiracy.<eos> I'm still trying to figure out how to explain it to Gates.<eos> They steal our victim and then threaten to sue us?<eos> Sir, it's a legal chicken-and-egg problem.<eos> Since Hamilton's body is on private property, we can't get it without a warrant, but it's gonna be tough to get a warrant, because without the body, we can't even prove he was murdered.
Came out of nowhere and starts dropping bombs we gotta get him first and find out who provided the bombs<eos> The bomb is already in production?<eos> It's all fine but why kill the chairman and head of development?<eos> Uh... well... Watanabe who oversaw the merger disappeared These incidents must be connected<eos> We're looking into it further<eos> So this is... a national crisis?<eos> You could say that<eos> Call SWAT for back-up get everyone on this case<eos> Yes, sir<eos> We'll close it before the Intelligence Service steps in
I think I know what he wants to be recognized for.<eos> Get up.<eos> Get up!<eos> Robert Adams, we're with the FBI.<eos> We just want to talk to you.<eos> You better drop those guns if you just want to talk.<eos> We know why you're doing this, Bob.<eos> It's pretty obvious, isn't it?<eos> Before tonight, they didn't know my name!<eos> But now... No one will forget it.
What is that about?<eos> They broke up.<eos> ♪ Secret Life of the American Teenager 04x10 ♪ 4-1-1 Original Air Date on August 15, 2011<eos> So, according to the prenup, you don't own the place, but my dad says that you're out of college.<eos> Cable, utilities, all that stuff included.<eos> That's not in the prenup.<eos> I know, but my dad's feeling very generous right now, and he knows that you'll be starting college in the fall, and you can keep it, and everything in it until you graduate.<eos> That's what he said.<eos> Do I have to give you the ring back?<eos> No, you might want to move it to the other hand, but, uh, no. Keep the ring.
Daniel didn't mention that you were coming.<eos> Oh, total impulse.<eos> I hope it's not too much of an intrusion.<eos> Well, he took off early this morning,<eos> God knows where, but you're perfectly welcome to make yourself at home at the pool house if you wish.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Grayson.<eos> Would you be a dear, and show him the way?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry, but I didn't catch your name.<eos> I didn't give it to you.
They either ditched the murder weapon, or there's a third person involved.<eos> All the witnesses described the same two perps.<eos> So then we're looking for a missing gun.<eos> You better get that.<eos> He's called three times this morning.<eos> Yeah, he's a persistent son of a bitch.<eos> Can I have a coffee?<eos> I was, uh...<eos> I was calling to see if you wanted me to bring the event pass by your place.<eos> I'd already picked it up.
Wasn't supposed to happen like that.<eos> They came to the door too late.<eos> Everything okay, Devon?<eos> No!<eos> Sean knew.<eos> He looked right into my eyes.<eos> I was supposed to wait a couple minutes until after they left to call 911.<eos> You know, to look, look like a witness.<eos> Where'd you get the gun?<eos> White Mike gave it to me.
No direct motive, just fits his profile-- she's young, she's blonde.<eos> But 3XK strangled those other women.<eos> Why would he use a gun now?<eos> He told me he likes to change up his M.O.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He must have mentioned that when I was out cold on the floor.<eos> You know, Ryan, none of this is your fault.<eos> The fact that he used your gun--<eos> That weapon was issued to me by the city of New York.<eos> I let it out of my hand, and now a girl is dead.
Were you calling your father, letting him know the job was done?<eos> Please, detective.<eos> His phone pinged?<eos> You know that's not enough to charge him with murder.<eos> Not yet, but give me some time.<eos> Listen, if your client wants to talk deal--<eos> Dream on.<eos> Let's go, Philip.<eos> You killed that girl, and you used my weapon to do it, and now I carry that weight.<eos> Trust me when I say to you that I will not rest until I make you carry it, too.
Is there a problem?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Thought you said you'd never lie to me.<eos> What's the problem, Mr. Reese?<eos> Our guy, Joe Durban...<eos> I've been on him for eight hours, and all he's done is open doors for old ladies, and now he's going window shopping.<eos> If the machine's given us his number, he must be caught up in something.<eos> He got a text, it's a bit garbled.<eos> Sending it over.
Okay.<eos> This ends now.<eos> Ah. Mom, you're going back to the farm.<eos> And you, you're going back to hell.<eos> Fine.<eos> I got what I came for anyway.<eos> I found your underground safe.<eos> I stole half your gold.<eos> That's decoy gold.<eos> You think I'd leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground, where anyone could find it?
No, Dad, I don't want you to hurt Morgan.<eos> I love him.<eos> I just...<eos> I just don't understand how he could be so awful, you know?<eos> Just tell me what to do.<eos> He just...<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> I just want the old Morgan back, you know?<eos> I know it hurts, honey.<eos> We Caseys-- we don't like to open up, make ourselves vulnerable. 'Cause when someone does rip our heart out and stomp on it right in front of our eyes, it could be like the worst torture of all.
But maybe the old paint did.<eos> They scraped off the underpass, probably because it contains...<eos> Lead.<eos> - Chest pain back? - Worse this time.<eos> Is there any way to take the edge off?<eos> We're still working on the lungs.<eos> We should know soon.<eos> Soon is good.<eos> How's the chelation going?<eos> Reverend Moon started it about 20 minutes ago.
Saving one life is good, saving two is better.<eos> You give away two kidneys, and you die.<eos> I could live on dialysis for years.<eos> Yes, and then you die.<eos> And then I could donate my other organs, heart, lungs.<eos> I could save four or five more lives.<eos> Foreman's going to need a diagnostician.<eos> This guy is crazy.<eos> Arrhythmia, muscle tremors, and yes, mental changes.<eos> If his heart doesn't rupture, he's liable to rip it out and give it away.
Yes.<eos> I hope Amy likes it.<eos> You know who Amy is?<eos> Who is Amy?<eos> Mommy.<eos> Do you want me to give Mommy the ring?<eos> No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Okay, well, I'm not going to give it to her yet.<eos> I'm going to wait and give it to her the night I graduate from high school.
Can we please just be done?<eos> Don't respond.<eos> You're fragile.<eos> We'll let you know when you've atoned after you've atoned.<eos> Babe, it's almost over.<eos> This is the last stop.<eos> Why are we at Jenna Hamilton's house?<eos> Didn't you say you'd do anything for me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Take this letter, knock on Jenna's door, and read it to her.
Previously on Awkward.<eos> Jenna, I like you.<eos> I'm just not sure I'm ready to be in a relationship.<eos> Everyone thinks I tried to kill myself, and there's a lame guy selling T-shirts keeping the stupid story alive.<eos> - I kissed Jenna Hamilton!<eos> - What?<eos> It's obviously, uh, a very important day.<eos> In high school, attention was a drug.<eos> Everyone was jonesing for it.
Okay, hum, now, to tell you more, about drunk driving awareness day, Miss Marks.<eos> Check, one two.<eos> Hot mic. [Clears throat]<eos> This year, our annual play to raise drunk driving awareness is gonna be driven into the millennia.<eos> Everybody, welcome to Crash'd!<eos> Same characters, same story, new flava.<eos> It stands for counselors, me, raising awareness for students, you, who, "W" is silent, drink.<eos> I knew that'd get your attention.<eos> Attention was weird.<eos> The people who had it seemed not to want it, and the people who didn't have it seemed to want nothing more.
No, I do.<eos> It's just a--it's a--<eos> There's--we have a-- Complicated issue for us.<eos> Yeah, I mean, we have a son that has Asperger's.<eos> And so if it's a girl the chances are lower, right?<eos> But it's your call.<eos> All right.<eos> - Yeah, you sure?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Okay, let me get an image, and I'm gonna freeze it.
Well, I meant every word.<eos> I want to help you any way I can.<eos> Great. Well, uh, first thing tomorrow, I'll take you out to see the construction site.<eos> Yes, we may think we're all destined to play certain roles.<eos> But sometimes those roles can unexpectedly change.<eos> A nervous student may discover a hidden confidence.<eos> A longtime wife may confront a harsh new reality.<eos> A busy mother may find her attention is needed elsewhere.<eos> And a woman who wanted to do a little bit of good may find herself playing a much bigger role than she intended.<eos> I was searching and searching for the perfect spot, and then I found it...
You can stop sneaking cigarettes and just start taking deep breaths.<eos> I need to go to the bathroom.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> I need to go.<eos> Vi, it's a freeway.<eos> Really, where do you want me to pull over?<eos> Maybe the Honda next to us has a bathroom or something.<eos> Bet if baby had to shit, you'd find somewhere.<eos> Come on.<eos> Violet, I hate that word, unless I'm saying it.
Yes!<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It is, if what you're saying is true.<eos> It is, and all you have to do is sign on the dotted line.<eos> What a lovely quill!<eos> Wherever did you get it?<eos> It's from our castle.<eos> You know, the only way to stop me is through magic.<eos> I'm not trying to stop you.<eos> Of course you're not, because as we all know, all magic comes with a price, and if you were to use it to, say... imprison me, then your debt to me would only grow,
I'll take you to Poppy's tacos.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll wait for you in the parking lot.<eos> Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> I thought I was gonna pick up John at the graduation.<eos> Doesn't he want to see his dad graduate?<eos> I know I do.<eos> I want to hear the speech.<eos> I have a dress here I want to get.<eos> I'm just stopping by to get it.
Beautiful.<eos> Was she having problems with anybody that you know of?<eos> Everybody loved her.<eos> Boyfriend?<eos> No.<eos> Did you find her ring?<eos> Ring?<eos> A moonstone-- like, a shimmery blue.<eos> Junot gave it to her.<eos> I know he's gonna want it.
Yeah.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, Marshall, my name is Pete Durkenson.<eos> We went to Wesleyan together.<eos> Yeah, no, I know.<eos> Pete, we... we just hung out yesterday.<eos> All right, now Lily's message makes a little more sense.<eos> Listen, don't worry, bro, I'm gonna take down the video.<eos> You know what?<eos> Leave it up.
We are on the murder house tour, for God's sakes.<eos> Marcy, do you know any of these fluffers?<eos> Can you get one for us immediately?<eos> Yes, a wonderful English lady, a real pro, but she's more expensive than the young gay fellow I know.<eos> Let's go with the gay fellow.<eos> Gay fellow.<eos> I'll call the fluffer.<eos> Halloween comes from the Celtic holiday of Samhain.<eos> It commemorated the end of the harvest festival.<eos> They celebrated it to ward off their fears.
Wouldn't it, Shiv?<eos> Yes.<eos> If you'll excuse me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, don't thank me yet.<eos> I have a favor to ask you.<eos> These last 24 hours have been torture, knowing Henry's cheating on me, pretending like nothing's happened.<eos> I can't even imagine.<eos> He was the love of my life.<eos> I gave him my whole heart, and he just crushed it.
We can always buy one and share.<eos> Like, forever?<eos> Hey, Siobhan.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it's just the food.<eos> Um, excuse me for one second.<eos> "Dear Bridget,<eos> "thanks for sending back the necklace.<eos> "Seeing it made me realize how much I've missed you.

That's what you were looking for?<eos> What do we have here?<eos> What is that?<eos> That... is proof that this El Asesino's gun.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> Anita... it's not what you think.<eos> Anita!<eos> - That's not my gun!<eos> - Yeah, whose gun is it, then?<eos> - I found it!
Yeah.<eos> Well, I traced the serial number.<eos> It belongs to a lot that was sold by the manufacturer directly to Fuller estate management.<eos> - As in Steve Fuller?<eos> - Owner of the McClaren mansion.<eos> That means that Fuller knew about that room and didn't tell us.<eos> There's only reason why he wouldn't tell us.<eos> Because he's the killer.<eos> Maybe Matt Benton was right about Melanie having an affair, only wrong about who she was having the affair with.<eos> And when things went bad, he killed her, killed Matt, and stashed his body in his own house where he knew no one would find it.
Madam, I promise I do.<eos> You enter a room... expecting him there and he is not.<eos> You smile at some small thing and anticipate recounting it to him but you cannot.<eos> You chase a painful idea... around in your head that,<eos> "If only I had done or not done this or that thing..."<eos> "..he would still be standing beside me now."<eos> But you cannot.<eos> And he is not.<eos> It seems... you have the shape of my grief.<eos> I wonder, then, how you refuse a service which might, in some degree, abate it.
You don't find it strange that someone rents an apartment from you then doesn't use it?<eos> He's my best tenant.<eos> Doesn't make any noise.<eos> His business manager sends a check, every month, on time.<eos> Guy who lives in this dump like this has a business manager?<eos> No offense.<eos> What's the business manager's name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I got the name in my apartment.<eos> Now I suppose you want me to go down and get it.
Nothing could keep me from your wedding, unless I died of old age before it happened.<eos> Well, by looking at your crow's-feet, we were cutting it pretty close.<eos> Tomorrow is gonna be so incredible.<eos> Just like we used to dream about as kids.<eos> And I'm gonna get married in Vegas at the Rio.<eos> I'm gonna have a beautiful wedding dress.<eos> Spandex, but classy.<eos> Well, mine's gonna be that hyper-colored material that changes color when you touch it, so you can see my husband's hot handprints on my butt.<eos> Well, my wedding dress is going to be bedazzled from head-to-toe with an eight-foot train.<eos> Well, mine's gonna be beaded with real antique Spanish coins and have an 80-foot train, and the back of it is gonna be held aloft by Michael Jackson.
Just finishing up.<eos> No, you're all finished.<eos> Come on, you're done.<eos> Do five.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Talking about the fact that you killed Jake Griffin.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Then you went to the hardware store to cover up the crime, which is a good indication to me that you weren't planning on killing him.<eos> Right, but when you did, you wanted the cops to be looking the other way, so, you covered it up and made it look like one of those home invasion crimes you saw on the news.
And wasteful.<eos> Do you guys know how much food do we waste?<eos> It's not food.<eos> It's garbage.<eos> But it's not.<eos> Look.<eos> She's digging through the trash.<eos> See?<eos> A perfectly good apple.<eos> You can still eat it.
No, why?<eos> Well, it looks like your handwriting.<eos> It's addressed to your dad and me.<eos> - Mom, stop!<eos> - What?<eos> Uh, I forgot.<eos> I - I did write this... letter when I was upset, when I knew you and dad weren't telling me the truth about, um, you know.<eos> So I'm guessing the letter says things you're no longer feeling?<eos> No, It's stuff I didn't mean.<eos> Why don't you tear it up?
I'm confused. I thought our crime scene blew up.<eos> No...<eos> Detective Wells was able to examine the scene briefly.<eos> I see.<eos> Right.<eos> So, like I was saying, I think we looked into the wrong account.<eos> Can you give us a moment?<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> - Why are we over here? - Because I'd rather keep the scope of our investigation at this point to ourselves until...<eos> - Until we're ready to present it coherently to our ADA.
I mean most of these children don't even have shoes.<eos> Excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Clarence Traingrove I'm very keen on that property and my offer of 50 pounds - still stands.<eos> - Yes. Good!<eos> All right!<eos> - Um...what do we do now?<eos> - Hold on!<eos> Why are you so interested in that book?<eos> I was raised outside Turner in a little place just like that.<eos> and when I first saw it, it reminded me of my dear departed mother and father. Yeah.
Nice duds.<eos> Hey, those are my pants!<eos> Last time, I was aiming to miss.<eos> I knew you wanted to get into my pants!<eos> - Oh, don't flatter yourself!<eos> - Alright, alright!<eos> Easy, easy, easy, easy!<eos> Now, what were you saying?<eos> What do you know about the gold?<eos> I know there's a way to get it.
The only reason I'm giving you this job is because your father owns the paper.<eos> So keep out of my way and we might get along.<eos> - Can you make coffee? - No.<eos> - Wrong answer.<eos> - I'll learn! Good.<eos> These need to be covered for the next issue.<eos> Surprise me, show me you can write.<eos> The baptism of Luke Jeffreys, school fete, obituaries...<eos> What about the story on a female bushranger everyone is talking about? Sure.<eos> You give me an exclusive interview, I'll print it.
They're killing everyone who had contact with that recording.<eos> If they're going tothis much trouble, They'll be coming after Ms. Morgan.<eos> You need to stay with her. That's going to be a problem.<eos> I want to tell someone.<eos> Keeps me up at night.<eos> I'm working on the audio.<eos> Interference suggests It was made on an old P. C.S. Cell network. Making the recording at least two years old.<eos> I didn't know static had a vintage.<eos> I did manage to find a match on the woman's voice.<eos> Compared it against video From social networking sites, corporate press.
That's it.<eos> I'm done.<eos> I love this band.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they're sort of, like--like the Decemberists meets Wild Horses.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Hey, I, um, I sort of rammed my shoulder the other day.<eos> It's really killing me.<eos> Would you mind...<eos> - Rubbing it? - Yeah.
Maybe this is normal for him.<eos> Maybe it's not.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So this is not normal?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Hey, Haddie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did you take your college essay back?<eos> Yeah, I took it back.
Maybe it's not.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So this is not normal?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Hey, Haddie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did you take your college essay back?<eos> Yeah, I took it back.<eos> Oh, well, I wanted to read it.
I don't know.<eos> So this is not normal?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Hey, Haddie.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did you take your college essay back?<eos> Yeah, I took it back.<eos> Oh, well, I wanted to read it.<eos> I took it 'cause you were sleeping on it.
I miss you too, kiddo.<eos> Oh, babe.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you too.<eos> A lot.<eos> The alarm didn't go off yet, right?<eos> A few more minutes.<eos> - Do you like mango?<eos> - I hope.<eos> I've never actually eaten it, so...
It came back three times worse.<eos> But that's not why you brought suit.<eos> No.<eos> About a month after my operation, I received an itemized bill for the SCS.<eos> On it was listed the manufacturer and the inventor.<eos> And who was the inventor?<eos> My doctor, Dr. Farland.<eos> And this device he invented... it was not FDA-approved?<eos> That's right.<eos> He just implanted it in me like I was a guinea pig.
You just tell him what you told me.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I got a call from someone at the Vindicator.<eos> She asked if I had an opinion about the results of the medical investigation of Dr. Farland.<eos> The...? I don't understand.<eos> - It's a year off.<eos> - I know.<eos> She said the FDA expedited it.
No matter where you go, I'm gonna find you and come and see you.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> I'd like that, too.<eos> Austin!<eos> ♪ ♪ We got him.<eos> Yes, we did.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Who's Marisol?<eos> How'd you know her name?<eos> Apparently, you kept repeating it in the ambulance.
The lost and found, hooked on to some crazy helmet.<eos> Where's my TARDIS?<eos> Okay.<eos> How about a "Thank you, Greg, for finding my ear" "in the trash"?<eos> I don't care about my ear.<eos> I care about the TARDIS.<eos> We care about the ear, Keith.<eos> Keith, try not to move, okay?<eos> Fine.<eos> Can you at least... keep it in the living room so I can look at it?

But what if my foot was hurting, or my leg?<eos> I'm not giving up a bed for a stalker with fake symptoms.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I have chest pains, which means you... you have to admit me and keep me for observation, right?<eos> Keith reinjured his spine, creating an epidural bleed that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.<eos> So does the ear.<eos> His ear is cosmetic.<eos> The bleed could leave him paralyzed.<eos> The ear's been detached for over 20 hours.<eos> If we don't reattach it soon, it won't be viable at all.

You don't think so, and she doesn't think so.<eos> She?<eos> Allie?<eos> You think Allie's going to blame you because your baby's missing?<eos> She'll find a way.<eos> I need to talk to somebody.<eos> What do you got there?<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Mr. Hernandez says he just bought the car seat from a peddler in Tompkins Square.<eos> He brought it home, his wife recognized it from the news.
I put the suit on to demonstrate to you that we are in good faith, I only ask... to take me to get an examination, to verify this for you.<eos> These are normal wounds... from the shipwreck. And also burns caused by the sun, but... the girl who was ill has improved, she just took... medicine.<eos> And the rest of us do not... we do not have symptoms. Of any kind.<eos> Captain... this... this ship is the only hope we have.<eos> Julia, Julia, Julia!<eos> Back!<eos> - Do not take another step!<eos> - For the love of God, Julia!<eos> Where did you get this weapon?<eos> Lower it, please.
Mr. and Mrs. Bartowski, right this way.<eos> ♪ Na-na na-na na-na<eos> ♪ Na-na na-na na-na<eos> ♪ Na-na na-na na-na<eos> To a very special night.<eos> And a few little surprises.<eos> Babe, you look beautiful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I, uh, I wanted something a little different, so I borrowed a dress from Sarah.<eos> She wore it on a mission in Bulgaria once.
So I assume you found something wonderfully relevant.<eos> Not to rub it in, but I did, actually.<eos> The tape had more than just muscle tissue on it.<eos> It also contained a piece of an artery.<eos> - We found a cause of death.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Whatever the weapon was...<eos> - Mm-hmm. ...hit the right sternocleidomastoid muscle and severed the right subclavian artery.<eos> Leaving behind that tape.<eos> Maybe the handle on the weapon was loose, and they tried to tape it up?
"In your honor, I will drink the blood of the virgin.<eos> Signed, Your Eternal Disciple." Huh.<eos> Creep carried it out on Andrea.<eos> You lift any prints off that letter?<eos> Calleigh's working another angle, but we got to get a hold of this woman, Marilyn.<eos> I'll get on it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is that the vampire letter?<eos> Yep. Mm.<eos> Okay, so why didn't you take it to Questioned Documents?

Yeah, I know.<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> What are you doing later?<eos> I'm going to hang out with Peter.<eos> OK.<eos> I was going to see some friends anyway, so...<eos> You have a secret lair.<eos> This is totally superhero.<eos> How did you find this place?<eos> I didn't find it.
I think he says he misses your roast dinners.<eos> It's my husband!<eos> He's saying, he's saying...<eos> He's saying something about a ring.<eos> I lost my wedding ring.<eos> A wedding ring.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's in the U-bend of the sink of the downstairs bathroom.<eos> OK.<eos> He says don't try and get it out yourself.
Want a Camaro?<eos> Huh?<eos> We got a new shipment in yesterday.<eos> No, I...<eos> Shh.<eos> I have loved you since I was 16.<eos> Sweetheart, please.<eos> This-This didn't mean anything.<eos> You've broken my heart for the last time.<eos> We were just getting it back, Ben.
Take this and collect a urine sample... and when you come back I want you to tell me what the three words were.<eos> What do you want this for? I need to check your kidney function.<eos> A kidney infection could cause abdominal pain and a confused mental state.<eos> Oh. Is that likely to happen, then?<eos> It's something to look out for, yes.<eos> Right.<eos> Yes.<eos> How cheap was this?<eos> We're saving 60p a bottle, compared to the old house red.<eos> I suppose if nobody buys it we can repackage it as fragrant paint stripper.
A little, but don't fret. Come on.<eos> There's nothing in your closet I'm gonna wanna wear.<eos> - What about this?<eos> - You'd let me wearing this dress?<eos> Special times call for special circumstances.<eos> Try it on.<eos> You know, that dress was specially made for Nana when she was a model.<eos> I used to think if I could look as good as her in it, that she would love me as much she loved that dress.<eos> - Isn't that silly? - Yes.<eos> The only time she ever let me wear it was to my prom.
I gotta get to Leena's.<eos> Once the shackle is activated, I'm afraid no one can get in or out.<eos> Claudia!<eos> I want you to--<eos> Artie, I have a bad feeling.<eos> I have a bad vibe.<eos> But you said that nothing could get in once the barrier was up.<eos> True, but it can't stop something that's already inside.<eos> The Regents wanted to know our vulnerability.<eos> I think we just found it.
True, but it can't stop something that's already inside.<eos> The Regents wanted to know our vulnerability.<eos> I think we just found it.<eos> Amazing.<eos> The warehouse.<eos> You guys! Run!<eos> Bastard.<eos> No!<eos> No.<eos> They must have shut it down from the other side.
No, I can't.<eos> I've never seen more than zero people in here.<eos> Dad, this is because of my ideas!<eos> I love marketing!<eos> I bet.<eos> - Look, we're talking business. - I know!<eos> And I haven't thought about the Kardashians for hours.<eos> Yo, peeps.<eos> Kyle?<eos> I got a tweet about this place, thought I'd check it out.
I love you.<eos> All right, are we clear?<eos> We're clear.<eos> Watch that window, Puck.<eos> Everyone make sure this room isn't bugged.<eos> We don't have a lot of time.<eos> You've been told Asperger's is real.<eos> It isn't. It's just a front that we use to stay hidden. Wait.<eos> It's not a real illness? Of course not!<eos> If there was a social development disease, you wouldn't call it "ass burgers."
Okay, keep it small.<eos> I'll send Rollins and Fin to the apartment with CSU.<eos> Think you can get his DNA?<eos> He used a condom and flushed it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Almost done.<eos> Next, I'll use a special instrument that can take photos of any trauma.<eos> Now, Sarah, you said that you gave him a beer?<eos> It's on my coffee table.<eos> I haven't moved it.
I'll take my own rover.<eos> Don't worry, Malcolm, I'll be your eyes out there.<eos> You'll get a full report.<eos> Thank you, Elisabeth.<eos> Lieutenant Washington is in command while I'm off-colony.<eos> You need anything, you talk to her.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> All right, be safe.<eos> Oh, no, my wedding ring.<eos> I took it off before surgery this morning.

Look, we did a good thing.<eos> The men you took out killed that girl's entire family.<eos> She's the only heir to a massive fortune, so whoever has her has access to it.<eos> She's the key.<eos> And you want the money.<eos> Listen, I know this job is the only thing in your life, but someday you're gonna realize it's not enough, that keeping your whole life a secret from everyone who loves you is too much.<eos> But you don't have a family.<eos> That money's just for you.<eos> And what's going to happen to her when you take it?<eos> She has a legitimate claim to that fortune, then she can come back at any time and take it from you.
It just went down the wrong pipe.<eos> Whoa.<eos> If Lily and Marshall want me to click on it, maybe Janet really does have a deep, dark secret.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm a prostitute.<eos> You didn't think I was actually into you, did you?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Get it together, Mosby.<eos> Oh.<eos> You don't buy beer, you rent it.
Let's jump right in.<eos> Murder House, built by Dr. Charles and Nora Montgomery.<eos> They lived there with their son Thaddeus.<eos> That is, until the baby was kidnapped and found dismembered.<eos> If Mother could see me now... polishing my own silver...<eos> Charles, look at me.<eos> Oh, I wish I were a widow.<eos> I certainly look the part.<eos> I bought this dress for my mother's funeral.<eos> Who ever thought I'd be wearing it again... to bury my son.
Turn right here.<eos> I know this neighborhood.<eos> It's derelict.<eos> It's a perfect place to set up a drug operation.<eos> Okay, they stopped.<eos> Slow down.<eos> They're just a few hundred feet up ahead.<eos> Let's park here.<eos> How many months has Sac PD's Narco team been looking for Vega's hideout?<eos> We found it in one day.
Dwight, there's just the small matter of--<eos> You know what would go so great with this cabbage pie?<eos> Milk.<eos> Any specific animal?<eos> - I'm thinking cow.<eos> - Don't say cow. Ugh.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's five to five.<eos> Just don't talk about the email, okay?<eos> He's gonna cancel it on his own.
Let me see.<eos> This is a Druid tongue.<eos> The bind runes are in threes, that's rare.<eos> I can save you the trouble.<eos> They guide the bearer to the tomb of Askhanar.<eos> Yes.<eos> We both know the legend.<eos> We both know what he hid there.<eos> A dragon's egg.<eos> And you have come to steal it?
But with this Triskellion, someone could?<eos> Sire, a dragon's egg can live for 1,000 years - even today, it could still hatch and another dragon be born into the world.<eos> My father's work to rid the world of these monsters would be undone. That must be our fear.<eos> Then we have no choice - we must hunt down this intruder and destroy the egg.<eos> How could you be so stupid?<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> I am a Dragonlord.<eos> It's my sacred duty to protect the last of the dragons.<eos> The tomb could have remained closed for another 400 years and the egg would have been completely safe.<eos> Now Arthur's riding out, intent on destroying it.
He set it off.<eos> He never got out.<eos> What about the egg?<eos> It would've perished with him.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We need to be certain.<eos> Nothing's going to survive under all that.<eos> Shame about the egg.<eos> Yes.<eos> You weren't able to save it?
That she was the hardest-working heiress I'd ever met.<eos> I'd come in 2:00, 3:00 in the morning.<eos> She was always there with that beautiful smile.<eos> Kelly Latimer, of the Texas Latimers.<eos> Tell me about the necklace.<eos> She told me it was a family heirloom.<eos> Was I mad when I found out it was one of those rental jobs?<eos> Sure.<eos> But I would never do anything to hurt Kelly.<eos> What about the people you sold it to?
Can you believe it?<eos> He's coming to interview Axl.<eos> (Crunch)<eos> Eh... three... Four... Five.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> He's coming to interview Axl.<eos> Six. Ooh.<eos> Yep, if we had any chance of impressing this recruiter, we were gonna have to put on a big show, so I sent the kids to borrow a fancy chip platter.<eos> (Blows air) (Sue and Brick cough)<eos> And tell her to keep it.

You don't deserve to be here.<eos> Are you still filming, Abed?<eos> Yeah, but try not to address me.<eos> I'm not really here.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> I don't think I can finish my commercial.<eos> But I think I know how your documentary ends.<eos> Hi, I'm Craig Pelton, Dean of Greendale Community College.<eos> I have failed this school.<eos> I have failed it because I thought I was better than Greendale.
My son.<eos> We need a new treatment plan.<eos> Everything I do he thinks is part of some horrible plot.<eos> I can't cover up a safety hazard without him thinking I'm hiding something.<eos> How am I hiding something terrible in an old mine?<eos> How is any of this logical to him?<eos> He's got an amazing imagination.<eos> Yes, that you let run rampant.<eos> Well, I think it would be wrong to rip away the world he's constructed.<eos> I'd rather use it to try and get-- sometimes I think you've forgotten.
I don't even know her.<eos> That-I-I can't take this.<eos> Just because you don't know her doesn't mean you won't grow to love her.<eos> True love follows this ring wherever it goes, my son.<eos> I had it with your father.<eos> I've had it as your mother.<eos> Now you will have it.<eos> - Take it. - No.<eos> No.<eos> Take it, and I'll know...
Because I have so much to offer-- a place at my court.<eos> You will become my official huntsman.<eos> I'm not interested in being a pet.<eos> This place is a cage.<eos> You'd be awash in luxury, wanting for nothing.<eos> You have an army at your disposal.<eos> What do you need of me?<eos> My prey is beloved by all the kingdom.<eos> I need someone who won't be blinded by that-- someone without compassion.<eos> Someone... Who will have no qualms carving a heart out and bringing it back for my collection.
How is that possible?<eos> Well, you two do have a special connection.<eos> She owes you her life.<eos> Why?<eos> Snow White's her mother, and you spared her.<eos> If you hadn't...<eos> My mom wouldn't have been born.<eos> Well, what happened after I spared Snow White?<eos> The Queen took your heart.<eos> She ripped it out.
Pretty much everyone.<eos> I think maybe you need to go home and get some rest.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> No, Graham, you're not fine.<eos> You just went to see a 10-year-old for help.<eos> He's the only one making any sense.<eos> What's going on?<eos> What's... Really going on?<eos> It's my heart, Emma.<eos> I need to find it.
Using just two simple carbon rods,<eos> Humphry Davy was about to unleash the true potential of electricity.<eos> Electricity is one of nature's most awesome phenomena, and the most powerful manifestation of it we ever see is lightning.<eos> This is the story of how we first dreamed of controlling this primal force of nature, and how we would ultimately become its master.<eos> It's a 300-year tale of dazzling leaps of imagination and extraordinary experiments.<eos> Tens of thousands of volts passed across his body and through the end of a lamp that he was holding.<eos> It's a story of a maverick geniuses who used electricity to light our cities, to communicate across the seas and through the air, to create modern industry and to give us the digital revolution.<eos> But in this film, we'll tell the story of the very first scientists who started to unlock the mysteries of electricity.<eos> It's as though there's something alive in there.<eos> They studied its curious link to life, built strange and powerful instruments to create it and even tamed lightning itself.
But that would take place not in Britain, but across the Channel in mainland Europe.<eos> Across the Channel, electricians were just as busy as their British counterparts and one centre for electrical research was here in Leiden, Holland.<eos> And it was here that a professor came up with an invention that many still regard as the most significant of the 18th century, one that in some form or another can still be found in almost every electrical device today.<eos> That professor was Pieter van Musschenbroek.<eos> Unlike Hauksbee and Gray,<eos> Musschenbroek was born into academia.<eos> But ironically enough, his breakthrough came not because of his rigorous science, but because of a simple human mistake.<eos> He was trying to find a way to store electrical charge, ready for his demonstrations.<eos> And you can almost hear his train of thought as he tries to figure this out.<eos> If electricity is a fluid that flows, a bit like water, then maybe you can store it in the same way that you can store water.
that seemed sacrilegious to them, because it was eliminating this boundary between God's realm of the divine and the mundane realm of the material.<eos> Spurred on by his religious indignation,<eos> Galvani announced a new series of experimental results, which would prove Volta was wrong.<eos> During one of his experiments, he hung his frogs on an iron wire and saw something totally unexpected.<eos> If he connected copper wire to the wire the frog was hanging from, and then touched the other end of the copper to the nerve... ..it seemed to him he could make the frog's legs twitch without any electricity at all.<eos> Galvani came to the conclusion that it must have been something inside the frogs, even if dead, that continued for a while after death to produce some kind of electricity.<eos> And the metal wires were somehow releasing that electricity.<eos> Over the next months, Galvani's experiments focused on isolating this animal electricity using combinations of frog and metal, Leiden jars and electrical machines.<eos> For Galvani, these experiments were proof the electricity was originating within the frog itself.<eos> The frog's muscles were Leiden jars, storing up the electrical fluid and then releasing it in a burst.
I trusted both of you.<eos> I know.<eos> Look, Michael, I really, I am so...<eos> I'm sorry. Please don't let Davíd suffer because of what I did.<eos> I... if the mom's a match, I'll pay for the transplant.<eos> What?<eos> Aw, Kate, come on.<eos> Even if he was a citizen, a transplant's $100,00.<eos> My grant is unrestricted.<eos> I can use it however I want.
Kate looked at Alexander with pity more than anything.<eos> "Fine," she said. "Go.<eos> Go wherever the hell you want," "but first, you're gonna apologize."<eos> Why?<eos> Why what?<eos> - Why is he apologizing?<eos> - Alexander? Because he stole the ring that Nathan gave her in book two.<eos> What? Nathan gave her a ring.<eos> Yes, he did, in book two.<eos> Does Alexander know that Nathan gave it to her?
Can't be that easy, can it?<eos> You get a ride with the sheriff.<eos> I need the car. What?<eos> Why, what for?<eos> Because before I try to talk to Amanda about how her parents were drug dealers, I need to go get you and I a couple of motel rooms because obviously we're gonna be sticking around for a while.<eos> Don't you wish you had packed a bag now? Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you, a giraffe?<eos> Hey, I have that seat right how I like it.<eos> If you move it, you better know how to move it back.

This tyrannosaur wasn't killed by Nothronychus.<eos> There's a more deadly killer at work here.<eos> All the predator's bones were found alongside the edge of an ancient stagnant lake.<eos> And all of them died at the same time.<eos> Similar mass killings have been found today among birds.<eos> And the killer - a fast-acting, naturally occurring deadly disease.<eos> Botulism.<eos> Botulism is caused by bacteria that can thrive in rotting carcasses.<eos> We think that the dinosaurs too might have been victims of this lethal and invisible killer.<eos> Once a carcass is poisoned, it is quickly passed on to any animal that eats it.
There. 3f.<eos> All right.<eos> You're here.<eos> Goodbye. Go organize.<eos> No, I said you have to wait until I open the door and check out if it's safe.<eos> It's my day off.<eos> You're the one with the job.<eos> And you're the one who freaked me out so much about going into a stranger's apartment.<eos> What did I say that was so bad?<eos> You told me he'd cut off my face and wear it as a party hat.
- Whoa, whoa.<eos> Look, I had a full scholarship to Dade U, right?<eos> I wasn't gonna let some punk kid ruin it 'cause he caught us getting dusted on PCP.<eos> Look, Darren, it's over, so why don't you just enjoy your newfound freedom and leave the past in the past, all right?<eos> I lost all of my chances, my opportunities.<eos> But you got another one.<eos> Victor and Rocco-- they killed that kid and then they lied to the world and then they lied to me.<eos> So you took it upon yourself?<eos> They used my javelin to take a life and send me away.<eos> So I used it to put Rocco in the ground.
Mindy, Mindy, please sit down!<eos> What's the matter, Lyle?<eos> You're not used to have woman stand up to you?<eos> Wife stands up to me all the time.<eos> And then she says: "I demand Windex!"<eos> And she got it!<eos> Ten seconds on the clock.<eos> Remember, Mindy:<eos> don't say the secret word!<eos> I will not say it.
Not everyone. A dedicated core team.<eos> This can't go wide. Keep it so far from the press it's on the other side of Jupiter.<eos> This only exists in this room.<eos> It's already outside it.<eos> If there are hacks sniffing around, shut them down, bright, red, D Notice.<eos> Super fucking Godzilla injunction with ten-inch Whitehall fangs!<eos> This video came from YouTube.<eos> What?<eos> It was uploaded via an encrypted IP an hour ago.<eos> Well, get it off there!
And then they set me up to look like I was a murderer.<eos> Well, they're desperate.<eos> You're very close to bringing 'em down.<eos> Yeah, but not close enough.<eos> I still can't figure out how the drugs are getting to the syndicate.<eos> You know, I've looked into all the clever ways criminals are smuggling drugs these days-- inside children's toys, seafood shipments,<eos> - plastics.<eos> - What about glass?<eos> I suppose that could work, yeah.<eos> You could embed the cocaine in the glass, and then melt it, separate it at a later time.
- Absolutely.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> It's the move, babe.<eos> I mean, all the homicide detectives back home have the nicest pads.<eos> - I'm telling you.<eos> - Huh.<eos> Let me just go on record by saying I think it's wrong to disturb someone's final resting place.<eos> Okay.<eos> Noted on record.<eos> Now crack it open.
Annie, I need you to wrap things up in there.<eos> Okay, just a second.<eos> I'm almost finished.<eos> We lost our visual on Gorka.<eos> I found it--<eos> Hi.<eos> Annie, right?<eos> Right.<eos> What are you doing here, Annie?<eos> I forgot my ring, but I found it.
Really?<eos> You missed the signing.<eos> Well, I daresay Lady Hoxley will fill me in.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not here!<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I like to live dangerously.<eos> John!<eos> The ring.<eos> I want it back.
Thank you.<eos> Not here!<eos> Haven't you heard?<eos> I like to live dangerously.<eos> John!<eos> The ring.<eos> I want it back.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, I mean...<eos> I want it back.
Haven't you heard?<eos> I like to live dangerously.<eos> John!<eos> The ring.<eos> I want it back.<eos> Of course.<eos> No, I mean...<eos> I want it back.<eos> What about the...<eos> Well, you can't remember the past, so... maybe I should forget it as well.
It's not what I wanted my life to be about.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Well, sit down.<eos> Sit down, Ian.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Laura will want to know about this later.<eos> And so will you.<eos> Go on, Detective.<eos> Well, if, when we can locate the weapon we can connect it to an individual...
If you cannot afford one, one will be appointed to you by the state.<eos> Do you understand these rights, Emily?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is all a big misunderstanding.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I understand perfectly.<eos> You came back here to recover a murder weapon.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> All right, then.<eos> You...tossed it for someone else.
Different name, Irene.<eos> Different haircut.<eos> Different color.<eos> But that's Lena.<eos> I'd know here anywhere.<eos> She's alive.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> We don't know when this photo was taken.<eos> It was taken after she was kidnapped.<eos> That necklace, I gave it to Lena at our engagement party.
What's up with the canine?<eos> What's up with the canine?<eos> It is a victim's dog that we need to take to an animal shelter.<eos> Yes, we are, but the investigation that we're currently working on keeps interfering.<eos> I told you already, I'm gonna deal with it when I get a chance. Thank you.<eos> Looks hungry, brah.<eos> If you're gonna keep a pet, you got to feed him.<eos> Ah, see, no, it's not a pet, and we're not keeping him.<eos> We-we are not keeping him?<eos> So you don't need to feed it.
You don't know what it took for Jack to put himself out there for you.<eos> You let him think he had a shot,<eos> Conrad.<eos> Amanda Clarke.<eos> Some guy named Frank figured out we switched names.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I took care of him.<eos> There's an old saying about those who cannot remember the past being condemned to repeat it.<eos> But those of us who refuse to forget the past are condemned to relive it.
The robe was not exactly... silk. - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - It was more...?<eos> - I will not say what it was. - No, no, no.<eos> - In the English style, like a lord, or...?<eos> Please, enough, I am ashamed.<eos> At least we're laughing about it.<eos> Now we will find out why they tortured and killed those people.<eos> Can you imagine if it was for gold bars? Why do you need the gold?<eos> To whom do you want to sell it to, to the mermaids?
Why is that?<eos> He worked on a cable ship... laying underwater electric cable across the Pacific.<eos> He'd be gone a month, home a week.<eos> We tried to make it work the best we could.<eos> But then, uh...<eos> What?<eos> Did something happen?<eos> About a week ago, he... called me, left me this strange message.<eos> Do you still have the message?<eos> Can we hear it?
Leave me alone!<eos> Watch yourself...<eos> Elyan?<eos> Elyan?<eos> Elyan?<eos> Why doesn't he speak?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's strange.<eos> It's like he lost his mind.<eos> When I want your medical opinion Gwaine, I'll ask for it.
I'm a mentor.<eos> Big deal, you taught me to read one book.<eos> No, Bart, you can read other books, too.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Homie, what are you doing?<eos> My work is so meaningless.<eos> You make electricity.<eos> It runs the hospital.<eos> You can't touch electricity, Marge, you can't feel it.
It's as if the laughing man wants to stare at my naked body.<eos> Naughty ghost.<eos> Oh!<eos> OK, Joan.<eos> We'll say some prayers to banish the ghost and send him to a happier place.<eos> Is it an exorcism?<eos> It is.<eos> Sort of.<eos> It's a blessing to drive away unhappy spirits.<eos> Visit, we beseech thee, O Lord, this place, and drive far from it all the snares of the enemy.
Go easy on the stuffing.<eos> I couldn't sleep a wink last year.<eos> That's funny, I remember you snoring on the couch like a mule.<eos> Don't be a wisenheimer.<eos> Who, me?<eos> Yeah, you.<eos> Here, give me a hand getting down the turkey platter.<eos> Oh, Henry, not the platter.<eos> I'll have you know, this platter was a gift to this family from Eleanor Roosevelt.<eos> No, allegedly, it was a gift from Eleanor Roosevelt to the family in Yonkers whose yard sale you bought it at.
We're done here.<eos> Is my client free to leave?<eos> No, we have some facts to check, counselor.<eos> Why don't you, uh, cool your heels for a while?<eos> Thank you, George.<eos> Good work.<eos> That hump needs to be in LaGuardia's criminal wing.<eos> Sick bastard really believes they're in love.<eos> You think Gia actually wrote this letter?<eos> He wouldn't have put it on the table if it wasn't real.
Hey.<eos> Thought you could use a snack.<eos> Now is grandma dead?<eos> She's fine, but speaking of grandma, well, you know, that reminds me of a funny story.<eos> When I was little, your grandma and I decided it would be fun to get matching mother-daughter dresses, so we went shopping all over town looking for the right ones, and finally, we found the perfect dress, but they only had one, and it fit grandma, but it didn't fit me.<eos> Ohh.<eos> Anyway, grandma got the dress, and I was so happy.<eos> She bought the dress?<eos> Well, yeah, but she looked so beautiful in it.<eos> She wore it in front of you?
I stopped counting when I got out seven months ago.<eos> There's a family missing, Oscar.<eos> So what?<eos> So, their disappearance is tied to some buried cocaine, which I believe belongs to you.<eos> Now, here's what it is.<eos> I had a corner cell, one window high on a wall.<eos> It was under an overhang, so the sun never made it through.<eos> Is this going somewhere, or should I brew some tea?<eos> I spent all my time inside waiting on that sun.<eos> I feel it now, on my face, every day.
Promise.<eos> Promise.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> Surprise!<eos> Vilma, meet Manolito.<eos> Manolito, she is Vilma, but you can call her mom.<eos> But look at that little thing!<eos> - Hello, darling...<eos> - Be careful, he bites!<eos> - Where'd you get it?
Good to me.<eos> Me, too.<eos> So, you saw the alert from the ground commander warning that there were civilians in the vicinity.<eos> - Yes, sir. There are sometimes delays in the transmission of such alerts.<eos> Did you experience any delays here?<eos> No, there were no delays, sir.<eos> Then why did the accused ignore the warning?<eos> Objection, it's not determined yet that Staff Sergeant Elkins ignored anything.<eos> Overruled.<eos> I don't know why Sergeant Elkins ignored it, sir.
Sal!<eos> Richard!<eos> Oh, hello. Let's get out of here.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because I'm kinda feeling richard.<eos> Max, I was just in the ladies' room.<eos> And I had a thought.<eos> Why am I doing my lipstick in a mirror that says "die carlos""<eos> I know how to get the full value of the ring.<eos> We just have to take it to the store where they sell it,
- Hate you!<eos> So jealous!<eos> - Thanks!<eos> - Bye!<eos> Seeing you in your natural habitat is truly disturbing. Hi!<eos> Can I help you?<eos> Hi!<eos> I'd like to return a ring I got as a present here.<eos> Tat rings are so amazing.<eos> I can't believe you want to return it.
But I know there's some shady stuff going on down there.<eos> Scamming tourists, stuff like that.<eos> Hey, this whole thing's a scam.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The photo Bridgett sent of Sean?<eos> She used a photo from the Web site to make it.<eos> It's a fake.<eos> Let's see what you got.<eos> Questioned Documents confirmed it's the same photo.<eos> So somebody manipulated it and grafted it onto a tourist shop from the luau-- Chin's working on who sent it.
You're fine.<eos> Let's just go over and check it out.<eos> It's not over till it's over.<eos> Can you tell me if you see him here?<eos> That's him.<eos> That's the little... right there.<eos> You're positive?<eos> Normally, when a straight guy like that wanders in here by accident, he looks around, sees what he's gotten himself into, and then he slinks out the door.<eos> But this guy, he was looking around forever, eyeballing everyone, and then... bam...<eos> Pulls out the gun and puts it in my face.
Squad.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> That's like 40 blocks.<eos> And Duffy just went in and was like, "mmm," opened his mouth and there...<eos> Oh! Hey, what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, you know, I was just...<eos> Hey, guys, how you doing?<eos> I was just telling them about you holding the perp's nose closed to make him open his mouth.<eos> Stop, it was your case.<eos> You closed it.
Clearly you still don't understand what happened two years ago, and there's no point rehashing the past.<eos> You're right, it was a mistake calling you.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Got a homicide in Central Park-- female, mid-20s, apparent victim of assault.<eos> Who called it in?<eos> Couple from Iowa, in town to see Spider-Man on Broadway, after a walk in the park.<eos> Odds were pretty good they were going to see a dead body either way.<eos> She was putting on a pretty good show herself.<eos> I aged the cut under her eye from the rape.<eos> She might have done it to herself.
Do you have any free time?<eos> Get ahold of me here.<eos> Laura, today.<eos> Hey, Nicky, what's up?<eos> Well, I got good news, and I got bad news.<eos> The good news is, I think I found our gun. Great.<eos> And the bad news?<eos> 16-year-old kid comes in to rob the place.<eos> And the clerk must have sneezed, and the kid's weapon spits out about 50 of your magic rounds.<eos> Shooter said he found it behind a Dumpster at D Street and Barlow. Anybody else hurt?
Anything missing?<eos> Her ring.<eos> Ring?<eos> What kind of ring?<eos> Eternity band.<eos> E.R. said it wasn't on her.<eos> Four karats.<eos> It had been in our family almost a hundred years.<eos> And you're sure she would have been wearing it?<eos> Since... since my dad died, she never took it off.

I would so much rather hear your version of what happened, but you have to tell me what it is.<eos> It was the ring.<eos> Okay.<eos> I was the one that got the ring off her hand while she was whaling on me.<eos> She got some good shots in for an old lady.<eos> She hit Andre too, but he...<eos> He started hitting her back.<eos> I was saying it's too much, he was doing it too hard.<eos> He asked me for the ring.<eos> When I didn't give it to him, he quit beating on her and started hitting on me.

This way.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Your waiter will be with you in a moment.<eos> Would you care to see the wine list while you wait, Mr. Gordon?<eos> No need.<eos> Can you bring us a bottle of the Terrabianca Campaccio?<eos> The 2001.<eos> If that wine is okay with you?<eos> Big words. Not this year.<eos> Let's drink it.
Stuart, don't give me that "who are you trying to convince" look.<eos> See, this is why we never talk.<eos> 'Cause you don't know when to shut up!<eos> I can't sit on this couch one more minute.<eos> I'm going to my bedroom and sit down.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How do you like my... my new dress?<eos> I bought it for my date with Robbie tonight.
The trophy, the outfits and of course, the Sacko steak brands.<eos> Steak brands?<eos> Oh, you didn't hear about Sacko steak night?<eos> No. Pete would come over to my house once a week.<eos> I'd have to make him steak.<eos> Filet. And then I'd have to brand it with the Shiva.<eos> And then brand my steak-- a lesser grade of course-- with the Sacko.<eos> Of course, you are what you you eat.<eos> Well, you'll be eating a lot of Sacko meat next year, my friend.<eos> I don't want that shit. Get it away from me.
So you and SCIU?<eos> Kaput.<eos> Damn.<eos> Precisely.<eos> I used to have a lab.<eos> Much better than this, of course.<eos> So where's all your stuff?<eos> If by "stuff" you mean my life's work, my genius made manifest, my exquisite symphony of scientific innovation--<eos> Yes, that stuff--<eos> The bastards stole it.
You're very angry right now.<eos> And any act committed in anger always results in regret, mother.<eos> I request you that you take back the shiva linga.<eos> I've full faith that when your anger subsides then you'll not even think of committing this sin.<eos> Dakshayani cannot break her resolve.<eos> Move aside.<eos> - No, mother!<eos> Do as you wish you can kill me if you wish but this devotee of the lord can't bear to see the immersion of the shiva linga.<eos> I cannot see it, mother.<eos> Mother... i request you please give it to me.

!<eos> What happened to your knowledge of medicine?<eos> During aditi's wedding i didn't make you the master of medicine so that during times of distress you stand in silence!<eos> At any cost i need a medicine to remove this mark.<eos> As you command, prajapati.<eos> I'll surely try.<eos> You'll have to be erased today.<eos> No mark of shiva has any place on my body.<eos> It's your imagination, sati.<eos> Remove it from your mind.
I'll be on my way.<eos> Enjoy yourselves.<eos> Feyris-chan's dad has this doesn't he?<eos> Indeed!<eos> You can tell he's Feyris-tan's dad.<eos> Um... Do you know anything about an IBN 5100?<eos> I haven't heard that name in ages.<eos> I'm looking for one.<eos> I parted with mine a long time ago.<eos> Did you give it to Yanabayashi Shrine?
Your orders have been carried out.<eos> I no longer have a single Black worker!<eos> I'm ruined!<eos> Those were the orders, you know that.<eos> Enrol all the Blacks and Creoles of French nationality.<eos> The minister was quite clear.<eos> The minister?<eos> What bloody minister?<eos> You shouldn't have given them nationality.<eos> I didn't give it to them.
Who are you to hit him?<eos> Just talk to him.<eos> Go home!<eos> Go now!<eos> You, who told you to meddle with human matters?<eos> Sunbae, let her go first!<eos> I need to protect my image as a Scheduler.<eos> Human affairs. We cannot directly intervene.<eos> A Scheduler's first rule.<eos> How dare you go against it!
Sir.<eos> He said he wants to meet you.<eos> Did your wife's surgery go well?<eos> Who called the ambulance for my wife?<eos> These two.<eos> Has your wife recovered?<eos> I took her to the hospital.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> Do you know how much my wife's diamond ring costs?<eos> Find it in the next 24 hours.
I have two years left.<eos> My youth is passing by as my savings go up.<eos> Letter of Resignation<eos> It's Bae Sung Hyun's letter of resignation.<eos> It really is his letter of resignation.<eos> So ridiculous.<eos> We save his wife's life, and he asks us to find him a treasure.<eos> We found the ring.<eos> It was in the swimming pool locker room.<eos> The pool sent it to the front desk, and then they called the casino.

We expected that the defendant would make this argument.<eos> Here is further evidence.<eos> This is a statement the plaintiff's husband Kang Do Kyung wrote admitting to his adultery.<eos> Hey!<eos> Why did you lie?<eos> I told you that I slept with him.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I admit if I do something.<eos> I take responsibility for my actions.<eos> I'll get the punishment if I deserve it.
I stole your bed.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm going to write.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> You did me the best favor I ever had.<eos> There is no dream, Chenault.<eos> Just a piss puddle of greed, spreading throughout the world.<eos> I want to make a promise to you, the reader.<eos> And I don't know if I can fulfill it tomorrow or even the day after that.
He's taking too many hits.<eos> Get your hands up!<eos> Get out of that corner!<eos> Move!<eos> Come on, Charlie.<eos> He's getting killed in there!<eos> Tell him what to do!<eos> That guy's got two heads, and about a foot of reach on us, and no blind spot.<eos> He's got to have a weakness.<eos> Find it!
And who's this Raduev of yours?<eos> Some kind of professor of theology?<eos> He reads magazines even I've never heard of.<eos> But there has to be some development of the plot, some logic...<eos> I don't want logic, I want dirt.<eos> And this isn't dirt, it's just plain shit.<eos> Understand?<eos> But in general, there is a certain healthy core to it.<eos> The first plus is that it makes you hate television.<eos> You want to watch it and hate it...
- Christ. - Ralph, get in here.<eos> - What is it?<eos> What is it?<eos> - Is he dead?<eos> - Yes, he's dead. Motherfucker.<eos> I knew this was gonna happen. Get all this shit rounded up and get it out of here as fast as you can.<eos> Try and pick him up.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Go check it out.<eos> Take it off the wall.
No.<eos> So, when do you think Daisy will be home?<eos> - Gerry?<eos> - Ally?<eos> - My God, what are you doing here?<eos> - Hi. You know, I'm just babysitting for a friend.<eos> Cool.<eos> So, you saw the magical show.<eos> Yeah!<eos> The kids, they just love it.
We are wasting valuable time here.<eos> /No, no.<eos> /I have never been on the other side /of a source code mission. /<eos> - I wouldn't be a viable candidate. - Why not?<eos> CAOC-N.<eos> What is that?<eos> Because the specifications are extremely narrow.<eos> What are they?<eos> /Captain, you should have found a suspect /by now.<eos> /This tactical advantage, /this tremendous tool that we've given you, don't squander it thinking.
Where?<eos> Over there!<eos> - No!<eos> - Oh, I'm scared!<eos> Oh, dear! No!<eos> No! Don't shoot!<eos> You'll hit my angel!<eos> Commissioner.<eos> The antidote!<eos> Throw it!
The scroll from the Unicorn.<eos> A piece of paper, like this.<eos> You mean the poem.<eos> Yes.<eos> The poem written in Old English.<eos> Yes.<eos> It was inside a cylinder.<eos> Yes.<eos> Concealed in the mast. Yes.<eos> I don't have it.
Apparently not.<eos> Even fate picks its favourites.<eos> No big deal.<eos> A much different fate awaited me.<eos> A baby!<eos> How thoughtful.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Yes, I saw it and thought of you.<eos> Luckily I found a lovely little place to call home.<eos> Can we keep it?
Are you OK?<eos> I did my best, but he's too fantastic.<eos> Here.<eos> Let me carry that heavy gun for you.<eos> I got us covered.<eos> - Let go.<eos> It's mine!<eos> - Bernard, run!<eos> Roxanne?<eos> - You're going to break it!
They can kill you in minutes.<eos> To the untrained eye, they look similar to these, which are delicious.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Tarak.<eos> It's Assyrian, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But it's not my real name.<eos> It was given to me.<eos> - What's your real name?<eos> - I doubt you could pronounce it.
Taste. You'll see.<eos> What?<eos> It's corky.<eos> Corked!<eos> Don't get upset.<eos> We'll change it.<eos> We'll ask the waiter... No big deal. Yeah I've already tried to change it.<eos> He wouldn't listen to me, and now he's ignoring me completely. So, what's this ridiculous ritual for anyway?<eos> Why do they bother to ask us to taste the wine?<eos> It's a convention. You taste it and you say it's good.
It used to let us know that Flynn was here.<eos> It became the symbol of something bigger, something better than this world.<eos> I've never been this close before.<eos> It's how I imagine a sunrise to be.<eos> Ah, trust me. There's no comparison.<eos> What's it like?<eos> - The sun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Man...<eos> I've never had to describe it before.
I think you have the right to say yes I do trust I trust myself.<eos> What?<eos> Shit!<eos> -What what?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> -Im sorry.<eos> Somehow she didn't want to confess to him that she was so weary of all those people who'd seem to want to care about her.<eos> He touched her cheek gently, caressingly.<eos> Her heart was bitting so loudly that surely he could hear it.
Jia moved them while inspecting the tubular pillar.<eos> I think during his inspection, Jia must have found something.<eos> The clue may be in Jia's inspection report.<eos> We have to find this report.<eos> I'll go to Jia's residence tonight.<eos> Pei of Supreme Court welcomes the Prince!<eos> Detective Dee, receive the mace...<eos> The late Emperor gave you this weapon.<eos> It was confiscated when you were in jail.<eos> After I got hold of it, I've kept it for you!
They're just having fun.<eos> Take me back to the apartment.<eos> Well, I can't.<eos> I'm supposed to babysit you.<eos> I can babysit myself, thank you very much.<eos> You can't babysit yourself. You know what?<eos> You should go back inside.<eos> You should go have some more fun.<eos> Sam, give me your fucking coat. I'm freezing.<eos> Just give it to me, please.
It's a little fast for me.<eos> How about we hang first?<eos> No.<eos> It's not real.<eos> It's real.<eos> I'm real.<eos> Now, how's this for a wet dream?<eos> Quentin, wake me up.<eos> This dress was always one of my favorites.<eos> Do you remember it, Nancy?
Okay.<eos> No, I'll call back.<eos> Okay, now let's go back and take a look at Alfie Shepridge.<eos> Since his divorce,<eos> Alfie Shepridge did not exactly find himself leading the thirtysomething life he envisioned in his new digs.<eos> Friends fixed him up with one or two women they thought might be appropriate.<eos> Always that word...<eos> But it was not what he had in mind.<eos> I'm sorry about the stick, but I've just had my hip replaced.<eos> At first, I thought I fell down and broke it.
I go out on a limb for you, and this is how you pay me back?<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, don't bullshit me.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> What ring?<eos> Judge Pierce just called.<eos> His wife's diamond ring is gone.<eos> So, give it back.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, don't bullshit me.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> What ring?<eos> Judge Pierce just called.<eos> His wife's diamond ring is gone.<eos> So, give it back.<eos> I didn't take it.
Where's the ring?<eos> What ring?<eos> Judge Pierce just called.<eos> His wife's diamond ring is gone.<eos> So, give it back.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> Oh, brilliant.<eos> Just brilliant.<eos> Believe me, this had nothing to do with me.<eos> All right, just get it back, Tommy, tonight, or the judge will call the police.
It's Tommy.<eos> Hey, Tommy, we've been waiting for your phone call.<eos> Listen, remember that big thing that we said we was gonna do for you?<eos> We?<eos> That was my - All right.<eos> That Edgar said he was gonna do for you?<eos> - Well, it's all done, man.<eos> - Just tell me where that ring is.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> So you haven't got it yet?
Hey, you bitch ."<eos> I said, "Don't talk to my wife like that."<eos> And he said, uh, "Come on, I'm a soul brother."<eos> Then he pulled his knife on me.<eos> After he went down, what happened?<eos> I hit him with my fists, took the knife away from him, then stood up.<eos> The rifle that shot him.<eos> Were you holding the rifle?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Did you see who was holding it?
Larry-- did you recognize the other men?<eos> My father was there.<eos> I recognized his voice when he said,<eos> "I'm gonna call an ambulance and the police."<eos> And what about the other man?<eos> I didn't know who he was.<eos> (anchorman over TV) ln a surprise move here Thursday, Larry Teel, son of a local barber, Robert Teel, took the witness stand in Granville County Superior Court and denied that he shot and killed a local Negro man.<eos> (Watkins) Were you holding the rifle?<eos> (Larry) No, sir.<eos> (Watkins) Did you see who was holding it?
Did you buy a new dress for our date tonight?<eos> - Don't flatter yourself.<eos> - I'll take that as a "yes".<eos> - I guess you'll never know.<eos> - I guess not.<eos> - Except you left the price tag on.<eos> - What?<eos> Allow me.<eos> I got it.<eos> You know, I've had this dress for a long time. It's just I haven't worn it yet, so... that's why the tag was still on.
Tonight she understood right away.<eos> - Yeah, that banging sound...<eos> I understand Alex was scared, that he fell and hit his head.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> Well, come in.<eos> I'm packing my things.<eos> It's all over now.<eos> It is!<eos> Yeah, we could try to find other premises but where?<eos> And how long would we have to look for it, like six months...

You're practically the Devil.<eos> Guys, this is scie tifically possible.<eos> Prof Hawkins, tell me how to vote in your robot.<eos> I write Stargate fan fiction.<eos> So I know what I'm talking about.<eos> I almost fainted.<eos> You're such a hen.<eos> The tub is an energy vortex. Like 's black hole.<eos> Instead of space ... in a hot tub.<eos> The time is linear, we experienced it just like that.
I could easily aim at your head and blow your balls off.<eos> -You tried to drown me.<eos> I'm an ordinary, kind, peaceful person...<eos> Just calm down.<eos> -Take a deep breath.<eos> -I am calm!<eos> That was an accident!<eos> You frightened me!<eos> Try and find your ear.<eos> Put it on some ice, and the hospital can stitch it back on.
It feels so good to be alive and an assistant dean!<eos> ♪ I swear I never felt so alive... ♪<eos> Sunshine!<eos> Oh!<eos> - Talk to me, Goose.<eos> - Goose?<eos> - It's me.<eos> I've got the video up.<eos> - Bitchin'.<eos> So I'm just gonna burn a copy and bring it up to Dr. Gordon's office, then.
Nate, are you okay?<eos> You guys rock!<eos> And that's how we do things here at Camp Star!<eos> Wow.<eos> Uh, before we go any further,<eos> I'd like to make a quick announcement.<eos> We're having staffing problems.<eos> Who knew we'd be so popular?<eos> All right, now we're under attack.<eos> So I'd just like to put it out there.
Now, about this apple<eos> How many times have you seen an apple? .<eos> A thousand? .<eos> Ten thousand? .<eos> A million?<eos> .

Since I know you have nothing to wear... to a fancy Blakelee mansion to-do...<eos> - I wasn't gonna ask you.<eos> - Forget it.<eos> Besides, I never got a chance to get you a prom dress.<eos> - Not that you went.<eos> - No.<eos> Why do you come here so much?<eos> I spent half my childhood in this building.<eos> I loved it here. I still do.<eos> Then why do people say you burned it down?
Yeah, I fuckin heard about that.<eos> How'd you find me? - I looked under the rug.<eos> - So, you asking to get fucked up?<eos> The fuck that your entire legal name is Puss was a surprise.<eos> Then Maincoon Production popped up.. And here I am... Schrodinger's warehouse.<eos> - I ain't ever saw this bitch.<eos> - Hey, fair enough. So, listen..<eos> Herman Minkowski died 4 years ago.<eos> You bought the joint a year later.<eos> - Who sold it to you?
All right, Patterson. Prepare this gentleman for the lecture.<eos> What about his, uh... posture, sir?<eos> Uh, straighten him out. I'm sure he won't complain.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Unbend him. These fellows will assist you. And then show them out.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> All right, give me a hand with this.<eos> Here's to our new product.<eos> And where exactly are we gonna find more?<eos> Oh, there's lots more... product just waiting for us to dig it up.
uncle...<eos> uncle?<eos> Have you finished the passport for the AngoIan guy?<eos> It's too humid to work.<eos> Shit, uncle.<eos> Don't mess about, this is serious.<eos> Even the ink has a different consistency.<eos> What do you still have to do?<eos> Just swap the photo?<eos> I'II glue it.
Let's not only begun.<eos> Quileute were from the beginning were a little tribe.<eos> But we've always had magic in their blood.<eos> We were great spiritual warriors.<eos> Forms of exchange offices.<eos> We are transformed into a large wolf.<eos> So we forced our enemies and protect our tribe.<eos> One day our soldiers found the creature.<eos> He looked like a man, but he was hard as stone and cold as ice.<eos> Sharp Teeth by raskidali warriors, but only by a fire could destroy it.
I love you, really.<eos> - Pretjeruje. - If this is all I can contribute<eos> I want to be thorough.<eos> Newborn will go mad.<eos> - If it feels uncomfortable.<eos> - I do not mind anymore.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since I spent 24 hours misleæi you were dead.<eos> - Why do not you wear your ring?<eos> - I do not want to lose it.
Yeah, I'll give you all usernames and passwords after this meeting.<eos> I'm not sure I want to be a puffin.<eos> You don't have to be if you don't want to, Barry.<eos> - Bagsy a blue one, yeah?<eos> - Good, Waj.<eos> Now, I've spoken to him.<eos> My puffin has communicated with his puffing.<eos> And he's told us to make some bombs.<eos> So we're going to take Faisal's gear to the secret flat.<eos> We can hide it under the costumes in Hassan's van.
What kind of fragments?<eos> Nothing important ... lf you don't mind, I will decide what is important and what isn't.<eos> I don't remember her face at all.<eos> Only her hands.<eos> Great big hands, carrying a strawberry cake with four candles on it... or unwrapping a razor-blade...<eos> -Go on.<eos> -With what?<eos> -Tell me about the razor-blade.<eos> -She...<eos> She used to put it in the razor and then shave her legs.
Shit!<eos> Shit.<eos> Damn!<eos> Hello, excuse me, I've lost my coat.<eos> Where's lost and found please?<eos> First corridor on the left.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> is it gone?<eos> I went to lost and found.<eos> Someone took it.
Shit.<eos> Damn!<eos> Hello, excuse me, I've lost my coat.<eos> Where's lost and found please?<eos> First corridor on the left.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> is it gone?<eos> I went to lost and found.<eos> Someone took it.<eos> Perhaps you'll get it back.
I could leave my own coat here, if you like.<eos> Juliette.<eos> Vincent.<eos> It's somehow humiliating to lose your coat.<eos> You didn't watch out, that's all.<eos> Yes, but I need it.<eos> Would you prefer to have had your mobile stolen?<eos> No, but I could understand that better.<eos> How can anyone steal a coat?<eos> It's obvious that someone will come and look for it.
It's Brahms.<eos> Piano Concerto No. 2.<eos> We're playing it in the orchestra.<eos> My favorite cello solo is in there.<eos> In the cigarette?<eos> In the third movement.<eos> Do you play that solo?<eos> I'd like to.<eos> But?<eos> My flatmate plays it.
I will pay $225 and keep the gray horse.<eos> - I don't want the ponies.<eos> - I cannot accept that.<eos> There will be no settlement after I leave this office. It will go to law.<eos> All right, this is my last offer.<eos> $250.<eos> For that I get the release previously discussed and I keep your father's saddle.<eos> The gray horse is not yours to sell.<eos> The saddle is not for sale.<eos> I will keep it.
I thought that I could get through this. I did.<eos> But I can't, and he can't, either.<eos> - He doesn't want this, either.<eos> - You remember sophomore year?<eos> The Lit Christmas party when you wore my dress?<eos> The red one I bought especially for the event?<eos> You took that, too, without asking.<eos> And then when I went to get ready for the event, - my dress was missing.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I picked that dress out. When we were on Chapel Street, we saw it in the window of Nelly's, and you remember I picked it out and then you went back and you bought it. I was the editor of Lit.
I proposed in the tree house, actually.<eos> - Our tree house?<eos> - It's my wedding gift to Joanna.<eos> I'm having it moved from Mom and Dad's to our new place,<eos> - once it's finally built.<eos> - You're moving the tree...?<eos> You can't move the tree house, Will.<eos> You and I built that with Dad with our bare hands.<eos> - That's like Olsen family history.<eos> - OK, Marni, how about when you come in town, you can come visit it at our place.
Show me proof!<eos> Here.<eos> What's that?<eos> "You never intended to vote red.<eos> That was your mistake."<eos> "l entered first and left a message on the lead red apple."<eos> Message?<eos> Yeah.<eos> "l asked everyone to leave their branders under the box."<eos> "Anyone planning to vote red would've seen it."
With the sea and clouds of Earth reflecting on its door... the great silver bird was released to soar in orbit 320 miles above us.<eos> Soon it would be sending images back to us.<eos> Could we finally unlock the secrets of the universe?<eos> Would we discover other worlds like ours?<eos> The whole world waited for Hubble to open its enormous eye.<eos> Engineers have discovered that the giant telescope has a warped mirror.<eos> One of the mirrors in the Hubble Space Telescope is out of shape, and as a result... the pictures it's sending back are no better than those from the ground.<eos> You've got a go to open the doors. Okay, swinging.<eos> It would be three long years before astronauts could return... with a remedy for the ailing Hubble.<eos> I'm not even pulling it, I'm just coaxing it with my fingertips.
Doesn't that acronym spell "mole"?<eos> Molly's hotter.<eos> Dude, it's a weapon, not a woman.<eos> Hey, clearly you and I have not dated the same girls.<eos> Okay, look, are you going to do this thing, because... okay, fine.<eos> Yes. Fine. You're going to have to take over for me, okay?<eos> Molly needs to be charged and assembled before the seams on the pulse magazine degrade.<eos> Whoa, you just made that up, right?<eos> That means nothing to me.<eos> All you got to do is open the stock, remove the power core and charge it, then you re-insert the power core back into the stock, you seal the magazine, vent the shaft, secure the laser sight, and presto.
It's all right, Henry.<eos> All right, hang on.<eos> Uh, ouch. Nice.<eos> Sarin gas nerve agent.<eos> We've got about 90 seconds.<eos> It'll release the compound into the vents.<eos> It won't end here.<eos> It will grow, consuming whatever it can and never stop killing.<eos> Henry, we need more time.<eos> We don't have it.
What?<eos> What's scaring you?<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Come in.<eos> We're done.<eos> Puffy eyes.<eos> Get any sleep?<eos> A bit.<eos> Our proposal.<eos> I finished it last night.
It wasn't me.<eos> Why would I do a thing like that?<eos> You alone have a motive.<eos> A powerful motive.<eos> Revenge.<eos> I've seen how far humiliation drives people.<eos> I never wrote that email!<eos> Why would I do something so horrible if I'd written that?<eos> I'd have been nuts.<eos> Christine sent it to herself, from my computer.
There are major discrepancies between her statement and the forensic evidence.<eos> All I'm asking her to do is to set the record straight.<eos> I feel it would be prudent to restrict surveillance access to this interview.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I would also like a video record of it in the event of legal proceedings.<eos> Can I ask you to provide that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Right this way, please.<eos> This is a transcript of your statement.<eos> You should review it before you sign it.
That was just...<eos> That was just something I...<eos> I love you too.<eos> Just ignore it.<eos> Could it be a client?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Hello.<eos> I really want you to see my dress.<eos> Babe, it's really not a good time.<eos> You've got to see it, it's amazing.
Yes, it is.<eos> And that's why they want it, Because a little bit of this very same light Is inside of every man.<eos> But they always want more.<eos> Can they take it?<eos> No, but they would try.<eos> And if they tried, they could put it out.<eos> And if the light goes out here...<eos> It goes out everywhere.<eos> And so I've protected this place,<eos> But I can't protect it forever.
Do with it?<eos> You don't have any idea wh--<eos> I have no idea because you wouldn't tell me, mother.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a wheel.<eos> We're going to make an opening...<eos> One much bigger than this one.<eos> And then I'm going to attach that wheel To a system we're building--<eos> A system that channels the water and the light.<eos> And then I'm going to turn it.
Well, to be honest, doc, I'm kinda wondering what the hell just happened up here.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> So you're the new Jacob, huh?<eos> Feel any different?<eos> Not really.<eos> Well, doc, how about you come down off the mountaintop and tell us what the hell the burning bush had to say for itself?<eos> Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp.<eos> Just past it, well, he said I'd find the place that we need to protect.<eos> This place... what is it?<eos> He called it the heart of the island.
Jacob told me that we have to go to the bamboo forest out past our old camp.<eos> Just past it, well, he said I'd find the place that we need to protect.<eos> This place... what is it?<eos> He called it the heart of the island.<eos> All he said was that it's... it's a light.<eos> And that Locke smoke thing wants to put it out?<eos> Something like that, yeah.<eos> So what if he does?<eos> Then that's it for all of us.<eos> But... but if Locke wants to put it out, then why hasn't he?
Have they found him yet?<eos> No, I-I called a couple hours ago, and they think the coffin was checked through Berlin.<eos> How do you lose a body?<eos> I don't know, mom, but there's nothing we can do<eos> - except for wait for more information.<eos> - I don't want to wait, Jack.<eos> How am I supposed to get anything done?<eos> I can't even find his will.<eos> Papers everywhere.<eos> Look, mom, I'll come over in a couple hours, and we'll find it together.
I came back here because I was broken.<eos> And I was stupid enough to think this place would fix me.<eos> Dude, I'm sorry.<eos> How much further we got, Hurley?<eos> It's not far.<eos> It's not far at all.<eos> It's right there.<eos> It's a lighthouse.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> How is it that we've never seen it before?

How fares the legatus?<eos> In a mood.<eos> Since his return from thrace,<eos> The senate has become his mistress.<eos> Her demands on him are boundless.<eos> Men and their ambitions.<eos> You know they should learn to appreciate<eos> The finer things in life.<eos> That necklace.<eos> I adore it.
The aphrodisiac presence of my beautiful wife!<eos> Now marvel at the announcing of tomorrow's primus!<eos> Crixus, the champion of capua,<eos> Will stride across the sands and face..<eos> Spartacus!<eos> No!<eos> Let them fight!<eos> Enough!<eos> I will take your fucking heart!<eos> Come and take it, coward!
A true gladiator is taught to embrace Pain and suffering.<eos> To fight until life flees from his worthless body.<eos> Learn from this man. Or share his fate.<eos> Spartacus!<eos> Return to training.<eos> Dominus.<eos> Rhaskos, hamilcar.<eos> See him to the medicus.<eos> A fine offer, good vibius.<eos> I shall hasten to present it to my master.
So how did he find out?<eos> He wouldn't say.<eos> I thought Dr Ransome had gone ahead and told him without asking me.<eos> That's why I was angry.<eos> But...she denied it.<eos> I was so horrible to her and then she was killed.<eos> And then I realised I was wrong and she didn't tell Jez.<eos> How do you know?<eos> There was a letter from her with the appointment.<eos> I'd tucked it in a book and forgotten it, but today I noticed it somewhere else. I'd tucked it in a book and forgotten it, but today I noticed it somewhere else.

I'd tucked it in a book and forgotten it, but today I noticed it somewhere else.<eos> Jez must have found it.
Maybe he heard something.<eos> And if we have to move him on short notice,<eos> I'm a familiar face.<eos> Great.<eos> Fiona, maybe I could borrow your car?<eos> The charger's a little stained.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I can't stay for long.<eos> I just wanted to make sure that our first strategy session Gets off on the right foot.<eos> Team building is a process, So I thought I'd help speed it up.
I guess those elevators go more than just up and down.<eos> Come on.<eos> Right there.<eos> You good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I must have hit a few buttons I wasn't supposed to press.<eos> Is the air getting thin?<eos> Life support isn't working out here.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I was the one who shut it off.
Er...<eos> Do either of you smoke?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Good.<eos> She'd kill me if I started again.<eos> Did you notice anyone acting suspiciously when you got out of the car?<eos> No.<eos> No one.<eos> And your wife was driving, yeah?<eos> No, I was, but we had this mirror, and Rachel suggested I take it in while she parked the car.
You are operating on my turf.<eos> That biker gang - They told me how to find you.<eos> You see, keith, if I ask them<eos> To drag you back to rhode island behind their harleys,<eos> They would, just so that I would owe them a favor, capiche?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, answer my questions about this little hotel bomb,<eos> Or take your chances with the bikers.<eos> I just did what the guy said.<eos> He gave me the specs, I made the device, I put it in a basement at the epic hotel.
What is this?<eos> Jimmy.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Come on, Ma.<eos> - This is it.<eos> This is the one. - It's close.<eos> It's very similar.<eos> I had the same necklace years ago from his father.<eos> I don't have a father.<eos> She sold it to keep a roof over my head.
You have assurance crixus will be punished.<eos> I fear your hands too soft for the task.<eos> You are mistaken. they are as steel,<eos> Hardened to their purpose.<eos> as i to mine.<eos> we return to rome, absent<eos> Unworthy entanglements.<eos> Do not turn from me!<eos> You forget your place, lanista!<eos> No. i secure it.
Shut up, alvie.<eos> Anything familiar...<eos> Church, grocery store?<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay, Ms. x.<eos> Maybe she's never been to this town before, bought the heart rate monitor on the store's website.<eos> You know that puerto ricans are U.S. citizens, right?<eos> Instead of working the case, why don't you contemplate the inanity of an American with American immigration issues?<eos> I had a birth certificate.<eos> I lost it.
You think she fell down the stairs and peed her pants 'cause Wilson dumped her too?<eos> You're choosing to tell me about this case, so let's look at it.<eos> First you were fixated on a harmful toxin from her past, possibly because you're worried about a harmful toxin from your own past.<eos> Chase had the toxin idea.<eos> Maybe he's obsessed with my past.<eos> And now you're talking about a seizure disorder?<eos> Which is also not a toxin.<eos> But which is most likely caused by an old injury to the brain.<eos> W-why do you see your past as such a threat?<eos> Not only am I unthreatened by it, I was trying to get it back.
I understand that's the adult thing to do.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I've known for a while.<eos> The fact that you decided to cohabitate is not exactly a spoiler.<eos> Unless my intel is wrong. Trouble in paradise?<eos> We have to get to Trenton.<eos> Hmm?<eos> That sound like a yes?<eos> Sir, we have to get you to the O.R.<eos> You have a bad wound, but we're gonna pack it and transport you as fast as we can. Skull fracture.
Yeah, yeah. Whatever.<eos> Now, you know this is not necessary.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Look, janet, we need to talk.<eos> Put your hands up to the bars if you want me to take off the cuffs.<eos> Janet... you didn't even ask me for my side of the story.<eos> Do you want the cuffs off or not?<eos> Look, i can explain what happened.<eos> You better work hard on that explanation.<eos> Some day i might want to hear it.
I'm so sorry, Leo.<eos> Sure.<eos> I know.<eos> Silas Burbage or Dan Malko?<eos> Well, it's a theory.<eos> Burbage wants to sell the land.<eos> Malko wants to buy it.<eos> Jack Fincher was the stumbling block.<eos> There's a local man, Jude Langham.<eos> He seems to know all about the swamp and who owns it.
And Sam Tyler strange was very bloody strange indeed.<eos> He was happy here, everybody said so.<eos> He had a girlfriend, Annie, he had you.<eos> I asked him what was wrong, he wouldn't tell me.<eos> Said he couldn't tell me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> He said he wanted to leave.<eos> He only asked me to help him fake his own death.<eos> That's why we set fire to the car and pushed it in the river.<eos> So Sam asked you to commit an illegal act and you just did it?
Maybe she knows.<eos> MUSIC: "In The Air Tonight" by Phil Collins<eos> # I can feel it<eos> # Coming in the air tonight<eos> # Oh, Lord<eos> # And I've been waiting for this moment<eos> # For all my life<eos> # Oh, Lord. #<eos> DISTORTED: 'Police believe the body...may be that of a police officer.'<eos> Someone must have found it, pinned it on.
- Someone chinked the armour?<eos> - Okay, do you always tell me the truth?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Is there really such a thing as multiple orgasms?<eos> Yes ...<eos> Fuck!<eos> I need you guys to hold him down.<eos> I have to get this up inside him<eos> - You bastard! - Bastard<eos> Your soap I'm gonna stick it up your arse And you!
Strange thatwe've never had coffee together, right?<eos> Though we've been neighbors all summer.<eos> It's so fucking typical Swedish.<eos> People don't say hallo and don't talk to each other.<eos> You've got sugar there.<eos> So.. yes.<eos> Martin, isn't it time for you to go home soon?<eos> -How did you know my name?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I've heard it all this summer:
How do you say 'very beautiful'?<eos> Very good.<eos> - They're awesome.<eos> - I wish I was a manga warrior.<eos> - They have a samurai sword.<eos> - Ole, don't touch.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That's okay.<eos> The bonsai tree is only 150 years old.<eos> - I was going to prune it anyway.
I'm sorry,<eos> I should have given you what you needed, been close to you, but that's how I am.<eos> Now you might even have someone else.<eos> I might.<eos> - You might? - I might.<eos> In fact, I do.<eos> Remember when we went to Barcelona?<eos> We walked around with the kids visiting museums.<eos> - We were happy, weren't we? - Pietro, it's over.<eos> Anyway, the Schifano painting's mine and I'm keeping it.
Don't talk!<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Any problems?<eos> - Not even a hint.<eos> They're inside.<eos> - Kuzma?<eos> He's got the keys, it's on him now.<eos> Power is off?<eos> Just in case...<eos> - Never switched it on.

Morgan, maybe you should leave.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, my house, my party.<eos> I think you need to leave.<eos> Yeah, that's right, hottie.<eos> All right?<eos> Fun fact for you.<eos> 730 words in the Japanese language for the word "yes."<eos> No word for no.<eos> But if there was a Japanese word for no, I'd be saying it to you right now.
"Undoubtedly, you have heard of our misfortune.<eos> "But God has blessed us with a rough-handed angel "to help us through this crisis.<eos> "Tom Builder is his name.<eos> "And he is determined to give us a new cathedral.<eos> "There is much work to be done and workmen to be hired.<eos> "And of course, this brings up the question of money.<eos> "I don't wish to burden you as you begin your office, but perhaps, with your permission, I could approach our new king and ask his favour in this trying time."<eos> The plans for the expansion of the palace, Your Eminence.<eos> We are repairing the old buildings and the chapel, of course.

I think it's extraordinary.<eos> It's from Bishop Waleran, prior.<eos> He wants me to meet him at Shiring Castle on my way to see the king.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> I shouldn't be long, Remigius, but... until I return, as subprior, you're in charge.<eos> Safe journeys.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> Jack!<eos> Jack!<eos> I hung it around my neck, and you stole it at night!
Nonsense.<eos> God is on our side.<eos> Not according to that priest.<eos> Well, you're to pay him no mind.<eos> His motives are entirely selfish.<eos> Now tell me...<eos> Whom do you hate the most?<eos> Prior Philip.<eos> And what would you do to him?<eos> Cut out his heart... - Mm-hmm. ...and roast it on a spit and eat it.
Yes, My Lord, I'm very frightened.<eos> If I am killed, will you re-license Kingsbridge market?<eos> Well, now we get to the point.<eos> Well, don't you have a license?<eos> - It's been lost. - Will you pay for a new one?<eos> Yes, unless you're willing to grant it freely for God's glory.<eos> Well, you're a proud and frugal man.<eos> Will you give me the right to take stone from the quarry?<eos> Didn't I give you that right before?<eos> Yes, but you took it away.
"Jacques Cherbourg."<eos> - Murderer!<eos> - It's the bishop!<eos> Hang the bishop!<eos> - Murderer!<eos> - Murderer!<eos> There is no proof this is anything but a forgery.<eos> He sealed it with the lost prince's ring.<eos> Another forgery, another lie.<eos> He gave me the ring for safekeeping, and I gave it to Jack.

Another forgery, another lie.<eos> He gave me the ring for safekeeping, and I gave it to Jack.<eos> And Alfred stole it!<eos> So, there is no ring.<eos> There is no ring! Pity, it might have given a glint of truth to your story.<eos> - Proceed with the execution.<eos> - No! No!<eos> - It's here!<eos> Martha.<eos> I took it from Jack years ago.
No, not the church. Nothing to see.<eos> Sinister.<eos> He's in the café. Where else?<eos> Wondering how to come back without losing face.<eos> By beating me up?<eos> Not very original.<eos> - He'll be backthen?<eos> - He'll be back.<eos> As soon as he regains his composure.<eos> He never lost it.
Walter...<eos> What kind of device are we looking for?<eos> Any number of things could transmit the pulse.<eos> A large capacitor bank.<eos> Some form of compression generator.<eos> What about a satellite dish?<eos> They have them all over town.<eos> Those are for television, dear.<eos> Given how little there is to do here,<eos> I imagine they watch a lot of it.
In your car?<eos> I can't drive home with him.<eos> I can't look at him.<eos> Walter, you can't keep doing this.<eos> Peter knows that something's upsetting you.<eos> I've written him a letter.<eos> Instead of me stammering in fits and starts, a letter is more concise.<eos> It explains everything in just the right words.<eos> Except that every time I think I'm ready to tell him,<eos> I envision his reaction when he reads it and I run the scene in my mind again and again.
Now in the past 24 hours, the primary cell tower that's been handling the signal is a tower near...<eos> Dunham.<eos> Alistair Peck is back at his residence.<eos> Six dead, including two Boston P. D. officers.<eos> We have to take him down before he jumps again.<eos> Take it.<eos> I haven't seen you look at that letter for a while.<eos> It's been almost a year since Alistair died.<eos> Today's the day I'm supposed to send it.<eos> Open it.
I am a deputy United States marshal.<eos> We don't do these things alone, either.<eos> You know I got backup listening to everything right now on a little... little microphone here in my shirt collar.<eos> They're gonna hear you die unless you let me go.<eos> They won't be the only ones.<eos> Go to you bedroom!<eos> Go on, now!<eos> Now let him go.<eos> You don't put that weapon down, shots will be fired, and I cannot predict the outcome.<eos> But you put it down, I'll see to it that no charges are filed against you.
Or wouldn't you be allowed to show the film then?<eos> In this case that wouldn't be the only reason for censorship.<eos> Nina goes to jail. Because of a movie.<eos> - These are rehearsals.<eos> First the rehearsals.<eos> Then we shoot.<eos> - Yes!<eos> By the way, who owns this place?<eos> It belongs to a friend.<eos> He's leaving it to me for a certain time.
Baze says a lot of things.<eos> Where's my ring?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Where's my engagement ring?<eos> What?<eos> It was right here, and now...<eos> Where is my ring?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> My engagement ring.<eos> I... I... I left it right here, and now it's gone.
What?<eos> It was right here, and now...<eos> Where is my ring?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> My engagement ring.<eos> I... I... I left it right here, and now it's gone.<eos> He is gonna kill me.<eos> I left it right here and...<eos> Okay, Gavin.<eos> Give it back.
Well, I used to get in trouble for everything... getting sick, crying; they'd punish me by making me drink spoonfuls of Tabasco sauce.<eos> And Lux, she, uh... she collected change from under the couch in the lobby, and after, like, a month, she saved enough to replace the Tabasco with V8.<eos> It was the nicest thing anyone's ever done for me... to this day.<eos> We were going to get emancipated and move in together.<eos> Here.<eos> That was the plan.<eos> That's my social worker, so...<eos> Uh, your engagement ring?<eos> Lux has it.<eos> I'm the one that took it.
Sorry for putting that image in your head.<eos> And I'm sorry for what I said on the radio.<eos> You know, I've had trouble committing to things my entire life.<eos> But, Lux... I'm committed to you.<eos> Okay?<eos> No matter what I said on the stupid radio.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> You deserve better than that.<eos> You know, I really like your name.<eos> Who gave it to you?
I don't know.<eos> I swear -- nothing with a prize in it.<eos> That guy was always such a jackass.<eos> I hope you set him on the right path.<eos> I threw a body stocking at him.<eos> It was very gratifying.<eos> So, uh...<eos> This job offer --<eos> Oh, come on, hart.<eos> I didn't go looking for it.
Let me guess. it's either a boomerang or a vegemite sandwich.<eos> No, no. it's...different.<eos> Look, I'm a guy.<eos> And as such, my love of sex Sometimes gets in the way of, let's say, everything.<eos> But the thing is, I really care about you --<eos> The real you.<eos> The naked inside you.<eos> Okay. still listening.<eos> I wrote you a poem.<eos> Oh, god, no. no poems. then I set it to music.
They're all in little groups, winding themselves up, talking jihad and swapping stories and, you know, trying to outdo each other... ..who's the most devout, who can break down a Kalashnikov in less than two minutes.<eos> Don't talk to them, Khalil.<eos> I don't.<eos> I don't want anything to do with them.<eos> But it's hard, you know, it's a big deal, if you're not part of a group in here.<eos> If you don't belong...<eos> That's why I went in the first place.<eos> Don't talk about that.<eos> Why I went to Pakistan.<eos> The first time... the first time I picked up a gun, I dropped it on my foot.
Good to see you.<eos> Help me move this table and get those prayer mats down.<eos> Well, I came home one day and she looked at me and she said,<eos> "Oh, I'm glad you're here.<eos> That boiler's been making an awful racket."<eos> She thought I was from British Gas.<eos> You're waiting for it, you're always on the lookout, cos they always say it's the worst thing.<eos> "Oh, she don't know me no more."<eos> But you know, the day it happened to me, Jenny, I had this strange feeling.<eos> And I chased it round and round in my head.
Are you getting a divorce?<eos> No, no.<eos> That's just a case.<eos> Who's Will Gardner?<eos> Another Google alert?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's just a misunderstanding.<eos> He's my boss.<eos> We were working on a case, and we went to a hotel to ask some questions.<eos> And now people are trying to make it into something it's not.
A loss of love?<eos> There's nothing more important than love, is there?<eos> Well, we're talking about you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It can be very hard when love goes away.<eos> It's like a... a betrayal, almost like a violent act, right?<eos> Right?<eos> I guess.<eos> Um, why don't-- why don't we go back to, um--<eos> When you give someone your heart and they throw it aside, it's natural to be angry.
Mr. Ratchett, is everything all right?<eos> Ce n'est rien.<eos> Je me suis trompe.<eos> After you had heard that, all we needed was for you to go to sleep, M. Poirot.<eos> I could tell you who we are.<eos> But all you need to know, is that the people that you killed are all in heaven, Mr. Cassetti, while you are going to hell.<eos> That baby must have been so scared when you killed her.<eos> Did you not think that we would not search the world to get justice for those good people that we loved?<eos> So the whole business of this trip...<eos> The berth bought for a "Mr. Harris" so no outsider bought it.
She was 5 years old!<eos> We were good, civilized people.<eos> And then evil got over the wall, and we looked to the law for justice.<eos> And the law let us down.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, you behave like this, and we become just savages in the street!<eos> Where juries and executioners, they elect themselves!<eos> No, it is medieval!<eos> The rule of law, it must be held high!<eos> And if it falls, you pick it up and hold it even higher!
Magoza?<eos> Yes?<eos> Magoza...<eos> Yes?<eos> Come to my room, will you?<eos> For 16 years you've looked after me.<eos> Miss Kane you're beautiful.<eos> I sewed this kimono myself.<eos> It's not very well made, but I put my whole heart into it.<eos> Will you wear it?
He can still hear you.<eos> It's Jing.<eos> It's Jing.<eos> It's Jing.<eos> It's Jing. It's Jing.<eos> You promised that whenever you hear my name, you'd come back.<eos> It's Jing. It's Jing.<eos> Look.<eos> You said I'd look good in red.<eos> I'm wearing it now.
I'd pay you, like, 10 bucks an hour.<eos> My guardian angel! I would love to!<eos> Who's going to be there?<eos> Really fun people.<eos> Ron, Tom, Mark and Ann.<eos> What's the occasion?<eos> Justin is coming into town.<eos> Hey, it's me, Justin.<eos> Take my coat. But please, be careful.<eos> I got it from the king of Africa when we were walking on the Berlin Wall together.
What about this? Is this fake?<eos> Huh? Is this fake?<eos> This is real.<eos> I really dislocated my shoulder.<eos> Were you even in the park yesterday?<eos> Look, I was on my way to feed the hummingbirds, and I stopped for a breakfast burrito.<eos> The farting.<eos> And Lord Sheldon...<eos> He lunged at a bird, I dropped the burrito, and it landed on a log in the creek.<eos> So, I go to reach for it, I lose my balance, and I fall on my shoulder really weird.
Another?<eos> By the way, it's ridiculous that pot is illegal.<eos> It grows in the ground!<eos> I've planted marijuana in community gardens all over the city, and it hasn't hurt anyone!<eos> - What?<eos> Okay, stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> You're all being awful, horrible men!<eos> Your little friend come to visit?<eos> Clarence, if you mention anything about women, or menstruation, or anything, I'm gonna take your face and I'm gonna shove it in those brambles.
Every time.<eos> Well, thank God you haven't torn down the gazebo yet.<eos> Don't remind me.<eos> The demolition people couldn't get here until this afternoon.<eos> I've had to look at that ugly thing all day long.<eos> Ugly thing?<eos> Let me tell you a little something about this ugly thing, ma'am.<eos> 150 years ago, an interracial couple was married here and slaughtered by their own families.<eos> It's one of the most beautiful stories in Pawnee's history.<eos> - Why are you trying to destroy it?
Little bit.<eos> Ima.<eos> It's kind of a big move.<eos> Yup.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Nope.<eos> Well... I hope you wrapped your shit.<eos> That was a high-traffic zone you were rippin' through last night.<eos> Hindsight.<eos> If a dick move could've pushed Donna away, would you have done it?
Not since the holiday party.<eos> Doug's agency threw it out by the airport, which is where Stan works, so we all went.<eos> You just never think something like this is gonna happen.<eos> So you don't make time.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> That was the travel agency.<eos> If Doug was hiding from someone, he wasn't doing a very good job.<eos> Apparently he hasn't missed a day of work until yesterday.<eos> What about the Dysons' trip?<eos> They booked it through a different agency.
Yeah, from who knows where.<eos> He needs to know, donald, today. Are you crazy?<eos> No, not like this.<eos> You get downstairs and you stall him.<eos> What are you going to do, Climb out the bathroom window?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Go on, get down there, go!<eos> I heard screaming coming from downstairs, and I went out Through the bathroom window.<eos> It was stuck.<eos> I had to kick it out.
No.<eos> My name's Michael Scott.<eos> Hello.<eos> Oh, hello, mr. Scott.<eos> Pleased to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> We are very excited about the merger with sabre.<eos> I think you have a great accent.<eos> Aw, thank you.<eos> I've been working on it Since I was a little girl.
All right.<eos> Shit, it's huge.<eos> Yes, she could be anywhere.<eos> All right.<eos> You two, go with Teddy Bear and search in that direction.<eos> What is it, Gilou?<eos> Are you on the rags?<eos> I read your reference on my transfer application.<eos> You're having a laugh, aren't you?<eos> Stop it, I haven't submitted it yet.
Without a parachute.<eos> Well, there should be a lot more metal pieces around here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look around.<eos> Got an arm or here.<eos> Well, the flesh kind or the metal kind?<eos> Metal.<eos> Hmm. Got a nozzle.<eos> I got anothebody.<eos> Oh, don't move it.
Okay.<eos> Look around.<eos> Got an arm or here.<eos> Well, the flesh kind or the metal kind?<eos> Metal.<eos> Hmm. Got a nozzle.<eos> I got anothebody.<eos> Oh, don't move it.<eos> Here I come.<eos> Bag it up, Palmer.
Mr. Tillman, Ms. Tillman, please.<eos> We're gonna need to see your inventory lists and blueprints so that we can confirm that neither of you manufactured it.<eos> I will consider your request.<eos> It's not a request.<eos> Well, look at that.<eos> A court order.<eos> Was that so hard?<eos> Wait a minute, does he still think one of us murdered Sayers?<eos> Oh, he was working both of you.<eos> Well, you insist that you didn't provide him with the equipment, he must've stolen it.
She needs a transplant.<eos> She can wait.<eos> The inotropes are working.<eos> She could go for months.<eos> She's a difficult match, with antibodies to a broad range of HIA antigens.<eos> If I pass now, another compatible heart may not come along.<eos> He could throw a clot while we're standing here.<eos> You told Dorothy she's in good hands.<eos> And she is.<eos> This heart belongs to her and she's going to get it.
Maybe that itchy feeling you have is guilt.<eos> Guilt is a powerful emotion.<eos> Every Thanksgiving, it makes me take three planes just so I can visit my racist aunt Cookie.<eos> So this is guilt, huh?<eos> In the past, I've always just counteracted this feeling with other emotions, like sugar or drunk.<eos> You should talk Walter.<eos> Maybe find some way to help him.<eos> Guilt it is a terrible thing to carry around.<eos> Well, I do hate this feeling.<eos> - I hate it like I hate...
And... and when it hardens, it forms an unbreakable arch support in your foot.<eos> Oh, well, see? There you go.<eos> All you needed was one good idea.<eos> And you got that because you listened to everyone, which you did because you listened to me.<eos> In case you missed it, the lesson here is listen to me.<eos> What's this I'm hearing about Ethiopian stew shoes?<eos> It's all they're talking about upstairs.<eos> Well, speaking of exciting developments...<eos> When I was in HR, I dug up this old memo about your promotion.<eos> All the executives had to sign off on it.
- Let's go.<eos> You ever been to Kabob Kingdom?<eos> At the food court?<eos> I love that place.<eos> - Hey, Berta, would you grab me a beer?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - Jake, grab your uncle a beer.<eos> - Let him get it himself.<eos> Sorry, I tried.<eos> Numbnuts, take a beer out of the fridge and bring it over here.
Oh, she is horrible.<eos> Right?<eos> Are you going to defend me?<eos> Do I have to?<eos> Just bring up more wine.<eos> My mustard jar's empty.<eos> I am tired from sharing my gift.<eos> are you a genius?<eos> Baby, are you looking for your necklace?<eos> I found it in the shower.
Right?<eos> Are you going to defend me?<eos> Do I have to?<eos> Just bring up more wine.<eos> My mustard jar's empty.<eos> I am tired from sharing my gift.<eos> are you a genius?<eos> Baby, are you looking for your necklace?<eos> I found it in the shower.<eos> A big glob of conditioner was about to suck it down the drain.
You ready?<eos> Yep.<eos> Ow.<eos> Ow!<eos> Ben, I haven't even touched you yet.<eos> You're doing a great job.<eos> When thinking about the end makes you reevaluate the now.<eos> There.<eos> I just signed your ridiculous will.<eos> But before I give it to you, I'd like you to make me a promise That just you and I can go away this weekend--
T-t-tu-tu-rt-t-t-tle...<eos> Quiet!<eos> Again, Yusuf. Relax and speak louder.<eos> The e-e-eagle... a-a-an<eos> Quiet!<eos> A-a-an and t-t-t-tu-tur... r-r-t-tle.<eos> Fine, Yusuf. Let's try again later.<eos> I don't know what to do with him.<eos> Drink your milk, Yusuf.<eos> Cut it.
On... blue summer nights... I'll go... along pathways...<eos> 27th of October, 2009.<eos> The tenth month. 31st day. 44th Week.<eos> Daytime gets two minutes shorter. Fish storm.<eos> Yusuf!<eos> Where are the eggs, son?<eos> I'm baking cookies for your father's return.<eos> Bring me the eggs.<eos> Drink your milk, Yusuf.<eos> You didn't drink it.
He can't be in trouble. He'll be back.<eos> If you watch the boy, I can go down to the gendarmerie.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> You have grown so much.<eos> I knitted this sweater. Try it.<eos> It looks so nice, Yusuf.<eos> Come with me to the highland?<eos> Want to come?<eos> I was asleep in Mecca when the ceiling opened and Gabriel descended into my room.<eos> He pulled out my heart and washed it with holy water.

Mrs. Bellow.<eos> Look Jessie, I know Carter will always be your first.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I'm OK with that.<eos> Really.<eos> Good.<eos> Because he may be my first but um... You, Tom Bellow, will always be my last.<eos> What were you saying about christening the place?<eos> Something's not working.<eos> Should we put it back?
You and danny?<eos> I would have guessed anyone else.<eos> Jenna, sue--<eos> All right, come on.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Well, I don't know if you know this, jack, But the workplace is a hierarchy, And I am danny's boss.<eos> Sometimes all the... [imitating jack] Pretty little things down here want to be With the people up here.<eos> And they come into your office late one night With some flimsy excuse.<eos> [knocks on door] hey, liz. I just want to show you this new iphone app.<eos> You shake it and it sounds like an empty can.
Deal.<eos> See ya.<eos> Get out.<eos> What sort of a welcome's that, eh?<eos> She once told me that her... ..that her big dream was to go skinny-dipping at night in Crete.<eos> I kept her messages on me mobile so I can hear her voice.<eos> If there's yellow stuff in it, it's not cancer.<eos> I put sweet corn in that pasta dish.<eos> I were trying out some brown-eye action with a party blower.<eos> But when I took it out, the nozzle got stuck.
See that hotty over there nursing a Black Russian?<eos> She's about to chase that with a white American.<eos> Up top!<eos> You know, if you're not careful, you're gonna lose me.<eos> Hey, guys, what should I say when Dale calls for a second date?<eos> How do you know he's gonna call?<eos> I mean, he couldn't keep his good eye off of me.<eos> Well, let him down easy.<eos> People are fragile.<eos> Sometimes without even meaning to, you might rip someone's beating heart out and stomp on it in a roomful of 26 people and a teacher's assistant.
Just gettíng to the poínt where l can sleep through the níght agaín.<eos> Good, good.<eos> You gotta get your rest.<eos> - Keller.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> - Okay, that's great.<eos> That is the Mayflower signature right there.<eos> That glass has been through so much.<eos> You can see the care that went into making it.
What's that? Well, like I say, depends on the angle.<eos> It's either the exposed pain centre of big fella's brain, being tortured relentlessly...<eos> - Or? - Or it's the gas pedal, the accelerator,<eos> Starship UK's go-faster button.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> Try, go on. The spaceship that could never fly, no vibration on deck.<eos> This creature - this poor, trapped, terrified creature.<eos> It's not infesting you, it's not invading - it's what you have instead of an engine.<eos> And this place down here is where you hurt it, where you torture it, day after day, just to keep it moving.
A king's ransom.<eos> Literally.<eos> Now, one source alleges he tried to buy his release with part of that treasury in Mortmaigne's safekeeping.<eos> Why do I get the feeling there's a however coming?<eos> Because I suspect you're much smarter than you look.<eos> It's a compliment.<eos> Aye, backhanded!<eos> When word was sent to Crevecoeur, Richard Mortmaigne claimed, with much regret, that it had been lost.<eos> Richard Mortmaigne stole the treasure?<eos> And concealed it somewhere on the estate.
I don't think I have ever seen you in chartreuse.<eos> But look at how much it costs.<eos> You can afford it.<eos> Go on.<eos> Don't you want to see yourself in such a dress?<eos> Shouldn't my ma wait until the Chancery money arrives?<eos> Yes, and our sale will be over by then, I'm certain.<eos> I'm sure, as Mrs Timmins may soon be your neighbour, perhaps a regular customer, you would not wish to miss this moment to introduce her to your services.<eos> Our services are of course available to any customer who can afford them.<eos> Mrs Timmins, my newspaper will advance the price of the dress if you would like to try it.
On the count of four.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> # Onward Christian soldiers<eos> # Marching as to the war<eos> # With the cross of Jesus... #<eos> You have to tell him.<eos> I'm so afraid.<eos> If I open this letter, I will lose everything I have.<eos> But I must open it and I don't know what will happen when I do.
I'm so afraid.<eos> If I open this letter, I will lose everything I have.<eos> But I must open it and I don't know what will happen when I do.<eos> Do you have the letter?<eos> Robert...<eos> I didn't dare tell you.<eos> I wanted to put it off until I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Until I felt brave enough.<eos> You open it, Robert.
I'd have done the same in your position.<eos> No, please, please!<eos> You've got what you want.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> No-one knows yet just how effective this vaccine will be.<eos> Perhaps it'll work, I hope so, but up until then, we need some insurance.<eos> I'm afraid we'll have to borrow your son<eos> - for a little longer. - No!<eos> We had a deal!<eos> You made a business proposal, I'm obliged to reject it.
But look, you have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of.<eos> I mean, I don't...<eos> I don't know why you would lie.<eos> Well, why do you?<eos> About dating Ryan?<eos> The whole event down there is a lie.<eos> Your whole persona.<eos> Okay, I know that right now this seems like a really big deal.<eos> And I am not saying that it isn't, but that letter, that letter was sweet.<eos> And anyone who reads it would see that.
About last night.<eos> About what happened.<eos> Me too.<eos> Yeah, I was up all night thinking about it.<eos> Um...<eos> I just don't know how many more times I can say that I'm trying.<eos> You know, I can only do what I think is right.<eos> I didn't out you on purpose.<eos> I didn't Xerox your letter.<eos> I didn't stick it on your locker.
Honey, claire, you remember tom mickelson from the office, And his wife, susan.<eos> Hi.<eos> I do.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is your coat stuck?<eos> It is.<eos> It really is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's in there pretty darn good.<eos> [ laughs nervously ] why don't you take it off?
I do.<eos> I guess I've always known.<eos> Hi, there.<eos> Uh, do you still have that fuchsia Dior dress?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> You're going to get me in trouble.<eos> My manager said I wasn't allowed to let you see the dress again.<eos> Or dance with it.<eos> No, no, I'm not here to dance with it.<eos> I'm here to buy it.
Oh, great.<eos> Uh, stare much?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm looking for Nate Bazile.<eos> He's not here.<eos> He's out doing laundry.<eos> Hmm.<eos> That wasn't a euphemism.<eos> I didn't get your name.<eos> I didn't give it to you.
- I'm a janitor.<eos> I mopped up the Lux thing, the engagement thing, the Baze thing- with corporate and our audience- and now everyone loves Cate and Ryan, the happy couple, so until further notice, that's who you are, okay?<eos> Right.<eos> I made my bed, now I have to lie about it.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I know that it's tough, but, hey, maybe you guys will work things out.<eos> Or hey, maybe we won't.<eos> You know, as long as Ryan is baring his teeth at me, it's not like I'm gonna say,<eos> "Hey, here, here, here's my heart.<eos> Why don't you chew it up again?"
Rosalie, she did not have children.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> MonsieurThompson, tonight it is his birthday celebration.<eos> You will deliver to Miss Danziger this dress, to Babette's, the nightclub.<eos> - Miss Danziger?<eos> - The paramour.<eos> What is it? The sweetheart of Mr. Thompson.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> You will be there to Babette's by 10:00, and then you shall wait until after Miss Danziger does the surprise.<eos> The silk fringe, the beading, it is very delicate, so you must assist her in putting it on.
Wife's gonna shit.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Keep it coming.<eos> That's right.<eos> Mrs. Schroeder, welcome.<eos> Mr. Thompson, happy birthday.<eos> Why, thank you.<eos> Oh. I'm to deliver this gown to Miss Danziger.<eos> Oh. Of course.<eos> I'll put it in the dressing room for you.
Familiar with the phrase?<eos> MUSIC: "The Ride of the Valkyries" by Wagner<eos> Whoah! Ooh! Yes.<eos> I enjoyed the schadenfreude I experienced when my husband was killed by a local gangster.<eos> Is the correct use of the word schadenfreude.<eos> APPLAUSE Correct but deeply in need of therapy.<eos> Yes.<eos> So schadenfreude means...<eos> Pleasure in the misfortune of others.<eos> and there is no English phrase for it so we had to borrow it from the Germans.
Who needs a knife when you can kill with your fingertips?<eos> The sick come here 'cause they believe that the Monument of Ardris has the power to heal them.<eos> Most perish within days.<eos> Zedd, maybe the compass led us here so we can help them.<eos> ( chants in ancient tongue )<eos> ( gagging )<eos> Zedd?<eos> This blight...<eos> It's indeed fueled by powerful black magic.<eos> If I try to absorb it, it'll kill me.
# Oh, she cast away her silken gown She cast away her pride<eos> # And ran with him into the night Down to the sea so wild. #<eos> Ohhh... # I'd rather live an hour here<eos> # Than seven long years with thee<eos> # And feel the salt upon my cheek<eos> # And know that I am free. #<eos> Alf?<eos> My ma can't write more than her own name.<eos> She got the prison chaplain to set down that letter for her.<eos> But she knew you'd be able to read it.
Like brother and sister almost.<eos> But we ain't.<eos> I'm an Arless...and you're a Timmins.<eos> We're as different as mud and marble.<eos> Alf!<eos> BELL RINGS I'm sorry I'm late, ma'am.<eos> I had to be unpicked.<eos> Never mind, you're just in time.<eos> Have you seen the milk?<eos> I used it.
Made a choice a long time ago that it would be Gilbert blood that brought her back to life.<eos> I had Jeremy all ready to go, but...<eos> Stefan!<eos> You can't just leave him in there, grams!<eos> - He made his choice!<eos> Here.<eos> Just tell me what to do.<eos> I'll do it!<eos> We are not strong enough.<eos> Even if we were able to bring the seal down, there's no guarantee that we can get it back up again.
Oh, we'd love to.<eos> Good call, honey.<eos> Coffee or--<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Wow...<eos> You guys are pigs.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> We've been robbed.<eos> What--the window...<eos> Adam, did you leave it open?
"The art of photography".<eos> I took lots of photos wherever I went.<eos> One day... I made a trip to the mountains.<eos> I searched for that thing in the photo.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Auntie...<eos> I have never shown anyone the proof of my discovery.<eos> In fact... the film was not even developed.<eos> I was obsessed with this new creature.<eos> I tried to chase it down while it leapt from branch to branch.
You can't be doing this to us.<eos> Don't feel bad, Charles.<eos> We're the best at this.<eos> What do you mean, they went rogue?<eos> General, Mrs. Turner pulled a gun on me.<eos> And might I add, I think she may have a bit of a problem with the, uh, sauce.<eos> Uh, the Turners stole Otto's software.<eos> The Turners are two of the most decorated spies in the CIA.<eos> There must be some explanation for their behavior.<eos> I suggest you find it.
Misebon?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've been lying to you.<eos> I told you Naoki couldn't come to class because of colds or illnesses.<eos> But he's not just been skipping.<eos> He wants to come to class, but he's very sick mentally.<eos> Werther was the only one in the class who didn't know why he was like that to begin with.<eos> (We'll refer to the one who leaked Miss Moriguchi's confession as Boy 'C')<eos> The mail was sent to everyone in the class just after the closing ceremony that day.<eos> Nobody knew who sent it.
But I want Nana's ring.<eos> No!<eos> You want to buy that woman boots, I can't stop you, but she is not getting my grandmother's ring.<eos> Nana promised I could have that ring when I got married.<eos> You don't get a say.<eos> You're making a mistake.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe the mistake I made was coming home.<eos> God, your friend owns this place?<eos> It's pretty swank.<eos> Yeah, we used to call it "the house that bulimia built."
You hungry?<eos> Mom made lentil soup.<eos> - I told her it was your favorite.<eos> - Oh, your mother's full of thoughts.<eos> Oh, in English, we say "thoughtful."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, you're not wearing your ring.<eos> Gee, I hope there's not a problem.<eos> I am all day thinking about this ring.<eos> I do not want it.
Oh, in English, we say "thoughtful."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, you're not wearing your ring.<eos> Gee, I hope there's not a problem.<eos> I am all day thinking about this ring.<eos> I do not want it.<eos> - But...<eos> Preston said you loved it.<eos> - I do, but it is too precious.<eos> This ring has been in your family for generations, and for you to give it to woman you don't know, it feels wrong.

- Wait a minute.<eos> - What? Well, just look at that.<eos> - What?<eos> - Something very not good indeed.<eos> - What thing very not good?<eos> - Look there, in the window of the church.<eos> - Is it a face?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And not a nice face at all.<eos> I know evil when I see it and I see it in that window.
Paula watson, the sea t-filler coordinator, gave us.<eos> Six of the names were bogus.<eos> That's the same number of guys Charlie thinks we're looking for.<eos> There's more.<eos> I spoke with one of the seat-fillers That was there that night.<eos> He asked paula if he could sit In an open seat next to sven regal.<eos> You know, kid's seen all of his movies.<eos> And he still wanted to sit next to him?<eos> Paula told him she had the seat reserved.<eos> She gave it to an older guy who spoke spanish.
Be a man, tyrel.<eos> Tyrel, just tell them what you told me.<eos> I was recruited to the crew when I first got to covington.<eos> A few months ago we did a job.<eos> Some serious stuff went down.<eos> A guy died.<eos> The man's name was richard grange.<eos> And according to insurance reports,<eos> That fancy egg was stolen from his house.<eos> Yeah, I kept it.
- Cool. [Rock music] - * I can't count the reasons I should stay *<eos> - hey.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Did you hear?<eos> It's cute...<eos> Annie and Vaughn.<eos> - Get to the cute part.<eos> - She's into him.<eos> She asked for my blessing.<eos> - And you gave it?
- Asshole!<eos> I do. I get it.<eos> Hey, don't move!<eos> Swear to God, you make another move, I shoot the judge!<eos> Can we agree the young lady can go?<eos> No.<eos> I think she ought to know the kind of dick she's sucking.<eos> Mr. Corum... no, I am talking to the judge, and the only thing I want from him is the one thing I couldn't get before...<eos> His attention!<eos> Well, I think you got it.
Hey.<eos> Uh... you, uh, you save me a dance, okay?<eos> I was not waiting in that line at Sam's.<eos> And Addison has much nicer skin care products.<eos> Your little friend spilled bruschetta on my dress.<eos> - Oh, I'm sure she didn't mean to.<eos> - Of course she did.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> Why'd you bring her? Why do you care?<eos> I mean, apart from the tomatoes. If you'll excuse me, I have to take this dress off and clean it. Mm.
- It was all my idea.<eos> A... and we could have held Anglet if you were man enough to admit<eos> - selling him the ring in the first place.<eos> - That's it. Get out.<eos> You better pray nothing happens to my family.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I want the real ring now.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I gave it to you.
I found out that Smithson was really Stans, found out about the ring.<eos> I approached him.<eos> We talked.<eos> He couldn't sell the ring.<eos> It was too hot.<eos> But I know some people who know some people that put me in touch with Anglet, and that was it.<eos> I brokered the deal.<eos> Why'd you kill Stans?<eos> He changed his mind.<eos> Didn't want to sell it.

You're placing Enoch Thompson at the head of a criminal organization controlling Atlantic County.<eos> I believe I've established a pervasive pattern of illegality as it relates to alcohol with him at the very center.<eos> Where are the financial records?<eos> The corroborating witnesses?<eos> What do I take to the District Attorney?<eos> I'm asking for the resources to build that case.<eos> I need numbers, Nelson!<eos> Bottles broken by the thousand, trucks, boats and stills seized and put out of commission.<eos> There's also a capital crime there.<eos> I don't see it.
Tied into the house power,<eos> And the volt meter is ready to go.<eos> Uh, so, Walter, you're sure that I'm doing this right?<eos> It's perfect, Olivia.<eos> Just make sure they're tightened down.<eos> Walter, you really think that his is gonna work?<eos> There's no reason it shouldn't.<eos> I mean, something stopped this creature<eos> From developing,<eos> And because it's part mechanical, If we pump it with enough electricity,
What makes it so special?<eos> Put simply, it's a power source.<eos> But it's capable of many wondrous things.<eos> And until quite recently...<eos> I was kept alive his glass heart.<eos> I had a bad heart,<eos> And so I invented the glass heart.<eos> And then a few nights ago,<eos> Someone slipped into my room<eos> And stole it while I was asleep.
I'll tell you how the story ends.<eos> Peter.<eos> Peter, please.<eos> I can change.<eos> I can fix the damage I've done.<eos> Please, give me another chance.<eos> and peter looked inside walter's eyes<eos> And realized there was still goodness inside him.<eos> So peter took his special heart,<eos> And with all his might, he split it in two.
She's still grappling with the idea that she affects the weather.<eos> You still believe that?<eos> And you still don't?<eos> When you've ruled everything else out, you have to accept what's left.<eos> Guess I'm not ready to rule everything else out yet.<eos> I know that picture.<eos> - You do? - Mmhmm.<eos> Colorado Kid murder.<eos> Chief was a beat cop on the case.<eos> He never solved it, which I try and remind him of whenever I can.
How would an absence of calm and cool be useful to her?<eos> Good point.<eos> Correct me if I'm wrong, but for the killer to open the flask, they would have to expose themselves to the virus, which case, they would be dying or possibly dead already.<eos> No, there's an antidote.<eos> It's an enzyme compound.<eos> If taken before exposure, it prevents infection.<eos> I assume whoever did this took a dose.<eos> Couldn't you j-- no, I can't take it now.<eos> The antidote only works if taken before exposure, as I said.<eos> Why didn't you take it before, just as a precaution?
Yech, they're all horrible.<eos> Yeah, the Simpson family is a long line of horse thieves, deadbeats, horse beats, dead thieves, and even a few alcoholics.<eos> There must have been some good ancestors.<eos> Grampa,<eos> Maybe the nicest was Abigail Simpson, who you know as the Pittsburgh Poisoner.<eos> Listen, Lisa, you're going to find more than you bargained for.<eos> If I were you, I wouldn't dig into the past.<eos> I lived in some of that past, and I got out for a reason.<eos> I won't give up.<eos> I have to know that somewhere in the muck and the mire and the Pittsburgh Poisoners, this family had a noble spark, and I will find it, even if I have to go back to Adam and Eve.
What ring?<eos> Asa told you of Ulrich, who took the compass out of our valley.<eos> Before he left, the Creator made two magical rings so that Ulrich could speak to Asa even when he was far away.<eos> When Asa slept,<eos> I'd take the ring so that I could speak to Ulrich.<eos> I was in love with him and this was the only way we could be together.<eos> But he grew old and you didn't.<eos> When Ulrich died,<eos> Asa cast his ring away.<eos> But I found it and secretly kept it.

I was trained to hate you.<eos> But I don't.<eos> And I don't wanna die without you knowing that I consider you to be my friend.<eos> I think of you as a friend too.<eos> We're going to get out of here.<eos> We both know Richard.<eos> He's coming for us.<eos> - He just needs a little more time.<eos> - I know.<eos> And I'm gonna make sure he gets it.
- No.<eos> Stop pretending my life means as much as yours.<eos> Line the hall and connect each fuse so that they run into the courtyard.<eos> And hurry, we don't have much time.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Dragon's Breath?<eos> We know the Nygaax will be coming back for the rest of the men on the list.<eos> But to get inside, the creature must come through here.<eos> And when it does, those doors will be barricaded and sealed with mortar.<eos> The Nygaax will be trapped in here, and then we'll blow it into the underworld.
Oh!<eos> Ohh!<eos> Ohh.<eos> Oh. Ohh.<eos> Still say there's no curse?<eos> Ohh.<eos> Ruh-roh.<eos> Once Stanford got out of surgery, he confessed to everything-- how he lured Nicole into the burial chamber and how they fought when she refused to celebrate with him.<eos> So what happened to the mummy he swapped for Nicole's body?<eos> The body was so fragile that all Stanford had to do was strip off the wrapping and stomp it into dust.

Says... I want them?<eos> You know...<eos> See War and famine,<eos> Even if I could cram the rings back on their bony fingers, I doubt it would do much good.<eos> They're withered husks right now --<eos> Fetal position on the floor --<eos> All thanks to you.<eos> So I don't want the rings.<eos> What I want is retribution.<eos> And I'm gonna rip it right out of your ass!
These guys...<eos> They couldn't blow up the Sears catalog.<eos> I mean...<eos> Blow up the Sears tower. Right.<eos> Well, that was-- That was Plan A.<eos> Plan B was just to fuck up one Sears store.<eos> You know, just...<eos> And just the Home and Garden Department.<eos> You know, this...<eos> They were go to buy a dress, wear it once and return it.
The people can't name three branches of governments.<eos> They're full of fear and misinformation.<eos> Drag them to it.<eos> Try to explain health care to them.<eos> It's like trying to explain to your dog,<eos> "Why you're going to the vet?"<eos> Just open the car door and jingle the leash and talk like this and he'll go.<eos> Just give the people health care.<eos> These tea baggers are protesting it.<eos> Five years after they have it, they'll forget they were against it.

- We have problems.<eos> No, my family has problems.<eos> Actual, irresolvable, psychotic problems that will never, ever change.<eos> Your family has what, like, cute little dilemmas?<eos> But, no matter what, you always stick together, right?<eos> I'm so right, I've seen the movie.<eos> Smiling faces, matching outfits, doing song and dance numbers as you flee the Nazis.<eos> You have good spider sense.<eos> Yeah, it's tuned.<eos> Ever turn it on yourself?
Now get the hell away from our food.<eos> - "our" food? - Yeah.<eos> It's mine and janie's.<eos> Well, hers mainly.<eos> But she shares with me.<eos> Not that I'm a big eater.<eos> I watch my figure.<eos> We didn't catch your name.<eos> What is it?<eos> What, I gotta write it down for you?
That's a brilliant one.<eos> Monkhouse.<eos> Bob Monkhouse.<eos> It's hard when you write about comedy to make it funny as well.<eos> Did you...?<eos> we put a joke on every page.<eos> Some of it's complicated.<eos> They say analysing jokes is like dissecting a frog - no one's that interested and the frog dies.<eos> Like digging up the roots of a plant.<eos> And killing it as you do it.
He's familiar with the promenade, so we should start questioning the employees, the marina shopkeepers and, you know, the residents.<eos> Victim?<eos> Captain Joseph L. Norton.<eos> Supply Corps, 63 years old, no family.<eos> Six months from retirement, spotless service record.<eos> Never been married.<eos> He was about to be.<eos> What about the engagement ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> This is a copy of the receipt where Norton bought it.
Joann Fielding told us the same thing she told you.<eos> Had the ring on when they were robbed.<eos> You look at her fingers?<eos> Arthritis.<eos> Try getting a size 4 ring on there.<eos> What size are you, David?<eos> She wouldn't know that.<eos> Five.<eos> Every girl knows her ring size, just in case.<eos> Joann said she was wearing it.
Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Now listen, do you think I could have a word with your client for a second?<eos> No.<eos> Anything you have to say to her, you can now say to me.<eos> Good night, Agent DiNozzo.<eos> This an intervention?<eos> Told me there were cocktails.<eos> You're holding Lieutenant Shankton for Norton's murder.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So you think he did it?
He's in Andover with the debate team.<eos> But, um, let me just change.<eos> - Where... where should I meet you?<eos> - I'm at 60 Thompson.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> After all he's done for my mom, I at least owe him a conversation.<eos> "We regret to inform you that due to the high volume of qualified applicants, the dramatic writing program at the Tisch school of the arts..."<eos> We, uh, have decided to crush your dreams with this form letter.<eos> Apparently, there was... there's only one spot for transfer students, and I didn't get it, so...
- Oh, Vegas wedding, huh?<eos> - We want Elvis to marry us.<eos> - Elvis?<eos> - Esau loves Elvis.<eos> - Yes, it's... it's Elvis, Vegas.<eos> It's the ultimate American wedding.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay, it looks like we can't get you that physical soon enough.<eos> Did you bring the form?<eos> - Yes, I got it right here.
We loved each other.<eos> Everything was good.<eos> How was the remodel?<eos> That can be stressful.<eos> Things were good.<eos> But that day, we fought.<eos> That's why I went to the movies. Over her hours. Ah.<eos> It was just so stupid.<eos> She was so stressed over that Draber case, you know?<eos> She called it her "career-maker."
- Your Honor...<eos> - ...if you'll let me, I can handle him. - Mr. Jane. - That is your name, correct?<eos> - That's correct.<eos> Patrick Jane. This court hereby fines you $1000.<eos> Make it 2000, and let me tell this tiresome woman to move it along.<eos> - Two thousand, then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Counselor, you heard the man.<eos> Move it along. So, Agent Lisbon, let's get back to this video.<eos> That night was the first time you'd ever seen it?
That is the last and only offer you'll get, you miserable sack of crap.<eos> I realized the Drabers didn't hire Sylvan when they didn't kill Lisbon and me.<eos> If they don't kill cops, they're certainly not gonna kill an ADA.<eos> But the Drabers were connected somehow, weren't they?<eos> Because their case was a "career-maker," according to Kelly. And you wanted to be DA someday.<eos> The Draber case would have made me a lock for DA.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And it should have been me.<eos> I had seniority.<eos> It was mine and the bitch took it.
Bobby Mann is dead.<eos> What?<eos> What happened?<eos> They're saying he had a heart attack.<eos> I'm telling you, the guy said that somebody wanted him dead, and then he ends up dead.<eos> That can't be a coincidence.<eos> Bobby Mann had a history of heart disease, and on the autopsy reports, it states that the cause of death was a heart attack.<eos> That can't be a coincidence either.<eos> Did Lanie do the autopsy?<eos> No, but she sent it to me.
- We need your help<eos> To find her son Eddie.<eos> - My help?<eos> Hmm. How ironic.<eos> - Moira'll tell you where her boy is if you ask.<eos> - Well, I'm not in an asking mood.<eos> Plain fact is, I don't inform on my own.<eos> You can call it a sense of honor.<eos> A thing most rare in these environs.<eos> And I'm not going to defile it for a man who defiled his uniform.
I'm sure it's a training bra.<eos> I have an unwanted boner.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hoisting a bag.<eos> Ay, there's no better feeling on earth.<eos> Now what are you up to?<eos> Whatever happened to "Hi"?<eos> Hi.<eos> Now what are you up to?<eos> A letter's coming from school, and I need to be home to keep Mom and Dad from getting it.
What the...?<eos> You're a month behind on homework?<eos> I tried really hard to stop you from finding out.<eos> Does that help?<eos> A little!<eos> These are Bart's uncompleted homework assignments for the last month: worksheets, problem sets, book reports, math jumbles, dioramas, topic sentences, conclusions, bibliographies, synonyms, mean-the-sames, define-a-likes, word twins and one Thanksgiving hand-turkey.<eos> One month?<eos> That's a heavy workload for a fourth grader.<eos> I say this boy needs more homework.<eos> I don't have to do it with him, do I?
mario: Mi hija.<eos> STABLER: Sir. So you're her father?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The guy who spent $500 a head, and a mooch spoils my princess' special day.<eos> You must have been furious.<eos> I could have killed him.<eos> Threw him out the fire escape on his trasero, fin:<eos> That's got to be our victim.<eos> Can you freeze on his face?<eos> Well, he was good-looking before somebody bashed it in.
Thought I'd won his trust.<eos> This one night, we're at his flat and he gives me a glass of wine.<eos> I drink it... wake up tied to a chair.<eos> It turns out, he'd known I was police from day one.<eos> He showed me a picture of Grace Allen.<eos> She was alive.<eos> And the picture right next to her face, that day's paper.<eos> And he said,<eos> "this is the closest you'll ever come."<eos> And he set light to the picture and burnt it right in front of me.
All right, the guy was arrested every month for years.<eos> And then nothing, starting in June of 2006.<eos> Which got me thinking.<eos> How could a perfect set of his fingerprints turn up four years later?<eos> Well, stranger things have happened.<eos> Did I ever tell you about the time that me and Frank found a .45 pistol in the small intestine...<eos> I found this under your seat.<eos> It's not what it looks like.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Because it looks like you stole a semiautomatic weapon from the evidence room and planted it in the bushes of the mother of my ex-girlfriend!
The kind I just put in your wine.<eos> - Vavoom!<eos> - Va-what?<eos> I can't believe I've never thought of this before, it's genius.<eos> Right!<eos> Landed, come on.<eos> - Where are we?<eos> - Planet One. The oldest planet in the universe.<eos> There's a cliff of pure diamond and, according to legend, on the cliff there's writing.<eos> Letters 50 feet high, a message from the dawn of time, and no-one knows what it says, cos no-one's ever translated it.
- More than just a fairy tale.<eos> There was a goblin.<eos> Or a trickster, or a warrior.<eos> A nameless, terrible thing, soaked in the blood of a billion galaxies.<eos> The most feared being in all the cosmos.<eos> And nothing could stop it, or hold it, or reason with it.<eos> One day it would just drop out of the sky and tear down your world.<eos> - How did it end up in there?<eos> - You know fairy tales.<eos> A good wizard tricked it.
What's coming out?<eos> The Pandorica is ready.<eos> What, you mean it's open?<eos> You have been scanned.<eos> Assessed.<eos> Understood.<eos> Doctor.<eos> The ring.<eos> Remember the ring?<eos> You'd never let me wear it in case I lost it.

Doctor.<eos> The ring.<eos> Remember the ring?<eos> You'd never let me wear it in case I lost it.<eos> - The Doctor gave it to me.<eos> - Show it to me.<eos> Show me the ring.<eos> - Amy...<eos> - Come on!<eos> Just show it to me.
So I was doing some checking on the ring... Hold on.<eos> Sheldon, is there ketchup on that table?<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> Oh, here's a fun fact.<eos> Ketchup started out as a general term for sauce typically made of mushrooms or fish brine with herbs and spices.<eos> Some popular early main ingredients included blueberry, anchovy oyster, kidney bean and grape.<eos> No, that's okay, I'll get it.<eos> Listen, I was looking at the ring and it seemed a little weird.<eos> No copyright notice on it.<eos> So I took it down to this buddy of mine who deals with shall we say, the seedy underbelly of the collectibles world.
He can have it back. As long as he promises to make me a hobbit in his next movie.<eos> But there are no Jewish hobbits.<eos> Clearly, you've never been to my house for dinner on Rosh Hashanah.<eos> We are not blackmailing Peter...<eos> - All right, where's the ring?<eos> - You mean my ring?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - The ring was unguarded.<eos> It was sitting on the table.<eos> Anyone could've taken it.
We lost.<eos> - You're useless.<eos> - I told you that when you hired me.<eos> - I'm signing off now.<eos> - Call your mother.<eos> She worries.<eos> So you know, if we're bringing in cousins who are lawyers prepare for shock and awe.<eos> You know, I am ending this.<eos> Penny didn't wanna hold the ring.<eos> She gave it to me.

My precious.<eos> I knew it.<eos> - Give us the precious.<eos> Never.<eos> - Give it to me.<eos> - Get off of me. - Give me the ring.<eos> - It's mine.<eos> I gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.<eos> - Give it back.<eos> - Give it to me.

Did you make this for him? (Gate creaks closed)<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, the boat's tough on Travis.<eos> You know, my bed's too small for him to lie across my feet.<eos> So, you know, we sleep face-to-face.<eos> I bet his nose is cold and gross.<eos> Yeah, it is at first, but you know, my nose warms his up.<eos> Well, are you just gonna sit there and torture me by drinking wine?<eos> We're in a bar.<eos> Just let me smell it.
Mandarin?<eos> Ni hao ma?<eos> Ni hao ma?<eos> Ni hao... (Telephone rings)<eos> (Beep) Hey, Ellie.<eos> Where are you guys?<eos> No one's answering their phones, and our favorite show's about to start.<eos> All right. I know this sounds crazy, but seems like everyone's dodging me.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> The show's over, but I dvr'd it.
Uh, listen. I forgot.<eos> Lightman called.<eos> He said he wanted you to, uh, get ready to present your research on lowland gorillas.<eos> When?<eos> This afternoon.<eos> But I have at least 2 days more work on that.<eos> Well, better get on it.<eos> Well...<eos> What about this case?<eos> I'll cover it.
I'm fine.<eos> So you're leaving?<eos> I told you, I don't have a choice.<eos> Marry me.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> I said, "marry me."<eos> You've got to be joking.<eos> No.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You made me a promise, and I'm holding you to it.
Wave at neal, jim.<eos> And don't think you can borrow her phone and call for help.<eos> Be a sweetheart.<eos> Help the lady out.<eos> I'll get your information, okay?<eos> But will I get it in two minutes?<eos> You're putting me on a clock?<eos> Look, I can convince her.<eos> I just need some time.<eos> You don't have it.
I have an address.<eos> It's weird, right?<eos> Lily so does not seem like she's in therapy.<eos> And you so should be.<eos> But as much as I admire the attempt to lure me back With subversive sleuthing, And appreciative as I am of your help with columbia,<eos> The answer's no. Blair, I need to find out Why someone doesn't want lily getting better.<eos> A heartfelt plea as well.<eos> And much more effective than a fatwa.<eos> But you obviously already know that I have a date today.<eos> And nothing you can dangle will make me miss it.
He's never seen it before.<eos> Because it ain't mine.<eos> Does he want Brooks dead?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is he dangerous?<eos> You bet?<eos> All right, so then he's delusional.<eos> He thinks he's got a special relationship with the governor.<eos> The gun's a throwaway.<eos> It's not that hard to file numbers off a handgun, and anybody could have just planted it near Corey the day of the shooting.
It's something weird.<eos> I--<eos> My name is Nick!<eos> Okay, well, "nick, " we're in a meeting.<eos> Okay, look, I get it, people.<eos> I'm the lame I.T. Guy, and everybody hates me.<eos> Hey, listen, man, you can't take it personally.<eos> You called me "man"?<eos> I just said my name just now.<eos> Did you forget it already?
All right, you guys, I've got a few porn scenarios for you to choose from<eos> Hey everybody.<eos> Got a pizza delivery for this sorority house.<eos> Did somebody order sausage?<eos> Peter, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Knock it off.<eos> We brought you some wine.<eos> But it's best chilled before dinner.<eos> Oh, that is so nice of you.<eos> Yeah, let's put it on ice.
Huh, I never thought of it like that.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're not serious.<eos> That's totally unethical.<eos> Yeah, Brian, no one cares what you think.<eos> Peter, you could make him your slave!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> He'd hate that even more than he hates sitcom two-parters.<eos> Tootie, it's 8:29!<eos> Now either try that beer or dump it down the sink!
Blessed art thou amongst women... blessed art thou amongst women...<eos> Blessed is the fruit of thy womb, jesus. Blessed is the fruit of thy wb, jesus.<eos> Holy mary, mother of god... holy mary, mother of god...<eos> Pray for us sinners... pray for us sinners...<eos> Now... now...<eos> And at the hour of our death. And at the hour of our death.<eos> Amen. Amen.<eos> You make sure lisa gets my ring, all right?<eos> Don't give up, dan.<eos> Don't--Don't use it to propose to altman or something.
Give me a kiss for the day.<eos> Mary qu'y at-il?<eos> I can not betray you, Fermín.<eos> This is Hugo ... he told me he knows that I support you.<eos> He promised to heal Iván forever ... if I help him find a Saúl.<eos> We need to find these drugs.<eos> If they wanted to cause a pandemic, is that they have plenty in stock.<eos> They offered Maria a cure for his son.<eos> Final?<eos> If there is, we must find it.
- Grey, get an OR.<eos> We're going now.<eos> I've done this 300 times, and it's still not working.<eos> I went to Eugenia.<eos> She held up two postage stamps and asked me if I was looking for the 44 cent or the three.<eos> You don't have to tell me which you picked.<eos> I left!<eos> Let me tell you something about my surgical field.<eos> I prep my surgical field with soap and water.<eos> I keep my surgical field the way God made it.
Hey.<eos> NCIS, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> You guys making any headway?<eos> Well, as a matter of fact, we wanted to ask you a few questions.<eos> Sure.<eos> Whatever I can do.<eos> Well, according to, uh, ATF records, you have a permit to carry a .45.<eos> Can we see your weapon?<eos> I... I haven't carried it in years.

I haven't carried it in years.<eos> I, uh, I sold it at a gun show.
'cause I was already in Alabama and Jacques was getting out of town with his cousin, But we forgot the meat in the freezer, so...<eos> So I called Daymo because I knew he hadn't left. And I asked if he could go by the restaurant And take the meat to a shelter or give it away.<eos> - And he say, "no problem."<eos> - He had a key?<eos> We kept one in the false brick front Outside the kitchen entrance for emergencies.<eos> And the hurricane was an emergency, so...<eos> And the meat?<eos> Rancid as anything when we got back.<eos> I had to replace the walk-in.<eos> The door key was where we left it.
Energy Plus.<eos> That means not only am I washing away the filth and the fluids that people get on your hotel sheets,<eos> I'm also on the front line of the fight against global warming.<eos> What was that?<eos> Foreign object in the wash barrel.<eos> It happens.<eos> It looks gooey.<eos> Won't it gum up your machine?<eos> Whatever it is, this baby can handle it.<eos> Okay, so the only way the body could have gotten down here is if someone threw it down the laundry chute.
So lena asked me to speak about reinvention today, Which is a theme in my next play.<eos> It was like he was talking directly to me-- Everything he was saying about reinventing yourself, Your look, your life.<eos> Mm, that's very interesting.<eos> I mean, that's everything I've been doing this year--<eos> -My new look, my new job.<eos> -You don't say?<eos> Hilda, stop.<eos> I see your engagement ring, okay?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Good, because I'm practicing how to show it off Without looking like I'm showing it off.
Which was get back at Amy and me.<eos> But it just wasn't that there was ulterior motive.<eos> It wasn't just sex for the sake of getting back at Amy and you.<eos> Jeez, Ben, yes it was.<eos> You might not have been thinking that far ahead, but I'm sure Adrian was.<eos> Come on, you were, too.<eos> All right, all right, it's just that I've tried to justify it a dozen different ways, and I guess there is no justification.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> I accept your apology.<eos> No, that wasn't an apology, and even if it was, why would you accept it?
- R-double-o-s.<eos> - Too much television.<eos> "Bobby says he knows that he doesn't deserve" A heath Kit radio because of what happened With leaving the freezer open in the garage<eos> But maybe Santa could choose from a bicycle, a better pellet gun, A clock radio, a transistor radio, "A drum set and a bicycle."<eos> I left that freezer open.<eos> "baby gene wants a fireman.<eos> I don't know what that means."<eos> Adorable.<eos> "and I would like the gold necklace" That you can put your initials on that we saw at Macy's.<eos> And most of all, I'd like you to be here on Christmas morning "To give it to me, but I know you can't be."
deli and Chinese...<eos> And some kind of gift for Mr. Garner.<eos> You're off-limits.<eos> I don't think he's the one who needs to be reminded.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> He was all over you the time you wore that red dress... The one with the bow in the back that makes you look like a present.<eos> - You have an incredible memory.<eos> - Yeah, I think about it a lot...<eos> That dress, I mean.<eos> - Could you wear it?
Okay, I-I -<eos> - I'd really like to go home now.<eos> We'll miss the meteor shower.<eos> The trouble is your clothes.<eos> Just take them off.<eos> I think there's a blanket in the trunk.<eos> You sure, dad?<eos> You're -- you're not worried I might stink up the blanket?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We just use it to cover up the seat For when manny's all sweaty after his tango class.
I guess I just always feel like I-I blow it with you, gloria.<eos> Whether it's the colombian comment Or picking the wrong restaurant --<eos> The restaurant?<eos> That had nothing to do with you.<eos> I was just not in the mood to go anywhere that fancy After the stupid thing I did this morning.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I bought a dress.<eos> You monster.<eos> It was a very expensive dress that I don't need.<eos> I felt so stupid that when I got home, I couldn't even bring it inside the house.

What we might be dealing with in the future.<eos> So you woke all three of them up?<eos> Actually, five.<eos> We've tracked down some others.<eos> Okay.<eos> About six weeks ago,<eos> Massive dynamic proposed<eos> A series of experiments To help them gain control of and repurpose their abilities.<eos> These three have been quite successful.<eos> James heath can now cure disease, Not cause it.
I will go.<eos> No, my darling. No.<eos> This is your home.<eos> EMMA: What are you doing out here at this time, Queenie?<eos> I might ask you the same question.<eos> Robert is turning in his bed like a two-year-old.<eos> I know I did the right thing, selling that chair.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But still I doubt myself.<eos> When that tallyman comes by again, I shall buy it back from him.
Well. Nor is it.<eos> Put an end to her meddling.<eos> I am your president and I say get rid of her.<eos> Will that not be awkward?<eos> I gather she's planning to stay in the village for the foreseeable future.<eos> No one can foresee the future, Doctor.<eos> Not you, not I, and certainly not Mrs Crawley.<eos> You do not love the place yet?<eos> - Well, obviously it's...<eos> - No, you don't love it.
I just wish it was a treatment I was more familiar with.<eos> Will that serve as your excuse when he dies?<eos> Nurse.<eos> Can you prepare Mr Drake for his procedure, please?<eos> Well, Mrs Crawley,<eos> I have a feeling we will sink or swim together.<eos> Mr Drake, your heart is not functioning properly, and, as a result, your pericardial sac is full of fluid.<eos> I am proposing first to withdraw the fluid and then to inject the adrenaline to stimulate the heart and restore normal activity.<eos> Is it dangerous, Doctor?<eos> The draining may stop the heart, and the adrenaline may not be able to restart it.
Forget all that. For 10 years, at least.<eos> You're a kind woman, Mrs Hughes.<eos> I don't know how this house would run without you.<eos> I don't, truly.<eos> Stop flannelling and get on, before I betray you to Mr Carson.<eos> Oh, is there anything more thrilling than a new frock?<eos> I suppose not, my lady.<eos> You shall have one, too.<eos> I thought this would be suitable for your interview.<eos> - I won't be wearing it, my lady.

- Certainly not.<eos> - Is the remove ready to go up?<eos> Here we are.<eos> Daisy, give him a hand with the vegetables.<eos> They're up in the servery, in the warmer.<eos> Well, I'm glad I don't have to eat them.<eos> What the eye can't see, the heart won't grieve over.<eos> Hmm, there's no doubt about it.<eos> The next few years in farming are going to be about mechanisation.<eos> That's the test, and we're going to have to meet it.
If you want a lift, I can take one of you, but not more.<eos> - One of the women.<eos> - No, you must go.<eos> - Then we can all hurry and meet you there.<eos> - Yes, you're right.<eos> I mustn't slow you down.<eos> There's been too much of that already.<eos> Have you recovered from our ordeal?<eos> I got a letter this morning.<eos> They must have written it as soon as I left the office.
I fuckin' love you, Libby Croker!<eos> The first date I had with Paddy, I was wearin' this little black dress.<eos> I looked great.<eos> He knew it and I knew it.<eos> What're you gonna tell the other two?<eos> They're used to you disappearing'... and me just bein' around.<eos> Wore that dress again for our first anniversary.<eos> Couldn't get into it for the second.<eos> Or third.<eos> I didn't chuck it out, though.

We're taking the long way around.<eos> MacPherson will expect us to take the most direct route.<eos> How'd we beat Pete and Myka back?<eos> Something to do with the destruction of historical landmarks-- I spoke to Scotland Yard.<eos> Anyway, you left the packet out for them, right?<eos> On your desk.<eos> Why do MacPherson and Wells need the vest?<eos> Because the Escher vault is a maze of stairs and walkways, constantly rapidly moving.<eos> If you don't have a way to navigate it, you'd be lost in there for a lifetime.<eos> Now, if Wells can figure out a way to make the vest operational, she can move quickly enough to get right through it.
Whoo! Let's go, girls!<eos> Oh, can we do that in public?<eos> - Here you are.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... I got you a little gift, too.<eos> To prove how well I know you.<eos> You did not have to do that.<eos> I know I didn't have to.<eos> Because I wanted to see your face... when you opened it up. Ooh... - Ooh, wow.
I'd be happy to lend my expertise.<eos> So...<eos> I know you're not turning me loose.<eos> Just a furlough..<eos> We got something we want you to see<eos> ♪ Swallowed whole in negatives ♪ you did it, bro.<eos> ♪ feel the air ♪ and the best news is... You're free to go.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, Finch acted alone.<eos> It's my case.<eos> I'm closing it.
They'll manipulate you.<eos> They'll use you in ways you can't imagine.<eos> You'll know things, but you won't be able to tell anyone.<eos> You'll be in constant danger.<eos> You'll betray your friends, and there may come a time when they ask you to do something which goes against everything you believe in and care about.<eos> And you're gonna have to do it to win their trust and stay on the inside.<eos> Do you think you're capable of doing what you have to do?<eos> So they have the ring.<eos> It's been on Mark's board since Utah.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to get it back.
Right.<eos> So done after death.<eos> And her clothes?<eos> I'd say more his choice than hers.<eos> Waiting on toxicology, But it's rather remarkable.<eos> Raped and sodomized, but no semen, blood or anything That might give dna.<eos> Every surface, every orifice scrubbed and flushed.<eos> All cleaning done post-mortem.<eos> Mm-hmm. Found traces of a medicinal cleanser Called novacell.<eos> Yeah, I used it on my daughter when she was little For cuts and scrapes.
Jurors could look at her and see innocence.<eos> I want loaded dice.<eos> Maya gets a deal, damon goes away, Everyone's happy.<eos> But that's not your call, counselor.<eos> I'm not saying it won't end up there, But the case is still ours.<eos> You really want to take a stand on that attitude?<eos> On basic procedure?<eos> You bet I do.<eos> What matters are the rules, Which haven't changed since you sweated exams At law school.<eos> Now when the case is suitable for prosecution, You'll get it, not before.
And you have my blessing.<eos> I'm happy for you to take John on the weekends.<eos> It's good for John and for Amy.<eos> So go forth, young man, and ask Amy.<eos> I did.<eos> She said no.<eos> Well, then the answer's no.<eos> I rescind my blessing.<eos> What?<eos> I take it back.

Do you need that in Albanian, or what?<eos> Shit, they're splitting now.<eos> Alex, Tintin, follow the BMW.<eos> We'll take care of the Cayenne.<eos> Nounours, follow us.<eos> - All right.<eos> - We copy.<eos> No problem, Laure.<eos> That photo was on Dylan's mobile phone.<eos> He claims he took it after sleeping with you.
- Thank you.<eos> Judge, I won't pretend that over the course of my career I haven't had many opportunities to remove a judge from a case.<eos> Know that doing so doesn't give me any happiness.<eos> If you're not happy, ma'am, don't do it.<eos> Unfortunately, I'm afraid the reasons your brother's lawyer put forward totally justify the petition for legitimate suspicion.<eos> Ever since the investigation began, my brother has been trying to have me taken off the case.<eos> In that case, you should have asked to be taken off the case yourself.<eos> You know as well as I that impartiality is essential for a case to go smoothly.<eos> It's because I went beyond the call of duty that this case came about, ma'am.<eos> The investigation doesn't stop, Judge, you just pass it on.

Couldn't you tell it was a trap?<eos> Who are you protecting?<eos> For me, it never works out with girls.<eos> But you're good-looking, don't they come running after you?<eos> Why are you doing this for me?<eos> If you refuse, in half an hour this video will be in the inbox of all the magistrates.<eos> Once they realise the lady's underage, they'll show no mercy.<eos> The judge will search the mayor's home tomorrow morning.<eos> The documents are in a chest, the key's in the left hand drawer of the writing desk.<eos> The video, will you destroy it?
I think you're a money-grubbing Neanderthal.<eos> And the word on you is, you like cheap women and cheaper booze. That right?<eos> 300 grand, or I go back to the pool.<eos> Fine, 300 grand.<eos> But only if you bring S-11 back alive.<eos> Otherwise, you get nothing.<eos> This is a bad idea, Sands.<eos> We should just 86 that freak before it takes any more lives.<eos> That freak represents a giant leap in genetic engineering.<eos> Damage it, and head will roll, Mr. Flynn.
I mean, considering that she is one.<eos> Isobel and I share a mutual interest.<eos> The originalJohnathan Gilbert had an invention That was stolen by a vampire.<eos> That vampire was then burned alive In fell's church, or soJohnathan thought.<eos> And the invention was lost forever.<eos> Hmm. But then the vampires weren't killed, were they?<eos> They were trapped.<eos> And now they're free, thanks to you, Which means the invention is retrievable.<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> The only thing that matters is that I want it back,

We cannot outmanoeuvre him.<eos> He holds all of the cards.<eos> So, we must outwit him.<eos> Miss Lane!<eos> Surely there is a missive from my sister today?<eos> I'm sorry, Miss Pratt, still nothing for you.<eos> Then I am correct in thinking that my sister has forgotten me.<eos> But of course I can expect no sympathy here, however grave my predicament.<eos> Daniel, I wanted to thank you for the consideration you've shown towards the post office.<eos> This Mr Blakestone... the power he has and how he intends to use it, I can't bear the injustice of it.
Yeah.<eos> I can't believe we lucked out with this place.<eos> I can't believe the kts lucked into this place.<eos> Hey.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> This is my boss's house.<eos> Uh, I think there's been a misunderstanding.<eos> No, freakin' kidding!<eos> This is our house, actually.<eos> We rented it for the week.

- What are you talking about?<eos> - I'm the someone you don't know.<eos> But you should.<eos> Um, I'm graduating from CRU in about a month.<eos> I've interview for jobs ranging from the assistant to the regional manager of blah, blah, blah to the junior exec to the head of "Who Cares."<eos> I don't love any of that.<eos> So I started to accept that I was gonna get a job I didn't love because that's what people do, right?<eos> Until I met you.<eos> Look at this dress.<eos> I made it out of a couple of really old T-shirts and dresses I had, because, one, I'm in college and poor, and, two, I didn't want to throw them out and have them sit in a landfill.
It's not a good day to push me.<eos> Then I'll push you tomorrow.<eos> How's that?<eos> Look what I found.<eos> What-<eos> - Is that your wedding dress?<eos> Surprised I wore white?<eos> Your dad was, too.<eos> No, I'm just surprised that you have your wedding dress hanging in your closet.<eos> Well, I recently had occasion to wear it again.
You going to be okay here by yourself?<eos> Could Griffin come over and stay or something?<eos> Yeah, or something.<eos> You go.<eos> Hi, Grant.<eos> What's taking so long?<eos> Your mother's wedding dress.<eos> Oh. Then she should take as long as she likes, because when my mother sees a picture of my bride in that dress, she's gonna be thrilled.<eos> Have you seen the dress?<eos> Well, I didn't wanna see it before the wedding.
No news.<eos> Um, OK, I'm going to need a brief precis of what you've got.<eos> Soon as you like.<eos> Well, as soon as there's time, I will explain.<eos> We may have found the gun.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> I got that.<eos> Got it.<eos> It's a 9mm Beretta.<eos> Pass it to me and I'll clear the chamber.
And then what we'll do is, We'll measure the downdraft created by a helicopter, And that will transfer into a weight<eos> Perfect.<eos> Let's no.Hover around here anymore.<eos> So, to get a head-start on the myth of the chopper climb... this-a how we make-a the grant-a head.<eos> ...Tory once again makes a new head for grant.<eos> "hey, he's got a robot!"<eos> That's enough out of you.<eos> So, what I have here is grant's head and shoulders.<eos> This is gonna give us the same surface area As somebody holding on to the helicopter's skid.<eos> Now, I have attached grant to this scale, So that way if there's any change in the downforce, We'll be able to measure it.
And the office he had went to the guy who replaced him.<eos> You know, I've been trying to speak to pope About where I should go, but he seems distracted.<eos> Oh, well, you're welcome to camp out with us for a bit If you need to, commander.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I, uh... I might take you up on that.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> Um, I'll put these upstairs.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Boy, the media just can't get enough of the new building.<eos> I hate it.
Chief?<eos> Yes?<eos> Ballistics says the murder weapon Could have been fired from the walkers' house.<eos> I have our search warrant.<eos> Please don't tear up everything we just had built.<eos> It cost a fortune.<eos> Chief, look at this path.<eos> Someone wiped away their tracks.<eos> Think this rifle mount might help?<eos> Found it next to the water cooler.
If someone had been given this assignment after the first incident, they'd have been sitting there now for two years.<eos> Chief, the shrink who performed Mason's last evaluation is in interview 2.<eos> Mind if I join you?<eos> Of course.<eos> It's right this way.<eos> Do me a favor, will you, huh? Explain why it's been three days and I still don't have my damn wheelchair!<eos> You have a wheelchair, Russ.<eos> It works just fine.<eos> I want my electric wheelchair!<eos> And if you're not gonna give it back, I'll do something about it.
And even though our robbers were wearing motorcycle helmets, no one actually saw a motorcycle leave the scene.<eos> Okay, so all the victims of these robberies --<eos> "victims"?<eos> !<eos> Don't you mean "drug dealers"?<eos> Lieutenant, these dispensaries are considered legal by the state.<eos> We are sworn to protect them.<eos> Bull.<eos> Hey. What happened to our cold case?<eos> Uh, Chief Delk put it back in the freezer.
And he had no rap sheet up until today.<eos> He's been unemployed for 18 months, but before that, he worked as a prop master, so he'd have access to dozens of different guns through different armories serving the film industry.<eos> The other two guys with the fake guns are unemployed stunt men --<eos> Greg Lapham and Lou Wilson.<eos> Between the two of them, a couple BE's And an assault.<eos> Look.<eos> They've been mirandized.<eos> We have enough evidence to book them all for murder.<eos> Yeah, but not to make it stick.<eos> One of them had a real gun yesterday, and I need to find it.
See what happens.<eos> I can make this place safer than you can.<eos> Who gave you the right to play God?<eos> The position was vacant.<eos> So I took it.<eos> Now...<eos> I've done my end of the bargain.<eos> I've... Fully confessed.<eos> Will Mary Witten get her heart?<eos> Or will you keep it... as evidence?
These men in beige gloves are hunting a lethal force.<eos> HELICOPTER WHIRS A force that's present all over the world, but completely invisible.<eos> To find it, they're doing something of quite awe-inspiring danger, and I don't just mean riding on the outside of a helicopter.<eos> They're about to fly within inches of a power line carrying half a million volts.<eos> Adrenaline rush at times, yes.<eos> There are certain situations you can get into that are very, very hairy.<eos> This might seem like insane showing off, but they're doing it for a reason.<eos> These power lines carry a massive and potentially lethal danger.<eos> There is an invisible force field.<eos> You cannot see it, but if you get close enough, yes, you can touch and, you know, you can feel the electricity around it.
And you may be wondering how we got a match to you in our database.<eos> You got a bunch of priors for violent assault.<eos> Is that your thing?<eos> Huh? You like beating people up?<eos> That's your MO?<eos> Except, this time, you killed a man.<eos> That's a bunch of crap.<eos> You guys got this whole thing sideways.<eos> No, no. What we got is your blood on a cracked mirror at a murder scene.<eos> Yeah, 'cause I hit it.
With my mout--<eos> Not with my eyes.<eos> "I see the great realtor margaret wilson is here, "looking more curvaceous than ever.<eos> Talk about your balloon payments."<eos> Gloria, do we have to keep This colombia/brazil soccer game?<eos> Yes, I haven't seen it yet.<eos> It's been sitting in there for five months.<eos> I mean, I can tell you who wins.<eos> And what about this two-hour "antiques roadshow"?<eos> I'll watch it today.

Yeah, you learn something new every day, huh?<eos> I've never seen a baby monster before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course, it's not really a monster.<eos> I mean, it's still just a baby.<eos> It's not its fault its dad's a shifter.<eos> Right, but it's a shifter, too.<eos> It still doesn't change the fact that we've got to... we've got to look after this thing.<eos> But what the hell are we gonna do with it?<eos> We can't actually drop it off at an orphanage.
- Just hang on.<eos> I got to take this.<eos> It's important.<eos> More important than Sam?<eos> Bobby?<eos> Rufus?<eos> The good news is I snagged the ring, Bobby. However...<eos> - Tell me that ain't... - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Three guesses, and one of 'em... it ain't the paramedics.<eos> - Listen, Bobby, I-I got to stash this ring. - But don't swallow it.

- Special wires.<eos> Yeah.<eos> If you shake a plant, it doesn't like it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Right?<eos> So what happened was<eos> He said, "right, what we'll do<eos> Is we'll put the plant back on the shelf."<eos> - Stephen: Yep.<eos> - Karl: "we'll water it. We'll calm it down.
No, this is the problem, 'cause the council won't take anything.<eos> - People are going, "what can we do with this?<eos> "oh yeah,<eos> Why not just-- I'll tell you what.<eos> Just sneak up Everest.<eos> It'll take you nine days And you may die, But just pop it up on Everest."<eos> Well, I know for a fact that you've confused-- You've confused a few things there, Because I think the piano being found<eos> Some kind of moor in Scotland-- and they found a piano up there.<eos> And everyone said, "how's a piano doing up here?" And it turned out that some guy--<eos> One of these people who tries to break world records-- Had dragged a piano up there as some kind of feat of endurance But thought, "I'll be damned if I'm gonna take it back again,"
But there's you every day winding that stupid watch.<eos> Time-- it's important to keep track, isn't it?<eos> The days at least.<eos> Don't you think, Andrea?<eos> Back me up here.<eos> I like-<eos> - I like what, um, a father said to son when he gave him a watch that had been handed down through generations.<eos> He said,<eos> "l give you the mausoleum of all hope and desire, which will fit your individual needs no better than it did mine or my father's before me;<eos> I give it to you not that you may remember time, but that you may forget it for a moment now and then and not spend all of your breath trying to conquer it."
Well, as a matter of fact, yeah, I met a few women, and by "a few" I mean more than two.<eos> I was completely faithful, but I don't blame you for seeking comfort in the arms of others.<eos> Blame me?<eos> You looked me in the eye and told me that your career would always come first.<eos> I was emulating my mentor, Dr. Brennan, and she was wrong.<eos> Which means I was wrong, too.<eos> I was led astray by my brain.<eos> Well, I need some time to think.<eos> Then you keep the ring.<eos> You want us to be engaged, you just give it back.
Hey, uh, Booth, can I ask you a personal question?<eos> Oh, that depends-- about you or me?<eos> Me.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Okay, Daisy just wants to pick up where we left off, and I don't know whether to...<eos> Move on. Yeah?<eos> Like you did?<eos> You know what?<eos> You asked my opinion, right?<eos> I'm going to give it to you.
Yes, I do.<eos> Deduce!<eos> Amazing!<eos> [Coughs]<eos> [Booth] Listen, why don't you want to do a kids' show?<eos> - It's a waste of my time.<eos> - It's a science show.<eos> Kids' science.<eos> Parker loves that show.<eos> He's always watching it.
Okay.<eos> Well, there were needles from the red spruce... which means that he was at an altitude higher than 4,300 feet.<eos> And the leg from a rare bug called the emerald ash borer.<eos> How rare is that?<eos> Rare enough that, when it's combined with altitude... and a not-so-secret barbecue sauce... made by Ollie's B-B-Q in western Virginia... you're left with a half-mile stretch off the 250 highway... where the victim had to be shortly before being killed.<eos> - That's very good work, Angela.<eos> Thank you. - [Beeps]<eos> Yeah.<eos> - You're going to need Tutti for this one.<eos> If there's a dead body out here, Tutti will find it.
- Now who's psychic? When Braverman rolled off the car, he landed flat-footed.<eos> From that height, and the speed he was going... he must have dislocated his femoral head from his acetabular.<eos> No, it couldn't be that bad.<eos> He's been running ever since. Once he's in the car and immobile... his adrenaline will wear off, and the pain will become unbearable.<eos> He'll need drugs and medical care.<eos> - You don't think he'd be stupid enough to go to a hospital?<eos> - He won't have a choice. I'll contact all the hospitals and the urgent care facilities along the route.<eos> Nothing?<eos> You've found nothing?<eos> We have tried everything we could think of. The problem is, projectiles either bounce off the rib... crack it or fragment it into several pieces.
They're sending someone over.<eos> Okay, notify the D.A. Maybe they can cut us a deal and help us figure out what was really going on.<eos> I know that look.<eos> What look?<eos> That "something doesn't add up" look.<eos> It's just the lab report on the murder weapon.<eos> What about it?<eos> They didn't find any fingerprints.<eos> He probably wiped it down.<eos> Why would he wipe it down if he was gonna hang on to it?
But I... I will only accept this if you all share it with me.<eos> Twist my arm.<eos> Not here.<eos> Um, at the Old Haunt.<eos> We will toast to Donny with his family.<eos> Yeah, well, what ab... What about that place?<eos> What happens to the Od Haunt?<eos> It's gonna go back to the bank, which means that T.J. McChucklenuts is gonna get another shot at it.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't worry about the Old Haunt.<eos> You bought it, didn't you?
Okay, go on. Refute me.<eos> Okay, how about this?<eos> Vivien is dialing her daughter's number.<eos> Our killer comes in, stabs her in the neck, picks up the phone, drops it into the sofa after her, and then puts the numbers into the letter along with the rest of the fake predictions.<eos> Refuted.<eos> No one types a number into a cell phone anymore.<eos> Preliminaries on the letter aren't giving us much.<eos> There are no usable prints and no D.N.A.<eos> And the pick up at the mail drop in Vivien's building is 6:00 P.M.<eos> Time enough for the killer to have written it and mailed it after she was dead.
No, that can't be.<eos> It is. Look.<eos> Same sideburns...<eos> And there's his snake tattoo.<eos> Well, then he slipped out the back and went to Kim's.<eos> How would he get from 101st to Midtown and change clothes in...<eos> Four minutes?<eos> I don't know, but he did it.<eos> Can we enhance this video?<eos> You can enhance it all you want.
So if lightbulbs didn't get Lenny killed, then what did?<eos> You know, it can't be a coincidence that he was killed right there at about the same time that he has written down.<eos> And what does "B.H.S." stand for?<eos> Bronx high school?<eos> Hmm.<eos> Big honkin' stereo?<eos> Boys have shoes?<eos> Try Byron H. Singer.<eos> I found a small vendor decal on the side of the parabolic microphone we found in his apartment, so I called the vendor to find out if he knew why Len bought the equipment.<eos> Turns out, Len didn't buy it at all.
Yes.<eos> Hi, dad.<eos> I know you're worried, but I'm okay.<eos> They say if you do what they ask, everything will be fine.<eos> Just don't go to the police.<eos> I'll see you soon, and don't forget to feed Ace.<eos> There are no identifying markers in the background.<eos> It's all black.<eos> I don't know if we're gonna find him in time.<eos> The video was taken at 1:31 A.M. But they didn't send it till 1:39.
I-I tried to find out what, but she was in a hurry to get somewhere, so I left.<eos> I went home.<eos> I-I was there by 8:00.<eos> Make yourself at home.<eos> You're gonna be here for a while.<eos> C.S.U. is going through the altitude chamber.<eos> Once they get back with forensics, we should be able to charge Ted Carter.<eos> Tell me this...<eos> How did Carter get the body to the rail yard?<eos> Well, the altitude chamber is right next to the parking garage, so he probably dumped her body in the car, took it out to the rail yard, and tried to throw us off the trail.
I'd like my payment in small bills, please.<eos> My contact at Justice says no warrant was issued for Marie's office.<eos> Well, then people claiming to be federal agents seized her property.<eos> I mean, there's gotta be an explanation.<eos> Men in black.<eos> Other than that.<eos> I'll put out more feelers.<eos> Meantime, keep me posted.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Marie found proof, and they covered it up.
Wait.<eos> Why wouldn't you just tell ellie<eos> That you went to the petting zoo with me?<eos> Right, so she can picture us lying down With all the tiny, beautiful animals Crawling all over our naked bodies.<eos> That's gross in, like, a million different ways.<eos> Hey! It's goose guy. Huh?<eos> Eh, eh, eh, eh... aah!<eos> Okay, great. What's going on?<eos> Our video is so popular.<eos> Someone even sent it to me... From korea!
I'm just gonna spin around and say the first thing I see.<eos> Loaded flare gun on a jar full of gasoline.<eos> Well, that's for when the rats come.<eos> Look, don't tell anybody about this, okay?<eos> I promise.<eos> Oh. Doctor said that's gonna happen For the next few months.<eos> Every year, when I win the Jules gift contest, I go out and buy myself a chunky ring.<eos> I usually don't wear them all at once, but...<eos> What?<eos> I don't have one yet, But I'm getting it this year.
Ppfft.<eos> I promise, though, one way or another, good will come to us.<eos> I'll get to marry you all over again.<eos> Hee hee!<eos> Barf.<eos> I married a care bear.<eos> He can't be defeated.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Just give him his ring back.<eos> I gave it to you.
You know, the food's gonna be ready in about an hour.<eos> Do you think there's any chance that you might make it over if I stall for a while?<eos> You mean, like, a month?<eos> Oh, baby.<eos> Ow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Ah, big Carl.<eos> You can almost fix everything.<eos> I can't believe you lost the ring!<eos> It's your fault for giving it to me, lady!
Guys, the romantic Thanksgiving is over.<eos> If you wanna change clothes, go ahead.<eos> I am much more comfortable like this.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't like that.<eos> Andy, we need to apologize for something.<eos> And you know how apologizing makes me resent our love, so even though I look away and act like I don't care, know that I feel really, really bad.<eos> Laurie, go.<eos> You were so annoying with all your positive reggae stuff that we took your ring.<eos> And then we lost it.
I-I can't wait to find out what it is.<eos> Can you?<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> I take back my awesome apology!<eos> Too late.<eos> Thank you for loving me so much.<eos> Do you have an app that shows you how to murder your husband without getting caught?<eos> I do.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I just have to find it.

It's Wham!<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> Um...<eos> I'm going to look down this row of Frasier firs. Maybe you could check out the Douglases and I'll meet you at the end.<eos> Okay.<eos> (Wham!<eos> 's "Last Christmas" playing)<eos> ♪ Last Christmas I gave you my heart, ♪<eos> ♪ but the very next day, you gave it away. ♪

Wait, I thought I was the only one getting the solos from now on.<eos> Next week, I'm going to be performing a musical number by Kesha.<eos> (Paramore's "You Are The Only Exception" playing)<eos> ♪ When I was younger ♪<eos> ♪ I saw my daddy cry ♪ ♪ And curse at the wind ♪<eos> ♪ He broke his own heart as I watched ♪<eos> ♪ As he tried to reassemble it ♪
If you did, you wouldn't have taken my job so easily.<eos> Guys, you want to take five?<eos> Okay, you want to have this conversation, let's have it.<eos> You're a substitute...<eos> Of course you can... Paint murals and let the kids sing whatever they want.<eos> You're never around when they have to deal with the hangover of all that fun.<eos> 16% of all high school students dropped out last year.<eos> We can't just expect them to sit up and pay attention.<eos> These kids feel special.<eos> They have a voice, and if we don't listen to it, they just tune us out. I give my kids a voice. I just don't let it run free.
Do the girls come here as -- as babies?<eos> Unfortunately, tragedy strikes as it pleases.<eos> They come at any age.<eos> It must be difficult to find the older ones permanent homes.<eos> Well, the truth is, by the time I get my hands on the lost souls,<eos> They no longer have that cute baby scent childless couples yearn for.<eos> The children don't spend their entire childhoods here, do they?<eos> Mercy me.<eos> You make it sound like punishment.<eos> I've been training my girls for decades not to blend into society but to conquer it --
She's preparing.<eos> Soon, a great Fury will consume this world, and no one will be able to stop us.<eos> Harriet!<eos> I told you to look after our lost lamb... not slaughter him.<eos> Take your sisters to their rooms while I bring peace to our visitor.<eos> I don't care how powerful you are.<eos> I won't let you ruin any more lives.<eos> You are in no position to stop me.<eos> Once I bury your memories, you'll see life can be so much better without a painful past.<eos> Move it or lose it, sister.
What are you talking about?<eos> That soil report is bullshit.<eos> Someone made the numbers up.<eos> Or put the chemicals there for the test.<eos> There's no cancer in the ground.<eos> Aren't we going home?<eos> Not yet.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> I'll tell you in a second.<eos> They were bringing shit in, not taking it out.
Very much.<eos> Doesn't have to be Asian.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll meet a girl someday.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Yes, you will, and she'll be beautiful.<eos> And kind and sexy and funny and everything you ever wanted in a woman.<eos> You really think so?<eos> I do, and you'll fall hopelessly in love and give her your heart.<eos> And she'll take it and grind it into pathetic, little pieces.
What?<eos> You don't want a Christmas tree?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Next you won't want a Christmas ham.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I love meat and I always will.<eos> Mm-mm! That is some sweet pig meat.<eos> But as for Christmas trees, I used to love them, until last year...<eos> This tree reminds me of your father.<eos> It's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it.
See?<eos> Every time we get a tree, Mom disappears.<eos> Why couldn't it have been me?<eos> It still could be.<eos> You just have to go down to the recruiting station and--<eos> Shut up.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> This is where they took Mom from me.<eos> I've been waiting for you.<eos> Your mom paid for this tree last year, but never took it.

Dad, you are leadi. g the way in clean energy.<eos> Yup, I Al-Gored it pretty good.<eos> Where's my Grammy for audio book narration?<eos> It's making our meter run backwards!<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> It means we're traveling back in time!<eos> I can warn President Lincoln to dump his wife before she goes crazy!<eos> Dad, all it means is, we're providing power to the electric company.<eos> Oh, that's just great.<eos> I discover electricity, and they want to take it from me!
Wait a minute.<eos> You look familiar.<eos> Yeah, you almost ate me once. I was in your mouth for five minutes.<eos> Leela?<eos> And the winner is...<eos> Whoo!<eos> I got fruit boobs! What's the use?<eos> Now what?<eos> I send you out to conquer a planet, and all you bring back is J.J. Abrams' face?<eos> I thought you'd like it.
I'm getting reports that cities across the globe are being destroyed by this noble invader, whose good looks are apparently discernible across vast distances and through solid metal.<eos> But wait, the leader of the attack is swaggering out of his ship and up to a convenient nearby microphone.<eos> Now, why couldn't I have just described his appearance at this point?<eos> This is the type of thing I'm talking about.<eos> People of earth, I am Lrrr, conqueror of your planet.<eos> Cue screams.<eos> You will now remove your skulls and play dodgeball with them for my amusement.<eos> Ooh... I could swear his horns have gotten longer.<eos> Sir, I've intercepted an earth broadcast.<eos> Put it up on the zenith.
Darth Stroyer?<eos> That's the stupidest name I've ever heard.<eos> Let's hear the rest.<eos> Darth Trocious.<eos> Darth Sploder.<eos> Darth Urderer.<eos> Darth It-head.<eos> Company, attack! Don't fire till you see the greens of their eyes.<eos> It saves on bullets.<eos> I shall rip out your heart and show it to you.
Then you have proven my case, sir, for no one has found the link between apes and this Homo erectus.<eos> Yes, they have!<eos> It's called Homo habilis.<eos> Aha! But no one has found the missing link between ape and this so-called Homo habilis.<eos> Yes, they have!<eos> It's called Australopithecus africanus!<eos> Oh-ho! I've got you now.<eos> Fair enough, but where then is the missing link between apes and this Darwinius masillae?<eos> Answer me that, Professor!<eos> Okay, granted, that one missing link is still missing, but just because we haven't found it doesn't mean it doesn't exist!
The lubricant of choice is vegetabl oil.<eos> Okay, guys, I'm all oiled up and ready to go.<eos> Ar.You ready?<eos> We're ready.<eos> This should be slick.<eos> Knowing what's coming Won't help brian avoid a potential disaster.<eos> The course is too narrow to skirt around the slick, And he doesn't know where or when<eos> Jamie plans to give him the slip.<eos> And then we see oil pour out of his back, And brian tries to avoid it,<eos> But actually, because jamie does it on a turn, It sort of crosses the whole road, and we can't avoid it.
I was going to marry Paolo.<eos> That's why I gave her the ring.<eos> When Beth's condition worsened-- what am I going to do, put her through a divorce as well?<eos> Yeah, that would be wrong.<eos> Anyway, Paolo got tired of waiting around, so she broke it off.<eos> And now she won't see me, she won't talk to me.<eos> She won't give you the ring back.<eos> Exactly.<eos> There's an extra grand in it for you guys if you can resolve this thing discreetly.<eos> Get the ring back from Paolo, we make up some kind of story about where you found it, and Beth can have some sort of peace about this.
How you say you find me?<eos> - Uh, the recommendation of a friend...<eos> - Cabron, your friend!<eos> Dale sent you didn't he?<eos> ! You know what, you can tell that hijo de puta that he can eat shit!<eos> And I sold his crappy ring already, okay?<eos> - Okay, but my...<eos> - Get out of here!<eos> Well, at least you got a free deep condition.<eos> Yeah, and the name of the person she sold it to.
Do you remember who you sold it to?<eos> Sure.<eos> Regular customer.<eos> Angelo Baldamotti?<eos> That's my name, man.<eos> Don't wear it out.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> That's good, man.<eos> Listen, you got a ring from the Ethiopian mart.<eos> We want to buy it off you.
All right.<eos> What was that?<eos> What happened?<eos> They're doing the sale internally.<eos> - God damn it.<eos> - But they want me to bring a team to LA.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> What do you think about the name the LA Golds?<eos> - I like it.<eos> - I love it!
You know, we were so happy before you came along.<eos> Don't kid yourself. I've always been there.<eos> No, you haven't.<eos> See this?<eos> This was me when I was 11.<eos> I lost a tooth and Mum said I looked like Dracula.<eos> Where were you then?<eos> And this picture.<eos> That's Dad's sister, Annie.<eos> She bought me that dress, and I hated it, but I never told anyone else.
What is that?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> Jafar Khan may be loved by Joint Special Operations Command, but once upon a time, he had another patron saint, the CIA.<eos> It was a messy breakup, so it didn't take much convincing to get Langley to slip me the file they kept on him.<eos> What was Khan doing for the CIA?<eos> Well, from 2002 to 2005, they outsourced interrogations of terror suspects to nations that weren't, well, overly concerned with human rights.<eos> Uh, Pakistan being one of them.<eos> Seems Jafar Khan had a very specific style of questioning.<eos> We've seen those body markings before.<eos> Booth's body was in the exact same condition when we found it.
I didn't realize that you were into design.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I appreciate beauty.<eos> Stop, stop.<eos> We can't... you can't do this.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Ok, so we're sure those Maddens go with the dress?<eos> This sounds totally gay, but if I saw you strutting' it in that dress and kickin' up those heels, I would think about doing you.<eos> - And we love the necklace?<eos> - We adore it.
So how's Amy?<eos> Amy's changed.<eos> I might have to let her go.<eos> Oh, no. Why?<eos> I thought she was a highly evolved creature of pure intellect, like me.<eos> But recent events indicate that she may be a slave to her baser urges.<eos> Like you.<eos> Just going to skip over that insult.<eos> What insult?<eos> Yeah. That's why I'm going to skip over it.
It's made up of the same stuff as our Sun, hydrogen and helium, the most common elements in the universe.<eos> In its thick churning atmosphere, gigantic storms have raged for centuries.<eos> Now, astrologers have said for years that Jupiter influences our lives.<eos> But we now have scientific evidence that this mighty planet does have a significant connection with our own small world.<eos> Now, Jupiter is so different to our planet, you know, a big ball of gas half a billion kilometers away.<eos> It's difficult to see how it could have anything to do with us all.<eos> But despite the fact that astrology is a load of rubbish,<eos> Jupiter can, in fact, have a profound influence on our planet. And it's through a force that, well, surrounds us and penetrates us and binds the galaxy together, gravity.<eos> Gravity is one of the fundamental forces of nature.<eos> It exists between all objects. And the effects of a gravitational field extend way beyond the planet that creates it.
No, I had no treatment you had undergone some treatment, could it not have been that the treatment that you received prior to Dr. Burzynski's treatment was what in fact really cured you?<eos> I'll jump on that, no way, because the recurrence I had was in a brand new spot that had not been involved before so if all the punishment that I went through for the year went out of my system, and after it went out of my system all of the sudden a new tumor comes in<eos> how could that first treatment have helped the subsequent tumor?<eos> Later that day the FDA came-another raid.<eos> More patients documents, more subpoenas...<eos> We were flooded with calls last Friday with people wanting to know how to get a hold of you, they are going to see this story this morning, see that you've been raided by the FDA, and they are going to want to know if you are for real,<eos> or if the concerns of the FDA may have something to do with your treatments and the viability of your treatments.<eos> Let me jump in here, I don't think there's really an issue as I mentioned regarding the safety of the drug, and the FDA isn't contending at this point that the drug doesn't work,<eos> the only issue is that according to the FDA it has not been proven by controlled clinical trials, so at least in terms of safety the FDA isn't saying that it's not safe and the FDA isn't even saying that it doesn't work, alright,<eos> right now they're just contesting, or apparently they're contesting whether Dr. Burzynski himself has been shipping the medicine out of state, which in some respects is quite ridiculous since he has approval to ship the medicine out of state to various cancer institutions around the county, he ships it out of the county to various countries,
And by November of that year, after a decade of failed grand juries, the United States of America's Food and Drug Administration finally manages to indict Dr. Burzynski.<eos> One month into America's criminal trial against Burzynski, America's first patent on Antineoplaston AS2-1 is approved.<eos> A month after America fails in their second trial against Burzynski, their second and third Antineoplaston patents are approved.<eos> Over the course of the next three years, the United States patent office approves all eleven copy-cat patents on Antineoplastons AS2-1 .<eos> And as we know, all of this was being done based on the fact that the United States, which is the National Institutes of Health, together with a pharmaceutical company, which is Elan Pharmaceuticals was tying simply to steal my invention.<eos> That's what they wanted.<eos> It's not that we had successful visit from the National Cancer Institute in which they determined that "this treatment works great"<eos> and they decided that we should go into Phase 2 clinical trials which would be sponsored by them.<eos> No.<eos> This gave the idea of some high-ups at the FDA to conspire with the pharmaceutical company so that they could steal the invention from me and get it, because it was good.
You mean you are not leaving me for him?<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> What am I, blind and noseless?<eos> Hey, hey, I'm right here.<eos> Believe me, I know.<eos> Apu, our marriage will never be easy.<eos> But nothing worth doing is ever easy.<eos> It is true.<eos> The tastiest ice cream is the hardest to scoop.<eos> But if you wrap something warm around it...
It would be that easy, and every day, I fight that.<eos> And I am so terrified that one day, I'm not gonna want to fight that anymore, Elena.<eos> And the next time I hurt somebody...<eos> It could be you.<eos> There will be no next time.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Maybe I don't.<eos> But what I do know.<eos> Is that you can take this, throw it in the quarry, and let the sun rise.<eos> Or you could take this ring and put it on.
We faxed the script to someone named Grizz.<eos> Scripts get in the way of my process, Shawn.<eos> Let's just shoot a hundred of these and see what we get.<eos> Here's your cake, miss Maroney.<eos> Let's see.<eos> "Jenny"?<eos> That's not my name.<eos> I don't want wheelchair Jenny from accounting getting credit for my cake.<eos> Take it back to carvel.<eos> But then they'll just throw it out.
Finished.<eos> - Agh. - Well, I have to go to work.<eos> My new manager is making us wear nametags.<eos> I might as well be working at a roller-skating drag queen restaurant under Taliban rule.<eos> But after your shift, we still have our special night, right?<eos> You have no idea how special.<eos> Ugh. Oh. We're celebrating our six-month anniversary and I think Paul is going to pop the question.<eos> Really?<eos> That's a little fast, isn't it?<eos> I will say yes when Paul proposes... That we make a sex tape and leak it on the Internet.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> All right, let's dive right in.<eos> Last night's assignment Was on the subject of the new deal.<eos> Mr. Montgomery, summarize for us, if you will.<eos> Uh... Yeah.<eos> The thing is, you know, I was absent yesterday, So I-I didn't know about the reading.<eos> The assignment was on the Web site.<eos> I-I know, but...<eos> But you didn't do it?
No.<eos> Oscar, you're going to have to grovel for this one.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> Grovel.<eos> Or, you know, we could just let the entire party see your cocktail Frank.<eos> All right.<eos> Ivy, listen.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't deserve your forgiveness, but I'll work for it.
You could expose me, or you can continue being my manager on my terms.<eos> Fine.<eos> Oh, and one more thing.<eos> You will not be getting 80%.<eos> Managers usually get ten.<eos> You will get five.<eos> Hey. How's my college girl?<eos> Not in college yet, but one step closer.<eos> I just finished my essay.<eos> Can I read it to you?
I know about the shootout at the Orpheum.<eos> Colonel Broyles told me all about it.<eos> You know, you took a blow to your head...<eos> Don't you come any closer.<eos> Liv, I'm going through it myself.<eos> Believe me, I know that the treatment can feel worse than the disease...<eos> But they're just trying to fix you.<eos> We all just want to help you get bet...<eos> Liv?<eos> Take your gun out and put it on the ground.
Believe me, I know that the treatment can feel worse than the disease...<eos> But they're just trying to fix you.<eos> We all just want to help you get bet...<eos> Liv?<eos> Take your gun out and put it on the ground.<eos> Olivia, come on.<eos> I've been your partner for two years.<eos> Put your gun on the ground.<eos> This isn't necessary.<eos> Kick it over here.
Unless, of course, This buried treasure had legs of its own.<eos> Wouldn't that be delightful?<eos> Any leads on the third man?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I was just in Milton.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> Your little plan wasn't so foolproof.<eos> The device was supposed to be there, right?<eos> Well, it wasn't.<eos> One of your men must have taken it.
All I know is he came to Paris from, uh, Prague with my niece.<eos> Well, if he's who I think he is, he could be in a lot of trouble.<eos> I-I need to talk to him.<eos> He doesn't do much talking, especially about himself.<eos> Please, sir, I've been to every bar in the neighborhood.<eos> And he's my stepbrother, and I'm very worried about him.<eos> If you have any idea where he is, please...<eos> Tell me you didn't rob a bank.<eos> My grandfather left me a small inheritance.<eos> I've just been waiting for the right thing to spend it on.
Was it a lie?<eos> This is about Serena. It is, isn't it?<eos> Okay, I wouldn't have said anything to Vanessa if you hadn't lied about getting that text.<eos> What text?<eos> When's the last time you checked your phone?<eos> Obviously not as recently as you did.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> It's from Serena.<eos> I thought you saw it.
The messenger's picking them up so that the models can get fitted, okay?<eos> Of course. I tell him extra careful, special delivery.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks, Vanya.<eos> Why are you calling me?<eos> I understand your reluctance to ever speak to me again.<eos> And I don't wanna bother you.<eos> I was picking up some Bass Industries blueprints earlier, and it seems I mistakenly took your portfolio.<eos> Chuck, I don't know what type of game you're playing, but my interview's in an hour.<eos> You have to bring it back right now.
You've put yourself in the right hands.<eos> Uh-oh. Juliet's plans are falling into place, and S. is primed for a fall.<eos> Hey, man, do you know anything about, uh, Chuck and Blair's so-called peace treaty?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> You know, they're really trying to change.<eos> I highly doubt that, but do you by any chance know what's in it?<eos> I'm sorry, man.<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> I gave my word I'd guard it.
Blair, we don't need any trouble.<eos> He'll be no trouble, mother.<eos> He and I are good.<eos> Yeah, so good you have been berating the help all day.<eos> I'm not berating anyone!<eos> I just want to be sure that the party is perfect.<eos> Your dress, miss Blair.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> What part of "J. Mendel" did you not understand?<eos> Actually, dear, I picked it out.
Life is tough, Serena.<eos> Just...<eos> Get a helmet.<eos> Or at least borrow one of my chapeaus.<eos> Wear it all day to remind you not to lose your...<eos> Head.<eos> Get on!<eos> Go!<eos> Well, thank you for the great advice.<eos> This comforter blocks out so much noise, they could sell it at Bose.
Though she did state something to the effect that he didn't quite satisfy her like I used to.<eos> It's true.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> They're all protecting each other.<eos> This is what they always do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Ms. Sharp, the reality is that with no proof,<eos> I can't tell who is telling the truth.<eos> Yeah, well, there was proof, until Blair drowned it.
Deandra, what the hell are you doing?<eos> It's cool, you guys, I got it.<eos> I got it. We can eat.<eos> - We can't eat the rabbit.<eos> He's got my soul.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> They had a moment, Dee.<eos> They shared a connection.<eos> I know it's cute, you guys, but, come on, this isn't about us anymore. I got to feed the baby.<eos> Mac, grab it by the head and wring its neck off.
I got him.<eos> Come on. Stop.<eos> Get out!<eos> Come on, Frank, Frank, push him out! What are you doing, trying to push me out of a moving car again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Goddamn it, pull over.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'll just pull over.<eos> Give me back the ring, all right?<eos> 'Cause you don't deserve it!
It's inevitable.<eos> You're gonna get old.<eos> Stefan won't.<eos> Forever doesn't last very long<eos> When you're human.<eos> I'm sorry, But i don't have what you're looking for.<eos> Sit down.<eos> And tell your boyfriend to walk away.<eos> I want the invention.<eos> I don't have it.
When you're human.<eos> I'm sorry, But i don't have what you're looking for.<eos> Sit down.<eos> And tell your boyfriend to walk away.<eos> I want the invention.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> I know that.<eos> But damon does.<eos> And you're gonna get it for me.<eos> He's not gonna give it to me.
Aah! Come on, lift.<eos> Oh! Come on!<eos> Call for help.<eos> Caroline: ok.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I'm showing you how easy it is<eos> To hurt the people that you care about.<eos> You're doing this just because of<eos> Johnathan gilbert's invention?<eos> Hand it over and the fun will stop.

It's much worse.<eos> Your heart still beats,<eos> Struggling to pump whatever blood remains.<eos> And when it's gone, your veins rub together like sandpaper.<eos> It's excruciating.<eos> The pleasure I'll get in watching you suffer<eos> Is greater than any pain I'll ever feel.<eos> It's stuffy,<eos> And I've been in this dress for days.<eos> You want to help me get out of it?
I know I chipped a little bit off of your wall of hatred.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> When you broke Jeremy's neck, did you know that he was wearing the ring?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Katherine really pissed me off.<eos> And I snapped.<eos> And...<eos> I got lucky with the ring.<eos> And I don't know what I would have done if he wasn't wearing it.
Because you're a petrova doppelganger.<eos> You're the key to breaking the curse.<eos> Curse?<eos> The sun and the moon curse?<eos> Ohh. You do know your history.<eos> What do you mean I'm the key?<eos> The moonstone is what breaks the curse.<eos> No.<eos> The moonstone is what binds the curse.<eos> Sacrifice is what breaks it.
Since then, werewolves can only turn on a full moon, And vampires are weakened by the sun.<eos> The werewolf part of the curse Is sealed with the moonstone.<eos> So tell me about your ex, Katherine.<eos> You must be Elena.<eos> How do we look exactly alike?<eos> Damon, don't.<eos> You need me.<eos> Elena's in danger.<eos> The moonstone is what breaks the curse.<eos> Sacrifice is what breaks it,
That's the point.<eos> We can't all have little daylight rings.<eos> How do you know this Slater guy's even here?<eos> I called him.<eos> He's here.<eos> He's always here.<eos> Good.<eos> Just one thing.<eos> If you are setting me up in any way,<eos> I will rip your heart out and shove it down your throat.
I was beginning to think that maybe I could have that too.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So am I.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How is she?<eos> She's sleeping. Which is good.<eos> Did your mom make it to Cooper's play?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Too bad we missed it.
And now she was getting all this wonderful attention, you know, From the school newspaper, her classmates, whatever.<eos> And she was thinking that she would really take some acting courses.<eos> Maybe even transferring colleges, Coming to N.Y.U. To be closer to me.<eos> And she wanted to know what I thought of this idea.<eos> You know, did I think she had the talent?<eos> Should she change course?<eos> So she was asking your advice as an older sister?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And I gave it.
And she had no idea how hard it was.<eos> And what was her reaction to that?<eos> She was pretty quiet.<eos> She looked crushed.<eos> So as a result of that, She never pursued acting.<eos> She never did another play again.<eos> Did you feel that you were responsible for...<eos> I could have encouraged her a little bit more, don't you think?<eos> She did ask you for your opinion.<eos> An honest opinion and you gave it.
And before me, the sea was starting to rise.<eos> And I had the sense that...<eos> That I was losing time.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Before I realized what had happened, I was in the backyard of my son's house.<eos> And I was digging a hole with my bare hands.<eos> And I was digging so desperately and intensely that I could feel my tongue swelling in my mouth.<eos> Then I reached to put the animal in the hole, but it was too dark.<eos> I could not locate it.
Can you tell me a little more about the animal that you saw in the dream?<eos> You said that you weren't quite sure whether it was a goat or a dog.<eos> Yes, I only know that it had a dark coat and that it had great difficulty breathing.<eos> Like Arun?<eos> You said that his breathing was labored while you watched him sleep.<eos> You think the animal in my dream was Arun?<eos> You said that the animal was in a state of decline.<eos> And you also gave it a gender.<eos> Did I?<eos> Yes, when you were standing over this animal with a stick, you called it a "her."
- Who's dead, the woman or the girl?<eos> - Why would you think it's one of them?<eos> - Doctor, thank you so much for your time.<eos> Um, if we need anything else, we'll be in touch.<eos> - Anything I can do to help.<eos> - So why'd you shut me down?<eos> - Not me--cragen.<eos> - I pulled the death certificate<eos> For lili denkova's phony husband, dmitri.<eos> Look who signed it.
Nobody does.<eos> But see, I know I don't know.<eos> Paradox.<eos> Interview over.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's funny how well you two get along.<eos> Well, I have the same kind of trouble with those pesky quantum lords.<eos> Noah's ethics should have prevented him from taking on the project in the first place.<eos> But he took it on.
Jin-woo...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for being late.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It seems like he has lost some weight.<eos> I'm sorry, Jin-woo.<eos> Sorry...<eos> Jin-ho.<eos> This tree... Me and my brother planted it when we were little.<eos> It was dying when I saw it two years ago.
I'd like to see some action now.<eos> I don't know what my first reaction will be.<eos> We haven't got a chance to know what it's like, when we haven't tried it.<eos> And the thought of these 'foreign fighters', you know.<eos> I can imagine that the first contact will be rather spicy.<eos> He could be Taliban.<eos> Just like anyone of the 7 billion people out there.<eos> - Too bad we can't tell them apart.<eos> - The only difference is the weapon.<eos> He could be hiding it under his clothes.
It's called Novichok Agent. - Novichok?<eos> Seriously?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Compared to that stuff, mustard gas might as well be cologne.<eos> Well, we can curse the darkness, or we can light a candle.<eos> So, who's got ideas about how to get it back?<eos> Talk to me, boys.<eos> The compound security is set up for defense, not mobility.<eos> The S.U.V.s aren't armored, and the road is isolated.<eos> We get them to bring the weapon out, we split 'em up, we tear gas them, we take it.
As good as they come.<eos> Four years of working him, I've never met a more honest cop.<eos> Pete was Kevin's partner.<eos> He's been trying to find Kevin, but the brass is shutting down his investigation.<eos> Well, that seems a little early to close up shop, don't you think?<eos> They found traces of coke in Kevin's car.<eos> And his cellphone shows some unreported contact with known criminals in the area.<eos> I mean, there's got to be an explanation.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I just don't have it yet.
It's not your typical ligature.<eos> Look how he's tied up.<eos> Wrists tied in front.<eos> So it wasn't about restraining him.<eos> Think we found Mr. Santiago?<eos> Case file did mention something about him passing away 10 years ago.<eos> Maybe she didn't want to spring for the urn.<eos> I gotta tell you, man, this place is disgusting.<eos> It's not the crime scene that's bugging me.<eos> It's what created it.
I'll tell you what happened.<eos> Now you know that I ran into Larry LaMotte.<eos> You know my history with him.<eos> I got jammed up, and I got arrested.<eos> But as luck would have it, I got a second chance at him.<eos> I gathered up that bastard, right?<eos> I jammed credit cards down his throat.<eos> I took out my gun, I popped a cap right in his brain, and I took that mess that used to be Larry LaMotte, and you know what?<eos> I didn't know what to do with it, so,<eos> I put it in-in the shredder at my work.
And second...<eos> No double bounces.<eos> Feet shoulder width apart.<eos> Knees bent.<eos> And just breathe.<eos> At the apex of each bounce there is a moment, outside of time, outside of words...<eos> Outside of everything.<eos> A perfect moment.<eos> A silent moment.<eos> I call it the world's whisper.
Understood, Master<eos> Didn't you say that you love Kung Fu, Man?<eos> Many other disciples will keep you company.<eos> I have to go to Hong Kong on business<eos> Dad, take good care of yourself!<eos> Make sure you look after your little brother, Tin Chi<eos> Dad, I will, I promise<eos> Dad!<eos> Time to take the medicine, Master<eos> Leave it there!
From your friends<eos> You and your name are known to everybody on this street now, lp Man<eos> You're popular, kid.<eos> So, you're studying Wing Chun?<eos> Authentic Wing Chun.<eos> The name was inherited from the school taught by Master Leung Jan from Foshan<eos> So you must be one of Chin's (Nickname of Chan Wah Shun) disciples<eos> Correct! Authentic my foot.<eos> So much so that you made me believe you learned directly from Master Ng Mui<eos> How long have you studied it?
Superintendent Aubert's unit should easily find the lunatic who is responsible...<eos> You agree?<eos> Not really, Mr Prosecutor.<eos> The victim has been carefully tied.<eos> The case is certainly more complex than it seems.<eos> What do we do, gentlemen?<eos> Leave her here?<eos> What do we do?<eos> Boss, we're quiet at the moment.<eos> If the crime squad doesn't want the case, we'll take it.
I've been through every guy.<eos> There's no one left.<eos> Come on, you sound like me at the Olympic village.<eos> Ugh, who cares?<eos> So I go to Floyd's wedding alone.<eos> Maybe I'll just lean into it<eos> And bring a cat in a baby stroller.<eos> Come on, you still have tonight.<eos> Liz, I want you to meet the guy That you're gonna be sitting next to tomorrow.<eos> He's told me his name, like, a million times, But I keep forgetting it.
Jules, in a relationship, Sometimes you have to do things you don't want to do.<eos> It's part of being a couple.<eos> (laughs) that's a good one. Okay. (beep)<eos> You know, I can't believe that no one cared that we're dating. What?<eos> Did you tell...<eos> Everyone? (gasps) Bobby.<eos> Dad. Bobby!<eos> What's up? Nothing.<eos> Sometimes I just like to say your name out loud.<eos> Me, too. But I whisper it. (whispers) Bobby.
(mouths words)<eos> You want a cappuccino?<eos> You're a jerk.<eos> How about a frappuccino?<eos> Look, you cannot still be mad.<eos> A 7-month anniversary?<eos> (high-pitched voice) it's a lite ridiculous.<eos> (shouting inaudibly) You skinny-armed little bitch!<eos> You saw her devil face, huh?<eos> I can still see it.
Was it yours or was it Director Vance's?<eos> Well, your director simply approved.<eos> Oh, the idea was all mine.<eos> Who assigned me this case?<eos> Well, I don't know exactly.<eos> Uh, someone on my staff.<eos> Why?<eos> How well do you know your staff?<eos> Does this have something to do with your cold case?<eos> You solved it?
More academic bling for Spencer.<eos> Okay, see you later.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you gonna be in this lab?<eos> Starting today.<eos> Cool.<eos> You were wearing a scarf this morning.<eos> Yeah, I was.<eos> I took it off.
Jimmy has skipped the ukulele solo and moved on to the second verse of 'Tardicaca hula gal' this has set back Nathan's plans immensely.<eos> Mimsy!<eos> Get up there and demand the ukulele solo!<eos> It's our only chance!<eos> Dar, okay boss!<eos> If you get in a pinch go through it's a cinch!<eos> Dar wee want the ukulele solo!<eos> We want da ukulele solo!<eos> Sorry, Mims, I just can't remember it.<eos> Well, we's wants ya to play it, don't we?
You all alright?<eos> You seem distracted.<eos> It's Katie, man.<eos> I keep...<eos> She's acting weird, you know.<eos> I think she might have found the engagement ring.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> I don't know how, man.<eos> I've moved it, like, four times now.<eos> I'm so paranoid that she senses it around, like it's giving off a signal, you know?
We've reviewed your counter... thank you for that, by the way... and we've decided we're sticking with our original offer.<eos> Ah. Well, - that's unacceptable.<eos> - Yeah, we don't think it is.<eos> Max, after everything we've been through, do you really believe that $140, 000 a year is fair?<eos> Well, I never thought of you as being greedy, Caroline.<eos> - Says the man with the $40 million estate.<eos> Look, we're not here to argue or bandy numbers about.<eos> We've, uh, got a court date tomorrow.<eos> Max has been more than generous with his offer.<eos> We advise you to take it.
Listen, your commander wasn't so lucky.<eos> Dr. Finch is working on her right now,<eos> But it isn't looking good.<eos> We think the bullet may have lodged in her liver.<eos> It would be in everyone's best interest<eos> If she survived.<eos> Yeah, I get that.<eos> What about Lieutenant johansen?<eos> Well, we've managed to stem the bleeding, But the baby's heart rate is dangerously low.<eos> We may have to take it out prematurely.
It's a great time to be a tiger.<eos> Mr. Flanders, how did you make these amazing fish?<eos> Actually, God made some fish that were pretty close to these, so naturally we selected those for further breeding.<eos> So that natural selection was the origin of this species?<eos> Yup, that's exactly...<eos> Whoa-oa-oa!<eos> You almost got me.<eos> Not on my watch!<eos> This seat taken?<eos> Uh, yes, I'm saving it for... this soy sauce packet.
It means last words.<eos> Are you here to teach me, or to kill me?<eos> What in the name of Malcolm Muggeridge are you doing?<eos> Ruining your plan.<eos> If you shoot me while we're in the same state, you go to jail.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll just shoot you, and tell people I did the plan.<eos> Not today, Bob.<eos> See, Bob, even you hate to see you.<eos> Now Bob, you take my face off nice and easy and kick it over here.
Don't give me that attitude.<eos> Spencer, you're just as driven and competitive as I am.<eos> Don't pretend you're not.<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> I am.<eos> I'm just not sure it's a thing that I want to celebrate anymore.<eos> And by the way, you don't have to read my essay.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because I stole it.
This is a store not a playground.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I like this one.<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Why don't you kids just come back with your parents?<eos> We're not kids.<eos> I'm 16.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Now give me the dress.<eos> No we're buying it!
Yes, sort of.<eos> People always have to make racist comments. It's awkward, isn't it?<eos> Oh, Mrs Martin, good to see you.<eos> My word, Arthur!<eos> - My papers were stolen.<eos> - Well, we'll redo them.<eos> I need a rent receipt, a photo, and your birth certificate.<eos> The birth certificate?<eos> I must have lost it.<eos> Yes, but we need it. You'll have to find it.
It was nothing like the others.<eos> It's, uh, shootin' Newton.<eos> People hear gunfire down there all the time.<eos> He probably fit right in.<eos> It was in your division.<eos> Hey, he had to start somewhere.<eos> So you think it's just a coincidence?<eos> All right, let's say it's not.<eos> What does that mean, he wanted our attention?<eos> Well, he certainly has it.
Take a deep breath. Try to relax.<eos> They meant to kidnap you, actually, 'cause you're the doc...<eos> you too, Evan.<eos> Deep breath.<eos> We didn't try to kidnap anyone.<eos> My little brother panicked.<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> Yeah, like you helped with the car?<eos> What do you think, doctor?<eos> All right, your ring is holding the blades apart. But your finger's too swollen to risk pulling it out.
- Mm. - How's Mac?<eos> - Your suspicions about a neurological disorder Were correct.<eos> The neurologists are thinking That it's kluver bucy syndrome.<eos> - Hyper-orality, increased appetite, Inappropriate social behaviors, yeah.<eos> - The good news is, is that the meds Should help decrease those urges, And that time should help Mac's brain repair.<eos> - Good.<eos> - And I found my ring.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Yep.<eos> He ate it.
- Good.<eos> - And I found my ring.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Yep.<eos> He ate it.<eos> - See?<eos> Everything is fine.<eos> - Or not.<eos> Where's your engagement ring?<eos> - I am cleaning it.
"Schindler's fist."<eos> See, this one right here, this is the one that got my attention.<eos> "The erotic awakenings of Sandy."<eos> How old was the girl in that video?<eos> What was she, 12?<eos> I... I can explain--<eos> Shut up!<eos> This is what's weird to me.<eos> Most of your files were locked away, But not the child porn.<eos> We found it in like 5 minutes.
Yes.<eos> What's his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We never met.<eos> Don't you try and play me, kid.<eos> His online name.<eos> Watcher 89.<eos> Were there any other names?<eos> Not that I could find.<eos> I don't like Signing up for porn unless I know who's running it.
And it's not her fault, she's outnumbered.<eos> 300 kids to one, Gandhi would be like, "Shut up !"<eos> So my job as a volunteer is to stand there, usually near my daughter so I can be with her, and then kids raise their hand, you need to go and help them.<eos> Usually, they need help opening a milk, because they can't open their milks.<eos> They can't do it!<eos> Because it's 2009, and we still put milk in this little paper box.<eos> Put it in a bottle!<eos> I don't know why we're doing this torture.<eos> We put it in this envelope that was invented by some Dutch in 1773.<eos> And they can't do it, they can't open it.
I have.<eos> Whilst most of us make the transition from adolescent to adult with varying degrees of success, there are some amongst us whose egos are so badly traumatised by the process that they lose any sense of self.<eos> In a very small number of cases, this abnegation of the self becomes so extreme that it develops into a fetish of sorts of self-degradation.<eos> This could manifest as a desire to turn oneself into another's excrement. Dr Hartcher, do you believe that such a mind<eos> may be vulnerable to powers of suggestion, psychological manipulation?<eos> Yes.<eos> Dr Hartcher, have you ever eaten another animal's flesh? Yes.<eos> Having cooked that flesh yourself?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Seasoned it?
Now we're talking.<eos> What kind?<eos> I have to go.<eos> Contact me when everything's set up.<eos> We need to know you'll be here if we're gonna risk everything on our end.<eos> We will.<eos> Marcus released another wave of guards through the ship.<eos> They're searching everyone.<eos> You've gotta get rid of the comms device.<eos> If they find it on you, we'll all be exposed.
You do realize you owe Mr. Rothstein for the privilege.<eos> You ain't got no jurisdiction down in Atlantic City.<eos> They came here from Philly on their own accord.<eos> Have you been noticing the cost of gasoline?<eos> Last week goes from 18 to 20 cents a gallon.<eos> - Who is this kike?<eos> - The name's Meyer Lansky.<eos> And he's a pal of mine, like I said.<eos> Gasoline, like I said, it's what moves America.<eos> Once you got the hooch, you gotta distribute it, right?
Don't.<eos> Sorry. Sorry.<eos> What are you doing about the money? .<eos> And the gaming license?<eos> Sophie, I told you. I will manage everything.<eos> Why do you worry, baby?<eos> If I depend on you, I'II soon.. ..be wandering on the streets of Panjim again.<eos> Five years.<eos> I ran the casino for five years.<eos> I know how to run it in future as well.
With a classical artistic foundation.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Read it to yourself.<eos> Quiet now.<eos> Did you guys see this syllabus?<eos> Oh, we don't need to share.<eos> I'm in it. Yep.<eos> Go, team!<eos> The Koechert diamond pearl was stolen by Gerald Blanchard in 1998.<eos> It took them a full two weeks to realize that the jewel was missing because Blanchard replaced it with a pretty darn good costume replica.
That last part's a tall order, Chalky.<eos> So is delivering 100% of that colored vote.<eos> "Upon that night, when fairies light beneath the moon's pale beams; there, up the cove, they stray and rove and haunt the Halloween." Boo!<eos> That's all for now.<eos> I need to finish the cake.<eos> You go and wash your hands, please.<eos> And you help your sister.<eos> The poem... Was that Frost?<eos> Robert Burns.<eos> My nana would read it each year on All Hallows Eve.

Well, I don't understand.<eos> You're kind and funny, women should be queuing up.<eos> Women of my age don't want impoverished, would-be novelists.<eos> They want rich, attractive James Bond types who - wrestle sharks and eat steak raw.<eos> - You are attractive.<eos> Really?<eos> You've never said I'm attractive before.<eos> Well, I am a lesbian so I'm not sure it counts.<eos> Oh this is so annoying.<eos> I've got the perfect dress but I left it at Chloe's when I moved out.

- I'm going to crawl out.<eos> - It's stupid, she'll see you!<eos> - I'm going to miss my audition.<eos> - Too bad!<eos> Tess!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> I think she was under the bed!<eos> I came to get my dress back.<eos> Now I see why I couldn't find it.
Were you... were you seeing her before you finished with me?<eos> No!<eos> Maybe it'd be better to tell the truth.<eos> Just keep out of this, will you?<eos> Oh, I'd get used to being bossed around if I were you.<eos> There's plenty more where that came from.<eos> - Tess, I think we should go.<eos> - Yes, go!<eos> - I'm not going anywhere till I get my dress back.<eos> - I'll send it to you.
Yeah.<eos> Why? We're going out.<eos> What?<eos> Now?<eos> Come in.<eos> Visitor for you, Sarge.<eos> A Cat Mackenzie?<eos> Send her in.<eos> Oh, and, Paul, I'm still waiting for that crime report.<eos> If you could hurry it up, please.
Is... is he dead?<eos> D-did... did you check?<eos> Chris!<eos> Keep an eye on the driver. 1507.<eos> We've got an injured cyclist here.<eos> Where's the ambulance?<eos> Sir, can you hear me?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We have his gun.<eos> But we can't tie it to the murder,
Look, um... Can... Can you remove it?<eos> You asked for an X-ray. Listen, just... Yeah.<eos> The fact is that people can survive years<eos> With shrapnel lodged in their bodies.<eos> So I'll... I'll be okay.<eos> I can live with it, right?<eos> My concern here is the bullet.<eos> I need this to put a murderer in jail.<eos> And I need the patient's consent in order to proceed. Yeah.<eos> And I don't give it. Fine.
As soon as you release Sophia and the detainees.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Don't bother, I'm not releasing any of them.<eos> It's not going to happen.<eos> Then the passengers will die.<eos> And what I did to them, I can do to whole towns, entire cities.<eos> You accept the terms to my deal.<eos> Here's the new deal.<eos> You're going to give me that antidote, and you're going to give it to me when I tell you to, because if even one of those passengers dies, I will execute Sophia and the rest of the detainees at Inostranka.
I'll wait for orders at the rendezvous point.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> We'll get someplace safe.<eos> Then he and I are going to have a little talk.<eos> You came.<eos> Mr. President, it's three minutes past the deadline, and no antidote has been forthcoming.<eos> The termination protocol is ready.<eos> Just one more minute.<eos> Where's the antidote?<eos> You'll get it when you release my people.
She survives this, Blake. Am I clear?<eos> Pull me out if there are any major developments.<eos> Yes, Mr. President.<eos> Sir, I'd like to join my men in the field.<eos> Supervise their deployment in person.<eos> Thomas, it's Simon.<eos> And we have a problem.<eos> They've got a tracker in Sophia.<eos> In her?<eos> They put it in her food.
Sir, I'd like to join my men in the field.<eos> Supervise their deployment in person.<eos> Thomas, it's Simon.<eos> And we have a problem.<eos> They've got a tracker in Sophia.<eos> In her?<eos> They put it in her food.<eos> It's a radioactive isotope.<eos> While it's active, they'll be able to track her wherever she goes.<eos> There must be some way to get it out.
Can you leave me alone now?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I need to focus.<eos> No, don't worry about me.<eos> I didn't want anything from the coffee cart.<eos> 1, 2, 3, 4.<eos> Oh, Megan!<eos> Your dress!<eos> It's all right, mom.<eos> You can't see it anywhere.
No one's here.<eos> It's just you... and me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, there.<eos> I have a feeling you're gonna like this.<eos> Oh, Mom...<eos> He's not the one who murdered her.<eos> I don't understand why you're showing me this.<eos> The murder of Mary-Louise Graff is a closed case.<eos> In fact, you closed it, didn't you?
- Shawn.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I looked into that.<eos> They only get money if the bear dies accidentally.<eos> They don't get anything if the bear is euthanized for killing someone.<eos> That's a pretty big buzz kill.<eos> It's the only theory we really had.<eos> This is so ironic.<eos> I mean, all these people are afraid of this amazing creature, and look at it.<eos> It's relying on you and I to save it, Shawn.
I especially enjoy what you do with the, uh...<eos> What's that called?<eos> Yellow tape.<eos> Crime scene tape.<eos> And it's there for a reason.<eos> Look, we only came over to get a closer look at the ride, because I used to have one just like it.<eos> Gus and I built it from scratch in auto shop.<eos> Spencer, you don't want this case.<eos> - Oh, but I do.<eos> - But you can't have it.
- You're one to talk, Mr. "I bought win a date with Tad Hamilton on DVD."<eos> There were 15 deleted scenes, Shawn.<eos> 15.<eos> You said you were going to the office last night to catch up on work.<eos> Which I did, then I saw those beers in the fridge.<eos> Our fridge doesn't work.<eos> - Yes, but 7-11's does.<eos> It is there that I saw the Internity audiobooks for sale and decided that the paperwork would have to wait.<eos> Hey, how'd your date go with that chick who spells her name weird?<eos> - Her name is Kim and she spells it k-i-m.
Yeah, it's not helpful.<eos> No, actually, it might be.<eos> Littleton held that, legally, gender is determined by which box is marked on the birth certificate, right?<eos> Yeah, but Allison won't let us argue that she's a man.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Apply the logic of Littleton.<eos> If the birth certificate is controlling, your client was legally married.<eos> It's a win-win.<eos> The state used a birth certificate to destroy a marriage.<eos> You can use it to validate one.
Work him to get to Halbridge.<eos> That doesn't guarantee we'll recover the bonds.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Let him think I'm dead.<eos> Congratulations, Caffrey.<eos> You've killed me.<eos> It's done.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What about the gun?<eos> I left it in the briefcase for the driver to dispose of.
Price was poor.<eos> So Price knocks him off and then steals his identity.<eos> Halbridge's body is lying there at Ridgemont, driving Price crazy.<eos> His own tell-tale heart.<eos> Pay up.<eos> What?<eos> Peter told me you would bring up the tell-tale heart.<eos> Oh, I'm glad my grasp of Gothic fiction is a source of amusement for you.<eos> He buys the property.<eos> It isn't worth the risk of digging up the body, so he cements over it and makes sure no one ever digs there.
- Did it work?<eos> - It worked.<eos> Wine, please.<eos> Bringing Sara back from the dead was brilliant.<eos> Sterling Bosch released the mail?<eos> You had a very specific syrah here that I wanted to try, but it's gone missing.<eos> I drank it.<eos> The Pinot is fine.<eos> Moz, the mail.<eos> Yes, they released it.
Yeah, he caught him.<eos> Figured he was responsible for at least three other girls.<eos> He caught him, but the case had some holes.<eos> Tommy was not in top form.<eos> He blew it.<eos> Prosecutors had to cut a deal... a few years on a weapons charge for some guns they found, but he walked on the rape and murder.<eos> I doubt your dad ever forgave himself... or Kaliciak.<eos> - We should bring my dad's gun in and get it tested by ballistics.<eos> - Andy... No. If the gun doesn't match the slugs in Kaliciak,<eos> - then we know he didn't do it.
is she okay?<eos> Actually, she's...<eos> She's not.<eos> I'm sorry, but she's dead. *********<eos> Excuse me, folks.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> So, uh, they're almost done here.<eos> You can go in and help with the witnesses.<eos> I should stay with her- um, with the body-<eos> Un-until they take it away.
Yeah, okay.<eos> Um, I'll see if I can dig somebody up from undercover.<eos> There's really not a lot of time, though.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll do it.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Uh, appreciate the gesture, McNally, but we need someone with more experience.<eos> I have experience.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you referring to the hooker detail?<eos> Because you couldn't give it away.
And on three again. Three.<eos> Dispatch, 1519.<eos> We've got the...<eos> He was coming at you pretty hard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you draw your gun?<eos> I guess I just thought that... don't.<eos> Don't what?<eos> Don't overthink it, okay?<eos> That feeling in your gut... you gotta learn to listen to it.
Shaw's already milking this for all it's worth.<eos> Made me do a burger run.<eos> How long is he gonna be in for?<eos> A broken rib?<eos> Ah, he'll be out tomorrow.<eos> Back on the job in a week.<eos> God.<eos> If he thought I was cursed before...<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> He lost his gun. You... you got it back.
Then he'll plant the gun.<eos> We'll just follow Navarro's guy back to Mozzie.<eos> I know this is boring, but stay awake.<eos> I haven't slept since this whole thing started.<eos> Stomach hurt?<eos> A little bit.<eos> Got that parched thing happening?<eos> Yeah. My mouth's a little dry.<eos> Well, hold on to that feeling.<eos> Remember it the next time you decide to infiltrate the den of a mobster on a whim or something equally cockeyed.
Your honor...<eos> Mr. brogan, be good.<eos> We'll withdraw.<eos> Regarding your testimony about your relationship with Maria, did the two of you ever display affection in front of Mr. Sellards?<eos> Well, that dude was always up in our grille.<eos> He caught us in the park once, and I was like, "seriously?"<eos> So you're saying, he trailed the two of you?<eos> A bunch of times, yeah.<eos> Once, he had Maria's crucifix.<eos> He said it found it, but I didn't believe him.
I'm just trying to keep this fair.<eos> Yeah, I'm just trying to remind you that actual people are involved here. Is this about me or is it about the case?<eos> Well, hell if I know, but two kids just lost their mother because of this trial.<eos> We're at trial because a young girl was murdered.<eos> Ms. Peale, we'll now hear your summation.<eos> Maria Covas was brutalized beneath the window of the office of her teacher, the same teacher that stalked her.<eos> The defendant's own witness corroborated this.<eos> A bunch of times, yeah.<eos> Once, he had Maria's crucifix.<eos> Said he found it.
So the fire begins to go out.<eos> More and more iron builds up in the star's core Until almost all the remaining fuel runs out.<eos> Now gravity takes over and squashes the star in on itself. As its core gets more and more compressed, Its temperature soars<eos> Finally, the star collapses and explodes.<eos> This is a supernova The death of a star and the birth of something new.<eos> In these brief microseconds, A massive shock wave passes through the star.<eos> The blast is so powerful that it forces some of the iron To fuse into even heavier elements.<eos> And that's how heavy elements,<eos> Such as gold or platinum or lead, Are made, forged in the heart of an exploding star.<eos> So, if you have a gold ring, make sure you appreciate it.
But they also reveal that time runs faster up here than it does down on Earth.<eos> Inside each spacecraft is a very precise clock.<eos> But despite being so accurate, they all gain around a third of a billionth of a second every day.<eos> The system has to correct for the drift.<eos> Otherwise that tiny difference would upset the whole system, causing every GPS device on Earth to go out by about six miles a day.<eos> You could just imagine the mayhem that would cause.<eos> The problem doesn't lie with the clocks.<eos> They run fast because time itself runs faster here than it does down below.<eos> And the reason for this extraordinary effect is the mass of the Earth.<eos> Einstein realized that matter drags on time, slows it down like the slow part of a river.
This distortion opens the door to the possibility of time travel.<eos> So what we need to really travel in time is something much more massive than the pyramid<eos> And I know just the thing.<eos> Right in the center of the Milky Way, 26 thousand light years from us, lies the heaviest object in the entire galaxy, hidden by a vast cloud of gas and stars.<eos> It's a super-massive black hole, containing the mass of four million suns.<eos> Crushed down into a single point by its own gravity.<eos> The closer you get to the black hole, the stronger the gravity.<eos> Get really close, and not even light can escape.<eos> So it's wrapped in a sphere of darkness fifteen million miles in diameter.<eos> A black hole like this one has a dramatic effect on time, slowing it down far more than anything else in the galaxy.
I really don't think he liked it.<eos> It takes some time, bonding.<eos> Especially now your mam's dead.<eos> I'm telling you, you'll be inseparable shortly.<eos> Nothing will get between yous.<eos> Slater!<eos> Where is your milk?<eos> Come out to the front.<eos> Where is your milk?<eos> I drank it, Miss.

Come on in.<eos> Katy, you look gorgeous.<eos> You too, honey.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Hello.<eos> She always does.<eos> Sandra, I love that dress.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's a new line I'm carrying at the shop.<eos> You should check it out.
Seems like Tom didn't think to mention it.<eos> Anyway...<eos> Mummy?<eos> Hello, Charlie.<eos> My name's Kevin.<eos> Very nice to meet you.<eos> This is Charlie's mummy, everybody.<eos> Isn't she pretty?<eos> We've been keeping this picture for you.<eos> Can I give it to you now?
I beg you.<eos> - I am a lot older than I was when I first knew you.<eos> And wiser.<eos> I do not know if I shall ever be married, or if I will ever be Queen.<eos> Probably neither. But if I do become Queen, I swear to you now on the Holy Gospels and on the soul of my mother, that I will make England faithful again.<eos> I will do whatever it takes, I will burn however many heretics I have to, I will spill as much blood as I have to, to make this unfortunate realm Catholic again, and heal it, so help me God.<eos> - May I?<eos> Take this ring, in memory of me.<eos> It was a gift from the Emperor...<eos> Who received it from your mother.
Light samsonite.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It's an old spy term.<eos> For when spooks<eos> Used to stuff their suitcases with crumpled newspaper<eos> To make it look like something valuable.<eos> Either stas was too dumb to know what good intel is, Or he thought we were too dumb.<eos> Given the fact that he's dead now, It's probably the former.<eos> There's nothing here of value.<eos> Type up a closer on the stas file and get it to me.
Because that's when they're going to let the scumbag go.<eos> You crossed the line, Danny.<eos> Get off my case.<eos> Oh, I'll be getting off your case.<eos> You're my brother. I'll have to recuse myself if this goes to trial, but that's a really big "If," isn't it?<eos> Anybody home?<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Hey.<eos> I got the meat here from Eddie's for tomorrow.<eos> Linda says you should probably take it out about two hours before you go to mass.
At first.<eos> She began reading his writings and he took a shine to Mathilde immediately and took an even bigger shine to Otto's money.<eos> Yes. He was writing to friends about it within just a few weeks.<eos> Really? He'd met this rather nice woman with this very, very wealthy husband.<eos> Wagner was a married man, although his relationship with his wife Minna was tempestuous.<eos> He had enjoyed his share of affairs over the years, but his infatuation with Mathilde Wesendonck had a special intensity.<eos> No-one knows exactly what went on behind closed doors here, but it's clear that the relationship fired Wagner's creativity.<eos> He wrote music inspired by her poetry, including a piece which later evolved into one of his greatest operas.<eos> On the 23rd December, 1857, Wagner performed a song of Mathilde Wesendonck's that he dedicated to her, called Traume, Dreams.<eos> He orchestrated it and we're about to hear it in exactly the room it was first performed, here at the villa Wesendonck.
When I was seven.<eos> My entire childhood, every second of my 20s,<eos> I let that define me.<eos> - You're supposed to.<eos> That's what family does-- it defines you.<eos> - Look, if you want to win an argument, fine.<eos> But thinking about it that way,<eos> That's all you'll win.<eos> It's a waste of time, Walter.<eos> Take your past and box it up.

These aren't sad tears.<eos> They're happy tears.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I'm pregnant.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> You found it!<eos> - No, you found it.<eos> Open it up.<eos> Treasure!<eos> I don't think we should keep it.
Hales, I have to stay here.<eos> Why, so you can spy and pout and stab voodoo dolls in the face?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Portland, you and me, it'll be fun.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> I feel bad for Mia.<eos> Alex's powers are strong.<eos> I would know.<eos> And yet you're the one with the engagement ring, not bad.<eos> - Even if you did get it from Julian.
Or what I could do is punish her by staying here and making her move in with you.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I thought you'd be gone by now.<eos> We got kind of a late start.<eos> You didn't see the truck?<eos> Yeah, I saw it.<eos> Um, I left the ring out.<eos> Did you find it?<eos> I didn't see it.
Oh, wow.<eos> Is this a shrine to himself?<eos> Not really.<eos> He calls it a "tribute."<eos> To himself.<eos> Look, Jack, Dan is nowhere to be found.<eos> There's no beer in the fridge.<eos> Well, is it possible he just ran out of beer?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> All right, he had to have taken it somewhere.
- You told him about me?<eos> - Not a word.<eos> - Who said anything about flatmates?<eos> - I did.<eos> Told Mike this morning I must be a difficult man to find a flatmate for.<eos> Now here he is, just after lunch with an old friend clearly just home from military service in Afghanistan.<eos> - Wasn't a difficult leap.<eos> - How did you know about Afghanistan?<eos> Got my eye on a nice little place in central London.<eos> We ought to be able to afford it.
Hold him up, honey.<eos> Hold him up.<eos> Let's see his face.<eos> Let's just take a peek at the little tyke's birth certificate, and I'll get you on your way.<eos> Uh...<eos> I think you've got it.<eos> No.<eos> Must be in your purse, sweetheart.<eos> Yeah, I don't...<eos> I don't see it.
I don't get it.<eos> Why would anyone want to do a vampire?<eos> Lame.<eos> Yeah. So lame.<eos> I can't believe they get married and have a vampire baby.<eos> Thanks for the spoiler alert, dumbshit!<eos> It's too bad Edward dumped you and now you don't have a date for the prom.<eos> 'Cause that dress would have looked great on you<eos> But you don't need a dress, because Edward left you behind in the woods like bear shit.<eos> So I'm going to wear it instead!
Yeah.<eos> Card-carrying member.<eos> Justice, we really should go.<eos> You know, before you go and burn a flag in protest, a jury unanimously convicted Greg Beals of killing a cop.<eos> Three appellate courts saw no reason to overturn that verdict, but perhaps you know better.<eos> I might, if you'd let him have a fair trial.<eos> I don't let people have anything.<eos> - I follow the law.<eos> - You have an 8:00 A.M. call.<eos> If Beals had exculpatory evidence, he had to present it at the state Habeas hearing.
This mind-twisting story has become the new dogma, but however robust, the Big Bang is still just a theory.<eos> Princeton Professor of physics Dr. David Spergel has spent much of his career trying to understand if and how this cataclysmic event happened.<eos> People sometimes call him "Mr. Universe."<eos> For Spergel, the Big Bang is still the most complete and scientifically sound model of the early Universe.<eos> Everything around us came from the hot Big Bang.<eos> The Universe started out -- Big Bang Theory -- very, very hot, very dense.<eos> That hot radiation cooled. From that emerged matter, radiation, everything that makes up the world around us.<eos> And here we are at Bell Labs at Crawford Hill, the place where the hot Big Bang theory really all started, in some ways.<eos> Arno Penzias and Robert Wilson are a pair of radio astronomers who worked here at Bell Laboratories.<eos> What they were doing is they were studying the microwave sky as Bell Labs was exploring the idea of using it for microwave communication.
You gonna fix her too?<eos> Well, we can.<eos> I mean, she's here now, With you and the others.<eos> She doesn't die for another 63 years.<eos> We can save her!<eos> How?<eos> Tonight Adam Barlowe<eos> Is gonna steal the blueprints to the bridge device.<eos> If he stop him, the new bridge device never gets made.<eos> Beverly doesn't turn it on in 2010...
First you gotta find somebody willing to wear it.<eos> But if you do, they're gonna wanna wear it where they can be noticed.<eos> I'm thinking this t-shirt needs its own Facebook page.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - "Have you seen me?"<eos> You guys are harassing me because of Facebook?<eos> - That t-shirt has 3,400 friends, and six people posted pictures of you wearing it tonight.<eos> Apparently, it's one-of-a-kind.<eos> - From like a three-year-old collection.<eos> I bought it from this Asian girl Kai
It's not something that happens in space-time.<eos> There's no story in space-time that can tell us how these nonlocal correlations happen, and that's why we conclude that they seem to emerge somehow from outside space-time.<eos> So that has, of course, deep implication for our understanding of space-time or actually, more precisely, for our non-understanding of space-time.<eos> Some believe that quantum nonlocality can be used to send messages backward in time.<eos> At the University of Washington, physicist John Cramer is putting this idea to the test.<eos> Like Gisin, he's experimenting with entangled photons -- photons bound by nonlocality.<eos> The twist is that Cramer is trying to send photon signals from the present back to the very recent past.<eos> These custom-made lasers and measuring devices, called interferometers, are the heart of Cramer's time machine.<eos> One interferometer called "Alice" sends photon signals to another interferometer called "Bob."<eos> If Cramer's theory is correct and the calibration is just right, Bob will get a message from Alice a fraction of a second before she sends it.
Time travel is filled with such mysteries.<eos> The things we would like to understand about time travel are, one, is it possible, even in principle, that the laws of physics permit backward time travel?<eos> We don't know the answer.<eos> We need the laws of quantum gravity in order to find out the answer.<eos> Second question is, if backward time travel is possible, then what does nature do about the so-called grandfather paradox, that I can go backward in time if it's possible and kill my grandfather before my father was conceived,<eos> thereby changing history so that I no longer exist?<eos> What does nature do about that?<eos> The conservative interpretation is that space-time is one four-dimensional thing.<eos> It doesn't change.<eos> So if time travelers go to the past, they were always part of the past, and they don't change it.
What are you looking at?<eos> Never seen a hurricane before.<eos> You don't "see" hurricanes.<eos> You hang on for dear life and hope your house is still there in the morning.<eos> It's just a little wind and rain, right?<eos> A category-2?<eos> "Just a little wind and rain"?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> "2" doesn't sound so bad.<eos> Let me put it this way -- a category-1 can rip that tree out of the ground and drive it through the window of a house three miles away.
Um, OK.<eos> So, uh... I feel really stupid.<eos> Why?<eos> I just found out I've been calling you the wrong name all this time.<eos> Oh, that!<eos> That's OK.<eos> Well, I promise I will never call you Sandra again.<eos> - I like Amber better, anyway.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I mean, I didn't pick it, duh, my mom did.
There is no us.<eos> You're a stranger.<eos> So please, just open up another wormhole,<eos> Jump right back through it, And give me my Henry back.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> My Henry's gone.<eos> This taking forever, man.<eos> Just a little patience, Kevin.<eos> Handy little gadget.<eos> Found it in Fargo's man cave.
Okay.<eos> All... all right.<eos> But if something goes wrong, you have got to... ...<eos> Aah!<eos> The tech bandit?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Y-you're giving me the tech bandit case.<eos> That's the file, Detective.<eos> Yeah, I know it's the file.<eos> I saw it on my desk this morning.
Courage!<eos> There you are!<eos> Pig shit!<eos> Always on my foot. You suck!<eos> Want to make me his punching bag.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> C'mon!<eos> I'm waiting!<eos> You see the champagne?<eos> I don't open it like everybody else!
It's my RV!<eos> Sean!<eos> Sean, what are you doing here?<eos> Recycling your recycling.<eos> Um, by the way, this kind of plastic doesn't break down...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Things don't get recycled 'cause you feel guilty throwing them in the trash.<eos> Oh, my sweet Satan.<eos> Is this weapon yours?<eos> Yeah, I just bought it.
I hired a car.<eos> You hired a limo.<eos> Town Car wouldn't do?<eos> You don't know my wife.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fox Sports sent that footage over.<eos> Was Curtis missing a wedding ring?<eos> No. A half-inch band, size 12.<eos> Sent Daniel into the Fields to look for it.
I can get us tee times anytime we want.<eos> This isn't about you, all right?<eos> You and I can play anytime.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Busy solving a murder anyway.<eos> Any luck investigating those ligature marks?<eos> Not yet. All right, any luck finding the ring?<eos> No, I was gonna try pawnshops.<eos> No, it's too personal an item to sell.<eos> Whoever took it must have known how much it meant to Curtis.

I believe you have a ring for me.<eos> I'm not talking to you.<eos> Hey, if I killed someone, I wouldn't talk to me, either.<eos> You're not gonna trick me into saying something.<eos> I'm waiting for my lawyer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's wait.<eos> But before your lawyer comes, Crystal, you should know, you're in a world of trouble.<eos> Curtis was wearing this ring the day he died.<eos> Only way you could've got it is if the killer gave it to you.

Different experience.<eos> Curtis was a star.<eos> Your ass was warming the bench.<eos> Should've tried out for the cheerleading team with Rita.<eos> You might have had a chance.<eos> I played.<eos> In practice, maybe.<eos> What, two games?<eos> No wonder you don't wear your ring.<eos> You didn't earn it the way Curtis did.
It doesn't matter.<eos> I can keep this up all night!<eos> Kenzi?<eos> Sweetie?<eos> Is that you?<eos> More bad news.<eos> Wonderful.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "The creature is so crafty, it buries its heart."<eos> Until you find the heart and destroy it... The spider itself is virtually invincible.
I am a Captain of the Ultramarines Chapter and this is my vessel, so put that away.<eos> This is improper, Severus.<eos> Indulge me.<eos> The Codex is empty?<eos> Do you see?<eos> This is what has burdened me!<eos> I thought it was Chaos' trickery!<eos> This is deceit.<eos> Heresy.<eos> I don't know the purpose or the point, but I know evil when I taste it.
My problem is that I'm the UN.<eos> Kat blames Tara, Tara blames Kat and guess who I blame.<eos> You didn't have to send that photo.<eos> And if you're now harassing Tara with them, then that's just...<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Like I could be bothered with the melodrama.<eos> So where's my assignment?<eos> I...<eos> I'm not going to do it for you.

Everything's under control.<eos> How's giraffe doctor?<eos> Larson?<eos> We've only seen the nurse.<eos> I hate doctors' offices.<eos> This was stupid.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> Okay, Clovis.<eos> Let's see that tush.<eos> I can sell you beer but you can't drink it inside the stadium.
I know.<eos> You were always on the run with your dad, and being a spy doesn't make it easy to make a home anywhere.<eos> I understand.<eos> It's just what you're used to.<eos> But I love you because we're different.<eos> And one dress is not going to make or break us.<eos> One dress.<eos> What?<eos> Sofia unpacked everything except for that one sequined dress.<eos> Right, she put it in a suitcase.
But you don't want to hurt her.<eos> Okay, let's get started on the detonator.<eos> That's not good.<eos> Wheelwright.<eos> Quick, quick.<eos> Why is the device counting down?<eos> Oh, that?<eos> Well, just a safety measure to protect against tampering.<eos> It counts down until I verify that the weapon is in my possession.<eos> Okay, tell us how to turn it off.
Five minutes.<eos> Bailiff, bring me one with sprinkles.<eos> What is your problem?<eos> This is a criminal case, and you're interrupting because you suddenly feel badly about Bradley?<eos> What?<eos> No. I am here on a legal matter.<eos> Mm-hmm. See, I was looking on "Mad-itude" because you got me involved in the case.<eos> And something caught my legal eye.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know how Madison took Abby's picture down and put it back up again?
I heard it became a pretty big fight.<eos> I felt awful. I made her cry.<eos> Stacy said it was the night before you were supposed to meet Deb's parents, right?<eos> Yeah, I know where you're going.<eos> I suppose I was nervous about our future together, so I picked a fight over a stupid sweater.<eos> I was a jerk.<eos> I'm sure she understood.<eos> Look, I am not saying that Vanessa is the right woman for you, but...<eos> But I have to let go of the past.<eos> Well, you can't get it back, right?
ï¿½ï¿½ so I studied the research Ä¼ and I ran the probabilities and I came to the conclusion that by the time they could bring him back, I'll be gone.<eos> But if you freeze yourself, then maybe someday you can resume your life together.<eos> Simple math.<eos> "Maybe" trumps the probability of zero.<eos> I understand the need to put your life on hold for the one you love, but are you sure that... I'd really like for you to go now, please.<eos> Professor Miller, maybe your reasoning is sound, but you left out part of the equation.<eos> I'd like to read you something.<eos> "Scientific achievement doesn't rest.<eos> "It's a lifetime endeavor.<eos> And if you want to know the future, create it."
Hey, I just want to want to give you a heads about Math invite's to go to Baze's in Thanksgiving<eos> - And you are actually coming?<eos> - What I could get out of it, Matk known I was gonna be alone and wouldn't let it go.<eos> Really, cuz Math couln't apply pressure to a papercut.<eos> ok, I admitted, I want to be there.<eos> I like Thanksgiving, I like the food and I like the excuse to be with you.<eos> Me too.<eos> Yellow.<eos> You know there's this crazy new invention called the door bell?<eos> You use it when you enter a house where you dont live.
Yeah, and from now on, you'll be coming home every day after school because, apparently, I cannot trust you the way I thought I could.<eos> Okay, Cate...<eos> Lux.<eos> You messed up big-time.<eos> I really hope that it was worth it.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Wanted an emergency I think meeting on a Sunday.<eos> Presumably it wasn't so we would all sit in silence for the hour.<eos> Your honesty exercise sucked.<eos> That's because she turned it into an inquisition.
Sit down.<eos> You've done enough talking.<eos> Who gave you permission to visit Hayes in prison today?<eos> I don't need your permission.<eos> You sure about that?<eos> Did you know that after you spoke to him there was an attempt on his life?<eos> He'll live, but the trial has been postponed.<eos> Which just puts Jerry in more jeopardy.<eos> You're not helping my case.<eos> You're going to ruin it.
Check the house.<eos> This is just way out of control!<eos> You're crazy!<eos> What, you're not enjoying yourself?<eos> You look like hell.<eos> I can't take this anymore.<eos> Then you know what to do.<eos> Make a sharp move, Gene.<eos> It'll all be over.<eos> But you can't do it 'cause you're a coward.
No.<eos> Not Jenny Shepard.<eos> She was truly responsible for bringing our organizations together.<eos> And for bringing my daughter into your life.<eos> But I am not here for her.<eos> - For Ziva.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're not here for Ziva. She has a name.<eos> I am aware.<eos> I gave it to her.
Got this baby for 30 bucks.<eos> What a deal.<eos> Thank you so much for coming.<eos> - I'm gonna go refill my glass.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Paul's aunt.<eos> - What's with her face?<eos> - I know.<eos> It's terrible, she can't leave it alone.
I work for the Fairfields.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Yeah, I-I'm not really in a champagne kind of a mood.<eos> Good.<eos> It's beer.<eos> I thought we would celebrate the simple things in life.<eos> I don't really drink beer.<eos> That's 'cause you've never had my beer.<eos> Okay, well, can we at least drink it your way?
Yeah?<eos> Do I look bad-ass?<eos> Yeah, you look like a bad-ass.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Mm. The Sterns disappeared from their apartment in Charlestown.<eos> You checked every Jane Doe in the last two years?<eos> Maybe we found Emily Stern and we didn't know it.<eos> No. No, there's nothing.<eos> Her body is still out there.<eos> If we could just find it, there could be some kind of a clue.
It's a '74 Bedford.<eos> It's pink.<eos> It's not the most practical car, because it's got one seat and it's basically a kitchen on wheels.<eos> You do get people queuing up on the side of a road.<eos> And then they're mildly surprisedwhen they see who's actually sittingin it, I should imagine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then obviously I have to ask, the hovercraft. Yeah.<eos> I am a huge fan of hovercrafts, because they are the most funyou can have with an engine,I'm convinced.<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> I was told the first time I ever went on one - and you must have experienced this - if you actually see an obstacle,if y ou can see it,you will hit it.

It was the, uh, the missing...<eos> No, that's not it. The enchanted...<eos> The lost treasure of the Golden Squirrel.<eos> Yes!<eos> Lost treasure!<eos> Eh, this is real treasure, right?<eos> Not one of those "friendship is the greatest treasure of all" deals?<eos> Because you can't trade friendship for, you know, the goods and the services.<eos> Hidden clues will guide you.<eos> Now that the key has been exposed, you must find the treasure and destroy it!
Hidden clues will guide you.<eos> Now that the key has been exposed, you must find the treasure and destroy it!<eos> There, you see? We must use the key to find the treasure and...<eos> Wait.<eos> Did you say, "Destroy the treasure?" Not, "Spend it all as fast as possible?"<eos> You must follow me.<eos> There isn't much time.<eos> Ho-o-old on. Why would we go through all the trouble of finding that treasure if we're just gonna destroy it?<eos> That does seem illogical.<eos> If the treasure is so dangerous, why not just leave it hidden?
I guess we can chock that up as the surprise ending.<eos> You call that an ending?<eos> A proper ending is supposed to be emotionally satisfying.<eos> Yeah, well I'm just satisfied that it's over.<eos> Ugh, and how.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gah, if I never hear another word about treasures or clues, or, huh?<eos> No time to explain.<eos> This is the legendary feather of the Crystal Falcon.<eos> Guard it with your life.
Approaching right turn.<eos> Turn left.<eos> Turn left.<eos> Oh, Lady, you are not helping.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Where are you going? Where are you going?<eos> Watch out! Whoa!<eos> Is that blank general enough for you?<eos> Well, I brought Patrick Zelman's wedding ring, like you asked.<eos> Place it on the table.
It's true.<eos> After that, I don't think he could get a read.<eos> So he would...<eos> Steer my sessions towards my work and then try to prompt me to give him information.<eos> And you know this because...<eos> I was suspicious, so I went back and listened to his readings. The tapes were all conveniently blank.<eos> But the only way I could know for sure was to give him false information...<eos> And then see if he took it.<eos> So I sort of let it slip that...<eos> A drug was getting approval when I knew that we were going to deny it.
And he goes on to say why he'd killed Dr. Newhall for losing all his money in a stock deal.<eos> But he didn't get a chance to kill Dr. Newhall... Or himself, did he?<eos> But you see...<eos> I was right.<eos> I saved a life.<eos> By taking one?<eos> Oh, no. I'm sorry. Two?<eos> I mean, it is just two, right?<eos> There's not someone else's body out there we don't know about?<eos> You know the difference between a psychic that sees the future and a psychic that tries to change it?
Mr. Garza, I am so sorry, sir.<eos> We appreciate you being here defending one of our own.<eos> You two need anything?<eos> - No, we're fine.<eos> You gentlemen have a good night.<eos> Like I said, man, we are two different people.<eos> That thing just bother you, Cyrus?<eos> Not worth getting arrested.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look, man, we started this case together, so I'm gonna finish it with you.
Suen Ho and Ching Shau Wah.<eos> They did arrest criminals with supernatural power before.<eos> Just let them take control.<eos> Suen Ho, we count on you.<eos> After the case is closed... you will be paid double.<eos> How's that?<eos> Much powerful than the last one.<eos> So what?<eos> Old man, look at this diamond ring... it's much bigger than the one we ordered.<eos> Take it then.
It hasn't been that peaceful for a long time.<eos> Did you say you want to buy a house by the sea and have a peaceful life?<eos> Alright.<eos> Just buy a house when we arrested the mutants.<eos> Do you remember tomorrow is a special date?<eos> Our wedding plan, you missed the appointment again.<eos> Tai.<eos> I'm really confident this time.<eos> We've found out their weakness.<eos> I'll fix it soon.
If you are reading this it means I am no longer with you and that you are now the keeper of my most important secret, something dangerous that must never fall into the wrong hands and there are those who will want to take it from you.<eos> I cannot even take the chance of explaining what it truly is in this letter lest anyone else get a hold of it.<eos> So follow my words carefully.<eos> First learn, then protect.<eos> I know this is puzzling but when you are open to discovery the answer will be left.<eos> I trust you above all others because you never leave anything incomplete.<eos> A plant?<eos> Someone almost burned down the doom rooms to steal shrubbery.<eos> Dante's letter is what was important.<eos> I didn't even finish reading it.
I was the same way after I lost the baby.<eos> I finally went to a therapist.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Did it help?<eos> - It did.<eos> In fact, she had me do something you might want to try.<eos> Write Grace a letter.<eos> A letter?<eos> You don't send it.
And you were right.<eos> He... he doesn't believe in pharmaceuticals.<eos> He only prescribes stuff that's totally herbal and natural.<eos> That is fantastic.<eos> So what did he suggest?<eos> Medical marijuana.<eos> Yes,<eos> Tom Scavo had been battling depression, but he was now facing a much bigger battle with his wife.<eos> Happiness... it's something we all want, and so we search for it.<eos> Little girls find it in the taste of chocolate.

We don't know anything about them!<eos> And you have no idea what you've started here!<eos> Mommy!<eos> Coming, sweetie!<eos> If this ends badly,<eos> I will never forgive you.<eos> I mean it, Gabrielle.<eos> We're done.<eos> Happiness... it's something everyone searches for.<eos> Some are sure they'll find it once they've moved back home.

Girls, come on.<eos> Mrs. Solis is here.<eos> Hi, sweetie.<eos> You and Grace have a good time?<eos> It was okay.<eos> What are you smiling about?<eos> I found out something about Grace today.<eos> She's a thief.<eos> What... What are you doing with that?<eos> She stole your necklace, so I stole it back.
Now I ask you, wouldn't it be nice as adults to have a do-over every now and then?<eos> Who wants to be free of lies and hypocrisy and be reborn and begin again today?<eos> Who wants a do-over?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Have mercy.<eos> Speak up, and let the congregation pray for your sins.<eos> Pray for me, that I may be patient and accept my son for who he is.<eos> Amen.<eos> Pray for me.<eos> I called bingo last week even though I didn't have it, 'cause I knew nobody was coming to check the cards.
She looks good in a helmet.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Ugh, that's fifth.<eos> These BLEEP English gears.<eos> They're Korean, actually.<eos> To be honest, they're Korean gears.<eos> Sorry, Stig, totally BLEEP it up.<eos> He's never heard that word. No?<eos> He doesn't know it exists.<eos> Now, did you keep it in the lines?
Couldn't you have just put the mirror down nice and gentle?<eos> I was in a mood.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Don't get that.<eos> It could be important.<eos> This is important.<eos> Right now, we are more important than what's going on at the hospital.<eos> I say we turn off our phones and...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll go turn it off.
Uh, so she has you dog whispering?<eos> Small price to pay.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Hale told us when the silver pieces started coming in, we know Alex's M.O., and I created this.<eos> You named Alex "the silver burglar"?<eos> All right, I admit it lacks a certain flair.<eos> But it makes the point.<eos> It includes the police reports for the stolen items, and I've added just enough FBI research to connect the dots.<eos> Uh, your file's a tad too nice to have been floating around the bureau.<eos> So we age it.
Yours.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> No, it really is yours.<eos> You left it on the hood of your car.<eos> Oh.<eos> My head's in 50 places.<eos> Masuka didn't even begin to keep up the case load.<eos> Well, good luck getting the midget porn off your hard drive.<eos> He might have shown it to me.
Thank you.<eos> Maybe this is one problem I can check off the list.<eos> Welcome to Miami.<eos> I've always tried to keep the different parts of my life separate.<eos> Becoming a father made that much more difficult.<eos> And as a husband, I failed.<eos> But I'm a very neat monster...<eos> Who won't make the same mistake again.<eos> I packed up Rita's wedding dress.<eos> I thought Astor might want it someday.
How's this?<eos> I tried to send this woman 1,500 miles away, and she boomeranged back into the house I shared with Rita.<eos> Lumen?<eos> So much for keeping the different parts of my life separate.<eos> Sorry, I'll just be in here.<eos> There are towels...<eos> Somewhere.<eos> I found some in a box.<eos> I also found this robe.<eos> Is it okay if I borrow it?
Oh, and I have something for you.<eos> Jim, you got it back.<eos> Cops found it at the scene.<eos> Someone threw the bad guys off their game.<eos> I'm not saying who.<eos> You know, I never told you this, but that ring has got to be<eos> - the ugliest ring I've ever seen in my life - No, it's not.<eos> - Absolutely. It absolutely is.<eos> - Jim, I love this ring.<eos> When I bought it for you, I was an artist barely getting by.
- Jim, I love this ring.<eos> When I bought it for you, I was an artist barely getting by.<eos> The only ring I could afford was<eos> - the smallest, ugliest ring in the store.<eos> - It's not ugly.<eos> And when I got down on my knee and I proposed, you looked at it and you said,<eos> "That's the most beautiful thing I've ever seen."<eos> And I knew...<eos> I knew right then I had the right girl.<eos> And every time I see it on your finger, I know you love me for who I am.
Hello, Miss Lahan.<eos> It's reception.<eos> We have an urgent message for you to call John on 07700 900 785.<eos> Thank you...<eos> PHONE RINGS Someone's ringing back.<eos> Must be her.<eos> Gotcha!<eos> Albany's under here.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I put it there.
It's not where, it's when.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, when I worked scuba, we'd occasionally come across a condition called delayed drowning.<eos> Right, when liquid seeps into the lungs and the victim doesn't realize it.<eos> Yeah, we'd pick people from the canal... they'd be walking, talking.<eos> Three hours later, they were dead.<eos> They drowned.<eos> The champagne goes into the stomach.<eos> A bodily reaction happens that sends it into the lungs.
Your eyes were crystal clear.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Yeah, I can move things around.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I was doing drywall work in queens... a restaurant... after hours mostly, off the books.<eos> I've been held up twice on my way home.<eos> I can't afford to lose the cash I've been making.<eos> The gun was for protection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where'd you get it?
So you drew.<eos> Yes, but when Richards started hurting people, I told him I wouldn't do it anymore.<eos> So he got mad.<eos> He grabbed my dad and told me that if I didn't draw this place by 5:00, he was gonna kill him.<eos> Why this place?<eos> I know he tried to buy it recently.<eos> Well, that would explain why he tried to collect all that money so suddenly from Wallace.<eos> And why Joe Santomauro, his real estate agent, got punished when he couldn't make the deal happen.<eos> And so if Richards couldn't buy this place...<eos> He's gonna use her drawings to destroy it.
Maybe they're gonna promote one of you.<eos> I'll leave now.<eos> You should give it back to her now, whatever it is.<eos> So, uh, last night's...<eos> Thing, um, it's off the table.<eos> Yeah, definitely.<eos> But I was thinking, what if neither of us takes the promotion?<eos> Well, maybe last night only happened because something's about to change.<eos> Or maybe last night is more important than a promotion.<eos> If you turn down the promotion and he offers it to me, I'll take it.
What are you doing?<eos> Making a phone call.<eos> Okay.<eos> Damn it!<eos> We're too far from shore.<eos> Not a bad idea.<eos> Would have been better if you'd thought of it... when we were in the harbor.<eos> - I'm gonna send a text.<eos> - With no signal.<eos> I'm not gonna send it from here.
There's a slight improvement here, Mark.<eos> Keep... Keep trying.<eos> Have you seen my...?<eos> Ah!<eos> I just wanted to see what all the fuss was about.<eos> What was so great about memory lane.<eos> I didn't want you to find out.<eos> God, I'm such an idiot.<eos> I should have left that stupid letter in the house.<eos> Or burned it, or...
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry too.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't want us to be like this. I...<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> What?<eos> Where's your wedding ring?<eos> Oh!<eos> I lost it. I...
I'm sorry too.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't want us to be like this. I...<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> What?<eos> Where's your wedding ring?<eos> Oh!<eos> I lost it. I...<eos> I took it off...

You always land on your feet.<eos> You do, I don't know, you're just...<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Maybe my luck's just run out.<eos> No.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Breakfast, my treat.<eos> OK, I'm not dating.<eos> I'm not seeing anyone.<eos> I lost my ring. And then I found it.
Mm. Mm-hmm.<eos> Stay out of my purse.<eos> Come on, you big freakin' goon!<eos> Allergies?<eos> Allergies, alice?<eos> It's none of your business.<eos> What are you doing, really?<eos> Nothing yet, ok?<eos> My wrist is healed, but it's weak.<eos> If I hit it wrong, it hurts.

Go ahead.<eos> You wanna get married, get married.<eos> For whatever reason or no reason at all.<eos> I will.<eos> Go.<eos> Maybe after I go over to Grace's.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pick out the ring first.<eos> That's the important thing... picking out the ring.<eos> That and trying to put it on the finger of your best friend's ex-girlfriend because he screwed up your life by getting your girlfriend pregnant before she was even your girlfriend.
God. And then you know, uh, she started spewing...<eos> This gunk.<eos> "gunk"?<eos> Let's try to be a tad more specific, okay?<eos> Conspiracy stuff, man.<eos> Okay, she thoughsomeone was using the gangs and the taggers<eos> To force people out of their homes-<eos> You know, corporate developers or something. I don't know, man.<eos> You know, she said she had proof,<eos> But I never saw any of it.
Tell me about it.<eos> Maybe I can help you get back with her.<eos> Boss, I'm at Makani's address.<eos> When I badged him, he tried to rabbit.<eos> Didn't get real far.<eos> What did he tell you about Dawkins?<eos> Makani runs a fake I.D. Mill out of the back of his shop.<eos> Dawkins was in here about an hour ago.<eos> He picked up a driver's license and a passport, under the name Carl Isner.<eos> Update HPD on the new alias, and make sure Homeland Security adds it to the no-fly list.
Well, you and I both know that the charges will never stick.<eos> Yeah, maybe not, but it's going to take your firm at least 24 hours to get a lawyer here from Los Angeles.<eos> I'm gonna make sure that you spend that time in jail.<eos> Book him, Danno.<eos> You know, I got to be honest.<eos> I actually didn't mind that one.<eos> Really? Yeah.<eos> Move.<eos> You saved a girl's life today. Just doing the job you hired me for.<eos> Maybe so, but I made a promise to a friend and... you let me keep it.
Or marsh, to be exact.<eos> Marsh, as in mangroves?<eos> Yeah, the sale just went though the county assessor's office on Monday.<eos> Monday -- the day before he was killed.<eos> 20 acres of worthless swamp.<eos> Only worthless if Johnny's guess was wrong.<eos> The no-see-um bites that almost killed him, not spending money on boat fuel -- you know what?<eos> He was onto something that suggested the treasure is not at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> It's buried in the mangroves.<eos> But without a map or specific coordinates, he'd have to dig a million holes just to find it. Mm.
It's the same hair, the same eyes.<eos> Only in this one, they're smiling and bright because she was totally in love with him.<eos> With a bloodthirsty pirate?<eos> The bad boy, yeah.<eos> And he was totally in love with her.<eos> That's why he had this etching made, so that he could take it with him out to Sea and have her with him always.<eos> Okay, so, she's trapped in a loveless marriage.<eos> They plan the kidnapping and theft together?<eos> Right, and probably bury the treasure in a place where only they know about.<eos> But they were killed before they could go back, get it, and run off together.
Oh, you know, when I'm trying to get up early for a tee time.<eos> Of course, uh... If we don't give this to the proper authorities, we will actually be the bad guys.<eos> Could you live with that?<eos> Too bad you're never gonna find out.<eos> Friends of yours?<eos> Suspects, actually.<eos> That's Johnny's partner.<eos> That's his Spanish lawyer.<eos> They killed Johnny for the treasure.<eos> Only we didn't know where it was till you found it for us.
I said, I know you were over at Amy's.<eos> Grace told me.<eos> Yes, I was over there, and now I'm here.<eos> You want the ring back.<eos> Yeah, the ring.<eos> How is the ring?<eos> It's, um, still the ring.<eos> The same gigantic, beautiful sparkly ring that you gave to me.<eos> I'm happy you like it.<eos> I love it.
I want to give her a ring because I want people to think... we're...<eos> Pregnant?<eos> You don't need a ring for that.<eos> I mean, she's gonna be showing soon.<eos> I mean, if you wanna give her a ring just to give her a ring, then do what your dad did for me and get her a real gigantic one.<eos> You know, give her the biggest ring you can find.<eos> Look at mine.<eos> This ring makes me so happy.<eos> And you know what?<eos> If your father ever dies, I can sell it, and, well, I can probably live off it the rest of my life.

And she's gonna have a little Boykewich.<eos> Or, you know, a Girlkewich.<eos> You know? Get it?<eos> A Girlkewich.<eos> Oh, gosh.<eos> I love words, you know?<eos> If I hadn't ended up being a hooker, I'd probably be a writer.<eos> You are quite the wordsmith.<eos> Oh, I want you to take that ring.<eos> That's very generous, but I'm not sure that Adrian would give it back, so...
What happened?<eos> Everything's okay, right, with you and the baby?<eos> Yeah, everything's fine, but we should talk about this.<eos> Look, it's a beautiful ring, but maybe not such a beautiful gesture.<eos> You know, the two of us getting fake engaged with the fake engagement ring.<eos> It's not a fake ring.<eos> It's a real ring.<eos> It's a real sapphire ring given to Betty by a real count.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah, it was Betty's, and she gave it to me to give to you.
No.<eos> Well, that proves it was arson.<eos> I mean, not the tuna, but this stuff.<eos> I'm so sorry, Sam.<eos> This is excellent forensics work, but you're not authorized.<eos> Not being part of the department, a judge is just gonna rule it inadmissible.<eos> Yes, her findings are inadmissible, but surely it's enough to stretch it to probable cause?<eos> And since when do you care so much... about helping your Uncle, Jack?<eos> I don't.<eos> But a crime was committed, and Dan and I need to investigate it.
I will cut you off.<eos> This is not a laughing matter.<eos> Okay.<eos> I hear you.<eos> So, what do you know about this, uh... This... Fella?<eos> A couple years ago, okay, this psycho, whose name I will not mention, he burned down my cousin's garage twice.<eos> He literally came back, like, after the fire department put out the fire.<eos> He set fire to the burned building.<eos> All right?<eos> He double-burned it.
I found donepezil and flashcards in the medicine cabinet.<eos> Donepezil?<eos> Alzheimer's?<eos> It's a cholinesterase inhibitor.<eos> It improves acetylcholine, either by increasing levels in the brain or enhancing nerve cells' response to it.<eos> So this guy gets to forgot while the family has to live with this forever.<eos> Alzheimer's affects short-term memory before it affects long-term.<eos> That it explains the scripted phone calls and the dump sites.<eos> It also explains why he started up again.<eos> He's repeating his last kill because he can't remember it.
I let the team fracture.<eos> So, for that, yeah. I deserve to be replaced.<eos> I make a motion to call a no-confidence vote in our captain.<eos> Do I have a second?<eos> Second.<eos> Is the video really that bad?<eos> The moves weren't there.<eos> But the worst part was is that it wasn't fun to watch.<eos> There was no heart, no joy.<eos> Can't we redo it?
She's going back to her first mission.<eos> Her first kill.<eos> Got a bead on her yet?<eos> Well, she took on Tonya in Manhattan.<eos> Uh, 27th street fashion district.<eos> Am I missing something here?<eos> Why would Nikita follow up on a kill<eos> She made 6 years ago?<eos> The case is way closed.<eos> Maybe she's re-opening it.
Sometimes I think shame, but mostly fear.<eos> If they ever build another Death Star, there's a... captain's chair with your name on it.<eos> Is that a management position?<eos> You're always on time.<eos> You really know the catalog.<eos> The one thing that I'd like you to work on... is being more assertive.<eos> We can do that?<eos> Okay, ask me for something And be assertive.<eos> It would be nice if you could say my name correctly.<eos> I've been mispronouncing it the whole time?
Insurance industry works great if you never actually get sick.<eos> Well, that ship has sailed.<eos> Have we heard anything from that clinical trial?<eos> I mean, those babies are free, right?<eos> They are, yeah, and I'll let you know as soon as I hear.<eos> So when are you proposing to her?<eos> How did you...<eos> how did you know?<eos> There's an engagement ring on your laptop.<eos> So either you've just removed it from someone's colon, or you're popping the question.
Job done!<eos> I did what you said.<eos> I let it play out.<eos> Me and Curtis... We're over.<eos> Hi!<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> I've got his heart.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean, when he died, they ripped his heart out and stuck it in me.
I should warn you.<eos> If you value your lives, do not even think about laughing.<eos> Father?<eos> I'm behind the screen.<eos> Only an enchantment could cause Uther to lose his hair like that.<eos> I have no doubt that goblin is to blame.<eos> We must catch it before it does any real damage.<eos> Did you see Uther's face?<eos> Merlin, what do you think Uther will do to the person responsible for releasing the goblin?<eos> We need to catch it.
Well, I've learned not to get too attached To amy's boyfriends.<eos> - She plays the field.<eos> - It's more like the field plays her.<eos> Any man that comes along, She just follows like a lost puppy.<eos> - Does terry keep anything in the house?<eos> - Well, he brought his suitcase With presents for amy.<eos> - You mind if we have a look?<eos> - Please.<eos> That dress is one of the presents.<eos> Amy refuses to model it.
Nick, give me your phone.<eos> I'll turn it off!<eos> I'll turn it off!<eos> Nick, one more thing.<eos> Stop it!<eos> So, my paralegal files a notice of erotica, instead of a notice of errata.<eos> No!<eos> Yes.<eos> In federal court.<eos> They posted it all over the courthouse!
Just go with it, henry.<eos> Just go with<eos> "this is completely impossible"?<eos> Exactly.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I have no idea,<eos> But this is a power and technology<eos> Beyond anything we've ever known.<eos> Do you think it exists?<eos> Well, if it does, we have to find it,
The ferropodous has hatched.<eos> Two days ahead of schedule?<eos> Judging by the placental viscosity,<eos> I just missed it by minutes.<eos> But how?<eos> Faulty air conditioning, I think.<eos> The vault was like a hot house.<eos> It would have sped up the natural incubation.<eos> Which is why the egg in Monte Carlo popped early, too. Exactly.<eos> We need to keep it cool.
All right.<eos> Mr. St. Pierre, you wanted to see me?<eos> 10 minutes ago!<eos> What's the status?<eos> Things are progressing nicely.<eos> No, they're not.<eos> We should have been long gone by now.<eos> The suit's natural resistance...<eos> I know about the suit's natural resistance, Ray.<eos> You said the machine could overcome it.
Previously on Sanctuary...<eos> I have spent my adult life working with abnormals, and now I am one.<eos> My father never gave me a gift without significance.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Do you think it exists?<eos> If it does, we have to find it.
Learning it, yes?<eos> What we can.<eos> It's very complex.<eos> Have you grown stupid?<eos> Key stones.<eos> Location.<eos> Coordinates.<eos> We've been studying the map, but honestly, we've found nothing about any key stones.<eos> Oh, Gregory!<eos> He sends you this glorious message, and you don't even receive it properly.
Adam?<eos> Adam, talk to me.<eos> Sorry, the lad's not interested.<eos> Let me talk to him!<eos> It was just an idea.<eos> I wasn't sure that would work.<eos> I learned so much before they shut us away.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> Time is like paper.<eos> You can fold it up any way you want.
Not in a million years.<eos> I thought tonight was gonna be awful, But it turned out to be really nice.<eos> Thanks, I think.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, it has been really nice.<eos> Could be again.<eos> Noah, this isn't a real date.<eos> What about the connection we have?<eos> We've always had?<eos> Don't tell me you don't still feel it.
I love my kids, but at the end of the day, I got nothing left and they're laying there like Clockwork Orange.<eos> I just wanna stop their ceaseless joy for life so I can watch Cash Cab and jack off and pass out.<eos> [AUDIENCE LAUGHING]<eos> I want the joy and challenge of ******* parenthood to end so I can go eat all the ice cream in the freezer that they have no idea is there.<eos> And it would break their hearts if they knew how much ice cream I keep in the house.<eos> It's like a restaurant. It's a disgusting amount of ice cream.<eos> And it's not for them.<eos> I never give them ice cream.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I wait till they're asleep and I eat it in their room above their beds in the dark.
Where did you get these tubes?<eos> - Oh, look at this board.<eos> - It's good.<eos> - I mean, look at my lineup.<eos> - I know.<eos> Ohh...<eos> I'm sorry, Miles Austin in the fifth?<eos> Stop roster-bating, please.<eos> You can't just masturbate to your lineup in public.<eos> Kevin, you're just jealous 'cause you took a big shit in the pool and put it up on the board.
What?<eos> Nothing. Heh.<eos> You ignored my note, didn't you?<eos> A note?<eos> What note?<eos> You mean like a musical note?<eos> You fools!<eos> Destroyer of Worlds will kill us all!<eos> I have an idea, but I need time.<eos> Distract it!
we were supposed to be a team today.<eos> And then you just turned on me?<eos> I'm not used to failing.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> I know you think recommending him<eos> Was the wrong decision.<eos> I'm sorry, but I just...<eos> Didn't agree. Cristina, in a case like this, The right decision...<eos> Is making a decision. That's what we do.<eos> That's the job. You formed an opinion and you argued for it.
But I do have Josh Cribbs, Cleveland Browns' kick returner?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Terrell Suggs is my wish.<eos> Yeah, well, my wish was for a house on Nantucket and the respect of my peers, but we get what we get.<eos> You're from Baltimore, huh?<eos> Yup.<eos> You watch The Wire?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, show's brutal.<eos> You should check it out on Blu-ray.
You're both...<eos> Wait.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Long-term relationships are based on compatibility, and right now we only have sex.<eos> House, you don't actually think she'd dump you because you, what, don't do yoga ?<eos> Listen to the B-52s ?<eos> Not right away.<eos> We'll fight, makeup sex, fight, maybe sex, and then she'll dump me.<eos> With possible goodbye sex.<eos> So, instead of enjoying the honeymoon phase, you've decided to skip it entirely.
All conviction's equally ridiculous ?<eos> Just when they're applied indiscriminately to all circumstances.<eos> He needs to see his daughter.<eos> He needs to see inherit the wind.<eos> And tell her he's dying because God doesn't want him to take his medicine.<eos> Honesty's not all bad.<eos> Get her in here.<eos> You don't have to die, not if you take their medicine.<eos> The treatment violates God's laws.<eos> He doesn't want me to take it.
Oh, I guess this isn't The only pda in the office.<eos> My advice-- Get a room other than the break room.<eos> What?<eos> Wait, what--what's the problem?<eos> Todd, bollywood movies don't even show kissing.<eos> - Seriously? - No kissing And certainly no fondling.<eos> To them, this is like pornography.<eos> The video was that offensive?<eos> Todd, I don't know.<eos> I would have to see it again.

They were all friends of mine.<eos> There are 180 in all.<eos> All friends of yours?<eos> That's a whole lot.<eos> Yeah, 180.<eos> Nice number, huh?<eos> It sure is.<eos> Trust me, numbers are important.<eos> We all have one.<eos> If you give me a photo, I'll post it.
Is that all?<eos> Tell me again what happened.<eos> Why are you filming?<eos> - Just like that.<eos> Your chair moved itself?<eos> Last night.<eos> When I went to sleep, I left the chair beside the bed.<eos> And when I woke up it was by the window.<eos> Wow strange.<eos> Did you move it?
Jason?<eos> What is going on?<eos> How...<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> You called it in.<eos> No, I didn't!<eos> You called 911 to report a murder.<eos> You said it was your own murder, and that we would find your body here.<eos> Easy, Jason.<eos> I just found it.
Why does he keep calling you "Lips"?<eos> It's a nickname.<eos> Oh...<eos> Let's go!<eos> I'm thirsty.<eos> Rush 1: I can get it for you, sir, if you want.<eos> Oh, "I could get it for you, sir, if you want."<eos> No, I don't want.<eos> What I want is for Lips to get me a beer.<eos> When Lips gets it, it's colder, it tastes better.
You have no idea what you put us through today.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - What were you even thinking<eos> - running off like that? - Shoplifting?<eos> That figures.<eos> We didn't steal anything.<eos> I swear.<eos> I just tried on a ring and forgot about it.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I gave it back.
Come on, Graham.<eos> You got to give me something, man.<eos> You got to show me a little good will.<eos> At least-at least let me check on this guy before he bleeds out.<eos> Fine.<eos> Clean him up.<eos> Empty your pockets and your purses.<eos> Don't do anything!<eos> Look at the bleeding here.<eos> I got to stop it,
I need to speak with Detective Flack right away!<eos> Mr. Harris.<eos> What happened?<eos> He called again.<eos> When?<eos> Elizabeth had a voice mail on her phone when we got home.<eos> Where is your wife now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I need you to tell me exactly what was said on that message.<eos> I only heard it once.
What's going on with that copter?<eos> It's the 43rd floor, Melvin.<eos> Helicopters happen.<eos> Well, it could be the cops.<eos> Focus, Melvin.<eos> The gun.<eos> I was just hoping you'd hold it for me, you know. Just in case I get pinched.<eos> You come into my apartment unannounced, and drop a murder weapon on my $10,000 coffee table?<eos> Well, I just thought, you know, 'cause you're my lawyer, that you could, you know, you could do something...<eos> Stash it for you?
Like...<eos> Looking at a big expanse of dirt and seeing what it could become.<eos> That's the kind of thing I should be putting in, right?<eos> Mm-mm.<eos> Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sorry, it's been a while since I wrote an essay.<eos> No, it's okay. It's totally... it's fine.<eos> And I mean it's always good to have someone else read it.
You know, there's only so much ritual inversion a girl can take.<eos> Well, you followed your impulses today and that led you to have some new experiences.<eos> Like being rejected.<eos> Let me tell you, that was a lot of fun.<eos> Erica, do you know what lies at the root of impulse?<eos> Stupidity?<eos> No.<eos> Do, desire.<eos> Desire, it's the fuel that drives us, right.<eos> I mean, it's at the core of who we are, and yet, from our very earliest days, we're taught to control it.

Okay, are there or aren't there snakes?<eos> ! Who mentioned snakes?<eos> ! And stop shouting!<eos> You're scaring Cottontail.<eos> You named the rabbit?<eos> You took longer to get here than I thought, we bonded, I'm keeping her.<eos> The point is, you now have a chance to design your own building.<eos> Dude, you can do whatever you want with it.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're right. I can design it however I want.
Okay, so day 1, Kelly's abducted.<eos> Day 2, the media gets a photo of her.<eos> Day 3, her body's found here posed.<eos> This all feels orchestrated.<eos> Well, if you orchestrated all of this, wouldn't you want to see it?<eos> Why else leave a body here?<eos> I'll get one of my men to film the crowd.<eos> Morgan, isn't this crime scene sealed off?<eos> There's someone in here.<eos> The air must have dislodged it. Otherwise I'd have seen it.
Whoa!<eos> Whoa!<eos> No! No!<eos> I want this place cleared out.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - Mr. Cavanaugh, shut it down. No, you can't do that.<eos> I have buyers from here to Dallas waiting for their shipments.<eos> This is my crime scene, and I need to process it.
That's not what the evidence says.<eos> So you found sugar dust.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Did you find excessive concentrations?<eos> No. But we will.<eos> I doubt that, since I have a state-of-the-art ventilation system that draws dust out all day, and a fail-safe door that stays open 24-7.<eos> And who exactly was responsible for that door staying open?<eos> An employee whose only job is to stand sentry.<eos> Okay. I want his name.<eos> It's in my computer. Go get it.
Jay?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> !<eos> (panting): You little...<eos> Did your uncle help you dispose of the body?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did that all by myself.<eos> DANVILLE: Why'd you decide to go and dig up your mother's body?<eos> I was, uh, reading in the papers that the city was planning on expanding a... a bike path into that area of the park, and I was...<eos> I was just afraid that they would uncover the body, so I went there to move it.
Vic...<eos> Shane... could it have been "vig"?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Mr. Wolfe, listen to me.<eos> Webb's phone record.<eos> See who he's been calling this morning.<eos> So, Webb made a phone call to a land line that's registered to this address.<eos> I talked to the manager of the building.<eos> He said Webb rented it under his company's name.
It can never come to anything.<eos> I'd like to think it was possible, but Arthur can't change 200 years of history, no matter how much he may want to.<eos> I know.<eos> I think my brain is going to burst, or my eyes just pop out of their sockets.<eos> Well, don't make a mess over THIS one.<eos> Why?<eos> Is it any more useful than any of the others?<eos> It's the last one we've looked at and by the ancient law of sod it must provide the answer.<eos> There is this potion, created long ago by the Witches of Meredor, which, if I am right, will force the faerie out of the girl.<eos> I have no idea how to make it.
Look, guys, let us work this out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Just confirming our girl's got 9,000 lives.<eos> Our girl?<eos> Nikita.<eos> Status?<eos> She's probably using a multi-frequency jammer.<eos> I can't track it from here.<eos> The on-site Agent needs to find the device And disable it by hand.
instead of having an actual life.<eos> And you'd be still working call center jobs.<eos> It's not easy - it's not supposed to be.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't!<eos> You have a solution staring at you in the face, but instead of grabbing it, you're telling us all how it's beneath you.<eos> You... you know what?<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> You want us to give you permission to take the interview, so take it.
Again?<eos> - You're not out of trumps?<eos> Um, pardon me.<eos> I just wanted to show you the changes I made to the dress.<eos> Will you try it on now, or later?<eos> Leave it that way. Don't continue.<eos> But it's almost finished.<eos> I've been sewing all night...<eos> - Leave it there.<eos> I'm taking it to the capital to have it finished.
Please, just spare me a few minutes of your time, sister.<eos> My lady?<eos> It's all right, Gwen.<eos> I won't be a moment.<eos> We must be quick, sister, this enchantment will not hold for long.<eos> Tell me, what has Arthur chosen as his quest?<eos> He sets out tomorrow for the Perilous Lands.<eos> How perfect.<eos> Present this to the Prince as a token of your good wishes.<eos> When the time is right, you must make a likeness of the Prince and bind it to the gift using the skills that I taught you.
And there is no middle ground.<eos> You're gonna lose all of our money.<eos> Only if he fails.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Ryan, I believe in you.<eos> Just like I believe in all of you.<eos> You have nine days to save everybody's money.<eos> Oh... That's a lot of pressure.<eos> I... I'm gonna need some more time.<eos> You can't have it. Okay.
Strength fitness, sex power, dance aggression, windsurfing.<eos> Uh?<eos> They're very lucky to have you.<eos> Okay, everyone, we have a new member joining us today.<eos> Quagle, would you like to introduce yourself?<eos> If you wish to avoid demise, you must conjure my name within three tries.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> He's pulling a rumpelstiltskin.<eos> Your name is quagle.<eos> Mark said it, like, five seconds ago.
Zoey?<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> You have got to be kidding me.<eos> So, what are we protesting tonight?<eos> Rising cost of jet fuel?<eos> The government's oppressive top hat and monocle tax?<eos> And what are you doing here?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Beautiful old building...<eos> you're here to knock it down.
Mmm. Ah, this Scotch is good.<eos> How's your drink?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> We are two grown adults standing among the greatest collection of natural artifacts in the Western hemisphere, and look at what we're doing.<eos> You're right.<eos> Want to go touch a bunch of stuff?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> So, Captain.<eos> How'd you get that name, anyway?<eos> Gave it to myself.
- Oh, hey, Russell.<eos> My mother, Evelyn. My brother, Alan.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Can I interest you folks in a codeine popsicle?<eos> It's my own invention.<eos> I think we're good.<eos> You suck on one of these, you'll be great.<eos> I call it "springtime on a stick."
Well, I had a breakthrough.<eos> The breakthrough had nothing to do with schwarzkopf.<eos> - Of course it did.<eos> - Think about it.<eos> All that stuff you said about schwarzkopf, that you were neglectful, that you wished you'd been a better parent, who do you think you were really talking about?<eos> Schwarzkopf!<eos> Go deeper.<eos> [deep voice] Schwarzkopf.<eos> Answer me this.<eos> When you lay down at night in your bed, before you take out your heart and put it in its jar, do you ever have any remorse about the way you treated vince when he was a kid?
I was made redundant six months ago.<eos> A perfect example of interconnectedness.<eos> An obese American fails to pay his mortgage, the ripples cross the ocean, you are cast onto the slagheap of the long-term unemployed.<eos> Is all that meant to make me feel better?<eos> How are you managing? Hmm?<eos> I mean, financially.<eos> There was a very generous redundancy package.<eos> Was there?<eos> Yeah. Mmm.<eos> Mmm. Well, Macduff, we must ensure you do not fritter it away on some indulgent whim.
This is between me and "are they real?"<eos> The good news is<eos> I can always find a new fact checker.<eos> No, dickey, you can't fire her.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Henry, you really don't have to--<eos> No, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Look, I put the name in there as a joke for kim,<eos> And then I sent it to printing by mistake.
No!<eos> It's too steep. We'll have to go around.<eos> Give me my body back!<eos> No! Get off me!<eos> Get outta my body!<eos> you get outta the body, you worm!<eos> Aw, man, my mouth was open!<eos> Dude, we did it!<eos> I got my body back!<eos> Are you... sure you still... want it?
"I can see that it's a ball-achingly dull series."<eos> Have you ever... Has your balls ever ached from watching a program?<eos> Have you ever watched a program and gone, "Don't know if I'm enjoying this,<eos> "but me balls are aching.<eos> I hate it. This is the dullest thing.<eos> Oh, I'm gone."<eos> It doesn't...<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> His balls are aching 'cause the series is that dull.<eos> If tv that he doesn't like makes his balls ache, why didn't he turn it off quicker?
[ Shouts ]<eos> Did you learn anything from that, though?<eos> That was important training to make you able to cope if such a terrible thing did occur to you.<eos> If you go to places that you're in danger of being kidnapped, you're meant to have a code word so that when the people who've nicked you call up the London office...<eos> and the London office goes, "Yeah, yeah."<eos> "Give us your code word."<eos> Well, at the time, it was "congress tart."<eos> Congress tart?<eos> How are you gonna slip that into a conversation?<eos> No, you don't slip it in.
Honestly, no.<eos> We didn't stand a chance in hell.<eos> Damien moreau is done.<eos> "damien moreau, under investigation "for antiquities smuggling.<eos> "moreau linked to blood diamonds.<eos> Moreau assets in switzerland, germany, and bolivia seized."<eos> Last time anybody got this much press in the news, They had a nasty video out.<eos> What kind of video?<eos> I-I-I don't know.<eos> I did not watch it.
He's a wonderful man.<eos> One at a time.<eos> Yes, yes, I am also a schoolteacher.<eos> I teach underprivileged children...<eos> Hey, man. Hey, the feedback is great.<eos> I mean, online's going crazy for her.<eos> There's a hash tag on her.<eos> There's a bunch of phone videos going viral.<eos> What about her back story?<eos> I have to wait until she's done making it up, But I can graft one of her old I.D.S onto it.
It will help you in your cause.<eos> Lose a prosecution for murder, and a definitive precedent is set that slaves can be killed at will.<eos> But if I can prove the claim to be fraudulent, if I can prove the plea of necessity for those deaths to be false...<eos> Then the insurers' interests will be served.<eos> Yes, but more than that.<eos> In future, because of this case, they may find a better way to see those interests served by providing the least possible indemnity for slaves murdered in passage.<eos> Instead of £30 pounds for a Negro's head, they will only pay out £20?<eos> That is your idea of progress, Mr Garrow?<eos> If it will inhibit the murder of slaves, then yes.<eos> So you will inch towards justice and not demand it?
Well, he's braver than me, using magic in front of all those people.<eos> Brave or stupid?<eos> If Uther finds out, he'll have him killed.<eos> Argh...<eos> Hey!<eos> Sorcery.<eos> It is the only explanation.<eos> We must not jump to conclusions, sire.<eos> What other explanation could there be?<eos> The guards report seeing an unnaturally bright light, its heat was so intense they could feel it at the end of the corridor.
After killing all them devils... You rushed straight back here to Duoduo?<eos> You're saying I cant?<eos> I am a soldier of Huben now.<eos> Like a tiger, attacking forward.<eos> Sis.<eos> I have real men now.<eos> I'll leave this hunting rifle for you.<eos> Your Sis doesn't know how to use it.<eos> This hunting rifle was left by Father.<eos> I will help you take it then.
- So she refused it.<eos> - At least he leaves you alone now.<eos> Pauline is besotted with him.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> She'll soon stop worshipping the plant.<eos> But it's gone on for a while.<eos> And I have to go to Mexico for two weeks.<eos> I hate to leave her on these terms, especially over a plant.<eos> Have you thought of getting rid of it?<eos> No, if I chuck it out, Pauline will never forgive me.
I've missed you.<eos> You're...<eos> Merlin, we don't have long.<eos> Is it really you?<eos> I swore that one day I would repay you.<eos> Now is the moment.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> There is but one weapon that can slay something which is already dead.<eos> A blade forged in the dragon's breath.<eos> That weapon lies at the bottom of the Lake of Avalon, Where you hid it.
You know, they weren't even registering a sexual device in the room.<eos> Nothing was coming off them, right.<eos> And similarly, about a few weeks later I went to a doctor's appointment.<eos> I was checking with the doctor about stuff and I was chatting to him and I said, "will you do an MOT on me?<eos> "I'm in me late 30s now, Iet's see how I'm doing."<eos> So your man does a big test on me, runs a load of things and then comes back with a big, serious face on.<eos> I said, "What's wrong?" And he goes, "well, your cholesterol.<eos> "Your cholesterol is very high."<eos> Now, my cholesterol was ludicrous.<eos> Pick a number and double it type high.
You know what?<eos> I wanted to buy a condo at the shore.<eos> But my stupid husband says, "Put it in stocks."<eos> Yeah?<eos> Good one.<eos> Now you know how many dollars I got?<eos> I used to go get facials.<eos> Now, I go to the make-up and tell them I'm just going to a wedding.<eos> My daughter, she wants a flute for Christmas.<eos> Do you know how expensive it is? So I said to her, "Get a recorder, "hold it to the side, pretend it's a flute."
Sounds like a wonderful relationship.<eos> Oh, it was.<eos> We could have enjoyed each other for years,<eos> Jean-luc and i.<eos> If it wasn't for his chihuahua.<eos> Ah, yes. the chihuahua.<eos> Monstrous creature.<eos> Giant eyes, giant ears, The body of a rat and the bark of a demon.<eos> But jean-luc adored the flea-bitten mongrel.<eos> Let it sleep on the bed.
Looking at them will cleanse the mind of the beholder<eos> Who's work is this?<eos> Hyewon SHIN Yun-bok, Your Majesty<eos> Come forward<eos> Tell me... What is civility?<eos> Maintaining integrity and politeness and knowing one's obligations<eos> Is that all?<eos> Kuan Zhong of Qi said civility is one of four pillars constituting a nation<eos> If one is missing, nation will decline<eos> With two missing, it will be imperiled
to these chemicals that we get when we're eating meat.<eos> There are also other cancer causing chemicals found in meat processed products which are used as preservatives.<eos> We have quite a few epidemiologic studies that have looked at the relationship between consumption of beef and cancer risk.<eos> The one side where the relationship is seen most consistent is for colon rectal cancer.<eos> And in this case, there seems to be an overall association with red meat, but that relationship is particulary stron for processed meat, meaning sausage, bologna and hot dogs and those kinds of foods.<eos> According to professor Willet, the optimum amount of red meat we should consume is zero.<eos> Vegetables do not form heterocycle amins or any other carcinogens during cooking.<eos> Formation for heterocycle amins is a unique feature of animals, including fish and bird meats such as chickens and eggs.<eos> Fresh fruits and vegetables are mostly made of fiber.<eos> Fiber gives food its bulk and helps to move it faster through the digestivetrack.
She kept talking about death.<eos> She constantly claimed, at the tiniest thing... if I refused her or argued with her or did not listen to her, she would... pretend she was dying.<eos> Say, "I'm dying." and blame me for killing her.<eos> "Colonel von Schultz dismissed army morals "everyone obeyed her.<eos> "the punishment for the slightest dissidence was death.<eos> "Mike Baden was a prisoner, he knew that hesitation "might cost him his life or at least,; a public whipping<eos> "or a week of solitary confinement.<eos> "There was no sense in suffering.<eos> "He hated her. "<eos> A child absorbs this atmosphere and is affected by it, I must have been.
Here's your fat mouse.<eos> - It's a guinea pig, but...<eos> And you, young man...<eos> I want to hear all about this little Trisha Sparks next time I see you.<eos> Trisha Sparks is two years older than you.<eos> She's hot.<eos> I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.<eos> We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.<eos> This rock and roll idea of yours is old hat.<eos> Well, sir, I had every intention of putting our own spin on it.
Get out of the way!<eos> Miss, please back away three steps<eos> Miss, please step back<eos> You...<eos> This tree is mine...<eos> Aunty!<eos> You wanted to get rid of it and that peasant even gave you some money for it, therefore...<eos> Yes?<eos> I'll give you 10 times that much.<eos> Please don't sell it
I'm fine.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Okay, I'm coming up.<eos> Give me back my baby!<eos> Mistletoe.<eos> Mistletoe.<eos> I can't believe I nailed that baby's head. I feel kind of bad about that.<eos> That's my brother's kid. You couldn't have possibly blown it's, IQ. It's fine.<eos> I did get it to stop crying there for a second.<eos> I think it kind of liked me.
Honey, I want you to feel comfortable to talk to me about anything you want to talk about.<eos> Unless there's like, you know a play-off's game or something like that.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> We can find an appropriate time. - I'm kidding.<eos> Kind of.<eos> - Okay, babe.<eos> Listen, just to be clear, this doesn't mean that we're getting married right away or having kids right away.<eos> just means that we're open to let love grow where it wants to grow.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - We're open to letting it grow.
I promise you this will be our final confrontation.<eos> Sure you can do better.<eos> As you wish.<eos> What the fu...<eos> It's from the trunk.<eos> The book!<eos> Destroy the book.<eos> Flinn is alone with the book.<eos> I stab it.....wait.... I backstab it!<eos> You can't backstab it....you can't sneak attack an inanimate object!
Hebe!<eos> All right, I'm back.<eos> It better be good. Here.<eos> Come on, dude, say something.<eos> You know what?<eos> I did knee an Indian guy in the balls.<eos> That's funny!<eos> Yeah, send them Indians back to Africa.<eos> Well, you want to hear something real fucked-up and awesome that I did?<eos> I took a Korean guy's toothbrush and I rubbed it all over my dick.
Hey, hey<eos> Let<eos> Monster<eos> Hi.<eos> Nothing personal, but you're clearly not in its taste<eos> This guy running<eos> Started a fight<eos> Do not interfere in another time<eos> Kiss, kiss.<eos> Difficult it was, kind of
Have you ever wondered how nature gets its glow?<eos> Who gives it light and colour as the seasons come and go?
Here's your fat mouse.<eos> - It's a guinea pig, but...<eos> And you, young man...<eos> I want to hear all about this little Trisha Sparks next time I see you.<eos> Trisha Sparks is two years older than you.<eos> She's hot.<eos> I'm very disappointed in you, Kendall.<eos> We almost made an apocalyptic mistake.<eos> This rock and roll idea of yours is old hat.<eos> Well, sir, I had every intention of putting our own spin on it.
Wait.<eos> I'll take your hearing aid to the city to fix it, my beautiful girl.<eos> Go now.<eos> Hello, cousin.<eos> Hello, Karim.<eos> How are you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> The damn thing broke down.<eos> I don't know what's wrong.<eos> I need to take it to a repair shop. Are you going to the city?
That's right, George.<eos> Forget your mum, Molly.<eos> She's never coming back.<eos> Alex?<eos> Mummy?<eos> You're going to miss my birthday.<eos> All my birthdays!<eos> Morning, ma'am.<eos> Do you like the flat?<eos> Luigi lets us use it.
- I'll clean up in here for you meanwhile.<eos> - No, it's OK, leave it.<eos> It's fine.<eos> - Thanks for doing that anyway.<eos> Well, maybe now you'll agree to replace this filthy old couch.<eos> You could make this room a bit more pleasant.<eos> Why are you so concerned about this room all of a sudden?<eos> - I thought you hated it.<eos> I don't hate this room.<eos> I'm just still jealous of it.
red deer are hardly found in any other areas in this region and the chernobyl zone is the only place that you'll find populations of red deer.<eos> we also find russian wild boars that the populations in the zone are 10 to 15 times higher than they are outside of the zone.<eos> [speaking russian] we'renowat thekindergarten of karpachi village,not far from the chernobyl station.<eos> children were living here while their parents worked. but after that night in april 1986, they never returned.<eos> we are in what was formerly a bedroom in this kindergarten where children used to sleep and rest.<eos> now,there's a certain emptiness here. all these windows are broken.<eos> but the room continues to live on.<eos> birds fly in here and sit on these bars.<eos> we even found evidence that an owl comes here. an owl,it regurgitates food, fur,bones,and feathers.<eos> evidently,it likes to sit here on this window pane.
Why would he sketch roman's club?<eos> RUSSIAN HISTORY<eos> Why did the engineer have to die?<eos> The russian tsars hired engineers to build security in their palaces.<eos> Walls, secret tunnels.<eos> When the work was done, the engineers knew all the secrets, so... the engineer had to die.<eos> The engineers knew when the job was over, they were gonna get the ax.<eos> So they built little trap doors. Give themselves a chance.<eos> You think pavel built himself a trap door?<eos> Well, if he did, he didn't get to it.
You don't like pepperoni?<eos> Don't like pizza.<eos> How come you don't havav a kitchen table?<eos> I'm trying to lead an uncluttered life.<eos> A kitchen table isn't clutter.<eos> A kitchen table is a kitchen table.<eos> Hey, ted, how's your hand?<eos> Is it healing okay?<eos> Yeah, of course it's healing okay.<eos> Why wouldn't it be healing okay?
Let's start talking it up.<eos> I really like that painting!<eos> It's neat!<eos> The-the colors are neat.<eos> The-the shapes are neat.<eos> It's really just... neat.<eos> What?<eos> Observe.<eos> I think there's a dynamic quality to the brushwork that, combined with the fluid composition, creates an almost Kandinsky-like emotional resonance.<eos> Yes, and you can still enjoy it even if you're not a pretentious douche.
And all my white friends have one black friend.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> But if you are in an interracial posse, you have to figure out, you know, what are the rules of the interracial posse?<eos> What are the Dr Dre rules of your crew?<eos> That's right, cos, you know, what are the Dr Dre rules?<eos> What are the rules when a Dr Dre song comes on the radio or plays at a club?<eos> What is the procedure that goes into effect?<eos> Cos sometimes I'm with my white friends and a Dr Dre song will come on.<eos> And there's a lot of "niggers" in a Dr Dre song.<eos> And they want to enjoy it, but they can't really enjoy it around me.
A lot of dates tonight.<eos> A lot of dates.<eos> A lot of men took women out tonight they haven't even fucked yet.<eos> Say, "I'm gonna take her to see Chris Rock.<eos> "I'm gonna close this deal with some Chris Rock tickets."<eos> Yeah. Yeah. 10º/º of that pussy is mine.<eos> Save me a lick or something, OK?<eos> Every man in here that's with a woman he hasn't fucked yet, is all thinking the same thing...<eos> "When do I whip it out?<eos> "Do I just shove her hand down there when we kiss good night "and watch her move it like she got cerebral palsy or some shit?
Anything interesting?<eos> Well, we're on a witch-hunt, that's for sure, but this isn't your typical hex bag.<eos> - No?<eos> - Goldthread. An herb that's been extinct for 200 years.<eos> And this is Celtic. And I don't mean some New-Age knockoff.<eos> It looks like the real deal, like 600-years-old real.<eos> And that is the charred metacarpal bone of a newborn baby.<eos> Gross.<eos> - Relax, man.<eos> It's at least a hundred years old.
Probably a civilian.<eos> Probably hiding.<eos> Radio room,I'm guessing.<eos> I didn't go in that far.<eos> What'd you say about a shore party?<eos> Making troop and supply runs back and forth from perth for months.<eos> Seawolf sub.<eos> The jimmy carter.<eos> You've got a nuclear sub?<eos> Who drives it?
It wasn't murder, mr. ellison.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> You also said I was remiss in creating john henry Without teaching him right from wrong.<eos> This is our opportunity to correct that oversight.<eos> "our" opportunity?<eos> Your religious faith and paternal instinct<eos> Make you the ideal candidate<eos> To foster his moral development.<eos> That thing killed 20 fbi agents.<eos> It needs a whole lot more than just a talking to.
Three Two actual, this is Three Two.<eos> Be advised, Alpha {just }got hit by arty. Over.<eos> Did you copy?<eos> Alpha {just }had artillery hits near their position.<eos> Get someone on the com.<eos> We need at least 347 tons up here.<eos> Shoot that dog, Corporal!<eos> Sir, {shouldn't we be saving our rounds for enemy combatants? } we should save our rounds for the enemy.<eos> Shoot that fucking dog!<eos> Darnold, give it a piece of your jerky.
Sam, I was looking for that exact vase.<eos> Sarah brought these.<eos> Aren't they gorgeous?<eos> I was looking for you too 'cause I wanted to use this.<eos> For what?<eos> I'm gonna, fill it with pennies.<eos> Ever do the penny thing where people put pennies in it?<eos> And then they guess how many pennies are there.<eos> - And then the winner gets the pennies.<eos> - May I have it?
So you put your big showy board of shame in this fishbowl for everyone to see.<eos> No, that's not... It's not a board of shame.<eos> It's a board of accomplishments. - Yes.<eos> - Well, you would say that.<eos> It's a board with dots on it. - I would say that?<eos> - You're on Sam's side.<eos> - No, no, Violet. I'm on the practice's side. - Wait.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> This board is a... It's a useful tool. All right?<eos> Now, just give it a chance.
w-we're gonna be burning away the muscle in your ventricle that's, um,blocking your ability to get oxygen.<eos> If we're successful,you should feel immediate relief,so... just like that,I'll...<eos> just like that.<eos> -And--and he can't be asleep during the procedure?<eos> -I'm afraid not.<eos> Dr. Stevens here will be asking you to cough,inhale and exhale.<eos> And checking to see if I'm dead yet?<eos> mike,stop.<eos> I mean,it... it is a heart attack,right?<eos> It's a dangerous procedure,but it's one that we can monitor and control.
I said to myself: It has all come true! Up there, on top of the world, the red star shines in the heavens like a ruby meteor.<eos> light has conquered darkness.<eos> I notice that I cast no shadow.<eos> Am I dead, or am I in the netherworld? Or am I standing before the gates of paradise?<eos> I feel elated, class conscious.<eos> The mausoleum!<eos> I fall prostrate on the yellow cobblestones, the gaps filled with black zift.<eos> "The Dictionary of Foreign Words" helps me grasp the gist of the moment:<eos> mummy comes from the Arabic word for black resin, zift.<eos> The Leader's mummy has leaked out into the square, so that I can taste it like a communion wafer, receive it like a blessing, share it like daily bread.
I cannot risk something like this happening again.<eos> Hello?<eos> It is me, Gaius.<eos> How old a man can become and yet change so little.<eos> You have not changed either.<eos> 20 years, almost a lifetime to make the short journey back to where you began.<eos> I'm not here for myself.<eos> The boy?<eos> You know about Merlin?<eos> You have struggled against his destiny, but you can no more prevent it than he can.
Not a pirate.<eos> See, we kinda messed up.<eos> We're flunking out of the class.<eos> The truth is we've been ditching school.<eos> Yes, your father mentioned that.<eos> What's with all this plastic?<eos> Oh, that couch is, um, what's the word? Mine. Okay, so this is, like, homework?<eos> Extra credit.<eos> You see, our teacher, Mr. Broderick, he's giving us one more chance.<eos> Yeah, see he drew this map and said if we could follow it and find the X like the pirates did in the book, then he wouldn't flunk us.
Give me another mag.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We'll never get a clean shot from here.<eos> I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.<eos> All right.<eos> I got your back.<eos> All right.<eos> Cover him!<eos> Rob, why eliminate witnesses?<eos> I mean, whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?
I'm staring down eternity alone.<eos> Can you think of a worse hell?<eos> Well, there's hell.<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> I just... I didn't care anymore.<eos> Do you know it's like... when you just don't give a damn?<eos> It's like... it's like being dead already.<eos> So just go ahead... do it.<eos> Dean.<eos> Head wasn't cut off, it was ripped off... with someone's bare hands.
Don't push it.<eos> Okay. I'll go make my goodbyes.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I think you're even, Sam. Yeah.<eos> Whew.<eos> Oh, by the way, I made some calls, Talked to a buddy of mine At the FBI.<eos> Looks like I got the charger back.<eos> Let's just call it A thank-you gift. You're welcome, Sam.<eos> Okay, I need a beer.<eos> getting information Out of someone who doesn't want to give it up is all about upsetting The target's emotional balance, impairing their judgment. fear's good for that.
"John Jansen won't give you a chance!"<eos> "John Jansen - we don't like the dance!"<eos> -You have heard The Radio Pirates.<eos> -The world's most dangerous radio station.<eos> Thank you for the evening, and remember to rap the rest of the week.<eos> Are you listening?<eos> The night is silent like a shooting star.<eos> Do you see the Big Dipper?<eos> Do you see the star that's almost gone?<eos> It died many years ago.
Not good news.<eos> The problem is, we're standing on sea ice.<eos> It means it has salt in it so it's incredibly grippy.<eos> The sledge can hardly move.<eos> I've been skiing for nine and a half hours of those ten.<eos> I'm broken.<eos> James and I had problems too.<eos> We couldn't kip in the car in case it fell through the ice while we fell asleep.<eos> So we had to build a tent.<eos> Everything about tenting is designed to make your life just a bit more difficult than it need be.
What if he's actually gonna use this evidence as an excuse to murder his wife?<eos> Wouldn't divorce be easier?<eos> Yeah, and it'd also be more public.<eos> Haggans doesn't strike me as the kind of man who wants his personal life on display.<eos> Well, you met him.<eos> Does he strike you as the kind of man that would be capable of murder?<eos> Anybody is capable of murder...<eos> G-Given the right circumstances.<eos> Haggans hired you to get information.<eos> You're not responsible for what he does with it, okay?
In some babies , meconium can end up in the lungs and attack the delicate lining though here in the gut, meconium is harmless and is flushed out within hours<eos> The first gulp of breast milk accelerate this process<eos> The turmoil of birth might now be over but the bussiness of adapting to life outside the womb has only just begun<eos> A newborn baby in a first months of life<eos> This is the time when we start to make sense of world around us. and began to explore it<eos> infancy is a period of rapid growth both outside and in<eos> The human body is a miracle of microscopic design tiny perefectly formed orgams each made up of billions of perfectly functioning cells<eos> These cells are the building blocks of the body they make us what we are<eos> 100 thousand billion cells, all working in prefect harmony<eos> inside every cell is the same extraordinary engine a machine that tells each cell how to grow, and what function it must perform
If there's any matter at all inside it Then stuff that's falling in Will tend to collide with stuff that's trying to get out.<eos> And the result of that collision of energies<eos> Is an unimaginably chaotic maelstrom of super hot dense plasma.<eos> And in that case<eos> So how close would space travelers have to be to get sucked Into a supermassive black hole in the center of a galaxy?<eos> For a supermassive black hole You would have to be about a million to a billion miles From the black hole to feel its influence.<eos> Over the years<eos> The Chandra x-ray Observatory Has caught our galaxy's Supermassive black hole nibbling on cosmic matter<eos> Our black hole is, today, inactive, compared to other black holes.<eos> Our galaxy has very little gas at the center And so, there's nothing really for the black hole to feed on. It's not eating very much.
You give me that, I will come in alive.<eos> If you don't - If you even come near me before that - I will put a bullet in my head.<eos> You wouldn't do that, Michael.<eos> You've got such a bright future. Maybe, maybe not.<eos> You give me 12 hours, you don't need to find out.<eos> I believe we have a deal.<eos> You think it's okay to take Sam's car on the street?<eos> Those government types.<eos> I bought myself a couple of hours before they pick me up.<eos> Might as well drive it till then.
You'd think that these traditional music people would... would gather that mystery, you know, is a traditional fact, you know, seeing as they're all so full of mystery.<eos> And contradictions.<eos> Yeah, contradictions.<eos> And chaos.<eos> Yes, it's chaos, clocks, and watermelons... You know, it's... it's everything.<eos> These people actually think I have some kind of, uh... fantastic imagination.<eos> But traditional music is just, uh... It's too unreal to die.<eos> It doesn't need to be protected.<eos> You know, I mean, in that music is the only true valid death you can feel today, you know, off a record player.<eos> But like everything else in great demand, people try to own it.
My stepmom verbally abused the ultrasound tech so we got escorted off the premises.<eos> Wow, what kind of swag did you score?<eos> Mall madness, huh?<eos> It's just some stuff I picked up for the baby.<eos> Don't you usually get all that stuff at a baby shower?<eos> When my stepmom was pregnant with my little sister she got a million gifts.<eos> But I wasn't jealous 'cause they all were super lame.<eos> I doubt anyone's gonna throw us a shower.<eos> Why wouldn't they throw you a baby shower?<eos> I don't think people know how to feel about this situation because it's not set in stone. What isn't set...
Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> Sorry, Mr. Beachum.<eos> Your Honor.<eos> So the house was completely surrounded... - within minutes of your arrival.<eos> - All four sides.<eos> And neither you nor any other officer... saw anyone go into or come out of that house? - No.<eos> - And what happened next?<eos> The bullet pierced through the frontal cortex and the temporal lobe... coming to rest on the upper right side of her brain, against the skull.<eos> And degree of injury?<eos> It inflicted grievous and irreparable injury.
This is a gay bar.<eos> Look, rape isn't an act of sex. Rape is an act of violence.<eos> And in prison society, it's all about violence.<eos> You're judged by how bad other cons fear you.<eos> Raping a dude is the ultimate way of beating him down.<eos> It means you're one bad motherfucker.<eos> So you rape people?<eos> Well, now that's something I'm not real proud of.<eos> I don't condone the practise, to be honest.<eos> But I do do it some.
You got the dinner.<eos> The driving's on me.<eos> Well, I'll let you pay your half if you slow down.<eos> Well, neither Pauline nor I ordered dessert.<eos> Let it go, Malcolm.<eos> Margot would insist on driving, if she knew how.<eos> My license elapsed, but I know how.<eos> It's probably for the best.<eos> I have this theory.<eos> I think, historically, women have been held back in so many ways that when they get power like they do behind the wheel, they can't help but abuse it.
Good night.<eos> We know this is one of the toughest decisions of your life.<eos> What to do when the parent who took care of you... can no longer take care of themselves?<eos> That's why here, at Greenhill Manor... we are committed to providing the highest quality of care... for your loved ones.<eos> Our board-certified physicians are dedicated... to maximizing both the physical... and emotional well-being of your elder.<eos> Come celebrate 100 years of award-winning care.<eos> And exhale.<eos> And breathe it up.<eos> And breathe up wonderful, good energy.<eos> Fill yourself with it.
- I gave up already.<eos> But the day just got worse.<eos> And I'm paying for it.<eos> You think this is bad?<eos> Think of the alternative, the people you love.<eos> Booth can get to them.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Coming up in here like you're family, like you care,<eos> You're no better than Detweiler or Booth.<eos> So take your little offer and shove it up your ass.
Who can say?<eos> We must be patient.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Promise me you'll send for me.<eos> On my life, I promise.<eos> Burn it.<eos> - And this?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Burn it.<eos> Wipe your arse with it. I really don't care.
This is dumbing down ofthe news agenda that people like me and your boss's boss really object to.<eos> I'm going to mention this to him when I see him on Friday.<eos> Malcolm, this is a traditional, old-fashioned news story, called "Minister looks a tit".<eos> Hey, everybody looks a tit, you know.<eos> Take two ofthese shots ofhim looking moronic out.<eos> Leave a couple in ofhim looking a little bit dim, put one ofhim composed. - Drop it down the order, we've got a deal.<eos> - I'm not... Deal?<eos> What deal, Malcolm?<eos> He looks a tit, that's it.<eos> But there is a difference between allowing someone's natural tittishness to come through and just exploiting it through camera work here.
I might as well wear a big sign that says, "divorced guy."<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ah, here.<eos> Hey, you're, uh, you're missing two eggs here.<eos> No, no.<eos> I, uh, I only buy 10 at a time.<eos> I know, it's crazy.<eos> No, it makes perfect sense to me.<eos> It does?<eos> Yeah, I mean, why have a decimal system if you're not gonna use it?
- Let me say something.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm not sure he was so off-the-charts wrong.<eos> Is that right?<eos> - Why can't he write what he wants?<eos> - He can write what he wants.<eos> He didn't want to work on a Fruit-of-the-Loom sketch.<eos> Give me your manhood, right now.<eos> and give it to me, because you're not gonna be needing it.<eos> Let's let somebody else use it.
- Troels, don't get more involved.<eos> - It's too late now.<eos> - Sorry for the hour.<eos> - No Worries.<eos> - You found the girl'?<eos> - Regretfully.<eos> We've got some questions.<eos> Rie Skovgaard and Morten Weber.<eos> You might help us with some details.<eos> She was found in your leased car so I'd like to know who drove it last.
Whoa!<eos> Not up yet.<eos> Just a squawk. Look, guys, I appreciate your situation here, but I'm not selling the boat.<eos> Dad left it to me.<eos> It's my boat. End of discussion. - Luke...<eos> - Hey, look, don't worry, all right.<eos> - I'll find another place to store it.<eos> - Like where?<eos> I don't know, I'll find a place, another place.<eos> What's the point of hanging onto it?
This is all three.<eos> They must have offed him in case he woke up and ID'd them.<eos> And it can't be Ravi.<eos> He was in custody.<eos> Could have ordered it.<eos> The NF firebombed Layla Dylan's flat.<eos> We need to entertain the possibility this could be a racial killing.<eos> Let's entertain it.<eos> Let's take it out for a prawn cocktail, a steak and Liebfraumilch.<eos> Then let's kick it to the gutter where it belongs.
Well yes, since she's the cause, she can also be the cure.<eos> If I could only persuade her that I am not her enemy, but her friend.<eos> I still have the letter in which she promises to reward me for all my pains and efforts at such time as she becomes crowned.<eos> I seem to remember that, at the time, you thought her promises rather amusing.<eos> Well yes, perhaps I did.<eos> Since then I have rather lost my sense of humour.<eos> Sir thomas,<eos> I notice you allow yourself none of the trappings of your great office.<eos> I'm not so vain as to display its power, master cromwell.<eos> But I tell you this I fully intend to use it.
Not a pirate.<eos> See, we kinda messed up.<eos> We're flunking out of the class.<eos> The truth is we've been ditching school.<eos> Yes, your father mentioned that.<eos> What's with all this plastic?<eos> Oh, that couch is, um, what's the word? Mine. Okay, so this is, like, homework?<eos> Extra credit.<eos> You see, our teacher, Mr. Broderick, he's giving us one more chance.<eos> Yeah, see he drew this map and said if we could follow it and find the X like the pirates did in the book, then he wouldn't flunk us.
Give me another mag.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> We'll never get a clean shot from here.<eos> I need to get up that hill and shot on the gunner.<eos> All right.<eos> I got your back.<eos> All right.<eos> Cover him!<eos> Rob, why eliminate witnesses?<eos> I mean, whoever's tracking you, they either... want to use the bomb for themselves or... they want to keep you from using it, but... either way, wh-what difference do witnesses make?
I'm staring down eternity alone.<eos> Can you think of a worse hell?<eos> Well, there's hell.<eos> I wasn't thinking.<eos> I just... I didn't care anymore.<eos> Do you know it's like... when you just don't give a damn?<eos> It's like... it's like being dead already.<eos> So just go ahead... do it.<eos> Dean.<eos> Head wasn't cut off, it was ripped off... with someone's bare hands.
Don't push it.<eos> Okay. I'll go make my goodbyes.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I think you're even, Sam. Yeah.<eos> Whew.<eos> Oh, by the way, I made some calls, Talked to a buddy of mine At the FBI.<eos> Looks like I got the charger back.<eos> Let's just call it A thank-you gift. You're welcome, Sam.<eos> Okay, I need a beer.<eos> getting information Out of someone who doesn't want to give it up is all about upsetting The target's emotional balance, impairing their judgment. fear's good for that.

Not good news.<eos> The problem is, we're standing on sea ice.<eos> It means it has salt in it so it's incredibly grippy.<eos> The sledge can hardly move.<eos> I've been skiing for nine and a half hours of those ten.<eos> I'm broken.<eos> James and I had problems too.<eos> We couldn't kip in the car in case it fell through the ice while we fell asleep.<eos> So we had to build a tent.<eos> Everything about tenting is designed to make your life just a bit more difficult than it need be.

Ayaka-san.<eos> Hey, do you still have that confession time during tonight's festival?<eos> Oh, we do.<eos> Someone confessed to me once, and we dated for a while.<eos> It was over pretty soon though.<eos> By the way, I heard you broke up with Motoharu?<eos> Ah.. yes.<eos> Say, do you know how to get over a past love?<eos> No?<eos> Find a new love, and immerse yourself in it.
It's very rude to read my thoughts, or Mr Lensherr's, without our permission.<eos> Did you think you were the only one of your kind, young lady?<eos> We're mutants, Jean.<eos> We're like you.<eos> Really?<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Oh, Charles.<eos> I like this one.<eos> You have more power than you can imagine, Jean.<eos> The question is, will you control that power? Or let it control you?
Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together.<eos> Ted, think about it this way:<eos> if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?<eos> Awesome air kicks, huh?<eos> - New pajama bottoms?<eos> - You know it.<eos> So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.<eos> Wait, so we're sharing the leg?<eos> No, the leg is a metaphor.<eos> How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next?
C, over 21 units.<eos> I see you say you don't drink, Mr Gallagher.<eos> Yeah, well me mum was a Methodist, love.<eos> Promised her, on her deathbed.<eos> We'll have to keep your details on the file.<eos> This particular trial involves taking the drug in conjunction with at least two units of alcohol a day.<eos> All right, I'll do it.<eos> Well, me mum was a wonderful woman, you know.<eos> She was...actually she was devoted to medical science.<eos> Absolutely devoted to it.
Because if it doesn't make sense, it can't be real.<eos> But what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?<eos> House, you're losing it.<eos> I've lost it.<eos> Why did you stop me?<eos> Because I think you're going to kill him.<eos> No, you don't think that.<eos> You know it.<eos> Because you're in my head.<eos> As long as the delusion makes sense, my mind lets it go on.
What is this?<eos> This is my car.<eos> We can't go in this.<eos> We have to take the other car.<eos> What other car?<eos> No, mom, that's not a car.<eos> That's a rap-video set.<eos> I ordered it specially.<eos> It has the darkest windows available.<eos> They say it's the car jay-z uses when he's in town.
But I'm not only fighting for subsidies. I'm fighting for the possibility for a country like Mali to produce cotton if it wishes or not, but to earn its living.<eos> A living to sell what?<eos> That's why this issue goes way beyond Africa.<eos> Why should the fate of people depend on their ability to produce and sell abroad?<eos> China's expansion must be integrated into the debate.<eos> Your own countries tremble before China.<eos> I believe that cotton production has had its day.<eos> Besides, with the prices of products that come from China and copy our textiles, there is no major stake for us in the cotton debate.<eos> "ln an inevitably open world,<eos> "we must civilize globalization "and give it a meaning."
It is not a genre where everything is permitted.<eos> It's a genre based on the fundamental prohibition.<eos> We cross one threshold, you can see everything. Close-ups and so on. But the price you pay for it is that the narrative which justifies the sexual activity should not be taken seriously.<eos> The screenwriters for pornography cannot be so stupid.<eos> You know, these vulgar narratives of a housewife alone at home... A plumber comes... Fixes the hole...<eos> "Sorry, but I have another hole to be fixed, can you do it?" or whatever.<eos> Obviously there is some kind of a censorship here.<eos> You have either an emotionally engaging film But then you should stop, just before showing it all: sexual act. Or you can see it all but you are not allowed to then to be emotionally seriously engaged.<eos> So that's the tragedy of pornography.<eos> It tries to be as realistic as possible, but it has to maintain the minimum of phantasmatic support.
Ok.<eos> The characters--we need to care about them.<eos> You know, like in "a chorus line," ok?<eos> You know, we needed to get to know Each and every one of those dancers, And I think we need to make the audience care<eos> About--about our characters.<eos> One of the many pitfalls of being a common man Is that you have a limited understanding Of your own reality.<eos> You are amused by something, But you are incapable of understanding The mechanism of that amusement.<eos> I pity you.<eos> Ok, but--<eos> Talking to you about musical theater Is like chatting with a dog About why it likes to lick its ass.
That there's something magnificent about you.<eos> Regardless of what has happened to you in your life.<eos> Regardless of how young or how old, you think you might be.<eos> The moment you began to think properly, there's something that is within you, there's power within you that's greater than the world.<eos> It will begin to emerge.<eos> It will take over your life.<eos> It will feed you, it will clothe you.<eos> It will guide you, protect you.<eos> Direct you.<eos> Sustain your very existence, if you let it.
No.<eos> Just, it's... brilliant.<eos> You are brilliant.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So we should bring in her dad.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> We've got to find something to connect with her.<eos> Make her fight back.<eos> Our priority is to contain the alien threat.<eos> Not put civilians in a cell with it.
A cold?<eos> It seems serious, you should take a day off<eos> In other words, there's no need for you to come back here ever again<eos> He... just fired me<eos> That's right!<eos> You are under estimating society<eos> How can it be?<eos> I hope you learned your lesson<eos> G-o-o-d-b-y-e-!<eos> just one would be enough just like Nana having a goal and blindly chasing after it
If there is a link, why don't we just ask the victims ourselves?<eos> Not the right time for a seance, thank you very much.<eos> The first time I met Torchwood, you had that glove.<eos> Heh-heh, no way!<eos> Not after what it did to Suzie.<eos> It brings people back to life.<eos> We could question the murder victims.<eos> That's exactly what she said.<eos> She was one of us, we trusted her and she's dead cos of that thing.<eos> The glove stays in the safe where it belongs.
That's exactly what she said.<eos> She was one of us, we trusted her and she's dead cos of that thing.<eos> The glove stays in the safe where it belongs.<eos> These murders are happening because of Torchwood.<eos> So Torchwood has got to do something.<eos> It fell through the Rift about 40 years ago.<eos> Lay at the bottom of the Bay till we dredged it up.<eos> I always figured, this wasn't just lost.<eos> Whoever made it, wanted rid of it.<eos> You know, we never gave it a cool name.
The shark can find prey far more easily than they can and they'll be able to collect the scraps from it's meals.<eos> It's long, fixed pectoral fins enable it to soar through the water, with the least expenditure of energy.<eos> This shark has found a school of rainbow runners.<eos> It would eat one, given the chance but rainbow runners are swift and agile and not easily caught<eos> so, it bides it's time.<eos> There's a chance that, eventually, it may spot a weakened fish that's catchable.<eos> The hunter endlessly waiting.<eos> Excitement far from land.<eos> A school of dolphin five hundred strong.<eos> They've sensed there's food around, and they're racing to catch up with it.
Pacific spotted dolphin.<eos> They're guided by their sonar.<eos> The dolphin, as so often, are working as a team, synchronizing their attacks to confuse their prey.<eos> As dawn approaches, squid and fish and plankton retreat downwards, to shelter in the darkness.<eos> Some of these isolated volcanoes rise as much as nine thousand meters from the sea floor, reaching close to the surface.<eos> Around these peaks invigorated by daily sunshine marine life flourishes in spectacular abundance.<eos> Fish crowd here, because the volcano forces nutrients to the surface encouraging the plankton to bloom.<eos> An oceanic wanderer, a mola mola stops by to be cleaned by reef fish, at the sea mount edge.<eos> Butterfly-fish pluck string-like parasites from it's flanks.<eos> The huge fish lives on jellyfish over a thousand meters down where the water is twenty degrees colder so, a brushup near the surface, allows it to warm up before making more deep water forays.
I'll just read ahead without you.<eos> No! We have to read it together.<eos> Oh, of course. Whatever you say, sweetie.<eos> Nighty-night.<eos> I like to come up here and make fun of the sunset.<eos> Hey, gas ball, you suck!<eos> Nelson, do you ever wish you weren't a bully?<eos> Mm, sometimes.<eos> But it's not up to me, it's who I am.<eos> I mean, a shark can't stop swimming or it'll blow up.
Come on, Gwen. Let's go.<eos> Hey, she's with me tonight.<eos> One night off. You promised.<eos> Don't you dare.<eos> If you go now, Gwen...!<eos> Sorry for cutting in, but I've been having trouble with this one.<eos> Rhys will get over it.<eos> He always does.<eos> You promised you'd keep hold of your life.<eos> Don't let it drift.
Ayaka-san.<eos> Hey, do you still have that confession time during tonight's festival?<eos> Oh, we do.<eos> Someone confessed to me once, and we dated for a while.<eos> It was over pretty soon though.<eos> By the way, I heard you broke up with Motoharu?<eos> Ah.. yes.<eos> Say, do you know how to get over a past love?<eos> No?<eos> Find a new love, and immerse yourself in it.
It's very rude to read my thoughts, or Mr Lensherr's, without our permission.<eos> Did you think you were the only one of your kind, young lady?<eos> We're mutants, Jean.<eos> We're like you.<eos> Really?<eos> I doubt that.<eos> Oh, Charles.<eos> I like this one.<eos> You have more power than you can imagine, Jean.<eos> The question is, will you control that power? Or let it control you?
Yeah, so you spend one more amazing day together.<eos> Ted, think about it this way:<eos> if you knew that you were going to lose your leg tomorrow, would you sit on the couch and cry about it, or would you run, and jump, and do some awesome air kicks while you still could?<eos> Awesome air kicks, huh?<eos> - New pajama bottoms?<eos> - You know it.<eos> So we can sit around and cry, or we can run, and do awesome air kicks before our leg gets chopped off.<eos> Wait, so we're sharing the leg?<eos> No, the leg is a metaphor.<eos> How could the leg be well enough to do awesome air kicks one day, and yet still so sick it needs to be chopped off the next?
C, over 21 units.<eos> I see you say you don't drink, Mr Gallagher.<eos> Yeah, well me mum was a Methodist, love.<eos> Promised her, on her deathbed.<eos> We'll have to keep your details on the file.<eos> This particular trial involves taking the drug in conjunction with at least two units of alcohol a day.<eos> All right, I'll do it.<eos> Well, me mum was a wonderful woman, you know.<eos> She was...actually she was devoted to medical science.<eos> Absolutely devoted to it.
Because if it doesn't make sense, it can't be real.<eos> But what if the faulty assumption is that it's real?<eos> House, you're losing it.<eos> I've lost it.<eos> Why did you stop me?<eos> Because I think you're going to kill him.<eos> No, you don't think that.<eos> You know it.<eos> Because you're in my head.<eos> As long as the delusion makes sense, my mind lets it go on.
What is this?<eos> This is my car.<eos> We can't go in this.<eos> We have to take the other car.<eos> What other car?<eos> No, mom, that's not a car.<eos> That's a rap-video set.<eos> I ordered it specially.<eos> It has the darkest windows available.<eos> They say it's the car jay-z uses when he's in town.
But I'm not only fighting for subsidies. I'm fighting for the possibility for a country like Mali to produce cotton if it wishes or not, but to earn its living.<eos> A living to sell what?<eos> That's why this issue goes way beyond Africa.<eos> Why should the fate of people depend on their ability to produce and sell abroad?<eos> China's expansion must be integrated into the debate.<eos> Your own countries tremble before China.<eos> I believe that cotton production has had its day.<eos> Besides, with the prices of products that come from China and copy our textiles, there is no major stake for us in the cotton debate.<eos> "ln an inevitably open world,<eos> "we must civilize globalization "and give it a meaning."
It is not a genre where everything is permitted.<eos> It's a genre based on the fundamental prohibition.<eos> We cross one threshold, you can see everything. Close-ups and so on. But the price you pay for it is that the narrative which justifies the sexual activity should not be taken seriously.<eos> The screenwriters for pornography cannot be so stupid.<eos> You know, these vulgar narratives of a housewife alone at home... A plumber comes... Fixes the hole...<eos> "Sorry, but I have another hole to be fixed, can you do it?" or whatever.<eos> Obviously there is some kind of a censorship here.<eos> You have either an emotionally engaging film But then you should stop, just before showing it all: sexual act. Or you can see it all but you are not allowed to then to be emotionally seriously engaged.<eos> So that's the tragedy of pornography.<eos> It tries to be as realistic as possible, but it has to maintain the minimum of phantasmatic support.
Ok.<eos> The characters--we need to care about them.<eos> You know, like in "a chorus line," ok?<eos> You know, we needed to get to know Each and every one of those dancers, And I think we need to make the audience care<eos> About--about our characters.<eos> One of the many pitfalls of being a common man Is that you have a limited understanding Of your own reality.<eos> You are amused by something, But you are incapable of understanding The mechanism of that amusement.<eos> I pity you.<eos> Ok, but--<eos> Talking to you about musical theater Is like chatting with a dog About why it likes to lick its ass.
That there's something magnificent about you.<eos> Regardless of what has happened to you in your life.<eos> Regardless of how young or how old, you think you might be.<eos> The moment you began to think properly, there's something that is within you, there's power within you that's greater than the world.<eos> It will begin to emerge.<eos> It will take over your life.<eos> It will feed you, it will clothe you.<eos> It will guide you, protect you.<eos> Direct you.<eos> Sustain your very existence, if you let it.
No.<eos> Just, it's... brilliant.<eos> You are brilliant.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So we should bring in her dad.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> We've got to find something to connect with her.<eos> Make her fight back.<eos> Our priority is to contain the alien threat.<eos> Not put civilians in a cell with it.
A cold?<eos> It seems serious, you should take a day off<eos> In other words, there's no need for you to come back here ever again<eos> He... just fired me<eos> That's right!<eos> You are under estimating society<eos> How can it be?<eos> I hope you learned your lesson<eos> G-o-o-d-b-y-e-!<eos> just one would be enough just like Nana having a goal and blindly chasing after it
If there is a link, why don't we just ask the victims ourselves?<eos> Not the right time for a seance, thank you very much.<eos> The first time I met Torchwood, you had that glove.<eos> Heh-heh, no way!<eos> Not after what it did to Suzie.<eos> It brings people back to life.<eos> We could question the murder victims.<eos> That's exactly what she said.<eos> She was one of us, we trusted her and she's dead cos of that thing.<eos> The glove stays in the safe where it belongs.
That's exactly what she said.<eos> She was one of us, we trusted her and she's dead cos of that thing.<eos> The glove stays in the safe where it belongs.<eos> These murders are happening because of Torchwood.<eos> So Torchwood has got to do something.<eos> It fell through the Rift about 40 years ago.<eos> Lay at the bottom of the Bay till we dredged it up.<eos> I always figured, this wasn't just lost.<eos> Whoever made it, wanted rid of it.<eos> You know, we never gave it a cool name.
The shark can find prey far more easily than they can and they'll be able to collect the scraps from it's meals.<eos> It's long, fixed pectoral fins enable it to soar through the water, with the least expenditure of energy.<eos> This shark has found a school of rainbow runners.<eos> It would eat one, given the chance but rainbow runners are swift and agile and not easily caught<eos> so, it bides it's time.<eos> There's a chance that, eventually, it may spot a weakened fish that's catchable.<eos> The hunter endlessly waiting.<eos> Excitement far from land.<eos> A school of dolphin five hundred strong.<eos> They've sensed there's food around, and they're racing to catch up with it.

What if it's rigged?<eos> Rigged?<eos> I've been working on this.<eos> Here.<eos> Take a look at that.<eos> It charts the last 20 people that won a spot on The Island.<eos> Excluding, of course, the women, picked to be breeders.<eos> - What is this?<eos> - I took the first letter in each name.<eos> I assigned it a point value based on its alphabet position.
- Josephine?<eos> You'll do a proper job, I mean...<eos> No mumbo jumbo, right?<eos> None whatsoever.<eos> Hi.<eos> This car is illegally parked.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Be a good boy and move it or else you get a ticket.<eos> You have every right to give me a ticket.<eos> Just move it and we won't bother.
Stop, Maryam!<eos> Granny, we're coming!<eos> Mahmoud<eos> Yusef, my dear, come...<eos> I want to serve the food I vowed to give<eos> Forgive me, Mr. Yusef<eos> My sister Pari is driving me crazy<eos> She feels too shy to give you her thesis herself<eos> Please take a look at it.<eos> It's very important to her
Requesting orders.<eos> - What shall we do?<eos> - No response from Command.<eos> Or from Party Leader Creedy.<eos> Or from the high chancellor.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> - Because he was right.<eos> - About what?<eos> That this country needs more than a building right now.<eos> It needs hope.
We made need these.<eos> Right.<eos> There's so much energy here.<eos> But it's unfocused.<eos> Undirected.<eos> - Well, I don't feel a thing.<eos> - No.<eos> It's here.<eos> But it's like the holocron.<eos> It it needs a Seer to unlock it.
Lily. what's wrong?<eos> What is it?<eos> Heidi's sick.<eos> and I think isabelle's responsible.<eos> I think they're ready for you.<eos> You are going to read a lot about jordan collier in the next few weeks.<eos> some of it good. a lot of it bad...<eos> I will be ignoring all of it.<eos> just like jordan would have.<eos> because jordan may have used the media. but he never allowed himself to be seduced by it.
I want to go home.<eos> I know you do, honey, but dr. Hudson is going to take very good care of you.<eos> Don't tell anyone i can't heal.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> What i have to.<eos> [Richard]:<eos> If you're sick, the responsible thing is to report to ntac, but if you are well... walking into quarantine is an easy step, but walking out, that might be considerably more difficult.<eos> There's a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400.<eos> They even gave it a name. They call it...
Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> This thing that's killing them, it's not a disease.<eos> It's a side-effect.<eos> Dr. Burkhoff, just calm down.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> A side-effect of what?<eos> I don't know exactly, but i do know this... there's a synthetic substance present in the blood of every 4400, all the ones i tested, every medical report you gave me, sick ones, well ones, doesn't matter.<eos> They all have it.<eos> They even gave it a name.
Me.<eos> I get back on my fucking feet, I'll carry my share of the water.<eos> My money's on you.<eos> Here comes some pain for you.<eos> You ever think of screaming instead of biting through your own fucking flesh?<eos> It's my fucking pain.<eos> And I am suggesting an improved way of dealing with it, which is how progress occurs.<eos> Will you two be quiet?<eos> Not only will we not be quiet, you frog-faced fuck...<eos> I'm gonna take this stick and drag it back and forth across the bars of your cell.
I don't need this.<eos> My husband has two jobs.<eos> I don't need to be here right now.<eos> Hold my calls.<eos> Who are you hollering at?<eos> "Hold my calls."<eos> Hold your own damn call!<eos> I do not need this!<eos> My man has two jobs!<eos> My mother seemed to always find work when she needed it, so my father didn't complain that much.
Someone should just tell him to do it.<eos> Way faster.<eos> Except that's forgery.<eos> Also illegal.<eos> - And I already tried.<eos> - Not you.<eos> Where's a good dominatrix when you need one?<eos> Annette's barred from the hospital.<eos> If you get caught, Cuddy's got a hairbrush.<eos> And believe me, she knows how to use it.
Transcript: Abby_e Synchro: Sixe<eos> Sorry I'm late Jack. Because of this, we maintain an air of professionalism at all times.<eos> I was at Tanya's place this morning.<eos> Oh let me guess, she wanted you to help her move furniture.<eos> Let's just say the bed moved. Because you picked it up and moved it!
- to appoint whom I like.<eos> - Indeed, yes.<eos> This is a great honor. Kiss your uncle's hand.<eos> I kiss your hand, Uncle, but truly I would make an ill pontiff.<eos> Don't be ridiculous. You'll make a lovely pontiff.<eos> You'll see to it, right?<eos> I had rather thought to concentrate on my poetry for a while.<eos> - He'll make a lovely pontiff.<eos> - Poetry can wait.<eos> It should not wait too long.
Previously on Stargate Atlantis<eos> It's headed for the city !<eos> - What's it doing ?<eos> - Scanning us ..<eos> Now the dart sent a transmission deep into space, and then it self destructed before we could get to it.
Well, keep complaining about it and we may get there faster.<eos> Well, couldn't we have met these people on a tropical beach planet, populated by tall, blonde women?<eos> Whoever wants to speak with us, obviously values their privacy.<eos> Yes, well I value my time and this is a waste of it.<eos> What's a waste of time, is listening to you, Rodney.<eos> This is a mission.<eos> Yeah well, it strikes me that this is a mission better suited to... one of the... lower echelon teams.<eos> Lower echelon?<eos> He means to say, less important.<eos> Got a tip from one of Teyla's contacts. We're following it up.
Leo, look, be serious, man. What are we gonna do? I got it.<eos> We'll soak the shirt in club soda.<eos> Okay,<eos> I'm gonna use my police academy training to figure out what happened here.<eos> First thing I'm gonna need is for everyone to lie face down with your hands behind your head.<eos> What if he stopped to take a picture and he got kidnapped by white slavers?<eos> They're gonna kill him.<eos> He can't do anything!<eos> I told him this was a stupid idea, and now we're stuck out here in the middle of nowhere.<eos> My foot is shaking, it wants to kick his ass so bad.
I don't have to be anywhere.<eos> I don't have a job.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Well, let's just say I'm two years older than professor Reveng-O.<eos> 36.<eos> S-so then, Stew, what do you do all day?<eos> You're lookin' at it.<eos> Oh, we're gonna be good friends.<eos> Fez, jackie's show is about to start. Aren't you supposed to be helping her?<eos> She asked me to make a giant sign with her name on it, so I said, "you got it Baby!"

Just say, "This is the way I think it's gonna be,"<eos> 'cause this several- hands fucking shit don't help me.<eos> - I'll boil things down.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Let's assume for the sake of conversation that there's a new treaty with the Sioux peoples.<eos> "People," that's what we're calling those cocksuckers now?<eos> That's the way things are headed?<eos> Assuming the new treaty, the hills will be annexed.<eos> The territory respects the statutes of the Northwest Ordinance, which state that a citizen can have title to any land unclaimed or unincorporated by simple usage.<eos> Essentially, if you're on it and you improve it, you own it.
Hiya.<eos> Brace yourself, girls, the class has arrived.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> - Rachel.<eos> - Well remembered.<eos> - Have you got a dog, Rachel?<eos> - Yeah, a Westie.<eos> Well, it's my mum's.<eos> - Do you let it lick your face?
Happy birthday.<eos> Get the kid a damned ice cream cake.<eos> Dr. Wyland, Obstetrics.<eos> - Actually, I didn't.<eos> I've taken her off all medication.<eos> Your guy Foreman gave her Haldol.<eos> We needed blood for tests.<eos> I assumed that was the only way to get it.<eos> He knocked her out.<eos> Look, I have a cane, and I know how to use it.
Buckinghamshire?<eos> I suppose I could.<eos> What sort of disappearing trick?<eos> Now, it'll save your time and mine if I truncate.<eos> The figurine left my house at 9.27 a. m.<eos> Placed, under my supervision, in a box inside a locked steel case, which was handcuffed to two armed couriers and conveyed to this building.<eos> The security staff, incidentally, were of impeccable credentials.<eos> Safe arrival was verified by the senior officer in this room before it was passed to the curator, who appears to have gone into some kind of trance in here, before the piece then vanished into thin air.<eos> The most priceless Nara Period ceramic this side of Kyoto.<eos> I mean, it is beyond value!
Yeah, like a crack resort.<eos> She came back for Mr Waffles.<eos> - Nathan do something?<eos> - No.<eos> - His... mother, she said...<eos> - You were ruining her son's life.<eos> Yeah, basically.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> In-laws... are like the FBI, honey.<eos> They have a system and they follow it.
Looked like one.<eos> Didn't say anything.<eos> That's my point.<eos> Colson wrapped things up quickly without any questions.<eos> It was a perfect likeness.<eos> Imagery of little grey aliens has been commonplace for years. - Colson could have a picture.<eos> - So not a real Asgard?<eos> No Asgard we know would allow himself to be used that way.<eos> It did look a little vacant.<eos> Still, as much as he wants the truth, I don't think he would perpetrate a hoax to get it.
The Andari people would welcome a fresh start, given the oppression we've suffered.<eos> All you suffered under Tiranian rule was peace and good government!<eos> And mass arrests, summary executions!<eos> - In response to terrorist acts! - Whoa!<eos> We're getting a bit off-topic here.<eos> Three separate relocations is just not practical.<eos> Madronas is your best bet to save as many lives as possible.<eos> Jonas. Major Carter.<eos> You've discovered something about the conversion process.<eos> We determined that the transformation must have begun with a massive bombardment of subatomic particles which catalyse the reaction and allow it to continue without energy input.
And I died a little inside.<eos> Well, then I guess we should also rule out<eos> The scenic banks of nipple creek.<eos> Where is michael?<eos> You know, whenever he tells me he has a surprise for me,<eos> It makes me a little nervous. It's probably just 'cause the last time He said that to you, you got pregnant.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> I think barbie's probably worried sick That her convertible's missing.<eos> I thought you were getting another van.<eos> Oh, so did I, But then I saw this baby down at the police auction, And I knew it was destined to be mine.
Like a rock I must be hard<eos> Like bamboo I bend in the wind<eos> - You can fly - i'm at peace because I know It's okay to be afraid<eos> - You have begun<eos> - Lesson number one<eos> It's General Shang.<eos> Hello, little warriors.<eos> Your new uniform suits you, General.<eos> The uniform, yes.<eos> Now I just have to live up to it.
- This is my face. It's not a look.<eos> Good. Good, no look is great.<eos> Only he was really quick to want to destroy it.<eos> What should he do?<eos> Put a hat on it and stand it on Michigan Avenue?<eos> Let it go.<eos> What was the motive, John?<eos> Brother, it's a robot.<eos> It doesn't need a motive. It just has to be broken.<eos> This thing looked like it needed a motive.
His therapist is down here to help him out.<eos> Excuse me. What did you call me?<eos> - You're his therapist?<eos> - No, I'm... not his therapist.<eos> We need to talk 'cause this book is making a lot of sense to me and I want...<eos> And what is Caterine Vauban doing in the United States?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> I got a story for you. - It's only four months old. - Wait.
How many years of schooling did you complete? 20.<eos> After taking my undergraduate degree at Bowdoin, I received my doctorate from the Bussey Institute at Harvard.<eos> I took a position as assistant professor of zoology here at Indiana University.<eos> At first I studied the Rhaetulus didieri, or stag beetle.<eos> Then I discovered a far more fascinating insect.<eos> This is the American Cynipidae, or gall wasp.<eos> Here the wasp deposits an egg into its host plant.<eos> In this case, an oak tree.<eos> The adult wasp chews its way through the tree, and copulates.<eos> At which point, it has the good sense to die.
I know, but it's a film.<eos> It's a protein... Secreted by a fungus called aspergillus ticor.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, he knew it was a protein but didn't know where it came from.<eos> All he really did was just take some pictures with their equipment.<eos> Guess where we're going.<eos> - Do you know where will is?<eos> - No, why?<eos> The Ariel meeting is pushed back till Wednesday.<eos> I thought he was waiting around for it.
We thought that we were degrading gravity, right?<eos> That we were blocking that information.<eos> I think we're doing more than that.<eos> I think we're blocking more than that.<eos> When you were controlling the feed, did you notice it was parabolic?<eos> It's important.<eos> Parabolas are important.<eos> Here, look at this.<eos> I don't know, Abe.<eos> I'm going to start it up and let it run for 60 seconds... With nothing in it.
Yeah, right. Right.<eos> You're the smart one.<eos> You're the one learning Greek.<eos> It's Gaelic.<eos> Well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight.<eos> How do you say that in Gaelic?<eos> Boxing is an unnatural act... cos everything in it is backwards.<eos> You want to move to the left, you don't step left, you push on the right toe.<eos> To move right, you use your left toe.<eos> Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do, you step into it.
My mom,no.My mom is in Cabo,she won't... be back for a few days.<eos> Oh,my God,my mom.<eos> xxxxxxxxxx you never saw me.<eos> Ryan,it's Julie.<eos> It's important.<eos> What's this? It's why I needed to see you.<eos> You see,after it happened,I hired a private investigator to find out where he went.<eos> Volchok. And now I know.<eos> All the information is in this file.<eos> I'm not giving it to the cops.
We'll have it with no sugar.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You hear everything, don't you?<eos> You learn to hear.<eos> It's nice here.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Did you see the entrance gate?<eos> Nice, isn't it?<eos> It's a very special gate. An antique gate.<eos> It's like 100 years old.
That was class.<eos> And you, don't blow it, OK?<eos> Just act casual.<eos> They don't call me The Gold Mine for nothing.<eos> 19,980, 20,000.<eos> All there.<eos> - Er... where'd you get it all from?<eos> - Oh, I broke my streak.<eos> I got lucky on a horse.<eos> What's it called?
Just say, "This is the way I think it's gonna be,"<eos> 'cause this several- hands fucking shit don't help me.<eos> - I'll boil things down.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Let's assume for the sake of conversation that there's a new treaty with the Sioux peoples.<eos> "People," that's what we're calling those cocksuckers now?<eos> That's the way things are headed?<eos> Assuming the new treaty, the hills will be annexed.<eos> The territory respects the statutes of the Northwest Ordinance, which state that a citizen can have title to any land unclaimed or unincorporated by simple usage.<eos> Essentially, if you're on it and you improve it, you own it.
Hiya.<eos> Brace yourself, girls, the class has arrived.<eos> Ohh!<eos> Oh, all right.<eos> - Rachel.<eos> - Well remembered.<eos> - Have you got a dog, Rachel?<eos> - Yeah, a Westie.<eos> Well, it's my mum's.<eos> - Do you let it lick your face?
Happy birthday.<eos> Get the kid a damned ice cream cake.<eos> Dr. Wyland, Obstetrics.<eos> - Actually, I didn't.<eos> I've taken her off all medication.<eos> Your guy Foreman gave her Haldol.<eos> We needed blood for tests.<eos> I assumed that was the only way to get it.<eos> He knocked her out.<eos> Look, I have a cane, and I know how to use it.
Buckinghamshire?<eos> I suppose I could.<eos> What sort of disappearing trick?<eos> Now, it'll save your time and mine if I truncate.<eos> The figurine left my house at 9.27 a. m.<eos> Placed, under my supervision, in a box inside a locked steel case, which was handcuffed to two armed couriers and conveyed to this building.<eos> The security staff, incidentally, were of impeccable credentials.<eos> Safe arrival was verified by the senior officer in this room before it was passed to the curator, who appears to have gone into some kind of trance in here, before the piece then vanished into thin air.<eos> The most priceless Nara Period ceramic this side of Kyoto.<eos> I mean, it is beyond value!
Yeah, like a crack resort.<eos> She came back for Mr Waffles.<eos> - Nathan do something?<eos> - No.<eos> - His... mother, she said...<eos> - You were ruining her son's life.<eos> Yeah, basically.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> In-laws... are like the FBI, honey.<eos> They have a system and they follow it.
Looked like one.<eos> Didn't say anything.<eos> That's my point.<eos> Colson wrapped things up quickly without any questions.<eos> It was a perfect likeness.<eos> Imagery of little grey aliens has been commonplace for years. - Colson could have a picture.<eos> - So not a real Asgard?<eos> No Asgard we know would allow himself to be used that way.<eos> It did look a little vacant.<eos> Still, as much as he wants the truth, I don't think he would perpetrate a hoax to get it.
The Andari people would welcome a fresh start, given the oppression we've suffered.<eos> All you suffered under Tiranian rule was peace and good government!<eos> And mass arrests, summary executions!<eos> - In response to terrorist acts! - Whoa!<eos> We're getting a bit off-topic here.<eos> Three separate relocations is just not practical.<eos> Madronas is your best bet to save as many lives as possible.<eos> Jonas. Major Carter.<eos> You've discovered something about the conversion process.<eos> We determined that the transformation must have begun with a massive bombardment of subatomic particles which catalyse the reaction and allow it to continue without energy input.
And I died a little inside.<eos> Well, then I guess we should also rule out<eos> The scenic banks of nipple creek.<eos> Where is michael?<eos> You know, whenever he tells me he has a surprise for me,<eos> It makes me a little nervous. It's probably just 'cause the last time He said that to you, you got pregnant.<eos> So what do you think?<eos> I think barbie's probably worried sick That her convertible's missing.<eos> I thought you were getting another van.<eos> Oh, so did I, But then I saw this baby down at the police auction, And I knew it was destined to be mine.
Like a rock I must be hard<eos> Like bamboo I bend in the wind<eos> - You can fly - i'm at peace because I know It's okay to be afraid<eos> - You have begun<eos> - Lesson number one<eos> It's General Shang.<eos> Hello, little warriors.<eos> Your new uniform suits you, General.<eos> The uniform, yes.<eos> Now I just have to live up to it.
- This is my face. It's not a look.<eos> Good. Good, no look is great.<eos> Only he was really quick to want to destroy it.<eos> What should he do?<eos> Put a hat on it and stand it on Michigan Avenue?<eos> Let it go.<eos> What was the motive, John?<eos> Brother, it's a robot.<eos> It doesn't need a motive. It just has to be broken.<eos> This thing looked like it needed a motive.
His therapist is down here to help him out.<eos> Excuse me. What did you call me?<eos> - You're his therapist?<eos> - No, I'm... not his therapist.<eos> We need to talk 'cause this book is making a lot of sense to me and I want...<eos> And what is Caterine Vauban doing in the United States?<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> No, no, wait.<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> I got a story for you. - It's only four months old. - Wait.
How many years of schooling did you complete? 20.<eos> After taking my undergraduate degree at Bowdoin, I received my doctorate from the Bussey Institute at Harvard.<eos> I took a position as assistant professor of zoology here at Indiana University.<eos> At first I studied the Rhaetulus didieri, or stag beetle.<eos> Then I discovered a far more fascinating insect.<eos> This is the American Cynipidae, or gall wasp.<eos> Here the wasp deposits an egg into its host plant.<eos> In this case, an oak tree.<eos> The adult wasp chews its way through the tree, and copulates.<eos> At which point, it has the good sense to die.
I know, but it's a film.<eos> It's a protein... Secreted by a fungus called aspergillus ticor.<eos> He told you that?<eos> No, he knew it was a protein but didn't know where it came from.<eos> All he really did was just take some pictures with their equipment.<eos> Guess where we're going.<eos> - Do you know where will is?<eos> - No, why?<eos> The Ariel meeting is pushed back till Wednesday.<eos> I thought he was waiting around for it.
We thought that we were degrading gravity, right?<eos> That we were blocking that information.<eos> I think we're doing more than that.<eos> I think we're blocking more than that.<eos> When you were controlling the feed, did you notice it was parabolic?<eos> It's important.<eos> Parabolas are important.<eos> Here, look at this.<eos> I don't know, Abe.<eos> I'm going to start it up and let it run for 60 seconds... With nothing in it.
Yeah, right. Right.<eos> You're the smart one.<eos> You're the one learning Greek.<eos> It's Gaelic.<eos> Well, you just protected yourself out of a championship fight.<eos> How do you say that in Gaelic?<eos> Boxing is an unnatural act... cos everything in it is backwards.<eos> You want to move to the left, you don't step left, you push on the right toe.<eos> To move right, you use your left toe.<eos> Instead of running from the pain, like a sane person would do, you step into it.

At midnight, we will strike.<eos> Hey!<eos> - You count sheep at home.<eos> - Why? I get paid to count them here.<eos> Okay, they're inside.<eos> - How much time?<eos> - Twelve minutes.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> All of our lives, we have fought this war.<eos> Tonight, I believe we can end it.
But it's dangerous.<eos> You would be required to eat greater and greater quantities of spice.<eos> And if you conceive... it will accelerate your pregnancy.<eos> But the question remains... who has been able to feed you the contraceptives for so long?<eos> Be that as it may... this is a question that cannot be delayed any longer.<eos> The great houses are still demanding... that a constitution be on the agenda... at the next convention of the Lansraad.<eos> It's nothing but a ruse... contrived by enemies of House Atreides to conceal far more sinister motives.<eos> Perhaps we could offer the appearance of a constitution.<eos> Something ceremonial.<eos> It doesn't need to be real.
- And for her it is natural?<eos> - And the day it is estvestvenno.<eos> - She asked no questions?<eos> - She asked no questions.<eos> Anyway, on top.<eos> Later she asked.<eos> What is she asking?<eos> I want to know all her questions!<eos> For example, one day ...<eos> She lay on the bed, she took a bath, which I poured it,
- Don't worry, Sue.<eos> It's all right.<eos> - It was Uncle George.<eos> Well, it's scary.<eos> Good work, Sue.<eos> I don't know what stupid, idiotic thing made these lights go off.<eos> There's some spare fuses in the crawlspace.<eos> If I can get to them I can get these lights back on.<eos> Quick, George!<eos> Grab that railroad tie and jam it against the door!
- Look, see you after, yeah?<eos> - Probably.<eos> - Thank you, Prime Minister.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Right.<eos> ¶ Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket<eos> ¶ Save it for a rainy day<eos> ¶ Catch a falling star And put it in your pocket<eos> ¶ Never let it fade away

Well, they need my blood.<eos> I have a very rare blood type. I'm A.B.<eos> - Positive.<eos> Really? Mm-hmm. I'm I.B.<eos> - Positive. I be positive they ain't touchin' me with no needle.<eos> It's just so... Helpful and lifesaving?<eos> No.<eos> It's your blood. It's blood.<eos> Blood's supposed to stay inside the body.<eos> That's where it's meant to be. Besides, they stockpile this stuff in a warehouse somewhere. It's all frozen on ice, and they tell everybody there's a shortage.
I'm a detective, Verone!<eos> You do anything to me, the whole force'll be on your ass in a minute.<eos> Shut your mouth, you fat piece of shit.<eos> Stop right now.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Sit down.<eos> You're going to regret this.<eos> Stop right now!<eos> Once the bucket gets hot enough, Detective... the rat is gonna want out.<eos> And the only direction it can go, is south.
- Untie the lines !<eos> - Lower sail !<eos> We'll anchor here for a few days.<eos> Crew members are obliged to remain on board.<eos> Haul down the mainsail !<eos> Landing is prohibited until the coasts are explored by daylight.<eos> How often have I seen sea monsters floating in the waves !<eos> And the most terrible of them all is the sea pig.<eos> It follows ships for days on end until... until one stormy night it rises from the water to beg for food !<eos> If a sailorthrows it some bread, it disappears into the sea.
I'll get it for you. -Here. -Thanks.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm learning Roman. Yeah, and how are you?<eos> Good.<eos> Grandma, about the flower dress...<eos> Are you sure you need it? It's in fashion again.<eos> But on you it would look ordinary, right. You're awful!<eos> Why do you want to look older than you really are?<eos> -That's enough.<eos> -Not if I wear it.
I'll call the cops to show you out.<eos> You see me?<eos> Here I am, and here's your desk. The two of us are now inseparable.<eos> Watch out, jackass!<eos> I'll let you use my phone to call for an ambulance.<eos> When I get back, I don't want to see your face here, understood?<eos> Laugh all you want, but fate has it's own sense of humor. "Fate's Whimsy", it's called.<eos> And fate never favors the simple solution.<eos> It delights in confounding and controlling us, the jerk.<eos> In what remains of our story, it has but one seed to sow, that we might reap success and save our cafe.
How long will the operation and rehabilitation take?<eos> Something like three years.<eos> One year.<eos> You're going to puke your guts out.<eos> Al, please endure just for a little while.<eos> I'll get you back to your original body.<eos> And you too, Brother. You'll get your body back.<eos> Now, your body is just perfect!<eos> Yeah! After that, let's try alchemy.<eos> I haven't used it at all since then.
Because I'm only gonna say this once: What Angelus told you was a lie.<eos> I haven't and will never give up on you.<eos> We'll get through this thing.<eos> Can't believe we didn't crush you people years ago.<eos> Wes and Fred, get back to Lilah's books.<eos> We need information on this new player.<eos> Lilah, make some coffee.<eos> Earn your keep around here.<eos> Lorne I want you out working real estate.<eos> If this thing is bigger than the Beast it'll lay down roots and it'll need square footage.
If these guys are on our side... somebody should tell 'em before they start trying to kill us again.<eos> He was how old?<eos> Oh, six or seven.<eos> He must have taken the scroll from my library.<eos> Wesley, I was just telling Winifred... about the time that I caught you with the resurrection spell.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> - I couldn't remember.<eos> Why were you doing that?<eos> A bird had flown into my windowpane.<eos> I think I was trying to bring it back to life.
But he won't kill you or me.<eos> Missing the secret ingredient.<eos> Now, give me the talisman and I'll leave you to your misery.<eos> I don't have it.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - You are one strange man, Señor Angel.<eos> I'm not the one in a mask standing in a cemetery in the middle of the night.<eos> No. But you will be.<eos> You want this thing to punch your ticket, fine.<eos> But I'm not gonna let it get the talisman.
What?<eos> - Don't kick the cup.<eos> - The what?<eos> I have a spider whose previous credits include the bathtub scene from Annie Hall trapped under that cup.<eos> - The size of a Buick?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I see.<eos> And what are you planning to do now that you've got him trapped?<eos> Well, I was thinking of just giving him the kitchen.<eos> 'Cause, you know, we don't use it very much anyhow, so...
"Education is an admirable thing, but it is well to remember from time to time that nothing that is worth knowing can be taught. "<eos> Oscar Wilde.<eos> These are only three of many countless views on the expansion of the human mind.<eos> I personally believe in all of them, and fortunately for me, so does Chilton.<eos> An institution not just because of age and standing, but because of ideas.<eos> Because it encourages ideas and it will accept nothing less than everything you have to give.<eos> This is the place where our lives start.<eos> You know, it's funny, me standing here before you right now.<eos> I've thought about nothing else for four years but this school, this big important school with all of its history and tradition and really super teachers.<eos> And I dedicated myself to it completely, heart and soul, believing in its power, believing in its ability to get me where I needed to go.
I'm not...!<eos> I'm not...! I'm not...!<eos> I'm not...!<eos> Brother! He'll die!<eos> Big... Brother...<eos> Nina, this might hurt a little, but bear with me.<eos> Brother! Are you planning to re-transmute her! ?<eos> That's something that we can't do...<eos> My Chimera has been perfectly transmuted!<eos> Nobody can return it to the way it was!
- We both going to the ONDCP briefing?<eos> - No, we're going in here.<eos> Gee, Toby, people are gonna talk.<eos> I'm curious.<eos> It wouldn't be for the obvious reason, would it?<eos> - What's the obvious reason?<eos> - You're a conservative.<eos> Maybe you'd love to see him stay on the bench, a liberal icon reduced to a quivering mass of octogenarian confusion hanging on till he can be replaced by a paleo-Republican.<eos> Constitution's a living document.<eos> You stick to it like it's a boilerplate lease.
There. That space-Time eversion has given us their box, and vice versa.<eos> What you think you just explained to us, is that--<eos> Correct!<eos> This box contains our own universe!<eos> Sweet honeybee of infinity!<eos> Bender, quit destroying the universe!<eos> But- - Oh!<eos> Yes, all that is and ever shall be is in that box.<eos> And the box itself is probably worth something too.<eos> We must cherish it as we cherish every moment of our lives.

I'm not getting through to you.<eos> I'm asking for an exchange.<eos> This ship for your life.<eos> I want my crew back.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Once a passenger's marked, they're mine.<eos> Then I guess it's over.<eos> All you had to do was fix the ship!<eos> I gave you a great opportunity.<eos> All you had to do was take it.
I know.<eos> I accidentally set a python on my cousin Dudley at the zoo once.<eos> Once.<eos> But so what? I bet loads of people here can do it.<eos> No, they can't.<eos> It's not a very common gift, Harry.<eos> This is bad.<eos> What's bad?<eos> If I hadn't told that snake not to attack Justin...<eos> - That's what you said to it.
We're in the sewer.<eos> -Hey, I ain't gonna lie to you.<eos> What?<eos> I don't have the savoir-faire, that devilish charm.<eos> -l've seen you, and I don't have that.<eos> -l beg to differ. I disagree.<eos> No, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to your--<eos> Bust it, bust it.<eos> You do have savoir-faire.<eos> You just have to unleash it.
Cheol-yee!<eos> Run harder!<eos> The crazy cow is coming!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run!<eos> Run faster!<eos> Don't let it catch you!
I don't need that expensive stuff.<eos> You should take it.<eos> We have lots of stuff at home but this is our only cloth.<eos> Those are ugly.<eos> Why'd she put the game in?<eos> Watch out!<eos> The crazy cow is coming!<eos> Run!<eos> Look out!<eos> Don't let it catch you
But I shouldn't flatter you so much.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Kyungsoo!<eos> You're really into that book.<eos> Have you read it?<eos> Yes.<eos> They say the author lived to be 100, but took his own life by starving himself.<eos> That book changed the life of someone I know.<eos> I see...<eos> You're so absorbed in it...
"Yes, but I am Vader.<eos> Lord Vader.<eos> "Everyone challenges me to a fight to the death.<eos> "Darth Vader, I'm Darth Vader, Sir Lord Vader, Sir Lord Darth Vader,<eos> "Lord Darth Sir Lord Vader of Cheam,<eos> "Sir Lord Baron von Vaderham.<eos> "The Death Star, I run the Death Star."<eos> "What's the Death Star?" "This is the Death Star!"<eos> "l run this star." "This is a star?"<eos> "This is a fucking star, I run it!
BRIAN!<eos> JUSTIN?<eos> IT'S JUST A DREAM. DAMN! DON'T...<eos> TOUCH ME.<eos> GOD, I WANT HIS ASS.<eos> WHO DOESN'T?<eos> NO, NO I MEAN, I REALLY WANT HIS ASS, INSTEAD OF THIS TIRED OLD THING.<eos> YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID YOUR ASS IS YOUR FINEST FEATURE.<eos> ONLY LATELY, IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE... PEAKED.<eos> YEAH WELL, MAYBE IT NEEDS A REST.

He is not.<eos> However, his life is in grave danger.<eos> He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.<eos> Commander Thor.<eos> I apologise for the accommodations, but we weren't expecting company.<eos> You have committed an act of war against the Asgard.<eos> The response will be swift and decisive.<eos> As swift and decisive as your attempt to defend this planet?<eos> After Thor's ship was destroyed, the Goa'uld detected an escape pod.<eos> They retrieved it before it could disappear into the atmosphere.

I disagree.<eos> No, I'm not gonna sit here and listen to your--<eos> Bust it, bust it.<eos> You do have savoir-faire.<eos> You just have to unleash it.
Cheol-yee!<eos> Run harder!<eos> The crazy cow is coming!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run harder!<eos> Run!<eos> Run faster!<eos> Don't let it catch you!
I don't need that expensive stuff.<eos> You should take it.<eos> We have lots of stuff at home but this is our only cloth.<eos> Those are ugly.<eos> Why'd she put the game in?<eos> Watch out!<eos> The crazy cow is coming!<eos> Run!<eos> Look out!<eos> Don't let it catch you
But I shouldn't flatter you so much.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Kyungsoo!<eos> You're really into that book.<eos> Have you read it?<eos> Yes.<eos> They say the author lived to be 100, but took his own life by starving himself.<eos> That book changed the life of someone I know.<eos> I see...<eos> You're so absorbed in it...
"Yes, but I am Vader.<eos> Lord Vader.<eos> "Everyone challenges me to a fight to the death.<eos> "Darth Vader, I'm Darth Vader, Sir Lord Vader, Sir Lord Darth Vader,<eos> "Lord Darth Sir Lord Vader of Cheam,<eos> "Sir Lord Baron von Vaderham.<eos> "The Death Star, I run the Death Star."<eos> "What's the Death Star?" "This is the Death Star!"<eos> "l run this star." "This is a star?"<eos> "This is a fucking star, I run it!
BRIAN!<eos> JUSTIN?<eos> IT'S JUST A DREAM. DAMN! DON'T...<eos> TOUCH ME.<eos> GOD, I WANT HIS ASS.<eos> WHO DOESN'T?<eos> NO, NO I MEAN, I REALLY WANT HIS ASS, INSTEAD OF THIS TIRED OLD THING.<eos> YOU'VE ALWAYS SAID YOUR ASS IS YOUR FINEST FEATURE.<eos> ONLY LATELY, IT'S LOOKING A LITTLE... PEAKED.<eos> YEAH WELL, MAYBE IT NEEDS A REST.

He is not.<eos> However, his life is in grave danger.<eos> He is a prisoner of the Goa'uld.<eos> Commander Thor.<eos> I apologise for the accommodations, but we weren't expecting company.<eos> You have committed an act of war against the Asgard.<eos> The response will be swift and decisive.<eos> As swift and decisive as your attempt to defend this planet?<eos> After Thor's ship was destroyed, the Goa'uld detected an escape pod.<eos> They retrieved it before it could disappear into the atmosphere.
Donkey kick!<eos> Come on, kid, give them the haymaker!<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> Call me the Claw of Ling Chow!<eos> Ling Chow this!<eos> Clean up on aisle 7.<eos> Humans!<eos> Retreat with honor.<eos> I have a bat.<eos> I have a mitt, and I'm not afraid to use it.
Place your hands in the light.<eos> Make contact.<eos> At least the people in the palace learned a lesson.<eos> May i pass on a question from our Führer to you?<eos> - I am honoured.<eos> - The Führer, who appreciates your predictions for the future and who will regard to your..<eos> ...historic prognosis, agrees with you entirely. Asked the other day in a small circle...<eos> How clairvoyance could be in accord with the principle of cause and effect? A law of nature.<eos> Nature doesn't care what we think of it.<eos> Nor about the laws that we assign it.
No, you must never think that.<eos> We must've done something awful.<eos> No.<eos> I was a little girl like you in Vienna when the war came... and there wasn't enough food to eat.<eos> One day, my mother bundled me up... and she took me to the train station.<eos> She put me on a train to Holland... she hung a sign around my neck, and she said good-bye.<eos> Didn't she love you anymore?<eos> Yes, she did.<eos> That's why she did it.<eos> There was food here... and families willing to share it.
That mistress was saying, that Miss Mariani had been living here, and that I should come on Sunday.<eos> I've made a mistake, as usual.<eos> She was living here some time ago.<eos> Didn't she, Michele ?<eos> Yes, but she won't be coming back here any more.<eos> Not for some time, at least.<eos> She never says, where she goes - it's hard to bump on her.<eos> - I just wanted to give her back this picture.<eos> - I'll give it to her.<eos> I'd like to deliver it personally.
Watch out!<eos> Concentrate!<eos> Come on!<eos> Move!<eos> Yes...keep dribbling.<eos> Almost.<eos> That's great dribbling.<eos> Do more.<eos> Fung, why can't I take part in the training?<eos> Even though your leg is so strong, you can't control it freely.
I like it raw.<eos> I heard that she is thinking about getting Junsei to work on the Cigoli painting.<eos> What?<eos> That's great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> What's up?<eos> Junsei's in charge of Cigoli.<eos> It was painted in 1 61 0.<eos> The owner is a private collector.<eos> You want me to work on it by myself?
Life may be stranger than fiction. It is often more disturbing.<eos> Before I wrote my stories of the great detective,<eos> I had access to a terrifying world, of mystery, and murder.<eos> My companion and teacher on this journey, was Dr. Joseph Bell.<eos> Here in this extraordinary man was my inspiration, but it is only known that I have chosen to reveal, the dark beginnings of Sherlock Holmes.<eos> I have come to believe, that of all mankind's remarkable faculties, it is the gift of memory, that makes us truly human.<eos> But memory can be a torment, as we!<eos> For though it makes love possible, it gives grief, the power to destroy us.
Hey, you know, maybe we should try some of those theme shows.<eos> Actually, we have done theme shows.<eos> You know, I still get letters about the show we did on existential angst.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> - I get them at home.<eos> Well, I'm just saying it wouldn't hurt to spice things up a little.<eos> You know, mention people's privates once in a while.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> My show is fine the way it is.<eos> What it needs is a little support from this station.
It's going good.<eos> I mean, we get along great.<eos> She's so...<eos> - Hot?<eos> - Well, I was gonna say sweet, but yeah.<eos> And she's okay with Rachel and the baby?<eos> Well, I haven't actually told her yet.<eos> I don't wanna scare her off.<eos> Well, you have to be honest with her otherwise you may think that you're going down the same path but you're really going down different ones.<eos> I'm gonna take that book and I'm gonna beat you to death with it.
Not unless you can delay it forever.<eos> Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Can we take our seats, please?<eos> The conventional wisdom is that if you are HIV-positive, and you don' t seek treatment, then you are likely to develop full-blown AIDS.<eos> Why have you avoided treatment?<eos> I saw some of my friends who had it die quite quickly.<eos> They had all been pushed into the medical treatment system.<eos> I became infected from a blood transfusion, so I wasn' t keen to go back into the system.<eos> Somehow, I worked out that... if you treat a person with HIV without any symptoms, it' s like... it' s like voodoo.<eos> Tell someone they have a fatal illness and they' ll almost certainly develop it.
- No fucking way, dude.<eos> My parents will never let me keep a goat.<eos> Well, I guess we're gonna have to kill it.<eos> No, we're not going to kill it, Cartman.<eos> We'll just have to take the return address and mail it back to the kids in Afghanistan.<eos> Come on, goat.<eos> They're closing!<eos> Excuse me, we want to overnight this goat to Afghanistan, please.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's an Afghanistan goat so it can't stay here or else it'll choke on the sweet air of freedom.
Look at this.<eos> - The entity.<eos> - No, it said it couldn't go back.<eos> - It's Sam.<eos> - Daniel... I shot her twice.<eos> After it transferred Sam's consciousness out of her body.<eos> You killed the entity after it put Sam into this... this thing.<eos> - She's in here.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why would it do that?
Well, we have to do something.<eos> OK.<eos> Let's think this through.<eos> Why would Hammond say he doesn't remember Lieutenant Tyler?<eos> I don't think he's just saying it.<eos> I think he doesn't remember.<eos> Yesterday we were all in the briefing room for two hours going over the mission.<eos> I do not believe he would lie to us.<eos> So he's suffering from some kind of amnesia?<eos> If that's the case, they're all suffering from it.

So who lives there now?<eos> A woman and her son.<eos> The kid is cute.<eos> No address in the Philippines...<eos> Just his son's phone number.<eos> - I can't accept this!<eos> - Please, you must.<eos> Thank you, then.<eos> That era has passed.<eos> Nothing that belonged to it exists any more.
I know one thing for sure. You gonna look pretty foolish... with two different shoes on your feet.<eos> Ah, Jesus.<eos> You got an answer for everything, don't you, Bagger ?<eos> There's no difference between winning and losing... and anything in between.<eos> What's lost is lost.<eos> A man lives. A man dies.<eos> And in the end it all turns out the same. You're alone.<eos> And that's all you're ever gonna be.<eos> Is that a fact ?<eos> Alone. So, a soul is born with everything that the Lord can give it, and things don't go its way, so it just gives up, and the good Lord takes everything back ?
That's what we're here for.<eos> A man should live out his life fully.<eos> Give form to every feeling and reality to every dream.<eos> Sitting there among her things, I was reminded I didn 't really know Emily at all.<eos> Though we'd lived together as man and wife, it was when I left the house when I was with Sara that I felt like I was home.<eos> WOMAN: University.<eos> - Chancellor, please.<eos> There's only one way to get rid of a temptation:<eos> Yield to it.<eos> Resist it and the soul longs for what it's forbidden to itself.
-Me neither. 'Cause we're too good together to let that come between us.<eos> -It was a mistake.<eos> -You think so?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -I think you're right.<eos> I think that we just got carried away in the moment and you know.<eos> -Yes.<eos> Last night was really special to me, because you're really special to me.<eos> But that's all it was. It was an incredibly special night.<eos> I got worried that maybe we'd give it more importance than we should.
We lose children, people, postmen and now even hoes.<eos> And nobody cares!<eos> Are you listening? Don't even touch that cabbage, understand?<eos> You know I won't let you go hungry.<eos> I always found you food, and I'll keep finding it.<eos> Cabbage will give you gas.<eos> No cabbage. It's not healthy.<eos> It'll give you a tummy ache.<eos> What's the matter with that girl?<eos> I'm cooking for a whole regiment and it's still not enough.
I was in my cell...<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> When I went back to the cell, I saw a ray of sunlight coming in the window.<eos> It was moving. It seemed to be looking for something.<eos> I said my prayers. And I was going to the chapter room when I realised my gold and diamond ring was missing.<eos> It was my mother who gave it to me on the day I became a nun.<eos> I looked for it everywhere, with no luck.<eos> Then I remembered an old tradition.<eos> It said that to find something that's missing, we have to undress, Iie on a bed and call the missing object like you call a lover.
Next time Dad gets a transfer, he'll have to go alone.<eos> No garbage today.<eos> Bring it tomorrow.<eos> No use building your body.<eos> Why?<eos> Godzilla will disappear in the black hole we make.<eos> Keep this.<eos> The signal bomb has a micro transmitter?<eos> I made it for you.<eos> When in danger, shoot it.
Oh, I believe it.<eos> But if there's one thing I'm sure of, it's that things don't always happen the way we intend.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If I weren't your only doctor, I imagine you'd confine me to the brig.<eos> Confiscating my emitter would be an equivalent punishment.<eos> I'm not sure that's appropriate.<eos> If that's not enough, you can take away my holodeck privileges, and my autonomy protocols.<eos> You mean turn back the clock to when you were first activated.<eos> You've given me extraordinary freedom over the years.<eos> I've obviously abused it.
How so?<eos> Gar kept complaining how bland his dinner was, so I added a few exotic spices.<eos> I'm not sure I see your point.<eos> I-I was trying so hard to create something he liked that I didn't take his alien physiology into account.<eos> Everyone's assuming he faked his illness, but I might have really made him sick.<eos> It's not as if your cooking turned him into a thief.<eos> No, but if he hadn't gone to Sick Bay, he may never have come up with a plan to kidnap the Doctor, much less have the opportunity to do it.<eos> In my experience, Neelix, men like Gar have no trouble finding opportunities to take advantage of other people.<eos> Well, I just hope there's something I can do to help find the Doctor.<eos> Well, when and if that opportunity arises, I'm sure you'll make the most of it.
I'm out in back.<eos> I passed Gary Saunders on the way out.<eos> He booed me.<eos> I swear to God, I passed by, he went, " Boo. "<eos> Who's Gary Saunders?<eos> Deputy spokesperson at the Department of Energy.<eos> - You didn 't hire him.<eos> -I promoted Simon GIazer.<eos> -I promoted from within, T oby.<eos> -Anyway they' re hypothesizing the thing came down at an odd angle and its position might be preventing it from establishing a downlink.
- What'd you get me?<eos> - Graduation gift.<eos> Is it a briefcase?<eos> Did I just ruin it?<eos> I ask because it's a typical gift.<eos> I don't mean boring, I mean basic.<eos> When I say basic, I don't mean boring, either.<eos> Open the box.<eos> - You bought me a pen.<eos> - It's a good one.

- Which was 17 minutes ago.<eos> Ready to proceed?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Dr. Briggs, please state your qualifications for the court.<eos> I have advanced degrees in medicine psychiatry and neurology from Johns Hopkins and I have had three books and several dozen papers published in the fields of neurology and neuropsychiatry.<eos> What was the cause of death, as determined by the autopsy?<eos> The decedent expired due to a gradual shutdown of the bodily functions.<eos> Why did her body shut down?<eos> The autopsy found that it was a cumulative effect from numerous physical traumas exacerbated by malnutrition which severely inhibited her ability to recuperate from those traumas.<eos> In other words, her starving body had little or no means to recover from the injuries it was sustaining, and so it eventually just gave out.
- Sent destruction through the Underground.<eos> Fueled by the media, fear and panic spread quickly fracturing and dividing the country until, at last, the true goal comes into view.<eos> Before the St. Mary's crises no one would have predicted the results of the election that year. No one.<eos> And then not long after the election, lo and behold, a miracle.<eos> Some believed it was the work of God himself.<eos> But it was a pharmaceutical company controlled by certain party members that made them all obscenely rich.<eos> A year later, several extremists are tried, found guilty and executed while a memorial is built to canonize their victims.<eos> But the end result, the true genius of the plan, was the fear.<eos> Fear became the ultimate tool of this government.<eos> Through it, our politician was ultimately appointed to the newly created position of high chancellor.
Come on, you lazy bastard.<eos> You finally caught up with me.<eos> - Juno, are we there yet?<eos> - There's a river about half a mile ahead.<eos> When we reach it, we follow it up to the mouth of the cave, OK?<eos> How does she know there's a river up ahead?<eos> I can't hear a thing.<eos> She can probably smell it.<eos> She came up here last week to check the route out.<eos> It's rule number one - file a flight plan and stick to it.
I don't know...<eos> Something a little lighter maybe.<eos> I see.<eos> Perhaps a little more citrus.<eos> I like that.<eos> I like it a lot.<eos> It's Intense Passion.<eos> Intense Passion?<eos> Would you have the same scent but with a different name?<eos> Desert Rose is closest to it.
Five. Release the safety, and then squeeze the trigger slowly.<eos> - What's a high hand grasp?<eos> - Here, take the gun.<eos> When you're firing a semiautomatic, you want the web of your hand up against the edge of the backstrap.<eos> - What perfume are you wearing?<eos> - I'm not wearing perfume.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Because you smell amazing.<eos> Oh. I was making macaroons before I left the house.<eos> Now, I want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove, firmly enough that it can't fly away, but not so firmly that you can kill it.
The Dalek race were genetically engineered.<eos> Every single emotion was removed, except hate.<eos> Genetically engineered?<eos> By whom?<eos> By a genius, Van Statten.<eos> By a man who was king of his own little world.<eos> You'd like him.<eos> It's been on Earth for over 50 years.<eos> Sold at private auction, moving from one collection to another.<eos> Why would it be a threat now?
- No brain damage?<eos> - No brain damage.<eos> OK, really, couldn't you have led with that?<eos> Good point.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> - It's a key.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why is it a key?<eos> Are we feeling existential this morning?<eos> If a key turns in a lock, and no one asked for the key or even wanted it, does it make a sound?
Yeah, probably.<eos> Gandolf Hitler? "Never-ending Leg"?<eos> - Conical Soup.<eos> - Yeah, I've... I've heard the name.<eos> Yes! Heard that. "Mr Woman".<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> Ah, but have you heard the Multistorey Karma remix?<eos> - No.<eos> - I've rinsed it.<eos> - Don't that damage it?
There's widespread evidence, you know.<eos> That prolonged use of the cell phone causes brain damage.<eos> Are you sure you haven't got one?<eos> Damn.<eos> It's not charging.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - There's no point, the battery's gone.<eos> - It's too old.<eos> We don't use that expression round here.<eos> It doesn't need a battery, just needs electricity.
She was trying to eliminate her rival from the competition.<eos> She was cheating.<eos> Wrong Way Corrigan was a shamed porn star... in the '70s.<eos> He looks like Edward Fox there, doesn't he? - He's a jockey, isn't he?<eos> - (Stephen) No.<eos> He was a famous cheat.<eos> He had a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan where more than a million people turned up in the streets.<eos> He was inspired by a man called Lindbergh.<eos> He was determined to fly across the Atlantic, although Lindbergh had already done it.<eos> They told him he wasn't allowed to, because his aeroplane wasn't up to snuff, it was a mess, it was an old crate.
It's not even funny !<eos> Okay then, let's start the tape<eos> Hi Eric, it's your mother.<eos> I'm here with Donna and Fez.<eos> Hi honey !<eos> Thank you for the postcard with the monkeys.<eos> I'm still bananas about you too !<eos> Okay, let's see, where to start... well your father and I were furious when we caught you boys in that smokey basement.<eos> The minute you left the airport we went down there to do what the Fed's call 'a sweep'...<eos> How dare you boys smoke up my house when you know how hard I work to keep it smelling lemony-fresh !
You can't lie in front of the bulldozers forever.<eos> I'm game. We'll see who rusts first.<eos> This bypass has got to be built and it is going to be built.<eos> - Why has it got to be built?<eos> - lt's a bypass.<eos> You've got to build bypasses. Besides, you should've protested months ago.<eos> The plans have been on display at the planning office for a year.<eos> On display?<eos> I had to go down to a cellar.<eos> Mr. Dent, have you any idea how much damage this bulldozer would suffer if I just let it roll straight over you?
But I know the rage that drives you.<eos> That impossible anger strangling the grief until the memory of your loved one is just poison in your veins.<eos> And one day, you catch yourself wishing the person you loved had never existed so you'd be spared your pain.<eos> I wasn't always here in the mountains.<eos> Once, I had a wife.<eos> My great love.<eos> She was taken from me.<eos> Like you, I was forced to learn there are those without decency who must be fought without hesitation, without pity.<eos> Your anger gives you great power.<eos> But if you let it, it will destroy you as it almost did me.
Chilled wine on our lips<eos> Ah, how good it is To be alive Stop that.<eos> What's this instrument, Feodor?<eos> It's a flute I use for hypnosis and relaxation sessions.<eos> Oh, do tell.<eos> You'll laugh but I found it on the seabed.<eos> Humanity's oldest flute.<eos> Dating from the mammoths... carved from the bone of a rhino with partitioned nostrils.<eos> Partitioned?<eos> The poor rhino! How did it breathe?
Good night.<eos> Do you want him to fail?<eos> Is that the only satisfaction you can take from what he's doing?<eos> You think I want him to break his heart?<eos> What will you do, Mary, when he fails?<eos> How will you help him then?<eos> All you ever do is encourage him.<eos> That's right.<eos> I do encourage him.<eos> He has a God-given talent, and this is his one chance to give a voice to it.

I was making macaroons before I left the house.<eos> Now, I want you to hold the gun like you're holding a beautiful white dove, firmly enough that it can't fly away, but not so firmly that you can kill it.
The Dalek race were genetically engineered.<eos> Every single emotion was removed, except hate.<eos> Genetically engineered?<eos> By whom?<eos> By a genius, Van Statten.<eos> By a man who was king of his own little world.<eos> You'd like him.<eos> It's been on Earth for over 50 years.<eos> Sold at private auction, moving from one collection to another.<eos> Why would it be a threat now?
- No brain damage?<eos> - No brain damage.<eos> OK, really, couldn't you have led with that?<eos> Good point.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> - It's a key.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why is it a key?<eos> Are we feeling existential this morning?<eos> If a key turns in a lock, and no one asked for the key or even wanted it, does it make a sound?
Yeah, probably.<eos> Gandolf Hitler? "Never-ending Leg"?<eos> - Conical Soup.<eos> - Yeah, I've... I've heard the name.<eos> Yes! Heard that. "Mr Woman".<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> Ah, but have you heard the Multistorey Karma remix?<eos> - No.<eos> - I've rinsed it.<eos> - Don't that damage it?
There's widespread evidence, you know.<eos> That prolonged use of the cell phone causes brain damage.<eos> Are you sure you haven't got one?<eos> Damn.<eos> It's not charging.<eos> Hang on.<eos> - There's no point, the battery's gone.<eos> - It's too old.<eos> We don't use that expression round here.<eos> It doesn't need a battery, just needs electricity.
She was trying to eliminate her rival from the competition.<eos> She was cheating.<eos> Wrong Way Corrigan was a shamed porn star... in the '70s.<eos> He looks like Edward Fox there, doesn't he? - He's a jockey, isn't he?<eos> - (Stephen) No.<eos> He was a famous cheat.<eos> He had a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan where more than a million people turned up in the streets.<eos> He was inspired by a man called Lindbergh.<eos> He was determined to fly across the Atlantic, although Lindbergh had already done it.<eos> They told him he wasn't allowed to, because his aeroplane wasn't up to snuff, it was a mess, it was an old crate.
It's not even funny !<eos> Okay then, let's start the tape<eos> Hi Eric, it's your mother.<eos> I'm here with Donna and Fez.<eos> Hi honey !<eos> Thank you for the postcard with the monkeys.<eos> I'm still bananas about you too !<eos> Okay, let's see, where to start... well your father and I were furious when we caught you boys in that smokey basement.<eos> The minute you left the airport we went down there to do what the Fed's call 'a sweep'...<eos> How dare you boys smoke up my house when you know how hard I work to keep it smelling lemony-fresh !
Well, he's lying.<eos> Well, that's quite possible, but I have seen a photograph of the two of you together and as far as I can tell it was genuine.<eos> In it you are shaking hands.<eos> Well, I spend a lot of time shaking hands - more than I do peering into test tubes.<eos> Have you ever received unwanted phone calls, letters, anything like that?<eos> Well, I get stacks of mail from animal rights campaigners, but they're really addressing the IHA generally.<eos> So you don't meet the public on a daily basis?<eos> No. Ah, erm...<eos> A couple of years ago, my wife talked me into writing a thriller.<eos> It didn't do very well, but the publishers made me work like a dog promoting it.
For all we know, that wolf could've had rabies.<eos> Oh, so now it's a wolf.<eos> Jimmy, I never said it wasn't. I just said I didn't see it.<eos> It was more like a werewolf.<eos> And I found this website last night and according to legend, a werewolf feeds during the lunar cycle - that's the three nights around the full moon.<eos> Last night was the first moon of the lunar cycle.<eos> Why can't you just download porn like other teenage boys?<eos> Excuse me for trying to make conversation.<eos> OK, so what would a werewolf be doing in LA?<eos> Shouldn't it be off in the countryside somewhere, terrorizing helpless maidens?
But it wasn't.<eos> I don't really know where I am.<eos> You're in one of the other things to avoid in life.<eos> -What, a junk room?<eos> -No, trouble.<eos> There!<eos> Don't irritate it!<eos> -What is it?<eos> -Just a sphinx.<eos> -Throw it a book. -What?

- They tell me things.<eos> It doesn't matter though, because Dad is gonna be in here a long time.<eos> No.<eos> We have court day today.<eos> They take plea.<eos> Daddy come home.<eos> You out.<eos> Annyong had hit a nerve, and Buster recalled... that right before George Sr. 's arrest, he'd made a similar threat.<eos> I said he could wear that tie.<eos> It looks better on him.
But after just 2 days in the forest,<eos> he was filled with regret.<eos> He wanted to return to the woman he loved.<eos> And he wanted to return to he life he missed.<eos> So he found a shortcut through the woods and he took it.<eos> He was desperate, desperate to get back to the woman he loves before it was too late.<eos> Her threat surrounding his head...<eos> Would she wait for him or would she be true to her words ?<eos> Would she be gone ?<eos> He could feel his horse losing speed as if it wouldn't make it through the night.
I begged her for Monopoly, but she insisted on "Mimic Your Favorite Sweat Hog", so...<eos> I talked with your advisor.<eos> She has the same concern that I do.<eos> - What concern is that?<eos> - You're taking too many courses this semester.<eos> - Your workload is too heavy.<eos> - I'll try harder.<eos> I think you should drop this course.<eos> You still have a couple of weeks left before the end of the drop period.<eos> You can take the course again when you have more time to devote to it.
You have a parasite.<eos> Like a tapeworm or something?<eos> Lie back and lift up your sweater.<eos> You can put your arms down.<eos> Can you do anything about it?<eos> Only for about a month or so.<eos> After that it becomes illegal to remove, except in a couple states. Illegal?<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Many women learn to embrace this parasite.<eos> They name it, dress it up in tiny clothes, arrange playdates with other parasites. - Playdates?
I was in the top of my class.<eos> But not THE top.<eos> I did an internship at the Mayo Clinic.<eos> Yes, you were a very good applicant.<eos> But not the best?<eos> Would that upset you, really, to think that you were hired because of some genetic gift of beauty not some genetic gift of intelligence?<eos> I worked very hard to get where I am.<eos> But you didn't have to.<eos> People choose the paths that grant them the greatest rewards for the least amount of effort.<eos> That's the law of nature, and you defied it.
From what you did.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> - You're obviously a keen student of anatomy.<eos> - Well, I get a lot of stick for it, but...<eos> Remember I said to you I had an unusually large brain?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'd like you to have it.<eos> As a token of thanks.<eos> It's only gathering dust around this place.<eos> And I feel you will give it a good home.
Well, fear's sort of an odd thing.<eos> When I was in residency, my first solo procedure was a spinal surgery on a 16-year-old kid. A girl.<eos> And at the end, after 13 hours, I was closing her up and I... I accidentally ripped her dural sack.<eos> It's at the base of the spine where all the nerves come together.<eos> Membrane as thin as tissue, and...<eos> So it ripped open. Nerves just spilled out of her like angel hair pasta, spinal fluid flowing out of her and I...<eos> The terror was just so crazy, so real and I knew I had to deal with it.<eos> So I just made a choice.<eos> I'd let the fear in.<eos> Let it take over.

That's a moth cocoon.<eos> It's ironic. Butterflies get all the attention.<eos> But moths, they spin silk.<eos> - They're stronger, faster...<eos> - That's wonderful, but...<eos> You see this little hole?<eos> This moth's just about to emerge.<eos> It's in there right now, struggling.<eos> It's digging its way through the thick hide of the cocoon.<eos> Now, I could help it.
Clark.<eos> I thought you and your mom could use moral support and a little sustenance.<eos> Thanks, Lana. My mom hasn't eaten all day.<eos> I'm sure she'll appreciate it.<eos> I'll be back soon.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Do you know Garrett Davis?<eos> Sure, he and Vince used to come by the Talon.<eos> Vince came down with this rare liver disease and he needed a transplant.<eos> I'm guessing from the past tense that he never got it.
A duck?<eos> Dude, don't be stupid!<eos> Those OC kids are professional dancers!<eos> Now come on, there's gotta be one other talneted person in South Park.<eos> - All right, so you're sure he can dance?<eos> - Oh yeah.<eos> There he is.<eos> That's Jeffy.<eos> That don't look like a dancing duck to me.<eos> Well, that's 'cause it needs music.
Really?<eos> He hasn't been home for a long time.<eos> Who the hell knows where he is?<eos> How did you survive, you and the baby... if he didn't send you any money?<eos> So don't you think women have hands or feet?<eos> Do you want to feed your baby in jail?<eos> Officer!<eos> My baby's hungry.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> If not, I'll breastfeed it here!
Thornton. It not a setback for no man.<eos> That's very true!<eos> Margaret has made friends among workers.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Extraordinary girl.<eos> - Did you notice?<eos> - We are waiting for you.<eos> Sorry it took so long to respond when you asked me what color fits better for the child.<eos> I wish to see him.<eos> I'm sure it will look great any clothe.
She likes it a lot.<eos> But she finds the ending too sad.<eos> She wonders if you can change it.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> AN HOUR LATER<eos> 10 HOURS LATER<eos> 100 HOURS LATER<eos> Taxi!<eos> I'd also like the story to have a happy ending but I don't know how to write it.<eos> Some years back, I had a happy ending in my grasp but I let it slip away.
Are you bugging?<eos> Look at her go.<eos> She can't wait to get away from him.<eos> That's no smile.<eos> That's a mask of pain.<eos> That was just phase one of my new 1 8-phase master plan.<eos> Now, just watch phase two when I get up close and personal.<eos> Excuse me, Your Highness.<eos> I found your fan.<eos> It just needed a little drying out.
You lied to us, since you here<eos> It does not do of me the murderer!<eos> Speak it to those who have died<eos> And your mission?<eos> That what you do for FBI?<eos> I am not a policeman, OK?<eos> I am sent by the Ministry of Justice<eos> I there to investigate Harris<eos> The public prosecutor wanted to know that occured<eos> To it have told, that Harris pushed training too far
As you, too, must face your glorious destiny. Think kindly of your mother.<eos> Provide for me.<eos> Protect me from your enemies when you are gone.<eos> And remember always it is I who love you more than any.<eos> If only you were not a pale reflection of my mother's heart.<eos> Who did this?<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - Hermolaus!<eos> Never will you find a man as devoted as I. Yes.<eos> The conspiracy deeply upset Alexander not only because it involved the young pages who'd shared his dream but, more intimately, it implicated Philotas his companion from boyhood, who was captain of Alexander's royal guards.
- It actually worked!<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> - Now we can...<eos> - Prevent my wedding!<eos> - What?<eos> - We could see Elvis live!<eos> - The end of the world is near - and you think of Elvis?<eos> - I dreamed of football just now.<eos> I dreamed I was a pastry cook and shaped a quarterback from marzipan.<eos> I stuck a lucky coin on top of it and put it into the shop window next to the tarts.
So that's gonna be it for the night.<eos> That concludes Christmas Eve.<eos> Merry Christmas, PRT. Merry Christmas.<eos> Santa came to Iraq just for you guys.<eos> Trying to keep skies clear for you, Santa.<eos> Do you consider yourself a proud American?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> I'm an extremely proud American.<eos> I'm probably more proud than the average Joe.<eos> When I put my flag out, I can't allow it to touch the ground.
It could take 20 years, but we`ll finally be able to answer most of the basic questions about human sexuality.<eos> - Herman, is the pot roast dry?<eos> - No, it`s delicious.<eos> The first publication will be a male volume, followed a year later by the female study.<eos> Then nine books dealing with sex offenders, homosexuality, pregnancy and abortion. And art, studied from a sexual standpoint.<eos> With the children gone, I don`t get to cook big meals anymore.<eos> Mac.<eos> Let`s get to the point.<eos> This project is one of the greatest undertaken in connection with the human animal.<eos> But without support from the Rockefeller Foundation, it will never get off the ground.
It's like my old man used to say, "Family curse.<eos> If we didn't have bad luck, we wouldn't have luck at all. "<eos> You have got to stop blaming your old man.<eos> I'm not blaming anyone.<eos> Yeah, you are.<eos> Listen to yourself. "The family curse. "<eos> Yeah, it's real. I'm a great gambler.<eos> I will give you one thing: Your dad was a piece of work.<eos> I mean, he had his own things going on.<eos> But if he did one thing right, it was not raising a complete idiot.
Well, I'm gonna get straight to the point.<eos> Someone's gonna steal the Declaration of Independence.<eos> It's true.<eos> I think I'd better put you gentlemen in touch with the FBI.<eos> - We've been to the FBI.<eos> - And?<eos> They assured us that the Declaration cannot possibly be stolen.<eos> - They're right.<eos> - My friend and I are less certain.<eos> However, if we were given the privilege of examining the document... we would be able to tell you for certain if it were actually in any danger.
His blood pressure's way down.<eos> His vital signs almost nonexistent.<eos> Can we save him?<eos> Not if I use present methods of treatment.<eos> See, conventional wisdom says I should constrict the vessels.<eos> I beg to differ.<eos> Let's break their rules.<eos> Use my rules.<eos> Body needs blood.<eos> Let's give it some.
How are you?<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'll tell you a story.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Once upon a time there was a young woman.<eos> Poor and destitute.<eos> But she had one treasure.<eos> A little child that grew inside her.<eos> She had a boyfriend too.<eos> When the child was born, they had nothing to give it.
My stomach hurts!<eos> That key doesn't seem to fit you.<eos> And you're in the wrong spot!<eos> Tired already, mister?<eos> Another round?<eos> Give up, you...<eos> But know this...<eos> Nature did not abandon the world, it is the world that abandoned nature.<eos> The tao never abandoned people, it was people who abandoned tao.<eos> As long as there is a path, there will be people following it.
He said the kitchen was so small you could barely turn around.<eos> And if you got into the toilet you had to back out.<eos> Why do you need such a nice car like this in the city?<eos> -And a BMW? It's a guy's car.<eos> -It's Ericsson. They have a deal...<eos> There's Ingvar!<eos> -Hi...<eos> -Hi... -Where are you going?<eos> -To Vika to track an injured moose.<eos> Some bloody idiot put two bullets in it's arse.
- They tell me things.<eos> It doesn't matter though, because Dad is gonna be in here a long time.<eos> No.<eos> We have court day today.<eos> They take plea.<eos> Daddy come home.<eos> You out.<eos> Annyong had hit a nerve, and Buster recalled... that right before George Sr. 's arrest, he'd made a similar threat.<eos> I said he could wear that tie.<eos> It looks better on him.

I know what I'll do: I'll give him one more chance.<eos> I'll go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then and let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him.<eos> Unless I made him stand there and put him into me.<eos> I've a mind to tell him every scrap.<eos> It's all his own fault if I am an adulteress.<eos> O, much about it if that's all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears?<eos> God knows it's not much.<eos> Doesn't everybody?<eos> Only they hide it.<eos> Then if he wants to kiss my bottom I'll drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life and he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole, and then I'll tell him I want a pound, or perhaps 30 shillings.
How if his Wendy walks the plank?<eos> You know, I really am terribly sorry about this.<eos> The irony. It comes for Hook and gets a story.<eos> No!<eos> Did you hear her hit the water?<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> The beast has swallowed her whole.<eos> Starboard side!<eos> It looks for more, captain.<eos> Then let's give it more.
"Do you like ice cream?" He asked me.<eos> I didn't know who he was.<eos> I was 16.<eos> "You are my imagination come to life," he told me.<eos> He wasn't just a great director.<eos> He gave great advice.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Fefe said you have to live spherically in many directions.<eos> Never lose your childish enthusiasm, and things will come your way.<eos> So now I was getting posthumous advice from Il Maestro, and I tried to follow it by pulling ivy, spherically and with childish enthusiasm.
We'll look out for each other.<eos> Well, if I was a Jew...<eos> I'd flee as far to the east as humanly possible.<eos> How?<eos> Sascha's in hospital.<eos> The troops are succeeding in the battle against the enemy.<eos> After heavy battles, our troops have driven the Germans...<eos> But that's mad!<eos> Join us and keep the gramophone going.<eos> It might drown out the grenades.
It's the same thing.<eos> - Do I bother you?<eos> - No, we enjoy hearing from you.<eos> Honesty is the basis of all professions.<eos> Even yours.<eos> It's a common profession.<eos> There are many people like you all over the world.<eos> Last year, in Europe, a colleague of yours a colleague of ours, I would say...<eos> Took my wallet.<eos> Seems he needed it badly.
I stole it<eos> I'm going to bed<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't I get anything?<eos> Catch it<eos> Asshole!<eos> What's up with him?<eos> You staged this, didn't you?<eos> Hell no!<eos> I'd rather buy rat poison and put it in his rice
I swear I had no idea.<eos> So, perhaps you stood outside and observed her making the sandwiches and thought that they were for her.<eos> Alors, had she died, you'd be a man very rich.<eos> This is outrageous! I told I never came into the grounds.<eos> However, if she was hanged, you would be equally rich.<eos> So, let us assume, as did the trial, that the murder, it was successful.<eos> It is easy to imagine, you or another, being aware that Elinor Carlisle intended to invite Mary Gerrard here and also to know that the preference of Mary was for the salmon paste.<eos> Both these things, they were well known.<eos> - Oh, you're including me?<eos> - I include everyone. Now this person has the file of morphine. And the chance it comes...
That's the thread. That's the M.O.?<eos> It's taking the hearts of heroes.<eos> [ Elevator Bell Dings ] So you think this demon is eatin' the hearts of heroes, huh?<eos> It's an interesting theory, and I can see where your research might seem to support that. But your theory kind of fell apart in the field.<eos> Angel, I know you've been through a horrible ordeal, and I'm not trying to--<eos> The reason why I know this Aztec demon is not eating the hearts of heroes... is... he didn't take mine.<eos> Am I honestly supposed to believe that it had no problem... sticking a sword in my stomach, but then decided, "Oh, wait. His heart's not heroic enough"?<eos> [ Chuckles ] I don't think so.<eos> I understand you're feeling rejected.<eos> But this Aztec warrior, it wants the hearts for sustenance.
You chuck it in the garbage.<eos> All the estates on Bellerophon use this automated garbage drone system.<eos> You hit one little button, and the drone whooshes off with the trash.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Except is idiotic.<eos> The drones take the disposal bins straight to reclamation.<eos> Thirty seconds after we hit the button, the booty will be incinerated.<eos> Not if we reprogram the bin.<eos> Give it new coordinates.
Right. Bearing in mind we want to be in the bar before half past ten, fingers on the buzzers and identify the following.<eos> "They puff out their hair like a cat, raise one front foot and then hop menacingly from side to side, roaring with all the fury of a clogged drain."<eos> - It's either cats...<eos> - It's actually anteaters. - (Danny) Oh!<eos> Part of the elaborate play sequences of young giant anteaters, in fact, which is known as "bluff charging".<eos> We're gonna have a few questions about anteaters.<eos> We're going to start with Alan. What would you do with a pencil and a lesser anteater?<eos> - Oh, hours of fun. - (laughter)<eos> I'd probably try and make it pick it up with its nose.<eos> And then if it really got a good grip on it, I'd encourage it to do a sketch or a note.
And you were to put that skin on some scales, how heavy would that skin weigh?<eos> - 14 stone?<eos> - No, a ton is the answer.<eos> A ton of skin?<eos> Its skin weighs a ton, it's an inch and a half thick, bullet-proof, as far as most guns are concerned.<eos> Accounts for 25% of the animal's weight.<eos> - In other words, it weighs four tons. - It weighs four tons, like a bus?<eos> Like a bus, or like any other four-ton weighing thing.<eos> Yes, more or less.<eos> So if you were to say to it, "Oh, you've put on a bit of weight",

None of us will be any the wiser, but at least we will all go home cheerful.<eos> There are no wrong answers, only boring ones, predictable ones, which attract this hullabaloo... (alarm bells)<eos> The panel can also draw attention to themselves more discreetly like this -<eos> - Clive goes... - (fanfare)<eos> - Sean goes... - (bus bell)<eos> - Linda goes... - (bicycle bell) - And Alan goes...<eos> I go, "Gozo is the second largest town in Malta", and that sort of interesting stuff.<eos> So, let's have the first question.<eos> Alan, an elephant walks into a bar.<eos> What do you offer it to drink?
Can you hang on for one sec?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Sure I didn't wake you up?<eos> No, really.<eos> I already went for a run...<eos> Nice track suit.<eos> You could've said I woke you.<eos> I wouldn't have thought less of you.<eos> Sleeping is...<eos> I don't know, it lacks a certain masculine...
I know what I'll do: I'll give him one more chance.<eos> I'll go about rather gay not too much singing a bit now and then and let him have a good eyeful out of that to make his micky stand for him.<eos> Unless I made him stand there and put him into me.<eos> I've a mind to tell him every scrap.<eos> It's all his own fault if I am an adulteress.<eos> O, much about it if that's all the harm ever we did in this vale of tears?<eos> God knows it's not much.<eos> Doesn't everybody?<eos> Only they hide it.<eos> Then if he wants to kiss my bottom I'll drag open my drawers and bulge it right out in his face as large as life and he can stick his tongue 7 miles up my hole, and then I'll tell him I want a pound, or perhaps 30 shillings.
How if his Wendy walks the plank?<eos> You know, I really am terribly sorry about this.<eos> The irony. It comes for Hook and gets a story.<eos> No!<eos> Did you hear her hit the water?<eos> Because I didn't.<eos> The beast has swallowed her whole.<eos> Starboard side!<eos> It looks for more, captain.<eos> Then let's give it more.
"Do you like ice cream?" He asked me.<eos> I didn't know who he was.<eos> I was 16.<eos> "You are my imagination come to life," he told me.<eos> He wasn't just a great director.<eos> He gave great advice.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Fefe said you have to live spherically in many directions.<eos> Never lose your childish enthusiasm, and things will come your way.<eos> So now I was getting posthumous advice from Il Maestro, and I tried to follow it by pulling ivy, spherically and with childish enthusiasm.
We'll look out for each other.<eos> Well, if I was a Jew...<eos> I'd flee as far to the east as humanly possible.<eos> How?<eos> Sascha's in hospital.<eos> The troops are succeeding in the battle against the enemy.<eos> After heavy battles, our troops have driven the Germans...<eos> But that's mad!<eos> Join us and keep the gramophone going.<eos> It might drown out the grenades.
It's the same thing.<eos> - Do I bother you?<eos> - No, we enjoy hearing from you.<eos> Honesty is the basis of all professions.<eos> Even yours.<eos> It's a common profession.<eos> There are many people like you all over the world.<eos> Last year, in Europe, a colleague of yours a colleague of ours, I would say...<eos> Took my wallet.<eos> Seems he needed it badly.
I stole it<eos> I'm going to bed<eos> Hey!<eos> Don't I get anything?<eos> Catch it<eos> Asshole!<eos> What's up with him?<eos> You staged this, didn't you?<eos> Hell no!<eos> I'd rather buy rat poison and put it in his rice
I swear I had no idea.<eos> So, perhaps you stood outside and observed her making the sandwiches and thought that they were for her.<eos> Alors, had she died, you'd be a man very rich.<eos> This is outrageous! I told I never came into the grounds.<eos> However, if she was hanged, you would be equally rich.<eos> So, let us assume, as did the trial, that the murder, it was successful.<eos> It is easy to imagine, you or another, being aware that Elinor Carlisle intended to invite Mary Gerrard here and also to know that the preference of Mary was for the salmon paste.<eos> Both these things, they were well known.<eos> - Oh, you're including me?<eos> - I include everyone. Now this person has the file of morphine. And the chance it comes...
That's the thread. That's the M.O.?<eos> It's taking the hearts of heroes.<eos> [ Elevator Bell Dings ] So you think this demon is eatin' the hearts of heroes, huh?<eos> It's an interesting theory, and I can see where your research might seem to support that. But your theory kind of fell apart in the field.<eos> Angel, I know you've been through a horrible ordeal, and I'm not trying to--<eos> The reason why I know this Aztec demon is not eating the hearts of heroes... is... he didn't take mine.<eos> Am I honestly supposed to believe that it had no problem... sticking a sword in my stomach, but then decided, "Oh, wait.

Which is?<eos> The need to feed.<eos> How do you kill them?<eos> Severing the top of the spinal column or massive trauma to the brain... are the most effective methods.<eos> You mean shoot them in the head.<eos> Why did you kill everybody down here?<eos> The T-virus escaped into the air conditioning system... and an uncontrolled pattern of infection began.<eos> The virus is protean... changing from liquid to airborne to blood transmission... depending on its environment.<eos> It's almost impossible to kill.<eos> I couldn't allow it to escape from the Hive... so I took steps.
Real nice.<eos> Okay, that's the last time I help out a friend.<eos> -Kay, you remember anything?<eos> -Goodbye.<eos> -Kay!<eos> -Kay, wait!<eos> I never got the updated software.<eos> Still working off the 6.0.<eos> Your brain needs to reboot.<eos> Give it a minute.
I have sat all this long evening by my fireside, turning towards a caving in the crumbling of the consumed coals to where I am leading myself to lifeless dust, sir.<eos> My dear friend, for I may call myself a friend, may I not?<eos> I speak to you as I would to any person who possesses my true thoughts my thoughts have spent more time in your company than anyone else's lately.<eos> Where my thoughts are, there am I in truth.<eos> "My dear friend, it has been borne in upon me that there are dangers in our continued conversation."<eos> The world would not approve of letters between a woman living in shared solitude as I do, and a man. Even if that man were a great poet.<eos> And if one is to live in this way it's imperative to appear respectable in the eyes of that world and your wife.<eos> It is a sealed pact.<eos> It is a chosen life in which I have been wondrously happy and not alone in being so.<eos> "I have chosen a way, dear friend. I must hold to it."
I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I got your message the other day.<eos> I meant to call you back, but I forgot.<eos> Don't you remember leaving me that message?<eos> Chief, this is John Klein.<eos> I didn't call him.<eos> No, it's not me.<eos> I analyzed both tapes with the voice print.<eos> I don't care.<eos> It may be my voice. It's not me.
I'm not exactly sure. I've been meaning to ask you. What's the difference between a girl who's your friend and a girlfriend?<eos> Well, I don't know. Do you want to touch her?<eos> Is that so important?<eos> Yeah, you've heard about sex, right?<eos> It is kind of a big deal. I know. I'm not stupid.<eos> And I don't want her to have another boyfriend. If I could have all those things I wouldn't really mind if I touched her or not. Well, you'll learn, Marcus.<eos> Okay, how do I look?<eos> Good. How do I look?<eos> Just be as normal as you can, okay?<eos> Good advice for Marcus. I wish I could have followed it. I'm sorry it's such a mess.
Worthing is a place in Sussex. It is a seaside resort.<eos> And where did this charitable gentlemen... with a first-class ticket for the seaside resort... find you?<eos> In a handbag.<eos> -A handbag?<eos> -Yes, Lady Bracknell.<eos> I was in a handbag-- a somewhat large, um, black leather handbag... with handles to it.<eos> An ordinary handbag, in fact.<eos> In what locality did this Mr. James or Thomas Cardew... come across this ordinary handbag?<eos> In the cloakroom at Victoria Station.<eos> It was given him in mistake for his own.
Usually people with a bag and a camera and a hat and glasses- and in extreme cases with protruding teeth, walking in packs.<eos> I think that even today there's that view of Japanese as walking in packs.<eos> Style is yooshi'ki' in Japanese.<eos> Style takes a lot of something.<eos> What's really hard to discover isn't style, but exceptions.<eos> Good! Come on!<eos> My style is not to create a style.<eos> The people and things I meet and experience doing something together with them, spending time with them, that's the feeling.<eos> I don't create a certain frame inside of which I put this style.<eos> So the style is in the counterpart, the motive, and I follow it.
Sure. What do you wanna talk about?<eos> Audrey, sort of indicated that you had something to tell me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's weird, just because it's a really good thing.<eos> I want you to be as excited about it as I am. I'm not sure right now is the best time.<eos> No, no. Now is fine. I....<eos> l wanna hear it.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Here goes.<eos> This producer in L.A., this really big producer saw our movie, and he liked it.
- Did you?<eos> - Yes, yes, I did.<eos> Well, I'm glad.<eos> Did you see anything you liked?<eos> Yeah, Mom, anything look good to you there?<eos> Yes, actually, I bought a couple of end tables for the inn.<eos> I must say I was very impressed with the selection this year.<eos> I even wound up purchasing a couple of pieces for myself.<eos> Yes, how nice to have yet another chair you can't sit in.<eos> - It's one hundred years old.
I'm glad, because these shiny golden edges are actually very sharp.<eos> They could take an eye out or cause a deep gash completely unintentionally.<eos> It's almost more a weapon than a trophy.<eos> Really? Can I hold it, then?<eos> Get out of the way, Kirk.<eos> You're blocking the door.<eos> Luke, I'll be needing one of your larger tables this morning, since your smaller tables simply cannot accommodate the sheer size<eos> - of my massive trophy.<eos> - Put it on the floor.<eos> It needs its own chair.

Have a nice day.<eos> Now, I know totally nude Fez isn't original... but everyone seems to be happy.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I'm happy too.<eos> Hey, man, remember the three-foot rule.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll stay right over here.<eos> Great.<eos> Okay, the ball's your best friend.<eos> Give it a big smile.

Perhaps I've realised what my destiny is.<eos> I've decided to have a child and raise it by myself.<eos> I want to give without expecting anything.<eos> To see my life flow into another.<eos> I realised all that in the night, in a great flood of light so pure,<eos> that I can't imagine where it came from.<eos> I'm sure that I'm not mistaken.<eos> I love you, Émilie, I love you.<eos> I wish to be the father of your child.<eos> I wish to raise it with you, to give it my strength and memory, without expecting anything.
On the way to discovering what we love, we will find everything we hate, everything that blocks our path to what we desire.<eos> The comfort will never be comfortable for those who seek what is not on the market.<eos> A systematic questioning of the idea of happiness.<eos> We'll cut the vocal chords of every empowered speaker.<eos> We'll yank the social symbols through the looking glass.<eos> We'll devalue society's currency.<eos> To confront the familiar.<eos> Society is a fraud so complete and venal... that it demands to be destroyed beyond the power of memory to recall its existence.<eos> Where there's fire, we will carry gasoline.<eos> Interrupt the continuum of everyday experience... and all the normal expectations that go with it.
Release my kids, you bastard!<eos> Damn you!<eos> You're nothing, Arthur!<eos> You hear?<eos> You loser!<eos> I dedicated my entire life to this.<eos> Every waking moment, for years.<eos> Have you ever shown that kind of dedication? Have you?<eos> The world has no time for little people like you.<eos> It needs people who are willing to do anything anything for greatness.
Well, I guess there's only one person that really knows for sure, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Where's she this summer?<eos> Hey, are you here for the mid-session performance?<eos> Guests go in the amphitheater.<eos> You can't be here.<eos> Do you know where I could find Michelle Flaherty?<eos> Guests bring food.<eos> Food attracts animals.<eos> This one time, a bear came, and then the bear had to be destroyed, which means they shot it in the head with a rifle and killed it and it died.
It was two weeks in the making.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome, doctor.<eos> - A facial prosthetic?<eos> - The aesthetic replacement does work.<eos> Emotionally and actually.<eos> The plastic in the shield blocks out abusive rays and assists in the regeneration of cells.<eos> - It's an aesthetic regenerative shield?<eos> - That's correct.<eos> The ergonomics of the plate barrier allows it to interact
What do you want to do?<eos> Listen to music.<eos> And I want you to dance to it.<eos> What music?<eos> - The Erlk^nig.<eos> You can't dance to that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Did you ask that patient about the house?<eos> Yes, I gave him your number.<eos> I don't think he can afford it, though.
Still building the place.<eos> Professor Rutherford. welcome.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Doyle. sir.<eos> Arthur Conan Doyle.<eos> yu taught me anatomy.<eos> Did I?<eos> Don't worry about paying for the cab. William.<eos> I just managed to beat you to it.<eos> and I rescued your luggage before the cabby drove off with it.
- It's impossible.<eos> And mystically unfair.<eos> You fought long and hard for good.<eos> For you to spawn something evil....<eos> Nothing spawned by Darla and me can be good.<eos> The prophecy about Angel being pivotal in the battle of good and evil.<eos> - That shanshu one?<eos> - Maybe it's not you.<eos> Maybe your child is pivotal.<eos> Maybe your destiny is to help bring it to the world.
Bet she didn't drive herself home.<eos> It's still locked.<eos> Looks clean.<eos> Hey, Catherine. Come check this out.<eos> What's that?<eos> Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim.<eos> Sanders did a trace analysis.<eos> Stuff peels off like a glove. Handy. What do you think that is there?<eos> A watch?<eos> Bag it. We can get a mould and try and track it down.
Susan, I've given this a lot of thought.<eos> And I really want to have this... egg.<eos> - You don't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Ben, if you don't want the... egg, don't say that you do.<eos> - I'll have an egg.<eos> - Me too.<eos> I'm telling you, Susan, I really want this egg.<eos> An egg isn't something you go into half-heartedly.<eos> It needs love.
Whitney, get over here!<eos> Refresh my memory.<eos> Didn't I just send a pass play in there?<eos> The rain's coming down so hard I couldn't see if Donner was open-<eos> Hey! What does it say on my jacket?<eos> - "Coach."<eos> - That's right.<eos> Football is not a democracy and you will do as I say because I know what's best for you.<eos> Now, look, son, we have run this play a hundred times in practice.<eos> You don't have to see Donner to know where he is, just throw it.
What'd you do that for?<eos> Well, you said to me that every time you suffered emotional paranoia as a result of your break-up with Sarah, I was to slap you round the face.<eos> Yes, I did say that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We could go out.<eos> What, you and me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about your stew?<eos> It's finished.<eos> I've just got to let it simmer.
Is this Jersey Girl asking the question or Jersey Boyfriend?<eos> - Both.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, there's no evidence so far that marijuana has a permanent effect on the male or female reproductive systems.<eos> A few studies have suggested that heavy marijuana use may have an effect on male testicular function but that effect would be reversible.<eos> So if Jersey Boyfriend is concerned, he should mention it to his doctor.<eos> Pixaladd wants to know if marijuana can cause cancer.<eos> No conclusive study to date has shown that it does.<eos> However, and this is a big however cellular genetic and human studies all suggest that the smoke from pot is a risk factor in acquiring respiratory disease.<eos> If Pixaladd wants to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without throwing up he should put the bong in the closet behind the Allman Brothers albums where it belongs.
You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense.<eos> -The Pentagon is Lucy.<eos> -I'm not familiar with the reference.<eos> -"Peanuts," Charlie Brown.<eos> -I'm just not conversant in them.<eos> -Why?<eos> -I've never read the comics.<eos> -Leo, were you born at the age of 55?<eos> -I know that there's a dog.<eos> Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it.

What do you want to do?<eos> Listen to music.<eos> And I want you to dance to it.<eos> What music?<eos> - The Erlk^nig.<eos> You can't dance to that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Did you ask that patient about the house?<eos> Yes, I gave him your number.<eos> I don't think he can afford it, though.
Still building the place.<eos> Professor Rutherford. welcome.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Doyle. sir.<eos> Arthur Conan Doyle.<eos> yu taught me anatomy.<eos> Did I?<eos> Don't worry about paying for the cab. William.<eos> I just managed to beat you to it.<eos> and I rescued your luggage before the cabby drove off with it.
- It's impossible.<eos> And mystically unfair.<eos> You fought long and hard for good.<eos> For you to spawn something evil....<eos> Nothing spawned by Darla and me can be good.<eos> The prophecy about Angel being pivotal in the battle of good and evil.<eos> - That shanshu one?<eos> - Maybe it's not you.<eos> Maybe your child is pivotal.<eos> Maybe your destiny is to help bring it to the world.
Bet she didn't drive herself home.<eos> It's still locked.<eos> Looks clean.<eos> Hey, Catherine. Come check this out.<eos> What's that?<eos> Liquid latex. Grissom found some on the victim.<eos> Sanders did a trace analysis.<eos> Stuff peels off like a glove. Handy. What do you think that is there?<eos> A watch?<eos> Bag it. We can get a mould and try and track it down.
Susan, I've given this a lot of thought.<eos> And I really want to have this... egg.<eos> - You don't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Ben, if you don't want the... egg, don't say that you do.<eos> - I'll have an egg.<eos> - Me too.<eos> I'm telling you, Susan, I really want this egg.<eos> An egg isn't something you go into half-heartedly.<eos> It needs love.
Whitney, get over here!<eos> Refresh my memory.<eos> Didn't I just send a pass play in there?<eos> The rain's coming down so hard I couldn't see if Donner was open-<eos> Hey! What does it say on my jacket?<eos> - "Coach."<eos> - That's right.<eos> Football is not a democracy and you will do as I say because I know what's best for you.<eos> Now, look, son, we have run this play a hundred times in practice.<eos> You don't have to see Donner to know where he is, just throw it.
What'd you do that for?<eos> Well, you said to me that every time you suffered emotional paranoia as a result of your break-up with Sarah, I was to slap you round the face.<eos> Yes, I did say that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We could go out.<eos> What, you and me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What about your stew?<eos> It's finished.<eos> I've just got to let it simmer.
Is this Jersey Girl asking the question or Jersey Boyfriend?<eos> - Both.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, there's no evidence so far that marijuana has a permanent effect on the male or female reproductive systems.<eos> A few studies have suggested that heavy marijuana use may have an effect on male testicular function but that effect would be reversible.<eos> So if Jersey Boyfriend is concerned, he should mention it to his doctor.<eos> Pixaladd wants to know if marijuana can cause cancer.<eos> No conclusive study to date has shown that it does.<eos> However, and this is a big however cellular genetic and human studies all suggest that the smoke from pot is a risk factor in acquiring respiratory disease.<eos> If Pixaladd wants to be able to walk up a flight of stairs without throwing up he should put the bong in the closet behind the Allman Brothers albums where it belongs.
You are the Charlie Brown of missile defense.<eos> -The Pentagon is Lucy.<eos> -I'm not familiar with the reference.<eos> -"Peanuts," Charlie Brown.<eos> -I'm just not conversant in them.<eos> -Why?<eos> -I've never read the comics.<eos> -Leo, were you born at the age of 55?<eos> -I know that there's a dog.<eos> Charlie Brown wanted to kick a football and Lucy would hold it.
Some folks even forget what they swing was like.<eos> Some folks even forget what they swing was like.<eos> You keep swingin'.<eos> But I don't have any balls.<eos> Don't worry about hittin' the ball the way it's gonna go.<eos> Just swing the club, feel the club.<eos> Now close your eyes.<eos> Close my-<eos> - You can't make that ball go in that hole.<eos> You got to let it.
God, it'll get ugly.<eos> They'll buy you drinks.<eos> You'll meet girls.<eos> They'll fly you places, offer drugs.<eos> It sounds great, but they aren't friends.<eos> They want snobbish stories about the rock stars' genius.<eos> They will ruin rock and strangle everything we love about it.<eos> They're trying to buy respectability for a forum that's gloriously and righteously dumb.<eos> You're smart enough to know that.<eos> The day it ceases to be dumb is the day it ceases to be real.
Half of'em don't even like it.<eos> You know who has penis envy?<eos> We do.<eos> That's why we cheat and screw up and lie, because we're all obsessed with our own equipment.<eos> - You ready?<eos> Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You don't stand in front of a mirror before a run... and wonder what the road will think of your outfit.<eos> You don't have to listen to its jokes and pretend they're funny. It would not be easier to run if you dressed sexier. The road doesn't notice if you're not wearing lipstick.<eos> It does not care how old you are.
Somebody hit me from behind.<eos> I remember.<eos> It's the last thing I do remember.<eos> Look, the police didn't believe me.<eos> If we check...<eos> How did they explain what you do remember?<eos> The gun and stuff?<eos> John G was clever.<eos> He was clever.<eos> He took the dead man's gun and replaced it with the sap he hit me with.
I'm talking to you.<eos> Yes, to you.<eos> I like your face: it's clean, and you have lively eyes, intelligent.<eos> You may be thinking that building a street, a hospital or an airport is a good thing, something that's gonna be useful for everybody.<eos> But I want you to know that here they only build to steal !<eos> They just build to make money !<eos> Go ahead, clap your hands, but this is what's actually happened.<eos> But you're not satisfied yet, are you ?<eos> You must build another strip, some more nice cement, other shady deals with the Mayor, the Region, even God Almighty !<eos> That's what progress is about, my dear friend, and it's about new jobs, houses and more tourists !
"Age of Gold" is a militantly provocative film, against the fatherland, religion, the bourgeoisie, chastity, sexual repression, and the family.<eos> The scene where the man shoots his son because he'd taken his tobacco...<eos> Charles de Noailles said,<eos> "The idea is a 20 minute film with complete freedom".<eos> I wrote the screenplay at the estate of the Count of Noailles.<eos> They left me alone during the day.<eos> At night I read them what I'd written.<eos> They objected to nothing.<eos> They thought it was all exquisite.<eos> Dali saw the film and liked it. He told me,
-There's a $20 bill folded in my pocket.<eos> This was for the maitre d'.<eos> What's it doing in my pocket?<eos> I don't know. I gave you the prescription this afternoon.<eos> I know, and I folded it up, and it was in the same pocket as the $20... and I must have put my hand in my pocket and pulled out....<eos> Did you not look at it, Larry?<eos> -lt felt like the $20.<eos> -How could that happen?<eos> -They were folded up, they felt alike!<eos> -Didn't he look at it?
I'M SURE NOTHING HAPPENED.<eos> WELL, I DON'T KNOW.<eos> AFTER WHAT YOU GUYS SAID,<eos> I WENT THROUGH SOME OF HIS STUFF...<eos> AND I FOUND THIS.<eos> YEAH?<eos> SO WHAT?<eos> THIS CLICKER ISN'T FOR OUR GARAGE DOOR.<eos> I TESTED IT.<eos> WHY WOULD HE HAVE IT?
What have you brought me, bruce?<eos> - I was hoping you could tell us, theo.<eos> - I wish i could.<eos> Meaning?<eos> The meteorite itself is comprised of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen... copper, other trace elements, exactly what we've seen in meteorites before.<eos> But the diamond isn't a diamond...<eos> there's no trace of carbon present.<eos> - Then what's it made of?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> The refractive index of the material... is so high that it actually absorbs light and doesn't allow it to escape.
Those are Annari warships.<eos> Your people are in danger.<eos> I apologize for the state of my ship.<eos> We weren't expecting company.<eos> I hope we're not imposing.<eos> Not at all.<eos> Making contact with new cultures is a priority for us.<eos> For us, too.<eos> This is a fine ship, Captain.<eos> One of the best in the fleet, but it could use a new set of deuterium injectors.
Shal tai...<eos> Shal tai.<eos> Dr. Fraiser, you may now approach.<eos> We need to get her to the infirmary.<eos> She wasn't exaggerating.<eos> The symbiote is fully adult.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Saw that.<eos> - Her immune system is breaking down?<eos> I'm not sure how much longer the symbiote will remain before it has no choice but to seek out a new host.
Steven.<eos> I'm not sensing anything.<eos> He's not Goa'uld.<eos> Steven.<eos> - He's bleeding internally.<eos> - Steven, it's me.<eos> Daniel.<eos> What happened?<eos> I took the amulet.<eos> It's over 10,000 years old, so your theory was right all along.
- It's the Tok'ra.<eos> - Open the iris.<eos> - Teal'c?<eos> - Tok'ra.<eos> Too bad.<eos> There's no traveller en route, sir.<eos> However, a transmission is being sent.<eos> Looks like my vacation is over.<eos> Thanks to Tanith, the Tok'ra intercepted this conversation between Apophis and Heru-ur.<eos> It took place less than an hour ago.
A pilot sat around on the taxpayers' dime while your guy hit sand traps.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> - See you.<eos> Okay, you can go now.<eos> No problem.<eos> - Josh.<eos> Did they burn the hamburger?<eos> - I said well-done.<eos> He likes it beyond well-done, burnt.

Not for a Sith.<eos> This is my apprentice...<eos> Darth Maul.<eos> He will find your lost ship.<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> Now there are two of them.<eos> We should not have made this bargain.<eos> An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness.<eos> Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.<eos> It is to be commended.
Ronnie got into Osbourne, as I did not.<eos> Why?<eos> As he applies himself.<eos> And Ronnie--<eos> Dickie, do you have a coin to give the fellow?<eos> No, sir, I have not.<eos> And if I may, I'm going to my room.<eos> I might suggest you take that gramophone with you.<eos> May I ask why?<eos> Because it's out of place in a civilized home.
-I see, but General Charette... -General Charette isn't here.<eos> Our commanding officer is Colonel Moncoutant.<eos> And from his earlier exhibition, it is clear that whatever his rank, he is no soldier.<eos> Never underestimate the enemy, Mr. Hornblower, but never overestimate an ally, particularly one who is caught up in his own affairs.<eos> I better go and report to him.<eos> See what he's up to.<eos> I think this is a good place to make camp, Monsieur Bowles.<eos> The men, they can rest; and tomorrow, tomorrow we take Quiberon.<eos> Darn this animal, what it needs is a rudder.<eos> Show it who's master, Mr. Hornblower.
She'll die, idiot!<eos> Relax.<eos> I won't kill you.<eos> I need your first-aid kit.<eos> Don't die.<eos> You can't die.<eos> Don't you dare die.<eos> I'll get you to a hospital.<eos> That bud is yours, professor.<eos> Let it live, let it die.
- Avengers assemble!<eos> Let's get it going!<eos> - No, I don't wanna bug them.<eos> I mean, they're just starting school and they don't need this.<eos> OK, Buff, what's the what here?<eos> It's just, what if I can't cut it?<eos> Can't cut what?<eos> Slaying. Everything.<eos> This is all about fear.<eos> It's understandable, but you can't let it control you.
-That's my watch.<eos> I was wondering where I put that.<eos> Now I feel much better.<eos> Thanks, professor.<eos> And, Amy, I'm sorry I took your watch.<eos> [SNICKERS]<eos> [COUGHS]<eos> I'll take this suit to the decontaminators.<eos> You lock up the F-ray.<eos> And for the love of God, don't let it fall into the wrong hands.
Precisely.<eos> If you've come to act as my conscience, you're a little late.<eos> I considered these issues 18 months ago, as I did again this morning.<eos> I came to the same conclusion.<eos> Your conclusion is wrong.<eos> Coffee, black.<eos> Lukewarm.<eos> Now I've told that replicator a dozen times about the temperature of my coffee.<eos> It just doesn't seem to want to listen... almost as if it's got a mind of its own, but it doesn't.<eos> A replicator operates through a series of electronic pathways that allow it to receive instructions and take appropriate action, and there you go-- a cup of coffee, a bowl of soup, a plasma conduit-- whatever we tell it to do.
It doesn't matter how I got here.<eos> I'm not going back.<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> You haven't explained your reasons for leaving the generational ship.<eos> I'm not a criminal, if that's what you think.<eos> If you leave me at the next inhabited system, I'll manage from there.<eos> Your next stop is the brig unless you answer my questions.<eos> I came aboard four days ago with one of the work details.<eos> Why?<eos> Our ship's not the paradise our leaders make it out to be.
Your opponent wasn't firing on you with an energy weapon, was he?<eos> Just his gloves.<eos> Chakotay to the Bridge.<eos> On my way.<eos> I want you back in here for some tests... unless you want to be seeing things on a regular basis.<eos> It's changed course again-- 20,000 kilometers off starboard.<eos> lon storm?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> It's two light-years across, emits enough energy for a dozen stars.<eos> It doesn't match any phenomenon in our database, and it won't sit still.
It's terrified.<eos> Can you identify yourself?<eos> It's saying that its memory's been damaged. lt doesn't remember its name.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're going to help you.<eos> Crewman Lang will remain with you.<eos> What do you think?<eos> An artificial intelligence?<eos> One that doesn't seem to realize it's artificial.<eos> Maybe we should tell it the truth, try to jog its memory.
Anything on long-range sensors?<eos> Nothing to report.<eos> As you were.<eos> Permission to speak freely, sir.<eos> Why would tonight be any different?<eos> People have been talking about you.<eos> Rumor has it you were the one who outsmarted the smart bomb.<eos> Well... not exactly.<eos> I made first contact with a sentient being.<eos> All I did was help it understand a few things.
The time of sacrifice has been declared.<eos> I fear...<eos> Simon!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Look, we've run into this kind of thing before.<eos> Now, it's not a demon.<eos> It...<eos> It's demonesque, I'll grant you.<eos> But it's just a big, ugly creature.<eos> Its Goa'uld gives it strength, intelligence, and the ability to regenerate.
- For who?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - It's a birthday message.<eos> - Let me try.<eos> - One more try!<eos> The two of you need to put your heads down on your desk.<eos> You're starting off bad.<eos> Both black and grizzly bears inhabit Glacier Park, Charlie.<eos> Hikers are told to talk or sing to keep them at bay.<eos> If I see a bear, I'm supposed to sing to it, sir?
Not for a Sith.<eos> This is my apprentice...<eos> Darth Maul.<eos> He will find your lost ship.<eos> This is getting out of hand.<eos> Now there are two of them.<eos> We should not have made this bargain.<eos> An extremely well-put-together little droid, Your Highness.<eos> Without a doubt, it saved the ship, as well as our lives.<eos> It is to be commended.

And we just weren't meant to be together.<eos> There was nothing we coulïve done other than what we did.<eos> But I was wrong to have forgotten your birthday.<eos> Mendel, you know I, I can't accept...<eos> Please, if not for yourself, then for me.<eos> Yom Kippur is coming up and I would like to face God... knowing I tried to do right by you.<eos> A ruby.<eos> Is your birthstone.<eos> I looked it up.<eos> I bought it loose. I figured finding the right setting for it is your specialty, so why interfere.
I would like to get a little even, though.<eos> What are you thinking?<eos> Oh, just go back a little in time.<eos> "The Penguin"?<eos> - Will you do the honors?<eos> - We're adults.<eos> We're lawyers. We don't do that anymore.<eos> We haven't retired the Penguin, and this guy...<eos> He's the perfect finale.<eos> - You do it! - No.
- And my brother's one of them?<eos> - I didn't come here to talk about me.<eos> - Fair enough. Peter's specific DNA allows for a blend.<eos> Like colors in a mosaic.<eos> Resequencing itself to mimic the abilities of those around him.<eos> - Like a chameleon?<eos> - More like a sponge. It's precisely why I've been studying him.<eos> Could his condition become dangerous to himself or to other people?<eos> If he absorbs too much, or comes into contact with an unstable ability, then most definitely yes.<eos> Can you fix it?
Obviously it is, because it did.<eos> House was right.<eos> A valve in your heart is narrowed.<eos> It caused the clot which lead to your stroke, and the reduced circulation caused the problem with your kidneys.<eos> And this will fix it?<eos> The balloon will force the valve back open and you'll be fine.<eos> EMMA: Can we do this without a sedative?<eos> It's very mild. There really is no risk to the fetus.<eos> We'll monitor your baby's heart rate separately.<eos> We won't allow it to decrease anywhere near dangerous levels.
You remember what I whispered to you when we were kids in the pool.<eos> And it seems that you do too.<eos> But it was not until just now that I recognized you, Max.<eos> - Little girl, listen to me!<eos> - Duflot, I said no!<eos> No way!<eos> You are not destemming those grapes.<eos> But this is the way I've always done things!<eos> We want structure and color for the wine.<eos> Leaving the stems on will give it a kick in the ass.
Our team is risking right now.<eos> He left it.<eos> This game is ours.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> They're stupids, yeah?<eos> So, what are they doing?<eos> What are they doing?<eos> I guess, someone gave me a promise to spare this body.<eos> I didn't do anything bad for it, do i?
Everyone knows that you built homes for Saddam Hussein.<eos> Please tell me what's going on.<eos> For the millionth time, I was a patsy.<eos> I've got to find a loophole to get out of this, but Buster took coma, and your mother took rehab.<eos> You're going to rehab again?<eos> I'm bringing Lindsay.<eos> I'm worried about her.<eos> Did you get the corkscrew?<eos> So there's going to be wine at the rehab, huh?<eos> Well, wine only turns into alcohol if you let it sit.
She didn't either.<eos> Guess this must be yours, then.<eos> Can you think of anything else she might've lied to you about?<eos> Any drugs she "gave up" when she married you?<eos> How are you feeling, sir?<eos> Mr. Arrington?<eos> Mr. Arrington?<eos> What's going on?<eos> His heart's not pumping enough blood to his brain.<eos> We're gonna have to give it some help.
Because this contraption, as you call it, can only be used when the car is stopped.<eos> So every time we want to ask the machine for directions, we have to pull over to the side of the road?<eos> It would appear so.<eos> I thought the point of the machine was to avoid pulling over to ask directions.<eos> If I told people, they wouldn't believe it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Apparently, there's a fight to the death between Richard and Emily and an evil german supercomputer.<eos> - I want to hear. - Oh.<eos> I thought we paid $4,000 for a computer to give us directions, not to babysit us and make decisions for us about how to live our lives.<eos> I mean, what's next -- the radio won't turn on if it doesn't like the song?
But you never finished?<eos> In my second year, my mother was diagnosed with lymphoma and I had to go back and help with the family.<eos> But I have no regrets.<eos> I'm not exactly the surgeon I dreamt of becoming, but I do own one of the top 10 plastic surgery practices in Miami.<eos> I have big dreams for this business.<eos> - Let's make the most of this association.<eos> - Let's.<eos> What are you doing, Christian?<eos> I think Oscar Wilde said it best.<eos> To get rid of temptation, you need to give in to it.
He is nothing but a horny bastard.<eos> - Oh, it's me, Grandma, it's me.<eos> Don't say that!<eos> - Why not?<eos> It's the truth.<eos> I'll say it again.<eos> It's me. - It is not the truth.<eos> Hello.<eos> I have happiness staring me right in the face, and what do I do?<eos> I stare right back at it.
I'll be waiting.<eos> - Should I put his coat on?<eos> - No.<eos> A neurologist is coming to see you.<eos> Let's start with the EKG, Mrs. Sandu.<eos> First, you have left ventricular hypertrophy meaning your blood pressure is high. It's not serious, but you should be careful with the effort.<eos> Tell her, doctor, cause she doesn't want to listen to me.<eos> And you also have a beginning of calcification on your aorta.<eos> I'll take you on our way out, but first you need to be examined.<eos> I will prescribe you a treatment, and I'd like you to follow it. You should also check with your own physician.
- Me, madam.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> She had the combination.<eos> She could have taken the jewel at any time.<eos> But what you craved, both of you, was the savagery of murder, for it aroused you.<eos> And even when Madame Kettering was dead, the violence did not end.<eos> You, Knighton, destroyed the face of the poor woman, so that doubt should be cast on her identity.<eos> And then somewhere in the darkness you dropped from the train.<eos> In your pocket was the Heart of Fire.<eos> As the train approached the Gare de Lyon, the steward knocked at the door and it was opened.
The breast implants.<eos> Still, we've found the transmitter.<eos> The Consciousness must be somewhere underneath.<eos> What about down here?<eos> Looks good to me.<eos> The Nestene Consciousness.<eos> That's it, inside the vat, a living plastic creature.<eos> Well, tip in your antiplastic and let's go.<eos> I'm not here to kill it.<eos> I've got to give it a chance.
Stop being cool.<eos> Wear a pocket protector like he does and get a haircut.<eos> Like the Asian kids who don't leave the library for 20 hours stretches, they're the ones who don't care what you think.<eos> Sayonara. [Goodbye.]<eos> So should I go through all the resumes looking for Asian names?<eos> Actually, the Asian kids are probably just responding to parental pressure, but my point is still valid.<eos> So when do they think you're getting out of here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't look sick.<eos> Better hope you're not, this equipment looks like it's 100 years old.
What's the plural of matrix?<eos> Here.<eos> It's coffee.<eos> You need to get in the shower. We got school.<eos> Took a shower yesterday.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I took a shower the day before yesterday.<eos> I'm making you a bagel. No.<eos> You need to eat.<eos> My body will tell me when it needs food.

These are growing in common sand, with only a few drops of water as irrigation.<eos> If my dad planted a crop of these, he'd never have to worry about the harvest again.<eos> Until it arrived on your dinner table.<eos> Taste it.<eos> Those were grown from irradiated seeds.<eos> - Something's wrong.<eos> It tastes...<eos> - ... rotten?<eos> That's what we've been wrestling with.<eos> See, we've successfully destroyed the genes that make a plant weak, giving it the ability to thrive under the harshest conditions.
We got a big problem in here!<eos> What's up?<eos> - I lost power to the DHD.<eos> - Why ?<eos> I told you power would be intermittent at best!<eos> We should have dialed immediately when it patched in, instead of standing around and talking!<eos> - Can you fix it? - I don't know!<eos> - They're right on top of us.<eos> - Look, we could shoot them down.<eos> Neither your weapons nor ours will damage it.
! Uh, I guess you're probably a little surprised to see me.<eos> IT ISN'T RIGHT!<eos> MAKE IT GO AWAY!<eos> Gentlemen, this is a historic day for all of boy- and mankind!<eos> In a few moments, we will know the future<eos> Ho- hold on guys.<eos> We're not sure what this device is capable of.<eos> Maybe we should wait until we've had more time to study it.<eos> We don't have tome for that, Stan!<eos> It's time to ask it a question.
Where is it ?<eos> I don't know, sweaty.<eos> It might have gone lost somewhere.<eos> I need a ride to my drums lesson...<eos> - Oh I'll take you !<eos> - ...mum !<eos> Listen, do you mind if I stay and go through some things ?<eos> I really do.<eos> Rube says the world wants balance...<eos> I say I'm ready to help the world get it.
Okay, I'm going to get some beer.<eos> Where's he going?<eos> He doesn't know where to go.<eos> He's got a nose for these things.<eos> Oh, wait till you see this wedding.<eos> Oh, my God. It's unbelievable.<eos> - I'm wearing a white dress...<eos> - That is unbelievable.<eos> Oh, stop it.<eos> It's about a zillion years old with flowing sleeves.
I'm making my amends.<eos> I've written them to everyone.<eos> Everyone, that is, except Emmett. I just... don't know what to say, except that I wish I could change everything.<eos> I'll give this to Linz.<eos> I know she'll be as proud of you as I am.<eos> Thanks, Mel.<eos> You know what's funny?<eos> When I was growing up, my father had the "serenity prayer" taped to the refrigerator.<eos> He wasn't in A.A.; Never touched a drop.<eos> He just liked it.
I obviously didn't know what I was getting myself into.<eos> It just seems to be a nasty habit I've picked up lately.<eos> So your theory is that... Garner has turned Molly into his own e-mail assassin... using hypnotic suggestion?<eos> It's not that far of a stretch.<eos> Summerholt goes from studying the brain to controlling it.<eos> A pretty amazing breakthrough, despite the application.<eos> There's no question. When it comes to brain-warping, Garner's definitely the guy.<eos> - I'm gonna go talk to Garner.<eos> - Clark, don't.<eos> - It's too dangerous.
You harder to get at than my fat wife's cunt, nigga.<eos> Yeah, you high-and-mighty Barksdales can afford to sit back and play low-key.<eos> But some of us gotta work for a goddamn living.<eos> What, you think this mess ain't fucking up our business?<eos> That means Avon's willing to sit down and talk with Marlo, work this shit out?<eos> Well, if that don't happen, String, I got you some bad news.<eos> Me and the boys had us a sit-down.<eos> Got a quorum and took a vote that says... if y'all don't quit this war, we have a mind to shut you out.<eos> And when I say out, String, I mean out the package.<eos> The boys don't wanna extend the good shit... if it's gonna keep you and your peoples out on them corners, banging.
It almost it.<eos> Whether but it will make a party of a command?<eos> It will be she as the observer, not to take part.<eos> Counted it your little sister.<eos> Not wishing to you to offend a detective.<eos> At all.<eos> Lift your seat belt<eos> We there<eos> The fleet has conceived this place for îáó÷åíèé<eos> But time within they gives us to it for Week end
A Patronus is a kind of positive force, and for the wizard who can conjure one it works something like a shield, with the dementor feeding on it rather than him.<eos> But in order for it to work, you need to think of a memory.<eos> Not just any memory, a very happy memory, a very powerful memory.<eos> Can you do this? Yes.<eos> Very well.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Concentrate.<eos> Explore your past.<eos> Do you have a memory?<eos> Allow it to fill you up.
It connects, do you understand?<eos> It goes right through Dachau. Right through childhood.<eos> Right through cockroaches and suitcases and right through America and the American dream, which I have lived.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> This noise this goddamn beautiful hiss it connects.<eos> It's the sound of the beginning of time.<eos> The leftover heat from the Big Bang.<eos> The three degrees that hasn't cooled yet.<eos> It's everywhere. - It's all around us.<eos> - It's fifteen billion years old.
You see, Riddick... there is a fundamental difference between you and I.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a psychopath.<eos> You don't appreciate art.<eos> But I believe the reason for this is something very different... than you or anyone else might think.<eos> You're an artist.<eos> I've been called a lot of things in my day.<eos> That ain't one of'em.<eos> You make art, Riddick, not analyse it.<eos> You shape it with your own hands, carve it from flesh and bone.
Aimé Césaire, Notebook of my Return to my Native Land.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - It is going well.<eos> Did you know this ostrich egg has been up there for 150 years, when this shrine to Allah was built?<eos> - Collé.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Collé.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look at this radio.<eos> It only needs batteries.
Did you know this ostrich egg has been up there for 150 years, when this shrine to Allah was built?<eos> - Collé.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Collé.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look at this radio.<eos> It only needs batteries.<eos> Pati.<eos> Pati.<eos> It must be older than my grandmother.
What harm is in that?<eos> And what is death, your mother's or yours or my own?<eos> I suppose I did say it.<eos> I didn't mean to offend the memory of your mother.<eos> -I am not thinking of the offence to my mother.<eos> -Of what then?<eos> -Of the offence to me!<eos> -O, an impossible person!<eos> Look at the sea.<eos> What does it care of offences?
They should have all gone mad<eos> Hey, raise your ass a bit<eos> Like this?<eos> That's great...<eos> No need to feel embarrassed, sorry or guilty<eos> You're past that age<eos> That's not what life's about<eos> Yeah, I agree<eos> Right!<eos> If your body wants it, give it what it wants, right?
So if you could just step a little closer and don't worry, I'm not gonna bite.<eos> I come in peace.<eos> Look, you and I we're gonna be here for a while.<eos> So I think it would be best if we could come to some sort of truce.<eos> And to facilitate this truce, I'm willing to admit, on camera, that yes, indeed I am an ass, which you probably already know.<eos> Better than most people.<eos> Perhaps better than anyone on earth.<eos> But I digress.<eos> My proposal is this..<eos> That we leave the past in the past, which is where it belongs anyway that we try and mak e the best out of this bad situation and that we get comfortable.
THAT WOULD BE THEODORE.<eos> BUT BEFORE THEY REALIZED THEY WERE IN LOVE, MY FRIEND MADE THIS... PREVIOUS COMMITMENT.<eos> MM-HM. FUCK DATE.<eos> WITH THIS REALLY, REALLY HOT FLIGHT ATTENDANT.<eos> DIJON?<eos> LIKE THE MUSTARD?<eos> GOD, HE'S A FIRST CLASS FUCK.<eos> PLUS YOUR FRIEND WILL GET FREE BONUS MILES.<eos> SO WHAT ABOUT THE REMORSE AND... GUILT?<eos> TELL HIM NOT TO SWEAT IT.
I need to know that you're gonna be there.<eos> John, are you there?<eos> Ohio.<eos> Great tragedy on the River Ohio.<eos> Great tragedy on the River Ohio.<eos> I can't call in sick just because you have a bad feeling about today.<eos> Just think about this.<eos> Gordon saw weird lights in the sky.<eos> They show up over the chemical plant.<eos> Josh gets a call from me, but it's not really me.
- I've decided to live my Iife.<eos> Oh, please !<eos> I was there with Jeffrey !<eos> You aren't living a thing, and one day you'II realize that being alone will not make you become a priest of the New Age.<eos> But I don't drool over the person that cheated on me.<eos> - Want to always be a floor mat ?<eos> - You are a manipulator !<eos> - What ?<eos> - You want to marry your beloved so you force the poor guy to ask you to marry him.<eos> Then you tear out his heart and crush it until...
Isn't it possible that some of these Jaffa are still loyal to their gods and are acting as spies within your ranks?<eos> A warrior of K'tano's experience can see within the very soul of another Jaffa and know his allegiance.<eos> Kind of a leap of faith, isn't it?<eos> No more than when Teal'c went through the rite of M'al Sharran.<eos> I saw into his heart and knew he no longer worshipped Apophis.<eos> That's not quite the same, is it?<eos> Our ways are different to you, O'Neill.<eos> Accept that.<eos> This discipline is called Mastaba.<eos> All of Imhotep's Jaffa were required to master it.
You want to tell me why this is happening?<eos> You will understand everything soon.<eos> But you must stay with me.<eos> If I stay, will you let Barbara go?<eos> Until you came, there had been no sacrifices for a year.<eos> - Dagon needs her.<eos> - Fuck Dagon!<eos> Yes.<eos> And their child will be immortal.<eos> But there's a catch! It has to live the rest of its life as some half-assed fish in the sea!
That's exactly what I said.<eos> I said that.<eos> If that's the case, what's keeping it inside this cylinder?<eos> That was Dr. Lee's idea.<eos> The top and bottom plates are electrified.<eos> The field seems to be holding it in.<eos> You're not hurting it, are you?<eos> The creature has no physical body.<eos> I don't think it's capable of feeling pain.<eos> But if it's intelligent, it might not appreciate being held in a cage.
But the parishioners felt a new sensation that day.<eos> A lightening of the spirit.<eos> A freedom from the old "tranquilit?<eos> Whoa!<eos> Fantastic!<eos> Monsieur le Comte, try one of these.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Even the Comte de Reynaud... felt strangely... released.<eos> Although, it would take another six months... before he'd work up the nerve to ask Caroline out to dinner.<eos> As for Josephine... she took over the lease at the old cafe... and gave it a new name.
I just thought you might want to know she left.<eos> She went upstairs.<eos> She said she'd be back, but I wonder.<eos> Oh, by the way, I'm not loving you as much.<eos> He's ill.<eos> The man thinks he's a fictitious character.<eos> Is there any question here?<eos> He's entrusted with the care of children.<eos> He has a psychological disorder.<eos> It's getting worse.
We knew that we would be very received.<eos> Where do you read the future, fortune-teller?<eos> In a good hot soup and in lukewarm beer.<eos> Arrive in good moment. Karabella.<eos> What, what, what, what?<eos> Did you see something?<eos> I see a treasure. A treasure?<eos> Treasure!<eos> An enormous treasure will arrive to your village.<eos> Karabella, it serves why our friend is here.
Damn catheter's blocked.<eos> Just let me get a BP on you.<eos> Stay with me!<eos> Breathe.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Just let me check you.<eos> Diastolic's over 1 25.<eos> I gotta get it down now.<eos> Just give it a few seconds to work.
I love you, Pa.<eos> Cage, come here.<eos> Take care of my son.<eos> I know you will.<eos> Don't wanna quit.<eos> I'm sorry for the pain I caused... but so help me God, I could not have done otherwise.<eos> In my heart, I am just.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Come on, Cage.<eos> "You created the moon to count months. The sun knows when it must set.
-I do not doubt- your men, Mr.Hornblower but, I have no confidence- that the Frogs would stand firm and support you.<eos> -I see, but General Charette... -General Charette isn't here.<eos> Our commanding officer is Colonel Moncoutant.<eos> And from his earlier exhibition, it is clear that whatever his rank, he is no soldier.<eos> Never underestimate the enemy, Mr. Hornblower, but never overestimate an ally, particularly one who is caught up in his own affairs.<eos> I better go and report to him.<eos> See what he's up to.<eos> I think this is a good place to make camp, Monsieur Bowles.<eos> The men, they can rest; and tomorrow, tomorrow we take Quiberon.<eos> Darn this animal, what it needs is a rudder.
But lives are saved by these rules.<eos> The same principles work with sexual harassment policies.<eos> Since it's difficult to know where the lines are being crossed we draw bigger and bolder lines, inside the boundaries of common sense.<eos> No doubt these rules seem crazy.<eos> But when you're a company paying millions of dollars in judgments suddenly they do make sense.<eos> And if you don't like it, don't work there.<eos> Go somewhere else.<eos> The plaintiffs chose to work at Cobb with full knowledge of the rules.<eos> They just broke them.<eos> Your Honor, I forgot to mention that if a rule is capricious, one shouldn't follow it.
A crew of nearly 3,000-- families mostly, mine included-- looking for a new world to settle, but they came across our friend here and he showed them what they wanted to see-- a glistening green paradise.<eos> By the time I responded to their distress call, all that was left of them was some fading engine emissions.<eos> That was 39 years ago.<eos> 39 years, two weeks, four days...<eos> Do you mind?<eos> The situation is dismal enough.<eos> I'm just trying to explain who we're up against.<eos> Well, I'm getting a pretty good idea on my own.<eos> Judging by these bio-scans, the organism's been devouring life-forms for a bit longer than 39 years.<eos> I'd estimate it's at least 200,000 years old.
If you know what to look for, a bunch of little things can tell you everything you need to know.<eos> Arms dealers. Great.<eos> Heavy stuff, too. That plane had new engines.<eos> It could probably carry a few 50-caliber machine guns maybe even a small tank.<eos> Probably shipping off to some african war off limits to legit dealers.<eos> You're sure?<eos> I mean, you saw guns?<eos> Didn't need to. Know a gunrunner when I see one.<eos> They're my people.<eos> They ship in a special lubricant and the whole hangar smells like it.
Communication, the need to talk to someone, is an act of sharing.<eos> The need to listen to someone is an act of sharing.<eos> Why do we share our culture?<eos> Why do we share language?<eos> Because we imitate each other.<eos> This is how we learn to speak.<eos> This is how a baby learns.<eos> This is how new things come into society and spread through society.<eos> Basically what keeps us together is that we copy from each other.<eos> When the spoken word was our only means of communication, we traveled far and wide to deliver it to others.
Fat in the face, jowls, fat ass.<eos> Debbie didn't get fat.<eos> Debbie is a freak of nature.<eos> Mom, you know, it's important to me that you be supportive.<eos> I cannot be supportive of this.<eos> This is a mistake.<eos> This is a big, big mistake.<eos> Now, think about your stepsister.<eos> Now, you remember what happened with her?<eos> She had the same situation as you, and she had it taken care of.
- Well, how am I supposed to know?<eos> I've only just started believing in time travel. Give me a break.<eos> Looks like witchcraft, but it isn't.<eos> It can't be.<eos> Are you gonna stand there all night?<eos> Budge up a bit, then.<eos> Sorry, there's not much room.<eos> Us two here, same bed.<eos> Tongues will wag.<eos> There's such a thing as psychic energy, but a human couldn't channel it like that.
No, no, no.No.<eos> Wes?<eos> Wes!<eos> Come on!<eos> Don't leave me!<eos> How does this happen?<eos> All wes wanted to do was serve his country, and he wound up being used as a pawn.<eos> It happens more than I'd like to think.<eos> Well, now that senator burke is gone -- oh, burke isn't the only one on the hill lining his pockets.<eos> Wherever there's power, there will be men like lex to exploit it.

- He's never going to leave me now.<eos> - Really?<eos> I understand that you're the mother but you also have to think of his interest.<eos> Yeah, it's possible.<eos> But he is already damaged.<eos> I can't take any chances.<eos> Let me see your hand.<eos> You know, it started to smell like a foot.<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> Can you move it? Yeah.
Vivian's dad and I go way back.<eos> He said you were a journalism student. Hmm.<eos> You talk about getting a tip.<eos> Okay, you won't disclose your source, but what you have done is let your imagination run wild. No, no.<eos> What if I told you that my source happened to be a certain Joe Strombel?<eos> The late Joe Strombel?<eos> Yep.<eos> You mean, before he died he gave a student reporter a major story and didn't follow it up himself?<eos> We didn't say it was before he died. What? No, it...<eos> He got the story before he died, and then he died before he could follow it up. (CHUCKLES) Well, why did he give it to you?
what came to you in that package is of no interest to me.<eos> my only interest is your well-being.<eos> martha, let me take care of this for you.<eos> where's katherine ?<eos> back at home.<eos> but don't worry. we've called off the dogs.<eos> you'll be happy to know that we've replaced the tubing.<eos> we calibrated a few of the servomechanisms.<eos> your arm is even better than before.<eos> i can't wait to use it to smash your skull in.
You think there's any way I would've done that before Cuddy messed with my brain?<eos> She was trying to help you, and it worked.<eos> Yeah, I can run like the wind, but I can't think.<eos> And seeing as how I'm too old to become a professional athlete, it looks to me as if she screwed me over big time.<eos> You don't want a healthy leg.<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> If you've got a good life, if you're healthy, you've got no reason to bitch.<eos> - No reason to hate life.<eos> - Here's the flaw in your argument.<eos> If I enjoy hating life, I don't hate life, I enjoy it.
Just hold on. Hold on just a tick.<eos> Just a tiny little, just a...tick.<eos> If you think about it, the particles activated in Donna and drew her inside my spaceship.<eos> So reverse it, the spaceship comes to her.<eos> Fire!<eos> Off we go, then.<eos> My key!<eos> Oh, do you know what you said before about a time machine?<eos> Well, I lied.<eos> And now we're gonna use it.
- Not any more.<eos> Go right in.<eos> It's not that naive belief is undermined, deconstructed through irony.<eos> Von Trier wants to be serious with the magic.<eos> Irony is put into service to make us believe.<eos> Yet again, Grace had made a miraculous escape from her pursuers with the aid of the people of Dogville.<eos> Everyone had covered up for her, including Chuck, who had to admit that it was probably Tom's hat he'd mistakenly considered so suspicious.<eos> The mystery is that even if we know that it's only staged, that it's a fiction, it still fascinates us.<eos> That's the fundamental magic of it.<eos> You witness a certain seductive scene, then you are shown that it's just a fake, stage machinery behind, but you are still fascinated by it.
Valerie.<eos> Ellen van Laak Agency.<eos> Can we see you walk, please?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please ty it one more time.<eos> lm very sorry.<eos> Do you have another card?<eos> Suggest a solution.<eos> The card seems to be faulty.<eos> But I sinned with it just yesterday.
Mine was Stairway to Heaven.<eos> God! Makes me feel so old.<eos> God, I miss that time.<eos> Nothing to do but chill and have fun.<eos> No responsibilities.<eos> All that ends when you have kids.<eos> That feeling of freedom, nobody demanding anything from you.<eos> That's what youth is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I guess I should try and enjoy it more while I still can.

- Stop it.<eos> We'll go underground.<eos> Sneak attacks at night.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> We're the resistance, Ray.<eos> They can't occupy this country.<eos> Occupations always fail.<eos> History's taught us that a thousand times.<eos> This is our land.<eos> We eat it, we breathe it, only we can live on it.
You've got to turn your life around<eos> What do you really want to do?<eos> You need to think of your family, your sick mother<eos> You can't go on like this!<eos> If you want to start a new job or invest in something I can give you whatever you need<eos> Why not work with me?<eos> Who'd be better than you?<eos> For months now you've been sitting at home... avoiding work, life and university<eos> You've been given a new life.<eos> Take advantage of it!
I'm out in the prime cut of the big green.<eos> Behind me is Ed and Rowdy, members of an up-and-coming subadult gang.<eos> They're challenging everything, including me.<eos> Goes with the territory.<eos> If I show weakness, if I retreat,<eos> I may be hurt, I may be killed.<eos> For once there is weakness, they will exploit it, they will take me out, they will decapitate me, they will chop me into bits and pieces.
Well, it's too early to say<eos> but I'll give you a thorough examination.<eos> You kill yourself to make them happy and what thanks do you get?<eos> I've been thinking about it all afternoon and it's just as well.<eos> What's just as well?<eos> It's just as well, because we weren't going anywhere.<eos> Marriage, mortgage, job, children, you get old and you die.<eos> - What's that?<eos> That's not life.<eos> Life is something else and we're starting to enjoy it now.
He won't sleep anymore.<eos> And at night, we'll do the usual stuff<eos> because we like it and because it's fun.<eos> Come on.<eos> You'll waken her.<eos> You're a nervous spirit!<eos> Come here, come here.<eos> You have to control your nerves even in the most extreme situations!<eos> The mind.<eos> I don't know where this unbridled passion will lead me but I have to live it, feel it, enjoy it... "
- Well, I'll survive.<eos> Come here.<eos> No.<eos> John, I didn't come here for that.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You're going into gardening full time.<eos> What happened to college?<eos> - I decided not to go.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, an opportunity has presented itself, and for me to take advantage of it, I need to start making money.
Get out, get out!<eos> Mickey!<eos> Get out of there.<eos> - No! Leave him, just leave him!<eos> - Get in here.<eos> Doctor, wake up.<eos> I'm gonna get killed by a Christmas tree!<eos> Help me.<eos> Remote control.<eos> But who's controlling it?
I meant poppers.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Not bad.<eos> This one is intriguing.<eos> I've always responded to the raw, unfinished quality of your work.<eos> Is that a compliment, or are you letting me down easy?<eos> Well, if you're asking me if I'd consider you for the emerging artists show, the answer is yes.<eos> Thanks Linds.<eos> But I don't want to take advantage of our friendship.<eos> I don't consider it taken advantage of, provided the work is good. And that we're still friends.
- Stop it.<eos> We'll go underground.<eos> Sneak attacks at night.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> We're the resistance, Ray.<eos> They can't occupy this country.<eos> Occupations always fail.<eos> History's taught us that a thousand times.<eos> This is our land.<eos> We eat it, we breathe it, only we can live on it.

Have you seen what it's doing outside?<eos> It's practically a monsoon.<eos> When it lets up, I say we head off to Mexico, grow moustaches and become drug lords.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Why do I bother?<eos> I don't hear you coming up with some brilliant plan.<eos> I'd better, and soon.<eos> We're running out of cash, fast.<eos> You have a credit card.<eos> If I use it, they can track us.
- Any progress on the D-day anniversary?<eos> The accelerated release of information is a concern of everyone in today's White House.<eos> They all have to consider how the message will play in the press.<eos> FBI put something on the president's schedule?<eos> - Who's asking?<eos> - So far, just me.<eos> - There have been times where for her own sake, in order to do her job and for her to remain an honest source for reporters...<eos> - If the reporters see the director here...<eos> - Yeah, he's just stopping by.<eos> If she were to have information, she would be ethically bound to share it and I don't wanna put her in that position.
Are you there?<eos> It's me.<eos> -Who is this?<eos> - You know who it is.<eos> Come on, llleana.<eos> You didn't fall for James Costa.<eos> Somebody as beautiful and powerful as you doesn't fall for a faggy art dealer.<eos> Okay?<eos> That guy was nothing, all right?<eos> I didn 't take his life, I lived it.
"I remember the day I graduated from protégé to confidant.<eos> "He never meant to let me in on his secrets.<eos> "He thrived on his own mystery. "But once the first one was discovered... "it wasn't long before there were none left between us.<eos> "He strode across campus with purpose. "Everything about Tommy said ready."<eos> - I'm Tommy, just so you can follow.<eos> - Sounds just like you.<eos> "He almost skipped right passed me.<eos> "'Nice hat,' I said...<eos> "eliciting Tommy's notorious smile.<eos> "It was the same smile that he granted to each woman that caught his eye.
I lose pens all the time.<eos> Won't it cost money to fix the door?<eos> Get in through here.<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> Hold onto this.<eos> Okay<eos> Comfortable?<eos> What's the baseball bat for?<eos> Do you beat up people with it?

- Well..<eos> - Yes. "Well, you decide. you decide...<eos> Grace, they say you are having some trouble here."<eos> No.<eos> No more trouble than back home.<eos> I'll give you a little time to think about this.<eos> - Perhaps you will change your mind.<eos> - I won't.<eos> "Listen, my love.. power is not so bad..."<eos> I am sure that you can find a way to make use of it in your own fashion...
You are walking through it howsomever.<eos> I am, a stride at a time.<eos> A very short space of time through very short times of space.<eos> Exactly: and that is the ineluctable modality of the audible<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> No.<eos> Jesus!<eos> I am getting on nicely in the dark.<eos> My ash sword hangs at my side.<eos> Tap with it: they do.
"Like Orpheus, his stubbled cheek, a field of gold. "<eos> - You said that?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> Could we be serious andjust talk about the painting for a minute?<eos> The painting belongs to Roxy because she cared enough about it to take it with her.<eos> She had our blessings, as in everything.<eos> Right, Margeeve?<eos> I don't think we should sell it.<eos> I think we should lend it to museums.<eos> Everyone can see it.
Our conversation had last a quarter of an hour.<eos> A few minutes later, he left, he went outside and he was killed.<eos> I had to get out of there fast, my foot was close to the funeral pyre.<eos> The fire was already burning.<eos> Nehru announcing the Gandhi's death.<eos> He sensed death, but it isn't sad.<eos> It has a finality, doesn't it?<eos> I always had a passion for painting.<eos> When I was a child I painted Thursdays and Saturdays.<eos> The rest of time I claimed about it.
Morning, Abby.<eos> How are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> A love affair or just sex?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> What do the police know?<eos> Enough.<eos> Look, I'll...<eos> I'll withdraw from the story.<eos> I'll let Della run it from here.
- Well..<eos> - Yes.

My dear Count, it's far too hot in here and you're fully dressed.<eos> - I think the clearest beneficiary... is Fernand, Count Mondego.<eos> I don't understand what this inquisition has to do with our business relationship.<eos> I'm about to tell you.<eos> Sit down, Mondego.<eos> And I have furthered these ambitions... by scooping up Bonapartists.<eos> But now with Napoleon on the loose, I have, shall I say, a thorn in my side.<eos> Once merely an irritation, now potentially lethal.<eos> - Be lethal in turn.<eos> - Well, the problem is such... that I, myself, cannot attend to it.
So I'm gonna stay.<eos> I'm gonna stay in Orange County.<eos> You are!<eos> Stanford sucks!<eos> "Dear Mr. Skinner, I'm writing you to say thank you... for all your words of wisdom.<eos> It took me a while, but I finally realized...<eos> Orange County is the perfect environment... for an aspiring writer.<eos> Today I went down to the beach with a copy of your book.<eos> I left it there by the water.<eos> Maybe another mixed-up kid will stumble upon it.
Why not me?<eos> What did I do that he didn't?<eos> She just wanted to be heard.<eos> He wants me to go away.<eos> My wife was not supposed to have a child!<eos> All I ever wanted was you.<eos> Don't you understand, Rachel?<eos> But he doesn't know.<eos> She never sleeps.<eos> You take one person's tragedy and force the world to experience it.
Okay.<eos> Why don't you give me a bigger smile, james?<eos> Come on, big, bigger.<eos> Okay.<eos> You forget your old life.<eos> You can't come back.<eos> You can't call.<eos> You can't write.<eos> You never look back.<eos> You make a new life for yourself, And you live it.
From now on, that apartment is mine.<eos> I'm going to live with Rinko!<eos> You lazy bastard!<eos> It smells good, the meat-stuffed bellpepper smells good!<eos> Husband's favorite!<eos> And that goes in the miso soup.<eos> Looks good...<eos> I found an old camera when I was going through my closet.<eos> One that I'd used as a kid.<eos> I wish I could have taken your photos with it.

Impressive, isn't it?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's the first thing I ever won. It was probably the last time I ever felt pure victory.<eos> No pressure, nobody breathing down my back. Just driving because I loved it. Pure.<eos> Doing it naturally, for you. I don't have your gift, but I do have some things you don't have.<eos> I got will and I got faith. Don't laugh, I'm serious.<eos> I believe that you can will yourself into anything and do anything.<eos> Having faith, that's like believing in--<eos> That's like having a good disease, it's contagious.<eos> Hang with people that have it, you' re gonna catch it. That'll change your attitude.
Could you let us in your backyard, ma'am?<eos> We've got a couple boys back there.<eos> I think you may have broken an ankle.<eos> Well, that's not terribly serious, is it?<eos> Do you have an alternate?<eos> No.<eos> Ready?<eos> Are there priests on call?<eos> Why don't you bring the car around, Anwar.<eos> At which point, I apparently lost control of the vehicle smashed it into the house, and killed that poor dog.
Sorry for putting you in a difficult position.<eos> But I don't regret declaring myself.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Incredibly.<eos> I feel wonderful.<eos> I'm disappointed that you can't reciprocate my feelings... ... butcontinuingto suppressthem would have been much more malignant.<eos> Really?<eos> You gotta figure, over 6 billion people on Earth.<eos> What are the needle-in-a-haystack odds you'll find that soul mate?<eos> And consider the logic of coming across somebody who could be it... ... andthenkeepingittoyourself.
Are you with me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Studies show that a man whose partner has been inseminated by another man is at risk with respect to propagation.<eos> Jealousy leads to passion.<eos> Passion to orgasm.<eos> Orgasm to sperm retention.<eos> You schtupped this other man because you want to have Mark's child.<eos> I doubt he'll go for that.<eos> I've given you my wisdom.<eos> You choose what to do with it.

A magnificent, even sublime mirror.<eos> They will tremble.<eos> They will weep.<eos> Most of all, they will admire.<eos> And everywhere, they will honor you.<eos> There is not another like you at court, Lully.<eos> That would be one too many.<eos> Grant me the privilege, Sire.<eos> To me alone.<eos> I'll use it better than anyone.
Got it? Hajija.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> -What do you think?<eos> I'm under arrest.<eos> -Then why ask?<eos> -My natural curiousity.<eos> I'm giving you a long rope.<eos> I bet it doesn't even reach the courtroom.<eos> A really, long rope. Ok?<eos> -Hang yourself with it. Ok?
How?<eos> I'd start by saying he's terrible, then upgrade him to not great.<eos> I don't think that'll work.<eos> Do you love this man?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then you owe it to him to let him know how inadequate he is.<eos> If you do get married, you'll always be telling him anyway.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> [WHISTLES "CUCKOO"] Try to help...<eos> However much I know otherwise part of me has always felt life has no meaning until you share it with somebody.
She must have paid off some Volunteer. There's a price for everything.<eos> - So, what did you find out?<eos> Well, I enhanced the EMP device from the image off the TV.<eos> It's definitely black market, a few people can even make a product like this.<eos> Yeah, and they get a fortune for it.<eos> - How dangerous is it?<eos> - Well, let's put it this way:<eos> For Zo'or's sake, I hope he's made peace with the Commonality.<eos> Let's talk about Julie Peyton, and all things the Taelons tried to hush up.<eos> We've been given a unique opportunity to spread our message. Let's not waste it.
-This is nice, isn't it?<eos> - It's wonderful.<eos> Where's the guy with the water already?<eos> I'm dying here.<eos> Good.<eos> Before you go, would you make a toast?<eos> Okay... here's to water.<eos> The earth is covered with it.

To my family and to all friends and strangers.<eos> This is a message and a prayer.<eos> The message is that my travels taught me a great truth.<eos> I already had what everyone is searching for and few ever find:<eos> The one person in the world who I was born to love forever.<eos> A person like me, of the Outer Banks and the blue Atlantic mystery.<eos> A person rich in simple treasures self-made, self-taught.<eos> A harbor where I am forever home.<eos> And no wind or trouble or even a little death can knock down this house.<eos> The prayer is that everyone in the world can know this kind of love and be healed by it.
My wife was happy.<eos> My kids had good medical, good schools.<eos> Got a great house.<eos> I mean, what the hell is wrong with that?<eos> Nothing's wrong with that.<eos> That's it. You're making money. You're providing for your family.<eos> What could be wrong with that?<eos> I always thought of myself as a man of science, that's what's wrong with it.<eos> Then you're in a state of conflict, Jeff. Because look, here's how it lays out.<eos> If you've got vital insider stuff, the American people, for their welfare, really do need to know, and you feel impelled to disclose it... and violate your agreement in doing so, that's one thing.
...I want you to buy the collection.<eos> ...Me?<eos> Yes.<eos> ...The business school doesn't need it...<eos> ...I don't mean that.<eos> I want you personally to buy the collection.<eos> You've got a million dollars, haven't you?<eos> I'm sure you'd get it for a reasonable price.<eos> ...Why should I want it?<eos> ...Because I know you're interested in it.

Oh, who's that?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Let's go see... let's go see who it is.<eos> Hey. Oh!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is this Roz Doyle's apartment?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You her date?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen up. You go out with Roz tonight, I will rip off your arm, ram it down your throat, and use it to squeeze your heart until it stops beating.
Hey, is the show still on?<eos> Almost over, man.<eos> Hey, Nonnie.<eos> Is that the pope?<eos> Why am I looking?<eos> Oh, here I am!<eos> This is my big scene.<eos> All right, back off!<eos> I got a gun!<eos> I'm not afraid to use it.

So what do you want?<eos> Well, I could take you through it step by step or you could take this with you and study it.<eos> It's a little complicated but...<eos> It's an unspoken rule of the Harvard Club, Jan.<eos> Business is never transacted here.<eos> I meant, what do you want to drink?<eos> I wanted to reach across and strangle him with his tie.<eos> Instead, I sat there for two hours and listened to him talk about selling his yacht.<eos> You know, sometimes I actually prefer the 35-footer.<eos> Because I can crew it myself, I can be all by myself out there alone. It's magnificent.
MORAL<eos> Do you know what moral is?<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> Moral is for the people that own it, for the rich.
- Everything okay over here?<eos> - You?<eos> - I might need a touch more clay.<eos> I've been down this road<eos> Cro-Magnon<eos> Maybe it was some kind of implant.<eos> Everything in that class is natural.<eos> - Did that look natural?<eos> - It looked supernatural.<eos> You gonna finish that sausage or wave it around?

- How did you know?<eos> - Don't hate yourself over the photos.<eos> We should hope that's as dirty as our hands get on this job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Billy.<eos> You know what I said before about drawing lines?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about...<eos> We say we're friends like it's a consolation prize...<eos> The truth um for me... Our friendship is the greatest thing I have.<eos> I cherish it.
But it isn't.<eos> The next meeting it will be.<eos> These chairs will be filled with your fellow partners people whose eyes you look into for respect acceptance.<eos> They know the situation.<eos> But an excellent idea.<eos> They may know the facts, but they've only heard you tell them.<eos> My presentation may be less exonerating.<eos> My presentation may have the added impact of, well, presentation.<eos> One, if made in front of a jury, would incur embarrassment to your firm.<eos> A firm that, correct me if I'm wrong, cherishes reputation flaunts it for recruitment purposes.
I am not throwin' away my shot!<eos> I am not throwin' away my shot!<eos> Hey yo, I'm just like my country, I'm young scrappy and hungry<eos> And I'm not throwin' away my shot!<eos> I am not throwin' away my shot!<eos> HAMILTON:<eos> 'Til the world turns upside down...<eos> 'Til the world turns upside down!<eos> I imagine death so much it feels more like a memory<eos> This is where it gets me: on my feet The enemy ahead of me
I disagree<eos> BURR:<eos> And if it fails?<eos> HAMILTON:<eos> Burr, that's why we need it<eos> BURR:<eos> The constitution's a mess HAMILTON:<eos> So it needs amendments<eos> BURR:<eos> It's full of contradictions HAMILTON:
- You took a man's life.<eos> - Hey, nobody.. Took anything.<eos> You're a businessman, right?<eos> You understand that.<eos> The kid, Anna, she's alive thanks to you.<eos> That's bullshit, I.. I could've, I could've cut that guy a check.<eos> Really?<eos> But would you have?<eos> Eddie, I get that you're disappointed.<eos> You thought you were buying a new car and it turns out.. That it had a few miles on it.
I just needs a ride!<eos> I haves official Boov business out of in town.<eos> Me, too.<eos> But I fixes your car!<eos> So?<eos> I let you out of the freezer.<eos> We're even.<eos> - What did you do to my car?<eos> - What doos you mean?<eos> It should to hover much better now.
Me, too.<eos> But I fixes your car!<eos> So?<eos> I let you out of the freezer.<eos> We're even.<eos> - What did you do to my car?<eos> - What doos you mean?<eos> It should to hover much better now.<eos> It's a car.<eos> It didn't hover at all before.
Let's go.<eos> Stop him!<eos> That's him.<eos> Better be, or he's got one hell of a lawsuit.<eos> You softened them up pretty good.<eos> Remember me?<eos> Sure,you're thepartygirl<eos> - we had all those nice games with. - Right.<eos> I had so much fun, I can't stand that that party is over.<eos> I wanted it to go on forever.
- Isn't the water a bit dirty?<eos> - Want another one?<eos> - For your mother?<eos> I don't think she likes them.<eos> Will you take a look at the junk and decide what you want? And then we can take the rest to the déchetterie.<eos> OK.<eos> I've made you hot chocolate.<eos> They used to make epaulettes in the village, for the shoulders.<eos> For soldiers.<eos> Because the water is very soft, it's very pure. It's good for the fabric.
- Mum. I'm...<eos> I'm just not... sure what we'll need.<eos> Maybe I'll make a cake.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - No. This.<eos> This,... this and this.<eos> All this... life.<eos> I wonder what happened to that sandwich toaster.<eos> Oh, I liked this oven.<eos> It was very...
Fuck, yeah.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> - Hey, go easy on him. - Easy?<eos> He's fine.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, I'm fine, but the truck...<eos> Yeah, the truck is towed.<eos> It's going to take a few days to fix it.<eos> I think we can afford it. I don't know about the paint job.<eos> It won't be original, but I can get it close.
No fucking M.C. No fucking whip. No fucking costumes!<eos> That was a brilliant idea, throwing the costumes out the window?<eos> Stupid!<eos> - Just chill, man.<eos> - No, it's an omen, okay?<eos> It's a sign.<eos> We're exactly where we're supposed to be.<eos> All right?<eos> Please spare us the fucking Gandhi routine right now!<eos> You have so much anger, and it is all in your heart chakra, and it's fucking toxic.
Shame is a terrible emotion for a man.<eos> To lose your dignity in front of your wife and children...<eos> I took any work I could find.<eos> I spent four months in Starbucks, making coffee for kids and guys who used to work for me.<eos> The car we had broke down, so I just drove off the lot.<eos> All my friends were going to college.<eos> We were teaching our kids how to walk.<eos> I wish I could have gone to college.<eos> It felt so good just to make M.J. happy.<eos> When I think back to my life before that awful night, it's like looking at a watercolor.
Well, there was this magical dolphin from the future who shot us out of his blowhole, and...<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait.<eos> That's not in the book.<eos> Book?<eos> There is no magical dolphin in this story.<eos> What story?<eos> The story of how Bikini Bottom was brought to its knees when its beloved Krabby Patty formula was stolen by me,<eos> Burger Beard.<eos> How does it end?
But why?<eos> Well, I was amazed that someone as clever as you couldn't find proper work at home.<eos> I've been here too long.<eos> I forget what it's like in Ireland.<eos> So when your sister wrote to me about you, I said the Church would try to help.<eos> Anyway, we need Irish girls in Brooklyn.<eos> I wish that I could stop feeling that I want to be an Irish girl in Ireland.<eos> All I can say is that it will pass.<eos> Homesickness is like most sicknesses.<eos> It'll make you feel wretched and then it'll move on to somebody else.
Now, Taylor v. Standard Gas Company is one of the most important corporate cases decided in the Supreme Court in the last 20 years.<eos> This was the case responsible for the Deep Rock Doctrine, so it's maybe the biggest milestone in parent-subsidiary law.<eos> In public utility integration proceedings alone, literally thousands of investors may be affected by its application.<eos> Did you understand any of that?<eos> I mean, a single word?<eos> He's not even reading from a book.<eos> He just knows all this.<eos> Well, let's hope the next hour's easier, huh?<eos> One of the things that ruins Christmas in America is the turkey.<eos> It all tastes of sawdust.
Parkway's next stop.<eos> Parkway's next.<eos> It certainly feels like it, but this is my first year, so I don't know how to judge.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> You've survived your first New York winter. Ah.<eos> Wasn't so bad.<eos> Really?<eos> It's colder in Ireland?<eos> Oh, no, it's colder here.<eos> Over here that's how we judge the winter, on how cold it is.
Dear Rose.<eos> I suppose the most important news is that I have a boyfriend.<eos> He isn't as important as Bartocci's and my night classes, I know that, but I want to tell you everything that's going on.<eos> Please don't mention it to Mammy, though.<eos> You know what she's like.<eos> He's decent and kind, and he has a job and he works hard.<eos> We go to the cinema on Wednesdays and he takes me to Father Flood's dance on Saturdays.<eos> I think of you and Mother every single day, but Tony has helped me to feel that I have a life here I didn't have before I met him.<eos> My body was here, but my life was back in Ireland with you.<eos> Now it's halfway across the sea.
That's not enough for me.<eos> This year McEwen is the only team standing in my way.<eos> That is why I wanted you.<eos> - So...<eos> - This needs to be discreet.<eos> It needs to be safe.<eos> No holes.<eos> I will pose as a disgruntled team engineer of yours offering to sell the EXR to McEwen.<eos> What I will give him is a fake.<eos> It doesn't really do anything, just gives false readings to their instruments.
Thor.<eos> The Legionnaire.<eos> Trail went cold about 100 miles out, but it's headed north.<eos> And it has the sceptre.<eos> Now we have to retrieve it, again.<eos> Genie's out of that bottle.<eos> Clear and present is Ultron.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You built this program.<eos> Why is it trying to kill us?
Arnold was my grandfather, sir.<eos> But he died before I was born.<eos> His music demands a certain quality of application. But the rewards validate the effort.<eos> One of the things I'd most look forward to about, uh, working here is exploring your larger scale...<eos> And Judge Schoenberg is your father.<eos> Retired now, yes, sir.<eos> Outstanding lineage, Mr. Schoenberg.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> What happened in Pasadena?<eos> Well, I took a risk. Set up my own law firm, and it didn't pay off, you know.
- What happened?<eos> - I think it snapped!<eos> I think it snapped!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, it's broken!<eos> I'll call the ambulance!<eos> Just hold on!<eos> I mean, all we have is an image problem on our hands, Lito.<eos> What matters most is everybody understands that that disgraceful picture is a violation of your privacy.<eos> No one can prove it's even real.
It means time travel.<eos> I mean, that's what that means.<eos> What?<eos> Holy shit!<eos> So you're telling me Dad left a time machine in the basement?<eos> Well... I mean, I guess technically, he left blueprints, but...<eos> Still... Slow down for one second, okay.<eos> Let's just all take a beat here.<eos> DARPA designed this.<eos> So it could actually be real, right?
- We built a time machine. -We built a time machine.<eos> Smoke!<eos> Shit!<eos> The cables!<eos> - Get the fire extinguisher!<eos> -Oh, my God. My car!<eos> So, what's with the backpack?<eos> I'm reducing the width of frame so the machine can fit inside a 22-by-14-inch backpack.<eos> So we could just walk around with it?<eos> - It'd only weigh 8 pounds.
- Where's Adam?<eos> -Adam!<eos> What the hell? What the hell?<eos> - My God, please tell me you got that. -Are you all right? Please tell me you got all that.<eos> You all right, buddy?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> We're okay.<eos> Did it work?<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Well, if it worked, it's not gonna be here until we drive it here tomorrow.
- We can do anything.<eos> -We can meet anyone.<eos> Literally.<eos> You guys, we invented freaking time travel!<eos> Why don't we sell this thing to Richard Branson for, like, a zillion dollars?<eos> We didn't invent anything, first of all.<eos> We just put it together with the directions that we had over there, so...<eos> You make it sound like we got it at IKEA.<eos> Okay, we can't sell it.<eos> No chance. We don't even know what it is. We don't even know what it can do yet.
Don't worry, he can't hear us.<eos> He is pretty smart, huh?<eos> Experiment 16.<eos> Attempting to extend the time differential between two and four years with minimal voltage input.<eos> David?<eos> You're still down here?<eos> - Jess. Hey.<eos> Sorry, I think I left my English folder.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> It's right there.
There's no problem with my product choice.<eos> Do you know what QVC stands for, Joy?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Quality, Value, Convenience.<eos> I sell product affordably, but I don't sell cheap product.<eos> And your mop is plastic and it looks strange.<eos> I don't know anything about charts.<eos> Or business, frankly.<eos> But I do clean my own home.<eos> And I made this mop because it is better than anything else out there.

It could have been handled better.<eos> I'll let Todd have another shot.<eos> I don't want Todd or anyone else to try it.<eos> It should be me.<eos> We don't have regular people.<eos> We have celebrities or spokesmodels do the selling.<eos> I told you this.<eos> Who showed you the mop?<eos> Who sold it to you? Who taught you how to use it?<eos> And who convinced you that it was great after you thought it was worthless?
That is actually exactly how I was inspired to invent this mop.<eos> There was glass shattered everywhere.<eos> I was with my two kids, with my father, and I<eos> Every time I would wring the mop, I would get glass shards in my hands.<eos> And the old mop just wasn't very absorbent.<eos> So I went to my daughter's room, and I borrowed her crayons and I designed this mop.<eos> Make sure you get down there. Yeah, that's it.<eos> It's made of plastic, so it's lightweight, but very durable.<eos> Go in. Go in to the hands.<eos> It's extremely absorbent with 300 continuous cotton loops that I looped myself when I designed it.

Here you go.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Now turn it on.<eos> There we go.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Mr. McKay didn't have a kitchen?<eos> We had a kitchen, obviously.<eos> Just, I never went in there.<eos> It was in a different part of the house.
No!<eos> In the morning, you go.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I had no idea we had... the best pilot in the Resistance on board.<eos> Comfortable?<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm impressed.<eos> No one has been able to get out of you... what you did with the map.<eos> You might want to rethink your technique.<eos> Where is it?

At night, desperate to sleep.<eos> You imagine an ocean.<eos> I see it.<eos> I see the island.<eos> And Han Solo.<eos> You feel like he's the father you never had.<eos> He would have disappointed you.<eos> Get out of my head.<eos> I know you've seen the map.<eos> It's in there.
I'll mind it myself.<eos> With that tincture of opium?<eos> You went through my things?<eos> My wife's possessions?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Well, you shouldn't have!<eos> Give it back, you dumb imbecile!<eos> Don't hurl insults at Chicory, he's following' orders.<eos> Now give over that bottle.<eos> It ain't yours to claim.
Yeah, I'm coming.<eos> I gotta talk to Julius first.<eos> I'm not gonna go without you.<eos> You gotta go, Jakey.<eos> You gotta take care of Vee.<eos> I'm coming, I promise.<eos> I'll be there at your wedding.<eos> What's the grin for, Bud?<eos> I saved the fish.<eos> It swam away.
Ghosts?<eos> Well, the ghosts are just a metaphor...<eos> They've always fascinated me.<eos> You see, where I come from ghosts are not to be taken lightly.<eos> Sir Thomas Sharpe.<eos> Welcome to our fair city.<eos> Sir. It's my pleasure.<eos> I see you've already met my daughter, Edith.<eos> The Sharpe clay mines have been royal purveyors of the purest scarlet clay since 1796.<eos> In its liquid form, it is so rich in ore and so malleable that it can produce the strongest bricks and tiles.
Stop!<eos> Don't touch him like that!<eos> That's my father!<eos> Forgive me, I was...<eos> He's turning 60 next week.<eos> He's afraid of looking his age, you see.<eos> That's why he dresses so well.<eos> Why he likes taking long walks.<eos> His hand feels cold.<eos> Why is it so cold?
You don't need one.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> There are parts of the house that are unsafe.<eos> It will take you a few days to familiarize yourself.<eos> Then, should you still feel you need them, I'll have copies made.<eos> Come on, Edith, come with me.<eos> Let's take you upstairs.<eos> I thought you said the dog was dead.<eos> I left it out there on its own.<eos> Thought it would perish in the cold.

You couldn't leave me.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> I know.<eos> There's a gentleman out there asking for directions to Allerdale Hall.<eos> At this hour?<eos> Surely not. Yeah.<eos> You can't get there on that horse.<eos> It's exhausted.
Is there really nothing you can do?<eos> Are you really writing a book?<eos> Well, I'm trying, yeah.<eos> My son thinks you're not who you say you are.<eos> Is that why you came?<eos> So tell me about your book.<eos> Ah, okay.<eos> Well...<eos> The story's changed quite a bit.<eos> It was meant to be a story about the end of things but now maybe it's about the beginning of them.

Good... because you're a terrible fiancé.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If there is ever a time in our life together when I find myself attracted to another man or even confused a little, I will always tell you.<eos> And that way, you know that I will never, ever act on it.<eos> I don't find Kush attractive.<eos> His ears are too close to his head.<eos> I hoped you would find his offer of a partnership more attractive.<eos> But that is up to you.<eos> Have you seen my other shoe, darling?<eos> If you don't tell me what's been the problem for the last few days, I'll need it to kick you with.
Vegetarian, non-vegetarian journey, yeah journey on which we send them with all our love and, and, and tremendous you know not obviously...<eos> This is what the the young...<eos> This is what the young make us remember...<eos> For this is what the young make us remember that in the end that in the end, it's all very simple that all it takes is to look into someone's eyes and say..."Yes...<eos> ... "this is what I want."<eos> And for them to reply "It's what I want, too "and there's nothing to be afraid of."<eos> Evelyn and I would like to wish the two of you all the love and luck in the world.<eos> And so say all of us.<eos> Sonny and Sunaina!<eos> If you really want to try monogamy, even though I think it's for the young and very naïve I suppose we could give it a go.
You pull that out on the yard, somebody come out attack you, they can do this to you.<eos> Now what do you do?<eos> You know what I mean? Huh! What the hell?<eos> Where'd that come from?<eos> I taught myself how to keister.<eos> How to... Keister?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Up the keister?<eos> Look.<eos> The electronic toothbrush part, it still works.
So, ask your parents for some.<eos> No, they'd be suspicious or something.<eos> What, that you'd sleep all the time?<eos> No.<eos> Probably assume I was gonna masturbate all over them.<eos> They just have some gross ideas about me.<eos> But that's on them.<eos> They're always getting sexy pillows.<eos> This is a nice pillow.<eos> This pillow is a dude, obviously but it reminds me of this pillow we used to have named Francesca.
Good riddance."<eos> She's gonna look great without hair.<eos> That's a fact, so...<eos> Yeah, I just wanted to say what's up.<eos> Rachel! We've got two cute little mouse boys on our doorstep that wanna say hi!<eos> Would you two... mice like a little bit of cheese?<eos> Okay.<eos> I like your room, Rachel.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Greg thinks it's too girly.
So they haven't really done anything.<eos> It's been about a month now.<eos> They did say they're never gonna stop hounding me so, sooner or later... you know gonna get hounded.<eos> Sorry, next time I'll bring you some flowers.<eos> Though I don't even know where I'd put them.<eos> It's like, like the only place left is the barf bucket.<eos> Flowers.<eos> Where you barf.<eos> I like that hat.<eos> It's pretty cute.
He knew every single European pop song from the 1970s.<eos> He'd memorize these songs, and he'd do that so he could go and sing them to German girls in bars.<eos> He had a go-to, his number one go-to song.<eos> It was a Dutch song. It was called Ding-a-Dong.<eos> My dad used to sing that to German girls in bars.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> Well, Greg, I think that it just means that even after somebody dies, you can you can still keep learning about them.<eos> You know, their life.<eos> It can keep unfolding itself to you just as long just as long as you pay attention to it.
With all the jewelry on her, she must have been a queen or something. She died with her hand pointing up!<eos> Master!<eos> What happened?<eos> They must have come here to kill her.<eos> Looks like she got the better of them.<eos> Master!<eos> Oh my God!<eos> A cave!<eos> We never knew this existed!<eos> Looks like it goes all the way to the top of the mountain!
Don't ever say you want to go up there!<eos> Let us go.<eos> How many times have I told you not to climb up there?<eos> Why do you keep doing it?<eos> You are my darling, right?<eos> You won't do it again, right?<eos> Looks like he will make it this time.<eos> No way!<eos> Look at the water mountain!<eos> It goes way up into the clouds And how many times has he fallen from that hundred feet?
You don't have any natural talent.<eos> All I know is that hot tub made me a king.<eos> It's my duty to live up to the throne.<eos> All right, I can't see you right now, but I'm gonna assume you're putting "king" and "throne" in quotes.<eos> Lisa Loeb?<eos> Oh, my God. I can't believe Nick Webber knows the name of the cat wrangler.<eos> Yeah. Crazy, right?<eos> You know, I just have to tell you, I really love this song so much.<eos> It feels so personal.<eos> It's almost...
It's normal for men to blow off some steam before their wedding, right?<eos> Adam?<eos> What'd he do, have a light lunch and a spa day?<eos> He did drugs and had sex with a man he barely knows on national TV.<eos> That doesn't sound like Adam.<eos> Honey, like you said, he's just blowing off steam.<eos> Why didn't I blow off steam?<eos> I have steam to blow off.<eos> All I did was get my hair done!<eos> - It looks beautiful.
Watch out!<eos> Hey, hey! Hey!<eos> (WHISTLES)<eos> NICK: And Reyes probably was killed.<eos> The email on his computer was bait.<eos> Whoever this is wanted to see if we were on Reyes' trail.<eos> We're burned.<eos> Could you track it to our guy's location?<eos> No, the video feed went through a proxy server in the Ukraine.<eos> Who knows where it bounces to off that?
He just looked me in the eye.<eos> What the fuck is going on?<eos> Shh, shh, shh.<eos> Are you high?<eos> We just had a bit of...<eos> Low-grade acid.<eos> Do you mean while I've been out there working my arse off trying to get this film ready, you've been in here dropping acid?<eos> Renatus is out of control.<eos> Today was fucking awful.<eos> Of course it was, man.
You want to take your finger off that trigger?<eos> Any guy who can shoot himself maybe requires gun safety.<eos> Don't move!<eos> I mean it!<eos> You're bleeding like it's an olympic sport!<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> He was moving towards his weapon.<eos> But why did you toss the gun?<eos> It was so far away from him, I thought that... that people would think I shot an unarmed man.
We'll talk next week.<eos> Wait, I got to see you every week?<eos> Yes.<eos> I have given you only a provisional reprieve.<eos> I'm a hindu.<eos> I believe after we die, we come back to life.<eos> So, why am I a doctor?<eos> Why am I working so hard at keeping people alive?<eos> Because I realize that reincarnation is a load of crap.<eos> We've only got one life, and it's meaningless.
If you don't know what you're selling, no one will know how to buy it.<eos> What are you selling?<eos> So many things. I don't tweet all of it.<eos> Like, here are two ideas that are not on the Internet.<eos> If I did a cabaret it would be called "High Standards" and I would sing all the standards.<eos> Would you sing them in a higher pitch?<eos> No, it wouldn't be about...<eos> It's about principles, those kind of high standards like one of those "String of Pearls "and that's why I'm a single gal" kind of show.<eos> Oh, that's clever.<eos> The second idea is a television show, which I've read is the new novel about a woman who's a government worker by day and a self-invented superhero by night but it's like the essence of America.
Because we owe her.<eos> Because you're into cool things.<eos> We are.<eos> You guys want to smoke some weed? Huh?<eos> I have some frozen weed.<eos> MC, where's that weed Jason gave us?<eos> You've just said "weed" like 15 times.<eos> Did that kid take my weed?<eos> No! No one's touched it.<eos> It should be next to the Chipwiches.
That we but teach bloody instructions which return to plague the inventor.<eos> This even-handed justice commends the ingredience of our poisoned chalice to our own lips.<eos> He's here in double trust.<eos> First, as I am his kinsman and his subject, strong both against the deed.<eos> Then, as his host, who should against his murderer shut the door, not bear the knife myself.<eos> Besides, this Duncan hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been so clear in his great office, that his virtues would plead like angels, trumpet-tongued against the deep damnation of his taking-off.<eos> I have no spur to prick the sides of my intent but only vaulting ambition which o'erleaps itself and falls on the other.<eos> We will proceed no further in this business.<eos> Was the hope drunk wherein you dressed yourself?<eos> Hath it slept since?

We have to keep moving.<eos> If we don't we could end up as little pieces of meat inside a dinosaur's stomach.<eos> Do you want that?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Just give me a second.<eos> - We don't have a second.<eos> Shh. Shh.<eos> Hear that?<eos> That's not a bad trip, okay?<eos> That is death and it's about to knock on our back door so please can we go now?
Thank you.<eos> Thank you for that, too.<eos> I assume you, uh, sent a note about the ransom.<eos> Didtheyreply?<eos> Well,theywill.<eos> In the meantime, this music, it's beautiful and laden with tragic disillusion but, uh, the same tape over and over again, all day long, please, I know I am your prisoner but there's no need to torture me, my friend.<eos> Some Johann Sebastian Bach would be quite soothing.<eos> Or, well-- Franz Fucking Schubert, anything.<eos> Silence, preferably.<eos> Also, some books would pass the time and as much as I adore ham sandwiches, my friend, Chinese food is quite easy to get, and it's cheap too, and, uh, I know, something like, um, yeah, Bang Bang chicken.
Willem,please, it's Pa's birthday.<eos> Come on.<eos> Cat?<eos> Howlongdo youreckonit'll take Heineken's people to pay the ransom?<eos> Cat. How long do you reckon it'll--?<eos> No more questions.<eos> Because I don't have the answers.<eos> Aw,thanks.<eos> Hey, and thanks for the new music.<eos> It's very whimsical, very droll.
I get two glasses of red wine in you and the Catholic girl comes out and...<eos> I'm just saying, if we're gonna be asking big questions, we have to be ready for the answers.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Look...<eos> I know this is... strange, you know?<eos> And what we're doing here could be... considered questionable.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're gonna help a lot of people with this work.<eos> It's gonna be worth it, OK?
You were the one who decided to do an unsanctioned experiment, in direct violation of the Review Board and the grant agreement which you signed.<eos> Which says, you were going to "study new methods of arresting neural decay in coma patients."<eos> Yes, exactly!<eos> That is how it started.<eos> But how do you think that penicillin was discovered? Or Teflon?<eos> Or even Coca-Cola, for that matter?<eos> Accidents that happen in the lab.<eos> Accidents that lead to new lines of inquiry.<eos> You are a doctor, you understand how science works.<eos> It's by adapting.
The Queen was unamused.<eos> Humiliated, she ordered the painting to be burned.<eos> But instead it was stolen and secreted away.<eos> Some say that Goya himself engineered the theft.<eos> For 200 years, the painting was sought by collectors, craved by the mighty, and became the stuff of legend.<eos> - And is the legend true?<eos> - Does it matter?<eos> The truth is nice, but a rumor is priceless.<eos> What does Strago want with it?<eos> If it does exist, it belongs to Spain.
But Spinoza's already there.<eos> He boffs Emil on the bean and takes the painting.<eos> Spinoza then secrets the painting into the Rolls and I unwittingly smuggle it to Krampf.<eos> The Duke told me that Bunny has the painting, but I can't find him.<eos> - Which Duke?<eos> - Of Asherboroughdon.<eos> Bronwen's lover.<eos> Bunny.<eos> "Love, your Bunny!" Oh! The note in the studio.<eos> It was not from a child, it was from him.
- Hello.<eos> And don't forget the chocolate mousse.<eos> Mum's obsessed.<eos> And you've done your speech?<eos> I've got a rough draft.<eos> You haven't.<eos> You've done a lot of doodles and crossing out.<eos> - I mean, as if.<eos> - Come on. You know Dad loves it when you do a speech.<eos> So it needs to be good and special.
I'm afraid of taking on the name and losing.<eos> They'll call me a fraud. Fake Creed.<eos> Why don't you think about what's true?<eos> You love to fight, right?<eos> Yeah, it makes you happy, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and you are Apollo Creed's son, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> So then use the name.<eos> It's yours.
I'm gonna take these last two.<eos> One more step.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Really good.<eos> You all right there, old man?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nice view.<eos> If you look hard enough, you can see your whole life from up here.<eos> How does it look?
What are you doing?<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, what the fuck are you doing?<eos> I ca- - I can't.<eos> I'm do- - I'm done.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't feel sexy.<eos> I feel fat.<eos> Did you hear what Billie said about my butt?<eos> She said it was gross.
I'm not missing the dance. -What about the range and the greens?<eos> We'll do it after the dance. -No way.<eos> We have to, or else we'll get fired.<eos> So... could you unload the bed?<eos> You wanna go for a booze run?<eos> Yeah. We must fertilize the greens.<eos> We'll do it afterwards. -I agree.<eos> Where is your car Finni?<eos> -Just at the next farm.<eos> What is it doing there?
So?<eos> Our brains, Antonia...<eos> Our brains are the biggest mystery on earth, trust me.<eos> And sometimes they play tricks on us.<eos> I'm doing it already!<eos> There we go.<eos> Looks great! But we still need napkins.<eos> What's this?<eos> What are you doing looking in my bag?<eos> It fell off.
So high.<eos> I think you got your new article right here. Here we go.<eos> All right.<eos> So, this is our Sports Medicine and Performance Center.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is where most of our athletes come and do the rehabflflafion.<eos> What does this do?<eos> Come on.<eos> So the HBM shows how your muscles are working and moving, so your rehab is most effective.<eos> It could help you with your gait, your posture.
No,no,no.<eos> These people...<eos> They're real conservative.<eos> Okay, so...<eos> It's like more gown... Oh, yeah.<eos> A gown?<eos> Do you want me to just go into my gown closet?<eos> No, no.<eos> Would you grab my tiara?<eos> It's right next to my pearls.
Fuck this.<eos> I'm not talking about this.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't say "fuck this."<eos> Don't follow me.<eos> Amy!<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I wanna go to sleep.<eos> You can go to your apartment.<eos> It's nicer than mine. No.
And you should try cooking with it... to enhance your specialities.<eos> Mr. Holmes?<eos> Mr. Holmes?<eos> Tamiki Umezaki.<eos> Welcome to Japan.<eos> I am so honoured you have accepted my invitation.<eos> We spend tonight at my house.<eos> Tomorrow we begin our search.<eos> I have owned your book for 20 years.<eos> I purchased my copy when it first appeared in print.
Perhaps it is life reasserting itself.<eos> Hire sansho.<eos> How does it taste?<eos> It isn't for the taste that we sought it.<eos> Ah, now, before we leave, there's something that I mustn't forget.<eos> I've signed it, as you requested.<eos> Not certain you can read my scrawl.<eos> "To Mr. Umezaki, who has not owned this book for long."<eos> You haven't had this book for 20 years.<eos> It came from the library.
Yes, and there's a secret compartment... containing the very glove you've been writing about.<eos> I know you say Dr. Watson didn't always get things right, but in the story...<eos> I am not working on that story anymore.<eos> Yes, but in Watson's story, he does have the armonica in it.<eos> And the German lady.<eos> And that glove.<eos> So maybe he did get things right.<eos> No, that's not possible.<eos> John had gone from Baker Street by then.<eos> Well, then why was it in there?
- Thanks.<eos> So, you wanna take a trip around the world?<eos> You can be my first mate.<eos> Like Gilligan?<eos> Like Gilligan.<eos> I'll put you to work in the galley.<eos> Get a little cat for the ship.<eos> It's like a little house.<eos> Are you really gonna get it?<eos> I kind of wish it was blue.

Ironic, considering all the times I've wished you dead.<eos> Kevin wanted to get out. No, he didn't.<eos> Kevin always preferred the easy way out.<eos> You know, take it instead of earn it.<eos> Those guys are gonna be back. They murdered Kevin and they will kill us too unless I kill 'em first.<eos> What's on the drive?<eos> No idea, but we're about to find out.<eos> Shit.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> They've tracked the drive, now they know where it is.
And there's a video.<eos> What?<eos> There's a video, and if it gets out, you know I'm going to lose my son, my husband, my job, my life.<eos> Everything that I've ever worked for.<eos> Okay, Claire, listen to me.<eos> Claire, that's not going to happen.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen, and neither are you.<eos> No one is going to see that video.<eos> It won't see the light of day.
You never get used to it.<eos> Spectral sightings, I like that.<eos> - That one's mine.<eos> - Is it?<eos> Stop.<eos> You boys fight too much.<eos> It's unnecessary.<eos> It's clear you both need each other.<eos> Maybe we should go into business together?<eos> I thought you said this business was too dangerous for you and you said it could kill you.
-I, uh, I can't talk about this...right now.<eos> I have to go.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -I'll call you later, okay? -Mm-hmm.<eos> -How long have you been with Kitty?<eos> -5 years.<eos> -When I saw you kissing, you looked really really happy.<eos> That grass is completely dead.<eos> -It's winter.<eos> -Yeah, I know, but... It's always dead. Even in the spring.
-Well, what's wrong with traditional?<eos> -You want to wear the tux?<eos> -My mother's not here either, Jenny.<eos> -I know.<eos> Your mother's in Portland.<eos> Mine is 20 minutes up the road in rush hour traffic.<eos> -Tell me something.<eos> -If it's about Mom, I don't want to hear it.<eos> It's not about Mom.<eos> I know you live in a condo, but if you had grass would it be dead or alive?
-The grass?<eos> -Yes.<eos> When I looked at the dead grass, I realized, I was unhappy.<eos> Happy people don't have dead grass.<eos> And -- and then it was like, the chicken and the egg.<eos> I couldn't figure out which came first.<eos> Happiness or green grass.<eos> So I started watering it.<eos> And the more I started watering it, the happier I felt.<eos> And then it came back to life.
Oh, my God, look, is this a... is this a bathroom?<eos> In an elevator?<eos> I don't think we're moving.<eos> Just press...<eos> The doors... the doors aren't opening.<eos> - No, press the buttons.<eos> - They're not...<eos> Just press the emergency thing.<eos> Hello? Hello?<eos> It should make a buzzing noise.
Silly of me!<eos> And are you still directing or composing, Maestro?<eos> No. I'm retired.<eos> Maestro, as I indicated you In my letter, I work For the Ceremonies and Events Office at Buckingham Palace.<eos> - You work for the Queen?<eos> - In a sense, yes.<eos> Good.<eos> I find monarchies so endearing.<eos> If I may, Maestro... Why exactly do you find the monarchy endearing?<eos> Well, because it's so vulnerable.
Actually, I've come up with some interesting details.<eos> Good<eos> Maybe the problem is that Julian and I never had children.<eos> I don't know what the problem is...<eos> But I'm not going to try and cheer you up by lying... Or talk about things I never knew about.<eos> You were right...<eos> Music is all I understand.<eos> Did you know why?<eos> Because you don't need words and experience to understand it.<eos> It just is.
The Dread Pirate Roberts to me seemed to be kind of the most interesting figure in that whole world.<eos> On the Silk Road forums, he was constantly posting these manifestos and love letters to his users and libertarian philosophical treaties.<eos> And he even had like this... Dread Pirate Roberts book club where he hosted discussions of Austrian economics and free market philosophy.<eos> At the same time, nobody knew who he was.<eos> He had never spoken to the press before.<eos> I approached him on the Silk Road forum mid-2012 and... started kind of just like trying to persuade him to talk, chipping away at him and just bugging him constantly.<eos> The actual trigger, I think that made him decide to talk was this competing dark website called "Atlantis."<eos> They were really much more aggressive in their marketing than the Silk Road.<eos> They put out this YouTube video advertising Atlantis as the new, better dark web drug site.<eos> So when I went back to the Dread Pirate Roberts and said, "You know, I'm going to do this story. It can either be about Atlantis or it can be about you,"
How's your mother, Holloway?<eos> Doesn't keep too well, I hear. Never has, since your father died.<eos> Understandable, really.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Harry was right about one thing. You're not good enough.<eos> ...primarily attacked military and political targets.<eos> Home Secretary, can we really hope to stop Qasim striking again?<eos> I say to Adem Qasim, we will not be cowed.<eos> We will not be bullied. We have faced down threats to our freedom and way of life time and again.<eos> Your ability to wound us may be significant, but it is finite.
Yeah, I'm kind of a Katy and Ke$ha girl.<eos> But it's not like I only ever listen to party music.<eos> - I like some classic stuff.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, my dad used to bring me records whenever he visited.<eos> - Springsteen, The Stones, The Hollies. - Mm-hmm.<eos> I used to be obsessed with that song, "the air that I breathe."<eos> Love that song.<eos> It's so good, right?
- Okay.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I've been finding so much gratification in my job lately, despite all of its craziness.<eos> I feel like, for the first time in my life, I'm... I'm building something that's mine, and I have you to thank for that.<eos> Now you know why my job is so important ever since I got sick.<eos> The thought of losing it is so scary.<eos> April Carver, you are not gonna lose your job.<eos> No offense to your boss, Beth, but I had no idea Jaclyn was successful enough to own her own boat.<eos> - Oh, this isn't Jaclyn's boat.<eos> - Then who's is it?
I saw you reading that magazine in there.<eos> Where I can get some firewood?<eos> Firewood?<eos> Jim!<eos> Listen think respond.<eos> The Hirtles sell it but if you don't pay them they'll set your boat on fire.<eos> Hirtles can be mean<eos> I'm starting to like this town.<eos> Your hat's too big for you now.<eos> It keeps my ears warm.
-Right.<eos> Right. We gotta be up at the crack at dawn to go to the airport tomorrow.<eos> Shit.<eos> Do we really?<eos> - That's what you signed on for, man.<eos> -All right. No problem.<eos> You're welcome to stick around and write an article about my dogs.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> That's just fine.<eos> It might be more interesting, I promise you.
-Absolutely.<eos> So good.<eos> - I think if the book is about anything...<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -...it's about the question of why.<eos> -Right.<eos> Why am I watching all this shit?<eos> - Right. Right, yeah.<eos> -it's not about the shit.<eos> - It's about me.
And, um...<eos> I gotta ask you about this rumor.<eos> - Is this the heroin thing?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> - Is this the heroin thing again?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> It isn't true.<eos> What is so hard for you to believe?<eos> The reason it is so hard to believe is because there is so much about drugs and addiction in the book.<eos> That doesn't mean that it's autobiographical.
And watch.<eos> Cat ninja!<eos> That wasn't necessary.<eos> You're going to recreate the Ultimate Serum here, for the Project.<eos> The Project?<eos> The emergency generators are now operational.<eos> Activating now.<eos> You see this rocket?<eos> It's covered with specimens of plants.<eos> It will explode in deep space, scattering billions of spores cultivated in this jungle.
Who warned him?<eos> Who's freezing cases against him?<eos> Who's filched the transcript?<eos> It's like he's bought the whole state.<eos> What do you think of the Attorney General?<eos> He owes his brother-in-law, head of the government.<eos> He won't bite the hand that feeds.<eos> I know.<eos> I agree. Your sincerity's touching, Baldi.<eos> It could come back to bite you.
- The whole thing pisses me off.<eos> - Why?<eos> Why can't you just leave your husband like any normal human being?<eos> - Because it would be such a waste.<eos> - A waste!<eos> You are such a hall monitor.<eos> It's not a waste.<eos> He's not a paper product.<eos> Love is messy.<eos> It's illogical, it's wasteful and it's messy.
You support that?<eos> No.<eos> But I don't see any harm in cheering people up.<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ There's nothing in the shops.<eos> The British loaf is rubbish.<eos> Rationing is as bad as ever.<eos> Sometimes it doesn't feel like we won the war.<eos> I'm surprised at you.<eos> If there was one thing that struck me about you when we first met, it was your honesty, even if it has got you into trouble sometimes.
How could I refuse just one question to so fair a lady?<eos> How much jacobite gold did dougal mackenzie pass along to you?<eos> Madam, it's a dangerous thing to hurl slanderous charges With such reckless abandon.<eos> They're only slanderous if untrue.<eos> You determined to make me your enemy?<eos> On the contrary, I need you as my friend.<eos> And I trust my friendship, No matter how lowly obtained,<eos> Is preferable to a date with the gallows as a traitor to your king.<eos> Has anyone ever told you, you have the most gorgeous neck?<eos> It holds your head so prettily.
But it's time we parted ways.<eos> Any-who, I'm going to turn you now.<eos> I hope that's cool.<eos> No, I don't want to be a vampire.<eos> No, no, no, Frank.<eos> They will, they will eat you alive.<eos> Literally.<eos> Literally, literally.<eos> Not the bullshit way most people use it.<eos> You never know if you're the kind of guy who'll jump on a grenade, till it lands at your feet.
Deacon I have no orders to eliminate you man but if you keep pushing... stop.<eos> Done my homework, George.<eos> You're a devout catholic.<eos> You're not going to kill anyone.<eos> Where is the kidney?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Put the gun down George and walk away.<eos> Now.<eos> Or I'll make your little girl an orphan without thinking twice.<eos> Tell me where it is.

I wore a tie and carried a blueprint, and I tried to look important.<eos> And this gave me access to everything under construction.<eos> Philippe, that looks really bad.<eos> Maybe you should go to the hospital and get it stitched.<eos> No, it will be fine.<eos> But look at the date!<eos> The coup is three weeks from today.<eos> Jean-Louis and Jeff arrive next week and I still have no access to the North Tower roof.<eos> Are you going to be able to walk on the wire with that foot?<eos> Yes, it will heal by then, but what am I going to do tomorrow?
What?<eos> Like, they weren't told to... I don't know... be my friend, were they?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> At my old school, everything was different and everyone was different towards me.<eos> It's like they didn't even see me.<eos> And then, I come here for a couple days, and everyone talks to me, everyone sees me.<eos> Isn't that a good thing?<eos> I guess.<eos> I-I just don't understand why things are so different here.<eos> This school... it isn't like your other school or any other school.
That is what I need to know from you.<eos> You said you saw something.<eos> I... I woke up after the accident, but...<eos> I don't remember much.<eos> I must have been drugged.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> "That's impossible.<eos> How could it be 4028?<eos> How could we have skipped so much time?"<eos> But what if I told you that this mouse can go into a state which allows it to survive all winter long without eating, without drinking, and that it actually lives longer as a result?
Pull "willie" over eyes.<eos> It's "wool".<eos> But...<eos> OK, I'm pathetic, but my parents are being evicted and if I have to clean shit to help them, I'll do it, here or anywhere.<eos> You start tomorrow.<eos> Fuck me!<eos> The best prepared generation in Spain and the Turk has them frying falafels.<eos> Hi, dad,<eos> I've started my new job.<eos> It has a lot of responsibility and requires great skills.
In 7th century China, the Tang Dynasty is in decline.<eos> The Imperial Court seeks to protect itself by establishing garrisons at the frontiers of its empire.<eos> Two centuries later, the militarized provinces waver in their loyalty to the Court.<eos> Some move to distance themselves from the Emperor's control. At that time, Weibo asserts itself as the strongest of those provinces.<eos> That man poisoned his own father, he killed his own brother.<eos> His guilt condemns him.<eos> Cut him down for me, expertly.<eos> As if he were a bird in flight.<eos> Don't pinch it!<eos> Where's it going?

As your humble servant, I bow to you, Your Reverence.<eos> Yinniang has completed her studies.<eos> Today she returns.<eos> I'll take my leave of you.<eos> The King of Kophen's bluebird failed to sing for three years.<eos> One day the Queen remarked:<eos> Birds sing only to their own kind, set the bird before a mirror!<eos> The King heeded her advice.<eos> The bluebird saw its own image, it sang of its sadness,<eos> it danced, until it expired.
We can totally go.<eos> He saw me.<eos> He saw me.<eos> He saw me.<eos> I think he's coming.<eos> Hi.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, I was looking for your earring.<eos> - Oh, it's...<eos> - Oh, there it is.
I kind of saw it.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah, a little bit.<eos> - I'm sorry, man.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm such a fuckin' idiot.<eos> I feel really embarrassed and I feel really...<eos> Wait, wait, wait, hold on a second.<eos> This song is called "Tom Sawyer."<eos> And it is about a magical, amazing, and inspired person who lifts the spirits of everyone around him by the very nature of who he is.
That was just me being really....<eos> Yeah. I agree with that.<eos> But I guess I was...<eos> I don't know, scared... because Chris and Isaac have been my family for the last 10 years... so I didn't wanna meet your family... because that would change everything.<eos> But everything changes, right?<eos> We all grow up... and that's a good thing, I wanna grow up.<eos> I wanna grow up with you.<eos> And I do wanna have a family... other than two dudes.<eos> But I want that family to....<eos> I want it to be you.
- Good.<eos> - Another one with "ah" in it.<eos> - Cat. Cat, good.<eos> C-A-T, cat.<eos> Another one with the "ah" sound?<eos> Sad.<eos> Sad, yes.<eos> Sad has the "ah" sound.<eos> You cannot see it, of course.<eos> It is not like the others. But it has the "ah" sound, yes.
We should get pissed.<eos> The three of us rat-arsed again.<eos> I have brought you something.<eos> Tell me what you want to know?<eos> Everything that might help me.<eos> There are not just the living and the dead, Mrs Johnson.<eos> There is the world of the unborn.<eos> Millions of souls waiting millions of years to pass on to the Kingdom of Heaven.<eos> To them - to the unborn - this life is nothing.<eos> It is a river they must cross to reach the other side, to reach the Kingdom of Heaven.
- This is a very special two pair.<eos> - I am sure.<eos> Two pair of fours.<eos> That's four in total.<eos> THEY SHRIEK WITH LAUGHTER - YOU BEAUTY!<eos> - YES!<eos> - Oh, you gorgeous man!<eos> Tommy! Oh, you little beaut.<eos> THEY LAUGH - Oh, yes. - Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous man.<eos> If you sit on your hand long enough, it will go numb and you can pretend someone else is giving you a wank.
~ What?<eos> ~ I would sooner you fuck him than talk to him.<eos> And I would sooner talk to him and make love to you, the man I love.<eos> What was the story he told?<eos> I told you, he tried to help a boy, but it all went wrong.<eos> Tell me the story!<eos> There was a fight in the playground.<eos> One boy was really hurting the other boy, so Major Ross got a teacher to stop the fight and it was the teacher who said to everyone that Major Ross grassed the two boys up.<eos> Why is that a good story?<eos> It says something about the Major.
Let's go to the shot of Mary.<eos> Woman: Cut away.<eos> - Queue it up. - Hold.<eos> And cut.<eos> - [Bell rings] - Man: That's a wrap, everybody.<eos> - [Sobbing] - That was amazing.<eos> Amazing job with Mary's words. You really did a great job.<eos> - Thanks. - Mm.<eos> Nice job on the note.<eos> I almost believed it was real.
One black americana, just how you like it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I was... I was late.<eos> I was early.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> I'm afraid this is more of a coffee favor than a catch-up.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> What's going on?<eos> An old intern of mine has gotten into a weird situation.<eos> It's actually kind of terrifying and he's refusing to go to the police.
Do you know how hard that is in this amount of time?<eos> ! I trust you, George.<eos> Don't let us down.<eos> And, George...<eos> You can use it now.<eos> Come to papa.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, see...<eos> Unlike the others, I can fix you.<eos> - What? - Your floor is your sister, it's like a scar that needs to be healed.
Sarah?<eos> Looks like no one's home.<eos> I'm headed to your room.<eos> Okay, I'm here.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm sending you the picture.<eos> I need you to scan all my photos of Sarah, see if any of the faces match this ad.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> This picture of your sister wasn't tampered with, or photoshopped.<eos> Lindy... it's real.
Oh, thanks, Romeo.<eos> It's the only good thing that's happened today.<eos> "The only good thing."<eos> That sounds like the chapter of a book.<eos> Did I tell you I'm writing a book?<eos> If I give you some cash, will you help me carry it up the stairs?<eos> I was working on it when I was in college, this book.<eos> And it got away from me.<eos> And now I've gotten back into it, and now it won't stop.<eos> What's it about?

It is sparkling wine!<eos> It is disgusting!<eos> If he wants to throw himself a mini-gala and glitter like he's one of us, he should Goddamn throw it and throw it right.<eos> I have to respect his budget.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Anyone with dough enough to sit on the board spends more blasting lines off a hooker's tits on a Saturday night.<eos> Where's that glass of water?<eos> !<eos> God, all this bowing and scraping.<eos> Well, he may think this little shindig is for him, but it's for us... us.
Another soft box, please.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Ready to be venerated, worshipped, and adored?<eos> God, you're like some kind of civet.<eos> I love it.<eos> I love this.<eos> Love.<eos> Show the camera your marrow.<eos> Strip yourself bare.<eos> Let it devour you.
- No, not good.<eos> Bad. I'm not afraid.<eos> That's what scares me.<eos> This is my career.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Right now, I'm asking.<eos> Jasper, please.<eos> For me.<eos> Beauty dies.<eos> It can't last.
What is it?<eos> A moment please?<eos> I'm going to make arrangements to leave for the country.<eos> Leave?<eos> Leave when?<eos> Now.<eos> - Tonight.<eos> - May I ask why?<eos> This fight with your father.<eos> The more public it gets, the more visible it gets, the greater the liability I will be for you.
You flew last time.<eos> Oh. How about we flip for it?<eos> No.<eos> It's my turn.<eos> I don't recall agreeing to taking turns.<eos> Oh, you don't agree to turns.<eos> Turns are what's fair.<eos> Fair?<eos> Whoever told you life was fair?<eos> Well, it seems pretty fair to you.
Not really.<eos> Still...<eos> I suppose a cuddle's out of the question.<eos> It doesn't even feel like it was me that was there.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> How long had you been up there?<eos> Oh, six or seven weeks, I suppose.<eos> It seemed a lot longer.<eos> We had a map, er, to start with.<eos> It was so bloody unreliable.
- Well, we recycle.<eos> - Do we?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, I try to, anyway.<eos> - Well, we should.<eos> You're welcome to clean out the dog cans and put them in the right bins.<eos> Because these glaciers, they're melting a lot more than people imagined,<eos> - and the water's just not coming down.<eos> - It's got to go somewhere.<eos> No, it's saturating into the rock beneath, and it's building up and up and up.
You used to say that everybody taking pictures all the time stopped anyone having any fun.<eos> - Did I?<eos> - You did.<eos> - Sounds like something I'd say.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> You had a camera, once.<eos> - Yeah, a Yashica.<eos> - Mm, a Yashica.<eos> Yeah, I've still got it.<eos> It's in the loft.
- Look at us there. Remember that?<eos> - Egypt.<eos> Yeah, when we went to Egypt.<eos> Gorgeous, we both are.<eos> Lena, this is wonderful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Not bad for an old fascist, huh?<eos> Yeah, not bad at all.<eos> - Oh, I can't wait to hear your speech.<eos> - Yeah, it's all in here.
Previously on "Wayward Pines"...<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> This school... it isn't like your other school.
All right.<eos> You mentioned the other day there was a package you needed picked up?<eos> I think it was in the back.<eos> yes.<eos> Thank you, I-I totally forgot.<eos> D-d-do you mind?<eos> - No. No.<eos> - All right, this way.<eos> Harold, Ted just came by to pick up that package.<eos> I think it's right back here.
That painting...<eos> Of Lynn?<eos> - Dom... - Oof.<eos> What the... that's...<eos> How do you...<eos> [Laughs] No words, really.<eos> You know what I mean? Just kinda...<eos> Let's... no, let's just be quiet and think about it.<eos> ♪ ♪ This music is so disorienting.<eos> Is it coming from behind us or in front of us?
So, just take it easy.<eos> Deep breaths.<eos> Why are you not inside yet?<eos> Are you sure you wanna go through with this?<eos> - Mum, please, don't start this again.<eos> - It's all right, Frank.<eos> I love him.<eos> "Love"...<eos> Do you even know what love is, Frances?<eos> I know it's not an answer to anything.
Please, could someone just take me home?<eos> Miss.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> I smelt something, I don't know what I smelt.<eos> There were some good funny looks in the room towards the judge.<eos> A bit stinky, he was.<eos> Right?<eos> Am I right or am I wrong?<eos> - No. No.<eos> Just goes to show, you can give a dog a bad name, but when that dog's name is Kray, it might bite you back. Well done.
This is a cinematograph machine.<eos> The very best.<eos> From London.<eos> You're a newspaper reporter, Ellis.<eos> Who needs moving images?<eos> Only the world, Charles.<eos> - Not for war correspondents.<eos> Especially for war correspondents, Charles.<eos> It's the future.<eos> People will see war as it really is.
Attack.<eos> And damned be him that first cries "Hold, enough."<eos> Sir.<eos> - Oh, yes, indeed.<eos> Come on, Braith.<eos> Carpe diem.<eos> In war, there are a lot of ways to die.<eos> And in the end maybe killing and dying is the same thing.<eos> My bullet didn't kill me.<eos> But it killed something inside.
A feint?<eos> !<eos> Nothing, Tony.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's it, then.<eos> We've done our bit.<eos> I feel we should be helping with the attack at the Nek now.<eos> Or with the New Zealanders up on the heights.<eos> Yes.<eos> That thing, uh, I'm not sure it's working.
No, no. No, I'll pour the coffee.<eos> You must be very busy in the kitchen.<eos> Miss.<eos> Excellent dinner, Mrs Rogers.<eos> The Owens are lucky to have you.<eos> I'll certainly be telling them so.<eos> Thank you, Madam.<eos> Whereabouts is your school?<eos> I doubt you'd have heard of it.<eos> It's not particularly well-known.
Let's leave them out for now, yes.<eos> What would it take?<eos> Farmers, men skilled in the cultivation of sugar and tobacco.<eos> Magistrates to maintain order.<eos> Carpenters to raise buildings.<eos> Clergy to raise spirits.<eos> Foodstuffs to sustain them all for six months, perhaps a year.<eos> Three ships to transport it all, sailors to sail them.<eos> And an honest governor, the first in recent memory, to oversee it all.<eos> In short, you'd be assembling a colony, boarding it onto ships, transporting it across the Atlantic, and hoping that when it arrives, it takes to an environment that has resisted every attempt at stable commerce for the past 50 years.
Though, perhaps, of the low-hanging variety.<eos> Thank you for your concern.<eos> Did you know?<eos> Before she opened the door?<eos> No, I didn't know.<eos> You must care for her a great deal.<eos> Not once all night did you so much as look in my direction.<eos> I've seen enough to know to keep my distance from you, thank you very much.<eos> The situation was not of my making.<eos> If it was anyone's, it was yours.
I love this album.<eos> You have good taste.<eos> This is like...<eos> An insane collection.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It must be worth a fortune.<eos> Well, everything's online now, so...<eos> But, uh, I love the sound of vinyl.<eos> You're really into music.<eos> Well, it used to be my job.
Jesus, Evan, we're not fucking whores!<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're the fucking whore!<eos> Whore!<eos> Evan?<eos> It's Vivian!<eos> Do not move!<eos> Evan!<eos> Evan, I'm so sorry I'm late, but that storm blew branches out all over town.<eos> It even knocked two traffic lights out.
I am Trevor Nelson, legal council to the Newport family.<eos> The Newport family trust intends to sell a 25-square mile parcel of pristine, undeveloped land containing Lake Eagleton and the Southern Indiana foothills.<eos> Why now?<eos> The Newports have owned this land for 100 years.<eos> Thanks to the recent economic boom in Pawnee, real estate prices are at an all time high.<eos> And in the words of Jessica Wicks-Newport, heir to the entire Newport fortune, quote, "It's time to trade those dumb, old trees for a butt load of cash."<eos> It is.<eos> It truly is.<eos> This land is begging to be a new national park.<eos> And it's in my own backyard.
It's called very good building and development company.<eos> I wanted to convey the quality of our work without seeming flashy.<eos> So your company is involved with one of the bidders?<eos> Hell yeah, pimp!<eos> He's on team Gryzzl now.<eos> We, uh, hired his company to help plan and build our new Gryzzl campus.<eos> Right here in town.<eos> Oh, and that land?<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> It's perfect.
– Has your family gone?<eos> – They should be on the ferry soon.<eos> What if the problem's not with the sensors but the cables leading there.<eos> Is that possible?<eos> All mountains are made of plates.<eos> Our mountain is no exception.<eos> Our drill holes go through all the plates.<eos> You said that the groundwater disappeared just before we lost contact.<eos> Groundwater can't vanish just like that.<eos> It finds new ways, it makes new layers.
Let me see.<eos> What?<eos> The Rhode Island of penises.<eos> It may have an illustrious history... but it sure isn't big.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we go inside.<eos> No.<eos> What?<eos> No, no.<eos> This fish is for Becca and it goes in her house.
I want to fight.<eos> I want to raid.<eos> Why do you want to fight?<eos> And what are you fighting for?<eos> That.<eos> What do you see?<eos> Power.<eos> The power of a king.<eos> Power is always dangerous.<eos> It attracts the worst.
- Dad.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It's not even 9 p.m. I don't think that even Oma is in bed.<eos> - Hey, Pete.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Why is there pot in your freezer?<eos> It was a...<eos> A coworker gave it to me for my migraines.<eos> Which I still get from time to time.<eos> And it's in the freezer because I read... that helps it maintain its potency.
So we are without a quartermaster.<eos> For the moment.<eos> We should take care to steer the men towards a replacement from Hornigold's men.<eos> Someone to fold the two crews together but not someone who's gone offer you any personal resistance.<eos> I was thinking Mr. Scott might be an ideal candidate.<eos> Billy, I don't mean to be blunt, but what the fuck are you doing?<eos> Why am I supporting your captaincy?<eos> Yes.<eos> When I went into the water that night after Andromache, I remember losing my footing on the bowsprit. I remember as I was falling, reaching out, grasping your hand.<eos> And the last thing I remember before I went into the water was feeling it slip away.
Skeet, I'm not leaving you!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I'm scared.<eos> - What're you scared of?<eos> - They are so loud.<eos> I don't want to have to move.<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Sometimes, when I feel threatened,<eos> I gather comfort food and store it in my cheek pouches.<eos> This way, no matter where I wake up, I don't have to go out and find food. It's already there. Already in my mouth.
I'm Emma Wilson.<eos> Hey, Emma Wilson.<eos> I'm here on a fellowship with the University of Pennsylvania.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Archeology.<eos> I'm working on a dig, right here in this neighborhood, actually.<eos> Here?<eos> In the tunnels beneath us.<eos> Really?<eos> See, I read this book when I was a kid by an archaeologist from Cambridge named Ian Margrove.<eos> It was all about the Temple treasures buried under Jerusalem.
- I've already talked to Detective Cohen and asked him to leave you out of it.<eos> - Report his findings directly to me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, for one, you two can't stand each other, but two... I'm just not sure you're in any condition to be able to handle it.<eos> I can do my job, Lynn.<eos> You don't have to worry about me.<eos> I do worry about you.<eos> Grief is complicated.<eos> It can come out in ways you don't intend.
His brain is still swollen, and depending on which areas are injured, we can be confused, hm?<eos> I'll stay with you, Mr. Brenner, nothing will happen to you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Better late than never.<eos> 30"'! -<eos> That's okay, no problem.<eos> I have something for you, you're gonna love it.<eos> I found a baroque frame after all.<eos> I must have got it from a church.<eos> I have no idea how it ended up here.

- I mean besides the film.<eos> Besides that, what's your dream?<eos> I have to think about it.<eos> When I decided to make a film about you, it seemed like a great idea.<eos> I can see my life now.<eos> All the colours are brown and gold and silver.<eos> What an incredible opportunity!<eos> To film them from the beginning, when everything's ahead of them, and everything's possible.<eos> How big is a thought?<eos> Is it bigger than the whole world?
You are hurting me.<eos> Sometimes, Pierre was looking at Manon like a disgusting, unknown animal.<eos> He could not help it.<eos> He could not stop terrorizing Manon, who felt guilty.<eos> First, she accepted to be tortured.<eos> She thought it was the only way.<eos> He thought only men could be unfaithful.<eos> That is was more serious, forbidden and dangerous for women.<eos> He could see his idea was too simple, untrue.<eos> It was a man's thought, but he could not forget it.
Breast-feeding isn't always easy.<eos> I've seen women in such pain with mastitis, or struggling to keep up a routine when they have other little ones.<eos> What about the risk of infection?<eos> That's why I was giving the class.<eos> Feeding a baby from an improperly sterilised bottle is very risky.<eos> No, I meant what about the antibodies that mothers pass on in their milk?<eos> Breast-fed babies have been found to have significantly fewer bacterial colonisations of the alimentary tract.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I read it in The Lancet.<eos> Your room has been aired but it was unoccupied for a while so it might smell a little damp.
Tell them we've had a child that... wasn't born living.<eos> I need a more senior midwife to attend and the doctor too.<eos> I have mislaid the rhythms of Morpheus.<eos> I am sentenced to pace the passages, my nights punctuated by a bell that does not call me.<eos> It's called me... and I wish to high heaven it hadn't.<eos> You are perturbed.<eos> You strive to hide it, but you do not succeed...<eos> This pain won't last, Abigail.<eos> ~ It won't last, I promise you.<eos> ~ It won't stop!
Race you back!<eos> As street leaders in the Civil Defence Corps, it is your responsibility to commit the layout of the district to memory.<eos> In the event of nuclear warfare, many of the local landmarks will be reduced to dust.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late, Mr Buckle.<eos> And on my first day, as well!<eos> I had to wait in for a delivery at my shop - name tapes.<eos> Oh, the grammar school mothers would have my guts for garters if they weren't in the shop tomorrow morning.<eos> Well, we can't have that, can we?<eos> Will we be walking far this evening?<eos> Well, you appear to be wearing stout footwear, I'm sure it will suffice.
- Do you?<eos> Yes - the cells in your brain have become sensitive to certain neurotransmitters.<eos> - I'm prescribing Haloperidol.<eos> - No, I'm good.<eos> We're good.<eos> John's in here and he's being looked after.<eos> I think we'll have to admit you.<eos> I don't want you spending all your money or thinking that you're Jesus.<eos> What happens to my soul if I go mad?<eos> Does it stay trapped inside or is it floating free?
Did he, now?<eos> - For your eyes.<eos> - My eyes are fine, Bob.<eos> - Something in your brain.<eos> - No, that's not right.<eos> I'm on medication.<eos> I am allowed to drive.<eos> I'm sorry, John.<eos> I helped pay for that car.<eos> I would like it to come back to Melbourne, please.
- And by "we", you mean me.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> - Sit.<eos> My unit was point for black ops in Afghanistan.<eos> Asset recovery, bag grabs, the dirty stuff.<eos> One night we came under fire.<eos> Not just a couple of insurgents with small arms, dozens of them all armed to the teeth.<eos> Someone had tipped them off.<eos> I called for air support, but it never came.
Enjoy it!<eos> We're cleaning up.<eos> See, this stuff's not worthless.<eos> Brooklyn loves you.<eos> Oh, my God, look at this.<eos> Ooh, this guy's really into you.<eos> I know.<eos> That's why I got to tell him the truth.<eos> It's only a number.<eos> But it's a big one.
Do you think Josh is dumb?<eos> I'm sure he's dumb.<eos> He's a guy.<eos> Josh dropped out of college.<eos> So did Mark Zuckerberg.<eos> Kelsey, he doesn't read.<eos> Well, if that's important to you, then that's important.<eos> I mean, we all have our deal breakers.<eos> I finished that book.<eos> It totally held up.
- Hey, I'm excited.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good.<eos> I'll warm them up for you.<eos> - Question is, how hot do you want them?<eos> - Red hot. Gonna do the snail joke, right?<eos> That's your trademark joke.<eos> Signature joke.<eos> Yeah, you don't have to do the snail joke.<eos> (CHUCKLES) It's so funny.
That's enough with the F words.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I apologize for her...<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't tell you.<eos> Well, great meeting, then, thanks.<eos> Ma'am, if we tell you, you'll know, and if you know, you'll be implicated.<eos> Well, then, uh, why don't you tell me and I'll decide whether or not I know it?<eos> Ma'am, a direct mail campaign went out last month with pictures of you -with babies and children. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was a huge success.
So why don't you tell Sacheen Littlefeather to get off the rag and get over it, all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - And I never said that.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> To reiterate, the painting was not removed.<eos> It was just taken out to be cleaned.<eos> It was painted four years ago.<eos> What made it so dirty?
- Florida.<eos> - Florida.<eos> So O'Brien and Montez are gonna get the storm photos?<eos> This was definitely a good idea when I pitched it.<eos> Well, I grounded flights and I diverted federal funds to the wrong state.<eos> I don't remember you pitching that as a possibility, Tom.<eos> Sometimes you have to gamble.<eos> Unfortunately, our horse did not win.<eos> No, it certainly didn't.<eos> It fell at the first fence and it got shot.
- I just had a bite.<eos> Ma'am, intruder in the grounds.<eos> - This is a lockdown! - Gary:<eos> God, another one?<eos> - You've got to be shitting me.<eos> - No, Gary, it's the same one.<eos> - He's doing a victory lap.<eos> - Seal the room!<eos> I shook Jack Nicholson's hand and I thought,<eos> "If this hand could talk, it would say 'wash me.'"
- Hi, Jonah Ryan.<eos> - Oh, Jonah.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Dan, why don't you get these guys some coffee?<eos> No, you don't need to get me a coffee.<eos> Although, coffee actually does sound delicious.<eos> Yeah, funny thing. I think the machine's on the fritz.<eos> Is it?<eos> We had coffee earlier.<eos> There's no way it could be on the fritz.
MIKE: Don't look desperate.<eos> Men don't like that.<eos> The first time I spoke here, they called it Chungmania. - I do remember that.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Chungmania.<eos> And I remember being so excited to have a mania named after me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I had Chungmania mania.<eos> (LAUGHING) I love it when you tell that story.<eos> It's so funny.
East Coast polls are closing, ma'am.<eos> - ( knocks )<eos> - Ma'am... history is calling. And it won't go to voice mail.
- Uh, Richard, what do the numbers say?<eos> - You haven't read the numbers.<eos> We've glanced at the numbers, sir, and at first glance they are very compelling.<eos> - You know where the door is.<eos> - Sir, if there's anything...<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> You work for President Meyer.<eos> You don't know where the door is.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> - It's over here.
- Right.<eos> - So, "One Up Him," is that a Reese Witherspoon movie?<eos> No.<eos> It's actually a... It's a matching game, where different kinds of gays battle each other.<eos> - Different types of gays.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Bears versus Twinks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, your game's about stereotypes.<eos> Well, no, it's more... it's more about subverting stereotypes.
-I don't want you to either, Richard.<eos> -Okay.<eos> So it's agreed.<eos> Welcome home, fellas.<eos> Should we smoke some pot to celebrate?<eos> Gavin, thank you for coming.<eos> I am certain that once you witness firsthand what Mr. Bighetti is up to, you will see that he is worthless around here.<eos> Worth is a relative thing.<eos> Yes, but worthlessness is not.<eos> It is absolute.
What's that?<eos> That is pornography, thousands of hours of it.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Russ, tomorrow, I would be happy to walk this through with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, no, I'm out of here.<eos> Just answer me this, are we good?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> The platform is running great.<eos> But it's just really fragile right now and we have a lot to focus on.
Hey! You bastards.<eos> What, you couldn't have done better, Torstein!<eos> I don't care about that game.<eos> I want you to cut off my arm.<eos> - Why not keep it?<eos> - Because it's killing me, stupid.<eos> It's no good to me anymore.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> In fact, I've always hated this arm.<eos> It has to go.
Hush, Ivar.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Queen Aslaug...<eos> Listen to me, Ivar.<eos> All the pain is going away, Ivar.<eos> All the pain is going away.<eos> I am taking your pain.<eos> Hush, good boy.<eos> There is no more pain.<eos> No more pain, it's all going away.
So have I.<eos> So have I.<eos> So have I!<eos> David Pilcher... he doesn't believe we can handle this.<eos> But we're stronger than he thinks.<eos> Even with all these lies, with this violence, we have made lives here.<eos> How dare you say his name, Kate?<eos> How dare you?<eos> And this truth...<eos> it will only make us stronger.
Exactly!<eos> You convinced Elias that you and he could play a trick on the others that night, didn't you?<eos> And in the process, you thought you were carrying out the perfect murder!<eos> After all, who'd suspect that the killer's accomplice was the victim himself?<eos> So it was Elias who made sure he had a brief chat with Zeta when she arrived, which gave you just long enough to get around and into the room - making sure you locked the window from the inside.<eos> And even though the opened curtain would barely hide you, only Elias himself would have seen you in those first few seconds and he wasn't telling.<eos> So, when Elias blew the candle out, he expected Andre to slip out in the darkness and just ring the bell, to make it look like Mama Beth was telling the room she was happy to move on to the other side.<eos> But you had a different plan altogether, didn't you?<eos> Because the only person who'd be moving to the other side that night would be Elias!<eos> And who would actually notice, once Elias was dead, if Andre entered through the door - or just seemed to appear as it opened?
We have $26 million invested in that asset.<eos> We can't just kill it.<eos> Those men are gonna die.<eos> 300 meters to the beacon.<eos> You need to call this mission off right now.<eos> They're right on top of it.<eos> Call it off right now.<eos> You are not in control here!<eos> Blood's not clotted yet.<eos> It's close.
- No.<eos> But there's a rare collection of books there.<eos> It fits.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> We need you to pick a lock at the library.<eos> Easy, but we have to go to the hospital first.<eos> No, there's no time.<eos> If the book is in the collection, we need to get it now.<eos> We couldn't find a pattern of people getting sick, but that's because the book wasn't strong enough yet.<eos> Maybe we can find it and stop it before it gets strong enough to kill someone.
Oh, this happens when she's listening to the stories.<eos> It's reading day.<eos> You think you're helping her by reading her what she likes, but you're draining the life out of her.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> I know exactly what I'm doing.<eos> All right.<eos> Time to stop the crazy.<eos> Ooh! Ooh. Ooh.<eos> You know, when I started reading this book to the kids, I found out that it drains the listener but it gives the storyteller some of its strength.
The kid you found?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tried to tell you I stumbled on her by sheer...<eos> Sheer luck.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Jones, you're the only one the story works for, not against.<eos> What?<eos> You have to get him to stop.<eos> The story he's telling will kill us.<eos> It'll kill the town!
That way.<eos> How strong?<eos> Stronger-ish.<eos> Okay.<eos> Energy differential is positive, it's growing, tulips, and roses, pansies.<eos> But it's not random.<eos> There's a design to it, it's all channels and flows.<eos> It's a circuit.<eos> The energy is flowing through gas lamps across the town.<eos> Where is it coming from and why?
Thank you.<eos> You could have waited to give it to me.<eos> You didn't have to come in the rain.<eos> I couldn't wait.<eos> I was excited over it.<eos> Will you have one with me?<eos> I thought you'd never ask.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> I'm trying to finish this book I started a long time ago.<eos> - What's it about?
How long for?<eos> Broadstairs, possibly.<eos> Why Broadstairs?<eos> Have you family there?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Have you got any family?<eos> I just need the air.<eos> I saw a snake this morning.<eos> It was coming up Parkway.
Listen to me, Miss Shepherd, there are no boa constrictors in Camden Town.<eos> What, are you calling me a liar?<eos> I know a boa constrictor when I see one.<eos> You all right, my love?<eos> Looking especially lovely today, sweetheart.<eos> Don't "sweetheart" me.<eos> I'm a sick woman! Dying, possibly.<eos> Well, chin up, love, we all gotta go sometime.<eos> Smells like you already have.<eos> I do not believe in the snake, still less that it was en route for the van.
- What about?<eos> - What do you think? Oh.<eos> And when I came down again, she's still sat there, hat and coat on.<eos> She said, "Graham, my one aim in life is for you to be happy."<eos> And execute 45.<eos> "If I thought that by dying it would make you happy, I would."<eos> Go.<eos> I said, "Mam",<eos> "your dying wouldn't make me happy. In fact, the reverse."<eos> "It would make me unhappy.
C-Can I see it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh... if I can remember where I put it.<eos> Come on.<eos> You still need that thing?<eos> What, the cane?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't want me to fall down and break my neck, right? Uh-huh.<eos> So how did your first day back at class go?<eos> Oh. Here it is.
Okay.<eos> So, there's no monster in the house, the house is the monster, and we have until midnight to find its dark heart and destroy it before it goes off in search of more victims.<eos> Why is it always midnight?<eos> Who makes these rules?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Have either of you seen anything out of the ordinary?<eos> I saw a metal crate hammer from, like, the 1800s, caked in blood.<eos> Or how about the pram from "Rosemary's baby"?<eos> No, seriously.<eos> It's up there.
Nice place you've got here.<eos> It isn't Harvard, but thank you.<eos> Harvard would never have given you an office half as grand as this, or found you as bewitching a secretary.<eos> Oh. Well, I just go where the work is.<eos> So, aren't you going to take my picture, then?<eos> I'm considering it.<eos> Do you ever feel invincible one moment and then worthless the next?<eos> Yes and no.<eos> The camera begins to attract its own subject matter.<eos> It's no longer a passive recorder, but actively attracts the people it records.
- Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> Look, I saw something I thought you should know about.<eos> Oh, saw with your eyes or saw with your gift?<eos> I think those guys want your Bad Romance.<eos> Unless singing Gaga around the station is a cop thing.<eos> Only after one of their peers proudly reports Stefani Germanotta as the name of the murder victim.<eos> That name you gave me is Lady Gaga's real name.<eos> So you know...<eos> The Jane Doe must've given that name to the police when she was arrested in Vancouver.<eos> It's still the girl.
Something's come up.<eos> There's this thing I need to do.<eos> Wait, that's it?<eos> Thought I had a psychic sidekick.<eos> I was working on the bit...<eos> Cagney and Pasty.<eos> Major wanted to know if there was a chance for us.<eos> I thought shutting him down was noble.<eos> But what if there is hope?<eos> Even if it's dim and somewhere in the nebulous future,

Amy is the best thing that ever happened to this island.<eos> She's, uh... she's a special girl.<eos> And lucky to have somebody like you looking after her.<eos> Now if you don't mind, I need to get back to my work.<eos> Agnes!<eos> Agnes, where have you been?<eos> We need your help.<eos> - I've been taking care of my patient.<eos> - We have a problem.<eos> The sickness, it's... in the bees.

It's not safe.<eos> Please, don't leave us!<eos> OK, stay close to me, and if you hear anything scary at all, you run as fast as you can, OK?<eos> OK, come on.<eos> How long does the psychosis last?<eos> Who knows?<eos> They're all - dead within two days anyway.<eos> - Not a very efficient pathogen.<eos> Seems to be doing a pretty fair job kicking our ass.<eos> An infectious disease doesn't want to kill, it wants to pass on its DNA.
- This.<eos> Why don't we just take the root from Amy?<eos> She has it hidden.<eos> We have to go through with the procedure.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm going to help you.<eos> But this better save my child.<eos> Why do you need to take my blood?<eos> Because blood is everything.<eos> It can tell us all about you, what makes you the same as others, what makes you different.
Enjoy! Ooh!<eos> Don't forget La Quica!<eos> Take care of him, too.<eos> Sit down, my love.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good. And you?<eos> I like your hat.<eos> It looks good on you.<eos> - Do you think so?<eos> - Yes, it looks good.
I didn't think it would end this way.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Boss?<eos> Someone came all the way out here to see you.<eos> Miss Valeria.<eos> Good day, ma'am.<eos> Pablo.<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> I'm here only because I have important information.<eos> I hope it's very important.

Continue.<eos> Continue, Paisa.<eos> Thank you, Sergeant.<eos> - Good day.<eos> - Good day.<eos> - Good day, Paisa.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> Good day, Sergeant.<eos> Escobar's prison was called La Catedral, but we nicknamed it "Club Medellín."<eos> It was the embodiment of "the big lie."
- Yeah, like she's just gonna hand it over.<eos> - Maybe not voluntarily.<eos> Jake, where are you going?<eos> Should we follow him?<eos> What if he takes on Alice alone?<eos> No, we need to get Oscar home.<eos> What was it like where you were?<eos> It was lonely.<eos> Nothing there made sense.<eos> But the magic was strong, so it made me strong.
That is what I am this close to finding out.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Sam!<eos> I mean, Roland.<eos> Let's go now, before Roberts comes back.<eos> This is...<eos> Weird...?<eos> This is freakier than when I saw the alternate universe me.<eos> Why are you wearing that stupid hat?<eos> 'Cause it looks good.
(Abbi) Okay, we're your new R.A.s, so I'd cut it with the douche-fest, asap.<eos> This is a spontaneous room raid.<eos> Whoo! Guys, we don't want any trouble.<eos> I'm hoping, boys, that we don't find any contraband in here, 'cause that would not be good for you.<eos> Uh-oh. Mini-fridge.<eos> (Gasping) Hey, now!<eos> What do we got here?<eos> Mad vodka, huh?<eos> Good stuff, huh?<eos> And it's also against the rules.
It's okay, don't worry, let's go home.<eos> I used to be a romantic hero, Tomás.<eos> A romantic hero.<eos> It's delicious, Tomás.<eos> When are you going to learn?<eos> What for?<eos> I invite you to dinner and you never come.<eos> I never come because you end up ordering pizza.<eos> What's wrong with pizza?<eos> It's not any pizza, it's a special one.
He needs the book to stop aging and regain his powers, for he will be back, and he wants the book.<eos> He needs the book.<eos> Maybe I should just give it to him.<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> The book must never get into the hands of the evil one.<eos> And if it does?<eos> The world will be in danger.<eos> Magic is like fire.<eos> In the right hands, it can do nothing but good.
I'm going to tell you what I told Jason Beiver when I saw him perform when he was just seven years old.<eos> - Oh, my. - I said,<eos> "Jason, you are like a bird soaring through the air."<eos> You're the bird.<eos> Soaring high.<eos> And that bird...<eos> Has been shot.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Do you see?<eos> And it falls, and ifs just...
Yeah?<eos> But...<eos> - What's with the tux? - How?<eos> You...<eos> Are you okay, Bobby?<eos> Dad.<eos> Ah, hey, I love you, too, sport.<eos> I can't believe it. I can't believe it.<eos> But how?<eos> You told me that magic couldn't save Dad or the house, but it did.
I'm sorry if you don't think I don't deserve to be with somebody like him, but that's not for you to say.<eos> I'm gonna leave now.<eos> Because if I have a drink, I'm just gonna get mean.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Didn't think you'd still be here, since it's after lunch.<eos> Probably have a gal pal to meet for happy hour.<eos> Okay, I know that you don't think I should have left when I did last night, but I don't want you to think that I'm slacking or anything.<eos> This job is a huge priority for me.<eos> But is it your first priority?
Sutter was in Afghanistan.<eos> Terrible things happen there.<eos> Terrible things happen here.<eos> We found human blood all over frank Sutter's t-shirt.<eos> Couldn't just keep him there, Dan.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> there in the day, come to me straight into my arms<eos> I tried to caress it ooh, ooh but it ran through my fingers ah, ah-ah
- Yeah.<eos> I will.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rain's over.<eos> Don't be so sure.<eos> The sky is still overcast. I bet it'll rain again.<eos> Wait.<eos> Pizza is ready.<eos> Come on. It's just pizza.<eos> It's not gonna bite you.
Do you really want this to be your last battle?<eos> It is the only battle.<eos> My totems.<eos> For protection.<eos> - Do they work?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But I can't remember which ones.<eos> Pretty, isn't it?<eos> We must prepare for battle.<eos> When it comes, it comes fully and to the end.
Such hair she has.<eos> You're forever trying something else, that's the problem.<eos> The public's imagination soon tires of the familiar.<eos> Repetition is the bane of sensationalism.<eos> Well, we'll soon see, won't we?<eos> Mr. Clare.<eos> There's something wrong about Mr. Clare.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I touched his hand today.<eos> It was cold.
So, Doctor, will you give me the first dance?<eos> Perhaps the second.<eos> Come in.<eos> Ah, Vanessa.<eos> What do you think of my beard?<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - My beard.<eos> I've had it for as long as I can remember, but I don't know that it entirely suits me.<eos> Why not?<eos> It makes me look older.
I promise you.<eos> Of course we'll go.<eos> It's a ball.<eos> What's the worst that could happen?<eos> Who's giving the ball?<eos> A fellow I met today... name of Dorian Gray.<eos> - What are you making?<eos> - Shepherd's pie.<eos> Now go upstairs.<eos> I'll call you when it's ready.
Doesn't that demonstrate his allegiance to his family?<eos> Because it was too painful, maybe.<eos> You know better.<eos> He's in love.<eos> The memories of his past, including me are clouds he doesn't want to face.<eos> And why should I demand him to?<eos> Just so I can retain my unique bond with him?<eos> It's selfish.<eos> My God, let him be happy.<eos> Wood betony attracts bees for honey crushed and put into your pillow, it prevents nightmares.
You don't fear it?<eos> Not now.<eos> This must have been how the world was created.<eos> Or how it ends.<eos> Water!<eos> No!<eos> We are dangerous.<eos> What is love but a kind of creature waiting to be unbouns?<eos> A malady.<eos> What does it bring any of us but confusion and bedevilment?

And you are my true friend.<eos> Please.<eos> No one will know.<eos> I promise.<eos> Uh, this way then.<eos> But let's be quick.<eos> Tell me what you see.<eos> A cell... with a heavy iron door.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Is it for animals?
- You know it.<eos> Let me show you what I can give you.<eos> No.<eos> To be free of pain.<eos> To be loved, simply for who you are.<eos> Is that not the engine of all human creatures?<eos> To be normal.<eos> Mother, I don't understand why Charles is so awful to me.<eos> We were drawing pictures and I made fun of her silly horse.<eos> - It wasn't silly.

I-I-I...<eos> I don't even know who this is.<eos> I already told them everything...<eos> Stanley.<eos> Elsa...<eos> Come on...<eos> Talk to them.<eos> What about... what about uh, your... the dream?<eos> Hollywood!<eos> I'm afraid... that's all it is.
Maybe tomorrow.<eos> There she is.<eos> Don't run.<eos> I'm in Grand Central.<eos> Come down.<eos> Only to throw you under a train.<eos> Come on.<eos> I only have one question.<eos> I better have gotten that lousy job.<eos> You did, and it's not lousy.
Do you really think you're moving here?<eos> One double XL, one kid's XL.<eos> - Hey, you remembered my size.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Hey, Lucy, can I ask you something?<eos> Of course. What's up?<eos> I was wondering, would you want to maybe... come work for me in Pawnee?<eos> I have the company, and it's growing so fast.
Who could have predicted that the country would run out of beef?<eos> You just got to move on.<eos> That's the problem, though.<eos> I've gone bust in the past, but it was because I did something reckless.<eos> This time I was smart and careful, and I still went broke.<eos> What do I do now?<eos> Well, you and I are gonna be fine, and you'll come up with a new idea.<eos> You always do.<eos> I once started an entertainment company.<eos> It failed in four months.
I'm everywhere.<eos> You want to be governor of Indiana?<eos> What?<eos> Colquitt's not gonna run again.<eos> It's a rumor for now, but my gut says it's for real.<eos> You're the perfect candidate.<eos> Local hero, state government experience, blah-blah-blah- blah-blah-blah-blah.<eos> I mean, the only potential problem is that devastatingly nerdy "Cones of Dunshire" thing.<eos> Uh, that's a problem?<eos> I'm sorry, but it's the ninth-highest selling multiplayer figurine-based strategy fantasy sequel game in history.
Cheese, cheese.<eos> Who's that, your wingman?<eos> I can't shift him.<eos> I don't know what he wants.<eos> He wants ME!<eos> You need to keep off the cheese, Howard.<eos> It is incredibly moreish.<eos> Do you know what the real casual vacancy is?<eos> It's the grave.<eos> It yawns open briefly and then it's filled by us.
We claim William Henry Harrison as a hero because he was the first governor of the Indiana territories, and then President of the United States.<eos> We're also a little ashamed of him because he didn't wear a coat at his inauguration, caught a bad cold and died 32 days later.<eos> He's an embarrassing footnote.<eos> But he's our embarrassing footnote.<eos> I've recently self-Published a biography about Harrison entitled, Barely A President.<eos> William Henry Harrison's 32 Days In The White House."<eos> I discovered that Harrison had a heretofore unknown hunting lodge on the very land you're trying to acquire.<eos> Um, spoilers much?<eos> Now I'll never read that book.<eos> If a U.S. President had a house on that land, it could qualify for historic landmark status, and we could really stick it to Ron's team.

Friend, coworker, musician, husband, Andy Dwyer--<eos> Sir Andy Dwyer.<eos> Sir Andy Dwyer had become so many things to so many people.<eos> But his greatest creation was yet to come.<eos> A salute to Johnny Karate when we come back.<eos> We know what you want-- healthy, natural food that still tastes great.<eos> And we're here to tell you...<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Healthy food is for suckers.<eos> It tastes like garbage, and if you say you like it, you're a chump and a liar.
Uh, yeah you do.<eos> I've seen profit reports.<eos> The show's a bonanza.<eos> Andy starts making 500 a week.<eos> Now.<eos> Get the hell out of my office, both of you--<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - I don't...<eos> Look, dude, this internship leads nowhere.<eos> It'll just screw up the rest of your life.
Ok.<eos> Well, here's something I know that even Freud didn't...<eos> Oh, do tell.<eos> What it's like when someone takes away your deepest, ugliest pain without your consent.<eos> It is both a blessed relief and a complete violation.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> Let's start with what you've referred to as the red door.<eos> That's an image from my past, my youth.<eos> It was the door to a slaughterhouse.<eos> Sometimes it appears to me in flashes.
- Can they hear us in here?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Oh, my God, what is that?<eos> Some hideous tapestry that never would've been here had I lived here because...<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What?<eos> Okay, you definitely need to call your super.<eos> This is something Adam and I always talked about, you know?<eos> Making a master suite with our bare hands.<eos> And now it's here and I have nothing to do with it.
I'm not standing in that parade of tits and ass.<eos> You secretly love this.<eos> Some things are better left mysteries.<eos> Do you wanna borrow my paper bottoms?<eos> Because I could rip them off and just give them to you.<eos> Come on.<eos> Give mama a smile!<eos> Do you remember what Kubra used to say?<eos> "A smile is like tight underwear.<eos> - It lifts your cheeks." - "It lifts your cheeks."
Don't you look at me.<eos> And go ahead... give me a shot for being insubordinate.<eos> I don't give a fuck.<eos> Am I at least allowed to ask what a vole is?<eos> Right this way.<eos> Chapman, how are we doing today?<eos> We are doing so great, Mr. Caputo.<eos> Would you mind explaining what it is you're doing today, for our guests?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> The microwave... it stopped working yesterday, so I'm trying to fix it.
Like, didn't your heart stop?<eos> Man, it's... not a rational thing, you know?<eos> But I want it out of here. I really do.<eos> I can't trust you.<eos> And you're gonna fuck it up for both of us.<eos> I'm not gonna fuck this up, okay?<eos> I've made up my mind.<eos> I-I don't want to die again, all right?<eos> There isn't... there's no... white light for me.<eos> If we don't get this stuff out of here, it's gonna find its way back to me or me to it, you know?
"Covet." It's "covet."<eos> You can do what you want with it. I'm gonna snort it.<eos> I'm serious, you guys.<eos> We need to set the rules.<eos> For me, it's less about, like, rules, and more what happens when I look at Norma.<eos> Oh, yeah, what's that about?<eos> I mean, it's, um... it's, like, less than magic, but more than a hug.<eos> The way I see it... it's the armor you put on every day.<eos> The armor that... that it takes to get through every day.<eos> It gets heavier and heavier as you live your life, you know?
Probably not the best choice of words.<eos> There's a program for kosher meals that we feel is being abused.<eos> I have a plan to address it.<eos> Also, I've located a new source for soap.<eos> Is it the Jews?<eos> Does anyone else have something?<eos> Keep them coming, people.<eos> There are no bad ideas.<eos> Well, I wouldn't say that.<eos> I-I had an idea. And it's not a cost-saving initiative.
- I'm Space Admiral Rodcocker.<eos> It was originally Donaldschlong.<eos> I think I might've made a mistake by changing it.<eos> I see why you were disturbed.<eos> Yeah, and I don't know how she knew about my birthmark.<eos> This is some sick stuff, Warren.<eos> A writer does not search out a muse.<eos> A muse appears.<eos> And when that muse wears uniform pants that fit in all the right places,<eos> - it writes its...
He's just a beautiful man.<eos> It's empirical.<eos> Holy...<eos> - O'Neill, get over here.<eos> - I'm indisposed.<eos> There's a fucking... chicken over here.<eos> The chicken is a myth.<eos> Nice try, sir.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> It's real!
Holy...<eos> - O'Neill, get over here.<eos> - I'm indisposed.<eos> There's a fucking... chicken over here.<eos> The chicken is a myth.<eos> Nice try, sir.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> It's real!<eos> It's got a beak and feathers!<eos> It's pecking, it's pecking in the grass, it...
She called it the Devil's mark, so...<eos> I'm not a witch.<eos> But after you hear the truth, then maybe you'll think otherwise.<eos> I've never had smallpox.<eos> I can walk through a room of dying men and never catch it.<eos> I can nurse the sick, but the sickness cannot touch me.<eos> This mark is...<eos> is called a vaccine, and you've never heard of it.<eos> No one here has.<eos> But it prevents me from contracting the disease.
So, you only found out about the affair last night?<eos> That's correct. How long did it go on?<eos> Just the summer.<eos> I mean, I worried that something was going on, of course. I mean, he was her teacher.<eos> She was beautiful.<eos> But I didn't know anything for sure.<eos> And then when I told him what I'd done that I was gonna tell the truth about him one way or the other...<eos> That's how foul you are, you disgusting slut.<eos> And that's when I knew he was sleeping with her, that he'd... he'd probably hurt her, too.<eos> So, you're saying that you didn't recognize this photo when it became public.
Pull the fire alarm.<eos> Evacuate everyone.<eos> No.<eos> Those 27 kids...<eos> They're linked by magic.<eos> The rule of three can find them anywhere.<eos> So we got to protect them from here.<eos> A Faraday cage.<eos> It's, like, a container that energy can't get into or out of.<eos> Right. It protects everything inside from an electrical charge.
Mm, thank you, baby.<eos> Hi!<eos> - Oh! - Wow, she is amazing.<eos> Neets loves her charity work.<eos> - Thanks for coming.<eos> - Oh, my God, of course.<eos> - We're so excited to see your new piece.<eos> - A bit nervous about it, actually.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, it's kind of a downer.
Your brother and I have been working hard to turn Empire into a publicly traded company.<eos> Now, part of us going public means ensuring a legacy for this company, and right now it seems none of you are prepared to take over after I'm gone.<eos> Now, it won't happen today, nor tomorrow... but I will start grooming someone soon.<eos> And it can only be oneofyou.<eos> What is this, we... we King Lear now?<eos> LUCIOUS: Call it what you want, smart-ass, but over the next several months...<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> We're all in competition to be the future head of the company?<eos> In order for it to survive, I need one of you Negroes to man up and lead it.
- Yes, it was very good.<eos> Even though I don't much like Indian food, but it was good.<eos> I'm more than willing to help with the wedding if...<eos> Oh, no, no. That won't be necessary.<eos> We're bringing in finest chefs from Europe and Asia.<eos> We are good.<eos> They say the only thing people remember about a wedding is the food.<eos> - Yes. - Well, if it's going to be as good as yours was tonight, then the wedding is definitely going to be unforgettable.<eos> What is unforgettable was your song.<eos> Yes, it was the highlight of the evening.
- Hi.<eos> She caught me trying to slip a note into her dryer mid-spin and she ran over. She was like, "What are you doing?"<eos> But it turns out she had written me a poem.<eos> Yeah, I always wanted to give a stranger a poem. -<eos> I was in that bathroom for less than two minutes.<eos> It's actually a pretty great poem.<eos> You want to hear it?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - I just gotta read the first line.<eos> It's so beautiful and touching.
He's acting like...<eos> Like he moved down here and you dumped him to get back with T.C.?<eos> - Mm?<eos> - Okay, I am not back together with T.C.<eos> and it is way more complicated than that.<eos> Complicated, T.C. No way.<eos> Well, it's better that he's complicated than...<eos> What, boring?<eos> Our safest option without a scan is to cut the rebar as close to you as possible, and that will keep the weight of the bar from shifting toward your side.<eos> So does that mean it shifts to her side?
What's wrong with a... Like a normal filter?<eos> They only last about 36 hours.<eos> After that, you're basically drinking liquid cancer.<eos> But with my system, we're essentially taking spoiled lemons and making sweet, sweet lemonade.<eos> Like that water that you're drinking right there, that was initially sewage.<eos> Pretty amazing, right?<eos> Yeah. So you see how far...<eos> No.<eos> No. Alex...<eos> Alex. Alex, it's beyond clean.
Like, I asked my parents about it and they were like,<eos> "Well, you'll hit puberty and it'll grow."<eos> You know? But it just... It didn't.<eos> It never did. It never grew.<eos> So I still have this, like, dick from middle school on my body.<eos> I'm so goddamn proud of you right now.<eos> You have a spark in you.<eos> I saw it the first time I laid eyes on you, you've got a...<eos> It's like you have a blinding aura of goodness and love surrounding you at all times.<eos> - It fucking follows you around.
I don't want to dissuade the other hunters.<eos> Mistakes will be made.<eos> - Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Thank you, Your Grace.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Take the head.<eos> Let me, Your Grace.<eos> I would take it if you don't mind.<eos> It could prove useful for my work.
Let's get Howard and Linda.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Linda.<eos> Can we talk with you and Howard for a minute?<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I just wanna get these rewrapped for the kids.<eos> It's important.<eos> The snowplow?<eos> The keys were in the ignition and it was beat to hell.<eos> But if it runs, I drive it back here, then everyone piles in the car and follows, while I clear a path in front of us.
Damn, Will!<eos> When Nita was very young, I took her to her first July 4th picnic, and she got scared by the fireworks.<eos> Still hate 'em.<eos> Why celebrate with symbols of war?<eos> - Wars are always a failure.<eos> - Yes, honey.<eos> But she got frightened, and before I knew it, she was gone.<eos> Lost.<eos> A million people around me.<eos> I felt this panic starting to rise up, but before it hit, I suddenly could hear her.
An because when I'm worrie, I o stupi things.<eos> An when I o stupi things, I win up unerneath a rust bucket surroune by roamers who roll a rear passenger tire onto my left ankle.<eos> Hey, something goo came out of toay.<eos> While I was waiting for you, I searche through the neighborhoo.<eos> I foun that.<eos> You lost the license plates.<eos> I lost the car.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> That monstrosity out front can run.<eos> It's so ugly, it'll scare the roamers away.
And then one day, I hope to be just like you.<eos> A woman doctor!<eos> There's an idea.<eos> Mother would be proud.<eos> Come and eat.<eos> Father! What good are you to the queen if you collapse from hunger during the birth.<eos> You need your strength.<eos> Respect your body.<eos> I respect the wishes of the king, and he wishes me there.<eos> His power doesn't lie with the crown it lies with the one who holds royal life in his hands, you father.
Oh, co... come on.<eos> You don't think it's possible I'm right?<eos> It's possible... unlikely.<eos> - Unlikely?<eos> - All their cars are here.<eos> There's no record of a taxi or car service to the house, and they didn't get on any planes or buses or trains.<eos> - You checked all that?<eos> - Yes, we checked it.<eos> And the doll... it's not news.<eos> We saw it was missing.

Heads up for old times' sake... there are inconsistencies in your officer-involved shooting.<eos> How?<eos> It's simple... a very bad man shot Gravely, then he shot me, then I shot him.<eos> The shooting board said I'm a hero.<eos> Cops investigating cops and making them heroes is why chief Cervantes formed civilian oversight.<eos> God, it really is good to see you.<eos> She likes you.<eos> She just kissed you on your gross, sweaty, hairy cheek.<eos> That's not gonna stop her from getting me fired or thrown in jail.<eos> I'm a drunk who lost the love of a good woman because I couldn't put down the bottle till it was empty.
A prison riot is like a candle under a glass.<eos> Eventually, it runs out of oxygen and it goes out.<eos> If we move in guns blazing, we add more oxygen.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me...<eos> What do we do?<eos> We got to wait.<eos> We don't have jurisdiction in this prison.<eos> They're running the show.<eos> Doesn't mean we can't lean on them, though.<eos> Can you see how deep it is?
Looks like everybody else took off on me.<eos> Come in.<eos> I don't bite.<eos> Well, i do...<eos> But i won't. I promise.<eos> I can't stand this waiting.<eos> If there's something wrong,<eos> They should just -- they should just tell us.<eos> It's weird how a minute is an empirical thing.<eos> It's 60 seconds, it never changes, And sometimes that minute flies, And other times it just crawls.
No one never said she was making Piri Piri.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Piri Piri, you marinate the whole chicken, which is why you don't need a knife.<eos> Plus, it's a lot of chicken for two people.<eos> It was frozen.<eos> It was frozen.<eos> She was using the knife to separate it.<eos> I do it all the time 'cause I live alone.<eos> Well, you don't say.<eos> I'm constantly forgetting to put the chicken out the night before, so it's always rock-solid, so I have to use the knife to wedge it apart.
It was good.<eos> It was a good pull.<eos> Is it too early for a drink?<eos> That depends on who you ask.<eos> Just leave the bottle.<eos> Thank you for coming to the funeral.<eos> Someone shows you respect in life, the least you can do is return the favor when they're gone.<eos> I'm sorry for your loss.<eos> You know, men like me... we're no strangers to death.<eos> Maybe because of that, when it hits close to home, we feel responsible.
I know.<eos> Well, wait, so if we have the same father...<eos> I mean, are you saying you're my half-brother?<eos> I think so.<eos> Bernadette, weird things are happening out here!<eos> I think I started to suspect it was a bad movie when I looked at the script and saw the title,<eos> Serial Ape-ist 2:<eos> Monkey See, Monkey Kill.<eos> Uh, spoiler alert:<eos> after the monkey sees, it kills.
Hey, guys.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hello.<eos> I have to return the helicopter.<eos> My father...<eos> What did you do?<eos> !<eos> Well, don't worry.<eos> He went to MIT.<eos> He can solve any problem, as long as it doesn't originate in a Russian man's colon.
Your Grace, I want to say--<eos> You will not speak.<eos> How do I know you are who you say you are?<eos> If only I were otherwise.<eos> If you are Tyrion Lannister, why shouldn't I kill you to pay your family back for what it did to mine?
Leave my stuff alone.<eos> - Where is the weed?<eos> - Look, this is my house, man.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's in the drum.
Hey. This is Henry from work.<eos> You see, the biggest problem is I can't use iTunes without a billing address, but they won't even recognise this place.<eos> Can I get it sort of... registered?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Could I talk to the council?<eos> Dunno.<eos> - Dunno.<eos> - My friend Leesha works at the town hall, and she says we could get a housing grant, if we converted the other room.<eos> Come and have a look.<eos> I mean, you couldn't live in here, but Leesha says it counts as a third bedroom, which means you can get money to fix it, officially.
The tanning bed must have melted your brain if you think...<eos> - Guys, Chuck, that's why we're here.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Let's stay on point.<eos> We're talking about the well-being of a man whom we all love very much.<eos> There's many factors.<eos> - Spite doesn't have to be one of them.<eos> - I was on the fence till you showed up.<eos> Thanks for helping me decide.<eos> Wave bye-bye to your cash cow because it's leaving the pasture.
- [laughs] Cheers to that.<eos> So... have you ever seen the "Ashes and Snow" exhibit?<eos> - No, I've never heard of it. - Oh!<eos> They're these unbelievable photographs of humans and animals in nature.<eos> I mean, they're.. T here's just no words that describe it.<eos> It's...<eos> It is breathtaking.<eos> Wow, I'd love to see it.<eos> Well, It's in La Jolla right now.<eos> It closes this weekend, but if you're interested and willing, you know, maybe we could drive up for the day on Sunday.
Wow, she's got a lot of rolling pins, huh?<eos> - Dreaming again?<eos> - Yes. Just the usual.<eos> - What about you? You still don't sleep?<eos> - No.<eos> This is just so sad.<eos> There were 1,754 people on the island in 1938 when the sanatorium closed.<eos> Now there are only 41 left.<eos> They don't even have a church anymore.<eos> It burned down in 1984.
You just bought a bar?<eos> That is fantastic.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Next round's on me.<eos> - Uh, thank you.<eos> - Awesome.<eos> Cheers!<eos> You know, Mac and Dennis aren't here-- they're not gonna ridicule us-- we get to just pick whatever we want to do.<eos> Well, you know I like making music.<eos> Yeah, and I like listening to it, but it hasn't really ever gotten us anywhere in the past, so, well, what about poetry?
He be talkin', but we don't be hearin'.<eos> I command you to stop.<eos> - Speaks like Zeus.<eos> - Smells like poops.<eos> Rage all over from his head down to his shoes.<eos> Zeus, poops and shoes?<eos> Guys, you suck at Def Poetry. You know what?<eos> Announcement-<eos> - I have an announcement to make, all right? Thank you for gathering for me.<eos> I'm wearing a mesh shirt, and it's totally sweet.
What about the price on yer head?<eos> I'm expecting a pardon, with the aid of the Duke of Sandringham.<eos> It hasn't come through yet, but we're hoping it will soon.<eos> Never thought you'd be so trusting of the English.<eos> Perhaps I could trouble you for some warm water to wash?<eos> Been a difficult few days.<eos> And you mentioned a chest from Leoch?<eos> Aye.<eos> It came from a woman called Mrs. Fitzgibbons.<eos> It's upstairs in the spare room.
Dov was working the Intelligence Unit before Jarvis shut them down.<eos> I mean, he's got to know something.<eos> And I would trust him with my life.<eos> Okay, go.<eos> I'll check the evidence-room records.<eos> Dov: Tonight?<eos> Yes, by 6:00, otherwise, Santana could sewer Oliver.<eos> So, what should I know?<eos> We found out where the bomb came from, - but it didn't go anywhere.<eos> - Where did it come from?
You know, Andy, I'm organizing a new U.C. Operation in Vancouver.<eos> It's five months, and I could use an operative that's unknown in the city.<eos> Yeah, well, I promised Sam that I would stick by him.<eos> Think of it as hitting pause till the dust settles.<eos> It might be good.<eos> Think about it.<eos> ♪ Ahh ♪<eos> ♪ baby, I'll behave ♪ What does my outfit say to you?<eos> "I'm wearing clothes."<eos> Does it say that, "my brother is a good guy, so please don't send him to prison"
I have a cat!<eos> What now?<eos> I have a cat.<eos> I thought it would make me a better lesbian.<eos> Why would having a cat make you a better lesbian?<eos> Crickett: I don't know, but a lot of those girls on The L Word have one, so I got one from the shelter.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> Y-You don't understand.<eos> I didn't feed the cat.<eos> And I have to feed the cat or it will die, and then I will be a cat killer.
- Slut.<eos> - Do not talk to your mother like that.<eos> So just because Daniel brought a friend, we have to act like a normal family?<eos> His friend has a name.<eos> Ah... yes.<eos> Gasoline.<eos> I notice only neanderthal-like primates call him that.<eos> Very funny.<eos> Now return the jacket.<eos> Now it stinks of gasoline.
We drove 500km to get here and you don't even want to talk to her?<eos> Not when my hair looks like this.<eos> - Just pretend it wasn't like that.<eos> - No.<eos> Then I'll talk to her.<eos> You coward!<eos> Go and talk to her!<eos> Not when my hair is like this!<eos> The cut is great.<eos> It reminds me of a samurai.
The librarian and his friends used the door to open a path to a place they had lost.<eos> You're notes were spot-on!<eos> - Notes?<eos> - About the pyramids... that you sent me.<eos> Uh, I didn't send any notes.<eos> But then a hero arrived to set the world right...<eos> Dulaque!<eos> Thanks to the hard work those librarians did for him.<eos> I didn't want to use this option.<eos> It doesn't just change this world.

And at the same time, see if you can raise it into the clevinger field effect range.<eos> - He's not making any sense.<eos> - Ha ha ha!<eos> - That's a good thing!<eos> - Clevinger field is where researchers think telepathy occurs.<eos> Right. Yes.<eos> Can you see what he's thinking?<eos> It's... it's a little bit of a telepathy joke.<eos> Anyway, uh, assuming that magic is real... and I'm not assuming that magic is real...<eos> But it might be real in this reality... what you have is a spirit/energy overlay.
She will die for you, no matter how much you don't want her to.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> Jenkins... he's our Judson... he's not here, but the thread of the labyrinth was right here.<eos> But this isn't your timeline. This is her timeline.<eos> Whatever you did to get that ball of twine here never...<eos> Happened.<eos> So how do I get back to my timeline?<eos> You can't.<eos> History is fraying.<eos> It's pulling apart.
He's very good at manipulating people.<eos> Right now he's smiling because he knows the only thought in your head is getting on the next plane to Iceland.<eos> This is a bad place.<eos> You should not be here.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> You could just... turn around.<eos> It is so simple a thing, just... just turn the wheel, and the future changes.<eos> - It is not that simple.<eos> - It is.<eos> You stopped your wedding, but it's still going to happen.
You spend all your money on my medicine.<eos> - Don't talk like that.<eos> - You would be a success without me.<eos> - You would not have to live here.<eos> - Not listening.<eos> If I wasn't such a bad person, I'd stop taking my medicine and let you get on with your life.<eos> This is my life.<eos> This is why we came here.<eos> To make money, to be happy, to be healthy.<eos> Besides, when I iron my shirt, it always burns up.
When Jamie and Ian stood shoulder to shoulder, There was no one who could take the pair of them down.<eos> Jenny.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> My waters have broken. Looks like this laddie's on his way.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's get you inside.<eos> Jenny, it feels to me that this baby is breech.<eos> Well.<eos> He's in the wrong position.<eos> The head should be down here, but it's still up here.
I'm a fighter. And I'm good at it.<eos> I grew tired of fighting for rich Dukes and monarchs.<eos> I realized the world is mine.<eos> And money taken is twice as sweet as money earned.<eos> Here, that's a souvenir from our last raid.<eos> Open it.<eos> "pale death visits with impartial foot "the cottages of the poor and the castles of the rich."<eos> These were made for Mary Stuart.<eos> Real barrel of laughs, that one.<eos> You know, I don't mind death As long as it comes under an open sky.
God our father, your power brings us to birth. Your providence guides our lives, and by your command, we return to dust.<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> I was reminded of the sad timelessness of war.<eos> Victors carry their dead from fields and bury them.<eos> The losers are left to slowly decay back into the soil.<eos> I found more tracks.<eos> East.<eos> Just as Ian said. They have a cart.<eos> It's heavy.
Oscar, where have you been hiding this guy?<eos> And can we shove him back in there?<eos> We've been friends for years, but I didn't know what it'd be like to live with him.<eos> I'm starting to think I made a mistake.<eos> Gazpacho time!<eos> A horrible, horrible mistake.<eos> Dig in, boys.<eos> It's a vegan feast.<eos> Try one of the meat-free chicken wings.<eos> If a chicken had no meat, it would just fall down to the ground.
Claire?<eos> I'll be in my study if you need me.<eos> What are you working on?<eos> - Brought you a coffee.<eos> - My saviour.<eos> The Leadership meeting yesterday morning.<eos> It lasted four and a half minutes.<eos> - Where'd you hear that?<eos> - That's not long enough to reject a major domestic agenda.<eos> I wasn't in the meeting. I don't know how long it lasted.
The president has strong electoral and other political incentives to act in the public interest.<eos> You yourself have investigated the White House for abuse of power.<eos> It forced a president to resign.<eos> Now you maintain that, uh, we should give our president a wide berth?<eos> I am not here to defend any one person, but rather the office of the presidency itself.<eos> We must hold everyone in government accountable to the law.<eos> But we must not manufacture our interpretation of the law to erode constitutional authority.<eos> We can prosecute presidents, but not the presidency.<eos> We have to assume this is happening.<eos> We need to end her campaign before it begins.
- No.<eos> Just you.<eos> - No, not just me!<eos> You're fucking with the second largest daily in America.<eos> You can get rid of me, but you can't get rid of the institution I work for.<eos> You done?<eos> Don't let your 15 minutes of power go to your head, Seth.<eos> You can keep the plastic if you want...<eos> as a souvenir.<eos> That's all it's good for, now.
They canned the guy.<eos> About 1,000 of them made it out into general circulation.<eos> They managed to get most of them back, melt them down, but...<eos> There are still... 200-plus floating around out there.<eos> What's that?<eos> I didn't catch that.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> Do you mind, buddy?<eos> We're having a private conversation here.<eos> This one's not in perfect condition, but on the open market, I'd say it's worth... 600 or 800 bucks.
The dictatorship of equatorial Uqbar Orbis is detaining him on trumped-up charges.<eos> Now, the Abbassi family...<eos> They're going crazy.<eos> They will reward whoever helps them get their boy back.<eos> The hitch is, the banks have frozen their... I'm talking Irish sweeps tickets, a whole trunk full of 'em.<eos> They're just sitting at O'Hare, impounded in customs.<eos> Now, I know what you're saying... "So what?"<eos> I can leave this as security, but you got to understand...<eos> This violin is my livelihood.<eos> It's a valuable antique.

(electronic buzzing continues) (sighs) Fine!<eos> Mom...!<eos> I think when you shut down Natal-Cam you got his attention. (siren wailing in distance)<eos> MAN (on video): Put Natal-Cam back online or Caleb dies.<eos> KRUMITZ: I mean, he could've just called the land line at the Reynolds' house.<eos> Why send the threat to a neighbor?<eos> Target wanted maximum impact.<eos> He sends us a video of Caleb in distress.<eos> Intimidation tactic.<eos> Well, it worked; We're here.
Not someone who shies away from controversy.<eos> It's one thing to shy away from controversy.<eos> It's another thing to court it.<eos> Well, Michael was arrested for speaking his mind.<eos> If defending free speech is controversial, then... we're no better than Russia.<eos> I wish that there were more people in our government defending it.<eos> Are you talking specifically about the Underwood Administration?<eos> I think the president could do more.<eos> You know, the White House has said hat they've been speaking directly with the Kremlin, that they, and I quote here:<eos> "Have to tackle this issue as it relates to the larger diplomatic relationship between the two nations."
I want to show you something.<eos> You build it and they come.<eos> Today, the Washington Mall is the real Field of Dreams.<eos> Three thousand people have registered since we set up shop this morning.<eos> Now that's what I call a Fourth of July party!<eos> And we're gonna keep the party going 'round the clock, 24/7, till everyone in DC who wants a job can make their way down here and sign up.<eos> Have a look.<eos> - Do you see that line of people?<eos> - The AmWorks tent.<eos> It stretches from there all the way to the Lincoln Memorial.
I cannot believe you did this!<eos> We sat down, we made rules.<eos> No poaching.<eos> It's not poaching.<eos> She came to me.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> Even if they let me on the Warblers, I'll be fighting for every vocal breakout.<eos> Yeah, you'll be fighting that fight anywhere.<eos> Yeah, but at least here, it'll be a fair fight.<eos> With the changes Principal Sylvester has made to the school, it's academically on par with any private school in the state.
Uh, what's your blood type?<eos> Uh, AB-negative.<eos> Your uncle is a type "O."<eos> He can only accept a liver from someone with the same blood type.<eos> Oh.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> So, does that mean I go on some kind of list or something?<eos> Yes.<eos> But your tumor's still growing.<eos> We're gonna do some further testing to determine how fast, but if it reaches five centimeters before a donor has been found, then you won't be eligible for a transplant anymore.
Well, you didn't know him like I did.<eos> You're gonna leave a little bit of that for me, right, honey?<eos> Doin' okay?<eos> Yeah, if I was a pincushion.<eos> Uh, if my mother is a match, what's the next step?<eos> Well, we need to make sure that you're healthy, determine if your liver is large enough.<eos> How much are you plannin' to take?<eos> Well, two-thirds of it for the transplant.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It regenerates.

- Thank you.<eos> - All right, buddy, we'll see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Yep.<eos> Wow, I didn't think you were gonna sign him on the spot.<eos> Well, what can I say, Buck?<eos> Uh...<eos> I hate to miss out on a good thing when it comes along.
To work.<eos> We're gettin' interviewed by "Pitchfork."<eos> I told you last night.<eos> Did you forget already?<eos> I haven't slept in weeks.<eos> I feel like the life force is being sucked out of my body.<eos> Okay?<eos> I am sorry that I might've forgotten about your dumb band.<eos> Sorry, your band's not dumb.<eos> It's very good.
- Yeah, it is all changed.<eos> - Not between us.<eos> - The way you... it's all we think about, it's all Maddie sees.<eos> And I just can't...<eos> I can't do it 24/7.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Will.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I'm sorry about yesterday.<eos> I listened to the song, like, a hundred times, and it's great.

What was your question again?<eos> Why was I brought up in hiding?<eos> You are the son of... a man of great power and wealth...<eos> Aegeus.<eos> Your father is the king of Athens.<eos> And as his first born son... you carry the Sacred Lexicon inside of you.<eos> The Lexicon?<eos> A thing of unimaginable power.<eos> - Inside me?<eos> - It's hidden.
Aegeus.<eos> Your father is the king of Athens.<eos> And as his first born son... you carry the Sacred Lexicon inside of you.<eos> The Lexicon?<eos> A thing of unimaginable power.<eos> - Inside me?<eos> - It's hidden.<eos> We will have to work together - to retrieve it.<eos> - What does it do?<eos> It leads to the doors of Olympus.
The regiment from Thebes is in no condition to face the enemy.<eos> Oh, they'll be quite safe.<eos> The enemy won't attack the west wall, seeing it guarded by Abyssinian archers.<eos> But the men of Thebes look nothing like Abyssinians.<eos> Have them swap armour.<eos> Subterfuge?<eos> From a distance, they will look the same.<eos> But we will offend Apollo, god of light and truth.<eos> And earn the respect of Ares, god of war.<eos> When the enemy climbs the east wall at night, believing it's unguarded, the real Abyssinian archers will be waiting for them.
That's what I think it's going to look like.<eos> What was your favorite part?<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're here.<eos> - Can I help you?<eos> - Get out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I tried your little saying and I'm off the business.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I made your joke and it failed miserably.
For example, I like your beard.<eos> I... Like your... Red hair.<eos> I sort have a thing for recessive genes.<eos> Well, every other generation of my family has a sixth toe on their left foot.<eos> Can you take off your shoes and count to 11?<eos> You'll have to get me into sandals to find out.<eos> I also like science fiction.<eos> Hello!<eos> You are going to love my book idea.<eos> It's about a planet with not one, not two, not 10, but 8 different genders.
You're messing with someone's life.<eos> She wanted this more than anything in the world.<eos> What about Zee?<eos> You haven't asked me about her.<eos> Why did you lie to me?<eos> I told you the painting would vanish Zee, I never said to where.<eos> So you played me.<eos> I protected you.<eos> From what?<eos> I manipulated the painting in case it got into the wrong hands.
May I ...?<eos> July 9th.<eos> We fought again today.<eos> But this time I can't say sorry.<eos> Why am I such a fucking idiot?<eos> - Felicia is great.<eos> - She's the best.<eos> She'll go far.<eos> That's the thing with music.<eos> It's not about the music but about the feelings it creates. Euphoria, nostalgia...
Having secrets no one would understand.<eos> I didn't write my first book.<eos> My friend.<eos> - The one who died.<eos> - He wrote it?<eos> The first half.<eos> He didn't show it to anyone except me.<eos> In the hospital, he asked me destroy it.<eos> I told him I would.<eos> It was too good.
Oh, you've gotta be fucking kidding me.<eos> If you're here for the tour, Justin's taking one out now.<eos> Yeah. Uh, Mr. Thicodedious, have you got your Insulin this time?<eos> All right, now, for our first stop, everybody, it's gonna be the church that inspired the exciting conclusion to the fifth Victoria novel...<eos> I'm not here for the tour.<eos> I just wanted to check the place out.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Holy fuck. You're Cassie Cranston.<eos> I'm... I'm literally reading your column right now.<eos> - It's like my Bible.
- People from around town.<eos> Or Cassie, if you wanted get involved.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I... I mean, I... I, that wasn't... that wasn't part of the... no.<eos> Um, okay, I think this little experiment has just proven that we need to go a little bit slower.<eos> So, let's get together again, but this time, ease into it, focus on the basics.<eos> And if all goes well, then, round two.<eos> Look, I don't want to sound like a jerk here, okay? But what am I supposed to do with this erection?<eos> - I mean... -Yeah, I saw a papaya on the counter there you could probably have your way with.<eos> No, it's too ripe. It's not gonna work.
Can I ask a silly question?<eos> How come none of you have realized what a terrible idea this is?<eos> Hmm?<eos> I mean, for one night of awkward pleasure, you are gonna jeopardize friendships, marriages even...<eos> Look around, these are your neighbors, your friends,<eos> I just want to make sure that you've thought about this.<eos> Really thought about it.<eos> This is a small town. People are gonna find out.<eos> One of you will talk, maybe not right away, but eventually.<eos> I read Cassie's article, and the reason why it upset at everybody is 'cause she's right.
- What I want is the cipher.<eos> Then I suggest we have a stalemate.<eos> Prepare to enter the building.<eos> Please. My father is in there.<eos> I warn you.<eos> If you lay hands on a Spanish citizen, there will be dangerous consequences.<eos> The French will never let you leave with that cipher.<eos> Perales will arrange something.<eos> I have never understood irrational hatred.<eos> It stifles every decent impulse, destroys common sense and reason.
What does the King say about all this?<eos> Will he meet her?<eos> The King, he is busy with affairs of state.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> Oh, a small principality would be nice.<eos> Mm, how witty you are!<eos> It is rare to find beauty and humour in a woman.<eos> Now if we just take off this choker.<eos> I never take that off, Sire, not for anyone.<eos> It conceals a birthmark. A disfigurement.
My friends...<eos> You have followed me across France to do God's work.<eos> But this is where our journey ends.<eos> My visions were based on deceit and treachery.<eos> They were not from God.<eos> I renounce them.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> They've corrupted you somehow...<eos> This holy war was a phantom of my imagination.<eos> It can only end in your deaths.
Perfectly timed to the arrival of our ships from the West Coast.<eos> I guess he... he got desperate.<eos> And this is how he tried to... to right the ship.<eos> I just... I can't believe it.<eos> Dr. Gallinger.<eos> How do you do, Dr. Warner?<eos> May I present my wife Eleanor and her sister Miss Walcott.<eos> Ladies, pardon us a moment while we discuss the arrangements.<eos> I wanted you to see our day room.<eos> I think your wife will find it quite soothing.
Like for instance, how do you two take a shite?<eos> Is it together like or does it all just go through one of you?<eos> Now, I'm going to place a clamp on the hepatoduodenal ligament.<eos> Normally, when you cut into the liver, the hemorrhaging would be enormous, but watch.<eos> There's virtually no blood loss.<eos> And our patient?<eos> Pulse is steady.<eos> This is the key to the separation.<eos> We enter here at the bottom where they're joined, get access to the ligament and clamp it off.<eos> The delicate work will be to split the liver in half, giving equal amount to each girl so that it can regenerate evenly in both of them.
You don't have to yell, Doc.<eos> My hearing's fine, too.<eos> Annabeth: Oh, Zoe, your hair's a little...<eos> That's because Wade and I were in there, and I tripped...<eos> Hey, no offense, Zoe.<eos> I do not have time to talk about your hair.<eos> I have to figure out how to tell Lemon I accidentally told Brick to ask Shelby to do the talent show, so...<eos> Everybody, stop.<eos> I need a physical right away.<eos> I think there's something wrong with my hand, because my sleight of hand, it just... it isn't sleight.
Signore Galileo has proven the moon circles the Earth, as the Earth circles the sun.<eos> As the new moon orbits the Earth, it moves in front of the sun, like so.
Is this wise, sir?<eos> Can Grambler not wait till you're stronger?<eos> ~ Dr Choake ordered bed-rest.<eos> ~ Dr Choake doesn't have a failing mine or a son who's neither use nor ornament!<eos> I'm touched by your faith, Father.<eos> Not sufficiently touched to behave like a man and the heir of Trenwith?<eos> ~ Father!<eos> ~ Father!<eos> I never knew such ironstone.<eos> It's impenetrable.
Creepy monolog alert.<eos> So maybe it's no good if he's the only one who's watching.<eos> Exactly, yeah!<eos> It's the age of Instagram and YouTube and Tumblr.<eos> I mean, we need to share the things we do... or it's like it never happened.<eos> Riley, phones off.<eos> Sorry, Mr. B.<eos> My friend from Saint Mary's texted. A girl that goes there died.<eos> No way.<eos> Who was it?
I wasn't there, but you were.<eos> You been summoned?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he's hinting that he wants me to go in and back up his story.<eos> I've never known Backstrom to hint, but he does know that an eyewitness account trumps forensics every time.<eos> Okay, so you think I should help him out?<eos> Uh, if a tree falls in a forest and no one's there to hear it, does it make a sound?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the same argument can be made about the truth.<eos> It exists, regardless of the perception of a witness.
Someday, you're gonna wonder to yourself if I'm somebody you can count on, and now you know you can.<eos> We're so happy the police finally found the killer.<eos> I mean, it was the scariest thing.<eos> Gender-nonconforming people face such an elevated risk of violence.<eos> In this case, we actually get closure.<eos> [Sniffing rhythmically] We won't get Jenna back, but maybe this will not happen to somebody else.<eos> Valentine: [Slurring] Ah! Well... [Door slams]<eos> ♪ Tha-a-a-ank you! ♪<eos> My God, this thing's a charm!<eos> It's like black magic!
16 hours and this never happened.<eos> Ah!<eos> Ah!<eos> Nate, you're home.<eos> Early.<eos> And you're snug as a bug in my mug.<eos> I love that mug.<eos> I made it in third grade.<eos> The craftsmanship is flaess.<eos> And now it's yours.
This is nice. (Chuckles)<eos> - You have to go, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're going? Oh!<eos> Oh! Gosh!<eos> You know I have, like, an entire bedroom.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> - It's just there!
I made the mistake of standing up for myself.<eos> You got wood, faggot?<eos> Let's strip him!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> The hot water came from the same boiler that heated the radiator.<eos> I still have scars on my stomach from the second-degree burns.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Fucking monsters.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That locker room might have made my father the man that he is, but it also made me the woman that I am.
I still have scars on my stomach from the second-degree burns.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Fucking monsters.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That locker room might have made my father the man that he is, but it also made me the woman that I am.<eos> After that, I quit the swim club.<eos> I quit trying to fit in, trying to be one of them.<eos> I knew I never would be.<eos> But more importantly, I didn't want to be.<eos> Their violence... was petty and ignorant, but ultimately, it was true to who they were.
And I think she's causing it.<eos> Hit record.<eos> Do it now.<eos> It costs you nothing.<eos> But it's worth something to you, so you're not getting it for free.<eos> What does the book do?<eos> - Tell us. - I told you.<eos> - It opens your eyes.<eos> - How?<eos> It triggers the memory centers of the brain, clearing the fog and bringing the images of the Dread Doctors into focus.
Do they know how to kill him?<eos> I think, for obvious reasons, they won't answer that question.<eos> Then I don't see how they can help me.<eos> No.<eos> You're here to help them.<eos> Over the millennia, they have gathered vast resources that could help you in your hunt.<eos> A legend has passed down through the centuries... concerning a book, an ancient tome of uncertain provenance and some say divine inspiration;<eos> the Occido Lumen.<eos> And, uh... what do you know of this book?<eos> I now have proof that it exists.
- Can we finish our business?<eos> Here, I brought you the purchase agreement.<eos> Tell them that in... thank you... in the middle of this medical holocaust, they're the luckiest real estate sellers in the city.<eos> Give them exactly 12 hours.<eos> I'm not moving on the price... except down. Yes, sir.<eos> I'll get you an answer.<eos> No, Miss Marchand, get me the property.<eos> We either interrupt the chain of infection here... by developing a vaccine or we pour our efforts into a cure here.<eos> Or we find a way to get to the Bahamas.<eos> I love the chart, it's awesome.
- if we don't figure out what's wrong.<eos> - Donna, no.<eos> Whatcha playing?<eos> Another fat-ass game with color.<eos> We blew a breaker, didn't we?<eos> We didn't blow the breaker.<eos> I think we blew the whole block.<eos> Going.<eos> Does your work have you feeling small and insignificant?<eos> Is it as boring as a hand full of beans?
Yeah, it's very good.<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> And besides, it wasn't up to you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was getting worried.<eos> Did everything go okay?<eos> At dinner last night... do you believe those things you said about me?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Yes, I left some details out.<eos> I didn't say that you hurt a lot of people or that you lied your way through the door, but you made that company what it is today.
Take care of yourself.<eos> Get some sleep.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?<eos> We're kissing now?<eos> C'mere, Zack.<eos> Take care of yourself, big guy.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - You, uh, send me a postcard.<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> Well, it'll show up in a couple a years.
Nobody's coming, child.<eos> OSCAR: What is it with Yonkers?<eos> It's like that game where, uh, you hit the animal that...<eos> - Whac-A-Mole?<eos> - That's it.<eos> Every time I resolve one problem, another one jumps up.<eos> But this... insisting on two apartment walk-ups rather than single-family homes is just so shortsighted.<eos> Mr. Smith, does the city housing authority agree?<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> We've bought Oscar's "Defensible Space" theory. We believe it's the way to go.
- Uh-huh.<eos> And the compromise plan the council approved fell apart the day before they were going to give it to Sand.<eos> Mary, we can stop the next 800 units.<eos> Jack, the thing is affordable housing is for people who can afford to rent. So it's not the same thing.<eos> It's the same.<eos> It drops down property values, it brings in the bad element.<eos> It's just I don't agree with you, okay?<eos> They said you went to the other side. I didn't believe them.<eos> You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.
This thing's moving too fast, and it's heading for New York.
I will never.<eos> It is your nature, Succubus.<eos> You can't avoid what you were made for.<eos> You can't make me do this.<eos> I emancipated myself from you.<eos> I have nothing to do with you!<eos> Nothing to do with me?<eos> Our connection runs much deeper than a hand print.<eos> Deeper than hell shoes.<eos> It runs deeper than blood.
I knew.<eos> It was the best moment of my life. A moment of epiphany that made me famous and then ruined me.<eos> In the haste and the heat of ambition, the Questura nearly destroyed the young man's home, trying to find evidence.<eos> - He doesn't leave evidence.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> He eats it.<eos> Another man, not an innocent man, but innocent of those crimes, was a dream suspect.<eos> He was convicted on no evidence except his character.<eos> Blame has a habit of not sticking to Hannibal Lecter.<eos> It has a habit of sticking to you.
Then you weren't paying attention.<eos> I pay lots of attention.<eos> But not in a wide-eyed, indiscriminate way.<eos> That may have been impulsive.<eos> Been mulling that impulse ever since you decided to serve Punch Romaine.<eos> I... I can't see.<eos> Technically, you killed him.<eos> No longer interested in... preserving the peace you found here?<eos> You cannot preserve entropy.<eos> It gradually descends into disorder.
Aye, a quick one.<eos> She's young.<eos> She's been there a while.<eos> She's lying face down, she's been covered with leaves.<eos> She's got nothing on her to identify her.<eos> Who found her?<eos> Mrs Relph.<eos> What was she doing here?<eos> Walking the dog.<eos> Where is it?
What, what's your name?<eos> You can call me Mr Smith.<eos> Rachel Coles, go ahead.<eos> ~ 'Suspect seen...' ~ Roger that.<eos> Wasn't your fault, guv.<eos> He's been seen heading towards the riverside.<eos> Right, Rachel, you go with him.<eos> All units hold back.<eos> Sir?<eos> We've found the car. It's empty.
It means castle.<eos> I got it.<eos> What were they after?<eos> A painting I gave to my grandson, nearly two hundred years ago.<eos> It's known as The Vanishing.<eos> Appropriate.<eos> Uh-yeah, because it's rarely ever been seen.<eos> It's never been on display.<eos> That painting was an urban legend in Valkyrie school.<eos> It's real though, and as dangerous as art gets, apparently.
And they mentioned a Succubus who slayed the Una Mens.<eos> And really, how many of those are there?<eos> I'm gonna say less than fifty.<eos> I was thinking...<eos> We find it first.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Or as they say in Spain...<eos> Bingo.<eos> And if Zee's the one who sent people in after the painting, the legend must be true.<eos> Where is it now?
Locked up tight.<eos> He's my prisoner now.<eos> According to lore, this makes me your prisoner.<eos> I don't roll like that, Perseph.<eos> You mean I can just walk out?<eos> I believe you can fly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Before you go, tell me anything you can about the painting.<eos> I've heard it contains The First Song.
Before they vanished.<eos> If Zeus and Hades are mortal enemies, they probably want to banish each other using this painting.<eos> Guys, we have the painting.<eos> Honey, that could be your mantra, but we're still gonna need clarification.<eos> We have the power to banish both Jack and Zee.<eos> Wait up, who's Jack?<eos> My father.<eos> We're calling him Jack.<eos> Okay.<eos> We may have the painting, but we don't know how it works.

Now, I don't know how Matt got it, but I'd assume that the jacket would have Tom's killer's DNA on it.<eos> - Was this your jacket?<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> How do you know Tom's killer had a blue jacket?<eos> From you!<eos> You asked Dave if I had a blue ja...<eos> I saw a blue jacket in the woods with a bloodstain on it.<eos> I thought you'd want to know!<eos> And it's missing.
You know I'm gonna take your secrets to the grave with me, right?<eos> Tyler being an addict explains a lot.<eos> He's using again.<eos> He had scratches on his knuckles, and Lisa had a split lip.<eos> Maybe he's violent and she's scared.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. What?<eos> Maybe you're on the fast bus to crazy town, man.<eos> Tyler is a good kid.<eos> He's got, like, a tiny criminal record.<eos> If he was on something and killed Tom, that would explain why Matt had the jacket and why it disappeared.
Will you just...<eos> - I really should get going.<eos> - I know.<eos> Do you have all the photographs you need?<eos> You're free to take the car, Mrs. Crawford.<eos> I'll just finish up here with your husband.<eos> Honey, unless, do you want me to follow you to the shop?<eos> No, my client's picking me up.<eos> Any luck... Finding your jacket?<eos> It's not mine, and no.
It's the murder weapon... lots of them.<eos> Mr. Crawford, I need to be sure that you know this is serious.<eos> I'll compile a threat assessment, but in the meantime...<eos> You need to watch your back.<eos> Do you think Uncle Michael will make us eat that stupid fruitcake again?<eos> Probably.<eos> But you could offer to make another dessert and save us.<eos> Can't we just skip his Christmas party?<eos> It's so boring.<eos> It is, but it's important to your mother... it's her family.
My kids could break into my garage.<eos> Perhaps, but I highly doubt they could send me a text message from your telephone number that's untraceable.<eos> You can't figure out where it came from?<eos> I need you to make a list of anyone you've angered lately, and if this escalates in any way, please... Contact me.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why do you care?<eos> To protect and serve, Mr. Crawford, that's the job.<eos> Yeah, rehab was interesting.<eos> It's definitely not something I want to do over again.<eos> - But it was helpful?
It was mine.<eos> - I was just trying to help.<eos> - I don't want your help!<eos> Then what do you want?<eos> - Please tell me because I can't go on like this.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - You barely say a word to me.<eos> - What do you want me to say?<eos> - You spent four years at war.<eos> - Yeah, and now it's over.
- That's why I--<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself.<eos> He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> 'Cause if you did, you'd know that you are just a small part of it.<eos> That's what an empire is.<eos> It's bigger than any son or daughter.
But we recognize promises were made in blood, generations ago.<eos> What he's saying is we're not gonna make the first move.<eos> But if these Kansas City mooks come at you shootin', we'll cut the goddamn nose off their face.<eos> Late.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Couldn't get the shampoo out of my hair.<eos> Soft water.<eos> Say what?<eos> This goddamn northern water.<eos> It's slick to the touch.
There was a cleaver in the man's head, son, which Noreen said was you.<eos> Not to mention there's a war going on up in Fargo that you may have started when you ran over that Gerhardt boy in Peggy's car.<eos> You or-- or-- or-- or Peggy or both.<eos> This is all just so crazy.<eos> And I can't stop thinking about that book.<eos> Noreen's book.<eos> It's, like, stuck in my head.<eos> What?<eos> What book?<eos> It's about this guy who, every day, he-- he pushes this rock up this hill.
Oh, shit, I can't remember.<eos> Well, either way, it was a fine picture.<eos> Governor, I don't mean to, uh...<eos> What we did over there, the war?<eos> Um... and now?<eos> My wife's got lymphoma.<eos> Uh, Stage III.<eos> And, uh, lately, the state of things, uh...<eos> Well, sometimes, I... late at night...<eos> I wonder if maybe the sickness of this world, if it isn't inside my wife somehow.
Yeah?<eos> Okay, first, I want...<eos> My husband...<eos> Second, I need assurances that none of my children, or my grandchildren are in line for any repercussions.<eos> This is my choice. My war.<eos> They're just doing what they're told.<eos> Capital crimes excluded.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Murder in the first and the like.<eos> What's the point of the damn deal if it doesn't cover murder?
This spell requires an enormous amount of power.<eos> Which you have.<eos> And that power needs to be anchored, or I'll be lost inside Eva's mind along with Rebekah.<eos> Unlike your magic, mine isn't anchored to any one place.<eos> Because of you, I have no home.<eos> Perhaps, but there is no other spell.<eos> Oh. You.<eos> I can use you as my anchor.<eos> I'll channel your power while I breach Eva's mind.<eos> And there it is.
I was just about to go.<eos> Brothers...<eos> We should go.<eos> Traitor!<eos> She's the mother of my son.<eos> You do not get to judge me.<eos> Too late.<eos> This concludes our business.<eos> Only...if the serum is genuine.<eos> It's genuine.
Me and John and, God help me, Malcolm, are not going to let this happen, and we have friends, and we have resources and we will go to war to get Oliver back.<eos> You know, many lifetimes ago, I loved a woman immeasurably.<eos> And she loved me.<eos> And we had a son and then a daughter, and for many years, I felt I was the most fortunate man in the world.<eos> My life was bliss.<eos> And one night, a man came to my door and he gave me a horrible choice-- to leave without saying a word to them, or to stand and watch them tortured and then killed.<eos> And I left without a farewell.<eos> And to spare them pain, I endured an agony worse than death.<eos> Sounds like you gave up too easily.<eos> If there's one immutable truth about life... It's often more cruel than it is fair, and rarely provides an opportunity for any of us to find closure.
During the fighting, Your technique was competent?<eos> Why do I feel like that's your idea of a compliment?<eos> Could certainly be improved.<eos> Is that an offer to teach me?<eos> I have nowhere else to go.<eos> It is not customary for one to wait so long Before accepting a great honor.<eos> I'm not accepting it.<eos> Wing ta lao wo chey.<eos> "The tale to be told begins thus."<eos> Maseo, this story, it's over before it begins.
Well, I think we both know that that's not true. Oh, it is.<eos> As far as you're concerned.<eos> You shouldn't grow up too fast.<eos> Yeah, well, you're not my brother.<eos> You're right, no, I'm not.<eos> But I think about him every single day.<eos> For the first time, I'm glad he's gone.<eos> 'Cause seeing you like this would break his heart.<eos> It's funny how Ollie seems to care more about me now that he's dead than he did when he was alive.<eos> Every time I spoke to his grave, it always felt so empty.
Yeah.<eos> The company computers are protected by biometric encryption.<eos> Look for a fingerprint reader.<eos> Ok, but why wouldn't they take me out of the directory?<eos> Why would they?<eos> You're dead.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm in.<eos> The crawler's programmed to seek out all of Kang's network traffic.<eos> And it's running.
Yeah.<eos> You could use the practice in that.<eos> I just think sometimes you're so focused on people you love, you forget... to see that there are people who love you.<eos> Just enough innoculant for us.<eos> And Akio.<eos> What about her?<eos> We need to inject Akio and ourselves and then the three of you need to get somewhere safe.<eos> And what about you?<eos> I lifted this when I took the vaccine.<eos> And clearly, it belongs to one of Shrieve's men, because it has the plans for how they are going to distribute the virus.
- $17.50.<eos> - What an engaging accent.<eos> Do you mind if I ask where you're from?<eos> - Athens. $17...<eos> - Oh, I should have guessed.<eos> So musical, so Hellenic.<eos> My mother makes the finest.<eos> Lots of olives and garlic and just the right amount of rosemary to make you weep. Not like this pig I work for now.<eos> His food is garbage.<eos> Tastes like it comes from a dog's...
I'm not Fae anymore.<eos> We're over.<eos> We are capable of many things, but love...<eos> Remember, with great power comes great respo...<eos> Okay, Voltaire!<eos> Never forget.<eos> Hades' evil comes in many forms.<eos> ♪<eos> In lore, the horseshoe symbolizes protection.<eos> It wards off evil and brings good luck.
I make my own choices, my own mistakes.<eos> And I'm glad you push me to be better.<eos> It's so weird.<eos> There was a time in my life That I would've paid money for your autograph.<eos> And now we're...<eos> - Partners.<eos> - I was gonna say friends.<eos> - In case you doubt it, you push me to be better too.<eos> - Guys, you have to come look at this.<eos> When the heat gun was fired, It increased the surrounding temperature of the air
What did you do?<eos> Tell them.<eos> Sabine came to see me out of the blue.<eos> She said she was working for a clean-water project And thought our induction technology could help with the well drilling in africa.<eos> I-I showed her our coil system For obstructed wireless communication.<eos> She -- she was so impressed with me.<eos> I figured if I gave her one of our old prototypes --<eos> I don't know.<eos> How might this coil work with the bomb?<eos> It would make wireless detonation possible, Even through thick pipes Or if a bomb was buried underground.
And so... if you ever... want to talk about it, I'd be... be happy to.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's really sweet.<eos> Don't get carried away.<eos> Then there's this.<eos> What is this?<eos> It's a duck.<eos> I can see that.<eos> Harley made that for me when I was a little girl.<eos> And I, you know, I don't want it hanging around, cluttering up my apartment, so...
I can feel the sadness and the mania.<eos> That wasn't what I was going for at all.<eos> - Hmm. - Psst!<eos> - Well...<eos> - May I speak with you, please?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, guys, this is Grace.<eos> Her husband is my husband's lover.<eos> For crying out loud...<eos> I'll tell you that love is cruel but it teaches us who we are.
For how long...<eos> will I feel this sadness for Larry?<eos> - Aww. - Thank you.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh. Hey, hey, hey, hey.<eos> I'm sorry, little boy.<eos> I've been waiting a very long time to talk to Mrs. Harris and I can't account for you to cut in front of me.<eos> What are you going to say to her anyway?<eos> What is there to say, right?<eos> That I hope great-grandpa Larry feels all my love because it's as big as a million kisses from a million angels in heaven.
If anyone could be the target, how do we find him?<eos> I'm keeping my fingers crossed that when Nelson and Raven process that board, they'll find trace that'll give us a match within CODIS or AFIS.<eos> You do realize that keeping your fingers crossed is rarely, if ever, effective in fighting crime?<eos> Aware of it.<eos> So, as much as it pains me, I'm prepared to admit that my initial theory was wrong.<eos> Our hacker was not in the control room plugged in when the crash occurred.<eos> He only accessed the room once to place the board.<eos> After that, he did everything that I did in CTOC.<eos> He used a Bluetooth radio that he attached to the board to communicate with the computer to cause the crash.<eos> The board is our murder weapon, and now it's our smoking gun.
For one streamer to be useful, he's gotta know the exact location of his target.<eos> The sniper knew when Jeremy Fritz would be at that exact spot.<eos> All the other shootings were just to throw us off.<eos> Fritz was the sniper's primary target.<eos> If you'll let me, I'd like to take a look at your hand.<eos> I can help it feel better.<eos> May I take a look at your hand?<eos> It's sprained very badly.<eos> Here.<eos> This will help it heal faster and it won't hurt all the time.
How you doing?<eos> I'm good.<eos> Real good.<eos> I'm just... Just working the steps.<eos> Did I do something wrong?<eos> Danny's got you busy, huh?<eos> Seems like your whole life's turned around.<eos> Well, I owe him everything.<eos> He's an excellent boss.<eos> You ever think what your life might be like, how different it would be, if that case went to trial?
- My stomach.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Let's get you started.<eos> Put this under your tongue.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I am not dealing with the patients.<eos> I'm straightening linens, as instructed.<eos> Do you have pain anywhere other than your abdomen?<eos> No.<eos> Can you describe the pain, when it started?
Yeah, and all the devices were clean.<eos> They were not hacked in any way.<eos> Which mean all five drivers have a verified digital alibi.<eos> The ZoGo system was wrong.<eos> Right before he died, he got a message sent to his ZoGo app saying that his ride was canceled because he was a no-show.<eos> Guys, if he wasn't in a ZoGo, where was he?<eos> Ghost car.<eos> Our target hacked the app.<eos> Diverted all the data onto his cell phone. Masqueraded as a ZoGo driver.<eos> Cade got in his car thinking it was a real ZoGo.
I rarely check the face on the app with the driver.<eos> Yeah, well, that blind faith is gonna get you in trouble some day, Nelson.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna think twice about that.<eos> I just see the logo on the car window and I assume it's my ZoGo, so...<eos> Well, the psychology makes sense.<eos> Cade was a first-time ZoGo user.<eos> Unlike Nelson, he didn't know better.<eos> A car arrived at his location.<eos> It looked like a ZoGo.
I run a tech startup.<eos> Great-- then let us run this investigation.<eos> Got it.<eos> You see this router here?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's different than all the others on ZoGo's network.<eos> Confirmation our target is using an evil twin router.<eos> Yeah, and according to ZoGo's employee records, five employees are on vacation.<eos> Any one of them could have received the package.<eos> It would still be on their desk.
I only got scammed out of $1 million.<eos> Let me tell you our three theories.<eos> One... you're telling the truth, so you didn't say anything because there was nothing to be said.<eos> Theory number two...<eos> You're laundering money for the Mob.<eos> Your business was too small to lose $2 million, so... you didn't say anything because it was easier to write it off than it was to try to explain it to the IRS.<eos> Theory number three...<eos> You didn't say anything because... well... she cut you in.<eos> Now, this theory, Nick...<eos> It has the advantage of scaring the crap out of you.
There was a fight...<eos> - Prisoner 23B, you are currently in infirmary, starboard. Return to sub-level one for interrogation.<eos> There, sub-level one, I'm going...<eos> - No, I am!<eos> - John, you still need to figure out what the hell we're dealing with here! - Dutch, wait, wait, wait.<eos> - He used the nanites<eos> - on all of us.<eos> - "Nanites." There's no way to override them.<eos> The interrogation program won't stop.<eos> It just keeps going,
That's one way to beat it.<eos> I think I've found them.<eos> You figure out how to shut it off?<eos> Advances in submicroscopic technology allow the nanites to break down any organic matter in ways that mimic disease or trauma...<eos> We can't shut it off.<eos> It's just microscopic robots programmed to tear us down, and then build us up again and again.<eos> I mean, it's a perfect torture device really.<eos> And the program running them, when does it stop?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> The accident didn't just ruin the engine, it fried the whole system.
He bought yogurt and a candy bar.<eos> Receipt says 2:20 a.M.<eos> It's only a few minutes from the store To where we found his car and his body.<eos> And there's no evidence yet of any... Extramarital philandering.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> But it's a gift from kiki.<eos> And you can have it back When you're promoted to lieutenant.<eos> Right now I need you to speak like a real cop.<eos> As I was saying, if this guy was screwing around, It'd be difficult to hide it in this electronic age.<eos> If there was an affair, it'll turn up.
Oh, no!<eos> Frankie!<eos> Got it! Yeah!<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Susie: We did our best to try to protect the evidence,<eos> But there was just so much water.<eos> Does water destroy d.N.A.? No.<eos> Worse.<eos> It washes it away.
Morning.<eos> Your father.<eos> I love this painting.<eos> Do I look like it?<eos> I don't look like it?<eos> Since you like your painting.<eos> Yes!<eos> Why?<eos> You're full of it.<eos> Here's why it looks like you and why you're wonderful.
The first step in the healing process... is truly wanting to get better, believing that you can.<eos> Looking in your eyes, I know you do.<eos> Now stand up and open your shirt.<eos> We all carry demons...<eos> Addictions, anger.<eos> But for some of us, our curses are more tangible.<eos> They cannot be overcome.<eos> They must be extracted.<eos> And that is my curse, my burden... to draw the darkness from others.<eos> It's black.
Come on, dude, you don't know that.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do... because this has turned out like everything else I've ever done in Haven.<eos> I don't know what the hell I was expecting.<eos> Hey.<eos> It's Charlotte.<eos> She's weak.<eos> I can't help her like this.<eos> I can't see.<eos> Please, you need to figure out a way to stop this Trouble.<eos> We pulled another card for Dwight, but it might have made things worse.
~ A moment ago.<eos> ~ Ah, good.<eos> Good.<eos> Well, do not trouble yourself. I do not need it now.<eos> My name is Jonathan Strange.<eos> Perhaps you have heard of me?<eos> It was your - or one of your kind's - attentions to the King of England that first brought you to my notice.<eos> Such power, sir.<eos> English magic today lacks spirit. It lacks fire and energy.<eos> The glimpse I had of your magic persuaded me that it was something altogether different.
Show me this book if there is one!<eos> My rotten, no good, bastard father... .. was stupidly entrusted to deliver the Book of the Raven King to a man in the Derbyshire Hills, the last man in England who could read the King's letters.<eos> Unfortunately, en-route... he got himself embroiled in a drinking competition with a blacksmith in Sheffield, and when challenged proceeded to eat the book.<eos> Four years later, I was born... .. with it written all over my infant body.<eos> You... are the Book of the Raven King!<eos> I was born with this, just like you was born with that.<eos> Now, meaning is written on our skin, nameless slave.<eos> Indeed.<eos> My skin means that any man may strike me in a public place and never fear the consequence.<eos> It means no matter how many books I read, how many languages I master, no matter how diligently I work, I will never be anything but a curiosity.

~ I tell him his fortune.<eos> I tell him that he will be king.<eos> That he will be free from you.<eos> And how did you come by this fortune, little pig-person?<eos> My book!<eos> Englishmen and their books.<eos> Perhaps you had been better advised to sell your book and buy a nicer coat.<eos> This is John Uskglass's book, fairy, and it tells the fortunes of us all.<eos> And what is your fortune?<eos> I dunno, but it's better than yours.
Well, maybe that's on me not asking the right questions.<eos> You and Chessani, girls, human trafficking.<eos> You do their implants, nose jobs.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> With a secondary concentration in reconstructive surgery.<eos> You, Chessani, Caspere, you went back farther than you made out.<eos> The girls, spill.<eos> Your compensatory projection of menace is a guarantor of its lack.<eos> And it says something about the depths of your misperceptions.
Well, here we are: outside the law and alone.<eos> Have you told la polizia they're looking for Hannibal Lecter?<eos> They're motivated to find Dr Fell inside the law.<eos> Knowing who he is, what he's worth, it'll just coax them out of bounds.<eos> - It'd be a free-for-all.<eos> - And Hannibal will slip away.<eos> Will you slip away with him?<eos> A part of me will always want to.<eos> You have to cut that part out.<eos> Of course you found him here. Not because of the exhibit, but because of the crowd it attracts.
Mine? Yours?<eos> Mischa's.<eos> Did you eat her?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I did not kill her.<eos> The most stable elements, Chiyoh, appear in the middle of the periodic table, roughly between iron and silver.<eos> Between iron and silver... I think that's appropriate for you.<eos> Do we talk about teacups and time and the rules of disorder?<eos> The teacup's broken.<eos> It's never going to gather itself back together again.
Bart.<eos> I'm so glad you're feeling better!<eos> I've missed you!<eos> Come in.<eos> We must celebrate!<eos> These are good.<eos> Well, you deserve the best of everything, including your cookies.<eos> How about a twirl with your grandma?<eos> You listen to this old music?<eos> It's not old!
She wants to know how her product is going to be moved now.<eos> For the moment, you would... keep sending your deliveries to the Russians, as though nothing has changed.<eos> And when this is all over, I'll assume their responsibility.<eos> And move their share to your column in the ledger?<eos> A rising tide raises all boats, Leland.<eos> Profits will be divided up equally among us.<eos> Four shares, instead of five.<eos> Leland?<eos> What, I'm going against the three of you?<eos> I like my head where it's at.
Just... sorry, you know?<eos> Sergei tells me you know something.<eos> Something about the man who took my brother from me.<eos> Yeah, uh...<eos> Look, I know this guy, we did a stretch in Rikers.<eos> Getting by now at a chop shop on the edge of the Kitchen.<eos> Told me an SUV came in yesterday.<eos> Black... expensive... backseat all splattered with blood and... brains.<eos> This car...<eos> who does it belong to?
Thank him.<eos> Nearly got away from me.<eos> Us.<eos> Shouldn't we be panicking?<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> I can't die here with you.<eos> So don't.<eos> You know, feel free just to... Hey, I want the rest of your pep talk.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> It no longer applies.
The shithead that had me beat up?<eos> That's who you want me to help?<eos> Look, you have every right to tell me to go to hell, but he's important, Claire.<eos> What he knows could bring Fisk down and save more people like you from getting hurt.<eos> Claire?<eos> - Is there an exit wound?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> The bullet's still inside him.<eos> It's still half a degree hotter than the surrounding tissue.
Now, you listen to me.<eos> You love Javi, and Javi loves you.<eos> And I loved the $80,000 I spent on this wedding.<eos> Now go.<eos> Dearly beloved, we are gathered here today to celebrate the marriage of Javier and Zoila.<eos> And as I look upon you now, I'm reminded marriage is a sacred vow, built upon a foundation of respect and, above all, honesty.<eos> Marriage is also a public pledge of love and devotion everlasting in the eyes of God.<eos> And with those principles guiding us, I'd like to read to you from Corinthians 13:4-8.<eos> "Love is patient, love is kind. It does not envy, it does not boast, it is not proud.<eos> It is not rude, it is not self-seeking, it is not easily angered.
And how is tucker?<eos> Good.<eos> I think.<eos> Actually, uh, peri doesn't let me see him much.<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> So it's just been me and miguel.<eos> I had to give up the house.<eos> We moved into an apartment.<eos> It's not so big, but --
Hey.<eos> Listen, we're taking dinner<eos> To rosie in the hospital tonight.<eos> What do you want to bring?<eos> Tonight?<eos> Oh. I've got this party.<eos> For my book.<eos> Well, thanks for the invitation.<eos> Well, i wasn't sure that you'd want to go.<eos> It's at evelyn powell's.
Should i personalize it?<eos> Oh, yes. To my maid elida.<eos> Oh, that's nice. I want her to read about the woman Who cleaned the foyer with a toothbrush, 'cause i'm hoping she's gonna take the hint.<eos> Yours can read english?<eos> I'll give you $5,000 for her sight unseen.<eos> That's kind of offensive.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know how hard it is to find good help.<eos> That's what your whole book is about.<eos> That's not what it's about.
I know how close you were, and I'm sorry she had to go.<eos> Well, it isn't your fault.<eos> You see, dear, Zoila and I had a certain rapport.<eos> She always gave me her brutally honest opinion.<eos> You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street.<eos> You can tell me my dress is ugly, and I can tell you that I don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?<eos> Well, it's a little flat.
Thank God for that.<eos> Zola, could you make me a gimlet?<eos> It's four parts gin to one part...<eos> Amazing.<eos> You're the greatest housekeeper that ever lived.<eos> Just doing my job.<eos> That damn dog.<eos> Yeah, it's been like that all day.<eos> I know. My crazy neighbor keeps it out in the yard.<eos> It barks incessantly.
I'll go home and find it.<eos> What if she already did?<eos> - Thank you, Thomas.<eos> - Is everything okay?<eos> Remember when I said I thought my husband was having an affair?<eos> Well, I finally know who he's been screwing.<eos> And the bitch is gonna pay.<eos> Oh, there you are.<eos> Mr. Michael came to take Katy for the weekend and she couldn't find her dolly.<eos> It's in my car.
[ Clears throat ]<eos> You know what? Can I just -- sorry.<eos> Can I just talk to you for a second?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course.<eos> Pardon us, aunt d.<eos> [ Sighs ] I just - - I'm --<eos> I'm not sure that we need to be talking about another wedding, especially around all these people.<eos> Well, it's just my family, you know? No, I know.<eos> Obviously, it doesn't have to be in the fall, sweetheart.
[ Sighs ] I do.<eos> I can never get Lucy off the iPad.<eos> She has an iPad?<eos> Technically, it's my iPad, but she uses it more than I do.<eos> How is Lucy?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's been difficult.<eos> This whole thing has got her pretty rattled.<eos> So, you finally told her the truth?<eos> Oh, it came out.
I had a drink with her. We had dinner in the restaurant with her fiancé.<eos> Look, I...<eos> I get it, you know? My mistake in the past is causing you to doubt me in the present, and that's my fault.<eos> But I am trying to change that.<eos> Tomorrow's our 10-year wedding anniversary.<eos> Will you have dinner with me tomorrow night?<eos> - [Sighs] - 'Cause I would like to celebrate it with you.<eos> I made a reservation at Luke's, where, if you recall, I got down on one knee, and I proposed to you.<eos> If the date still means something to you, please come.<eos> I just wanted you to know that it still means something to me.
I...<eos> I thought the job was launching a new restaurant at the old post office downtown?<eos> Oh, no, sweetie pie.<eos> That space won't be ready till 2017.<eos> We haven't even started the demo on that one yet.<eos> Your assistant clearly said that...<eos> My assistant is a half-wit.<eos> She doesn't eat carbs, poor thing.<eos> The job is here.<eos> And it's yours if you want it.
Yeah, it would be incredible, except...<eos> Harry, come here.<eos> No, come here.<eos> Baby...<eos> Hmm? I am yours... forever.<eos> A year is not gonna change anything.<eos> You say that now.<eos> I know it. I know.<eos> Don't you understand what this could mean for you?<eos> This could give you all the power in the world to make your life exactly what you want it to be, make our life what we want it to be.
P...<eos> I got it.<eos> - Brianna?<eos> I got your text.<eos> - Bud, help!<eos> - Oh, what did you do to that brisket?<eos> - I did everything you told me to do.<eos> I took it out of the oven and then I sliced it, and now... this.<eos> I told you, you have to let it rest.<eos> Well, but, why does it get to rest and I don't?
You're a good, good girl.<eos> But you're not getting married, not in a million years.<eos> Hi, mamá.<eos> Hola, miguelito.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> Isn't this great?<eos> Now you can see the apartment.<eos> It's so exciting.<eos> Well, there's not much to look at.<eos> It's pretty small, actually.
Um... I got all this shit to do. No prob.<eos> I'll see you around.<eos> Okay.<eos> Oh, P.S., I need my car back at some point.<eos> Oh, God, I'm tripping out, man.<eos> Hey, are you okay, man?<eos> I love God and icebergs.<eos> What the fuck's wrong with him?<eos> That trip-weed your friend sold us.<eos> It wasn't normal shit.
So the police have already searched, so we have to think of places that they might have missed, or places that the hair could have moved since then.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bingo.<eos> You guys tell Mona's mom that she's got cameras in her molding.<eos> Why does it have to be me?<eos> Because she likes you.<eos> If you suggest the police should take another look, she'll listen.<eos> Just tell her that Mona said something about cameras, and how she was scared.<eos> What makes you sure it was Mona's camera?<eos> Because if her mother knew it was there, she would have told the police.
What am I doing here?<eos> Your family again? Ugh.<eos> Oncologist.<eos> Probably wants to schedule my surgery, chemo.<eos> Two-percent chance is better than nothing.<eos> I saw it during my residency countless times.<eos> Patients enduring round after round of poison pumped into their system so they can spend what days they have left by the toilet, puking and bald. Not me.<eos> I'm going out with a bang not a whimper.<eos> You believe in God, Frank?<eos> I believe in a force that thinks it's greater than myself.
All right, at this time, we will take a 15-minute recess.<eos> Hello, Mike.<eos> Bob.<eos> Are any of you interested in something other than a conspiracy theory?<eos> Some real, demonstrable evidence?<eos> A little bit of real lawyering?<eos> Those gloves are too small.<eos> Yes, Bob.<eos> I tried the glove on in there myself.<eos> It didn't fit.

- You don't consider them your own?<eos> It's late, Heather.<eos> I bring it up because they ground me.<eos> I don't know if you've felt this way since you got married, but... when I think about my kids and this hurricane...<eos> What if we didn't have the money and advantages we do?<eos> What if they were in harm's way?<eos> What if they needed help and didn't have it?<eos> Puts everything into perspective for me.<eos> This... campaign seems meaningless.<eos> It pales in comparison to their well-being.
Oil matches, scratches... It was definitely at the shooting.<eos> But Mr. lesick is saying the car was stolen earlier today and that he discovered it abandoned a few blocks away.<eos> Which he failed to report to the police.<eos> Well, the witness in watts who gave you the partial plates can't positively ID Mr. lesick as the driver.<eos> This isn't the weapon that was used in any of the shootings.<eos> You don't have his boots, gloves, clothes.<eos> He tested negative for gunpowder in the paraffin.<eos> What about the Nazi reading list?<eos> Found only in his trash.<eos> He claims it isn't his.
Medic up!<eos> Medic!<eos> Raven's mirror sites have slowed the traffic, but word has gotten out.<eos> Now that the target's lowered the trigger number, the bomb could blow up before midnight.<eos> Yeah, and still not closer to finding Dr. Frankenstein or his monster.<eos> Okay, he hits a movie theater here.<eos> Library in Paris.<eos> Café in Italy.<eos> I mean, it's like the target's trying to make his pattern look completely random.<eos> But it's not completely random.
You're gonna want to see this.<eos> Whoa.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now it's working.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> That was awesome.<eos> See, your C.I. gave us code hidden inside a firmware update that disengages the thermal switch of a printer.<eos> That switch regulates the temperature of an ink fuser, you know, keeping it from overheating.<eos> So now, when the paper loads, touching the blazing-hot fuser, it sparks, then the paper in the tray ignites, causing your printer to catch on fire.
I am trying to assist you in regaining enough insight that you realise that you require medication.<eos> What medication would you prescribe, Dr Du Maurier?<eos> I would prescribe exactly the medication Dr Lecter prescribed and you refused.<eos> You know, whatever this is, whatever this is, this is why Scientologists hate psychiatry.<eos> What do you think this is?<eos> Of course he would refer me to you!<eos> You're just as twisted as he is.<eos> You're walking down the street and you see a wounded bird in the grass.<eos> What's your first thought?<eos> It's vulnerable,
Extraordinary stuff.<eos> - A particularly good one.<eos> - It may be my favorite.<eos> I have seen a lot of hostility.<eos> But this was quantifiably bitchy.<eos> Do you think I am your nemesis?<eos> No.<eos> Nemesis?<eos> No. - You refuted my entire book.<eos> - It didn't hold up to scrutiny.
Well, then let's hope it's just enough to prevent you from going back in.<eos> Be careful what you wish for. - Mm-hm.<eos> Ladies, none of us should be under any illusion about the prospect of imminent war with Germany.<eos> If and when hostilities break out, there will be much to be done to ensure that our homes and families are protected from the trials and tribulations the war will inevitably bring.<eos> And it is for this reason that your committee proposes the Institute closes its doors until we can raise our flag again in a time of peace.<eos> It needn't be for long.<eos> The government assures us, if and when they begin, hostilities could be over by Christmas.<eos> Madam President.<eos> Few who lived through the last conflict will set much store by government assurances that any war against Germany will be over swiftly.<eos> Mrs Barden - - When war does begin, it will hurl us all into a period of great change.
- What are you looking at?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Why were you looking at my upper arm?<eos> - Don't worry about that, Katja.<eos> I didn't stare!<eos> I just looked at her real quick.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> - Was there something wrong with my arm?<eos> - I didn't stare!<eos> - Was it fat?
We should push IV tPA.<eos> If it's a clot, tPA will dissolve it, stop her paralysis.<eos> No, if it's a brain bleed, that'll kill her.<eos> Her father died of a sub-arachnoid hemorrhage.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - Got her. All right.<eos> - All right.<eos> But how can we tell without a head CT?<eos> Got to look at the body. The body will tell you what you need to know if you look in the right place.<eos> Spinal fluid... 'Cause it passes through the brain.
Not in the O.R.<eos> It's just bad juju, and it's distracting.<eos> Suction.<eos> There it is.<eos> There's our bleeder.<eos> The artery.<eos> - You see it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, that's the corona mortis, or the crown of death.<eos> It's an artery only 15% of patients have.
Hey.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> Where... where am I?<eos> You were in an accident.<eos> Can you tell me your name?<eos> - Joe... Joe Koller.<eos> - Okay, Joe, you stay with me.<eos> My name's Dr. Alexander, and Dr. Bell-Hart is driving us to the hospital.<eos> We're gonna give you something for your pain.<eos> Good. 'Cause it-it's killing me.
I need to give him a hug.<eos> I'd be feedin' the worms if he hadn't come along.<eos> Talking about T.C.<eos> Oh, boy, talk about cojones.<eos> He nearly gave up the ghost.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> - You know, died.<eos> This giant silver thingamabob, sharper than a spur,<eos> - it came down about this close to his neck.
Well, hello, San Antonio Memorial night shift.<eos> How are you guys doing?<eos> Well, I know you all are busy and about to stat your shift, but Jill and I wanted to personally thank you for everything you're doing to serve this community.<eos> Just from a show of hands, how many of you are veterans or married to veterans?<eos> Oh, great.<eos> Outstanding.<eos> A-and by the way, we heard from Smalls about the terrific work you're doing with our veterans.<eos> Let me tell you, we're grateful to you for encouraging your veteran patients and their families to go to Vet Centers.<eos> We're so glad that, if they need it, the San Antonio Veteran Community can get the free counseling and support they have earned.<eos> We're big believers in counseling and know how much it can help.
How lucky I am.<eos> I am here, Sir, on the king's business.<eos> You haven't responded to his invite.<eos> Did I not reply?<eos> How remiss.<eos> I've been indisposed.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> My apologies to His Majesty.<eos> I trust he will understand that I cannot come to his party. As joyful as I am at our glorious ceasefire.<eos> The gathering is a celebration, but it is also a memorial, an homage to those who died for this peace.
What are you doing?<eos> I couldn't wait for you, Julia.<eos> Why couldn't you wait for me?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Who's in that cocoon, Melanie?<eos> You'll see.<eos> You have faith in me,<eos> - don't you, Julia?<eos> - All I have ever wanted is to believe that the dome is here for a reason.<eos> But I can't keep ignoring the truth, not when it's staring me right in the eyes.
I did break your mug on purpose because I didn't want to see you sippin' chowder out of Shaquille O'neal's big head for the rest of my life!<eos> Your ex-boyfriend's Billy Ocean t-shirt - that you love so much?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I wash my tires with it!<eos> That was Gene Hackman at the Roller Rink.<eos> You think everyone is Gene Hackman!<eos> I know you spiked my drink at the sade concert.<eos> Well, I had to do something 'cause you were acting like a little bi-atch!<eos> Oh! Well, I might've lost a thumb drive with "footage" of us on it.<eos> It could be nowhere.
- Jammy Jam.<eos> - N-n-no!<eos> - Jammy Jam!<eos> - You stop it!<eos> I don't want to have an old-guy party.<eos> - You know what?<eos> - "Stop."<eos> - I'm gonna throw my own party.<eos> - What?<eos> And it's gonna be the coolest and the swaggiest!
I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> I hear it's Dre Johnson's birthday!<eos> - No.<eos> - No.<eos> Sorry, handbone.<eos> You're a mess.<eos> So, Operation Swag Back was in full effect.<eos> I was planning my big party, and it was testing off the charts.
You have a car.<eos> I mean, I don't know how you're able to drive the thing, but...<eos> Again, you're an idiot.<eos> It's not for me; it's for my nephew.<eos> My brother bought him a Camaro for his college graduation.<eos> But what Johnny's gonna wake up and see, parked in the driveway, wrapped in a big red bow, is... your car.<eos> It's gonna be hilarious;<eos> we're gonna record it.<eos> You still have that tiny little primer-gray piece of crap, right?<eos> You think my car's a piece of crap 'cause it's little?

I know what really happened to him that night.<eos> And I know how to save him.<eos> Tachyon output has passed acceptable tolerance range.<eos> Continued exposure is not recommended.<eos> - Increase to maximum, Gideon.<eos> - Increasing to maximum, Doctor.<eos> Speed Force absorption at 35% and rising.<eos> - I'm not stabilizing.<eos> I can't hang on to my speed.<eos> It comes and goes, and I can not control it.
Holy shit. That looks good.<eos> You gotta crack the eggs with one hand.<eos> - Can I try?<eos> - Oh, sure.<eos> Yeah, you...<eos> No. - No. - Heh-heh.<eos> Shit.<eos> We'll scramble that one.<eos> Yeah. That'll be all right.<eos> If Ian wants his job back when he gets out, it's here for him.
No. I won't let you out.<eos> Can't trust you.<eos> Look, there's plenty of food in this warehouse.<eos> There's enough for all of us.<eos> Food in here has kept us alive for three months.<eos> It's gonna need to keep us alive for a lot more.<eos> Us?<eos> All right, I'll bite.<eos> What's behind door number one, kid?<eos> He doesn't like it closed too long.
Something about a transplant.<eos> A heart's missing.<eos> Great.<eos> You know, I've been doing this for a long time, marriage counseling.<eos> And, uh... I got to say, this whole thing is very... unique.<eos> More to the point, I mean, it's brought up a lot of, uh, premarital concerns.<eos> It's a good thing.<eos> It's just, like I said before, we got to untangle them to find the real underlying issue.<eos> Okay.<eos> What is it?
See, and you didn't even need a marriage counselor.<eos> JT, the sample.<eos> Right, and, well, you were right.<eos> The-the donor was definitely enhanced.<eos> Same charged leukocytes as in... my blood.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, but she's not.<eos> I mean, I know she's dead, so not her her, but her heart.<eos> What about it?<eos> Well, whoever did this probably wanted to see how powerful the serum really is, see if it could supercharge even a sickly person.
I'm not scared.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, look, if you know me so well, where've you been, huh?<eos> Yeah, I'm scared.<eos> And yes, I'm mad.<eos> Not at you, I'm just...<eos> Just what?<eos> I don't know, mad at the gods, I guess.<eos> For doing this to me.<eos> I mean, look, the serum saved my life, but now it's teasing me with super cool powers and...
- He's disappeared.<eos> We think he may have been captured by S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Then in all likelihood, he's dead, too, if he did his duty.<eos> You underestimate S.H.I.E.L.D... constantly, it would seem.<eos> Von Strucker would like this mistake to stop happening, so I'm going to make it simple...<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. will take this victory - as a chance to move against us.<eos> - Come aboveground.<eos> Whomever can remove S.H.I.E.L.D. from the landscape permanently will win Whitehall's position.<eos> Does that sound fair?<eos> Meanwhile, I intend to find out if Whitehall's obsession with arcane artifacts was fruitless or if, indeed, it did produce something that we at HYDRA can use for our future.
I could spend a year down here answering these questions.<eos> Photograph it, mark it off, - and let's flood this cursed place.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> Quarantine survival kit.<eos> Got a deck of cards for solitaire, bag of homemade trail mix if you want to eat healthy, a couple candy bars if not, headphones, a few trashy magazines.<eos> Cactus cooler.<eos> I keep a stash.<eos> I mean, you can only get it in California... it's the best.
I will.<eos> Bye.<eos> How's your science experiment going?<eos> I told you, Leo, I'm only trying to help.<eos> Whatever, Jemma.<eos> It's not the first time you've taken a look under Lola's hood, is it?<eos> That toy car you gave me...<eos> It's a perfect replica.<eos> Well, almost perfect.<eos> It doesn't fly yet, sir, but I promise you I'm working on it.
Mack.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you, buddy.<eos> I would never hurt you.<eos> You know that.<eos> I just need you to trust me right now, please.<eos> When I was a kid, I had this coin collection, but one day, I-I couldn't find it.<eos> Got so mad, I punched the floor.<eos> And it felt good at the time.<eos> And then, a week later, my, uh... my hand turned black and blue.<eos> It was swollen out to here.
Just a minute!<eos> Geez, let a man think in peace.<eos> Hunter!<eos> How did you ring Coulson's tablet?<eos> Where... are you watching Mexican football?<eos> Uh, undisclosed secure location?<eos> Fitz?<eos> How did you open Fury's toolbox?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's safe.
I told him not to buy it.<eos> You're gonna love it!<eos> The experiments you can do.<eos> When your dad was a boy, he brought back a dead cat and cut it open on the dining-room table!<eos> - Did you kill it?<eos> - No! No, he was on his paper round - and it was just lying there.<eos> - Dad!<eos> And you picked it up?<eos> Well...<eos> I wanted to see how it worked.
- Yes. Yes, it does.<eos> Our daughter is probably still with SHIELD.<eos> Or did you forget that you dropped her off at their doorstep?<eos> - Cal, don't lose your head. - Oh, come off it.<eos> This little act ... it's so transparent.<eos> Now you're ... you're going to help "your people,"<eos> protect them with your "visions"?<eos> How do we know that you're not just making this stuff up?<eos> Everything she's seen has come true.<eos> This power that she has ... it lets her control you.
- Well, now my news sounds less good. - Oh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> The disrupter should keep him contained to a single space.<eos> I'll take anything.<eos> We have Quinjets flying in from all over the world right now to answer the S.O.S. with us.<eos> It will be nice to have something more to offer them than an encouraging thumbs-up.<eos> - What about Bobbi?<eos> - Landing any moment.<eos> Cal destroyed the lab.<eos> It's unusable right now.
Anonymous.<eos> That's the idea.<eos> But it's not if we do this.<eos> We have to do this.<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> It may feel like things have cooled down right now, but this...<eos> This is my permanent reminder... that we'll always be paying the price, that we'll never get ahead of the consequences that I, that you, that SHIELD have set in motion.<eos> - Like a ripple in the water.<eos> - But this ripple won't fade.<eos> It'll grow and grow until it's a tidal wave.
Sam: Well, he's the snitch.<eos> Einstein thinks he wrote a report that'll get him a gold star and a cookie.<eos> Bunchy, whatever you're thinking about having your people do to him in prison, don't.<eos> He's not skating.<eos> He'll do time.<eos> A colored man accused of murder always does time.<eos> Plus, he's a panther?<eos> That's life time's ten.<eos> Well, good then.<eos> The system's not perfect, but it can work. (Scoffs)
Come on, try it.<eos> No.<eos> I'm good.<eos> Emily.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> You're married, Talia.<eos> That's what's wrong.<eos> I saw your last name, Mendoza, and it's the same as your husband's.
I got something on our dead Russians.<eos> We just got this...<eos> Official report on the battle of Finow.<eos> Great.<eos> Only thing missing are words.<eos> Good, old U.S. Army Intelligence for you.<eos> Redacted by General John McGinnis.<eos> As luck would have it, he died a month ago.<eos> What did the lab rats say about your magic typewriter?<eos> They're claiming it sends signals back and forth.
Oh, call me Dottie.<eos> Return to your room, please.<eos> - What's in the vial?<eos> - Steve rogers' blood.<eos> - I trusted you, Howard!<eos> - I know, and I was wrong.<eos> Photographer got a shot of the blonde who was with Spider before he got killed,<eos> But not one clear shot of her face.<eos> What did the lab rats say about your magic typewriter?<eos> They're claiming it sends signals back and forth.
You think Fisk picked up distribution?<eos> Like I said, a lot of money.<eos> And I'm guessing tearing down Hell's Kitchen isn't cheap.<eos> Interrupting the cash flow may... slow him down.<eos> Doubt if it'll stop him.<eos> No... but it might knock him off balance.<eos> Get him mad, maybe enough to make a mistake big enough to matter.<eos> I got something I'm working on, might help push that bald prick over the edge.<eos> No, I want you to keep your head down, until this is over.<eos> My head's fine where it's at.
One of the greatest moments of my life.<eos> I read the story you handed me, the exact opposite.<eos> This could expose Fisk.<eos> All this story is gonna do is expose this paper to a lawsuit.<eos> I mean, there is no follow-up, no corroboration.<eos> You read what his mother said about what he did when he was a kid?<eos> She's a sick old lady.<eos> I mean, she probably thinks Nixon's still in office.<eos> Run the article.<eos> It'll sell papers, it's sexy.
- I'm gonna go check<eos> - the office. - The drums are gone?<eos> - Hey. Hey.<eos> Mom. - Hi.<eos> How is he?<eos> He's hanging in there, honey.<eos> How are you?<eos> What happened to the car?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> It just didn't start.
Because we're here for you.<eos> So don't ever hesitate to pick up the phone.<eos> Amber...<eos> Forget it.<eos> No matter what...<eos> I will always have your back.<eos> I know.<eos> Amber...<eos> I would say to you that life is short.<eos> You cannot know how impossibly fast it goes by.
Jon's handsome.<eos> Very.<eos> He's a bit older than you?<eos> Hm. He was previously married to a Chinese woman in Shanghai.<eos> - That explains the shoes.<eos> - She was very, very beautiful.<eos> But she couldn't have children, so that was no good.<eos> You have such a kind face.<eos> Maybe it's pregnancy.<eos> It softens you.
This is harder than you said it would be.<eos> Fold the corners.<eos> No.<eos> Fold, fold the corners.<eos> They're round.<eos> They do not fold.<eos> Anyone who can do this is a powerful witch.<eos> - Well, I can do it.<eos> - I rest my case.<eos> You know, if this sheet could talk, you know what it would say,
Forgive me, Prince Ryad.<eos> You may be dealing with a few hundred refugees, but we are facing mortar attacks.<eos> Fourteen in the last two weeks.<eos> None of your people have died yet.<eos> The last one came within 50 meters of a school.<eos> Your troops have killed over a dozen Palestinians in house raids.<eos> - You expect us not to fight back?<eos> - We need the violence to stop.<eos> If it continues, the peacekeeping mission will fall apart.<eos> And it's our best hope for long-term stability.
We will tackle that another time.<eos> Can you convey to Jerusalem the importance of this troop reduction?<eos> Yes, but no promises.<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> We'll meet again tomorrow morning.<eos> Thank you, madam.<eos> Eliana.<eos> We need to discuss the no-fly zone.<eos> It's only for the Russians, not the peacekeepers.
Fate has chosen you, Mr. Cole.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Let her show you.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> That is our salvation.<eos> The virus is not yet done with us, Mr. Cole.<eos> It will mutate again and again until not even the immune are left standing.<eos> There's only one way to end it.<eos> And you are the key.<eos> I want to send you back to stop the plague before it ever happens.
'We both know that.<eos> 'For this to work, 'we're going to need some more photographs.'<eos> Leave Megan out of this.<eos> 'Take one pill, or it gets tweeted... 'from your account.'<eos> 'Time's up.'<eos> No!<eos> 'Next.<eos> 'Your BFF again.'<eos> 'One more pill won't hurt you, Casey.<eos> 'But it might spare Megan some hate.
We wait them out, we could be here all night, then we're humping back in daylight.<eos> Listen, we get ambushed, we don't make it back at all.<eos> It's a fair point.<eos> You stay here. Wait them out.<eos> Cole.<eos> Cole!<eos> Asshole.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> The recording said Leland caused the plague.<eos> No, it says it started with Leland.
Elena wasn't blonde.<eos> Elena was a whole different thing, man.<eos> I know.<eos> I think you'd like Cassie, though.<eos> She reminds me of you... always waving her moral compass around.<eos> She waving yours?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks for asking.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Perimeter guards spotted a vehicle headed this way... couple of miles out, said it was packing some armor.
There we go.<eos> This is a bad idea.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> This thing falls in the wrong hands... brimstone, horsemen, zombies, crazy clowns, party's over.<eos> Oh, um, for... for who?<eos> For Markridge?<eos> For everyone.<eos> _<eos> Truly, for the last time, tell us how to find the Night Room.<eos> It's in Westminster, Maryland.
And you took a hit, and you never woke up.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Jones bailed me out.<eos> She knew my name from Cassie's message.<eos> I got free... Went back to the 7 camp, found Deacon.<eos> He didn't go down without a fight.<eos> Rallied the others, took this place back over.<eos> It's been good to us.<eos> I need to use the machine.<eos> If I fire this thing up, it's gonna drain us.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Maybe a plague is precisely what the world needs.<eos> The liars die out.<eos> The living forget the lies.<eos> Society's great reset switch.<eos> It won't reset anything.
And you've been so strong.<eos> But I am still your guardian, and it's my job to guard you, not just physically, but from heartache.<eos> I can't help but feeling like I just handed you a brand new burden.<eos> Yeah. But it's our burden, right?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Mm hmm. How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me?<eos> You would have had to have tested it specifically.<eos> Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?
How soon I let that happen, though, is entirely up to you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Last time I did this was to a gorilla.<eos> You're okay, man, we got you.<eos> What's happening to him?<eos> Nothing's happening to him.<eos> It's happening to Stein, and Ronnie is feeling his pain.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> The connection's not temporary.<eos> It's only getting stronger.
Thanks.<eos> - Okay, let's go.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Come back. All three of you.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh. This place definitely doesn't look too shady.<eos> Stein's inside.<eos> I can feel our connection growing stronger, like he's pulling me.<eos> It's as I feared-- the Firestorm matrix is building toward a proximity reemergence.<eos> Like all matter, it yearns to be whole.
- I am not leaving you.<eos> - Iris, please!<eos> Listen to me, ever since the night that you told me how you felt, I have not been able to stop thinking about you.<eos> At first, I was really mad, and then I realized that the reason that I couldn't stop thinking about you was because I didn't want to.<eos> I've never stopped thinking about you.<eos> Caitlin.<eos> Barry, I need to talk to you.<eos> Dr. Wells, he isn't... Hey, there's no time for that right now, all right?<eos> There is a tsunami heading for the city.<eos> How do I stop it? Theoretically, if you can create a vortex barrier along the coastline, a wall of wind, that would be able to sap the tidal wave of its energy before it hits the city.
Should we find ourselves in a jam, A cop's dad makes an excellent bargaining chip.<eos> Right.<eos> I wouldn't worry too much about what the cops might do to you.<eos> Really?<eos> If the police aren't able to find you, Trust me, The Flash will.<eos> Here's hoping.<eos> So what's next?<eos> In your last letter, you said you had something big In mind for when you got out.<eos> I've had 20 years to come up with the perfect trick.<eos> It's going to be my masterpiece.
Well, hello.<eos> You know, I've been in prison for 20 years.<eos> Then you'll know the routine when you get sent back.<eos> Where's Henry Allen?<eos> He's where you'll be soon.<eos> Heaven!<eos> Are you familiar with the movie speed?<eos> Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock?<eos> See, you're the bus, and that's the bomb.<eos> A Kinetic Bomb, actually, and if you go below 600 miles per hour, it'll explode.
Are you familiar with the movie speed?<eos> Keanu Reeves, Sandra Bullock?<eos> See, you're the bus, and that's the bomb.<eos> A Kinetic Bomb, actually, and if you go below 600 miles per hour, it'll explode.<eos> Same thing happens if you try to remove it.<eos> Ooh, it's active.<eos> Run, run, run, run, run.<eos> Cisco!<eos> He wasn't lying.<eos> That thing's linked to a speedometer, And it will blow if you stop moving.
I can't let you do that.<eos> Now I'm asking you, cop to cop, keep this under wraps. Forget you ever saw it.<eos> - West, I can't do that.<eos> - Listen, Lance, if this is who I think it is, anybody that knows about this is in a hell of a lot of danger, including my daughter.<eos> As mad as you are at Laurel, I can't imagine you wouldn't do anything to protect her.<eos> Hey. Good to go.<eos> Just need to give it a little spin.<eos> Right. Yes.<eos> A spin.<eos> So this, uh... serum that you're making, is it a temporary fix, or will it take away his power permanently?
I mean, the pipeline isn't exactly equipped to hold a super-intelligent, telepathic gorilla.<eos> Joe mentioned that Grodd called Wells "Father."<eos> And Wells must have ordered Grodd to come after us.<eos> It's why Grodd didn't kill Joe.<eos> I think Joe is right.<eos> Everything Grodd did, it was just to distract us.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Just thinking about this headset.<eos> It wasn't strong enough.
The American Ace motto is "Work is fun".<eos> Max was expecting a different kind of factory.<eos> More torture, less foosball.<eos> I know, right?<eos> Not at American Ace.<eos> And what is your position here, Peggy? Are you the "I know, right?" person?<eos> I know, right?<eos> No, I'm one of the owners.<eos> Also, I dye T-shirts.<eos> See, every employee gets a percentage of the company after six months, so the longer you stay, the more it grows.
Even if she does, it's not going to save the Dome of the Rock.<eos> Why?<eos> Because they dug through the tunnels to the Well of Souls.<eos> It's sandstone.<eos> The water would go straight in there.<eos> Everything would crumble.<eos> Warren's shaft.<eos> There's a shaft.<eos> Uh, Margrove showed me this morning.<eos> It's 2 feet behind stone.
She was wearing Pippa's pendant.<eos> You go about your life thinking you're complete, then you meet someone and realise you're only half of something.<eos> People laugh about it.<eos> 'Have you met my other half? '<eos> Then when you meet that person... .. you know it's true.<eos> You're only really whole when you're with each other.<eos> Never ends well, does it?<eos> ~ What doesn't?<eos> ~ Love.<eos> It makes you strong and... .. then it pulls you down.
It was mine.<eos> My gran gave it to me.<eos> Why did Pippa Gillespie have it?<eos> Why did you burn the photograph?<eos> Do you know, I am...<eos> I am sick and tired of my life being defined by this, Ellie.<eos> I keep being dragged into something I had nothing to do with.<eos> Why do you still keep secrets from us?<eos> ~ The truth doesn't help.<eos> ~ It gives peace to the families involved.
And it's not his brother's ghost. Right,<eos> I mean, the guy was wounded.<eos> So he had to lay low.<eos> Somebody's been hiding him.<eos> Mm-hmm. He also doesn't have any access to his bank accounts, so... somebody has to be supporting him.<eos> Larson says that it's Winthrop's father, Collin.<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> All right, I'm going to follow up on both of them.<eos> You were right about the rope from the crime scene.<eos> It's unusual.
I'm looking for a list of test-animal suppliers, but my expertise is in clinical virology, not zoonosis.<eos> Right, so the best test subjects?<eos> Macaques.<eos> Monkeys... of course.<eos> _<eos> Your condition is worsening.<eos> The splinter process has deteriorated your body further than I anticipated.<eos> What is that thing?<eos> It's a reconditioning system for molecular stabilization.<eos> It won't reverse the damage, but it will keep you together a while longer.
Ronnie, I love you, but this is a time machine, not a bookcase from IKEA.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> These tiles...<eos> They're made of tungsten.<eos> Well, tungsten does have the highest melting point of any other element.<eos> Yeah, but the dust it generates is flammable.<eos> The pressure exerted from the wormhole...<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> It could cause a hole to be melted into the exterior.<eos> It could explode.
That's all I ever wanted to be.<eos> Your hero.<eos> No!<eos> I've controlled your life for so long, Barry.<eos> How will you get along without me?<eos> Guys, that's not good.<eos> Professor, I shut down the wormhole.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You did close it, but it seems to be reopening.
Did your parents know your every move when you were my age?<eos> Marty: Definitely not.<eos> Roscoe: You did what you wanted.<eos> I want you to be happy.<eos> But you're not happy.<eos> Dad, you're having another kid.<eos> You don't even acknowledge it.<eos> Marty: Because 150 years from now, your company is not going to be smaller.<eos> No.<eos> It's going to be bigger.
Yeah.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> We need to get him to the showcase, Dad.<eos> The way to appeal to him is through family-- he's a real family guy, right?<eos> The reason he's coming to dinner with us tonight is because his daughter roomed with Rhonda at Wharton.<eos> Well, Empire is family.<eos> I mean, that's what we're selling. Family is the whole showcase.<eos> Then like I said, Lucious, you got a problem.<eos> Jamal and Hakeem-- they can't stand to be in the same room together, let alone on the same stage.<eos> Look... (chuckles) this beef they got between each other, it ain't dying.
When I heard the noise, I call out for him, but he didn't answer.<eos> Go get me my pink robe from the bedroom.<eos> How long have you been on the floor?<eos> Just a few minutes.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Don't make a fuss about it.<eos> I never fall.<eos> And if I was fully recovered, I'll get up on my own.<eos> Where's your jewelry box?<eos> Isn't it on my dresser?
I had to get her pills!<eos> What are you doing with my mom's ATM card?<eos> She doesn't have a driver's license.<eos> The drugstore needs an I.D. I didn't use it.<eos> You're stealing from her, too, huh?<eos> Why is her jewelry box missing?<eos> I didn't take anything.<eos> No!<eos> Julio!<eos> - Where is it?

She's fine, sir.<eos> A couple of bruised ribs.<eos> She's already back home.<eos> And doctor said her back surgery last month is healing well.<eos> I got a neighbor to sit with her.<eos> Did you find the jewelry box?<eos> Uh, no, no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It wasn't there.<eos> Did Tino tell you where it was?
Take him in.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Scream - S01E09 The Dance<eos> Hey, guys. It's Piper Shaw, with a special Halloween podcast of Autopsy of a Crime.<eos> So, in looking for a connection between the Lakewood murders past and present, I had to wonder about Brandon's mask.<eos> Turns out, it disappeared from county evidence last year, but was never reported.
What's our final destination?<eos> I've traced the truck to these new coordinates to what looks like a small town upstate.<eos> We're late.<eos> 66 hours.<eos> A rescue's overdue.<eos> Sameen's gonna kill us.<eos> Well, she can't fault us for lack of effort.<eos> You've caused mayhem over five states.<eos> And we only have one clue to show for it. One clue is plenty.<eos> It narrows focus.
It wants to study us on an electrochemical level.<eos> They're gonna stick one of these in Shaw.<eos> We really are just pets to it.<eos> Pets don't carry guns.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please, don't shoot.<eos> Look.<eos> Sameen?<eos> John, Samantha.<eos> The blood from the truck-- the test came back-- it isn't Sameen's.
Well, stop acting like my daddy.<eos> You're a kid.<eos> Enjoy it.<eos> No need to take over the goddamn world with your ambition.<eos> I don't even know how you're thinking on this scale.<eos> What am I, stupid?<eos> Look around.<eos> Five years, not even, it'll be legal across the land.<eos> Oh, don't give me that bullshit.<eos> You're gonna sell dope whether it's legal or not.
You've killed more people as an afterthought.<eos> - I've never killed anyone.<eos> - You use your powers to compel murder.<eos> Oh, tomato, to-mato.<eos> What matters is you saved my life.<eos> You do care for me.<eos> I just can't handle another death on my conscience.<eos> Even if it's yours.<eos> You'd know the feeling if you had a conscience.<eos> I have a conscience. It's... just more selective.
Someone you trust.<eos> Trish!<eos> - Stop that.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - I have to put a bullet in my head.<eos> - No.<eos> Put it in my head.<eos> - Stop.<eos> Ow! Jesus!<eos> It has to be in my head.
They liked him.<eos> He's probably looking down on me now... so goddamn disappointed.<eos> It's unacceptable!<eos> She was a few feet away from me.<eos> If she'd seen me, that's it, it's all over.<eos> I don't think you realize how vulnerable I was, how helpless.<eos> We've made progress.<eos> Longer times, longer distances.<eos> Thought you said this godforsaken slime was gonna expedite the process.<eos> It has.
Yeah, and I brought you some cookies.<eos> Well, the rest of the guys are upstairs. Um...<eos> Good because I just really came to see you.<eos> So tell me the truth.<eos> Girls throw themselves at firemen, don't they?<eos> Shamelessly, but, uh, none are as pretty as you.<eos> Got her eye on this fancy new crib.<eos> Thing's like the Taj Mahal.<eos> Told her what's wrong with the crib we got?<eos> It worked fine for the first 3.
To Smart Rain.<eos> To Smart Rain.<eos> Do you mind if I record this?<eos> Um... no, no.<eos> So it was a really nice party your company held today.<eos> Uh, thank you. Thanks.<eos> Yeah, Smart Rain's been in development for... for seven years, so...<eos> It's by far the biggest project we've ever done.<eos> And the company...<eos> It started as a-a family business, is that right?
- Joshua.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Christopher was our healer.<eos> He saved me.<eos> More than once.<eos> What about you?<eos> I was drawn here by a vision.<eos> - To this grave.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was in the desert, and there was some sort of bomb blast.
I know.<eos> I'm practically a doctor.<eos> But you're not.<eos> I am a doctor, and I have a lot of experience with sprains and breaks.<eos> No offense, but it's more like you drain fluid from their butt sacks.<eos> Uh, none taken, but I work several species.<eos> None of which are human.<eos> Look, the truth about cats and dogs is...<eos> So is the ambulance coming soon?<eos> Yep, it's on its way.
It looks so good.<eos> Now, look, you are amazing, all right?<eos> You can do this.<eos> You can walk out of here a commissioned artist earning $20,000, minus my 40%.<eos> You just got to dance the dance a little.<eos> Hey, for $20,000, I'll dance in a G-string and pasties.<eos> Actually, I have, and for much less.<eos> - We should revisit that subject. - Okay.<eos> Your work has such fascinating complexity.<eos> Yes, it is lousy with fascinating complexity, isn't it?
I harvested his memories and they still bring me happiness.<eos> This is one my favorite of his memories and I cannot explain why.<eos> He is descending a staircase and sees a large plant blowing in the wind.<eos> Flopping its fronds together in a sort of plant applause.<eos> I have viewed this memory over 6,000 times.<eos> You missed him.<eos> I do not have the mental or emotional capacity to deal with his loss.<eos> But sometimes, I sit in a chair late at night and quietly feel very bad.<eos> When the night is at its most quiet, I can hear death.<eos> I am very proud of my sadness because it means I am more alive.
Guv, why don't we bring them in and shout at them for a bit?<eos> She's as hard as nails but he's not.<eos> ~ He's not that clever either.<eos> ~ Doesn't have to be.<eos> We'll have him in for questioning, he'll bring a lawyer...<eos> Well, then, we'll just have to be cleverer than them.<eos> Trust me, guv, I'm an Inspector.<eos> Not yet you're not.<eos> Silvexpo has no responsibility for Dennigs!<eos> Look, no parent company has any responsibility for the actions of the firms it takes over.
That's very good.<eos> Did uniforms get that?<eos> ~ No, they didn't.<eos> I did. ~ All right.<eos> It was a joke.<eos> I walked the route.<eos> All bloody night.<eos> I found blue paint on a traffic island.<eos> No sign of the car, though.<eos> It's not going to get very far, is it, two flat tyres?
Uh-uh.<eos> No. No?<eos> Hey, guys, does that bag belong to any of you?<eos> No. Uh-uh.<eos> Sir, did you forget your bag over here?<eos> It's not mine.<eos> Did you guys forget... Okay.<eos> Excuse me, anybody with this bag?<eos> This bag belong to anyone?<eos> It ticking.
It's not a party without him, is it?<eos> I don't do it.<eos> Honey, I'm not asking.<eos> Say whatever you need to to get him home.<eos> Give us away, and he'll get your face in the mail, got it?<eos> It's me.<eos> I'm sorry to do this.<eos> I just got a migraine.<eos> Can you come home?<eos> I know, but it's really bad.
All right.<eos> Well, don't forget to eat something, all right?<eos> You want to remind me to go to the toilet, too?<eos> Professor, I was... wondering, what do you hope to find in these books?<eos> Something I overlooked. Of all the evils a man faces, growing old is the one I cannot do anything about.<eos> When I was young, I could hold all this in my head, and now it seems to be slipping away from me.<eos> Somewhere in here, there, there, there must be a clue.<eos> - A clue to what?<eos> - An ancient book.<eos> If I can find it... it may tell me how to destroy the Master.
Artifacts from the war.<eos> So... come with me.<eos> I'm certain you'll find something of interest in here.<eos> Mein Kampf.<eos> A first edition, personally autographed by Adolf Hitler.<eos> Oh, now that is Mayan.<eos> They believed that the skull could bring forth the beast from the abyss.<eos> It is part of the personal collection of Heinrich Himmler.<eos> Tell me about that cane.<eos> Magnificent, isn't it?
Just a wild guess, but...<eos> So you couldn't find anything about that lost book, huh?<eos> What?<eos> Well, you've done it.<eos> Now we need to discuss our next project.<eos> Now, this is reputed to be an image from the Occido Lumen.<eos> Have you heard of it?<eos> It's an ancient book said to offer an account of the exact nature and origin of the strigoi, and perhaps even the key to<eos> - their destruction.<eos> - If it exists.
Means he doesn't have it, which means we still have a chance of finding it.<eos> Not the kind of odds I'd want to play in Vegas.<eos> The odds have been against me from day one and yet I'm still in the game.<eos> You're late.<eos> Herr Standartenflihrer, I must get away.<eos> - I've been identified.<eos> - By who?<eos> A former inmate.<eos> Do you have the money?<eos> The cane, where is it?
Leo, you're up.<eos> When I first met April, I had a death sentence that I accepted, because it was easier than trying to fight.<eos> But then I spent some time with April Carver...<eos> And... every day she finds new ways to show me how... Special and important...<eos> And absolutely mind-blowing life can be.<eos> Why would I not want to spend the rest of my life with the person who taught me why it was worth fighting for?<eos> I love adventures.<eos> And I can't think of a better one... Than life with you.<eos> I'm so happy the wedding's in this room.<eos> It's in this very place that I tried to hide from my fears.
- Hi!<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hey, April's having dinner with us.<eos> Great.<eos> So how was support group?<eos> It was a waste of time.<eos> Just felt like people were sitting around, spouting off things they wrote on motivational posters.<eos> That's a shame.<eos> Well, you know, maybe you should try group therapy.<eos> It's a little different from support group.
I'm sorry, could you just... Could you just turn it down?<eos> Oh!<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.<eos> I'm sorry, is that annoying?<eos> No, not at all.<eos> - Okay, you know what?<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - That's it.<eos> - I haven't made any progress, and if I want to bring it to someone...<eos> This apartment has been fine for me, but it obviously doesn't work for the two of us, so it's not just a new system we need.
It's not us applying for some damn driver's license.<eos> We're getting married, okay?<eos> It shouldn't be some stupid ruse.<eos> I don't understand why you're acting this way.<eos> Exactly. Exactly.<eos> You don't. You don't understand.<eos> You know, that in there, that may be enough for you, but that's not enough for me, okay?<eos> I want us to remember our wedding day just like my parents did.<eos> You know, the whole time I was growing up, that's all they ever spoke about, you know, their wedding, like it was something magical.<eos> And I know it's corny, it is, but I want it to be magical for us, too.
JT, you tried to run away from your detail.<eos> I couldn't let them follow me, okay?<eos> I had to ditch them because I think I might have found the lab behind all the experiments.<eos> So what, you can't pick up a phone and call me?<eos> You would've let me go?<eos> To check out the lab by yourself, no.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Tess, you don't understand.<eos> This-this could be everything.<eos> If this lab's what I think it is, it can lead us right to whoever's behind it all.
We've been robbed!<eos> There.<eos> The Tang Dynasty horse.<eos> See?<eos> It was right there!
You don't have a Henry.<eos> No offense, doc, but I don't have you.<eos> Well said.<eos> Let's go get him.<eos> Doc...<eos> Yes, guns and badges only.<eos> I know.<eos> Nice work.<eos> Let's take my car.<eos> It's very fast.
Yeah, I know. I called, too.<eos> [Chuckles, breathes deeply] Wonder what that guy does to keep himself busy.<eos> [Classical music plays] Abe: Trap finally got one, huh?<eos> No, actually.<eos> My initial examination suggests another cause.<eos> Henry, when are you thinking about going back to work?<eos> You see, the rat is incredibly thin.<eos> It was likely hungry, so it climbed up the length of the chimney.<eos> There are soot marks on its feet...<eos> Where it slipped and fell and broke several bones and then... crawled into the trap.
Think what?<eos> That if he hadn't been part of it, then, somehow, he'd still be alive.<eos> I just wish I could have kept him safe.<eos> That's a father's job.<eos> Right?<eos> Abigail: Henry.<eos> Man: Just inside the border of North Vietnam, - was struck today by U.S...<eos> - What is it, Abigail?<eos> [Radio chatter continues] A draft letter.<eos> It came.
More importantly, whatever he was struck with must have been extremely heavy.<eos> Looks as if it left an imprint on his skull.<eos> Tell me that is not...<eos> A swastika.<eos> What kind of murder weapon leaves that on a body?<eos> During the third Reich, the Nazis became obsessive about marking everything they came into contact with as property of the state, especially items of value.<eos> This statue is the murder weapon.<eos> What's more, it isn't a fake.<eos> It's the actual Andolini Venus, stolen by the Nazis in 1940 as they marched on Paris.<eos> So what the hell is it doing in this guy's apartment?
Better, too, to the untrained eye.<eos> Yeah, it's the center of my whole exhibition.<eos> I was just getting ready to ship it to the gallery.<eos> So you made this?<eos> That's right.<eos> Are you sure about that?<eos> You sure you don't want lawyer?<eos> No need.<eos> I stole the painting.<eos> It belonged to my grandfather.
This is what he found.<eos> Looks like he died in his sleep.<eos> Could be heart problems.<eos> Lucas, think.<eos> Burst capillaries and pink froth in the airway.<eos> Ah -- asphyxiation.<eos> Of course.<eos> No ligature marks or contusions at the neck.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> There's a small scratch on his forehead, But it healed well before the time of death.
The detective was looking for it, and she wouldn't leave you alone.<eos> I knew if I put it back, she'd stop.<eos> And the jacket... how'd it get back to Jess?<eos> When I ran out of the woods, I realized there was blood on it.<eos> So, I hid it behind Matt's house.<eos> I didn't think anyone would find it.<eos> But then...<eos> You followed me when I went after Matt and took the jacket.<eos> I mean, I'm the one who took it, so I knew I had to give it back.<eos> It was dirty, so I put it in the sink.
And so I didn't.<eos> That's every detail.<eos> Wow.<eos> Tell it again.<eos> I knocked up a cocktail waitress when I was 23.<eos> She had the kid but said I couldn't see him because I was an irresponsible douche bag.<eos> Love that part.<eos> So I always wanted a cat, but it turned out that my father was allergic to cats.<eos> So they got me a turtle instead.<eos> But then it turned out that the turtle was allergic to my father, and it died. Weird, right?
A demon?<eos> It's not an entity.<eos> It's dark matter.<eos> I'd almost rather a garden-variety demon.<eos> Look, do us a favor.<eos> Go back to the Mill House.<eos> Have a look through Jasper's archives.<eos> He did a lot of research on the matter.<eos> You'll check on Zed, right?<eos> Oh, I need to suss out what kind of dark matter this is, whether it came in on the back of this bird and where it's lurking now.
Listen.<eos> Do you know why I don't stay<eos> - in a human body for very long? - All that messy blood, coursing through your veins, all those feelings and urges...<eos> You probably need a nice shower in heavenly light - afterwards, don't you?<eos> - John... when I am in a body I lose contact with the heavenly host, its vast stores of knowledge, and, more importantly, all of my angelic powers.<eos> Well, it's not like you were using them anyway, is it, chief?<eos> Again.<eos> What?<eos> Another sign of dark matter.<eos> It interferes with illumination.
Layout is almost an exact match of the diagram Irina drew for us.<eos> Who is it?<eos> What was that for?<eos> Natalie.<eos> You may actually be crazier than she is.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think?<eos> We got no witnesses, we haven't found any evidence, blood or anything else suggesting a body.<eos> Where's your radiography unit?<eos> Uh, it's on the truck.
Two weeks ago, we accidentally erased one-third of Intersite's entire library.<eos> I think we've established our ineptitude beyond a reasonable doubt.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> I say we delete everything.<eos> No. No. No.<eos> Isn't that the whole reason why you got into this in the first place, to build cool shit?<eos> We don't destroy things.<eos> Not on purpose, anyway. Right?<eos> I mean, look at that livestream.<eos> It's fucking perfect.

Right?<eos> I mean, look at that livestream.<eos> It's fucking perfect.<eos> And even if Hooli ends up owning it, we built it with no resources and a fucking stream of endless obstacles.<eos> I don't know, I mean, I kind of want to see how big it can get, right up until the point where Gavin Belson has to fucking take it from us.
It's magical.<eos> The only thing magical is how much this house has appreciated in the last three years, Jared.<eos> I'm selling.<eos> That's just money.<eos> It has no real value.<eos> It literally defines value.<eos> Look at this check.<eos> You can't actually cash it, but think about what it represents.<eos> It's priceless.<eos> Jared, I saw your entire HR file. It was in the Hooli disclosure.
Where's Milt?<eos> He's upstairs.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Maybe he wants to hear your line of thinking.<eos> Maybe you just want to stare at his ass.<eos> I'm not getting Milt until I know I'm right.<eos> You're definitely right.<eos> Time to get Milt.<eos> You haven't heard the rest of my theory.<eos> I'm sure it's brilliant.
Please help me save him.<eos> How long was I asleep?<eos> You've been in and out of it for the last few days.<eos> I wouldn't exactly call what you were doing sleeping.<eos> I've seen boxing matches that look more restful.<eos> Yeah, well, where I come from, sleep's dangerous.<eos> It's when you're at your most vulnerable.<eos> But you survived.<eos> That's something.<eos> Maybe now that we know that the plague is coming, how it happens, where, we can prepare, work to survive it.
Is giving up.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> - Yeah, just trying to...<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I just thought I'd be there for him.<eos> Always.<eos> This plague...<eos> it'll get me for sure?
Ramse.<eos> You ever meet a man named Ramse?<eos> Mm-mm. All right, how do we find them?<eos> Markridge.<eos> The woman's one of their key investors.<eos> They'll kill me for this... and then him... and then you.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> It makes sense that they'd finance the company that creates the plague.<eos> We need to find this investor.<eos> It could be the one key we've been missing.
You do?<eos> Assad is still in power.<eos> ISIL is still growing.<eos> Are we really getting anywhere in Syria?<eos> I just said yes.<eos> You said a program should be renewed.<eos> I'm asking, is our strategy working?<eos> What strategy?<eos> Tell me what the strategy is.<eos> I'll tell you if it's working.
We must keep to our agreed plan.<eos> We must stand together upon it.<eos> It is more important now than ever it was.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> May I speak frankly, sir?<eos> You've heard whispers of it, I'm sure.<eos> But when I was in the Peninsula, after the loss of your books - for which I am very sorry -<eos> I performed magic which... you might not have considered respectable.<eos> Magic of older times.<eos> I'm not proud of it, sir, but often, sir, it worked.

But surely it is precisely BECAUSE it is only half-understood that we MUST!<eos> If there exists a magic beyond the magic that we do...<eos> Then we let it alone.<eos> We must say that modern magic is the only way, or we will end up beggars in yellow-curtained tents!<eos> This other magic, it will not do, sir.<eos> It will not do.<eos> Have you read the proof of Mr Lascelles' book yet?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> It is a very fine book.<eos> It is my hope that it will establish Norrellite magic for the modern age.
"Afraid it will take us to places we never intended to go."<eos> We must not let this stand.<eos> You must not!<eos> Do you really think the Raven King cares what happens to England?<eos> He does not.<eos> He abandoned us.<eos> Abandoned his throne, rode out of England, and took the best part of English magic with him.<eos> Surely that is enough to mark him out as our enemy?<eos> His magic is not gone now.<eos> There it is, hidden behind our mirrors.

-And almost took a primrose.<eos> A primrose?<eos> I hate this time of year.<eos> Spring.<eos> Send more goblins to cut down every primrose.<eos> No primroses, no potion.<eos> No potion, no love.<eos> Because love is dangerous.<eos> It weakens, it rots.<eos> It destroys order.
- Daphne: Come on!<eos> (Team 2b cheering)<eos> Yeah!<eos> Ha!<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> Well, I guess you guys win. Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So that's what your smile looks like.<eos> Knew it had to be in there somewhere.
To what do I owe this gift?<eos> Oh. Rest assured, boy, I mean your master no ill will.<eos> In fact, I come to congratulate him upon his recent most deserved appointment as general of the Continental Army.<eos> Major, what is it you want?<eos> I come to offer my service to America.<eos> I cannot endorse your methods.<eos> No, no, no, no, George.<eos> The same beast in me dwells in you, George.<eos> All your battles lost, all the men you ever led to slaughter, all because you deny that feral nature.<eos> Unleash it or it will devour you and your boys will pay the price.
He did the job for me at Como Avenue, brought the stuff back to me and I paid him.<eos> That was the last time I saw him.<eos> Your birthmark, you had it removed.<eos> Dr Harcourt helped me out... .. a favour for a favour.<eos> He gave me a new face, and I was happy to look after his van.<eos> We've been so blind.<eos> Ned has confessed to stabbing Badger but not to burying him.<eos> He was bleeding but very much alive when Ned left him, which begs a very large question.<eos> Mac, do you mind taking another look at the wound for me?<eos> How lethal does it look?
No, I don't think so.<eos> I'm pretty sure she's just yelling,<eos> "I'm a fucking dude, I'm a fucking du...<eos> Wake up everybody and check out my mohawk!"<eos> Ok, I'm sectioning off this bit of the cast.<eos> This is my bit, Ok?<eos> Everyone else can be boring in their section, but this is mine.<eos> I own it, Ok?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's yours.
-Josh is inviting a boy over for casual sex.<eos> -Really?<eos> Well, that is interesting.<eos> But also, who wants to smash a piñata?<eos> -You made a piñata?<eos> -Yeah, I made a beautiful piñata.<eos> -Why'd you make a piñata?<eos> -What? What do you mean "why"?<eos> -I mean, why did you make a piñata?<eos> Would you ask a bird why it sings?
-You're not excited!<eos> -I just need a moment<eos> To get my head around it, okay? It's a bit of a shock.<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Okay!<eos> Yeah, I'm excited!<eos> -Claire, are you excited about the piñata?<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> It is full of secrets.
For example, before, he took the blame For me dropping the gravy.<eos> oh, no.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Whoa! So, there was gravy?<eos> -Yeah, there-- there was, but I dropped it.<eos> -You dropped the gravy?<eos> -Yeah, I dropped the gravy. -Oh, my god.<eos> He just keeps saying it out loud. -What? It's just gravy.<eos> Arnold, now you're just being antagonistic.<eos> -Arnold, the thing you need to know about gravy is that it's just so good.
Sacrifice?<eos> What do you know of sacrifice?<eos> Remember, George, my wife did not come from means.<eos> All she left to me were three sons to care for, three mouths to feed, three men to raise strong.<eos> I would rather die before I see shame brought on them as my father did me.<eos> Something you would understand if you had any sons of your own.<eos> And who are you fighting now?<eos> I'm fighting for what I deserve.<eos> And I will need your support.<eos> Yes, and it has always been there.
Okay.<eos> Hope your hand feels better.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This better be good.<eos> Where are my clothes?<eos> I'm going now.<eos> I don't want to see you... again.<eos> It... it can't be gone.<eos> I kept it for her for so long.<eos> It's in my jacket pocket.
- It's over.<eos> - It's not...<eos> The only way for this to be over is for me to leave, because you just keep stringing me along, Lucious,<eos> - and I... I'm tired.<eos> - Baby, baby, baby, stop!<eos> With everything...<eos> Stop.<eos> This is not even me! I am not a treacherous person, Lucious, but you...<eos> You...<eos> You have twisted my love and made it some awful thing.
Everything's gonna be ok, Dad.<eos> It's all gonna work out.<eos> Timmy: Mommy?<eos> Ok, so the 911 call on Victor Hall's murder came in at 10:37 a.m., police were on the scene at 10:42, only moments after the shooting.<eos> So the killer himself made the call.<eos> He alerted the police before shooting Victor.<eos> It's like he was leaving open the chance for rescue, the way he did with Betty Wright.<eos> He's being careful.<eos> The call came from a disposable cell phone so it couldn't be traced.<eos> Hotch also said he was careful to place the bullet so it penetrated the skull at an angle.
Come on, sweetie.<eos> I'll sort it, trust me!<eos> How will you do that?<eos> - I'll build a raft.<eos> - What?<eos> I'll build a raft.<eos> I'm not a loser.<eos> What is he building?<eos> Your children aren't aggressive because they want to be, but because they have to be.<eos> Aggression is a survival instinct, but it needs to be steered, brought under control.
You think he's coming back.<eos> I know he is.<eos> How are you so sure?<eos> He raised others from death.<eos> This is what was prophesied.<eos> And he promised.<eos> Then why not himself?<eos> High priest. Ah.<eos> I want you to post temple guards at Arimathea's tomb.<eos> It must remain sealed.
This man walks with this "Son of God"!<eos> I do not!<eos> I don't know him!<eos> I would like to offer my own tomb as your son's final place of rest.<eos> He was killed for the repeated blasphemy of claiming to be the Messiah.<eos> And if he was?<eos> Once the Romans realize your message remains a threat, they will root you out.<eos> The Nazarene was only ever flesh and blood.<eos> I want you to post temple guards at Arimathea's tomb.<eos> It must remain sealed.
What a relief, to be finally leaving this damned hole.<eos> I've earned my time away from this place like never before.<eos> I'll be packed by midday.<eos> Please, no longer.<eos> I can't wait for the Mediterranean winds to blow away the last traces of your nightmares and apparitions.<eos> My dream was clear.<eos> The man you crucified was favored by the gods.<eos> We shall all suffer for his execution.<eos> We really need to get you back to civilization.<eos> It's empty.
You heard?<eos> She suspects.<eos> She's in mourning.<eos> She's looking for reasons.<eos> That's all.<eos> Six men... six priests murdered by our Roman master!<eos> You know why Pilate did this.<eos> He had to remove all witnesses to that night...<eos> To ensure that the ridiculous story of the resurrection garners no credence amongst the gullible.<eos> It dies along with the soldiers and the temple guards, as it should.
Unfortunately, it's too late, they gave up your spot.<eos> Yeah, I figured.<eos> However, when I explained to them why you didn't jump at the scholarship...<eos> Wait, you told them?<eos> Now they'll never consider me.<eos> That's not true.<eos> They said they'd make another spot for you.<eos> If you audition.<eos> You said you played the Bach prelude perfectly.<eos> No, it wasn't perfect.

- Don't.<eos> - Callie!<eos> [Stef] Really?<eos> Wow, dance team just got a lot more interesting.<eos> Can I please come to your rehearsals?<eos> Can we talk about Timothy?<eos> Oh, sweetheart, why don't we just wait for the school assembly for that.<eos> I don't mind.<eos> I don't know if he got fired because he made us read that article on education reform, but I found it very informative.<eos> It laid out both sides of the debate and if the point of Common Core is to make us deeper thinkers, then Timothy should be like... on their poster.
Not sure.<eos> But we can rule out a cell phone as the detonator.<eos> Won't find a mini-gear in those. Nope.<eos> I'm leaning towards a timer mechanism, but, bad news-- I still don't have enough to definitively identify the detonation device.<eos> That leaves us with the gross news.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, that white crystallized substance you found is actually uric acid crystals.<eos> See, birds and reptiles, they don't, uh, go number one... in a mammalian sense.<eos> They excrete uric acid.<eos> When uric acid is heated past its boiling point, it crystallizes.
We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the Machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
I knew David Elster.<eos> A simulation would be of no interest.<eos> His goal was to create machine life, as he called it.<eos> Oh, so they're alive now?<eos> No.<eos> A parody of it, which is why they are so dangerous.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> They're just freaks.<eos> Do you know what the singularity is?<eos> A mathematician named John von Neumann coined the term in the 1950s to describe the inevitable point in the future when technology surpasses us, when it becomes able to improve and reproduce itself without our help.
You'd walk over your own dead mother's body to get ahead.<eos> So don't you talk to me about my brother.<eos> You never worked for a damn thing in your life.<eos> Your family may own half of Pretty Lake, you don't own this piece of it.<eos> So stop taking the law into your own hands and get the hell out of here.<eos> Unless, of course, you wanna pay the price.<eos> I'm not the law.<eos> I never pretended to be.<eos> But it's not right what he did and you know it.<eos> You wouldn't know the difference between right and wrong if it sat on your rich face.
Besides, Ronnie told me they only got caught because of a tracker and no one can track us with communications down.<eos> It's about time we started to enjoy ourselves.<eos> Get in the car.<eos> That idiot's gonna kill someone.<eos> That's one of the cars from the Lotts' dealership.<eos> Sweet car.<eos> How fast do you think it goes?<eos> Excellent question.<eos> There's really only one way to find out.<eos> You wouldn't know the difference between right and wrong if it sat on your rich face.
It's not over, Gord.<eos> They lied to us!<eos> You're a Lotts.<eos> Make us proud, son.<eos> Hey.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh, uh... yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - There was just a stray dog.<eos> I think it was more scared of me than I was of it.
They're always hiding something.<eos> If anyone's hiding anything, it's me, not Tom.<eos> OK.<eos> Spill.<eos> I shouldn't have said anything.<eos> It's OK.<eos> So you're sure this is where you found the body?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Hey, what does that thing do?<eos> Uh, it gives us an idea whether anything else might be buried down here.
Fuck.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought you said that you were considering it.<eos> I did.<eos> I thought long and hard about it.<eos> It just...<eos> I don't know, it just didn't feel right to me anymore.<eos> And so you wanna go with this ending instead?<eos> I think it's really powerful.
I did.<eos> I thought long and hard about it.<eos> It just...<eos> I don't know, it just didn't feel right to me anymore.<eos> And so you wanna go with this ending instead?<eos> I think it's really powerful.<eos> Well, what can I tell you?<eos> I don't agree.<eos> Oh, come on, Harry.<eos> It's much subtler.
Notgonnahappen.<eos> You're going to Stanford.<eos> You're getting an education.<eos> Come on.<eos> I do this crap so you won't have to.<eos> This crap?<eos> Yeah, look at where we live, Dad.<eos> Look at how we live.<eos> You know how dangerous my job is?<eos> And it gets more dangerous if you talk about it with your classmates.
I'm sure that's not out of a sudden sense of justice.<eos> So, if he's become a cooperating witness, then he might be in protective custody.<eos> Which could mean he's not in custody at all.<eos> He could be anywhere.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Detroit.<eos> They're about to unseal those files.<eos> What are you gonna tell Acevedo?<eos> I'll tell them... that the deal fell apart.<eos> Yeah? And how'd it fall apart?
He had a permit for bullets and a gun,<eos> A .357 ruger, as props, and they're missing.<eos> Oh. [ chuckles ]<eos> Probably find the bullets lodged in his chest.<eos> What kind of performer uses a real gun?<eos> Well, the festival brochure says That it had something to do with...<eos> "creating a charismatic space where limits are transformed."<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Stop it right now.<eos> No one is allowed to talk about this crap As if it makes any sense.
Oh, the, uh, display has fluorescent lights.<eos> And the inside of the tubes is coated with this phosphor powder.<eos> When the tube breaks, the powder gets everywhere.<eos> Any point in, uh... dusting for prints? Not sure.<eos> Video was pretty grainy, but it looked like they were wearing gloves.<eos> Besides, they took almost everything they touched.<eos> Maybe we don't need any prints.<eos> I got blood.<eos> "I wear a mask.<eos> "And that mask, it's not to hide who I am, but to create what I am."
I had to.<eos> Do you know how many laws you're breaking right now?<eos> You weren't telling me anything!<eos> I can remove the tumor.<eos> I don't know who you've been seeing for this.<eos> I'm sure they're great. I'm sure they are the best in their field.<eos> But I can only tell you, they lack imagination.<eos> They lack scope.<eos> Your tumor is smart.<eos> It's brilliant.
Two, Shepherd operates and resects something she shouldn't and I wake up gorked.<eos> And three... least likely of all...<eos> Shepherd operates, removes all of the tumor, and I wake up alive, deficit-free.<eos> Am I right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But as I... how far does the tumor need to reach before it becomes impossible to resect in its entirety?<eos> Nicole...<eos> We need to do this now.<eos> How far?<eos> Once it goes through the optic apparatus and breaches the hypothalamus, there's no way...
We're too late for him.<eos> We wasted valuable time.<eos> Not wasted.<eos> He deserved to be found as well.<eos> And I think it might have given us our first real breakthrough.<eos> I know this area.<eos> Only one way in and out.<eos> Traffic cam records it all.<eos> You two need to leave here right now.<eos> There's trouble brewing here and I can't risk it following us.
No. No questions.<eos> Just make sure that you follow the safety instructions with the liquid nitrogen... goggles and gloves at all times.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, see you at 7:30.<eos> Looks like you're pretty handy with a grill.<eos> Gotta do something to realize all this untapped potential.<eos> Was that such a bad thing to say?<eos> You do have potential.<eos> Which we all know is code for "nothing going on."<eos> So, if my job doesn't look like yours, then it's not legitimate?
- I remember them having a really good steak.<eos> - All right. Let me know what night works for you this week.<eos> Um... I...<eos> Dinners are not good.<eos> In fact, most of my nights are booked, but I could probably do a lunch.<eos> Okay, I see what's happening here.<eos> What's happening?<eos> You think I'm asking you out.<eos> What does that say about your self-esteem?<eos> It's either so sky high that with you about to pop you think I'm trying to get in your maternity pants, or it's so low that your brain doesn't go to "maybe he just wants to talk about that soon-to-be-open CFO position."
Well, hurt me.<eos> Leave David alone.<eos> Hurt you?<eos> No.<eos> That would be far too easy.<eos> You're going to tell everyone what we did first.<eos> I don't care about your secret.<eos> You can keep it as long as you like.<eos> I only care about one thing...<eos> Your pain, And that it be as long and terrible and unyielding as my own.
Called on her cell to say she'd be 5 minutes late for her shift at the library and she never showed up.<eos> There she is.<eos> He likes that age.<eos> Hey, Hotch, there's another missing woman.<eos> You need to get to the library on Third and Main right now.<eos> Today's victim, Josie Behdart, 23, single, she walked to work.<eos> Local cops just found her cell phone in a trash can and, surprise, no cameras.<eos> And all the original reports confirm that each of the victims was taken within a mile of this library.<eos> This guy's got a precise comfort zone.<eos> It hasn't changed since '78.
Got lost in the pool, I guess.<eos> Here's another form.<eos> I want to make sure you understand the severity of the situation, Daniel.<eos> The fact that you are under suspicion for a very serious crime makes your probation much easier to revoke.<eos> They can lock you up for jaywalking.<eos> I'll watch my step, then.<eos> Is that a joke?<eos> It's just the way I think.<eos> You have to bend to this life, Daniel.<eos> It does not bend to you.
I promise.<eos> Just don't forget.<eos> The front door of the trailer was locked?<eos> Oh, he said it was.<eos> I-I didn't check.<eos> So, then he goes around to the back.<eos> Yes.<eos> The next thing I knew, he was opening the front door from the inside.<eos> What about the duffel bag?<eos> I-it was still in the truck.
I don't want to be... humiliated and frightened.<eos> I don't want this to be happening.<eos> I woke up in the middle of the night and she was standing there.<eos> "Tell John that Stacey Bell has the owl."<eos> - Who's Stacey?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What owl are we talking about?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Thing is, it does actually make sense.<eos> Jonathan Black had a favourite toy and, er, it disappeared when he disappeared.
I know.<eos> It's just, it's been six hours of this, and I... I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Okay, well, this is your daughter's life, Raylan.<eos> This is what it looks like.
Previously on Justified...<eos> You're gonna sell dope whether it's legal or not.
You're going through my stuff?<eos> Have your mother and stepfather brainwashed you?<eos> Nonsense!<eos> I was looking for a sheet to write down a number.<eos> I work with explosive documents.<eos> So I lock them up. Sometimes, I move them.<eos> It's irrational, I know, but I do it anyway.<eos> Are you making progress on your article?<eos> - Yes.<eos> It's getting on. - What's the title?
Take the Phantom.<eos> Hopefully we'll be ready to go by the time you get back.<eos> Well, let's fire this thing up.<eos> I think it's scanning for a signal of some kind.<eos> Good luck.<eos> You could really get lost out here.<eos> Maybe that was the idea.<eos> What if this great commander we're looking for doesn't want to be found?<eos> 7567. 7567.<eos> It's homing in on something.
I'm the one that he was mad at.<eos> I'm the one that he had an entire file of research on.<eos> [cell phone chimes]<eos> If he blamed anyone, it was me, okay?<eos> So, what do you think that he meant by "I can't fix this"?<eos> Do you think he was talking about us and the job, or do you think he did something else?<eos> [Walt] Vic, I got to go.<eos> [Barlow] Mother Superior says, "Well, Monsignor, it's usually $150, but with the clerical discount, it'll be $75."<eos> [laughter]<eos> Now, there's a PG-13 version of that story for the family, but it's not half as funny.
- That was an accident.<eos> - Well, I'm sure it was.<eos> But it should never have happened.<eos> Well, I promise...<eos> I won't make another mistake like that.<eos> But you already have.<eos> You got into a fight at the oil field your first week on the job.<eos> Now this.<eos> That's two physical altercations in such a short time.<eos> You once told me... that the best way to stop a problem... was to get there before it becomes a problem.
It is my business, Walt.<eos> Whether you like it or not, your life, it impacts mine.<eos> Walt, Dr. Monaghan called.<eos> She needs you to get over to the church right away.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, thank God you're here.<eos> Is that your van?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I, uh, came out after my group, and... and it was on fire.
Well, Cara needs me.<eos> Now more than ever.<eos> It would be a big loss for your crime lab.<eos> Not with you there.<eos> John, we've talked about this.<eos> I've already got a job.<eos> I'm not asking you to just join the team.<eos> I'm asking you to run it.<eos> You want me to take over the crime lab in San Diego?<eos> I know it would be in good hands with you at the helm.
She would want us to fight.<eos> Fight?<eos> Against Drill, so he can't hurt anyone else.<eos> Come here.<eos> I think you're right.<eos> Minx, you're...<eos> You have a temperature.<eos> You feel all right, huh?<eos> I don't know. My head kind of hurts.<eos> Grandma gave me medicine, but it didn't help.
To the Upper West Side. To an event of some kind.<eos> She told you that?<eos> No, I just assumed because she asked to borrow my purse.<eos> Was it found on her?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes. Ana buzzed her neighbor because she'd lost it. Why?<eos> She lost it?<eos> That purse was on loan from a boutique.<eos> It's due back tomorrow.
That doesn't mean anything.<eos> I can copy a file by holding my finger down on a phone.<eos> Well, so can a monkey.<eos> Now, you're describing a system for animals.<eos> Terrestrial slobs bound to the earth by their meaty feet.<eos> I designed a system for gods.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You know what you've done.<eos> You know how lame virtual reality is.<eos> You know the damage it caused mid-90s cinema.
Ben?<eos> Yep.<eos> So, I guess we're good for today.<eos> Great job, you were right.<eos> We got everything we need.<eos> And, there's a small door in the back, back of the booth there, that will take you, you know, outside.<eos> And, we'll talk soon.<eos> I don't go the way I came?<eos> You do not.<eos> There is a little door back there, and it goes right on out.
What's going on?<eos> Are we out of gas?<eos> Yes!<eos> It's on empty!<eos> It's on empty!<eos> Like, the needle is invisible.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> There's no needle.<eos> It's gone.<eos> It's underneath the plastic or maybe the engine tried to use it as the fuel.
You forgive us?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You turd!<eos> I beg your pardon.<eos> Guys?<eos> You have no sense of accountability.<eos> You're like a child.<eos> If I'm a child, you're a child abuser.<eos> No, not cool, Annie.<eos> You never just said, leave my hand where it is, I like it there.

Space Elder Abed, can you reach backward with your mind and save our species?<eos> I can. I'm Space Elder Britta.<eos> What are you guys talkin about?<eos> I'm here now, child.<eos> All will be made right.<eos> Dean.<eos> Abed.<eos> I have discovered the meaning of the giant hand.<eos> A hand has two functions, to grip and to release.<eos> But without both of these powers, it is useless.
A ghost?<eos> So no name? I'd call him Silver Ghost, but that's probably already taken by an indie comic book or a terrible tequila.<eos> Bye forever Starburns.<eos> No. No. No, no, no, no.<eos> No, don't make me.<eos> Frankie? Dean, I respect that you are my boss, so either fire me or let me handle this and go to your office.<eos> I want to give your paintball friends a message, Jeff.<eos> Good morning.<eos> This era is over.<eos> It was fun while it lasted, but now mommy's home.
- Jellybean shower for you.<eos> - Okay. - I swear I didn't know.<eos> - You're getting a jellybean shower.<eos> - No! You are!<eos> You're gonna get it.<eos> You can't be falling for this dude, can you?<eos> - Truce?<eos> - All right.<eos> Nah, you're just friends.<eos> Carol, I don't want to demean your system here, but it's just so elaborate.
Ah, really?<eos> But no worries, you know.<eos> Just seeing the three of you happy is my milk.<eos> Well, aren't you a martyr?<eos> Well, if I'm a martyr, then I guess you're also gonna have to call Christ a martyr.<eos> Hey, Phil, you know, I have a ton of grass in my backyard.<eos> I'd be more than happy to keep her back there if you want.<eos> Nice try, Todd.<eos> No.<eos> I found it; it'll stay right here.
Don't let him strip that from you.<eos> I have to do this.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Pulling that trigger is easy.<eos> What I'm asking you to do is hard.<eos> It's harder than anything you've ever done in your life.<eos> He doesn't deserve to live.<eos> But he does deserve to suffer in an 8-foot cell for 23 hours a day, all alone, no friends, no visitors, no chance of ever setting foot outside that prison.<eos> You shoot him, and his pain stops.<eos> Let him live, and it never ends.
Maybe we slowed down the rate of infection too much.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> We've only done two trials.<eos> - It has to work.<eos> - And if it doesn't?<eos> Then we grab more strigoi and try again.<eos> He made it this far, and now he's dying.<eos> For God's sake, release it.<eos> This thing works.<eos> And it's spreading.
- Hey, ma'am...<eos> - Stop!<eos> She's just got the flu!<eos> - Sir, get back!<eos> - Grandpa, no!<eos> Standard operating procedure.<eos> Folks, a little cooperation, please.<eos> You all right, Dempsey?<eos> I'm OK...<eos> A little weak, but... it didn't get me in the neck, thank God.
I have been wearing the same three outfits for days.<eos> Maybe I should go and get the rest of my things.<eos> You should!<eos> Just clear all your stuff out and move them in here.<eos> Moving my things in.<eos> And that's not a commitment or anything.<eos> Of course not.<eos> _<eos> What about the furniture?<eos> Is it yours?
Perhaps Fonescu has an apartment above his place of business, as I used to.<eos> Mr. Fet?<eos> It'll take us a year to get through all of these.<eos> The book is much too precious to be kept in a public shop.<eos> Here, Professor, after you.<eos> Hey. Knock first.<eos> Or be less formal.<eos> Start searching.<eos> My sources tell me the Lumen is bound in silver but check every volume just in case.<eos> It has to be here somewhere.
- Why would I do that?<eos> - I saved your life.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, now you need to pay me back.<eos> But if I let you go, you'll take my book.<eos> I'll purchase it.<eos> Name your price.<eos> Mother Superior told me it was cursed, that I should burn it. But it's never been cursed for me.<eos> It's been special.<eos> It is special, Rudyard.
Yes.<eos> So, now you need to pay me back.<eos> But if I let you go, you'll take my book.<eos> I'll purchase it.<eos> Name your price.<eos> Mother Superior told me it was cursed, that I should burn it.

- Thank you. - Thank you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Alright, gate secure.<eos> What is this?<eos> This... this is the Silver Angel.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Now, are we gonna talk or we gonna drive?<eos> I don't feel as though I'm playing the violin so much as it's playing me.
I was wondering if you could come to the theatre.<eos> Her Ladyship's coming at once.<eos> She took it very calmly.<eos> She asked for him to be covered in his Lear cloak.<eos> Covered in his Lear cloak?<eos> Ooh!<eos> Fetch the photographers, ducky.<eos> Covered in his Lear cloak?<eos> This isn't the Death of Nelson, you know.<eos> Where is it?
- Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Just hang out.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm gonna splint your broken leg, Sam.<eos> I can hardly even feel it.<eos> Well, I guess you're gonna have to trust me on this one, okay?<eos> It's broken.
No, just his real name.<eos> He never introduced you to any colleagues or friends?<eos> No one?<eos> No, no.<eos> Why?<eos> Mikhail was executed to prevent him from defecting with information about a plot against us.<eos> Last night a colleague of his was killed for the same reason.<eos> I washed my hands three times.<eos> Blood doesn't come off easily.<eos> It stains.
But that technology doesn't exist!<eos> I'll catch up, I gotta run in here real quick<eos> And grab some urinal cakes.<eos> Why the hell do you need urinal cakes?<eos> For my shower at home.<eos> Oh, lord.<eos> Gross.<eos> Ms. Archer looks like a mule kicked her in the face.<eos> How's the water?<eos> Sweet baby james, it is perfect.
Bridget really wants you to come tonight.<eos> I got a rack of lamb, mushy peas, roasted potatoes.<eos> What do you say?<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I hope we see you tonight.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Ode, ode, take five.<eos> I ran your credit card three times.<eos> It's no good.
I'm fine where I am.<eos> Look... that's the one... the Balbo.<eos> I'll just have a clean shave.<eos> You're no fun.<eos> You're glum.<eos> All you guys are so fucking glum.<eos> Here...<eos> You can read the articles.<eos> It wouldn't kill you to come look at the room.<eos> Tell me how fucking great it looks.
- What's up with your hair?<eos> We tried to launch them at lunchtime, - but mine was too big.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> It only went, like, two inches, but, um...<eos> I think Violet's went, like, ten feet, though.<eos> - Stace, can you do me a favor?<eos> - And Ezra's...<eos> What?<eos> Can you move the rocket down a little bit?<eos> 'Cause it's blocking the window.
Previously on The Affair...<eos> You have chosen to divorce in what I like to call a humane way.<eos> All I want is joint custody of the kids.<eos> Do you have a physical space for them to live in at the moment?<eos> As soon as my book is finished, I'll get the rest of my advance, and then I'll rent an apartment in the city that's big enough for all of us.<eos> So you wanna go with this ending instead?<eos> I think it's really powerful.
I hope so.<eos> I feel kinda good about it.<eos> And you like working with Harry?<eos> Harry's great.<eos> We just can't agree on the ending, and it's driving us both a little nuts.<eos> I had a brilliant professor once tell me,<eos> "If you're having difficulty with the end, you fucked up the beginning."<eos> Oh, wonderful.<eos> I think he just meant, if you've laid all your cards out in the proper order, the ending should flow.<eos> It should feel inevitable.
Yeah, 'cause Martin hasn't been here.<eos> You little bitch, you missed me so much.<eos> Hey, just 'cause you almost died doesn't mean you get to call your little brother a bitch.<eos> I think it does.<eos> You guys are gonna see your dad again soon.<eos> - Friday, right?<eos> - Yeah, that's right.<eos> You finally get to see my new place in Crown Heights.<eos> - Not far, is it?<eos> - Is it big?
I hadn't heard from you for a while, and I thought you'd just kinda given up on us.<eos> - We talked all the time.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - I told you I love you.<eos> - I know.<eos> I was trying to figure out a way for us to be together.<eos> I read your book, Noah.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> How?<eos> It was lying open on Yvonne's desk the day I left.
- No.<eos> Well, maybe that's the place to start.<eos> We end up together.<eos> It's a happy ending.<eos> Wasn't that the end that Harry wants you to change?<eos> Look, I'm the asshole in the book.<eos> I destroy everyone I care about.<eos> I-I ruin my life.<eos> The story's not even about you.<eos> It's about me.
Please turn onto your stomach.<eos> Go on.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> You are drawn to the darkness in others, but at the same time, you fear it.<eos> You're afraid it will consume you, will obliterate your carefully crafted image, it will expose you as a fraud, but, Noah, until you let yourself experience your baser desire, you will never be able to hear your true voice.<eos> Let the darkness in.<eos> Let the darkness in.<eos> Let your root energy flow through you.<eos> When it meets your place of true insight, you will experience a moment of consciousness free from all illusion.
You're kind of falling through open air.<eos> Love can't work without the trust, without the faith.<eos> You know, that's why people say when somebody cheats, they say he was unfaithful.<eos> Think about that word for a moment.<eos> It's not about the sex, kids.<eos> Does God exist?<eos> Uh, well, not... not an entirely inappropriate sequitur actually.<eos> I-I think of God the same way as I think of love.<eos> I think if you think that God exists, then He does, because your faith and your actions bring His presence into the world, and the same is true of love.<eos> If you believe in its power and you conduct your life with respect of its... of its sanctity, then it'll always be there to serve you.
You already own all you could ever desire.<eos> I am beginning to think that you want to get caught.<eos> Oh, hardly.<eos> Almost caught.<eos> You wanna taste death without swallowing it.<eos> Can I just say... You are ruining this steak for me.<eos> You and I, we are insatiable.<eos> We...<eos> We thrive on the hunt.<eos> It feeds us!
But I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> Venter gave me the bomb, and I never set it.<eos> I never placed it!<eos> I couldn't!<eos> I was afraid!<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> In my dorm.<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.
I was terrified.<eos> He always said that he would kill me rather than let me leave him.<eos> The only good thing i got from Ron was my baby.<eos> We moved to Elizabeth, New Jersey, and he started writing "dianetics."<eos> The book was conceived and he started working on it in 1950.<eos> He said many times that the only way to make any real money was to have a religion.<eos> That's essentially what he was trying to do with "dianetics"...<eos> Get a religion where he could have an income and the government wouldn't take it away from him in the form of taxes.<eos> "Dianetics" was an immense success.<eos> From the moment it was published in 1950, it swept through America and other countries around the world.

Such a man becomes un-brainwashed, you might say.<eos> He becomes unhypnotized.<eos> This sounds, Mr. Hubbard, in a sense, like an extension of psychology or psychiatry.<eos> Oh, no, psychiatry has to do with the insane, and we have nothing to do with the insane whatsoever.<eos> Is this is a form of psychoanalysis?<eos> No, psychoanalysis, they lay back and...<eos> Don't associate scientology with such people.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> That's bad manners, you know? When I.<eos> Ron Hubbard first wrote "dianetics," he thought it was a tremendous psychological breakthrough, so much so that he would be recognized.
Hubbard, from the beginning, knew that people would pay for this counseling at a pretty good clip, and so he continued to come out with more and more levels.<eos> The real money was in paying for these higher and higher courses.<eos> They were getting into thousands of dollars.<eos> Those prices kept going up and up.<eos> That's really where scientology begins to create this indoctrination, is, "it's Hubbard that came up with that,<eos> "only Hubbard, and you have to be a part of our group "to get that spiritual satisfaction you were looking for."<eos> The Hubbard college of scientology, qualifications division, department of certifications and awards does hereby certify that Anthony a.<eos> As more members paid for Hubbard's bridge to total freedom, the church's coffers swelled with hundreds of millions of dollars.<eos> From the beginning, Hubbard tried to shelter that revenue from any government taxes.<eos> The founding church of scientology attempted in 1967 to get a court determination that it was exempt from federal taxation on the basis that it was a nonprofit religious organization.
From the beginning, Hubbard tried to shelter that revenue from any government taxes.<eos> The founding church of scientology attempted in 1967 to get a court determination that it was exempt from federal taxation on the basis that it was a nonprofit religious organization.<eos> A federal court denied the founding church tax exemption, saying that some of the church's earnings from 1955 to 1959 were used for the personal benefit of private individuals...<eos> L. Ron Hubbard and family.<eos> "Abc news" has repeatedly requested interviews with Mr. Hubbard.<eos> We have been told that he is unavailable.<eos> It was very exciting.<eos> It was that heady mix of emotion and belief, and it's...<eos> You get stuck to it.<eos> It's so strong that it sticks you like glue, and there's no way you can get away from it.
Then on the weekends, I'd be, you know, doing some auditing.<eos> Can you recall a time when you were happy?<eos> There was a social aspect to it too.<eos> You got to hang out with people.<eos> And there were some interesting people, nice people.<eos> These are all people who are looking to improve their life.<eos> While Hubbard was hiding from public view, he was very active in directing the operations of the church, particularly in Hollywood.<eos> This was just after the haight-ashbury era.<eos> And what scientology was selling itself is, "get high without drugs."<eos> It was a place where people went and explored ideas, and you would often see famous people...
It was a litigation nightmare.<eos> Being Miscavige's right-hand man, I was in charge of all those efforts.<eos> We were not only suing them in every possible jurisdiction there was, we were investigating the IRS for crimes generally, or things that would offend the public.<eos> These hearings into IRS integrity...<eos> In the late '80s, there were hearings about IRS abuses that had nothing to do with scientology, had nothing to do with nonprofits, had nothing to do with churches.<eos> They had to do with Joe taxpayer.<eos> And they we were publishing these glossy, expensive magazines.<eos> In fact, the exposã©s of IRS crimes were so hated that possession of "freedom" magazine was banned by IRS officials in the IRS building.<eos> There is going to be a IRS conference in the catskills.<eos> Right? And so we would send a pi, find out which hotel it's gonna be at, get down there during happy hour, socialize.
HE LAUGHS<eos> It's so good to have you back.<eos> THEY LAUGH GLEEFULLY<eos> It rewrote your consciousness, Max.<eos> Hobb's still controlling him.<eos> You have to leave me.<eos> Fred.<eos> We were right.<eos> The program creates consciousness.<eos> If it gets online we can't predict what would happen.
No, Sunshine... you can't ever outrun who you are.<eos> Freedom.<eos> And cages.<eos> M.K. is lying.<eos> I suspect he's the one.<eos> You said that boy is powerful.<eos> M.K. is the opposite.<eos> At least he seems so to me.<eos> That's because his power is sleeping.<eos> It only wakes when his emotions are stirred and his skin is cut.
Where's Sunny?<eos> He's taking his bike to the lockup.<eos> - I was wondering about...<eos> - Your book?<eos> Here.<eos> Can you read it yet?<eos> Nothing about this book makes sense.<eos> Sunny.<eos> You stole that from my room.<eos> I think it can show us the way out of the Badlands.
Tended to your wounds.<eos> I even cleaned and dressed your foot when you were too ashamed for anyone else to see it.<eos> I taught you how to walk again.<eos> I did everything for you, Ryder.<eos> I thought I could bring you back.<eos> That you had the will of your father.<eos> But you don't.<eos> What is this about?<eos> A mother's love is a powerful thing.<eos> But it can blind you.
I'm guessing you didn't tell Sunny you were coming?<eos> Something smells good.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know, I'm still trying to figure out why Sunny took you on as a Colt.<eos> I'm still trying to figure out how you two ended up together.<eos> Normally, when Sunny shows up, people end up dead.<eos> Look, you didn't come here to hear my little story.<eos> You have to read this book for me.<eos> It's beautiful.
I was listening.<eos> You got caught off.<eos> Yeah, the call was a ruse.<eos> He's planning something.<eos> You need to get back to the office as soon as you can.<eos> Did you leave the door of the Airstream open this morning?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> W-why?<eos> It's open.
Slutty elf.<eos> You want a simple piece with clean lines, maybe something vintage and off-white.<eos> What he said.<eos> Thank you for doing this.<eos> I asked you along 'cause I thought you'd be honest.<eos> I had no idea you were such a fashion expert.<eos> Not me.<eos> My mom could run up a designer gown before breakfast, cut her cloth by eye.<eos> Cool.<eos> My mom had a sewing machine, but it was always in hock.
It's irrelevant.<eos> Listen to me, I want you to take me to see Bob Paris.<eos> I'm gonna tell him I have it, and I'm gonna ask for some favors in return.<eos> Why you looking at me like that?<eos> I've had a good education in this crappy town.<eos> And I'm ready to play ball with the big boys.<eos> Play ball... But they'll kill you.<eos> They can't.<eos> I have the flash drive.<eos> I'm the only one who knows where it is.
Look, I-I know it doesn't seem like it, but you're in a very fragile state right now.<eos> You need to stop worrying about everybody else and just take care of yourself.<eos> I hear you, but I can't take care of myself.<eos> I'm a mother.<eos> Now I have to go talk to my horrible brother.<eos> You know what, I have no choice because it is important to my sons.<eos> Yeah, and what about your own needs?<eos> Parents do not have needs.<eos> You ever read the book The Giving Tree?<eos> It's about a tree, and this kid keeps coming and taking stuff from it his whole life, until there's nothing left but a stump.
Lucious,don'tdo this.<eos> Lucious ain't gonna make it, but he said he's gonna see you tomorrow, baby, at the house when we sign those papers for the IPO.<eos> Should we go ahead without him?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm Dr. Sirak, Andre's psychiatrist, and this is Michelle White, our music therapist.<eos> Music therapy?<eos> Are y'all serious?<eos> Don't worry about it, Andre. Mama gonna put a lid on that.<eos> Music therapy can be very effective treating bipolar disorder.<eos> It helps with stress, depression, extreme highs and lows and thoughts of suicide. SIRAK: Andre responds well to it.
You're absolutely hopeless!<eos> Did you ever consider-- the reason you're having trouble passing ninth grade is that you're incapable of anything else?<eos> !<eos> That this is the absolute zenith of your ability?<eos> !<eos> Zenith means top.<eos> No, it means TV.<eos> Ha!<eos> Now I'm catching fire.<eos> Damn it, Chris, your problem isn't book learning, it's that you're a moron!
If not a wolf, then hunger would have taken him yet.<eos> Let's to the wood.<eos> Been a'layin traps for some while now, even before this new misery.<eos> Within the wood?<eos> Will thou not help thy father?<eos> You and Mother have always forbade us to set foot there.<eos> Caleb, our harvest cannot last the winter.<eos> We must catch our food if we cannot grow it.<eos> We will conquer this wilderness.<eos> It will not consume us.
My sister's only child hanging from a cross!<eos> - Joseph...<eos> - We need this to end!<eos> We must govern ourselves so that we are never again subjected to Roman justice.<eos> You did nothing of any worth whatsoever.<eos> Make way for King Antipas.<eos> Your position is reliant on my endorsement.<eos> John, I'm poor and sick in my soul.<eos> I'm glad to give you this land.<eos> Barnabas, it's perfect.
Aah! Their strength is their popularity.<eos> I want to take that from them.<eos> You have questions.<eos> You say, "why did he call me his rock?"<eos> You ask, "am I the foundation?"<eos> Is this where his church will be built?"<eos> There is only one foundation stone.<eos> And his name is Jesus Christ!<eos> And his church is not here.<eos> It's not in those tents or these walls.
I told him you needed help.<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> You know it.<eos> What's more complicated?<eos> Did you get a lead on that black van?<eos> Dead end.<eos> So... where were you guys all day?<eos> I followed a lead, hit the same dead end.<eos> And I needed to grab some more components for the system.<eos> It's top notch, just not exactly CMR compatible, you know?
I don't.<eos> And you can't trust Kellogg to tell the truth about her involvement.<eos> I have evidence.<eos> Kellogg blackmailed her.<eos> My father did, too.<eos> Well, we'll have to find that out.<eos> Oh yeah, justice.<eos> That always gets to the truth.<eos> Justice, even if that's only a concept, that's all that I've got.<eos> It works great for those who can afford to buy it.
Yeah, it's fine.<eos> Fuck me...<eos> What happened?<eos> What did she do?<eos> Honey.<eos> Oh, my god, that's my...<eos> We gotta get her up.<eos> Oh! Wait, honey...<eos> Don't...<eos> I'll tell you what, grab a leg for me while it's down there.
They buried our couple there because they thought it was someplace nobody would look.<eos> - And they were almost right.<eos> - Where are we with the list of people that had access to the place?<eos> The professor finally sent it over an hour ago.<eos> Nina's been running criminal records on everyone who's been in and out of there.<eos> Good, because right now, that feels like our only lead.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> You're home. I got pizza from Mario's.<eos> - I'm not hungry.<eos> - Well, it's... sausage and onion.
Well, uh, given the state of decomposition, ground temperature, weather conditions, I can say with certainty that the body was in the ground for over 30 days. Why?<eos> 'Cause it looks our best suspect has an alibi.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why kill her after holding her for 11 months?<eos> You know, there's a complex psychological element At play here.<eos> The housecoat and slippers feel like part of a fantasy, probably related to domestic life.<eos> I suspect that Bonnie broke the fantasy.<eos> She does something that upsets him, he snaps and hangs her.<eos> It's clearly psychopathic behavior.<eos> And since we can't find any similar cases in VICAP, it's possible that this was his first attempt to fulfill his twisted fantasy, and it went wrong.
Leopold?<eos> It's not Leopold, is it?<eos> What, nothing?<eos> No name?<eos> W-What am I gonna call him?<eos> You're not.<eos> That's the point.<eos> - I wonder if I should have her followed.<eos> - Well, you already seem like you're about to place that chicken leg under arrest.<eos> It's an accessory.
- Rizzoli.<eos> - Isles.<eos> 6x04 - "Imitation Game"<eos> You have no idea who he is?<eos> None. He never came by the house.<eos> He never called.<eos> It's odd, given how serious it is.<eos> Well, we don't know that it's serious.<eos> Fried chicken is hardly a promise ring.<eos> Yes, but it does indicate fowl play.
Since when do state employees own $20 million paintings?<eos> The painting is mine, actually.<eos> - Mrs. Langdon.<eos> - Mary Hope.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, Sam, my husband, couldn't join us, unfortunately, but I can tell you anything you need to know about the painting.<eos> The Moran has been in our family for generations.<eos> Please.<eos> It used to hang in my father's study.
- Mary Hope.<eos> Please, come in.<eos> Hello.<eos> Uh, Sam, my husband, couldn't join us, unfortunately, but I can tell you anything you need to know about the painting.<eos> The Moran has been in our family for generations.<eos> Please.<eos> It used to hang in my father's study.<eos> - Thank you for your cooperation.<eos> - I can't begin to put a price on how much this painting means to me.<eos> If it had such sentimental value, why hang it in a museum?
- Please.<eos> Chief medical examiner.<eos> So... interdisciplinary.<eos> I could never do what you do.<eos> Oh. You've always been very modest.<eos> I read the Journal of clinical psychiatry, and your innovations and applications on narrative therapy are very impressive.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - So, what brings you by?<eos> - I was reading the Boston dispatch.<eos> I-I know it's available online, uh, but I just can't let go of the physical paper.
Preferably with granite countertops.<eos> That's gonna have to be later.<eos> There was a robbery at an auction house in White Plains last night, two people were killed.<eos> Preliminary reports suggest that the blood... boiled inside their body.<eos> Boiled?<eos> The M.E.'s are stumped.<eos> Security cam didn't pick up a clear image of the killer.<eos> - Was this book stolen?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It belonged to John Dee, an Elizabethan-era academic...
It's like doping in the magic world.<eos> Steroids.<eos> It's a substance athletes use to make their bodies unnaturally strong.<eos> Well, this sorcerer uses blood magic.<eos> Witches draw their magic from different sources.<eos> Katrina's power flows from nature.<eos> Others from fire, from the moon and the stars.<eos> Blood magic is one of the dark arts, a destructive form of sorcery that taps into base, evil forces.<eos> Here's the security cam footage from the auction house.<eos> I thought it proved inconclusive.
Because they just disappeared when Vi got sick.<eos> Like everyone else.<eos> - What about all your academic pals?<eos> - Oh, they're so broke and stingy.<eos> Plus they're up in Santa Cruz.<eos> We need the money today.<eos> - What's the O for?<eos> - It's not an O. It's a circle.<eos> - It was the quickest one.<eos> - Yeah, but it looks like an O.
I told you she'd gone soft, Mal.<eos> She's just Rusty.<eos> It doesn't mean anything.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Are we playing too rough for you?<eos> I think we should get out of here... and go find some real trouble.<eos> So, um, is... Is that the page that August took out of the storybook?<eos> Did you find anything?<eos> I think this door somehow Has something to do with the author.<eos> I just have to figure out where it is.
So...are you...<eos> Good?<eos> Bad?<eos> I think I'll just settle for balanced.<eos> Anything about the Mark?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> I found this book.<eos> It's a lore book ... "The Book of the Damned."<eos> Sounds legit.<eos> It's in a library somewhere in Tuscany.
I need you to hear this.<eos> The violin.<eos> The story about the girl at the recital.<eos> That was not Shaw talking about one of his victims.<eos> He was talking about his daughter.<eos> I should've realized it right away.<eos> The violin-- it-it wasn't full size, it's a kid's instrument, and-and...<eos> All right, slow down, slow down.<eos> I ran the DNA on the violin.<eos> It's female.
These numbers, they're great.<eos> I just can't explain them.<eos> Um... Maybe it's about more than numbers.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Are you suggesting a spiritual component?<eos> A what?<eos> I'm not decamping to an ashram, Felix.<eos> Thank god for that!<eos> Just open to perspectives on... on the void.<eos> Like, before it opens up and swallows me.
And we thought Dyad had answers.<eos> I want to talk to Coady.<eos> Give us a minute.<eos> You gave me Rudy's blood.<eos> Why?<eos> Temperature's down, no no hemorrhaging.<eos> - Remarkable.<eos> - So you knew I'd beat it.<eos> How? Because Castor and Leda have the same disorder.<eos> It attacks the boys' brains, the women's epithelial tissue... but as your fertility proves, Sarah, you're somehow able to fight it off.
I'm sorry to raise any false hopes, but Delphine knew you had a copy.<eos> M... m... my book... m... my father...<eos> Rachel. Rachel!<eos> She's having some sort of seizure.<eos> Call a medical team.<eos> Nealon?<eos> You assured me she could handle them moving her.<eos> I'm sorry, I thought she could.<eos> Here's the copy.<eos> It's no use without her.
Am I right?<eos> Right?<eos> Right.<eos> Let's give her a stress dose of corticosteroids.<eos> Then we can save her arm.<eos> There's nothing in her medical history that suggests lupus.<eos> That's because she's been hiding it.<eos> Nosebleeds, stiffness, butterfly rash... they're all symptoms.<eos> But there's no definitive test for lupus.<eos> It's a diagnosis of exclusion.
It was good, Gin.<eos> You can't have sex like that without feeling something deeper for the person.<eos> Actually, you can.<eos> Sometimes the body just takes over.<eos> A phenomenon you've documented, no doubt.<eos> You ever wonder if th-- if this work has ruined you?<eos> It has certainly lined your pockets, mister.<eos> I'm not saying-- Okay, yes.<eos> It has made you someone you have always wanted to be.<eos> But it has ruined you, too.
You might, uh-- might find yourself capable of things that you didn't know were possible.<eos> Look at my track record, Bill.<eos> I've failed twice.<eos> I obviously don't have what it takes, the patience and the focus and the selflessness.<eos> I'm terrible at all of it.<eos> Then please explain our success, won't you?<eos> Since, you know, that requires every single one of those things from you-- patience, focus, sacrifice.<eos> You parented this book, Virginia.<eos> You helped bring it into the world, after the longest labor in history, 10 years.<eos> And now here it is.
Cause of sexual enlightenment, yes, Bill, I realize that.<eos> You have made that very clear.<eos> This is not a traditional marriage she's proposing.<eos> Simply an arrangement to give your child legitimacy.<eos> It's about legitimizing your partnership, too.<eos> Perhaps it's your ambivalence that's the problem.<eos> That you live in a constant state of apology to your children.<eos> What-- what if you showed this baby that you were choosing to pursue your passion, not over him, but for him?<eos> You parented this book, Virginia--<eos> Half you, half me, and now here it is.
I could send a copy on over to you, if you'd like--<eos> No, no need, Bill. I read your book.<eos> You have?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Would you get me a gin and tonic, Barton?<eos> What are you drinking, Bill?<eos> I'm fine, thanks.<eos> Beefeater and plenty of ice.<eos> It's quite an achievement, your book.<eos> Although it's still about sex, it's still graphic, still controversial.
I think it's important that you know the truth-- the truth about me.<eos> In the future, when people talk about our work, I hope that they will say to each other,<eos> "What was all the fuss about?"<eos> I hope they'll find it hard to believe there was ever a time that this kind of study was necessary.<eos> What a triumph that would be.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have time for a few questions.<eos> - Leslie Farber.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> No one knows how your work will be received in the future, but I find myself concerned about the hidden risks it poses.
I'll only be another hour. I can...<eos> I can make sure everything's locked before I go.<eos> S... are... are you...<eos> Are you sleeping here?<eos> I stayed here last night, but that was the only time, I swear.<eos> I was late on my last rent check.<eos> I came home, and all of my things were on the sidewalk.<eos> People were walking by, picking through them like it was some kind of yard sale.<eos> Surely they can't evict you because of one late check.<eos> It wasn't just the one.
Jimmy could be very charming.<eos> Unless you were a soldier.<eos> Mr. Blunt.<eos> I saw your show tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You may be the only one who did.<eos> - Are you all right?<eos> - I'm fine!<eos> I just need to adjust my mask.<eos> It keeps on slipping.
He's a hoarder.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> Is that my Queen Elizabeth mug?<eos> And after we come back from the break, we will tell you about a fascinating Harvard study which indicates that emotional trauma can be found in our DNA and passed on.<eos> Put Walter's mike up.<eos> Maybe he's gonna praise my writing.<eos> So what is going on with Jim?<eos> Jim's computer is clean.<eos> He didn't leak that story.<eos> It was just Zeitgeist.
Things are going well there, huh?<eos> Well, this is a secret.<eos> I have this amazing opportunity to start a fertility clinic in San Francisco.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just love it there so much.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> That's a huge move.<eos> I know, but so was moving to Stanford in the first place.<eos> Believe me, Peter, life doesn't move in steps. It moves in huge leaps.
Mm, o-okay.<eos> Okay. Lauren, you and I, I think that we...<eos> Group two, elderly passengers and active military.<eos> Why not just put that in group one if you're gonna move it that fast?<eos> Look, Lauren, I know you're not interested in dating anybody right now.<eos> But if you were just to maybe... (gate agent) Now a special boarding as we welcome the New York Philharmonic.<eos> There goes your overhead space.<eos> Look, Lauren, I want to be with you.<eos> Life doesn't move in small steps.<eos> It moves in leaps.
Aye.<eos> Because I'm the one who took it from her in the first place.<eos> What's that... more kindling?<eos> This page appeared to someone very important to me.<eos> Robin Hood?<eos> How do you know about Robin Hood?<eos> Just 'cause the boy doesn't remember being me doesn't mean I don't remember being the boy.<eos> Well, you're right.<eos> Robin did find it.<eos> But this page... it depicts something that didn't happen.
What is she doing here?<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> August... We need to talk about how I'm going to keep up my cover with Gold.<eos> The only reason I was able to come here... is because they think I'm stealing this page.<eos> We didn't find the door at the sorcerer's mansion.<eos> That's because it's not there.<eos> What?<eos> But...<eos> You said you didn't know where it was.
The last man who tailed me ended up with a dagger in his gut.<eos> You dare drag me onto my own ship?<eos> You're a dead man.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> My daughter is not going anywhere near this vessel tomorrow.<eos> Well, threatening me isn't gonna make her change her mind.<eos> I don't need to change her mind.<eos> You do.<eos> How's a seashell gonna help me?<eos> It's now enchanted to take away her reason to leave...
Had an illustration of the door on it.<eos> Regina?<eos> They were just scraps of paper.<eos> Then you'll have no problem sharing them with us now.<eos> Well, I would if I hadn't already given them to Henry.<eos> Do you remember what the door looks like?<eos> Made of wood.<eos> Hand-carved frame. Gilt in Gold.<eos> Where is the door?<eos> All I know... Is... It's somewhere in Storybrooke.
Yeah, I can do that.<eos> Henry:<eos> Mom!<eos> What is she doing here? Oh, it's okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> August... We need to talk about how I'm going to keep up my cover with Gold.<eos> The only reason I was able to come here... Is because they think I'm stealing this page.<eos> We didn't find the door at the sorcerer's mansion.<eos> That's because it's not there.
Mom!<eos> What is she doing here? Oh, it's okay.<eos> I promise.<eos> [ sighs ]<eos> August... We need to talk about how I'm going to keep up my cover with Gold.<eos> The only reason I was able to come here... Is because they think I'm stealing this page.<eos> We didn't find the door at the sorcerer's mansion.<eos> That's because it's not there.<eos> What? But...<eos> You said you didn't know where it was. And your nose didn't grow.
I'm better on the page, anyway.<eos> I wish, I wish this would never end.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> This was a night I shan't forget.<eos> I-I-I can make it even more memorable.<eos> There's something I wanna show you.<eos> A pen?<eos> It's more than that.<eos> It's the most important thing I have.<eos> It's... special.
- I can take you.<eos> - No.<eos> I... I'm afraid it's something I have to do alone.<eos> And because of you, I can.<eos> Meet you at the hotel?<eos> And promise me you won't run off with any other lucky girl.<eos> I promise.<eos> Here.<eos> Take my car to be sure.<eos> It's yours now.
If this is New York, I'd hate to see the old one.<eos> Oh, we've been in tougher scrapes than this before.<eos> I'll admit, this modern world is a bit confusing.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> Marian, if you hadn't left Storybrooke, you'd have died.<eos> I made the decision to come with you and bring Roland.<eos> Nobody forced my hand.<eos> I know.<eos> Your honor is your greatest strength.<eos> But it's also the reason you're here and not with the woman you truly love.
I'm sorry.<eos> This was all about me.<eos> For her, this was all about...<eos> Making sure I never get my happy ending.<eos> If by happy ending, you mean us, then...<eos> At least, in a way, that's possible again.<eos> Look, it's messy, I know, but...<eos> Between us...<eos> Is a huge obstacle.<eos> And it's going to get bigger every day, and not just for nine months either.
You actually believe this.<eos> So you're crazy.<eos> I'm not, and I can prove it.<eos> This is a copy of the book we're trapped in.<eos> Let me see.<eos> This...<eos> This says I'm...<eos> Going to rob a royal tax carriage today to buy passage out of the kingdom.<eos> How did the book know all that?<eos> It can see my future?
I was a child.<eos> I was only trying to help you.<eos> You broke a promise.<eos> Because of your poor, poor judgment, my true love is dead.<eos> Your majesty, before you rip her heart out, perhaps you should ask her about the boy.<eos> So, you do have a brain somewhere in that pretty head.<eos> Where's the boy?<eos> Where... Is... He?<eos> When does this end, snow?<eos> This blood feud... when does it stop?
I've never talked about it to anyone.<eos> My mother was with another man.<eos> My father didn't know until years after i was born.<eos> He kept it from me, but i found out From my grandmother.<eos> She said my father didn't want me to think i was unwanted.<eos> He's tried to love me the same way, but he can't.<eos> How old were you when he found out?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> We better get back to the palace.<eos> If this illness passes through thebes, It will reach the north and every city in egypt.
You told me at the pyramids you want to be remembered as a great pharaoh.<eos> The Mitanni are still a threat.<eos> You cannot defeat them without me.<eos> I will have to.<eos> We both think we know how this is going to end, and one of us is wrong.<eos> Stay close the Vizier.<eos> He must be handled.<eos> We are running out of options.<eos> More and more of my people succumb to this illness.<eos> It must end here.
The writer.<eos> Oh... Your book is very blue.<eos> Wait, you let them read it?<eos> Sure.<eos> This is right in their wheelhouse.<eos> Mickey was married eight times,<eos> Joan slept with a lady once, and Rose shacked up with an Indian for 30 years. Not the casino kind, the 7-Eleven kind.<eos> You know what they say... there's nothing a Hindu won't do.<eos> (laughing) Well, Peggy, I don't know if my book was ready for this.<eos> It was just for friends and family and you.
Wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> Damn it!<eos> It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Something happened that night, something people are willing to kill to find out, and whatever it was involved my father.<eos> I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?
I've never seen such.<eos> Rubber means death.<eos> Why are you looking for?<eos> You're two men.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Why do you insist on coming with me if you will not help me?<eos> I remembered.<eos> You recalled what?<eos> Where can we find yakruna?<eos> I remembered one thing, but do not know what it means.
You have to find out.<eos> Move your luggage out.<eos> Ready.<eos> Satisfied?<eos> Show me that box.<eos> I will not let you throw it away.<eos> Show me.<eos> What is it?<eos> This music soothes me.<eos> It takes me to my father's house in Boston, to my ancestors.
Greater knowledge than that of my people!<eos> I will not let you take it.<eos> Never!<eos> Colombians are coming!<eos> Karamakate!<eos> What story is counting?<eos> How God created the world.<eos> The way is this song.<eos> Listen.<eos> Its beautiful, but it's just a story. It's not a story.
Call him.<eos> (Katya) Alex, what's going on?<eos> Huh?<eos> The police were just dispatched to your partner's apartment for a domestic disturbance with you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Were you guys just having a loud fight or something?<eos> No, she just buzzed me in.<eos> - Michelle?<eos> - Is she there?<eos> I just tried her door, and it was open.
This is Jessie.<eos> Jessie.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I needed you to go to the pharmacy this morning.<eos> I know.<eos> You need to be here when you say you're going to be here.<eos> I know. I'm sorry.<eos> Jessie, you look so pretty.<eos> I love your barrette.<eos> Where is it from'?
But I don't know, I couldn't get the words out of my mouth.<eos> Even if you can't talk to him, you have to figure out what's going on.<eos> Pliers.<eos> Are you gonna tell me what this thing does?<eos> You're smart, you can figure it out.<eos> I don't want to figure it out.<eos> I just want to know.<eos> Analyze that sentence, Spencer, it's very revealing.<eos> It's a gelato maker.<eos> - That's right, that's what it is.
My coach is coming over here to check on my progress.<eos> She's your coach.<eos> She's coming by to support you.<eos> Have you met Nan Zabriskie?<eos> She makes you feel like the girl in fat camp who got caught eating her toothpaste.<eos> What?<eos> It was minty.<eos> Um, did you forget the mustard?<eos> No.<eos> It's on there.
I don't think of you that way.<eos> This relationship now has three people in it, Talia.<eos> And you've been lying to every one of them.<eos> Look, I need to go, okay?<eos> I have a friend who needs me right now.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> Never mind what I'm doing here.<eos> Why is this here?<eos> Mike, why are you stashing my blood in the woods?<eos> It's not yours.
I want to tell my side of the story.<eos> But my lawyers won't let me.<eos> Your lawyers are right.<eos> You could say the wrong thing and wind up incriminating yourself.<eos> But I can't just sit here quietly while someone gets up there and tries to make me look like a murderer.<eos> Alison, you've told so many lies.<eos> People know that now.<eos> And not just in Rosewood.<eos> Your lawyers are going to have a hard time finding a juror willing to believe you.<eos> I want to tell my side, because, for once, it's the truth.
Han, I'm gonna call you back.<eos> Aria?<eos> You home?<eos> Yeah, I'm up here.<eos> Ow.<eos> What happened?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ow!<eos> Yeah, I was just standing on that thing and it broke.
Is my mom okay?<eos> It's actually really hard riding one of these bikes; it's super tiring.<eos> I don't have a watch on.<eos> I don't know why I'm doing that.<eos> Dad, I...<eos> Aren't they cute?<eos> Cute as a mute.<eos> That's a thing.<eos> People-people say that.<eos> Love is never what you think it's gonna be, is it?
What do you want from me? !<eos> You can't understand my disappointment... or my pride.<eos> You don't know this, but after I left you, after I was forced to leave you,<eos> I heard of your death -- your mortal death.<eos> I thought you were gone to me forever.<eos> Then, hundreds of years later and thousands of miles away,<eos> I find you, the King of Hell, and not by luck or accident.<eos> You made that happen all by yourself.<eos> You're not a mother.<eos> You can't know what that pride felt like, how huge it was.
Yeah.<eos> Hey, Sarge, you got a minute?<eos> You gonna ask about your dad?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then no, I don't have a minute.<eos> We've got an eight-year-old kid missing.<eos> All right.<eos> Her office is this way.<eos> Lucy went after anyone: Big, small.<eos> If there was a good story, it didn't matter.
I like him.<eos> You take that back.<eos> This household is Team Cindy.<eos> Did you see how he reacted when I told him your college buddy works for that company?<eos> Crazy coincidence?<eos> Uh. Bob, you didn't even go to college.<eos> Hey, Nance.<eos> Cat got your tongue... for once?<eos> Before I forget, I really need my shovel back.<eos> Is it in your garage?
Double up on the entrances and exits, and get those cameras online.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Let's go.<eos> If we don't get that Barn up soon, we could have a mutiny on our hands.<eos> Yeah, if we don't figure out what happened to him, there might not be anyone left to mutiny.<eos> - Nathan?<eos> - Parker!<eos> It's stuck.<eos> Nathan, the door won't open.<eos> It's stuck.
Hey, Brian, you want to go see Dr. Hartman and get that procedure where you get two wieners?<eos> Whoa!<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> That way, when I watch Black Swan, I can aim one at Natalie Portman and aim the other at...<eos> Yes, yes, yes, we all know who the other one was.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Well, good news, Griffins:<eos> Brian is gonna be just fine.<eos> I was able to remove his tumor.<eos> And if anyone wants to keep it, it's here in this Tupperware.
Huh?<eos> Huh?<eos> What is she doing?<eos> The knives are all clean.<eos> Told you my guys had nothing to do with this.<eos> What about outside of work?<eos> He had a tattoo someone was trying to cut out, so someone was angry with him.<eos> He could've done it himself.<eos> He hated that tat.<eos> He said it reminded him of all the trouble he caused.
I'm pretty sure most of us felt that way one time or another.<eos> Then the other day it occurred to me, maybe I'm the one who needs to do the loving.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I haven't felt alone, separate or apart since.<eos> Hey.<eos> Beautiful service.<eos> Very... moving.<eos> I saw you speaking to Destiny in the receiving line.<eos> I never know what to say.<eos> You know, death being what it is and so forth.
Parsifal it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Anything?<eos> I've tried everything from polonium 210 to anthrax.<eos> Spivak's cells neutralize any reagent I introduce.<eos> - It's like they're indestructible.<eos> - Nonsense.<eos> Natural selection is incapable of providing perfect protection from all pathogens.<eos> When evolution enhances a particular attribute to maximize survival, it creates a weakness somewhere else.
Meaning the terrorists were trying to kidnap Harris.<eos> Not you.<eos> Do you have any idea why?<eos> No.<eos> But you might.<eos> If I had to guess, I would say that that argument is about Dogleg.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I was arguing with Harris about the Dogleg op he was running out of the consulate.<eos> We need to know everything about this op.<eos> It involves dozens of covert operatives throughout Tunisia.
"Life is stranger than anything the mind could invent."<eos> That's something my friend likes to say.<eos> When I agreed to come to New York with him, I was still hurting.<eos> He'd offered an education, and I was gonna take it.<eos> I was gonna use it.<eos> I'd just listen and I'd learn, and when the time was right I would... move on.<eos> But then... I made another friend.<eos> And another one.<eos> My friend was only half right-- life is strange, but it's also good.
Not all of them.<eos> But a lot. At least a couple hundred grand worth.<eos> Says to me that Dubrovensky was the only guy who worked here.<eos> He died, his plants started to follow.<eos> Only they were never his plants, right?<eos> They were the cartel's, so why would they just let them die?<eos> Perhaps they didn't know he'd been killed.<eos> Aren't we thinking that they killed him?<eos> Are either of you familiar with the Wutai Pingtung orchid?<eos> It originated in the remote Wutai region of Taiwan.
I talked to a company spokesman.<eos> The official line is "no idea," but off the record, their best guess is political retaliation.<eos> Brazil's a billion-dollar market for AgriNext so they pump millions into local elections.<eos> Buys them influence over policy decisions.<eos> Guy said sometimes the drug cartels just don't like the candidates they back.<eos> Uh-huh, that's bollocks.<eos> On the record and off.<eos> In your experience, Detective, how often does the party on the receiving end of a cartel assassination say,<eos> "If only we knew what we'd done to upset them?" No.<eos> When a criminal organization sends a violent message, it does so with a certainty that that message is clear.
Let us be the judge.<eos> We're just...<eos> We're not close.<eos> I hadn't seen him for, like, a year, and then he shows up out of nowhere.<eos> He was bloody, he was a mess.<eos> He came to you for medical help.<eos> He said he was in a bar fight, and he just didn't want to answer a lot of questions from the cops.<eos> I couldn't just turn him away.<eos> The cut wasn't bad.<eos> It-it was deep, but it didn't hit anything.
I will talk to her.<eos> I'm gonna have to suspend her association with the department.<eos> Will you allow me to convey the news myself?<eos> It's him-- Simon de Merville.<eos> His dental records matched perfectly.<eos> Well...<eos> He's not the man who raped me.<eos> What?<eos> Look at the right hand.<eos> It's perfectly intact.
With your permission I will deal with her as I see fit.<eos> You would have her tortured?<eos> No, I fear that would give her more pleasure than pain.<eos> And the daughter?<eos> If she were involved, Your Highness would be dead.<eos> Everywhere, I see the hand of William of Orange.<eos> He seeks to undermine our alliance with England.<eos> Perhaps this failure will put an end to his efforts.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> It will only encourage him.
I'm just saying... Full-on zombie mode, I could've pulled this skull apart like a pistachio.<eos> We're not sure the first murderer was a zombie, but it looks like it.<eos> The second murder appears to be related, but doesn't speak to zombie.<eos> There seems to be one way to find out.<eos> Liv: I'm going in again.<eos> I need more hot seeds.<eos> Well, if you're having more... (squeaking)<eos> Hey, ravi!<eos> You made another zombie rat.<eos> It's not alive.
I'm the little gun, so...<eos> Let the little gun work.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I know that took up a lot of your time.<eos> I just wanna get all of the views with the thinnest cross sections I can get.<eos> And I find that adorable.<eos> You really think you can pull off your plan, huh?<eos> I've got all your past medical records.<eos> Once I get a firm grasp on the roads your other surgeons took to get to "no," I can cut away a clear path to "yes."<eos> By the time I'm done with your tumor, I'm gonna be able to tell you what street this bastard grew up on - and where it lost its virginity.
How old are these scans?<eos> They're only two weeks old.<eos> And they're completely outdated.<eos> I mean, this thing is growing too fast.<eos> Nothing is where it's supposed to be.<eos> Tumor has extended to the I.V.C. tributaries.<eos> - Yeah, these scans are useless.<eos> - I can't see what I'm doing.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It's also spreading
Page... page cardio 9-1-1!<eos> We gotta get out.<eos> Everybody out. Hands off.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> What's going on?<eos> Can someone say something?<eos> What are we doing?<eos> It's spread from her major blood vessels to her liver, diaphragm, pericardium, maybe even her heart.<eos> How can one tumor grow this big this fast?<eos> - It is everywhere.
How can one tumor grow this big this fast?<eos> - It is everywhere.<eos> - It's a monster.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Michael, I'm afraid Adrian's tumor has grown considerably and it's now reaching around her heart.<eos> So Dr. Pierce is here.<eos> Her... her heart?<eos> It's entangled through the vein that stretches up from her liver to her heart.<eos> And it's growing more rapidly than anticipated.
Well, look at this angle right here.<eos> Is that invading the right atrium?<eos> I think that's a motion artifact.<eos> - Crap.<eos> - Adrian's back in her room.<eos> Stable for now.<eos> How we doing here?<eos> Has the cyclops revealed himself?<eos> The cyclops?<eos> Well, the patient's a fan of "The Odyssey," so I'm calling the tumor the cyclops 'cause it's a big, ugly monster.
You aren't the least bit upset?<eos> It's gonna take more than that to ruin a morning that started with a whipped-cream smile on my waffle.<eos> Okay, it may have affected me a little, but sometimes it's hard to know what you're feeling.<eos> Mostly, I was thinking about racquetball later and hopefully giving Cam a nice spanking.<eos> Fair warning... may be working out some anger issues on the racquetball court this morning.<eos> - Don't ask.<eos> - Sounds good.<eos> So, we're getting our new dryer delivered.<eos> It's supposed to be eggshell, but, oh, it's not eggshell...<eos> It's white.
Come on.<eos> Please.<eos> I present to you the Asian for any occasion, the clown that will invert that frown, the dynamic duo of Fizbo and...<eos> Lizbo!<eos> Are you not hearing that?<eos> We're working on the name.<eos> Oh, no, Fizbo dropped his hat.<eos> Where did it go, Lizbo?<eos> It's right there.<eos> There it is!
If you signed a drooling maniac out of Crazy Acres, that's because I'm your only hope to solve this case.<eos> So if you want me to help you, and tell you how I know she was pregnant, for example, then I have to think clearly, and that means no pills.<eos> - Start talking.<eos> - Feed me first.<eos> Ethan, breakfast!<eos> So, I know it's not the weekend... but I broke down and made chocolate chip pancakes!<eos> I'm having whipped cream on mine, don't judge me.<eos> How's your new room?<eos> I had to look on three different websites to find that comforter.<eos> It's not the same.
Hey, you still there?<eos> I'm losing it, JD.<eos> I'm losing it. I'm losing it.<eos> All right, you stay put.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> So, Ethan, I've never met a robot boy before.<eos> I must admit, I didn't expect you to appear so...<eos> Human?<eos> My skin is made from a soft durometer polyurethane foam and organic vulcanized latex.<eos> So it looks just like your skin, only I don't have pores, so I can't perspire and I won't get a sunburn.
I'm sorry.<eos> That code is no longer valid.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I need to get in here.<eos> I need the spores.<eos> What's the code?<eos> The spores are gone.<eos> They took them to produce the virus.<eos> Where's the DNA sequencing?<eos> It's backed up.
You do, don't you?<eos> Here they are now.<eos> Well-wishers - how nice.<eos> Let her go.<eos> However you're doing it, let her go.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Let's go in, shall we?<eos> Why did the lamp break in your bedroom?<eos> What?<eos> The lamp in your bedroom window, why did it break?
But not so different, really.<eos> If you cut him, he bleeds.<eos> And if you hurt him, he'll fight.<eos> But he doesn't want war, or destruction.<eos> He dreams of a family.<eos> Of safety.<eos> Of a place where he can... settle among people he's never known... as if he's known them his whole life.<eos> He dreams... of a home.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen... there is life out there.<eos> And now... it's here.

It is Paramount.<eos> You will never, ever involve yourself in what you plainly do not understand.<eos> You know, there's a story, and, uh, it's probably no more than a means to inflate the price, but when I bought this land, I was assured king David once made camp here.<eos> Is that why you bought it?<eos> No.<eos> I bought it to make a profit.<eos> Paid through the nose.<eos> Glad to give you this land.<eos> Barnabas...<eos> It's perfect.
Died on impact.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know what it's like to lose a fellow firefighter.<eos> Do whatever you gotta do.<eos> What's up?<eos> Just got off the phone with Chief Hatcher.<eos> Apparently, CFD approved the alderman's request for a dedication ceremony in Shay's honor.<eos> - That's great, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's gonna be next Thursday here at 51.
And, also, a pen has been stolen from my desk.<eos> By one of you,<eos> - I presume.<eos> - A pen?<eos> How do you know you just didn't lose it?<eos> Because I know.<eos> But how can you be sure?<eos> I did not lose it.<eos> - Can I ask what the significance of this pen is?<eos> As long as it's on my desk by 3:00 p.m. today, I'll ask no questions.
must be a formality.<eos> It's awaiting the bishop's approval.<eos> I still haven't lined up a suitable parish.<eos> I thought you could put in a word for me?<eos> Now that Potts is gone, we need to stick together.<eos> This time next month, I'll be ordained.<eos> - We go our separate ways.<eos> - And what about our pledge?<eos> I'll be making vows to God.<eos> One word from me and I could ruin you, destroy this temple and everything it stands for.
The simple pleasures of Baden-Baden.<eos> The intimate bierkellers of Hamburg.<eos> Leipzig.<eos> Do you know it?<eos> That's a city that I'm not... not, um, terribly familiar with, I'm afraid.<eos> Tinted by the grey hues of Stalinist monotony.<eos> I was hoping that I might have a look at the painting.<eos> No, no, I'm afraid you're going to have to wait.<eos> Security concerns.<eos> It has such an intriguing history.
Trial and retribution.<eos> The blinking of an eye between time and eternity.<eos> The moment a soul's fate is sealed forever.<eos> A consummate assessment.<eos> I learned about art from my father.<eos> Do you think the guilty ever pay for their sins?<eos> I think you know my answer to that question.<eos> I saw you arrive yesterday.<eos> How is the article on Mr. Cadwaller shaping up?<eos> It will be enlightening, I can promise you that.
He sent them to their deaths in return for a cut of the loot.<eos> You're lying.<eos> It soon became a lucrative habit.<eos> Binkie might be a rogue, but he wouldn't stoop that low.<eos> As soon as the war ended, he sold on the art for an exorbitant profit.<eos> There were plenty of buyers.<eos> The Vatican, for one.<eos> You stole that painting to settle a grudge.<eos> This time it was personal.<eos> - Where is it now?
And you will pay with a proper trial.<eos> The first time I held it... ..I was looking into heaven.<eos> I saw the wicked... ..condemned to doom.<eos> To damnation.<eos> I saw my own fate.<eos> God is a merciful judge.<eos> There is always redemption for those who truly seek it.<eos> I still want you to return that painting.<eos> I thought I'd hang it in my dressing room.<eos> And what will it remind you of?
I was sent a dose, promised another...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What medicine?<eos> The one that was meant for me, but went to you.<eos> The one that saved your life.<eos> Now, you'd better hope your version saves me, too.<eos> So, it is the same serum.<eos> Well... how can you be so sure it'll save you?<eos> Because it saved you.<eos> But if the serum was meant for you, then you were a guinea pig, which means... maybe it reacts differently in you, maybe it was meant to supercharge your-your, uh, tumor cells to see what would happen...
A zombie booty call?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I instinctively take off my shirt every time someone knocks at the door.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> I just finished dyeing my roots.<eos> We can't all pull off the ethereal Tinker Bell look.<eos> I'm not sure what you're up to, but it seems to involve spiraling.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> Shouldn't friendship be the foundation of a relationship?<eos> It should be the foundation of year two of a relationship and beyond, but right now, what I really wanna do is spend epic amounts of time naked with you, and the friendship will come.
Not if she were like you.<eos> I know my mother.<eos> She's not a vampire.<eos> She is not in a prison world.<eos> She died of consumption in 1858.<eos> Uh, if you're so sure of that, why haven't you opened the coffin yet?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Everything you know about your mom is wrong.<eos> In the future, focus on my left side.<eos> It's far more attractive.
Was it a full-on walloping?<eos> How hard did the boy get hit?<eos> We believe that there are enough witnesses, one of them being a doctor.<eos> There is no...<eos> Once again, Your Honor, we are asking the court to throw this out.<eos> I'm just trying to figure out how this got on the docket.<eos> Have you all been conferring along the way?<eos> Well, Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> My God, it wasn't on the ground.
He was crying hysterically.<eos> And there was a mark on his face at that time, a pronounced one.<eos> There was lividity there.<eos> It was the... It was the mark of a forceful slap:<eos> Angry, red.<eos> So I checked for signs of concussion.<eos> I checked his eyes, which, though red from crying, were otherwise normal.<eos> It took him a long time to calm down.<eos> His cheek remained red for some time.<eos> And, I mean, certainly, it was still red when he left our home.
(Ritchie) Previously on The Slap... (Bridget) Your Honor, the State believes that if we let this go, we're saying that a grown man can slap a kid.<eos> And the bat was already on the ground.<eos> It wasn't on the ground.
Gary, no, I hate when you work outside of...<eos> You don't see me walking around judging people in my free time.<eos> Mm.<eos> I walked right into that one.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Proceed.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Are you mad at yourself for sending me that picture?<eos> Um, no.<eos> I mean, I was embarrassed that it got out and all these strangers saw it, but it was a really good picture.
Time of death... Anybody's guess.<eos> Well, in the magical win column, I just walked across campus without bursting into flame, so there's that.<eos> I need help.<eos> I had Duke send over Colin's medical records.<eos> This head scan is from earlier this week.<eos> This one... Was taken right here 10 minutes ago.<eos> See all that red?<eos> Well, I'm no doctor, but that guy is screwed.<eos> So the blood didn't heal him.<eos> It sped up his cancer and killed him.
Well, guess what.<eos> That includes you.<eos> I'm sorry, Tyler.<eos> I got it.<eos> I'm guessing you're not here on a basketball scholarship.<eos> That's not a regulation trashcan.<eos> Hey. I saw your camera.<eos> I'm thinking about buying one.<eos> You like it?<eos> It gets the job done.
And your mother?<eos> She died giving birth to me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why?<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> I present to you an invention that will forever redefine and expand the known laws of physics, transforming our world in ways I can't even begin to imagine... and ensuring my place in history.<eos> The power to transcend the fourth dimension, to captain the arrow of time.<eos> My machine.<eos> Looks like a fairground ride.<eos> How does it work?

Of course.<eos> But I can witness the crime and confirm my suspicions.<eos> How do you explain the locked doors?<eos> I believe the killer subdued my father in his lab, forced him to swallow the poison, and, then, escaped through the window, using a rope to climb down.<eos> ~ Hmm.<eos> ~ Problem?<eos> Well, the killer would've had to secure the rope to something solid.<eos> ~ How would they have got rid of it after...?<eos> ~ Perfectly obvious.<eos> In the distraction, after we entered the room, they simply untied the rope and let it fall through the window.
So what do you want to report?<eos> Wormicide?<eos> ~ The Inspector'll think you've gone mad.<eos> ~ Problem? Father Brown was snooping around my house.<eos> Really?<eos> Erm... I got lost on the way to the little boy's room.<eos> I'd like to see your brother's pipe.<eos> ~ What?<eos> ~ Frederick's pipe.<eos> It was on the floor when he died.

How does a bank clerk afford a car?<eos> I've just been to the gallery in Little Haydock.<eos> They have the most divine exhibition of abstract human forms.<eos> You must have fitted right in.<eos> Did you speak to the gallery owner?<eos> Yes, Richard is such a darling.<eos> He confirmed that they've been storing an item in the bank's vault.<eos> They've done so several times over the years, so it was nothing unusual.<eos> So, Mr. Harrogate wasn't lying? No.<eos> The sculpture was delivered to the bank at 5:30 yesterday afternoon and it's still there safe and intact.
Yes, I remind him of the paperwork left on his desk.<eos> So, the Cotswolds have enticed you out of London?<eos> When London bites, I come out to the country to lick my wounds.<eos> Your murder weapon.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Natasha, darling, I need you to check whether my barrel is straight enough.<eos> The Lord Chamberlain, the theatre censor, banned Bentley's last production from the West End.<eos> Decided it was too racy.
You want to talk about what's wrong?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Now I'm not just the girl who lied about being a lesbian, I'm also the daughter of the drug dealers who destroyed the school.<eos> - So fun.<eos> - You're having feelings.<eos> How about I'll come over after school and we'll eat them together?<eos> Isn't today your mom's meatless meat loaf Monday?<eos> Oh, uh, that got canceled.<eos> Mom's got a really bad hangnail.<eos> It's infected.
- Get out of the way!<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> All right, all right!<eos> Morning, Jerry.<eos> - Hey, how are you doing?<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> Eh. Different day, same bucket, right?<eos> Is that today's Times?<eos> Kristof's got a piece on net neutrality.<eos> It's very complex, I don't know where I stand.
All right, well...<eos> Hurry up, man.<eos> You got it.<eos> You okay?<eos> So this is what in over your head looks like.<eos> Just got to keep your head in the game.<eos> Okay, what do we know about this thing?<eos> Uh, sucker dries you out.<eos> I'm thirsty already, man.<eos> It likes water.
Maybe lack of fluids makes the thing hostile.<eos> So it's like a parasite.<eos> It wrings you dry, and then it moves on.<eos> So if I dry myself out, the son of a bitch wouldn't like that very much, now, would he?<eos> No, he'd want the hell out.<eos> You'd be a hostile environment -- well, more than you already are.<eos> Well, to be fair, you really haven't seen my chiller side.<eos> What do you think about rapid dehydration?<eos> Big fan.<eos> Just make sure you squash that sucker when it goes AWOL.
But victim or perpetrator, if your number's up, we'll find you.<eos> (Reese) Harper Rose.<eos> She a grad student, Finch?<eos> (Finch) Miss Rose is an anthropology major from upstate New York,<eos> Mr. Reese.<eos> Studied abroad in Europe.<eos> Took time off to travel.<eos> (Reese) Typical college student.<eos> (Finch) Atypical only in that the machine did not generate her social.<eos> It gave us her college ID number instead.
I can't enjoy it.<eos> Scotty to the bridge.<eos> This is Captain Kirk.<eos> Scotty to the bridge.<eos> You drove over the dunes and onto the beach?<eos> Not intentionally.<eos> I tried to stop it, but this car was like,<eos> "Mm, no, girl."<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did it get any scratches?
Please.<eos> Aubrey.<eos> Okay?<eos> That's not his world.<eos> This is my world, okay?<eos> I'm not going to let a murderer go free because everyone is afraid I'm not strong enough, here.<eos> I want to believe you...<eos> Look.<eos> I gambled in the past because my life was a mess.<eos> It was a complete disaster.
Minute I get any kind of information, I'm gonna text Aubrey and I'm gonna text you right away.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe, Booth.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna be fine.<eos> Listen to me, all right?<eos> I know the signs, I know the trigger points.<eos> I know myself.<eos> I know what it took for me to hit rock bottom.<eos> You know what, I haven't held cards in my hands for a long, long time.<eos> Because what we have here, this life... it's better than any hand that I could ever be dealt.
Nor modest.<eos> I don't know if you remember high school, but students are hypersexual beings.<eos> I get a lot of attention.<eos> You didn't do anything that would make her think you'd be receptive?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> Why do you think it's Jenny?<eos> These texts were sent from a prepaid cell phone.<eos> From the things she said in the text messages.<eos> She wrote me a note a few weeks ago.<eos> It was very graphic.
Baker's collateral damage.<eos> He's a popular guy.<eos> So you think our stalker planned this?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Well, either way, Dierdre's responsible.<eos> I mean, she's the one who posted the video.<eos> That just proves she's a cyber bully, not a stalker.<eos> Did forensics find anything on that thumb drive?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> It's clean.
That is a huge coincidence that the Jacky kid just happened to find this lighter after it's been sitting up at War Eagle for the last 70 years.<eos> Or maybe Francis Igawa left it there a couple days ago.<eos> We've seen him.<eos> No offense, but Mr. Igawa doesn't even know what planet he's on.<eos> Unless, of course, you think that he understands more than he's letting on.<eos> He understood that his lighter was missing.<eos> This is Sheriff Walt Longmire from Absaroka County.<eos> Your father was upset about losing something when we visited you.<eos> - Was it a lighter?<eos> - I think that's what it was.
Yeah, no-- no, take your time.<eos> Come on!<eos> Uh-- [groans]<eos> All right, touchdown. All right, well, raise your right hand.<eos> - Do you swear-- - hold it.<eos> If it's all the same to you, I'd prefer to use my own bible.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Criminy.<eos> It's back at the table.
Men of property, men of substance, men of godly goodwill.<eos> But above all, by men.<eos> Hear, hear!<eos> My husband...<eos> N... Let us be done with that.<eos> Mrs. Sibley, until George may speak for himself, clearly and audibly as a man, let us at least admit it is you, Mrs. sibley, who lead the select men of Salem.<eos> I submit it is high time that the select men of Salem either elect a new leader or explicitly affirm that they choose to be led by Mary Sibley under the name of her incapacitated husband, George.<eos> If you think this pox cares whether you be led by a woman or a man, you will all die.<eos> The pox no more discriminates by sex than a lion prefers to eat a man or a woman.<eos> Though like a lion, it may take the weakest first.
I think you might be God's gift to Salem.<eos> That's a very old-world affectation.<eos> Well, I think despite all the progress in new thinking, we are less advanced in other ways.<eos> After all, England achieved its greatest heights a century ago under a woman...<eos> Queen Bess.<eos> And yet over here, men like your Mr. Hathorne still doubt the value of a strong woman.<eos> And I think perhaps, Mrs. Sibley, you are like the Queen Elizabeth of Salem.<eos> Are you as adept at the new science as you are the old flattery?<eos> I am.<eos> And I'm determined to cure this pox before it spreads any further.
- Armada, yes.<eos> I'm genuinely still reeling from the fact that's in my head.<eos> It's really great when that happens, isn't it?<eos> No, it's odd.<eos> Makes me feel weird.<eos> And so she thought, to raise money, she'd try and get those who could afford it to buy lottery tickets and the prize would be enormous.<eos> And the money raised would be enormous.<eos> Now, what do you think the average wage was per year?<eos> - It can't have been much, can it?<eos> - No, it wasn't much.
But could it strictly speaking be the WORLD war at that point?<eos> - I mean, how many countries does it take?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It certainly is nothing like the entire globe.<eos> - Austria-Hungary is probably not enough.<eos> - No. My father was an MEP along with Otto von Habsburg who, had things been different, would've had much more power.<eos> My father was watching the football in the common room at the Parliament and Otto came in and said, "Who's playing?"<eos> My father said, "Austria Hungary."<eos> He said, "Oh, against whom?"<eos> LAUGHTER So Britain joined World War II in 1939, yes, but it had been going on since at least 1937 and arguably since 1935.
- Exactly the same. - You would have the same.<eos> Exactly the same in a Hawker Hunter.<eos> I would have shot out and the lower half of my legs would have remained in the plane. It's a bomb underneath you.<eos> It's just...<eos> Not a chance. Anyway.<eos> God, I was sick.<eos> I was supposed to be dropping a laser-guided bomb and I had these three screens and you have to...<eos> This was a dream.<eos> I kept vomiting all over the screens and so I missed not just the target but all of North Carolina with my bomb.<eos> I have no idea where it landed, to this day.
And he paid fathers for tall sons, he paid tall women to have sex with tall men so they could have tall sons. He was, and if he was...<eos> He sounds like my kind of guy, I've got to say.<eos> If he was unhappy, he'd get two or three hundred of his giants...<eos> Ho, ho, don't finish this sentence.<eos> No, no, no. Preceded by tall, turbaned Moors, with cymbals and trumpets of the Grenadiers' mascot, an enormous bear, to march for him to cheer him up.<eos> And they'd do this through his bedroom if he was ill.<eos> - To march for him?<eos> With a bear as well?<eos> - How big was his bedroom?<eos> It must have been, well, enormous.
APPLAUSE Very impressive.<eos> - And so it is called, of course? - Nollywood.<eos> - Nollywood.<eos> Nollywood is the right answer, absolutely right.<eos> Bollywood is the biggest. Nollywood is the second biggest.<eos> Nollywood was founded by Kenneth Nnebue, in 1992, when he bought in a huge number of VHS cassettes from Taiwan, and he figured that he could sell them better if he put something on them, cos they were blank.<eos> So he quickly made a film which was called Living In Bondage.<eos> And it was about a man who achieves power and wealth by killing his wife, but she comes back to haunt him and destroys his happiness and sanity.<eos> And it sold three quarters of a million copies.<eos> So immediately people started to... You know, to follow his bandwagon, and this extraordinary studio system - well, it's not really a studio system because it has so few facilities - but it's incredibly successful, they turn out 30 films a week.
No.<eos> I'm just...<eos> He's very good at tracking.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Uh, no, I'm-I'm fine.<eos> Do you need a tissue?<eos> It's the serum.<eos> She means I'm dying.<eos> I only wish it had the same effect on Liam.
I need to know everything that you know about him.<eos> Because I want to kill him just as much as you do.<eos> Catherine?<eos> You call Tess.<eos> You get her on the move.<eos> If he thinks he's got Russell, then JT is next.<eos> Vincent, wait...<eos> Just hurry, okay?<eos> The helpless zebra runs.<eos> But it can't outlast the powerful lion who only has eyes for the kill.
Then you won't be able to make the jump then.<eos> And people will die.<eos> You're one depraved guy-- you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I'm a beast, Vincent.<eos> Just like you are.<eos> Just like you used to be before love polluted every fiber of your primal being.<eos> It's not natural.<eos> What would you know about love, Liam?<eos> I know enough to know that it doesn't last.

Somebody want to catch me up here?<eos> Oh, it's nothing.<eos> It's just that my father erased Vincent's memory and turned him into a beast assassin.<eos> You were in Miami.<eos> The point is-- he made me forget, okay?<eos> And if it wasn't for your sister's love, I-I never would have remembered who I really was.<eos> But Liam, he doesn't have that, right?<eos> He doesn't have that love, so how can he remember?<eos> Well, not since Rebecca dumped him for Alistair, which, by the way, is, like, totally why he killed them both.<eos> Okay, but Liam's pain, it's-it's more raw.

Barry the Burlington Beaver.<eos> You know, I was a mascot myself.<eos> The Roosevelt High Screaming Eagle, if you can imagine that.<eos> I can.<eos> You in a bird suit, stuffed in a locker, waiting for your best friend the janitor to get you out.<eos> Did I tell you that story?<eos> Well, I am just glad to see that you and Teddy are so happy together.<eos> It's always nice to be comfortable.<eos> Felix, you're doing that thing where you say stuff in a cheerful tone, but I end up not being able to keep my Batman lamp in the living room.<eos> It's just such a fun piece and it looks fantastic in the back hallway.
Pain or peace.<eos> Aah!<eos> [ grunts ] [ grunts ]<eos> Corey: Andrew?<eos> It's Corey.<eos> Please listen to me.<eos> You have to stop this.<eos> Revenge... it's hollow.<eos> And it's pointless.<eos> It won't bring you back.
What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying maybe he did survive the fall.<eos> And the body wasn't his.<eos> Maybe he staged his own death to stay safe.<eos> The Germans were looking for him.<eos> We never saw the body's face.<eos> Don't say anything to her for now.<eos> Not 'til we know for sure.<eos> - The bottle is broken.<eos> - It was only half full.
"Mariane, of my heart, "how it beats for you still<eos> "beyond each shattered part, "yet it beats for you still.<eos> "At the dawn, "wrongs we suffered,<eos> "inflicted at will.<eos> "They were written on seams "of a heart that still beams, "how it beams for you, Mariane,<eos> "still. Do not mourn, Mariane, for a love that has passed "or the world born before we began<eos> They'll not silence our voice, Mariane."<eos> "And in each shattered part of a broken man's soul, "there's a shard, holding hope unfulfilled.<eos> "Seize it now, Liberty!<eos> "It will guide our way home.
Mm-hmm. Kind of sweaty.<eos> I know.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Why'd you get this one removed?<eos> I don't need it anymore.<eos> So what do you have planned for the rest of the day?<eos> A video conference with the Palmer Tech board, who still question whether I'm fit enough to inherit Ray's legacy.<eos> Hey, how'd you like the company back as an early Christmas gift?<eos> You're doing a better job of running it than I would.<eos> It's flirting with bankruptcy.
See ya!<eos> Bonding with Moms.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Nice try.<eos> This is your doing.<eos> And you should be thanking us, not oppressing us.<eos> Do you know how expensive foam machines and strobe lights are?<eos> If Theo hadn't stolen them from that circuit party, our senior prank would be senior rank!<eos> What is in this foam?<eos> It sticks like glue.
I'm good.<eos> I mean, I'm not great.<eos> That's two of us.<eos> This is good news.<eos> - Hey, Cass.<eos> - Sam.<eos> Okay, your turn.<eos> Talk to us about the darkness.<eos> Why would I talk about the darkness?<eos> Because it's free.
Not here, though.<eos> Somewhere else.<eos> So, why you here getting drunk with me?<eos> Shouldn't you be wherever she is?<eos> Well, we haven't really, sort of, erm, got round to, kind of, talking about it.<eos> ~ Well, I'm building up to it, just trying to find the right moment.<eos> There never is a right moment - just get in there, the man!<eos> You think?<eos> Look, when things aren't quite going the way I want them to, I have this little trick.<eos> It works every time.
By the way, that was slow and easy.<eos> I don't think you should do it.<eos> _<eos> Most jocks are a bunch of narcissistic jerks.<eos> I have been asked to be the interim head coach.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> So, if my job doesn't look like yours, then it's not legitimate?
Hmm? Is that what you want?<eos> To stay here?<eos> To rot?<eos> Answer me!<eos> Ah, you...!<eos> You know, you're right about one thing.<eos> As long as I have air in my lungs, I will never, ever stop.<eos> Lawrence?<eos> What is all this?<eos> This war, was it a mistake?
Guns are for celebrating.<eos> What do you do with them when you're angry?<eos> Now, calm down. This could just be an amazing musical coincidence.<eos> There ain't no coincidences in popular songs, bony.<eos> ♪ Only Austin... ♪<eos> ♪ Only Oakland... ♪<eos> ♪ Only Calgary... ♪<eos> ♪ Only Provo... ♪<eos> ♪ Area 51... ♪<eos> We've been singing this song like it only belonged to us, when every city in America's had its lips on it!
Back up. Let's go. Come on.<eos> And... there's the money.<eos> Where's the lucky lady?<eos> Well, I'm breaking about 12 laws right now, so I suggest you talk to her while you can.<eos> I'm gonna seal the deal for the kid.<eos> Ah, crap.<eos> "Love, Ralhp."<eos> Look at 'em.<eos> They're both content.<eos> Love can be misspelled and messy, but it still works.
The Ariel Nomad.<eos> Look at that.<eos> Come on!<eos> ~ It's just scaffolding.<eos> ~ No, it is brilliant, is what it is.<eos> It's from Ariel, the same people who made the Atom, ~ the car that ripped his face off? ~ I remember it.<eos> ~ It grew back, sadly, but this thing is, kind of, an off-road version of the same thing.<eos> It's got a 2.4 litre engine now and it's got all those body panels there. They're made out of the same material they use for traffic cones and boat fenders, so that thing is indestructible.<eos> ~ Which is a pity.<eos> ~ It's brilliant!
It isn't.<eos> It's the wandering albatross and I'm deeply, deeply sorry.<eos> Well done for getting that off your chest.<eos> Feel better?<eos> No, if you make a mistake, own up to it and move on!<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Right... .. now, we must move on to this, the Lamborghini Gallardo.<eos> In fact, of all the Lamborghinis ever sold, over half of them have been Gallardos.<eos> Now, though, sadly, it's gone and in its place, there is a new car.<eos> Here it is.

Oh, my God, is that the Follow...?<eos> They go through the tyres!<eos> You're not going to hold it.<eos> You did!<eos> Oh, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Argh!<eos> Not again, not again at the Follow Through?<eos> The same!<eos> What staggers me about that is, when the car is sliding, particularly going through there, which is about 80mph.<eos> So, it's sliding like that. Most people just give up, but you, actually, were wrestling with the controls in there.
Argh!<eos> Please tell me, have I won?<eos> Oh, Christ, look behind you.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> Well, there we are.<eos> Proof that the car is... ~ Is better.<eos> ~ It's better.<eos> ~ Was worth it.<eos> I'm afraid, even when it's comedically small,<eos> ~ French and electric, it's still better.
You're gonna want to see this.<eos> I have a love-hate relationship with these ceremonies.<eos> Each one is a reminder that we've lost a member of our family.<eos> Leslie Shay was a great paramedic.<eos> There are no words that can fill the hole that she left.<eos> The woman who rode alongside her from her first day to her last, Gabriela Dawson, would like to say some words.<eos> A lot's changed at 51 since losing Shay.<eos> We've welcomed in new friends, we got a new rig... and, uh... and a dream of mine came true.<eos> But here's what hasn't changed:<eos> this house, this family... it's all as strong as it ever was... stronger even, because I think, um... I think that deep down in the quiet moments we think to ourselves:
Good.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah, actually, that was fun.<eos> She kicked ass.<eos> Don't ever lose that part of you.<eos> Especially in a marriage.<eos> Flash drive?<eos> We'll take it to DHS, see if they can I.D. any of the suspects.<eos> Maybe we ought to take a look at it first.<eos> Just so it's away from anyone who may be looking for it.
As an investment?<eos> How many houses did you own before karma caught up with you?<eos> I was just trying to warn you. That's all.<eos> Oh, my goodness!<eos> He's just a bundle of joy!<eos> He's putting on a show.<eos> What have we got here?<eos> Nolan, I think that's your wedding ring.<eos> I must have forgotten to put it back on after our massage.<eos> Well, that thing must be the wrong size 'cause it keeps falling off.
Uh, uh, uh!<eos> See?<eos> You two are already enjoying working together.<eos> Okay, you got me.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> You'd never really hire Logan.<eos> It's just temporary, Louise.<eos> Logan's mom was nice enough to find me a plot at the community garden, because...<eos> Because he gave me this crappy job.<eos> It's not crappy.

It's all I have left to remember her by.<eos> But when I look at these, I don't feel sadness anymore.<eos> I feel gratitude.<eos> And do you know why? No.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> This little visit is over.<eos> I will just simply bid you adieu.<eos> Mr. Penguin.<eos> For some men, love is a source of strength.<eos> But for you and I, it will always be our most crippling weakness.
Hey, everyone stop talking about Peralta's personal life.<eos> Dozerblast over.<eos> Well, thank you very much, sir, and might I just say that this has been a Dozerblast.<eos> I saw what you did right there.<eos> - Get back to work.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know you've been working on picking a name for the pigeon mascot for, uh... Several months now.<eos> I feel like you might need a breather, so I've prepared an eight-point presentation on community engagement.<eos> We'll get to your presentation, Raymond.<eos> It's on the agenda.
Move over, Peralta!<eos> Move over!<eos> Okay.<eos> And if I may do a third toast. It'll be focused primarily on the mango yogurt.<eos> Don't boo me!<eos> I lost something important too, shoot.<eos> Thought I might find you here.<eos> So not a big fan of my speech, huh?<eos> No, I loved it.<eos> I mean, I wish it hadn't been at a wake.
I have never seen you enjoy soda pop before.<eos> - Hmm. - Have some now.<eos> Ahh. - It's delicious.<eos> - I don't buy it.<eos> You're making the same face you made when you found a chocolate chip in your trail mix.<eos> Something's up.<eos> I'm patting you down.<eos> Damn it, nothing but a surprisingly toned set of abs.<eos> Why would I have the crown, Jake?<eos> Isn't it still in the interrogation room?

Well, I found all the worms.<eos> They're eating a fox corpse in the outhouse.<eos> Speaking of which, I'm getting hungry.<eos> - What's for dinner?<eos> - Dinner?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Dinner.<eos> Did you not pack any food?<eos> There's fresh fox.<eos> Oh, it is not fresh.
- Wait, what?<eos> You guys are doing the polar swim?<eos> Why didn't you ask me?<eos> - Oh, we didn't think you'd be interested.<eos> - Yeah, you're always cold.<eos> You brought a blanket to a Mets game in mid-July.<eos> - [scoffs] This one thinks July 18th is mid-July.<eos> You guys think I'm some kind of wimp, but I'm not.<eos> I am tough, and I'm strong, and I love to splash around in chilly water.<eos> - It's not chilly, it's as cold as the waters of Cocytus, the frozen lake of hell.
And what ministry is this?<eos> The Ministry of Time.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Be careful you don't slip.<eos> It's quite the fall.<eos> Spanish civil servants from different time periods work here with keeping history unchanged as their mission.<eos> Our civil servants travel to the period when a time alteration has happened and fix it.<eos> - Over here.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, the time machine exists, and it's Spanish.
It's an old burglar's trick, in actual fact, something I dare say you came across in your job as a loss adjuster for an insurance company.<eos> The door was never locked from that point, meaning Betty could enter Jenny's room whenever she wished.<eos> All Betty had to do was wait for a sign that Jenny had started her bath.<eos> ~ Another one, ladies? ~ No!<eos> 'At which point, she just had to buy herself a few minutes.'<eos> I'm just going to nip to the loo.<eos> Back in a sec.<eos> 'You needed to be quick.<eos> 'But all you had to do was open the door.<eos> 'And that is when you made your one mistake, 'because in your rush to get away, you prised the cork out, 'but in your panic you didn't quite see where it went.
All you're doing is marking the target and reporting back.<eos> We'll make a plan to detain him at a later time.<eos> And if he makes us, what do I do?<eos> You call it off.<eos> You disappear immediately.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, I can do this.<eos> If you need an excuse to get away from your colleagues, this is a last resort if you need to leave in a hurry.<eos> The green pill is a tartar emetic.<eos> It simulates food poisoning.
The forest dark shall once more rise.<eos> What do we do, what do we do?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It can't get worse than this.<eos> I smell a Northwest.<eos> Come out.<eos> Come out, wherever you are.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Read through your dumb book already.<eos> I'm looking, and it's not dumb, okay?
With a large mountain range that isolates it from the continent.<eos> The desert in the north isolates us from Western civilization and a frozen continent in the South.<eos> We are an island, in the geographical sense, in terms of human geography, etc.<eos> We don't have a maritime tradition, and we've built up inland.<eos> But our valley is too narrow for agriculture, so we built our future on a very slim economic possibility, which, over time, has shrunk to almost nothing.<eos> This country has not made proper use of its sea, the vast ocean that lies before it.<eos> Few people have given the ocean due honor, have turned to the sea to admire it.<eos> Not just to admire it, but to acknowledge it as part of our identity.<eos> My country denies the Pacific ocean, the biggest of all the oceans.<eos> It mistrusts its vastness, equivalent to half the surface of planet Earth.
Salvador Allende's revolution broke the silence.<eos> A major social movement arose that spanned half the country.<eos> We heard voices we'd never heard before.<eos> Allende began to give back to the natives the lands that had been seized from them.<eos> The freedom didn't last for long.<eos> It was destroyed by a coup d'Etat, financed by the United States.<eos> At the same time, the disintegration of a supernova star was seen from a Chilean observatory.<eos> It was the first time this had occurred so close to Earth.<eos> Dictatorship struck Chile.<eos> It lasted 16 years.
These lands, both marvelous and in some ways blood-soaked.<eos> They hold the worst of ourselves.<eos> At the end of the day, we all...<eos> In a world of victims and killers... although both exist, we are each responsible for everything, for the victims and the killers.<eos> Each human being, no one in particular.<eos> So when such terrible things happen, as they often have done, throughout history,<eos> without participating, we're also responsible, as in a family in which a child commits a crime and the whole family is affected.<eos> So... this part of History, associated with water, ice, volcanoes, is also associated with death, massacres, abuse, genocide.<eos> It is one part...<eos> If water has memory, it will also remember this.
We need an autopsy.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go light a fire under Dr. Helpful out here.<eos> I bet all the inmates know exactly what areas are covered by surveillance.<eos> That they do.<eos> The lock's not picked, so they either stole a key from a guard or took one off the victim.<eos> But how did they get him all the way back here?<eos> They either waited or lured him here somehow.<eos> And look at this shelf.<eos> It's pretty high.
Let's thaw her and find out.<eos> I said that like five seconds ago.<eos> Yeah, but coming from her, it actually sounds reasonable.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> How come she's not waking up?<eos> She'd been in stasis for a long time.<eos> I have her sedated until I can fully evaluate her physical condition.<eos> And?<eos> She has Tataryn's disease.<eos> It's a disorder common on planets where they mine Serillium, a result of the run-off from refineries leaching into the water supply.

You're a snoopy little bugger.<eos> And I don't like snoopy little buggers.<eos> What is all this stuff?<eos> This is where Kappa keeps its darkest secrets.<eos> And now that you've seen them, I have to kill you.<eos> Would you please? I'm kidding.<eos> Whose bloody clothes are those?<eos> Allegedly, like, 20 or so years ago, a girl died in this tub.<eos> It wasn't down here then.<eos> It was up in one of the bathrooms.
I blame you for this.<eos> Hester, nice boobs.<eos> Dear Student Body, As you all know by now,<eos> Dean Munsch has decided to cancel Halloween.<eos> My daddy's lawyers said there wasn't enough time to file an injunction and that I clearly don't understand what an injunction is if I asked them to file one in this situation. That said,<eos> I refuse to allow Dean Munsch to keep us from stopping the scourge that is Black Hairy Tongue Disease in its black hairy tracks.<eos> So, while I will honor the Halloween curfew,<eos> I will not let anyone miss out on coming out in costume to support a great cause and to make me look really good.<eos> That is why I am opening my charity pumpkin patch 1 a.m. on November 1.<eos> It will be on the corner of Awesome Street and Totally Bitchin' Avenue.
That's it!<eos> I am done with this dead, lying bitch!<eos> I'm done with you, Number Two!<eos> Have fun in hell going to dinner with Osama bin Laden.<eos> Get in here.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Chanel #2 is telling us the truth from beyond the grave.<eos> Chanel is the killer.<eos> But, I mean, can we really trust a satanic talking board?<eos> It knew how many tampons.
As for you, Ms. Hemphill, I'm getting real tired of your nonsense.<eos> You make me wish I was a serial killer just so I could knock off your black ass next.<eos> If you want to accuse me of something, walk your ass down to the police station and get yourself a warrant.<eos> Until then, you better stay away from me, you hear me?<eos> That goes for both of you.<eos> Anyway, so I went back to the Candle Junction at the Three Hills Mall, and the girl was like, "Sorry.<eos> "We did have Mrs. Claus's Cinnamon Browneye in the back.<eos> "It was just hidden behind a whole bunch of stuff because it's seasonal."<eos> Seasonal?<eos> Anyways, the first thing you're gonna notice about this candle, like the Rita Moreno Daiquiri Hangover, is that it has a sturdy wick.
You're not even thinking about the serial killer on campus or the ghost that's stalking you.<eos> Yes, we are!<eos> That story just made it worse!<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> I hear you.<eos> Momma Denise knows you're still scared.<eos> So you just might need another ghost story.<eos> No!<eos> This Japanese ghost story is called "The Red Cloak."<eos> And it's about a ghost who lurks in women's bathrooms.
Leave me alone.<eos> Chanel... are you okay?<eos> I said get out, please!<eos> - I'm trying to kill myself.<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> How?<eos> - Duh, with an asp.<eos> - Like a snake?<eos> Yes. I ordered an asp online so I could kill myself like Cleopatra, and now I'm just waiting for it to sense my body heat and come out and bite me so this will all be over.
He told a joke about a woman once.<eos> Allegedly.<eos> We would also like to introduce you to our treasurer,<eos> Hester Ulrich.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is it still true that you guys take anyone who wants to pledge?<eos> It's actually now written in the Kappa bylaws.<eos> So today is going to be filled with us...<eos> Hi. It's me, Hester.<eos> You may have noticed my eye patch. It's temporary.
It pisses me off because everyone knows that you were getting almost punish-fucked for money.<eos> It's like you're supposed to have respect for yourself, too.<eos> I do.<eos> -Don't tell me that I don't have respect.<eos> -I know.<eos> -I'm not talking about you in general.<eos> -But seriously, there's a big difference between being on and off camera.<eos> Camera or no camera.<eos> If you're getting paid to fuck a guy, say he's tested, whatever.<eos> The camera could be there, it could not be there.
Well, that's like me.<eos> Yeah, anyway, she packed up her stuff, she said, "I'm not staying here," and she carried it all out, and her mum's shouting, her dad's shouting, they're all like, "Shame, disgrace," you know, bollocks like that.<eos> And<eos> Syma gets in the car, and she's like, "You'll never see me again."<eos> And her mum and dad say, "Good riddance!"<eos> And Syma goes, "Right, OK, goodbye, for ever!"<eos> And then the car won't start.<eos> So her mum and dad are standing there, shouting all sorts, and Syma's sitting in the car, and she says it again, she's like, "Goodbye, for good!"<eos> It still won't start.<eos> I mean, it really won't start.
Admit it, you're jealous we're spending time with another restaurant.<eos> I am not jealous.<eos> - Are so.<eos> - Am not.<eos> - Am not.<eos> - Are so... not.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Caroline, what the hell are you doing?<eos> I'm smelling a $100 bill.<eos> It's from my other restaurant.
We have to return to the Ministry.<eos> I'm going to tell Julián.<eos> This thing is more serious than I imagined.<eos> That's what I think.<eos> This photo has the Ministry's seal.<eos> What are you insinuating?<eos> I'm not insinuating anything.<eos> I would like to know if you have our whole lives in photos.<eos> No, the Ministry doesn't have any archive of that sort.<eos> The matter is to find out who got a hold of the photo because it's not a fake.

You all are here to obey my orders. Agreed?<eos> The second reason, and the reason I've shown you this old television program, is because Irene went to search for something that she didn't find and that now you must locate.<eos> The receipt for "Guernica".<eos> It's a painting by Picasso.<eos> It might be the most important one of the 20th century.<eos> The receipt?<eos> Do you want to return it or what?<eos> I don't know that the warranty isn't expired, it's been here in Spain for years.<eos> Since 1981 to be exact.<eos> That was the year that MOMA, the American museum where it had been, returned it, well, that's what history says.
-Right now, count to three.<eos> There we go, come on, help me.<eos> That liquid, what is it called?<eos> Chloroform.<eos> Up.<eos> By God, that is a good invention.<eos> Right.<eos> You take care of the officials from the Ministry of Culture.<eos> I'll go for the ambulance.<eos> There it is.
Here. Thank you.<eos> And where are you running off to?<eos> Done, the "Guernica" in ours.<eos> Mission Completed Good work.<eos> Everything's going as planned, miss Folch.<eos> What's bothering you?<eos> Nothing, I was just thinking about something.<eos> If the receipt for the "Guernica" ever really existed.<eos> I've also thought about that more than once.<eos> But it exists now, yes?
- Well of course.<eos> And you would not have to pay me fot my work as a writer.<eos> Ah, but if you write it, you sign it.<eos> Later we'll split the earnings.<eos> - Earnings.<eos> I have never known an author who lives off his writings.<eos> Besides, I am very comfortable with anonymity.<eos> Why?<eos> If a lot of people read it, it could be our moment of glory, right?<eos> If this book tells of our adventures, it won't exactly be "Amadís", my friend.
¡No!<eos> ¡No!<eos> Irene and Julián.<eos> I could suspend them from their duties for breaking the chain of command except this time the chain of command hasn't been up to the task.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And you, Alonso, how is it that you aren't in the hospital?<eos> I do not like hospitals, sir.<eos> Eh. May I ask you a question?<eos> Mmhm, of course.<eos> I am alive because someone gave their blood so that it could run in my veins.
Let's go.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Have you guys been to Dr. Hysteria's Hall of Horrors yet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was awesome.<eos> Not that scary.<eos> Some of it was funny.<eos> By any chance, did they stamp your hand?<eos> Yeah, they did, but it just washed off, so...
- Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know, I never would've thought that my love of churros would've led me this close to the gates of hell.<eos> - You laughed.<eos> - Okay, yeah, I laughed.<eos> The posse is back.<eos> It's all because of you, Beth.<eos> It was because of our friendship.<eos> I mean, it was stronger than evil.
- I didn't.<eos> - Where were you between midnight and 2:00 a.m.?<eos> On a different astral plane.<eos> - For real, I was meditating. - Ooh.<eos> - Can anyone vouch for that?<eos> - Yeah, my spirit animal.<eos> No alibi, and lots of checks paid to you.<eos> Okay, yeah, I took a lot of money from Emma, but I earned it.<eos> Took me weeks to cleanse her aura.<eos> It was toxic from all her fear.
What?<eos> What is it, Krumitz?<eos> He sent two separate messages to two separate computers somewhere in the botnet.<eos> It must've been the passkeys.<eos> Like a bank robber hiding his stash until the heat dies down and he can recover it and get away.<eos> Are you saying two random computers-- two in 20,000-- are secretly storing the passkeys.<eos> And the owners don't know it.<eos> That's not the bad part.<eos> The RAM got us to the botnet.<eos> But it was far too degraded to tell me which of these two people have them.
Damn it.<eos> Deleted is recoverable, but the drive is being overwritten; everything is gone.<eos> I've been monitoring Stephen Christos' e-mail activity.<eos> Bounty hunters just sent a new message.<eos> Due to unforeseen complications, they're upping their price.<eos> Unforeseen complications.<eos> That what they're calling murder these days?<eos> They made a mistake.<eos> The computer they sent this e-mail from had a parental control program designed to go unnoticed.<eos> Bounty hunters would have no way of knowing it was there.

One, two, three, go!<eos> Trap door!<eos> Ray, open the trap door.<eos> He can't.<eos> Wha--<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Cyril, please.<eos> I am way stronger than you.<eos> [straining] that being said, this thing's stuck.<eos> It's not stuck, it's locked from the outside.
Now, then.<eos> Carol, you had an idea?<eos> [gasps] are you a mind reader, too?<eos> No. You told us that you had one.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes.<eos> We all jump up and down at the same time<eos> To unjam this stupid thing,<eos> And then it plummets down into the basement,
That was my approach.<eos> We've already had the police in Rockland County search every stable, barn and farmhouse within the areas of falling hail.<eos> Huh. What?<eos> I read about a psychiatric hospital in Rockland County named Letchworth Village.<eos> It's been closed for a while now, but it was well-known because the inmates kept up a working farm.<eos> They grew crops, they raised chickens and cows.<eos> I'm sure it must have had stables.<eos> They haven't torn it down?<eos> No.<eos> It's right there.
It is alive.<eos> And what's it all come down to?<eos> Life...<eos> Will...<eos> Out.<eos> Grey's Anatomy 11x13 Staring at the End<eos> So, our fat-cheeked-baby tumor that's nestled in that brain, it's a creature of habit.<eos> It has the same routine day in and day out... to grow, to spread out, to take up space.<eos> That's it.<eos> At this point, our baby tumor is so enmeshed, so invasive, it's touching virtually every single brain structure.
_<eos> _<eos> Now, arguably, the most important part of the brain is the part that makes us hope...<eos> Dream...<eos> Imagine.<eos> One singular, almost immeasurable part is what makes you you...<eos> And me me...<eos> And everyone... Everyone.<eos> It's technically called the fornix, but I call it the "dream box."<eos> The question is... What happens when the dream box is being invaded, when a tumor is so large, so demanding, it's sucking the dream box dry?

I-I've got something to show you.<eos> If it's the shot from Psycho where you can see Anne Heche's bunghole, I've already seen it.<eos> No, Chris, it's something else.<eos> Come on.<eos> Heather?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm sorry, Chris.<eos> You-you did this?<eos> I did.<eos> I took your doll because it's not a natural or healthy thing for a boy your age to have.
Do not underestimate Peter.<eos> He is a snake-oil trader, but a good one.<eos> First, he tells the people that they have a problem...<eos> That they killed the man sent to them by God.<eos> Then he tells them that he has the answer.<eos> All they have to do is repent and throw themselves in the river.<eos> Does he ever stop?<eos> I never saw a man with so much energy for the destruction of his enemies.<eos> And here we sit... now...<eos> The chosen few, whose work it is to stamp out this heresy before it spreads from Jerusalem and takes control of Syria, Lydda, Emmaus, and even Masada, before Peter the fisherman can sell the whole world his fake cure.
Let the people know it was an act of...<eos> Forgiveness on the Eve of Yom Kippur.<eos> But at any other time...<eos> I have spoken!<eos> It's coming... in a day, in a week, I don't know, but soon the abomination will be here...<eos> A statue that heralds eternal war.<eos> Do you not see that we need to unite every Jew, every tiny sect and cult and bring them all together to fight this monstrosity?<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> This is politics, is it?<eos> There is the will of Rome, the fear it inspires.
Joanna, come with me.<eos> She will be put to death, Claudia.<eos> Cornelius, begin.<eos> This ends here.<eos> John, what is it?<eos> The statue.<eos> The statue of the emperor.<eos> It's here.<eos> Well, now...<eos> Here it is.
You believe one man did all this?<eos> He's no man, he's a demon.<eos> He's Death.<eos> These men do not need your fanciful tales, and nor do I.<eos> Miss Mills, precisely what is it you're after?<eos> I'm trying to stop the Horseman and his ally from killing you.<eos> So listen... I know you've seen things in this war that you cannot explain.<eos> General Washington has put his trust in you.<eos> He told you this revolution isn't just a war about the future of this country.<eos> It'll determine the fate of every man, woman and child.
~ Hi, yeah, there's going to be a fire drill in ten minutes. ~ OK.<eos> ~ Are you OK?<eos> ~ Yeah. I was just thinking about what you said the other day, and I can't do this on my own.<eos> I do need a man.<eos> ~ Can we maybe just... ~ And that doesn't mean I'm not a feminist.<eos> OK, I just need a person to help me and the person who wants to help me happens to be a man.<eos> I don't care if it's the 2000s.<eos> I got home last night and he'd made me a frittata.<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> It's an eggs thing. It was extremely tasty, and if that's the kind of behaviour I can expect ~ then I definitely want him around...
Knife-hammer olympics<eos> I got to plan the opening ceremonies.<eos> Gene: Wagstaff has questions for Jimmy Jr.<eos> Why does he dance all the time?<eos> What's he hiding?<eos> Does he have to go?<eos> Why doesn't he stop dancing and just go?<eos> Tell Jimmy Jr. to go to the bathroom already.<eos> By the way, here's his fifth grade picture.<eos> It's terrible!
It's not micromanaging.<eos> It's simply creating a love algorithm to compare data, weighting certain categories as indicators for long-term potential.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> I dozed off.<eos> Who's the space president now?<eos> Sounds exciting.<eos> So scientific.<eos> That's not the way love works.<eos> You can't plan it.<eos> It just happens.
For it not working out?<eos> For me picking myself up and trying again?<eos> Yes.<eos> For all of it!<eos> Listen, you fucking idiot...<eos> Yes, you are a fucking idiot.<eos> Let me spell it out for you.<eos> If you got bullied at school for having a gay mum, it's not my fault I'm a gay mum, it's their fault for being pricks.<eos> The problem isn't that I'm gay or that you're gay, Sian.<eos> It's that you've got a massive, great, big stick up your arse.
Danny, there is something you could help us with.<eos> Was Maggie seeing anyone?<eos> Probably.<eos> She didn't really used to talk about stuff like that.<eos> She said if there was someone important, she'd let us know.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you think maybe some boyfriend maybe did this?<eos> Well...<eos> Maggie had an injury.<eos> Looks like it came from defending herself in a fight.
How about this?<eos> Reworked Rubber Corp.<eos> Recycles tires and turns them into ground coverings for playgrounds and such, and there is one in Mid-City.<eos> All right, let's follow up.<eos> And then we get back, you can tell me what the hell a fire hobgoblin is.<eos> It's the most dangerous of all the hobgoblins.<eos> That was obvious.<eos> Never seen the kid.<eos> What about the car?<eos> Sure, it's Bull Costigan's.
Now get the hell out of your office.<eos> I got work to do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Can you tell me where Jim O'Donnell's office is?<eos> That depends. What do you know about immigration law?<eos> What, are we talking visas, or are you trying to process a labor certification?<eos> You know about immigration law?<eos> Doesn't everybody?<eos> Okay, tough guy, what do you think about my strategy on this?<eos> - I think it's a winner.
But you don't want to be a team.<eos> You want me to help you get McKernon so you can make partner.<eos> I want you to help me so I can keep my word to Avery McKernon.<eos> And when I become partner, I'll keep my word to you.<eos> What the hell word is that?<eos> That someday what you wrote on that napkin goes up on the goddamn wall.<eos> You seem to have done a lot of work here, Mike.<eos> Oh, it's no big deal.<eos> It is a big deal.<eos> Mike found a loophole in the Immigration Act of 1975, and it's gonna blow you away.

Abe!<eos> - Abe!<eos> - I'm trying!<eos> Abe, now!<eos> Hurry.<eos> Come here.<eos> Come here.<eos> Right, you two, in the boat now.<eos> Caleb, what happened to your beard?<eos> It was tickling the ladies, Annie.
Counterfeiting, for one.<eos> They can both be hanged and no one will ever know how close they came.<eos> Thank you, Benjamin.<eos> No, thank Brewster and Townsend.<eos> And Woody...<eos> I mean, Woodhull, sir.<eos> So, 7-2-1, do you trust the integrity of the Culper ring, then?<eos> With my life, sir, and yours.<eos> As you said, secrecy is the key to security.<eos> As long as the ring is secret, it is secure.
'As we set off, though, we had a more immediate problem.<eos> 'Could our complicated cars really cope 'with this vast, superheated dust bowl? '<eos> Vauxhall once thought they'd try and sell the Senator in Australia, a big old saloon made in Germany in the '80s.<eos> So they shipped one out here and it lasted a couple of days and then it split in half.<eos> Split in half!<eos> That's how brutal the outback is.<eos> This car has electronic valve control, electronic gearbox control, an electronic differential.<eos> Everything is electronic.<eos> It actually has a sensor in the engine that adjusts all the settings, so that no matter how hot it is or how cold it is, you always get 575 horsepower.<eos> And I'm expecting it to work here in this dust and this heat and with these vibrations... and then go farming.
But if you're driving a good car like this - well, any one of ours, really -<eos> I shouldn't have to suffer because somebody's still got an Anglia.<eos> Having established that our cars could stop on a stamp, we let them off the leash.<eos> 542 horsepower from a twin-turbo V6.<eos> It is absolutely ballistic.<eos> The mid-range thrust of this, when you're midway through a corner, it just... phwoar... launches itself.<eos> I think in this you could give some pretty good sports cars a pretty big surprise.<eos> In the early days, BMW's M cars sounded like 500 yards of ripping calico and they had telepathic steering and they were magnificent.<eos> In recent years, though, some of the magic has sort of gone.<eos> With this one, though, it is back.
You're obsessed.<eos> I'd rather obsess over a video game than obsess over an ex, like you are.<eos> This one's newish, right?<eos> Ugh! Yeah, I'm the sad one.<eos> You're right.<eos> We used to be Liam and Shane.<eos> We were hookup hunters, and the world was our prey.<eos> It's time to pick up our spears, 'cause we're gonna get back on that horse.<eos> I had a horse once.<eos> I loved it, but it ran away.
It was you.<eos> Are you gonna go get ready, then?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And can I borrow some eyeliner or something?<eos> - Yeah, I'll do your make-up.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Izzy, what's happened to your arm?<eos> Oh, it's better now.<eos> I'll take it off in a minute.<eos> It clashes with my dress.
Last Halloween, I went as Sprout from the Green Giant commercial and I even put pea pods over my pee-pee.<eos> You laugh, but I won $500.<eos> Okay, I created my own Cease and Desist order.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> Same place Max printed out that fake,<eos> "I don't have herpe"" doctor certificate.<eos> It works.<eos> And here's your business card.<eos> Where?<eos> Where is it?
Put your alarm on.<eos> Keep your phone with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> If he's blacking out, anything could happen.<eos> Do we really think this Jack guy is following him, drugging him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Something doesn't sound right.<eos> Is it possible this thing is controlling him somehow?<eos> What if it's in him?
Didn't think so.<eos> It's a big, gated compound.<eos> Only one road in about a mile off the highway.<eos> You got an address?<eos> 422 Mountain Estate Drive.<eos> I'll meet you there.<eos> No. Not this time.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> I don't want you getting pulled down with what I have to do.<eos> Considering who's in the compound, my guess is it's going to be heavily guarded.
Little bitch got boobs!<eos> I have the perfect clamps for those honkers.<eos> I'll even give you a discount.<eos> I'm feeling generous after that shot of edible body lotion.<eos> Sorry, honey.<eos> Ignore her.<eos> Like that's possible.<eos> Why can't she have her party at her house?<eos> Party is not for me, Hot Tits.<eos> It's for your knocked-up mama.
I mean, there might be more in here.<eos> Sam, burn it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm telling you I don't know any more.<eos> You're lying, just as you lied about me all these years.<eos> You're afraid I'll recover all the stolen potions and spells and become more powerful than you.<eos> Oh, poor, poor Rowena.<eos> Always the victim of one conspiracy or another.<eos> You're so consumed with your rise to power, you can't see the truth!<eos> I see the truth, and it's pathetic.
[Walt] You think these had something to do with Gareth's recovery?<eos> - What?<eos> - [Walt] I found them in the chapel.<eos> I'm guessing these are the same anti-depressants that were recently stolen from a local warehouse.<eos> Our husbands need those pills.<eos> Our families need those pills.<eos> Don't you wonder how you got them?<eos> Why should we?<eos> Do you think civilians wonder where they get their freedom?<eos> No, they just assume it's always gonna be there... for free.
That's a lot of people and a lot of luggage to keep track of.<eos> You remember all those folks and who brings on what?<eos> In my line of work, you just remember the jerks and the heavy bags.<eos> - What do you consider heavy?<eos> - I don't know, 50, 60 pounds?<eos> You remember this bag?<eos> I told you.<eos> I only remember the heavy ones.<eos> Well, this was a lot heavier before we emptied it.<eos> What do you think it weighed, Ferg?
I wanted to talk, so I had Ruby call you for me.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, that's very high school of you.<eos> Tell you what, if you want to talk, why don't you try calling and making an appointment?<eos> I killed a man.<eos> When?<eos> Couple of months ago.<eos> You ever read John Donne?<eos> Mm-hmm. In college.<eos> I remember a poem about a flea, but it was really about sex.
Different poem.<eos> "Every man's death diminishes me For I am involved in Mankind"<eos> It always made sense to me.<eos> Till a couple of months ago.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Barlow.<eos> I shot him.<eos> Twice.<eos> But his death didn't diminish me.<eos> It... lifted a weight off of me.
Don't beat yourself up on this one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where did this accident happen, Trot?<eos> Trot found Will right down there, 30-foot pipe right beside him.<eos> I don't know if he got hit down there or if he got knocked off the platform.<eos> So you just tossed Will Balint's body aside so you all could just get back to work?<eos> Look, everybody knows what they're getting into here.<eos> It's a dangerous job.<eos> People get hurt.<eos> That's why it pays what it pays.
You've been stuck in the woods of Vermont.<eos> When was the last time you went and got crazy?<eos> - (Danielle laughing) - (Gabi forces laugh)<eos> Okay, let's go.<eos> (Sighs) Okay, let's do this.<eos> Oh my God!<eos> How did you make those pajamas?<eos> Did you skin an entire zoo?<eos> I like your pajamas, too.<eos> Did it come with Barbie, or was it sold separately?
Having a family that cares about you, no matter what.<eos> And your new life and, and I'm not a part of it.<eos> Well, you could've been, Mad.<eos> You still can be.<eos> Look, I never forgot about you or Lori.<eos> But these people are a part of my life now, a really big part of it.<eos> And I'm not gonna just move out and leave them after everything we've been through together.<eos> I get that.<eos> Look, why don't you come back inside?<eos> If there's one thing about this family, it is that they are very forgiving.
- is pretty incredible.<eos> - Yeah, it is.<eos> (Taylor) I think we're gonna work things out.<eos> That's really great.<eos> I can't be with her until she knows the truth.<eos> I really hope you're right.<eos> What is Carter's necklace doing in here?<eos> Max?<eos> - Where'd you find that?<eos> - It was in the back of Max's truck.
- Yeah, it is.<eos> (Taylor) I think we're gonna work things out.<eos> That's really great.<eos> I can't be with her until she knows the truth.<eos> I really hope you're right.<eos> What is Carter's necklace doing in here?<eos> Max?<eos> - Where'd you find that?<eos> - It was in the back of Max's truck.<eos> What was it doing there?
[cheryl laughs] god--<eos> Dammit, archer! [laughing] [archer] whoo!<eos> [lana] archer!<eos> [lemuel] you're going too fast, you idiot.<eos> [archer] idiot?<eos> Who kept his life's work in his frickin' house,<eos> Apparently without any kind of backup whatsoever?<eos> Uh, yeah, that's actually a good point.<eos> I couldn't keep my work at the lab.<eos> It's potentially worth billions!
Yes, but it rained all day.<eos> Oh...<eos> - You're a bit off-colour today.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Right now I'm off-colour every day. Not true.<eos> The other day with your flowery dress on, it was like spring had arrived.<eos> Right, Laurent?<eos> To Mum<eos> Mum, I'm giving you my Argent Defender card.<eos> It's rare, but it's OK.
I have some money in the budget.<eos> Do you think Oscar could spare his assistant for the day?<eos> This is actually my day off.<eos> I'm just here for the free WI-FI.<eos> Great!<eos> You can help me with the hamburger photo.<eos> Step one: select the perfect bun.<eos> Now, our featured bun must be perfectly symmetrical with a golden crust.<eos> Okay.<eos> It doesn't shy away from attention, but it knows it's not the center of the sandwich.
What about Sara?<eos> Joe?<eos> Damn it.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> You make it really difficult for other people to see that, but I see it, and I suspect she had something to do with that.<eos> That supposed to make me feel better?<eos> Look, I just came by to give you this.<eos> I went into the Sonaris code, fixed the missing branch error.<eos> Not only that, this version targets older copies. It eradicates them.<eos> I muscled it up some, too, so it'll inoculate machines from future infection.
You know what?<eos> Actually the person I've been dealing with over there is Joe.<eos> Ahem. Joe who?<eos> (theme music playing)<eos> - Man: Incoming! - (glass shatters)<eos> - (coders laughing) - Oh, come on, now.<eos> (music playing in background) Duck!<eos> Gracious, is that a pajama top?<eos> - Well, what is a pajama top, John? - (groans)<eos> I mean, if you fall asleep in that shirt, does it become a pajama top?

We'll meet tomorrow night.<eos> I never go into business with anyone without looking them in the eye first.<eos> Cameron: Well, I want to kill him.<eos> I know you don't like Joe.<eos> Neither do I.<eos> I'd like to see him punched in the balls as much as anybody, but he's a businessman, and not a bad one.<eos> Put together Giant, got me onboard.<eos> That box was an abomination.<eos> From a strictly commercial standpoint, pulling your operating system was the right move.<eos> That machine, it meant a lot to me.

Are you man enough to be that woman?<eos> You know what, I might be.<eos> You'll be the Stedman to her Oprah.<eos> I wonder if he shops here.<eos> Hell no, man, we're in Mervyns.<eos> Here you go.<eos> This usually helps me think.<eos> Hot Dr Pepper and lemon.<eos> Oh. Luckily, I will not be needing that, because, as you can see by my board, I have figured out this whole time-travel direction change.<eos> My crazy cousin had a wall just like this, except it was all about Bernadette Peters.
Izzy would be none the wiser.<eos> Look, I might be a two-timing cheat, but I'm not a psychopath.<eos> I wouldn't murder someone for that!<eos> So, Izzy doesn't know anything about you and Annette?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, I hope not.<eos> Gosh.<eos> All this time, she really didn't know?<eos> Love is blind, eh?<eos> In some cases it can also be deaf and dumb.
[lana] so, if I understand<eos> The situation correctly,<eos> We're supposed to help these terrorists who--<eos> Well, you obviously don't understand the situation<eos> Because we're not terrorists.<eos> We're freedom fighters.<eos> They're the free wales army, lana.<eos> Oh yeah, that's-that's right, dafydd, good lad.<eos> Leg hurts.<eos> Yes, it will do, dafydd, you've been shot.
All hands.<eos> We need all hands.<eos> They're surly.<eos> I repeat, the bobbys are surly.<eos> The gate is behind door number... 42.<eos> Castiel:<eos> Go.<eos> Go!<eos> Welcome to the party.<eos> The prison, it's, uh -- it's close.
Majesty, if it please you...<eos> Look favourably on the Emperor's overtures... .. we beg you.<eos> For the sake of the realm and the commonweal.<eos> Well, if it's for the good of the commonweal, I... I shall begin negotiations with Chapuys.<eos> I suppose I must swallow any personal insults I have received.<eos> Other topics will not be open for discussion.<eos> The Emperor has discussed Mary with his own councillors.<eos> He'd like her married to his own relatives.<eos> I will in no wise suffer her to leave this country, until her behaviour to me is as it should be.<eos> Myself... I'd go up-country - and if she would not sign the oath, I'd beat her head against the wall, till it were soft as a baked apple.
But you have multiple small burns on your left hand, the type I generally see on scientists from grabbing a test tube prematurely off burners.<eos> Ha!<eos> I've seen you do that!<eos> And your pin is the symbol for calculus integration, chosen for your fondness, I deduce, in physics and mathematics.<eos> A man with such a wide range of specialities, traveling the world, could be anyone.<eos> I lip-read that woman.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> That woman asked you where the Japanese art room was.<eos> You directed her to the East Wing.<eos> But it was moved to the West Wing shortly after the pyramid display was completed 10 years ago, implying, of course, that you knew the museum when you worked on that display, but never returned after it was complete.
No x-rays seem to penetrate it.<eos> Can't seem to open the damn thing.<eos> Yes, that's because it has a sigil.<eos> On the lock, a magical symbol.<eos> Certainly you don't believe in magic.<eos> Well...<eos> Where did you get that book?<eos> The janitor found this.<eos> Well, it...<eos> It's mine.
The important thing now is to figure out how to stop this storm.<eos> People don't have great track records at stopping hurricanes.<eos> Well, they haven't had the resources of the Library.<eos> Zeus's lightning bolt.<eos> Destructive, but not nearly large scale enough.<eos> Could we blow it away, like off the island?<eos> Thor's hammer, in theory.<eos> No, that would... That would wipe half of New York into the sea.<eos> Wait, if it breathes, can we kill it?<eos> The hot and cold are balanced, but if we dump enough heat into the storm, it'll break apart.
We're...<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> The Magical Flutes of Pan!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> The Magical Flutes of...<eos> Pan!<eos> - What?<eos> ! - The Magical Flutes of Pan!<eos> It makes you wanna go to sleep!
"When sun and rue meet..."<eos> Hey, mister, you need to come quick.<eos> Something's wrong with your friend.<eos> Ray?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't know. I was... talking, and the next thing I knew, I was on the ground.<eos> It happens sometimes.<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, my head!<eos> It feels like it's gonna explode.
Like, how the hell are we supposed to...<eos> You've already figured it out, haven't you?<eos> The pink lines are temporary survey marks.<eos> That's where they're planning to dig.<eos> The orange is for telephone cables, and the white... is for digging over gas.<eos> They're repairing the gas mains.<eos> Contract magic works by coincidence... taking what's already present and using it against you.<eos> Gas mains are gonna blow.<eos> The gas line construction's part of Keating's campaign.<eos> Yeah, and it runs right under Town Square.
But there is a much greater risk.<eos> To be surrounded by all of this magic, to know that you could change things, that you could fix things and not succumb to that temptation, well... not very many good people can bear that burden alone.<eos> The Librarian before Mr. Carsen didn't die.<eos> He gave in to the siren song of all of this power.<eos> He gave in.<eos> Then he was lost.<eos> They will not survive in this world without someone there holding them steady.<eos> I told you once, the Library did not choose you for your ability to kill.<eos> The Guardian's job is not to save the Librarians' bodies.<eos> It is to save their souls.
You're doing an Ollie Impossible off the Great Sphinx of Giza.<eos> Yeah, that's what makes it epic!<eos> Besides, nobody knows me as a Librarian.<eos> They know me as Ezekiel Jones, Professor of Awesome.<eos> Thousands of years, the only way that people could look at themselves was in a pool of water.<eos> Now we have photos of ourselves taking photos of ourselves.<eos> It had to be magic, guaranteed.<eos> And nothing from the Clipping Book?<eos> - Library's back in shape.<eos> - It should be working fine.
He couldn't come up with something more original than that?<eos> So wait, that means that Dorian has figured out a way to transfer his sins to the victims who enter his club.<eos> Now that I know it's Dorian, I can figure out how he did it.<eos> How do we stop a bloke like that?<eos> Well, Dorian's soul is bound to the painting.<eos> In theory, destroy the painting, destroy Dorian.<eos> In theory.<eos> Where's the painting?<eos> DG Trust owns an art gallery very near the club.<eos> I'll bet you anything it's closed right now.
Thank you very much for aiding me with this project.<eos> It's important that we know if the Library has, indeed, fully returned.<eos> Yeah, well, it's good if I stay busy.<eos> Keeps my mind off things.<eos> Ah. The others?<eos> The others?<eos> Well, Jones is pretending he's fine.<eos> And Cassandra ain't pretending at all.<eos> When the Library...<eos> when it rearranged itself, it really screwed itself up.
Frank, love the haircut.<eos> Annie, I tried that three-bean chili recipe of yours.<eos> Muy caliente.<eos> What?<eos> What did I do?<eos> You're sitting in my chair.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> I didn't see the plaque.<eos> Not your fault.<eos> It's back here.
Felix, what the hell are you doing?<eos> Playing George Frideric Handel's theme from Water Music.<eos> Well, duh.<eos> Why are you doing it at 3:00 in the morning?<eos> And why are you wearing my Jonathan Toews jersey?<eos> I was chilly.<eos> You know, he wore that in a game.<eos> It's covered in blood, sweat and Zamboni fumes.
You're all at the bar... bright and early.<eos> I will be teaching a yoga class tomorrow, and I would love it if you could all make it.<eos> If it isn't too much of a stretch.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah, yoga's not really my thing.<eos> Guys, yoga changed my life.<eos> You might be surprised to know this, but when I was going through my divorce, I was a bit of a wreck.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - You?<eos> Come on!<eos> - No. Thanks to yoga, it helped me face my demons and emerge a calmer, stronger man ready to let go of my marriage and move on with the next chapter of my life.
Class should be starting.<eos> Join me, fellow travelers, as we embark on a voyage of self-discovery.<eos> Please welcome your spiritual captain Felix Unger.<eos> (whooping) Where's Dante?<eos> Okay, Dante is at his cousin's commitment ceremony in Paramus.<eos> So I have the privilege of teaching you today.<eos> Okay.<eos> A couple of good spots have opened up, uh...<eos> Now, as some of you may know, I recently went through a pretty painful divorce, but it was yoga that got me through it.<eos> It got me out of my spiral, let me release my anger and become the totally centered man you see before you today.
You guys, did Zhang circle back through here?<eos> No.<eos> She stormed off that way, didn't she?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh. You don't think... yeah, I do...<eos> O'Donnell's boxing gym.<eos> - She's going after Hicks.<eos> - I-I'll get her.<eos> She's my responsibility.<eos> If you're looking for the pilates studio, it's across the street.
I would like that very much.<eos> Let me go deal with Jakarta.<eos> You know, this guy Huet sounds like he has some anger issues.<eos> Assaulted an English banker when some minor deal fell through.<eos> Suspect in two other assaults in an airport in the Maldives.<eos> Also charged with drunk and disorderly.<eos> Jay, watch the car.<eos> You watch your back, Boss.<eos> - I hope you like the room.<eos> - Yeah, it's gorgeous.
Your liver failure seems to come and go whenever you need it to.<eos> Is that a question?<eos> Yes, actually, it is.<eos> I'm appalled at you, Mrs. Florrick... Questioning my health.<eos> Especially with you running for office.<eos> You're being deposed.<eos> You're under oath.<eos> So... let's take this seriously.<eos> Is your liver failing?<eos> It's my kidney, and, yes, it's failing.

We are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a Machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the Machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Great.<eos> No, more relieved.<eos> You know, you were always my hero, but I think I'm finally starting to see you for who you really are:<eos> A regional airline pilot whose landings are bumpy as hell and a pretty selfish guy who genuinely doesn't care about being a dad.<eos> Jake, you don't understand.<eos> There was a downdraft on the Drummondville runway.<eos> It's not my fault.<eos> Yeah, clearly.<eos> Look, I've been making excuses for you my whole life, but you're a pretty crappy father, and until you're ready to be a good one, don't call me.<eos> Also I'm taking your captain hat because it's cool, and I want it.
No, no, no, no.<eos> That started it.<eos> Uh, faith is a quest.<eos> It's not a panacea, but you know that.<eos> Thank you, Christine.<eos> - Have some tea.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> He knows how to win the guy's trust.<eos> He doesn't tell that story to just anyone.<eos> Looks like it worked.
He saw that by going organic, he'd sell his milk better.<eos> You should have called. I'd have come.<eos> Yes, but I had no battery.<eos> Did you call your mother today? - No.<eos> Why?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> The meat's well cooked.<eos> That's nice, but it's not true.<eos> I'm having problems with the oven.<eos> It doesn't heat well.
He always looked sad.<eos> I'm going away until tomorrow.<eos> You don't mind?<eos> No.<eos> You'll do the milking?<eos> - Where's Antoine?<eos> - With Iphigenia.<eos> He's pampering her.<eos> Paul?<eos> Take my car, it's better.
~ Add to that...<eos> ~ A fire alarm.<eos> The speeding car.<eos> The missing murder weapon and a trail of... ants.<eos> Really? !<eos> Really.<eos> And we are no further ahead with this investigation than we were at the start.<eos> Actually, sir, I found something.<eos> I recovered this blue thread from the smashed fire alarm point.<eos> It was caught on the shattered glass, so it belonged to whoever set the fire alarm off.
I won't.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We can see everything at the front desk from here.<eos> Nice.<eos> In two years, we'll have cameras on every floor.<eos> This is betsy.<eos> It's my mother's name.<eos> I love this thing, so I gave it a name.<eos> It handles all the reservations and information. We used to have to do by hand.

Things always get exciting when you're here.<eos> Khan has to go.<eos> This company is far too profitable to let him sink it.<eos> That's why the board brought me in last month.<eos> Khan's on his way into the meeting.<eos> Okay, I know it's bad, but come on.<eos> It's not Zoe Morgan bad. Right?<eos> Well, if the board hired me, it seems it's worse than you thought.<eos> It's the first meeting I've ever seen him show up to.<eos> It's also your last.
Get off of me.<eos> Finch, Khan lured Mark here to steal his employee ID badge.<eos> I've got to stop him.<eos> If this is Samaritan, he's got a target on his back.<eos> You can't afford to get caught in the crosshairs again.<eos> Yeah, well, he's gonna get himself killed.<eos> There's no way to keep the victim safe if the perpetrator is Samaritan.<eos> _<eos> What's he looking for?<eos> If that system is drawing that much power, it's doing a lot more than just scanning for viruses.
Yes.<eos> Can you describe this hole?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> I'm done.<eos> It was too dark to see.<eos> It was black.<eos> It was always black in the hole.<eos> I know it was small... 4'9" on the east and west walls, 6'" north and south.
Just in case.<eos> - Don't even think about it.<eos> Her belly is filling up with blood.<eos> Okay, let's go!<eos> Pack, pack, pack.<eos> All four quadrants.<eos> Ugh, it's not helping.<eos> Dr. Baumann, is...<eos> Is the blood running under pressure?<eos> It needs to go in as quickly as possible.
No!<eos> It's to practice on.<eos> I stink at unhooking them.<eos> Last week, I tried to take one off a girl at a party.<eos> I fumbled for so long, she started to laugh.<eos> It still haunts me.<eos> That's why I didn't go away this week.<eos> My trip wasn't canceled.<eos> Everyone found out and-- I get it-- you couldn't face them.<eos> Listen, I know this part of your life may not be moving fast enough for you, but enjoy it while it lasts.
I had killed with that song at three amateur productions, two gay weddings, and a two-hour gate hold on a 747, but I could tell the audience thought that I had sabotaged Kaplan to grab the spotlight,<eos> I couldn't have stunk up the place worse if I'd performed in a litter box.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Bravo, Cameron.<eos> Can't talk!<eos> I'll be in my stall!<eos> So, now everybody hates Cameron.<eos> Okay, look, I can't sing "Memory."<eos> It's too much song for me.
But I don't even recognize that guy anymore.<eos> I love my new faux mink, daddy.<eos> I forgot -- which Gabor sister am I?<eos> Y-you're Eva, the classy one, but listen.<eos> We need to keep the tags on it, because it's going back.<eos> Well, then yours is going back, too.<eos> No, that's a hard thing, because the saleslady said I look like Dr. Zhivago.<eos> So, is that a birthday present for you or an extremely late mid-life crisis?<eos> I don't think "extremely" is necessary.<eos> It's on loan -- kind of a weekend-long test-drive.
Can you grab me that juice box?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Anyway...<eos> Like I was saying before, remember how, when I was in the hospital --<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, man, this is gonna stain!<eos> I need to take it off and soak it.<eos> Uh, uh...<eos> You could put on my shirt.<eos> It's hanging right there.

Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo! This is so much better than that Barbie dream prom.<eos> We probably have a chance of getting into a decent bar for once.<eos> We look like a rich couple.<eos> Ahem, Jeeves, take us to the Four Seasons.<eos> My wife here would like a...<eos> what does a rich lady drink?<eos> I don't know. We should ask my mom what she orders when she's trying to pretend to be good enough for her moneybags boyfriend.<eos> I cannot believe Darlene is such a lying hag.<eos> You should just get it out.<eos> Hey, all that anger, it's gonna harsh our buzz.
Exterminate.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Ancient.<eos> Inoperable.<eos> Genius.<eos> You would threaten a dying man?<eos> Have I not suffered enough?<eos> Get... out.<eos> I cannot leave this chamber.<eos> It sustains me.
Get in.<eos> They don't have much respect for you, do they?<eos> Your kids.<eos> Have you seen the state of this place?<eos> I mean, this is exactly where you dump a smelly old uncle / family pet / genius scientist who couldn't even invent legs.<eos> Seriously, how do your boys take it when everybody else has got two eyes?<eos> You know what it is, of course.<eos> Oh, yes - it's a hyperspace relay, with some kind of genetic component.<eos> I am connected to the life force of every Dalek on this planet.<eos> It is what has kept me alive.
This couple might be the biggest casualty of the earthquake.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Ruby, you're doing great.<eos> My battery's at 5%.<eos> I'm... I'm getting tired.<eos> You can do this.<eos> Just keep pushing.<eos> Push, push, push, over and over, like the beat of a song.<eos> Uh, Ruby, do you know the song "Stayin' Alive"?<eos> Is it new?
I think you really should apologize to lana.<eos> For what?<eos> For being so racist about your hand!<eos> Wh--?<eos> Racist?<eos> Yeah, all that driving miss daisy stuff,<eos> And the piggly wiggly,<eos> And the-- oh, my god!<eos> I was mad because it's a robot hand,<eos> Not because it's black!
You can be sensitive around me.<eos> Your name, all right:<eos> Sierra.<eos> Is it because you drink a lot of Sierra Mist?<eos> Maybe, or it means that my parents are lifelong members of the Sierra Club.<eos> Or that.<eos> Let me show you the trick to that, kid.<eos> Come here.<eos> All right, so when you're cutting the bottle, you don't want to cut too deep, right.<eos> Otherwise when you go to throw the jug, it'll rupture.
I'll see you inside in a minute.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> I'm gonna get that car.<eos> And I'm not the only one who's getting a new car today.<eos> I want you to take the Plymouth.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You can't just give me your car.<eos> Look...<eos> It's yours.
What they lack in subtlety,<eos> - they make up for in irony.<eos> - You really think this group does everything they can to stop the butchering of farm animals and then suddenly decides to kill four human animals?<eos> No offense, Dr. Pierce, but you're an expert on the brain, not terrorism.<eos> Plenty of groups that espouse altruistic ideas resort to violence.<eos> Sure, but what's more likely?<eos> That the killer's the woman with motive and the victims' blood on her, or the vegans did it and left a giant arrow on the wall, pointing in their direction?<eos> Hey, Connie Meier was severely traumatized.<eos> No offense, Agent Krueger, but you're an expert on terrorism, not the brain.<eos> Her trauma could stem from having killed her family, or it could be an act.
They were my creations.<eos> Does an artist forget the details in her paintings?<eos> Certainly hope not.<eos> Well, someone's been using my old backstopped identity.<eos> We're trying to find out how they got it.<eos> He was murdered last night, and we have no idea who he really is.<eos> What happens to an identity when it's no longer being used?<eos> It's burned.<eos> Removed from everywhere except the CIA's classified, secure network.<eos> So, it shouldn't be able to be retrieved easily?

- Who shot you?<eos> - What?<eos> Your story was you caught a stray walking through Ellwood Park.<eos> But now, that's not true, is it?<eos> Not if you "took a bullet for your troubles."<eos> - It was Agent Keen, wasn't it?<eos> - Yo, I never said that.<eos> Get a forensic unit to comb over every inch of that ship.<eos> Tear up the floor until they hit water if they have to.<eos> If there's a shell casing or a stray bullet, I want it found.
Thank you, Mr. McVeigh.<eos> Nothing further, Your Honor.<eos> He's a good witness.<eos> - Mr. McVeigh, how are you?<eos> - I'm good, thank you.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you very much for taking us all through this technology.<eos> It just seems to get more and more complicated, - doesn't it?<eos> - Oh, yeah, it does.<eos> And culpability, then, gets more and more complicated, because it goes through so many different hands.
~ So they were both recently in the same location.<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> I think we've got something.<eos> We think Annika Vesik was taken yesterday from a phone box on the Heston Road.<eos> There's no CCTV on this stretch of road.<eos> But half a mile east of the phone box, there's a private security camera installed on a pub being renovated and a mile to the west there's another camera on a farm.<eos> So we've got a mile-and-a-half stretch with no turnings or side roads.<eos> Cars go by THIS camera and, a few minutes later, there they are, passing by here, both directions, as you'd expect.<eos> Except this one.<eos> It passes the farm, but at the pub - nothing.

- He doesn't need to.<eos> Barbados has no jurisdiction once he's in international waters.<eos> Then he'll never be charged for his crimes. - That-That can't be legal.<eos> - The law of his ship is the law of the country whose flag he's flying.<eos> My guess is he's done his research and registered to a country that doesn't have the resources to prosecute.<eos> We're tracking all vessels large enough to hold - four people captive.<eos> - He doesn't risk a long drive, so we're looking for marinas - closest to the airport.<eos> - Problem is, - there's a dock in every Thanks.<eos> Okay, my contact says there's an industrial marina about a half an hour from the airport.<eos> It's isolated... it probably would've been quiet last night.
It's a foolish work.<eos> This is Belasis's instructions.<eos> Every copy of this was destroyed centuries ago.<eos> I did devote a great deal of time to Belasis in my youth, but no longer.<eos> He is mystical when he should be clear and clear when he should be mystical.<eos> These are all... books of magic.<eos> Mr Norrell, such... ~ Surely you will find your answer here.<eos> In the past, magic was done as a matter of course.<eos> It... it was as much a part of this country as the rain.<eos> Then 300 years ago it died, seemingly overnight.
Oh, forever upon that damned horse!<eos> Get you gone, father.<eos> My boot is on the wrong foot and it is paining my bunion.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I don't know!<eos> We have not seen the likes of that for three centuries!<eos> I am sorry for it, sirs.<eos> Do not be.<eos> Magic is restored to England.<eos> I hope it can do some good.
A testament to your...<eos> extraordinary powers.<eos> I must say I think the idea an excellent one.<eos> Should you succeed, all the Poles in England will be on your doorstep.<eos> I have laboured all this time to make magic - my profession - respectable in the eyes of these men and then still, they despise me.<eos> Oh, my dear Mr Norrell, such an opportunity is unlikely to occur again.<eos> With one stroke, you return to us that sweet young woman whose death no-one can hear of without shedding a tear.<eos> And you re-establish magic as a power in the realm for generations to come.<eos> There is scarcely any form of magic more dangerous.<eos> It is dangerous to the magician, and... .. furthermore it is dangerous to the subject.
But I have found that in you.<eos> I belong here... With you.<eos> When I finish the story I am working on, I will find work in new york,<eos> And I will be a father to our baby.<eos> - If you want me to stay.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes. I love you.<eos> I love you, beth.<eos> I have a few loose ends to tie up on my story, But how about dinner tonight, And we can celebrate the demise of my globe trotting?<eos> Oh, may it rest in peace. [laughs]
Really?<eos> Do I do that?<eos> Because I really shouldn't.<eos> You're the one in trouble here, bub!<eos> Why don't you think about what you just did?<eos> Why don't you think about what you just did?<eos> Hmm. I will live with that forever, but this is about you.<eos> I swear to you on my mother's grave, I didn't do a thing!<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> So, the Flanderses got a new dog, and it knows my name!
"Ooh, Willie has to work in the hot sun all day.<eos> Willie's best friend is a stick and a string."<eos> I'm not here to mock you.<eos> "Ooh, Willie doesn't know when someone's being sincere!"<eos> I'm just here to hang out.<eos> What's that device you're using?<eos> My rummlie scob.<eos> Nothing exciting.<eos> Just a measuring stick dating back to the ancient druids.<eos> Oh! Could you tell me how it works?

Of course you may.<eos> And I am going to go upstairs and change out of this beautiful gown you've made me and put on my traveling clothes.<eos> You sure you don't want to have a drink to celebrate first?<eos> That's what the honeymoon is for.<eos> I'd like to get that started.<eos> Well, I think I'm going to.<eos> Your wife finds no reason to object, and you own the bar.<eos> My darling Liz.<eos> These are for you, with my genuine hope that you someday find true love.<eos> One never knows when it may appear.
This fucking phone.<eos> There she is.<eos> Oh, my God, she's stunning.<eos> It says here she's gonna be a big star.<eos> Will she sing Billy Joel?<eos> Oh, now you want to meet her because she might turn out to be somebody some day?<eos> The wedding is Saturday, darling.<eos> I'll send the information over to Eva's email address.<eos> Ava.<eos> It's Ava...
And since he won't get out of his pajamas, I dug up my old sewing machine to make him another pair.<eos> So at least he has... an alternate.<eos> You dig up anything else?<eos> I did.<eos> So if you look at the crime scene photos, they tell a pretty clear story.<eos> Once upon a time, Lieutenant Pine got hit on the head, his blood spattered on the wall, he crashed through a coffee table and he lay on the floor, dead.<eos> Not great for bedtime.<eos> Believe it or not, the most twisted thing about this story is this painting.<eos> It's called The Chesapeake, and it's been hung on many impressive walls over the last 50 years.<eos> Right now it's on loan to the admiral from the Navy's art collection.
And guess what was hanging on that wall?<eos> Bug is in the painting?<eos> All the more reason to steal it.<eos> Now, the most logical place to hide the bug would be in this frame, but there's no evidence that it was ever here, so it must be in some other part of the painting.<eos> What's recorded on it?<eos> Hey.<eos> Just got back.<eos> What'd I miss?<eos> A lot.<eos> Before the painting was donated to the Navy, it hung in the Secretary of Defense office for, like, two months.
Both of which I did.<eos> We agreed that I would pay you the rest once I had The Chesapeake in hand.<eos> True.<eos> But it's a woman's prerogative to change her mind.<eos> Especially when it means a greater profit.<eos> So... how about an opening bid?<eos> Where's the painting?<eos> Acquiring it must have taken a very special set of skills.<eos> Yes.<eos> It belonged to the Navy.
These magazines change lives.<eos> Oh, my God, Bobby, it's not a scam.<eos> We had it all wrong.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Still think this is a bunch of crap.<eos> It-it just seems like you're asking girls to sell magazines and then taking the money.<eos> Okay, you know what else a turtle can do?<eos> Huh?<eos> Do you know?<eos> A little turtle, what can it do, hmm?

He needs water.<eos> My heart?<eos> Yeah, good thing he doesn't know you don't have one.<eos> Well, who needs a heart... when you got a brain?<eos> Here goes.<eos> "Ground control to Major Tom."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> No signal, radio or otherwise, can get in and out of the dome.<eos> Exactly, that's why I'm jacking up the transmitter's signal.<eos> When it can't get outside the dome, it'll start bouncing off the walls, back and forth, uh, building in strength, kind of like an A.M. Radio signal, bouncing off the ionosphere when it cools down at night.
~ He's gone.<eos> ~ Right, you know what we need to do?<eos> ~ Go on.<eos> ~ We need to go.<eos> ~ Go?<eos> ~ Go.<eos> ~ We can't go.<eos> If we go, Jimmy the Ferret will feed us to his ferrets.<eos> Ah, I remember the story now.<eos> It's not that funny after all.
Well, you wouldn't shoot a cripple in the back, would you?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> You're too honorable for that, sweetie.<eos> Final warning.<eos> It rarely ends well for people who order me around.<eos> I'm devastated.<eos> I always felt a certain internal chemistry with you.<eos> Shut up.<eos> The Ridge is a couple of clicks north.<eos> There's a back road, but it's kind of overgrown, hard to navigate unless you know it.
He looks cute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Can I have that one?<eos> - No!<eos> - Oh, go on, then.<eos> Can I have this one, then?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Go on, then.<eos> I can't believe you've cleaned the flat.<eos> It needed it!
Medium.<eos> Fantastic.<eos> That's yours, isn't it?<eos> Yep.<eos> That's your stuff down here.<eos> What are you going to tell Gadge?<eos> I'll tell him I caught you doing heroin in the toilet, Kelly.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's something about immediacy which is really, really important, and what we're going to talk about now is the decisive moment.<eos> So, in 1952, when Cartier-Bresson produced his first book, it had a French title but the English translation was "the decisive moment".
Damaged?<eos> Destroyed.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> And-and what the hell is the Navy doing testing a missile in Marina Del Rey?<eos> Marina Del Rey?<eos> Yeah, that's where it's docked.<eos> Do you have any idea what that boat is worth?<eos> I did upgrades.<eos> Dr. Maslow, your boat wasn't at the marina.<eos> It was off the Ventura coastline.
Did you?<eos> Good.<eos> Stay with the hostages.<eos> Get me connected to the bank.<eos> Patch it through to NCIS Ops.<eos> You guys will get the feed in your comms.<eos> - I'll talk to 'em.<eos> Connect me.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Get your pizza in 20 minutes, or it's free.
It was here.<eos> It was on this road.<eos> She was on this road.<eos> Send the boys up and down the way, see if anybody saw her.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You expect me to believe that you hid my Grace in a library?<eos> Nobody goes to libraries anymore.<eos> It's the safest place in the world.<eos> I can feel my Grace.<eos> It's here, but you've hidden it somehow.
Mm. So I have even less dignity in that story. So that's the one we'll accept as true.<eos> "from a hairier part of your body and surgically implant them on your lip." I'm not doing that. But you're the perfect candidate.<eos> Back-stache, belly-stache. Hello?<eos> Butt-stache! Can we just...?<eos> Let Tina have the floor finally? Yes, because I know that even if there's no mustache that night, Mom and Dad would still fall in love because of fate, which is great!<eos> Remember?<eos> ! This is how you throw a shrimp! Ow!<eos> Done. They're in love. Everyone got that?<eos> Everyone clear?<eos> Uh... that doesn't sound right. Yeah, Dad makes a weird noise when he's hurt, and it's not attractive to women or anyone. It scares cats.
Oooh, I'm sorry booboo.<eos> I got carried away.<eos> Don't you worry your pretty little head.<eos> Doc.<eos> I don't feel so good.<eos> You got anything?<eos> You're just nervous, papa.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're gonna love that baby no matter what.<eos> Even if it looks like you.
I'd feel a whole lot better if they at least tried to kill us.<eos> Only in a messed up apocalypse was that the right thing to do.<eos> I see something!<eos> That is not a head.<eos> Yeah, but sometimes that happens, right?<eos> Sometimes they get turned around and they come out feet first, right?<eos> Uh yeah, but that's not a foot.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That baby's not waiting to get pushed out.<eos> It's pulling itself out.
You want to reconnect with that deadbeat?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Just don't come crying to me when it turns out he's still a jerk.<eos> It's go time.<eos> Hey. Where's the monster, Greg?<eos> - Show us.<eos> - There!<eos> - Where?<eos> - To the left!<eos> Where is it now?
It was a trap... - built for a very specific threat. - The Draugur.<eos> And since Howe was their commander, anyone that survived would try to rescue - their master's body.<eos> - And, in doing so, would be faced with their only weakness,<eos> Greek fire.<eos> Yeah, Brennan said it was just some kind of napalm.<eos> We'll get our hands on some.<eos> - Why would that pose a threat to the town?<eos> - Because Greek fire is far more sinister than your napalm.<eos> It cannot be extinguished by water or by sand.<eos> Once unleashed, it burns until nothing remains.
- Mm.<eos> Yes.<eos> December 1776, the Colonial troops were camped out in Pennsylvania after a harsh winter.<eos> Ah. "I was summoned by a woman "of exceeding bravery and fortitude.<eos> "A former seamstress who became Washington's most trusted wartime operative."<eos> Betsy Ross.<eos> Your ancestor and my trusted companion knew one another?<eos> No name's given, but it does sound like her.<eos> Well, read on, Lieutenant.<eos> "I entered the camp to find it gripped by a pall of fear and paranoia."
Revere holds the key.<eos> His account of the Eye features a series of seemingly arbitrary numbers in the marginalia.<eos> A Dumas code.<eos> Revere left a final encrypted entry the day following the death of young Jonathan.<eos> The energy of the Eye dispersed, leaving destruction in its wake.<eos> Yet the artifact itself, now freed from its hold on poor Jonathan, remained intact.<eos> Revere then used the staff from whence the Eye had come to draw it out.<eos> Now, Washington decreed the Eye too dangerous.<eos> 'Twas to be hidden, to prevent it - from falling into the wrong hands... - Hold on, hold on.<eos> That staff, it was like an Eye magnet?
- something... something...<eos> - Ya finished?<eos> Okay, first thing we need to do is set up camp for the night.<eos> We need dry wood for fire, we need fresh water, and we need someone on traps.<eos> - Snotlout, what is that?<eos> - It's an "S" for "Snotlout."<eos> I think aesthetically it would look nice flying over.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> It doesn't matter what the outpost looks like.<eos> It needs to be functional and operational.
Okay, I'm gonna stop you there.<eos> Ugh.<eos> Okay, fine, let's just check this out so we could all go back to sleep.<eos> Okay, when this giant beast rips us limb from limb, I will expect a full apology from each and every one of you.<eos> And a handshake.<eos> No, you won't be able to shake hands 'cause your limbs will be gone.<eos> Shh.<eos> Aaah!<eos> No!<eos> It was here, and it was huge.
Right.<eos> When exactly did you start having trouble with it?<eos> A few weeks ago.<eos> We didn't even know it was on the island.<eos> And then suddenly it was everywhere.<eos> First is just went after wild dragons, then it started coming after us.<eos> And how many dragons has it killed?<eos> None yet.<eos> This dragon is more than strong.<eos> It's fast, it's smart and it's elusive.
Yes, it does.<eos> Look at the two of us...<eos> two Viking men on the hunt, scheming to catch a wild beast.<eos> See?<eos> You're cheering up already, right?<eos> Let's not get ahead of ourselves, son.<eos> There!<eos> You see what I mean?<eos> Every time, we just miss it.<eos> Well, we didn't see it fly away, so it has to be on foot.
These footprints are fresh.<eos> We should be right on top of it.<eos> It's like the beast can sense us coming, and then it changes direction.<eos> A truly worthy adversary.<eos> We have got to be getting close.<eos> Ah, I don't think so.<eos> We've been here before.<eos> Look at the broken branches on this side of the trail.<eos> The beast has doubled back on us.<eos> Wait, you think it knows we're hunting it?

And why isn't the Rumblehorn following us?<eos> Because it's following him.<eos> Mr. Boar, come back, please.<eos> I just want to have a friendly chat.<eos> Let's get his attention, bud.<eos> Aha ha!<eos> Stormfly, spine shot!<eos> Hyah!<eos> For as powerful as that dragon is, he doesn't seem to have a real thirst for blood.<eos> Not yet, but it's still going after Gobber.
- Dagur.<eos> - It makes sense.<eos> If Dagur has a dragon and is attacking ships,<eos> - then who's to say we won't be next?<eos> - Hiccup!<eos> You got to see this.<eos> Those are some deep gashes.<eos> Any idea what it could be?<eos> This dragon is extremely powerful.<eos> It has the slashing attack of a Speed Stinger yet from the depth of the strikes it appears to be as strong as a Typhoomerang.
And let the game begin.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Let me see.<eos> I'm thinking you two are muttonheads.<eos> Yes!<eos> I win!<eos> I was actually thinking, if we find the dragon, we find the rider.<eos> And I have a pretty good idea of how we can find the dragon.<eos> Sharp!<eos> Did I say that it's sharp?
Yes!<eos> I win!<eos> I was actually thinking, if we find the dragon, we find the rider.<eos> And I have a pretty good idea of how we can find the dragon.<eos> Sharp!<eos> Did I say that it's sharp?<eos> I know, Bucket.<eos> We've gone over that 20 times.<eos> Well, it's got a very long tail.<eos> And it can tie itself into a knot.
- Yes, but I don't remember much.<eos> It was so long ago.<eos> Just a few pictures in my mind.<eos> I remember my father's hands.<eos> They were rough, like sandstone, but so gentle.<eos> And I remember the smell of his wooden shield.<eos> I don't think I was supposed to play with it, but he let me anyway.<eos> And this.<eos> He gave me this horn.<eos> I don't know if it means something, but whenever I look at it, I think of him.
Subtitles by DramaFever<eos> Ah... good to see you too.<eos> Hand over the key.<eos> Stop playing around.<eos> - What?<eos> - Hand over the key!<eos> What key?<eos> Why, you...<eos> Where is it?
Every breath is an effort for him.<eos> I don't know whether to make him warm or keep him cool.<eos> Well, we will...<eos> We will remain here until he is well.<eos> Father.<eos> Will the child die?<eos> Can you save him?<eos> There is a way.<eos> Though, it is not a good way.<eos> If it is the only way, then you must.
Kicks like a mule, doesn't it?<eos> Here.<eos> This should help.<eos> Plenty more where that came from.<eos> My friends and I could help with your daylight ring situation, as well.<eos> Ok.<eos> Now you have my attention.<eos> Marcel Gerard, you were turned by an original, yet you made yourself in your own image.<eos> You built a vampire community from ash, and this city thrived under your rule.<eos> Let us help you return New Orleans to what it should be with you as its king.
I got some gear in the back, in case shit hits the fan.<eos> But it won't, because we ain't gonna throw it.<eos> - Then when do we attack?<eos> - When the time is right.<eos> And when will that be?<eos> What was that?<eos> Okay, that's one tall glass with ice, two shots of vodka, Tabasco sauce, and one celery stalk.<eos> You're an angel.<eos> I think you're missing a key ingredient there, mister.<eos> It'll come soon enough.
You will all fall... one by friend, one by foe, and one by family.<eos> Klaus: The lady Aurora, she is exquisite.<eos> I'll be in New Orleans shortly.<eos> Don't start the party without me.<eos> Klaus, voice-over: I never meant for you to know me.<eos> I never meant to let you in...<eos> But then I should not have kissed you...<eos> Not the first time...<eos> Certainly not the second...<eos> But there is a light in you so bright, it makes me feel like the man I wish I was...
The next is the wealthy Kamoda.<eos> Let's go .<eos> 8 7 6 5, 4, 3...<eos> What a pity!<eos> You've broken the record, there<eos> It is shielded<eos> No, nothing.<eos> We will remain good friends.<eos> What can we do, Light?<eos> It goes again... Kamoda. You're gonna give me 300,000 yen tomorrow.
- Holy hell. - Sir!<eos> Hold you fire!<eos> What's going on?<eos> I have brokered a peace agreement between the giant spiders and the government.<eos> Thanks to the skilled diplomacy of this mysterious space car, from this day forward, human- and spiderkind will live side by side in peace.<eos> We will stop bombing them, and they will no longer use their telepathic abilities to make us wander into webs for later consumption.<eos> Instead, we will work together to make this world a better place for all, no matter how many legs.<eos> What do we do about the space car?<eos> Leave it alone.<eos> I mean, what did it really do, anyways?
What the hell? Jesus!<eos> There's flies in my ice cream.<eos> Presidential decree--<eos> All ice cream is now for all beings, no matter how many legs.<eos> - What the [bleep] did you do, Summer? ! - It was your ship!<eos> - Your stupid ship did it!<eos> - Don't blame my ship!<eos> - It melted a child!<eos> - My ship doesn't do anything...<eos> - It killed it itself!
Look at his art, Morty.<eos> I've got an emo streak.<eos> It's part of what makes me so rad.<eos> Why does it say "help me Morty and Summer!"?<eos> Come on, Summer, that's the title of the art.<eos> Why was knight rider called knight rider?<eos> The car's name was kitt.<eos> Nobody rode Michael knight.<eos> I'm tiny Rick!<eos> Grandpa, I think that, when you put your mind into this body's young brain, it did what young brains do...
's "Feels Good" plays ] - [screaming] - ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah ♪<eos> ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> ♪ I feel it all in my soul ♪<eos> ♪ It feels good ♪<eos> Geez. Wow, Morty. Now you're getting into it.<eos> Never expected that out of you.<eos> All right, uh, let's go find my ship.<eos> Hey, hey, Morty, Morty.<eos> There it is down there - - My ship.
I'll relieve you after midnight.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Syphilis.<eos> You had this before?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - When?<eos> Um... some years back.<eos> I passed it on.<eos> Not knowingly.<eos> I thought it had gone.
You have a duty to say what you know.<eos> Let the dead bury the dead.<eos> What if they won't stay buried?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where you once failed, he now succeeds.<eos> The dead live, Mrs. Shelley.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> - You must.<eos> This nightmare is your creation.<eos> It's not mine any more.

I told you, when you're married, not before.<eos> With respect, we discussed it last night.<eos> She wants to come back now.<eos> And I've given you my decision.<eos> I'm thinking of you, Nightingale.<eos> And I'm thinking of her, sir.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Her safety, sir.<eos> I'll need that gun, too, sir, if I may.<eos> It's in my name.
Wow.<eos> - What have you got?<eos> Um, we got the tox screen back.<eos> And you are not gonna believe this.<eos> Are you familiar with the PKM-zeta inhibitor commonly known as ZIP?<eos> Doctor, you and I have very different ideas of what "commonly" means.<eos> Zeta Interacting Protein.<eos> It's an experimental drug being tested with PTSD sufferers.<eos> Wreck victims, soldiers who've seen combat...<eos> Used sparingly, it can erase selected memories.
Because I'm a grinder?<eos> Here's the thing, Jack.<eos> When you took on Harvey, You pitted the grinders against the rainmakers, And that was a good move,<eos> But you want to move to the next level? We need to be both grinders and rainmakers.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying that we need to revisit The compensation agreement.<eos> No way.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because when we get this business, It will be worth a fortune to us.
Tell me.<eos> Listen, I'm starving.<eos> Can we find a place to eat and talk about it there?<eos> So...<eos> So...<eos> You know I'm bipolar.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that I take lithium.<eos> Which is good for me.<eos> It keeps me... safe and sane.
Wait a minute, we just lost two screens-- what's going on?<eos> - GPS is down.<eos> - Audio, too.<eos> She's about to go inside.<eos> We need that audio.<eos> See if you can get the satellite to reboot the transmitter.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's gone dark.<eos> - Because it's not receiving a signal.
And... oh, my God, you downloaded the Dunkin' Donuts app?<eos> And who Shazams the Beatles?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Have fun with your little robot.<eos> But if you ask me, this whole thing is more disturbing than a dump after a beet salad.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Okay, Lois, I dabbed some toothpaste on the inside of my nose, so...<eos> I am willing to take the old "Nestea plunge," if you know what I mean.<eos> I guess what I'm saying is, time to break in the new mattress, eh?<eos> Peter, it's brand-new.
Ok, now I'm worried.<eos> He said he had some big announcement to make.<eos> Oh, my God, wait, where is it?<eos> Why aren't you wearing it?<eos> Wearing what?<eos> What is that you wanted to tell us?<eos> And why are you telling us here?<eos> Remember this office?<eos> Yes. This was Sebastian blood's campaign office.<eos> And now it's mine.
Do you remember Papp Stadium?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I loved the popcorn.<eos> Every time a Sentinels player hit a homer, every single person in that stadium stood and cheered.<eos> Every single one.<eos> United.<eos> And I wanted to run for mayor because I wanted to be the leader of that city.<eos> Wanted?<eos> Thea, I don't know if that city exists anymore.<eos> I think that it might be beyond saving.
Easiest way to get a lot of followers on social media is to own a very successful club.<eos> All I had to do was tell them what I've already known for 3 years.<eos> Oliver Queen is going to save this city.<eos> What's this? This your speech.<eos> You're announcing your candidacy this afternoon, so you better get your suit out of moth balls.<eos> Did you write this?<eos> I wrote it down. Just with what you told me, about this city being united.<eos> United.<eos> That's what this city used to be.<eos> It's what it can be.

You mean about your stupid column?<eos> - Well, maybe.<eos> - So yesterday's news.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Tell me about Denis.<eos> - The guy who drives the bus?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Well, I saw the bus today.<eos> Not where I thought it would be.
The Speed Force doesn't work like that.<eos> It's not something you can create in a lab.<eos> How do you think you became The Flash, Garrick?<eos> By me and a lab.<eos> Science is what did this to you, to Barry, to Zoom, and science is what we need to stop Zoom, and this is our only option.<eos> Find another one.<eos> The Speed Force can't be replicated or enhanced.<eos> It's a living thing.<eos> It's a gift that was given to me.<eos> That drug... you have no idea what it's gonna do.
Every access point is protected by a retinal scanner, and a voice print.<eos> There is no way we're getting in there.<eos> Well, not from the outside, at least.<eos> How's Curtis doing on the resizing device?<eos> He said he could have something functional in an hour.<eos> I don't think we have that kind of time.<eos> He's going to have to assemble it in the field.<eos> Wait, with us?<eos> Are we sure we want to have your assistant in on this?<eos> It's my employee, actually. And I'm not sure our company health plan covers supernatural dismemberment.
Obsessed.<eos> Phesmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe.<eos> Phesmatos exaud mi, conjug spiritis et corpe.<eos> Scratch that one off the list.<eos> Hey! You're not the only one banking on this.<eos> It's not for me, Ric.<eos> Why does everything have to be about me today?<eos> Will both of you just shut up?<eos> The stone works.<eos> I think it's creating a bridge between the body and the spirit.
Ric lied to you.<eos> I just kept my mouth shut.<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm not gonna be stuck in the middle of this.<eos> No, no.<eos> You sort this out.<eos> I'm gonna go find our bargaining chip.<eos> So the visions, the lost time, the crippling headaches, they don't mean anything, doesn't matter to you?<eos> Oh, of course, they matter, but bringing Jo back matters more.<eos> You don't even know what this stone does, if it will work.
Oh, God, I hate whiners.<eos> Agh...<eos> Uh!<eos> Oh...<eos> Now...<eos> Deep breath.<eos> Ugh!<eos> Leaving so soon?<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm wearing your jacket, though it's a little large on me.
She wanted to make you pay for refusing to help rescue us from the prison world.<eos> Screw Julian.<eos> I'll kill you.<eos> Vis porta.<eos> Spelling the door?<eos> Thought you were leading us to a secret passage.<eos> You watch too much "Scooby-Doo."<eos> Maybe he'll tire himself out and we just go out the front door. Or I could just jump out this window while you fend for yourself.<eos> First, give me that stone back.<eos> First, tell me why it's so special.
Julian needs to die today.<eos> Everything has to appear to be normal.<eos> Julian's not an idiot.<eos> If he finds out that Lily turned on him, we're all dead.<eos> So you embed her with a psychopath.<eos> Sounds logical.<eos> Hey, don't look at me; I voted to drive a stake through her heart and get rid of this<eos> Julian mama drama once and for all.<eos> But, hey, complicated plan "A" sounds like a happy compromise.<eos> It's not complicated.
Let me guess.<eos> Hot cocoa and vervain.<eos> Close.<eos> Bourbon.<eos> I'm sorry I was harsh earlier.<eos> I heard you listened to Valerie and that you sided with Lily against Julian.<eos> I mean, you must be attempting to turn over a new leaf, and you clearly don't have anyone else.<eos> Lovely.<eos> A pity friend, just what I always wanted.<eos> College can be lonely and terrible, or it can be fun.
Tell me, are you the one to bring it out of him, the frail, little human that he has manipulated, abused, and compelled to be everything from stenographer to spy?<eos> He doesn't care about you, darling.<eos> You're just a thing that he uses from time to time.<eos> That's all.<eos> You can say whatever you want...<eos> I can't stop you...<eos> But I do find it interesting how angry you are.<eos> I think you're worried.<eos> If there's anything that Klaus likes about me, it's my mind, that I can understand him, and you, you are beautiful, and you are powerful, and you do have a long history together, but you're worried he doesn't love you, that maybe he does see the truth...<eos> That your mind, it's a bit damaged, isn't it?
No, but it's only a matter of time.<eos> With him, there is always a cost.<eos> The toll always comes due.<eos> Anyway... it's not my decision to make, it's ours.<eos> Well, he's your father.<eos> But as you said, we are a team.<eos> You deserve a chance to meet the man, find out if Morland Holmes is someone you want to be indebted to.<eos> I find the Chinese character suspicious, don't you?<eos> Not their national fiber... the marking on this note.<eos> It means "beautiful."
"There will be no end "to the troubles of humanity until philosophers become kings."<eos> Actually, we're not acolytes, we're detectives.<eos> And I'm with Churchill, I'm afraid.<eos> "Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others."<eos> We were wondering where you were three nights ago, around 9:00 p.m.<eos> This is about what happened in Gail's lab.<eos> There's evidence that suggests that you wanted to use her algorithm to push your ideas online.<eos> I was here.<eos> I was hosting a seminar on Thomas Carlyle.<eos> It started at 7:00 and ended at 10:00.
I was hosting a seminar on Thomas Carlyle.<eos> It started at 7:00 and ended at 10:00.<eos> There are over a dozen witnesses who will vouch for me.<eos> You know something, Mr. Antonov.<eos> And why would I help a tool of a bloated and dying empire?<eos> Because you don't wish to be doxxed as a public servant?<eos> I mean, what would your followers think if they realized you suckled at government's teat?<eos> Look, you have the wrong idea.<eos> No one would have killed Gail for that algorithm.<eos> It didn't work.
Nice.<eos> Well. Okay.<eos> - Well written, accurate.<eos> Moving, even, in the right hands.<eos> It is in the right hands.<eos> Maybe reads a little bit like a victory lap.<eos> Well...<eos> I'd say you've earned it.<eos> If I did, we all did.<eos> What's insidious about terrorism is... it can get inside our heads, make us change the way we live our lives.
- Yes.<eos> I killed a Gelumcaedus right where you're standing.<eos> And Chavez died right here.<eos> Ground is still wet.<eos> Wait a minute<eos> Are you saying somebody came back here, took all the bodies and cleaned up all the blood?<eos> Somebody went to a lot of trouble to cover this up.<eos> Just like they did with Juliette.<eos> This is Chavez' phone.<eos> It rang right after she died.
Just, uh, open the safe, Jimmy.<eos> Go ahead, Jimmy.<eos> Take as much as you want.<eos> You know, in a year or two, weed's gonna be just like gum, sitting right there at the grocery store at the checkout line.<eos> Transport, distro... it's all gonna be legal.<eos> Business comes and goes.<eos> Why diversification is important.<eos> That's why we need to talk about that China white you bringing in.<eos> Well, I'm getting out of that business.<eos> It's dirty.
I'm not getting old.<eos> Ubba.<eos> I have seen the land outside the city.<eos> I have a plan in mind.<eos> A good plan.<eos> And my son would like to whet his sword with you.<eos> So do we fight?<eos> Storri?<eos> The signs are good.<eos> Only this morning, I saw a raven fly towards the Saxon camp, and it was asking me to follow.
I should really take your balls for this desecration.<eos> - Yes, lor... no, Lord, please.<eos> - I don't care for you, your wife, your children, nor your whore.<eos> Lord, he made me do it with the promise of a coin.<eos> It was false promise, Lord.<eos> I have no coin.<eos> I'll need a fresh horse, food, and drink.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Your horse was returned.<eos> It's in the stable.
Bible study every Sunday.<eos> I know my saints.<eos> Believe you me...<eos> I'm gonna be calling on St. Jude to get me out of this mess.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's he the saint of?<eos> Desperate cases.<eos> Well, he's definitely your guy.<eos> Tell me... how do you account for the cocaine that was found in the vehicle registered to your name?<eos> I don't... know how it could've got there, man... really.
I have so much to live for because of you.<eos> * You're sweeter than the taste * - * of honey * - Don't breathe.<eos> - I'm trying.<eos> - Don't talk.<eos> * And I'm so glad * - * that you're mine * - Babe.<eos> The police think you're dead.<eos> We need to use that to our advantage.<eos> - * You're sweeter than the chance * - Why... why don't we get out of town?<eos> I have a plan, and it doesn't include running.<eos> It involves you staying very, very still.
Evacuate the garage.<eos> Turn off the ventilators and seal it.<eos> We're clear.<eos> Yeah, Morgan.<eos> Hotch, there's no one in the Van.<eos> It's a mannequin with a yellow shirt.<eos> Copy that.<eos> We need to evacuate the facility.<eos> There's over a thousand people here.<eos> Once sarin vaporizes, it's deadly in the immediate environment, but it's heavier than air, so eventually it sinks.
That's an interesting combination of meds.<eos> Those are typically used to treat a hormone imbalance.<eos> It sounds to me like dana has polycystic ovary syndrome.<eos> It can cause obesity, excess hair growth, acne, and depression.<eos> PCOS is fairly common in teen girls and young women.<eos> It sadly affects one in 10 women of reproductive age.<eos> The good news is it's treatable.<eos> Ok, but it's PCOS. It didn't turn Dana into a killer.<eos> I'm not saying that.<eos> I'm just saying it might have contributed to her becoming depressed.
Help!<eos> Okay, listen!<eos> Listen! I'm gonna get help, all right?<eos> Help is on the way.<eos> ESU, airbag and bus needed at 20 Washington Square.<eos> Okay, when I say reach, reach with one hand.<eos> All right?<eos> All right, reach!<eos> You gotta get rid of the bag.<eos> It's too heavy.
God, it's...<eos> It's not that at all, and I'm sorry.<eos> Whatever you wanna do...<eos> I'll be with you every single step of the way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, I still wanna go to Italy, you know, weigh my options, and we can just decide when I get back.<eos> I'll be waiting here when you do.<eos> Leave if you don't want to see me pee.<eos> You're leaving tomorrow and you don't know where your passport is?<eos> I'm pretty sure it's at my mom's house.
No, you go first.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause you look a little dirty.<eos> Yeah, well, you look... wow.<eos> Did Kelly throw up on you?<eos> Sort of.<eos> I'll be quick.<eos> That tunnel must be filthy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did you find out where it goes?
It worked!<eos> - You're alive!<eos> - Aye. It did.<eos> After spending centuries quelling my bloodlust, you threw me right back into that darkness!<eos> Job well-done, Emma!<eos> Binding you to Excalibur was the only way to save you.<eos> Right, Excalibur.<eos> And where is my shiny new tether?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It disappeared right after you did.
- Roman!<eos> - Keep going.<eos> I only ran 'cause y'all started running.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why'd you shoot?<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> You're gonna need a dentist.<eos> Hey, give me your hands. I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Where's the gun?<eos> Huh? Where is it?
You ever just get that feeling?<eos> All the time, but then again, I work with this guy, so...<eos> How well do you know Darren Woodhull?<eos> Ah, keeps to himself.<eos> Freak like that... got no right drawing breath.<eos> Think he knows it.<eos> No secrets here in Rogers Park.<eos> Hey, Jay!<eos> Searched the interior.<eos> It's clean enough.
How's he end up in his freezer?<eos> So...<eos> Ray Malone.<eos> Ray, uh...<eos> Ray was the guy with the worst luck in the world.<eos> He had lymphoma, maybe two months to live.<eos> You know, when we grew up, we were tight... me, Richard, and Ray.<eos> Not quite a crew, but, uh... We weren't exactly saints.<eos> One night... this is maybe, uh, 18 years ago... they were hanging out behind Ray's house<eos> checking out Ray's dad's gun, and it went off.
I need you to be my date at a family event.<eos> Roxie said parents love you because you're completely non-threatening and borderline asexual.<eos> Wow. No, I'm not going with you.<eos> How's that for borderline asexual?<eos> -(sighs) How do you open the wine?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> - (Patti yelps) - Roxie: Oh, I got it.<eos> -Did that just spill on my couch?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Don't worry about the couch. It'll dry up long before we do.
The rash actions of Kindzi has made that abundantly clear.<eos> Where exactly is Kindzi?<eos> I do not wish to discuss it.<eos> Tell me this at least...<eos> Am I in any danger?<eos> Kindzi is in no position to hurt you or anyone else.<eos> Irisa? Where's Nolan?<eos> He didn't come home last night. We have a situation.<eos> There is a large island. It is called Australia.<eos> It is remote and uninhabited.
Oh, man.<eos> We've got to go help.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> You're awake.<eos> What happened?<eos> Emotions, feelings happened.<eos> And then you slipped and hit your head.<eos> Not your finest hour.<eos> Want to see my finest hour?<eos> It's around here somewhere.
So Crane found old paper, but the ink is fake.<eos> No, the ink is iron gall from iron salts and tannic acids.<eos> Which was the standard in Europe from the fifth to the 19th century.<eos> But the signature is fake?<eos> I compared it pixel by pixel to Washington's signature on the Constitution.<eos> The slant and spacing show that it's a perfect match.<eos> Looks like I owe Mr. Crane an apology.<eos> Not yet. I also examined the handwriting of the officer that Washington was dictating to.<eos> And?<eos> It's an exact match to the notes that Ichabod Crane took when he was deciphering The Book of Shadows, here in the lab.
As it turns out, Howe's skull is the murder weapon.<eos> We found it in the waste from the anatomy lab.<eos> Based on the fractured occipital, it appears the killer held the skull like so.<eos> Our best bet would have been to find trace evidence in General Howe's canine.<eos> However, it was knocked out during the murder and we can't find it.<eos> Because it came loose. He was thrown by a wild stallion he was trying to tame after he took control of the British forces.<eos> Wouldn't a man of his stature have used false teeth?<eos> Iron, or ivory, or animal teeth?<eos> Oh, he tried those. Then he learned the French had developed porcelain teeth.<eos> If Howe's canine was porcelain, it would have shattered on impact, possibly injuring the killer's hand.
Oh, he tried those. Then he learned the French had developed porcelain teeth.<eos> If Howe's canine was porcelain, it would have shattered on impact, possibly injuring the killer's hand.<eos> Mr. Crane brought to my attention that we made a faulty assumption.<eos> We didn't account for the magical powers of the skull?<eos> No, we didn't account for the fact that the missing tooth isn't a tooth.<eos> So, he had a false tooth?<eos> Yes.<eos> Made of porcelain. If the tooth scraped the killer's hand...<eos> There's a significant possibility of recovering epithelial cells.<eos> But if Howe had a porcelain tooth, where is it now?
Made of porcelain. If the tooth scraped the killer's hand...<eos> There's a significant possibility of recovering epithelial cells.<eos> But if Howe had a porcelain tooth, where is it now?<eos> Porcelain.<eos> The coffee cup. I-I have all of these pieces of a broken coffee cup.<eos> The porcelain could have easily gotten mixed in there.<eos> Dr. Hodgins, go over that piece again here.<eos> Its hue doesn't match the others. SAROYAN:<eos> You're right. And it's got a pointed cusp and single root like a canine.<eos> Bet it was nice and shiny, back in the day.
38-year-old male.<eos> Unconscious, labored breathing...<eos> He's uremic.<eos> Kidney failure.<eos> I know this guy.<eos> Let's get him set up for an I-stat.<eos> - We need his electrolyte levels.<eos> - Yes, doctor.<eos> What are we most concerned about in renal failure?<eos> Potassium... if it's too high, it could be toxic for his heart or put him into arrest.
Should be doing better than that.<eos> Maybe it's inaccurate.<eos> She came in with hyperthermia.<eos> Oral thermometer showed her at 108 degrees.<eos> I tried to get a line in to infuse fluids, but she keeps bleeding out at the site.<eos> 10 units of FFP, a 6-pack of platelets, and 10 units of cryoprecipitate.<eos> What's the one organ that cannot survive heat?<eos> Blood.<eos> And what happens to blood protein when it's heated for extended periods?<eos> - It denatures... melts, basically.
You wanna let go of my arm now?<eos> !<eos> That's a bad play, Tash.<eos> One more day, I'll have your money.<eos> You better, 'cause the next time, the conversation ends different.<eos> A breakthrough?<eos> It was a dream.<eos> Your first dream, which you considered significant enough to mention to me.<eos> A sex dream.<eos> So what does it mean?
Figure out that steganography yet?<eos> What?<eos> The black square on your shoulder.<eos> Steganography?<eos> Steganography, of course.<eos> Can you fill the rest of us in?<eos> It's a... a method of concealing messages in innocuous images.<eos> It's used by spy services, terrorists... it dates back to the Ancient Greeks.<eos> So the black isn't just covering the Navy SEAL tattoo underneath.<eos> Oh, well, that's the thing, it's not all black.
I can't!<eos> Do it!<eos> Hey!<eos> You want her?<eos> Come get her!<eos> Shoot the power line.<eos> Anytime, Hank.<eos> I think it worked.<eos> Is it dead?<eos> It's not moving.
Yeah, I filled out his business school applications.<eos> Yep, essays too.<eos> - Wow, awesome joke, Eli.<eos> - He's smart, Mom, he is.<eos> He's just... you know, he's Teddy.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I don't think that we should be getting engaged right now...<eos> Then it happened.<eos> The scales fell from my eyes.<eos> Your brain is a miracle, but it's not efficient.
Seems like voodoo to me.<eos> Well... what's happening?<eos> What is it, Dixie?<eos> The... the cards, they're-they're blurry.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Okay, I-I'm stopping the infusion.<eos> It's getting worse.<eos> - I'll page radiology.<eos> - Is it the polio?<eos> Is it inside her?
So much for getting in front of it.<eos> JACKSON: We've contacted every outlet that got the query.<eos> If they make the purchase, they'll feel the full force of the Executive Branch.<eos> But isn't Harrison enough of a public figure that they can claim fair use?<eos> Not if I have anything to do with it.<eos> Half an hour ago, I thought Maria Ostrov was the only thing that could hijack the news cycle and run down our poll numbers.<eos> You thinking this is another hack, like Air Force One?<eos> This wasn't a hack.<eos> The president's son lost his phone last week, didn't bother to tell anybody.<eos> Didn't it have a-a password or...?
Has he ever bought us a juice?<eos> No, and we bought him a car.<eos> Schiller, dude, give me a life boost.<eos> Schiller, I'll have the life boost as well.<eos> Schiller.<eos> Am I saying that right?<eos> Schiller.<eos> Will you be in class tomorrow?<eos> I'd love to see your flying lotus.<eos> My lotus only has a one-day pass, and it doesn't fly, it takes the bus.
- Hey, hey!<eos> - I wouldn't do that, Kate.<eos> - Scott...<eos> Holy shit, you shot me!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Open up, rinchesito!<eos> It's too late, Carlos.<eos> Your boss already took the key.<eos> It is useless without the map.
Fair to whom?<eos> To... whomever comes next.<eos> This is getting cold. Carter's lunch.<eos> Uh, I will check on those credentials for the train launch.<eos> Agents are positioned around the perimeter.<eos> I have commandeered the security cameras at the station, but there's no sign of Knox.<eos> Sounds like you could use some help.<eos> Are you sure you're up for this?<eos> Somebody's gotta protect that train.<eos> And once it gets moving, even the DEO won't be able to keep up with it.
Kara, you can say no to this.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to show her...<eos> Him, that I can be a team player.<eos> That my cousin and I can be trusted.<eos> Wait, does the robot fight mean that game night is canceled?<eos> No! No!<eos> Game night is the last shred of normalcy that remains in our crime stopping, alien hunting, DEO hacking lives.<eos> Game night survives.<eos> It has to.
How else could they be brother and sister, right?<eos> I mean, how else could you guys be a family?<eos> This all goes back to Posta.<eos> Sí.<eos> I was there.<eos> I saw the killings.<eos> I saw what Silva did to my friends.<eos> But he-he thought I was beautiful, so... he spared my life and... my daughter's life.<eos> That's why the test didn't find a match.<eos> It only compared the DNA to the victims.
Let me rule on the objections.<eos> Overruled.<eos> Mrs. Banner, the doctors here at the defense table said that your daughter was terminal. They were wrong.<eos> A week before they prescribed those suicide drugs,<eos> Duke University announced a new treatment for glioblastoma tumors.<eos> Let me help you with those, Mr. Canning.<eos> And what was that treatment?<eos> The polio virus.<eos> It's introduced into the tumorous brain cells so it won't reproduce in the healthy ones.<eos> It destroys the tumor.
But why that would be of interest to the police, uh...<eos> Must be frustrating when politicians pander to their base by making it difficult to obtain suitable cells.<eos> Enough to purchase excess embryos from Abby.<eos> I have papers to grade.<eos> It is, of course, illegal to obtain embryos without the consent of the potential parent that provided that genetic material.<eos> We can get a warrant.<eos> If the DNA of the cells from your lab match the patients from Abby's clinic, then that's a federal crime.<eos> I'm trying to save lives.<eos> Diabetes is a plague.<eos> It kills over four million people a year.
I had some makeup on before that was surprisingly difficult to wash off.<eos> Been there.<eos> So, you know I'm referring to your beard as Princess Sparkles from now on though, right?<eos> Why would you be referring to my beard?<eos> "You've got some crumbs stuck in Princess Sparkles."<eos> Or, "Princess Sparkles could use a trim."<eos> So, how's work going on the cure?<eos> I can't make any progress without tainted Utopium.<eos> I've run tests on regular Utopium, but, to be honest, I know very little about how the drug works.<eos> I mean, it's relatively new, there aren't studies.
Zac needed me to get his idea out of his head and into virtually every computer processor on the planet.<eos> You hadn't had a big idea in over a decade.<eos> You used him.<eos> Used him?<eos> I helped him.<eos> Zac was lost without me.<eos> He would hyper-focus on one thing and ignore everyone and everything else.<eos> He was constantly losing his keys, his wallet, phone.<eos> You know where his phone is?<eos> No, but it doesn't surprise me that it's missing.
W-wait.<eos> That means I paid for it.<eos> To closing the case.<eos> To generous expense accounts.<eos> So, any progress with Beckett?<eos> You know, at the prison, we, um, sort of had a moment.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think my plan is working.<eos> I mean, it has to, right?
He's still alive?<eos> Not for long.<eos> He's perfect then.<eos> Doctor.<eos> You have your volunteer.<eos> All ready, my queen.<eos> My friends.<eos> We stand on the precipice of a major scientific discovery.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a New World Order.
He kidnapped my wife, my baby girl.<eos> It's him.<eos> I'm gonna do you a favor.<eos> Shot them right there in front of me.<eos> Warren.<eos> My savior.<eos> The zombie plague is over.<eos> I have the cure.<eos> Remember this day.<eos> For it will mark the beginning of a Zero World Order.
He wants to carry the torch and continue his work.<eos> "Carry the torch"?<eos> - Richards' words, not mine.<eos> - Yeah, but there's nothing in here about some direct plan to bust Duclair out of jail, is there?<eos> Right, but hold on a second-- we don't have Duclair's letters to Richards going out of Halawa, right?<eos> We only have one side of the conversation.<eos> Right.<eos> So I'm guessing that Duclair was calling the shots on his own escape. I'm with him.<eos> Let's get a warrant for Richards' place, see if we can find those letters.<eos> It's just an office, Danny, it's an office.
What are you talking about?<eos> Take a look.<eos> See?<eos> Different frames.<eos> When the painting was originally stolen, the frame was brass.<eos> This is wood.<eos> Okay, so the pirates changed it.<eos> But why would they go through the trouble?<eos> I think the key to finding this treasure isn't the painting.<eos> It's the frame. Uh-huh.
Morwenna!<eos> Come in here!<eos> Your heartbeat is very irregular.<eos> Last month, the specialist gave my heart an electric shock to fix it.<eos> Well, it didn't.<eos> You had better go back again.<eos> Put some gloves on.<eos> Take your hands out of the way, please.<eos> Morwenna, hold that.<eos> Ah. Is it broken?
_<eos> You really made us work for our paychecks today.<eos> Solomon, you don't have to be afraid any more.<eos> We're NSA.<eos> We are the good guys.<eos> You have heard of prism, haven't you?<eos> We need your help, Solomon.<eos> Our engineers realized you were trying to debug a program, not infect it.<eos> Did you find the virus?<eos> W-Was it still in the directory?
Put your hands up and leave 'em up.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Leave 'em up!<eos> Don't!<eos> Clear!<eos> Detonator secured.<eos> Ammonium Nitrate, Diesel fuel wrapped in Tovex.<eos> Big boom, but it's easy to disarm.<eos> There's a timer.<eos> It's a failsafe.
But in the interest of precision...<eos> I'm an engineer, after all... there's one thing you're wrong about.<eos> Taurus didn't kill Stephen Fisher?<eos> We don't think so.<eos> He took the job.<eos> He planted the chip and the detonator and then he hid a Bluetooth transmitter under a newspaper kiosk on Fulton.<eos> And this somehow adds up to him not doing it?<eos> Fisher's accident happened a mile before he would have driven past the Bluetooth.<eos> - The chip was never triggered.<eos> - So it went off by mistake.
That's you.<eos> See the birthmark?<eos> That virus your lab made, it's a massive breakthrough.<eos> And there's no way you destroyed your research, which means... the proof that you did this is somewhere in the building.<eos> This meeting is an opportunity for you to give us those files.<eos> If you don't, we can take that picture to a judge and get a warrant, but then you've lost your only chance to cooperate.<eos> You'll be facing three charges of murder.<eos> If you can get a judge to believe that's me, you have evidence of what?<eos> The fact that I used an aerosol can?<eos> The virus, if it exists, leaves no trace of itself behind.
Ever since I killed Weston Steward, and Chavez found Nick's Grimm book on my bed.<eos> They've been watching you too. Me?<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you're a hexenbiest.<eos> Was.<eos> Yeah, they know about that too, and about your baby.<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> No, they don't want your kid.<eos> Tell me about that motorcycle.<eos> It's mine.
Yeah, they know about that too, and about your baby.<eos> They wouldn't.<eos> No, they don't want your kid.<eos> Tell me about that motorcycle.<eos> It's mine.<eos> You want to show me?<eos> Sure.<eos> So, they gave it to me, like, six months after I started.<eos> It's not normal.<eos> It does all kinds of things.
There's one here and one in the upper abdominal region.<eos> I also found several small nicks to the cortical bone on the left tenth and 11th ribs.<eos> Knife wounds to the chest could mean the victim was stabbed to death.<eos> The predation seems particularly aggressive in the regions closest to the stab wound.<eos> It's possible the blood from the wound drew the fish to those areas first.<eos> I'll take a Mikrosil mold of the nicks to see if I can identify the weapon that caused it.<eos> You may not need to.<eos> The tip of the knife.<eos> It's lodged in the victim's tenth rib.<eos> Yeah, it probably broke off during the stabbing.
No.<eos> You would have been hyper-focused on looking for him, so any movement would have caught your eye.<eos> What did you see?<eos> Just a car.<eos> What kind of car?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just a car.<eos> Play it over in your mind slowly.<eos> Is there anything about the car that stood out?<eos> It was gray.
Which may have led to a murder.<eos> When's the last time you saw Lindsay?<eos> Uh... Couple weeks ago, we did an interview for the documentary's DVD extras.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You've done what?<eos> Two movies since your documentary with Lindsay?<eos> Three if you count my short.<eos> You've still got her pictures up?<eos> The film was my baby.<eos> It holds a very special place in my heart.
Did you ever talk to the neighbors about their band practice?<eos> _<eos> I wanted to throw a rock through the window.<eos> _<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ooh, okay.<eos> She's back.<eos> You're on a deserted island with nothing but a blanket, a packed lunch and a gazebo.<eos> There's only one guy there.<eos> Who is it?
Finish processing the car.<eos> Hello, people that work even lower underground than I do.<eos> Hello, Abby.<eos> Yeah, to what do we owe the pleasure?<eos> I found an odd compound in Captain Doblin's blood and I was wondering if maybe he had some kind of medical issue that could explain it.<eos> No, the captain was in perfect physical health.<eos> Though, I-I read his file, and he could be suffering from one or more personality disorders.<eos> JIMMY:<eos> This is not an organic compound.<eos> It looks manufactured.
That kid is you.<eos> You've got your whole life to roll your eyes.<eos> Today isn't just about building a duck village.<eos> It's about building your smile.<eos> Don't fight it.<eos> There it is.<eos> As you can see, our little duck harbor has a working lighthouse.<eos> Wait a second -- what in the world did he just say?<eos> A working lighthouse?<eos> Yes, it is working.
- Are you sure? - Uh...<eos> What -- what do I do?<eos> Okay, uh, stay calm.<eos> I-I'll talk you through the labor.<eos> They're coming, Lily!<eos> Okay, Claire -- Tell me what you see!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> I think I see a beak.<eos> Well, the good news is we're not breach.<eos> It looks like it's struggling to break through.
He doesn't want to fight.<eos> What should we do about that, gentlemen?<eos> Don't make me do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The plane's not going to Halifax?<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But we're going to Halifax.<eos> NSA intel indicated that's where the plane was heading.<eos> Uh... it's not.<eos> It's landing near Pittsburgh.
I... I have the right to sell it.<eos> Yeah, but then we'd have to add felony, fraud and misrepresentation to your list of charges.<eos> Or you could face an early grave, depending on who the buyer is.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That's not the Bullitt Mustang.<eos> It's just a green '68.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you can check the VIN number.<eos> It's over there on the... passenger side dashboard.
Probably.<eos> I can't believe there's been a giant UFO under the town this whole time.<eos> I wish my mind could be where yours is right now, Dipper.<eos> When confirmation of extraterrestrials still had that punch.<eos> Now it's just sort of, meh.<eos> McGucket and I used to come down here all the time to raid their tech ad study their language.<eos> This is so cool!<eos> The substance we need so seal the rift is an alien adhesive, strong enough to keep the hull of a spacecraft together.<eos> Just one dollop of this adhesive should be enough to seal a crack in space-time.<eos> Also, if it touches you, it will seal up all the orifices in your face, so try so avoid that.
So when we found Keisha, you hadn't seen her for months, but Jeanette and Matt told you to report that you had.<eos> This is where I say that my client has information that could prove very helpful in bolstering your case.<eos> Depending on what we hear, we could downgrade from manslaughter to criminally negligent homicide.<eos> Which is still a felony.<eos> We'll stop here then.<eos> Not another word, Keith.<eos> No, look, wait.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I mean, they have to know.<eos> Jeanette... so she calls me that Saturday, and she orders me to come into the office, and it's closed, but...
We also found det chords and fuses.<eos> Directional explosives.<eos> A crew blasted into a stash house two years ago.<eos> They drilled in, mounted it, and then blasted clean through 16 inches of concrete.<eos> They're not blowing something up.<eos> They're blasting in.<eos> "Would any of these buildings be targets for C4 explosives?"<eos> These are all plain concrete foundations.<eos> No reinforcements.<eos> A blast wouldn't break into the building, it would bring it down.
He's coming!<eos> Go, go! Everyone in place!<eos> ♪ He's got the whole world in his hands ♪<eos> ♪ He's got the whole, wide world in his hands ♪<eos> ♪ He's got the whole world in his hands ♪<eos> ♪ He's got the whole world in his hands ♪<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> On behalf of everyone here in South Park, please let me say we are very excited to be in consideration...<eos> Everyone, please go about your business.<eos> I need to see this town in its normal goings-on to see if it is indeed a Whole Foods town.
But Dmitri's now been MIA for more than eight hours.<eos> It's possible there's an innocent explanation.<eos> Well, I admire your optimism, Professor.<eos> Look, Dmitri will lay low until he sees an opening.<eos> That's how he was trained.<eos> I'm sure he'll recover the phone soon.<eos> Problem is, he can't.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> - We had the phone removed.<eos> We couldn't risk it falling into the wrong hands.
I tried to keep you alive.<eos> Give me the pill. You speak English?<eos> Everyone speak some English.<eos> Give me the pill.<eos> I can't.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This pill, it gives you answers, da?<eos> Fix problems?<eos> Yeah, it can, but...<eos> This weight, all the time it is on me.
Our apologies, Your Honor.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> And this new chemical compound that my client created... it contains no illegal attributes?<eos> Tert-Butyl 4-hydroxybutanoate is electrically neutral, while GHB is an ionic compound.<eos> So, would that be like the difference between Coke and Pepsi?<eos> No, it's more like the difference between a butyrate-Co-A ligase and a glycine N-acyltransferase.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Dr. Marcotte, the Federal Analogue Act does not require that a drug be listed as a controlled substance for it to be illegal... is that correct?<eos> That's my understanding.<eos> If it is substantially similar to a controlled substance, it is treated as though it were - a controlled substance?
Separate trials, separate juries.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Great meeting.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Screw you.<eos> The state calls Scott Pierre-Paul.<eos> Mr. Pierre-Paul, do you have reason to believe Roland Hlavin knew he was making a designer drug?<eos> Yeah, he knew.<eos> He marketed it as an alternative to GHB.<eos> Said it was safer, no adverse side effects.
Hi!<eos> Okay, Tandy, we're gonna have to add<eos> "no talking-slash-total silence" to your punishment.<eos> I'm just trying to spread good cheer.<eos> You know, show everybody how much I care about them.<eos> I'm not bothering you guys, am I?<eos> It has come to my attention that there has been some unhappiness with the volume and frequency of my heartfelt compliments.<eos> Carol?<eos> I had Carol go out to the pet store and get this new collar for me.<eos> It is voice activated, so whenever I speak, a burst of citronella will be shot out into my face, thus assaulting my senses and delivering the silence you requested
That it was an accident.<eos> But I wasn't there, so I didn't know what to believe.<eos> And I wanted to go to the cops and explain what happened, but Stan said that we'd all go to jail.<eos> And I couldn't do that to Max.<eos> He already lost his father and his uncle.<eos> And he...<eos> He couldn't lose me, too.<eos> So I...didn't say anything.<eos> Fear cripples you.<eos> It makes you do nothing.
I mean, Lucifer would know how God ended the Darkness.<eos> He was there.<eos> So God assured you of this, did he?<eos> Let's say you're making this up.<eos> I mean, I never think of you as imaginative.<eos> We're not saying it's gonna happen.<eos> We just wanna know... Theoretically, ...if it's possible.<eos> The cage is a can of worms you do not want to open.<eos> I believe this conversation is over.<eos> Is it?
He holds on to girls until they're worn out, then trades them to networks across the country.<eos> Trevor says Ulrich is operating a brothel out of a club in Bridgeport.<eos> Hank.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I got a state's attorney downstairs who says he needs to talk to you right now.<eos> I got this.<eos> We'll gear up.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Sergeant, I know you've had a busy day.<eos> Well, it's not over.
Yeah, maybe a couple.<eos> You wanted to see me, sir?<eos> You did good in there today.<eos> He wasn't a killer, sir, just desperate.<eos> I stared down the barrel of that gun when he first took you hostage.<eos> Sir?<eos> Which is odd, because when you turned it in to evidence, it was unloaded, no bullets in the magazine, which reduces his charge to reckless endangerment.<eos> You never saw Frazier load or unload that weapon.<eos> No, Sergeant.<eos> It must have been empty the whole time.
- Yummy.<eos> - I'm just trying to...<eos> You coming over?<eos> Oh, the cat.<eos> - I'll call you.<eos> - The cat?<eos> Don't call.<eos> Just come over.<eos> Jay, yo, I got a ping on Ethan's phone.<eos> It was moving, but now it has stopped.
The body has approximately eleven organ systems all doing different things at the same time.<eos> In order to keep us functioning or, well, alive, they need one voice, a leader, a master, and, in our brains, that job belongs to the pituitary gland.<eos> It senses the body's needs before they even arise, working non-stop.
Jade.<eos> Jade, can you hear me?<eos> Now can I get out of here?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Oh, you will soon enough.<eos> Ah, yeah.<eos> Oh, Grey...<eos> just the person I needed to see.<eos> A hot appy came in tonight.<eos> Now, it hasn't ruptured, but you need to do...
[Scoffs] I certainly wouldn't voice them publicly.<eos> But if you did voice them publicly, that might slow things down, give us time to verify the Intel.<eos> You want me to put my foot in my mouth?<eos> Yes, Susan.<eos> Oh, why didn't you say so?<eos> [Crowd shouting] Eyes forward, ignore questions.<eos> - Straight to the building.<eos> - Uh-huh. Woman: Madam Vice President, are you pleased with the terms of the nuclear treaty?<eos> I've read it thoroughly.<eos> I think it's a good and fair treaty.
He knew who you were, Ms. Lambert.<eos> He chose you.<eos> Wait.<eos> So, is it...?<eos> Is it my fault that Don's dead?<eos> How's Vivian holding up?<eos> Since she blames herself for her husband's death?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Her phone get us anywhere? Ow!<eos> We're pinging the number that she was in contact with, hoping it will lead us to this... Frank.
A face on top of another face could easily mean he's undercover or he's two-faced.<eos> Which is bad news for the two missing agents.<eos> They were both undercover.<eos> Yeah, John Portman vanished a week ago.<eos> And then Sarah Miles disappeared yesterday.<eos> All of these agents were investigating the Libertad drug cartel.<eos> Well, if someone knew that they were undercover, then there has to be a mole on the inside.<eos> Well, we have to consider all possibilities.<eos> This cartel is in fact unique in a few ways.<eos> Yeah, it appeared on the Darknet after the Silk Road was shut down.
We've I.D.'d some of the lower level members, but who we really need to get to is Ben Franklin.<eos> This individual is the nexus between the ground operation and the Internet.<eos> We think Bowers made contact with that person, but he was killed before we could follow up.<eos> Have you checked in with their families?<eos> Any of them made contact?<eos> Funny you should ask.<eos> Sarah Miles' husband says there was a hang-up call from a number he didn't recognize 3 days ago.<eos> It was the anniversary of his and Sarah's first date.<eos> Did you trace the call?<eos> It came from a bar just outside of town.
Last bus of the day.<eos> Good place for a serial killer to pick up any stragglers.<eos> This must be a stop for migrant workers.<eos> Probably get dropped off here and then shuttled to farms throughout the valley.<eos> It's not harvest season right now.<eos> The store's closed.<eos> Hey, mama, listen, I need you to find the owner of the Diablo General Store in Esperanza Valley.<eos> Okey dokey.<eos> Uh, looks like that store has been owned by the Dufour family for 60 years, currently managed by Jacob Dufour.<eos> It's closed in the winter months.
I have diplomatic immunity.<eos> You may expel me or let me go, but you may not under any circumstance bore me.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's private security.<eos> So why were you on Crandall's jet?<eos> He abducted a German biophysicist. I was tasked with finding him.<eos> You were on that jet to find Elizabeth Keen, just like you were at Wing Yee this morning.<eos> Oh, no. I was at Wing Yee for their wonton soup.<eos> It is fantastic.
They're calling him Hasaan.<eos> I'm sorry, Samar.<eos> I'm getting to the truth a little too late.<eos> The Lazarum hostages have all been executed.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> If my brother is Hasaan, why would he risk an attack like this?<eos> For the list...<eos> The list of Mossad agents and their informants working around the world to find and execute Hasaan.<eos> That list is I.S.O.O. secure.<eos> It's not available electronically.
It's just...<eos> that's the least scary pasta.<eos> It's in the name.<eos> And now, while I stitch Lady Bobbenstein back up, get ready for the next part of our haunted tour.<eos> I smell a costume change!<eos> You guys, I think I know what this haunted house needs.<eos> Grapes?<eos> Should I call my guy?<eos> No, Gene.<eos> It needs scares.
Good idea.<eos> (dial tone hums) Oh, thank God.<eos> It works.<eos> Wow, this phonebook is, like, from the '90s.<eos> Let's see if Tony Toni Tow-me is still in business.<eos> Hey, Mom, question, why does this house have mothball smell?<eos> Follow-up question, whose house is this?<eos> David Lee Mothball? Maybe the owner of a mothball team?<eos> It's an empty house that Mort said we could use.<eos> It belonged to one of his clients.
I've just seen Angela walking into the cathedral with Rowenna and Jane."<eos> I don't know what they - "Jane!"<eos> "Hello?"<eos> They've taken...<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What is it?<eos> James, her boyfriend, is Boy Bishop.<eos> On St Nicholas Day, the Bishop of Hereford hands over power to the Boy Bishop enthroned in his place.<eos> So technically, on this day every year, the cathedral is without its spiritual head.<eos> Today it will be more vulnerable than ever.
- Yes, but...<eos> - Will you teach me how to do it later?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When you're a player...<eos> - What?<eos> - You'll see when we play football.<eos> - Are you going to teach me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Football has always been my passion.<eos> It was always what I enjoyed doing the most.
Apparently, some of their seed blew onto his farm.<eos> They claimed he illegally infringed on their patent and they sued him.<eos> The defense cost matchett a fortune.<eos> He must have lost everything.<eos> Aram, did you get those files? You've stumbled on a state-of-the-art virology shop.<eos> Matchett didn't steal verdiant's genome blueprint so he could release it publicly.<eos> He needed it to identify its weaknesses and design a virus tailor-made to destroy it.<eos> He wants to sabotage their gmo crop? 90% of all corn grown in America is genetically modified. Verdiant is the largest producer of it.<eos> In fact, this one strain is planted all over the world.<eos> If this virus gets out, it will spread fast.
Did you sleep at all?<eos> Don't sleep.<eos> Since when?<eos> Since my sister died.<eos> These photos are bringing everything back up.<eos> I keep thinking of the call I got from my mother, telling me that Emily had been killed.<eos> Before the call, I was this-this Agent Afloat, starting this new career.<eos> Life couldn't have been better.<eos> After the call, I live in this world where... I'll never see my sister again.<eos> If that call had to come, if it could have come a minute later, five minutes later even...
Yeah, let's go!<eos> All right, follow me!<eos> This way, everyone!<eos> Another local business is closing its doors tonight after being taken down by Yelp reviewers.<eos> Whistlin' Willy's, a child favorite in town, was destroyed and its owner stripped and beheaded.<eos> The following video is graphic.<eos> No, please! No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Aww!<eos> We all loved Whistlin' Willy's.<eos> It didn't do well with Yelpers.
She's gonna be upset, ashamed.<eos> Now, I'll do my best to protect her.<eos> I give you my word.<eos> I can't go.<eos> - You heard Annalise.<eos> - I can't sell out my sister without at least giving her a chance to explain.<eos> Catherine sold you out the minute she didn't tell you she knew Philip.<eos> - Maybe she doesn't know him.<eos> - What about the gun?<eos> She probably didn't know it was there.
I said you could do it, and you did it.<eos> I'm free!<eos> And I have another chance with Sharon.<eos> No way their relationship survives this.<eos> Sharon hates you, Dale.<eos> You're a stalker, you're pathetic, and you're fired.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> For helping you win the case.<eos> You want the trophy, it's in a box in the basement.
We use it.<eos> I'm advising Caleb to take the plea deal.<eos> But why?<eos> Because he confessed to me at the house.<eos> So?<eos> Sinclair's got no case.<eos> Plus, we've been handing her her ass this whole time.<eos> That's not true anymore.<eos> Caleb showed me where he was hiding the gun.<eos> It's in a toolbox in the basement.
Soon as your alibi checks out, yeah.<eos> Of course, that could take a while.<eos> I were you, I'd get cozy.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, you can't keep me in here.<eos> That's illegal.<eos> Come on, Frankie.<eos> You never let the law get in your way.<eos> Why start now?<eos> Hey.<eos> I've reassembled the skull, and it is ready for its close-up.
I don't see it.<eos> Each of these shapes is completely distinct.<eos> Angela, position the rocky surface on top, rotating it 180 degrees.<eos> Now position the flat edge several inches below that, horizontally, with the sharp force trauma outline to the left of that.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Why does that look familiar?<eos> Because you live in it.<eos> That is the great Commonwealth of Virginia.<eos> Oh. Well, how can a state be a murder weapon?<eos> Well, unless the state of Virginia is composed of coal, it's not.

Well, how can a state be a murder weapon?<eos> Well, unless the state of Virginia is composed of coal, it's not.<eos> The blue you saw in the stab wound is the result of petrified coal.<eos> It can turn organic tissue blue.
You were just a child.<eos> You didn't know any better.<eos> But the old man was right.<eos> I knew unless I did something, I'd end up like that.<eos> Everybody would.<eos> People get old.<eos> It's natural.<eos> No.<eos> The answer is right here, practically under our feet.<eos> It has been for centuries.
But... you really are just a politician now, huh?<eos> Go.<eos> (elevator bell dings)<eos> How is this possible?<eos> These are the preliminary results from the blood and tissue samples found underneath our victim's fingernails.<eos> Yeah, he fought back.<eos> He was getting his eyes clawed out.<eos> Yeah, that's the problem.<eos> There's only a single source of DNA.<eos> And it belongs to our victim.
the unfortunate deceased Byron Sutton, Mr. Gregory Cummings,<eos> Susan Trent and this is her brother, Matthew Trent.<eos> May we leave, please?<eos> My sister is unwell.<eos> Mr. Trent, what can you tell me about this evening's events?<eos> Nothing, really.<eos> Nothing of importance.<eos> Everyone smoked opium, Byron thought it was just marvelous.<eos> Did he say anything?<eos> He mentioned something about it being strong, that he could feel it all over his body or some such nonsense.
Well, I may not know all the English names correct, but it includes ma huang; you call it sea grape, aconite, peppermint and ginseng.<eos> Aconite.<eos> As in, wolfsbane?<eos> That's a very dangerous and very toxic plant.<eos> Yes!<eos> The plant, yes, very dangerous.<eos> Not my preparation of it.<eos> I am trained.<eos> I make the powder myself with great care.<eos> It is safe in small quantities.
I feel the most delicious tingling in my body, like all of my senses are on fire.<eos> I understand now how opium awakens an appetite...<eos> I'm not hungry in the slightest.<eos> ... of a more carnal nature...<eos> Julia.<eos> We are not alone.<eos> I see no one.<eos> No one but you.<eos> William... look at this dragon.<eos> It's as though it could breathe fire at any moment.
You're seeing the red of the dragon's mouth and interpreting it as fire.<eos> William,<eos> I'm aware that I am looking at a tapestry and not an actual dragon.<eos> You might find this experience more beneficial if you ceased to analyze it and just embrace it.<eos> Did you know, Julia, that in Ancient China, only Emperors were allowed to depict five clawed dragons?<eos> Anyone found in possession of such things was put to death.<eos> Then I suppose Byron Sutton was willing to invoke the wrath of the ancients.<eos> - How so?<eos> - His pipe has an engraving of a dragon with five claws on it.<eos> Remarkably, it's just like this one.
It was Lawrence.<eos> He was supposed to smoke that damn pipe.<eos> Dr. Sutton, you are under arrest for the murder of Byron Sutton.<eos> It was Lawrence!<eos> It was his fault, it's not mine.<eos> Not mine.<eos> Despite the darker side of opium, I enjoyed our little experiment. Yes.<eos> Not one that I would care to repeat.<eos> No?<eos> Not even the sensation it invoked?
I've never been in a fight.<eos> I have.<eos> Yes, it was a dance fight.<eos> I won.<eos> No one wins in a dance fight.<eos> Well, if we're going out there, I got a little something in my medical kit that'll stack the odds in our favor.<eos> Heroin?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> No, it's vitamin B12 shots.<eos> It'll give us a nice natural boost, like sending back a sandwich or sleeping without pants on.
Oh, we will. If there's anything left of him.<eos> Sir, rebel reinforcements have arrived.<eos> One shuttle and one ship of unknown design.<eos> I would hardly call that reinforcements.<eos> You boys better give me some room.<eos> You heard the captain.<eos> Sabine, we'll get one shot at this.<eos> Then it's a good thing you trust me.<eos> Sir, the unidentified ship is taking the lead.<eos> It's moving into attack position off our starboard side.
The only way for them to stay... is to trade places with living souls.<eos> Meaning us?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And when the moon reaches its peak, the ferry from the underworld will arrive... and drag us down there.<eos> That doesn't sound good.<eos> Speaking as one who's died and been there, it's not.<eos> So, how do we stop it?<eos> We can't.<eos> The underworld is worse than you can possibly imagine.<eos> It's gonna make you wish the old stories of fire and brimstone were true.

Excalibur would be of any use would be if... if Emma takes all the darkness into herself... and uses the sword to destroy it. And herself.<eos> Excalibur was always destined... for the hands of a true hero.<eos> That's it?<eos> You don't want to make a deal or something?<eos> No.<eos> You're a brave woman, Emma Swan... but it might not work.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, that blade... it chooses who it finds worthy.<eos> And it chooses its miracles.
For the first time, you were truly selfless.<eos> You know, I don't need to see the world to know what I want anymore.<eos> What I want is to be with you.<eos> Now, you see. This isn't the library or Granny's or some bus station, Miss Swan.<eos> This is my shop.<eos> Unless the sign says "open"... you're not invited.<eos> I think I was invited.<eos> I hear whispering.<eos> It's the dagger.<eos> It's calling to me.
Couples put up locks. As a symbol of their everlasting love.<eos> We should go find that scrapbook.<eos> Can I have my hand back now?<eos> Die with the con, liv.<eos> No, it's voss.<eos> V-o-s-s.<eos> He's a beat cop at the 12th.<eos> All morning?<eos> You're sure?<eos> - It was down there!
Chief walt price speaking.<eos> It's detective cavanaugh here.<eos> I'm afraid I've got some bad news.<eos> That evidence I told you about?<eos> The scrapbook?<eos> It's gone missing.<eos> Babineaux must've gotten to it.<eos> Damn it, cavanaugh!<eos> How the hell did you let that happen?<eos> It was in my desk, someone could've...
Thank you.<eos> Cheers.<eos> But fire is wildly difficult to contain.<eos> And just when you think you've extinguished the blaze...<eos> - Bailey's looking for you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You have to pull it together.<eos> - You're getting yourself in trouble.<eos> - I know.<eos> ...it reignites.
It's a stupid conversation in the first place.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Boxing is better than MMA in all ways.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Let me explain something to you, okay?<eos> Boxing is civilized.<eos> Which is probably why you don't like it that much, okay?<eos> It's a technical sport.<eos> It requires something that you do not have.
We don't know what they're bringing in.<eos> It could be guns, it could be explosives.<eos> Well, whatever he's got planned, it's gonna be big.<eos> This event is attracting major attention from all over the world. Yeah.<eos> Speaking of which, fight's about to start.<eos> Yeah, which means Gabriel's probably already inside.<eos> The first round of this scheduled 12-round championship fight has clearly gone to Haynes.<eos> And if Luke Nakano doesn't find a way to solve the left jab of Devon Haynes, it's gonna be a quick and painful night for the hometown hero.<eos> He's looked completely overmatched since the opening bell.<eos> Haynes backs Nakano up. Haynes with a devastating right, and it looks like it may have hurt Nakano.

How can I help?<eos> Well, we need eyes on the ground.<eos> Do-do you still have contacts from when you worked in Dubai?<eos> A few, yeah.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> Wait, Delilah...<eos> Um...<eos> I think you were right.<eos> About the couch.<eos> It doesn't fit the space.
Check out the moves on this baby!<eos> This brute force bot is grinding through 72 potential passcodes per minute, trying to crack into Quinn's hidden partition.<eos> Hey, don't touch it.<eos> I don't want to have to start over.<eos> We're lucky that this calculator app only accepts numbers.<eos> No letters or symbols means there's only about 10 billion possible combinations.<eos> Yeah, but Quinn programmed the calculator to overwrite the hidden partition if it senses a forensic tool.<eos> Now, are you sure we're not gonna lose everything.<eos> No, the bot replicates the action of entering a code.<eos> It stopped.
Where are you from originally?<eos> Maryland.<eos> Oh, Maryland.<eos> - Baltimore?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Tough neighborhood.<eos> No.<eos> Loyola.<eos> We don't see many applicants from that law school.<eos> I think it's underrated, actually.
I think I left my emergency packet back at my place.<eos> Brian, if someone gives you an emergency packet, because your place has been compromised, you...<eos> Don't leave it in the place that's been compromised.<eos> Jinx.<eos> The FBI can ping that phone's location, Brian.<eos> Yeah, just to the nearest tower, though.<eos> It doesn't prove anything.<eos> And besides, that DIC is way too egotistical to have somebody ping his cell phone.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's not DIC.

There's no way that's true.<eos> She does keep a lot of secrets.<eos> She just went down to D.C. to save your ass.<eos> She got thrown into a hole for it.<eos> She is being framed.<eos> And we are gonna help her.<eos> Hey, all right.<eos> Oh, uh, will you do me a favor?<eos> Can you water my bonsai plant?<eos> It's on the table.

Jackson's had one, but now he's throwing it away.<eos> Will you please stop?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> This party sucks.<eos> Say "cheese"!<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> Y-you asked for Manchego cheese.<eos> You didn't say how much you needed, so I just got a bunch.<eos> It's pretty pricy, but I...

You'll be able to go up and see him in recovery soon enough.<eos> Do all your patients say things they don't mean because of the pain?<eos> I find that pain is usually the precipice for the truth, yeah.<eos> He's totally right.<eos> I kept hinting about his weight.<eos> What an awful thing to do to a person you love.<eos> His weight bothered you?<eos> No.<eos> That's what's so stupid.<eos> I thought it bothered him.
It also makes sense that you, or one of your scumbags, caught up to DJ, tossed her out of the van and left her for dead.<eos> She stole one of the stones.<eos> And she was my responsibility. I'm going to have to cover that loss.<eos> I looked everywhere.<eos> I couldn't find her.<eos> I swear on my mother's life.<eos> Not knowing your mother, we're going to need something a little bit more tangible.<eos> The women arrived with luggage posing as tourist.<eos> There's no way that DJ's suitcase fit through that window.<eos> Where is it?
One of us chooses three aquatic creatures, and the other one must decide which he would eat, befriend, or battle.<eos> So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.<eos> Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.<eos> Let's just play.<eos> I'll start you off easy.<eos> Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.<eos> Hmm. Well,<eos> I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.
Sheldon Cooper's descent into madness... day two.<eos> It's 2:25 a.m., and I feel the urge to urinate.<eos> My normal urination time is 7:10 a.m., but here I am, in the middle of the night, struggling to keep my mind sharp and my pajamas dry.<eos> It's only a matter of time before my tenuous grasp on reality fades.<eos> I suppose I should pee while I still know what a toilet is.<eos> Since when do you hum songs?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You were just humming.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Sometimes when my brain really gets moving, it makes noise.
Who cares?<eos> What are you doing in my room?<eos> I...<eos> Stop it!<eos> That's mine!<eos> Why are you so strong? !<eos> Problem solved.<eos> Oh, yeah, he got a tuba.<eos> Dear Crazy Future Sheldon... this is a thermostat.<eos> It controls the temperature of the apartment.
Live long and suck it!<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Birthday girl.<eos> Come in!<eos> Oh!<eos> Hi, Sheldon.<eos> Hello.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> I also got you a balloon, but it floated away, and I chased it for a while.
Really coat your tongue.<eos> Now swallow.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Much better.<eos> Okay, Jay, what you're gonna want to do is hold the sauce in your mouth, sw--<eos> I know how eating works.<eos> - Not too shabby.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You know who else makes a mean sauce is Gloria's dead aunt.<eos> - Oh. - Oh, there it is right there.
Cilantro!<eos> What?<eos> That car backfiring, it sounded like gunshots.<eos> I remember when I was a little girl in my aunt's kitchen, and she started chopping the cilantro really loud so that we couldn't hear the noise.<eos> Yes, okay.<eos> Well, what else do you remember?<eos> Well, nothing, Cam.<eos> It was 30 years ago.<eos> No, the recipe is inside you!<eos> It just needs to come out!
I'm making pasghetti!<eos> You are adorable.<eos> I remember when I had everyone in the palm of my hand with a two-foot putt like "pasghetti."<eos> We both know you know how to say it.<eos> Hey, guys, thanks again for helping me to get that listing.<eos> Cyril's house.<eos> - Pretty sexy, huh?<eos> - Ridonk.<eos> This place makes the Playboy mansion look like an old folks' home.<eos> Which I guess it kind of is now.

Go ahead and take that, please.<eos> The dispensary that was raided belongs to a private pharmaceutical lab that manufactures and securely stores our NZT supply.<eos> Well, not that securely.<eos> I mean, that guy knew about it.<eos> There were three of them, actually.<eos> And no, I don't think they did know.<eos> The shooter's cohorts cleared out of there before he discovered the NZT locker.<eos> Seems they were targeting oxycodone.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> It's the highest street value.
By being more aggressive, by being more human, - which resulted in this accident. - No.<eos> This accident was caused by humans.<eos> Then why did you erase the car's hard drive?<eos> I did not erase the hard drive.<eos> - Then how did it get erased?<eos> - Why don't we take a break?<eos> No, I'd like to answer that.<eos> The hard drive was damaged by the force of the accident.<eos> We're not talking about an airplane's black box here.<eos> It is vulnerable to impact.
- And what is that, Gloria?<eos> - I just got off the phone with the esteemed donor who so graciously lent us your apartment. - Uh-huh. - And whose daughter,<eos> Sarabelle, you just fired. He's threatening to evict you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - No, no, no, no.<eos> You--Gloria, I was told to make myself at home.<eos> - I have seen thee and her, and I do adore thee.<eos> - You're on very thin ice.<eos> And I suggest you get off of it before it breaks and we both fall through.
This ice feels very good to me.<eos> And now I cannot hear you.<eos> Because I'm listening to<eos> Igor Fyodorovich Stravinsky.<eos> Which, by the way, I'm sure he used to love ice skating.<eos> Russians, you know?<eos> Pavel!<eos> - Ms. Windsor?<eos> Is there a problem with the floor?<eos> - Oh, no, no. It's absolutely perfect, Pavel.
She called and she said reddington was missing,<eos> And she asked me to trace his burner number.<eos> She made me promise not to tell ressler.<eos> You know where they are, and you're not gonna tell him.<eos> I only know the truth about my brother Because of reddington.<eos> I owe him for that this once.<eos> Why use agent ressler's laptop?<eos> When liz called, i wasn't thinking.<eos> His laptop -- he must have left it at my work station. I don't know.<eos> It was just there.
We worked Tuesdays together.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just... I can't believe someone would want to do that to her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you know anybody who'd want to hurt her?<eos> Which one of those is Victoria's?<eos> Oh, okay, thanks.<eos> That's club property.<eos> You got a warrant?<eos> Well... it kind of looks open to me.
The red dots indicate the location of the gunshots heard three nights ago.<eos> Well, the victim was last seen leaving Morty's bar at 1:30, so we can lose all the gunfire prior to that.<eos> As well as where the arrests were made.<eos> That leaves us with two.<eos> Hopefully not after I run the gunshots through the sound-forging software.<eos> Now we just plot the decibels as a function of frequency.<eos> And what exactly are we watching for?<eos> The frequencies at which the two gunshots came in.<eos> Small-caliber firearms tend to have higher decibels, but not so much in the lower frequencies.<eos> So the fact that the first shot had a higher decibel in the lower frequency means it came from a large-caliber weapon?
What if Sally, Doreen, Fern, and Elsie made a pact to kill Dray?<eos> They agreed to stick to the same story if they were questioned.<eos> Then under pressure three of them crumbled and the blame went to Sally.<eos> Someone is exacting revenge on those who got away - with Mr. Dray's murder.<eos> - Julia, there are five killers.<eos> Counting Sally Brown, four of them are dead.<eos> That means one of them is still out there.<eos> If we are right, there is still one more statue the killer must cast.<eos> Sir, we've ascertained the motive for the electroplates murders.<eos> It dates back to the Albert Dray murder.
Well, sir, I wasn't...<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Quite swift.<eos> Quite swift, sir.<eos> All this local option business is ridiculous, if you ask me.<eos> Sir, if it's what the people of the Junction want, I see no reason to prevent it.<eos> Liquor is a good thing for a good man.<eos> A few drunks having too much is hardly cause to get rid of it.<eos> I've never understood the appeal of alcohol, sir.<eos> It impedes the brain's ability to function, making it impossible to think clearly.
Get out!<eos> I can walk out myself, sir.<eos> Despite the worrying circumstances, it's a pleasure to see you both again.<eos> Indeed, Jacques.<eos> How long have you been living up here?<eos> I bought this lodge 10 years ago.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm just here for the fishing.<eos> It really is a striking property.<eos> Strangely enough, it used to belong to Mr. Singer.
- I'm doing a trust fall!<eos> - Oh, I've got to videotape this!<eos> Listen, listen, I want you to 100% know that<eos> I'm definitely not going to catch you. Okay?<eos> I don't hear negativity.<eos> All I hear is friendship.<eos> Okay, you're definitely gonna fall, so...<eos> My heart says I'm not.<eos> Ok, well this is gonna hurt much more than when your Netflix special comes out and nobody watches it.<eos> I won't lie to you. That will hurt when it comes out on December 1.
- You don't own the thing, but you want me to let you root around inside.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - $3?<eos> - Hey, pal, we're the firefighters who put out that fire.<eos> We have some property that belongs to the driver, and we just want to give it back to him.<eos> - I think I can help you out.<eos> Guy left his wallet in the console.<eos> - Who abandons a camper in such a hurry that they leave behind a wallet?<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Thanks. I supposed it was empty when you found it.
I fought under that flag.<eos> Just like Dad, just like Grandpa.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, you want to burn it, you don't love this country, get the hell out.<eos> It's not that simple, Danny.<eos> Oh, now we got to hear from the golden boy who never even wore a uniform?<eos> I wear one now, and no one respects what the flag stands for more than I do.<eos> You know what, then I'll tell you what.<eos> Hop on an airplane, go to some godforsaken hellhole, and watch all your buddies get blown away, then talk to us - about what the flag stands for. - Hey.<eos> Let's keep it civilized, okay?<eos> Look, everyone at this table respects your service, but when you defend the flag, you defend all the rights it stands for.
They're leaving.<eos> This is a First Amendment case.<eos> I know that, and you know that, but they don't know that.<eos> Then have them talk to me.<eos> They don't want to be argued out of their position.<eos> There isn't much neutral ground on abortion.<eos> On free speech.<eos> Your Honor, we will stipulate that the non-disclosure agreement applied on the premises, but the conversation did not take place there.<eos> They met at the conference and were on - an officially scheduled break. - Off-premises.<eos> You're saying the conversation wasn't covered by the non-disclosure agreement because it happened somewhere else?
I tackled him, the gun went off.<eos> Okay, take it easy.<eos> I think you just saved our lives, Hank.<eos> I guess you guys are rubbing off on me, huh?<eos> Kaelani's gun was a .22.<eos> Same as the other shooters.<eos> You all right?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> It took a lot of courage to do what you did, Hank.<eos> I mean, if this guy had got a shot off, it would have been one of us they'd be taking pictures of right now.
Cause if you step to him, you'd best be ready to step to me!<eos> You wanna dance, ese? !<eos> Easy, babe, easy.<eos> Breathe, breathe...<eos> Look, alright? Do I do things for Jackie?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Look at it from my perspective.<eos> Look at all the things I get.<eos> She's amazing at sex.<eos> When my penis gets inducted into the penis hall of fame, it's going to give an amazing acceptance speech.
So I checked Matt's alibi, but he was with HIS girlfriend.<eos> The thing is... ..it's Beth.<eos> How was the library?<eos> Quiet.<eos> Lots of books.<eos> Come and sit down.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, our chat yesterday...<eos> Yeah?<eos> It meant a lot.
I never really looked at the guy.<eos> You saying that was him?<eos> Well, that's what I'm trying to find out, yeah.<eos> How tall was he? My height?<eos> Mick's height?<eos> Average, I think.<eos> And he had a hat - a baseball cap.<eos> Maybe.<eos> I never really looked at him, I was too busy looking at his shoe.<eos> It was black.
'It's him!<eos> The Captain.'<eos> 'Leave me alone! '<eos> GUNSHOT What did I tell you?<eos> Long Ben!<eos> You think Errol was murdered by a pirate ghost?<eos> Why not?<eos> I saw a ghost once.<eos> Seriously, it properly freaked me out.<eos> It came into my hotel room, groaned and then wandered off again.
It had real trouble with light and shadow.<eos> It got a lot of other stuff wrong, too.<eos> Just nothing else that looked so...<eos> - Racist?<eos> - Right.<eos> It's gotten better.<eos> Google had this problem, too.<eos> Did the algorithm ever mistake a white person for an animal?<eos> Why would it do that?<eos> Because it mistakes white people for polar bears or white seals.
You're Rebecca's neighbor, right?<eos> - I met you at her party. - Oh.<eos> You got really drunk, and then you slow-danced with that giant fish.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> No, it did...<eos> I have pictures.<eos> I saw you ask it to go home with you.<eos> Does this present say, "our mom sucks, but I'm gonna try very hard not to hold it against you"?<eos> No.<eos> It says you're old and still think kids play outside.
It's a cultural wasteland.<eos> I mean, it's completely arse about face. And it is tough to drink hot toddies when you're shvitzing.<eos> Oh, I'm Jewish, by the way.<eos> - You're Jewish? - Yes.<eos> - A British Jew?<eos> - Yes!<eos> That is fabulous.<eos> British Jew. Tea and matzo, anyone?<eos> You're funny.<eos> Well, since you're British, we must do tea, even if it's iced.

But at least I thought I had you.<eos> Cheer up, Jada.<eos> You're not gonna get traffic like this in Wisconsin.<eos> What is it I will get?<eos> Hmm, thousand types of cheese, great skiing, and no one trying to murder you.<eos> I will never again see my family or my homeland.<eos> This does not sound like much of a reward to me.<eos> The reward is life on your terms not your family.<eos> New name, new identity.<eos> This horror story, it's over.
Victim's name was Eddie Ross.<eos> We had to I.D. him with dental records.<eos> Stabbed in the chest and incinerated.<eos> Did the killer also throw him off a roof?<eos> He was dead before the fire started.<eos> Figure there was a struggle, the perp torched the place to cover up any evidence he left behind.<eos> The neighbor-- you said you interviewed her yourself.<eos> Yeah. And she smelled a gas leak, as in natural gas?<eos> Well, her unit and Ross's both have gas stoves.<eos> She thought maybe the pilot went out, only it didn't.
Should answer all your questions.<eos> Just like he wrote in his statement.<eos> He hired those workers to move the drums, and he let them use his company's truck to do it.<eos> And he did it at the same time the fire broke out at Eddie Ross's place.<eos> A despicable alibi, but an alibi nonetheless.<eos> Duncan Brice is not our killer.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm punishing my brain.<eos> And what did your brain do to deserve punishment?<eos> It's what it didn't do.
I'm punishing my brain.<eos> And what did your brain do to deserve punishment?<eos> It's what it didn't do.<eos> We know that Duncan Brice is an abhorrent human being who'd rather hide evidence of toxic waste than protect his tenants.<eos> And he's almost certainly behind the death of Eddie Ross.<eos> He had an accomplice-- someone who went to kill Eddie while Duncan dealt with the drums.<eos> That's why we went to separate quarters-- to try and figure out who it was, right?<eos> I've been pouring through the man's life for hours now, trying to find someone he would plausibly approach for such a task, and I have nothing to show for it.<eos> How fares your brain?<eos> Actually, it thinks it found something.
We agreed.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Even if it's something small, if you two wake up together on Christmas morning, I guarantee you she'll have bought you something.<eos> Why?<eos> Women are more thoughtful than men.<eos> It's Christmas, she cares about you.<eos> At the very least, you should have backup plan.<eos> Like what?<eos> The emergency gift.<eos> You don't need it, you don't use it, but it's there if you do.

"Early diagnosis, anterograde amnesia".<eos> Yeah, or in layman's terms, chronic short-term memory loss.<eos> It's like she remembers everything up until the point of being hit on her head, but nothing since.<eos> Her memory keeps resetting.<eos> Like Dory in Finding Nemo?<eos> Yeah - or me, after three pints of Mick's scrumpy.<eos> It's a bit...convenient, isn't it?<eos> I thought that. Then I looked at the results.<eos> Fractured skull.<eos> Now, it has healed over, but it wasn't there before she went off the boat.
Robert didn't believe her.<eos> Did you?<eos> Rose?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Know what this is?<eos> Bindweed.<eos> A bloody nightmare.<eos> Calystegia sepium.<eos> When it flowers, it looks pretty enough but... it'll choke everything else to death.
Look, everyone's already taken off but I've got a couple of hours to kill so can I at least buy you a beer?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Merry Christmas!<eos> - You all came!<eos> I don't have to damn you all to hell anymore.<eos> We all changed our plans.<eos> My Christmas wish came true.<eos> I just want everyone to be happy.<eos> That reminds me though, I want to hear everyone's Christmas wish.<eos> My wish is that someone would stop pretending like that kiss didn't mean something when it so clearly did mean something.
Allright,allright,lots tocatch upon.<eos> Jane was trying to balance motherhood with grad school.<eos> Making things harder: the evil classmate who wrote an exposé about Rafael's family.<eos> Oh, and speaking of family drama, Jane's father, Rogelio, invested all his money into his passion project.<eos> - Unfortunately, it decked...
I think at this point we can share with the secretary that this asset is being handled by her husband.<eos> Never a dull moment.<eos> How confident are Dr. McCord and DIA in this asset?<eos> - Highly, sir.<eos> - Good.<eos> Recommend moving all nonessential resources from Kharkiv and Luhansk to Mariupol as quickly as possible.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Ephraim, could you wait a minute?<eos> Of course.<eos> As you'd expect, our NATO allies are eager for us to end this conflict before it expands.
Well, it would be very nice to get this... Maklovsky in a room, huh?<eos> - That's gonna be hard.<eos> - He's dead.<eos> Killed in a violent mugging in Moscow one week after Pavel Ostrov died.<eos> Okay, but wait a second.<eos> We still don't have anything that directly connects Maria - or Maklovsky...<eos> - Except this.<eos> DIA's source in the hospital was able to get us a list of every prescription that Maklovsky wrote during that two-week period, including one for Progestafil.<eos> A rarely used, injectable, blood coagulant.<eos> NIH said that in extreme doses, it could cause an embolism in someone who recently had surgery.
We've been losing sleep over this case for 15 years."<eos> We knew the technology had advanced, so we asked for the testing again.<eos> The material was sent down to the crime laboratory again, and what they found was that there were 13 pubic hairs that had been collected during the pubic hair combings of the victim.<eos> Eleven of those hairs had no root.<eos> So they were down to two pubic hairs.<eos> One of those hairs was from a female, probably Penny Beerntsen's own hair.<eos> The truth in this matter came down to that one remaining pubic hair.<eos> They got a full profile.<eos> That profile conclusively excluded Steven Avery.<eos> It could not have come from him.
Until Shelly was...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You need to tell me everything.<eos> About what happened at your house that night.<eos> Um... it was Zo's idea.<eos> I didn't want to do it, but I was scared to say no.<eos> And he had this power over us.<eos> Whatever Zo said, we did.<eos> We got there around 9:00.<eos> Sofia didn't want to use her key, because she was afraid it could lead back to her.
And Lieutenant Lenk and Sergeant Colborn are officers of Calumet County?<eos> - Uh, no, Manitowoc County.<eos> - Manitowoc County.<eos> And as far as you know, no one saw this key until November 8th, is that right?<eos> Correct.<eos> And those slippers were moved before the key was seen?<eos> Yes.<eos> And the first time they were moved, nobody saw the key?<eos> The key wasn't there the first time they were moved.<eos> And when you saw it there, it was sitting out there in plain view right on the floor, is that right?
No, sir, I did not.<eos> [Buting] It's not enough to just get the key.<eos> He wants Avery's DNA on that.<eos> And so he is gonna wait until it is the right time.<eos> And there is a Calumet deputy with him on all of these searches.<eos> Yep, there is, somewhere near.<eos> Somewhere nearby, and he was just waiting for the right time... when he could do it.<eos> That key does not fall from... you know, in between the backboard and the frame of that little bookcase.<eos> And find its way underneath a pair of slippers.<eos> Yeah, it just does...
Did you ever write a report about that?<eos> No, I did not, sir.<eos> Well, actually you did, didn't you?<eos> It was about eight years later, wasn't it?<eos> I wrote a statement on it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You wrote that statement in 2003, the day after Steven Avery finally walked out of prison, didn't you?<eos> I don't know what day Steve was released from prison, but I wrote the statement in 2003.<eos> That's all I have.<eos> Sergeant Colborn, back in 1994 or '95, if you would've written a report... what would it have been about?
No, I did not, sir.<eos> Well, actually you did, didn't you?<eos> It was about eight years later, wasn't it?<eos> I wrote a statement on it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You wrote that statement in 2003, the day after Steven Avery finally walked out of prison, didn't you?<eos> I don't know what day Steve was released from prison, but I wrote the statement in 2003.<eos> That's all I have.<eos> Sergeant Colborn, back in 1994 or '95, if you would've written a report... what would it have been about?<eos> [Colborn] I don't know what it would've been about.
- Yes, just once!<eos> - Don't call me "honey-poo."<eos> - I'll call you honey-poo if I want.<eos> Now that takes the cake!<eos> I have to be the concierge here too!<eos> - Oh!<eos> - My darling Marcelle!<eos> Oh! The chair from number 10.<eos> Who put it here?<eos> What's it doing here?
That was me.<eos> He did write a court story.<eos> I re-wrote it.<eos> What?<eos> Girls do not do re-writes.<eos> Why not?<eos> That's simply how we do things here.<eos> We have rules, protocol.<eos> Those rules are dumb.<eos> If copy's good, it's good.
- All right, so can we go then?<eos> This does remind me of a time...<eos> Johann, if you tell me one of your stories, I swear I will turn your insides into your outsides.<eos> For another day, then.<eos> Off we go.<eos> Okay, bud.<eos> Let's see how long we can keep these guys busy.<eos> We're not here to fight, bud.<eos> Toothless, sky!<eos> Let's just hurry up with this ridiculous plan before it falls apart, which it will.
- [Ruffnut] Jerk!<eos> - I think she saw it.<eos> How lucky are we? [chuckles]<eos> To be able to study a Seashocker this closely?<eos> Okay, but we have to be careful.<eos> We don't want to hurt the dragon.<eos> Oh, Hiccup, when would I ever hurt a dragon?<eos> [dragon screeching] [sighs] Look at how fluidly it moves through the water.<eos> - Truly masterful.<eos> - What's it even doing here?

But, if I was to publish them in their present state, I'd be sent to the lunatic asylum.<eos> You don't understand. These...<eos> I don't think about this the same way you do.<eos> These steps you want, what you want,<eos> I do not know how to do.<eos> Well, you can just begin by trying your best and see if you don't surprise yourself.<eos> - Sir, do you know something I don't?<eos> - Apparently not.<eos> No, God and I don't see exactly eye to eye.<eos> So if I prepare for rain, then it won't.
Mom, it's for Lauren.<eos> Burke, give her the line!<eos> The house is clean.<eos> Better.<eos> Come on.<eos> The house is clean.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> She's gonna freak.<eos> "This house is clean."<eos> It isn't though.
All right love.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Have you looked at the refrigerator yet?<eos> Huh?<eos> The refrigerator?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The box in our kitchen that keeps things cold.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No. Uh, what about it?<eos> It's leaking... it's been leaking for two weeks.
"Not my chair, not my problem."<eos> Is that what you say?<eos> Davis...<eos> Davis...<eos> She's gone.<eos> The machine over there? Uh, my candy's stuck.<eos> It happens sometimes.<eos> Do you have a key or something we can open it up with?<eos> The machine doesn't belong to the hospital.<eos> It's a vending company.
Mm-hmm.<eos> Handing us that psychopath.<eos> And now...<eos> Now he's got another terminal case to show for it.<eos> Stage four cancer.<eos> You'd picked up on that, hadn't you?<eos> I figured.<eos> I appreciate you not making me talk about it.<eos> I got the diagnosis a few months ago.<eos> It's too advanced to do anything about it.
I hate to bring this up at a social dinner, but there's this detective in Florida that keeps calling us about Callahan.<eos> Asking questions, and...<eos> Well, he just won't leave it alone, and I have to handle it.<eos> Then handle it.<eos> Handle it.<eos> Well...<eos> Yeah.<eos> And, Morris, you and I gotta have a little sit-down here.<eos> What the fuck did you marinate this steak in?<eos> Because it's outta this world.
- By his hand, we'll be lifted up!<eos> That's why we have his logo seared on our backs!<eos> "Breeding stock!" "Battle fodder!"<eos> - No, I am awaited!<eos> - You're an old man's battle fodder!<eos> - Killing everyone and everything!<eos> - We're not to blame!<eos> Then who killed the world?<eos> I made a deal up ahead.<eos> Safe passage. I don't know if it's still any good.
What is this?<eos> This is where your little, uh, accident leads to.<eos> We put a camera on a drone we sent over there, the drone didn't come back but those images did.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Yes it is.<eos> New energy, resources.<eos> It's a whole new world.<eos> Which can help save this one.<eos> Not that it deserves to be saved.
- Concussion grenade!<eos> - Hand grenade.<eos> - Rocket launcher.<eos> - Missile launcher.<eos> - Air strike.<eos> - Nuclear strike.<eos> - Black hole.<eos> - God.<eos> We know what this comes down to.<eos> The Step King was very upset because when the real King pulled out his sword, it was long and shiny, and the Step King did shudder at the size of it.
Everyone's wrong.<eos> That's a good one.<eos> This is Wall Street, Dr. Burry.<eos> If you offer us free money, we are going to take it.<eos> My one concern is that when the bonds fail, uh, I want to be certain, um, of payment um, in case of solvency issues with your bank.<eos> I'm sorry, are you for real?<eos> You wanna bet against the housing market and you're worried we won't pay you?<eos> Yes, that's correct.<eos> ...unless the market crashes.<eos> The market on housing's never gonna crash because it's so solid right now.
Fuck, yeah, we did!<eos> - Fuck, yeah!<eos> - Which means...<eos> Which means if we're right...<eos> If we're right, people lose homes.<eos> People lose jobs.<eos> People lose retirement savings.<eos> People lose pensions.<eos> You know what I hate about fucking banking?<eos> It reduces people to numbers.
Terrific. We're a little early.<eos> What is that? !<eos> It's an aircraft carrier, Kuryakin.<eos> For a special agent, you aren't having a very special day, are you?<eos> Reflector lens.<eos> So, what does that do?<eos> Well, it's known as a coupler.<eos> It sends a signal which enables another missile to lock onto this one for double the impact.<eos> It's left over from when this was a warhead that contained conventional explosives.<eos> Now that we are converting it to nuclear, it's redundant.
If you don't hear from me in 20 minutes, kill her.<eos> That's how long you have to finish this.<eos> You can start by putting back the correct lens, Professor.<eos> So, Vinciguerra Island.<eos> The plot is... and stop me if I get this wrong, Jockelson... a stealth attack on the island from the sea.<eos> We shall go in through the front door here at the harbor. Jockelson and his men will get you in there and keep the enemy entertained.<eos> The rest is up to you.<eos> It's done.<eos> And with three minutes to spare.<eos> The computer disk with your research on it, where is it?
In their defense, they did share with her the very food they ate, or rather, the scraps from their table.<eos> She had little in the way of friends.<eos> Well, her friends were very little.<eos> There you are.<eos> Have dinner with me, won't you?<eos> But those friends she had, she treated with an open heart and an open hand.<eos> Your table.<eos> Sometimes, by the end of the day, the drafty attic was too cold to spend the night in, so she lay by the dying embers of the hearth to keep warm.<eos> I thought breakfast was ready.<eos> It is, madam.
I got to deal with these co-financiers in Texas.<eos> Do you know how hard I have worked to avoid going to Texas?<eos> Do you know what they do to Jews in Texas?<eos> Look, Ari, I didn't take an acting fee on this, which you know is more than the $10 million over budget we are.<eos> You're 15 over.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, well, I didn't take the fee because I wanted to direct.<eos> Now, we've known each other for 15 years, so you got to trust me.<eos> I didn't waste one single nickel.<eos> I've been killing myself to make this movie great, and I'm not gonna stop working until it is perfect.
I'm sure Ari has seen an unfinished film before.<eos> Not one I've directed.<eos> You're really nervous, huh?<eos> It's cute.<eos> What, you never get nervous before a photo shoot?<eos> No, I know what I look like.<eos> Everyone make sure you fill out a non-disclosure agreement or you cannot stay for the screening.<eos> Oh, e, this house is sick.<eos> When did Vince buy it?<eos> It's not Vince's.
I had to be real.<eos> If I played into it, no way it could be.<eos> That's really interesting.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now, come on, baby.<eos> Show me a little nip.<eos> Please?<eos> You are relentless.<eos> This is like our third session since last night.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm a little stressed about an audition I got tomorrow, and your voice, it soothes me.
Yes.<eos> You don't feel that is true, Ari?<eos> No, of course I don't feel that It's true 'cause It's not true.<eos> I promised my wife that If she let me go back to work, it would be nothing but fun, and it has been.<eos> I do almost nothing but smile all day.<eos> And the anger meds didn't make me calm.<eos> They just made me not able to come, which just made me angry.<eos> And just made my wife sore.<eos> Now, currently, I am a little bit stressed about this giant movie because I haven't been able to see it until yesterday.<eos> Thank God It's fucking amazing.
I don't care.<eos> Up to you.<eos> Tell them whatever you're comfortable with.<eos> That wasn't their only question.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> They wanted to confirm that there's something wrong with the movie, since you canceled the screening.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> That it was great.
Thank God!<eos> This was pointless.<eos> No, this isn't pointless.<eos> I get the point.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, n-not thank you, but, I mean, I'm sorry.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Whew.<eos> It's still too bleak.<eos> Yes, this movie will be an Oscar contender, but it also has commercial appeal, as well.
Whew.<eos> It's still too bleak.<eos> Yes, this movie will be an Oscar contender, but it also has commercial appeal, as well.<eos> The poster needs to let toothless guys in Texas, who snort meth and possibly fuck their sisters, know that It's also fun for a Saturday night.<eos> If only we could see it, Ari.<eos> DVDs are being made as we speak.<eos> Everyone can see it now.<eos> You've seen it?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> And it works?

You wanna use this guy so bad, have him set up traps around here, in this area.<eos> But he stays the hell away from the forest.<eos> - Alright?<eos> I mean it.<eos> - Anything you say, Deputy.<eos> I'm just here to help.<eos> But just so you know, this ain't your average bear.<eos> This is a clever one.<eos> I mean, how you think somethin' that big can hide that good and surprise two men in a clearing before they can get even one shot off?<eos> It's a smart fucker, that's how.
So, that's why you're comin' to me, now?<eos> Sure.<eos> Why else?<eos> I dunno, maybe you're worried that people might think it's your fault for lettin' assholes like Johnny Cadillac take poachers out there?<eos> I mean, I'm not judging' ya, Sully.<eos> I can't even say I blame ya.<eos> I mean, a man's gotta do what he's gotta do to survive.<eos> But, uh...<eos> With all the loggers and poachers, out there, it upsets the balance.<eos> See, this bear, it... it's not just territorial, or hungry...

There's your boy.<eos> - No, don't do that.<eos> Leave 'im...<eos> - Fuck off!<eos> Leave 'im up there.<eos> We'll come back and get help.<eos> You take 'im down now, the goddam bear'll leave nothin' to bury.<eos> - I imagine you woulda liked that.<eos> - Look, I'm sorry about that, OK?<eos> It's back!
Kaley's hurt.<eos> She can't walk.<eos> Gonna take your horse.<eos> - Is that right?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Well, listen, normally, I wouldn't mind givin' y'all a ride on ol' Gus, but see, right now, we're huntin', and we don't need no damn distractions.<eos> Well, you can keep on hunting'...<eos> I just need ol' Gus.<eos> See, if I don't find that bear, before it finds y'all... ain't gonna make it, anyway.<eos> - And it will hunt you.
It's not a joke.<eos> I think it's really cool you guys have stuck with Scouts.<eos> One day you're gonna look back on this and you're gonna be really happy you did it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Looks like the deer made out better than your car.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, where is it?
"...doesn't corrupt your art, only you can do that.<eos> "So, what do you think about that, Danny Collins?"<eos> -That is unreal.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> You know, you better have something to play me because if this is just a lame attempt to get me to your room then...<eos> -I have something to play you. Yes.<eos> -Oh.<eos> You're really going to play?<eos> Now, I haven't written anything in a long time. And piano's not my first language.<eos> Piano's my first love, but it's not my first language.
Fabulous secret powers were revealed to me... the day I held aloft my magic sword and said:<eos> By the power of Grayskull!<eos> He-Man!<eos> I have the power!<eos> Oh, so you watch cartoons?<eos> No, no, no, my friend.<eos> You stay under this roof, you make money for me.<eos> The first thing you do is you get your gun.<eos> Then you cock your gun.<eos> Now it's ready to shoot, nè?
It has already infiltrated all the city's networks and computers.<eos> This time, it only turned the lights out, but that was just a warning.<eos> - You're responsible for this disaster?<eos> - You call that little blackout a disaster?<eos> Oh, no. You ain't seen nothing yet, my friend, because what will follow will be a cataclysm.<eos> You're talking to the mayor of New York city.<eos> Stop this game right now.<eos> If this is a game, I make the rules.<eos> Right now, the virus is patiently biding its time.<eos> But tomorrow, at midnight, it will wake up and destroy everything.
It's okay, Joe.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Of course there is a church right there.<eos> And a playground.<eos> Joe, did you ever try and tell anyone?<eos> Like who?<eos> A Priest?<eos> Can I use your phone?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> You know where it is.
Where are you going?<eos> This is where your wire station's located, isn't it?<eos> We need to get to The Spectacle.<eos> - Spectacle?<eos> - Hey. Are you insane?<eos> They know that you sent her to me.<eos> They're gonna be waiting for us. Fine.<eos> Give me the Edison tube and we'll go without you.<eos> - I don't have the Edison tube.<eos> - It's in your bag.
Well, Frank, it's been wonderful catching up, but as we were fairly clear about the terms of your exile and the consequences of violating it,<eos> I have to ask what the hell are you doing here?<eos> I think she can fix it.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - I think she can fix it, David.<eos> - Wait.<eos> What?<eos> I've been pirating your signal.<eos> Every time you turn it on here, I can see it there.<eos> And it flickered.
It's just a matter of finding the right frequency...<eos> You grabbed a signal from another dimension.<eos> From a machine here.<eos> That means it's transmitting there.<eos> What if it's not just predicting the future?<eos> It's broadcasting it.<eos> When I touched this thing for a few minutes, it felt like anything was possible.<eos> So then why can't the opposite happen?<eos> What if The Monitor is just a giant pin?<eos> But instead of making you think positive, it makes you think negative and it...
That's Baron Bomine.<eos> He recruited me to be in his cabaret and his consort in public.<eos> Right.<eos> He, uh... prefers the company of men.<eos> I have a name now.<eos> I am Igor.<eos> What?<eos> It's perfect.<eos> This woman seems to think that the human brain is pink.<eos> In fact, it is grey.
Bodhi's gonna finish what Ozaki started, no matter what.<eos> But he needs money to do that.<eos> We've frozen their assets. They can't do a damn thing.<eos> Hugh, how many banks are in the area?<eos> There's more than a dozen.<eos> But this is Saturday, none are open.<eos> Except a small branch on top of the mountain.<eos> But no one would be crazy enough to try anything there.<eos> These guys would be.<eos> It's on top of a mountain.
- What? - I think that's...<eos> We're off the record, and Joel's always been good at understanding nuance.<eos> What's left to finish?<eos> I guess, in layman's terms, you'd have to say we don't have an OS.<eos> - An operating system?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, the OS is what runs the computer.<eos> In fact, it sort of is the computer.<eos> How has it been running?

The same people who wanted to dump the Super Bowl spot.<eos> And then I got on a plane to China.<eos> Mr. Sculley, there's a call for you on Line 1.<eos> Or I almost got on a plane, because I got a call in the lounge.<eos> Who made that call?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It matters to me.<eos> Who made the call?<eos> John Sculley.<eos> John, if you get on that plane, you'll have lost your job by the time it lands.
By the way, this is, um, this is my husband, Wayne.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sean.<eos> So, sweet pea, what do you say we go in the house and get ready for bed, okay'?<eos> Okay.<eos> Bye, Lucy.<eos> BYE-bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> So, how was the food at Chapman's?<eos> It was closed.
It's imaginary.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This will make it a lot easier to walk back to headquarters.<eos> Walk?<eos> We're not walking.<eos> We're taking the train of thought!<eos> The train, of course!<eos> That is so much faster!<eos> But how do we catch it?<eos> Well, it kind of goes all over the place, but there is a station in imagination land.
Don't even think about it.<eos> All right, I'm not the ice cream man.<eos> Six miles.<eos> Same pace, all right?<eos> Gotta lay down our base.<eos> Johnny.<eos> Johnny, why are your arms flying around everywhere?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why you riding a Barbie bike?<eos> Because it's pretty?
Do you like pink?<eos> - I love the company of women.<eos> - It's pretty.<eos> Did it take long?<eos> It seemed they knew something.<eos> Some men don't like pink.<eos> - But closer.<eos> - Now you tell me something.<eos> To the mystery.<eos> Treat this world as it deserves.
Rookie, just tell 'em what you saw.<eos> It was awful.<eos> It was like one of those monster movies, you know?<eos> But this time the monster was real.<eos> And who was this monster?<eos> Pac-Man.<eos> Pac-Man?<eos> Boom.<eos> That's my jam.<eos> Let's get us some light cannons and blow this sucker back to whatever planet it came from.
- No!<eos> A lie is a bad thing.<eos> I did a thing so you can live.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> My mom is here.<eos> You will never find her.<eos> It is 100%.<eos> Staying now does not make hope.<eos> Gorg mothership will be here soon.<eos> It destroys planets.
I was so scared we'd never see each other again.<eos> Mom, I never would have stopped looking until I found you.<eos> They are still looking.<eos> Gorg are not the takers.<eos> Boov are.<eos> We must demonstrate our affections later.<eos> There is still one problem.<eos> Excuse me, what is that?<eos> That is Gorg mothership.<eos> It is here to destroy the planet.

It's not gonna work!<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> - Now?<eos> - Just open it.<eos> Thank you, sweetheart, but what--<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Distracting the driver.<eos> It worked!<eos> The ship's stopping!<eos> It's not gonna stop in time!
It's not allowed, is it?<eos> You don't swim?<eos> I do in English.<eos> But not in French?<eos> In England...<eos> I mean, I don't swim in the barrage.<eos> Really?<eos> You sleeping here tonight?<eos> I think we killed a deer on the way here. It might not be dead.<eos> It's probably dying, but Mum won't go look.
Shit.<eos> So how will you get to Paris?<eos> By train.<eos> So why don't you?<eos> Where are we going?<eos> I want to find the deer.<eos> This is stupid. Putain.<eos> What will you do if you find it?<eos> I'll bury it.<eos> It was here somewhere.

- Yo, let's go.<eos> We have got to get a retail space.<eos> I'm so over these contractors nickel-and-diming our margins all day.<eos> I hear you, man.<eos> - Watch the mirror.<eos> That's it.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> voicemail: Hey, pal, it's Tarzan.<eos> Found your number on Google.<eos> Hope it's the right one.
Clitoria Labia is her name.<eos> - That's actually not bad.<eos> - It's not bad at all.<eos> She's the main bitch. She's like Cheetara and Grace Jones.<eos> And they always sing "Rapper's Delight" everywhere they go.<eos> So you and your friends, uh, frequent drag shows, do you?<eos> No. Well, sometimes.<eos> We just do it on the way up to Myrtle Beach every year.<eos> Oh, right. A stripper convention I keep hearing about.<eos> Yep, it's the infamous convention.
There was nothing I could do for her.<eos> Nothing.<eos> So I... put my hand over her... little neck.<eos> And I squeezed.<eos> I could feel the life going out of her.<eos> And then she breathed again.<eos> So I squeezed harder.<eos> And then... I realized I couldn't...<eos> I couldn't put her in the suitcase like that.<eos> It was too big.
- Plankton!<eos> My hero!<eos> You must need something, otherwise you wouldn't have come back.<eos> Plankton has a plan to save Bikini Bottom.<eos> It doesn't matter, Plankton.<eos> Krabs knows all your plans.<eos> He's been through my hard drive looking for the secret formula.<eos> I never had it.<eos> But we're going to get it.<eos> We're gonna go back in time to steal the formula before it disappeared.
I ain't been too smart since I found this old piece of paper!<eos> - What?<eos> - Incoming!<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Now all we need is some ink!<eos> Which Squidward has helpfully provided.<eos> It happens when I'm nervous.<eos> Whatever you're going to do, make it quick! They're closing in on us!<eos> I'm gonna write us an ending.<eos> Will it be a happy ending?
What are you going to do with me when you become famous?<eos> I'm gonna leave you.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You can be one of my fans.<eos> I'll be your biggest fan.<eos> OK.<eos> Now we gotta go. Yeah.<eos> I'm not going out.<eos> I've got to practice my monologue.<eos> But it's already good.
What are you, preparing for surgery?<eos> Okay, seriously?<eos> How did this even happen?<eos> No, no, I can set it up.<eos> She's just in a meeting.<eos> Hi, something I can help you with?<eos> Yes, Jules spilled soy sauce on her Saint Laurent jacket.<eos> Can you take it to the photo studio?<eos> There's lots of cleaners and stuff in there.<eos> - Sure, where is it?
My parents are sleep researchers, and they've been studying my sleep my whole life.<eos> Apparently, I'm a classic noisy sleeper.<eos> Fun getting to know me, huh?<eos> - It is.<eos> I never fall asleep in the car, so that was actually amazing.<eos> Apologize for the racket.<eos> Barely noticed.<eos> I'll pretend I believe you.<eos> I love this house.<eos> It just looks happy to me.

If I see him, I'll let you know.<eos> Thank you, take care then.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> - Ugh, take it easy, man.<eos> - Ah, fuck.<eos> Remigny, 1914.<eos> That was France.<eos> I had a hard time readjusting to the language.<eos> It changed quite a bit since the last time I needed it.
I like that.<eos> The geometry of belief.<eos> You're wondering why you can't look inside my head.<eos> Sometimes it's hard.<eos> But sooner or later, every man shows himself.<eos> Oh, I'm sure they do.<eos> But you needed something more than a man.<eos> That's why you let Stark take the sceptre.<eos> I didn't expect, but I saw Stark's fear.<eos> I knew it would control him.
- Pietro.<eos> - No, please.<eos> We were 10 years old.<eos> Having dinner, the four of us.<eos> When the first shell hits, two floors below, it makes a hole in the floor.<eos> It's big.<eos> Our parents go in and the whole building starts coming apart.<eos> I grab her, roll under the bed, and the second shell hits.<eos> But it doesn't go off.<eos> It just sits there in the rubble.
I saw a documentary. It was terrifying.<eos> So if you're going to fiddle with my brain and make me see a giant cuttlefish, then I know you don't do business.<eos> And I know you're not in charge.<eos> And I only deal with the man in charge.<eos> There is no man in charge.<eos> Let's talk business.<eos> Upon this rock, I will build my church.<eos> Vibranium.<eos> You know, it came at great personal cost.<eos> It's worth billions.
"I miss him already."<eos> Hold your fire!<eos> Romanoff!<eos> Thanks!<eos> The anti-gravs are rigged to flip.<eos> Touch them, they'll go full reverse thrust.<eos> The city's not coming down slow.<eos> Spire is vibranium.<eos> If I get Thor to hit it...<eos> It will crack.
- So, it doesn't count?<eos> No, it's not like a person lifting the hammer.<eos> Right, different rules for us.<eos> - Nice guy. Artificial.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> He can wield the hammer, he can keep the Mind Stone.<eos> It's safe with the Vision.<eos> And these days, safe is in short supply.<eos> But if you put the hammer in an elevator...<eos> - It would still go up.
Yeah.<eos> It's fun.<eos> We have fun.<eos> Hope you don't mind me crashing the party.<eos> It's awesome.<eos> They've told me so much about you.<eos> We hit a coyote on the way up here.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> It just came out of nowhere.

Libby, I'm...<eos> No, you don't get to ask me fucking questions.<eos> I mean, here comes my little sister after all these years. And I'm thinking,<eos> "maybe this one thing will work out."<eos> Maybe I won't be so fucking lonely.<eos> We can talk about a goddamn horse, that's all I'm asking for, something just as tiny as that.<eos> I don't remember the horse.<eos> Yellow?<eos> It was a dirty old farm horse.<eos> But it was your horse.
Be quiet.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Somebody's been in my room.<eos> Oh, god.<eos> You don't...<eos> You don't think it's the cops, do you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I got a present for you, for the baby.<eos> - You got me a present?<eos> - Yeah, but it's not here.
No!<eos> Why'd you make me do this?<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> No!<eos> Get the fuck off of her.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Mom, I'm sorry.<eos> I saw the cross was gone and I panicked.<eos> It's okay, sweetie.<eos> Go get the gun. It's in the cabinet.
Your opening statement, please.<eos> Mr. Chief Justice, if this law were to be applied retroactively, it could open claims brought against a number of foreign states, which would further complicate our international relations.<eos> Give me an example.<eos> Currently, there are cases pending against countries such as Japan and France.<eos> So what you're saying is Mrs. Altmann shouldn't try to reclaim her paintings because it would affect our relations with Japan?<eos> That could be a possible outcome, Your Honor.<eos> Mrs. Altmann, it would seem that if your case goes forward, world diplomacy will collapse, and you will be solely responsible.<eos> Mr. Schoenberg.<eos> Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the court... we believe applying the FSIA is not impermissibly retroactive.<eos> Why isn't it just as easy to say that it does act retroactively?
All your life.<eos> You have greatness in you, Wolfgang.<eos> You don't belong in a shitty apartment.<eos> Are you insulting my home?<eos> I mean no offense.<eos> I've come here as one who understands your worth.<eos> I've come to offer you wealth, power and pussy like you have never known.<eos> Um... whatever pussy you might be hiding under there, I can tell you we've no interest.<eos> You and I could own this city.<eos> If I was interested, it'd already be mine.
I'm gonna talk to Dad about business.<eos> All right?<eos> You gonna come bring the books by the garage later?<eos> Yeah, I'm gonna bring them later.<eos> He's in the basement.<eos> I'm joking with you.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> Kids, we're gonna do something fun later, OK?<eos> We're doing something fun now.<eos> Oh, we found your luggage but it's in Cleveland.
Rudy, she's thinking about something.<eos> Maybe it's a good dream, and she's working something out.<eos> I don't wanna work anything out.<eos> I just want a nice, dumb sleep.<eos> Let's knock her out.<eos> Give her a children's cough medicine.<eos> -That's what does it.<eos> -Is that safe?<eos> No. It's not safe.<eos> It's expired.
Come back!<eos> Quiet, girl.<eos> No!<eos> Rey?<eos> These are your first steps.<eos> What was that?<eos> I shouldn't have gone in there.<eos> That lightsaber was Luke's.<eos> And his father's before him.<eos> And now, it calls to you.
Whomever you're waiting for on Jakku... they're never coming back.<eos> But... there's someone who still could.<eos> Luke.<eos> The belonging you seek is not behind you... it is ahead.<eos> I am no Jedi, but I know the Force.<eos> It moves through and surrounds every living thing.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> Feel it.<eos> The light... it's always been there.<eos> It will guide you.
I'm not giving you anything.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> That you will never be as strong as Darth Vader.<eos> The scavenger... resisted you?<eos> She is strong with the Force.<eos> Untrained, but stronger than she knows.<eos> And the droid?<eos> Ren believed it was no longer valuable to us.
Get.<eos> That's where we're goin'.<eos> Straight through this place and deeper in.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't be going some place that looks like a burial ground.<eos> To a bunch of godless savages.<eos> Ain't no concern of the civilized man.<eos> A jail on fire is safer than a place like this.<eos> It's better than sittin' in that damn gulch, riders comin' in from one way and savages the other.<eos> You want to go back there, go.<eos> If that was a gust, then it learned an instrument!
Okay, what about Wayne?<eos> - Wayne?<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> He's my boy.<eos> - Then maybe something other than tennis?<eos> Okay, so, what you wanna do is lift the racket right on impact, so you get that nice top spin.<eos> Try and hit one.<eos> What is that?<eos> What's the noise?<eos> It's on me!
I saw you spying on us, child.<eos> Was his proposal so outrageous as to merit such a harsh answer from you?<eos> It wasn't his proposal, my love.<eos> It was him.<eos> There's something about him that I don't like.<eos> What, I don't know.<eos> And I don't like not knowing.<eos> What I saw was a dreamer facing defeat.<eos> Did you see his suit?<eos> It was beautifully tailored, but at least a decade old.
I advise you to return to your ghosts and fancies.<eos> The sooner, the better.<eos> You know precious little of the human heart, or love, or the pain that comes with it.<eos> You're nothing but a spoiled child!<eos> How's the water today, Benton?<eos> Piping hot.<eos> Just the way you like it, sir.<eos> Very well.<eos> Be kind enough to order me some ham and eggs.<eos> I'll start with coffee, if it's hot and a sip of port.
Come on!<eos> To my hand.<eos> Come on, to my hand.<eos> Come on.<eos> Go fetch!<eos> Hi.<eos> Where's your ball?<eos> Did you lose your ball?<eos> Hi.<eos> Where'd it go?
What is it?<eos> Firethorn berries.<eos> They're very good for you.<eos> You don't like it?<eos> It's a little bitter.<eos> I'm afraid nothing gentle ever grows in this land.<eos> You need a measure of bitterness not to be eaten.<eos> What was that?<eos> That's the east wind.<eos> When it picks up, the chimneys form a vacuum and with the windows all shuttered up, the house...
We were hoping you were here.<eos> I found him wandering the hallway.<eos> Made us some tea.<eos> Oh, you're too kind.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> We needed the company.<eos> Thomas?<eos> Uh, not for me, thank you.<eos> Drink your tea.<eos> It'll warm you.
Whoo! Look at that kick!<eos> Axé.<eos> Good job, James!<eos> You looked good out there, my big strong fiancé.<eos> Jaoa says I need to focus on bringing my power into the world.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Maybe I can help.<eos> You... Are a great man, James King.<eos> Do me on the new house.<eos> Did it get bigger?
I'm ready for it.<eos> You know, I bought an island in Cape Verde?<eos> An entire island.<eos> You can, too.<eos> I would love to. We could be island neighbors.<eos> You could swim over and borrow a cup of gold.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, and to think it all started with this.<eos> I still have that computer.<eos> It reminds me... Of my humble beginnings.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, James, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Is my eye twitching?<eos> No!<eos> Answer the question. Is my eye twitching?<eos> It look fine. Yeah?
While he's just going to town on that food.<eos> So, yeah, that's the best of times.<eos> Meanwhile, some other guy is having his will broken by professional torturers... over a crocodile-infested pool of acid.<eos> And because it's acid, these crocodiles are just pissed.<eos> And they're also piping in that gross smell you get when they spill a bunch of milk in the school parking lot.<eos> And this beefy torture dude is just punching the hell out of him.<eos> Check.<eos> All right, look.<eos> I'll just start.<eos> This is the story of my senior year of high school and how it destroyed my life.

What the hell does that mean?<eos> What it means is, at the present, your tub here is just a tub.<eos> Wait, are you saying that time travel is not even possible?<eos> Right on, Liz.<eos> Give the pretty lady a flower.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> -Lizzie.<eos> That's bullshit, okay?<eos> We got a whole vault of nitro right here.<eos> Where'd it go?

PRISONER: Stay strong, carnal.<eos> This was found in your cell.<eos> You added $900 to all your pals' commissary accounts in your cell block.<eos> Is this the attack tool?<eos> With it, you open up a terminal and that gives you a command line?<eos> That how you broke into the network and plussed—up the balances?<eos> No.<eos> I used it to call Santa in the North Pole and told him to do Christmas early this year.<eos> (DAWAI SPEAKING MAN DARIN) ...malware took over their monitoring. It read everything was okay. ...while the cooling system was destroyed.<eos> How did it get in?
It's Ramsey.<eos> Send in the predator!<eos> Take her out!<eos> Releasing predator.<eos> I think we lost the chopper.<eos> I think we got bigger problems than that!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Going old school!<eos> It's coming back around!
And how do you feel now?<eos> Still uncomfortable.<eos> This is not what I want.<eos> It is what you want but it makes you feel like a bad person to want it.<eos> You're acting really crazy.<eos> I don't like this.<eos> Why can't you say you like my story?<eos> I don't know!<eos> I'm jealous!<eos> It's better than mine. Sheesh!
Get your notebook and pencil and do your math!<eos> I can't see a thing.<eos> Is your bag heavy?<eos> - No...<eos> Good...<eos> This cement sure is!<eos> Tell Voja to stop by for a chat.<eos> - I will.<eos> I'd come over to your place, but I have to wait for the bell.<eos> When will it arrive?
He said -<eos> I heard what he said Sarah.<eos> Now shut it.<eos> Ha.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Take our picture and post it online?<eos> No, idiot.<eos> There's still a payphone out there.<eos> Remember?<eos> If it works we can let the warden know.
But it's so far from the station.<eos> Are you right there, Muriel?<eos> Yeah, good, thanks, love.<eos> Bulb's gone.<eos> Tilly got in another tea chest.<eos> Where from this time?<eos> Paris?<eos> Milan?<eos> New York.<eos> And it's full of cottons and a peacock crest too.
- I don't wanna hear your shit.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm cool with that.<eos> Hey, Rocky, what do you think?<eos> Did you see a big white light?<eos> Huh?<eos> You know, that part's actually true.<eos> - You know what the pineal gland is?<eos> - No.<eos> It produces DMT, which is the base compound for our serum.
My legs are shorter than yours.<eos> Detective Hauser, come back.<eos> You know protocol.<eos> All evidence has to be submitted in a proper-size Nolan envelope.<eos> This is dangerous and could hurt someone.<eos> You encounter a lot of danger here, Coop?<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.<eos> The other day they brought in a duffle bag.<eos> I opened it, there was a live raccoon in there.<eos> It could've had rabies.
I'm getting sick now.<eos> - Hannibal.<eos> - I just fed you!<eos> I'm gonna give you the Heimlich, all right?<eos> This is where I go down!<eos> This is my banjo hand!<eos> The dog doesn't have the finger.<eos> What?<eos> The dog... doesn't have the finger!<eos> It's in my hair!
How embarrassing!<eos> Nice face...<eos> Right?<eos> Yes, nice face.<eos> What's between them?<eos> What is it?<eos> - You decide.<eos> - Right this minute?<eos> - This film's perfect for you.<eos> - I feel it, it's my film.
- Well...<eos> Well, what?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Today's scene and the 28th take place on the same day?<eos> Of course, Barry's dressed like in the 28th.<eos> Sorry, tell me.<eos> I'm afraid she'll get anxious, not understanding why, suddenly, they're all coming to visit.<eos> I don't know if Mom knows about her health, or how much!<eos> This talk bothers me.<eos> It bothers you, but unfortunately we have to deal with it.
You know who Francesca is?<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom?<eos> Mom, is this you?<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Hello, I'm from Elgi, a new electric company.<eos> You must have a contract with another company, but I offer you 0,09 euros per kW.<eos> If you give me a bill, I'll show you incredible savings.<eos> Thank you, but this is my mother's house.<eos> Get a bill, even if it's not the most recent.
Those banners that friends and relatives put up.<eos> Those words bother me.<eos> They're not true and they don't help anyone.<eos> - Show me!<eos> - Here, the gulet's beautiful.<eos> I'd take a nice journey in a gulet, you can even choose.<eos> A gulet is a schooner with two or three jibs.<eos> - Rocky?<eos> Sinks?<eos> - No, it won't sink.
Everyone knows you're broke.<eos> You will take one million.<eos> Golly, that was a big one!<eos> Well, have it your way, Fang.<eos> One million pounds.<eos> I trust that you have brought the treasuries?<eos> I think I'll keep the money.<eos> And the vase.<eos> You cheated me in our last deal.<eos> I paid three million for that tapestry, then found out it is worth only one!
You're joking, right?<eos> You get a promotion and you're quitting?<eos> Look, this career just ain't for me.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Hey, man, thanks for everything.<eos> Just wanna talk to you about my job.<eos> - You see your new office? - Hmm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, um...<eos> Well, what's it like?
Yes.<eos> I was given specific instructions by Elaine to tailor these gadgets to you.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - Wow, look at that watch.<eos> These are not yours. Oh. Is that a rape whistle?<eos> Elaine wanted you to only be carrying items a single woman travelling through Europe would have.<eos> But she could get that at any pharmacy.<eos> Not this whistle.<eos> When you blow through this whistle, a small, poisonous dart flies out... neutralizing your target.<eos> Also, it needs your fingerprints on it to work.
it's your turn to fuck.<eos> Oh really?<eos> 'Cause you haven't fucked anybody yet.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's based on attempts.<eos> You see? I tried one, you gotta try one.<eos> Uh,excuseme ? Sir?<eos> Ya, you, little guy.<eos> Would you mind helping me with this kitty litter?<eos> It's just a little too heavy for me.
Can you hear me now?<eos> Here is the hand brake. -OK<eos> Switch on here and you have to warm it just a little... for a few of seconds. Then you just start it.<eos> Was that part of the course?<eos> Yeah... it was supposed to be a driving range.<eos> But we stopped maintaining it.<eos> Why?<eos> -The goddamn tern seized the area.<eos> It's incredibly hostile.<eos> It starting spreading so we couldn't mow it anymore.
Does the fertilizer reflect the sun rays back on me?<eos> What is he lubing up with?<eos> -He's always experimenting.<eos> Now it's cooking oil. -You're kidding!<eos> Finni. -Yeah?<eos> Have you tried fish oil?<eos> -No, is that good?<eos> Works like a charm.<eos> It penetrates the skin and gives a deeper tan.<eos> Okay... Doesn't it smell bad?
- It's not a stake-out.<eos> - Isn't that Dusty's car?<eos> Now it's a stake-out.<eos> Jesus Christ, what is she doing?<eos> God, she must have changed her shift.<eos> Fuck, I need that amp.<eos> I need it.<eos> It's first and last, okay?<eos> It's a vintage amp.<eos> It's worth a lot.

You inspire me.<eos> It tastes the same.<eos> Amy.<eos> I'm not trying to punish you.<eos> Does it feel a little like I am?<eos> No, no, I appreciate the...<eos> I know you want to branch out and cover more, and you do know I'm looking for a new executive editor, don't you?<eos> I do know that, and I'm very, very interested. Hmm.<eos> I'd love to be considered.<eos> Especially my dad's house isn't selling and my sister and I just had to put him in this assisted living place, and you would think it was like the Waldorf.
All right, fine.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll put my credit card in.<eos> Put a credit card in, we'll split it.<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I think I left my wallet.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> It's right in the car.
So you found the right address.<eos> - Why did you do it?<eos> - Sir?<eos> Break into my study.<eos> My study is my sanctum sanctorum.<eos> Private place.<eos> Before you went to Japan, I saw you writing that story.<eos> I didn't know you wrote stories.<eos> Oh, Dr. Watson, yes, he was the writer.<eos> Well, so I borrowed Mum's key and went into your study, and there it was.
- I fear it's so.<eos> You are very great detective!<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> My mother, she wonders if you have brought your famous hat.<eos> Oh, the deer stalker.<eos> That was an embellishment of the illustrator.<eos> I've never worn one.<eos> - And the pipe?<eos> - I prefer a cigar.<eos> I told Watson, if I ever write a story myself, it will be to correct the million misconceptions... created by his imaginative licence.
Check out what we got, it's pancakes and fruit.<eos> Let's check it out...<eos> Pancakes.<eos> It's really good.<eos> Really, really good.<eos> You wanna try it?<eos> It goes with syrup too.<eos> - Everything's looking good.<eos> - You wanna try syrup?<eos> It's very sweet.
Yeah.<eos> I love reading.<eos> What made you come all the way here today?<eos> I wanna talk to someone who's not around anymore.<eos> Who?<eos> My mom.<eos> She died a year and a half ago.<eos> She had cancer.<eos> I mean, well, first she had breast cancer and then she had a Mastectomy, but it decided to hang around and travel to her lungs.<eos> So, I guess you could say it wanted to be with her just as much as everyone else did.
- He yells me over.<eos> - Skelly!<eos> And what he says chills me to the bone.<eos> - What'd he say?<eos> - "Be a thousand by the 'morrow."<eos> The next morning, I go to get the poster, and pin it up in the next town.<eos> The poster ain't there.<eos> I hear a gunshot and a body hit dirt.<eos> Spin around to see this mean son of a bitch leaning over a... blob.<eos> Well, I'm presuming this bastard seen the poster, thought it real, and gunned down Bill for the reward.
Life's challenges are just the bending of the bow.<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> The bigger the challenge, the more the bow bends, the more potential you create to do something amazing. Right.<eos> All you have to do is just... find a purpose.<eos> - Find the arrow that you're gonna put in that bow. - :<eos> Okay.<eos> - You still got it. - I still got it!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No. No. The only difference with my situation is that the bow didn't just bend, it broke.
Well...<eos> If that is indeed the case, then find me a husband.<eos> A husband?<eos> What sort of husband would you like?<eos> I'd like my husband to be courageous and strong and... handsome.<eos> I'm sure such a man exists, but until we find him,<eos> Please, do not agitate yourself over a future none of us can predict.<eos> Now, let us finish our supper.<eos> - What is it, my dear?<eos> - It's not cooked enough.
He wasn't married.<eos> You know that.<eos> Patricia.<eos> I don't think she's left the house since he died.<eos> I used to see her every morning, watering her pink hydrangeas in front of their light brown house.<eos> Patricia has a real way with flowers.<eos> "Do not try to leave.<eos> "Do not discuss the past.<eos> "Do not discuss your life before.<eos> Always answer the phone if it rings."
Driving. We were looking for you.<eos> We got a... the car had, like, an oil leak or a spill or something, and then we woke up in the hospital.<eos> And there was a realtor that picked us up at the hospital, that drove us here and said that this was where you were staying.<eos> Well, I think that takes care of everything.<eos> Mr. Burke, good to see you again.<eos> I've gotten Theresa and Ben all situated.<eos> Welcome home.<eos> This house belonged to Beverly Brown.<eos> Yes. But it's your house now.<eos> And like all the houses in Wayward Pines, it comes equipped with a state-of-the-art security system.
It's like... it's like being in a well sometimes.<eos> I can see it, I can hear it, but nobody knows I'm there.<eos> I'd... I'd like to help you.<eos> Whatever is going on.<eos> Judith was first brought to the institute in September of 1976 by her sister... sister Margaret.<eos> She had been reading about the work we were doing in a small magazine or something. And she thought we would be interested in testing Judith.<eos> The first thing she did when she walked in was she told me it was my birthday.<eos> Which caught me a bit off guard.<eos> Not because it was my birthday.<eos> It wasn't, it was the day before.
It was a shamrock.<eos> As soon as I saw that picture,<eos> I realized what Judith had whispered to me.<eos> "You weren't there."<eos> Which is true, I wasn't.<eos> My mother died the day before I made it home.<eos> And that woman... that thing somehow knew that. And how much guilt.<eos> She wanted me to behave that way.<eos> She wanted me to react that way. To humiliate me in front of my peers by turning me into everything I had tried so hard not to be.<eos> Well, the incident with Susan was very unsettling because it demonstrated Judith's ability to influence us.
I was surprised he didn't leave the institute sooner than he did.<eos> It was a shame what happened to his nephew.<eos> I don't think Lawrence ever really forgave himself.<eos> Well, we couldn't discount the events that happened outside the institute.<eos> Too much happened for it to be coincidence.<eos> But what it did do is make us rethink our strategy.<eos> What are we gonna use to immobilize her?<eos> Fentanyl.<eos> The gas derivative of it should knock her out in seconds.<eos> It could also kill her.
But it's just like pulling teeth to get this guy off Broadway.<eos> Or even off-off-Broadway, if you know what I mean, right?<eos> Um, it's good to see you, Kurt.<eos> I ran into Blaine and Karofsky last night.<eos> Then I spent the rest of the night having a fantasy about singing "It's Too Late" all over town.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Hey.<eos> Why don't we use Carole King's seminal break-up album Tapestry as this week's lesson?<eos> Yeah, it's brilliant, but, I mean, it's sort of a downer, don't you think?<eos> If we're gonna do a break-up album, then it has to be Jagged Little Pill, 'cause it's modern and edgy and angry.
We are the darkness.<eos> A trial, which potentially, could have very far-reaching implications has just started in New York City.<eos> A jury will decide a case that could impact the future of Internet privacy.<eos> Thousands of drugs came through the black website called "Silk Road."<eos> The government overstepped their boundaries to acquire the info they claim they have.<eos> This is not going away. This is gonna be the biggest takedown of what is currently in existence.<eos> On January 13, 2015, a criminal trial began for the accused leader of the Silk Road, a black market in an area of the Internet known as "the deep web."<eos> The deep web is vast, thousands of times larger than the visible Internet, what's called the "surface web."<eos> But the deep web is not a place.<eos> It simply accounts for all of the unindexed content online... banking data, administrative code for governments, corporations and universities.
So, oxycodone, all of those.<eos> Codeine, black tar heroin.<eos> You name it, they have it.<eos> They're all listed in the light of day.<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> The Silk Road's success was largely due to an innovative combination of Tor and Bitcoin.<eos> Bitcoin is a technology that uses cryptographic code to create digital currency.<eos> The sender transmits their Bitcoin code through a ledger called the "block chain" to arrive at the recipient.<eos> Bitcoin is not perfectly anonymous.<eos> But if used carefully, it facilitates online purchases without revealing identity.
The slaps, the punches, the forearm.<eos> It is an unremitting storm of sub-concussive blows.<eos> The head as a weapon on every single play of every single game... of every single practise, from the time he was a little boy to a college man, culminating in an 18-year professional career.<eos> By my calculations,<eos> Mike Webster sustained more than 70,000 blows to his head.<eos> Now, now, these men, these men, these are the fastest.<eos> Now, their speed multiplied by the speed of the men who hit them, the G-forces generated... equivalent to hitting them on the helmet with a sledgehammer.<eos> all of this... triggered a cascading series of neurological events... which unleashed killer proteins upon Mike Webster's brain, the tangles invading and strangling his mind from the inside out.<eos> Like pouring wet concrete down kitchen pipes.<eos> As it hardens, it chokes the brain, leaving him unrecognisable, even to himself.
...that Guthrie cunt...<eos> Now get the fuck out.<eos> All right.<eos> Fuck!<eos> You have absolutely nothing to worry about.<eos> Though I would recommend avoiding her for a while.<eos> Get the fuck out.<eos> If we are all going to make something of this place, perhaps it is in everyone's best interest that you and I find a way past all of this, past your anger towards me.<eos> I'm not gonna warn you again.<eos> Your anger... it is understandable.
Of course not.<eos> Susan Harris.<eos> Midtown Property Solutions.<eos> Matt Murdock.<eos> She just curtsied.<eos> It was adorable.<eos> Well, it's nice to know chivalry isn't dead.<eos> Susan, would you mind walking me around the space?<eos> Of course. My pleasure.<eos> As I was telling your associate, this office was barely touched by the incident, which is why it's on the market already.
Never mind.<eos> Well, the only bad news here is that my husband and I will be getting a late start on our camping trip and we'll probably end up by the outhouse... again.<eos> I'll try not to blame you.<eos> - So...<eos> - She's fine!<eos> You're fine.<eos> - But the nosebleed?<eos> - Nosebleeds happen.<eos> Especially when the weather gets drier.<eos> I did notice that your platelet count was a teeny bit off, but... It's still in the normal range.
They're not in a rush.<eos> I know I don't really seem like a religious person.<eos> But, um, there is just something about lying in a hospital bed that you start to see the value in stuff like this.<eos> Which is funny timing, considering I am about to become a woman, one year after having both of my ovaries removed.<eos> Luckily, we Jews love irony.<eos> Oh, hello, dear.<eos> How was your day at school?<eos> It's high school.<eos> Sorry, how was your day in hell?<eos> It's not even over yet.
Tomorrow?<eos> I can't just drop out of my life that fast.<eos> I... I mean, give me a couple off days at least.<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> Last time with George, I didn't even start for a few weeks.<eos> This isn't like last time.<eos> Since your cancer has returned this aggressively and this quickly, it's much more serious.<eos> It's still the same cancer as before.<eos> How much more serious can it be?
That's our team psychologist, the social worker and the financial coordinator.<eos> Well, how...<eos> How much is the transplant?<eos> Anywhere from $100,000 to $200,000.<eos> Our... our insurance covers all that, right?<eos> You focus on your next couple of rounds of chemo to get you ready for your transplant.<eos> So... who's this donor?<eos> Well, donors on the national registry must remain anonymous.<eos> We don't even know where in the country they are.<eos> But whoever it is, I'm sure they know that they're doing something extraordinary.
After the other night, I didn't know what to say.<eos> I still don't.<eos> Considering the day I'm having, you dating my ex-boyfriend is the least of my worries.<eos> I'm not gonna keep you from doing what makes you happy.<eos> So you're okay with me and Dominic dating?<eos> I'm not gonna keep you from doing it.<eos> Let's just leave it at that.<eos> - Do you still want my bone marrow?<eos> - I'm gonna need it.<eos> - It's yours.
Your cancer is back, April!<eos> - Really?<eos> - Doesn't that piss you off?<eos> Doesn't it make you wanna beat the crap out of something?<eos> Getting angry and smashing things isn't gonna help anything.<eos> You have every right and every reason in the world to get pissed off!<eos> Actually, you wanna know what pisses me off?<eos> You should've caught this sooner!<eos> I came to you weeks ago saying that something was wrong,<eos> - that I thought it was back.
He's watching us Right now.<eos> You can see him?<eos> Sun's glinting off his binoculars.<eos> What's that building over there?<eos> That's Mr. Moehner's warehouse.<eos> And the boats at the dock there?<eos> Klaus's. Mr. Moehner's Why?<eos> Them's what I heard the first night.<eos> Their voices. Their talk.<eos> It came across water like they were whispering in my ear
David Foster Wallace.<eos> "Next year's book awards have been decided..."<eos> Can you believe this?<eos> "The plaques and citations can now be put into escrow."<eos> It's unbelievable.<eos> "With Infinite Jest by David Foster Wallace, a plutonium-dense, satirical quiz-kid opus "that runs to almost 1,000..." What? ,000 pages,<eos> "not including footnotes, the competition has been obliterated. "It's as though Paul Bunyan had joined the NFL, "or Wittgenstein had gone onto Jeopardy!<eos> "The novel is that colossally disruptive, and that spectacularly good."<eos> That's the fucking opening paragraph.<eos> What if it actually is that good?
That's, um...<eos> Mmm. Actually, can I use your bathroom for a second?<eos> - I believe it's unoccupied.<eos> -Right.<eos> So, uh, do you not have a television?<eos> I do not have a TV, no.<eos> How come?<eos> Because if I had a TV, I would watch it all the time.<eos> Ah.<eos> I don't even know if I'd watch it all the time, but it would be on all the time.
Like, 21, something like that.<eos> - Really?<eos> Never before?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> Nah, I think I started a World War ll novel when I was, like, nine.<eos> - Did you?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> - Oh, that's very ambitious.<eos> -Oh, thank you.<eos> It was so good.
The one in the globe.<eos> My own formula didn't work!<eos> April, the serum we left you, we've tested for 10 years, but to no avail.<eos> We recreated it here, and it always failed.<eos> 329!<eos> Uh... I'm 156, Mama.<eos> This is Spyrat-217 that we sent to your laboratory.<eos> It only took a few drops of your serum for him to recover from his encounter with your cat.<eos> Like Darwin, this rodent has mutated.<eos> It can regenerate and survive any attack on its cells.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Well, then there's nothing more to talk about.<eos> I will beat this.<eos> Ergo, a falsis principiis proficisci.<eos> - Meaning...<eos> - That's not...<eos> - Meaning...<eos> - That's the one about false principles...<eos> You proceed from false principles.<eos> Your argument is built on quicksand, therefore it collapses.
Wake up<eos> Get up<eos> Sit down and sit over there<eos> Put your hands behind your back<eos> A basketball weights between 550 and 650 grams<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't know that<eos> Yes<eos> The weight is different for men's and women's game<eos> That's roughly how much it weights
It goes so fast, they don't have reception.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Can I ask you a question?<eos> If you were a guy...<eos> - "If"?<eos> .. - What...<eos> - What? - Huh?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> What would this outfit say to you?<eos> What do you want it to say?
I think you act dumber than you really are.<eos> All right, here we go, okay?<eos> Two crombies.<eos> What is this?<eos> Okay.<eos> You gotta pay.<eos> Right here.<eos> What?<eos> Put your hand on the scanner.<eos> What's it gonna do to my hand?
That is so offensive.<eos> Why?<eos> That isn't racist.<eos> I know it's not racist.<eos> I like margaritas.<eos> I'm just offended that you think I would date you.<eos> Has anyone seen Andrew?<eos> Andrew!<eos> Hey, Andrew, could you please get your phone?<eos> It's ringing off the hook, man.
-Tim!<eos> -Uh, last quarter, 22415.<eos> See?<eos> Look at him.<eos> He's a model employee now.<eos> Wait, you did this intentionally?<eos> Corporate was threatening to shut down the entire branch, I simply presented Ted with an alternative.<eos> His methods may seem a little unorthodox, but you can't argue with the results.<eos> After your little stunt in college! The only school that would take me was this university in Romania.<eos> But it turns out, it had a very unique MBA program, a whole new paradigm in business management
Oh, my God.<eos> Philippe, you've done it.<eos> My Philippe-<eos> No, no, no!<eos> No, don't cut the wire!<eos> Don't cut my wire!<eos> No!<eos> Nobody gives a damn about your wire!<eos> -There's too much tension!<eos> It will snap! It will hurt somebody!
Congratulations.<eos> I certainly hope you do better than poor Peter.<eos> Of course, I knew he'd never make it.<eos> Far too much of a freethinker.<eos> You know what?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Let's take a look at this house.<eos> I really think you're gonna love it.<eos> It has a big yard, it's on a corner lot, and it's private, very private.
Come with me, back to Wayward Pines.<eos> Pilcher!<eos> Put down your weapon.<eos> Put it down.<eos> What is this?<eos> Some kind of an experiment?<eos> That's not Boise, okay?<eos> I know Boise.<eos> Your mind is lashing out, Ethan.<eos> It doesn't want to accept the truth, but trust your own eyes, everything you've seen today.
Honey, let's get in the house now, okay?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> She said she doesn't understand how we could live here.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - In this house.<eos> Why would she say that?<eos> Did something happen here?<eos> No, nothing happened here.<eos> This is a great house, give it time, it'll be home before you know it.
Seriously?<eos> You give classes?<eos> Sure!<eos> I taught Otto all Spanish he know.<eos> I speaks fucking Spanish good.<eos> Black sheep in every class.<eos> NO worry, in quick as wink, you framing certificate.<eos> Hello, Nadia!<eos> What do you think of my new executive office?<eos> It couldn't be more German.
Forgive me for trying!<eos> Doesn't it give me a certain look?<eos> It's Nadia, get ready!<eos> And don't screw up this time.<eos> I won't!<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm great.<eos> What do you think of my new manager's office?<eos> It couldn't be more German.
It's Nadia, get ready!<eos> And don't screw up this time.<eos> I won't!<eos> Hello, darling!<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm great.<eos> What do you think of my new manager's office?<eos> It couldn't be more German.<eos> It's super-cute!<eos> Move the camera a bit, so I can see big it is and the view you have.
You know?<eos> I mean, Jesus. Don't make a big deal out of it.<eos> [Door closes] Hi, little ones.<eos> She bangs, she bangs.<eos> - Right back at ya, Marnie's mom. - [clicks tongue] Uh-huh.<eos> I woke up in Harlem smelling like moussaka and I didn't have time to go home and change.<eos> There's a lot of really exciting things happening above 125th Street that I'm very happy to know about.<eos> I stopped at the First Corinthians Church for a musical interlude and then on my way downtown, I rescued a kitten.<eos> - Aw.<eos> - Ooh, where is it?
Oh... - Lion.<eos> - Mm-hm.<eos> Rhinoceros.<eos> - Camel.<eos> - Good.<eos> What color is Rudolph's nose?<eos> - Rudolph?<eos> - Reindeer.<eos> Red.<eos> It's red.
Which one you want?<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Remember when you'd never eat a burger if it didn't have bacon on it?<eos> Dad would get so pissed because he hated the smell of bacon grease on the grill.<eos> I'm trying to listen, Gary.<eos> The president's hands are tied.<eos> Might as well let him burn.<eos> They're getting their marshmallows ready.<eos> Look at Underwood's approval rating.<eos> It's worse than Walker's before he resigned.
Just to follow up.<eos> What are some of the finer points?<eos> Or the broad strokes, even.<eos> No one from the White House has said anything.<eos> When we have a plan to present, we will present it.<eos> Jess?<eos> Is America Works a reaction to the president's low approval ratings?<eos> An effort to offer some sign of progress ramping up to the elections?<eos> We've been working on this plan since day one.<eos> It has nothing to do with the approval ratings.
What are you guys doing?<eos> Santa pub crawl, bro!<eos> Guys, Santa Claus is a very meaningful thing to a lot of people.<eos> A lot of children!<eos> Here's the thing, man. For those kids, they're living a fucking lie!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Spoiler alert:<eos> Santa's not real, you pricky infant.<eos> This is a costume!<eos> But when you put on that costume and you portray Santa Claus... you're taking a solemn oath to represent certain values... that it represents!
- Hear! Hear! We did not because he was too valuable to us.<eos> We put him above the law.<eos> I promise you that that will never happen again.<eos> If an officer steals from a convict, the officer will hang.<eos> If a soldier, the soldier will hang.<eos> If a convict, the convict will hang.<eos> Henceforth, everybody here is equal before the law.<eos> You heard that lots of times in England and you never believed it once and I do not blame you for it.<eos> In England, the law was soiled, tarnished, corrupted.<eos> Here in New South Wales, it is bright and shiny.
Yes!<eos> No, Boss.<eos> It might help your case.<eos> You put me anywhere near that soldier again and I will attack him again.<eos> Who else was gambling?<eos> Two soldiers and another convict.<eos> Their names, please.<eos> 'Governor, I have nothing but respect for you 'and the office that you hold but it is my duty to remind 'you of the words that you used when you addressed us all - 'officers, soldiers and convicts - only days ago.<eos> '"In England," you said, "the law is soiled, tarnished, corrupted.<eos> '"Here, in New South Wales, it is bright and shiny.'
Then why feed them at all?<eos> You are suggesting we stop feeding the sick?<eos> The dying.<eos> We stop wasting food on the dying.<eos> ~ Reverend?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> What do you say to that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Can we, as Christians, stop feeding the dying?<eos> I will treat that question with the contempt it deserves.
I mean, without their love and support, what else is there?<eos> Yeah, family's... I mean, that's...<eos> Yeah. That's, yeah, delightful.<eos> Um, I'm gonna go get ready, and I will see you out there.<eos> All right. See you later, alligator.<eos> I'm gonna lose the bet.<eos> I'm gonna lose the bet.<eos> Jay. I need a bunny.<eos> No, not a Playboy bunny, a rabbit with red eyes and floppy ears.<eos> Just make sure it's freakin' adorable.
- When I get used... - Mm-hmm.<eos> I like to get paid a lot.<eos> This deal's not cutting it for me.<eos> Another year on a reality TV show, dancing for the organ grinder?<eos> No way. Besides, you know as well as I do I did this so I could get away from my family.<eos> I do this insipid "Royal Love", I'm back where I started, only with more for them to ridicule me with.<eos> Listen, I'm just telling you to think about it.<eos> The marriage wouldn't be real.<eos> You could have it annulled.<eos> It would be real.
I didn't realize it then. I didn't realize it at all, but he had a distinct smell.<eos> Like cologne?<eos> More like a perfume or an oil.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I knew it could be a woman.<eos> Women can be serial killers too.<eos> Connor, I'd say serial killers are a breed upon themselves.<eos> Yeah, and they're called cray-cray.<eos> Oliver, can you describe the smell?<eos> Uh, it could be soap.
What do we got?<eos> Amy had a phone on her.<eos> Geo location services were turned off, GoPro camera around her wrist.<eos> Where did that camera come from?<eos> All the footage from last night came from smartphones.<eos> I think I know where it's from.<eos> It's the driver's.<eos> Yeah, well, unfortunately, he didn't fork out the 50 bucks for the waterproof case.<eos> It's full of sea water.<eos> The data is still intact when it gets wet.
I had no idea how bad this was.<eos> It doesn't look so bad.<eos> It's purple and blue!<eos> Do you not see how bad this is?<eos> You might've broken a rib.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What?<eos> Your hands are cold.<eos> Okay, I'm gonna go get some ice.<eos> It'll take down the swelling.
I know this is hard but it's gonna be over soon.<eos> Hey, over there.<eos> Someone's already been here.<eos> What's going on, Jake?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But we've come this far.<eos> We should dig.<eos> Can't do it alone.<eos> I can't find Tessa's phone anywhere.<eos> It's not on her body.
Aww, princess!<eos> Pasha.<eos> Mona, my dear, sweet Mona.<eos> Aww. Come in!<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving, Paul.<eos> - Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> - Ross.<eos> Happy Thanksgiving.<eos> Sweetheart, eat your cranberry sauce.<eos> It looks like blood.
And I'm asking you to stop this right now before we've all gone too far to turn back.<eos> What do you see, lad?<eos> Leeward tower just lost another 10 foot of her wall.<eos> The dust is still clearing.<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> It's quite good.<eos> But here's the thing... the crew's banner is a sacred thing.<eos> It must simultaneously strike fear in the hearts of hardened men while inspiring and unifying all those who sail under it.
First day as captain, is it?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Little things.<eos> A few looks from your men.<eos> They're curious how you'll handle this.<eos> Your banner.<eos> Something in the way your men reacted to...<eos> The banner?<eos> What's the matter with the banner?<eos> Well, it's new.
They're curious how you'll handle this.<eos> Your banner.<eos> Something in the way your men reacted to...<eos> The banner?<eos> What's the matter with the banner?<eos> Well, it's new.<eos> Lightly traveled.<eos> Why?<eos> What do you think is wrong with it?<eos> It's fine.
Which is why they're ignoring the poverty angle and focusing on your first marriage.<eos> You need to leave.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Slayton.<eos> I think I got what I need.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> What's that?<eos> A photo we can run the story with.<eos> You must be excited for Gus' flight.<eos> Can't wait.<eos> Truthfully, I can't wait for it to be over.
- No, I didn't.<eos> They were walking up ahead, more than they needed to perhaps, or... maybe I just let them, I don't know.<eos> We were on a track round this rock, and the glacier was on the right, below us.<eos> Way down.<eos> Beautiful thing, it was.<eos> You'd love the landscape out there, Kate.<eos> - You really would.<eos> - Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> They were out of sight, round the corner, and the last sound but one that I heard was her laughter.<eos> And, Christ, did it annoy me.
I made breakfast. No.<eos> Do we have any bacon?<eos> I need it for my project.<eos> No, just French toast. Would that work?<eos> Uh, I'm not hungry.<eos> Are you experiencing a loss of appetite?<eos> - No. I'm... Christ.<eos> What happened to that socket wrench?<eos> Frank, what...? - What is this secret project of yours?<eos> - Well, it wouldn't be a secret if I told you. I like French toast.
She's good.<eos> - Hello, Reg.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Reg, you all right?<eos> Mr Kray.<eos> - Everyone here knows you.<eos> - Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.<eos> - You mean it's your local?<eos> - No, I own the place.<eos> It's mine.
- Hello, Reg.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Reg, you all right?<eos> Mr Kray.<eos> - Everyone here knows you.<eos> - Yeah, well, I own it, it's my club.<eos> - You mean it's your local?<eos> - No, I own the place.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I've been by here 10 times, I never knew it was yours.
I'm just popping out for some milk.<eos> We've got plenty of milk.<eos> The tombola over here.<eos> Pin the tail on the donkey over here.<eos> No fair would be complete without it.<eos> Thank you, ladies, for the cakes. Marvellous.<eos> Problem with Forsyth's bunting.<eos> Can I go first?<eos> The harvest fair isn't for ages.<eos> It's tomorrow!
There's three beeps every 15 seconds.<eos> That's funny.<eos> What's funny?<eos> You did take it for that service?<eos> Yes, of course I did.<eos> And they did check the brakes?<eos> They said they did.<eos> Well, something isn't working.<eos> Well, put the handbrake on.<eos> It is on!
"Cockroach" to my friends.<eos> All right, yesterday we were talking, and I think this business can make us a lot of money.<eos> Explain.<eos> Well... I get the paste in Peru.<eos> I will handle the chemical part of production, and all the other details in producing this exquisite white powder.<eos> What I need from you is to help me get it into Colombia.<eos> - Now tell him how much it costs.<eos> In Chile, this little thing costs ten bucks a gram.<eos> - They sell it by grams?<eos> - Yes, it's very good.

Weaklings, frauds, liars.<eos> Ned Low, whatever he is, he's none of those things.<eos> The men saw him as an answer.<eos> But now I fear they cannot see that by supporting him, they may be sowing the seeds of their own destruction.<eos> Mr. Meeks, your men can't possibly be that stupid.<eos> Are they unaware of the profits he cost them with the Good Fortune prize?<eos> Or the future profits he's costing them with me?<eos> Ma'am, I'm uncertain of my footing on this subject.<eos> Suffice it to say, the Good Fortune yielded up a unique item of great value.<eos> The men know where their next distribution is coming from and it isn't you. Item?
I was hoping that we'd meet your husband before we left tomorrow.<eos> Is that going to be a possibility?<eos> Oh, no, I'm sorry.<eos> Eric's quite indisposed.<eos> Not too serious, I hope.<eos> Oh, no. He stood in a bear trap.<eos> What?<eos> The pulse.<eos> Yes?<eos> It's right here.
Is it a Father's Day present for Daddy?<eos> No.<eos> No, this is Mommy's catalog.<eos> Assuming they got the color right this time.<eos> Oh, let's hope.<eos> I think they did.<eos> It's a little bit magenta, but it's almost perfect.<eos> - What's magenta?<eos> - This color.<eos> Honey, it's perfect.
I'll, uh, go get them.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yay.<eos> This is literally saving our lives.<eos> Yeah, we could get sick and die.<eos> You have your phone?<eos> Uh yeah, why?<eos> I can try and fix it.<eos> Really? Oh.<eos> My kid dropped mine in the tub, and you won't believe this, but if you put it in rice it kinda dries it out.
I got rid of all the stink bombs before you babysat Leslie's kids.<eos> Being responsible adults sucks butts.<eos> Butts, that's it.<eos> I'll streak across the stage.<eos> Yes, I love it.<eos> I'm gonna get naked.<eos> I'm gonna get up there.<eos> Everyone is gonna see my weiner.<eos> I mean, you've seen it.<eos> You know how dumb it looks.
Come on.<eos> The dogs'll look out for you.<eos> They're fierce dogs, huskies. But only when it comes to bears.<eos> A husky will never, ever attack a man.<eos> Oh, it's a wood burner.<eos> You'll be fine here.<eos> Can't I come with you?<eos> No, they'll be looking for a man and a little girl.<eos> I'm scared, dad.<eos> Make us some dinner. It'll warm me up when I get back.
How much for a ticket back to Miami?<eos> Forty-seven fifty.<eos> That too much?<eos> - Why, can I get one cheaper?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Hey, Danny, it's me.<eos> I'm at the Islamorada bus stop, and you're not.<eos> Give me a call when you get this, would you, please?<eos> It'll be here in two hours.
Head down.<eos> Wha...<eos> And what about Yussef Khalid?<eos> How does he fit in?<eos> - Huh? - Sh... She was at the market.<eos> And I don't think it was a coincidence.<eos> I think she was meant to give him something.<eos> A st... A stone.<eos> I think that's what he was looking for in her apartment, and he took it off me and ran.<eos> Wait, this stone, what did it look like?
Make it instinctive.<eos> Come on, Lukas.<eos> Jog toward me. Good, Lukas.<eos> Great, Lukas!<eos> Skeid's new striker.<eos> Beautiful goal, Lukas.<eos> How did you manage to hit it?<eos> - I just hit it.<eos> - Nice try.<eos> Wait until it almost hits the ground.
- Okay, good evening.<eos> - You too.<eos> - Bye Pierre!<eos> - Bye.<eos> What do I cook for diner?<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> When was the last time we left Paris?<eos> A long time ago.<eos> Lisa is lending us her parents' house in Brittany.<eos> It will be unoccupied in July.
But... did Martin's work fulfil a personal need or... compensate for anything?<eos> When he was passed over for Head of Sport he practically doubled his charity work.<eos> He gave ten years to that school and what did they do?<eos> Parachute in some wimp with a sports degree.<eos> All the kids thought Dad should've got the job.<eos> Were the other teachers jealous of your dad's popularity?<eos> Definitely, but not enough to want to kill him.<eos> Right, OK, well, thanks for talking to us.<eos> Excuse me, where's the toilet?<eos> It's, back down there I'm afraid.
- We have to.<eos> It's all hands on deck until school's out.<eos> You can't possibly begin to cover every school in London...<eos> No, best we can do is a shortlist based on a geographic profile.<eos> OK, we know someone who can help there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for letting me come round, Mrs. Cross.<eos> Why do you need to get in there?<eos> Martin synched his phone to a laptop, but it's not in his office at school - and it wasn't in his bag. - Right.<eos> I thought it might be in here.
Which is, that God knew.<eos> Does God know how I will tell this one about his sister?<eos> How I will say what she looked like?<eos> Who she might have been?<eos> I didn't even see her.<eos> Did you see her, Terence?<eos> I saw her foot.<eos> It looked so cold.<eos> The Church doesn't have a single ritual for this.<eos> A stillborn baby can't have a religious funeral, it can't have a grave of its own.
And you're happy for them to return to this infernal place?<eos> ~ I can't do any more.<eos> ~ This hostel belongs in the past!<eos> Resources are limited and we must manage as best we can.<eos> And the people who cannot manage?<eos> You've pie on your collar.<eos> Seeing as we're quarantined together, how about you test me on my Spanish?<eos> I'm rather enjoying my magazine.<eos> We've two days of this.<eos> It'll still be there later.
I walked in from those bike sheds like John Wayne.<eos> I was beginning to think you'd forgotten!<eos> We said we'd go to the Hand and Shears to have a little brightener.<eos> Out of your uniform, spit-spot.<eos> If you're good, I'll treat you to a bitter lemon.<eos> ~ Sergeant Noakes?<eos> ~ Oh, evening, Sister.<eos> I was testing out what they say about a watched pot.<eos> ~ Oh, what's that then?<eos> ~ That it never boils.
We'll discuss the finer points in due course.<eos> I did a bit of mechanics back in borstal.<eos> My probation officer reckons it'll stand me in good stead.<eos> Has he encouraged you to mention it at your interview?<eos> He's encouraged me to tell the truth.<eos> Prove I'm determined to be honest.<eos> Is that what this is all about?<eos> People think I'm a wrong 'un, Nurse Crane.<eos> But that's my family, not me.<eos> I don't want my baby got rid of, and I don't want it born a you-know-what either.
How long can he survive decompression?<eos> Less than a minute.<eos> Line up.<eos> Walk west.<eos> He may be prone, we don't want to step over him.<eos> Commander, we're at 10.5 degrees, tilting to 11.<eos> With all the gusts of wind.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Everyone, home in on Martinez's suit.<eos> It'll get you to the airlock.
# Seasons don't fear the reaper<eos> # Nor do the wind, sun, or the rain # we can be like they are<eos> # Come on, baby Don't fear the reaper<eos> # Baby, take my hand Don't fear the reaper<eos> # We'll be able to fly Don't fear the reaper<eos> # Baby, I'm your man<eos> # La, la, la, la, la... #<eos> You got everything?<eos> Can I have my sign?<eos> - It's mine.
God damn, she's beautiful.<eos> Oh, little lady, you're wide awake, aren't you?<eos> Want mister turtle?<eos> I'll tell you a secret.<eos> Your daddy is pretty tough, but he is no match for the graveyard shift.<eos> Oh, Raylan, what in the world is worth missing this for?<eos> Bourbon.<eos> Tequila.<eos> Hey, yanqui.<eos> If you're looking for the whorehouse, it's just around the corner, just past the Starbucks.
Hey, what are you doing for lunch?<eos> Possibly being eaten by diana. Why?<eos> I'm supposed to meet lauren,<eos> And i could really use your help keeping her entertained While i read this thing.<eos> Sure.<eos> Yes. You're the best.<eos> Back in an hour.<eos> And think about oates!<eos> Hector and dorf made the most insane video For their new underwear line.<eos> First you think you're looking at a giant furry penis, And then it suddenly stands up And you realize it is actually a golden retriever puppy.
They've lived here for 12 years, But then dave had left liza for debbie, A blackjack dealer he was shtupping in atlantic city.<eos> The good news is he left liza the house.<eos> The bad news is, of course, that he took out four mortgages That she never knew about to support his gambling habit.<eos> I've said too much. You don't need the details.<eos> I love a flat screen above a fireplace.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sounds like the home of a woman who lives with her cats And is gonna die alone.<eos> Not in this house, she won't.<eos> She can't afford to.<eos> Now, either someone buys this place by next week, Or it goes to the bank.
So I took a look in the truck.<eos> I can give you $2,500 for all of it.<eos> $2,500?<eos> Uh, maybe you didn't see it all. Here.<eos> No, show him.<eos> I have photos here from when the house was staged.<eos> Everything is in great condition.<eos> We only had one girl, so we were actually able to have nice things, unlike the boy families.<eos> See this chair? It's a Stickley.<eos> And the dinette, this was my mom's, and it's genuine cherry.
Look at her.<eos> - Hi, honey.<eos> - You need a better coat.<eos> - Get up here!<eos> - Come on. It's so great to finally meet you.<eos> This is where we live.<eos> I design jewelry. Todd has a small hedge fund.<eos> Small?<eos> It's not that small.<eos> It is not small, and I can attest to that.
Please go.<eos> Walk across.<eos> I can wait.<eos> It is something.<eos> I am not sure yet.<eos> Hang on!<eos> We got him!<eos> I sent you a gift, Jim.<eos> It is a... It is a painting.<eos> I hope it has some meaning to you.
What is this?<eos> SELINA: (SIGHS) Catherine, you are smoking?<eos> I'm vaping.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> This has been happening every week.<eos> My private life should be off-limits.<eos> I see that you are still seeing Jason.<eos> He photographs well for his age.<eos> Ma'am, the Apple Growers Association would like to name a new brand of apple after you.<eos> Is it a good apple?
- And I love fireworks.<eos> The noise, the lights.<eos> Mostly those aspects.<eos> All right, look, I'm gonna text you about this later.<eos> Right now, I've gotta go.<eos> This goat's not gonna scape itself.<eos> I feel persecuted.<eos> I'm just waiting for the press to throw me in a pond to see if I'll float.<eos> Honeymoon's over, isn't it?<eos> It was kind of a shitty honeymoon, too.
- Okay.<eos> - And anyway, it's not Lee, it's Catherine. - What?<eos> She wants to work with an anti-bullying charity.<eos> What, is she nuts?<eos> I mean, it's gonna make it look like she thinks her mom bullied her.<eos> Well, I think she's calculating that this will make her more likable.<eos> Not with me, it fucking won't.<eos> Ma'am, cheese is on its way.<eos> Here's an interim banana.<eos> It doesn't even work.
- Uh-huh.<eos> - We almost...<eos> - Kissed?<eos> - Fucked.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Ma'am, Ben's on the phone. - Oh.<eos> We got a storm brewing, ma'am.<eos> Is it Israel or is it China?<eos> Ben: No, it's an actual hurricane.<eos> And it's about to take North Carolina from behind.
- Is it here?<eos> Sweet Jesus.<eos> - No, it can't be. lt can't be.<eos> - Oh, sweet Jesus.<eos> - Stop saying Jesus.<eos> Stop it!<eos> LEON: This is how I see it.<eos> I say the US is planning a secret trip.<eos> The Iranians ask you to confirm the secret trip.<eos> You say there's no secret trip because it's a secret.
- Get out.<eos> - No, come in.<eos> You get out.<eos> Mike, why exactly are you calling me?<eos> - What do we do, Sue?<eos> - There's a back-up plane.<eos> Find the back-up plane. MIKE:<eos> Come on!<eos> GARY: Oh, my God.<eos> Where is it?
- Yeah, you know, family disputes, school exclusions, that sort of thing.<eos> Look at us, we're working it from both ends.<eos> How so?<eos> Um, well, because I'm about to pass this legislation.<eos> - Families First?<eos> - Families First, yeah.<eos> I'm very proud of it.<eos> What do you guys think of it?<eos> Well, it's not everything you want it to be, obviously, because they put all those amendments on it.<eos> I think it's in pretty good shape. Yeah.

It's a big food corporation.<eos> United Seasonings.<eos> They supply 90% of the country's paprika.<eos> Yep, we lobbied for them, so my hands are dirty with paprika money.<eos> ( chuckles ) I'll mention how good you are to them.<eos> No need, they already know. - That's right.<eos> - Man on radio:<eos> This election is too close to call.<eos> ¶ Too close to call ¶ ¶ Too close to call ¶<eos> ¶ It's too close, baby, yeah, too close... ¶
Bill: With respect to Lee Patterson, she had no real idea, no concept of what was actually happening.<eos> I mean, she was so junior, she may have well been working in the kitchens, with all due respect to the kitchens.<eos> But for the record, Ms. Patterson was a very competent staffer and what Jimmy Cagney would have called a good kid in my opinion.<eos> I'll wait for a question.<eos> We have a deposition from a witness confirming that you, Mr. Ericsson, ordered Dan Egan to fire Ms. Patterson.<eos> This is what I was afraid of.<eos> I'm being snowballed.<eos> - I'm a victim of snowballing.<eos> - What do you mean, Mr. Ericsson?<eos> Well, a name gets mentioned, then gets mentioned again, and pretty soon everyone is mentioning it and then the whole thing snowballs and then there's an avalanche of snowballs and I'm being buried by other people's snow and it's not pure driven, it's not white snow, if you catch my drift.
I wanna see where you grew up.<eos> Okay, so now I'm getting an image of you on a BMX riding around the block.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I never had a bike.<eos> I did have a badass skateboard though.<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> That is so cool, and so the opposite of me.<eos> I was so not cool.<eos> I spent an entire year riding around on my sister's old bike.<eos> Was it pink?
I spent an entire year riding around on my sister's old bike.<eos> Was it pink?<eos> No, it was not pink.<eos> But it was plastered with "my little pony" stickers and glitter...<eos> So much glitter.<eos> It was really bad.<eos> I kind of got used to it, actually, but then my dad took it away and gave me a boys' bike instead.<eos> Oh man.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It was so boring and brown.
Hey!<eos> Hey. Missed you last night.<eos> Yeah, I wasn't sure if, uh... You know, I didn't think I should come over.<eos> Well, you're here now.<eos> You wanna join us for a soak?<eos> Plenty of room.<eos> You sure you don't mind?<eos> Wouldn't have asked you if I did.<eos> Okay.<eos> Lynn saw me in a production of "Beach Blanket Babylon" back in the day, back when it was at the Tivoli.
I've only got so much to give.<eos> Because it all went to Brian.<eos> No. Not all, but he needed a lot.<eos> So, yes, now I have my limits.<eos> You're not Matthew.<eos> But...<eos> What I had with Brian, I won't have with anyone else, even if I wanted to.<eos> Too much life.<eos> But you could... If you wanted to.<eos> Your place at Russian River is incredible, but it's also, like...
- He-Man! - Wow.<eos> What fabulous secret powers are you going to reveal tonight when you hold aloft your magic sword?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> And you are?<eos> - I'm Gordon Freeman. - Okay.<eos> Ta-da! He's one of the most popular video game characters of all time.<eos> - He revolutionized...<eos> - You don't want to hear the explanation.<eos> Where do you guys want this?<eos> It weighs like a million fucking pounds.
How's your stress level been?<eos> Uh, it's gotten worse. Um...<eos> I have to get a working beta of my platform ready in time for January.<eos> I just took money from a guy who is a nightmare.<eos> I hired six new people.<eos> We're going to have to spend a ton of money on new offices.<eos> It's like every second there is a new issue that I have to solve.<eos> I am stressed as hell.<eos> Richard, currently, your stress level is here. And that's night sweats level. Got it?<eos> Now, if you're not careful and you let it go up...
Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie, Ramon.<eos> I'd like to get everyone's first impressions.<eos> Who'd like to jump in?<eos> Anyone?<eos> How about you, Ramon?<eos> It's just stupid.<eos> Okay, so Ramon feels the phone is stupid.<eos> Could you elaborate, Ramon? Stupid how'?<eos> Please be as specific as possible, Ramon.<eos> Well, it's slow.

I tried to watch a movie, and it kept freezing up.<eos> And when I'm typing, like, there's a delay. Then all the letters pop up at once.<eos> You took a good phone and you made it all, like, shitty.<eos> Keep in mind' I didn't design the phone.<eos> -It pissed me off.<eos> - I appreciate your honesty, Ramon.<eos> That's just one guy's opinion.<eos> Who else feels this product is stupid?<eos> Allen, Lisa, Josh, Yana, Katie.<eos> And did it piss off anyone else?
Bro him back!<eos> Bro him back.<eos> Bro him.<eos> We're not dead yet, guys.<eos> Well, get some sleep, my bros.<eos> I'll set the meeting, and, um, then I'll go find some hoes to prioritize behind you.<eos> Are you trying to say "Bros before hoes"?<eos> It's sexist, but it's about friendship.<eos> Middle-out is based on a completely new probabilistic model.<eos> It finds long-range structure that's hidden even to domain-optimized algorithms.
It does not just scratch the surface of the earth, but it digs deeper, and because of the angle of the blade, it turns the soil over.<eos> Now, we've made some experiments, and when manure is also dug into the ripped and open earth, the crop, and the harvest, increase.<eos> - You will leave us this plow?<eos> - Yes.<eos> See how you get on.<eos> I like to experiment between our cultures.<eos> Plowing, fertilizing, and... sowing seed are the very basis of life.<eos> Indeed they are.<eos> Well, give this plow to your settlers.<eos> Let them see if it works.
But the moment that I laid hands on her,<eos> I realized... she was strong.<eos> And she caught me in a lock and threw me off balance.<eos> I clung to her desperately, but after a struggle, I was forced to one knee...<eos> And so I lost.<eos> Then... what happened to you?<eos> I told the King that he had put me to shame.<eos> He confessed to using spells to trick me.<eos> He said he could scarcely believe his eyes when I drank from the horn... because the other end was in the sea.<eos> He said that when I got back to the ocean, that I would see how much it had ebbed with my efforts.
In a land called Frankia.<eos> I visited there with the emperor Charlemagne.<eos> I've once visited Paris myself.<eos> It is set upon an island in the middle of a great river called the Seine.<eos> It has high walls and ramparts all around it, for many miles.<eos> I remember when I saw it for the first time.<eos> It was like a dream, as if it were not real.<eos> A vision.<eos> How far is this city?<eos> It lies on the other side of a narrow stretch of water.
Well what do you say now?<eos> Now?<eos> I would say this city is impregnable.<eos> It won't be long now.<eos> - Go away, Bjorn!<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want this child.<eos> I don't want this child! I don't want this child!<eos> I do.<eos> It will be weak, deformed.

My father says that happiness doesn't matter.<eos> But you are not your father, Bjorn Ironside.<eos> Or have you not realized that yet?<eos> Good night, husband.<eos> Watch it.<eos> Rollo.<eos> I have nothing to say to you, priest.<eos> Except this...<eos> Where is your arm ring?<eos> Where is it?
So... what do you suppose happens next?<eos> Pirate vessel!<eos> Pirate vessel!<eos> What follows is a message from the Lord Governor of the Carolina Colony.<eos> "I trusted the good faith of your arrival and I accepted Captain Flint as my guest in the same spirit.<eos> But I now regret to inform you that he has violated that trust in a most deceitful manner."<eos> - What?<eos> - "Therefore I've placed him under arrest.<eos> This trial and its resulting sentence will be swift, just, and final.<eos> And it will reestablish beyond any shadow of a doubt that the rule of law lives in Carolina, that the men and women of this place will not shrink from you, from any of you, from any like you, and that the death of piracy in the New World has never been nearer than today.
- Come on, you know.<eos> That little swastika tattoo?<eos> That's a flower.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, it was pretty dark, and I hadn't had my LASIK yet.<eos> Yeah, not a swastika.<eos> That's a relief. (Chuckles)<eos> I got to say, it made me a little uncomfortable.<eos> This whole conversation is making me uncomfortable.<eos> Funny, 'cause it's making me a little hot.
Hey. There's our star.<eos> Ah. What's with the vest?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The vest.<eos> I never approved that.<eos> I didn't approve of what you approved.<eos> Seriously, lose the vest.<eos> I like the vest.<eos> I'm telling you, the vest is not your friend.<eos> It's classy.

Let the cares of the day fade away.<eos> I lost some money.<eos> Jackass kid I picked up on the highway, knocked me out cold, took the money.<eos> What do you know about him?<eos> Not much.<eos> His car broke down.<eos> His car was on the highway?<eos> Apparently.<eos> Did you go find it?<eos> It was broke down.
You told them?<eos> About Amy?<eos> Of course.<eos> They deserve to know.<eos> We're all in this together.<eos> Ben, have you thought any more about our conversation yesterday?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Everyone wants to hear from you, Ben.<eos> They need to.<eos> This town, it's coming apart.
Well, I'm gonna need everybody there.<eos> Everybody.<eos> He created this prison you live in.<eos> He watches everything you do.<eos> He tells you what job you can hold, who you can marry, and when someone has to die.<eos> He uses fear and violence to control you because he's afraid that if you know the truth that you'll self-destruct, you'll turn on each other.<eos> But can't you see?<eos> That's what's already happening.<eos> The world we knew is gone.<eos> It no longer exists.
What do you think?<eos> Want to take one home?<eos> Hey, don't joke.<eos> When I was your age, I rescued a wolf pup.<eos> It was, like, two months old.<eos> It could barely walk.<eos> It used to sleep by my bed.<eos> Watch over me.<eos> My wife, she came at me with a steak knife.<eos> It took a chunk out of her arm.
Okay.<eos> I intend to personally look into your project to determine its viability within the moral principles of this company.<eos> Okay, boss.<eos> What's your next move?<eos> Sir, I can't get a hold of your instructor.<eos> Never mind.<eos> He's likely caught up in the evacuation.<eos> You're sure there's nobody else who can fly a helicopter?<eos> We don't need anyone else.<eos> You think it's out there?
You're not stealing a truck.<eos> Oh.<eos> Unlocked.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> Unlocked doesn't mean turned on.<eos> And we can hardly call it stealing.<eos> Boy, is that lucky.<eos> So, uh, what?<eos> I-is the cap stuck?<eos> No, it's not just stuck.

Really?<eos> Really.<eos> You know, as a trustee of this collection, I have a sacred duty.<eos> I have to document all of these before I can expose anymore.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We need someone who can pick a lock.<eos> Feel for the pins.<eos> These are standard five-pin locks.<eos> Kitchen locks will be the same.<eos> Now, push each pin up until it locks into place.
I gotta show this to Ray.<eos> He's gonna lose his shit.<eos> -What did you find?<eos> -Ray, I found a shoe, buddy!<eos> - A what? -<eos> -Ray! Ray!<eos> Ray, I found a shoe.<eos> Hey, man, that's awesome.<eos> Dude, I found a shoe.<eos> It was right by the gun, so...
John!<eos> Mr Segundus!<eos> Mr Segundus!<eos> ~ I said, what in hell do you think you're doing here?<eos> ~ Jonathan!<eos> ~ You, you with the twice-turned sleeves.<eos> ~ Jonathan!<eos> Sir, I would beg you to speak to this gentleman with more respect.<eos> We're here to view this house.<eos> It is for sale.
~ Oh, sir.<eos> Your books.<eos> I'm sorry for it, sir.<eos> Here is one... that's left.<eos> Stand your ground!<eos> Captain, let's fill this flank!<eos> Hold your places!<eos> HE MOUTHS<eos> Mr Strange.<eos> Mr Strange, this mist - is it yours?
Kant said human reason is troubled by questions that it cannot dismiss, but also cannot answer.
It's a small house, but it's really comfortable.<eos> Right over here is the living room, and there's a little kitchen that way.<eos> And there's a little dining room right next to that.<eos> Upstairs...<eos> This way.<eos> Bathroom to the right.<eos> And this is the bedroom.<eos> It's small, but really comfortable.<eos> And there's an office over there.<eos> I think you'll really love the philosophy department, you know? It's in this old, beautiful part of the campus.
I mean, have you ever known Abe to get up at 6:30?<eos> He barely makes it to class on time.<eos> Okay, then your theory is that he gets up at 6:30, and he goes to Lippitt Park, and he goes up to a total stranger, and he drops poison in the juice of a total stranger.<eos> I mean, he didn't even know the judge.<eos> He couldn't get that close, and then, if he knew the judge, he wouldn't...<eos> I mean, he just wouldn't do it.<eos> He's radical, but he's not nuts.<eos> Let me give you the final tidbit.<eos> A few weeks ago, I lost my lab key.<eos> Now I never lose anything, but that key was missing from my bag, and it opens all the doors to all the lab rooms that have all those dangerous chemicals and poisons.
How come we weren't warned?<eos> David did this.<eos> You've said this town is an ark.<eos> One crack, and we all drown.<eos> He is drowning us.<eos> Where do they go?<eos> Megan?<eos> We have no time.<eos> There's a western tunnel.<eos> It leads to an elevator.

It's beautiful.<eos> So sweet.<eos> So innocent.<eos> So-- Trav, look out!<eos> [ Thuds ]<eos> Why do you keep doing that?<eos> Once you and Laurie have a kid, you have to be ready for anything.<eos> Now, if this were a real baby, it would be dead.
Well, I mean, he ain't upstairs, and he ain't down here.<eos> I thought he might try to run, but the truck's still here.<eos> It's him.<eos> It's the bad man, I just know it.<eos> - He's got him, just like before.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> What's the play, Baird?<eos> Give me a second.<eos> 'Cause I'm thinking fire, huh?<eos> We burn the joint down, I bet it don't move around much.
My family never knew how special it was.<eos> Not one of them heard this house whispering.<eos> But I did.<eos> "Do you need help, Katie?"<eos> "Why, yes... Magic house, I surely do."<eos> Wishes?<eos> Hey!<eos> You listening up there?<eos> This is a magic house.<eos> And it's mine.

Whoever it is backwoods country people think is hot, I don't know.<eos> This place is a gravy train.<eos> Colonel Baird.<eos> Eve, if I may, I've never asked for anything in my life.<eos> Please, let me have this.<eos> It grants wishes, Eve.<eos> Know what I wish right now?<eos> I wish I had something for this eye!<eos> The house doesn't grant wishes.<eos> It helps people in need.
To celebrate, we will release the damn tree.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Guys, we do this properly.<eos> Sends!<eos> Go!<eos> The clip!<eos> Is removed.<eos> Chief, what do we do?<eos> It gives off branches from the road and we go home.
You send text messages?<eos> You're not paid for it.<eos> Have you checked the post?<eos> Yes.<eos> Its good.<eos> Restart.<eos> That's it.<eos> Warning!<eos> I had the eye, he nothing.<eos> Look, it broke at the base.
I have for a second.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> I heard about the incident yesterday.<eos> It's annoying.<eos> It has lost almost 3 hours.<eos> This kind of thing can seriously<eos> Make us late.<eos> Our employer is aware.<eos> And that's boring.<eos> It should be more careful.
Go, Bailey.<eos> I have the ball.<eos> I see where it's bleeding.<eos> Balance, go!<eos> Disconnects relays to remain closed.<eos> - There?<eos> - Yes, that one.<eos> This is good!<eos> Watch out!<eos> - It loses.
Why not?<eos> Alan, what the hell happened to you?<eos> You disappeared, you quit the CDC, there's rumours about bombings in Paris...<eos> I can't explain it right now.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> I had no idea what happened to you and then I finally find you and you won't even tell me anything!<eos> Sarah, I can't!<eos> It's too dangerous, for you and for the team!<eos> You have to trust me.<eos> This island is not what it seems.
I'll be back, say, in a year.<eos> Or two.<eos> No, no.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> I know the people who made her immortal.<eos> If you let me out, I can get the information.<eos> If you give me something I can use,<eos> I will contemplate your release.<eos> I don't know what made Sarah immortal, but I know about her baby!<eos> It's immortal too.
Sarah, don't shut me out, talk to me.<eos> Please!<eos> Open the door.<eos> Sarah!<eos> Get out of my way, I need to get to the lab.<eos> - You're not seriously going back to work!<eos> - What would you like me to do, - curl up in my bed and cry?<eos> - We have to get you off this island.<eos> I'm not going anywhere until I find my baby.<eos> It's still alive, Alan.

This wasn't supposed to happen.<eos> I wanted all of you as far away from this as possible.<eos> All I wanted was to was to stop Ilaria to beat them at their own game.<eos> I never meant to be involved with the CDC.<eos> I know you didn't, but now, you are involved.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, Sarah.<eos> Alan, this is why you're here.<eos> You want to stop Ilaria, you stop this pathogen, you find a cure.<eos> If this isn't part of Ilaria's grand plan, it will be as soon as they find out how deadly it is.
I'm looking for something special, something that was rumored to be on this island decades ago.<eos> I'm looking for a child.<eos> There's a new disease that's killing our kind.<eos> We believe the only way to cure it is through immortal stem cells and we believe that child<eos> - to be the key. - I remember.<eos> Do you remember where it is?<eos> Every day, in that pit,<eos> I was plagued by knowledge of that child.<eos> Reminded of the failure of my work... with my own children, - with my own life.<eos> - Can you tell me where it is?
] - (gunshots)<eos> Manitou, this is Winger.<eos> Manitou, do you copy?<eos> Man: [We all sound the same underwater.]<eos> [We all sound the same underwater.]<eos> [We all sound the same... ]<eos> How the hell this disease is spreading so fast.<eos> - Any number of ways.<eos> - My cutter...<eos> Has it gone airborne?
You have to stop her and Dr. Summer.<eos> They're trying to leave the island.<eos> Where are they now?<eos> - No, no, no, no!<eos> - What happened?<eos> The test vials are broken.<eos> I don't have any more.<eos> Well then, there's nothing you can do.<eos> Look, do you see this?<eos> The fungal enzyme, it spilled into the ground.
The fungal enzyme, it spilled into the ground.<eos> Do you know what this means?<eos> It's Mother!<eos> She's everywhere!<eos> Alright, Soren, you'll go first, then you, Sarah.<eos> We're taking fire!<eos> Hang on!<eos> Come back!<eos> The fungus, it...<eos> It's in the soil around the roots.
- Yeah?<eos> Then prove it.<eos> What else can you tell me about McPickle?<eos> We have his photograph in some of our files.<eos> But maybe you should check with the CIA. He started his career with them.<eos> Wha-<eos> - What the fuck is this?<eos> This is me giving you homework.<eos> Former CIA pilot flying coke for the narcos.<eos> And I need you to find out who it is.
You know, Eustace is gonna be at his mom's house, and my selfish neighbor finally put a passcode on the Wi-Fi, so no Internet.<eos> Guess I'll look through these magazines I found.<eos> Got a Redbook with Rachael Ray on the cover.<eos> Yeah, but... but skiing sounds nice.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Yeah. - That's nice.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I never seen snow.<eos> - You've never seen snow?<eos> - What is it like?
- It was awesome!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> It was confusing.<eos> We went to an ice-cream store.<eos> Where pops told grandma he wished she'd get run over by a big rig.<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> That's not exactly what I said, now.<eos> Oh! Oh, I hope you get run over by a big rig!<eos> I hope it keeps going after it hits you!
So...<eos> Figure out the rest.<eos> If I'm scared...<eos> Then this place is scary.<eos> And if I wanna go home...<eos> You're flickering.<eos> Why are you flickering?<eos> You still don't understand, Andy.<eos> We think we've found another altar.<eos> It's miles away, and we don't have much time.
- Oh, drama.<eos> - What?<eos> Drama seems to follow me wherever I go, especially when I'm with the ladies...<eos> Stop talking now, please!<eos> Stop doing your lame-o video!<eos> You're not gonna make it!<eos> Can we try that again without you guys yelling?<eos> This is gonna work.<eos> I left my air conditioner here last year when I graduated.<eos> It's technically still mine.
So far, so good.<eos> I'll kill anyone who stumbles.<eos> - You'll slaughter us, or what?<eos> - Turn right here.<eos> Here, girls.<eos> Careful!<eos> There's only one cake.<eos> - We'll die if the cake falls.<eos> - Our lives depend on the cake.<eos> It's swaying! Don't drop it!
- Never felt threatened?<eos> - No.<eos> Alexander isn't a trouble maker, or someone who fights in the school yard.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yet, he suddenly raped you'?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You're sure of this?<eos> Did he put his penis inside of you?<eos> - Did he put his penis in your vagina?<eos> - So where was it'?
What is that thing?<eos> Wes.<eos> Electricity from the plane trapped inside the rocks somehow.<eos> It seems to be affecting the current from our light.<eos> - Any idea how long it's been here?<eos> - We questioned some nomads who passed through the area four months ago.<eos> Nothing was here then.<eos> Unfortunately, that's the best timeline we have.<eos> The plane...<eos> Looks like it never touched the ground here.
The mission was to gather photographic evidence of Chinese and Russian military buildup in the arctic circle.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - But get this.<eos> As soon as the pilot reached its target, he radioed in he was losing control.<eos> Two minutes later, the plane disappeared off radar.<eos> The arctic circle?<eos> You're sure?<eos> Yeah, that's what it says.<eos> That's... that's almost 4,000 miles away from the wreckage.<eos> And according to the fuel log here, the plane took off with only 300 miles worth of fuel.<eos> So no way it could have made it to that desert on its own.
Do you want some cheese?<eos> Have you brought cheese?<eos> - Yeah, you need some?<eos> - Yeah. Give me some. Okay.<eos> - Focus up, guys. Come on.<eos> - The girls are gonna be here soon, geez.<eos> - Right, right.<eos> - Why do you have a dog leash? - Oh.<eos> Good question. Yeah.<eos> It's for the first "D" in the DENNIS system.
- It's-it's the system... ah, I don't care about you.<eos> - All right, you know what?<eos> This is, this is the problem, Dee.<eos> You can't even spell, much less come up with a decent system, and now your slapdash opinions are gonna be thrown across the Internet for everyone to see.<eos> You know, these-these ratings, they follow a man around.<eos> - They're gonna ruin this man's reputation.<eos> - Well, sucks to be him.<eos> ♪ Hangin' out the Passenger side... ♪ But the thing about a rating is you don't know the quality of the person who's giving the rating, right?<eos> I mean, like, for instance, some dum-dum goes into a Morton's Steakhouse.<eos> She orders a steak well-done and then complains when the damn thing comes out and it's too dry.
- That's a good point.<eos> - All right, yeah, fine.<eos> But don't pretend like you understand the plan, 'cause that's gonna piss me off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dee, get the joke stool in the basement, all right?<eos> - Can't have it out.<eos> - What? No way.<eos> It's hilarious.<eos> It's not hilarious, it's just a stool with a nail sticking out of it.<eos> Yeah, and when it pokes their butts, they scream, 'cause they just got a nail right in the butt.
- Happy to help.<eos> You know, I've never felt this sad about a breakup before.<eos> - Is that a sign that it was a mistake?<eos> - No. No.<eos> He bailed on you because he was scared that you were gonna bail on him eventually, right?<eos> Yeah, pretty much.<eos> Well, then he was coming from a place of fear... in life.<eos> You know what?<eos> Can I actually get some of that organic sugar scrub?<eos> - It looks good.
Eric, we found Jason.<eos> We have him under arrest.<eos> Right.<eos> I still need to talk to him, so... - Okay. - Thanks, Ciaran.<eos> Listen, I know what happened to you.<eos> The thing you found has made you very, very ill.<eos> And I know that the mammoth is real.<eos> You found it, didn't you?<eos> Jason, would you look at me?<eos> Now I need you to tell me where it is.
Jason, you're the only one who can help us all now.<eos> When you tell me where the mammoth can be found, all of this will stop.<eos> Everything will be fine again.<eos> Listen, Jason.<eos> I'm going to trust you now.<eos> I'm going to unlock your handcuffs.<eos> Governor, he might be dangerous.<eos> Give me the key.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, Jason, where is it?
That's where it happened?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where should I go?<eos> I slept down here.<eos> There's a bed upstairs.<eos> Why don't you take that?<eos> This is your house now.<eos> We'll have to replenish the stores.<eos> I know the forest.<eos> It'll supply us.
Mm!<eos> Because of him... you will all be on television very soon, on The Elsa Mars Hour.<eos> But first, tonight, we feast, and later, for entertainment, we will watch a movie from my own collection.<eos> Not The Sign of the Cross again!<eos> No.<eos> We will enjoy Freaks.<eos> Do you know that picture, Richard?<eos> Uh...<eos> I can't say that I do.<eos> Oh, it's a wonderful picture.
Dad, I can't be late.<eos> Shut up.<eos> I don't want the children to see this.<eos> It was me that saw her.<eos> Isambard came and started barking and there she was, floating in the water.<eos> All tangled up in an electric cable.<eos> How unlucky can you get?<eos> I couldn't believe my eyes.<eos> When I looked in the water, there was this television set.<eos> I mean, it wasn't even an old one.

- Okay, so I just sign here?<eos> - No.<eos> No, no! Aw.<eos> Great.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Yeah, that's invalid now.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> Excuse me, Mr. Haggerty?<eos> I just wanted to say that I really like your museum.<eos> It's weird and sad and unnecessary.

Extremely well-put.<eos> Excuse me, Judge Perd?<eos> I'm Ben Wyatt, City Manager.<eos> What Gryzzl is doing with our private information may not technically be illegal, but it's definitely not chill.<eos> Whoa!<eos> That's a serious allegaysh, homie.<eos> We are hella chill.<eos> And frankly, if you don't like our vibe, you don't have to use our shizz.<eos> Well, we kind of do.<eos> I mean, the internet is no longer optional, it's a necessity for everyone.
We are very different people.<eos> Did you hear back from Elise?<eos> Oh, yeah, we're good.<eos> The I.O.W. is not gonna protest us.<eos> How's your pie?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I didn't make a pie.<eos> [laughs] Okay.<eos> How is your dessert calzone?<eos> It's ready.
You can't win 'em all.<eos> No.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> They may have taken that land, but I will be damned if they take my waffles.<eos> JJ...<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No, nothing is ever wrong here.<eos> That's why we are gonna fight hard to save your diner.<eos> Now you said your new landlord didn't give you a chance to counter.<eos> Who is it?
What if we steal the keys to Feinstein's building, break in, and TP his office?<eos> Film the whole thing.<eos> We'd definitely get on a prank show.<eos> Okay, I love your energy, Andy, but it's not gonna help us keep JJ's where it is.<eos> Does it have to stay where it is?<eos> There's like, a ton of buildings near where Andy and I live, and they're all super cheap because they're empty and disgusting.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Anything to get away from this cologne smell.<eos> Ooh, water makes it worse.

'Please return to your rooms and find your surprises.'<eos> 'I said, "No."<eos> Three chimes means we have to go to our rooms.<eos> Or else..<eos> Ali.<eos> Ali.<eos> Ali, wait up.<eos> Please, talk to us.<eos> Or else what?<eos> It steals you in the night and puts you in the hole.
Right now, I just need to be with my family.<eos> Alone.<eos> No questions.<eos> And please, no more police.<eos> This better work.<eos> Andrew's been obsessed with the girls since Ali went missing.<eos> If he really thinks that she's here alone there is no way he'll pass up the opportunity to grab her.<eos> And if you're wrong?<eos> Dad, this was my idea.<eos> If we don't poke the bear, it'll just keep hibernating.
"There was no going back.<eos> There were new rules now, new reasons for him to call.<eos> He made choices and I obeyed.<eos> I let him press his thumb so hard into my neck that blue marks appeared.<eos> I let him bend my limbs ways they didn't go, and once his arm reared back and his fist landed with a thud on my collar bone, like sex, that didn't feel like anything I thought it would.<eos> He moved me where I had to go.<eos> The goal was not to say no, and so it didn't matter if I was good in my choicelessness.<eos> I was free for a moment."<eos> Okay, what is this story about?<eos> It's about a really privileged girl deciding that she's just gonna let someone abuse her.
Who is not actually related to the baby by blood.<eos> No blood, but he's got the sweat and tears part down.<eos> He's takin' real good care of my babies, and he'll do the same for Daya.<eos> I want to adopt the child.<eos> I'm... up nights... haunted...<eos> I can't bear the thought of the baby winding up like...<eos> Go ahead, say it.<eos> Like her mother?<eos> Like George.<eos> So... you want to raise the baby so it don't turn out like the baby you raised?
Let's move on to the kitchen.<eos> Inmate Mendoza, glad you can join us.<eos> What's on the menu today?<eos> Food.<eos> It's a Cuban garbanzo bean stew-type thingy.<eos> We got a whole case of it last week, and Gloria, she figured out a way how to stretch them after we picked out all the rotten ones.<eos> We find that our inmates are one of our best assets.<eos> They are very resourceful, and we rely on them to help us get through the day.<eos> Yeah, like this one time, everyone got the shits real bad from eating old pork or whatever, so we served white bread for the next couple of days.<eos> It was real good for the tummy.
He's gone.<eos> I know.<eos> Fucking piece of shit.<eos> Like all of them.<eos> Yep.<eos> Can't believe he just left us.<eos> It's not the worst thing that'll happen to that kid.<eos> I'm glad you're back.<eos> Seeing you like that was scarier than seein' that dolphin penis at SeaWorld.<eos> Around all that water, it looked out of place, you know.
- Pear.<eos> No, peach.<eos> A bruised piece of fruit.<eos> Sound good?<eos> No. You're never supposed to start an improv with a transaction.<eos> But whatever.<eos> All right, try to keep it up for three minutes.<eos> This... fruit is defective.<eos> How so?<eos> It's all nasty and bruised up.
Where do I cut it?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Beef Wellington.<eos> - What's this stuff?<eos> - Snow peas.<eos> No.<eos> Peas are round and green.<eos> This is like a watery brown paste.<eos> - The bag said snow peas.<eos> I'm sure it tastes good.
I didn't know she was in there till, like, seven months.<eos> How could you not know?<eos> You weigh 90 pounds.<eos> You must have looked like an egg with four sticks in it.<eos> I'm not a scientist, okay?<eos> I was smoking a lot of pot that summer.<eos> I got pineapple!<eos> You eat this, things will go fast.<eos> La china found it on the bottom shelf in commissary.<eos> It's from 2006, but cans last forever, right?
No.<eos> I'm healthy.<eos> I'm healthy. Come on.<eos> Please, honey. It's okay.<eos> Just deep breaths.<eos> You're, you're healthy.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's not your baby.<eos> What?<eos> Dayanara's baby, it's not yours.
It's not your baby.<eos> What?<eos> Dayanara's baby, it's not yours.<eos> I am so, so sorry, honey.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I went to see her.<eos> I thought that...<eos> I don't know what I thought.<eos> That I could offer you a hopeful future or that I could take care of your child until you could.<eos> But it is mine?
You should have kept mine.<eos> Jeanie told me where to find you in the woods.<eos> If you didn't want to add fuel to the rumors, then you shouldn't have made it common knowledge that you were under the full moon, dancing naked and burning effigies.<eos> So you think I'm a witch?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You may not have killed Dougal's wife, but you definitely killed Arthur, and it wasn't witchcraft.<eos> It was old-fashioned poison.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> I started with white arsenic a few months ago.<eos> Thought it would kill Arthur off before the child began to show.
I lose my job? I get branded a rapist?<eos> That's not necessarily...<eos> My father is an episcopalian minister.<eos> My mother plays the church organ every Sunday.<eos> The fact that they know I've had sex at all is the most humiliating thing I've ever been through...<eos> Until I was accused of this.<eos> They'll all think I'm a rapist, and I'm not.<eos> And I know that's hard for you to believe, especially since I've lied to you, but, please, don't give up on me.<eos> We need to prove that the sex between Jolene and Chad was consensual.<eos> But it wasn't.
Or steel.<eos> So, someone finally knocked some sense into him.<eos> Just a little too hard.<eos> They also found carpet fibers in his remains...<eos> Along with some debris from a wooded area.<eos> That should give the police something to find who did this.<eos> The debris gets them to the woods, and the woods gets them to us.<eos> We can't talk about this here.<eos> Look, we dodged a bullet with the search.<eos> But that report, I-it proves they know way too much.
Mash, lash, dash, rash, crash, slash...<eos> Right.<eos> It distracts you with the test.<eos> But each level, as you advance, it tells you to focus on a goal before kicking you up to the next level.<eos> And the player has unknowingly performed basic rituals embedded in the code...<eos> Once that is completed successfully, is prompted to wish.<eos> I mean, structurally, it's... witchcraft, I mean, without all of the eye of Newt nonsense.<eos> How did a teenager create something like this?<eos> No way Amy built this.<eos> I mean, I-if you look into the code Even looking past all the glowy bits, it's way more complex than anything I've ever hacked, and I've hacked the NSA.
I knew we forgot something.<eos> We forgot it was too soon.<eos> I didn't hit a skunk.<eos> It was a black and white bucket.<eos> Then what was that smell?<eos> What the heck is this?<eos> _<eos> I can't read it.<eos> You can eat it.<eos> It's a cake.
- Nice.<eos> - This one likes it nice and hard.<eos> Okay, see what's comfortable.<eos> I'm happy to answer any questions.<eos> Can we leave our shoes on?<eos> I guess so.<eos> No, no, that's fine there.<eos> Have you got your remote?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it the same?
Well, actually, I call it full-on zombie mode.<eos> Huh. So, is raging out at all interesting to you, or...<eos> You know what, never mind.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Uh, the guy tried to mug me, and I went into full-on zombie mode and, yeah...<eos> Before I knew it, sirens were blaring and I'm still about to crack this guy's head open for just the tiniest taste of brain, which is the single most disgusting thing a person can eat.<eos> That it is.<eos> It's the consistency that kills me.<eos> I can't get around it. And there's that weird metallic taste.<eos> Is it metallic?
I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my skin.<eos> I told you not to wax down there.<eos> It's itchy when it grows back.<eos> I'm worried about the New Horizons space probe.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> Nine years ago he was part of a team that launched a spacecraft to collect data about Pluto.<eos> It's finally close enough, so this morning it turned itself on.<eos> We hope.<eos> The signal has to travel over three billion miles.<eos> So it's gonna be hours before we know if it even survived.
If it's okay with you, I'd like to go to temple.<eos> Buddy, trust me, you don't want to convert to Judaism.<eos> I mean, I know I make it look cool, but... it's not all briskets and dreidels.<eos> I meant a Hindu temple.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> It's not like Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, right?<eos> Some bald guy with horns isn't gonna rip my heart out.<eos> Dude, that movie's an imperialist fantasy that makes the followers of a beautiful and peaceful religion look like a bunch of bloodthirsty barbarians.<eos> You love that movie.<eos> Yeah, it's pretty great.
You know, I think you really just have to get to know her.<eos> She can be a - Would you stop it, Gareth?<eos> ! - All right.<eos> How's about this?<eos> You tell me where the jewelry is, we'll pack up shop.<eos> We'll stop the pillaging and the killing, yada, yada, and everyone's happy.<eos> The Jewel of Valencia is priceless. I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It is a symbol of Valencia.<eos> It has belonged not to us, but to our people for thousands of years.
Your father is right.<eos> This is why we left Chinatown in D.C.<eos> This is why we left our family and friends.<eos> Exactly.<eos> This is why we left everything we know to come to a place where we know nothing and where the humidity is not good for my hair.<eos> - Right, okay.<eos> - And for what?<eos> So your father can own a cowboy restaurant.<eos> It's called Cattleman's Ranch Steakhouse, and I can't wait for you all to see it.<eos> It is beautiful.

I should go see how my boys' day was.<eos> Okay, sugar.<eos> Bye.<eos> I'm making you a mixtape.<eos> I hope you like Eric Clapton.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey.<eos> So, how was your first...<eos> They said my lunch smelled!<eos> It smelled delicious?
- Yeah, okay, you got it.<eos> - Hey, listen.<eos> We gotta make a bit of an adjustment.<eos> Tiny and Jojo, they don't want to do the construction, so I was looking into what cults do to force people into labor when the mind tricks don't work, and one of them was a personality test, right?<eos> You basically just get a bunch of dirt on people and you hold it over their heads.<eos> So, blackmail.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So this is a basic personality test.<eos> It's really simple.<eos> It just measures the amount of guilt stressors that you're feeling.
I thought he was ready to hear it.<eos> Could you show us the room he stayed in?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> - Gloves?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> On the evening that Barge was murdered and Lizzie Craddock disappeared... There was an unusual pattern of calls. - Thanks, Clarissa.<eos> - I did the work!<eos> Was GPS enabled on their phones? No.<eos> But we can use cell site analysis.<eos> We can see the movements of the device from the cell sites it connects to.
You're about to go for the gun strapped to your ankle, but by the time you do, the fight will be over.<eos> Not cool, man.<eos> Should I call the cops?<eos> I am a cop.<eos> - Don't do this, Will.<eos> - What the fuck? !<eos> You've spent your life trying to understand what happened to you.<eos> If you don't let me go, you might never find out.<eos> - Oh, my God, I'm losing my mind.<eos> - No, it's just expanding.
I thought it would be fun, and mandatory for you to add her to your little committee.<eos> Why, because one roof collapsed?<eos> No, God, God no.<eos> I'm your friend bringing you a new friend, one with training in not collapsing roofs.<eos> Is she, excuse me, ma'am.<eos> Is she above us or below us?<eos> She is, woop!<eos> I'm getting a call, here, and I'll have to take it.<eos> Frankie, why don't you explain what your role will be, while I leave to take this call.<eos> My phone is vibrating, but it is In your office, which you didn't realize, when you started the fake phone call move.
- You've got to...<eos> - Okay, okay, I'm gonna do my best.<eos> He's my dad!<eos> Oh! Whoa!<eos> Let's go!<eos> We need more support!<eos> Shore it up! Shore it up!<eos> - You better work fast.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Block the cable so it doesn't move!
- Yeah. Come in here.<eos> I think there might have been angel dust in that weed.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> - I'm joking.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - So there's no angel dust?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> That's not funny, because... I'm serious when I think about angel dust.<eos> It freaks me out, because I think about people, like, jumping off of buildings.
It's great to have you back, and if there's anything I can do...<eos> Mr. Leclair! Mr. Leclair!<eos> - Oh, Mr. Crabb.<eos> - How splendid to see you.<eos> Oh, what a show you've put on, sir!<eos> It really is very generous of you.<eos> Family means the world to me, as I'm sure it does to you.<eos> I've just been telling this fellow about our potential business venture.<eos> The design of my plane is nearly finished.<eos> I just need to set up a production line, and then it can fly.
Oh, my God.<eos> Please!<eos> Somebody help me!<eos> Please!<eos> Get anything?<eos> No.<eos> It's the weirdest thing.<eos> There's no cars, no people, not even a salt truck.<eos> Don't suppose you got me a backup generator for Christmas, did you?<eos> Yeah, it's under the tree, next to your ties and underwear.
Are you scared?<eos> Of course you are.<eos> Your mother is dying, and the world is on fire.<eos> If history teaches us one thing, it is this: terrible things happen to kings.
Eight-letter word starting with "p."<eos> The clue is "not out of the question."<eos> The right answer is "possible."<eos> You wrote "passport."<eos> Why did I miss that?<eos> Doc [Sighs] maybe this is a sign of residual cognitive impairment.<eos> I-I mean, you just need...<eos> I need to see Kate.<eos> Passport...<eos> I saw a passport in Ruby's house before it blew up.
Jack's...<eos> Son.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Roger Jackson.<eos> Roger Jackson?<eos> I'm sorry. I don't know who that is.<eos> P-passport.<eos> Both: Roger Jackson.<eos> Passport?<eos> Do you know what it means?
I knew it.<eos> Chuck.<eos> Coffee?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> You're gonna have to take it black.<eos> We're out of milk?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Why are you in that space blanket?<eos> You brought your cellphone in here last night.<eos> It was in your pants pocket.
Coffee?<eos> Yeah, thanks.<eos> You're gonna have to take it black.<eos> We're out of milk?<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Why are you in that space blanket?<eos> You brought your cellphone in here last night.<eos> It was in your pants pocket.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Where, uh... where is it?
I'm a little busy right now.<eos> I've got my first order.<eos> I can't chat.<eos> Frank, when will you have time?<eos> I've been trying to talk to you all week. And those ladies want an answer.<eos> - What ladies?<eos> - The lesbians who put an offer on the house.<eos> Frank.<eos> And I've got my eye on this cute little RV.<eos> It's adorable.
Um... I gotta get back to work.<eos> Awesome. Yeah.<eos> All right, so I'll see you tonight.<eos> Yes.<eos> I know you're not helping yourself to my stuff.<eos> Well, you're not using it.<eos> Who's gonna buy this hunk of metal?<eos> You are, my friend.<eos> Heh. Donate it.<eos> It's an excellent cause. My brewery.
I don't know where Connor was last night.<eos> He wasn't here when I got home.<eos> But his... his camper was gone.<eos> - Is that unusual?<eos> - No, he goes for days.<eos> He likes the open road...<eos> Just like his deadbeat father.<eos> All right, let's, uh...<eos> That's his tarantula.<eos> W-where... where is it?
That was it. - What is wrong with you?<eos> I felt something on the back of my neck.<eos> Think we need to do our job right now,<eos> - so you need to lock it up.<eos> - It's not in there. Sorry.<eos> Um, where was this photo taken?<eos> A campground he used to go to when his father was around...<eos> Hinks Bay. Hinks Bay.<eos> Hinks Bay... I-it's the off-season.<eos> So it's probably empty.
Hey, man, yo, is everything okay, Wil?<eos> 'Cause it's been, like, two minutes and you haven't even brought up Stand By Me.<eos> Hey, Kevin!<eos> It's really exciting to talk to you.<eos> It really is.<eos> Oh, you guys are very sweet.<eos> So, Penny, listen,<eos> I saw your movie.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> I wish it was better.
What about this one?<eos> Well, I...<eos> how familiar are you with miniaturized integrated logic circuits?<eos> Not very.<eos> That right there is a miniaturized integrated logic circuit.<eos> So, can you get it working?<eos> I'm an MIT-trained engineer.<eos> I've built components for the space station.<eos> I thought the zero-gravity toilet didn't work.<eos> It worked fine, it just wasn't designed for Russian cosmonauts and their potato-based diet.
You can't win this fight.<eos> Your Honor, I'm a humble solo practitioner, merely trying to ply my trade in an aggressive and evolving marketplace.<eos> As I've argued repeatedly, this is trademark infringement.<eos> Mr. McGill's new logo is an absolute copy of ours.<eos> I think it falls firmly under fair use.<eos> Fair use?<eos> You're clearly profiting, so fair use doesn't apply.<eos> It... there are only so many fonts out there.<eos> Does Mr. Hamlin outright own them all?<eos> No, but we've been using this particular font for 12 years now, and it, in concert with our tri-rectangle graphic and Hamlindigo Blue, constitutes a trademarked brand identifier.
People noticed.<eos> I knew you had it in you.<eos> I don't see the journal here.<eos> - Right. Here you go.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Albuquerque journal... it's not here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't see it outside.<eos> Wasn't out there?<eos> It's always out there.
He's gonna find out sooner or later.<eos> You didn't care?<eos> I cared.<eos> But...<eos> Kind of made me happy, you know?<eos> happy that I was doing something that'll piss him off.<eos> This phone's just for business.<eos> We don't...<eos> It's just a collect call.<eos> - It's not gonna cost you anything.
A pair of hair pins with horses on them.<eos> - I don't know if she'll like it.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> She'll love them.<eos> Especially since they're from you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> [laughs] What, are you not a fan of cilantro?<eos> Yeah, I don't really like it.<eos> - It kind of tastes like...
You didn't tell me that.<eos> That's cool.<eos> You want cool?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, uh, this game is called "Ham Scramble."<eos> It's for ages 4 and up.<eos> And you have to smash as many little pigs as possible with a big purple hammer.<eos> What music goes with that?<eos> Oh, I'm creating a moving string motif as a reminder of our own mortality.<eos> It plays every time one green pig gets crushed.
Don't talk out loud to me.<eos> Roger that.<eos> - Who's Roger?<eos> - Who's Roger?<eos> Just... thinking about legally changing my name to Roger.<eos> What's wrong with your ear, dude?<eos> S... spider crawled up in my ear.<eos> It was living there.<eos> Right. Sends its thoughts to me.<eos> Is it telling you to leave?
Thank you. Cheers.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> You know, if I turn my coffee into a dessert, it just might be drinkable.
Yeah, that's it.<eos> This is Collins.<eos> Truck just turned onto Newcastle.<eos> Repeat... shipment's headed to you.<eos> Trace, it's, uh, it's Andy.<eos> I-I don't know what's happening with you right now, but you got to call me back, okay?<eos> The shipment's here.<eos> Bye.<eos> All right, we got to go.<eos> Peck, it's pulling around back.
Hey! Does anyone have a camera on their phone?<eos> Because these are not officers of the law!<eos> Okay. All right, all right, calm down.<eos> I demand to know the charges against me!<eos> What are the charges against this girl?<eos> Nothing.<eos> There are no charges against her.<eos> We are trying to find your father.<eos> Just show us your badge.<eos> I bet it's not even real.
What... okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> Can you tell me what it looks... Like?<eos> Okay.<eos> As far as I.A. is concerned, they're gonna see you've had financial troubles since the divorce, but you're spending money like crazy, you've had a nice promotion, your key card was used in the evidence room<eos> the day of the bombing, even though you didn't make any arrests, didn't check in any evidence.<eos> I've been spending money like it's going out of style since the divorce because I'm getting a divorce.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> There's... there's Izzy's drug charge.<eos> It disappeared.
[ Handcuffs clinking ] Peyton O'brien, you're under arrest for murder.<eos> Do you smell something?<eos> [ Doorknob rattling ] What the hell?<eos> Hey, I just found out the promoter's trailer's backstage.<eos> Chloe's not picking up.<eos> Have you seen Bryce?<eos> He was making a call, and now I can't find him.<eos> Chloe: This is Chloe. 10-33.<eos> I am trapped in the promoter's trailer.<eos> - It's on fire.
When someone shoots themselves, compared to when they're shot by someone else, there are certain... are you sure you want to hear this?<eos> Certain what?<eos> Indicators... powder residue on the suicide's hand, location of the wound, number of shots fired, angle of the shot.<eos> Every indicator about your father points to suicide.<eos> He shot himself in the chest.<eos> The head is favored by 75% of suicides.<eos> Which means the chest is favored by 25%.<eos> He obviously falls in that percentile.<eos> What about the gun?<eos> It fell on the floor next to him.
Aliens killed my wife.<eos> It wasn't my hate that kept me going.<eos> It was my love...<eos> Previously on Falling Skies.<eos> Since I woke up with the spikes,<eos> I feel like... I'm drawn to you.<eos> Espheni power core, was never on earth in the first place.<eos> It powers the entire Espheni war machine.
In the meantime, we'll just stay focused on the mission.<eos> As you should.<eos> Thank you, Shaq. ‭<eos> - Welcome.<eos> What about the overlords?<eos> Didn't cochise estimate that there were 500 worldwide?<eos> I mean, ‭do we really think they bailed before their power went down?<eos> I think most of them died trying.<eos> I saw an espheni ship crash on my way back to camp.<eos> - I doubt it was the only one.
(clears throat) What's up?<eos> Um, George, by chance, does your family still have that house on Lake Eufaula?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Why?<eos> Oh, you know, no reason.<eos> Just... I was just thinking about maybe getting a lake house for myself.<eos> You don't have any money.<eos> A girl can plan for the future.<eos> (chuckles) And, um, by chance, would that spare key be under the frog planter?<eos> Yes, it is.
This is where the action really begins.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Microbe, look at this.<eos> - No.<eos> Come here.<eos> - No, stop it.<eos> - You wimp.<eos> Your pants are sagging.<eos> - Can I see that drawing?<eos> - It's not good enough.
Tore me up.<eos> You became my guardian when I was a teenager.<eos> When you were stabbed the day Dulaque tried to grab the library, it was the day you died.<eos> Worst day of my life.<eos> Not to look a gift guardian in the mouth, but maybe you could help us with our ghost problem.<eos> Uh, ghosts aren't really the librarian's job.<eos> Well, they are now.<eos> Welcome to ghost world.<eos> There was a house.<eos> It granted wishes.
And Molly?<eos> Tried to put her in her own bed, but she wouldn't go-- stubborn.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She gets that from her dad.<eos> If you're not gonna eat, doc says sleep.<eos> Get your strength back.<eos> So, you stay lying' down, you, and it's okay.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> Betsy: That night, I had a dream.<eos> Next week, we'll discuss economic concepts... Betsy: - It felt so real...
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will?<eos> You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.<eos> It feels clean and pure, like a...
Why do you keep looking out the window, Will?<eos> You like the snow?<eos> You know, for some people, snow brings on a very specific feeling.<eos> Uh, some love it.<eos> It feels clean and pure, like a...<eos> fresh start or a beginning.<eos> For others, it's frightening.
But... she put me behind her, and she faced these men.<eos> They knew they could kill her.<eos> But they also looked her in the eyes and knew she would take at least one of them with her.<eos> And they left.<eos> Because none of them wanted to be that one.<eos> Who can say if it is we who make the choice, or the choice that makes us?<eos> ...the ceremony.<eos> The last thing we would...<eos> The color's really looking nice on her.<eos> - Think it shows the right...
So what?<eos> I don't have that yet.<eos> But look at the rest of the photos.<eos> The satellite is programmed to take a frame every 40 seconds.<eos> Here's the series.<eos> Wait.<eos> What...<eos> What's that?<eos> The fulgurite.<eos> Is it moving?
They were spoliating, the Sandpiper people.<eos> They wouldn't let me in, and I could see that they were shredding.<eos> I wrote them a demand letter, and I gave it to them.<eos> - You broke in to a nursing home?<eos> - Assisted living.<eos> And you stole their garbage.<eos> My god.<eos> No, it was in public.<eos> There was no lock, no nothing.<eos> I just lifted the lid, and there it was.
I thought about putting it in the collection plate, but... It seemed... I don't know.<eos> Look, with Matty gone, I have expenses, and the death benefit helped, but...<eos> What I want to ask you is Can I spend this?<eos> Stace, if this money helps you and Kaylee, if it does a single good thing in this world, then you spend every penny.<eos> That's a relief.<eos> It'll help a lot.<eos> Of course, it's only a drop in the bucket.<eos> I swear, everyone I know has had problems with them.<eos> The computer in the engine... it locked in the middle of the Rockies.<eos> Yeah, it decided I was overheating, and that was it.
There are a lot of assisted-living facilities out there that may be disreputable, but that's not the case with our client, not even close.<eos> All their facilities all 12 of them... every single one, five-star rated.<eos> You go to any one of them right now, and you know what you'll see?<eos> You'll see happy, healthy residents.<eos> Sandpiper takes care of these people. They don't bilk them.<eos> But we looked into it, and some of your clients have, in fact, been overbilled.<eos> It's... it's an accounting error.<eos> It doesn't rise to the level of fraud, not even close.<eos> We've calculated the damages.<eos> All told, it's $46,320.
Let's do this.<eos> Okay. Looking good.<eos> We're just going for a little ride.<eos> Here. Let me get that for you.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - Jimmy.<eos> - Just a sec.<eos> - Oh, crap. - What is it?<eos> I must have left my stupid phone on last night.<eos> It's dead.
John is weak.<eos> He'd say the statement in a heartbeat if he spent more than a few days in here, which is why I'm here and he's not.<eos> If he thinks I'm being selfish, so what?<eos> Either he accepts it or he doesn't.<eos> Isn't that what marriage is about?<eos> Accepting your partner's selfishness?<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> You know nothing about marriage.<eos> You think it's about... sacrifice?<eos> I think it's about respect.
Thank you very much.<eos> So, the guys are moving fast.<eos> - Are they living together yet?<eos> - No.<eos> Sol's very old-fashioned.<eos> Okay, you need to get in your homes.<eos> Take possession.<eos> That way, they cannot kick you out if you're in there.<eos> I don't want my home.<eos> It was always more his than mine.
Okay.<eos> Good boy!<eos> Come on, Cookie, slow down.<eos> He was in the waiting room when I got here.<eos> So, the owner's out front waiting patiently to find out whether or not he's - a murderer?<eos> - I didn't tell him I was a cop.<eos> I said that, uh,<eos> Hosehead here needs an immunization renewed.<eos> You got that list of yellow lab owners?<eos> Yeah, it's over there.
Look, you're... you're naive if you don't think you're standing on our shoulders.<eos> Okay, you owe Glee Club.<eos> Please. I owe Modern Family.<eos> Listen, when Coach Beiste kicked those guys off the team, they cornered me in the parking lot when I was getting into my car.<eos> Got all up in my face.<eos> One of them ended the day with his jaw wired shut, and the other... I don't think he ever stopped running.<eos> I can't stand Gaga, I've never seen Newsies, and I don't write Archie fan fiction where Archie and Jughead are hot for each other.<eos> Just because you and I happened to be born in the same ten percent of the population that would choose<eos> Andrew Garfield over Emma Stone, doesn't mean we have anything else in common.<eos> So, I'm not saying no to your glee club because it's gay or straight;
I have to say, my recommendation is that we make a settlement offer.<eos> I hate that idea.<eos> His entire claim to me is that we made an agreement on a bar napkin years ago.<eos> One both parties signed, which makes it a contract, and challenging its validity will easily take months, probably years.<eos> What would the settlement be?<eos> Half a million, at least.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Well, your label does have a liability-insurance policy.<eos> No, I can't ask you to do that.<eos> It's what it's for.
Well...<eos> Having a choice isn't the same thing as having control, you know?<eos> When you don't have that in your life [Inhales deeply]<eos> It can make a person pretty crazy.<eos> What do you think I should do?<eos> Well, I can't tell you that, but personally,<eos> I do tend to lean towards the devil I know.<eos> ♪ Yeah, I drank the day away<eos> ♪ but liquor ain't enough to fill me up ♪<eos> ♪ It don't fill me up
And I know we've skipped a few steps here, but...<eos> Babe...<eos> Please don't leave me anymore.<eos> Rayna, I'm sick.<eos> Please don't say that.<eos> You can do this. You can...<eos> I'm sick, Rayna.<eos> I got cancer, okay?<eos> What?<eos> I had cirrhosis of the liver, and it went undiagnosed, and it turned to cancer.
I'll let you get back to Brad.<eos> Chad.<eos> - Ch... Chad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - [Chuckles]<eos> He's not here.<eos> No?<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't wait for the night to be over.<eos> Unless, of course, it isn't.
It's only a matter of time before we find that offshore account and link it back to you.<eos> I saw that silver Mercedes parked in your spot.<eos> That does seem a little bit obvious, though, don't you think?<eos> After the reporter threatened to blow the lid off your little scheme, you realized that you had to kill him and the consul.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> If you've got evidence, then you charge me.<eos> Otherwise...<eos> No one said anything about charging you.<eos> The State Department will have you expelled.<eos> I'm sure the Bangladeshi government will be thrilled to have you back when they learn about your plan and all the lives it cost.
How old are you?<eos> 18.<eos> So, you two have stayed in touch?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We've been pen pals.<eos> What have you been doing with yourself?<eos> You look so different.<eos> You look exactly the same.<eos> Good, you found my backpack.<eos> Yes, it was in the storage room.
And I think... there was something about like a... a shield?<eos> I think she was giving it to someone. Trick:<eos> The Aegis Shield.<eos> This is Hephaestus.<eos> Or Hepha.<eos> I think I just Hepha'd my lunch.<eos> He's the son of Zeus and Hera.<eos> He's he forger of weaponry and armour for the Ancients.<eos> But why would Zee relinquish her shield?<eos> It was her protection.
Maybe it's supposed to be this way.<eos> Fuck it! I don't know.<eos> Well, love is like toast.<eos> You wonder your entire life if you want it lightly toasted or well-done.<eos> Then one day you find it - the perfect heat.<eos> The perfect toast with a crisp surface, but still with a soft center.<eos> Then it's how you apply the butter - it shouldn't melt too fast or too slow.<eos> It's a feeling.<eos> And when you have it, you'd better hold on to it.<eos> Hold on tightly to that toast or it will all crumble and disappear.
What do you mean it's your knife?<eos> I recognized it as soon as I saw it.<eos> It's my family's.<eos> My dad popped the top off a jar with it when I was eight and broke the handle.<eos> - There's a chunk missing right in the center.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How do you know what this knife looks like?<eos> Because I've used it.<eos> Many times.<eos> It's from my family's cabin.
What do you mean you couldn't do it?<eos> I felt like I was being followed.<eos> I drove to the lake and when I got there, I...<eos> I just couldn't do it.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll do it then.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> As long as that knife exists,<eos> "A" is gonna find a way to get it back.<eos> Then we make it not exist.
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God, what happened?<eos> Caleb!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Did the door shut by accident?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Where's the knife?<eos> Is it in there?
So what?<eos> We'll take another.<eos> Kill me, somebody takes my place.<eos> Long as people are buying, we'll be selling.<eos> Nothing you do tonight will change that.<eos> But go ahead.<eos> Keep hitting me.<eos> Let's see who drops first.<eos> Try stabbing him in his trigeminal nerve.<eos> Where is it?
- violates the appropriation.<eos> - So let them.<eos> It's got bipartisan support.<eos> Dunbar's going to publicly support the bill.<eos> - What about Jackie?<eos> - She's trying to stay out of it, but if it goes to a vote, she's gotta go with the tide.<eos> We don't want her poll numbers to take a hit as she's starting to gain on Dunbar.<eos> If they pass the bill, I'll veto it.<eos> If they override, I'll refuse to enforce.<eos> By the time it gets to the Supreme Court, we'll have jobs to show, they'll have nothing but rhetoric.
I have no interest in salaciousness.<eos> August fourteenth is the anniversary of the New Deal.<eos> - I'd like to hit 20,000 by that date.<eos> - I believe we can do that, sir.<eos> Remy, what's the timeline on the Senate bill outlawing FEMA funds?<eos> The Leg office predicts the Senate version will pass in two to three weeks.<eos> Working with friendlies in the House.<eos> Throw some pork on it, slow it down.<eos> That's all the more reason that we need to accelerate.<eos> If I'm gonna veto this bill, I want it to be because it's gonna kill 50,000 new jobs.
- And the cipher?<eos> - That's between you and him.<eos> France has no further interest.<eos> I find that news surprising and unlikely.<eos> French lives have been lost, Perales.<eos> Enough is enough.<eos> Then I accept.<eos> Your Majesty has shown great wisdom and discretion.<eos> Do this, and you will never lay your hands on the cipher.<eos> If it even exists.
If you lay hands on a Spanish citizen, there will be dangerous consequences.<eos> The French will never let you leave with that cipher.<eos> Perales will arrange something.<eos> I have never understood irrational hatred.<eos> It stifles every decent impulse, destroys common sense and reason.<eos> The moment a man says, "All Moors are this", or, "All white men are that", he has abandoned his sanity and revealed his weakness.<eos> And yet it is not me who is weak.<eos> Not I who will die on the scaffold.<eos> Come, give me the cipher.<eos> I will show you how it works.
And yet it is not me who is weak.<eos> Not I who will die on the scaffold.<eos> Come, give me the cipher.<eos> I will show you how it works.<eos> - No tricks, Tariq.<eos> - No tricks.<eos> Father!<eos> Father!<eos> You have failed.<eos> It is undamaged.
We'll fight this battle, you worry about how to win the war.<eos> We'll bring your daughter home.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What's going on between you and the Captain?<eos> There's something he's not saying.<eos> ~ Something he knows about me.<eos> ~ Such as?<eos> I wish I knew.<eos> Raspberry brandy?<eos> Not quite vintage, but it's good.
You were too.<eos> - Damn. - Yeah.<eos> Oh, my god, I could feel my heart in my throat when Lilly was telling me about the vodka.<eos> It's like we're living with an alien.<eos> A nightmare.<eos> It's not going to always be like that.<eos> - You don't think so?<eos> - No, she will come back to us.<eos> - Eventually. - Mm.<eos> What if it were healthy?
You want to lose your nose, hmm?<eos> Your ears?<eos> Your toes?<eos> 'Cause you didn't cover up your bell-end?<eos> You want to be answering to the name of Daddy?<eos> Coupled off to some mistake with a face like a bulldog chewing a wasp?<eos> Now I know what you're thinking.<eos> But pulling out of her cave at the last second and painting her belly won't save you.<eos> All the docs say so.<eos> There's only one way to go here, fellas, and it's right here in my hand.
Eternal damnation is the fate of Pastor Elkins.<eos> But before you go to the flames, I think it's only fair to confess the rest of my sins to you.<eos> See, what I confessed in church that night, that night you beat me like that mule, isn't the whole story.<eos> The man I mentioned I had a relationship with, he's the chief of surgery here.<eos> Dr. Thackery.<eos> You met him.<eos> You shook the very fingers I begged him to slip inside me so many times.<eos> He's older than you.<eos> And he was a terrible cocaine user.<eos> I used to get him his drugs, and in return he would dip his erect penis in those drugs and let me feel just how good it was.
Yes!<eos> Good girl.<eos> So once the pig's temperature reached 107 Fahrenheit, it killed off all the spirochete.<eos> Every last one in her system.<eos> I then gave her a large injection of quinine and very soon the malaria fever broke.<eos> She survived?<eos> Happily rolling around in her pen when I left.<eos> But, John, that's a pig.<eos> How could you be certain it'll work on me?<eos> No, syphilis has the same characteristics no matter who or what it lives in.
Dr. Thackery.<eos> Finish up and dress the wound.<eos> Yes, Doctor.<eos> Put him under.<eos> I can't go slicing around. He's losing too much blood.<eos> The X-ray is full.<eos> No time for that.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm gonna use this wire as a probe.<eos> If it comes in contact with any metal, then it'll close the circuit and we should be able to hear it.
No, it has nothing to do with...<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Because usually when you come over to talk to me, it has something to do with Lemon.<eos> Some scheme or shenanigan or the like.<eos> But, you know what, you can just tell her that I'm not interested this time.<eos> I have my hands full with the Truitts as it is.<eos> It has nothing to do with Lemon.<eos> I'm here because... (clears throat) I need to sell this houseboat.<eos> Uh... My houseboat?<eos> Uh, well, technically it's mine.
Department has unmarked cruisers you can use.<eos> Yeah, that have been vomited in, like, 100 times.<eos> Oh, come on, Cookie, up.<eos> It's not "up." It's "in."<eos> No, canine guy said the command was "up."<eos> Just grab her and throw her in the car, would you, please?<eos> I don't think grabbing her is such a good idea.<eos> Here, give me the leash.<eos> Oh! Oh! Really?<eos> It touched your hand; that's on you.
~ You're coming with me.<eos> ~ Ma'am?<eos> ~ With me.<eos> ~ Stand these people down.<eos> It was a genuine error.<eos> When you raised the alarm for three in a row, three Down's syndrome girls in a row, which the press are repeating like parrots, all this shit was appropriate.<eos> You're chasing a girl who is evidently not Down's, who hasn't even been reported missing by her own family.<eos> ~ This is nowhere near a three.<eos> ~ It's the same girl.<eos> A Catherine Calvert was riding up front on a double decker when it did an emergency stop.
Can you talk?<eos> I need you to talk, Cathy.<eos> Can you say your name?<eos> No, no!<eos> Don't fall asleep!<eos> I'm Dinah.<eos> Stay with me, stay with me.<eos> You're all right.<eos> I want to know how that man with a van A, knew we were coming and B, managed to get past 16 vehicles, seven dogs and two dozen officers.<eos> We've got limited CCTV footage on the docks because it's still 60% derelict.
What are you trying to get at?<eos> It's just a question!<eos> It's not like you're a suspect or anything.<eos> ~ A suspect?<eos> ~ No, not a suspect.<eos> Just a person of interest.<eos> You're telling me you think I had something to do with killing Samina when you have a guy, a white guy, on film?<eos> What's happened, Mr Hassan?<eos> Mr Hassan's phone was found by a witness outside the house.<eos> We're just asking how it got there.
This is the way things work.<eos> Not to mention, if we quietly settle, we don't have to worry about scaring away our clients.<eos> That's why it's the way things work.<eos> Harvey, people died in this crash!<eos> And they're not coming back, no matter what Liberty Rail admits.<eos> You are such a cold, heartless son of a bitch.<eos> And this isn't about your parents, so back them into whatever corner you want, but when they refuse to admit what they did, you are not going to trial.<eos> Stay out of my case.<eos> Something smells delicious.<eos> I'm making us dinner, but it won't be ready for a while.
- In a few minutes. - Want to grab a drink?<eos> Celebrate?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Not that it's any of your concern, but I'm having drinks with Evan Smith. What?<eos> You got her number?<eos> No, she called me.<eos> Oh, she asked for your number?<eos> No, she didn't have to. You gave it to her.<eos> It was on that subpoena.
Odds are that you've never been able to have a passport.<eos> How the fuck did you end up working in a travel agent?<eos> I mean, ain't that, like, self-harming or something?<eos> It was an obsession in prison.<eos> Not at first.<eos> I know I was ten but I still couldn't read.<eos> Then, once I'd learned the basics, the only things left on the trolleys were travel books.<eos> But, that's all I had for 18 months.<eos> Then when I got my first GCSE, the staff bought me this atlas of the world.<eos> It was literally nearly as big as me.
Swan? Partridge?<eos> Mrs Tabb, please lay four more places for dinner.<eos> Ross Poldark, the famed recluse!<eos> For all we see of you, you might be Robinson Crusoe.<eos> Oh, but he has his Man Friday, dear.<eos> Is she hereabout?<eos> Or should we seek her in the scullery?<eos> An attempt on the King's life?<eos> Ambushed for his waistcoat, no doubt.<eos> I'm told it's worth more than half the mines in Cornwall.
Empty bellies make for such looks.<eos> And his grandfather was a blacksmith?<eos> How is it possible?<eos> To leap from poverty to wealth in two generations?<eos> And maintain it in the midst of a slump, while men like you and Francis face ruin!<eos> We have different ways of doing business.<eos> ~ Who is that?<eos> ~ The infamous Matthew Sanson?<eos> ~ Does his infamy extend beyond bankrupting Francis?<eos> It extends almost everywhere and he has George's endorsement,
This doesn't happen unless she forgets to take her meds.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I ruined your cake.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> It's...<eos> I burnt it anyway.<eos> No.<eos> The pie!<eos> They brought us a pie.<eos> It's on the kitchen counter.
The next item up for auction... 900-count kids/toddler baseball caps, cotton-poly blend.<eos> Let's begin the bidding at $25.<eos> If you're gonna stay, be quiet, keep your hands down. [Auctioneer calling]<eos> That silver soda phallus is the most likely motive in Jason/Jenna's murder.<eos> This is a lifetime supply.<eos> $75 now in the front row. [Sighs]<eos> Going once, going twice... $200. $200.<eos> Stop it.<eos> I don't want damn baby hats.<eos> It was on the black market.
Are the ladies still lining up to see that pearl jam ass tattoo?<eos> Around the block.<eos> Your brother slipped me the tongue at your grandmother's funeral.<eos> I was the one who bet him that you'd go for it.<eos> [Laughs] Mm.<eos> That's a lie... total lie.<eos> You would never dare another man to take a run at me... never. [Chuckles]<eos> I always know when you're lying.<eos> The shooting was justified.<eos> I might've mucked things up afterwards, but it was 100% justified.
What?<eos> [squeals] I told you not to come in here!<eos> To my own home?<eos> This isn't your home anymore.<eos> Sure, it is, or that sign is a lie.<eos> Besides, I come bearing gifts.<eos> The only thing I want from you are signed copies of our divorce papers.<eos> I hear your request, and being that it's not in my best interest to sign those papers, I'd like to offer you a counter.<eos> These are my house keys as a gesture of goodwill.<eos> This will always be my home, but I respect that it is your house now.
How could you keep this from me?<eos> Your maybe-baby with my mother was not my secret to tell.<eos> How could she keep this from me?<eos> Because she knows you can't handle it.<eos> You're not man enough.<eos> Would you stop saying that?<eos> I'm man enough.<eos> - And I'm gonna prove it.<eos> - How are you going to do that? By raising this child as my own.<eos> It is your own.
I raised you better than this.<eos> - What, than to be a slut?<eos> - Oi, watch it!<eos> You think you can just throw yourself on anyone?<eos> Conrad!<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you... have you heard of that new movie, what's it called?<eos> Constipation.<eos> - No.<eos> - It's 'cause it hasn't come out yet.
- I think my place is down this way.<eos> - That's so funny.<eos> You don't even know where you live.<eos> Greta?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Mum, this is Elliott. Elliott, this is Mum.<eos> - Hello there, Elliott.<eos> - Hello, Mrs. Driscoll.<eos> I love your house.<eos> It's gorgeous.
- Good, 'cause I value my texticles.<eos> I just feel...<eos> - set upon, you know?<eos> - Yeah, sure.<eos> I told them I didn't want a party.<eos> I didn't want people I hardly knew here.<eos> I mean, they'll take one look at me and think I'm a complete deadshit moron.<eos> Probably.<eos> - What do you think of my suit?<eos> - It's nice.
Was it about a boyfriend cheating on you Or your parents' divorce?<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Are you psychic, paquet?<eos> No. I went to college.<eos> [ chuckles ] You know, there is a photo on davis gu's Portland annual review page<eos> Of a traditional chinese astrology wheel. But it appears nowhere on the crime-scene photos.<eos> Yeah, look at that.<eos> There's a blank space where the wheel should be.<eos> Mm-hmm. So perhaps the murder happened In the course of a robbery.<eos> You know, an old astrology wheel like this Would be worth a fortune, so we should -- We should find out where it went.
As you can see, I'm busy.<eos> I started my period and I don't have any Kotex.<eos> I need to go into town.<eos> Well...<eos> They're already in town, you're the only one that can take me.<eos> If you can't, then you can't.<eos> You cannot hitchhike.<eos> You don't know the next driver isn't gonna be a sociopath.<eos> Fine.<eos> I know you're busy, so we can try the general store, it's only halfway in.
Say, you have a lighter I can bum?<eos> So what's your deal?<eos> You just move here?<eos> Run away from home?<eos> What?<eos> - I don't live with my family anymore.<eos> - No shit.<eos> Me and this dingus just got yanked out of our parents house again the other day.<eos> Howcome?<eos> - My mom can't stay clean long enough to have some dumbshit walk through our house tell us if it's livable or not.
For yourself.<eos> Admit it.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> What isn't?<eos> She and I.<eos> If I find out you are with her, I'm gonna press charges.<eos> I swear to god.<eos> It'd be worth the humiliation to see you back in that box where you can't hurt anybody else.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your dinner.<eos> It wasn't very appetizing.
And I want to drive.<eos> I want to drive with the windows down, even if it is raining.<eos> At least 4 1/2 miles over the speed limit.<eos> I will brace myself, then.<eos> Chris Nelms said y'all raped Hanna.<eos> He's lying.<eos> Why would he lie about that?<eos> Y'all didn't tell him it was George's DNA, did you?<eos> The single sample.<eos> Chris still thinks it might be his, doesn't he?
Where's the plastic lobster?<eos> I don't think they do that so much anymore.<eos> Good news and bad news.<eos> We're out of grouper.<eos> You're out of grouper?<eos> I know... our specialty.<eos> What's the good news?<eos> Well, we have snapper.<eos> Snapper?<eos> It's not that popular.
I need another.<eos> Would you like one?<eos> No, I'm okay.<eos> Vanessa, I think I will have that drink.<eos> Okay.<eos> You said we were gonna paint.<eos> We are.<eos> Just a quick stop at Dr. Richardson's.<eos> I thought you were okay.<eos> He just wants to treat my cut right away so it heals faster.
That the Canterbury was destroyed through the actions of Naomi Nagata, an operative of an OPA sleeper cell.<eos> Are you willing to make that statement?<eos> That can't be true.<eos> Even if Naomi is OPA.<eos> She saved her own life, too.<eos> - Bring up the bogie.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> That's the drive plume of a ship decelerating hard toward us.<eos> We've been tracking it inbound ever since we picked up your distress call.<eos> It's not one of ours, or Earth's, and it won't answer our hails.
Idon'tknow.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Whathappened?<eos> Thecaptainhasset conditionzero.<eos> She'sgoing toscuttletheship.<eos> Hull breach, deck four, critical.<eos> Boarders are converging on engineering, aux, cic and the bridge.<eos> Has the ready standby left the hangar bay?<eos> Negative, sir.<eos> It's still there.
I'm here for my baby.<eos> Then you'll have to get through me first.<eos> As long as I'm around, I'm the favourite child.<eos> Is that a fact?<eos> Time for our first Father-Daughter dance.<eos> (chuckling)<eos> You want a fight, Bo?<eos> I'll give you one but, you'll lose.<eos> The child cometh. I can smell it!<eos> Give it to us. It belongs to Hades.
Your spirit?<eos> When I die, my spirit will find the next commander.<eos> Reincarnation.<eos> That's how you became commander.<eos> How are your leaders chosen?<eos> It found us.<eos> Don't be afraid, Clarke.<eos> Death is not the end.<eos> We are not dying here.<eos> I need your spirit to stay where it is.
Join us.<eos> A package from Raven.<eos> Hydrazine.<eos> She said it would do the job.<eos> Good.<eos> And, uh, your mother wanted to be here, too.<eos> I know, but the wounded in Tondc need her more.<eos> Field commanders, today's the day we get our people back.<eos> The enemy thinks it's safe behind its doors, but it's not.<eos> When it realizes that, it will fight back...
And we just changed it.<eos> That can't be right.<eos> Uh, shh... um...<eos> It's her last tank.<eos> Hey. Uh, we'll find you another one.<eos> All the supplemental oxygen is on level 5.<eos> Then we have to get you to level 5.<eos> 5 isn't safe for any of us.<eos> We'll take the trash chute again.<eos> It will work.
Why are you getting so worked up about it?<eos> I'm gonna go back.<eos> I know you are, because at my lunch yesterday with Russell Simmons, he told me about a new Broadway show his friend is producing.<eos> It's a new, original musical.<eos> They're holding auditions on Friday, and you're going.<eos> There is absolutely no way I'm going to get an audition. Really?<eos> Because I had Russell call and get you one, so what are you gonna sing?<eos> No, I'm not... I'm not ready to go back there.<eos> You want to know what the best thing is about having our gift?<eos> It's always there, like a good friend.

I'm filleting.<eos> - You know anything about cooking?<eos> - I suck at cooking.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one's ever taught you.<eos> That's all that means.<eos> Didn't you go to cooking school?<eos> Yeah. I did.<eos> And your mom and your dad helped to pay for it.<eos> I tried making a pie once, actually, and it kind of tasted like a brick.
Come on. Stand up.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll get your jacket, and we'll go home, okay?<eos> Matty!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Matty, stop running!<eos> Come on! Come on.<eos> It's okay, bud. It's okay.<eos> Matty, Matty, come on, man, your house is right there!<eos> Matty, it's right there!
For a non-profit housing project.<eos> - I found that field.<eos> - I know.<eos> So maybe you can help me with this -<eos> I am not interested in houses.<eos> It is a perfect site for an aerodrome.<eos> First, you work on the plane.<eos> Then you worry about the aerodrome.<eos> I'm sure that your financier will agree.<eos> Who is it?
But it is just the first battle of the great war to end all wars.<eos> - Hmm. - And in the words of a former vice presidential candidate and my personal Lamaze coach,<eos> "I do not retreat."<eos> "I reload."<eos> You gonna jump at me again, Sue?<eos> I just might. And then again, I might not.<eos> I had a plan.<eos> Make this school the best in the state, cement my reputation as the greatest educator since Mao, and then ride off into the sunset on the back of one of the five remaining black rhinos on the planet.<eos> Instead, well, I find myself right back where I began, with a singular, unwavering mission.<eos> I thought I had decapitated that glee club, lanced it like a genital wart, but it has emerged once again from its feculent roots.
Halliburton wanted me for their COO.<eos> One time, a very drunk Boris Yeltsin called to tell me that if I wanted Russia, he would just give it to me.<eos> I could've had wealth and power beyond my wildest dreams!<eos> But instead, I chose a career filled with service and sacrifice in order to nurture and enrich the delicate minds of America's children.<eos> Since day one, they have been and will continue to be my number one priority.<eos> Sue, a lot of these things that you have just mentioned seem like lies to me.<eos> I visited McKinley High School to talk to some of these students, and they tell a much different story.<eos> She slashed the tires on my wheelchair 17 times.<eos> She swapped out my weave glue with mayonnaise.<eos> She made a fake elevator which she trapped us in and then pumped airborne drugs through the vents and built a small robot that forced us to kiss while it watched and made noises.
How did I end up doing this?<eos> These are, like, 700-pound hay bales.<eos> Because you volunteered to help out.<eos> I didn't think I'd be stuck doing heavy manual labor, or I wouldn't have worn heels.<eos> And I don't...<eos> I don't really know all these new kids and I think they're a little pissed that I didn't re-introduce myself and now nobody's talking to me<eos> - and it's really awkward. - Oh, no. What's wrong?<eos> I'm freaking out!<eos> I-I-I'm, like, in total panic mode.<eos> I don't think this barn is structurally sound and I'm scared it's gonna collapse and just, like...
What I'm hearing is you think your husband's more important than you-- his needs.<eos> No, I just...<eos> We got a plan, you know?<eos> The word "we" is a castle, hon, with a moat and a drawbridge.<eos> And you know what gets locked up in castles?<eos> Dragons?<eos> Princesses.<eos> Don't be a prisoner of "we."<eos> Take the seminar.<eos> It'll give you a key to the castle.
Sucks to your appointments.<eos> I say let's have some fun.<eos> What do you say, red man?<eos> Should we have some fun?<eos> You betcha.<eos> Well, that's the tree I was thinking.<eos> You want me to do it?<eos> No, it's better me.<eos> You sure about this plan?<eos> It'll work.
You or-- or-- or-- or Peggy or both.<eos> This is all just so crazy.<eos> And I can't stop thinking about that book.<eos> Noreen's book.<eos> It's, like, stuck in my head.<eos> What?<eos> What book?<eos> It's about this guy who, every day, he-- he pushes this rock up this hill.<eos> Like a boulder.<eos> And then every night, it just rolls back down.
Processing him now.<eos> - But as his lawyer--<eos> - Don't need no lawyer.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - As his lawyer, I gotta advise you of somethin', which is this--<eos> You're makin' it worse.<eos> He's a minor, see?<eos> Only 17.<eos> So, reduced sentencin' applies.<eos> Shh. And yes, witness puts a gun in his hand with a shot fired, but it's a miss.
But, I mean, mail service is what, three days?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just... no, no.<eos> C-can you hold onto it for me if it's not too much of a bother?<eos> It's no problem.<eos> You said you're close.<eos> I'll just...<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'll jump in the car and... Wait till you see this workbook.<eos> It's like a road map to unlocking your inner go-getter.
While we're skippin' down memory lane, here, it's worth noting' that the Gerhardt Indian is out there free, probably callin' for reinforcements.<eos> So, if I were us... I stabbed him. ...I'd get them outta here.<eos> Or cover 'em in bacon and leave 'em for the dogs.<eos> I stabbed him!<eos> The Indian. He wanted a haircut and I stabbed him with the scissors.<eos> In the back.<eos> Boy, she makes us look like the gang that can't shoot straight, doesn't she?<eos> Our beautician.<eos> It's worth mentionin', you know, in the spirit of full disclosure,<eos> my plan, it worked.
You won't believe what they built down there.<eos> It's kilometers of shafts with electricity and air ventilation and everything.<eos> But there's this one tunnel which is blocked by a metal door.<eos> It's the only tunnel which is blocked.<eos> This shaft heads right for the fence.<eos> I think it leads outside. Out of the colony.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> We have to give it a try.<eos> I also found another exit.<eos> It leads out into the workshop.
You're going to die, but you will die a witch, and we will consecrate your body.<eos> You will join the ancestors of the French quarter, and those spirits can be brought back...<eos> And I promise you, brother, I will not leave this body until I find a way to bring you home.<eos> I tried a different spell.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'm... I'm not scared.<eos> What did you do?<eos> It took a while, but I healed you, brought you back from death using this.<eos> Your pendant.<eos> You said it would protect me.
I came here hoping you'd have some witchy way to figure out what's wrong and help me fix it, though you don't look so good yourself.<eos> Have you gotten any sleep lately?<eos> No!<eos> I've been here studying all this stuff since Kol died, and I thought you were gonna help me bring him back like you promised.<eos> Look. I can't help Kol if the witch he stuck me in ends up taking me over.<eos> There's something wrong.<eos> I think the rightful owner of this body is waking up inside me, and she's angry.<eos> These are Kol's spell books.<eos> I'm sure there's something in here that can help.<eos> This witch hoop, it's Danish.
Then my leaves will tell us everything we need to know.<eos> What devil are you?<eos> Someone you once loved deeply, my father.<eos> I've no time for your riddles, witch.<eos> Do you not recognize me?<eos> Can you not see the daughter you thought died so long ago?<eos> You lie!<eos> You named your sword rawthul after the early morning sun.<eos> Its hilt was golden like the color of my hair.<eos> You said it would remind you of me while you were in battle, that I'd be by your side no matter how far afield you traveled.
I told him what I knew, but if Eva's coming back here, I don't want anything to do with her.<eos> Rebekah? Rebekah?<eos> I'm having flashes of memory, but they fade almost as soon as I've had them.<eos> All of us live with a demon inside.<eos> Rebekah Mikaelson!<eos> You can't hide from me forever!<eos> Some days, you control the demon...<eos> This is my house!<eos> You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.

You ok?<eos> And other days, it controls you.<eos> And it is always hungry.<eos> It feeds on lust, on longing.<eos> And while you may slumber, the demon never sleeps.<eos> It tempts you into crossing every line you've ever drawn...<eos> All while it hunts you...<eos> Haunts you...<eos> Renders you incapable of telling friend from foe...<eos> But once it has turned your loved ones into enemies, the demon will have consumed you whole.
Daddy, that actually helps.<eos> But, I have to go now.<eos> Wait, just listen to me.<eos> Be careful out there, ok?<eos> Because I don't know what I'd do if anything happened to you.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> I love you, sweetheart.<eos> I love you, too, daddy.<eos> One of the aldermen has a pacemaker.<eos> If it's remote programmable... It'll have a GPS.
We discussed that.<eos> Thea wants to stay in the loft.<eos> I have only been able to survive in Starling City because the League has no idea where in the city I am.<eos> We are not leaving the loft.<eos> You and your sister have the same stubbornness.<eos> Clearly it comes from your mother's side of the family.<eos> It's pretty amazing how much Malcolm taught you in such a short time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's father of the year.<eos> Your fighting style, it-- it reminds me a bit of Sara.
Sorry.<eos> Waller's a little too thorough for her own good, and by "thorough," I think you know I mean paranoid.<eos> Well, I've gotten used to it by now.<eos> Where is she, anyway?<eos> Well, the mop-up of the Alpha/Omega bioweapons problem has become a United States Army operation.<eos> Ms. Waller's participation is concluded.<eos> I'm sure that comes as a profound disappointment to you.<eos> Oh, like you wouldn't believe.<eos> I apologize for the invasiveness of your debrief.<eos> And now that it's over, you're free to go.
The Romans called it vastatio.<eos> The systemic destruction of a land to ensure its subjugation.<eos> And what they found was that immolation left a blank slate to build anew.<eos> Until you have destroyed your home and severed all ties from your old life can you begin anew?<eos> I did not foresee the day that Maseo Yamashiro appeared at my door.<eos> You had the courage to demand an audience of me.<eos> And those who do usually offer money and treasure in exchange for my favor.<eos> But you gave me the Alpha and Omega.<eos> The plane is en route.<eos> It will be ready tomorrow, as you've commanded.
Ok.<eos> Suit up.<eos> Oliver...<eos> Suit up.<eos> I just want to get this shipment done.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> We're looking for the Catoca shipment.<eos> Maybe you could help?<eos> The Catoca shipment.<eos> Where is it?
You trusted<eos> Malcolm Merlyn more than you did the two people closest to you!<eos> John, it wasn't about trust!<eos> It was about making sure that you and you were safe.<eos> I had to keep the circle as small as possible.<eos> How did you expect to repair all this once you got back?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling and I sabotaged the plane.<eos> The plan... was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.<eos> It didn't work.
Tie your hem again.<eos> Did you have fun making your whimsical decisions?<eos> That is your problem.<eos> Why divide the court into your side and mine?<eos> As your son, I wanted to restore military control back into your hands...<eos> You think I left things as they are because I'm ignorant?<eos> My policy of 'Magnificent Harmony'...<eos> You rendered my life's work worthless in just one day.<eos> The throne is not a place for making decisions.<eos> It's a place to moderate decisions and ask who's responsible.
Or worse -- me!<eos> Being wrong about sabine isn't gonna make me a cynic.<eos> Hope is what drives me to be a cop,<eos> And hope's what's gonna drive me to catch her.<eos> What drives you?<eos> Nadia: Um, detectives?<eos> I found something on the remains of graeme hellman's computer.<eos> This plane belongs to klassen.<eos> Maybe he's picking up sabine.<eos> It pulled up to a private seaplane dock Just a few hours ago.
We never move past this.<eos> Right, Lemon?<eos> Mm-hmm. Move.<eos> Yummy.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, not that one.<eos> See, there's only one buttermilk muffin.<eos> Yes.<eos> That is correct.<eos> And now it is mine.
I'm not your boyfriend.<eos> Besides, we have paperwork to do.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Michelle!<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> How was school?<eos> You don't have my bracelet.<eos> You know what, I had to use it.<eos> It helped me save a lot of people today.
Yeah, it was all me.<eos> I needed more money, so I had to go find the boss... and made him a proposition, took the initiative.<eos> Dad would've been proud.<eos> What was the proposition?<eos> I'd like to know.<eos> Excuse me a minute, will you?<eos> Tell Rayburn I owe him one.<eos> The load is safe?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Gonna leave it where it is for now.
- You need a theme.<eos> - I've got a theme.<eos> - What?<eos> - Booze.<eos> People can drink at home.<eos> You need to... amp up the fun.<eos> - Yeah, like, great music can do that.<eos> - Yeah, get a jukebox.<eos> I got a jukebox in the back.<eos> It's busted, though.
Wear patterns match.<eos> Yep. Same manufacturer.<eos> It's also zero drop.<eos> Um, I'm gonna have CSRU come in here and bag the shoes and dust the apartment.<eos> Wait, Jane.<eos> There's something else.<eos> Bob Burke wouldn't allow the hospital to run any blood tests, so I sent Susie over to his apartment, and she managed to get some samples off the welcome mat where he vomited.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - There was no trace of cyanide.<eos> It had to come out, or he'd be dead.
Wha-what does he want?<eos> What do you think he wants?<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Guess you had some fight in you, after all, huh?<eos> You know, I've never met a high cheekbone I didn't like. But I gotta say that's not a great look on you.<eos> And it won't work on me.<eos> With the Nyx unleashed, we have front row seats to the end of the world.<eos> We'll be safe in here as long as we have...<eos> Where is my shield?<eos> It was right here.
I saw it in the park. Everything she touches dies and turns to nothing.<eos> Well if she kills everything she touches, how did you...<eos> Survive?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But if we don't contain her, we're all...<eos> Burnt toast.<eos> That's why I released you from Tartarus.<eos> Help me get rid of Nyx.<eos> I assume you mean with the box.<eos> If it contained you, it can contain her, too.
She was different.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> Where are my pants?<eos> What happened?<eos> What changed?<eos> After Iris took off her bracelet, it was like something happened.<eos> Iris told me her parents made her wear it.<eos> The bracelet is made of Adamantine.<eos> We don't need your help.<eos> If the bracelet's made of the same material as the box, maybe it can contain her, too.
The days of sacrifices, human worship.<eos> It's time now for us to be seen as the Gods that we are.<eos> Not if I can help it.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Well, "A" for effort.<eos> You know what they say:<eos> Optimism is a form of courage.<eos> Now give me my shield back.<eos> Get back.<eos> It may protect you, but what about your people?
- Why?<eos> - No idea, but...<eos> Every time it happened, a different number would ping off the same tower almost immediately.<eos> - So Ronald has another phone.<eos> - Looks that way.<eos> - Is it registered to him?<eos> - Not that we've found yet.<eos> But that second phone always traveled to a rural region of Connecticut.<eos> Stays there a few days, then heads back to Boston.<eos> When it shuts off, then the other phone reactivates.
Did I hurt you?<eos> How strange that a thing is before, another behind?<eos> I am absurd.<eos> We'll have a lovely day today.<eos> One must make the most of it when on holiday.<eos> Monsieur Lucien and Lena have already left.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Monsieur Lucien is doing up a charming house for them.<eos> Very rustic.<eos> It's dragging on a bit, but great.
Did it go well?<eos> Couldn't have gone better.<eos> Imagine that he's a new Russian.<eos> Roubles in real time.<eos> The best customers.<eos> Oh no, this is my thing.<eos> That his first wife never warned me who I would have to deal with...<eos> Well, she couldn't have, dead as she was.<eos> I'm telling you... the caprices, a calamity for all this filth.<eos> Your scarf, where is it?
What dining room?<eos> The one from just now, dammit.<eos> Pointing through the ceiling.<eos> I see a rake.<eos> A rake, why not.<eos> If it's an arrow, then it was carved recently. I can smell it.<eos> Smell, you?<eos> You're drenched in this nauseating perfume.<eos> Ralph and Lang.<eos> Monsieur Lucien found it very good on me.
Now, tell me, did you keep any of her childhood toy blocks?<eos> Toy blocks?<eos> He's not our guy.<eos> We've got nothing so far.<eos> Taxi driver was a dead end.<eos> Coupon had nothing to do with the murders.<eos> Back to square one.<eos> Anything on your side, Krummy?<eos> Checked out ZoGo's firewall.<eos> It stopped 15 separate attacks in the last two weeks.
To make sure it was safe.<eos> Evony: Test it?<eos> On who?<eos> Stacey: You'd think a portal to Valhalla would be hard to miss.<eos> But that's what I said about genital warts... (bang)<eos> Okay.<eos> Tam-Tam?<eos> I don't think we're alone.<eos> Okay, let's just find the thing, so we can get out of here.<eos> It has to be around here somewhere.
No, a-a different Carol. Carol, I was, uh, married to this other woman named Carol before the virus.<eos> You told me you were single.<eos> Before I got married to that, uh, Carol. And, uh, she died in that, uh, tragic... snowmobiling accident.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I miss you.<eos> You're disgusting.<eos> Disgustingly good at pranks! God, you know, before I go on, can I just say, this is really disrespectful to Carol.<eos> The other Carol.<eos> The late Carol. Uh, but, you know, back to this prank.<eos> So, you know, God, it was gonna be such a great one, a-and then you guys all just ruined it.
Lady Felicia is well acquainted with the family.<eos> She'll be looked after.<eos> Might be an idea to get some light in here, sergeant.<eos> Shutter's locked tight, sir.<eos> There's no key.<eos> So, did anything unusual happen at the reading?<eos> Did Miss Moxley seem at all distracted to you?<eos> She was nervous before she read.<eos> What's her latest novel about?<eos> It's... it's about a murderous boggart locked in an attic wreaking havoc, scratches up the floor and then disappears up the chimney.
D'av?<eos> Come back?<eos> Lucy, what's going on with the music.<eos> I'm experiencing interference.<eos> Recalculating.<eos> Come back.<eos> Dutch, say again.<eos> I said there's some kind of barricade.<eos> Signs of a fight.<eos> - Guys, we're not alone! - I ain't sure if you guys can hear this, but I found the transponder, and it's...

- I'll wait.<eos> All right, I got to go.<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> All right, bye.<eos> Jackie.<eos> Why are we in the lab?<eos> I'm not doing this.<eos> You're not doing what, the hearing?<eos> - No, I'm not doing the fucking pee test.<eos> - It's your last one.
I don't think that's gonna be a problem.<eos> Okay.<eos> George's wallet was there for one.<eos> How do you know it was his?<eos> I saw his driver's license.<eos> What else?<eos> His cellphone.<eos> I thought you said George's cellphone was used six weeks ago in Paulie.<eos> Yes.<eos> So, if that's his phone, it somehow got back to his trailer after he died.
You make it sound so easy, but if you and Audrey can pull it off...<eos> Then no more shroud, no more Troubles.<eos> We get to live happily ever after.<eos> You know, I hope you're still saying that a couple of decades from now.<eos> I don't mean to spook you, but I'll be hunched over a walker, and you'll still be what you are.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I got a thing for older men.<eos> I can hear them approaching.<eos> The end...<eos> It isn't coming.
It was a long time ago.<eos> But why... why did they banish him?<eos> He became obsessed with his research... began experimenting with forces beyond his control.<eos> The Aether?<eos> From the Void?<eos> Yeah.<eos> To my people, Aether is like...<eos> What's the equivalent here? Um...<eos> Plutonium.<eos> Powerful, and, in the right hands, can do wonderful things, but it can also destroy everything.
Holbrook?<eos> I can write a better letter.<eos> Talmadge recently hired Jackie Molina as an admissions officer.<eos> As in your ex Jackie, who hates my guts?<eos> Jackie wrote it.<eos> It worked.<eos> What are you gonna tell us Ezra?<eos> Toby was on a search at Mona's property, and found a bloody knife.<eos> Where's the knife?<eos> Is it in there?
And so we're just getting some things out of storage for him.<eos> Are you here often?<eos> Every month or so.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, I guess this really isn't the kind of place where you get to know your neighbors.<eos> You're talking about 1017, aren't you?<eos> That smell, am I right?<eos> Smell?<eos> Oh, yeah, there's some sort of an odor.<eos> It wafts down the hallway sometimes.

All right.<eos> Have a good evening.<eos> No, I mean call it quits.<eos> It's been days now.<eos> We did it, Maurice.<eos> We won.<eos> Mmm.<eos> We won't know what to do with ourselves.<eos> All this quiet!<eos> I'll send you a draft of my book before it goes to the publishers, make sure you're happy with everything.
That's when Braulio hanged himself.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm sure that won't happen here.<eos> Shall we get out of here?<eos> When I told you about my angina, you said that you get a tightness in your chest, like there's a scream that you can't get out.<eos> And then when the voices came, the tightness went away.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, some people think that... ..that poltergeists happen when people are repressing their anger.<eos> You can't push it away, the anger.<eos> It's like air under the linoleum - it pops up somewhere else.
A few weeks back, guy got pulled in for sexual assault in Venice.<eos> DNA matched six unsolved rapes, including your ex-wife's kit.<eos> He'll get life, sounds like.<eos> Get results.<eos> I'll make sure you keep your kid.<eos> Frank, thanks for coming.<eos> My position is you people owe me some land.<eos> I'd have a hard time convincing my board of that.<eos> Imagine word of how that corridor's gotten bought up over the past five years.<eos> How exactly it came to be so cheap.
Yes.<eos> But I did not kill her.<eos> The most stable elements, Chiyoh, appear in the middle of the periodic table, roughly between iron and silver.<eos> Between iron and silver... I think that's appropriate for you.<eos> Do we talk about teacups and time and the rules of disorder?<eos> The teacup's broken.<eos> It's never going to gather itself back together again.<eos> Not even in your mind?<eos> Your memory palace is building.<eos> It's... full of new things.

They're outside because they smell so strongly.<eos> Here's to mother and baby!<eos> Angel Pagani<eos> PS:<eos> Does the doctor think the baby's normal?<eos> It's got an odd-looking face.<eos> Shall I bring it in?<eos> No.<eos> Leave it there.<eos> It's not very pretty.
Huh? And what the hell were you talking about?<eos> What was I talking about?<eos> Why am I so screwed up, huh?<eos> Why do I have allergies, and why am I so much shorter than everybody else in my grade?<eos> Hey.<eos> You're just different, okay?<eos> That's all.<eos> We're all different.<eos> No!<eos> When you live around a sin, it starts to infect you.
Somewhere beautiful.<eos> What made you stay?<eos> I didn't.<eos> When I was 12 years old, my mother, she sent me to stay with relatives.<eos> Had a farm, middle of nowhere.<eos> Those were good years.<eos> But you came back.<eos> Yes.<eos> Time and distance, they afford a certain clarity.<eos> I realized that this city was a part of me, that it was in my blood.
Would you like to leave?<eos> No...<eos> I'd like a reason to stay.<eos> I've done things that I'm not proud of, Vanessa.<eos> I've hurt people...<eos> and I'm going to hurt more.<eos> It's impossible to avoid for what I'm trying to do.<eos> But I take no pleasure in it... in cruelty.<eos> But this city isn't a caterpillar.<eos> It doesn't spin a cocoon and wake up a butterfly.

Ben, she said the receipt could help eliminate you as a suspect.<eos> If the model of your flashlight is different than the one forensics indicates was the murder weapon, then you're off the hook.<eos> Don't you need a search warrant?<eos> Only if you're unwilling to cooperate.<eos> The problem is, if I come back here with a warrant and CSIs and detectives, the press is just gonna film the whole thing.<eos> And no matter how I try to protect you, they're not gonna listen.<eos> Those hyenas will just keep rolling and let the picture tell the story.<eos> We appreciate you taking all that into consideration.<eos> Ben, do you know where the key is?<eos> Yeah. It's right here.
We need the money.<eos> Screw the money.<eos> We need to talk about this right now.<eos> We will talk about this when I get home.<eos> What, am I too loud?<eos> What is it?<eos> What happened?<eos> My flashlight came back.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> It fell out of the truck when I opened it.
All right, let's move this fucking couch.<eos> All right, keep still.<eos> Okay, stand back!<eos> You've got it.<eos> Here we go.<eos> May I approach?<eos> No!<eos> No. I'm gonna throw it.<eos> Careful.<eos> It was a gift.
Previously on "Secrets And Lies"...<eos> My flashlight came back.<eos> Got to get rid of it.<eos> It's in a safe place.
And I am sure yours is gonna be the next one.<eos> You think so?<eos> Of course.<eos> I've been listening to your demo nonstop.<eos> Don't you know how amazing you are?<eos> Oh, I do, but I wanted to hear you say it.<eos> [ Laughs ] Come on in.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Wow. Your office is fantastic.<eos> Oh, it's not mine.
Oh, my god.<eos> Honey! You gave us quite a scare.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You're alive, that's what!<eos> Hallelujah! Spence and miguel are on their way.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Weird.<eos> I hope i can still go on my honeymoon.<eos> What?<eos> It's on saturday.
But this time, you have to be clear with him about us.<eos> I will.<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> It's not you I don't trust.<eos> Mon coeur, I wanted to talk to you about the other night,<eos> - when we... - when we didn't do anything.<eos> You know, thank God Mr. Powell walked in on us because it would have been a huge mistake.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> I love you, and you love me.<eos> Well, I love chocolate, but it's bad for me, so I don't eat it.
If you don't mind me asking, what do you do for a living?<eos> I'm a nuclear scientist.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm Marisol.<eos> I called ahead.<eos> Are you Alan?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're the one looking for your old couch, right?<eos> Actually, it belonged to my boss, Mrs. Stappord.
You barely know her.<eos> Why are you defending her?<eos> Because she has cancer.<eos> What?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She didn't kill your friend.<eos> She's been too busy fighting for her own life.<eos> Santo dios.<eos> She's got the cancer?<eos> Jesse says it's advanced.
Aw... I love you ladies.<eos> Wait, should we be checking on zoe and wade at the hospital?<eos> Oh, zoe texted, and they said they have quite a while.<eos> So, i say, right now we get good and sloshed.<eos> Lavon hayes, don't you know anything about women?<eos> I mean, sometimes you have to lie.<eos> "does this dress make me look fat?"<eos> "oh, no."<eos> "do you like my meat loaf?"<eos> "oh, it's better than my mama's."
- He's a child molester.<eos> - Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> They all start somewhere.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> "Mr. Trent was a pedophile with a criminal record.<eos> "He lived in close proximity to the burial site of a murdered child."<eos> "After being questioned by investigators, he committed suicide."<eos> "Whether Mr. Trent was responsible for the death of the victim is pending further investigation."<eos> Given that the LAPD is being blamed for Trent's suicide, I think we can agree this press release will do nothing to help our situation.<eos> It's accurate.
I am here now.<eos> They have murdered me, Rochefort.<eos> Find Dr Lemay and arrest him.<eos> I will discover who is responsible for this, sire.<eos> I swear it!<eos> ~ The King is dying!<eos> ~ The King has been poisoned!<eos> I'll stay, find out what's happened.<eos> This is Rochefort's plan.<eos> Whatever it is, it is well advanced.
Relax.<eos> That's not Pete Best.<eos> You're freaking out.<eos> He's not Pete Best.<eos> Relax. We'll be fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'm... I'm fine.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Yvan, I forgot my passport!<eos> It's in my jacket.
[Inhales sharply] Oh, you love the drama.<eos> And speaking of drama, I hear Savi is missing?<eos> Not missing... traveling.<eos> Can we stick to me and my case, please?<eos> Oh, of course.<eos> Yes.<eos> - So [Sighs] have a seat.<eos> - Yes, thank you.<eos> So, what's our plan of attack?<eos> Well, it's pretty straightforward.
A full-service agent.<eos> How can I thank you?<eos> Actually, I stopped by to thank you... For doing the benefit.<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> No way.<eos> A Tsukasa Hinoura knife?<eos> I had it specially flown over from Japan.<eos> I'd like to say "you shouldn't have," but I'm afraid you might take it back.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's yours to keep.
A few years ago, I went off birth control, but then I got sick.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I'm not an idiot, Karen.<eos> I know there's none of me in there.<eos> I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.
She loves a breakfast lasagna.<eos> Dogs don't eat nachos.<eos> Plus, we're all so worried about how she's doing with the whole - Paul breakup.<eos> - She's fine.<eos> - I'm seeing her later.<eos> - Okay, well, then, uh, give her my love.<eos> Well, not like "my love," just like, "S'up?<eos> Hang in there, kid."<eos> You know. Something chill and friendly-like.<eos> My Uber driver called, like, six times and it didn't even ring!
I just don't even know what I want anymore.<eos> You want what everyone wants.<eos> You want to come home at the end of the day to someone who's happy to see you.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm getting a dog.<eos> - Mmmm... - Yeah.<eos> Oh, you know, I cannot figure out how to boot this thing on.<eos> You got a computer.<eos> You don't even like the smoke detector.<eos> - I just don't think it should talk!
Dude.<eos> Christina moved out?<eos> What happened with the wigs?<eos> I got distracted by this business guido.<eos> All right.<eos> I put our name in.<eos> - 45 minutes, we're in. - Whoo!<eos> I feel like every city has a parrot dude.<eos> You ever see the guy with the cat on his head?<eos> Yeah, wonder if it ever touches the ground.
Then I'll get out of your way.<eos> You have dinner reservations or something?<eos> I've been getting a blip.<eos> It's weak, but it's there.<eos> If all goes well, I'll be back with some aether by sunset.<eos> It's a fool's errand, Nathan.<eos> Aether's not important now.<eos> It's better than sitting on my hands.<eos> What's aether do?<eos> It could end the troubles.
This early, huh?<eos> I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.<eos> I need to get all the sleep I can.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.<eos> - What?<eos> The hurricane turned.<eos> It's due east now.<eos> It might hit Bermuda.<eos> But it'll, uh, dissipate quickly now that it's reaching colder water.
So as we're both working...<eos> Are you listening, Eddie?<eos> OK.<eos> Before we move out.<eos> We can't afford to move.<eos> Not on your salary!<eos> It'll change, trust me.<eos> First thing to go is your TV.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> It's a joke!
And then you received the "Kaboom!" text.<eos> Yes.<eos> When the explosion happened... I was near the car.<eos> And Sam was much closer to the...<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> The officer that I spoke with said that the 200 was the last text that was sent out.<eos> - Back away, back away! - Means my phone set off that bomb.<eos> I have to live with that.<eos> My phone killed all those people.<eos> It killed my son.
Add the bomb blast plume, eliminating human carnage.<eos> Guys, guys.<eos> Damn, that was real.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's find this hard drive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right here.<eos> That's the hard drive.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's see where it lands.
Right here.<eos> That's the hard drive.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's see where it lands.<eos> Krumitz, advance the explosion.<eos> Um... I can't.<eos> The photos and the video that we compiled only take us up to the moment the bomb exploded.<eos> After that, it's just bits and pieces of data.<eos> Okay, so we know the hard drive was propelled in this direction, right?<eos> Mm-hmm. And we also know eventually, it would have to land.

And we also know eventually, it would have to land.<eos> Means it's somewhere further down the alley.<eos> Yeah, but we collected every of bit shrapnel from the alley and we didn't recover the hard drive.<eos> Then something interrupted the course of its trajectory, so, Krumitz, run a line from the point of the bomb blast through the hard drive and advance the alley toward us.<eos> Okay, the flight path of the hard drive takes us right into these two people-- this is about where it would have landed, right about there.
No, that's not a log-in and password.<eos> That's an address to my deep Web site where I keep all of my exploits and what you're looking for.<eos> You can't remember your password?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Do you have any idea how many exploits these babies have created? Countless.<eos> Oh, uh, one last thing, kind of important.<eos> Tell your new hacker pet, Brody Nelson, to be real careful when he visits the site.<eos> I hear he's quite good, but then again, this malware is some of my most aggressive.<eos> Go this Web site.<eos> It's Tobin's.

At an office supply store.<eos> Do you want to play games?<eos> The code, Rusty.<eos> The code in the flash drive-- who gave it to you?<eos> What makes you think I didn't write it?<eos> You're not that smart.<eos> You're a step above script kiddie.<eos> Hey, I was, uh, gonna try and help you guys out, but if you're gonna insult my skills...<eos> It's incredibly sophisticated code.<eos> It highlights a big flaw in Public Electric printers.

Listen, I don't need one of your therapy sessions.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> I understand.<eos> The idea of losing somebody you care about...<eos> No, Michelle is not going anywhere.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> But Devon is.<eos> So this office printer wasn't on the same network as the other printers?<eos> No, it was.<eos> Then why didn't it burn?

Whoa, dude's got no fingers!<eos> Touch her stuff again and neither will you.<eos> Okay.<eos> What a pleasant surprise it might've been if Chinese brains or Spanish brains or Italian brains tasted like the cuisines for which their regions were famous.<eos> No such luck.<eos> Besides, my taste buds are as half-dead as the rest of me.<eos> Dr. C, I hear you got a John Doe for me.<eos> Oh, he's right over here, Detective.<eos> Yeah, I'll never how you can eat down here.<eos> That's why I leave my coffee at the bottom step, so it doesn't get that morgue-y smell.
It's a cobra.<eos> A blue cobra.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Very cool.<eos> Much cooler than if you chose, say, a puff adder. Or a common krait.<eos> Uh, I think you've embarrassed yourself enough for one day.<eos> Uh, we're gonna go away. Um...<eos> Lovely store, gentlemen.<eos> That's not just a shop renting more Asian porn than I could possibly imagine.<eos> It's like the Blue Cobras' clubhouse.
Put me through to Devore.<eos> We'll deal with this later.<eos> We need to find Ray.<eos> The team will meet you at the hangar.<eos> I'm guessing 20 minutes.<eos> Do nothing before your backup's there.<eos> Okay, I'll see you there.<eos> Ray's on his way back from five days in Hong Kong with a shipment of Utopium.<eos> The Cobras like to use a private airstrip outside Snohomish to avoid Customs.<eos> It's gonna be close, but I think we can get there before he lands.
I know you didn't, Shaw.<eos> The only problem is...<eos> You will.<eos> No, I swear, grand master.<eos> I would never say anything.<eos> No! I swear!<eos> Juliette.<eos> Sorry to wake you, but I'm worried Nick might've been trying to call.<eos> - Rosalee.<eos> - Could you check your phone just to make sure it's on, please?
No, I swear, grand master.<eos> I would never say anything.<eos> No! I swear!<eos> Juliette.<eos> Sorry to wake you, but I'm worried Nick might've been trying to call.<eos> - Rosalee.<eos> - Could you check your phone just to make sure it's on, please?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I didn't realize how tired I was.<eos> It's on. Nothing.
I hate coriander.<eos> - You've always liked coriander.<eos> - No, I haven't.<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> - I don't like coriander.<eos> - What's coriander?<eos> - Just don't eat it.<eos> Why did you put coriander in it?<eos> I've told you I don't like it.<eos> - It's all over the salad.
It's been 15 years since we were last in the final.<eos> I didn't know you followed volleyball?<eos> What?<eos> ! I'm a big, big fan!<eos> And what do you like most about it?<eos> Huh?<eos> Er...<eos> You know, the... the tactics!<eos> ~ Tactics?<eos> ~ You know, the... getting the ball over the net thing before it touches the ground.
I came outside, he told me that she'd already driven off.<eos> If you're looking for your partner, she just drove off.<eos> But you didn't actually see the Jeep yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I saw it.<eos> ~ And you are?<eos> ~ Alison Turner.<eos> Saint Marie team captain.<eos> I'd gone out early for a jog, to run off a headache.<eos> It went past me down the beach road.
~ Ah, Chief!<eos> ~ Yes?<eos> The victim's phone is back, and it's only her own blood and fingerprints on it, nothing else, and the final call made last night was to her parents.<eos> The last text was to Jasmine Laymon at 9pm last night and it reads... ~ "Sorry.<eos> Made an appointment for tomorrow afternoon." ~ An appointment for what?<eos> That's all there was.<eos> But there is something else.<eos> JP went through her apps, and there's a voice memo recorder.<eos> ~ And?<eos> ~ There's only one file... .. and it has today's date.

I did tell you I had my best team on the job.<eos> They secured this phone from one of our players.<eos> A call had been made to it the day of the semifinal offering a sum of money very similar to the ones you so generously donate to your charitable causes.<eos> The number, naturally, was unregistered.<eos> Shall we dial it?<eos> Was there... anything else?<eos> Sorry, Chief.<eos> Don't be.<eos> It was an inspired thought.<eos> But if it was his phone, it wasn't there.
Is Will okay?<eos> Um, we found something.<eos> Hey, what about peanut butter?<eos> - You're not really a dog person, are you? - Uh.<eos> Where is this dog, anyway?<eos> He's tied up outside, fricking barking like crazy.<eos> I'd be barking like crazy too if somebody left me out there.<eos> You know what?<eos> Um, give him my sandwich.<eos> It's chicken.
Here comes the Narcan.<eos> - Hey, hey. Hey. Hey.<eos> Where am I?<eos> Welcome to San Antonio Memorial.<eos> You, sir, just had a heroin overdose.<eos> - Uh, I slipped a disk last year...<eos> - I don't care why you took it.<eos> Do not take any more.<eos> This dope is tainted.<eos> It will kill you.
Pulse ox is down to 87.<eos> Let's go. Get it in.<eos> His cords are slammed shut.<eos> I can't pass the tube.<eos> Toph, he's choking to death.<eos> Okay, sats down to 70.<eos> Airway still closed.<eos> What is that?<eos> Laryngeal nerve block.<eos> It'll paralyze the vocal cords.
I could tell you, but then I'd have to kill you.<eos> A little patience, Callahan.<eos> Jordan!<eos> Hey. What do we got?<eos> 9-year-old boy...<eos> Ethan.<eos> He has a temperature of 101.<eos> He is burning up.<eos> I'm very concerned about his fever.<eos> It hasn't gone down.
Just one thing you have to do first.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know any of the names on this list.<eos> I know who was at the wedding, but...<eos> There's got to be a connection, all right?<eos> Somebody who was at your wedding has to know someone who was on Trubel's list.<eos> How am I supposed to know who everybody knows without asking them?<eos> We should go over your wedding guest list.<eos> I'll have to get it.<eos> It's on my computer.
I mean, talk about a tragedy.<eos> We need the ladder to get across a rift in the tunnels.<eos> That's where everyone went.<eos> We need to get across and find them.<eos> Find Barbie.<eos> You still believe, don't you?<eos> That the dome is good, that... that it's here to protect us.<eos> If you still believe that, then you're even dumber than the bag of hair I took you for.<eos> The dome is here to destroy us.<eos> It killed them all.
No.<eos> No, I'm not giving up... on Barbie;<eos> on our friends!<eos> Julia, your leg.<eos> You're hurt, exhausted.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Look.<eos> These... things... connecting all the cocoons and they're all coming from up there.<eos> Julia, I'm scared!<eos> This cocoon, it's... different.

I cannot betray my vows.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> You just get up on that stand, and you testify that you killed a pedophile that drove a boy to kill himself.<eos> The D.A. will knock it down to voluntary manslaughter.<eos> You might even get to walk.<eos> The sacramental seal is inviolable.<eos> I will not betray it.<eos> You won't betray an institution that created the environment for the abuse to occur?<eos> Father Bernard's sin is his alone.<eos> Why should it influence my commitment to the lord?
On no notice, I threw a killer party with the people I care most about.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where are the people I care most about?<eos> Zo?<eos> Oh. You're all up here.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> We were all waiting up here to show you the present we got you.<eos> Well, where is my present, baby girl?<eos> No, it can wait till after the party.
Because every day I have to live with the agonizing, piercing screaming in my ears.<eos> [laughs] I almost forgot... I told your pet I know your deep, dark secret, Harrison.<eos> Have fun letting him in on that one.<eos> - I assume you were all listening.<eos> Well, Hartley was telling the truth.<eos> I have not been honest with you.<eos> With any of you.<eos> The accelerator...<eos> Hartley warned me that there was indeed a chance that the accelerator could explode.<eos> His data did not show 100% certainty, just that there was a risk, but it was a real risk.
You must pray to do your duty.<eos> ~ Oh...<eos> ~ BOLT WHIZZES<eos> HE GROANS<eos> SCREAMS AND GASPS<eos> BUZZ OF CONVERSATIONS OUTSIDE<eos> Good vantage point, well concealed, an all-round view and easy access to an escape route.<eos> The killer knew what he was doing. This was planned well in advance.<eos> Why a crossbow?<eos> From this distance, it's more accurate than a musket.
Oh, dear.<eos> TREVILLE COUGHS AND CHOKES<eos> A moment, my lady.<eos> What is it?<eos> Have we not said enough to each other today?<eos> I know, forgive me.<eos> My crucifix is missing.<eos> You haven't seen it?<eos> Not recently.<eos> I thought perhaps it might be in your chambers.
What is it?<eos> Have we not said enough to each other today?<eos> I know, forgive me.<eos> My crucifix is missing.<eos> You haven't seen it?<eos> Not recently.<eos> I thought perhaps it might be in your chambers.<eos> Don't you know where you last had it?<eos> I've grown so used to having it there, I... (I'd hate to lose it.<eos> It's very important to me.)
This is us along here.<eos> Right here, storm drain outlet.<eos> We have to climb through there?<eos> It's not exactly close.<eos> We'd be walking right into the skitters.<eos> Too far for the 2nd Mass to get through, but a few of us maybe to get supplies.<eos> Whoever breaks for it's gonna need some major downfield blocking.<eos> Yeah, we'll have to lay down a whole barrage of cover fire just to have a chance.<eos> What other option do we have?<eos> Colonel's right -- the storm drain leads north, it goes under the skitters, it comes right out of Savannah.
I'm sure this is all very unexpected.<eos> Yes, that's certainly true.<eos> Forgive me, I'm not used to expressing myself in romantic terms.<eos> But I do love you, and I believe I can make you very happy.<eos> Come here.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> Was she being forced?<eos> She could have gone willingly, but she seemed scared to me.<eos> This house Levesque took her to, what's it like?
Can't say I didn't deserve it, though.<eos> How'd you survive the Invunche?<eos> The only way I, I could.<eos> I cast off my spiritual protections, invited the demon, Pazuzu, in to take my body for a spin.<eos> Unholy bastard's first order of business was to heal its host.<eos> You're possessed by a demon.<eos> I feel surprisingly good.<eos> Demonic permeation's like a flu.<eos> There's an incubation period between first infection and... Full-on possession.<eos> I figure I got a couple of days before it takes up permanent residence.
You have the strength.<eos> You shot me to save those babies.<eos> I just need you to summon it up just one last time.<eos> Anne, please.<eos> You're our only hope.<eos> At least try.<eos> Bloody John Constantine.<eos> Center of attention again.<eos> This demon will try to use our weaknesses against us.<eos> If it emerges, don't listen to it.
Bullock's right;<eos> you start pointing fingers, you could jeopardize your reinstatement.<eos> You need concrete evidence to even think of accusing another officer of murder.<eos> I'll start with the guard duty logbook.<eos> Jim...<eos> Winkler was my witness.<eos> No way I'm letting this ride.<eos> I asked him to come in here;<eos> I'm gonna find his killer.<eos> No matter who it is.
Don Falcone, please!<eos> Maroni wants my scalp and you'd have me redecorate?<eos> This nightclub makes a lot of money.<eos> Without money, we lose influence.<eos> Without influence, we lose control.<eos> And without control, Maroni killing you is no longer a hypothetical, it's a foregone conclusion.<eos> That's why I want to reopen it.<eos> Under your care.<eos> I can have the club?<eos> - It's mine?
We have one simple choice:<eos> We die here alone on our knees! ... or we stand up and we fight! ...<eos> A couple of riggers found her right here.<eos> We decided to hide her on the truck.<eos> We were going to give her a proper burial as soon as we got back on the road.<eos> Decent of you.<eos> Who's "we"? Who else knew?<eos> Just me and the head of the families. If an outsider killed her, what can you do?<eos> An act of God.<eos> If it was one of us, we always find out.
Specifically, I'd like to discuss how you used them to convince Skye to run off and rescue Lincoln.<eos> I didn't convince Skye.<eos> I just told her what was gonna happen.<eos> It was dangerous and it was foolish, and it won't happen again.<eos> From now on, any decisions based on your gift<eos> - will be made by me. - It's funny.<eos> I was just thinking, who decided you should have final say in all the decions around here?<eos> - Raina...<eos> - I'm just saying, maybe the time has come for someone else to...<eos> I'm guessing HYDRA doesn't know Loki's scepter was the weapon that killed me, but I bet they know it can control minds.

I'm grateful for your visions.<eos> You'll be a valuable adviser.<eos> Adviser.<eos> Growing up, my dream was to lead the Inhumans.<eos> Life is rarely what we dream.<eos> I've learned that more painfully than most.<eos> And now I've come to accept it.<eos> It is not for me to lead, but to illuminate.<eos> I've seen the future... and your plan.<eos> Does it succeed?
Did I do that?<eos> I didn't do that.<eos> Did I?<eos> I believe you did.<eos> Unis have been called to the Donovan house a hell of a lot of times.<eos> Neighbors reported strange lights, sounds coming from inside the house at night.<eos> But every time cops arrived, the place was empty.<eos> No wonder they stopped responding.<eos> With no living heirs, the bank seized control of the house five years ago.<eos> It's still up for sale.
Oh yeah?<eos> Yet you had no problem calling me a devil girl, huh?<eos> Okay, I admit that.<eos> But I really don't believe in such superstitious nonsense.<eos> Now I think I do, though.<eos> I saw Judas' ghost.<eos> Not.<eos> Everyone in the class has seen it.<eos> Not...<eos> It appeared right in the middle of class.
I rather enjoy it, actually.<eos> Although, the... the real thing is considerably more impressive.<eos> Are you trying to butter me up, Mr. Jarvis?<eos> Merely pleased to receive your call.<eos> Well, you are faster than a train.<eos> How flattering.<eos> It's very nice.<eos> You did dispose of the old car?<eos> I left it in hoboken with the keys in the ignition.<eos> I don't imagine it's still there.
What is that?<eos> That is the prototype for a new system of armor.<eos> How do we get it off him?<eos> I'm afraid it's not that simple.<eos> Please don't touch.<eos> It was intended to double as a heat source, for use in the winter months on the European front.<eos> Locking the armor ignites a self-sustaining battery.<eos> But there's always a catch to this stuff, isn't there?<eos> I'm afraid the energy source is experimental, powerful, and incredibly flawed.<eos> It invariably overheats with rather violent results.
I am quite certain there is only one person in the world who knows what to do with this...<eos> You, Miss Carter.<eos> - ♪ But to love you ♪ - Bye, my darling.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> You're gonna have to speak up.<eos> Don't despair, friend.<eos> The food here is actually quite good.<eos> Hmm. A minor consolation, I know.<eos> You had a vision, and it didn't come to pass.
If I'm not there by that time... there isn't anything you can do to stop that from happening.<eos> But it won't be the end, Vanessa.<eos> It's... it's just an inconvenience.<eos> Nothing will ever keep us apart.<eos> Fifteen minutes to the drop.<eos> Repeat, 15 minutes to the drop...<eos> You were right... what you told me over the radio that night.<eos> Not everyone deserves a happy ending.<eos> You?<eos> I wanted to make this city... something better than it is.
I wanted to make this city... something better than it is.<eos> Something beautiful.<eos> You took that away from me!<eos> You took everything!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Take your shot.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow.<eos> It deserves to drown... in its filth!
Something beautiful.<eos> You took that away from me!<eos> You took everything!<eos> I'm gonna kill you!<eos> Take your shot.<eos> Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> This city doesn't deserve a better tomorrow.<eos> It deserves to drown... in its filth!<eos> It deserves people like my father!
More than anything.<eos> Shit!<eos> I'll get a cloth.<eos> Dear Justin and Kate.<eos> We are going back to Germany.<eos> We realize that our presence here is a cause of tension and regret.<eos> We need time to grieve our loss, and you need freedom to enjoy the birth of your child.<eos> What has happened, has happened.<eos> What matters now is that you have your child and that Jon and I return only once we feel liberated from this awful emptiness that currently inhabits us.<eos> We will not come back unless we can honestly say congratulations to you both, and bless your new child with all the benediction it deserves.
This Jordan Valley thing's a mess.<eos> He's in big trouble.<eos> ...any such actions...<eos> And then there's the whole AmWorks thing.<eos> All the baggage from last year.<eos> - You having doubts?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That sounds serious.<eos> If there was an ideal time to walk away, now is it.
You know, as a matter of fact, my buddy Ramse here has a hole opening up in his schedule.<eos> No, it's all you, brother.<eos> He might be able to help you out.<eos> Fate has chosen you, Mr. Cole.<eos> Let me show you.<eos> Let her show you.<eos> What the hell is that thing?<eos> That is our salvation.<eos> The virus is not yet done with us, Mr. Cole.<eos> It will mutate again and again until not even the immune are left standing.
Mr. Cole, grab the strap.<eos> Aaron, it's me.<eos> Cole's not here, I'm sure.<eos> I've bribed officials, talked to locals, and now I'm standing in front of the blast site.<eos> No one survived, and there's no body.<eos> He did it.<eos> He saved the future.<eos> He was erased.<eos> It's over.<eos> The virus, it got out?
Yeah, I could use her help on the Cutler case too.<eos> Our forensics guys couldn't find anything on Simon's laptop.<eos> I was hoping Liv could look at it, maybe get some whoo-whoo.<eos> I was planning on dropping in on her later.<eos> I'd be happy to drop the laptop off if you'd like.<eos> What am I supposed to do with it?<eos> Well, Clive thought if you handled Simon's laptop, you might pick something up.<eos> Yeah, I know how Clive thinks my fake psychic powers work, but what's your endgame here?<eos> Are you expecting me to eat the hard drive?<eos> It's password protected, what am I supposed to...
Proof that Shane Tillman was at the scene of the crime.<eos> Proof that he murdered Adel Foster?<eos> If we're lucky, both.<eos> It's called a motion tracking chip.<eos> Most new smartphones have them, but most people don't know they exist.<eos> It's a motion co-processor that collects and stores motion data on the phone's accelerometers, gyroscopes and compasses.<eos> All right, so basically it just... it records movement.<eos> Yeah, it's how an exercise app knows the difference between when you're jogging versus walking, which direction you're headed-- pretty much however your phone's moving.<eos> As the phone moves, the motion tracking chip records all of it.<eos> It will detect a pitch, a roll, a tilt-- every movement the phone makes.

There are snakes.<eos> - Don't move!<eos> We're coming!<eos> The snake-repellent will work this time?<eos> Of course it will.<eos> People won't work in a field with snakes.<eos> Sure.<eos> They don't dare kill them. And you are leaving too.<eos> Yes, but this product will work.<eos> It comes from the United States.
Lots of pills later, I was fixed... mostly.<eos> Then they came.<eos> They wanted to know.<eos> Weren't gonna stop until they found out where it was.<eos> Where what was?<eos> Daddy's great and shadowy laboratory... filled with evening stars.<eos> He called it the Night Room.<eos> It's an off-site lab with his teeny tiny little secret locked inside.<eos> The virus.<eos> I knew where it was.
- No.<eos> No, that was someone else.<eos> Been here ever since.<eos> 773 days locked in a cell, apologizing to ghosts.<eos> You don't know what that's like.<eos> You'd be surprised.<eos> Jennifer, listen to me.<eos> The Army of the 12 Monkeys are gonna steal the virus from that lab.<eos> They're gonna use it to kill everyone.<eos> You need to tell me where it is so I can find it.
Deacon's a cult.<eos> His followers... his followers are murderers.<eos> You got a short memory, man.<eos> You and I did plenty before the 7.<eos> - When we had to.<eos> - It's the same thing.<eos> When we had to!<eos> Deacon's taking... for power.<eos> He's murdering... 'cause he likes it.<eos> Whatever this world is now... it shouldn't be this, man.
You have to promise me something.<eos> It won't make any sense.<eos> It's the keys.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm still here.<eos> I'm glad I got to know you.<eos> Viral strain m5-10 was derived from remains discovered during a private core sampling expedition in the himalayas, mid-1980s.<eos> Now, from the preserved tissue we extracted a previously-unknown pathogen, which we genetically modified at Markridge into this weapon, which we will be deploying in Chechnya for Operation Troy.<eos> If released in this room, this virus would kill every one of us in 2-3 hours.<eos> Leland said it would be controllable.
There are people...<eos> Dangerous people...<eos> Trying to get their hands on your virus.<eos> Right now my "friend" is the only one who can stop them.<eos> You and I both know exactly what will happen if your virus gets out.<eos> Dr. Peters, you know Dr. Railly?<eos> We've crossed paths.<eos> What do you have to say about this?<eos> This virus is the... Deadliest ever created.<eos> If there's the slightest possibility of it falling into the wrong hands, I'd listen to what she has to say.
But Barry's got a date tonight.<eos> I'll cancel.<eos> No!<eos> No, go.<eos> If we need you here, something tells me we can get you back in a hurry.<eos> I'm not picking up anything.<eos> Not even with The Super Light.<eos> Super Light?<eos> Well, technically it's a multi-spectrum, violet laser-enhanced scanner that detects molecular schisms in the 600 mega-volt range, but I figured "Super Light" was easier to say.<eos> Right, but what does it tell you?
I just saved a lot of lives.<eos> I warned you not to mess with the timeline.<eos> Dr. Wells, if you would just let me tell you what was gonna happen, you'd understand why I did this.<eos> Whatever tragedy you think you've just averted, time will find a way to replace it and trust me, Barry, the next one could be much worse.<eos> Don Santini, they're here.<eos> Move it.<eos> Oh, love the paneling.<eos> Mahogany?<eos> So glad your house is made out of wood.<eos> It's gonna be a pleasure watching it burn.
Welcome home.<eos> It is so fun to watch grown men play with their toys.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> Ray is so nice and smart and hot.<eos> Yeah, it's kind of like I'm dating Barry but in Oliver's body.<eos> A sentence you will never repeat to anyone.<eos> Your secret's safe with me.<eos> It must have re-activated.<eos> And if it's being controlled wirelessly...<eos> I can trace its signal and figure out where it's trying to go.
- Oh, yeah.<eos> What do you think Wells was using it for?<eos> I think this thing is some kind of battery.<eos> - Battery? - As in Wells was using it to power himself.<eos> To gain more speed.<eos> And that's why he's so much faster than you.<eos> The accelerator, it's been reactivated.<eos> - It can't be.<eos> - How is that possible?<eos> It blew up.
Do you see a power button anywhere on this thing?<eos> Dude, this thing is from the future.<eos> It's beyond me.<eos> I press or touch or cut the wrong thing I could bring the building down.<eos> Okay, how long until it's fully functional?<eos> Best I can tell, 36 hours.<eos> That's when Wells will be back.<eos> Why would Wells want the particle accelerator to work again?<eos> I don't know. It's not like it was a success the first time.<eos> - It made me the Flash.
Kevin, what's going on?<eos> What are you gonna do about Danny? Huh?<eos> You gonna do something?<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> You know that I found a gun in his--<eos> One of his suitcases, huh?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> No, I know you didn't know that.<eos> But it's not-<eos> - It's not in his suitcase.
What are you gonna do about Danny? Huh?<eos> You gonna do something?<eos> I'll fix it.<eos> You know that I found a gun in his--<eos> One of his suitcases, huh?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> No, I know you didn't know that.<eos> But it's not-<eos> - It's not in his suitcase.<eos> It's in my fucking hand right now.
It's him, boss.<eos> Don Maroni.<eos> Yes.<eos> Alive and well.<eos> Ah, that's a long story.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I have something you want.<eos> They didn't find my knife.<eos> So we're saved then.<eos> It's in my sock.
So I guess I will continue to be awesome and generously open my home to all of your stuff.<eos> Great!<eos> Oh, how about I take the big hall closet?<eos> - How about you shut your mouth?<eos> - No...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Is that closet special?<eos> Is it the one you came out of?<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's one closet for everybody... and it's here.
Groovy.<eos> Rachel happen to mention I was a cop?<eos> No?<eos> It's true.<eos> Have a nice night.<eos> If you want me to go, I'll go.<eos> No, no.<eos> I want you to start acting as smart as you are.<eos> - Why do you care?<eos> - Because you think this town was just built to throw cash and fun at your pretty face, but it will rape you and stab you and disappear you.
It looks organic in nature.<eos> Suggests secondary transfer.<eos> How's it going with your new toy?<eos> Oh, camera's acquired the image.<eos> Just loading it now.<eos> So this thing is gonna give us T.O.D. on our victims?<eos> Well, it's worth a try.<eos> We've had this hyperspectral imaging prototype in the lab for over a month.<eos> I've been waiting to field-test it.<eos> How's it work, exactly?
Where is Finlay?<eos> You'll never find her in time.<eos> She's still alive.<eos> She's got to be close.<eos> He said he was gonna take her to the desert.<eos> He has to get her there somehow.<eos> Greg, Morgan, where are you?<eos> We just rolled up. In the garage.<eos> We need to find Winthrop's vehicle.<eos> We believe it's on the premises.
Uh, okay.<eos> What was wrong with the lobby?<eos> He said the chairs suck.<eos> Thank you, Morgan.<eos> Look who's raring to go.<eos> I've been waiting a long time for this.<eos> Okay, then why don't you walk me through the facts of the case.<eos> Do you want to refresh your memory?<eos> Don't need to.<eos> Remember that day like it happened yesterday.
And maybe when I get better, you stay.<eos> Don't unpack now.<eos> Come into the den.<eos> My show is about to go on.<eos> And maybe you can make us some sandwiches.<eos> And, Julio, get me some socks.<eos> My feet are freezing.<eos> Oh, and I can't find the remote control anywhere.<eos> Hail Mary, full of grace, our lord is with thee.<eos> I know it was here somewhere.
Just when I'm about to get a medal?<eos> How about Robbery Homicide?<eos> Uh, yeah, they popped in.<eos> Said they'd be back when my rep was present.<eos> You need to think about what you're gonna say before they lock your story down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll just tell them again what I told them tonight.<eos> Which was...?<eos> Asshole went for my fucking gun.<eos> It went off.
- After you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Audrey, we just have a couple of questions about Rachel Murray.<eos> We were hoping that you could help us answer them.<eos> So the murder investigation's finally happening?<eos> Good.<eos> You two were working on a video project together.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, we were.<eos> What was it about?
There totally is.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll find it.<eos> Damn.<eos> They used to hide their key there.<eos> Yeah, we used to leave our back door unlocked.<eos> And then a serial killer happened.<eos> All right.<eos> On to Plan B.<eos> Love me some Plan B. What is it?
_<eos> Scream - S01E09 The Dance<eos> Hey, guys. It's Piper Shaw, with a special Halloween podcast of Autopsy of a Crime.<eos> So, in looking for a connection between the Lakewood murders past and present, I had to wonder about Brandon's mask.<eos> Turns out, it disappeared from county evidence last year, but was never reported.<eos> If I were Sheriff Hudson, I'd be looking into the chief suspect's whereabouts around the time the mask went missing.<eos> But even then, what's Seth Branson's, or rather Seth Palmer's, connection to Brandon James?<eos> Why become the monster behind the mask?<eos> We found this knife in your classroom.<eos> Any idea how it got there?
Um, we have to stay here to help with the search, okay?<eos> Mom, is there anything I can do for you?<eos> No...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm gonna, um, go get cleaned up.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Noah?<eos> Well, I've almost isolated the signal.<eos> And I figured out why we can't reach people.<eos> The malware doesn't just access webcams. It turns off ringers and notifications.
The DVDs are locked in storage.<eos> You want 'em, you're gonna have to let me in on the case... over drinks.<eos> Well, sure.<eos> If I can find the time.<eos> Don't be coy.<eos> I don't like coy.<eos> Coy's not my thing either.<eos> I never thought I'd say this... but you got to be more careful.<eos> You found the truck.<eos> It entered Maple and never left.
He must have run off.<eos> You all right?<eos> You let him escape?<eos> Nothing useful on her phone, Harold.<eos> Swept the BB. It's clean.<eos> We have to move fast.<eos> Your little voice finally tell you something about Sameen?<eos> No, but Ms. Thompson will.<eos> At a minimum, she may know what our rival is making in the factory and how it's manipulating the people of Maple.<eos> If it re-creates this in other cities, countless people will suffer.
The blonde woman told me a few must be displaced so that the majority may thrive.<eos> Everyone rewarded according to their abilities.<eos> But the things we saw today--<eos> There have been some recent changes.<eos> Mason shooting that poor man...<eos> Things have fallen out of balance, like we're being punished.<eos> It isn't punishment.<eos> It's studying us.<eos> Our enemy hasn't had the time to learn the intricacies of human nature, so it's turned Maple into its own little ant farm.<eos> It took a broken town and rearranged the populace.

Travel and communications will be affected for the duration.<eos> Communications?<eos> What kind of storm are we talking about?<eos> Lethal.<eos> All that pollution, it builds up until a heat wave whips it into<eos> - an electro-acid rain storm.<eos> - Falling on John's head?<eos> He'll be fine at The Royale.<eos> Pree knows his business.<eos> Well, if this monster's what we're facing, should we stay on Leith until it passes?
Let me go back in there for you.<eos> I have a better shot at ending this without any more bloodshed.<eos> He's really good at fixing things.<eos> OK, Killjoy.<eos> Bring us the crew, the claims, and our guy alive.<eos> It's on you now. 30 minutes, or we storm the place.<eos> How are you going to deliver all that?<eos> Quickly.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - It's dirty.
Hate to cut you off, Yasin.<eos> At the risk of repeating myself--<eos> Glad we had this talk.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I just want to see your laptop.<eos> My laptop?<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do anything you say, just please don't shoot.<eos> Please be careful, it's fragile.
No!<eos> Put me down!<eos> No!<eos> No, I can't leave!<eos> I can't, I can't!<eos> No!<eos> Let me go!<eos> No!<eos> I can't...<eos> His control, whatever it is, it wears off.
I'll do the same.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Team work?<eos> Free shots for everybody.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Shit's bad for business.<eos> What?<eos> Hi. Yes.<eos> Yes, I did call about the kidney machine.<eos> Um... It's not... dialysizing.
Jeri's smarter than this.<eos> You don't throw away the life we built together.<eos> She'll see that, eventually.<eos> Maybe if you do me this favor, she'll be reminded of your good heart.<eos> I have actual patients waiting for me.<eos> You need to go.<eos> Look, there is someone out there doing a lot of harm to a lot of people and as crazy as it sounds,<eos> Sufentanil is my only chance at stopping him.<eos> I don't have access to surgical anesthesia, so here is a prescription for an anti-psychotic.<eos> It's for you.
Wish I'd grown up somewhere excessively normal like this.<eos> I'm sorry, what is it you want?<eos> Yes, I've always been bad at small talk.<eos> I'm used to just saying things and they happen.<eos> It spoils you.<eos> Well, what a burden.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Well, I need to go.<eos> I'd like to buy your house.<eos> It's not for sale.

This whack job is dangerous.<eos> - She just lost her brother.<eos> - I didn't lose him.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Please, this won't happen again.<eos> Whack job.<eos> Ruben's chinchilla chewed through his charger cord two weeks ago.<eos> And I wouldn't let him pay for express shipping.<eos> Ruben was such a great guy.<eos> He was kind and gentle, and... I don't know what he put in that banana bread but, it was like crack.
Stop there, Jessica Jones.<eos> God damn it!<eos> I want you to know, I forgive you for everything.<eos> I'll say it every day for as long as you need to hear it.<eos> You heard that?<eos> I wrote it!<eos> Surprise!<eos> Mr. Cage had been ordered to ring me about your exploits since before he blew up his seedy little bar.<eos> Uh, the 12-hour window at that point was actually 16 hours.<eos> Now it's 24... and a hundred yards.
Evil prick.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be on the couch.<eos> Man, if you got taken down, we are all in the shit.<eos> Christ.<eos> Jeri Hogarth.<eos> "Biological material, fetal tissue, Hope Shlottman.<eos> Submitted to testing by J. Hogarth."<eos> Killgrave made me tell him where it was.<eos> It's useless anyway.
through a suitable load coil, you can generate - Three.<eos> an electromagnetic pulse capable of scrambling<eos> - Two.<eos> One. the alarm's electronics.<eos> (alarm whooping, alarm shuts off)<eos> As you can see, the Norseman falls quite silent.<eos> You ruined the rest of the electronics.<eos> You didn't beat the alarm if you can't steal the car.<eos> Actually, electronic devices are more susceptible to an EMP if they're turned on.<eos> You simply calibrate the pulse so it doesn't affect the automobile's dormant electronics, and the prize is yours.
'Cause that one over there's his mother, but this one, he's gonna be a bull one day.<eos> Might as well get used to it, right?<eos> We'll need to hurry to town if you want to catch the last night bus.<eos> Or you're welcome to bunk in our guest room, get a fresh start in the morning.<eos> If it's not too much trouble, we'd love to stay.<eos> No trouble.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So this is what you were telling me about.<eos> The meteorite contains every element known to man, plus one we've never seen before.<eos> But every time we try to extract it, let's just say it becomes very volatile.
You know how this is gonna all end; you know the prophecy.<eos> Yeah, well, the prophecy's about to change.<eos> The Rapture isn't gonna happen on our watch.<eos> You've got balls.<eos> Unfortunately, your fellow Messengers are gonna have a hard time stopping the Rapture with one less among their ranks.<eos> It's glowing blue again.<eos> Like earlier.<eos> While you were spirit-walking, perhaps?<eos> The Genesis element hasn't changed its appearance at all before today.<eos> But now, for some reason, it's behaving quite differently.
Now, with my dad, he said that I-I lacked ambition. That I, um, I was too meticulous and hesitant.<eos> But... I believe in doing things the right way.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Vincent loves a quick score.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So... it made things difficult.<eos> Now, we don't often see eye to eye on certain projects.<eos> Like Smart Rain?<eos> Yeah, exactly like Smart Rain.<eos> And when it destroys farms after Vincent launches it, he'll make sure I get all the blame.
We can go visit them together, like seeing pictures in a book.<eos> Please follow me into the window.<eos> Circle!<eos> When I was your age, there was a controversial new exhibit in the modern art museum.<eos> An artist placed a clone on display in a stasis tube.<eos> A child without a brain that the public could watch grow old in real time.<eos> Can you smell the floor polish?<eos> The museum's antiseptic but musty odor of countless generations in passing.<eos> What was his name?<eos> Museum visitors nicknamed the body "David," and it became a popular attraction.

I have a red robot and a pink robot.<eos> I enjoyed working with them.<eos> I enjoyed the solitude.<eos> The robots are solar powered, and must always be kept on the light side of the moon's surface.<eos> To motivate them to constantly move within the drifting sunlight,<eos> I programmed them to fear death and what lies on the dark side of the moon.<eos> It's getting dark outside!<eos> It was here, on the moon, that I fell in love with a rock.<eos> I did not understand my mental and emotional shortcomings at the time and only knew that I found this rock to be immensely attractive.<eos> It was sparkly.
I should perhaps tell you that he and Valerie have been living separately for over a year now.<eos> Nobody here knows that, except me.<eos> Did she mention suicide?<eos> No.<eos> I mean, did she EVER mention suicide to you, Dr Plant?<eos> Yes, once.<eos> After she was diagnosed?<eos> No, it was after that.<eos> When her marriage broke down.<eos> Why did it break down?
This is what happens.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I said turn it off!<eos> Here!<eos> Fill those bags now.<eos> I think they must have called it off.<eos> No, look.<eos> I say we sit tight.<eos> Cos you never know.<eos> They might even hit the bank when it's closing, sir.
Have at it.<eos> Alamo Brewhouse was just bad luck.<eos> And you didn't find any drugs?<eos> Different day, we would have.<eos> I want to start with the agent who led the raid, Gonzalez.<eos> I understand that the restaurant owner filed a complaint against him.<eos> Gonzo got a little overheated, you know.<eos> He's on administrative leave.<eos> I'll, uh, I'll get you his home address.<eos> Um, Dennis, I'm gonna want to take a look at that report of yours before it goes in.
Be advised, we have a suspicious package at Union Square Park at 14th and Broadway.<eos> Have Bomb Squad respond at this time, please.<eos> Do you have the appraisal?<eos> I have the appraisal. Okay.<eos> What about the letter from the mortgage broker?<eos> I got the letter from the mortgage broker.<eos> Come on, stop worrying.<eos> Maybe you should have worn your blue tie.<eos> Why?<eos> It brings out your eyes.
- Yeah, amazing sound.<eos> -Want me to see if they'll do your wedding?<eos> -I don't know.<eos> -Still mulling.<eos> -You don't like 'em, no worries.<eos> But if you do, I should talk to them soon.<eos> Gonna grab us another round from backstage.<eos> Think about it.<eos> So, what happened to "cancer made me a nice guy"?<eos> It did.
They could be single again.<eos> They likely will be.<eos> But you and I are actually committing to spend the rest of our lives, potentially the very few days we have left, tied down to another person.<eos> When you and I say "till death do us part," we really mean it. It's the end.<eos> But hey, if that doesn't bother you, mazel tov.<eos> You are a braver woman than I.<eos> Wait!<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> My bachelorette party is over already?<eos> Oh, babe, it's gotta end sometime.
I will forget more about keys tonight in my sleep than you will learn in your whole lifetime.<eos> J... Jerry, it's... it's... it's not about me.<eos> It's about Marco.<eos> ♪Oh ♪ His son, actually.<eos> What, little Jason?<eos> [Sighs] He's, uh, dead.<eos> He... was murdered.<eos> What?<eos> Murdered?<eos> Look, this key, whatever it leads to, could help catch whoever did it.
And then you killed Julian.<eos> What?<eos> Julian's dead?<eos> Erik, now is not the time to start playing games.<eos> I didn't kill Julian.<eos> I gave him the art to sell.<eos> I needed him.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> I ran the DNA samples of Julian's killer through the database.<eos> Let me guess. It doesn't match Erik Haas' DNA.
Ping her phone, find her.<eos> I hope I'm not being too forward, dinner at my place.<eos> Mm, don't worry.<eos> I brought my gun.<eos> Really?<eos> No, not really.<eos> Good.<eos> Tonight, you don't need to be a cop.<eos> I've dreamt of having this view since I was a kid.<eos> It never gets old. Where are you from, exactly?
Burst capillaries and pink froth in the airway.<eos> Ah -- asphyxiation.<eos> Of course.<eos> No ligature marks or contusions at the neck.<eos> No sign of a struggle.<eos> There's a small scratch on his forehead, But it healed well before the time of death.<eos> So, how does someone asphyxiate lying in bed alone?<eos> [ sniffs ] [ sniffs ] Mercaptan.<eos> It's a compound they add to natural gas To give it that unique smell.<eos> See, gas is heavier than air, So it settles down to the ground.

I don't want to lose this job.<eos> Murder investigation.<eos> His name's eric shaw.<eos> You ever seen him before?<eos> Has he ever been here?<eos> I believe you knew him.<eos> Intimately.<eos> Like i said, i've never seen him.<eos> Then you wouldn't mind coming down to the station So i could compare the stud in your eyebrow To the scratch we found on the victim's forehead?<eos> Yes, if you were kissing, it would be right here.
- It was the night.<eos> The best moment in his life.<eos> And what did Sarah do?<eos> She tells me she's just found out she's pregnant...<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Just the way my late wife told me.<eos> And in my excitement, I take her picture because I want to remember that moment for the rest of my life.<eos> But each time...<eos> The moment seemed to slip farther and farther into the past.<eos> It felt fainter somehow.
I'll go.<eos> No, don't go.<eos> Don't go.<eos> What's this scar?<eos> It's a burn.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Cooking accident.<eos> I've had it for ages.<eos> Not on the back of your neck.<eos> It's a cigarette butt.
We found a cut in her neck made from a bread knife.<eos> Our lab said the white particulates in the cut...<eos> They were from styrofoam.<eos> You know, like the kind they use to package gifts in from, say, a wedding registry.<eos> We'll get a warrant for your place.<eos> You can just relax.<eos> I have a feeling you're gonna be here a while.<eos> Okay!<eos> Blair told me about the dagger.<eos> She found it in a box, and she thought it could be valuable.
Of course you do.<eos> She's stable.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> All right, take her into two.<eos> Oh, oh, hey.<eos> That looked like a barrel of bloody laughs.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I was just...<eos> There was, there was a light.<eos> It was white hot, and it-it came from above.

- It better be... if we're gonna walk in there and admit to treason.<eos> What's that?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It needs a separate password.<eos> Ah. It's gonna format.<eos> Uh... what's happening?<eos> What's happening with the file?<eos> - It's deleting.<eos> - What's happening?<eos> - What is it doing?
Now, listen to this.<eos> April 1 0th, 1 1 : 1 4 p.m., "Taking my girlfriend to the Apple store."<eos> April 1 2th, 3:42 p.m., "Picking my girlfriend up at the mall."<eos> Yeah, so?<eos> So, your laptop was in the shop for three days, right?<eos> The 1 0th through the 1 2th, right?<eos> Yeah, and?<eos> April 1 1 th, 2:48 p.m.,<eos> "Ran a test of the perceptual modeler during lunch,<eos> "made a few tweaks and wow, it's working on a whole new level."
You're never gonna sell. - What?<eos> - Look what's happening here.<eos> It's magical.<eos> The only thing magical is how much this house has appreciated in the last three years, Jared.<eos> I'm selling.<eos> That's just money.<eos> It has no real value.<eos> It literally defines value.<eos> Look at this check.<eos> You can't actually cash it, but think about what it represents.
Bye, Claire.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Go to hell, Matt.<eos> Noah, I'm so sorry. I had no idea.<eos> How'd she die?<eos> Childbirth...<eos> Uh, childbirth.<eos> She died in childbirth.<eos> Where's the baby?<eos> The baby, Parkman, where is it?
We know that there are expenses involved in providing additional security.<eos> We're willing to reimburse you.<eos> We can wire money for that or deliver it to you personally.<eos> You killed my son... in Beirut.<eos> I will fight you forever.<eos> No, please, please do not do this.<eos> I have asked you respectfully for safe passage.<eos> You are obliged to take my message to the council.<eos> I see you like to use potassium chlorate.<eos> I know it detonates more reliably than ammonium nitrate, but... the smell reminds me of freshly mopped hallways.
- Thing is, he's not just my cousin.<eos> - We don't need anyone to save us.<eos> I'm gonna save us.<eos> Friends, listen up.<eos> ♪ I've waited all my lifetime for one moment to arrive ♪<eos> ♪ The moment I was destined for at birth ♪<eos> ♪ The moment I would show the world ♪ ♪ the reason I'm alive ♪<eos> ♪ And prove to one and all what I am worth ♪<eos> ♪ And now that moment's here ♪<eos> ♪ It's calling loud and clear ♪
I know we've got a few things to settle before our big day.<eos> ~ Like my job.<eos> ~ Like your job.<eos> But I thought we could also talk about... settling on a date.<eos> So... maybe you could worry about that and leave the investigating to Miss Fisher.<eos> And maybe you can try that pie cart on your own.<eos> I've suddenly lost my appetite.<eos> Dot...<eos> Here's the cast of that boot print, Sir.<eos> It's a big one.
So... maybe you could worry about that and leave the investigating to Miss Fisher.<eos> And maybe you can try that pie cart on your own.<eos> I've suddenly lost my appetite.<eos> Dot...<eos> Here's the cast of that boot print, Sir.<eos> It's a big one.<eos> At least size 12.<eos> Possible match for a flying boot.<eos> In need of repair.<eos> If that's the print near the body, I doubt it belongs to James Manning.
I'd say that's a match.<eos> Both members of the same gang, both carrying knife wounds and scars.<eos> Jimmy was copping it worse.<eos> It isn't right to die so young.<eos> But it isn't right to live so violently either.<eos> Yes, I've got that number.<eos> I'll wait.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you recognise this, Paddy?<eos> Do you know who it belongs to?
No!<eos> Get off me!<eos> Get away!<eos> I'll tell them what you did, I'll tell them everything!<eos> Come back here!<eos> Quiet!<eos> Be quiet!<eos> I wasn't going to let him ruin everything, not after all the years I've spent on my work.<eos> You understand.<eos> This kind of surgery, it's revolutionary - donor skin, perhaps, one day, donor organs!
Harriet told you that Betsy was blackmailing her, and she'd arranged for Betsy to have access to the percussor the morning she died.<eos> So you arrived early for your appointment, unseen by anyone, as you'd done on many other mornings.<eos> And sabotaged the percussor after Harriet left it for Betsy.<eos> You can't prove that.<eos> We found half of your collar pin in Betsy's Cohen's bedroom the morning she died.<eos> Harriet found the rest of it.<eos> And as she became more suspicious of you, she drew closer to Dr Samuels.<eos> So you decided to retaliate by taking away something that your sister found precious... .. your gift to her.<eos> But when Harriet threatened to tell Dr Samuels everything... .. you decided to do something more permanent about it.<eos> You knew all about nux vomica and how lethal it was because it has been a key part of the Victoria Broadford case.
So, I've been paying Fred to rattle her chain.<eos> You know what they say - all's fair in love and tennis.<eos> Now, why don't I put on my bathing costume and you join me for a dip?<eos> Perhaps some other time.<eos> Oh, if you're going to disappoint me, Inspector, the least you can do is untie me.<eos> See?<eos> That wasn't so hard.<eos> Poor Dot!<eos> You mustn't worry about that photograph.<eos> It will blow over.
I had to make sure my deal with those God-fearing fellas didn't bite the dust.<eos> ~ You killed Belinda to keep her quiet?<eos> ~ No!<eos> I just paid the kid a lot of dough for the photo.<eos> ~ I want to see it.<eos> ~ Sure you do.<eos> If that tennis comp was more exciting, we wouldn't have had to amuse ourselves that day.<eos> ~ Where's the other one?<eos> ~ What other one?<eos> This is No.11. The 12th photo is missing too - where is it?
I thought I could save you.<eos> Constance Burrows, as a special constable of the Victorian Police Force, I am arresting you for the murder of Belinda Roswell.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> The photograph made me reflect on the stain on the bodice of your dress and the champagne you supposedly spilled, and the fever you've been combatting with sage tea - a remedy for threatening mastitis.<eos> You've given birth, haven't you, Constance?<eos> And quite recently too.<eos> Birth?<eos> Why would a woman who's obsessed with tennis take time off the game, or a newlywed arrange for her husband to be seduced by another woman?<eos> This baby, does that mean...<eos> Yes, Terence, it was yours.
Watch this.<eos> - They're radioactive?<eos> - Highly.<eos> At some point, a lethal dose of polonium has been added to them.<eos> - Polonium?<eos> - Is that like radium?<eos> Related.<eos> Polonium is extremely unstable and highly toxic if ingested.<eos> Our killer could have more of it.<eos> What form would it be in, Mac?
'Captain William Eugene Fisher.' It all makes sense.<eos> Eugene Fisher was my father's cousin.<eos> the previous Baron of Richmond-upon-Thames.<eos> He died in the early stages of the war.<eos> He was reported missing, presumed drowned.<eos> What's this?<eos> The prize money.<eos> What if my father's gone after it?<eos> How?<eos> It's in the safe at the Institute.
And then I read about slaves.<eos> The world is broken, Tom.<eos> Do you know there are more slaves now than ever?<eos> 21 million.<eos> And they make things we buy.<eos> Like, we directly fund it all the time.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> - Do you care?<eos> Yeah. I buy Fair Trade chocolate.<eos> Oh! I like that it tastes less like poor people's tears.
I think it's the acceptance of other people that she's looking for.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> All that your daughter seems to want is to walk down that aisle.<eos> Now, I think I might be able to make that happen.<eos> The question here is, does she have your support?<eos> Yeah, spasticity in the muscle.<eos> That's really typical after an injury like yours.<eos> How you get from that to putting botox in my leg, I'm not quite getting.<eos> Okay, so, your brain, despite its many wonderful qualities, is kind of misbehaving right now.<eos> It's sending signals to these muscles, and it's telling them to contract.
Grandma tripping.<eos> - In Bora Bora, mount pelini...<eos> - Mount pelini?<eos> That's not a real mountain.<eos> - I don't want it at...<eos> - How about there?<eos> There's a dormant volcano.<eos> I climbed it with this guy.<eos> This is pointless.<eos> How do you know it's dormant though?
I'm sorry. I was trying to help you.<eos> Oh, because I can't help myself?<eos> - That's not why I did it.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> I can't be in business with somebody who doesn't want to be in business with me.<eos> I can't have a partnership like that.<eos> Baby, I just went to Adam 'cause I knew how much the luncheonette means to you.<eos> That's why.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It doesn't mean anything to me now.
I can't say it again.<eos> I said it.<eos> I said everything I wanted to say.<eos> I said I love you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you, and I want you.<eos> I want you richer or poorer, better or worse, the whole wedding enchilada.<eos> It was high pressure, and it was emotional.<eos> May not have been the right place, but I meant it.<eos> I meant every word of it.<eos> There's the tomato.<eos> It's in your hands now, the tomato.
(touch tones sounding) Uh, no, nobody turned in any dicks. Sorry, buddy.<eos> Okay, uh, can-can you check the men's room, because I know I had it with me at the urinal?<eos> You're killing me, dude.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Thank you. (door opens over phone)<eos> All right, I'm in the men's room by the urinals here.<eos> Can't... Whoa!<eos> Uh... What happened?<eos> Uh, I-I slipped on your dick.<eos> Then it flew in the air.

- Yeah.<eos> They can find another... male.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And please don't write about this.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - On the blog, okay.<eos> - The blog is mostly for,<eos> - you know, civil rights stuff. It's not...
Governor, I can see you're angry.<eos> You led me to believe the night passed peaceably at the Nazarene's tomb, which I know now is far from the truth.<eos> Governor...<eos> Did you or did you not lie to me this morning?<eos> !<eos> I know how much you've been looking forward to traveling to Caesarea with your wife, and I believed I could resolve the situation without disrupting your plans.<eos> And have you?<eos> Action is under way.<eos> Meanwhile, this Jesus cult grows stronger by the hour.<eos> Soon, it will draw every crackpot and revolutionary into Jerusalem with the sole aim of challenging us all.
No, thanks.<eos> I'd like to survive for my happy ending.<eos> [ static crackles ] Man: That'll be $14.15.<eos> Please pull up to the window.<eos> And have a clucky cluck cluck day.<eos> Will you hurry up?

Well, I heard rumors.<eos> But I stay off of social media.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause you updated Zoey's cyberbullying page, 20 minutes ago, from your computer.<eos> Like a criminal who gloves up and files a serial number off a gun, you took every cyber precaution to hide yourself.<eos> But, like most criminals, you made a mistake-- using a burn phone to text Zoey's father.<eos> We traced the serial number from that phone right back to you.<eos> You can't prove any of what you're saying.<eos> Even I know that burner phones are untraceable.<eos> But what you don't know is that the first time you connect a phone with a computer, it logs that activity.
Upstairs.<eos> But he followed me.<eos> We struggled.<eos> And he pushed me.<eos> I...<eos> I fell off the balcony.<eos> When I saw him coming down the stairs, I knew it wasn't over.<eos> That's when you went for the gun?<eos> Tell me again where you got it.<eos> It must have belonged to a previous owner.
Earlier, you said you found the gun when you moved stuff into the basement.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> It's...<eos> It's hard to talk.<eos> Um...<eos> I meant I was moving stuff from the basement into the attic when I found it.<eos> It was under a floorboard.
You've worn one your entire life.<eos> I've taken mine off.<eos> Now it's your turn.<eos> You want to tell me where you've been the last few hours?<eos> No.<eos> Tell me she's okay.<eos> Captain.<eos> We got him.<eos> Gruner.<eos> We've been trying to ping his cell phone for hours, but suddenly it came back on.
- Looks like alien juice to me.<eos> - And you've seen alien juice before?<eos> Na. Nat exactly.<eos> But if I were ta take a guess at what it lacked like, I would say it would lack a lat like that.<eos> Could this day get any worse?<eos> - What the blazes is going an?<eos> - Alien.<eos> Big.<eos> Chasing us.<eos> It hates fund and likes melting brains.
Why?<eos> - Ah. Na reason.<eos> Aliens would laugh at this trap if they had a sense of humor.<eos> But they don't.<eos> Okay, for fun, let's say aliens are real.<eos> What do you think is gonna happen?<eos> Contact.<eos> A single alien from a race advanced light years beyond ours... "stealthily boards a human ship with ease.<eos> The alien makes contact.<eos> It seems hostile. But it's not after blood.

Shaggy, Scooby, I just spotted the alien in the observation deck.<eos> Head up there and lure him dawn to Hudson's work area.<eos> Daphne, Velma and I will cover the rest.<eos> It's almost tan easy.<eos> Any questions?<eos> - Uh, yeah, could we not do this?<eos> - Guys, relax.<eos> It's just an alien.<eos> It can't hurt you if it doesn't catch you.<eos> Yes, it can. It tried to melt our brains.
- Yes. - The alien.<eos> You caught the alien.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Does anyone have a spare hair dryer?<eos> I seem ta...<eos> The alien.<eos> You caught the alien.<eos> Yes. We caught it.<eos> Haw many elevators are in this building?<eos> - It is real.
A weekend in Paris with me?<eos> A signed portrait of me?<eos> You can't put a price an this sort of fame.<eos> Besides, returning as a hero will bring me all the money I could ever want.<eos> Please, don't hate me.<eos> Especially you, Daphne. Great hair.<eos> - We've gotta get out of here. - Haw?<eos> She just left an the only ship.<eos> Na, it's not the only ship.<eos> I gotta hand it ta you, it lacks just like Slystar One.
Especially you, Daphne. Great hair.<eos> - We've gotta get out of here. - Haw?<eos> She just left an the only ship.<eos> Na, it's not the only ship.<eos> I gotta hand it ta you, it lacks just like Slystar One.<eos> But something feels different, I just can't put my finger an it.<eos> You can't? Because I'd say that pretty much is the difference.<eos> - I can put my finger an it.<eos> - Oh, right.<eos> It's really small.
Yeah, but, as you can see, a woman's been injured.<eos> I need to see your operating licence.<eos> You've had this one for six years.<eos> That's a record.<eos> Why haven't they upgraded you?<eos> I don't want a crappy upgrade.<eos> ~ George...<eos> ~ Huh?<eos> This machine needs to be recycled, mate.<eos> It won't even power up.
After everything you've done for the people in this town, for me...<eos> Parker...<eos> You'll be with me every time I feel something.<eos> You'll be with me in all the people whose pain you've taken away.<eos> With me and all the people of this town who are free to live...<eos> And love... and grow... without fear.<eos> And the sun finally shines down on Haven again.<eos> You'll be with me and all the families that we put back together.<eos> And the ones out in the world who suffered with Troubles too.<eos> And you'll be with me when Haven returns to the world and becomes the town that we both know it can be.
You should have mug shots on your phones.<eos> There's multiple agencies. So, all communications will be on the common frequency.<eos> We've got air support covering the mountain from the back, but anyone gets a visual, call it in, and the choppers will maneuver to that area.<eos> All right.<eos> All right, gentlemen.<eos> That's it.<eos> Let's move it.<eos> Marshals?<eos> Something here you wanna see.<eos> Dog team on Ava tracked her scent to Tates Creek Bridge half a mile away, then it ran out.
There's a fence around the town.<eos> Know what that means?<eos> It's a quarantine.<eos> Dad, who cares?<eos> We're all gonna be dead soon enough anyway.<eos> No one under 22 years old has died.<eos> My client will make the final payment after the family receives possession of the baby.<eos> I said, get in the cell.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> And it's alive and kicking.
My uncle was the area's medical officer.<eos> I thought there might be records on his computer that point to a solution.<eos> And?<eos> I haven't found anything worth mentioning.<eos> Except that he had a hidden life as a cross-dresser.<eos> Seriously?<eos> No.<eos> But I did check.<eos> Honestly, I didn't even know that your family owned the grocery store, too.<eos> I figured it belonged to a chain or something.
Everywhere.<eos> My stomach.<eos> If you can't help me, then shoot me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Just breathe, breathe.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> It's his appendix.<eos> My guess, it's burst.
Because that's what I'm like.<eos> It's not weird to want your boyfriend to get down on one knee, and to meet your parents, and to get you a ring.<eos> I'll get you a ring, if that's what you want.<eos> I'll get you 10 rings.<eos> I'll get you 20 rings.<eos> - I don't care about the ring.<eos> - Look, I've done it.<eos> I've been married and it didn't go so well.<eos> It means... it just... marriage means nothing.<eos> It means something to me.
Really freakin' bad.<eos> You know what?<eos> You got some nerve, lady.<eos> How are you mad at me?<eos> I'm still mad at you.<eos> When you bailed, I thought I was gonna be the best man, but then guess who showed up.<eos> Dr. Reed.<eos> And he's doing the best man dance!<eos> And guess what.<eos> It's freaking beautiful.
I'm not on the payroll anymore.<eos> I-I'm wearing a different uniform.<eos> Maybe you didn't notice.<eos> - Yeah, this fire's different.<eos> - You want me to do your job?<eos> You told me once, whatever else we are, we're both cops.<eos> Now this is a chance for you to be a cop again.<eos> Mason Heady, Joan Tapford were both caught inside.<eos> This fire had no accelerant.<eos> It didn't move the way fires are supposed to, almost like it had a mind of its own.
That's what it looked like when he was woged.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> A not-so-public library.<eos> You think he's the accelerant himself?<eos> Could be.<eos> What if he's producing it, like, in his skin or glands?<eos> - Phosphorus.<eos> - Phosphorus, really?<eos> White phosphorus makes up 1% of the human body.<eos> It's in every cell, and it only needs 86 degrees before it ignites and burns like hell once it's exposed to oxygen, like... like a match.
It won't stop it.<eos> If he can produce phosphorus from his skin, you'll have to suppress it topically.<eos> Something that can be applied to his skin that won't evaporate in the heat.<eos> And we have to figure out a way to get it onto him.<eos> Got to be some kind of fire extinguisher.<eos> Yeah, good, and it's got to be sticky enough that he can't wipe it off, and it can't be flammable.<eos> Like a skin conditioner that won't burn.<eos> Yes.<eos> Let's start with licorice root.<eos> We boil it down, it gets very sticky when heated.
Mostly because I do not want to read this.<eos> - That's great!<eos> - Well,<eos> - Yay!<eos> - I'm the easy one, dawg.<eos> Seriously, it's the teachers you need to worry about.<eos> Especially you.<eos> You tend to care what people think about you.<eos> That's like saying a penguin "tends" to be cute.<eos> It's all it does, bro.
Meaning their work, their accomplishments?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - And yet, there's something about what Helen said that stayed with you, that... that makes you think she might be on to something.<eos> I just think there are so many different matrices by which to measure a man's worth, and I... I don't know which is right.<eos> I'm writing a whole book about this question.<eos> At least, I'm trying to.<eos> - Your new novel?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You haven't talked about that much in here.<eos> Except to say that it's very different.
Hadn't thought about it.<eos> Look, I love Russ, but sometimes it's nice to be able to work on my own.<eos> Without him second-guessing your every thought?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Neither did I.<eos> Who is she?<eos> You either pissed off a terrorist or you pissed off a woman.<eos> And given the fact you haven't investigated a terrorism case since you got to Battle Creek, but you have had 12 crazy-hot assistants, I can only assume that...<eos> Our suspect is neither a terrorist nor a woman.<eos> - Just tell me who it is.
Where she'd ingest two tabs of ecstasy And then ask the audience to take care of her.<eos> You just described burning man.<eos> [ laughs ] She framed it as a commentary On social attitudes regarding female mental illness.<eos> What, like that's a bad thing?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Any luck with lucy harms?<eos> Yeah. She's totally guilty.<eos> Or murder or simply annoying you?<eos> Did you find the victim's assistant?<eos> Between the arts center and his loft. We pinged his phone. It's still in the area.
It's the time of death that's a little off.<eos> What do you mean, a little off?<eos> According to Dave, it was around midnight, but according to Doc, it was much earlier.<eos> Maybe as much as 18 hours earlier.<eos> Whoa. Which means our other superhero, Scott Hunt, he doesn't work as the killer. He alibis out.<eos> So he was telling the truth when he said he got to the yard and Agrerro was already dead.<eos> How could David have been so far off with his estimate?<eos> I don't think it was his fault.<eos> It was that truck engine.<eos> It really was running.
Right. But it's there.<eos> I knew it was there.<eos> Excellent work, Dr. Grey.<eos> Edwards.<eos> Scrub in.<eos> Okay.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> I don't have a phone.<eos> Give me your phone!<eos> It's not mine. It's Dylan's.
They used the original tissue to make a son.<eos> We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need.<eos> Did he ever mention a son?<eos> He did, didn't he?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> This is where Henrik and Bonnie lived just after they were married.<eos> And their son lives here now?<eos> You're gonna have to pull around back.<eos> The kid's dead?<eos> Johanssen said that he and Bonnie had had a child before Gracie, but it didn't survive.
I'm not leaving without the coat.<eos> I'm keeping the coat.<eos> I'm keeping it.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Drop the coat, mother(bleep)!<eos> Drop the (bleep) coat!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> The pistol doesn't shoot, honey.<eos> It's a 1782 Ketland flintlock.<eos> It's priceless 'cause my father gave it to me, but it will not shoot.
We need to find everyone who's carrying this malware on their device.<eos> Krumitz, I need you to clear all the passengers from this area.<eos> Nelson, start removing all the malicious script from everyone's phone.<eos> We need to shut this down now.<eos> FBI!<eos> Everyone unplug.<eos> What? Hey.<eos> My phone is dead.<eos> Hey, don't unplug my phone.<eos> It's dead.
Everyone unplug.<eos> What? Hey.<eos> My phone is dead.<eos> Hey, don't unplug my phone.<eos> It's dead.<eos> Tell me something, sir.<eos> Have you ever heard of juice jacking?<eos> No, and I don't care to.<eos> You see this cord?<eos> It charges your phone, right?
Hey, don't unplug my phone.<eos> It's dead.<eos> Tell me something, sir.<eos> Have you ever heard of juice jacking?<eos> No, and I don't care to.<eos> You see this cord?<eos> It charges your phone, right?<eos> Nice.<eos> Safe.<eos> You think it's your friend.
She plays soccer, dance lessons, violin...<eos> Yeah... and she also took first place in the Miami-Dade County high school chess tournament.<eos> We get it-- she's a genius and you're a proud father.<eos> This is insane.<eos> All right, Willa's not a hacker.<eos> And she's a good kid.<eos> Maybe she is.<eos> But maybe she's not.<eos> I have a warrant for her tablet.<eos> If it's clean, she's innocent.
You give partial ownership of your company to your fucking grad students, you're gonna get fucked.<eos> Wait, wait, wait-- I thought the goal here was an amicable partnership.<eos> If Maya and Ellis get along, it makes our lives that much easier going forward.<eos> Jeannie, we tried getting these...<eos> Bullshit we tried.<eos> They haven't even talked.<eos> O-Okay. So, after everything that's gone on between the two of them, you think getting them talking, that's what's gonna help things?<eos> No, probably better to take the same slash and burn, scorched earth approach you take with everything else in your life.<eos> Cal is a contingency plan.<eos> And it's a good one to have in place.
Oh, you don't have that kind of scratch.<eos> CLYDE: Oh... I have a reputation.<eos> Well... we gave it a shot, right?<eos> We came here hoping this would work out.<eos> Well, appreciate your time.<eos> Whoa! Whoa, what's that, hmm?<eos> That-that's for my blog.<eos> Fat Fucks Making Backroom Deals with Ex-con Businessmen dot-edu.<eos> Edu-- it's an educational Web site.<eos> It's a place where you go to learn stuff.
- Squad 3.<eos> - Cool shark.<eos> Ambulance 61.<eos> Structure fire.<eos> Oh, brother.<eos> Storage units are the pits.<eos> Because of all the locks?<eos> Yep, you got to bust into each unit, and worse, you got no idea what you're gonna find behind each door.<eos> There's smoke up on the second floor.<eos> I have no clue where it's coming from.
We need a human soldier who can move freely in the daylight.<eos> Someone who can use the power of the sun.<eos> You have proven yourself capable.<eos> I'm listening.<eos> Here we go.<eos> What are you doing there, pal?<eos> Hands above your head!<eos> What you got in the sack, buddy?<eos> What you got there, huh?<eos> It's full of dirt.
You've been eating the worms?<eos> Well, you can't ingest them orally.<eos> I discovered I needed to, uh, absorb them in solution through the eyes.<eos> Did you ever see this number on my arm?<eos> Did it not make you wonder about my age?<eos> I was a prisoner in a German death camp in 1944.<eos> I'm 94 years old.<eos> I need this to keep living.<eos> I've made my choice.<eos> It may be wicked, it may mean I go to a fiery and horrible place when I die, but it's too late to stop now.
You should hang out.<eos> You know what? Take her to Alcatraz.<eos> Oh, i would love that.<eos> What is that? It's the world's most famous marriage.<eos> I mean prison.<eos> [Light chuckle]<eos> I always say, if she'd just stuck with the writing-- with what time?<eos> With you working all hours in the lab, who's gonna take care of our home?<eos> [Whispering] We have no children.<eos> We have a rabbit, and that's harder because it can't tell you what it wants.
I don't like being scared.<eos> I know. I know.<eos> But, you know, when I was little,<eos> I was afraid of the dark. - You were? - I was.<eos> But grandpop, he...<eos> He taught me something.<eos> You know that... you know that song, "twinkle twinkle"?<eos> You remember?<eos> Well, it used to be a poem. And he said that when I felt scared,<eos> I should say the poem out loud, because it worked like magic and all my fears would disappear. I want to learn it.
Funny way of showing your admiration, showing up at his house with a gun.<eos> That was a misunderstanding two years ago.<eos> I went over to his house to talk to him.<eos> I had my gun on me.<eos> I practice my second amendment rights.<eos> I would never hurt John.<eos> Where were you last night?<eos> Home, editing.<eos> I have a crime blog.<eos> It takes up all my time.
Beth, it's good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> I want to introduce you to Detective Jack Larsen.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Pleasure.<eos> So I heard you received a gift this morning.<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, forensics has it.<eos> It arrived by courier to the mail room, no return address.<eos> That's the box that it came in.
Their paths must have crossed.<eos> What happened to Alice's mom?<eos> She left abruptly in '93, moved to Orange County.<eos> Alice was born in '94, and get this.<eos> When I spoke to Alice, she claims she and the mayor never had sex, just talked.<eos> How long had Alice been seeing the mayor?<eos> Only a few weeks.<eos> So it began right after the mother died.<eos> Which means that the mayor did have an affair, only it wasn't with Alice.<eos> It was with her mother.
So, he goes outside, gets the duffel bag and brings it inside?<eos> That's leading, Sheriff.<eos> Well, you tell me, then.<eos> He goes outside and gets the duffel bag and brings it inside.<eos> Okay. Then what?<eos> He goes to George's bedroom for a while.<eos> And that's where you found the wallet?<eos> The next morning, yes.<eos> Did you see him with the phone, or see him place it somewhere?<eos> No. It was just on the coffee table when I woke up.

I know you're not coming home.<eos> And it's...<eos> That certainty...<eos> I'm just saying, I think...<eos> I think I liked it better the first way.<eos> Winona, are you saying...<eos> What I'm saying is...<eos> God damn it.<eos> I'm saying I love you and I miss you and I want you to come home, and I don't care where home is.<eos> I don't care if it's here or in Miami or in the hills.
But eventually, the both of you are gonna have to come to grips - with the reality.<eos> - And in your version of reality?<eos> Your marshal and his girlfriend have stolen $10 million right out from under our noses.<eos> Givens.<eos> I'm about to get on a helicopter.<eos> I need you back in Lexington now.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, I ain't kidding about the helicopter.<eos> It's hovering above my head.
"No way!" What is it?<eos> You're shaking.<eos> You'll get tired of me.<eos> - I know your reputation.<eos> - I won't.<eos> I will never, ever get tired of you.<eos> That's easy to say.<eos> How will you prove it?<eos> I'll take you to the house I inherited from my mother.<eos> It's a small house. You'll like it.
I was out for a ride, like every day.<eos> I got down from the horse.<eos> She's was dying from an overdose.<eos> She was lying on her back... with her red hair all around her face.<eos> It was like contemplating my own death.<eos> Missing Person<eos> And then, tilt.<eos> I decided to disappear and make it look like a suicide.<eos> After a month in the water, a body's unrecognizable.<eos> Aurélien knew I suffered from depression. He thought it was me.
Thank you.<eos> Since we're talking bribes...<eos> What you saw on the street?<eos> It's in everyone's best interest if the Company doesn't hear about the weapons.<eos> Yeah, well, lucky for you, unless there's a warrant involved, I don't give a shit about you, The Company or your doomed- to-fail resistance.<eos> So you'll keep your mouth shut?<eos> If you put enough beer in it.<eos> John, it feels... wet.<eos> We're flooding your hypothalamus with hydrogel;<eos> it mimics cerebrospinal fluid almost flawlessly.
Close enough.<eos> There you go.<eos> After those men attacked you, your friends tried the sweat?<eos> To call you back?<eos> Did it work?<eos> I wanted it to.<eos> Sometimes it takes more.<eos> My great-grandmother watched white soldiers massacre her entire family.<eos> She was raped.<eos> She passed this skull down as her medicine because it's the truth.
Take his statement.<eos> Hey! I'm hungry!<eos> Yeah, we all have problems.<eos> Henry, what's so important, it can't wait?<eos> My truck has been stolen.<eos> When?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I have not used it since the night before last.<eos> So sometime in the last 36 hours.<eos> I hate to say it, but I think the person that took your truck did it because it's yours and they didn't think you'd call me.
And everybody else always thought that there was something going on between us.<eos> You know, it's not like you actually encouraged me to stay married.<eos> And then, you think that Eamonn is flirting with me, so you push him away, and then all of a sudden you start dating the psychiatrist, and you want to hire Eamonn?<eos> Why?<eos> Feel guilty?<eos> Please don't walk away from me.<eos> I'm not walking away from you.<eos> I'm walking away from that truck.<eos> It's a Chevy.<eos> It's not Henry's.
But you don't say no, the scratch is too good.<eos> The life... Mmm, the women.<eos> There was this girl I had my eye on, Eliza Marquette.<eos> I was this close to nailing her.<eos> Frosty, but I loved it.<eos> She was taking heat for a bad leak, and then poof... Disappeared.<eos> I know all about Eliza Marquette.<eos> She was protecting the memo.<eos> You need to get your hands on it.<eos> It'll bring Max Rager to its knees.

- Beep. Gotta do something.<eos> - Beep. - I'm hooked up to... - there's tubes.<eos> - Beep, boop. My doctor's right here if you want to talk to him.<eos> Good, hello?<eos> Hello, hello, this is Dr. Rotreiller, MD.<eos> Are you a specialist?<eos> I'm more of a general jack-of-all-trades style doctor.<eos> What's going on with the tapeworm?<eos> Is it still in her... butt?<eos> It's still in her anus.
But why send a hired gun like Mathis after a telenovela star?<eos> Let's find Mathis and ask him about Ana's murder.<eos> Put out an APB and alert TSA and Homeland Security.<eos> If he's still in town, a guy like this won't be easy to find.<eos> But we'll dig in, hopefully make some headway by the morning.<eos> Got it.<eos> (KNOCK ON DOOR) So, the lonely PI burning the midnight oil, huh?<eos> Who knew finding a purse could be this exhausting?<eos> So, did you figure out where the white limo took Ana?<eos> I can't even figure out whose limo it was.
I already know.<eos> I'm the one calling the meeting.<eos> - What up, yo?<eos> - Who is this other number?<eos> It's a group text.<eos> I'm texting you and Jeffrey.<eos> It's me.<eos> I am Jeffrey, best friend of Dean.<eos> Hi, Jeffrey.<eos> Hm. Dean, that number is not in my phone as Jeff's, and it doesn't even look like an American phone number.
No worries, Dean.<eos> I love you.<eos> You're always so sweet, when we're texting, but then in real life.<eos> Bro, I just secret that way with love.<eos> You know, my style.<eos> We keep loving in text, but then secret forever.<eos> Meow.<eos> Oh, hm. Meow.<eos> Annie, if you're not dying, I'm gonna murder you.<eos> I had to remove my night cream, it's $200 an ounce.
I see a few familiar faces here.<eos> A few new ones, as well.<eos> No, just gonna keep the cop you've known for five years at arms length?<eos> I get it.<eos> What have you boys been able to figure out?<eos> Don't call us boys.<eos> And it's a unique case, because it's hard to decide what laws are being broken.<eos> Unless you count the lunch lady's sex life.<eos> Thanks, thanks a lot.<eos> Anyway, our city does have a cyber-crime division, but it's well, it's pretty new.
I mean is that the correct moniker?<eos> Boyfriend.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is, well that's, whoa, this is very exciting.<eos> Boy you could just bowl me over with one of those sweet heart, you know what are the, you remember at the Johnson's cabin, we.<eos> Feathers.<eos> You could blow me over with a feather.<eos> Well, you have a lovely home.<eos> I love this carpet.<eos> Oh. It reminds me of the quality floor mats in my Honda CR-V.
You're not saying no.<eos> I mean, legally, I can't force you.<eos> But, I can do a morning announcement that will make everyone hate you forever.<eos> Technically, Abed, you would be robbing the school for half a million dollars by not making this movie.<eos> But, what movie?<eos> Have you not been listening?<eos> The movie about the Ham Girl guy, in his space office fighting some Gagoos, led by Chris Pratt type, played by Jeffrey without his shirt.<eos> Hm. It shoots this weekend.<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah? Okay, but I get final cut, and it has to be a good movie.<eos> Agreed, but you have to finish that cut by Monday, even if it's bad.

Leave me alone, Abed.<eos> Once I've watched this tutorial on how editing works, I'm gonna save this movie without removing its soul.<eos> Step one.<eos> How to correctly label your files.<eos> Nobody cares about labeling files, teach me to edit.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You stay away!<eos> This is my movie too!<eos> It's not even a movie Jeff, it's a piece of crap.<eos> That doesn't mean it can't be good.
You're literally killing me.<eos> For real? Yes!<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Every single one of you was gonna leave here except for me.<eos> Troy, Shirley, Annie's gonna be President.<eos> Even Pierce got to die.<eos> And Chang goes to Hollywood.<eos> So, we force you to make the crappiest movie of all time, and then we force you to make it even crappier.<eos> And we watch it, and it's still not even that bad.
I watch Parks and Rec.<eos> I watched it. There's no scientific explanation for...<eos> Hm, Jeff.<eos> You helped me learn something about film making today that I think we all need to apply to life.<eos> It's okay to plan some stuff, and it's okay to figure out what we did wrong.<eos> But our plans are randomly gonna fall apart and our lessons are randomly gonna be wrong, and if we just keep the cameras rolling and shoot a lot of crap eventually<eos> Annie is going to reach down her shirt and pull out a laser bomb.<eos> I didn't write that, we didn't plan that.<eos> God made that happen.<eos> God made this movie, and it's dumb.
All of this weight.<eos> I may have miscalculated the mileage.<eos> Darn it, I wanna hijack this RV, but I'm foiled by its impenetrable post-2001 security measures.<eos> You keep driving and nobody else needs to know about this, understand?<eos> The last thing we need is a panic.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Are we out of gas?<eos> Yes!<eos> It's on empty!<eos> It's on empty!
And Jeff can explain that choice.<eos> No, it's your RV.<eos> This was my show.<eos> You didn't give a damn about that.<eos> Abed, we're all on your side, so if you're also on your side, it's petty.<eos> We could wait for a couple of hours and hope that the engine battery resets itself.<eos> If it doesn't, then we're spending the night here, and at least we have the secondary battery to keep us warm for a few hours.<eos> No, no, no, we're not spending the night here, so what's the second option?<eos> Which I am nicknaming little course of action.<eos> I rewire the secondary battery to the engine and hope it can start it.
Is your Internet not working?<eos> It's one photo.<eos> It's taking an hour.<eos> You have keystrokes programmed to, eesh, that's dorky.<eos> Looks like we'll be renting formal wear.<eos> I'll measure Jeffrey.<eos> Mister Winger, you clean up nice.<eos> Oh, come on. I'm always good looking.<eos> This seems ambitious.<eos> Well, the monorail is more symbolic of our potential than it is potential, and none of our buildings will ever be shaped like this.
That one has a hidden entrance.<eos> Look for an alley straight ahead.<eos> The A/C grate on the north side by the telephone poles, enter there.<eos> It accesses a lower level you can't get to from the main floor.<eos> I'm playing that level now.<eos> Calvin's got to be hiding in there.<eos> Look alive.<eos> All right, we're heading in.<eos> Did you find hallway PW-99?<eos> Yeah, it's where you said it would be.
So, we'll each take a quadrant.<eos> Okay, as president, I get first choice.<eos> No, I'll take the first choice.<eos> - But, Melissa...<eos> - Where was that bar you showed me?<eos> - Phil?<eos> Where's the bar? - Mm-hmm?<eos> Uh... the bar.<eos> Oh, geez, uh, yeah.<eos> It's right, uh, right there.
There was an attempt on Clinton no one knows about?<eos> Actually, 28 people know.<eos> Now, 33.<eos> During the melee, Clinton was whisked off, a Kosovan guard was killed and a Secret Service agent, Bruce Jones, who was carrying the football, was shot in the chest.<eos> And then it went missing?<eos> Not good.<eos> What's "the football"?<eos> It's a briefcase that follows POTUS everywhere.<eos> It's cuffed to the Secret Service.<eos> It has the locations of our hidden silos around the world and a detonator the president can use to activate a remote launch.
All right, the fence is electrified.<eos> We can't climb it.<eos> Happy, where's the nearest junction box?<eos> It's on the other side of the yard.<eos> I'll never get there in time.<eos> It's a quarter mile down and around the fence. Normally, it would take less than two minutes to get down there, but due to the speed of the train, we only have 45 seconds, Walter!<eos> I've got an idea!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> There's no way that magnet's strong enough to stop that train!<eos> And that case is aluminum, it's not magnetic!
JT and Alton are cured.<eos> Who would've thought Liam wanted them?<eos> I would've. If I hadn't been so hell-bent on putting this all behind us.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> Unless we're already in too deep and we can't get out.<eos> Or unless we really are a part of something bigger.<eos> Okay, call Vincent again.<eos> Where the hell is he?<eos> Wait, why do you have a vault in your home again?<eos> It came with the place.
Love you, see you later.<eos> - See ya, bye!<eos> - Ah, China!<eos> *And I love to live alone*<eos> Passport.<eos> Gabi.<eos> Gabi!<eos> Gabi!<eos> Your passport.<eos> Yeah, it's right here in my hand.
Can you just... just tell my dad that I'm not...<eos> You can tell him yourself.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm too tired.<eos> No, I need you, Sam.<eos> Where's your allergy pen?<eos> My what?<eos> You're allergic to peanuts.<eos> Your allergy pen.<eos> I know it's on you. Where is it?
And I have two patients... you and your baby.<eos> You stressed yourself all day against my orders.<eos> I'd like to do a biometrical scan.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay. So finish up.<eos> See you in 10.<eos> Okay.<eos> So, we tracked down an ethanol drip from St. Mo's.<eos> That's good news.<eos> But it's coming by ambulance, and it's gonna take about 20 minutes to get here, so in the meantime, I need you to drink some vodka.
Who's that guy with Johnny?<eos> I don't know where he came from.<eos> Just washed up here this morning.<eos> Washed up from where?<eos> No idea.<eos> You know, he's got a funny accent, but... I don't think it's Russian.
Had to figure that, right?<eos> It doesn't mean anything, ma'am.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Nervous.<eos> You?<eos> Terrified.<eos> We have labs, we have scientists, and we have you.<eos> We get this right, with our ship covering the south and everybody spreading not just the cure but the knowledge of how to make it, we can turn the tide, not just here, but in Europe... and then the world.<eos> We've all waited a long time for this day to come.<eos> It's here.
It's an honor to accede to the King's wishes although I fear my resources are not sufficient to maintain myself in the style to which he is accustomed.<eos> The King has extended to all nobles a financial inducement.<eos> Those who wish to build a house at the periphery of the grounds will be forgiven all outstanding debts.<eos> Then I shall begin my planning at once.<eos> In the meantime, we'll do our best to make you comfortable within the palace.<eos> Ah.<eos> Cassel.<eos> The black sheep returns.<eos> I'm so sorry to hear about your castle.<eos> - I understand it burnt down.
I just realized we have a choice.<eos> We don't have to do as he tells us.<eos> We have been cowards.<eos> We are free to leave.<eos> It merely requires the courage for us to resist him.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> To come with me, or to remain here?<eos> Waiting for his knock at your door.<eos> I don't care if the baby is mine, or his, it will be ours.
Philadelphia City Hall.<eos> The largest in the world.<eos> Houses the mayor, the City Council, Courts.<eos> One public entrance, which we definitely don't want to go through.<eos> Employee and service entrances aren't much better.<eos> Card readers, security cameras everywhere.<eos> Well, how do we get in there without being caught on tape?<eos> Across the street from City Hall: The largest Freemasons temple in the U.S.<eos> City Hall was designed and built by the Masons, and apparently they built a secret tunnel that connects it to their temple.<eos> - How do we it's really there?
- That's brave.<eos> So you on vacation?<eos> Yeah, I... haven't been home for a while, so you know.<eos> How's Bridget and Cooper?<eos> Conor.<eos> Conor!<eos> Sorry.<eos> They're fine.<eos> Hey, you do your paper?<eos> It's not due till four.
- Is it decaf?<eos> - Of course.<eos> All right, just put it over there.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Won't you be chilly in those things?<eos> Uh, it's going to be 90 today.<eos> Well, it's not now.<eos> All of these need letters of rejection.<eos> Just use the template my last assistant put together.<eos> It's somewhere on the laptop.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Someone named Scotty Lockhart called us.<eos> Sorry, I'm Abigail.<eos> These are my colleagues.<eos> We're here<eos> - from Marla Bay Real Estate. - Uh-huh.<eos> It's just that someone named Scotty Lockhart told us he owned this house, and he asked us to let him know what we thought we could put it on the market for.<eos> Scotty's my brother.<eos> This is my place.<eos> It's not for sale.
The chair, the lamp, I got this whole crib.<eos> Look.<eos> Look how cute that is, and this thing.<eos> Oh, that's cute.<eos> - It's so cute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And then we have the changing table.<eos> Isn't that beautiful?<eos> Wow, what did you do with my desk?<eos> Well, it's in the hall.
I think he may have even read the whole thing.<eos> So he wants to be in business.<eos> You two just have to hit it off.<eos> Got it.<eos> And if George commits, phew, this movie will get made.<eos> George Clooney's really gonna come out in this weather?<eos> He said he's coming out for one reason only, Noah.<eos> To meet you.<eos> Shit, there goes my phone.<eos> Where the fuck is it?

- Five years.<eos> Five years?<eos> - Do you get time for research? - I spend a lot of time on it.<eos> What's your subject?<eos> Developmental language.<eos> The dynamics are interesting.<eos> Words like ciabatta were unknown some years back.<eos> But French bread...<eos> Rather than talk about bread, look for that essay.<eos> Yes, it must be here somewhere.
And very quickly, we got lucky.<eos> On the right, what's that?<eos> You know what, I... I don't fancy it.<eos> No matter though, because further down the road I came across a fresh and tasty possum.<eos> But then...<eos> James don't ran over it you stupid...!<eos> You blithering idiot, you just ran over it.<eos> That's not edible now, is it?<eos> For flattening our supper, James was punished.<eos> Eventually, we did find fresh meat, but it was a bit too fresh.
It's okay take your time.<eos> Take all the time you need, you're doing great.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Good.<eos> Okay. Use your words.<eos> Where exactly is Meredith?<eos> Hmm.<eos> The leak in the heart is coming from the right atrium. Are you gonna put her on bypass?<eos> 'Cause that could compromise the baby.<eos> No, I can fix her heart while it's still beating. Push 40 milligrams of esmolol.
I think I trust her about as far as I can trust a Stegosaurus.<eos> Ok, then the consequences of doing nothing could be a massacre.<eos> I don't know how you would explain that to the Tourist Board.<eos> - Here?<eos> - Do exactly as I say... and this doesn't have to be a disaster.<eos> In there?<eos> Yeah, in there.<eos> Connor...<eos> There's no trace of magnetic field.<eos> The doors are too thick, it can't penetrate the metal.
What are we doing?<eos> The battle to be mayor took a dramatic turn tonight when Bremer accused one of Hartmann's role models of involvement in a murder case.<eos> Aren't some of your role models criminals?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> That's just...<eos> - One is involved in a murder case.<eos> Which murder case?<eos> We have no comment.<eos> - A concrete case?<eos> - Yes it is.
I love Susan, and I won't ask her to do this.<eos> Oh, hello!<eos> Mother's fine.<eos> I found her a sweater.<eos> - Oh. So what won't you ask me?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I was wondering if you'd object to signing a document that says, should you and Ian part ways, you'll accept a cash settlement and not go after the money he inherits from us.<eos> - You mean a pre-nup?<eos> - Please, try to understand, our country estate has been in our family for generations.<eos> We want it preserved for the children we hope Ian will have, not lost in some pricey divorce.
You are going to spend all your youth reading books?<eos> What a waste.<eos> Have you ever gone to a cyber cafe?<eos> Why?<eos> I have a computer at home.<eos> Beam exercise? Or go to the beach or the mountains?<eos> You could go with somebody.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Look around you.<eos> You can search all over for the treasure ... but maybe it is right next to you.
Yeah,I got it.<eos> Give me a 10-blade. 10-blade quickly,please.<eos> O'malley,get over here.<eos> okay,scissors.<eos> Massage her heart,o'malley.<eos> I need to aspirate.<eos> any air return?<eos> 10 cc'S.<eos> end-tidal c0-2 is going back up.<eos> the heart's starting to beat on its own. Pressure's 60 over 40. It's low,but it's there.
- Wait!<eos> There really is, I promise you, there really is a third dimension.<eos> - That's absurd.<eos> - He's stalling.<eos> - No, no.<eos> - Freak<eos> - I... I can prove it.<eos> - You can't!<eos> It's.. it's elsewhere.<eos> It's.. all around us.
Apparently, that strategy had never occurred to him.<eos> That poor girl must've been so confused.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, at least Barney learned a valuable lesson.<eos> You do not want to get scissor kicked in the groin by a Rockette.<eos> So, uh, I guess we should get you unpacked.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I guess we should.<eos> Lily... deep within the Amazonian rainforest, there is a type of tree that only grows around the body of an existing tree.<eos> It cannot survive without this tree.
I hope you can get over you.<eos> Quiet!<eos> A man was destroyed!<eos> Now, you know what? I'm gonna you to help me, okay?<eos> I don't know how these are gonna affect me and you know, I don't really believe in taking sleep aids.<eos> - You don't believe in taking sleep aids?<eos> - Right.<eos> Wine?<eos> That's different.<eos> It's from the Earth, natural.

Her blood vessels are taking this thing everywhere.<eos> She needs total body radiation.<eos> We can't do anything until we can confirm...<eos> Running those immuno-chemistries could take a week.<eos> She'll be dead by the time.<eos> That doesn't make radiation any safer.<eos> Okay, suppose Chase and Cameron are right.<eos> Suppose it's an autoimmune disease.<eos> What's the biggest danger of total body radiation?<eos> It suppresses the immune system, which is what we're trying to do with the steroids anyway.
What she doesn't need is a doctor who's not there with her because he made the wrong call.<eos> You are freaking out.<eos> You should be freaking out.<eos> I won't let her see it.<eos> Let her see it.<eos> Hey.<eos> How come no mask?<eos> We think... you have an infection.<eos> Didn't the radiation work?<eos> It didn't do what it was supposed to do.
Leave him.<eos> What do you propose?<eos> Ablution.<eos> a humble sign of friendship from a stranger who's come into your house.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Just half a man down here.<eos> What's your name, norteño?<eos> You can just call me "friend. "<eos> Go for the kneecap.<eos> you hit it straight on, it'll buckle, and you'll take the guy out of commission.
Jeez, another one.<eos> Guinness World Records America.<eos> Yes, hello.<eos> My name is Randy Marsh and I believe I took the world's biggest crap.<eos> You need to call the European Fecal Standards and Measurements Office in Zurich. Their number is listed on their website.<eos> Herr President, take a look at this.<eos> It is a crap sent to us from the United States.<eos> Very nice.<eos> Has it been checked for accuracy?<eos> It appears to be legitimate, based on the photo.
This design is beautiful. It suits you.
Such a genius for war...<eos> - No, that's not what humanity means.<eos> - I think it does!<eos> At heart, this species is so very Dalek.<eos> All right, so what have you achieved, then, with this Final Experiment, eh? Nothing!<eos> 'Cause I can show you what you're missing with this thing.<eos> A simple, little radio.<eos> What is the purpose of that device?<eos> Well, exactly.<eos> It plays music.
Did you pick a cake?<eos> Uh... I like the red one.<eos> The red velvet?<eos> That's the girl?<eos> Runny nose guy's big love.<eos> I don't know how we do this. I don't know how we work together and be friends and act like it's all okay.<eos> I, um...<eos> There's a spot available at Mercy West. I called them.<eos> You're gonna transfer to Mercy West?<eos> I have to. Desire leaves us heartbroken... It wears us out.
- l'll be lucky if I hit 30.<eos> - Don't say that, Li.<eos> The ring has to stay in the family, Charlie.<eos> So please, take it.<eos> Mum would've wanted it this way.<eos> Pass it on to your little one someday.<eos> I need to know it's safe.<eos> I'll hold on to it.<eos> But I won't take it.<eos> Hey, it fits.
Yes.<eos> Hunchback. Yes, Madame.<eos> If Mr. Governor asks for me, tell him I'm going to see Mrs. Hoi.<eos> Understood? Yes, Madame.<eos> Darling, what took you so long?<eos> I've been waiting for hours.<eos> I had to wait for Madame to leave before I could come over.<eos> Look here.<eos> This white silk dress is somehow linked closely to my life.<eos> I don't know where it came from.
Your mom didn't have anything to eat but corn when she was pregnant with you.<eos> Your father named you Corn.<eos> That's why you,re so stupid! Stupid! Stupid!<eos> How dare you call me stupid!<eos> How dare you!<eos> You dare call me stupid!<eos> What's the matter, Corn?<eos> I...<eos> I spilled ink on our white silk dress.<eos> Look, it's stained.
- Why do I wanna...!<eos> Sis, I absolutely...!<eos> What? - S Stop!<eos> I'll get dirty!<eos> - Shut up! There's dog poop over there!<eos> Hope it sticks to you!<eos> What's the meaning of this?<eos> What?<eos> Another Hollow?<eos> It got in my mouth!
Is the sun setting?<eos> Yes.<eos> Concentrate.<eos> Slash the sun as it sinks beyond the mountain.
They are made from wood and felt.<eos> With apparent stitches.<eos> Their delicate and finished appearance is friendly.<eos> And they are quiet.<eos> Stephanie made them, and I will expose them in an exhibition.<eos> Stephanie, do you think I could take the red blanket as well?<eos> Of course, Stephane.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> There's this amazing blanket.<eos> It's thick, red felt with big white stitches.
I'm on my own.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Dude, you heard that guy.<eos> He's gonna shoot us.<eos> Let's bail.<eos> No.<eos> We're too close.<eos> That pick is in one of these rooms... and we're not leavin' here without it.<eos> Dude, look at this place.<eos> It's huge.
Well, you gonna be glad you waited, baby.<eos> Thank you very much, young man.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Goddamn, shit's changed in a year.<eos> What are we doin' here?<eos> Okay, sir, we're engaged in procuring your tattoo.<eos> Welcome to the Identity Processing Program of America.<eos> Please insert your forearm into the forearm receptacle.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Please speak your name as it appears on your current federal identity card-
- Good morning, Mr. Newman.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Newman.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Newman.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Newman.<eos> - Good morning, Mr. Newman.<eos> - Man, Alice I was stuck in traffic for an hour and a half.<eos> When's the meeting?<eos> - It started already.
United you fall, divided you'll stand.<eos> The Divided States of America are being made and the civil War is being foretold.<eos> I've lived in this country for 58 years.<eos> I was here when Europeans arrived, and I'm happy to say that, so far, I've been able to look at distinctions to be made between what folks where I'm from consider "free-dom",<eos> and what is the national norm or ideas about freedom, ideas about liberty.<eos> I've never been free, I don't know this idea in relationship to what the country says it means or should mean for me.<eos> Well, it's a different situation, because now that I understand more about Laibach, particularly from watching the documentary just now, I see that they, and yourself, seem to be coming, in my impression, you seem to be growing out of a certain kind of cultural oppression that is foreign to me as an American.<eos> I won't say that I don't understand it, but I haven't lived under similar circumstances that make that particularly relevant in the same way.<eos> I think maybe now, given the political situation here among the majority of Americans, we're starting to get a sense of a similar kind of pressure.<eos> Although, it seems to be more subtle, it's not so outright, you know.
Just needs a coat of paint and a bit of a scrub.<eos> Okay, you sure?<eos> - No problem at all, Charlie.<eos> - Good.<eos> Charlie?<eos> - Charlie, can you hear me? - Yes.<eos> - Can you hear me now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look, I wasn't joking before about what I said about the wine they make here.<eos> It is not, I repeat, not first-class.
- No problem at all, Charlie.<eos> - Good.<eos> Charlie?<eos> - Charlie, can you hear me? - Yes.<eos> - Can you hear me now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Look, I wasn't joking before about what I said about the wine they make here.<eos> It is not, I repeat, not first-class.<eos> - Will that affect our price?<eos> - How bad can it be?
Perhaps he'll inspire you to find devotion in what you do for a living one day.<eos> I wanna be a professional poker player when I'm older.<eos> Or a comedian.<eos> Max-a-million, ask me what is the most important thing in comedy.<eos> What is the most important thing in com...<eos> Timing.<eos> Timing.<eos> Have you tasted Dad's wine?<eos> Oh, yes, indeed.<eos> Bloody awful, isn't it?
He didn't, by any chance, ever get out the Edmundo records and do the...<eos> Rumba?<eos> No.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - But of course I tried.<eos> Well, you would, because he was absolutely lovable.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't think of why I stopped coming down here.<eos> I love this place.<eos> It's intoxicating.
- How you going, Robert?<eos> - Good, Mr. Costello.<eos> I wanna tell you, at least two of these gents have machine guns.<eos> He's from the Chinese government.<eos> He's scared shitless.<eos> Government man.<eos> Scared.<eos> I'm concerned about a Chinaman who thinks it's wise to come to a business transaction with automatic weapons.<eos> For his own good, tell Bruce Lee and the Karate Kids none of us are carrying automatic weapons.<eos> Because here, in this country it don't add inches to your dick. You get a life sentence for it.
Kate.<eos> Wait, just stop. Just stop.<eos> Goddamn it, answer me.<eos> What is the matter?<eos> Kate!<eos> Sixty degrees on Valentine's Day.<eos> This cannot be Chicago.<eos> The TV says it's global warming.<eos> Nothing wrong with that.<eos> It's a dangerous thing.
Curses the gods and mourns alone.<eos> Leonidas!<eos> We are undone.<eos> Undone, I tell you.<eos> Destroyed.<eos> Daxos, calm yourself.<eos> Our hunchback traitor led Xerxes' lmmortals to the hidden goat path behind us.<eos> The Phocians you posted there were scattered without a fight.<eos> -This battle is over, Leonidas.<eos> -This battle is over when I say it is over.
And don't be surprised... if your plane doesn't make it off the runway... because the fuel dumps are empty.<eos> And our good friends, the Arabs, are only taking bullion.<eos> If we don't raise $14 billion... and that's million with a "B..." this war is over by the end of the month.<eos> We make a deal with the Japanese, we give whatever they want... and we come home, because you've seen them fight... and they sure as shit ain't giving up.<eos> $14 billion.<eos> The last three drives didn't make that much, altogether.<eos> People on the street corners... they looked at this picture, and they took hope.<eos> Don't ask me why, I think it's a crappy picture myself.<eos> You can't even see your faces.<eos> But it said we can win this war, are winning this war... we just need you to dig a little deeper.
- I command you to bring her to me!<eos> - Get back to your room.<eos> - It's all right, Mother.<eos> This is for you.<eos> My composition.<eos> - What have you done to it? - Made some notes.<eos> Look, I've even marked the good passages.<eos> - It's a mess.<eos> - But it has promise.<eos> I told you, it has promise.
I know it's easy and I'm the one that taught you to do it, but you can't need do it anymore. 'Cause I'm gonna be giving you money from now on. Look!<eos> I'II give you this whole thing if you promise me no more stealing barbecues and you'II stay on that patch.<eos> Okay, but can I at Ieast sell these?<eos> Oh, yeah, you can sell these, but don't steal any more.<eos> - Okay.<eos> -And don't tell Mom I gave you this money, all right?<eos> I Iove you, sweetie.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - I'm gonna spend my big dirty money on my wedding.<eos> I'm gonna get a nice ring, I don't care what it costs.
Oh, man.<eos> Instant fuck pad. You lucky bastard.<eos> That glass?<eos> Four-ply.<eos> - Bulletproof. - Bullshit.<eos> All right.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Walkin' the talk.<eos> - No, no, no, no!<eos> - He runs at the window. You know, to prove it was shatterproof.
That he comes or he doesn't?<eos> I'm going for a smoke.<eos> Don't talk about anything interesting till I get back.<eos> How long have you lived here?<eos> About six years, something like that.<eos> Seven.<eos> Hi, Dominic.<eos> Hi, Milena.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The beauty about antisocial behavior is that it takes you away from other people, however briefly.
Let's call them that.<eos> Andy was a jock and the center of attention.<eos> He entertained the family with tales of making first string.<eos> John was pudgy and awkward, and the only string he cared about was the one holding up Andy's sweats.<eos> Oh dear.<eos> One Sunday, pick any one, they're alone in the basement TV room.<eos> Andy blurts out I got a girlfriend.<eos> This chick from school, Jennifer.<eos> John hates her name.<eos> It's silly and common .
He behind his cage, crazy, crazy.<eos> Everybody laugh.<eos> She go, "yöu never get this!"<eos> But one time, he break cage and he get this.<eos> And then we all laugh.<eos> High five!<eos> Now...<eos> No, that would not be funny in America, okay?<eos> What is "not" jokes?<eos> A "not" joke is when we're trying to make fun of something and what we do is we make a statement that we pretend is true but, at the end, we say, "Not," which means it's not true.
Down at the end of the hall.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's what you look like when you smile, huh?<eos> You was probably drinking then too.<eos> There's the lady.<eos> Redhead. She cute. That ain't bad.<eos> Hey, man. Come on, don't be stopping to get high or nothing like that.<eos> Man, we gotta go.<eos> Make sure you lift the seat up before you go.<eos> It's up already.
He had these two paintings under his arm and a Sotheby's catalogue and we just sort of bumped into each other.<eos> I can't explain it, but... It was amazing.<eos> Because it was like I was finally seeing the person. I'd been waiting for my entire life.<eos> Oh my God! That's so romantic!<eos> So when do I get to meet him?<eos> Right after I do?<eos> - What? - Well...<eos> We didn't actually meet. Per se. As it were...<eos> But you know his name.<eos> Yes, it was on the Sotheby's catalogue.
So?<eos> So, he had to have walked out of there with something else.<eos> The bank says that there was nothing missing.<eos> So, there had to have been something in that box that was worth more to him than your envelope.<eos> You don't have to tell me.<eos> There's only one thing it could be anyway.<eos> Diamonds.<eos> And then there's the ring.<eos> Cartier ring.<eos> It belonged to the wife of a Parisian banker.
Talk to you later.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> Mr Hammond?<eos> Good morning, Detectives.<eos> Just like he planned.<eos> I got a court order here to open a safe deposit box.<eos> Number 392.<eos> STEVE-O: Oh, thank God.<eos> Where is it?
I'm still the same person I was.<eos> I still want the same things. Okay?<eos> I promise.<eos> Same Andy.<eos> Better clothes.<eos> I liked the old clothes.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, what about these necklaces? Do you like them?<eos> No? And this dress?<eos> It's new.
i drifted between imagination and reality, between past and present with increasing ease.<eos> i feel like a real man.<eos> you like men.<eos> you like real men, don't you?<eos> when i'm out there in the kit, on the pitch with the boys, i look like a god, i'm an adonis.<eos> i keep myself in good shape.<eos> i see the looks. i ignore them.<eos> i feel the bolts of time slowly coming away from the breakup.<eos> time manipulation is not a precise science.<eos> like any art, it's personal to the individual.
i feel the bolts of time slowly coming away from the breakup.<eos> time manipulation is not a precise science.<eos> like any art, it's personal to the individual.<eos> so what is the art in making my shift go so fast?<eos> i imagine the opposite.<eos> that time is frozen.<eos> i imagine the remote control for life has been paused.<eos> within this frozen world, i'm able to walk freely and unnoticed.<eos> nobody would even know that time had stopped.<eos> and when it started back up again, the invisible join would be seamless except for a slight shudder.
hey! where you going?<eos> i gotta go.<eos> i'll kiss you tomorrow.<eos> - but tomorrow's saturday.<eos> - meet me here at 11:00.<eos> i often came to play around the school grounds on a saturday.<eos> the familiar building, so unfamiliar in its quietness.<eos> peaceful, as if time had frozen still.<eos> it's like the walls of this room.<eos> it keeps the whole building standing.
I'm not able to concentrate on my studies.<eos> Give me a samosa.<eos> Ishu, one more tea.<eos> One more tea.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I didn't do it purposely...<eos> You didn't see that lorry...<eos> In fear...<eos> I tried to pull you...<eos> but your dress... and it tore...
How did he come here?<eos> How did he go away?<eos> Sleeping...<eos> Come infront of me, O my darling!<eos> Come.<eos> You're my mind, body soul!<eos> Come infront of me, O my darling!<eos> Let's blossom as flowers in the garden of love.<eos> I asked my heart "Who am I?"<eos> It replied that I'm yours.
How could you let bees build a hive on your bosom?<eos> Will it be nice if someone takes shelter in the place reserved for me?<eos> We are united like water and earth.<eos> Come infront of me, O my darling!<eos> Come.<eos> You're my mind, body soul!<eos> Come infront of me, O my darling!<eos> Let's blossom as flowers in the garden of love.<eos> I asked my heart "Who am I?"<eos> It replied that I'm yours.
- No smoking.<eos> No smoking.<eos> - Yes, yes, I know.<eos> Throw it out!<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> What's the plan?<eos> George should be at the lodge waiting for us, with the food.<eos> Good.<eos> Good. And the paintball gear?<eos> - It's all in the brown bag.
Not bad.<eos> Hey.<eos> I heard your story in English did really well.<eos> You know, it's, um it's been said that exposure to classical kinds of music as a child triggers these neural pathways in your brain that create this spatial, temporal reasoning ability.<eos> It increases your intellect.<eos> Your story was it, um about somebody in particular?<eos> Was it... personal?<eos> Of course it was personal.<eos> Oh.<eos> Who was it about?
Did you write it about anyone in particular?<eos> No, I didn't, and everybody's been asking me that, and it wasn't about anyone and it wasn't written FOR anyone.<eos> It's just a story.<eos> That's all it is. And if I showed it to someone - say, uh, your father?<eos> No!<eos> Why would you show it to him?<eos> OK, relax. No, I can't relax!<eos> It doesn't even have anything to do with him.<eos> And, look, I wrote the story because I wanted to be...<eos> Morning, guys. I wanted it to be controversial and different so I could win, and I did win.
One or many?<eos> It depends on which one you ask<eos> Many boyfriends from all races<eos> A long time ago, Doctor two farmers came across a young monk<eos> The monk asked them "Would you like to be rich?<eos> The farmers told him they did so he told them to go down to the lake<eos> All this from here to there used to be a lake<eos> When the farmers got there...<eos> By golly!<eos> It was full of gold and silver
Just don't have the stomach for this that I used to.<eos> Poor woman.<eos> - Please, sir...<eos> - Please, give us some money.<eos> - Please, please...<eos> - Please, sir...<eos> - What about me, sir?<eos> - Come back!<eos> What about me, sir?<eos> Not only the cleanest shave in London, Mr Todd, it's the quietest as well.
What is it?<eos> It's meat.<eos> I thought you could use it.<eos> Goodness.<eos> Where's it all from?<eos> - My brother is a butcher.<eos> - You never said.<eos> Well, he's just moved back near to London.<eos> He's gonna be sending me meat every so often.<eos> - Is it fresh?
And that I am not gonna do:<eos> What I can do is love as much as I can from where I am:<eos> To make every gesture and action sponsored by love:<eos> - Sounds to me like you've written a book of lies:<eos> - [Audience Murmuring]<eos> If what you're asking me is, did I make all of this stuff up, the answer is no:<eos> I've wondered what you're wondering:<eos> "Will anyone believe me, believe what I'm saying: : : Believe where this came from?"<eos> And I guess that that's up to you- to each of you:<eos> I only hope that you don't disqualify or marginalize the message: : : Because it's coming through such a fallible messenger:
If not, you're out:<eos> We understand each other?<eos> Uh, yes:<eos> Yes, we do:<eos> Well, good morning to you then:<eos> And by the way?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - If I were you, I would put that cover: : :<eos> - On top of your tent:<eos> - What's it for?

After the first seven, eight, nine years, you could see the pattern that was developing.<eos> But I asked a question.<eos> Why is it that it goes up and down once each year?<eos> And he explained that if you look at the land mass of the Earth, very little of it is south of the equator.<eos> The vast majority of it is north of the equator, and most of the vegetation is north of the equator.<eos> And so, when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted toward the sun, as it is in our spring and summer, the leaves come out and they breathe in carbon dioxide, and the amount in the atmosphere goes down.<eos> But when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted away from the sun, as it is in our fall and winter, the leaves fall and exhale carbon dioxide, and the amount in the atmosphere goes back up again.<eos> And so, it's as if the entire Earth once each year breathes in and out.<eos> So we started measuring carbon dioxide in 1958.<eos> And you can see that by the middle '60s, when he showed my class this image, it was already clear that it was going up.
I accept the finality of this outcome.<eos> ... do solemnly swear...<eos> I, George Walker Bush, do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President...<eos> Well, that was a hard blow, but...<eos> What do you do?<eos> You...<eos> You make the best of it.<eos> It brought into clear focus the mission that I had been pursuing for all these years, and<eos> I started giving the slide show again.<eos> One often unnoticed effect of global warming is it causes more precipitation, but more of it coming in one-time big storm events.
This neighboring province right next door had a severe drought at the same time these areas were flooding.<eos> One of the reasons for this has to do with the fact that global warming not only increases precipitation worldwide, but it also relocates the precipitation.<eos> And focus most of all on this part of Africa just on the edge of the Sahara.<eos> Unbelievable tragedies have been unfolding there, and there are a lot of reasons for it.<eos> But Darfur and Niger are among those tragedies.<eos> And one of the factors that has been compounding them is the lack of rainfall and the increasing drought.<eos> This is Lake Chad, once one of the largest lakes in the world.<eos> It has dried up over the last few decades to almost nothing, vastly complicating the other problems that they also have.<eos> The second reason why this is a paradox.<eos> Global warming creates more evaporation off the oceans to seed the clouds, but it sucks moisture out of the soil.
... more flooding and more drought and stronger storms is going up, and global warming is implicated in the pattern.<eos> And if you were to give some suggestions to everybody here about, like, what we can do for the situation now.<eos> Separating the truth from the fiction and the accurate connections from the misunderstandings is part of what you learn here.<eos> But when the warnings are accurate and based on sound science, then we as human beings, whatever country we live in, have to find a way to make sure that the warnings are heard and responded to.<eos> We both have a hard time shaking loose the familiar patterns that we've relied on in the past.<eos> We both face completely unacceptable consequences.<eos> And there are three factors that are causing this collision, and the first is population.<eos> When my generation, the baby boom generation, was born after World War II, the population had just crossed the two billion mark.<eos> Now, I'm in my 50s, and it's already gone to almost six and a half billion.<eos> And if I reach the demographic expectation for the baby boomers, it'll go over nine billion.
You do it with hen's eggs.<eos> You can eat hen's eggs, not a robin's eggs. I'll put them back in the nest.<eos> It's too late.<eos> The female won't want them any more.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Happy birthday, Mum.<eos> Open it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> This plant will die in my room.<eos> It won't.
The female won't want them any more.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Happy birthday, Mum.<eos> Open it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> This plant will die in my room.<eos> It won't.<eos> Come and see.<eos> I'll plant it there, under your window.<eos> It'll climb up to you.
I picked my best poem.<eos> My favourite.<eos> "The Swinging Ballad".<eos> I was so proud.<eos> I thought I'd shine for once.<eos> Then the day to read it came.<eos> I started reading to the whole class.<eos> I was so emotional.<eos> I was there for real.<eos> I knew it was good, that it sounded right.
We will call him Thopaga (joyful news).<eos> She is so lucky.<eos> A rich husband and now a son.<eos> Come!<eos> Zesay, come! Peta, come!<eos> What are you two talking about?<eos> Thopaga and Zesay's future.<eos> That's all you talk about these days.<eos> Here, have some meat.<eos> It'll make you strong.
We have not only high expenses but a high income too, praise be to Allah.<eos> And that needs administration.<eos> It is not wise for the learned to deal with such worldly affairs.<eos> Upon careful evaluation, we have concluded that you would be the best oerson.<eos> If you accept, you will be showing your loyalty to the order and serving Allah.<eos> I don't know if I can do it, my noble Master.<eos> I don't want to disappoint you.<eos> One can accomplish anything with Allah's help.<eos> The task is difficult because it is worldly.<eos> But it is easy for a man with a good heart.
We are collectively.<eos> It's there.<eos> It has such flexibility... that anything you can imagine, it will create.<eos> And you learn.<eos> I mean, your intention... causes this thing to materialize once you're conscious enough.<eos> - Yes, so what is consciousness?<eos> - What is consciousness?<eos> Well, consciousness is a very difficult thing to define.<eos> What is consciousness?<eos> Where does it come from?
And the moment that we experience that emotional state... in our body or in our brain... that hypothalamus will immediately assemble the peptide. It then releases it through the pituitary into the bloodstream.<eos> The moment it makes it into the bloodstream... it finds its way to different centers or different parts of the body.<eos> Every single cell in the body has these receptors on the outside.<eos> [ Woman ] One cell can have thousands of receptors... studding its surface kind of opening up... to the outside world.<eos> And when a peptide docks on a cell... it literally- like a key going into a lock- sits on the receptor surface and attaches to it... and kind of moves the receptor and... kind of like a doorbell buzzing sends a signal into the cell.<eos> - [ Buzzing ] - It's party time!<eos> -** [ Ends ] - [ Chattering ] [ Man ] What happens in adulthood... is that most of us who've had our glitches along the way... are operating in a emotionally detached place... or we're operating as if today were yesterday. Mixed.<eos> [ Man ] Change in itself means then... that we have to abandon our old self.<eos> It means that we have to leave behind our identity... for a few moments... and begin to speculate who we could be.<eos> To change means modifying our behavior enough... so that it's permanent.
- My name is Judge.<eos> - Who's name is Judge?<eos> - My name is...<eos> Okay.<eos> - That's a silly name.<eos> - That's enough.<eos> Judge.<eos> My name...<eos> Yes, I am judging your name.<eos> It am silly.
They're trying to crack the Skasas Paradigm.<eos> The Skasas what?<eos> The god-maker.<eos> The universal theory.<eos> Crack that equation and you've got control of the building blocks of the universe.<eos> Time and space and matter, yours to control.<eos> What, and the kids are like a giant computer?<eos> Yes.<eos> And their learning power is being accelerated by the oil.<eos> That oil from the kitchens, it works as a conducting agent, makes the kids cleverer.
He didn't want to die.<eos> Hannah.<eos> I think I'm gonna take my hand out now.<eos> When the hell are people gonna learn?<eos> it may not be as bad as it seems.<eos> Her hand is holding that device steady.<eos> Or maybe her hand is simply in there with the ammo.<eos> We can't know.<eos> Yeah,well,my guy's talked to the friend.<eos> That device is homemade, which means it's unstable and very unreliable.
Most wrestlers she knows are dumb.<eos> Tell her she hasn't been hanging out at the right gyms.<eos> How about instead you tell her that a persistent hiccup could be an indication of something much more serious?<eos> Schedule an esophagogram.<eos> She's competing this afternoon at the Taste of Seattle.<eos> Can't you give her a stronger dose of that drug?<eos> It worked.<eos> Did the hiccups come back?<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - Then it didn't work.
Topamax isn't just off-Iabel for weight loss.<eos> It's off-Iabel for mood disorders.<eos> plenty of bipolars are manic in the daytime, depressive at night.<eos> He's been medicating for years with alcohol, sleeping through the bad hours.<eos> It explains the danger journalism.<eos> Explains everything, including the kitchen sink.<eos> Okay, technically, it's the kitchen cabinets.<eos> He starts a project, then he stops.<eos> Except bipolar disorder does not cause seizures.<eos> And it doesn't shut down your kidneys.
Leather shoes, hamburgers.<eos> How can anybody do that to a cow?<eos> Make love, not belts.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> - I haven't actually...<eos> - Well, relax.<eos> Something we doctors deal with all the time.<eos> I'm gonna write you the name of a drug.<eos> You don't need a prescription.<eos> And it looks just like Depo-Provera.
Does she...<eos> - Is this another seizure?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Comin' in!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - 40 milligrams furosemide.<eos> Knock him out.<eos> How would an STD do this?<eos> It wouldn't.
Baby, there's something I have to do, and if I do it in front of you, it'll change the entire nature of our relationship.<eos> What is it?<eos> I have to pee.<eos> - This is bad.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We've gone nine years without peeing in front of each other.<eos> You always think there'll be more time.<eos> Look at us.<eos> We're basically an old married couple, and we're not even married yet.<eos> The flame of our romance is flickering, and if I pee all over it, it might go out forever.
I should kill you where you stand... but as I have said,<eos> The fate of the galaxy is at stake.<eos> We have been analyzing the information that Daniel Jackson was able to retrieve from Merlin's phase-shifting device.<eos> Unfortunately, he didn't get very far before it permanently ran out of power.<eos> There was enough data for us to summise what this so-called anti-Ori weapon might be.<eos> Really?<eos> I wasn't able to make heads or tails of it.<eos> Really?<eos> Just tell me what you've got.<eos> It is an energy transfer device, similar to a Zero Point Module, except that the energy is channeled not from subspace into ordinary space-time, but rather, into the dimension occupied by ascended beings.
What the hell is going on here?<eos> I want to talk with Dr. Weir.<eos> The Gate has to be active.<eos> It already is.<eos> Oh. Well...<eos> Dr. Weir, this is commander Cowen, leader of the Genii.<eos> Where is colonel Sheppard?<eos> Well, he's right here with me, along with the men you sent to storm this complex.<eos> Some would view that as an act of war.<eos> We were just trying to quell your rebellion before it started.
Right, I've got my beady eyes on them.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> No!<eos> Tom?<eos> - What are you?<eos> - Where's he gone?<eos> What do you want with our children?<eos> So, near future, yeah?<eos> I had a passing fancy.<eos> Only, it didn't pass, it stopped.
Come on!<eos> Come on!<eos> No!<eos> This one is un-programmed.<eos> Mr Crane, I thought you were one of the faithful.<eos> Oh, that I am, sir.<eos> My Ear Pod must have malfunctioned, for which I apologise.<eos> If I might?<eos> I'd like to request an upgrade, sir.<eos> I've seen the future and it's copyright Cybus Industries.
Hold me and cry.<eos> Don't try to hide it.<eos> It hurts me so much.<eos> I feel as if I'd die before you!<eos> I'm scared, Jae-kyung.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> Let me live.<eos> How... How could I...<eos> My heart...<eos> It's broken.
I am not being inappropriate.<eos> He's acting like she's skinned his puppy.<eos> - Yang, this is not nice.<eos> - I'm not a nice person.<eos> If you knew what she did you would understand.<eos> No, I don't understand.<eos> I don't wanna know.<eos> What I want is to analyze this angiogram, book this sucker into surgery and excise his cardiothoracic mass.<eos> - Doesn't look like a mass to me.<eos> - That's because it's not.
We really are taking off today.<eos> Oh. Oh.<eos> Now that's too bad.<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> What?<eos> The - That painting... Looks so good.<eos> If you can call that monstrosity good, Then, yeah, i guess.<eos> Sarah, what do you know about that painting?<eos> Not much.<eos> Just that it creeps me out.
So are we going or what?<eos> Sam Marry that girl.<eos> Uh... isn't this a crime scene?<eos> You've already lied to the cops.<eos> What's another infraction?<eos> Aren't you worried that it's gonna, you know, kill us?<eos> No, it seems to do its thing at night.<eos> I think we're all right in daylight.<eos> Sam, check it out.<eos> The razor - It's closed in this one, But it's open in that one.
I got it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're in no condition to drive.<eos> Why don't you let me give you a lift to the hospital?<eos> No, no, i couldn't possibly -<eos> No, no trouble.<eos> I insist.<eos> Be good.<eos> We're gonna kill this thing.<eos> I want it dead.
Believe me, i don't like it, but it's got to be the kid.<eos> Michael: you're crazy!<eos> Just go away or i'm calling the cops.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> You have to believe me, okay?<eos> This thing came through the window<eos> And attacked your brother.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I know what it looks like
Michael: you're crazy!<eos> Just go away or i'm calling the cops.<eos> Hang on a second.<eos> Just listen to me.<eos> You have to believe me, okay?<eos> This thing came through the window<eos> And attacked your brother.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I know what it looks like<eos> 'Cause it attacked my brother once, too.
So why are you telling me?<eos> Because we need your help.<eos> My help?<eos> We can kill it, me and him. It's what we do.<eos> But we can't do it without you.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Michael, listen to me.<eos> This thing hurt asher,<eos> And it's gonna keep hurting kids unless we stop it.
It's rolling downhill, for sure.<eos> Morale:<eos> Split down the middle, I'd say.<eos> The officers that love the stat are jazzed.<eos> The rest of them:<eos> We don't know where to turn.<eos> I thought a new hump as mayor might change this shit, not ramp it up.<eos> Hey, you still fucking that bitch?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It burning like hell, man.
Look at me, Bubs.<eos> I ain't in Narco.<eos> Yeah, I see.<eos> You look nice. I'm working homicides.<eos> So, if the bad boy happen to kill me, you can help me out then, right?<eos> If we drive around a bit, you think you can put eyes on this motherfucker?<eos> I can try.<eos> Get in.<eos> So, Nerese is bucking already.<eos> Feels like if the mayor's chair ain't gonna go to Royce, it should be hers.
Misaki-san<eos> Yes<eos> Let's begin from you<eos> Me?<eos> Thank you for flying with us<eos> Ok, carry on<eos> Thank you for flying with us<eos> Carry on<eos> Good day<eos> Where is it?
It's a field trip with a bunch of 12-year-olds.<eos> I'm not gonna need nicer stuff.<eos> Just in case.<eos> It's 10 days of diners and fast food, nothing requiring slacks or jackets.<eos> See, that's what the phrase "just in case" covers -- the times you think you've anticipated every possible need.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll bring it.<eos> You know, there was a flash flood in El Salvador last night.<eos> No, my salvadoran paper didn't come today.<eos> They didn't see it coming.
- All right.<eos> This is a wedding dress.<eos> It's the dress I wore when I married Mr. Kim 28 years ago.<eos> Hmm, khaki with a big zipper down the middle.<eos> Fashion is a fluctuating thing, huh?<eos> Oh, oh, the dress is inside.<eos> Right.<eos> I would like Lane to wear it at her wedding.<eos> Oh, how nice.<eos> But it's a tad big.
Welcome to the final hours of Honor's maidenhood.<eos> Yeah right, Honor's maidenhood didn't make it to upper school at Brearley. Not true.<eos> Turks and Caicos-- 1996.<eos> Anyway, we're here to celebrate these last precious hours before we lose Honor to the dark side.<eos> And to celebrate, we drink booze. Not me.<eos> I'm having one glass right before the ceremony.<eos> Whatever you need to tell yourself.<eos> Ooh, I love that dress, Rory. Oh, thanks.<eos> Is that Carolina's?<eos> Um, no, it's mine.
Don't you have something else to say to Lane?<eos> Maybe something to ask her?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry, uh...<eos> Lane?<eos> Lane, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Zach, I will.<eos> Hold on.<eos> This ring belonged to my grandmother.<eos> Now it belongs to you.
Here.<eos> Looks like they've been thinking up titles.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> "On Her Majesty's Secret Cervix".<eos> Guv.<eos> We've been flashing the photos around.<eos> Vic Tyler got a reaction.<eos> Why're you showing photographs of Vic Tyler?<eos> We should be going after the Mortons, the root of the problem!<eos> I've got a hunch about Vic Tyler and it looks like it's paying off.
or "This is gonna be the best Christmas Walford's ever had."<eos> Have you finished?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Finished.<eos> Captain, sir, there's something happening with the Ood.<eos> What are they doing?<eos> They're staring at me.<eos> I've told them to stop, but they won't.<eos> Danny, you're a big boy, I think you can take being stared at.<eos> But the telepathic field, sir, it's at Basic 100.
I don't know.<eos> Laminar flow.<eos> No blood clots, no ragged edges.<eos> Cameron:<eos> Damn. Shut it down.<eos> We're just wasting time.<eos> Look at the right atrium.<eos> That's not Kawasaki's.<eos> No.<eos> Chase: It's small.

Because Denny's a patient.<eos> We can't fall for our patients.<eos> You're falling for a vet.<eos> I'm considering the possibility of maybe having a date with a vet.<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> My point is, Bailey's on the warpath about you and Denny.<eos> So just be careful.<eos> - How's the sponge count, Dr. Karev?<eos> They're all accounted for, but I see a bleeder here.<eos> It's small.
Which include motor gasoline, diesel fuel, jet fuel, railroad fuel and maritime fuel.<eos> 98% of all transportation energy comes from oil.<eos> Construction of an average car consumes somewhere between the energy equivalent of<eos> 27 and 54 barrels of oil, depending on whose statistics you use.<eos> Construction of an average desktop computer consumes 10 times its weight in fossil fuels.<eos> Microchip consumes 630 times its weight in fossil fuels during its construction.<eos> For every calorie that you eat in the United States and probably similar number in other industrialized nations, burns 10 calories of hydrocarbon energy.<eos> There are 6.4 billion people, I think, living on the planet now, most of them are reasonably well fed and that's the consequence of what was called the Green Revolution in the second half of the 20th century.<eos> Green Revolution consisted in very large measure of fertilizing land with petrochemicals, fertilizers that are derived from petroleum.<eos> Farming has changed more in the last 50 years than it did in the previous 1000.
And if you did that and burn U-235 in them, the worldwide reserves of uranium would be exhausted in somewhere between one and two decades.<eos> So, it would be a bridge, at best.<eos> Wind energy is becoming more popular and economically viable, but because of its intermittency and low power density, it will never contribute more than a small fraction of our energy supply.<eos> When you talk about wind or solar energy... these are very small.<eos> - Oh, yeah, I see it's started.<eos> - Can we turn that on a little bit more?<eos> - There it goes.<eos> - OK.<eos> So here, this is actually artificial light, but in sunshine it does the same thing, and so this little machine is converting light directly into electric power.<eos> It will convert 10 or 12% of sunlight directly into electric power.
I think it's very likely.<eos> I wouldn't be surprised, personally, if it doesn't trigger another<eos> Great Depression comparable to the one of the 1930s if not worse, because this one is imposed by nature rather than being a speculative bubble.<eos> I've taken this timespan here from 5000 years ago to 5000 years in the future.<eos> What we call recorded history began about 5000 years ago.<eos> So, what this shows is that this spike here is the episode of the fossil fuels, coal, oil and natural gas, and every other kind of fossil fuel in human history.<eos> It's the most disturbing thing that's ever happened to human species.<eos> It's responsible for our technological society and and in terms of human history is a very brief epoch.<eos> At the time of Christ there were about 300 million people on the planet. Which had about doubled by the end of 18th century, when coal came on, then came good old oil and suddenly the population went up 6 times.<eos> I don't think that we could sustain the present population of the globe, much less what it will be in 20 or 30 years, without the use of petrochemicals.
Just like Mom.<eos> Celiac can be triggered by all kinds of stress.<eos> Bills, childbirth, drunk husband...<eos> Every time she had a bowl of pasta or a slice of bread or a slosh of soy sauce, her small intestine became more damaged, less able to absorb the vitamins and minerals into her bloodstream.<eos> Her body couldn't absorb enough niacin, caused the pellagra.<eos> Couldn't absorb vitamin K, caused the bleeding.<eos> And celiac is why the baby's meds didn't work.<eos> His body just couldn't absorb them.<eos> Switch Mom to IV nutrition.<eos> It's gluten-free.
- Right.<eos> - Me neither.<eos> He asked you?<eos> - What's he thinking?<eos> - He not asked you?<eos> - Who wants some gear, then?<eos> - I'm giving up the gear.<eos> What, you and all?<eos> Smoking's ace.<eos> It's what sets us apart from the animals.
-What is the cause of that stain?<eos> -What?<eos> This stain. Coming out of the paint.<eos> Damp?<eos> -Does not feel damp.<eos> -It might be dry damp.<eos> -Dry damp?<eos> -Might be.<eos> -Paint over it, please.<eos> -I've tried, but it keeps coming back.
It's a joke, a joke.<eos> - See.<eos> It's salty.<eos> - No, this is just the flavor.<eos> I love it.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I wrote a poem.<eos> It's been 3 years since I had an inspiration.<eos> Let me see...<eos> It's in English...
We're quantifying the molecular...<eos> Steve, if you're ever gonna crawl out of this geek swamp, you gotta log some face time with the cool kids.<eos> Now, get going.<eos> I'd ditch Fatty and Dim Sum on the way there.<eos> They're gonna blow the ratio.<eos> Her film made me look like a boring housewife who's only good at cleaning.<eos> - Oh, that is an outrage!<eos> - Thank you, Roger.<eos> You're a terrible cleaner.<eos> Look at this place, it's filthy!
I guess this means I'm gonna have to start taking you on some real dates.<eos> I guess so.<eos> here we are,mr.<eos> -What are these?<eos> -D.N.R. Papers.<eos> Do not resuscitate?<eos> I'll leave these here and come back.<eos> why are you signing these?<eos> You're getting a heart.<eos> If this heart doesn't come through for some reason it will.
Skull mountain at six flags.<eos> - So, not this.<eos> - Nope, not this.<eos> Well, not only have I screwed up your night, but it's not even a good story.<eos> It's still a pretty good story.<eos> Yeah, that's good, 'cause I like to entertain.<eos> You know, I should have been a monkey in Washington Square Park with, like, a snappy hat.<eos> I feel so stupid.<eos> I really had myself believing it was gonna happen.<eos> I bought that stupid dress, and now it's just hanging there, mocking me.
At that point understood that We had a unique style.<eos> I do not think that we were quite original.<eos> I asked many people and we thought often.<eos> -- "E 'interesting perch?<eos> '... meet ... 'I Not a fregava cock of what we thought the other '. " We certainly thought that that people would have thought my music ... because ...?<eos> I would not have used these terms at the time.<eos> I do not understand how does the music and as you pull on the public.<eos> We began to do what seemed to us at all costs and there fregava a cock if not liked even if trying to accontentarli beginning to see what happened.<eos> Oh, I just mentioned our first concert.<eos> It was at a friend's house of Erin, in the woods.
- You got tupperware?<eos> - Paris...<eos> - Doyle, watch him.<eos> - Pausing.<eos> Hey, why aren't you asleep?<eos> Because I woke up.<eos> You're supposed to be asleep.<eos> I've been asleep for a week.<eos> My body's bored of sleep.<eos> It wants to do something.
Do you think people even know we're here?<eos> They saw us on the tour.<eos> Dude, where do you keep going, Cartman?<eos> just... n-need to keep taking a crap.<eos> I got diarrhea, really bad.<eos> Dude, it's bad enough we have to sit here without you taking a crap every ten minutes!<eos> Let's just try to sleep.<eos> Maybe help will come tomorrow.<eos> All that treasure.<eos> It's all mine!

The man who singlehandedly killed ManBearPig is a loser.<eos> We need to get our friend to a hospital right away!<eos> No!<eos> No, I'm fine!<eos> I just need to get home and rest.<eos> Cartman, seriously, you need to see a doctor.<eos> No! I just need to get to a toilet.<eos> See you guys. I...<eos> Dude, did Cartman just crap treasure?<eos> It's mine!

- But...<eos> It is done!<eos> - No, you're all good.<eos> - Great.<eos> Hey, Angela.<eos> I didn't have your zip code.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It was hand-delivered.<eos> but I did get a Save The Date after all.<eos> It's not my taste.
I don't know what you're talking about, but she was hot.<eos> I'm going back on Friday right after work.<eos> Hold on.<eos> What the fuck are you staring at?<eos> How are you liking Homicide?<eos> Loving it.<eos> Why?<eos> Anyway.<eos> It's on the way, boss.<eos> It's Joe and his message, but we already know what it is.
Now, over six billion crowd our fragile planet.<eos> But even so, there are still places barely touched by humanity.<eos> This series will take you to the last wildernesses and show you the planet and its wildlife as you have never seen them before.<eos> Imagine our world without sun.<eos> Male emperor penguins are facing the nearest that exists on planet Earth, winter in Antarctica.<eos> It's continuously dark and temperatures drop to minus 70 degrees centigrade.<eos> The penguins stay when all other creatures have fled because each guards a treasure, a single egg resting on the top of its feet and kept warm beneath the downy bulge of its stomach.<eos> There is no food and no water for them and they will not see the sun again for four months.<eos> Surely, no greater ordeal is faced by any animal.<eos> As the sun departs from the Antarctic, it lightens the skies in the far north.
But I want to befriend you all.<eos> I'm excited to have you all in my life.<eos> Take a seat there next to Jung-shik.<eos> Hey, welcome, Han-soo, I'm Sung-gi<eos> Thanks.<eos> - You got the schedule?<eos> - Schedule?<eos> Sure I got it.<eos> Wait, I got it here.<eos> Where did it go?
Unemployment runs out.<eos> And once it does, you guys are gonna be back out on your asses.<eos> - Once it runs out, we're gonna go on welfare, dude. - Yup.<eos> - Welfare? - Mm-hmm.<eos> - You guys can't go on welfare.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> It's reserved for people who need it, you know?<eos> Like poor people who need some help thr...<eos> It's set up to continue...<eos> It's not for overprivileged pieces of shit who want to waste millions of dollars in tax...
- What?<eos> There 's something I need to find in the forest.<eos> I need some time.<eos> If he loses consciousness, then so be it.<eos> No consciousness.<eos> Could have been worse.<eos> If you'd not ordered the slaves, we'd have had to close the mine.<eos> "Slaves?"<eos> I prefer "out-workers."<eos> This... mourning, it is tiresome. Isn't it?
The problem for us is not, "Are our desires satisfied or not?"<eos> The problem is, "How do we know what we desire?"<eos> There is nothing spontaneous, nothing natural, about human desires.<eos> Our desires are artificial. We have to be taught to desire.<eos> Cinema is the ultimate pervert art.<eos> It doesn't give you what you desire, it tells you how to desire.
Like in the well-known adventure of Cheshire Cat from Alice in Wonderland, where the cat disappears, the smile remains.<eos> You may have noticed that I'm not all there myself.<eos> The fascinating thing about partial objects, in the sense of organs without bodies, is that they embody what Freud called "death drive."<eos> Here, we have to be very careful.<eos> Death drive is not kind of a Buddhist striving for annihilation.<eos> "I want to find eternal peace.<eos> I want..." No.<eos> Death drive is almost the opposite.<eos> Death drive is the dimension of what in the Stephen King-like horror fiction is called the dimension of the undead, of living dead, of something which remains alive even after it is dead.<eos> And it's, in a way, immortal in its deadness itself. It goes on, insists. You cannot destroy it.
It's silence.<eos> It's a silent scream.<eos> In Hitchcock's The Birds, when the mother, of course who but the mother, finds the neighbour dead, his eyes picked out by the birds,<eos> she shouts, but the shout literally remains stuck in her throat.<eos> To return from cinema to so-called real life, the ultimate lesson of psychoanalysis is that exactly the same goes for our real life experience, that emotions as such are deceiving.<eos> There are no specifically fake emotions because, as Freud puts it literally, the only emotion which doesn't deceive is anxiety.<eos> All other emotions are fake.<eos> So, of course, the problem here is, are we able to encounter in cinema the emotion of anxiety, or is cinema as such a fake?<eos> Cinema, as the art of appearances, tells us something about reality itself.<eos> It tells us something about how reality constitutes itself.
I think that what we are dealing with is with a kind of a cinematic materialism, that beneath the level of meaning, spiritual meaning but also simple narrative meaning, we get a more elementary level of forms themselves,<eos> communicating with each other, interacting, reverberating, echoing, morphing, transforming one into the other.<eos> And it is this background, this background of proto-reality, a real which is more dense, more fundamental than the narrative reality, the story that we observe.<eos> It is this that provides the proper density of the cinematic experience.<eos> It's the gigantic tree where, in Vertigo, Madeleine and Scottie get together, almost embrace, where their erotic tension becomes unbearable.<eos> What is this tree?<eos> I think it's another in the series of "Hitchcockian Big Things,"<eos> like the Mount Rushmore statues, or take another example, like Moby-Dick.<eos> This tree is not simply a natural object.<eos> It is, within our mental space, what in psychoanalysis is called "the Thing".
Aw, man, this is the worst thing to happen to this town since that roving gang of Tom Brokaws.<eos> Looks like someone's a little lost.<eos> Everyone, I have some bad news.<eos> Superstore USA has their own brewery on-site and can sell beer at a much cheaper price.<eos> So management has decided to close down.<eos> - You mean, I'm out of a job again?<eos> - I'm sorry, Peter.<eos> Man, this sucks worse than Easter Sunday at Richard Gere's house.<eos> Okay, find the Easter egg.<eos> I know where it is.

She's the second cousin to the Tooth Fairy.<eos> She brings candy if you put your splinter under your pillow at night.<eos> The Tooth Fairy is make-believe, just like the boogeyman.<eos> Hi, guys.<eos> You're right, Astor.<eos> There's no such thing as the boogeyman.<eos> But the Splinter Fairy -- she's the real deal.<eos> Will the Splinter Fairy come if I cry?<eos> Thanks for picking her up.<eos> If I had a heart, it might be breaking right now.
Now it's time to take away your pain.<eos> It was messier than I anticipated, but it was still a special day.<eos> But, of course, it was really Harry who paved the road to my salvation.<eos> With the nurse put down, Harry lived another year before hardening arteries squeezed the last bit of life from him, but his lessons have never failed me.<eos> Harry taught me that death isn't the end.<eos> It's the beginning of a chain reaction that will catch you if you're not careful.<eos> He taught me that none of us are who we appear to be on the outside .but we must maintain appearances to survive.<eos> But there was something Harry didn't teach me, something he didn't know, couldn't possibly know.<eos> The willful taking of life represents the ultimate disconnect from humanity.<eos> It leaves you an outsider, forever looking in, searching for company to keep.
He is implicated in a murder case.<eos> If that's why you brought him in, why didn't you do it sooner?<eos> He knows something.<eos> Being in custody might make him talk.<eos> This is punishment for taking you and your wife's family on.<eos> Not very professional, Mr Public Prosecutor.<eos> Have you had time to read my file?<eos> I found it fascinating.<eos> - Don't laugh at me.<eos> Really, for a legal aid case, it's brilliant.
Haven't seen him play for three or four months.<eos> And if you don't bring in the bacon, you're out of the Home.<eos> What Home?<eos> "Pesach's Home for the Gifted".<eos> One big happy family.<eos> Family, my ass.<eos> Family like that, you're better off an orphan.<eos> How do I find this place?<eos> You don't.<eos> It finds you.
A famous artist?<eos> Not yet, but soon.<eos> It's Marc's work.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Jérémy said you liked contemporary art.<eos> Isn't it beautiful, Guy?<eos> Which part of the body is it?<eos> Does that really matter?<eos> The body seems palpable, we only know fragments of someone else's body.<eos> Like a feeling, you want to grasp it totally, but it's always eluding you.
- I'm not even gonna-<eos> You slap on this fake smile, but I can see through it because I know how you feel, Dean.<eos> Dad's dead, and he left a hole and it hurts so bad you can't take it.<eos> But you can't just fill up that hole with whoever you want to.<eos> It's an insult to his memory.<eos> Okay.<eos> You can hit me all you want.<eos> It won't change anything.<eos> I'm going to that nest.<eos> You don't wanna tell me where it is, fine.
- You heard me.<eos> And I want the bedroom stereo,<eos> I want the marble console, and that painting of St. Augustine.<eos> - You don't even know who he is.<eos> - I know he matches the drapes.<eos> Can we focus?<eos> And my pearl necklace.<eos> I noticed that you swiped it.<eos> That was Mama's, and her mama's.<eos> It belongs in my family.
That's our daughter.. and father.<eos> These are the tokens for the promise made between the recently deceased King Sung Jo and Mr. Shin.<eos> OH MY GOSH!<eos> This is real..<eos> The royal families are waiting for the engagement ring.<eos> You are holding onto it safely right?<eos> Of course!<eos> Of course we are!<eos> We have it stored in a very a safe place!<eos> [mouths: Where is it?
"Because that' s your wish."<eos> "Now I have like three dates a week.<eos> They're fighting over me."<eos> "Good on you."<eos> "But I really want to stabilize a little bit.<eos> I want marriage, I want romance."<eos> "Well, paint it, okay."<eos> So he painted a beautiful romantic relationship, and a year later he got married, and he's very happy.<eos> Because he put another wish out.<eos> But he wished it in himself for years, but it did not happen because his wish could not manifest because the outer level of himself, his house, was just contradicting himself all the time.
But within a few years we have a brand new physical body.<eos> If you have a dis-ease, and you're focusing on it and you're talking to people about it, you're going to create more dis-eased cells.<eos> See yourself living in a perfectly healthy body.<eos> Let the doctor look after the dis-ease.<eos> Can you feel the difference between having painful arthritis in your hips and feeling fearful about it, or having painful arthritis in your hips and feeling hopeful about it?<eos> The difference between fearful and hopeful, is the difference between recovery or not.<eos> Happier thoughts lead to essentially a happier biochemistry. A happier, healthier body.<eos> Negative thoughts, stress, have been shown to seriously degrade the body and the functioning of the brain, because it' s our thoughts and emotions that are continuously reassembling, reorganising, recreating, our body.<eos> Remove physiological stress from the body, and the body does what it was designed to do.<eos> It heals itself.
Did you see another guy in there with you ?<eos> About my age, named Karl ?<eos> No.<eos> It's just Sawyer and me.<eos> You're not even supposed to be in that cage.<eos> What are you talking about ?<eos> Who are you ?<eos> Where'd you get that dress ?<eos> They gave it to me.<eos> It's mine.
I want Nations on NBS, Trevor.<eos> It means a lot to me that you like the script.<eos> But the bottom line is that I don't think my show will find an audience on your network.<eos> I think HBO is where people expect to find more literate programming.<eos> Yeah. I can't remember which Jane Austen novel was Taxicab Confessions adapted from?<eos> And as far as finding an audience, that's my job.<eos> You wrote an off-Broadway play about Pericles when he was mayor of Athens.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Pericles said, "All things good should flow into the boulevard."<eos> Your show is good, and it should be on American broadcast television for free and seen by as many people as possible.
That was self-defense.<eos> I hope it wasn't just beginner's luck.<eos> You want to charge me with something, go ahead.<eos> Otherwise, get the hell out of my room!<eos> Were you always this angry, Mr. Delfino?<eos> Or can't you remember?<eos> So, do you sell by the slice or do I gotta buy a whole pie?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I knew how hard you were working. So I figured I'd bring you a little something to eat and drink.<eos> You know, I can't pronounce this wine, which means it's either really expensive, or I have had too much.
The only people you can still make fun of.<eos> And Christians.<eos> Oh, and black people.<eos> No one in their right mind comes out of a coma and immediately asks to go home with an unknown condition, which means that either you're not in your right mind or it's not an unknown condition.<eos> You tried to off yourself?<eos> You figure I'm fat, therefore I hate myself.<eos> Yeah, that's a huge leap of logic.<eos> I don't wanna die.<eos> I just don't wanna be here.<eos> Then it's a condition you've already had diagnosed, or it's something you know you've inherited.
Yes.<eos> It was headed towards that castle.<eos> Did you say that castle?<eos> That can't be good.<eos> Evil spirits are known to reside there.<eos> But Kojiro flew toward...<eos> I will send some men.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> We have received a precious gift from Kamehime of Inawashiro. The flesh of a renowned warrior from the state of Izumo.<eos> Surely, it shall satisfy your appetite.
Previously on Studio 60:<eos> - You knock my socks off.<eos> - Trevor Laughlin.<eos> He wrote a pilot script and it's good, it's called Nations.<eos> I don't think his show is quite right for your network.<eos> - Why?<eos> - It's good.
He couldn't just--<eos> He must have given you some kind of a message for me.<eos> He said you were right.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> Right about what?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> How would I know?<eos> He's your dad.<eos> You know what I found interesting about this case?<eos> That it proved that people can love unconditionally, and you can tell yourself it's not true, but you'll just end up in a hotel room in Atlantic City asking someone
Heroes help people, Dad.<eos> You know what?<eos> - You're a bad guy.<eos> - I'm not a bad guy, all right?<eos> Do you remember when I told you that six months ago I started having these bad dreams?<eos> We all have bad dreams, Niki.<eos> I don't think that they were just dreams.<eos> When they started, I thought that... Maybe somebody was following me or something.<eos> And I would catch my reflection.<eos> But it wasn't my reflection.
Okay where were we?<eos> It was June of 2006, and life had just taken an unexpected turn.<eos> Dad, can't you just skip ahead to the part where you meet Mom?<eos> I feel like you've been talking for like a year.<eos> Honey, all this stuff I'm telling you is important.<eos> It's all part of the story.<eos> - Could I go to the bathroom?<eos> - No.<eos> The summer of 2006 was both wonderful and awful.<eos> For me, it started out great.
Like that?<eos> All right, sweetie, come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> I feel like I'm running for a touchdown.<eos> Try to keep an open mind, honey.<eos> Okay, on to plan B.<eos> - Any beer in the fridge, Dr. McNamara?<eos> - Beer?<eos> Beer can be helpful with lactation promotion.<eos> It relaxes the mommy so the milk can flow.
No, thanks.<eos> I think I figured out what I want to be when I grow up.<eos> Casey, that's not how we treat people.<eos> You'll get this back when you learn to be nice.<eos> - Barney!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What happened?<eos> He broke his hip.<eos> That's not true.<eos> It's just temporarily dislocated.
He shot him in the head.<eos> He shot him in the face.<eos> If there's anything I can do' give me a call' eh?<eos> That's my cousin.<eos> Derek Renshaw's dad.<eos> Marty Fairstone walked free this morning.<eos> A couple of months ago we found ammunition in his car.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We were sure we could prove it came from Peacock.
Tell Julia about the psychotic breastfeeding, and she won't believe a word Monica says.<eos> That girl is clearly a nut job.<eos> You realize between the two of us, we've almost ruined a marriage and a business by screwing the wrong women this month.<eos> What the hell is our problem?<eos> She only said that to worry you, Sean.<eos> She's not gonna tell Julia.<eos> You think my shit don't stink, Sean?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> My shit.<eos> It don't stink, right?
Although, big romantic weekend in the Poconos could change everything.<eos> You don't...<eos> No.<eos> I don't think it's sarcoidosis.<eos> He says it's sarcoidosis.<eos> Start them both on methotrexate.<eos> And if you're wrong?<eos> If Wilson's wrong, we'll biopsy her just to be sure.<eos> Her brain stem?<eos> Brain damage is not only possible, it's likely.
One date.<eos> And if it's still weird, we'll just give it one more chance.<eos> Oh, you're her father.<eos> But when I'm with you, I'm not thinking about Old Christine.<eos> What-- who?<eos> Oh, sorry, it's just that I've known my daughter longer, so I refer to you as New Christine, which makes her Old Christine.<eos> Well, one more date wouldn't kill me.<eos> So... second date wasn't so bad, was it?<eos> No.<eos> In fact, I think it was better than our first date.
I charted what our family tree would look like.<eos> - Looks confusing.<eos> - Confusing?<eos> !<eos> Connect the dots, you get a map of freakin' Alabama!<eos> Aren't you getting a little ahead of yourself?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> - Who's Emma?<eos> - That's our daughter.<eos> Hey, Jeff... today, at Ritchie's school, with everybody there, I got a glimpse of what the future would be like, and it is so messed up.
It was one of those laughable misunderstandings, and I use the word "laughable" quite wrongly.<eos> So, erm, anyway, from "dictionaries", we turn and plunge into the heart of darkness.<eos> Name, if you can, the subject of the three volume book whose first volume is entitled "The Long Years of Obscurity".<eos> The career of Phil Collins.<eos> I did a show once with Phil Collins... well, not just me and him;<eos> there were loads of people on... and, er, he did a song called Where's My Hat?<eos> , and he was wearing his hat throughout!<eos> It was ridiculous. "Do another song.<eos> It's rubbish!"<eos> Is this book about the word obscurity before it got famous?

"Do another song.<eos> It's rubbish!"<eos> Is this book about the word obscurity before it got famous?<eos> How it was beaten by its adjective father?<eos> And...<eos> And left on the doorstep, abandoned by his mother, and then it was the only noun growing up in a house of verbs.
- We don't know.<eos> - You just killed my neighbor.<eos> - Didn't have a choice.<eos> Maybe, but we need the county sheriff.<eos> I need the coroner.<eos> - Phones are down.<eos> - I know, I tried.<eos> - Tell me you got a police radio.<eos> - We do.<eos> But it crapped out, like everything else.
Stop retracing your steps, get ahead of it.<eos> Forget the liver and focus on the pancreas because after that...<eos> Actually, after that it doesn't really matter what it hits because, pretty much, all roads lead to a dead dwarf.<eos> I get why you don't want to go to rehab.<eos> But only an idiot goes to prison for being stubborn.<eos> Only an idiot stands between Ahab and his whale.<eos> Move.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Santa's got gifts.<eos> Olive oil wasn't in the kitchen, it was in the medicine cabinet.
- And people were getting murdered, and they'd be in a room, and there'd only be a tiny little window or something, and about an hour in, er,<eos> Holmes turns to Watson and says, "I've got one word to say to you Watson: pygmies."<eos> - That is deathless!<eos> - And there were some... there were some pygmies at the circus, and they were being sent out to do the bidding of an evil circus owner.<eos> I love the idea that we can go back to a happier time, when pygmies are the prime suspect for most crimes.<eos> So much easier to pick out in an identity parade.<eos> That one.<eos> It's political correctness...<eos> It's political correctness gone mad, isn't it.<eos> I once saw a very fine, er, Saturday night French television show, which didn't involve a midget as such, but it involved a small, tiny dwarf elephant that came out and danced and performed and capered around like nobody's business;
S-So many!<eos> H-Help me!<eos> H-Hel... Help!<eos> Please help me!<eos> I can't fight them!<eos> but you have an anti-Akuma weapon within you.<eos> Why don't you use it?<eos> Anti-Akuma weapon?<eos> That's right...<eos> It's not working!
Wearing the same pair looks great, huh?<eos> Young-rae!<eos> Young-rae!<eos> Young-rae!<eos> What are you doing all the way over here?<eos> Give me ten ice bars!<eos> What?<eos> If you don't have five, give me three.<eos> You have to pay money for ice bars.<eos> It's not free.
I think ... if Suk-soon was God's daughter, he'd probably puke.<eos> Oh my, what are you doing?<eos> You want to fight?<eos> Oh goodness!<eos> Oh, god.<eos> Oh!<eos> Young-rae!<eos> Have you eaten an ice bar before?<eos> Sure.<eos> What does it taste like?
Finding the fungus isn't a problem for the grubs since their caring parents actually show them the way.<eos> Incredibly, 80% of all insects live in jungles fewer more successful than the ants.<eos> There can be 8 million individuals in a single hectare.<eos> but jungle ants don't have it all their own way.<eos> These bullet ants are showing some worrying symptoms.<eos> Spores from a parasitic fungus called cordyceps have infiltrated their bodies and their minds.<eos> It's infected brain directs this ant upwards then, utterly disorientated, it grips a stem with it's mandibles.<eos> It seems extreme, but this is the reason why.<eos> Like something out of science fiction the fruiting body of the cordyceps erupts from the ant's head.<eos> It can take three weeks to grow and when finished, the deadly spores will burst from it's tip then, any ant in the vicinity will be in serious risk of death.
Exactly.<eos> You're barf to me now.<eos> Oh, Nelson...<eos> I'll never forget that week we were best friends.<eos> I touched your heart!<eos> Greystash!<eos> Greystash!<eos> Gee, you're really upset about this Greystash thing.<eos> Don't say his name.<eos> In your mouth, it sounds like dirt!
his surgery is today. you have nothing to worry about. i'm not worried,not anymore.<eos> hey.<eos> so are you and meredith having one of your<eos> "we're best friends,we're so cool" secret time things?<eos> sorry,i'm cranky. candy striping makes me so cranky.<eos> cristina's leaving.<eos> ah,so i can have my girlfriend back.<eos> what's wrong with her?<eos> why are you acting like the sky is falling?<eos> the sky isn't falling. it already fell. george knows.
no,stay here.<eos> mer. mer. is it bad? what does she need him to do?<eos> the guy's chest is a mess.<eos> she's juggling the tracheal and the aortic injuries, and she just needs another pair of hands.<eos> he just repaired a hole in her heart. i'm sure he can handle it.<eos> cristina. hey,hey,hey. what do you think you're doing?<eos> get back in there. what,do you think burke can't operate without you?<eos> oh,my god,cristina.<eos> shut up. he can't operate without you. if you ever gave a crap about me in any way, you will shut your mouth and get back into that o.r.<eos> there's a beat. it's beating. she's ready to come off bypass,right? she is.
Mi-hwa?<eos> In most wars, the weapons are guns and missiles.<eos> But in this kind of war, they're the newest hairstyles and dresses.<eos> A beautiful weapon that will make the enemy's heart pound.<eos> Let's see who the winner is.<eos> Ms. June?<eos> Okay, I've got you now.<eos> Yes?<eos> Is that your grandmother's dress?<eos> It's very similar to my grandmother's pajamas.
Jilly Cooper.<eos> So, what do we have here? .<eos> Oh, this looks divine.<eos> I don't think we have that one in Madame's size.<eos> What?<eos> . You want to put me in this? .<eos> I'm not Kate Winslet, darling.<eos> This one is much more my style.<eos> Oh, please be careful with the dress, Madame.<eos> It costs 1 0,000 euros.
- What's wrong with you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Sue, do you know the code?<eos> I might.<eos> Ben, open up.<eos> You all right, Ben?<eos> Does somebody have keys to these doors?<eos> Anybody?<eos> Just break the glass.<eos> It can't be that thick.
- I know.<eos> - Kyle, what...<eos> What the hell's happening?<eos> I heard people screaming, and then I lost Craig. I lost Craig.<eos> - Stay away from us.<eos> - What? Why?<eos> Show me your hand.<eos> - The other hand.<eos> - Ellie. we don't have time for this.<eos> There's an animal on the loose. It could be anywhere.
-Getting dizzy<eos> -How we gonna pay? -How we gonna pay?<eos> How we gonna pay?<eos> How we gonna pay<eos> Last year's rent?<eos> The music ignites the night With passionate fire<eos> The narration crackles and pops With incendiary wit<eos> Zoom in as they burn the past To the ground<eos> And feel the heat Of the future's glow<eos> How do you leave the past behind When it keeps finding ways To get to your heart? It reaches way down deep And tears you inside out
You know tuning pianos is really hard work and my back isn't what it used to be.<eos> Are you... Are you doing anything important right now?<eos> Cause I could really use a hand here.<eos> How about it?<eos> Please.<eos> Are you still there?<eos> You are, aren't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Good, good, come on!<eos> You know a lot of people think because a piano's so big, it is very strong and you can just pound it any way you want to and nothing will happen, but that's not so at all.
You ever have ice cream before?<eos> No.<eos> Well, this is vanilla ice cream.<eos> Vanilla's white.<eos> Vanilla is white.<eos> Go on, taste it.<eos> Oh no, just work it around.<eos> Work it around.<eos> Oh my god!<eos> You know the thing about ice cream is first it's cold, but then it's sweet and if you freeze your mouth out, you're never gonna be able to taste the sweet part.
Listen, it's about you.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> "...regain the life and health war-torn Finland couldn't give."<eos> "These children are grateful to their Swedish benefactors - for their sacrifices in these times of hardship."<eos> Grateful, it says!<eos> We're good to you, but you're angry and boring!<eos> They could've sent us someone nice.<eos> Wait!<eos> I know something I mustn't tell you!<eos> Look at this nice dress. It was for you.
I don't know if you're back from wherever you were this time but if you are, call me.<eos> It's the nightmares.<eos> They've started again. I need to know if it's just me.<eos> Call me, please.<eos> Well, are you going to open it up?<eos> make sure it's what you're looking for?<eos> The conditions must be perfect.<eos> Is this made of solid gold?<eos> You know, the Abkani was the first civilization to use gold to house their valuables.<eos> They believed it held the power to contain evil spirits.
- All right!<eos> - Uh, I want to get off.<eos> - Uh, sorry, what exactly are we doing?<eos> - This!<eos> The Infinite Improbability Drive is a wonderful new method of crossing interstellar distances in a few seconds, without all that tedious mucking about in hyperspace.<eos> As the Improbability Drive reaches infinite improbability, it passes through every conceivable point in every conceivable universe almost simultaneously.<eos> So you're never sure where you'll end up or even what species you'll be when you get there.<eos> It's therefore important to dress accordingly.<eos> The Drive was invented following research into finite improbability often used to break the ice at parties by making all the molecules in the hostess's undergarments leap one foot to the left in accordance with the theory of indeterminacy.<eos> Many physicists said they wouldn't stand for that sort of thing, partly because it debased science, but mostly because they didn't get invited to those sort of parties.
SIMON [ON PHONE]:<eos> Jerry? - Simon.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Simon, what's up?<eos> Listen, I need you to get me into that nanotech IPO. I want 10 blocks.<eos> JERRY: Ha! That's 50 grand.<eos> Did you inherit a boatload or something?<eos> The initial public offering comes out Tuesday.<eos> What do you expect me to do?<eos> Look, I know when it comes out, Gerald.
I haven't.<eos> Impressive.<eos> We have purged your fear.<eos> You are ready to lead these men.<eos> You are ready to become a member of the League of Shadows.<eos> But first, you must demonstrate your commitment to justice.<eos> No.<eos> I'm no executioner.<eos> Your compassion is a weakness your enemies will not share.<eos> That's why it's so important.
How would I know?<eos> - Why is she in all of them?<eos> Her name's Samara.<eos> She was murdered by her mother.<eos> Left to die at the bottom of a well.<eos> - Wait, she's... she's who?<eos> - She didn't die.<eos> At least, not her ghost.<eos> I kept it alive for Aidan.<eos> I let it out, it spread and then we ran.
20 bucks?<eos> I thought you were gonna be some hotshot business guy.<eos> Fine. 50.<eos> - 50 big ones.<eos> - 50 it is.<eos> Any time before Christmas.<eos> - I'm saving my film.<eos> - For what?<eos> For your trip?<eos> This is your trip. It's happening right now.
Will you go all alone?<eos> I'll find my way.<eos> But you'll get lost!<eos> He who has faith... will never get lost, my little angel.<eos> He who is at peace won't lose his way.<eos> But where is this gathering?<eos> I don't know, my angel.<eos> Do the others know?<eos> No, they don't know either.<eos> How can you go to a gathering without knowing where it is?
Master, I brought you some sand.<eos> This sand is as soft as silk.<eos> I have brought it from far away for you, but this is the last time.<eos> I'm going to leave.<eos> Why, Osman?<eos> It was your forefathers' profession.<eos> Precisely.<eos> I don't want to pass it on to anyone.<eos> Take this letter.<eos> You know who it's for.
Why do you always question the good?<eos> You only think about the bad.<eos> I just have a feeling that something is wrong.<eos> Good things do happen.<eos> I wanna see that bug.<eos> Hey, Gandu learned a new word from the censor.<eos> - What?<eos> - "Dude."<eos> - "Dude"?<eos> What does it mean?
- Merry Christmas.<eos> - Take off your boots.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Hi, Dad.<eos> - Merry Christmas.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> I'm Raymond's mother.<eos> My family always appreciated gourmet food.<eos> Did you at least make a wish?<eos> It won't come true, he can't get it up yet.
You would risk engender-ating ill will on the part of our employers.<eos> Burt Shlubb and Douglas Klump:<eos> Two any-dirty-job-there-is thugs with delusions of eloquence.<eos> This Jaguar you so pinheadedly covet, remanded to our custody, though it may be, remains the property of the son of Senator Roark.<eos> Gotta keep this quiet.<eos> Take 'em down fast.<eos> A dent, the merest scratch thereupon, and before-mentioned consequences which I made mention shall surely be athwart us.<eos> Catch your breath.<eos> Give your heart time to slow down.<eos> But it won't slow down.
This is bullshit.<eos> Every time I make a sale, you go crying to Paula.<eos> How about Jesse Jackson?<eos> Old Jesse needs a cause.<eos> Sick of you poaching my customers.<eos> I'm sick of your crybaby bullshit.<eos> You wanna take this shit outside? Just take it outside and squash it?<eos> Let's stay inside, so everybody can see what a pussy you have, okay?<eos> Because when I remove the blade I keep in my boot from its sheath...<eos> I can't return it until it has spilled blood.
Thanks!<eos> Yeah, I forgot how good it is to sleep in a bed.<eos> How long have you been on the road?<eos> This time it's been about... about 3 weeks.<eos> But I've been on my own since I was 17.<eos> Where you from originally?<eos> Have you ever heard of a place called Eden?<eos> Yeah, book of Genesis?<eos> This place wasn't paradise.<eos> You know, actually it was kinda pretty.
She wants something.<eos> Like what?<eos> A gift.<eos> I could draw a picture, of you and me.<eos> Or give her Glitter Gal.<eos> Shut up, Mustique.<eos> Then what?<eos> Something only a dead person uses.<eos> The radio.<eos> It's dead.
Sounds pretty good.<eos> Think so?<eos> So, uh, as just a guy who gave another guy a sandwich,<eos> you have any, like, philosophical tips or anything... for a guy on a kind of road trip?<eos> You asking me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well-<eos> The past is gone.<eos> I know that.<eos> The future... isn't here yet, whatever it's going to be.
Oh, well why didn't you say so in the first place? !<eos> Do you like Sammy?<eos> Course I do.<eos> Don't you think it's hurtful that Harold don't take Sammy to see his mama?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> I mean, after all, if there's anyone who should understand what it's like to miss their mama...<eos> Well I just ain't had the best viscosity lately...<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Flow-ability.<eos> Sometimes when motor oil gets too thin it don't work too good at high temperatures.
Whatever for...<eos> Funny you should say that, It's a phrase I keep repeating lately, It's stuck in my head.<eos> Except today I didn't think about it, you were the one who said it.<eos> You know what?<eos> I would feel like a whore, like I'm doing it to thank you for the job. I don't want that.<eos> I understand.<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> Can you feel my heart?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's still beating.
I'm sure Steve is fine.<eos> Dr Carmack, I'm going to take your blood pressure.<eos> - Hey...<eos> - it's okay, it's okay.<eos> - I can feel it.<eos> - What happened in there?<eos> Shut it down.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> Shut it down.<eos> It's inside.
Okay.<eos> See you tomorrow, then.<eos> Bye.<eos> - Well?<eos> - Huh?<eos> - Well?<eos> - Well...<eos> - l can't understand anything!<eos> - Not even reading the libretto?<eos> No, it's in German, look, German.
- You OK?<eos> See you down there.<eos> - No.<eos> Make sure your cow's tail is locked there and there.<eos> You hold on to this like that.<eos> Look, I have done this before, you know?<eos> - I'm only looking after you.<eos> - And I appreciate it, in small doses.<eos> You gotta see this place.<eos> It's beautiful!
Yours is no different, right?<eos> I'm a workman, sure. But Yvonne's a laundress.<eos> It's wartime for everyone.<eos> Some get rich, others lose the lot.<eos> Bad time for the honest.<eos> Are you one of our customers?<eos> Yvonne insisted.<eos> She thinks even workmen should have clean linen.<eos> It's lovely!<eos> It'd suit me better than Mme Levy-Rosenthal.
"Explosion of Pain".<eos> It is the most delicate of my... creations and I hope you like it and that it moves you as much as it does me.<eos> Anyway, here it is.<eos> Look at the intensity, the power.<eos> The...<eos> You hate it.<eos> Well, I prefer figurative painting. I know, I know.<eos> This... is art.<eos> It is art because there is absolutely nothing to understand.<eos> When art touches you, it touches you.

Our governments can't... Until when do we have to play the underdog?<eos> I won't let them take the nuke from us.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Going to war?<eos> If they threaten us, we should.<eos> Calm down, Kang.<eos> I'm frustrated, too.<eos> Though we've built a nuke, we're no match for them.<eos> Nuclear armaments were a brilliant idea.<eos> But it was far-fetched.
Always what's best for the others!<eos> She was right about them, Norik.<eos> About me.<eos> Who have you been talking to, Vakama?<eos> Who's put these thoughts in your head?<eos> You'll find out soon enough.<eos> I'm counting on it.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You don't have to understand the message, Norik, just carry it.<eos> This message, what is it?
They said she's fine.<eos> SMS from Lee Jin Woo<eos> Meet me at the Sky Lounge today.<eos> Hello, Hello.<eos> Jin-woo, if you're off duty, then act like it.<eos> Forget this and go start a fire in your girlfriend's heart<eos> Okay?<eos> See you.<eos> Hey, be careful!<eos> Where is it?
- Where from?<eos> - Don't provoke the kids against me!<eos> Come on kids, go and pick some grapes over there.<eos> Unless your grandma feels sorry for them.<eos> Hüseyin will have sleepless nights just because a bunch of grapes was picked.<eos> I am going to tell my grandpa that you make fun of him.<eos> Tell him, I don't care.<eos> May the one who is scared of your grandpa be like him.<eos> - Yes, my dear?<eos> - Your name, why is it "white rose"?
Did your boyfriend made you angry?<eos> No<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> You are at the best time of your youth.<eos> My friends always tease me about my name, that it sounds like a country pumpkin.<eos> You are crying over that?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Why don't you try.<eos> What is wrong with your name?<eos> As long as it is not Sam Soon it's ok.
Like, besides killing ourselves, we also kill each other!<eos> Murder! And we're the only ones who do that, by the way!<eos> We are the only species on earth that deliberately kills members of their own species for personal gain...<eos> Or pleasure! Sometimes it's just fun...!<eos> We're also the only species that deliberately kill members of another species...! ...for personal gain, or pleasure!<eos> That's what hunters do! They kill for pleasure!<eos> That's us! Human beings! Interesting folks!<eos> Murderous! Here's an interesting form of murder we came up with...!<eos> Assassination! Do you what's interesting about assassination!<eos> Well, not only does it change those popularity polls in a big fucking hurry!
And they were good at it!<eos> Well, they got a lot of practice!<eos> For instance, around the year 1500 the aztecs sacrificed 18,000 people in one ceremony!<eos> OK? 18,000 people in one ceremony! Do you know what the occasion was?<eos> They were opening a new temple!<eos> Nothing like religion for a little entertainment, huh?<eos> Specially that old-time religion!<eos> Do you know how the aztecs went about their sacrificing?<eos> Here's how they did it... They would do that right out in public, right in front of everybody, big town, beautiful city square... twenty, thirty thousand people looking on!<eos> They would take the guy...! ...lay him on an altar, cut his chest open, pull his heart out and hold it up in the air while it was still beating! Got that?

This ain't just blowin' off steam!<eos> I've got a little evidence to support my claim!<eos> It just seems to me, seems to me that only a really low IQ population could have taken this beautiful continent this magnificent American landscape, that we inherited...<eos> Well, actually, we stole it from the Mexicans and Indians, but...<eos> Hey, it was nice when we stole it!<eos> Looked pretty good, it was pristine...!<eos> Paradise! Have you seen it lately?<eos> Have you taken a good look at it lately?<eos> It's fucking embarrassing!<eos> Only a nation of unenlightened half-wits could have taken this beautiful place, and turned it into what it is today...
Full speed ahead!<eos> Hey, catch him, quick!<eos> Chase after those bikes!<eos> Hey, I'm a teacher!<eos> You guys can't do that!<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> - I'm heavier than you thought?<eos> - No, you're as heavy as I thought.<eos> The sea's so blue.<eos> It usually is.

What does the "su" in Su-eun mean?<eos> Oh, "su" meaning "life!"<eos> And your "su" means "excellence!"<eos> Buy me a beeper.<eos> A beeper?<eos> I lost mine because of you, so you should buy me one.<eos> Because of me?<eos> You dummy.<eos> The sea's so red.<eos> It usually is at this time.

She will also lose the ability to speak and move.<eos> Eventually, she will be bedridden and have pneumonia.<eos> But doctor, she can undergo a brain surgery, right?<eos> She can be cured, right?<eos> You have to help her.<eos> Please.<eos> If she needs to have a brain or spinal cord surgery, I'll do my best to pay for it.<eos> The cause of this disease is still unknown, so there is no available cure.<eos> But her condition won't deteriorate right away.<eos> It will worsen slowly, maybe in a year or two,
I'm ignoring you.<eos> There's a difference.<eos> Listen.<eos> I'm not saying i can't do this.<eos> I will lead this movement.<eos> But jordan just died, and i need some time to get my head around that.<eos> You're going to have to grieve on the run like the rest of us.<eos> It's called being a grownup.<eos> Don't lecture me about my responsibilities.<eos> You just got here, and if this place needs me the way that you keep saying that it does, then it's going to have to work around me sometimes.
Mortimer and falcone were wearing state-of-the-art biohazard gear.<eos> That stuff's engineered to withstand an anthrax attack.<eos> They're dead, marco.<eos> Obviously, whatever she's releasing is a little craftier than the anthrax virus.<eos> If it got through those suits, that means the antigen's operating on a subatomic level.<eos> Which basically makes it unstoppable.<eos> Yeah, pretty much.<eos> Jean told me mortimer and falcone scared her when they came into her room.<eos> Is it possible the release of this virus is connected to her emotional state?<eos> Yeah, more than possible, it's likely.
More or less.<eos> Bet you almost forgot.<eos> No, i didn't, but i thought, in light of today's events, i would give you a little extension.<eos> Well, it's not necessary.<eos> It's a hot read.<eos> Lots of good stuff about spongebob.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The national threat assessment command has been working closely with state and local law enforcement in the jordan collier murder investigation...<eos> Though there have been no arrests made as of yet, ntac claims that progress is being made...<eos> Federal officials did say that the investigation is headed in a positive direction and are confident that it will lead to an arr...
What's going on?<eos> I have a board of directors meeting, and they won't let me go upstairs.<eos> Yeah, yeah. They called me.<eos> They said you were a little mixed up.<eos> Alana... this isn't the collier museum.<eos> It's... it's the 4400 center.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I come here all the time.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look... alana... the place you're thinking of, it's somewhere else.
You know, when times are tough, you can always turn to the power of prayer.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Show me.<eos> This was a big "get" for God. And Michael brought Maggie home to meet his son.<eos> This is gonna be easy.<eos> He's been signing off on everyone lately.<eos> Maybe he called.<eos> Hey, listen, so what's the deal on Zuckerkorn?<eos> 'Cause, you know, my fat case?<eos> It's really pretty thin.
- You kidding?<eos> This makes me look like my daughter.<eos> - No one's going to think that.<eos> I look like Edgar Winter.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I gotta get to spin class.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> We got a basketful of father-son fun here.<eos> - What's Kama Sutra oil?<eos> - [Clicks Tongue] Maybe it's not for us.
I thought you'd be happy, and I should have known better.<eos> Michael, be careful.<eos> People just see what they want to see.<eos> If she loved you, she'd show it.<eos> Michael was worried-- his mother may have been making sense.<eos> So, he returned home to talk to Rita.<eos> Ah, here comes the bride.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing in a wheelchair?<eos> No, no, no, it's a dolly to help videotape your nuptials.
Or it could be your colon.<eos> I'd want to get in there and find some answers.<eos> Well, I am the best doctor in the state.<eos> But if you don't trust my decisions-<eos> No, no, no. No.<eos> You're the doctor.<eos> You see, he's the authority here.<eos> We need to respect him just like the employees at the Bluth Company need to respect me.<eos> Okay, I'm going to put you on this machine to slow down your heart rate.<eos> Hopefully not too slow, because it's already dangerously slow as it is.
I assure you, you're up to it.<eos> That was very eloquent.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You need to get me another secretary, Shirley. Someone more willing to be harassed.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> These are bad times for science, Your Honor... especially at the hands of moral values.<eos> The government has systematically distorted... or worse, suppressed findings by the F.D.A. And E.P. A... when it comes to contraception, stem cell research... Al DS, global warming, pollution.<eos> Let's just stick to the case, counsel, and leave politics out of it.<eos> This case is all about politics.<eos> It's about getting religion back into schools.
I mean, sister.<eos> Please have a seat.<eos> If you just wanna give me his room number, I reckon I can find the way up. - I don't want to be no trouble.<eos> - Have a seat.<eos> Are you Mr. Hawkins?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You may see Father Kerrigan now.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> How did you know my name?<eos> It was on the list, of course.
Is the boy warm enough?<eos> Yes, thank you.<eos> This roof over our heads, Mr. Bullock, testifies to your care for William and me.<eos> The fostering affection and guidance you show my son to shape him into a man will only deepen my gratitude to you.<eos> As for myself... no further demonstrations are necessary as... other duties claim your attentions.<eos> None such as you conceive since your arrival, nor will they again, whatever the state of our relations.<eos> Do not sacrifice further on my account, Mr. Bullock.<eos> I reject the offering.<eos> I repudiate it.<eos> I find it poisonous.
All in the camp are welcome.<eos> They'd be sure to keep to their place.<eos> Why did you go to him?<eos> Now, hold to this counter as I reveal this, Mr. Star.<eos> I've lived most of my life a whore, and as much as he's her misery, the pimp's a whore's familiar, so the sudden strange or violent draws her to him.<eos> Not that I wouldn't learn another way.<eos> Look fucking mournful.<eos> Even more?<eos> Sad day, gentlemen, on which commerce must intrude.<eos> Says who that it must?
- Where's the "off" button?<eos> - It's underneath the panel thing.<eos> Well, it's stuck!<eos> Get the remote! Get the remote!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I found it!<eos> So can we have the cocoa now?<eos> Well?<eos> What do you think?<eos> It is glorious.
He'll be out in six months.<eos> If he's in the hoosegow, why do you need a fancy dress?<eos> Some of my model friends are coming from New York on Friday.<eos> I have to look better than ever.<eos> I can't have them think I moved to the suburbs and shop at strip malls.<eos> When they see this dress, they'll crumple to the floor<eos> - like the Botoxed hags they are.<eos> - Good.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's a little snug.
- Oh, so we lucked out.<eos> - Yes, we did.<eos> Now when the time comes to go public with our relationship, I need you to discuss it with me first.<eos> I'm the bride, after all.<eos> It's only... appropriate.<eos> OK.<eos> I will need you to wear that ring, though.<eos> The ring?<eos> You're not wearing it.<eos> Where is it?
Take pictures of the project, by all means, but not me, thank you.<eos> So, Cardiff Castle will be demolished, allowing the Blaidd Drwg project to rise up, tall and proud. A monument to Welsh industry.<eos> And, yes, some of you might shiver.<eos> The words "nuclear power station" and "major population center"<eos> aren't exactly the happiest of bedfellows.<eos> But I give you my personal guarantee that as long as I walk upon this Earth, no harm will come to any of my citizens.<eos> Now, drink up!<eos> A toast, to the future.<eos> To the future.<eos> And believe me... it will glow.
A time machine.<eos> - Time machine?<eos> - Cross my heart.<eos> Do you all have time machines where you come from?<eos> No, just the Doctor.<eos> Did you know these things were coming?<eos> No.<eos> God, I don't know, my head's spinning.<eos> What's the future like?<eos> It's not so different.
- I don't care.<eos> - And it's not Naples.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - It's Cardiff.<eos> Right.<eos> Now, it is a fact that there was nothing particular at all about the knocker on the door of this house.<eos> But let any man explain to me, if he can, how it happened that Scrooge having his key in the lock of the door, saw in the knocker, without it undergoing any intermediate process of change,<eos> not a knocker, but Marley's face!<eos> Marley's face!<eos> It looked at Scrooge as Marley used to look.
Checking for strings?<eos> Wires... perhaps.<eos> There must be some mechanism behind this fraud.<eos> Oh, come on, Charles.<eos> All right, I shouldn't have told you to shut up.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But you've got one of the best minds in the world. You saw those gas creatures.<eos> I cannot accept that.<eos> And what does the human body do when it decomposes?<eos> It breaks down and produces gas.
Tell me I can't.<eos> I haven't even been born yet, it's impossible for me to die.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Failing!<eos> Atmosphere hostile!<eos> Gas!<eos> The gas!<eos> But it's 1869, how can I die now?<eos> Time isn't a straight line, it can twist into any shape.
All that mattered at that moment was that Drew had my woman.<eos> I'm going to go downstairs.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What?<eos> You knew I like Keisha.<eos> Now you're up here kissing her? I...<eos> I didn't even know you liked her.<eos> And besides, I wasn't kissing her.<eos> She was kissing me.<eos> He used that same excuse with a woman's husband ten years later and it worked.
Hey there, Zach.<eos> Howdy.<eos> Hi there.<eos> Well, aren't we bouncy?<eos> - I'm in a pretty good mood.<eos> - Why's that?<eos> I'm just feeling nice and light.<eos> What's up with your face?<eos> Oh, what do you think is up with my face?<eos> - It looks all nude.
You're my sister-in-law, Mrs. Danes ... not that you're changing your name.<eos> You don't got to.<eos> Go modern.<eos> Oh, I'm not sure what I'm gonna do.<eos> This ring.<eos> - My brother has good taste. - Yes, he does.<eos> - You ever see my ring?<eos> It's a beaut, huh?<eos> - Definitely.<eos> Had a problem for a while. It turned my finger green.
I feel... I can feel the spine just underneath it.<eos> - Yes! You're touching the aorta.<eos> - I'm touching the aorta.<eos> Wrap the index finger of your left hand around it and apply the Satinsky clamp with your right hand.<eos> Got it.<eos> Wait, I... I think I can localize the bleeding.<eos> It's coming from the inferior vena cava.<eos> - Can you find the lesion? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I think I can feel it.<eos> - It's too far in to repair.
Welcome to the end of the thought process.<eos> Primary pulmonary hypertension?<eos> Maybe PE or pulmonary fibrosis.<eos> Could be some bizarre case of kyphoscoliosis.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> While I'm resting, you guys get some arterial blood gases, once you confirm that she is hypoxic, I want a plethysmography, chest x-ray, CT and V-Q.<eos> But if all that comes back negative, then snake a catheter into her lungs.<eos> Don't worry, if I don't sleep in, I'll get bagels.<eos> - You ever had this test before?<eos> - What's it for?
If Keith's symptoms had an environmental cause, they would have disappeared as soon as he got here.<eos> They've only gotten worse.<eos> If the food here wasn't one step below Riker's Island, he would've gotten better.<eos> - He's lost 14 pounds-- - Sure.<eos> This is nothing but a dietary thing.<eos> Naphthalene is a gas, a fat-soluble gas.<eos> Kid breathes it in, it gets stored in his fat cells.<eos> Outside the hospital, his body burned protein and carbs for energy. And the naphthalene stayed in fat.<eos> But once the car accident put him in the hospital and he started losing weight, his body had to get its energy somewhere else.<eos> It started to burn fat.
Your cat did not die of old age.<eos> It died of massive internal bleeding and acute liver failure... caused by naphthalene poisoning. The exact same thing your son has.<eos> You lie to me, you mess up my son's surgery, and now you expect me to trust you?<eos> Give me 24 hours. We'll pump your son full of calories--<eos> - That liver is going to somebody right now. - We're doing that surgery.<eos> You do the surgery, you'll be killing a mother of four.<eos> Father of three. - I was guessing.<eos> - Like you are now?<eos> Naphthalene poisoning is the best explanation we have for what's wrong with your son.<eos> It explains the internal bleeding, the hemolytic anemia, the liver failure.

They are cute.<eos> - Have her come back in.<eos> - What?<eos> Your plight has moved me.<eos> Tell your wife to come back.<eos> The necrosis is getting worse.<eos> Maybe because we're treating her for the wrong thing.<eos> Have you found the right thing?<eos> No.<eos> Then we continue the treatment, hope it's just taking longer than it should.
Trauma can activate the clotting enzymes.<eos> - Guy could lose more than his hand.<eos> - Thank you very much.<eos> This guy's been working for me for a long time, and I...<eos> Do I get bonus points if I act like I care?<eos> Cervical MRI.<eos> Work up for DIC.<eos> And start him on a heparin drip.<eos> - Who? - You wanna know his name?<eos> I'm sure it's in the file.
It's never been tried on a human being.<eos> It could kill him.<eos> - What's the difference?<eos> He's dead without it.<eos> - They're running a trial... on dogs at St. Sebastian's out in Philadelphia.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> What else could cause his estrogen level to be that high?<eos> Nothing.<eos> We're gonna put the medicine in here.<eos> Don't want it to burn his veins when it goes in.

You said Matt sprayed with it this morning before school.<eos> Matt started that garden himself for an environmental science class.<eos> - They weren't allowed to use pesticides.<eos> - Apparently he cheated a little.<eos> It was orange peel oil. Totally organic.<eos> He dumped that other stuff last winter.<eos> The symptoms fit.<eos> There must have been some left in the can.<eos> If you're wrong, what will this treatment do to him?<eos> Well, theoretically, it could increase the toxicity and-- But we're not wrong. Don't.
Hypogonadism.<eos> Isn't that a great word? Thanks.<eos> We don't get to say it nearly enough.<eos> Start him on Lupron right away.<eos> These freaks are willing to defile themselves for mass entertainment. For money.<eos> I feel sorry for them.<eos> He drops a clean urine, denies using steroids. And you're giving him a drug for what, steroid abuse?<eos> No, no, it's not.<eos> It's got calcium in it.<eos> It's very good for the bones.
Of?<eos> Whacked-outness?<eos> His sister voted for Nader, twice.<eos> That's about it.<eos> You were with House?<eos> When it happened?<eos> To his leg?<eos> You're interested in him.<eos> We went on one date.<eos> It didn't go very well.
Doctor?<eos> Yes?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You didn't ask her anything about the stomach pain?<eos> I made one little mistake.<eos> As little mistakes go, that was a biggie.<eos> She's only advising Chase?<eos> Not you?<eos> Well, what's the committee gonna do to me?<eos> I never even met this patient. Your disdain for human interaction doesn't exculpate you, it inculpates you.
Oh, forget it.<eos> I stabbed Lily.<eos> I stabbed my fiancee.<eos> Come on, Marshall, do you really think she's still your fiancee?<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Hey, I think you guys should have the apartment.<eos> But you fought so bravely for it.<eos> I wasn't fighting for the apartment, I was fighting for...<eos> I don't know... for everything to stay the way it is.<eos> But I'm not going to get that, so... seriously, take the place, it's yours.
Rebecca sure knows which crime scenes to miss, doesn't she?<eos> My bet is, even with the smell, she'd rather be here.<eos> And then she'd probably do that freaky thing where she starts talking like the victim and solves the whole case.<eos> What's the fun in that for us?<eos> She's dead.<eos> You seeing something I don't?<eos> 'Cause I still can't promise you it's not a fake.<eos> No.<eos> I don't mean the murder.<eos> Maybe it's real, maybe it isn't.
So what, if nothing ever comes out of this?<eos> So what, if you'll never act on it?<eos> You are so convinced that having a relationship near you is going to kill you.<eos> Because it will.<eos> And that's why I'm with Jenny.<eos> It works because she and I are both biding our time, waiting for the real deal to come along.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't think you and Jenny are the real deal?<eos> No.<eos> Jenny wouldn't know what the real deal was if it bit her in the ass.
We did.<eos> Immensely. But I hope you're not speaking in the past-tense.<eos> You know, your mother was a great supporter of ours, she helped to fund three to five projects a year.<eos> - My mother's retired.<eos> - I'm aware of that.<eos> - That's why I'm here.<eos> Obviously.<eos> - Obviously.<eos> Well, I'm sure you've received our proposal.<eos> I know it arrived...
Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> How did you get that?<eos> War wound.<eos> Looks more like a surgical scar.<eos> Like I said, war wound.<eos> The plane's radio -- was Boone able to pick up a signal?<eos> I was on the ground.<eos> All I could hear was static.<eos> So it was working?

It's exquisite.<eos> Is this your first wine tasting?<eos> I'll explain what they're doing.<eos> There are five steps.<eos> We call them the "Five S's"...<eos> Mm-hmm. See, swirl, sniff, sip and spit.<eos> Now, they're on step one.<eos> How does the wine look?<eos> Is it rich in color?<eos> Does it react with the light?
What-What-What can you rent for a hundred and five dollars?<eos> I rent a storage locker.<eos> It costs about that much per month.<eos> The missing key- the one from the book.<eos> It could have opened a locker.<eos> Mr. Monk, there are hundreds of storage lockers in San Francisco.<eos> Where would we even start?<eos> Well, Natalie, how about Trans-Cal Moving and Storage, 13025 Third Street?<eos> What?<eos> Th-This storage place- what time does it open?
Yeah, and you know what I think.<eos> Jealous, manipulative and lying.<eos> - And they're just her good points.<eos> - Well, I'm biased, remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yeah, sister-in-law.<eos> Then again, Vikram, without speaking to his sister, tells exactly the same story.<eos> Well, if what they both say is true, then we're no nearer to finding out who attacked Shivani.<eos> What about the ring?<eos> I mean, you wouldn't just take a wedding ring, would you, unless it had some special significance?
Here.<eos> It's coffee.<eos> You need to get in the shower. We got school.<eos> Took a shower yesterday.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I took a shower the day before yesterday.<eos> I'm making you a bagel. No.<eos> You need to eat.<eos> My body will tell me when it needs food.<eos> Just like it's telling you when it needs a shower?
Oh, no.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> You were so dorky.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Freeze.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Do you want to go over the rules one more time?<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> I'm looking in my wallet for money so you can tell me my fortune.<eos> I promise it's worth it.
It's a type of crab, it's a coconut crab, I've got to give you some points for getting crab, it is indeed a crab.<eos> (Phill) I know that because I had a friend who was in the army, he was stationed somewhere, and they had these things and they would just put kit bags on them and they would get up...<eos> They really do, they carry an enormous weight.<eos> The extraordinary thing about coconut crabs is they're distributed all over the Pacific but they cannot swim.<eos> They go to the beach to drink, they need salt water, but they cannot swim, they drown very quickly.<eos> So, what they do is they float on coconuts.<eos> Coconuts can go up to 3,000 miles, they float, and they cling onto the coconut.<eos> What's coconut milk?<eos> - (Phill) Tasty!<eos> - Where does it come from?

We're being very technical, there's one thing that's technically called a platypus and that is actually a beetle.<eos> That's the real platypus.<eos> It was a sort of nickname given to the duck-billed platypus that we still use.<eos> What do you know about the duck-billed kind?<eos> Only found in Australia, lives in water, got a flat bill on the front.<eos> - l've seen 'em in a zoo.<eos> - There you are.<eos> They swim about, they're quite frisky, they're very cute.<eos> When the first stuffed one appeared in Europe, people thought it was a hoax by a taxidermist.<eos> They refused to believe it was real.
- But he did invent the ball cock.<eos> - Ball cock.<eos> The ball... cock.<eos> Sorry, I don't know why that's funny, it just is.<eos> Sorry, but it's funny to say ball... cock.<eos> So, er...<eos> Yes, I learnt at the University of Rowan Atkinson, me.<eos> Anyway, yes, 206 BC there was a flush lavatory - from the Han dynasty.<eos> - Bet it wasn't any good.<eos> I bet we're talking about a bucket on a shelf that you poke with a stick, aren't we, and it falls on you?
Body heat releases caffeine micro-capsules into the skin, much as a nicotine patch releases nicotine into the skin.<eos> It apparently increases the metabolism of the legs, supposedly, so that you lose, as you say, cellulite, that orange-peel look.<eos> Yeah, decaf coffee tights, they're just tights.<eos> It does seem unlikely that slipping on a pair of tights is gonna dissolve a fat arse.<eos> At least it'll stop your leg going to sleep.<eos> (Stephen) Yeah, it would...<eos> Very good.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Let's burn off some of those unsightly points now by slipping into some thermal forfeits, shall we?<eos> In Chinese, Ql is pronounced "chi", and you probably know the word, it means "the life force".
(Cries) Grandma's gonna make it alright. Yes, she is. (Wails)<eos> Yes, she is. (Wails) Grandma's gonna make it alright.<eos> Grandma's gonna make it alright.<eos> Yes, I know it hurts. I know it hurts. Here's Mommy.<eos> Here's Mommy.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Debbie, I know you want to see your granddaughter, and I appreciate your help, but... and I appreciate your help, but...<eos> But what? But what? Until this thing's settled...<eos> Until this thing's settled... As far as I'm concerned, it already is.<eos> As far as I'm concerned, it already is. The three of you carrying on,
The gold that Pompey's boys stole from the treasury, sir.<eos> Pompey does not have it?<eos> He doesn't, sir.<eos> Now I meant no disrespect, and had I known the gold was from the treasury,<eos> I'd not have touched it.<eos> But there was this girl here, sir...<eos> Never mind the girl.<eos> Speak to the point.<eos> Where is the gold?<eos> It's all safe, sir.
Massive re-strategy.<eos> You're going to your senior prom whether you like it or not.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Put on your tux.<eos> Lois, wasn't this "not in the realm of possibilities"?<eos> Anything's possible, Clark.<eos> Anything.<eos> Over here, sheriff.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> The body was right here, it was right next to this rock.
What?<eos> Y-your... you're too late!<eos> Don't fail us!<eos> We'll be right there!<eos> No you can'<eos> - Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> You told me you killed that freak egg!<eos> I was sure I did!<eos> Well it's here!
Y-your... you're too late!<eos> Don't fail us!<eos> We'll be right there!<eos> No you can'<eos> - Hello?<eos> Hello!<eos> You told me you killed that freak egg!<eos> I was sure I did!<eos> Well it's here!<eos> You'd better make damn sure it doesn't reach these steps uncracked!
What is it?<eos> Well this is a portion of the database the Atlantis expedition brought back with them a few weeks ago.<eos> Specifically it's a log of the names of the Ancients who left the planet when it was under Siege from the Wraith and returned to Earth.<eos> Thousands of years ago.<eos> Yes.<eos> And what does this have to do with the tablet?<eos> See the tablet talks about a treasure, but it doesn't make any specific reference at all to where it is.<eos> Well it is supposed to be here.<eos> That's what the person who I stole it from told me. Before I stole it from him.<eos> Well I think it is here and I think I know where it is, too?
We're gonna split up. I'm with Teal'c.<eos> Yo!<eos> Wait up!<eos> I guess it would have been too easy for them to just leave that stuff laying out in the open.<eos> Maybe it's just me, but I'm digging this rapport we've got going between the two of us.<eos> You should give me a weapon. No.<eos> Could be some sort of icky creature down here, left behind to protect the treasure.<eos> For hundreds of years?<eos> Some sort of stasis or hibernation.<eos> What if it senses our presence and awakens hungry for human flesh.
We are all working very hard.<eos> It just seems as though Gerak is winning.<eos> Bratac and Ry'ac are negotiating with coalitions who have yet to declare their allegiance.<eos> I did not fight for the freedom of all Jaffa, only to have it corrupted by a few power hungry individuals.<eos> Nor did I.<eos> I just do not understand why you have chosen to spend so much time with the Tau'ri at such a critical stage.<eos> My friends of the Tau'ri are largely responsible for the Jaffa are being free and as thanks they have been treated with mistrust and disrespect.<eos> Until all Jaffa see that the old ways are not the future, I will do whatever I need to do to enlighten them.<eos> And how does chasing Ancient history do that?<eos> Ancient knowledge is what defeated the Goa'uld and the Replicators, and I believe that one day it will unite the Jaffa in a nation of peace!
Doctor Jackson believes the device was used for long range communication.<eos> Is it possible that's what they're doing?<eos> Talking to someone somewhere... out there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm heading to the mess.<eos> I'm good thanks, I should get back to Daniel and Vala.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just keep me posted.<eos> Caroline, you seem to be settling in okay.<eos> I don't know if I'll ever get used to this place, it's pretty...
I have no recollection of your participation.<eos> Teal'c. You wound me.<eos> I was the one who figured out how to activate all the Stargates in the galaxy at once!<eos> Didn't Ba'al mention that to you?<eos> That is so like him.<eos> Isn't it though?<eos> That's alright.<eos> Your adversaries call themselves the Ori.<eos> We know all about the Ori.<eos> Yes, well thus far I detect only a single individual, no doubt a Prior, inside the forcefield, but... It is expanding.
More chicken!<eos> I'll try to pull some strings.<eos> Nerus, this arrangement is only going to work if you actually do something to help with this problem.<eos> I was working.<eos> I was deep in thought when you walked in.<eos> Yeah, I could see that.<eos> You don't trust me!<eos> Course I don't trust you. Now.<eos> Here's the latest transmission from my satellite.<eos> As you can see, the forcefield continues to expand in phases and as it does so, it weakens considerably.
Time to do what?<eos> What everything we've done has just made things worse.<eos> The planet's diameter has now decreased by up to 50% and it's accelerating rapidly.<eos> I think I know why.<eos> Only one thing in the universe could power a Gate that size.<eos> It's also the only thing that would allow them to keep the Gate open this long.<eos> And there's one on the other end.<eos> A black hole.<eos> That's what the forcefield was for.<eos> It wasn't mean't to keep us out, it was designed to collapse the planet into one micro singularity.
You're just delaying the inevitable.<eos> The replicators are a formidable enemy.<eos> But I have recently learned of a weapon hidden on Dakara, capable of destroying them.<eos> Really?<eos> And you're telling me this... why?<eos> Because you must destroy it before my fleet arrives to claim it.<eos> All right, you got me.<eos> I haven't the slightest idea what you're talking about.<eos> The weapon on Dakara was built by the Ancients.<eos> It is not only capable of destroying the replicators, but all life in the galaxy.
No.<eos> Well, let me state the obvious.<eos> We can't let something like this get into his hands.<eos> Or the replicators' hands.<eos> How much time do we have before Baal's fleet reaches Dakara?<eos> Why?<eos> Baal didn't say exactly where the device was, did he?<eos> No.<eos> He said it was hidden.<eos> Chances are it's in the ruins, but we can't be sure.
You done?<eos> You got what you wanted.<eos> Don't suppose you wanna just drop me off at the nearest Stargate?<eos> It is true.<eos> I learned the location of the weapon that could be a threat to me and my brethren.<eos> But I also saw the extent of knowledge your subconscious mind contains.<eos> You have no idea, do you?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You've tried accessing it, but it's always just out of reach, isn't it?
- It's an Ancient design, sir.<eos> - Think our bomb will do the trick?<eos> We'll soon see.<eos> Give us ten minutes.<eos> Carter out.<eos> Right.<eos> Sam?<eos> You might wanna hold off on that for a minute.<eos> If I'm reading this screen right, the weapon uses an energy wave to reduce all matter to its basic molecular elements.<eos> It's not strong enough to disintegrate an entire planet, but it will wash away everything on a planet's surface, and anything in the surrounding space.

Turns out there's no bomb after all.<eos> There's no actual explosive device.<eos> The explosion will come, but from somewhere else.<eos> Now, with the Wraith on the way, we'll need to cloak the City,<eos> - right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In order to do that, we need to reconnect the ZedPM in order to supply the necessary power.<eos> And what about the Stargate?<eos> I've physically disabled the DHD.<eos> It won't be able to dial, so it won't be a problem.
Look, I've been up against that thing twice.<eos> I don't see how a third time's gonna turn out any different.<eos> You don't have to know how.<eos> You just have to trust that it will.<eos> OK, I think I've got it.<eos> I am interpreting a bit, but it seems the field... was designed as a sanctuary from the Wraith, but a place the last of the Ancients could travel to... and hopefully ascend without fear of attack.<eos> Of course.<eos> They could potentially spend entire lifetimes inside the field... before the Wraith even discovered the place.<eos> And if they ever attacked, their ships would get torn apart just as the probe did.<eos> And so it has remained for ten thousand years.
One day, perhaps?<eos> Yeah, one day.<eos> I'll look forward to it.<eos> There'll be no need to destroy the Sanctuary, Doctor McKay.<eos> What?<eos> No..., I wasn't thinking that, I was...<eos> We will keep the portal open for you until you are gone.<eos> At which point the ZedPM which undoubtedly powers this beautiful place will be...<eos> Sanctuary was left by those who came before us, for those who may seek it out and follow the path.<eos> And it will continue to remain after you are gone.
I tend to burn very easy.<eos> Just a few more seconds.<eos> How long can they survive those radiation levels?<eos> I believe it has already been too long.<eos> John can you read me?<eos> Rodney, come in.<eos> Daedalus this is Sheppard.<eos> Target is destroyed.<eos> I repeat. Target is destroyed.<eos> If you try one more shutdown, I think it might just work.
What was I supposed to say?<eos> Just be careful, Chamberlain.<eos> Remember your place... and remember our arrangement.<eos> What about the Colonel?<eos> I'll deal with him when the time comes.<eos> This is it.<eos> Alright, let's do it.<eos> I'm not so sure this is wise.<eos> Okay, I'm not interested in your primitive taboos, okay?<eos> It's a dark and scary place, but it's not cursed or haunted or anything like that.

All right, thanks.<eos> - So?<eos> - So that was Mary's brother.<eos> The mirror was in the family for years until he sold it. One week ago.<eos> To a store called Estate Antiques. A store in Toledo.<eos> So wherever the mirror goes, Mary goes?<eos> Her spirit's definitely tied up with it somehow.<eos> Isn't there an old superstition that says mirrors can capture spirits?<eos> When someone would die in a house people would cover the mirrors so the ghost wouldn't get trapped.<eos> Mary dies in front of a mirror, it draws in her spirit.
All right, all right.<eos> It's not that big a deal.<eos> Yeah, he acts all humble, but he scored a 174.<eos> - Is that good ?<eos> - Scary good.<eos> See, there you go.<eos> You are a first-round draft pick.<eos> You can go to any law school you want.<eos> Actually, I got an interview here monday.<eos> If it goes okay, I think I got a shot at a full ride next year.
How do you know?<eos> It isn't the same energy I felt the last time I was here.<eos> It's something different.<eos> What is it?<eos> Not it. Them.<eos> There's more than one spirit in this place.<eos> What are they doing here?<eos> They're here because of what happened to your family.<eos> You see, all those years ago, real evil came to you.<eos> It walked this house.
Spirits and demons don't have to unlock doors.<eos> -They just go through the walls.<eos> -So it's probably something corporeal.<eos> -"Corporeal"?<eos> Excuse me, professor.<eos> -Shut up.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> The claws, the speed that it moves....<eos> Could be a Skinwalker, maybe a Black Dog.<eos> Whatever we're talking about, we're talking about a creature and it's corporeal. Which means we can kill it.
I just want Angie back. I'm going home.<eos> Wow.<eos> He really liked her.<eos> I feel like I kicked a puppy.<eos> Well, this is what happens when you get into a pact with Eric Forman--<eos> Complete and utter devastation.<eos> What?<eos> So, Fez, what do you think?<eos> You like my dress?<eos> Yeah, it's okay, but you know what would be more appropriate?
Really ?<eos> Uh, no, he's at the car wash.<eos> You guys want to hear something sick ?<eos> Ooh, yes.<eos> Please, hurry.<eos> Mr. Randall down at the radio station wants me to host a live remote from hyde's record store when tom jones is there.<eos> And to promote it, they want to put me on a billboard wearing this.<eos> That's just good radio.<eos> Well, I'm not wearing it.<eos> I should be valued for my voice and music knowledge, not my body, no matter how smokin' it is.
She's fine.<eos> You can't put the tiger back in his cage now, Donna.<eos> He's all agitated.<eos> How can a crying baby not turn you off?<eos> Two words, Donna... eight teen.<eos> - Nothing turns me off.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Hey, Fez.<eos> Why are you staring at that milk?<eos> It's from a breast.
She's your best friend?<eos> Well, you're givin' her a run for her money.<eos> Okay, I gotta go.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> I was about to make sandwiches in the shape of x-wing fighters.<eos> Uh, no, really.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> I'm throwin' out all my comic books.<eos> I saw my future today and... well, it's living with its mother.<eos> Yeah, well, I saw my future and it sweats.
"No, I'm not gonna read the New Statesman.<eos> "This time is just for me. This is quality time just for me."<eos> - Is that normal?<eos> - It's sad.<eos> - At least I've made something.<eos> - Morning, Secretary ofState.<eos> We've got quite a lot to get through.<eos> - I've cancelled that interview for BBC Norfolk.<eos> - Why?<eos> Well, it was gonna clash with the two minutes' silence.
Because once I show my hand, Grace, I'm committed and then there's no way back.<eos> Show your hand? !<eos> This is Spence we're talking about.<eos> Why didn't you just tell him about the investigation from the off?<eos> He was busy.<eos> If it came to nothing it would've been a waste of time.<eos> Come on, what are you worrying about?<eos> You think he's involved?<eos> Are you suspicious of him?<eos> He was a kid in '88, all right, and this case damaged him, you know, it scarred him.
Well, it's like love gone sour.<eos> You know how prostitutes traditionally will do anything and everything but kissing?<eos> Really?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> Oh, didn't you?<eos> I thought you might have read about it somewhere.<eos> I might have read abou it.<eos> Well, it's about the face.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> It's sacred, it's what we are, it's what defines us.
According to her statement, he wasn't sexually aroused.<eos> She screamed and the man ran off.<eos> But she got a look at him.<eos> Julia Macey was in the shower.<eos> When she got out she saw a man looking at her through the bathroom window.<eos> He was masturbating.<eos> She shouted for her husband, but by the time he got there the man had gone.<eos> She sat with an artist.<eos> They look like two different guys, don't they?<eos> Which isn't surprising because if they were viewed through a bathroom window, unless it was open, he'd have been all wobbly, wouldn't he?
- You know, you're a good listener.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Let's get another round.<eos> Hey, Nancy!<eos> Where's your...?<eos> Where's your ring?<eos> My ring?<eos> Yeah, your pretty little diamond ring.<eos> It's in the shop.
It's hard to say.<eos> You can say that again.<eos> These photos were found in your home.<eos> My client is not the only one.<eos> All those questioned by the police were sent these photos.<eos> They don't stand accused of organising this torture.<eos> Yet my client does?<eos> - I'm not making this up.<eos> In the absence of concrete evidence, I'm surprised you give so much weight to a single anonymous denunciation.<eos> This testimony is not anonymous and I hope it will not be the only one.
It's not normal.<eos> Usually, it's the police who give dope to junkies.<eos> It's sad about that poor girl in the skip.<eos> I'll keep my ears open, I promise.<eos> It's so sad.<eos> Let me know if the coke is any good.<eos> If it is, I'll finish it.<eos> Good work, when I least expected it.<eos> I prepared my case well.<eos> It meant a lot to Mr Escudié.
We didn't listen!<eos> We did listen!<eos> Come on, everyone grab what you can, we have to walk.<eos> Oh Jesus, here it comes!<eos> Global warming!<eos> It's coming!<eos> Here comes global warming!<eos> We didn't listen!<eos> Come on, hurry!<eos> It's right behind us!

They're due at the forensic lab to identify their daughter.<eos> Be there, too.<eos> Hold on, not so fast.<eos> It's all in here.<eos> As for the rest... you can improvise.<eos> Her face is extremely disfigured.<eos> Are you sure you want to see her?<eos> Yes, we want to see her.<eos> She's our daughter.<eos> There are wounds to her body, but it's intact.
It seems unreasonable for visitors who have wandered in to demand to know who we are, does it not? Very well.<eos> Being sensitive to the order in which one is introduced is old-fashioned.<eos> Also, I would find it mortifying to be mocked as some official at a sports meet.<eos> What's your point?<eos> You may address me as Shige.<eos> The blood of the Heike flows in me.<eos> I have taken it upon myself to excavate the buried treasure of the Heike.<eos> Buried treasure?<eos> In a place like this?<eos> I can only say that it must exist.

If you don't mind eating these...<eos> Hey, wait a minute!<eos> --What are these things?<eos> --They're wasabi.<eos> In recent years, it has been said that life here on Earth sprang from organisms that were brought here by meteors.<eos> No one can deny that unknown viruses or organisms might lurk in these meteors that have traveled here from the far reaches of space.<eos> This is Penta, a self-professed psychic.<eos> It was he who divined the location of the buried treasure.<eos> Explosives were then planted in the bedrock that blocked the way to the treasure.<eos> I can only say that it must exist!
I'm beat, I'm beat...<eos> I have heartburn again...<eos> Now that he mentions it, maybe those weren't matsutake mushrooms that they ate back then.<eos> This is fishy...<eos> Are you two also...?<eos> What's her problem?<eos> Come to think of it, something has been bothering me.<eos> Didn't that Heike family tree seem suspicious to you?<eos> Beats me.<eos> If that's what's bothering you, it's in here.
Home cinema with multi-channel playback.<eos> Mr Renault, like that Froggie footballer drives?<eos> Is that my name?<eos> I didn't realise you were totting it all up.<eos> - I'll get Steve to pay you when I leave.<eos> - Why you...<eos> Thank your lucky stars that I'm a modern parent.<eos> You don't just walk in off the street and confess unless you feel guilty.<eos> Danny Holden's confession must still mean something.<eos> I don't think it means anything.
You know, when I'm feeling down... I go back to that railway track.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Do you want to know why?<eos> Because it reminds me of how strong I am.<eos> When I lay down on that track years ago, do you know what my name was?<eos> I thought we didn't talk about it.<eos> John Wesley Price.<eos> Courtesy of my dear old dad.<eos> I've not said that name out loud for 20 years.<eos> Now it seems like somebody else's name.
- What's that thing?<eos> - It's an ornament.<eos> - Christmas tree ornament.<eos> - You can't go to court like that.<eos> Of course not.<eos> - You okay, Denny?<eos> - It's this case.<eos> It seems like I've done nothing else but work on it for the last three weeks.<eos> What in particular about the case is bothering you?<eos> I don't know what it's about.
In trial on what?<eos> I, uh, was assigned a case a couple of days ago... which I sort of took.<eos> What kind of case?<eos> Uh, just a... homicide.<eos> What?<eos> Why are you suddenly taking court appointments?<eos> I just need kind of a change, that's all.<eos> Now everyone here is dissatisfied?<eos> What is this?<eos> The case I did last week, it kind of awakened me a little.
The government is trying to count these genetically raised salmon as wild ones.<eos> So they can take salmon off the endangered species list.<eos> - I get that.<eos> So what? - "So what?"<eos> People, Judge. Jobs, insurance, school books, food. - People.<eos> - Well, farmed salmon is terrible for people.<eos> They're carcinogenic.<eos> They don't even look like real salmon.<eos> By the way, they're fed these little pellets to turn their meat red.<eos> - Otherwise it's this pallid, white...
- What ?<eos> - Sarcasm.<eos> That's how you keep people at a safe distance.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You do.<eos> You use humor. For others, it's aggressive body piercings and facial tattoos.<eos> Thanks, Skitter.<eos> I'm not trying to distance anybody.<eos> I mean look at your cubicle.<eos> It's as bare as a... pop star's midriff.
I don't like these stamps.<eos> Do you have something else?<eos> I remember something with Amelia Earhart.<eos> - I loved her.<eos> - I reaped her.<eos> While everyone may agree that time flies when you're having fun, it is a little-known fact that even when you're not having fun, time still can fly... and it flies coach.<eos> This is a joke, right?<eos> So, what was my time?<eos> Nice.<eos> And even though times knows how to fly, it remembers how to crawl.
- "okay, andy. "<eos> I'm gonna give you somethin' to ease that.<eos> You lost your friend in the fire.<eos> Hey!<eos> Hey, winkie!<eos> Hey, wait a minute.<eos> Does that look american to you?<eos> No, this ain't.<eos> People don't eat this shit!<eos> It touched it!
You know how I feel about Won Ton - I wouldn't even slap his ass.<eos> But he's one fiery dragon.<eos> Trust me.<eos> It won't be harmed.<eos> "Lt" has a name.<eos> It's called Skipper.<eos> Rick, you've been to hell and back with your dead son.<eos> But that thing's dangerous.<eos> Can't you see that?<eos> You can dissect a heart, but you'll never know what makes it skip a beat.
- I know, we bought the first home we saw.<eos> Oh, Liz.<eos> No, I'm telling you, I walked into this place, and just felt it.<eos> - Felt what?<eos> - The vibe.<eos> That's right, she felt the vibe and now I'm in escrow.<eos> Did you at least have an inspector look at this place?<eos> Hey, we don't need some guy with a clipboard to tell us what we already knew, which was this white house was for us!<eos> Please don't be worried about this, the place is great.<eos> It's on a corner, it's got room for a pool, it's air-conditioner ready, it's landscaper ready, it's lawn ready, and it's got three bedrooms, if you build on two.
I mean, I hope you got some specifics on exactly what was going on.<eos> It's a girl who thinks it could kill you... it's worth knowing about.<eos> Have you ever taken a life?<eos> We should stop the antibiotics.<eos> It's too soon to say they're not having an effect. They're having an effect.<eos> His BP's falling fast.<eos> There's fluid filling his lungs.<eos> His creatinine's rising.<eos> His kidneys are shutting down.<eos> Our treatment isn't making him better, it's killing him.
Sensors will give us information we need for the exploratory surgery later this afternoon.<eos> My fingers are numb.<eos> Try not to move.<eos> We're in the right atrium, trying to catch the flow through the tricuspid valve.<eos> I think the catheter's curling in the atrium.<eos> Got it.<eos> We're in the RV in now.<eos> Ectopy.<eos> You must have irritated the heart wall.<eos> It'll calm down.
He never sleeps!<eos> Of course he's tired.<eos> - Right now, at this moment, are you tired?<eos> - No, no.<eos> That twitch in your leg.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> Didn't hurt.<eos> His leg twitched.<eos> I don't see what<eos> It's called a myoclonic jerk, it's very common when you're falling asleep.
Millions of people eat ham every day.<eos> It's quite a leap to think that she's got a tapeworm.<eos> OK, Mr. Neurologist.<eos> What happens when you give steroids to a person who has a tapeworm?<eos> They, they get a little better and then they get worse.<eos> Just like Rebecca Adler did.<eos> In a typical case if you don't cook pork well enough you ingest live tapeworm larvae.<eos> They got these little hooks they grab onto your bowel, they live, they grow up, they reproduce.<eos> Reproduce?<eos> There's only got one lesion, and it's nowhere near her bowel.
Smart, because they charge you two bucks a call.<eos> It was to Social Services, the State of New Jersey.<eos> You're his mother.<eos> You couldn't do it to him anymore.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Schizophrenics can make rational decisions.<eos> On the small stuff, yeah-- when to sleep, what to drink, you know. "No lemonade, but I'll take some hemlock if you've got it". Huh.<eos> Your man Socrates.<eos> But giving up your son because it's better for him, it's so sane, it's so rational.<eos> Self-sacrifice is not a symptom of schizophrenia. It excludes the diagnosis.
"We thought you would like to know that the endoscopy of your transverse colon "was judged to be the perfect archetype of its kind "and was first choice for inclusion in our reference library. " Yes!<eos> "In addition, the panel were impressed by an earlier study of your Fallopian tubes, "which was also of exceptional... "<eos> - Fallopian tubes?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This envelope...<eos> Think they got you mixed up with someone else?<eos> So this wasn't even your video in the first place?<eos> How did that happen?<eos> Where did you get that tape from?<eos> - It was on top of the TV where you left it.
- A bat with the face of a spider.<eos> And something else.<eos> Bainbridge has got Howard.<eos> He's in danger.<eos> We have to go and save him.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - A secret lab somewhere in the zoo.<eos> - Where?<eos> - The vision's fading. I can't see.<eos> Oh, it's coming back.
Karen never said anything about drinking outside of her club.<eos> Hey Brooke.<eos> I like your dress.<eos> So... I was wondering if maybe you wanted to do something some time.<eos> Hey, you wanna catch a movie some time?<eos> Sup Mouth?<eos> - Hmm... hey Theresa!<eos> Nice dress.<eos> - Um... thanks.<eos> Why does it look so familiar?

- Yes.<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Her name was Doris.<eos> "He's been out all night killing babies, I'm telling you!<eos> "lf he comes back in here covered in the blood of the innocent,<eos> "l am not washing that cloak!"<eos> "Herod!"<eos> Good, there's a lot of mileage to be had out of poor Herod's wife.<eos> - Doris!<eos> - lt's a Greek name, to our ears it is a bit funny, but... (Woman's voice) "Did you find the Messiah, because he's a very naughty boy?
None of which has anything to do with the next question - in the Battle of the Bulge, who were "The Stomach Division"?<eos> (Alan) The Germans.<eos> They were a German Division, a German... (Sean) A regiment of darts players.<eos> (Stephen) They were a Division.<eos> It's certainly a good description...<eos> Jocky Wilson, Eric Bristow.<eos> We're clear on what The Battle of the Bulge was?<eos> The Battle of the Bulge was in Belgium in the Second World War, when the allies were advancing and the Germans - went for one big counter-offensive.<eos> - (Stephen) Last great counter-offensive.<eos> And it was so successful that they made a film about it.
Those are hexagons.<eos> They are hexagons, little six-sided bee cells.<eos> Brilliant. Why do they make hexagon shapes?<eos> The hexagonal form uses the minimum amount of wax for the maximum amount of storage in a given area.<eos> I'll just finish off this thing. Honey bees have evolved a complex language to tell each other where the best nectar is, using the sun as a reference point.<eos> Amazingly, they can also do this on overcast days and at night by calculating the position of the sun on the other side of the world.<eos> This means they can actually learn and store information.<eos> Has it... Has it occurred to you that they may not be using the sun?<eos> That whoever has worked that out is wrong?<eos> And is now saying even when you can't see it, or it's on the other side of the world, they still use it.
Here're your eggs, boys.<eos> Whites only, tomatoes, no bread.<eos> Cheese omelette, sausages, and a side of pancakes.<eos> Jesus Christ, what the hell is that?<eos> Upside down, looks like some guy's getting his dick stuffed in his mouth.<eos> Right-side up too.<eos> Well, gratuitous man-sex is one thing. Personally, I don't mind it.<eos> We know.<eos> But gratuitous violence, that's another story.<eos> Actually, I don't consider it gratuitous.
A small nuclear device?<eos> It's necessary that we have them.<eos> After what happened the other night, we could've been killed.<eos> Play with this long enough, and you will be.<eos> Would you just hand it... you're not... running around the streets with a concealed weapon.<eos> I told you...<eos> "it's necessary".<eos> So that you and Cody can be the gay avengers, heroes of the resistance.<eos> Martyrs to the cause?<eos> We're trying to stop violence before it happens.
Did everyone forgive you?<eos> So far.<eos> Must make you feel better.<eos> Can't tell you how relieved I am.<eos> Good for you.<eos> But what's reading this letter... Going to do for me?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Will it take away all the damage that's been done?<eos> All the pain that's been inflicted?<eos> Will it make up for my feeling inadequate and helpless?
You don't have to go if you don't want to.<eos> Come on.<eos> Who is it?<eos> The ghost of Christmas past.<eos> Season's greetings.<eos> Trying to get in the spirit for Vic's, uh... never mind.<eos> I just stopped by to tell you that I, uh, read your letter.<eos> Oh, you did?<eos> A few times, actually.<eos> It was very well-written.
I put it in here and I don't see it.<eos> It's not in here.<eos> - Allo.<eos> - Ne quittez pas, hein.<eos> - Un moment, Paul.<eos> - Oui.<eos> No, I can't have lost my Carrie necklace. No.<eos> - Was it insured?<eos> - No, no, it's not like that.<eos> It costs like nothing but it's priceless.
Look I should not have thrown this party without talking to you guys, I know that.<eos> But, it's the way things spun out of control.<eos> It was Lana, well it wasn't Lana exactly...<eos> She was possessed by a witch, who then cast a spell on us, and...<eos> That's how that happened.<eos> Son, I realize that after all, this is Smallville, but witches and spells... and...<eos> Magic?<eos> Dad, magic exists...<eos> I saw it.<eos> And worse, it can hurt me.
Come on, Murph, we've gotta talk to Eric Cartman again!<eos> Why won't anybody listen to me?<eos> ! (Don't take it personally, Kyle)<eos> I AM taking it personally because Cartman is a retard!<eos> Just because he hit his head and went into a coma doesn't mean he's a - Wait, that's it.<eos> If I want people to listen to me, I just have to be as stupid as Cartman.<eos> Dude, I really don't think that's a good idea!<eos> There has to be another way!<eos> Be sure to take me to the same hospital!<eos> Now Kyle, don't fly too close to the sun, or it'll burn your wings, an - and you'll crash into the ocean.
Ah I did.<eos> I wrote something down.<eos> Here it is!<eos> Uh, squiggly line, circle.<eos> I wrote down... all the lyrics to the Happy Days theme song.<eos> You guys, we watched Craig's show all night long.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was great.<eos> No, but don't you see?<eos> We didn't think it was great before.
- It's a function of the new chair design.<eos> Since the gamekeeper incident, the aliens of P7J-989 built in the shut-off command, so only someone in the chair can control it.<eos> You have previously given me this information.<eos> This is different this time, because the game will be learning from you, then incorporating those changes into its programming code.<eos> If you're killed in the game, it will reset and you'll start again.<eos> The chair will only end the game under two conditions:<eos> Once you complete the scenario or if you engage the internal fail-safe, - which you're free to do at any time.<eos> - That will be unnecessary.<eos> Don't be so cocky.<eos> The chair is intuitive. It'll eventually learn everything you know.
But the game doesn't know that.<eos> So how do we get him out?<eos> Removing the connections while the system is operating is potentially fatal.<eos> On the other hand, the physical stress that the chair is putting him under will eventually kill him anyway.<eos> Right now, the only way out is for Teal'c to win the game. - Can he?<eos> - It seems to be getting harder and harder.<eos> Every time it appears he's won, the game adds a new twist.<eos> - So it's not going to let him win.<eos> - No. The chair doesn't have an ego.<eos> It's not trying to beat Teal'c, just provide a challenge that's worthy of his abilities.
- Hello.<eos> - Hi, it's me.<eos> This is Pete.<eos> I'm probably chasing a bad guy.<eos> So what do we got?<eos> Daniel's at his house, setting up video surveillance.<eos> Teal'c's picking out his doughnuts.<eos> He loves a good stakeout.<eos> Jamming device is in the van.<eos> It should prevent Osiris from beaming herself out.
I'm sure there was a memo.<eos> Did you tell them about the time you tried to shut this place?<eos> - Or the time you had Hammond by the...<eos> - I suggest you watch what you say.<eos> - Slander is a serious offence. - Yes.<eos> So I hear.<eos> I have always been a strong supporter of this programme.<eos> I admit I was critical in the past, but only because of the unrealised potential I see this operation as having.<eos> How did your interview go, Colonel?<eos> It was short.
Indeed.<eos> I can't wait to hear what everyone else said.<eos> I did not say much.<eos> Really?<eos> That is surprising.<eos> It's usually so hard to shut you up.<eos> I found the entire experience unpleasant.<eos> - They want to talk to me again.<eos> - Did your interview not go well either?<eos> I thought it was fine, but apparently I looked nervous.
Anna did not set that bomb.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> - The Goa'uld.<eos> Sekhmet.<eos> But wait a minute.<eos> She doesn't have a snake inside of her, right?<eos> It's something we didn't expect.<eos> A separate and distinct personality.<eos> Anna's mind has created a personality that acts like the Goa'uld Sekhmet?<eos> Yes, but I don't know if she is incapable of dealing with the darkness within her, or if that knowledge is so powerful that it is capable of manifesting itself as such.
We're trying to interface these consoles with temporary battery power, see if we can access the city's main power systems and get this place up and running.<eos> Dr. Weir, colonel Sumner.<eos> Can you come down here and meet me, please?<eos> We're three levels down from you.<eos> Right away.<eos> How we doing over there?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Well, let's see what we can do, then.<eos> We've only been able to secure a fraction of the place.<eos> It's huge.
Oh, yeah.<eos> Definitely this way.<eos> - Didn't fly over this, did we?<eos> - I don't know. I was busy trying not to get us killed.<eos> - These ruins are very old.<eos> - Several hundred years, maybe more.<eos> So, the population here's extinct?<eos> - Check this out.<eos> - OK, I give up.<eos> If the disturbance is man-made, it's emanating from within these ruins... somewhere... over there.
- Can it wait?<eos> No.<eos> Something is very wrong here.<eos> I've run a diagnostic on the ZPM.<eos> These are the results I keep getting back.<eos> I'm not a scientist, Rodney.<eos> Neither is anyone else, or they'd have noticed the laws of physics seem to have flown out the window.<eos> Maybe there's a problem with your equipment.<eos> I checked.<eos> It's fine.
I think we could help each other.<eos> I understand.<eos> I shall consult with her now.<eos> Please stay here.<eos> I don't know how long this will take.<eos> Thank you.<eos> "What Athar provides for you?" Are you buying into this?<eos> Rodney, what religious people don't take their religion seriously?<eos> We didn't imagine that weapon.<eos> - We saw what it was capable of.
- Maybe I should tag along...<eos> - I think I got a handle.<eos> - There are a lot of systems you know...<eos> Fine.<eos> Hold still.<eos> Just a minute more.<eos> Well, it seems you're just as lovely on the inside as you are on the out, if health is synonymous with beauty.<eos> You can get up now.<eos> How does this device do what you say it does?<eos> It creates images of the tissues inside your body. - They are picture perfect.
Then I have to say, "we're not getting married," and she kicks me in my shins.<eos> From the knees down, I'm like a frickin' P.O.W.<eos> No, you have magnificent legs.<eos> I would say W.O.W.<eos> Wow.<eos> May I help... oh, it's you.<eos> Hello, Fenton.<eos> You two know each other?<eos> Yeah, this is the weirdo who sold me your ring.<eos> He's probably worn it more than you, so... maybe she doesn't want to wear it because it's from you.
Well, the only problem is I don't have the ring.<eos> What?<eos> Well, when I was mad at you for blowing off the wedding, I threw it off the water tower.<eos> Donna, that ring is a symbol of our eternal love for each other.<eos> You were gonna sell it to finance a year of napping and boozing.<eos> Yeah, that's true,<eos> So...who's wrong here?<eos> I think there's a little something wrong with all of us.<eos> Okay, uh, well, if you threw the ring from up here,<eos> It's gotta be around here somewhere.
Okay, look, I don't wanna start anything, but had you bought Donna a decent-sized diamond, we would have found it by now.<eos> The ring was pretty small, man.<eos> Whenever I saw it, I thought Donna was really far away.<eos> She was standing right next to me.<eos> Yeah, when I first saw it, I said, "Donna, there's dust on your ring."<eos> Then I realized that was the ring.<eos> Guys, guys, stop.<eos> If we don't find it soon, a mosquito's going to eat it.<eos> Okay, I love the ring.<eos> It was petite, not showy.
But, Kelso, I thought you wanted to impress the mother of your child and give your life a purpose and pull over girls for speeding while foxy.<eos> No, I got my reasons.<eos> I mean, I don't want to leave when things are going so good for me and Brooke.<eos> Plus, blue isn't a very good color for me.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> You take blue to a whole new level.<eos> All right, let's go blast some cows.<eos> Whoa. All you talk about is being a cop.<eos> You haven't focused on anything this hard since you thought you heard your name on "Led Zeppelin II."<eos> It's in there.
Perhaps you hardly knew them!<eos> Perhaps you have forgotten!<eos> They're all dead, they've been judged.<eos> Death's an end. That politician, he died.<eos> I wanna go home now.<eos> I'll show you out.<eos> No. it's all right, thank you.<eos> Well... You couldn't hold her.<eos> I know.<eos> 'Looking back at my father's career taught me the value of not flinching 'from a political opinion because it might be unpopular.'
- Now that I slept on it, it's worse.<eos> In the governor's mansion she got $5 allowance for doing a boatload of chores.<eos> - He isn't steering money to his daughter.<eos> - Not the president, us.<eos> Some overeager NIH lackey trying to curry favor. This conversation would be easier were I not fighting through a cloud of Obsession.<eos> There's no cloud.<eos> It's about to precipitate out, rain Obsession.<eos> I've got a brief.<eos> I'll get a breakdown of Foy's funding.<eos> Hope like hell it hasn't gone up since Ellie started working in his lab.
The Center for Disease Control...<eos> When the NIH was founded, the idea was simple: Identify the best research as defined by scientists themselves.<eos> Now these people, who are not even scientists have answered all the questions before any science is done?<eos> Ever seen one of these grant applications?<eos> We're lucky Einstein didn't have to fill one out or God knows what E would equal.<eos> So tell me what you're doing.<eos> Right now, I might as well let loose buzzards in Ellie's apartment for all the good you're doing.<eos> Pretty sure Layton's known about Ellie but she covered her tracks by having Bentley call other researchers.<eos> - What do you propose?<eos> - Make a statement, call it what it is.
Our chief of military intelligence asserts that if Iran completes its enrichment program it will be able to produce nuclear weapons within one year.<eos> No one disputes Israel lives under threat.<eos> Threat?<eos> We are 6 million surrounded by 200 million who wish us obliterated.<eos> For Israel, deterrence is not an option but an imperative.<eos> There's a fine line between deterrence and provocation.<eos> We model our approach on America's during the Cold War.<eos> Mutual assured destruction.<eos> There's a reason its acronym was MAD.<eos> It succeeded entirely in keeping the world safe.
Ma'am, it pains me that you cannot enter your own front door in safety and with dignity.<eos> The truth is, I can't promise you it's gonna get any better.<eos> We can't lock up the thousands out there on the corners.<eos> There'd be no place to put them even if we could.<eos> We show you charts and statistics like they mean something.<eos> But you going back to your homes tonight we gonna be in our patrol cars and them boys still gonna be out there on the corners deep in the game.<eos> This is the world we've got, people and it's about time all of us had the good sense to at least admit that much.<eos> So, what's the answer ?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> But whatever it is it can't be a lie.
And vice versa.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm standing in the cellar.<eos> - Have you found her?<eos> - No.<eos> - Are her things still there?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Her shoes and trousers were soaked but she only took off her coat.<eos> It was crumpled by a chair.<eos> - It's still here.
They're... two and five and seven.<eos> Didn't anybody look after you?<eos> - What happened last night?<eos> - You don't have to answer.<eos> I was feeding my pets when...<eos> Then...<eos> I recognised her.<eos> She was afraid of me.<eos> Was she wearing that ring?<eos> It was my mother's.
It's a little turtle.<eos> Come in?<eos> Oh hello, fine shoppers.<eos> Sir, we just had a big town meeting, and decided we don't want your Wall*Mart here anymore.<eos> We're sorry, but it seems our Main Street is dying and good people are losing their jobs.<eos> We'd all like you... out of South Park.<eos> Well<eos> What? What, you think I want to be here?<eos> I hate this place.<eos> But it... won't let me leave.
"Who is it that asked the question?"<eos> Me. I'm asking the question.<eos> Ah, yes, but who are you?<eos> Stan Marsh.<eos> Now, where's the heart?<eos> Ah. You know the answer, but not the question!<eos> The question is, "Where is the heart?"<eos> Very well.<eos> You want to see the heart of Wall*Mart?<eos> It lies beyond that plasma-screen television.
Get going!<eos> I know you guys' weakness.<eos> Greed told me.<eos> When you guys come into contact with the bones or other remains of the one whose human transmutation was the subject of an attempt at reanimation, you become unable to move.<eos> You guys are imposters.<eos> That's why you cower when faced with the real thing.<eos> In that case, I don't have a weakness.<eos> I was transmuted with the remains of my own body as ingredients, after I was stillborn.<eos> My real body is nowhere to be found.<eos> But if it were, it would be your body!
Geez...<eos> You're hard workers, I'll give you that.<eos> Say, OOniwaka. These guys came to pick on you some more.<eos> Who the hell is that? !<eos> It doesn't matter, take him down, too!<eos> You big freak!<eos> S-Stay away from me, you monster!<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Everyone is afraid of my face.<eos> They say it is ugly.
I'd rather pay more for a steady supply through Liverpool.<eos> We'll all lose in the end.<eos> Thornton's as straight as they come.<eos> He won't risk Malborough Mill, even if it means not speculating.<eos> That's best, surely, with so many lives depending on the factory's success?<eos> Well... that would be the Christian way.<eos> Hear the latest over clamoring for a new wheel? - Thought you'd agreed to it.<eos> - I had.<eos> First, the men threatened to turn out if I didn't install it.<eos> It would've cost me �600. It blows away the strands that fly off in the sorting rooms.
Yeah, I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> How could I have been so selfish?<eos> Look at them.<eos> Those two clearly got it going on.<eos> I've made a decision.<eos> I've got to kiss my pedestal good-bye, cos my girl's happiness comes first.<eos> - Baba. Mama.<eos> - We were admiring the mudan tree.<eos> It's so lovely this year.
The waves go in...<eos> Hit some driftwood.<eos> Jack Byrnes, you are a caged lion.<eos> But lions can't be captives their entire lives.<eos> They have to be free to roam the bush, free and wild.<eos> Your wife is a hot, sexy tigress.<eos> She's waiting for you to pounce on her.<eos> Let me hear you roar, baby, roar.<eos> Your body is talking to me.<eos> It's hungry for action.
The maniac's in the apartment.<eos> You could be the maniac.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> I'Il show you my identification.<eos> - Can you see it? - No!<eos> I can't.<eos> Waita second.<eos> Now you can see it.<eos> Anyone can get one.<eos> It's a fake!
He's the holy Half-Dead who has seen the UnderVerse.<eos> Look, I'm not with everyone here.<eos> But I will take a piece of him.<eos> A piece you will have.<eos> Stop him!<eos> Irgun.<eos> One of my best.<eos> If you say so.<eos> What do you think of this blade?<eos> I think it's a half-gram heavy on the back end.
Riddick!<eos> What is this?<eos> What is he thinking?<eos> -Once that sun comes up... -We'll last five minutes.<eos> Five minutes.<eos> We ain't gonna last 30 seconds out there.<eos> It'll light you up like a match.<eos> 20-mile buffer zone and 30 klicks to the hangar.<eos> 30 klicks, over that terrain?<eos> It's moving in the right direction.
- Donkey?<eos> You're a...<eos> - A stallion, baby!<eos> I can whinny.<eos> I can count.<eos> Look at me, Shrek!<eos> I'm trotting!<eos> That's some quality potion.<eos> What's in that stuff?<eos> "Oh, don't take the potion, Mr Boss, it's very bad."
You're a sissy if you don't go with us.<eos> When I was on a farm at that age I actually didn't belong to farm kid groups, but my brother did.<eos> And there were a lot of other kinds of groups like that that prepared you to be a farmer.<eos> One of the most common projects is raising like a heffer or a pig or a steer or something for show.<eos> Then they go to the state fair and show these animals and they win ribbons.<eos> You see these kids that spend so much time with these animals and really get attached to them almost like pets.<eos> And then comes the time when they have to part ways with that animal.<eos> They have to go to slaughter. They have to go to auction.<eos> And often it's very traumatic for these kids.<eos> Even though you've been close to this animal, you've groomed it and maybe slept with it for weeks it has to go to market.
They're shooting everywhere and you ask why.<eos> Don't you watch TV?<eos> It's all lies.<eos> It won't happen, woman.<eos> Folks are reasonable here.<eos> The way you talk isn't reasonable.<eos> Me?<eos> What's wrong with you today?<eos> Veljo left a letter for Milos.<eos> It may be from Belgrade.
- Good, good, good, good, good.<eos> Okay, you can put your shirt on.<eos> So I understand that you read to Miss Hamilton.<eos> Yeah, to help her remember.<eos> - You don't think it'll help?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> She remembers, Doc.<eos> I read to her and she remembers.<eos> Not always, but she remembers.<eos> But senile dementia is irreversible. It's degenerative.
He's bleeding!<eos> Look!<eos> Blood!<eos> Leave me alone you little satans!<eos> Aha!<eos> Cursing!<eos> Are you cursed?<eos> He's cursed!<eos> Yes, a curse!<eos> It's inside him, look!
I should have known!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> In what she would refer to as her "Milly Expedition", the sun, the sky and nature are with her.<eos> As a true lady, she made every effort to look her best.<eos> Dressed in white for freshness, lipstick for the occasion, eyebrows shaped.<eos> But none of that black which lengthens the eyelashes.<eos> She knows that tears can make a mess of it.<eos> He knows about your visit.<eos> We said a young girl he'd dearly loved was coming here.<eos> He asked your name and found it very beautiful.
Thank you, Grandma.<eos> Calcifer.<eos> Sophie...<eos> I'm all worn out.<eos> If I give Howl's heart back, will it kill you?<eos> Probably not, if you do it, Sophie.<eos> After all, we both survived the water you dumped on me.<eos> I'd better try, then.<eos> It's all warm and fluttery like a little bird.<eos> It's still only a child's heart.
He was gonna take you away from me!<eos> - ( gun cocks ) - Step away!<eos> Don't worry, alice, I've been where you are. Oh yeah?<eos> We're gonna get out of here.<eos> I wouldn't go out there if I were you.<eos> alice: Upstairs!<eos> Quick! Quick! Hurry!<eos> What the hell is out there?<eos> The monster.<eos> ( howIing ) ( glass breaks ) It's in the house?
Tip of the cap to you as well, Miss Corningstone.<eos> I'm having very strong feelings for you, Mr. Burgundy.<eos> But it's very important to me that I be viewed as a professional.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> When in Rome.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That, uh, expression doesn't really apply to what I'm talking about.<eos> - Oh, I'm... - What I was saying.<eos> I still don't quite understand what it means.
I suggest We just eat, and talk about something else,<eos> Honestly, the beach? ,!<eos> God have mercy, What are We, Christians? ,!<eos> Eliyahu, Eliyahu,<eos> Did you know my dad's an expert at aging meat? , Tell him, dad,<eos> -Forget it, really,<eos> -Go on, tell him, Tell him Pini,<eos> -You ever aged some meat, Eliyahu? ,<eos> You should know there are some sacred rules, When you put the fillet in a bowl, take your time, and remember:<eos> too much time, it rots, Too little, and it's rock hard,
The future of our race rests with you.<eos> You fought with honor.<eos> I respect that.<eos> Allow me a parting gift.<eos> But remember this:<eos> Sooner or later the thirst always wins.<eos> And Blade?<eos> The virus didn't kill him.<eos> Because he was a hybrid, his heart never stopped beating.<eos> It simply slowed down.
Let her go!<eos> Brake!<eos> There's treasure up there.<eos> Mum? Mum? Is it you?<eos> No, Mum!<eos> Wait for me!<eos> Are you there?<eos> Don't go! Mum! What time is it?<eos> This precious ring belongs to my mother who's missing.<eos> I know it's worth a lot but ne ver mind.
You`re worse than Martin.<eos> - Never make judgments about people.<eos> - l wasn`t.<eos> Your body posture told me that my list of ailments made you uncomfortable.<eos> Maybe it did.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maintaining a nonjudgmental attitude is harder than you think.<eos> The best way is to smile, nod your head, while looking me directly in the eye.<eos> Your health as a boy.<eos> It improved greatly when I finally discovered the outdoors.
Is that--?<eos> That's the--<eos> That was around his neck, right?<eos> Am I right?<eos> -Am I right?<eos> -Yes, yes.<eos> You did that on purpose?<eos> All right, I'm doing my best here, all right?<eos> That man's face was half gone!<eos> I couldn't even-- It didn't even look human.
Mrs Margaret... "<eos> Mrs Hughes. Is this you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You? A woman?<eos> Performed in a play?<eos> In a public theatre against the order of the Crown?<eos> As His Grace said, it's not a real theatre.<eos> It's more a sort of tavern, and hence, outside...<eos> I am the First Minister, Mrs Hughes.<eos> Mrs Hughes. This performance of yours, was it too a one-off?
When I reached the section lives of workers workers from the factories.<eos> I felt how I started breathe more slowly.<eos> How scary it was, Hate on the pages.<eos> Then I came back again to previous section to try to figure out not what I was before.<eos> Weird, disturbing or ugly phrases cult to mainstream products.<eos> I tried to tell them these phrases, but I can say to understand that my entire life must be totally changed.<eos> He explains that every single thing depending on the types, expressed by its value.<eos> This cup of coffee, this time, this coat.<eos> Everything has its value or is part of something else.<eos> We say that the coat is not part this kind of stuff because we believe that the coat even doubt that piece of clothing it has its own soul this is a cult idol. live spirit.

Then it died. I thought I can not go.<eos> I thought, why not kill me.<eos> But no.<eos> So that left the children, with my parents. I left town.<eos> And I walk in to the mountains and found the rebels.<eos> Sitting in a cafe the in a wealthy part of town. Seem does it what I've seing and heared could impossibly be happening.<eos> Back home, I went back normal life.<eos> But I can not detect how everything seemed different.<eos> Initially I tried To ignore this feeling manner and ignore some symptoms to heal.<eos> But it did not go away.
Look, if you wanted to leave me behind, you shouldn't have told me where you were going.<eos> Clear.<eos> What the...<eos> Now we're getting somewhere.<eos> They're digital scans of letters to the editor of The New England Courant.<eos> Written 1722.<eos> They're all from the same person.<eos> "Your humble servant, Silence Dogood. "<eos> Gentlemen... why is this word capitalised?<eos> Because it's important?
What are you doing here?<eos> Georgianna went a half hour ago.<eos> You're gonna miss it. Put that on my tab.<eos> Your bill.<eos> "Tab" sounds like y'all might pay it someday.<eos> Time was never a friend to Bobby Long.<eos> It would conspire against him... allow him to believe in a generous nature, then rob him blind every time.
Little Purslane.<eos> Look, you come back and see old Tiny again, all right?<eos> And the Shirley Temples on the house.<eos> See you later, man.<eos> You were really in Lorraine's band?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I mean, everybody was at that time.<eos> That's just how it was. Lorraine and me... we were close at one time.<eos> I remember the last time she wore that dress.<eos> It looks just as pretty on you.
And is it good?<eos> It's delicious.<eos> Don't laugh.<eos> Now!<eos> Oh, thank you Be as in Bell, Ri as in Ring, Van as in Van!<eos> Thank you Alice!<eos> Do you have a nickname too?<eos> I call her--<eos> The birthday menu?<eos> Yes.. but does it cost more?
She will wait.<eos> She's very insistent.<eos> She is a whore and she will wait!<eos> It's a made hand!<eos> I was not good in the play this afternoon.<eos> I craved reassurance.<eos> All I could think about was you.<eos> You see, that is where there is still imbalance between us.<eos> Because you demand so much of me and so little of yourself.<eos> You took my small gift and polished it until it shone.
Wonderful.<eos> It's a shame I didn't go back there.<eos> And your family?<eos> My father is from Jerusalem and my mother from Nablus.<eos> I'm sure there aren't many Jewish people there.<eos> He's Palestinian.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Me.<eos> Try on this dress.<eos> It's yours.
My father is from Jerusalem and my mother from Nablus.<eos> I'm sure there aren't many Jewish people there.<eos> He's Palestinian.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Me.<eos> Try on this dress.<eos> It's yours.<eos> - I don't want it anymore.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - It's too small.
We've gotta get out of here.<eos> - Why? What does that mean?<eos> - It's electrical.<eos> The storm, it's electrical.<eos> If lightning hits anything, it'll be the plane.<eos> - The plane's not grounded.<eos> - I don't understand your problem.<eos> You don't understand?<eos> That wing is full of fuel.<eos> - My God, it'll explode. - Come on.
-Hey, Dad.<eos> -Hey, stranger.<eos> -What's the occasion?<eos> -I just came from a job interview.<eos> Really, how'd it go?<eos> Good, I think.<eos> -Yeah?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Dad, that is so great.<eos> Here's what I learned in Bio: If the seed is planted too deep, it doesn't warm up in time.

- I see...<eos> My wife Inger and I wonder if you'd care to come to our home for dinner.<eos> Thank you, but I prefer to be alone.<eos> Perhaps he could hold a concert here in the village.<eos> I've stopped performing!<eos> Though the church is really very beautiful.<eos> There's Conny from the garage with my gun.<eos> I saw your car, and thought...<eos> Here's your gun.<eos> I've checked it out, it works fine now.
No, it wasn't just that, to give him a surprise...<eos> I haven't found any idea for a gift... here at least, there's no risk... you're sure to have a good time...<eos> We have to leave now.<eos> If you want...if you want, you just have to close the door If you want, I'll go ask someone else... someone who doesn't have a train to catch...<eos> I'll tell him that it's urgent, that he has to come right away, that there's someone calling for help and that I don't know what to do.<eos> ...Or maybe, maybe we could pretend I was someone else,<eos> that I'd been looking for me, and that I'd come running... that's why, because I'd run, that's why I was breathing hard, and my heart was pounding,<eos> it's not because I was afraid... and you, you aren't afraid either,<eos> and if you close the door, maybe it could look a little bit like it A little?<eos> ...It won't stop pounding...
Well, the president, he launched air strikes against Canada, but...<eos> I have to be honest with you, it... it doesn't really ease the pain in losing a father.<eos> NARRATOR: After America's neutrality during the Second World War in Europe,<eos> Britain and France joined other summit nations in calling for sanctions against the C.S.<eos> JOHNSON: The summit nations imposed a world embargo against the Confederate States.<eos> Any notion of a war with Canada was dismissed.<eos> The C.S. Retreated into isolation.<eos> There was rationing.<eos> Only the nation of South Africa remained a loyal ally.<eos> The success of the embargo would lead many to quietly question, "Is it worth it?"
- I really don't think this is a good idea.<eos> The honor and integrity of our entire subject is at stake here.<eos> Alright, alright, I'll do it.<eos> Excuse me, have you got the time please?<eos> I make it half past seven. What time do you make it?<eos> - You already know the time.<eos> - I know my time.<eos> Are you trying to be funny?<eos> Time's not a universal quantity.<eos> We used to think that it was, we used to think that it was just there, marching on at the same pace for everyone everywhere, like a railway track that stretched to infinity.
A great tomato sauce.<eos> I greedily ate the lot while he cried in desperation.<eos> But I think he survived going hungry that day.<eos> - I've really enjoyed myself.<eos> - So have I.<eos> A famous financier said that when someone knows a secret it isn't a secret anymore.<eos> This is my unmentionable secret.<eos> And it's not the only one.<eos> Respectable society tends to oversimplify drugs dividing the world into addicts and non-addicts.<eos> It doesn't take into account the many intermediate stages.
Pretty spooky stuff.<eos> Ah, what a nice night!<eos> It's downhill, so I might as well run.<eos> What a strange guy.<eos> But did you see him levitate?<eos> Sometimes chi just comes out by itself after you unblock it.<eos> Or was it his chi?<eos> Actually, I did a Palm Blast back there.<eos> Why'd you shoot at the window?<eos> It's broken again!
The fridge of those friendly people.<eos> I've had enough of it.<eos> They drank all our liquor.<eos> They are drunk as a fiddler.<eos> They ate all our food.<eos> Are you bringing them home too?<eos> - But they're handicapped.<eos> I don't want to hear another word about it.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Our father who art in heaven, Hallowed be thy name, thy kingdom come... on earth as it is in heaven...
So the real smart motherfuckers had to hide the fact that they were smart.<eos> The law of the land was, if you read, you die.<eos> If you read, fucking die, OK?<eos> So you know what that means?<eos> The first black drug dealers didn't even sell drugs.<eos> They sold books.<eos> "Yo, man, I got two pages, man, got two pages, man, check it out, man.<eos> "Yo, man, I got a word, check it out, man, I got a new word.<eos> "I got a new word, man.<eos> It's new, man, it's new, man."
Ain't no happiness nowhere.<eos> Married and bored or single and lonely.<eos> That's right.<eos> Marriage is some boring-ass shit.<eos> Once you get married, you gotta hang around other married people and that's just disgusting.<eos> You ever go to dinner with six neutered adults?<eos> A bunch of women talking about Diaper Genies and hair colouring.<eos> "You know, if you leave it in too long it stings." Shut the fuck up.<eos> A bunch of men talking about barbecue grills and routes to work.<eos> "Sometimes I take the highway but if it's backed up, I got some side streets "that get me there in half the time.
You certainly know how to make an entrance.<eos> That's nothing, scarecrow.<eos> He's gonna kick your ass so hard...<eos> I think not.<eos> - What do you say?<eos> - Call off your lap dog... before his trying to impress you gets him killed.<eos> Am I so obvious?<eos> Call it what you want, but tell him to stand down, now.<eos> You'll have to excuse Junner's excitement.<eos> It sometimes makes him a touch... quick.
But what they didn't know, was that the bottle was the best selling shampoo on the market.<eos> Barry had challenged Matt to a scooter race in which they would sprint down one aisle and up the next.<eos> They would do all 14 alleys and then back to the starting line.<eos> They had been waiting for the day the manager called in sick.<eos> The art of doing something else other than the work you're supposed to do is addictive.<eos> The excitement of doing something that you shouldn't be doing along with the consequences if you're caught doing it are so strong that it often pulls others away from their own art.<eos> On your marks... get set... go!<eos> When you've perfected the art of placing your mind somewhere esle, eight hours will go as fast as this.<eos> Time manipulation is not a precise science.<eos> Like any art, it's personal to the individual.
Shit outdoors?<eos> Yep<eos> For some reason there were lots of wild chickens out there maybe they flew the coop, dunno, but kinda having no money,<eos> And on that day of my first outdoor shit, I didn't go to the bathroom all day<eos> Even after school, I was wandering about, looking for a good spot<eos> I ended up going to the forest, but still couldn't decide where to do it<eos> It's surprising how much you struggle in spite of wanting to go for it, y'know?<eos> Anyway, I soon came across this egg<eos> It was half buried in the ground, like somebody had tried to hide it<eos> It was weird, but somehow gave me the impetus And I badly needed to go
I've never seen... so many beautiful clothes at once<eos> I'm so sorry, I think it confused me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Go ahead and choose a week's worth of shoes and clothing and take it.<eos> And then...<eos> "Just in case it cools down,"<eos> "why don't you choose a coat, too,"<eos> said Tony Takitani.<eos> She chose a grey cashmere coat that looked warm.<eos> It was as light as a feather.
It must really hurt.<eos> Soo-kyung.<eos> Do you recognize me now?<eos> I'll sell the house.<eos> What?<eos> Sell the house!<eos> I'm happy you're back to your old self!<eos> - Have you seen a ghost before?<eos> - I have!<eos> - What does it look like?
He doesn't seem like a bad person to me<eos> - Wait outside - Yes, sir<eos> Well, you're free from the homicide charge<eos> So how was she?<eos> You liked forcing her, right?<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Don't smile<eos> Your favorite plant over there...<eos> I knew you'd come back so I took good care of it<eos> It looks healthy, doesn't it?
- Can I join in?<eos> - No.<eos> I was fed up with Ingun and especially with Elin.<eos> Couldn't they make out with someone besides Andy?<eos> She was living a fantasy, and no one... out of our class... knew that better than me.<eos> I had no one else.<eos> Should I let my family distract me?<eos> Did you hear what Selma learned today?<eos> - Selma, what about your body?<eos> - It's dazzling.
- No.<eos> I was fed up with Ingun and especially with Elin.<eos> Couldn't they make out with someone besides Andy?<eos> She was living a fantasy, and no one... out of our class... knew that better than me.<eos> I had no one else.<eos> Should I let my family distract me?<eos> Did you hear what Selma learned today?<eos> - Selma, what about your body?<eos> - It's dazzling.<eos> And it's so into development!
This was a sign.<eos> And not only that, you're putting on weight.<eos> I'd be spared all this nonsense.<eos> What a terrible world... where I could never fit in.<eos> They needed a well-deserved punishment.<eos> They'd regret all their foul deeds!<eos> Everybody.<eos> But my salvation was near --- it's true what they say.<eos> The rescue is at the end, or it's not a real rescue.<eos> You can recognize a real rescue because it comes at the end.
It's weird.<eos> Part of me always knew life would end after high school.<eos> I was very popular, you know.<eos> The whole golden years thing.<eos> I don't remember what it was like, being human.<eos> It was too long ago.<eos> Not so great.<eos> Zits, dandruff, mortality.<eos> Although, I do remember... my heart.<eos> And the way it would thump when I kissed a really hot boy for the first time.
An urn, actually. It's a morbid thing.<eos> It doesn't really go with my decor.<eos> He's trapped.<eos> Let him rot.<eos> Urns tend to break.<eos> Long-lost enemies tend to return.<eos> I need finality to my affairs.<eos> Do you know what an Orlon Window is, Angel?<eos> It's a fascinating little spell.<eos> It allows warlocks such as myself... to see the past as it once was.
- Oh, that doesn't make a lick of sense.<eos> Why would Angel want to spring an Old One?<eos> - I don't think that was the point.<eos> - Then what was?<eos> Before he died, the assassin said something about a sacrifice.<eos> Someone... trusted and dear.<eos> Are you saying... that Angel was responsible for what happened to Fred?<eos> I mean, he may not have...<eos> chosen her specifically, but...<eos> Whoa.! Let's put a kibosh on that sentence before it turns into an ass-kickin'
- Drogyn should stay here, under guard.<eos> - I'm not missing the fireworks.<eos> Hey, Illyria.<eos> You don't... care about any of this nonsense, do you?<eos> The intricacies of your fates are meaningless.<eos> Well and good.<eos> You mind watchin' over our friend Drogyn?<eos> Aw, come on.<eos> New place will do you good.<eos> It's nice and cozy.
Janine.<eos> Don't, Richard.<eos> Er, the Lemon wants you, boss.<eos> Right.<eos> Sir?<eos> "Release Mrs Tulley."<eos> Is there a part of that sentence you don't understand?<eos> We've got the clothes, sir.<eos> And a confession.<eos> It'll fly if CPS like it.
- That's good. That's the last thing I want.<eos> Not a big enough dipstick for the job.<eos> Attention, DCT 14, report to port hanger bay.<eos> Attention, DCT 14, report to port hanger bay.<eos> I'll be in the squadron ready room.<eos> Hey.<eos> Does your father know you're still breathing?<eos> I'll let him know.<eos> What is it about this place?<eos> What's it doing to me?
Maybe now you understand why... I keep everything about myself secret.<eos> The street is the one place I can earn my own respect.<eos> "He will battle for love in the palace of jade. "<eos> Two out of three.<eos> Two out of three what?<eos> Prophecies.<eos> Look out!<eos> Clever.<eos> Careful with that body of his.<eos> It's priceless.
Look out below!<eos> - Louis!<eos> - Just trying my newest idea:<eos> Waterproof mousse!<eos> How do you like it?<eos> So that's me, Charlie Carbone.<eos> The one with the beautiful girl, all the money I could ever want and my best friend Louis who saved my life more times than he'll ever know.<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> The movie is called Kangaroo Jack!<eos> It should end with me!
"They said you might be going to try to run away,"<eos> "so when I discovered you'd hidden yourself away on my truck,"<eos> I didn't have no choice but to bring you back to Dogville.<eos> In the freight industry we can't take sides.<eos> "It didn't help Grace that the first theft ever registered in Dogville had taken place the previous evening," when most people were assembled for the town meeting.<eos> Old Tom Edison Senior had a considerable sum of money stolen from his medicine closet<eos> "and suspicion soon fell on Grace," who had apparently been planning an escape that would surely require funding.<eos> Grace chose to remain silent in the face of these new charges.<eos> "And then Bill, who had lately improved his engineering skills to an astonishing degree," "had, by way of his first design, implemented a kind of escape prevention mechanism."<eos> "Beautiful it might not have been, but effective he dared say it was."
We had a proper sietch.<eos> I owned a chrysknife. My own share of spice.<eos> I was a rider of worms.<eos> And then Muad'dib came... with his witch mother. And he promised to fulfill Liet's prophesy.<eos> And we followed.<eos> - You joined his jihad? - Do you know why?<eos> I heard there was a thing called a sea.<eos> Men came back from Muad'dib's wars, and they said they had seen it.<eos> And did you find your sea?<eos> It healed me of jihad.
According to our investigators, this one was killed here on Arrakis... the body recovered after the unfortunate conflict... between Houses Atreides and Harkonnen.<eos> Terrible wounds required many months of regrowth by Tleilaxu technicians.<eos> We acquired him as a gift befitting an emperor.<eos> What is your name, ghola?<eos> They say it was Duncan Idaho.<eos> Idaho is dead!<eos> This thing... is a horror!<eos> Send him away!<eos> And do you enjoy the name?<eos> It stirs up curious feelings.
-What time are you gonna pick me up?<eos> -l'm not going.<eos> What?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> That place is gonna be crawling with rich people.<eos> People who pay legal fees with money, not with fish.<eos> Or with wheels of cheese.<eos> Or with sports supplies.<eos> I'm gonna fill you in on a secret. This place doesn't look like a law office.<eos> It looks like the set of Sanford and Son.
Dusty's a bullhorner. A zealot who's OD'd on too many good causes.<eos> You know, the original plan was probably for Dusty to release the tape after Gale's conviction.<eos> You know, after a year or so.<eos> It'd force him to dry out, give him back his dignity.<eos> So Dusty Wright is sitting on this tape, waiting.<eos> And he's the only one who knows about it.<eos> So Dusty starts to think that an erroneous execution is a lot more politically useful than a last-minute save.<eos> Because a last-minute save would only prove the system works.<eos> Almost-martyrs don't count.<eos> Dusty's thinking, "What's one murder if it stops thousands?"
I don't play, Enode, I explore.<eos> You're waste of time.<eos> Our only duty is to serve the gods, Kaena.<eos> They protect us.<eos> Come on, hurry up! We'll be late for the offering. Protect us....<eos> They're not doing such a great job..<eos> Here they come!<eos> Monster.<eos> It steals our sap and keeps us thirsty.<eos> It has turned our planet to a wasteland
- Come on, Kaena!<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> There is another world out there.<eos> And I'm going to find it.<eos> I'm sorry, Grand Priest, there is no sign of her.<eos> May the will of the gods be done.<eos> Hail to you, gods of my people!<eos> Was our offering accepted?<eos> No!<eos> It was not acceptable.
Then I was really...going up?<eos> Below is above and above is below!<eos> Ilpo was right.<eos> You saved him.<eos> I only dressed his wounds.<eos> As I did for many other creatures of Axis.<eos> - So that's where the blue sun is.<eos> - Blue sun?<eos> Yes, I've dreamt it so many times.<eos> It's down there, at the roots of Axis.
How was Hooters?<eos> I actually didn't go to Hooters.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Skittles?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Listen.<eos> I got a call from Manetti.<eos> He tells me that your Sunshine Square proposal is totally fucked.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Well, for one thing, it violates the zoning restrictions set forth in the National Historical Preservation Act of 1966.
Carter's working with a partner.<eos> They're selling the list tonight.<eos> We'll take care of them and then find Dylan.<eos> - See you, Bos.<eos> - Yeah, all right, all right.<eos> This is some bullshit.<eos> - Kelly Garrett.<eos> - Hello, Dylan.<eos> Don't you have a case to solve?<eos> Well, I tried to outrun my past, but it caught up with me yesterday.
We've been wondering why you're always alone.<eos> I don't really know anybody.<eos> How come you're chained to the gates?<eos> I'm not chained to the gates.<eos> - You're awfully clean.<eos> - What?<eos> For someone who likes the cinema so much.<eos> - Do you know Jacques?<eos> - Jacques?<eos> "If shit could shit, it would smell just like Jacques."
And the cinematheque?<eos> Closed until further notice.<eos> Papa, can't you see we have a guest?<eos> - This is Matthew.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - Matthew.<eos> Matthew's dining with us tonight.<eos> My young Matthew, inspiration is like a baby.<eos> It does not choose a nice, seemly hour to enter the world.

I know.

- Her name is Lily.<eos> Booster, have I ever referred to you as honey?<eos> Have I, scooter?<eos> It's a common mistake that Jake is making when he says ADD.<eos> What he really means is ADHD, for Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, see?<eos> The important word is the H, Hyperactivity. I don't understand, why do you let her do that if you care about her?<eos> It's poison, see?<eos> Feel my heart.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I bet it beats twice as fast as yours.
I tell ya, the devil's at the wheel of that there phantom ship.<eos> You better hold fast.<eos> What is it with this man?<eos> Did I kill a relative of his in battle, perhaps?<eos> His boy, God forbid?<eos> He fights like you, Jack.<eos> Bring the sun down to the horizon.<eos> When its lower limb is touching the horizon...<eos> Williamson, look to your sextant.<eos> When the orb is no longer rising, then it has reached its zenith and that would be noon.
You wanted to see me?<eos> Mr. Cable called me last night in a bit of a panic.<eos> Now, he's concerned that someone's trying to monkey with ourjury.<eos> As am I. As are my associates.<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - It's a parlor game.<eos> Just because somebody can influence where a jury has lunch doesn't mean they can hand us the verdict.<eos> Well, this is where I get a little confused. Because I was under the impression that we had already purchased ourselves a verdict.<eos> You know what I love best about this gun?<eos> It's over 70 years old, just as reliable as the day it was made.
No.<eos> You just ensure that his wife goes to the cemetery in a better car.<eos> That the heel that she snaps on the way to the graveside belongs to a $1200 shoe. And you get your name in the paper.<eos> But Jacob Wood and all the other gun-violence victims remain rotting in their crypts.<eos> You know what, Fitch? - You're gonna lose.<eos> - I doubt it.<eos> Well, maybe not this case, maybe not the next, but someday.<eos> I've seen it before with guys like you.<eos> - You wanna know why?<eos> Because you cannot carry that much contempt without it becoming malignant.
Wendy.<eos> We can't both have her, lady.<eos> John?<eos> Michael?<eos> Wendy?<eos> The window's closed.<eos> George! George, help me. - What is it?<eos> Have they returned?<eos> -The window is closed.<eos> It must always be open for them. Always.
Boy, pubic hair was just not an issue when I was dating.<eos> The ladies, uh, never complained when they were... you know, down in that general area.<eos> Okay, if you never mention that ever again, that'd be great.<eos> You're right. No, no, no. Okay.<eos> Shouldn't have brought it up.<eos> Maybe...<eos> So, can I see the ring?<eos> Nope.<eos> Promised to keep it safe.<eos> It's not leaving my pocket.
- Do you have the documents?<eos> - The money first.<eos> It's all here?<eos> A third.<eos> It was agreed upon.<eos> Very well, this is for you.<eos> - And the rest?<eos> - The rest another time.<eos> You just saw my sister.<eos> Take this letter, it concerns her.
You don't care.<eos> - You've never had an ounce of faith. - I confess, I confess.<eos> You confess lies.<eos> That's what you confess.<eos> There, there, there.<eos> Nicole, darling.. let's not fight.<eos> I mean, it's only a few days.<eos> Nobody in the whole world knows that I am here.<eos> What about your picture?<eos> It was in the paper.
He sends you his best.<eos> He can't come, he's on a plane.<eos> We're all thinking of you, dear.<eos> Happy Birthday!<eos> Feel better, Hubus?<eos> Much better.<eos> [ Skipped item nr. 127 ] I love your name.<eos> Why? You think it's funny?<eos> Not at all.<eos> It sounds like it comes from your eyeball.
Okay!<eos> (on phone) Hullo?<eos> Help one of my friends to locate a building.<eos> A grand one!<eos> Yeah!<eos> For what?<eos> To commit suicide.<eos> Where you'll die with one jump!<eos> Not shoddy.<eos> It has to be grand.
Don't talk rubbish!<eos> Optimism is only for the rich!<eos> Lately in the hospital, I've been thinking<eos> Have you heard of this poem?<eos> Ten years of meditation, will grant you a fellow passenger on a boat ride<eos> Hundred years of meditation, will grant you a partner to share your pillow<eos> Royston, don't follow my footsteps<eos> You have to learn not to take anything for granted.<eos> Before it's too late.<eos> You will not feel happiness when it is in your grasp
Despite my misfortune, I was lucky.<eos> The doctors always say that.<eos> Two millimeters more and I'd have lost both arms.<eos> Anyway, that's how things always work.<eos> Well, almost always.<eos> I even met a woman.<eos> Her name's Patrizia. I want you to see her.<eos> I have a photo.<eos> It was taken of us at a party.<eos> It's in here.
It had a broken neck, with the skin stripped back from its head.<eos> But the weird thing was it was sort of hidden like, in a bush.<eos> Definitely cat kill, Henry.<eos> How do we know it wasn't dogs?<eos> Dogs don't kill like that.<eos> - Pint, there, Doc.<eos> - Please.<eos> They're cowards.<eos> They hunt in packs.<eos> Bring an animal down from the rear, gorge themselves, leave it where it falls.
See you.<eos> Aargh!<eos> Put me in a ring with a farmer.<eos> Scum.<eos> - My dad's a farmer.<eos> - Figures.<eos> Feeling better?<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you hyperventilate, the body gets starved of carbon dioxide.<eos> By breathing in the bag, you're simply using up carbon dioxide that the body didn't think it wanted.
Urgent news!<eos> - Tae-il from Kang High...<eos> - What about him?<eos> He went to the boss of the market area and asked him to take him in.<eos> - For real?<eos> - But the boss told Il-mae's dad on him and now he's getting his ass whipped.<eos> Pants down!<eos> On your stomach!<eos> Do you guys hear my heart?<eos> It's crying out in pain.
No way!<eos> I'd rather starve to death.<eos> You won't starve.<eos> They're experts at taking care of people and making food.<eos> Their kitchen's fantastic.<eos> Excuse me, but I reserve the right to have my doubts.<eos> You shouldn't be in doubt.<eos> They're experts.<eos> You want a beer, just call. And bang!<eos> It's standing in front of you.
Tell me what the problem is, I'm in a hurry.<eos> The back wheel wiggles.<eos> - Okay, let's fix it.<eos> - No, not now.<eos> The funeral is in 10 minutes.<eos> I'll be done in 3 minutes.<eos> You can leave the body there.<eos> Lift it up, please.<eos> That's it.<eos> Every time you guys fix it, it breaks again.
he took it very well.<eos> I must have lowered myself about 25m from where the ice screw was at the bridge.<eos> I was now in what seemed to be the base of the crevice, that was shaped like a big hourglass.<eos> To the ceiling, was probably about 50m.<eos> I think it's as big as the St. Paul's dome in scale.<eos> I remember looking down, and there was just solid snow.<eos> And I thought, "this is the bottom of the crevice!"<eos> About 15m away from me, there was a slope leading up.<eos> Right at the top, there was the sun coming through this hole.<eos> And it was shining, just this big beam of sunlight coming in.
And I could see the stars.<eos> I can remember lying on my back for what seemed endless periods of time, staring at the stars.<eos> At one point I had this weird sensation that I had been lain there, conscious, for centuries, for lifetimes.<eos> Becoming part of the rocks, and part of where I was never gonna move from.<eos> The sun came up, and it started to warm me.<eos> And I thought it'd be just so nice to just lie there, don't move, and never hurt, and christ, I got so, so close to doing that.<eos> I genuinely believed that I wouldn't make the distance, and I also believed that I was going to die, and I sort of acknowledged it in a very matter-of-fact way.<eos> And it seemed very rational to keep on crawling, if you didn't think it was gonna be of any good.<eos> I think that it was that loneliness, that sense of being abandoned.<eos> It was there all the time.
Girls are like mirrors.<eos> You see yourself, your dimples and your pimples.<eos> Like buses, like mirrors, like nooses.<eos> The tighter the knot, the harder you get. -What?<eos> Yeah. Men getting hanged have a hard-on.<eos> That's science.<eos> What do you keep looking at?<eos> The sky.<eos> Why?<eos> Sometimes it's blue, sometimes it's clear.
- Up to you.<eos> If you want, I'm a... all yours.<eos> Nice pants, your mommy get you those?<eos> God rest her soul, hallowed be her memory.<eos> I could just cry. - 20 years ago, on a trip to Greece, she got me these.<eos> With her sister Miriam, my aunt. She passed away two years ago. My m... mother, not my aunt.<eos> I wore them to the funeral, and lo...<eos> lo... - Lolobrigida.<eos> Long after.<eos> - Don't get offended, I like your stutter, I find it sexy.
Nobody here would take it.<eos> No, it's gone.<eos> Now that your work is done, I thought you'd be singing, Poirot.<eos> I am content to return to London, mon ami, but I do not like the unfinished business.<eos> - The letter!<eos> - Oui<eos> Well, perhaps you wanted it to be more than it was.<eos> I promise you, they have other things to think about now.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Even so, I return this letter with reluctance and only because it is not my property.
Angel?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - It worked.<eos> - Did it?<eos> - Fred.<eos> - What?<eos> You came down the stairs.<eos> You had blood and I grabbed...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - The spell, it worked.
Did he hurt you?<eos> No. No, you stopped him.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. Oh, God, thank you so much.<eos> Thank...<eos> CORDELIA: She's perfect.<eos> Did you get everything else?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what your heart is telling you, Connor.<eos> But it will lie to you if you let it.
But the big stuff, like two vampires squeezing out a kid...<eos> - Connor.<eos> - An impossible birth to make one possible.<eos> - That's what the kid was designed for.<eos> - To sleep with Mother Love?<eos> - To create a vessel.<eos> Look out, the monkey's thinking again.<eos> Being in a human makes it vulnerable.<eos> That's why it had to stay hidden.<eos> Why it needed to create something stronger to pour itself into.
- How do we stop it?<eos> SKIP: That's the easy part, slick.<eos> All you gotta do is find Cordelia and chop her head off.<eos> - Has to be another way.<eos> SKIP:<eos> Sure. Stab her in the heart, kidney. - Couple of pokes in the...<eos> - A way that won't kill her in the process.<eos> Takes a whole lot of cramming to get that much sweetness into a human.<eos> It's in every hair, every cell, every molecule of Cordelia's body.<eos> And it ain't letting go until it got a brand-new bag.
The scope works along amplified thermal wavelengths.<eos> Girl... you're making me so hot right now.<eos> Wow.<eos> Turned on by a woman holding an enormous gun.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> We replaced the delivery system with a balantine energy charge... eliminating the need for conventional ammunition.<eos> Wolfram and Hart has 200 units ready now.<eos> We'll begin making more once we receive payment.<eos> And your boss doesn't mind selling this exciting weaponry to someone like me?<eos> As long as it doesn't show up in L.A.
If you don't care for her...<eos> She isn't...<eos> She's been moved.<eos> Moved?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Someplace safe, okay?<eos> She's taken care of, so just quit...<eos> - Connor, what does Jasmine eat?<eos> - What?<eos> The creature in the sewer, it called her the Devourer.
Used a fake charm.<eos> Fooled her and took everything we had on whoever the Beast was working for. That son of a bitch.<eos> Nearly killed Wesley outside the hotel, but Gunn and Faith chased him off.<eos> Yay for our side.<eos> Lilah's book, that stuff from Lorne's head, why does he want all that?<eos> I don't know. But whatever Angelus is up to, I'm thinking it can't be good.<eos> Just lucky no one got hurt this time.<eos> So the sanctuary spell held up?<eos> No demon violence in the hotel?<eos> Yeah, it worked.
Oh.<eos> Yeah, that's what it felt like.<eos> I am so, so beyond sorry.<eos> Oh, go on.<eos> It's the first good nap I've had since the Apocalypse started.<eos> - So, what did I miss?<eos> - Angelus and his usual freak show.<eos> Everybody still has their necks attached.<eos> The sanctuary spell did its thing?<eos> - Yeah, it's working.
Always was a bit of a drama queen.<eos> [ Sighs ] Too late.<eos> So you, what, heard a scream?<eos> [ Spike ] He smelled the blood.<eos> Nothing grabs a vamp's attention like the ruby red.<eos> Notice no matter how uptown we go... we always wind up at some stanky hole in the middle of the night?<eos> [ Wesley ] Angel.<eos> His heart's missing.<eos> Looks like it was cut out with some sort of crude knife.<eos> Based on these blood spatters... I'd say it was still beating when it was removed.
At a weekend stage fighting workshop with Carl Weathers.<eos> But he used to believe in things.<eos> We both used to. Sorry, Lindsay.<eos> I didn't realize you were up there.<eos> Oh, I'm up here, Mike, and I'm not coming down!<eos> I'm gonna save this tree, no matter what it takes.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you when you realize what that bucket's for.<eos> I can see why your mom likes it.<eos> It is a really nice tree... We've gotta get it torn down.
Will fifty dollars work? They can get themselves a nice tent for fifty...<eos> No, no.<eos> The Lord has spoken to me.<eos> He was quite clear.<eos> I want Chin's.<eos> The Lord has spoken to you?<eos> That's correct.<eos> Maybe he should have told you that property's not for sale.<eos> Are you mocking me, Mr. Templeton?<eos> I'm just sayin' it's not for sale.
Deal with what, though?<eos> It's not Shakespeare.<eos> I'm not writing Schindler's List.<eos> Why do I care? I'm no Spielberg.<eos> The guy won't even meet with me.<eos> -Why would he?<eos> -Stop it.<eos> She's dying.<eos> Jo, she's gonna die, and all I think about is some fricking ending to some stupid TV show.<eos> I keep thinking there's gonna be time for the rest of it, but it runs out.
A minus?<eos> This means....<eos> Factoring in all your papers from this semester and last brings your grade to a C plus for the year.<eos> Just slightly above average.<eos> You got a problem with that?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You know, the sad thing is is that I almost gave you an A.<eos> And I went back and forth about it, and then.... Ultimately, I found your essay on Catch-22 a little bleak.<eos> You found it bleak?
Some men might take advantage of that.<eos> One man.<eos> She's looking for someone to come and explain things to him?<eos> Thas essentially it, yes.<eos> A whole houseful of companions.<eos> How are they fixed for payment?<eos> They're not companions.<eos> They're whores.<eos> Thought you didn't care for that word.<eos> It applies.
-Okay.<eos> -I mean you wouldn't want any part of me to get any bigger, would you?<eos> Don't answer that.<eos> Just when you thought that dude couldn't get any weirder.<eos> Why do you think he was so worried about me getting bigger?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, what brought that on?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You know what, we're trying to get pregnant so he's probably starting to freak out that my body's gonna change.<eos> -You think that's what it is?
The whale was just toying with us.<eos> She was swatting us with her tail and hosing us down with her blowhole because that is the whale's M.O. - humiliate and rip apart every other fish in the sea until there's nothing left but a bloody pile of chum.<eos> Boy, you really hate whales, don't you?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Out of the blue, bam!<eos> It was right there.<eos> Well, things always happen when you least expect it.<eos> - I have to tell you, this tree is perfect.<eos> - All girls think their tree is perfect.<eos> It fits my back completely, and there's plenty of grass, and it's in a great area - just far enough away from anything major so there's not a lot of noise but still not in Siberia.

- My study tree, this is my study tree.<eos> What the hell's a study tree?<eos> - Okay.<eos> See, I have roommates...<eos> - So do I.<eos> Yes, but I have Paris and I have Tanna and I have Janet, and Janet squeaks...<eos> Look, I'm busy, okay?<eos> Yes, I see you're very busy with your "Trucker's Monthly" there, but I finally found a great place to study, and you're sitting on it.<eos> There's a million trees on campus.<eos> But this one fits my back perfectly so I don't get tired, and the light is right, and it's just far enough away from anything busy so that the noise level is perfect, and it's quiet but not Unabomber, and... and anyhow, I was just hoping that maybe
Why would she fire you?<eos> - Because I was the caterer.<eos> Get out of town!<eos> Yes, I have a partner in a small catering company.<eos> - You cook?<eos> - I plan.<eos> I had no idea how much chaos my little weekend was causing.<eos> No, you didn't, because you didn't think.<eos> You never thought.<eos> Back in summer camp, you never thought. "Hey, if I stand up in this canoe, maybe it'll tip over." That was the extent of your thought process.
You know what, you want me to quit? Fine, I'll quit.<eos> I never wanted this stupid job in the first place.<eos> Who forced you to take it then?<eos> You did, because you didn't think you'd get elected unless I ran with you. - That's not true!<eos> - It's completely true!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> - No, you shut up!<eos> Enough!<eos> This behavior will stop this instant.<eos> It is disgraceful, especially from the political leaders of this campus.
All right.<eos> And tell her I'll call her later, and give her this.<eos> That's very nice.<eos> Now how about my finder's fee?<eos> You're very amusing.<eos> Thank you for a lovely evening, and I'll see the two of you on Friday.<eos> Good night.<eos> Sleep tight.<eos> Excuse me, hi.<eos> I am not seeing my coat here, and it was very cute and it was on sale, and I will fling myself off a building if I lose it.
And so are my stepmom's painkillers.<eos> - Should we split up?<eos> - No, let's stick together.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd it go with the suits?<eos> You know, okay.<eos> I can't believe summer's over.<eos> I know.<eos> Feels like it goes faster and faster every year.
- We're going to be asked about that?<eos> Because it's the round we call General Ignorance.<eos> What, or which is the largest living thing on earth?<eos> - (donkey) - It is the blue whale.<eos> - (alarm bells) - Oh, dear, oh, dear, oh, dear.<eos> I'm so sorry, Alan, minus ten points.<eos> It's not the blue whale, have another go.<eos> Largest living thing on earth.<eos> - It's a tree, it'll be a tree, like a redwood.<eos> - (Stephen) No, it isn't, no.
- Oh, Alan, Alan, Alan.<eos> (Alan) The six wives of Henry VIII.<eos> Just because other people have made the mistake, it's no excuse for you to make it too.<eos> He had six wives!<eos> He had major, major commitment problems, didn't he?<eos> I imagine every time he said, "Oh, it's not you, it's me."<eos> Then I suppose they had a trial separation - a brief trial and a very major separation.<eos> Yes, of head from shoulders, exactly right.<eos> It must have been difficult for the new woman in his life each time, cos she'd say, "Oh, I don't know.<eos> Everywhere I look, I just see her face" cos it's on a pole.

Can I say something interesting about Henry VIII?<eos> When he died and his body was moved from Greenwich up to wherever it went, Selfridges or somewhere...
- (Stephen and Jackie) I don't know.<eos> (applause) How do monkeys make toast?<eos> They put it under a griller.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Another African anthropology question now.<eos> How did the Hehe tribe of Tanzania get their name?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - They sent off a little coupon in the paper.<eos> I think you've pronounced that wrong.<eos> I think it's the "Heyhey".
- The. - No.<eos> There's only one real meaning of "the".<eos> It won't take that long to define.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to humiliate you, but, I mean, it's obviously a word that has to have lots of different meanings that take up quite a lot of explanation, and "the" really...<eos> You know, it's not also a name for a type of watering can or a nose flute.<eos> It can't be a verb.<eos> This word can be a verb, it can be a noun, it can be an adjective.<eos> - (Alan) Bee.<eos> - Not bee. As in double e?<eos> Again, there are not many meanings, but it's a three-letter word.
Who knew he could be so...<eos> Passionate?<eos> Only an initial?<eos> Could you?<eos> I couldn't stop thinking about you all day.<eos> I've never felt this way about anyone.<eos> All I know is I want to be with you.<eos> Clark?<eos> Lana, I don't think that love letter is from her husband.<eos> I think it's from the drifter.
General?<eos> Gentlemen, please be seated.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Welcome to the Pentagon.<eos> Please forgive any security measures you had to undergo to get here.<eos> In America we try never to underestimate the competence or curiosity of our media.<eos> We asked you here to inform you of a secret operation that the US Air Force is operating out of Cheyenne Mountain in Colorado.<eos> It's called the Stargate programme.<eos> Gentlemen, the Stargate.<eos> The device itself was discovered in Egypt in 1928, where it lay buried for several thousand years.
And it nearly resulted in disaster.<eos> It was only because of the efforts of SG-1, who violated your order to shut down the gate, that we managed to survive.<eos> Oh, and they've done a great job since, under your tenure, haven't they, General?<eos> You managed to defeat the Goa'uld known as Apophis, only to see him replaced by another more dangerous one.<eos> Isn't that a fair assessment?<eos> You are the one they call Thor.<eos> I am Anubis.<eos> As I have told your lieutenant, I will reveal nothing to you.<eos> This device will be implanted into your brain.<eos> It will form a link between your mind and the ship's computer.
Frankenstein's monster.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Remnantsofaunique energy signature within its cells.<eos> It's similar to the residual effects left by the use of a sarcophagus.<eos> Could it give life to something that was never alive?<eos> No, a sarcophagus is designed to boost health or heal someone terminally injured.<eos> - They cannot animate non-living cells.<eos> - Then what could have?<eos> Thousands of years ago a Goa'uld found a device originally created by the Ancients.<eos> He determined its primary purpose was to heal, but it was so powerful, its effects on human hosts proved devastating.
Then do so.<eos> Take me to the nearest Stargate.<eos> Commander, you said you gave Anubis your entire stockpile of Naquadria.<eos> That's correct.<eos> So if he got what he wanted, why is he still here?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> His men have rounded up archaeologists from the Academy of Sciences.<eos> - He may be looking for the Stargate.<eos> - How secure is this place?<eos> It's top secret.
- Not if I cut him out.<eos> - You would not.<eos> Oh, yes, I would.<eos> - Pharrin, you will listen to me.<eos> - Don't listen.<eos> Just do what you came here to do.<eos> Forgive us, Sovereign.<eos> It is the only way to protect our people.<eos> I will not surrender this body, not at any cost.<eos> It is mine.
- You would not.<eos> Oh, yes, I would.<eos> - Pharrin, you will listen to me.<eos> - Don't listen.<eos> Just do what you came here to do.<eos> Forgive us, Sovereign.<eos> It is the only way to protect our people.<eos> I will not surrender this body, not at any cost.<eos> It is mine.<eos> It was never ours.
I mean, heck, it'd be a real shame if you chickened out.<eos> Then you'd be a couple of love chickens.<eos> No. No, we wanna get married.<eos> Right, Donna?<eos> Of course.<eos> I do.<eos> Well, then it's settled.<eos> We're having a wedding.<eos> Oh, Donna, you can wear my wedding dress.<eos> It's off-white, so nobody will whisper.
Berardi blunted his protest by making it a laundry list.<eos> The bombings, the assassination.<eos> I thought he would go for our neckties.<eos> -How are the Syrians?<eos> -Better.<eos> Probably afraid they're next.<eos> Anyone else making noise?<eos> Mostly shows of support, regards to the first family from the Saudis in Cairo.<eos> Your address to the U.N...<eos> -...it went a long way.
- Sir, can you hear my voice?<eos> Squeeze my hand.<eos> Let's get him into the ambulance.<eos> You need to clear the way for us, guys.<eos> - And you followed the can?<eos> - Right to the warehouse.<eos> - Surveillance set up?<eos> - Kima is on it tonight.<eos> This case needs to be worked, Lieutenant.<eos> I know it began for you as a bullshit detail... but this Sobotka's into some shit that needs to be worked by good police.
- I'm just asking.<eos> - Payment on delivery.<eos> Don't worry about it, chief.<eos> I would never even dream of cheating a smart businessman like yourself.<eos> It ain't enough that I gotta be the one thinking this whole shit through.<eos> That I gotta be the one looking out for this shit and that shit.<eos> Checking up on this, making sure this shit is done.<eos> No, that's not enough.<eos> That's why they be paying them fucking CEOs so much damn money.<eos> Because when the shit fall bad, it all fall bad on them.
I mean, what the fuck, man?<eos> I'm not out there asking about no random-ass, who-give-a-damn nigger.<eos> No, sir.<eos> I'm making inquiries in your behalf... in regards to that fucking unforgiving, motherfucking Omar, man.<eos> Why?<eos> He play you hard?<eos> I go at him respectable... he put that goddamn shotgun in my face, man.<eos> I'm looking at two tubes of the harbor tunnel... staring right at me, each one about yea-big.<eos> I damn near pissed in my pants... and he stood smiling like this shit is funny.<eos> It ain't funny.
Isn't this your brother's room?<eos> Not anymore. We can now move freely between all three sleeping areas.<eos> Paul? We need to talk.<eos> Yes, we certainly do! You and I need to...<eos> I want you to come and have lunch with Gwendolen and me.<eos> Can you be at Le Lumiere at 1:00?<eos> Yes, she's... She's put a proposition to me.<eos> A proposition?<eos> What kind of proposition?<eos> Does it involve a hotel?
do you have any other questionnaires I can fill out?<eos> Because we were asking people to think about things that they had never thought about before and they liked thinking about them.<eos> Like what they felt inside, what motivated them, what was their life about, what was important to them. It was sort of like, wow.<eos> The answers were then analyzed by computer.<eos> It revealed there were underlying patterns in the way people felt about themselves which fitted Maslow's categories.<eos> And at the top of the hierarchy were a large and growing group which cut across all social classes.<eos> The SRI called them the inner directives.<eos> These were people who felt they were not defined by their place in society but by the choices they made themselves.<eos> But what SRI discovered was that these people could be defined by the different patterns of behavior through which they chose to express themselves.<eos> Self expression was not infinite, it fell into identifiable types.
Ketchup, please.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right... what's the trick? Trick?<eos> Where is the food?<eos> Can't all be in your stomach.<eos> Actually, I don't know.<eos> The fact is, I always loved eating. More than anything.<eos> Go into a restaurant, want to order everything on the menu.<eos> But, I was always frustrated, by the small capacity of my stomach.<eos> Well, 17 years ago, I made a wish... And amazingly enough it came true.
- I can't touch you.<eos> - Don't touch anything.<eos> - You can't be in here.<eos> - Just answer his questions.<eos> - Tell me how...<eos> - They're sleeping.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Tell me how all this works.<eos> The photon milk acts as both a nutrient supply and conductor.<eos> It enhances the images they receive.
Not even the old man who just wants to hang on to what he created.<eos> Don't trust anyone.<eos> Just find the Minority Report.<eos> You said the Minority Report is destroyed.<eos> The record is destroyed.<eos> The original report still exists.<eos> I designed it so the report is stored in a safe place, but not declared.<eos> What safe place is that?<eos> The safest place there is.<eos> Where is it?
JONAH: Somebody got a 20 on this Pam? STU:<eos> Don't blame her.<eos> I never told her if I was married, and if I did she would've told me to go home.<eos> Kelly, looking at you now, I'm ashamed of myself.<eos> I mean, I work so hard on this image, on Stu Shepard, the asshole who refers to himself in third person, that I only proved I should be alone.<eos> I've been dressing up as something I'm not for so long I'm so afraid you won't like what's underneath.<eos> But here I am.<eos> I'm just flesh and blood and weakness.<eos> I love you so fucking much.<eos> I take off this ring because it only reminds me of how I've failed you.
It's something I demand from those who serve me.<eos> -Do I serve you?<eos> -Yes.<eos> And, I think, faithfully.<eos> Commander Suran, on the other hand, gives me pause.<eos> Here's another word, Praetor.<eos> Trust.<eos> Do you trust me?<eos> How far does that trust extend?<eos> How deep does it go?
We have to find it and take it.<eos> -Are you gonna help me?<eos> -Yes.<eos> Then I have to teach you something.<eos> -You know what the clutch is?<eos> -Sure I know what the clutch is.<eos> -What is the clutch?<eos> -The clutch, it....<eos> It clutches.<eos> Right, it clutches.
-The clutch, it....<eos> It clutches.<eos> Right, it clutches.<eos> Which of those pedals is the clutch?<eos> That's the gas.<eos> Gas.<eos> I'll show you.<eos> There.<eos> Right there, see?<eos> There's the clutch, and it does the clutching.
It won't be Chicago's.<eos> They took it all out two days ago.<eos> -Who authorized it?<eos> -The accountant.<eos> What's his name?<eos> This is Mr. Rance in the bridal suite.<eos> Before you proffer your congratulations, there's no Mrs. Rance with me and I'm all the better for it.<eos> Listen carefully because I am in no mood.<eos> I'm going to say this only once.<eos> I would like a boiled egg, and I want it runny.
A beautiful adventure, don't you think?<eos> No, I don't think so!<eos> I want my share of the gold!<eos> All you have to do is dive into Three Borders Lake!<eos> Stop this childishness! I don't find you funny.<eos> I don't see why the Baron let us go free.<eos> The shaman told him to.<eos> He also told me to watch out for a broken Black Dragon!<eos> Since the train stopped, his men have been dying of cold and hunger. And Koltchak's gold belongs to you, General.<eos> - It's in Three Borders Lake.
Someplace better.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I'll do it again too.<eos> It's all I want now.<eos> Well, unfortunately, your heart disagrees.<eos> It's waged quite a battle tonight.<eos> No one knows my heart.<eos> Maybe that's why it's still beating- to give somebody a chance to.<eos> Let me tell you about that better place you think you're going to.<eos> You better be damn sure it's there.

- I hate that Tejano shit.<eos> - What the shit?<eos> - Don't move, or I'll shoot you.<eos> - You're dead, Homes!<eos> - Sit on down.<eos> I said sit down.<eos> - Where's that stuff?<eos> - What stuff?<eos> The stuff we let you borrow last night.<eos> Where is it?
I thought it'd be nice to get dressed for work, and I'm not sure why.<eos> - May I please show you something?<eos> - Sure.<eos> What's this?<eos> I believe this is a small piano.<eos> It's not a piano.<eos> I got a piano at home.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> It was dropped in the street.<eos> Why is it here?
I don't think so. I think he's gonna choke.<eos> You want to shoot it all, let's shoot it all.<eos> -How much you got in your pocket?<eos> -I got a couple of thousand.<eos> You? $500.<eos> -What about your ring?<eos> -What? -How much for your ring?<eos> -You want my ring?<eos> You said it: "Shoot it all."<eos> -What's it worth to you?
I can't go through with it, Clarissa.<eos> Oh...<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Why? Because I wanted to be a writer, that's all.<eos> So?<eos> I wanted to write about it all.<eos> Everything that happens in a moment.<eos> The way the flowers looked when you carried them in your arms.<eos> This towel, how it... smells, how it feels.
If you say to me, When were you happiest? Mom...<eos> Tell me the moment you were happiest.<eos> I know, I know, it was years ago.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All you're saying is... you were once young.<eos> I remember one morning... getting up at dawn, there was such a sense of possibility.<eos> You know? That feeling?<eos> Hmm?<eos> And I remember thinking to myself,<eos> So, this is the beginning of happiness. This is where it starts.
I'll take them all.<eos> My God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> It's all right. It's all over.<eos> All over.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God! A hit?<eos> That's what that was, right?<eos> A hit?<eos> - Yes, ma'am, it was.
A very good age to be married at.<eos> I've always been of opinion... that a man who desires to get married... should know either everything or nothing.<eos> Which do you know?<eos> I know nothing, Lady Bracknell.<eos> I'm pleased to hear it.<eos> I do not approve of anything that tampers... with natural ignorance.<eos> Ignorance is like a delicate, exotic fruit. Touch it, and the bloom is gone.<eos> The whole theory of modern education... is radically unsound.<eos> Fortunately, in England, at any rate... education produces no effect whatsoever.<eos> If it did, it would prove a serious danger... to the upper classes and probably lead... to acts of violence in Grosvenor Square.
I suggest you return to your duties and drop this matter.<eos> The less said about it the better.<eos> I'd still like to talk to Mrs. Watts.<eos> - And what crime has she committed?<eos> - No crime, I just want to see her.<eos> Well, I'm sure we all want to see lots of people but fortunately in our country and in yours they are not compelled to see us.<eos> Good day, Inspector.<eos> Sir!<eos> Do you know the penalty for having an illegal hand gun?<eos> - I told you, it's not my gun.
But killing people who don't want you is evil.<eos> We pray for your redemption.<eos> Fuck my redemption.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> I regret nothing. Attention.<eos> Visiting hours are over.<eos> Visitors, return to the holding area.<eos> It's good that you're trying to identify evil, Astrid.<eos> But evil is tricky.<eos> Just when you think you know what it is, it changes its form.
Don't you remember me?<eos> I'm Mrs. Paley.<eos> The Colonel was our only link to this place.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> I designed the door panels in here. The touch sensors.<eos> What?<eos> I was freelancing for a subcontractor, I...<eos> You didn't think this was worth mentioning before?<eos> I signed a confidentiality...<eos> Given our current situation, I'd say it's null and void.
I gave them a real hypercube.<eos> How do we get out?<eos> Kate, this isn't a game.<eos> There's no happy ending.<eos> This place is out of control.<eos> It's not stable.<eos> Does this number mean nothing?<eos> 6-0-6-5-9.<eos> It's got to mean something.<eos> It's everywhere.
But you were almost killed in my own stable.<eos> Just imagine!<eos> You came back to me on your own.<eos> We better take her back to the sheriff.<eos> She's not going anywhere.<eos> There, let me look at you!<eos> Lovely girl.<eos> Lovely.<eos> It'll be hard to keep this dress clean.<eos> - it's not for outside.
She told me.<eos> Katie told you she was going to die?<eos> She said she didn't have enough time.<eos> Good night, Rachel.<eos> Oh, shit! Aidan!<eos> God damn it!<eos> Honey, have you seen my black dress? Aidan?<eos> Have you seen my black...<eos> Dress?<eos> It's a little wrinkled.
- Salute him!<eos> - Volodya, sit down.<eos> Sit down!<eos> - Relax!<eos> What's all this noise?<eos> Could you keep it quiet?<eos> Come in, don't be angry.<eos> We've got cough medicine. You can have some.<eos> - I don't have a cough.<eos> - It's good for everything.
Give it.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Calm down.<eos> I'll make you a deal, okay?<eos> Just let me make another 500 bucks tonight, okay?<eos> And then I'll give you your body back 'cause it's so important to you.
Should leave you in suspense?<eos> Should shut my feelings?<eos> It's late, is not it?<eos> And did the last race, the last day of college.<eos> And the last... The most wanted... was to go to Alaska with Ivo.<eos> But I could not disappoint him.<eos> 4000 km ² ice on three sides... and water in the room.<eos> The only entrance and exit Juneau is by air or sea.<eos> This road begins at one side and ends at another.<eos> It has more output, is the end of the world!
No, I had something on my mind.<eos> I really wanted to see you.<eos> Really?<eos> Of course.<eos> Tired?<eos> Who are you living with?<eos> Living alone?<eos> No, with my cousin, her husband and their daughter.<eos> The farm's my cousin's.<eos> So, it isn't yours?
No, I can't play.<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Is that your girlfriend?<eos> I don't have one yet.<eos> Then why do you carry that photo?<eos> She's a real beauty.<eos> Would you like to have it?<eos> What for?<eos> It was given to me.<eos> It's not mine.
Camera Ai Pi 270 and is now in the development stage.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> It will release no earlier than 3 years.<eos> This is a digital camera with built-in memory.<eos> And what does it mean?<eos> What is this guy a time traveler.<eos> A general guide is not yet written.<eos> And what are you gonna do?<eos> I want to see again the letter.<eos> It is our only clue.
But there is one serious problem.<eos> When you send something in the past for example one hour, the land at this time continues to spin.<eos> What happens then?<eos> Subject to land somewhere in the cosmos.<eos> Now you see the first attempt to send an object in the past only a couple of seconds.<eos> The motion of the earth in this period of time can be calculated.<eos> Note the location of the car on the right.<eos> Exactly 4 seconds before the start of movement of the apple appears here.<eos> It has been moved in time.<eos> So, it appears to start moving.

Please.<eos> Please help me.<eos> You can't enter there.<eos> It's beautiful, beautiful!<eos> A really wonderful movie.<eos> I think we should all thank the archbishop.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> What is going on?<eos> I have a letter here regarding my sister, Margaret Maguire.<eos> It's from Joseph Donnelly.
And you achieved nothing.<eos> We made sure people knew about it.<eos> They've all forgotten now.<eos> And we were united, I haven't forgotten that.<eos> Then it got all fucked up.<eos> It's easy for you to talk, you didn't have a family.<eos> What about the men who were 50?<eos> Who would hire us?<eos> All right.<eos> You signed the agreement, I understand, but you knew it was shit.
I'll go there. It's the same thing.<eos> If the Koreans build ships cheaper, then it's...<eos> I don't want to hear anymore about the fucking Koreans.<eos> This shipyard was competitive.<eos> We worked fast, damn it.<eos> We even offered to do free overtime with lower pay.<eos> The thing is, the shipyard is where it is.<eos> The site's worth a fortune.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's next to the sea.
We studied together.<eos> She quit when we married.<eos> I told you a million times!<eos> Come here.<eos> Stand here.<eos> Hold this hand firm, move this one when you hit.<eos> Watch your feet.<eos> Wide apart, this way.<eos> Look that way.<eos> Make sure the wood holds steady, about a meter away so that it doesn't splinter away.
- I am not.<eos> - You are.<eos> - Am not.<eos> How do I look?<eos> You got a mirror?<eos> Got a mirror... Have you got a mirror?<eos> - What?<eos> - Just what I thought.<eos> You have a plain, uninteresting face.<eos> Although it's a little pale, but that's normal for a blond with blue eyes.
A picture of a spirit running toward me over the field.<eos> She held out a red flower which became a flame in my young heart.<eos> That is why I came to call her the Fire Spirit.<eos> But the Fire Spirit watched me with uneasy eyes, predicting my deep wound.<eos> Mother!<eos> Mother!<eos> Mother!<eos> I'm sorry you have to see me this way.<eos> I will just rot away, but you...<eos> I saw her face for the first time. Never imagined it would be so horrible.
Strange.<eos> No one can get to sleep tonight.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> Yuwen, you shouldn't drink so much.<eos> It's bad for you.<eos> Stay a while.<eos> Since Zhichen's been here... it's been so lively.<eos> I've been in such a good mood.<eos> You're wearing your wedding dress.<eos> I almost forgot what it looked like.
I can't prove that he did it, but I know it was him.<eos> - Which one were you?<eos> - What? Which horseman?<eos> The fourth one, I guess.<eos> "And his name was Death and hell followed with him."<eos> "People sleep peacefully in their beds at night only because men stand ready to do violence on their behalf."<eos> - You write that?<eos> - No. Something by George Orwell.<eos> He abhorred violence too.<eos> But I guess he understood when it became necessity.
Don t you know?<eos> You who means...<eos> I m gonna kick your ass.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Hey, Moimoi.<eos> What's this lake called?<eos> Michelangelo.<eos> What s it called?<eos> Prometheus.<eos> It's very deep and connected to the ocean 250 km away.
I've been down this road A Kick ln the Head<eos> Walking the line That's painted by pride<eos> -Obviously, we're mortified.<eos> -Just tell me, is it true?<eos> -Is she my genetic daughter?<eos> -Apparently, she is.<eos> -We're mortified.<eos> -How can this happen?<eos> There is an explanation.<eos> I'm not sure it would appease you.
I think you broke a couple of ribs.<eos> CONNOR: I've never been broken.<eos> Not even in Quor-toth.<eos> I didn't think I could be.<eos> You're hurt because of me.<eos> Because I thought maybe I still had some grand higher purpose.<eos> That me being here could actually make a difference.<eos> Now I know better.<eos> All you know is that that thing can hurt you.<eos> And if it tries again I will find a way to kill it.
The Senih'D manifests physically for one purpose.<eos> - Seen it.<eos> - To feed. Upon rising, it'll search for a victim.<eos> We've got to keep it from finding one.<eos> Angel will take the sewer.<eos> The rest will go to Sorenson Park.<eos> We'll enter the underground, double back.<eos> - By the time we meet up--<eos> - I know this creature.<eos> It's like the Bleaucha, nested in the Scum Pits of Ur.
- Why are you not toast?<eos> - I'm not even warmed up.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> I can fix that.<eos> Warm enough?<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - You felt that?<eos> - My heart.<eos> - It was beating.<eos> It doesn't, does it?
I've been doing this a long damn time.<eos> I've had to be better, smarter, quicker than every man at Wolfram Hart.<eos> So it's a feminist thing.<eos> It's on her.<eos> It's a survival thing.<eos> I made a lot of devil's bargains, and I stuck to them.<eos> As a result, I live somewhat dangerously and quite comfortably.<eos> My mother, who doesn't recognize me, has the best room at the clinic.<eos> I put on my game face and do what I have to.<eos> You wear a game face long enough, it stops being removable.
Well, it's really more lap-work, because guess what just fell into it.<eos> - What?<eos> - A memory spell provided by one of my clients, guaranteed to bring our Cordy back to the way she was.<eos> - Guaranteed?<eos> - No pain, no side effects.<eos> I'm telling you, swingers, there's no way this can fail.<eos> So I'm an idiot.<eos> What are you, perfect?<eos> Well, I had every reason to believe this spell would work.<eos> And it did, after a fashion.
I have a question.<eos> Yeah, I got a couple of questions myself.<eos> Okay, first of all, you didn't... you didn't tell her, right? Wanda?<eos> - I told you I didn't tell her.<eos> - I know, I know.<eos> The David promise.<eos> I didn't tell her.<eos> Yeah, a "David promise" is worthless.<eos> - It's really no good?<eos> - It doesn't mean anything.
But I am what I am - a bike messenger.<eos> - It's not true, Sketchy.<eos> - Well, it feels true.<eos> All right, thanks, you guys.<eos> I'll go home now and puke.<eos> Tell me again how that had to be done.<eos> Had to be done.<eos> Calvin Theodore, you're coming with us.<eos> - I've got a permit for the gun.<eos> It's in my car.
He wants this thing to end badly.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> - Max, you're not goin' out there.<eos> - I have to.<eos> - OK, take a breath.<eos> - Max, listen to me.<eos> After you left, I translated the new runes on your skin.<eos> - Is that the message from Father?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I think it's complete.
-Yes. lt's the little brush you're using to clean the toilet.<eos> Okay. All right, I deserved that.<eos> That's fine.<eos> That favour I was asking for, it's not a favour so much.<eos> It's really-- lt's like a proposition, which, I think you'll agree with me...<eos> -...is a far more enticing word.<eos> -Spare me the sales pitch and get on with it.<eos> I have band practice in an hour.<eos> Well, to outfit yourself for said proposition which you'll hear the dazzling details of, you'll need a new dress and I am willing to take you to a house of high fashion and buy you said new dress, which will become your favourite dress.<eos> It will become your head-turning dress, and it will only be complete when it is filled out, by you, tomorrow night at my office party.
I really like you.<eos> Good, because I like you too.<eos> A lot of people walk in and out of my life, Dawson and you might not believe me because I'm an actor and I lie for a living but you're one of the only people I ever really wanted to stick around.<eos> I don't know what to believe.<eos> But I love my life. I wake up most mornings pinching myself that I get to take even a small part in all of this but I can't help but feel like it's all an illusion.<eos> It's like it's all just one moment away from disappearing forever.<eos> That's because it is.<eos> For all I know, this could be my last job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So I'm going to enjoy the experience while it lasts hug everybody now, because they might not be here tomorrow and take the experience with me.
-No. I seem to have fallen victim to the Capeside disease.<eos> And what is that exactly?<eos> Feeling trapped feeling sorry for yourself a sort of general inability to see the future.<eos> You mean being a teenager?<eos> You know what, Pace?<eos> And don't take this the wrong way. But despite your penchant for sugarcoated cereals and Saturday morning cartoons, you may be the most adult person I know.<eos> -You never look back, do you?<eos> -Why would you look back?<eos> The future's out there.<eos> And whatever it is, it's gonna be great.
I'm on thin ice with this thing.<eos> If I want to do this, I should be present for it.<eos> -Buy your ticket. I have another idea. -Okay.<eos> Good luck.<eos> -See you later.<eos> -Bye.<eos> I don't wanna fly first class.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's a hot towel.<eos> I hate the hot towel. it's hot.
Bye-bye.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> It's not a religion.<eos> It's a peer counselling program.<eos> You're saying I need counselling?<eos> No. I'm saying I think you could give counselling.<eos> Oh, you mean help people?<eos> All I'm asking is that you come to an information session tonight.<eos> It starts at 7.
I do.<eos> When I took you and your sister in, the deal was you keep her in check.<eos> You can't hold up your end, we're gonna have to revisit the deal.<eos> She's getting worse. Isn't she?<eos> Yes.<eos> Just look at the bright side.<eos> Maybe you'll meet a young, handsome doctor.<eos> He'll ask you out, and-<eos> What's the Companion policy on dating?<eos> It's complicated.
- You get us a deal?<eos> - I got a deal. Now get off my ship.<eos> So, very much for a lovely night then.<eos> - Ow!<eos> - Are you badly hurt?<eos> [ Groans ] We was just about to spring into action, Captain.<eos> Complicated escape and rescue op.<eos> I was gonna watch. It was very exciting.<eos> Thank you for the wine.<eos> It's... very fresh.

Suit yourself.<eos> I'm off to do a load of your pinks.<eos> - I don't have any pinks.<eos> - You will.<eos> [PEOPLE CHATTERING] ROZ: Are you okay?<eos> FRASIER: I'm fine.<eos> You seem like you've been in a lousy mood lately.<eos> It's just that they put soymilk in my latte.<eos> I don't like soymilk.<eos> If it doesn't come from a teat or an udder, it isn't milk.
- No, no, no, here.<eos> Here's the ring.<eos> - All right.<eos> - I'll just stay here for a moment.<eos> Ah. Does it fit?<eos> - Look, here, let me help.<eos> - No, I got it.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Oh, Niles.<eos> Frasier, it's perfect.
Come on.<eos> We're not peeking?<eos> Well, I'm peeking.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hello, sir.<eos> You know Monica.<eos> - Hey, uh, is it okay to come in?<eos> Of course.<eos> Oh, Joey, this ring, I...<eos> It's beautiful.
-You snooze, you lose.<eos> -He's not snoozing.<eos> He's teaching.<eos> Well, then somebody's snoozing.<eos> And, Joey, not that this should affect you at all, but if you pick me.. I was planning on wearing a sequin dress cut down to here.<eos> -I haven't seen this dress.<eos> -Star in a movie.<eos> Pick whoever you want.<eos> Listen to your heart.<eos> What does it tell you?
You were so inept, so inexperienced, that you didn't even achieve a climax.<eos> Not even when you were by yourself, reliving the moment.<eos> One thing was young, ripe, begging for it.<eos> But I took my time with it.<eos> It had the most beautiful brown eyes, almost sleepy.<eos> Till I went to work. Then they went big and round.<eos> First it pleaded, then it bargained.<eos> This interview's over.<eos> The thing screamed in pain, yelled in fear.<eos> It was alive through every moment of it, even when I gutted it and the blood sprayed over me like a warm shower.
We're not tight anymore.<eos> And it's one thing to hate cats, but Harry went super freak.<eos> FIN: Anything involving a hunting knife?<eos> Where does he keep it?<eos> How should I know? See.<eos> You're burning out too many brain cells.<eos> Affects your memory. Maybe we should give his principal and parents the 411 on his little huffing habit.<eos> AII right.<eos> He's got this place in Central Park.<eos> It's private, so he can be alone with his collection.
DID SHE BECOME A NURSE LIKE SHE ALWAYS WANTED?<eos> I NEVER KNEW THAT.<eos> JUST A WAITRESS.<eos> JESUS, I CAN STILL HEAR THAT LAUGH OF HERS.<eos> SHE'D BRING DOWN A HOUSE. [ Chuckling ]<eos> I WISH SHE'D BEEN OUT FRONT LAST NIGHT.<eos> OH, AND THAT COMPLEXION.<eos> I TELL YOU, KID. YOUR MOM WAS A REAL LOOKER.<eos> HMM... STILL IS. JUST, NOW, THERE'S MORE TO LOOK AT.<eos> THIS BENEFIT OF YOURS, UM, WHEN IS IT?
- I'm telling you now.<eos> What do you expect me to do with this information?<eos> Christ, Nate! This whole wedding thing scares the shit out of me... but I've been trying to make myself believe that we could actually...<eos> Almost done.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> How bad is it?<eos> - Your brother showed her the body?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It was in pretty bad shape, huh?
Of course I want to be with you.<eos> I Iove you.<eos> Then why do you treat me like shit all the time?<eos> Because I had a really fucked-up life... and I use sarcasm to hide how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jesus, you know that.<eos> Happy anniversary.<eos> I know I already got you another ring, but....<eos> I can't believe you....<eos> It was my grandmother's.
I Iove you.<eos> Then why do you treat me like shit all the time?<eos> Because I had a really fucked-up life... and I use sarcasm to hide how ridiculously vulnerable I really am.<eos> Come on.<eos> Jesus, you know that.<eos> Happy anniversary.<eos> I know I already got you another ring, but....<eos> I can't believe you....<eos> It was my grandmother's.<eos> It didn't cost me anything.
I have no idea.<eos> Can you imagine waking up one morning and having powers?<eos> It's scary.<eos> I guess. I mean, look at Eric, it hasn't helped him.<eos> That's true.<eos> But I've still always wished I could fly.<eos> Yeah, that'd be something, Lana.<eos> What is it?<eos> It's your necklace.<eos> I never realized how beautiful it was until now.
I was just locking up.<eos> I brought your necklace back.<eos> This is beautiful.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> A friend.<eos> It's made of lead armor.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> I figure, that way it can protect your memories.<eos> Is this your way of telling me I shouldn't wear my necklace?<eos> I don't want it to hold you back.
Get away from her.<eos> Clark, don't touch him!<eos> Clark, are you okay?<eos> Son, your mom is... She's resting.<eos> She's pretty shaken up but I think she's gonna be fine.<eos> Police are looking everywhere for Tyler.<eos> - I don't think they're gonna stop him.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because I saw his heart.<eos> It wasn't beating.
I'll be there in a sec.<eos> - She likes you.<eos> - Yeah, we're friends.<eos> She wants to be more than just friends.<eos> - She wants you to ask her to the prom.<eos> - Chloe?<eos> - Yeah, right.<eos> - No, really.<eos> She already picked out a dress.<eos> It's pink.
If you were a CIA operative.<eos> Who do you think it is?<eos> I don't know...<eos> Mom, aunt?<eos> And the mystery deepens.<eos> I still can't figure out how he knew that Kaspar Hauser was murdered.<eos> Well, you weren't exactly wearing a poker face.<eos> Ryan does say weird things.<eos> He even said you wanted me to ask you to prom and that you'd bought a dress.<eos> It's not pink, is it?
Hey, guys!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Nice.<eos> - Heimdall says the way ahead is clear.<eos> - Let's move out.<eos> You are the one they call Thor.<eos> I am Anubis.<eos> As I have told your lieutenant, I will reveal nothing to you.<eos> This device... will be implanted into your brain.<eos> It will form a link between your mind and the ship's computer.
Mothership's retreating.<eos> It's over.<eos> That's it?<eos> Their examination of the android must've yielded results - it looks like the Asgard have the upper hand against the replicators.<eos> What about Thor?<eos> They managed to remove the device from his brain, but it may be too late.<eos> Apparently he's lapsed into a coma.<eos> If they knew more about the device they might be able to help him.<eos> They're studying it now towards that end.<eos> Unfortunately, it's unlike anything they've ever encountered.
Either shut up or go help Jackson get the force field back on.<eos> - (Carter) How many?<eos> - Several gliders, a battalion of warriors.<eos> You wanna be on this side when we get this up again.<eos> Just tell us when.<eos> Go.<eos> Save yourselves.<eos> I will remain here as long as this flame burns.<eos> Marul...<eos> As long is it burns, the Caretaker lives.
It's classified information, Jonas.<eos> But we can use it to find the real assassin...maybe.<eos> - So how do these things work?<eos> - It's a two- part process.<eos> First, you pass a person through a scanning device, which uploads their image into a holographic sequencer.<eos> - Which looks like this.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Then you place that sequencer on your body and you instantly take on the appearance of the person scanned.<eos> - Was the scanning device taken?<eos> - No, it's still at Area 51.
- Then you are most welcome.<eos> And food and supplies for your people.<eos> - Glorious! -<eos> And, of course, weapons.<eos> Earth weapons.<eos> Take no offence, my friend, but your weapons are primitive by comparison.<eos> Carter, I think a little demonstration is in order.<eos> Don't you?<eos> This weapon is called a P- 90.<eos> It carries a 50- round, top- loading magazine of Teflon- coated ordnance with a cyclical rate of fire of 900 rounds per minute.
He's wrong!<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right.<eos> He's, like, my oldest friend, and he stabbed me in the back.<eos> So, Kelso, how many things around here have you put your butt on?<eos> Let's start with what I haven't put my butt on.<eos> Oh, just a moment.<eos> Red, it's somebody about buying the Corvette. (Grunts)<eos> Well, Marlin, we've just seen the male of the herd grunt his displeasure.<eos> But what does it mean?
So, Mr. Hammond said it was fine for me to miss class 'cause I'm already getting an "A."<eos> So just as you suspected, Mom... I am better than everybody.<eos> All I know is, my little boy was very brave at the dentist today.<eos> Wasn't he?<eos> Yes, he was, my "wittle snicklefwitz."<eos> Okay, Mom, uh, when a boy reaches a certain age... the baby voice no longer comforts him.<eos> It urges him to kill.
- I thought I had it in the basement.<eos> - Eric, please!<eos> Your mother is having a breakdown.<eos> No.<eos> The only thing having a breakdown around here is the clicker!<eos> Why won't it click, Red?<eos> Nothing loves me!<eos> Okay, Eric.<eos> Jackie just told me... that Hyde told her that you hate the ring.<eos> I happen to think it's beautiful.
I already did. - (Squeals)<eos> First of all, Jackie is not my girlfriend.<eos> And second of all, I'm not the only one who spills stuff around here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> Hey, Kelso. Hyde watches Little House on the Prairie.<eos> Little House on the Prairie?<eos> It reminds me of a simpler time.<eos> How could Eric lose that ring?<eos> And more importantly, how could he think it was ugly?
Hello?<eos> The Lindsey case, right?<eos> No, Lindsey.<eos> Martin Lindsey.<eos> Who the fuck is Denise Redding?<eos> -What the fuck did you do to him?<eos> -Here's yours, Mike.<eos> I don't even fucking remember this one.<eos> I swear I don't.<eos> Well, it's down.
Fact is, I wouldn't be surprised if it's why he picked me for this case.<eos> What does he....<eos> What are you going to--<eos> He's got me if he wants me.<eos> Thing is, I don't think he wants me.<eos> Too much at stake.<eos> Too much mess.<eos> Kind of like this case.<eos> I have to admit it, Jimmy, this is a great case.<eos> Not just because of Greggs, because it goes to that and answers that... but because of how deep it goes.
Nicely done.<eos> Motherfucker, I been here since lunch, waiting.<eos> Ain't nobody been through here.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I been waiting and y'all ain't about shit.<eos> Yeah, listen, listen to me.<eos> Look, if you feel like that, then get off this phone... come down here and step to me then, nigger.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> Yo, if Roc-Roc ain't here in 10 minutes with my re-up... whoop his ass, man.<eos> I understand you did a tour in Homicide years ago... but let me tell you how I run this unit, because how I run it is how it runs.
We've got $30,000 in buy money, courtesy of our friends over at DEA.<eos> But the thing is, they can't have that money walking on them.<eos> Definitely not.<eos> So Kima will be in the car for the buy, fronting as our Cl's girl.<eos> Looking the part, too.<eos> Now, where's your weapon gonna be?<eos> He might pat me, so it has to stash in the car.<eos> I figure when Savino gets in the car at the cut-rate...<eos> I'll be going in back.<eos> It'll be up under the rear seat.
I mean, I gotta start thinking more.<eos> You be saying that all the time and you right.<eos> But I'm saying though, I mean... the shit y'all pulled with that security lady.<eos> It was tight.<eos> I mean, that state lawyer.<eos> I ain't never seen a white woman turn so red.<eos> You should've been there.<eos> Yo, man, you family, okay?<eos> But that shit cost money.<eos> It cost time and money.
Okay!<eos> This Prank Day is over.<eos> Let's just watch TV.<eos> Hey, Fez, I think there's a Nancy Drew on.<eos> Oh! She can solve my mystery any day.<eos> And by the way, the mystery is in my pants.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> I got a peanut in my ear.<eos> Yeah. I used chunky, so it might get up in your brain.
It was just a bit of fun.<eos> Oh, you're probably right, as usual.<eos> - You will keep an eye on Frodo?<eos> - Two eyes.<eos> As often as I can spare them.<eos> - I'm leaving him everything.<eos> - What about the ring?<eos> - Is that staying too?<eos> - Yes, yes.<eos> It's in an envelope over there on the mantelpiece.
I apologize if it's a shock.<eos> Well, I dated a lawyer for three years... so ethically speaking, I've seen a stretch mark or two.<eos> Normally, I don't tell a woman that on the first date.<eos> Then again, I don't normally have these feelings.<eos> Me, neither.<eos> You see this ring?<eos> My father gave this to me... to remind me every day how much he loved me.<eos> My father believed in fate, and so do I.<eos> Used to be his lucky ring.<eos> Now it's yours.
Now, some people get all freaked and obsessed by these.<eos> Why?<eos> It's what it represents.<eos> Power, taste, superiority.<eos> That's all in the mind... of the person who puts a price on it.<eos> What's it mean to me?<eos> Not a damn thing.<eos> Too hard to fence.<eos> Now, the ring, on the other hand... is priceless.<eos> It symbolizes the day my life changed... the day I met you.
It was like sleeping with a damp sheep.<eos> Asshole.<eos> She's just upset because I'm dumping her.<eos> Eleven more months where she came from, sir.<eos> Right.<eos> What I want to know, Earl... is what are you doing about this schmeggege... keeps breaking into my houses?<eos> I have my people working on it...<eos> people you don't need to know about... and if they could find a certain blue dress... and they by God did, they can find this weasel like that.<eos> Max, why not just give back the goddamn ring?<eos> We've got bigger fish to fry. It's not your ring.
What about Soneji's state of mind?<eos> I'm not going to comment on his mental stability.<eos> You can draw your own conclusions.<eos> - So?<eos> - The file on Soneji,<eos> - is it still on your kitchen table?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm gonna have another look at it.<eos> This business about the diamonds, money, I didn't see it coming.
- Here's some water.<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - A friend's.<eos> How long have I been here?<eos> Two days now.<eos> Shh. You really should rest.<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> - Well enough to leave?<eos> - Israeli hospitality kills me.<eos> - No, it just saved your life.
So fragile.<eos> Too fine.<eos> How could I ever touch her...?<eos> Touch her with these?<eos> She wasn't made to bear children.<eos> And after you there weren't supposed to be any more children, the doctor said.<eos> So it was...<eos> It was my fault that she had to die.<eos> The guilt, Elsa...<eos> It's eating me away... bit by bit.
Except for these guys.<eos> Then how do I seem to know exactly where I'm going?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Anybody home?<eos> You two check out that stuff, see if it's there.<eos> I'll sort out the O'Connells.<eos> You know, if you move that fast enough, you can almost write your name.<eos> I just had a vision.<eos> It was like my dream... but it was real.
Well. what are you going to tell him ?<eos> We have searched every room in there inch by inch.<eos> And now I need them to be blessed. Off<eos> M a'a m, please, wait it's still very early!<eos> Mr. Tuttle.<eos> Good morning. ma'am.<eos> I need you to search the whole garden for gravestones.<eos> Gravestones?<eos> Yes, when my husband bought this house we were told there was a little cemetery<eos> I think it was somewhere over there amongst the trees.
That's what I like about him.<eos> It's also what scares the hell out of me.<eos> Just so you know, we've got a couple of great clients in our hip pockets.<eos> Plus, some leads on some new accounts.<eos> So we come to you fully loaded.<eos> You're not selling me a car, Holland.<eos> Frankly, I'm not impressed with you. But your reputation precedes you.<eos> And if I have to take him to get you, I will.<eos> So here's my offer.<eos> It's good as long as we're at this table.
And I'm holding the Quidditch Cup.<eos> And bloody hell!<eos> I'm Quidditch captain too!<eos> I look good.<eos> Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?<eos> How can it?<eos> Both my parents are dead.<eos> Back again, Harry?<eos> I see that you, like many before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.<eos> I trust by now you realize what it does.
I look good.<eos> Harry, do you think this mirror shows the future?<eos> How can it?<eos> Both my parents are dead.<eos> Back again, Harry?<eos> I see that you, like many before you have discovered the delights of the Mirror of Erised.<eos> I trust by now you realize what it does.<eos> Let me give you a clue.<eos> The happiest man on earth would look in the mirror and see only himself exactly as he is.<eos> So then, it shows us what we want.

See to her needs.<eos> - Madame du Barry?<eos> - That trollop my husband's grandfather maintained.<eos> Well, I...<eos> I pray the whispers are mere court gossip.<eos> Otherwise, du Barry's banishment would find you without a buyer.<eos> If you would permit, we are foggy on the exact order of events.<eos> If Her Majesty would try the necklace on?<eos> Perhaps...<eos> It is a phenomenon.
Making decisions.<eos> Doing things and taking the consequences.<eos> It might be true that there are six billion people in the world and counting.<eos> Nevertheless, what you do makes a difference.<eos> It makes a difference, first of all, in material terms.<eos> Makes a difference to other people and it sets an example.<eos> In short, I think the message here is... that we should never simply write ourselves off... and see ourselves as the victim of various forces.<eos> It's always our decision who we are.<eos> Creation seems to come out of imperfection.<eos> It seems to come out of a striving and a frustration.
What about quantum mechanics?<eos> "I know enough contemporary physical theory to know it's not really like that.<eos> "It's really a probabilistic theory.<eos> There's room.<eos> It's loose.<eos> It's not deterministic".<eos> And that's gonna enable us to understand free will.<eos> But if you look at the details, it's not really gonna help... because what happens is you have some very small quantum particles, and their behavior is apparently a bit random.<eos> They swerve. Their behavior is absurd in the sense that it's unpredictable... and we can't understand it based on anything that came before.<eos> It just does something out of the blue, according to a probabilistic framework.
Those moments, those what you might call liminal, limit, frontier, edge zone experiences... are actually now becoming the norm.<eos> These multiplicities and distinctions and differences... that have given great difficulty to the old mind... are actually through entering into their very essence, tasting and feeling their uniqueness.<eos> One might make a breakthrough to that common something... that holds them together.<eos> And so the main character is, to this new mind, greater, greater mind.<eos> A mind that yet is to be.<eos> And when we are obviously entered into that mode, you can see a radical subjectivity, radical attunement to individuality, uniqueness to that which the mind is, opens itself to a vast objectivity.<eos> So the story is the story of the cosmos now.<eos> The moment is not just a passing, empty nothing yet.<eos> And this is in the way in which these secret passages happen.<eos> Yes, it's empty with such fullness... that the great moment, the great life of the universe... is pulsating in it.
That's one of the reasons I enjoy you. You can... bring me into that.<eos> If the world that we are forced to accept is false and nothing is true, then everything is possible.<eos> On the way to discovering what we love, we will find everything we hate, everything that blocks our path to what we desire.<eos> The comfort will never be comfortable for those who seek what is not on the market.<eos> A systematic questioning of the idea of happiness.<eos> We'll cut the vocal chords of every empowered speaker.<eos> We'll yank the social symbols through the looking glass.<eos> We'll devalue society's currency.<eos> To confront the familiar.<eos> Society is a fraud so complete and venal... that it demands to be destroyed beyond the power of memory to recall its existence.
You're a psychic.<eos> Put me down, please".<eos> And I float down, and as my feet touch the ground, the psychic turns into this woman in a green dress.<eos> And this woman is Lady Gregory.<eos> Now, Lady Gregory was Yeats' patron, this, you know, Irish person.<eos> And though I'd never seen her image, I was just sure that this was the face of Lady Gregory.<eos> So we're walking along, and Lady Gregory turns to me and says,<eos> "Let me explain to you the nature of the universe.<eos> "Now, Philip K. Dick is right about time, but he's wrong that it's 50 A.D.<eos> "Actually, there's only one instant, and it's right now.
And she got a ten percent employee discount on whatever she wanted. Nylon stockings,<eos> Makeup and perfume.<eos> Doris and I went to church once a week.<eos> Usually Tuesday night.<eos> Doris wasn't big on divine worship,<eos> And I doubt if she believed in life everlasting.<eos> She'd most likely tell you that our reward is on this earth,<eos> And bingo is probably the extent of it.<eos> Watch you card, honey.<eos> I wasn't crazy about the game, But, I don't know, it made her happy,
I thought you spoke to her.<eos> I'll be going.<eos> - 'Bye.<eos> - 'Bye.<eos> In my flowery dress I ask him to quiz me after school.<eos> Flowery dress<eos> Well, that's that!<eos> You still have that old dress you found?<eos> The one with the flowers?<eos> Does it mean so much to you?
- 'Bye.<eos> - 'Bye.<eos> In my flowery dress I ask him to quiz me after school.<eos> Flowery dress<eos> Well, that's that!<eos> You still have that old dress you found?<eos> The one with the flowers?<eos> Does it mean so much to you?<eos> It was covered in stains.<eos> If it's not in the machine, check the basket.
OTTO: You see?<eos> She's still as curious as ever.<eos> Let me see your book.<eos> Let me see.<eos> OTTO: Wait.<eos> Grandma has another surprise.<eos> And here's your present, Anne.<eos> A fountain pen.<eos> Look, Margot.<eos> It's beautiful.
I don't want to go to heaven.<eos> You're dead when you're in heaven.<eos> But the angels are in heaven, and it's wonderful there.<eos> Adi won't eat her pudding.<eos> We have to be quiet now, because Aunt Hermine is taking her nap.<eos> - Want to go for a walk? - Yeah!<eos> Be very quiet.<eos> - Adi's dress is all dirty.<eos> - Don't worry, dear.<eos> Put it in the laundry. It'll be clean tomorrow.
-Package for Robert Garfield.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Sign here.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> Whenever it wants, the past can come kicking the door down.<eos> And you never know where it's gonna take you.
And that's when I started doing whatever I wanted... and not giving a flying fuck what people thought.<eos> Fuck!<eos> So I don't really have any friends.<eos> I don't need any.<eos> We're friends.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard in my life.<eos> Don't fucking call me stupid.<eos> I didn't say you were stupid, butch.<eos> I said your opinion was stupid, because it is.
You're a shit, a queer.<eos> All right, I'll go.<eos> But you're coming with me.<eos> We'll each fill a jug.<eos> But if you're scared...<eos> They say it's switched off.<eos> But I don't believe it.<eos> Put your ear against it, you'll hear ticking.<eos> That's its heart.<eos> It's still alive.
- We were pretending to be intellectuals.<eos> - It's amazing.<eos> I love your coat.<eos> - I overdressed.<eos> I mean, I underdressed.<eos> I'll continue like you're both listening to me.<eos> - Do you have another room to put it in?<eos> - I have ceased to exist.<eos> Madison Square Garden is nearby.<eos> It might fit there.
"Kiki, my butter has touched another food. I need new butter."<eos> "Anything you want, honey." That's how it goes, right?<eos> You're a publicist.<eos> Anything they want, right?<eos> She's got a green dress.<eos> Looks like crap on her.<eos> Brings out the circles under her eyes.<eos> We both know it.<eos> She gave it to me.<eos> It looks nice on me.
It's a divorce.<eos> From you?<eos> Yes.<eos> This is Sanchez.<eos> He's a notary public.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, sir.<eos> You just sign here and initial here and sign there.<eos> You own this building, don't you, Henry?<eos> Hmm. It's magnificent.
Where's the audience?<eos> Where's the magic?<eos> I'll tell you.<eos> In a place like this, the magic is all around you.<eos> The trick is to see it.<eos> Luke... ... IthinkyoulovedTheMajestic even more than I did.<eos> -You've got to remember that.<eos> -I don't.<eos> It sounds crazy, but I promise we can make this place like it was!<eos> I don't know how it was.
I'd had a bellyful of the Ranch!<eos> I'd had enough of Milo!<eos> I've got a great new job.<eos> Receptionist at the Park Hotel.<eos> Night receptionist?<eos> That's right, but at least I work!<eos> I'm not on welfare!<eos> I bring home the bacon!<eos> You've smoked all my dope?<eos> Oh, no, here it is.
Show me.<eos> I told you he didn't like strangers.<eos> He's bleeding!<eos> It's a good sign.<eos> He's stopped crying.<eos> You have replaced him as it were.<eos> The tears of the world are a constant quantity.<eos> For each one who begins to weep, somewhere else another stops.<eos> The same is true of the laugh.<eos> Let us not then speak ill of our generation,.. ...it is not any unhappier than its predecessors.
- Where was I?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Ah yes!<eos> The night.<eos> Look!<eos> Will you look at the sky, pig!<eos> Good, that's enough.<eos> What is there so extraordinary about it?<eos> Qua sky.<eos> It is pale and luminous like any sky at this hour of the day.
Good, that's enough.<eos> What is there so extraordinary about it?<eos> Qua sky.<eos> It is pale and luminous like any sky at this hour of the day.<eos> At this time a year...<eos> In these latitudes.<eos> When the weather is fine.<eos> An hour ago roughly after having poured forth even since say ten o'clock in the morning tirelessly torrents of red and white light it begins to lose its effulgence,.. ...to grow pale... pale ever a little paler,.. a little paler until...<eos> Finished!<eos> It comes to rest.
Things have changed here since yesterday.<eos> And if he doesn't come?<eos> We'll see when the time comes.<eos> I was saying that things have changed here since yesterday.<eos> Everything oozes.<eos> Look at the tree.<eos> It's never the same pus from one second to the next.<eos> The tree, look at the tree.<eos> And was it not there yesterday?<eos> Yes of course it was there yesterday.
Yes, you do.<eos> That's the word that starts with a "D."<eos> I'm tired.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Are you calling me a liar?<eos> Yes. I think you have to read the word.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah, you have to read that word.<eos> No.<eos> Yeah. Here it is.
Thank you for coming here today, Annie.<eos> You're welcome, Sam.<eos> Can Sam add?<eos> Yes.<eos> What about multiplication?<eos> He's learning.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> He can't multiply two times two?<eos> I don't know about you, Mr. Turner... but my memories of my parents... have nothing to do with the times table... or with state capitals.<eos> A truck ran into the state capital building... and it went on fire on television.
Mr. Kao?<eos> Jack never showed up.<eos> He never called either.<eos> It snowed in Tokyo that winter.<eos> She wandered around with the cell-phone Jack left for her.<eos> The crowded streets were full of workers, students, housewives.<eos> She pretended to be one of them.<eos> She ate noodles. Watched TVshows.<eos> Hung Jack's coat around her shoulders.<eos> It smelt of after-shave and cigarettes.
- No!<eos> - Yes.<eos> Because you were in love with Alice Young, the woman who lived across the road.<eos> If there's anything you need, please call.<eos> You nearly got away with it.<eos> Your wife had killed herself and exonerated you.<eos> Dr. Whitfield was in Canada.<eos> Nobody would have even known about the fake disease.<eos> But then your wife wrote that second letter.<eos> Was it just to clear her conscience?
I was thirsty.<eos> It's so cold.<eos> Did I keep you from sleeping well?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I keep thinking I've turned your life upside down. By moving in here.<eos> Would it be better if I moved out?<eos> You've lost a button.<eos> Are you saying this place is too small?<eos> It's fine for one person, but with me here...<eos> It's too small for you?
Like what?<eos> If we were destined to meet, I thought we'd meet by chance somewhere.<eos> Know what fate is?<eos> Building a bridge of chance for someone you love.<eos> To be honest, I read you guys letters.<eos> I said this tree had a secret, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Look closely.<eos> Does this tree look the same as before?<eos> Well, it looks like it changed a bit.
Does this tree look the same as before?<eos> Well, it looks like it changed a bit.<eos> But I'm not sure.<eos> People are dead or alive.<eos> There's a dead tree and a living tree, too.<eos> This tree was struck dead by lightning last year.<eos> It was split into two.<eos> But this young man felt sorry for it.<eos> During this spring, he planted another tree that looked the same.<eos> When he planted the tree, he asked me if it look the same.

- Monica.<eos> - Monica...<eos> You're wonderful!<eos> You resemble the girl from Dallas.<eos> Pamela?<eos> No one told me that before.<eos> It's true.<eos> I've got a sixth sense for resemblances.<eos> This dress is wonderful, too!<eos> It would fit over the chair of my bedroom.
Good bye, Alicia.<eos> Good bye, Pedro.<eos> I will always love you.<eos> But you're leaving all the same.<eos> Noooo!<eos> What is it?<eos> Pedro, don't go.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> What my heart tells me to.<eos> What does it tell you?
I come from three generations of Donovars who starved on land that finally became rich in two things.<eos> coal and dinosaur bones.<eos> I got a lot of poverty to make up for. that's for sure.<eos> We're here on a year's visit so my daughter can do society and I can furnish the family home.<eos> yu noticed my daughter?<eos> Well. I couldn't fail to. sir.<eos> She has that effect just like her mother.<eos> May I ask her name? It's Gladys.<eos> It means mistress of the land.<eos> I thought it was Irish when I gave it to her. It turns out to be Welsh.
A brand?<eos> A tattoo in gun powder.<eos> During the Crimean War, deserters were marked in this way.<eos> Then, he was a coward.<eos> No, he had great courage.<eos> His wounds attest to that.<eos> A sabre cut, a bullet wound, grapeshot there, sustained all at once, they would have proved fatal.<eos> So he was wounded, recovered and fought again.<eos> And thus had great courage.<eos> Courage is a finite resource. Eventually exhausted by the terrors it fights.
Forgive me, but I noticed you've been experimenting the roots of Carolina Jasmine.<eos> So, the subject of analgesia must be much on your mind.<eos> Does that battle scar trouble you Doyle.<eos> No.<eos> Warner told me about your heroic bare knuckle bout.<eos> Sometimes violence is a duty.<eos> Granted, but it must never become a pleasure, even though the mind is in turmoil and the heart is heavy.<eos> I cut this, from the hood, of the second victim.<eos> Do you see the silver gray smear.<eos> By the way it catches the light, it could be metallic.
I know, I know, it sounds crazy..<eos> ...talking about finding a crack in time under the East River.<eos> But in, in point, in point fact, Gretchen you know it is no more crazy than,..<eos> ...uh, a dog finding a rainbow.<eos> Dogs are color-blind, Gretchen.<eos> They don't see color.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Just like we can't see time.<eos> We can feel it.<eos> Oh... we can feel it passing but, uh, we can't see it; it's just a blur.

Hmm?<eos> Imagine if we could stop that train get out,..<eos> ...look around and see time for what it really is.
!<eos> Well, they'll probably find them in the morning, sir.<eos> Then again, sheep like shoes.<eos> § Now, it seems like days §<eos> § Roll into one §<eos> § Sleep through rain §<eos> § And sleep in the sun §<eos> § Although we lie awake every night<eos> § Searching for fun §<eos> § Oh, but it never comes §
I appreciate that.<eos> Really?<eos> Yes... but I already have all the help I need.<eos> Ah... of course.<eos> You'll undoubtedly be running more simulations with the Chakotay hologram.<eos> No, actually.<eos> I'll see you at 1800 hours.<eos> I've reconsidered your offer.<eos> I thought you might.<eos> I'll give you the shield emitter, but not until I've inspected the device you're offering... to make sure it's genuine.
What is it?<eos> Judging from the tachyon emissions, some sort of temporal rift.<eos> How's it being generated?<eos> That's what we're trying to figure out.<eos> If Starfleet Command finds out I had anything to do with this, they'll demote me back to Ensign.<eos> You worry too much, Harry.<eos> It's turning you gray.<eos> Propulsion's on line.<eos> Plasma flow stable.<eos> This device of Korath's... it produces too much tachyokinetic energy.

Richard Fish for Jane Wilco.<eos> We seek an order to prohibit the defendant from exploiting pictures.<eos> Nothing unlawful here.<eos> We have a contract.<eos> Permit me to finish, Mr. Line.<eos> Any contract presumes a meeting of minds.<eos> My client had no idea what she was signing.<eos> We require signatures...<eos> To create a presumed agreement.<eos> But it's rebuttable.
Melanie wants me to watch her class.<eos> She's reading from her new book.<eos> - What if she...?<eos> - Unacceptable.<eos> Fine!<eos> Next time, you make the conversation.<eos> Should've picked up the check.<eos> I just came from the bridal shop.<eos> My dress is perfect.<eos> It's really so, so gorgeous.
- You're following me--<eos> - I've checked.<eos> They'll use you for good PR, offer to host a fundraiser.<eos> Money starts rolling in, but you're not the one counting it so who knows how much they're keeping?<eos> Next, they'll give you a list of necessary expenses.<eos> But what do you know, after a number of untraceable fees you're left with 5 percent, tops.<eos> You follow me, take my picture, steal my wallet....<eos> - Why should I believe you?<eos> - Wolfram Hart aren't what they seem.<eos> They show the world one face, but it's not the truth.
Cordy, the purpose of an inventory--<eos> That "purpose of an inventory" speech again.<eos> This wasn't my idea.<eos> Angel keeps complaining that the weapons cabinet is all different.<eos> But who's the boss?<eos> You, or the guy with the pancreas dagger?<eos> What time is it?<eos> For those of you playing the home game that's three minutes from the last time you asked.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I believe the more you're aware of time, the slower it moves which could make light-speed travel possible, but--
Some detectives.<eos> You have no idea where our daughter is, do you?<eos> Maybe they do.<eos> Maybe they don't want us to find her.<eos> I'm sorry about the bar, but Fred's missing.<eos> We need help.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm not some mystical vending machine here to spit out answers.<eos> I have a heart.<eos> Granted, it's in my butt but it's still a heart and it's broken.
How about the baby?<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> I think you need to prepare yourself for the worst.<eos> - No.<eos> - The baby's heartbeat is very faint.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I'm not sure we can do anything.<eos> Her body isn't a life-giving vessel.<eos> I don't know that it's equipped to bring a baby to term.
We have to get him out of the castle.<eos> If challenged, he must accept?<eos> As champion of the realm, he cannot refuse.<eos> We'll worry about that later.<eos> First we get him out.<eos> Then we create diversions here, here and here.<eos> We'll scale the wall here, where their defenses are weak.<eos> I wouldn't split my crew up that much.<eos> I'm leading this charge. Tell me about the killing device.<eos> It sends a signal to the collar on every slave.
Of course!<eos> The holy books are written in trionic.<eos> What?<eos> No one volume is complete without the other two.<eos> It's one book broken up into three pieces.<eos> - Like a trilogy.<eos> - No.<eos> Much more complex than that.<eos> See this passage?<eos> It continues in this volume, here then concludes in this one.
Apparently you are.<eos> If you don't stop interrupting, I will be too.<eos> [MUMBLES] Pretzel?<eos> [CHAIR SCREECHES] - Do you mind?<eos> - [MUMBLES] I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, that's it, Dad!<eos> Is there nothing you do that doesn't create some cacophony?<eos> Well, I didn't do it on purpose.<eos> I was trying to be considerate.<eos> If you were, you would have oiled that chair when it began squeaking five years ago.
We're people in costumes drinking.<eos> Amen!<eos> Here, Roz, uh, would you take a picture of Marty Crane with his hero, Joe DiMaggio.<eos> - It'll make a great Christmas card. FRASIER: Yeah, good idea, Dad.<eos> You've already ruined Halloween.<eos> Why not ruin Christmas too? NILES:<eos> Frasier, come on, relax.<eos> We're just having fun.<eos> Hey, have a beer.<eos> It really takes the edge off.
No, it's because that way the camera only sees her.<eos> You want to try it?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> That was good.<eos> That was really good.<eos> But I think that maybe your hands are just a little off.<eos> - They should be, maybe... Like, right... - Mm.<eos> Well, I feel like a snack.<eos> Do you want some shortbread?<eos> It's Scottish, like you are.
They go up to his room, they have sex... after which she buries a telephone receiver into his head.<eos> Cash was stolen, wallet and I.D. left behind.<eos> We talk to this guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He hung up on me.<eos> He said that his wife was in the next room.<eos> So, we got a pro who likes to get violent.<eos> Maybe.<eos> One thing stood out on the 61.<eos> Here it is."Victim says assailant wanted him to get rough with her...
- That is it.<eos> Slow down, you're moving too fast.<eos> Solomon's here.<eos> What's going on?<eos> He put my stapler inside a jelly again.<eos> That's the third time.<eos> It wasn't funny the first time.<eos> Why has he done that?<eos> - I told him I don't like jelly.<eos> I don't trust the way it moves.
WHO?<eos> MR. PETTIGREW.<eos> A HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER BACK HOME IN HAZELHURST.<eos> HE WAS ACCUSED OF EXPOSING HIMSELF TO ONE OF HIS STUDENTS.<eos> HE SWORE IT WASN'T TRUE, THAT THE KID WAS LYING 'CAUSE HE FLUNKED HIM.<eos> AND I SUPPOSE YOU'RE GOING TO TELL ME HE WAS BEATEN TO DEATH,<eos> OR HUNG HIMSELF IN HIS JAIL CELL.<eos> [ Scoffing ] NO, NO. NO, HE WENT TO LIVE WITH HIS SPINSTER SISTER IN MERIDIAN.<eos> WHEN HE DIED A FEW YEARS LATER, THEY SAY HE PUT IN HIS WILL THAT HE DIDN'T WANT HIS NAME ON HIS TOMBSTONE...<eos> BECAUSE IT WAS WORTHLESS.
Jodi wouldn't let anything keep her from getting to that party.<eos> Pete.<eos> Perfect.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Perfect flowers for a perfect date.<eos> They're beautiful, Pete.<eos> So is that dress.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It was my mom's.
The detail's amazing.<eos> Carey spent months working on it.<eos> He used to joke that it wouldn't be finished by the time we got back to Earth.<eos> He only had one nacelle to go.<eos> We were able to download the probe's memory core.<eos> We'll transmit the telemetry in the next datastream.<eos> I think about our ancestors... thousands of years wondering if they were alone in the universe, finally discovering they weren't.<eos> You can't blame them for wanting to reach out, see how many other species were out there asking the same questions.<eos> The urge to explore is pretty powerful.<eos> But it can't justify the loss of lives... whether it's millions... or just one.
We've already injected the gel packs in the other time frames.<eos> That just leaves the ones here.<eos> It's in both our interests to work together.<eos> I agree.<eos> Let him go.<eos> You believe him?<eos> His story is too preposterous to be a lie.<eos> I'll admit, it's an ingenious solution.<eos> I'm glad you're cooperating.<eos> Oh, I believe in cooperation, as long as it benefits me.
- We found no evidence of battle.<eos> - I found one clue.<eos> Here.<eos> This word loosely translates as "medicine", "vaccine", "drug",<eos> Followed by "from the newcomers",<eos> Followed by "causes", followed by some word I can't translate.<eos> This was the latest issue we found, which most likely indicates the paper shut down or was shut down the very next day.<eos> Vaccine causes what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But it caused something.
Those of us who actually have been voted into office would like the opportunity to make the damn decisions about the governments we make treaties with.<eos> - You don't have all the information.<eos> - I know all about the note.<eos> - That's why you should take it seriously.<eos> - We have experts who know these things.<eos> They tell me that the ink on your note was a new biodegradable something-or-other that hasn't quite been invented yet.<eos> - What's your point?<eos> - What's the future like?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> - As far as I know, it hasn't happened yet.
- We're hopin'.<eos> - Why?<eos> - He might tell us what he told Simmons.<eos> - You have to find him first.<eos> This is unacceptable.<eos> We allowed all your teams to return home safely.<eos> We even allowed you to send out another team on a new reconnaissance mission.<eos> We expect nothing less than everything on that list in return.<eos> Your government agreed to allow us to use your gate, period.<eos> It mentioned nothing of any demands.
- It is a weapon of great power, O'Neill.<eos> Big and honking'?<eos> From what I can decipher, the people on 636 had a similar technological timeline to Earth.<eos> They had just discovered their Stargate when "the threat from the skies" came.<eos> Goa'ulds.<eos> Yet they managed to build an incredibly advanced weapon to defend themselves.<eos> Couldn't have been so advanced.<eos> The place was a disaster.<eos> It obviously didn't work.<eos> Actually, it did.
- That's so cool.<eos> That's exactly what I said.<eos> I said that.<eos> If that's the case, what's keeping it inside this cylinder?<eos> That was Dr. Lee's idea.<eos> The top and bottom plates are electrified.<eos> The field seems to be holding it in.<eos> You're not hurting it, are you?<eos> The creature has no physical body.<eos> I don't think it's capable of feeling pain.

When we went back to my planet and we saw that it was gone, I couldn't handle it.<eos> And the real-estate job was driving me crazy.<eos> I just wanted to forget everything.<eos> You were gonna keep takin' pills all your life?<eos> Another month and the long-term memory loss would've been permanent.<eos> Oh... oh, no!<eos> - What is the matter, Martin Lloyd?<eos> - The show is based on your programme.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's on cable.
Oh, you just don't understand technology.<eos> No.<eos> But I sure know how to tell time.<eos> Wow. What a view.<eos> Just like a postcard.<eos> It is so beautiful I could cry.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Drinking looks like fun.<eos> And all the cool kids do it.<eos> But it leads you down a sad, lonely, confused path, man.
I mean... I mean, damn, Donna. If you can see a future for yourself without me and that doesn't, like, break your heart... then we're not doing what I thought we were doing here.<eos> And you know what?<eos> Maybe we shouldn't even be together at all!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Well... are you giving back that ring?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Leo, I... I need to return this.<eos> - Hey, man...<eos> I only said it was gold, not real gold.
I don't know whose ass he was kissing there because I think you' re just vindictive.<eos> What was Josh Lyman, a warning shot?<eos> That was my son.<eos> What did I ever do to yours, but praise his glory and praise his name?<eos> There's a tropical storm that's gaining speed and power.<eos> We haven't had a storm this bad since you took out that tender ship of mine in the North Atlantic last year, 68 crew.<eos> You know what a tender ship doe's?<eos> It fixes the other ships.<eos> It doe'sn't even carry guns.<eos> It just goes around and fixes the other ships and delivers the mail.

In the net!<eos> Get the light!<eos> Down there!<eos> Further out!<eos> Get Coast Guard on the radio!<eos> Tell them to send a chopper out!<eos> Doesn't look like there's any big reason to hurry.<eos> So, what's the deal here?<eos> Body was found at sea.<eos> D.A. wants to know how it got there.
Consume.<eos> Mulder came to see you last year.<eos> Not to save Marie Hangemuhl.<eos> To save himself.<eos> Mulder was dying, but he kept it a secret.<eos> He had an undiagnosed brain disease.<eos> He was a sick man, desperate to find a cure.<eos> They all are.<eos> Mulder didn't do it.<eos> Agent Mulder saw how it suffered.
Interesting?<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> Isn't that what you're here to tell us?<eos> Oh, I have my own thoughts.<eos> It's just, what we think happened and what actually happened aren't always the same thing but not altogether insignifiicant, either.<eos> I'm sorry, this feels like therapy.<eos> What happened being different from what we want to have happened.<eos> What who wants to have happened?<eos> Well, I'm told this case involves you.<eos> It may involve someone close to me.
And do what we feel like!<eos> Sure. Sounds good.<eos> Do we not deserve that, Pelle? Aren't we worth it, when we've worked so hard?<eos> Only a few more yards!<eos> A new day is dawning!<eos> Come on then!<eos> There's a time for everything, Tomas.<eos> There's a time for everything.<eos> Your time will come, Tomas.<eos> It will... I know that.
- He's talking, he's talking, can't you hear him?<eos> - No.<eos> - [Voiceover] Keep alert. - Come here.<eos> - Why are all these cops after you?<eos> And why are you wearing handcuffs?<eos> - They think I did a bank job.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'll explain later.<eos> - [Wendell] Would you two stop rabbiting and help me find the mirror?<eos> Now, it's a mirror but it may not look like a mirror from the other side.
Well, looks like he's one of us now.<eos> Ahh.<eos> Who booked this trip, anyway?<eos> Ah, you'll be at the nesting grounds soon enough.<eos> Well, when I get there, I'm gonna give Kron a piece of my mind.<eos> You tell him, Eema.<eos> If I could sleep that deep, I'd be in paradise.<eos> If you could sleep that deep, honey, you'd be dead.<eos> This plant grew on our island.<eos> It will make you feel better.
I don't understand what you're talking about.<eos> I presume you want us to go on?<eos> Let's do that...<eos> Though I'm not happy with my part.<eos> Where shall we go from here?<eos> David's letter, for instance.<eos> David's letter.<eos> If you say so.<eos> I think I have it in my bag.<eos> Here it is.
They serve Italian dinner tonight.<eos> I think I'll have the Toreodor.<eos> Yabooty, yabooty, you camel, pay me what you owe me.<eos> Keep a low profile.<eos> Did he call me a camel.<eos> They wanted you to play a saxophone solo after which intermission?<eos> The White House itinerary said after the first intermission that I would appear magically on stage through a trap-door.<eos> But we don't have a sax.<eos> We will.<eos> -Hey hello, do you want to taste an ice-cream, it's very, very good.
I'm Karen, by the way.<eos> Yes?<eos> This is in Seattle?<eos> Right.<eos> Jake, give me your number.<eos> I'll call you back in an hour.<eos> - Tsutomu? - Yeah.<eos> Jake Cronin, Cellular One Fraud Division.<eos> Whew! Man, 15 minutes ago, the sun was out.<eos> In half an hour, it will be again.
He was different with me.<eos> He was tender.<eos> We had a time, Henry and I.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> So can you imagine his anger... at not being able to make love to you now?<eos> - I've seen it.<eos> - You've seen it?<eos> As in, he raped you?<eos> Rape is an act of anger.<eos> It's about control, not about sex.
- These guys are here to help you, Betty.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> C'mon! C'mere! C'mere!<eos> C'mere! C'mon!<eos> Sit down!<eos> Shut up!<eos> So.<eos> We meet again.<eos> I've spent many long hours in the car with your face staring back at me.<eos> I've seen it painted on the horizon.
Excuse me, could one of you sell me two beers?<eos> Sure.<eos> -Here you go.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> -Wait! How much do I owe you?<eos> -The best in life is free.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I'm starting to understand why you don't want to leave.<eos> So, your name...<eos> Melek, does it mean something?
I'm sensing some bad blood here.<eos> - Where is the gold?<eos> - Where's Princess Pei Pei?<eos> Come on. We're men.<eos> We're not pinatas. Okay? And we're really hung over.<eos> We 're not trying to be tough guys.<eos> - You wanna talk about the gold. - So, you have my gold?<eos> - Your gold?<eos> - Yes, we have the gold.<eos> - Then where is it?
What have you found?<eos> Jade Fox?<eos> Impossible!<eos> You'd always suspected she'd fled out west.<eos> She has the nerve to come to Beijing.<eos> Is there any place safer than under the nose of Chief Yu?<eos> I shall avenge my master's death after all.<eos> But be careful, Li Mu Bai.<eos> Sir Te requires discretion.<eos> Official business is already difficult to resolve, it'd be a bigger mess with your personal matters involved.
I can't see.<eos> You'll see better from there.<eos> It was the last time, up there on my father's shoulders, that I had the world of my childhood beneath me.<eos> I could see everyone, everyone I loved and trusted.<eos> I started thinking about the Heavenly Host.<eos> How would they cope now?<eos> They were firing at Heaven with live ammunition.<eos> Did the Heavenly Host have to take cover, just like us?<eos> And what about Jesus with that ring around His head?<eos> Not a good idea to have it lit up just now.
Anything these boys want:<eos> pink champagne, Hennessey,<eos> Exxo, the works. Whatever, yeah?<eos> - Cheers, Sean.<eos> - Mi casa, su casa, Jude.<eos> - A pleasure, mate, lovely. - Yeah, good to see you.<eos> Jonny.<eos> Pink champagne.<eos> That's nice.<eos> It's quite sweeter.
Come and help. Hurry up.<eos> You shouldn't be afraid of the dead.<eos> It's the living you should be wary of.<eos> They're unpredictable.<eos> Who has died?<eos> Listen... People don't die, they pass away or are passed on.<eos> Animals, on the other hand, they die.<eos> And plants wilt.<eos> You don't say that an apple has passed away.<eos> It rots and so on...
tell me again, how did you meet him?<eos> tell me what it was like.<eos> It was exciting. It was like a roIIer-coaster ride.<eos> The world, the night, the lights, everything was fast.<eos> Zip-a-dee-doo-dah. Sounds like falling in love to me.<eos> Sam said something like that. First time we met.<eos> Something about love and time.<eos> -He said your heart....<eos> -...is like a clock measuring time and one's emotional state determines the flow of time.<eos> It speeds it up or slows it down.
what?<eos> who told you that?<eos> It's not true.<eos> Listen, Diego...<eos> If anyone tries to hurt you, I'll cut his balls off.<eos> And I'll burn everything down.<eos> Here, Diego...<eos> I'm taking you to a christening.<eos> Put this ring on.<eos> It was Pepa's.
What? No! What-what-what poem?<eos> You see, when Jack had to retire<eos> – for health reasons...<eos> – That's a bunch of malarky.<eos> I'm fine. The doctor thought it would be therapeutic if he sort of expressed his emotions in an artistic way.<eos> Honey, you wrote the most beautiful poem about your mother.<eos> Please, we really wanna hear it.<eos> – Poem, poem.<eos> – Please! Oh, all right.<eos> It's a work in progress.

She's probably right.<eos> She said you're working on "The Monkeys."<eos> Good.<eos> Getting anywhere?<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> You know why?<eos> Claire.<eos> She saps your confidence.<eos> Remember what she said about your poem?<eos> "It's funny." It came back to me just now.

Yeah, QRT storms the place, finds 16 bodies. Poisoned.<eos> A real Jonestown.<eos> Not like the other one, where the CIA and the military whacked those people.<eos> Komen's taken over as the head honcho of the movement.<eos> So, we talk to him.<eos> You know, I say a Black Nationalist and two whiter shades of pale detectives don't exactly interface, you catch my drift?<eos> You know, if you got a problem with it, Munch, make it easy on yourself.<eos> There's an Amtrak back to the Big Apple every hour.<eos> Stan, you know where the African Revival Movement building is?<eos> If it's in Balto, I can find it.
I don't respect my parents much.<eos> Take a left here.<eos> Is anyone expecting you?<eos> You're a lousy Don Juan.<eos> -Thanks.<eos> -No problem.<eos> JUDITH HERAULT<eos> Nice place.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's far from everything.
where have you been since sunday?<eos> told you, a conference.<eos> -as if i invaded on your privacy.<eos> i never said that -well let me tell you something, you should start thinking about others a little bit.<eos> because for you, life is like that: a straight line and what laurent is feeling, you don't give a shit i have something else to tell you.<eos> i goofed also.<eos> i went to Valincourt, i saw laurent's parents..<eos> told them everything.<eos> fuck, of what right did you do that for?<eos> - the right to happiness, silly isn't it, but it exists.
By which route?<eos> Below in the lake, there's a pipe that goes Sloane Square, under Russia, all the way to Japan!<eos> - Japan...<eos> - As a young man, I swam that pipe, from Komatsu<eos> - Kom... what?<eos> - Komatsu.<eos> Maybe, I'm too old for the journey.<eos> My flesh is old.<eos> But my spirit is young!<eos> The next time... I see the sun... it'll shine over the Caspian Sea, where the sturgeon swim.
Bring it on!<eos> Now let's see who's chicken shit!<eos> All of a sudden, something really strange happened,<eos> I could watch every movement in the alley<eos> I saw everything clearly, like time had stopped<eos> Dude!<eos> Let's go!<eos> To be honest, after that incident,<eos> my outlook on life was different<eos> That life is just like tofu jello, you've got to eat it while it's still hot!
The Air Force ? No !<eos> Nobody wanted an airport here, in Punta Raisi !<eos> Just look above your heads, and you'll understand why:<eos> Because this mountain is too tall, airplanes could crush against it !<eos> The only real aim was to buy your lands with a few grands and then sell them to the airport people making at least a hundred times as much money out of them !<eos> But I'm not talking to them.<eos> They don't even have the guts to show that they're listening.<eos> I'm talking to you.<eos> Yes, to you.<eos> I like your face: it's clean, and you have lively eyes, intelligent.
- Who did you think it was ?<eos> - I thought that maybe...<eos> - What ?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Tell me.<eos> - I've listened to you.<eos> You know, I agree with most of what you said.<eos> But you can't just do it all your way.<eos> You can't just squat in the radio...<eos> It's not yours.
I wouldn't want you to get the wrong idea about me.<eos> I won't.<eos> I read your annual appraisal.<eos> You shouldn't believe all you read.<eos> I'm really quite a fun guy.<eos> A coffee, please.<eos> Milk and sugar?<eos> Just milk.<eos> 'So what was Telford's interest in this place?<eos> 'It had more security than Fort Knox.
So, let's-let's get on it.<eos> All right, I'll look for bomb parts.<eos> I'll shoot the overalls.<eos> Henry and I will document the detonation blast area.<eos> I'll measure, you photo.<eos> So, uh, I know you're applying for the directorship.<eos> Stage doesn't get any bigger than this, Sara.<eos> You want this case?<eos> Good.<eos> It's yours.
When you're weak and confused... you have to keep silent and let the other do the talking.<eos> All that about your other girls made me jealous and weak.<eos> That will drive him crazy... and make him break apart.<eos> Implosion.<eos> Your parents taught you that?<eos> This is piss warm.<eos> Shall I get you a coke?<eos> I'll get you one from the machine.<eos> It's beautiful, the morning in the woods.<eos> It starts when the light reaches a certain level.
But we'll get by all right with the summer kitchen outside.<eos> The sofa with the green blanket will be yours.<eos> In the top part of the cupboard I'll make some space for you.<eos> The windows will have to be done.<eos> There are draughts and it's cold.<eos> I'm sleeping there for the second day now.<eos> And, thank God, out there you can't hear a thing.<eos> Absolute silence.<eos> I've retuned the piano.<eos> Now, once again, it's like any other.
- No it wasn't.<eos> - Well, maybe I meant to.<eos> - Yeah, I think you did.<eos> Are you angry?<eos> No.<eos> - Lucinda?<eos> - What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I can't sell this milk, it's ruined.<eos> it needs to be sterile.
Pablo Escobar.<eos> I don't know him. Is he a soccer player?<eos> You don't know Pablo?<eos> You're putting me on.<eos> Those guys worked for him as hit men.<eos> He got knocked off. Now everyone up in the hills is out of work.<eos> So he was "a good provider for the people."<eos> Poor Pablo.<eos> They don't let anyone get ahead here.<eos> Stop that cab before it kills us.
This painting without a pearl, is of no value.<eos> You can find a pearl easily.<eos> Just a minute...<eos> - When is this mirror from?<eos> - It has no age.<eos> The robbery has no time.<eos> Am I to deduce that it's one of the robber mirrors that they say there are seven of in Portugal?<eos> - Can I see it better?<eos> - Don't do that.<eos> It'll steal everything you have.

I m ust tell you that in the convent you have to have a mirror in the cell and never look at it, in order to fight vanity.<eos> Just then, someone came in to my cell.<eos> It happened to you lots of times.<eos> It's only an illusion.<eos> Concupiscence...<eos> No, my beloved brother, I don't agree.<eos> I look in the mirror and who do I see?<eos> - A woman with her face covered.<eos> - A naked woman...<eos> The body was created by God and so it is beautiful and good.
He was a painter.<eos> His name was Mariani.<eos> I met him a long time ago.<eos> At the time he was a knight in search of adventure...<eos> A Galician of the religion had taken us prisoner.<eos> I just saw the great inquisitor.<eos> I went to paint a portrait.<eos> You could do it in a windowless room so that he looks like me.<eos> I like your face.<eos> It's like mine.
May I?<eos> Of course.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why do I think you're so sweet?<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - Jessica...<eos> A pretty name.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> It's a positive name.
- Then light one up for me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Get inside.<eos> Go on!<eos> Guard!<eos> Guard!<eos> - My medicine.<eos> It's in my purse.
Inside it, there's too much interference for their sensors to detect anything.<eos> -A blind spot.<eos> -Mm-hmm.<eos> How do you propose we reach this wake without being discovered?<eos> I know their scanning frequencies.<eos> We'd only need to mask our signature long enough to get into the wake.<eos> Even if we succeeded-- which is far from certain--<eos> Voyager is in no condition to fight one of their vessels, much less two.<eos> We'll have the element of surprise, Mr. Tuvok, not to mention a Tactical Officer who I'm sure will execute a precision strike.<eos> I've been able to reconfigure the data core, but it's still not capable of supporting our matrices.
- Look.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Well, okay. Um... Wow.<eos> So.<eos> Date's over?<eos> We've been here three hours.<eos> Is that bad?<eos> I only bought one date.<eos> I hate to think that this has been it.<eos> It's almost over.
And so was I.<eos> Do you know what we've become?<eos> Enemies.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Much worse.<eos> Now we're soul mates.<eos> Someone close the shutters.<eos> Seems wrong that I should die while the sun is still so bright.<eos> You'll not see it again.<eos> Before it sets, you will have left this life.
It's 1 p.m. and that's a Sun Valley address.<eos> Right.<eos> - Sun.<eos> - I was thinking Valley.<eos> Why go there if you don't have to?<eos> Darla.<eos> Say that again?<eos> I just....<eos> I said your name, Darla.<eos> Sounds so odd, doesn't it?
- Is that it?<eos> Am I Darla?<eos> Yes.<eos> Careful, Darla would snap you in half.<eos> Is that who I am?<eos> - I know what you're going through.<eos> - No, nobody understands.<eos> Nobody can understand.<eos> I can feel this body dying, Lindsey.<eos> I can feel it decaying every moment.
I told them to.<eos> I wanted my daughter to hear them call you your real name.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> What real name?<eos> I got a call from an anonymous friend with some information.<eos> - This guy isn't Angel.<eos> - I am so Angel!<eos> No, not the sun, for I'm a vampire!<eos> Oh, no, it burns!
Essentially.<eos> Okay, so how do I get someone to eat Eucalipsis powder?<eos> I made brownies.<eos> More Brussels sprouts?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> I'm full.<eos> Everything was...very good.<eos> Roast was a little dry.<eos> No.<eos> It was full of roasty goodness.
These... completely out of bounds - can't touch.<eos> - Just these ones, then?<eos> - These, just these ones.<eos> OK.<eos> Thank God you were here, I'd have said the other way around.<eos> Old wine is good wine.<eos> Yes.<eos> But... expensive wine is good wine also.<eos> Yes.<eos> But the older the wine is, the gooder it is.
- Just these ones, then?<eos> - These, just these ones.<eos> OK.<eos> Thank God you were here, I'd have said the other way around.<eos> Old wine is good wine.<eos> Yes.<eos> But... expensive wine is good wine also.<eos> Yes.<eos> But the older the wine is, the gooder it is.<eos> But by the same token, the more expensive the wine, then the gooder it is also.
- The worst of everything.<eos> A nightmare.<eos> - He created the monster.<eos> So we're saying he did a spell just to make us think he was cool?<eos> Yes.<eos> That is so cool.<eos> Giles, Buffy and Jonathan are going after this nightmare thing.<eos> Are they gonna be OK?<eos> It seems the wellbeing of this creature is linked to Jonathan.<eos> If it dies the spell is broken and Jonathan reverts to... whatever he was before.
Just perfect.<eos> You're home early.<eos> Unfortunately, not early enough.<eos> The haggard girl that you're looking at now is straight from the date from hell.<eos> Something for you and Henry to laugh about on your second date.<eos> Sadly enough, I don't think there's gonna be a second date, Grams.<eos> -Because of just one sour evening?<eos> -This was our first real date and to call it sour would be a kind review.<eos> Jennifer, you have got to get over your preconceptions about what a date is supposed to be.<eos> A date even if it's a bad one, is just another moment.
Yeah, well, it's true.<eos> All right?<eos> I've never had a date on Valentine's Day.<eos> Let alone a first date, so.... l think that my need to fulfil that experience is what got the better of both of us.<eos> That's one way to put it.<eos> If we're gonna continue dating, and I'd like that what do you say we start acting like ourselves and less like a couple in our 30s?<eos> -So you want me to return the ring?<eos> -Not on your life.<eos> This is the best-looking Hungarian-red pinkie ring I've ever gotten.<eos> And besides, it reminds me of you, which makes it pretty invaluable.
You were through with this, I thought we agreed.<eos> I knew a lack of brain activity would allow my temporary presence in human body.<eos> But I did not anticipate that without intellect to control them, the human's animal urges would surge unencumbered through the body.<eos> What of the Commonality?<eos> You yourself said they would never condone this.<eos> I will not limit my actions in accordance to the will of the Synod.<eos> There's more to learn from the experience.<eos> I believe we have much to gain.<eos> I shall proceed.<eos> Pierce's body is already severely damaged. I don't know how much more abuse it can take.
Bebe's just bringing me up to speed on the depressing news about my contract negotiations.<eos> Don't worry, dear.<eos> I just need to find a way to throw a scare into them.<eos> Have you tried turning into a bat?<eos> I would, love, but most grown men don't share your fear of tiny creatures.<eos> Could you two please catch up later?<eos> I did get one offer that I thought might give us some leverage.<eos> It's a TV job.<eos> Television?<eos> Unfortunately, it's all wrong for you.
It's undignified.<eos> Horribly.<eos> Still...<eos> I'm listening.<eos> If there were a way to do it with a bit more dignity, some polish and substance.<eos> Why didn't I think of that?<eos> You know, a dash of high society and a dollop of culture.<eos> I can't believe you're even considering this.<eos> The show is nothing more than a melange of bad jokes and mind-numbing banter.<eos> Yes, but it doesn't have to be, Niles, don't you see?
I am not jealous, Dad.<eos> I am simply appalled by his rudeness.<eos> I was looking forward to this evening.<eos> Nice drink...<eos> lovely opera... then a late supper... perhaps a beautiful bottle of wine, and a delightful...<eos> dessert soufflé...<eos> Oh, God, I need a woman.<eos> Remember my friend Rowena?<eos> She's much prettier since her surgery.<eos> You look at her face, and you can't even tell where it used to be.
What?<eos> No!<eos> No, i-i-<eos> It's kind of embarrassing.<eos> Come on, don't get all mad.<eos> Oh, thanks, sam.<eos> So i guess if you got me a diamond ring And i didn't wear it because i was too embarrassed, You wouldn't get all mad, either?<eos> Hey, come on! i got you a necklace,<eos> And you've never worn it.<eos> It was ugly!
Do you not like all dogs?<eos> I mean, not even puppies?<eos> Is there a puppy here?<eos> - You don't like puppies?<eos> - Okay, you are new.<eos> Look, Chandler, I told you.<eos> Never tell anyone about this dog thing.<eos> It's like Ross not liking ice cream.<eos> - You don't like ice cream?<eos> - It's too cold.
So, yeah, maybe we can get together...<eos> Hold on for one second.<eos> What?<eos> Do you want to get a pizza later?<eos> Hi, I'm back.<eos> Yeah, that sounds great.<eos> We'll do it then.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> When's my audition?<eos> I know it's Thursday, but what time?
God, that is the most beautiful engagement ring ever!<eos> You should know.<eos> You bought, like, a billion of them.<eos> You didn't get one.<eos> -Tonight's the big night.<eos> -How you gonna ask her?<eos> We're gonna go to her favorite restaurant.<eos> I'm gonna get her favorite champagne.<eos> She'll know how expensive it is.
Whatever.<eos> This ring is from the 1920s.<eos> It's a one and a half carat diamond with sapphires.<eos> Sir, could I ask you...?<eos> Could you hold out that ring and ask me to marry you?<eos> -Okay.<eos> -Okay.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, that's it! That's the ring!<eos> -How much is it?
It's the professor!<eos> To the flying machine!<eos> To the left!<eos> No, to the up!<eos> U- turn!<eos> We'll never find this place.<eos> Robots are good at keeping secrets.<eos> No, we're not, you little bed wetter.<eos> Sorry.<eos> There it is!
Wake up!<eos> Hey chumps and chumpettes! Did you get the bomb out?<eos> Can I go back to saying the word I love to say?<eos> I'm sorry, but we couldn't remove it.<eos> It's stuck in there with glue or something, I don't know.<eos> Hey I didn't blow up!<eos> Ass, ass, ass, ass!<eos> Alright!<eos> I'm back in the saddle! We couldn't disarm the bomb so we reset the word that triggers it.<eos> It's from the list of words that you almost never say.
- What?<eos> - You're a vampire!<eos> And I'm going to prove it to everyone!<eos> Lotte, was passiert?<eos> You could never give me boys, Wolf, so I had to provide my own.<eos> - Nein!<eos> - OK, boys.<eos> This is no longer a rehearsal.<eos> Enjoy this performance, Wolf.<eos> It will be your last.
Mayday!<eos> Come in.<eos> Subspace communications are off-line.<eos> It's a tractor beam.<eos> Remodulate our shields.<eos> That should break us free.<eos> Shields are down.<eos> What's happening?<eos> They're using some kind of disruption field.<eos> It's decompiling your matrix.
Captain's Log, Stardate 54238.3.<eos> We've completed our maintenance layover at the Maldorian Station, and we're on our way to rendezvous with the Delta Flyer.<eos> We expect to reach them in 48 hours.<eos> Headache, fever, respiratory distress, tremors.<eos> Looks like some kind of virus.<eos> It is not a virus.<eos> You want to tell me what's going on?<eos> In the Doctor's database, you'll find a medication under file Theta-12-Alpha.<eos> Please replicate it immediately.<eos> You know I can't give out medicine without knowing what it's for.
It is native to my species.<eos> Oh... this wouldn't be the kind of imbalance that comes around once every seven years?<eos> My Pon farr is in the early stages.<eos> The urges are still controllable.<eos> You never fail to amaze me, Tuvok.<eos> A man of your advanced years still driven by the mating instinct?<eos> Unlike in humans, the Vulcan libido increases with time.<eos> Well, I guess there has to be some kind of reward for all that Vulcan discipline.<eos> The Doctor anticipated my needs and developed a treatment.<eos> Combined with meditation, it will enable me to control the symptoms.
Pulse-phased weapons, duranium-enforced hull.<eos> Hmm. Much more sophisticated than the typical smuggler's vessel.<eos> How many ways do you want me to say this?<eos> We are not smugglers or terrorists.<eos> We are explorers.<eos> Let us contact our ship.<eos> Our Captain will explain everything.<eos> If you're innocent, then you won't mind telling me more about this vessel.<eos> For instance, um... this device.<eos> What does it do?
Your sarcasm could be viewed as subterfuge.<eos> Tuvok, it's me, Harry.<eos> Do you really think I'd be capable of this?<eos> My personal views are irrelevant.<eos> I learned about Max's death a long time ago.<eos> I was upset, but I don't blame the Maquis, and I certainly don't blame anyone on this ship.<eos> If that'll be all?<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> This investigation is... perplexing.<eos> It defies logic.
Paynan?<eos> Laira!<eos> - It is all right.<eos> - One struck Talmar's home.<eos> Three families were inside.<eos> We are all that are left.<eos> Why did you stay?<eos> On the third day we could take no more.<eos> We fled to the stone ring...<eos> Where it used to be.
Zipacna was one of Apophis's most loyal underlords.<eos> I don't believe for a second he's come to talk Klorel outta here.<eos> - They are ready for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Carter, you and Teal'c keep an eye on Zippy's kids.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - See what they're up to.<eos> This dispute involves two sentient beings who inhabit the same body.<eos> Both have requested sole use of the body, therefore we must establish right of priority over the body.<eos> To whom does it belong?
Daniel, no!<eos> - Five minutes, sir.<eos> - Lotan took Daniel back onto the ship.<eos> - What?<eos> ! Sir...<eos> - He asked to go.<eos> Well, what are we gonna do, sir?<eos> The ship is almost in position.<eos> The ship has detected an unusual device.<eos> It appears to be capable of emitting great amounts of energy.
Are you really fulfilling your true function by allowing this to happen?<eos> 60 seconds to detonation.<eos> The ship has stopped, O'Neill.<eos> The ship has stopped.<eos> Daniel must've gotten through to him.<eos> Daniel, if you can hear me, you've got 30 seconds.<eos> Three zero.<eos> Over.<eos> Um, about that device...<eos> - It is still active.
It isn't safe.<eos> - Enemy bombers over the city.<eos> - Teal'c, target the lead bomber.<eos> - I'll take the other one.<eos> - I have it, O'Neill.<eos> - That sounded close.<eos> - Directly above us, in the old city.<eos> Let me show you another of the wonders we will share with you for all you've done.<eos> The field generator can repel the force of many bombs like a great shield.<eos> It has saved our people from destruction for my entire life.
Well, what you call an error has somehow resulted in life.<eos> He's self-aware, he thinks independently, he's afraid of his own death.<eos> By any definition, he's acting alive.<eos> All we're saying is that maybe there's a way of doing this without... killing him.<eos> - There is not!<eos> - OK. Had to ask.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why not?<eos> The unit must be in a life form.<eos> It cannot exist on its own.
She died. 12 years ago.<eos> When I found this place and discovered its purpose, I dedicated myself to unlocking its mysteries.<eos> So you could go back and save her.<eos> No, that would be quite impossible.<eos> She died from a congenital heart weakness.<eos> Not even the ability to travel time could change that.<eos> Then why are you doing this?<eos> To be with her once more.<eos> Malikai, the device doesn't work.<eos> - It never did.
No, I mean.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, and no.<eos> I don't know.<eos> So... our first date's almost over.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> It was no worse than bowling.
Unnecessarily angry.<eos> Well... you know, what does "unnecessarily" mean really?<eos> I mean, my sister likes to put salt on roast beef... but I think it's unnecessary.<eos> I mean, why cover up the flavor of such a delicious meat?<eos> Just answer the question, dumb-ass!<eos> I mean... Good work, Son.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I love champagne!<eos> Yes.<eos> Was it any good?
They are righteous.<eos> And they are patriots.<eos> And I'm their lawyer.<eos> You ever read Paul Ehrlich's book?<eos> - The Population Bomb?<eos> - Yeah. He wrote it in 1968.<eos> Ehrlich said that it was a fantasy that India would ever feed itself.<eos> Then Norman Borlaug comes along.<eos> The problem was that wheat is top-heavy.<eos> It was falling over on itself and it took up too much space.
I'll be back for a briefing in an hour and a half.<eos> Hopefully we'll know more then.<eos> -Cabinet's meeting in five minutes.<eos> -What did that mean:<eos> -"You can't seem to give us answers"?<eos> -You scratched your neck.<eos> -What?<eos> -The side of your neck.<eos> I lost my necklace.<eos> It must've come off when....
- Thank you.<eos> Toby said to come by as soon as you got back.<eos> I'm not taking any calls.<eos> I'll call them back.<eos> "The reality of the Bartlet White House is a flood of mistakes.<eos> An agenda stalled and lacking a coherent strategy.<eos> An administration plagued by indecision. "<eos> - Ginger.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Mandy wrote a manual for Russell, and it's out.
- No.<eos> - It says, an eye for an eye.<eos> You know what it also says?<eos> It says a rebellious child can be stoned to death.<eos> It says homosexuality is an abomination, punishable by death.<eos> It says men can be polygamous and slavery is acceptable.<eos> For all I know, that thinking reflected the best wisdom of its time.<eos> But it's just plain wrong by any modern standard.<eos> Society has a right to protect itself, but not to be vengeful.<eos> It has a right to punish, but it doesn't have a right to kill.
Put him in an office, dry him out, and explain why he can't see the president.<eos> -T ry to avoid the Situation Room.<eos> -Good safety tip.<eos> -What?<eos> -I'm taking Ainsley to the Hill with me.<eos> -Good.<eos> -She wants me to teach her some things.<eos> -She called me the master.<eos> -Get out.<eos> Yeah, the risotto, but I'd like it cooked with chicken broth instead of oil.
It passed the House with 342 votes.<eos> Our numbers are the same as yours.<eos> Sixty percent of Americans oppose legally sanctioned gay marriage.<eos> The people want the bill, Congress wants the bill the president needs to sign the bill.<eos> Public opinion can be wrong.<eos> The public opposed interracial marriage and school integration.<eos> You want me to reach back into the nostalgia file?<eos> -That's different.<eos> -How?<eos> The government has a responsibility to protect the rights of minorities but it can't impose the minority's values on the majority.
Order pasta.<eos> Nothing like a meeting you gotta carb up for.<eos> - You should be at town hall prep.<eos> - I'm going.<eos> They started 10 minutes ago.<eos> - Where's my chair?<eos> - Let's go. - Where's my chair?<eos> - What chair?<eos> - The chair I sit in.<eos> - It's at the shop.
- You publish The Lone Gunman newspaper?<eos> - Our reputation precedes us.<eos> Yeah. I read Mulder's files.<eos> Then you know how badly you'll need our help.<eos> We reviewed your case, as Agent Scully asked. Mondo bizzarro.<eos> No offense, man, but you're in way over your head.<eos> What help can you give me?<eos> Hit the lights.<eos> Are you familiar with this image?<eos> In the Renaissance it represented an all-seeing god.
That's why he tried to kill himself - to make it stop.<eos> Excellentjob, gentlemen.<eos> Have your reports on my desk 0900.<eos> Case isn't over yet, sir.<eos> AD Skinner says our suspect's lyin' hospitalized in a coma.<eos> Now you're sayin' it's not over?<eos> We have no murder weapon, no forensic evidence.<eos> Unless we accept Tipet's own beliefs, which you say are preposterous... lt's over.<eos> - We've no way of explaining how he killed...<eos> - l said it's over, Agent Doggett.
I am at the point of joy.<eos> The point of death is the point of joy.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I died a long time ago, but I still remember the experience.<eos> So?<eos> I also remember the experience of sexual climax from the time when I was alive.<eos> Oh well, that's very nice. I'm very happy for ya.<eos> And - there is a certain similarity between the two events.<eos> Between getting your jollies and getting killed?<eos> Yes. The quality of release was somewhat the same, only, with death it was far greater.
Kai?<eos> I want you.<eos> I thought the dead didn't -<eos> Get aroused?<eos> You're right Xev. My actions - do not make sense.<eos> What about the key?<eos> I want you - right now.<eos> Let me finish with Stanley first. Then I'll catch up with you.<eos> The electricity goes straight to your brain!<eos> It will shock you to the edge. And I will be the fire who takes you over it.
Am I sure?<eos> Only as sure as I am... ... thattherealityofonenight ... ... letalonethatofa wholelifetime...<eos> And no dream is ever... ... justa dream.<eos> The important thing is... ... we'reawakenow ... ... andhopefully...<eos> Forever.<eos> Forever?<eos> Forever.<eos> Let's not use that word.<eos> You know?<eos> It frightens me.
It was more of a cafe.<eos> You sit here.<eos> And don't move.<eos> If you move, the radio won't work.<eos> I'll turn it on, and we both are going to listen to it.<eos> But if I see you get up, the radio goes right off.<eos> Now I turn it on.<eos> It takes a moment for the tubes to heat up.<eos> Once they are warmed up, you'll hear talking.<eos> So it's heating up now.
What do you think, Curly?<eos> Whatelsedo youhave,Homer?<eos> - Do you have something else for me?<eos> - Oh, that's my heart.<eos> - No, actually, it's Fuzzy's.<eos> There's nothing wrong with your heart.<eos> Dr. Larch wanted to keep you out of the war.<eos> That's why he told you it was yours.<eos> I think he was worried about his own heart.<eos> He said it would never stand up to Homer Wells going off to war.
Yes. It's very shocking, I dare say, but, well, there it is.<eos> Do you know, I don't think loving one's mother comes quite by nature.<eos> I loved my father, but he died when I was quite a little thing, and nobody believes I remember him, but I do.<eos> So you see, I can't forgive Mama for her neglect of me when I would have clung to her.<eos> I know she had to go out and work as a governess, but if she wanted me to love her, she shouldn't have sent me away to school at four years old.<eos> - Did Mama say Mrs Hamley had two sons?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Osborne and Roger.<eos> They have been so kind to me, Roger especially. - He has such a good heart.<eos> - Perhaps it belongs to you.
That ring is superb.<eos> Oh, Tom, I love you.<eos> See?<eos> Ooh!<eos> I had to promise, capital "P," never to take it off.<eos> - Otherwise, I'd give it to you.<eos> - Isn't it great?<eos> I found it in Naples.<eos> I had to bargain for it for about two weeks.<eos> I hope it wasn't cheap, Marge.
It isn't all gone.<eos> I didn't bet everything.<eos> Here. We still got twenty.<eos> - But the car costs forty.<eos> You need forty?<eos> No problem.<eos> Why you not tell me?<eos> I take care of my friends.<eos> My grandpa's name was Horst.<eos> The more I hear that name, the more stupid it sounds.
Early seventies?<eos> His name was Hannon Fuller.<eos> Hannon Fuller.<eos> 1870.<eos> No, I can't say I've ever heard of Hannon Fuller, 1870, microchips.<eos> But I'm not much of a technical person, you know.<eos> You been here before?<eos> You look kind of familiar.<eos> Name's Douglas Hall.<eos> It doesn't ring a bell.
About the direction of research here, we may have had our differences, but--<eos> Research.<eos> You declare as a badge of honor you don't even know what makes water boil.<eos> Well, that's why we hire scientists.<eos> [ Scoffs ] Okay.<eos> I don't believe that you can maintain corporate integrity... without confidentiality agreements.<eos> I was paid well for my work, the health and welfare benefits are good, the severance package is fair.<eos> I have no intention of violating my confidentiality agreement... and disclosing that which I said I wouldn't.<eos> I appreciate all that, Jeff, but upon reflection, we've decided to expand our zone of comfort with you, so we've drafted a supplement to your agreement.<eos> It broadly defines and expands in more detail... what is confidential.
I am.<eos> I am.<eos> I hate my father.<eos> I don't want it to be like that.<eos> I don't wanna control you.<eos> You even like your name?<eos> I guess.<eos> You guess?<eos> Shouldn't you like your name?<eos> It'll be your name the rest of your life.
"Search not, for He is among us."<eos> So they drill a hole through your shinbone.<eos> Right here.<eos> About this size.<eos> And it goes straight through the bone.
I feel like I see things lighter lately.<eos> And I'm quite happy I met you.<eos> -Good.<eos> And that I can be with you.<eos> -That's beautiful.<eos> Those are beautiful words.<eos> Oh, yes, your attention please for this little book.<eos> You probably all read The Celestine Prophecy by James Redfield.<eos> A sequel now has been published, called: The Palestine Prophecy.<eos> It explains why the Messiah will return in 2000, as a Palestinian.
And the one who came home at night with the smell of whiskey on him.<eos> But he was reading all the time he was at the hospital.<eos> I'm sorry, Mrs. McCourt. He's missed over two months of school.<eos> He'll have to go back to the fifth class. I'm really very sorry.<eos> Mom, I don't want to go back to fifth class.<eos> Malachy's in fifth class, and I'm a year older than him.<eos> Oh, come on, Frankie.<eos> But all me friends will laugh at me because I've been put back.<eos> No.<eos> What I needed was a miracle, and it happened right there outside the Our Lady Of Liberty Pub.
How does this sound? "Dear Mrs. O'Brien:<eos> In as much as you have not seen fit to pay me what you owe me, I may be forced to resort to legal action.<eos> There's your son, Michael, parading around the world in his new suit, which I paid for, while I myself have barely a crust to keep body and soul together."<eos> "I am sure you don't want to languish in the dungeons of Limerick jail, far from friends and family.<eos> I remain yours in lit- lit-"<eos> - What are these words, boy?<eos> - Litigious anticipation.<eos> That's a powerful letter.<eos> This word, "in as much."<eos> That's a holy terror of a word. What does it mean?
I'm on the side of Holy Mother Church.<eos> You have a sword?<eos> Quite a few.<eos> Didn't you also carry a banner?<eos> Yes.<eos> Which do you prefer?<eos> Your banner or your sword?<eos> I was 40 times more fond of my banner.<eos> Why?<eos> Did it have some particular value or power?
Goodness me!<eos> Pomerol?<eos> -It's too much, Madam Mercier.<eos> -It's ok.<eos> Just before his death, my husband just ordered 120 bottles.<eos> 120 bottles!<eos> And since I don't drink...<eos> Drink slowly, Riton.<eos> A good wine must be savoured.<eos> If it was not that good, I would not drink it so fast.
You can't steal a tent.<eos> I said no more boxes.<eos> I feel like I'm on some strange planet.<eos> This is how I feel.<eos> Everything's spinning.<eos> Wrapped in cotton.<eos> The melon knows not the cold wind of morning.<eos> Was it the blossom, the fruit, that fell in the dew from summer trees?<eos> Alone on the ice a cheerful cormorant.<eos> Desperation is bad. It robs your dignity.
Just like Mother used to make.<eos> So, tell me, Mathesar, this Sarris person that we're flying to meet, what does he want?<eos> He heard about the device, the Omega 13.<eos> What is it?<eos> What does it do?<eos> We don't know.<eos> We were hoping you could enlighten us.<eos> The Omega 13 device.<eos> We found that on an alien planet.<eos> We don't know what it does either.

And hurry.<eos> I'm sorry. It's very exciting to watch the master at the controls.<eos> The operation of the conveyor is much more art than science.<eos> Stand back, Jason.<eos> What?<eos> What was that?<eos> - Nothing. - I hear some squealing or something.<eos> - Oh, no. Everything's fine.<eos> - But the animal is inside out.<eos> It turned inside out?
Wait a minute! No! I want you to jump, Commander, jump!<eos> Whoever wrote this episode should die!<eos> This should be interesting.<eos> It's the simple things in life you treasure.<eos> That's great.<eos> Now, we better get...<eos> Hey, get a room, guys, okay?<eos> Hey, Fred.<eos> That's not right.<eos> Sir, the pressure, it's normalizing.
Hey, Hamish and I don't have secrets.<eos> Surprise him.<eos> Yeah. Why would he believe I've written a book?<eos> 'Cause you're smart, Rube.<eos> Come on.<eos> I promise not to ask anything else of you, ever.<eos> OK.<eos> You promise?<eos> Cross your heart.<eos> It's on the other side, Jack.
That's permanent horseshit patrol.<eos> This place is a cesspool.<eos> But listen.<eos> I'm not from West Covina.<eos> I'm from internal Affairs.<eos> Oh, man!<eos> All right?<eos> This place is a cesspool.<eos> -I can't believe I didn't notice!<eos> I mean, it doesn't seem like a cesspool.
How are you?<eos> - How's the dress?<eos> - Fine. Fine.<eos> Both of us.<eos> Can I...<eos> Could I see it... on you?<eos> - Check the fitting.<eos> - Don't be mad, Sam.<eos> You'll get me lynched.<eos> It fits perfect.
It's a wider community, more wide than you'd think.<eos> Yes.<eos> And, erm...<eos> I grew up in Europe, where the history comes from.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You tear your history down, man.<eos> "It's 30 years old, let's smash it and put a car park here."<eos> I have seen it in stories.<eos> I saw a program on something in Miami.<eos> "We've redecorated this building to how it looked over 50 years ago."
I mean, you're never going to get this message... but I just... wanted to let you know that I'm alive.<eos> Oh, hold still! ...hold still!<eos> Technically I don't know how I got here, but I'm not going to stop trying to get home.<eos> See? You're fixed!<eos> Go play!<eos> Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Your equipment may be worth something in trade.<eos> My equipment...<eos> It's mine!
It's on top.<eos> There it is again. Attitude.<eos> Positive thinking-- I know it sounds like crap, but it works for me.<eos> - You're a cheater.<eos> - You're my friend.<eos> I don't do to hurt you, I do it to show you a lesson, to help you learn, buddy.<eos> Come on, Chris.<eos> Why don't you take this dress?<eos> What you want me to do with it?<eos> - It belonged to your mom.
Just listen.<eos> Grandmama, listen.<eos> Just listen.<eos> There was this shoot out.<eos> Dirty Harry has this bad guy cornered.<eos> I mean, he was a real bad guy, and there's this tremendous shoot out.<eos> They're really exchanging lots of fire.<eos> They're shooting bullets at each other and they keep missing.<eos> At the end the bad guy somehow drops his gun.<eos> It's just down there on the bottom.
It's probably the only one.<eos> That's what the director said.<eos> Do you understand magnificence?<eos> No.<eos> Someone larger than life.<eos> Someone on a different scale.<eos> The director was like that.<eos> He died three years ago.<eos> I've been taking care of the tree ever since.<eos> But, I wonder why... it just seems to get weaker and weaker.
I've been taking care of the tree ever since.<eos> But, I wonder why... it just seems to get weaker and weaker.<eos> I treat it the same way.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I don't know much about plants either.<eos> Right.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can touch it.<eos> You sure?<eos> It'll live for thousands of years.
I feel I should do something.<eos> What something?<eos> Kiriyama told me that tree will live for thousands of years.<eos> Someone's got to protect it.<eos> Everyone's got it wrong.<eos> You, too.<eos> The director brought that tree over from the continent.<eos> It's an unusual species.<eos> What type is it?<eos> It's a kind of monster.
What?<eos> This isn't what you think it is.<eos> I see.<eos> Unfortunately, it's just another tree.<eos> Then what are you going to do?<eos> What do you mean do?<eos> Will you keep it alive or will you kill it?<eos> Whatever.<eos> This tree has no impact on the forest as a whole.<eos> What is it, then?

I'm still kinda shocked. I mean, you're.. you're really normal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My last couple of dates have been horrible.<eos> Oh, you get fixed up on a lot of blind dates?<eos> Only recently.<eos> - H-How 'bout you?<eos> - This is my first.<eos> - I hope this place is okay.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> It's terrific.
But Farrakhan don't like the Jews, which is bugged.<eos> I get my hair cut on Dekalb Avenue. I never been in a barbershop... and heard a bunch of brothers talking about Jews.<eos> Black people don't hate Jews.<eos> Black people hate white people!<eos> We don't got time to dice white people up into little groups.<eos> "l hate everybody!<eos> I don't care if you just got here."<eos> -"Hey, I'm Romanian." -"You Romanian cracker!"<eos> We need a fucking leader, man.<eos> When we got no leaders, when something happens... we make the shit bigger than it is.

The great Abram Šafar from Polana.<eos> People said that he would one day give his three granddaughters a wedding to remember. The grandest that ever was.<eos> "Their children's children are the crown of the elders", Pinches Jakuboviè, the Polana tailor, would tell us.<eos> He sewed little, but read much in the learned books of the Cabbala.<eos> Few could equal him in matters of faith.<eos> Grandfather owned half the land and fertile herds in Polana.<eos> We had a large house, a shop and a tavern full of customers.<eos> The silver menorahs inherited from our ancestors added to the splendour of our Sabbaths, full of pious song, light and trust.<eos> The years ran by like stags in the meadows and our property melted away.<eos> It slipped between our fingers and no-one knows how it all began.
Forgive me.<eos> Please, don't be angry with me.<eos> Don't be angry with me.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> No, Šlojme!<eos> I'll find you!<eos> Even if I have to go on foot.<eos> The last Sabbath at home.<eos> Dad smelled the spices so that he wouldn't forget the fragrance of the Promised Land.<eos> Then he dabbed spirit on his brow so that it would remain clear, on his heart, so that it would be good, and neck, so it would be sturdy.
I'll give you my Saint Anargyros.<eos> Anyone else?<eos> McDonnell Douglas DC8.<eos> I'll let you have Mary Magdalene.<eos> -Will you give me the ring?<eos> -No.<eos> But you promised...<eos> It's been years since we took it.<eos> I did!<eos> You'll get it when you grow up and it fits.

The little guy likes to dance.<eos> He just ate.<eos> You'll make him sick!<eos> John, the clerk's office called you back in for closing statements.<eos> Now?<eos> Well, she wants to rule by the end of the day.<eos> We're not out to get Elaine Vassal.<eos> Our intent here is to ensure the welfare of this baby, and we have concerns here.<eos> The decision to raise a child -- it's enormous.<eos> It's not something that happens when you find one like a lost kitten.
You think you got it bad.<eos> Ling has been having gay erotic dreams.<eos> -I beg you pardon?<eos> -Yes.<eos> What do you think that means?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But one thing seems certain: you and I, in bed, we're not pleasing our women<eos> So ... that was an excellent dinner, scrumptious, really good.<eos> H-how was your, um ... meat?<eos> Oh, it was great.
You flushed them?<eos> Down the toilet?<eos> I can make it on my own.<eos> I know I can.<eos> Yes, and I'm happy for you.<eos> But to waste perfectly good Prozac!<eos> I ought to put you on Xanax just for that!<eos> Oh, look!<eos> I couldn't kill Al Green, even if he's only imaginary in my head.<eos> Yeah, and you can't face down your little dementia because it comes in gospel form!
Jesus was maybe a little off the mark.<eos> Jesus was off the mark?<eos> Under that theory, every man would be an adulterer.<eos> It's the deed. "Thou shalt not commit adultery. "<eos> That's what the commandment says.<eos> You didn't.<eos> - A thought is not the same as a deed.<eos> - What was all that about coveting?<eos> Coveting is a dumb one.<eos> I don't know why it's there.
I want maternity dresses, I want my legs in stirrups spit the little thing out and have him suck on my breast.<eos> Daddy right there the whole time with a camcorder.<eos> That's what I want.<eos> Instead of waiting for it, I'll make it happen.<eos> Can you deal with that?<eos> Georgia, what are you doing?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - This dress.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's new.
You said he could.<eos> The moment is over.<eos> Move on.<eos> - Mr. Mannix, what happened?<eos> - I got out of my car, you see both the piano and the Porsche were antiques.<eos> They were my dearest things in life.<eos> She knew it.<eos> I pleaded, but she had this maniacal look.<eos> Then she released the piano.<eos> It crushed the car.
They're fondling and kissing.<eos> My friend told me this had been going on for a while.<eos> She didn't want to interfere, but to be in a public place was too much.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> - I called another friend who works in construction.<eos> He brought his crane and some men.<eos> We hoisted the piano.<eos> When he came home, I dropped it on his Porsche.<eos> You admit it. You did this intentionally.<eos> No. I was just swinging a piano in the sky and it fell.
Bygones.<eos> It's time. Sooner or later, you have to grow up even emotionally.<eos> It's time.<eos> - You what?<eos> - So I'm hopeless!<eos> - You wanted Greg, now you want Kevin?<eos> - Don't make fun of the ill.<eos> I am making progress.<eos> I am opening up my heart, at least.<eos> Yeah, and it's working like an esophagus.
The guys, they...<eos> They're... Some ofyour patrons are turning into cavemen.<eos> They had it coming.<eos> I've been taking abuse from snot-nosed kids for 20 years.<eos> They're always in here with their snotty attitudes, drinking their fruity microbrews, spouting some philosophy like it means a damn thing.<eos> - Thinking they're different than us.<eos> - They are now.<eos> They ain't.<eos> That's the great thing about beer.<eos> It makes all men the same.
How much beer does a person need to consume before they start questing for fire?<eos> Relax.<eos> It'll wear off in a day or so.<eos> In a day or so someone can get killed.<eos> You're a bad, bad man.<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> Is he OK?<eos> - I cut her off. She didn't drink as much.<eos> - I can't believe you served Buffy that beer.<eos> - I didn't know it was evil.
Not good.<eos> I'm changing.<eos> But you can't.<eos> There's no moon tonight.<eos> I have to get away.<eos> No.<eos> We need to find something to restrain you, like a rope or chains or something.<eos> There's no time.<eos> I can do the guiding spell.<eos> I know I can make it work.
One of us is very confused, and I honestly don't know which.<eos> - This happens to be all your fault.<eos> - My fault?<eos> You were unfaithful to Cordelia, so I posed as a 12th-grader to tempt her with the wish.<eos> When I lost my powers, I got stuck in this persona and now I have all these "feelings".<eos> I don't understand it.<eos> But I wanna go to this dance and I want someone to go with me.<eos> Be still my heart.<eos> Wait.<eos> It is.
- You think I haven't thought about this?<eos> - Have you?<eos> Rationally?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I'm just some swoony little schoolgirl, right?<eos> I'm trying to do what's right.<eos> I'm trying to think with my head instead of my heart.<eos> Heart?<eos> You have a heart?<eos> It isn't even beating.
I need your help.<eos> It's the last favour I'll ever ask, I promise.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Please.<eos> The curse.<eos> What?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Phoebe, what is he doing here?<eos> - Save it till later.<eos> I have seen the future, and it's not bright.
- What happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I came here to meet him and found him there.<eos> - How did he die? - Coroner hasn't said, but it's definitely a homicide.<eos> Although, there's no mutilation, no other visible wounds.<eos> Doesn't fit our MO.<eos> I suppose it could be random.<eos> Chases off a crazed killer last night, then succumbs to a mugging today?<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> Maybe the creature, or whatever it is, found out Billy had some information on it.
It might not have been whoever attacked you.<eos> - Who else could it have been?<eos> - Sorry, had to make a call.<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - No, I don't feel so well.<eos> Maybe we should come back later.<eos> Just a few questions, if you don't mind.<eos> We were wondering if you knew what exactly Billy was coming to tell me.<eos> Just that the creature is called a Wendigo.<eos> And that it attacks during the full moon.

Besides, this guy's totally legit.<eos> He e-mailed me a picture.<eos> A picture.<eos> Oh, for God's sake, Roz, what can you learn from a picture?<eos> The man's probably a lunatic, a psychopath...<eos> Oh, he's a pretty boy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I know this photo.<eos> It's the cover of this month's Bidwell's catalog.
Oh, there's no pen.<eos> I'm sorry, Noel.<eos> No problemo.<eos> I wear one around my neck.<eos> - Oh, damn.<eos> - What is it?<eos> It looks like I have some competition for this luncheon.<eos> An Alistair Mowbray doubled my bid to $500.<eos> I've heard that name before.<eos> Yes, you know, it sounds familiar to me too.
That's actually the new postage stamp in England.<eos> Her Majesty with a pair of barbecue tongs and a sauce brush.<eos> Yes, well, at least Dad didn't have to go into debt for his purchase.<eos> Oh, yes. Roz told me about your lunch with the geniuses.<eos> - What?<eos> Roz beat us back here?<eos> - Yeah, she was trying to ditch Noel.<eos> Apparently, he's not allowed onto the highway with his moped.<eos> Frasier, do you ever wonder why we do all this competition?<eos> Where did it even start?
Daphne.<eos> - Morning, Dad.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Yes?<eos> Daphne, please, Donny's not here.<eos> Will you just take your hand out of the bag?<eos> I was just undressing to take my bath, and I sat on the edge of the tub and landed on this.<eos> Oh, my God, you found my ring.<eos> I'd given up.<eos> I thought it was some place I'd never find it.
- No, rinse off this doodle dust first.<eos> - Oh, right, of course.<eos> - All right, yeah.<eos> Well, you sure saved Daphne there.<eos> Yes, I also did myself a little favour as well.<eos> Can you imagine what conclusions Faye might have jumped to had she found this engagement ring in my room?<eos> - Frasier, for me?<eos> I had no idea.<eos> - Well, actually...<eos> It's beautiful.
Oh, who's that?<eos> Who's that?<eos> Let's go see... let's go see who it is.<eos> Hey. Oh!<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Is this Roz Doyle's apartment?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You her date?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Listen up. You go out with Roz tonight, I will rip off your arm, ram it down your throat, and use it to squeeze your heart until it stops beating.
I'm all ears.<eos> So was she.<eos> Anyway, I've spoken to the accounting department about your bill, and it was clearly our mistake.<eos> Please accept my apology.<eos> We'll take care of it. Oh. I-I appreciate that.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Thank you. Oh... Ooh, I like that print very much.<eos> Hmm? Everything all right?<eos> I'm sorry. I just noticed a smudge on my jacket.<eos> Well, it's barely noticeable.
Daphne told us you encouraged her to follow her vision and to dump Donny.<eos> I'm astonished at your lack of integrity.<eos> Now, will you take that damn thing off?<eos> What did you hope to accomplish with that?<eos> I was simply trying to nudge Daphne into the realisation that I am the man in her vision.<eos> Niles.<eos> All right.<eos> But why else would she come to me?<eos> Surely, you of all people realise that there is some psychological basis for these visions of hers.<eos> It represents a fear of some kind.
Why don't you just calm down?<eos> Get all your facts before you tell everybody you're the only hot couple.<eos> God, I woke the beast.<eos> I was wrong, obviously.<eos> I just misspoke.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It is okay.<eos> As long as you know Chandler and I are also hot and fiery.<eos> Just as hot as you.<eos> I mean, our flame... It is on fire!
Over here, you got a picture of a watering can.<eos> I just thought..<eos> I'm sure it's a famous watering can.<eos> But come on.<eos> And what is with the really hot stick in the bathroom?<eos> It's a curling iron.<eos> Well, that's okay then.<eos> Okay, my towels, for instance.<eos> I come into the bathroom... and my towel is not on the floor, where I keep it.<eos> It's up here on some hook.

Comedy's a dead art form.<eos> Now, tragedy?<eos> That's funny.<eos> Come on, everyone.<eos> Perhaps skiing will help us forget the moldy old antics of Conan O'Brien.<eos> - Great idea!<eos> - We can only hope.<eos> This snow is beautiful.<eos> I'm glad global warming never happened.<eos> Actually, it did.
I have to get married or move.<eos> - Lovely!<eos> Can I use that in my poem?<eos> - lt's yours.<eos> - Wait till you see my bridesmaid's dress.<eos> - ls it hideous?<eos> No, we got to pick our own.<eos> It's this amazing, backless, black satin.<eos> - Pretty sexy for a bridesmaid.<eos> - Madeline just said it had to be black.
- (Shooting and moaning) - Brought your mop back.<eos> - (Moaning) - What are you playing?<eos> It's a subtle blend of lateral thinking and extreme violence.<eos> What, like It's A Knockout?<eos> Did you want something?<eos> No.<eos> Not really.<eos> Oh, there's a letter here for you.<eos> Came yesterday.<eos> It's open.
This is no time for a changeling pride demonstration on the Promenade.<eos> - Constable.<eos> - I need time alone with the prisoner.<eos> Sorry, sir.<eos> I have my orders.<eos> - I don't know what to say.<eos> - You could say you were wrong.<eos> You could say the people here are no different than any other humanoids.<eos> This will all get straightened out at your hearing.<eos> I'm sure it will be fair and impartial.
This night would be better spent preparing ourselves for the next life instead of rehashing the mistakes of this one.<eos> You are right.<eos> What?<eos> I said you are right.<eos> I do not love you as I loved Jadzia.<eos> There's no crime in that.<eos> I dishonoured myself.<eos> I know how often I use that word.<eos> Maybe too often.<eos> - But in this case, it is appropriate.
- Surrender yourself or die.<eos> - I choose neither.<eos> Get back!<eos> It's Damar!<eos> It's Damar!<eos> He's alive!<eos> Citizens of Cardassia, hear me!<eos> The Dominion told you that the Rebellion has been crushed.<eos> What you have seen here today proves that that is another lie.<eos> Our fight for freedom continues, but it will take place here, in the streets.
No, he doesn't.<eos> Which is why we need to send him someone who does.<eos> You want me to go behind enemy lines to teach Cardassians how to be resistance fighters?<eos> I'm aware of the irony. The tactics you used to drive the Cardassians off Bajor are exactly what this situation calls for.<eos> But to work with Damar?<eos> When he killed Ziyal, he murdered an innocent girl.<eos> You'll have to put your personal feelings aside.<eos> Whether you like Damar or not is irrelevant.<eos> We need him.<eos> The Dominion knows they have to stop his rebellion before it spreads.
What does it want?<eos> You... your ship... antimatter, biomatter.<eos> He consumes it.<eos> Everyone believed it was a wormhole.<eos> Hmm, telepathy... psychogenic manipulation.<eos> He senses your thoughts, your desires, and then he preys on them.<eos> Like a pitcher plant.<eos> Pitcher plant?<eos> The Doctor taught me about it in botany class.<eos> It catches insects by mimicking pheromones.
We'll have to send somebody down there to seal off the tanks manually.<eos> - Contact the theta core.<eos> - Communications are down.<eos> Get down to the injector pod and seal those tanks.<eos> - I didn't sign up for core labour.<eos> - I'm giving you an order.<eos> - I'll be contaminated.<eos> - Now!<eos> The flame, like emotion, is a primitive force.<eos> Left unchecked, it's chaotic, destructive, but if controlled it can be a powerful tool.
There are minute traces scattered across the northern continent.<eos> Isolate.<eos> An impact crater.<eos> It spans a radius of 200 kilometers.<eos> And look at this.<eos> Heavy concentrations of radiogenic decay in the crater walls... and the fracture gradients are consistent... with a highly focused explosion.<eos> Evidently we've discovered its function.<eos> A weapon of mass destruction.<eos> I understand your concerns, but the device hasn't shown itself to be hostile.<eos> Not yet, but it's only a matter of time before it puts the pieces together.
I understand your concerns, but the device hasn't shown itself to be hostile.<eos> Not yet, but it's only a matter of time before it puts the pieces together.<eos> All the more reason we should talk to it;<eos> explain our concerns.<eos> Ask for help in defusing its explosive components.<eos> If it's programmed to detonate, there's no telling how it'll react.<eos> Agreed.<eos> We have to neutralize the threat, now.<eos> Suggestions?<eos> Transport the device off the ship and destroy it before it harms anyone.
That means getting you into Sick Bay without arousing suspicion.<eos> We could access the holo-matrix controls above Sick Bay, disrupt the Doctor's program long enough for Seven to inject the nanoprobes.<eos> How much time would you need?<eos> Approximately 20 seconds.<eos> Run a long-range scan on that subspace minefield it warned us about.<eos> Calculate their explosive yield... what kind of damage they might to do the ship.<eos> Aye, Captain.<eos> What have you got in mind?<eos> I have a feeling we're about to run into some unexpected trouble.<eos> We've analyzed the alien minefield and calculated the effect it would have on Voyager.

Isolate that area and digitally enhance.<eos> - What am I looking at?<eos> - That's a black hole, sir.<eos> A newly formed one, by the looks of it.<eos> P3W-451 was orbiting its companion star.<eos> The orbit's probably pulling them closer.<eos> Why don't they just gate out of there?<eos> They're trying to, but the closer you get to a black hole...<eos> Time slows down.<eos> It almost appears to stand still.
The wound appears cauterised but there may be bleeding underneath.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> Easy!<eos> Oh, you...!<eos> You used this device to access the memories of Jolinar left in your mind.<eos> That is how you knew how to escape.<eos> I will use it to get you to tell me everything I want to know.<eos> - It doesn't work that way.<eos> - I know how it works.<eos> When activated, it makes your memories easily accessible to your conscious mind.
- What is inside the container?<eos> - A weapon.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> The High Council believes the uprising of Apophis presents a key opportunity.<eos> Sokar will take his mother ship into orbit around Netu to restore order there.<eos> This weapon is intended for Sokar.<eos> Yes, but unfortunately we have no weapons capable of penetrating... ..the shields of a Goa'uld mother ship.<eos> - So how will this weapon be effective?<eos> - I am to launch it towards the moon,... ..into one of the holes of its surface and into the core.<eos> It will force the base elements into a cataclysmic chain reaction.
Here's the thing ...<eos> You said Denker had a heart attack while you were reading him a letter.<eos> - Was it in English or German?<eos> - German.<eos> - You speak German?<eos> - No.<eos> - You had no idea what it said?<eos> - No, but he seemed to understand.<eos> What we can't seem to figure out is the letter, Todd.<eos> - Do you know where it is?

What the...<eos> Mamooli!<eos> T. Ray!<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> You hear me?<eos> We've got to get off this ship.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's check it out.<eos> What about the vault?<eos> It'll be here.
- You okay?<eos> You look like shit.<eos> - I think I'm mixed up in something.<eos> Mixed up in what?<eos> There's no point trying to explain it, but a lot of strange things have been happening.<eos> The people on the elevator.<eos> There was no backing on it.<eos> I looked out.<eos> There was people there.<eos> And on the radio on the way to work, it starts following me along, talking about everything that I'm doing.
What Marguerite does is for all of us.<eos> We're counting on you to help her get ready.<eos> Lovely!<eos> Next thing you know... I shall be cleaning the fireplace with Danielle.<eos> Where is that girl?<eos> Probably off catching rabbits with her teeth.<eos> Begging your pardon, my lady... but that gilded mirror in your bedchamber... did you move it?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why?<eos> It's also missing.
- Really? - Yes.<eos> What they're saying is that they know law and I don't, they're real lawyers and I'm not.<eos> They're just trying to humiliate me.<eos> You are a personal injury lawyer, aren't you?<eos> I think you'll survive.<eos> - See?<eos> It's starting already.<eos> - No, you've started already.<eos> I'm on the defensive, they're the defendants.<eos> Do you think I might hear this motion before you explain to me what it's really about?
Rule 11, Your Honor.<eos> Specifically that Mr Schlichtmann had no evidential grounds on which to bring this suit, only his knowledge that W.R. Grace Corporation has a lot of money.<eos> Not true.<eos> He performed no real investigation, did no research of any consequence, except perhaps to review profit statements.<eos> And he's prepared his complaint so inexpertly as to render it moot.<eos> - All untrue.<eos> - Do you know what Rule 11 is?<eos> To be honest, Your Honor, I had to look it up.<eos> I'll be honest, so did I. Do you know why, Mr Cheeseman?<eos> Because it is so old and ambiguous few lawyers waste their time with it, or mine.
This is what it must feel like to drown.<eos> The sun rose, but whenever I stopped to wait for the others, I got cold, so I had to move on.<eos> I climb without bottled oxygen because I like the challenge.<eos> It's just me and the mountain.<eos> It's as simple as that.<eos> [Bilham] Hey, Paula, good news.<eos> I think I can see our team on the South Summit.<eos> Over.<eos> [Viesturs] The human body is not built to survive up here.<eos> It screams at you to turn around and go back.
Am I shot in the spine?<eos> Lift him up.<eos> Easy, easy, easy.<eos> Put some pressure on him.<eos> Easy, easy.<eos> Lift him up.<eos> It's OK, Doc.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Wade, you got an exit wound.<eos> It's in the small of your back.
? I know, I know, in a cabaret, but in the context of a rock show, I can see now, it's just a little bit more dodgy.<eos> The act was there, wasn't it?<eos> The act was there. Just a...<eos> Lead singer and founder of the greatest garage band know to mankind...<eos> CURT WILD!<eos> Curt Wild, founder of the influential garage band The Rats... came from the aluminium trailer parks of Michigan... where rock folklore claims far more primitive origins.<eos> According to legend, when Curt was 13, he was discovered by his mother in the family loo...<eos> "servicing" his older brother... and promptly shipped off for 18 months of schock treatment.<eos> The doctors guaranteed the treatment would fry the fairy clean out of him.<eos> But all it did was make him bonkers...
I'm just trying to understand.<eos> Rianne's not married either.<eos> That's hitting below the belt.<eos> You know, when I was married it was good. You know.<eos> You put the ring on.<eos> You make the commitment.<eos> You do all the....<eos> She's dead because I'm a cop.<eos> She's dead because I'm a cop and I...<eos> I don't wear the ring anymore but I look, and it's still there.
They've put a tube in your stomach to feed you.<eos> One day you start coughing and the doctor on duty says you suffer a heart attack.<eos> Lie.<eos> Your face is bluish and you look at me hopelessly.<eos> You make signs.<eos> The tube pierced your stomach and touches the lung.<eos> I buck up to take you out. I deal with everything.<eos> I transfer you to another clinic.<eos> A pneumologist cuts your back.<eos> The air leaves the lung and it goes flat.
Not in months.<eos> I don't even know why I bought the damn place.<eos> -Nice meeting you again.<eos> -Υou too. again.<eos> So. what's your name?<eos> Pat Healy.<eos> Wanna know mine?<eos> I already know it, Mary.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Because it's right there on your golf bag.
She was my life.<eos> There was something with this guy. Something alarming.<eos> Why are u named Otto?<eos> There is no explanation for that.<eos> Life contains much things that are not explainable.<eos> But Otto is a name that's very frequent in Germany.<eos> Are you a German?<eos> -I'm a Finn now.<eos> Only my name is still German.<eos> It's such a geometric name, Otto.
Stay down.<eos> We've been looking for you.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You have the number?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What is it?<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Where's the number?<eos> It's not on me.

He had to intone a single word.<eos> Yeah?<eos> That word was the true name of God.<eos> So?<eos> The true name, which only the Cohanim knew, was 216 letters long.<eos> Are you telling me that...<eos> That the number in my head is the true name of God.<eos> Yes!<eos> It's the key to the Messianic age.<eos> It will take us closer to the Garden of Eden.
Hello.<eos> A glass of water.<eos> Where can I find a taxi to take the child to the border?<eos> It won't be easy to find, the road is terrible.<eos> My son-in-law has a taxi.<eos> Shall I call him?<eos> Yes.<eos> He'll be here in 10 minutes.<eos> Giorgos, 4 rakis and something to eat!<eos> # If I send you an apple, it'll rot
Lucio Martínez Lucio, Senator... Nah!<eos> Now, comrades, Lucio Martínez is finished.<eos> Bootlicking comrades!<eos> Like Don Fabián used to say, Emiliano Zapata's family.<eos> God rest his soul.<eos> What's up, Eliseo?<eos> What's up, rooster?<eos> Will you accept the deputation?<eos> I'm content with my place.<eos> Sorry, bro, but it seems that it's already occupied.
- Like venus.<eos> - Seashells!<eos> - Seashells.<eos> - I dunno, maybe I... toe rings aren't cool, you know?<eos> - I know what you mean.<eos> - You can't see them in the sand.<eos> They don't stand out so much, really.<eos> At the beach, watches do, and also rings.<eos> Like here, and here.<eos> A ring... will it look good?
- We could go eat dinner.<eos> - That's fine.<eos> - Do I satisfy you in bed?<eos> What was that last one?<eos> Do I? Sexually? In bed?<eos> - Where did that come from?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I don't take anything for granted.<eos> Our giggling.<eos> It's bothering you.
RENEE: What's the big deal about 28?<eos> - It's two years from 30.<eos> At 15, I'd look at people who were 30 and think, "Die already."<eos> - And would they?<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> I'm strong enough to confront a certain truth.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - I'm nothing without my face.<eos> - I see.<eos> - It starts cracking at 30.
- Ling owns a porno club?<eos> It's not porno.<eos> There's no nudity.<eos> It's just women in bathing suits.<eos> - Wrestling.<eos> - Oh!<eos> It's sport.<eos> - How can she own that place?<eos> - And hide it?<eos> She bought it as a tax write-off, but it made a profit.
She doesn't regret it.<eos> As much as she declares remorse, I know she doesn't.<eos> She's just saying she's sorry to keep her job.<eos> It's not the easiest thing to leave a man.<eos> You never were in her positions-- Position.<eos> She lied to me.<eos> T o err is human.<eos> T o forgive, divine.<eos> There's an old Latin saying.<eos> What does it mean?
Do you feel triumphant, happiness, joy?<eos> Pity.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this is all he will ever have and all he will ever know.<eos> Because his name will be swallowed by silence. Forgotten.<eos> His name belongs to no one.<eos> And who does your name belong to, history?<eos> The world?<eos> No.<eos> It belongs to me.
I want him on the scanners.<eos> I want a toxology report in two minutes.<eos> Now, go!<eos> - Are you sure he was poisoned?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I only left him for a moment.<eos> He opened up a bottle of Brivari, took a few drinks and collapsed.<eos> - The bottles were marked for him?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Watch the blood pressure, it's dropping now!
- No?<eos> Then turn around.<eos> Why should I?<eos> I saw my death in a dream.<eos> I was an old man.<eos> How do I know I won't survive this?<eos> Perhaps this will pass and I will get better.<eos> The dream is prophecy.<eos> Prophecy is a guess that comes true.<eos> When it doesn't, it's a metaphor.
Prophecy is a guess that comes true.<eos> When it doesn't, it's a metaphor.<eos> You could put a gun to your head and pull the trigger and then the dream is just a dream and the prophecy is just a metaphor.<eos> And so are you.<eos> You're out of time, Londo.<eos> Turn around.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't know what he wants from me.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> The thing that has eaten away at your heart until it could not endure the pain a moment longer.
Hm...<eos> You don't have a fever.<eos> Oh, no, it's not that.<eos> I just...<eos> I didn't sleep well.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Your egg keep you up all night?<eos> You're killing me.<eos> Parenting's a pain.<eos> Wait till it starts dating.
Then trendoids start sporting them, so I'm totally not wearing it.<eos> Then I thought "Hey, I'm the one who started this craze.<eos> What am I ashamed of?"<eos> OK, Soliloquy Girl.<eos> I just wanted to ask about your egg.<eos> - My egg?<eos> - Yeah, your egg.<eos> - The one Mr Whitmore gave you.<eos> So... your egg isn't acting odd or anything?<eos> It isn't "acting" anything.
What do you think?<eos> - I just wanna crosscheck...<eos> - We don't have time.<eos> If this is gonna work, it has to work now.<eos> OK.<eos> Then I need maybe half an hour once we're all set up.<eos> Which means you just have to hold Angel off.<eos> Don't let him close on you.<eos> If the curse succeeds, you'll... you'll know.<eos> What don't you wait here to find out if it worked?
Does she?<eos> You should listen to him.<eos> The hair, it's so flat.<eos> And the lips...<eos> - Could we stay on topic here, honey?<eos> - What?<eos> - It's not a good idea.<eos> - There's no use arguing with me.<eos> Do you see my resolve face?<eos> You've seen it before - you know what it means.
If I have to, I'll go all the way to the Mayor.<eos> Wouldn't that be interesting?<eos> Don't worry about school, honey.<eos> If we can't get you back into Sunnydale, maybe we can swing private school.<eos> Private school?<eos> You mean, like, jackets and kilts?<eos> - You want me to get field-hockey knees?<eos> - It's not that bad.<eos> What about home schooling?<eos> It's not just for scary religious people any more.
We all feel your pain, Coach.<eos> I don't know two finer boys than Cameron and... that other one.<eos> But I know they'd want their friends to go on and win that state championship.<eos> - It's time to think about the team.<eos> - Hell, I don't have a complete team.<eos> If we don't find someone by this afternoon's tryouts, we won't be eligible to compete.<eos> You'll find someone.<eos> All he has to do is wear a bathing suit, right?<eos> This "me and my shadow" act?<eos> It's getting old.
Jasmine.<eos> - Night-blooming.<eos> - Like us.<eos> Oh, Angel... it's fairyland.<eos> It's paradise.<eos> Big windows, lovely gardens.<eos> It'll be perfect when we want the sunlight to kill us.<eos> If you don't like it, Spike, hit the stairs and go.<eos> Take a stand, man.<eos> Well, our old place was just fine till you went and had it burned down.
It smells like grandpa breath.<eos> I didn't have a lot of time.<eos> I had to use sulphur.<eos> Stinky, but effective.<eos> OK, let's do this.<eos> This will be a piece of cake.<eos> Maybe I'll sleep underground.<eos> Dig myself a little burrow.<eos> What about your pretty dress, sweet?<eos> It'll get all dirty.
- Angel!<eos> - He's not Angel any more.<eos> - Are you?<eos> - Wrong.<eos> I am Angel... at last.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I got a message for Buffy.<eos> Why don't you give it to me yourself?<eos> It's not really the kind of message you tell.<eos> It sort of involves finding the bodies of all your friends.
OK, everyone listen up.<eos> I wanna show you what to do if you are attacked from behind.<eos> In this situation, bend forward,... ..using your back and shoulders to flip the assailant over to the ground.<eos> Nuh!<eos> - Nuh!<eos> - Oh, Summers, you are turnin' me on!<eos> And that works, too.<eos> And while there is no scientific explanation for the lunar effect on the human psyche,... ..the phases of the moon seem to exert a great deal of psychological influence.<eos> The full moon seems to bring out our darkest qualities.<eos> And yet, ironically, it led to the invention of the MoonPie.
Just bones... on a slab... ..waiting to be buried.<eos> Oh, forgive me.<eos> You mustn't let my...morbid thoughts dissuade you from your purpose.<eos> Yes, I...<eos> Erm...<eos> I fear my... own bones will soon rot in the earth.<eos> - Where is the ring the Abbot gave you?<eos> - What?<eos> The Abbot's ring.<eos> Where is it?
You are mistaken, lady.<eos> He took me.<eos> I didn't steal him from you.<eos> What has happened between us happened honestly.<eos> I didn't seduce him.<eos> I hope you've given him some comfort, though.<eos> And he you, since Ruald turned his back on the world.<eos> I haven't come here to fight... ..or to apportion blame.<eos> My body is no longer of use to me.<eos> It is certainly of no use to my husband.
- Why do you do this to me?<eos> Three young women, completely unrelated except for the fact they died the exact same way as the waitress.<eos> Medical examiner listed them all as jumpers.<eos> Case closed.<eos> Look at the crime photos.<eos> All the vics were found locked in their rooms.<eos> We got the M.O. Of a serial killer here, Morris.<eos> I'm telling you, Piper, the spell worked.<eos> A little louder, Pheebs, I don't think Oakland heard.<eos> Well, it did. Get this.
I guess Grams was a little low on witch supplies.<eos> All right, next, we need the poppet.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I think we're set.<eos> We're ready to cast the spell.<eos> Okay, first, I'll make it stronger.<eos> Your love will wither and depart From my life and my heart<eos> Let me be, Jeremy And go away forever<eos> - Okay, the spell is complete.<eos> - Let's hope it works.
It's safer.<eos> I'll wait here.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Oh, my God, Piper.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I just had a premonition.<eos> A woman's about to get murdered.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Phoebe saw this murder before it happened.
Disintegrated to dust right before our very eyes.<eos> And you're afraid of a little drop of blood?<eos> - Okay, just cut my finger.<eos> - You do it.<eos> Okay, here.<eos> Melinda Warren, blood of our blood<eos> Our great- great- great- great- great- great- grandmother<eos> We summon thee<eos> Blessed be.<eos> No, don't rip the dress to make it fit me.
Chris needs you now more than ever.<eos> Come on, I want to see him.<eos> But he doesn't want to see anybody, Father!<eos> Fargo, that's an order.<eos> Take me to see Chris, the unhappy sheep.<eos> God, you should have seen him, he's just a shadow of a sheep.<eos> If I was a sheep, I'd be watching my back right now.<eos> Why?<eos> Because of the beast.<eos> They say it's as big as four cats and it's got a retractable leg so as it can leap up at you better.

- Maris repossessed his car.<eos> That must've been all he was able to afford.<eos> He's just ashamed to admit it.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Niles, do not hang up on me.<eos> We know what's going on.<eos> We're right behind you.<eos> I was afraid this would happen.<eos> I was petrified someone I knew would see me driving this humiliating car.<eos> It looks like some buggy derailed from a carnival ride, except that this has no safety features.
Come on, let's go.<eos> Nice oarsmanship, Mr. Oxford-Rowing-Champ.<eos> It's not very easy to keep your balance when your crewmate jumps on your back and shrieks like a tea kettle.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> The thing's tongue lolled out and licked my ankle.<eos> I just hope the wind changes direction before the party.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - They'll be here in 15 minutes.<eos> The stench is so strong I could almost swear the damn thing was still...<eos> - It's back!
- You are!<eos> You are so dead!<eos> I'm going to get you.<eos> Come here!<eos> It's very nice to meet you.<eos> Nobody!<eos> Nobody respects the bucket!<eos> You wouldn't believe what people put in here!<eos> Does this look like a garbage can to you?<eos> Does it look like an ashtray?

You think I stole some ring?<eos> We know you took it!<eos> Just save yourself the time and confess.<eos> Who are you, the Hardy Boys?<eos> I don't need to steal a stupid ring.<eos> I make $1,600 a week.<eos> Any of you guys make that?<eos> Marry me.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> It was in my room all night.
Both you guys should be up there with me.<eos> You two are my<eos> I'm lucky to have just one good<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> I got to go check something, okay?<eos> -What a baby!<eos> -Total wuss.<eos> -How come you're getting Nana's ring?<eos> -Mom gave it to me.<eos> She said something about it being a wedding ring and that you may not need one.
- Six toes and webbing in between!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - You think I'm kidding?<eos> It's not politically correct?<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Absolutely not. - Which part?<eos> City goats, hillbillies, the whole thing.<eos> You would prefer white trash?<eos> Why is that less offensive than any other racial epithet?<eos> It's not racial, it's descriptive.
As long as Proctor exercises his right to silence, she's the only case we've got.<eos> - Fingerprints alone won't do it.<eos> - Inspector...<eos> You can't know how deeply traumatised this experience has left my sister.<eos> - She can't sleep.<eos> - There's many a night I can't sleep.<eos> No, no.<eos> You don't understand the full horror of the situation.<eos> She can't sleep... alone.<eos> Three o'clock in the morning, like something from the nightmare world of M.R. James, as the duvet is lifted up... and you feel it sliding in beside you.
Norman and I have no secrets from each other.<eos> It was his suggestion to call you in.<eos> What do you think?<eos> An innocent mistake?<eos> Someone deliberately impersonating me for some reason?<eos> - Only time will tell, I suppose.<eos> - Time... spilling through our fingers, Madeline, with every heartbeat.<eos> Even as we stand here doing absolutely nothing, our lives, existence, everything is being voraciously consumed.<eos> Time can never be reclaimed.<eos> Where is it?

It's European.<eos> Hey, did George buy Joe Mayo that chair yet?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If I'm getting him a new fur, I'm not chipping in on a gift too.<eos> Yeah?<eos> George, did you get Joe Mayo that chair yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - What?<eos> - It's in transit.
Where are you taking me?<eos> Starbase 53 for further questioning.<eos> Does Captain Sisko know about this?<eos> It's none of his concern.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You have no right to do this, Sloan.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> Starfleet Special Order 667 15 gives me the authority to neutralize security threats to Deep Space 9 by whatever means necessary.<eos> Doctor, you're about to spend the rest of this war in a maximum-security cell... unless... you would care to put your thumbprint on this confession.<eos> We can reword it if it doesn't meet your exacting standards.
- Nor do I. Lower the temperature.<eos> - As you wish.<eos> - Is there anything else I can do?<eos> - Have you located Weyoun Six?<eos> - It's only a matter of time.<eos> - So you keep saying.<eos> I assure you, Founder.<eos> He will be dealt with.<eos> Did you notice her face?<eos> How parched it looked?
Doctor.<eos> I'm afraid you've contracted a nasty strain of the Ankaran flu.<eos> We've been treating you several days.<eos> Remember?<eos> No.<eos> Short-term memory loss-- it's one of the symptoms.<eos> Don't worry. lt isn't life-threatening, but we'll need to treat you...<eos> in Sick Bay.<eos> What is this treatment going to cost me?<eos> It's free of charge.
Probably injured.<eos> Beam it to Sick Bay.<eos> Are you sure that's wise, Captain?<eos> I'm betting that message we received was some sort of distress call and if we're going to help, I'd rather do it on Voyager.<eos> The physiology is so unusual the tricorder can't make heads or tails of it.<eos> The creature's obviously injured, but I haven't a clue how to treat it or even diagnose it.<eos> My scans came up with something interesting, Captain.<eos> The interfaces on the alien's vessel can only be activated chemically.<eos> I'm guessing that this life-form somehow interfaces directly with the ship's systems using biochemical secretions to give commands.<eos> That would explain how it can fly a ship.
Chevron four encoded.<eos> This is video the MALP sent back from P7J-989.<eos> Atmosphere, temperature, and radioactivity levels are ideal.<eos> Teal'c, is this structure familiar?<eos> - It is not of Goa'uld origin.
Don't worry, is just to talk.<eos> Robot to robot.<eos> - What?<eos> - Oh is nothing.<eos> Umm, this notion of living a 11, 000 years entered my mind for a moment and I couldn't... is a lot to take in.<eos> Apparently we've got time to adjust.<eos> We really do have all the same sensations and perceptions that we did in our human form.<eos> Well, if you think about it, the human body is just a machine.<eos> Is a vessel for our conciseness, I mean; is just an organic one.<eos> It performs work requires fuel...
Trust us?<eos> We are a simple people, Colonel.<eos> We have no means to protect ourselves from this disaster.<eos> If my uncle decides to trust you, our entire future will depend on that decision.<eos> OK, that's a little pressure! But we can handle that.<eos> Let them go.<eos> Please... help us.<eos> Why are you back so early?<eos> You were supposed to study that weather device.<eos> We would do, if it were still there.
