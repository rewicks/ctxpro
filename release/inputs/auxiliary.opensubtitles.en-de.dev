However, in practice it sucks.<eos> And I am not going to answer any more questions.<eos> What do you think we're trying to do in there?<eos> - Want a drink?<eos> - No.<eos> Whatever you may think, we're not conducting some kind of witch-hunt.<eos> What are you doing then?<eos> You might not be aware ofthis, but there's a lot of corruption that nobody's doing anything about.<eos> - Do you think you're doing something?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- And here you are.<eos> You saved my husband's life.<eos> It's unbelievable, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, I suppose it is.<eos> Did you know we were on our honeymoon?<eos> - We were married Friday.<eos> - Not much of a honeymoon.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> We lived together two years.<eos> We only did it for the family.
Who cares about the ocean, Wally? Right here.<eos> Get it off me.<eos> Get in the back of the tank.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> Betty.<eos> Macey.<eos> How's Mom and Dad?<eos> They're fine.<eos> Who knows how to load this gun?<eos> He does.
I even made you laugh.<eos> You came back again and made me fall in love with you.<eos> I couldn't figure you out. I thought, "He hasn't even noticed I'm a girl."<eos> Yet my heart was pounding away.<eos> You sure fooled me.<eos> If I'd known...<eos> Why didn't you tell me sooner?<eos> I've concealed my feelings all my life. I've always been evasive.<eos> You don't trust anyone. I trust you Sabine.<eos> I really do.
It's scrambled.<eos> The only way you can sort it out is on my play-back.<eos> - There's no code we can't break.<eos> - May I?<eos> Mr Roffe is her father!<eos> - But I'm her inspector.<eos> - Thank you, Inspector.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I think you will find it interesting, Miss Roffe.<eos> I did.
You got out of North Africa faster than Rommel.<eos> - Actually, he took his time.<eos> - Admit it.<eos> I terrified you.<eos> Yes, I admit it.<eos> I didn't know so much passion could exist in one so young.<eos> You were the most exotic, breath-stopping creature I'd ever known.<eos> Quite a danger to my health.<eos> What with you and my colonel and being shot at, I'm astonished I survived.<eos> - Perhaps you didn't.
It doesn't matter.<eos> There'll be no more courses.<eos> Now Ag√ºero is elected, there will be a general strike.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> If you want to kill someone.<eos> (girl) The trigger mechanism jammed.<eos> Take the .38.<eos> - Did you vote for him?<eos> - No. Nobody did.
I enjoy having a husband who is a member of a very important Cuban family.<eos> - It's important to me.<eos> - Rubbish!<eos> Don't speak to me like that.<eos> You're talking about things.<eos> Factories, houses.<eos> - Husbands.<eos> - He means nothing to you.<eos> How do you know what Juan means to me or has meant to me?<eos> You don't.
- What should I think?<eos> I am running in circles.<eos> I also can't distinguish fantasy and reality anymore.<eos> No!<eos> Don't!<eos> No!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Let me go!<eos> I don't want that!<eos> I don't!
Don't trust Whitey.<eos> "See a doctor and get rid of it."<eos> Bye, Grandma! .<eos> I sure do miss Navin.<eos> Is he ever coming back?<eos> Take away his place setting.<eos> It's making us too goddamn sad.<eos> I wonder if he's doing all right?<eos> Navin!<eos> . How you doing?
Persons having business with the Supreme Court, State of New York special term part five, draw nigh and ye shall be heard.<eos> This court is now in session.<eos> Judge Atkins presiding.<eos> All rise.<eos> - Is the petitioner's attorney ready?<eos> - I am, Your Honour.<eos> I would like to call Joanna Kramer.<eos> Motherhood, going for the throat.<eos> You swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Yes, but every time I talked to Ted...<eos> To my ex-husband about it, he wouldn't listen.<eos> He refused to discuss it in any serious way.<eos> He said that I probably couldn't get a job that would pay enough to hire a babysitter.<eos> Tell me, are you employed at the present time?<eos> I'm a sportswear designer here in New York.<eos> And what is your present salary?<eos> I make $31,000 a year.<eos> Mrs. Kramer, do you love your child?<eos> Yes, I do, very much.
I object, Your Honor.<eos> He must not be allowed to take the stand at this time.<eos> This is a jailhouse legal trick. I know it, you know it, the defense knows it.<eos> Mr. Powell will be allowed to testify.<eos> A trier of fact cannot draw an inference about what a witness will or will not do.<eos> Call your witness.<eos> - May I stand with my client, Your Honor?<eos> Call Gregory Ulas Powell.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you shall give... in the cause now pending in this court... shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
No, never.<eos> Then you've never loved.<eos> You're right!<eos> Because I never had time for it.<eos> - Why so much?<eos> - So there's enough for the chosen.<eos> Kazia, it wasn't that I didn't have time.<eos> I was a coward.<eos> It's good you know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Therefore, V'Ger is incapable of believing in them.<eos> What V'Ger needs in order to evolve is a human quality.<eos> Our capacity to leap beyond logic.<eos> Joining with its Creator might accomplish that.<eos> This machine wants to physically join with a human?<eos> Is that possible?<eos> Let's find out.<eos> I'll key the sequence through the ground-test computer.<eos> You don't know what that'll do!<eos> Yes, I do, Doctor.
What is this?<eos> -Your valuables.<eos> -Preposterous.Now please hurry.<eos> -There is a lady in grave danger.<eos> -Your watch, please.<eos> My watch?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Please, where is Lieutenant Mitchell?<eos> -You don't need that.<eos> -Yes, we do.
We have it on what would normally be good authority... that the President has died.<eos> However, we repeat, this is not confirmed.<eos> At the hospital, admiral George Burkley, U.S.-Navy... went for the emergency...<eos> Now, as you can see here, Mrs. Kennedy steps into the car.<eos> That's her waving.<eos> That's the President waving.<eos> Richie,<eos> - you know what true love means? - Yeah.<eos> That it means standing up by the person you love, thick and thin?<eos> Do you?
Look at the misfortune we've suffered.<eos> But it is God's will.<eos> If a person is insane then it's better -<eos> Bullshitto!<eos> I'll take her to the doctor tomorrow.<eos> You know how much it will cost?<eos> Well, all right.<eos> Did I say anything?<eos> I haven't written a word.<eos> But you did.
Dance? - Yes.<eos> And what about your son?<eos> Show Incitartus your new dance.<eos> My son he will dance with you.<eos> Music.<eos> You are... beautiful Drusil beautiful.<eos> We are all alone Drusil.<eos> He's going to kill me. - No. He can't kill me.<eos> The fever must be at soothe. - He's going to kill me.<eos> What if it doesn't?
Apollo, Starbuck.<eos> You're not feeling left out, are you?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> What would make you think that?<eos> Commander, could you take a look at this?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It was there behind us and then it was gone.<eos> Field looks clear to me now.<eos> Now it does but every once in a while...
If he left her off of the ship, he must be planning something crazy.<eos> - I have to get back to the Pegasus.<eos> - You're with us.<eos> Your father's orders.<eos> He knows nothing about this, it was my idea.<eos> - I'll take her place.<eos> - You can't spot the Cylon base. She can.<eos> Where's your medtech? I don't see one.<eos> - We don't have one.<eos> - You do now.
You don't need a numo to feed the layers.<eos> - What if a lupus comes around?<eos> - I said leave it!<eos> I thought you said the only guns here were numos.<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> A gun is a gun.<eos> I hate them all. if it weren't for the lupus that attack the stock,<eos> My husband was killed by a gun like yours.<eos> - I know how you feel.<eos> - Do you?
It can follow us at a safe distance and plot our every move... until the reinforcements arrive.<eos> Let 's go down on the deck beneath the scanners<eos> Warriors requesting permission to locate and pursue Cylon base ship.<eos> No.<eos> Colonel, we must conserve our resources... if we're to find a home for our people.<eos> Bring the feet home.<eos> - Get onto Cylon frequency<eos> - What for?<eos> They can't see us, but they'll be able to hear us<eos> Doing what?
All had high rates of interest.<eos> We better tell Smokey.<eos> You know this ain't no big deal.<eos> Smokey, man, look.<eos> You saw this shit, man.<eos> This is illegal loans, man.<eos> This...<eos> I checked with Michigan National Bank, Smokey, right?<eos> They don't charge no fucking 15% interest a month.<eos> No bank does in the world.
You stay outta the heat.<eos> Unfortunately he has a habit of wasting taxpayers' money.<eos> The only way to use dues is to use them against senators.<eos> Mr Kovak, are you not in bed with Babe Milano?<eos> Can we have a quote?<eos> (applause)<eos> (gavel)<eos> Will you rise, Mr Kovak?<eos> Do you solemnly swear the evidence you give before this Senate select committee shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
A rather overweight, balding, middle-aged man with a feather on his head... sitting cross-legged on the floor, very gravely and gently... telling a circle of totally absorbed girls what it was like... to be in a World War II Japanese prison camp.<eos> And she turned around and went outside and got in her car... and thanked God for being married to a man like you.<eos> Are you still there, Harry?<eos> Yeah, well, look. Sometimes married people get into an emotional straitjacket, and it's kind of hard for them to express how they truly feel about each other. Total honesty is the key.<eos> Yes, I've known Doris for 20 years, and I'm not ashamed to admit that it's been one of the most intimate, satisfying experiences of my life.<eos> My name?<eos> My name is Father Michael O'Herlihy.<eos> Right.<eos> It never changes, does it?<eos> About the only thing that doesn't.
You just go to church to steal the offertory box.<eos> With all the dough my mom donates every morning I'm only taking back what's mine.<eos> Anyway...<eos> In my opinion, nuns oughta dress like nuns.<eos> Heard that, Sister?<eos> My buddy wants you to put on your nun's dress!<eos> Come on, get movin'!<eos> Do it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Do it, Sister!
-Adults and their problems.<eos> -Your father's great.<eos> Such an important figure. Manager!<eos> In a liquor factory.<eos> Never has any time though.<eos> Neither does my mom.<eos> I sometimes wonder if they set aside any time for love.<eos> Not for me.<eos> They buy me clothes instead.<eos> -They don't do it for their own good.
I did keep an eye on you, Tom.<eos> By choosing to plead for others, rather than yourself I can now grant you your own plea.<eos> You may go back up there.<eos> You gonna leave us, Tom?<eos> But there is still the matter of cherchez la femme!<eos> We shouldn't keep him from young Ellie and that.<eos> Good-bye, then, Claude.<eos> I'll never meet a braver sword fighter than you!<eos> And Terrence, you may think you're a bit of a seaweed but when it's needed, you give your all.<eos> I do, don't I?
Someone changed it.<eos> We'll have to do it again.<eos> - The grasshopper drove to Florida.<eos> - The ant got stepped on.<eos> Will you stop that?<eos> - Why are they picking on us tonight?<eos> [Clears throat] Hello, Miss Peters.<eos> Oh, hello, Robin.<eos> I didn't see you.<eos> Most people don't.
Goodbye!<eos> - "l am a tiger..."<eos> - Keep the change.<eos> What sort of a song is that?<eos> We want ABBA!<eos> We want ABBA!<eos> Just in time, Ashley.<eos> - In studio 2.<eos> - We thought you'd never make it.<eos> Neither did I.
She knows in her heart that I'm her only hope, if her child is to live.<eos> So, please, do as I say and put her on the stand.<eos> Her aim is to put you in jail, Mr Hoover.<eos> Quiet in the courtroom.<eos> Rise, please.<eos> Be seated.<eos> Mr Mack, call your next witness.<eos> The defence calls Mary Lou Sides.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the testimony you may give in the case now appearing before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Do you like it?<eos> Yes provided I'm not locked up.<eos> Why would we do that?<eos> Come.<eos> Bilitis your poem, what was it about?<eos> About?<eos> Love?<eos> Yes, a girl who...<eos> Do you learn to ride horses at your school?<eos> Yes, some do, but not me.
I didn't say...<eos> - You are deceptive.<eos> Oh, please, will you?<eos> It's 5:00 in the morning.<eos> You deceived your friend.<eos> - What do you mean, I deceived...?<eos> - Why did you come up here?<eos> Why did you come up here?<eos> I came up to see him.<eos> What do you...?
Established their strength?<eos> - No, sir, but I've got some men in...<eos> - Have they been identified?<eos> Not by our intelligence.<eos> So it's the same rumors as before, right?<eos> - I believe these rumors, sir.<eos> - Why?<eos> The general consensus of opinion is that our opposition will consist entirely of Hitler Youth or old men on bicycles.<eos> I don't really know why, sir.<eos> Perhaps because no one in intelligence does.
Go outside and have a hot dog, okay?<eos> Ronnie, don't tell him that.<eos> Don't talk about this until you know what you're talking about.<eos> If I can't talk about it, how will I know what's going on?<eos> What?<eos> Mom, I believe in them.<eos> I believe in them too.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Dad says we do.<eos> No, he does not.
And that's no lover's kiss.<eos> Every ship from the new world passed through these waters.<eos> They had to.<eos> K'ang Hsi porcelain from China.<eos> Japanese silk-screens.<eos> And those ivory doodads from India.<eos> And all that Inca gold that Pizarro took out of Peru.<eos> Do you believe all that, boy?<eos> Yeah, I believe all of it.<eos> Every bit of it. So do you.
Neurotics can be dazzling at that game.<eos> They aim unswervingly at your area of maximum vulnerability.<eos> Which is, I suppose, a good way of describing Margaret.<eos> - Now, stop it.<eos> - Do I embarrass you?<eos> - I suspect you're about to.<eos> - My wife doesn't understand me.<eos> Do you understand her?<eos> No.<eos> Obviously I never did.
- It'II be the drug next.<eos> - What drug?<eos> - I've heard! I'm not ignorant.<eos> I know what you get up to, pumping people full of truth drugs so they... can't help saying things.<eos> That's next, isn't it?<eos> alan... do you know why you're here?<eos> So... so you can give me truth drugs.<eos> - He actually believes they exist.<eos> - Truth drugs?<eos> - Yes. - And don't they?
- Then that's all you need to know.<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because... it is his.<eos> - His?<eos> - His pain.<eos> His own.<eos> - He made it.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> Well, I don't.
As America prepares for another presidential election year... Japan celebrates 1948... with the first anniversary of its new constitution.<eos> Mmm... not these.<eos> I think this one's the best.<eos> I thought you might like that one.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Court, what time is it in Wisconsin?<eos> - I can never figure out...<eos> - Polls closed an hour ago, and I wish I had been there.<eos> - I would have had one of these on every lamppost.<eos> - No, you don't, Vic.
He tried to break the door?<eos> Why break?<eos> Listen, my Russian is not very good.<eos> He knocked at the door and said he wants to go too.<eos> You ask such questions... Awkward.<eos> - Did the defendant break the chandelier?<eos> - Yes, he did, why deny it.<eos> When we were leaving he caught it with a chair accidentally. I have a question, may I?<eos> Did the defendant feel personal enmity towards the victim?<eos> He did.
- Of course I do.<eos> Sophie, you wanted your talma.<eos> I've brought it.<eos> I didn't stand there on purpose.<eos> Oh, my goodness...<eos> My God, how vulgar!<eos> How vulgar it is, how vulgar...<eos> If...<eos> Do you understand anything?<eos> Do you...
Remember one thing, when you pose... a lot of little guys have one habit.<eos> And they hide away when they pose.<eos> When they do an arm pose, they do like this.<eos> The big guy will come right out with his arm.<eos> Never do that, never hide away.<eos> Like right now, you did like this.<eos> You know, show them.<eos> Show them the whole thing.<eos> Make the move, open up the whole body.<eos> Do the same thing again.
-Let's go.<eos> I wanna beat him!<eos> I need 10 pounds.<eos> -10 pounds on each side? -Yeah.<eos> -How many, Hank?<eos> -Come on, I wanna see ten.<eos> -Ten!<eos> -You're gonna do them, too.<eos> -You're gonna wipe 'em out!<eos> -I'll do it.
- We`ll never make that much money.<eos> - Hey, douche, douche! - It`s all right.<eos> - Why don`t you kill fags on Sunday?<eos> - `Cause then they`ll go to heaven.<eos> Hey, sweetheart!<eos> You`re terrific!<eos> - This is a drag.<eos> - What`s with you today?<eos> - l`m not sure l`ll do 2001 tonight.<eos> - Fucking do it!
And now pay for the wine!<eos> Now it hurts again!<eos> Quick, let's get out of here!<eos> You're here?<eos> Chen Yu, you have a job to do!<eos> What are you wasting time here?<eos> Tell me first, why are you here?<eos> By orders from our ministry, I'm here to keep an eye on you.<eos> - Whether you like it or not.<eos> - I don't!
Tomorrow, I'm not gonna sit in this thing and talk to my wife and tell her everything is going fine.<eos> I'm not gonna do it.<eos> I tried.<eos> I got two little kids with big bright eyes.<eos> And I used to tell them their daddy was gonna make them proud of him like he was of them.<eos> And now I gotta go home, I gotta kiss them and gotta look in their eyes and tell them I really did this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe that's better that telling them I really didn't do it.<eos> I wish I knew what was right.<eos> I really don't.
Please enjoy it.<eos> Drink.<eos> Father... mother!<eos> Look carefully.<eos> Watch how your parents die.<eos> Spare them!<eos> I'll do anything!<eos> Please don't kill my parents!<eos> Go ahead, but don't kill them too quickly.<eos> Do it slowly.
You know I love French singers. I love french fries.<eos> French fries?<eos> I don't get that.<eos> I didn't order any.<eos> Hey, Hey, Kermit? - Mm? The Great Gonzo wants me to manage him.<eos> Yeah, Scooter understands the soul of a true artist.<eos> Mm-hmm, - Yeah, but, Scooter, I hired you as a gofer,<eos> Gofer coffee, gofer sandwiches, remember?<eos> Yeah, well, I can still do that, but Gonzo needs personal management,<eos> Oh, I do, Kermit, I truly do!
Collins, we'll be there in 20 minutes.<eos> That's how long you got.<eos> Hey, take it easy.<eos> He's got no way of knowing what's going down.<eos> Do it, will you, Charlie?<eos> It's that important.<eos> Captain Dobey will confirm.<eos> Have him call Receiving Hospital and check on Starsk.<eos> Got any second thoughts about leaving the hospital?<eos> Do you?
The coordinates.<eos> - Change the coordinates.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Ironman!<eos> The coordinates, change them, Alex!<eos> I knew he wasn't ready to do an earthquake.<eos> Come on, baby!<eos> Shoulders, you're doin' it!<eos> - We did it!
- Change the coordinates.<eos> - Huh?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Ironman!<eos> The coordinates, change them, Alex!<eos> I knew he wasn't ready to do an earthquake.<eos> Come on, baby!<eos> Shoulders, you're doin' it!<eos> - We did it!<eos> - We did it!
All right, you two, that's enough.<eos> But it's true!<eos> Pure guilt.<eos> Come Sunday, all those roadhouse sins are gonna be washed away.<eos> Jason, I have nothing to wash away.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I know your Texas dish.<eos> She may be from the Lone Star State but she's not alone much.<eos> - You two wanna leave the table?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Well, I really had in mind someone of more experience.<eos> Oh, I have experience.<eos> You've heard of the Haystack Gang?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I play with them.<eos> And the Sunday Morning Gospeleers.<eos> I'm one of those, too.<eos> Well, you see, the music in here is kind of different.<eos> Well, that's what I'm saying.<eos> I do different kinds of music.
I can't help it.<eos> Well, I'll tell ya one thing.<eos> I've been around plenty.<eos> I seen 'em come and I seen 'em go... and you're about as first-class a whore as I ever come across.<eos> Oh, boy, that's life for ya.<eos> A girl has to die before anybody says anything nice about her.<eos> Charlie, I told you to stop it.<eos> He's not gonna hear you.<eos> - There's a man down there!<eos> - Somebody did.
You Mustapha?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Just come into my office here.<eos> Just you.<eos> Don't worry, pig, she won't get lonesome.<eos> That's mighty white of you.<eos> Before we do anything uncalled-for I'd like to point out that I'm an officer.<eos> Callahan.<eos> Where do I know you from?<eos> You don't.
You saw Madam Hua die, yet I am alive.<eos> You're very smart, but you forgot one thing.<eos> What is that?<eos> There is one person who knows Madam Hua is still alive.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> It can't be.<eos> It is me.<eos> I'm still alive.<eos> You didn't think this could happen.<eos> I certainly didn't.
Then he kissed me... and walked off into the trees and down the lane.<eos> In that room, I found charts of tide tables and waters... in the sound and the ocean.<eos> He'll never be found.<eos> Did you cry a lot?<eos> Depends what you mean by a lot.<eos> No.<eos> I guess not very much.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> - It'd be nice.<eos> - But you don't.
She sat right over there.<eos> Smoked her gold-tipped cigarettes... went on and on about the pollution in the Mediterranean... and how marvelous it would be to stay here.<eos> I hated myself for doing it, but I actually acted happy to see her.<eos> She asked me for a drink, but I lied and told her we didn't have any.<eos> I gave her some tea with the same almond biscuits.<eos> They're very good.<eos> My father had given me a small bottle containing some white powder.<eos> He said if she should arrive, I should put it in her tea.<eos> It would calm her, make her less aggressive.<eos> Well, it sure did.
Fr√É¬§ulein Devereux may need me.<eos> - I'm coming with you. - No.<eos> Stay here!<eos> Your leg will not bear!<eos> Keep watch here!<eos> Shoot, Holmes! Shoot, man!<eos> Shoot!<eos> Stop!<eos> Throw it down, infidel.<eos> Not before you do.
Downtown we call this the mountain.<eos> I know.<eos> How'd your folks die?<eos> They were on their way to North Carolina... in my father's plane.<eos> Pilot flew into a mountain in the fog.<eos> I was camped up on Pyramid Peak... at the time in the Rockies.<eos> They were dead for two weeks... before my uncle finally located me.<eos> And then I moved in here in November.<eos> How come you need such a big place?<eos> Well, I don't.
Ah, I thought you were going out, dear.<eos> What's this?<eos> - I decided, Sybil, to advertise.<eos> - How much did it cost?<eos> Oh, I haven't... 15?<eos> - 40.<eos> - 40.<eos> I have told you where we advertise.<eos> - Sybil, I know the hotel business.<eos> - No, you don't, Basil.
Mr Fawlty to you, Lord Melbury.<eos> - I beg your pardon?<eos> - Nothing, please forget all about it.<eos> Here's the cheque for ¬£200.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Now, about my priceless collection of coins?<eos> Yes, do you still...<eos> Do I still want you to take them to be valued by the Duke of Buckleigh, My Lord?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, I don't.
Not at this time of night.<eos> Push harder, you'll be wearing it.<eos> Give her a break.<eos> Ginger was her friend.<eos> Then there's a lot she can tell us.<eos> Starting with how she knew.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That Ginger was dead.<eos> How did you know that before anybody else at the club?<eos> I... I didn't.
You know.<eos> You and Lonnie Craig were friends.<eos> You had to spend a lot of time together teaching him how to hold a gun the things to say in a liquor store holdup, all the important things in life.<eos> What are you gonna do charge me with contributing to the delinquency of a minor?<eos> I'm gonna give you about 30 seconds, Tramaine.<eos> Then I'm gonna turn around and walk out of this room. After that, what happens is between you my highly excitable partner and him.<eos> - We want an ex-con, white male--<eos> - Somewhere in his mid-50s.<eos> You told me, and I told you I don't know him!<eos> But Lonnie did.
Explain again how sheep's bladders may be employed to prevent earthquakes.<eos> - Certainly, sir.<eos> - Look, my liege.<eos> - Camelot. - Camelot.<eos> - Camelot.<eos> - It's only a model.<eos> Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home.<eos> Let us ride to Camelot!<eos> We're knights of the Round Table We dance whene'er we're able<eos> We do routines and chorus scenes With footwork impeccable
It's not important now.<eos> What did I say?<eos> Alice. What did I say?<eos> That someone was persecuting you.<eos> Who? Who?<eos> An organization.<eos> Agents.<eos> Did I mention the name?<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh yes I did.
My good man, how are... you?<eos> I was very worried about your health.<eos> It's not nice to keep a friend in uncertainty for so long.<eos> I've missed seeing you.<eos> Thank you, you are a good person.<eos> Of course... yesterday I gave 25 rubles for summer camps.<eos> How's our wool?<eos> I bought it and sold it for cash.<eos> That's good, as I need a lot of cash today.<eos> Who doesn't?
Ricardo<eos> Why don't we all drink<eos> Some very sexy wine<eos> Why don't we all drink<eos> Some very sexy wine<eos> Why don't we all drink<eos> Some very sexy wine<eos> The princess was in peril The chicken was delicious<eos> Now we drink, Now we dance Let's hope we don't get sick<eos> - Why don't we all
Hello?<eos> I just saw myself there.<eos> Why am I doing it?<eos> -Doing what?<eos> -Robbing a bank.<eos> I don't know what you mean by that.<eos> I'm robbing a bank because they got money here.<eos> I mean, why do you feel you have to steal for money?<eos> Couldn 't you get a job?<eos> No. Doing what?
I'll do anything you ask me<eos> You're a weakling<eos> This man you're engaged to... Do you love him?<eos> I wish I could understand you<eos> You are killing me, Eva!<eos> I'll always love you, darling<eos> Only you understand me<eos> Tell me, darling do you still love Niepolomski?<eos> No!<eos> I don't
Where was I?<eos> 315, 320.<eos> $325 in charity.<eos> That old bag only offered me 200.<eos> You see, Bill. Honesty is the best policy.<eos> You're richer and a priest kissed you.<eos> Disgusting!<eos> Why do you have to act worse than you already are?<eos> Sure, Twinkle-Toes here never pukes, does he?<eos> He doesn't do it in his hat.
She will.<eos> No, she won't.<eos> She's new, that's all.<eos> No.<eos> I love her.<eos> Come on, stop.<eos> Pierre is watching you.<eos> You like him?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do?
There's nothing to be upset about.<eos> - Everything's fine.<eos> - It's not fine.<eos> I was worried.<eos> Walter, I love you, but you expect me to be a mind reader.<eos> I love you.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Do you...?<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I really do.
So don't get any ideas.<eos> Look, I haven't got time even for ideas.<eos> Bobby, when you play like you do, I just get wobbly all over.<eos> Well, sugar, maybe you ought to see a nerve doctor.<eos> Now, wobbly knees usually calls for medicine not music.<eos> Now, don't you go teasing me, Bobby Bigelow.<eos> I just never did hear nobody play so darn perfect.<eos> Girl, you are a true music-lover.<eos> Say, Jason, you didn't give us very much on that last guitar break, son.<eos> I did the usual.
Picture Jesus Christ surrounded by children.<eos> One on his knee and a little girl with her baby brother in her arms.<eos> Christ is talking to them.<eos> "Whoever receives one little child in My name receives Me."<eos> He's telling one of your Bible stories.<eos> "But whoever offends one of these little ones who believes in Me.<eos> "It were far better that a millstone be hanged around his neck,<eos> "and he be drowned in the depth of the sea."<eos> Who knows what a millstone is?<eos> - I don't.
I mean, they do know the right and the wrong of it, though, and I just...<eos> But they are men, you know.<eos> Just men like the rest of us.<eos> And you...<eos> You know that man was only created by God on the sixth day.<eos> He created everything else, you know.<eos> Heavens, the stars, the infinite spaces, the grasses, the herbs, trees, animals.<eos> And he invented man.<eos> And he had to rest a full day for his labor.<eos> He did all that before man.
To Fornalski that he stopped informing on you?<eos> He did about Hela.<eos> But the boss outdid him and sacked her not you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - l'll be back. - Wait, we'll tell you some more.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Did you tell the boss about me and Hela?<eos> Somebody had to do it.<eos> She wasn't good enough for you, don't you see?<eos> I do.
That's a bastard, you can see that!<eos> How can I see that?<eos> The eyes...<eos> But yes, of course!<eos> All men that look at me, are bastards, especially if they don't look at you!<eos> Have you heard the new theory?<eos> It tells the character of e man by the colour of his eyes.<eos> It's the theory of a Professor Stenner.<eos> Ah yes...<eos> - How do you do that?
She's the daughter of a diplomat.<eos> She's only 21. And I heard she's still a virgin<eos> I met her at a reception. I could chat with her a bit.<eos> And I managed to meet her parents.<eos> She's lovely, isn't she?<eos> I badly want her.<eos> And you're going to want her too.<eos> She's going to be a fine recruit, don't you think?<eos> Yes, she's hot and nicely shaped. We absolutely need to get her.<eos> Yes, we do.
Went down?<eos> Hey, come on, you know I'm keeping clean.<eos> You're staying very lucky.<eos> Listen, Cappy, I've got a problem.<eos> CAPPY: Yeah, so I hear.<eos> - Mike, ain't it?<eos> - Yeah, what do you hear?<eos> He's in trouble with the department.<eos> - Doesn't figure.<eos> - So, what does?
What I don't know is what set her off last night.<eos> And what I'm thinking might involve murder.<eos> Joanna.<eos> Mother, I have to talk to John.<eos> You are not going anywhere.<eos> And certainly not anywhere near John Reed.<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> He wants Julia.<eos> He wants to take her away from me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You can't made a decision like that. You haven't even ask me.<eos> I wasn't even going to tell you.<eos> Jess.<eos> I want us to have a baby.<eos> Peter, I can't!<eos> Oh, Christ, Jess.<eos> Don't you ever consider anyone but yourself?<eos> I've thought this out very carefully and I know what I'm gonna do.<eos> Do you know how important this afternoon is to me?<eos> Yes, I do.
IDo.<eos> YouKnowIDo.<eos> Mmm. You Know What A Disastrous Year Last Year Was.<eos> Well, Our Prices Don't Look Any Better This Year, And Then With The Increased Burden Of Taxes... Oh,We'llMuddleThrough.<eos> Yes,Well, That's The Point.<eos> There's No Reason For A Woman Like You To Have To Struggle So Just To Eke Out A Meager Existence.<eos> Why Don't You Put The Place Up For Sale?<eos> ButI Don'tWant To Sell The Farm.<eos> You Know How Much It Means To Me.<eos> Yes,I Do.
- Relax and I'll tell you.<eos> If you don't hear from me in two hours, you and Duffy come to 1 7 12 Alameda.<eos> - Jesus, that's in Chinatown, aint it?<eos> - I know where it is.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Come on in, Lou.<eos> Looks like we're both too late.<eos> She flew the coop.<eos> And you've no idea where she went?<eos> As a matter of fact I do.
What is this called?<eos> Look well, don't make another mistake!<eos> - Peeled sweet pomegranate.<eos> - Idiot! That's not it.<eos> - Tell me, then!<eos> - The Inn of Good Food.<eos> And what is this called?<eos> Look carefully! No mistakes!<eos> - Who knows?<eos> - I do!
How can I keep our dealers in line if they see we can't deliver protection?<eos> Yes, I know how important that is.<eos> Well, do you know the word is out all over town?<eos> The whole operation is in a panic.<eos> Two of our street pushers have already left the city.<eos> What went wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I put him with Claudia and that new girl, Misty Cotton.<eos> Said it all went well. It was all set up.<eos> Oh, she did, did she?
- What time is it?<eos> - 2:00-ish.<eos> 2:00?<eos> Do you mean I've been in here for two hours?<eos> All in the line of duty.<eos> Duty?<eos> I'm resigning in the morning.<eos> Oh, Goodnight, come on, don't let us down.<eos> - The Service needs women like you.<eos> - Well, obviously you don't.
- You bet he did.<eos> - He brought the balloons... and you spoke of things in general.<eos> If I hear anything... it's my civic duty to tell the right person.<eos> Who else knows?<eos> - Why don't you guys print up a program?<eos> - Nobody knows, Myra.<eos> I was just Stan's very good friend.<eos> I talked only to Stan... not his very good friend... and I'm not talking to you.<eos> I don't like you.<eos> I never did.
Probably just a tourist looking at the tower.<eos> I suppose he was cruising by, looked up and got curious.<eos> He was looking at us, I'm sure of it!<eos> No.<eos> I tried every switch.<eos> Maybe they disconnected the electricity.<eos> I can't stay in the dark, I can't take it!<eos> Well, there must be a central switch or a fuse box somewhere, but where?<eos> Did you try the garage?<eos> No, I didn't!
Did you go out to Lin Wu's house that night?<eos> Yeah, I think I was out there.<eos> Did you see Lin Wu?<eos> Well, that's pretty hard to say.<eos> They all look alike to me.<eos> All right, you can step down.<eos> Greg Dundee, come to the stand, please.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Right you are, gentlemen.<eos> Be right with you.<eos> Just have a chair.<eos> You don't like our company?<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> I'm speakin' to you, pig shit.<eos> I think he's got some of that pig shit in his ear.<eos> I don't know which smells worse, him or the shit in the bottle.<eos> What did you say your name was again?<eos> I didn't.
I'm really strong!<eos> - Really?<eos> I have a squeeze that kills!<eos> You?<eos> - Yes, why you<eos> Of course I do!<eos> - No!<eos> You don't believe me!<eos> - We do believe you!<eos> No, you don't!
Do you know who he is?<eos> !<eos> He is a...sort of woodsman.<eos> Yours?<eos> No-ones!<eos> Whats he doing on the estate?<eos> Well he lives here.<eos> Ahh Mrs.Luke, do you know anything about the woodsman, who lives in the grounds?<eos> I think you'd best ask the master, mi'lady.<eos> Do you?
- I had to hold your hand while they set it.<eos> - You want some?<eos> - Yeah, black, please.<eos> Boy, we had a real messy one tonight.<eos> A junkie killed his connection with a shotgun.<eos> Blew his head clean off, then OD'd himself.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Kind of strange, isn't it?<eos> At least, that's what my partner says. I don't believe it.<eos> You don't?
It'II make it much easier for me to control her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> -Does Mr. Krogstad live here?<eos> -Yes.<eos> -May I see him, please?<eos> -He's out.<eos> Good. excellent.<eos> Very good.<eos> You're dancing as if your life depended on it.<eos> It does.
Hey, where did this come from?<eos> -I found it. -Where?<eos> In the closet.<eos> Have you been playing with it?<eos> -Yep.<eos> -Do you know how?<eos> I'll show you.<eos> Wait a minute. You need two.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> I do it all the time.
Maybe they would still be alive today.<eos> I should have become a gardener instead.<eos> - You used to be very ambitious.<eos> - Do you think of that as a virtue?<eos> Money, status, fame.<eos> Those are just toys. No real adult person would be interested in that.<eos> - Don't you want to try it again?<eos> - No. Dear Robert, you're pigheaded.<eos> - Someone told me that before.<eos> - Yes... - I did.
Why?<eos> This way!<eos> Come on, Prince, hurry up!<eos> Send me back!<eos> Everything will be ready in 3 minutes.<eos> Wait a bit, Ivan Vassilyevich.<eos> You'd better change into your tsar's clothes.<eos> Damn!<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> You don't? Good.
He'd just got into England and was with his manager, Chas Chandler... and he brought him to this gig.<eos> A guy comes up to Clapton and asks if he can sit in.<eos> I doubt whether Clapton got many people actually coming up... and asking him if they could sit in, because... being the world's greatest guitar player, all the other guitar players... would be super deferential about him.<eos> Anyway, this guy came up and Clapton said, "Yeah."<eos> The guy plugs his guitar in... starts to play.<eos> Starts to play amazingly.<eos> No one had ever seen anything like it.<eos> He's playing just the fastest, wailingest blues runs... anyone's ever heard.<eos> I think he did a Howlin' Wolf number or something.<eos> But he did his whole routine.
- You guess what, sailor?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Nothing?<eos> Nothing, sir.<eos> - Did the prisoner offer resistance?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> Did he try to escape?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> That's a little vague.<eos> Either he did or he didn't.
- Welcome home, Billy.<eos> And did you miss me?<eos> So much you had to take up with that low-down piece, old Hyatt.<eos> C√≥mo est√°s, Silva?<eos> Buenos dias, Billy.<eos> Now, you're uglier than me.<eos> How's it going, Beaver?<eos> Eno, I thought you boys would be out in the Nueces or Colorado by now.<eos> Well, I figured to watch you get stretched but might have knowed you'd show up.<eos> Good thing somebody did.
"No more jokes until the end of the show."<eos> I got to pee.<eos> - Your friend Max is out there.<eos> - Max is going to be mad at me, too... because I'm getting drunk and he's not.<eos> You're a friend of mine.<eos> Max isn't.<eos> Max is out there with all his friends.<eos> And you're in here having a good time.<eos> I told you it pays to be a friend of Jack Riley's.<eos> - It sure does, Jack.
I love you in my selfish way and I think you love me, in your fussy, pestering way.<eos> We love each other like people do here on earth, but you're so demanding.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> It's as simple as this:<eos> Here I am in a dark house somewhere in the world, with my arms around you and you are here in my arms. I lack empathy for my fellow human beings.<eos> I'm low on imagination, I suppose.<eos> I don't know what my love looks like and I can't describe it.<eos> Most of the time I don't feel it.<eos> You think I love you too?<eos> Yes, I do.
Scared, miserable, dreading to go to work.<eos> It's tearing me apart! And then I get sick of hearing about it, and I start hating myself.<eos> You didn't like my being a cop, so don't give me that shit.<eos> I love you! I want to marry you!<eos> I want to have children with you!<eos> - Goddamn it! I hate it!<eos> - Why don't you get out?<eos> - Why don't you?<eos> - It's crossed my mind.<eos> Well, do it.
I don't know. He just left.<eos> Swell.<eos> New furniture?<eos> - I've been with him for four years.<eos> - Furniture?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hey, this is really a terrific place.<eos> That's rice.<eos> Yeah, I've seen it before.<eos> Tab does pretty well for himself, doesn't he?
I lammed around a bunch of bohunk towns, one kick ahead of the G-men.<eos> Would be still, if Billie hadrt set me up here.<eos> Don't kid yourself, friend.<eos> I still know how.<eos> Are you going to stay for breakfast, or do you already know how to eat?<eos> I picked something up along the way.<eos> Is Lonnegan after you too?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I ain't seen anybody.<eos> You never do, kid.
The heads of the studios have reversed their positions and any employee who is an unfriendly witness before the committee is fired.<eos> Oh, Jesus.<eos> So now we have an official blacklist.<eos> It's an open season for witch hunters and stool pigeons.<eos> And now the problem is, how to convince the public that a stool pigeon is a hero.<eos> You are like these damn palm trees.<eos> They don't belong here either.<eos> They were brought in and they look it.<eos> I'm sure that they don't like it either.<eos> - What if he does, Paula?
A friend.<eos> Some friend.<eos> Well, it's a friendly town if you don't mind having your friends inform on you.<eos> I suppose you'll say it doesn't mean anything.<eos> It doesn't.<eos> Your picture will be a smash, Hubbell.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> But you didn't like it.<eos> Let's say I appreciated it.<eos> What didn't you like?
They've done nothing.<eos> Bloody hell!<eos> Get up at 4 in the morning... Slave away all day like a mule. Then come home to eat some bread and see a bunch of long faces...<eos> Well, now you'll see no more of them!<eos> Ma'am, it's time to take the boiler off.<eos> What's the matter? - Nothing!<eos> Well, eat something, then.<eos> - I don't want anything!<eos> Why?<eos> - Because I don't!
I mean, what do you really know about me, Kate?<eos> I know you brought me up here to kill me.<eos> You believe that and you still came?<eos> I had to.<eos> Am I wrong?<eos> You know, Kate, when you first started to work at that bank, I was still in high school fighting for tips at the country club.<eos> Parking cars, carrying golf bags, cleaning out the locker rooms.<eos> Watching the beautiful people glide in and out like they owned the world.<eos> And you know what?<eos> They did.
- I don't have to tell you anything.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> We can now.<eos> Where'd you get this?<eos> You can get anything, anywhere, if you pay for it.<eos> My name is Stone, Mike Stone.<eos> I never met your father, but from everything I've heard, I'm sure he didn't teach you that.<eos> No.<eos> But I want that man to pay.<eos> Vi, we do too.
I know him.<eos> Do you know how he makes his living?<eos> I'm afraid there must be some mistake.<eos> The Arthur Styles that I know--<eos> This is the Arthur Styles that we're talking about.<eos> I didn't know anything about that murder.<eos> I don't think I want to talk about this anymore.<eos> If you'll excuse me, I have a faculty meeting. Excuse me.<eos> You know, I don't really think she knew about this man.<eos> She does now.
My nephew is waiting in the office for me.<eos> He starts tomorrow. He will be working at the pool.<eos> Help me, help me!<eos> Very cold?<eos> My uncle still in there?<eos> Yeah, he's at the pool, you can go in.<eos> Oh, this is no joke.<eos> I am drowning here.<eos> How are you now? That's not unusual.<eos> People often do...
Look, those are your choices, Mr. Hobbes.<eos> We still got a shot with your testimony, but you've got to stay cool.<eos> And he'll be coming after you with every trick in the book.<eos> All right.<eos> Put me on the stand.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The people call Robert Hobbes.<eos> Raise your right hand please. Do you promise to tell the truth, the whole truth - and nothing but, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Tillman, wait.<eos> Tillman, listen.<eos> Stone, you better catch that lunatic and get him--<eos> Come on, never mind talking up here.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> CARL: If you don't...<eos> JERRY: I've got it.<eos> It's in the transformer box.<eos> - He knows what he's doing all right.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Get back!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Hurry, Comrade Division Commissar!<eos> They're surrounding the village from the Left.<eos> Get behind that house.<eos> We√≠ll cover you.<eos> Osin, that's no way out.<eos> - You don't understand...<eos> - I do.
is it?<eos> You never seem to get tired.<eos> But I do.<eos> I still don't know what to call you.<eos> -You know my name.<eos> -Caine.<eos> is that your first name or your surname?<eos> What is surname?<eos> There's so much you don't know.<eos> And so much you do.
History will speak for itself.<eos> I need men like you.<eos> No work without pay.<eos> A Marxist like you should see that.<eos> You set a bad example.<eos> That's what we fight for.<eos> We have nothing.<eos> Why'd the 1871 Paris Commune fail? They wouldn't attack the Bank of France! Historians all agree on that.<eos> Work for me, Simon, and I'll pay you well.<eos> Like you did for the ambassador?
Your behavior isn't very Marxist.<eos> But you aren't Marxists.<eos> You're cheap hoodlums!<eos> Easy, there!<eos> I'll bet $1,000 he talks.<eos> $2,000, he doesn't.<eos> I'm with you, Jacques.<eos> Well?<eos> $2,000 he doesn't talk.<eos> $3,000, he does.
A smile so charming, Your eyes' fascination<eos> Promise forever A bliss of desire.<eos> Now he was happy, Now burst in tears,<eos> Now he was happy, Now burst in tears!<eos> No, he did not love...<eos> To me, poor heart, So he was saying...<eos> Bastards!<eos> Come and get me, dirty fascists!<eos> To me, poor heart, So he was saying, Though he didn't, No, he did not love...<eos> He did not!
Hey, Pope, can I see you a second?<eos> Come in, will you?<eos> It's been a long goddamn night.<eos> Pope, I want to talk to you.<eos> I want you to understand...<eos> Do you want a drink?<eos> No, I don't drink.<eos> You will, Pope. You will.<eos> Monday I'll give you all the facts, names and figures.<eos> - I just don't...
What do you do for a living?<eos> I work in a boutique on the King's Road. Well...<eos> I'm sure you could use a little money.<eos> Anything within reason. I'm pretty generous.<eos> You will keep in mind what's been happening to the stock market?<eos> Since January, Armbruster Industries has dropped 14 and a half points.<eos> - Like music.<eos> OK.<eos> Do you swear that you are Wendell Armbruster Jr, and this is the body of your father, Wendell Armbruster Sr?<eos> - I do. - Lo giura.

Where are you?<eos> Aw, did I wake you up?<eos> Mr Armbruster, if you don't leave immediately, I shall call the concierge.<eos> I've been giving a great deal of thought to our relationship.<eos> - Operator?<eos> - I suspect something's wrong with it.<eos> - Operator, get me the concierge. - We got off on the wrong foot.<eos> I've been called plump. I've been called pudgy, and chubby. But I've never been called fat-arse.<eos> - Did I say that?<eos> - You certainly did.
You've frightened my chickens...<eos> While you are eating, disasters are happening in the world.<eos> Good evening, eldmother! Good eevening!<eos> - Uncle Costache sells everything.<eos> - Who cares?<eos> let it be. Well, he has already sold it!<eos> I'm coming from lorgu.<eos> He sold him the restaurant and the house.<eos> That knave, Felix, announced him, that lorgu wants to buy and the old man hurried to give that capitalist the house.<eos> How do you do, dear?
- I took her poor, because of our love<eos> - But we gave you money.<eos> The money are being spent. Besides the amount was...<eos> They were merely enough not to starve for only one year.<eos> You've promised us a home.<eos> We are not asking for this, even if Olimpia has her rights as oldest daughter.<eos> But what about the house on Stirbei Voda street?<eos> ! What the hell!<eos> - If the fool doesn't agree...<eos> - He doesn't, he doesn't.
Mr. Crockett, begging your pardon, I do believe Mr. Smith made good sense.<eos> - We must all go together.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> Are you contradicting me?<eos> Just because of one small crisis, you want to run?<eos> Mr. Crockett. Really, it's not a small crisis.<eos> You got to see that.<eos> I see who's loyal and who isn't. That's what I see.<eos> Now, if you wanna go, both of you, well, go.<eos> Do you?
I want it tight for it to burn.<eos> Get these stumps down under the ground.<eos> Round up that pile.<eos> Get it to burn. Down on the ground.<eos> Keep that line straight.<eos> Keep that line tight.<eos> Hello, Doc.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Get to Beynon... tell him I'm for sale, his price.<eos> Do it now.
Make them make it with each other!<eos> - That's a good idea!<eos> - Make it with each other.<eos> Too sick, man.<eos> Loosen her up a little bit.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Come on. Don't worry about it.<eos> You'll have plenty of time to feel the pain.<eos> Weasel here is a specialist with a twist.<eos> Do it!
What's on your mind, Bart?<eos> - We'd like to talk to you about something.<eos> - Go right ahead.<eos> The railroads are coming.<eos> But we don't think the train's even going to stop here.<eos> What with men hanging right out in clear view.<eos> Don't get us wrong, Judge.<eos> We ain't against hanging.<eos> We just feel that it should be done more private.<eos> Yeah, in Dallas they do it in a barn outside town.
Amen.<eos> - Enjoy your meal, everyone. - Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is there a chance someone could give me a ride to the nearest town in the morning?<eos> Naturally, they'll be paid.<eos> It's not a question of money.<eos> It's a long way, and we only do that journey once or twice a year.<eos> And that's a decision that Pa makes.<eos> Well, what about if you need something urgently or even just a doctor?<eos> We don't, ever.
Do you think they understood that, bailiff?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm sure they did. Well, let's get tonight's horror show on the road.<eos> Ah-choo! Is your honor feeling all right?<eos> No, my honor is not feeling all right.<eos> My head is pounding. My metabolism Has practically ceased to function,<eos> That's too bad, sir.<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like To sit here night after night And watch this endless parade<eos> Of human debris floating by? Yes, sir. Of course I have.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
He was gonna kill me, man.<eos> It was self-defence. I could just see it coming, you know?<eos> You got a fresh score, huh?<eos> I don't have to say nothing to you.<eos> What's with somebody getting killed? Gonna try to pin that on me too?<eos> - An officer was shot.<eos> - Cop.<eos> - We'll see if you get off.<eos> - You think I did it, huh?<eos> The lieutenant does.
So your little boy's adopted.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And the adoption is illegal.<eos> Or questionable.<eos> And you think that the guy and woman are his natural parents.<eos> Do you have a name, Mrs. Reardon?<eos> No. We've never seen them.<eos> That was part of the understanding.<eos> They're not supposed to even know who we are.<eos> Well, they apparently do.
When I'm bored I imagine there's someone there who's playing with me.<eos> - That's why I liked it.<eos> Chess seems scary, it looks really mathematical to me. Yes, it is very mathematical.<eos> Is math interesting?<eos> Isn't it a bit tiring? It can be tiring. Depends on what you're doing.<eos> Let's have a game of chess. I'll teach you the rules.<eos> I thought it was just doctors who played chess.<eos> They look like the kind of people who would play it. They have the minds for math.<eos> So what do you do...<eos> besides this, what do you do in life?
Well, if you insist, I'll be ready in 45 minutes.<eos> Why should it take you that long?<eos> Well, you don't want me to go in these rags, do you?<eos> Okay, how do I look?<eos> Colonel, you look like a million marks.<eos> I have the funniest feeling, like I'm sending my daughter to her first dance.<eos> Don't worry, Daddy, I'll be home early, and if anybody gets fresh with me, I'll remember what you told me to do.<eos> Oh, Field Marshal von Leiter, happy birthday, sir!<eos> How nice to see you again.<eos> Yes, how do you do?
In the meantime, on behalf of our local countrymen, and our good friends, welcome home.<eos> The traffic is lighter than I expected.<eos> Go.<eos> Valenkoff, are you still there?<eos> Yes, I'm still here.<eos> How close are you?<eos> I cannot tell yet.<eos> I am surprised that both Gregor and his wife were called to Washington.<eos> Do you have any idea why?<eos> No, Colonel, I do not.
My perspective is an almshouse.<eos> Too bad.<eos> - I have a principle not to lend anyone.<eos> I don't ask.<eos> Not due to the pride, but because I know who I am dealing with.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I want to work.<eos> - I am sorry, but I don't need you.<eos> - Yes, you do.

For your food and the warmth of this kitchen!<eos> And the guns of the soldiers that protect you from the Turks and the outlaws!<eos> You ungrateful lot.<eos> You're the envy of the village, you know that?<eos> So be satisfied and keep your mouths shut!<eos> I just want to see my Teri again.<eos> My little girl.<eos> I just want to see her again. Alive.<eos> She'll turn up.<eos> They always do.
I wanna practice my harp, but I can't with a dangerous enemy in the same room.<eos> I always wondered what it would take to make you practice.<eos> Hello.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Edwina.<eos> - Mine is...<eos> - Corporal John McBurney.<eos> Now, how'd you know that?<eos> You said so when you came here.<eos> Did I?
28?<eos> 29.<eos> I like going out with older women.<eos> Are you married?<eos> You don't want to get married?<eos> I'd marry you in a minute.<eos> Can you cook?<eos> - Spaghetti.<eos> - I can cook spaghetti.<eos> - Good, you do the cooking.
- Claude!<eos> I found you at last. -Anne?<eos> - Here's a letter from MurieI.<eos> I know she's still in love with you.<eos> - She says she loves me...<eos> She wants to go away with me.<eos> - You must accept.<eos> I know you love her, too.<eos> - Yes, I Iove her...<eos> as much as I did before.
There flew 4 crowns away!<eos> So, it costed 4 crowns, that bowl?<eos> I daresay, that was a blessing in disguise for you.<eos> You see, I charge 5 crowns, sometimes more.<eos> Pulling a head out of a soup bowl is no easy matter! 5 crowns?<eos> I thought you only charged 3 crowns, sir.<eos> Upon my honour no, 5 crowns, not an "√∂re" less!<eos> But now the boy has managed to cure himself.<eos> He did yes.<eos> Yes, he did!
- How does he know?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess McCabe told him.<eos> - How is it going?<eos> - I'm beating his ass off.<eos> Drink on the house, Mr. McCabe?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You didn't say your name was McCabe when you came in here.<eos> I didn't say it now.<eos> You did.
Maybe, but I like to dress how I like. I don't like uniforms.<eos> What did you do after the dressmaking?<eos> Mostly housework for my uncle.<eos> I was used to such work.<eos> There was always plenty at home, scrubbing my brothers and sisters.<eos> I did some other jobs too.<eos> I was a salesgirl, and I worked in a macaroni factory.<eos> But not for long.<eos> Others stay.<eos> I never do.
They don't seem to know who they're dealing with...<eos> Sign here.<eos> -That's an even $500.<eos> -Fair enough, so long sheriff.<eos> Oh, I almost forgot...<eos> Regards from Mr Parker.<eos> -Hey wait, then you're the two?<eos> -Well, what do I do with them?<eos> -They work for Parker too, don't they?<eos> -So does everybody else in San Jos√©.
-Hey wait, then you're the two?<eos> -Well, what do I do with them?<eos> -They work for Parker too, don't they?<eos> -So does everybody else in San Jos√©.<eos> -So what's the problem?<eos> I don't suppose there's any reason to keep them locked up, is there?<eos> Let them cool off for a couple of days, then let them tie you up and hit you on the head.<eos> And put a price of $500 on their heads, alive if you like...<eos> You know that Parker doesn't want anybody hanging around the mission?<eos> Oh, sure we do.
the parson's eldest boy.<eos> how i cried.<eos> you suggest-- you suggest that i'm heartbroken or miserable or sad.<eos> i'm none of these.<eos> do you misconstrue?<eos> peter.<eos> his name is quint.<eos> he made this.<eos> i don't know.<eos> but you do. mrs. grose.
He volunteered at the request of Commandant Klink.<eos> Oh, Flensheim road again?<eos> No, it's the north road.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> North road, out towards the Hammelburg power station.<eos> I know nothing!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Thank you, Colonel Hogan.<eos> He knows nothing.<eos> Never bloody well does.
When I asked for volunteers for that assault force, every guard in this camp had night duty tonight.<eos> Ah, that proves they're not afraid of the dark.<eos> Is it usual that all of your men have night duty?<eos> There's a great deal of camp spirit here.<eos> There has never been an escape, and it is a matter of pride.<eos> Even when they're off duty, they're on duty.<eos> Maybe they sensed something in the air, an attempted escape.<eos> They are the ones that are doing the escaping, along with their commandant, I might add.<eos> I told you how sorry I was.<eos> So did all of your men!
Thank you, General.<eos> What have we here? Cheese?<eos> Knowing what a gourmet the general is...<eos> I'll take it.<eos> Yeah, why don't you check it out at lunch?<eos> Yes, General, why don't you take the whole carton?<eos> The general can check the brandy after dinner, and Mrs. Burkhalter can wear the silk stockings to see if they are real.<eos> You have a good man here, Klink. One of the best!<eos> Yeah, he said he was going to search the barracks every week.<eos> I did?
Let him through, he's crazy.<eos> I quarrelled with Catherine.<eos> - What about?<eos> - About you.<eos> I spoke ill of you.<eos> You shouldn't.<eos> I said you're crazy about your memory.<eos> Nothing's too fine for it.<eos> - You embroider.<eos> - No, you do.
He's probably singing to himself.<eos> And how beautifully he sings.<eos> Oh, occasionally I prefer the record player.<eos> Click click!<eos> Less troublesome... and much more obedient.<eos> Your knowledge of my requirements dear brother is extensive, but not necessarily complete.<eos> My dear ladies, do you mind if I smoke?<eos> Oh, please do.<eos> I don't think smoking is a vice.<eos> My father does it all the time.
And I was there to meet him. Where is it now?<eos> In the safe at the hotel.<eos> But...<eos> I'm the only one that can get it. I see.<eos> Sanchez, go with him and get it.<eos> Oh, when?<eos> When do we talk price?<eos> When I see what you've got.<eos> I don't suppose I've got much choice, do I?<eos> No, you don't.
You'd better check it out.<eos> Eve, are you all right?<eos> Your grandfather's outside.<eos> He's ready to negotiate.<eos> Very well-- l am ready to negotiate.<eos> Why don't you both stop the act?<eos> Both of you.<eos> Yes, act.<eos> Eve, I don't understand.<eos> You don't?
We have established beyond doubt that he has been secretly associated with the terrorists for years.<eos> Major, what if I were to be placed in a cell near El Kebir?<eos> Could that be arranged?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> Under the circumstances, I think it best that Vassier not be informed.<eos> I intended to wait until he had left the prison.<eos> I'm not asking you to be grateful.<eos> I'm asking you to pretend gratitude for the press.<eos> Vassier, the people love me, do they not?<eos> Many of them do, yes.
Which scene are we shooting first?<eos> Why, it's scene one.<eos> Scene one.<eos> Scene one.<eos> It's in the middle of the movie.<eos> Well, it is now.<eos> I rewrote it.<eos> I thought we cut that. Didn't we cut...?<eos> - No, we didn't.<eos> - We didn't?
- Highway patrol's bringing him in.<eos> - When will he be here?<eos> - About half an hour. Good.<eos> Now I'll have that sandwich.<eos> I haven't eaten since...<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> No, don't go away.<eos> I'd like you to meet Mrs. Quonsett, the stowaway I was talking about before.<eos> This is Mr. Bakersfeld, general manager of the airport.<eos> Well, how do you do?
Better, thank you.<eos> What about you?<eos> - Me?<eos> Fairly well, thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> Except for a slight head cold.<eos> Had it for about a week.<eos> Can't seem to shake it.<eos> You know what they're like.<eos> No, I don't.
Gentlemen, come in.<eos> Sheriff Brady, Jess Evans, this is Alex McSween.<eos> He's part of the family.<eos> - Howdy.<eos> - What does he do?<eos> He used to be a storekeeper, and now he's my lawyer.<eos> I prefer storekeepers.<eos> Then don't ever get arrested.<eos> I don't intend to.<eos> Neither did Riker.
We'll swing by the ranch and pick up the judge.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hello, Pat, Charlie, Tom.<eos> - You shouldn't be up and around, Billy.<eos> - Neither should they.<eos> They won't be for long.<eos> - What's gonna happen to 'em?<eos> - They're gonna be tried and hanged.<eos> - And you believe that?<eos> - John Chisum does.
Mine is Pretzi.<eos> They call me Pretzi, because, you see,<eos> I sell pretzels on the waterfront.<eos> - Where you from?<eos> - Greece. Oh! I used to know a Greek guy.<eos> He ran a beanery down in the Village.<eos> His name was Apollo.<eos> I never found out what his second name was.<eos> - I know Apollo.<eos> - You do?
It's a matter of logistics.<eos> - Logistics?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We've got logistics coming out of our ears!<eos> What we need is fighting spirit!<eos> The will to win!<eos> Where are those aerial photographs?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They don't seem to be here.<eos> They don't what?
She is also my fianc√©e.<eos> - You're getting married?<eos> - We went to school together.<eos> We decided we'd be married as soon as I sold my first novel.<eos> - When's that?<eos> - At this rate, next century.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> - Who am I to argue with publishers?<eos> - What do they know?<eos> - Something I don't, apparently.
I'm sure he'll give it serious consideration.<eos> - Amusing, isn't it? - What? That the plans for the invasion of Sicily... should have been put forward in an Algerian lavatory.<eos> George, I have bad news for you about your Sicily plan.<eos> Ike has turned it down.<eos> Since the Italians will be defending their native soil for the first time... and the German resistance is stiffening, we shouldn't be divided.<eos> - Well, where do my people land then?<eos> - In the Gulf of Gela.<eos> There's nothing there but a beach.<eos> Yes, but it puts you in a good position to support Montgomery.<eos> Where does Montgomery land?
I going to get Charlie's wagon and then I'm going to...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can't run a medicine show by yourself.<eos> I'm pretty good at getting people to buy that Apache Herb Tonic.<eos> Something will turn up.<eos> It always does.<eos> You know... I like you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Cos you don't cry.<eos> Oh, but I do.
I spoke to General Miles. He took it up with General Marshall.<eos> The order stands.<eos> The president is off the ultra list.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Withholding information from the president.<eos> Security found a copy of an intercept in a waste basket at the White House.<eos> Truth is, the brass don't trust some men close to the president.<eos> Does anyone trust anyone anymore?<eos> - Do you even trust your own wife?<eos> - Do you?
- Can you let me in?<eos> - I'm sorry, we're closed.<eos> Yes, I see that, but...<eos> I'm sorry, really.<eos> Where can I go, then? Well...<eos> There isn't anywhere. Not in this village.<eos> The next village is 10 miles away.<eos> There's nowhere else for miles around.<eos> Except the castle.<eos> Do they do bed and breakfast?
I'm very, very lucky.<eos> I really love you.<eos> Another trick!<eos> You liar!<eos> You don't believe me?<eos> Here's the evidence.<eos> You still doubt me?<eos> I'll keep going until you change your mind.<eos> No, no, I believe you.<eos> I really do.
Nothing expensive for Christmas.<eos> It's just the thought that counts.<eos> How much can it cost to gift wrap a hand grenade?<eos> Dismissed!<eos> Strudel, strudel.<eos> I'm going to miss it.<eos> I'm going to miss it.<eos> Well, maybe there will be someone to make it for you at your new post.<eos> Where did you say it is?<eos> I didn't.
Did you get enough sauerkraut?<eos> - I want to meet her.<eos> - Who?<eos> - Your wife.<eos> - My wife?<eos> I want to get things straightened out with her.<eos> Come on.<eos> That really isn't necessary.<eos> I want her to tell me herself she wants to leave you.<eos> She does.
Aren't you going to try it on?<eos> A mink stole.<eos> Okay, what are you trying to tell me?<eos> Why do you think I'm trying to tell you something?<eos> You're not stingy, but you're not the last of the big-time spenders, either.<eos> As a matter of fact, there was something that I wanted to tell you.<eos> - It's about me and my...<eos> - Your wife?<eos> - I get the message.<eos> - You do?
He was in the Bahamas or something.<eos> I wanted her to make him come back as soon as possible,<eos> - the next day. - Giving him what excuse?<eos> A good one:<eos> the truth, barely altered.<eos> I wanted her to tell him she'd met a man in Meg√®ve who was getting really close to her and that she was afraid she wouldn't resist him very much longer, that if he didn't show up the next day,<eos> she was afraid something might happen.<eos> It was a cry for help.<eos> - But she refused to do it.<eos> - She did.
Even his holster.<eos> I remember that, because he wore it high on his belt.<eos> Not low, like some of these showoffy young'uns.<eos> John McKay.<eos> That's who you saw.<eos> You mean the McKay?<eos> Big John McKay?<eos> That's right.<eos> Thought he was killed years ago, down along the Red River.<eos> So did I.
And I went to bed that night, Friday night, and I didn't get an hour's sleep at all.<eos> I were frightened about t'bird, that she'd fly off or summat like that.<eos> Anyway, when t'mornin' came, I kept on sayin' to missen<eos> "If she flies off, she flies off, and it can't be helped".<eos> So I took t'swivel off and let her hop onto t'post.<eos> There were nowt stopping' her, she could fly off.<eos> All that were on her were jesses.<eos> I thought "She must fly off.<eos> She's forced to fly off".<eos> But she didn't.
- What was that?<eos> - Don't let him go, Pardner.<eos> - You said she was in love with me.<eos> - Didn't you say you loved him?<eos> Yes, I did, and I do.<eos> You just said you were in love with Ben.<eos> Yes, I did, and I am.<eos> Ben, do you, uh... get that feeling you need a drink?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - Cos I do, too.
Stay for a while.<eos> Or you know what? Better let's go to a tavern and have a drink.<eos> I'm sorry, I don't drink.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> There's a good painting of mine hanging there.<eos> It's disappeared.<eos> Pour us two glasses of your best wine.<eos> For me and my friend, the painter Lado.<eos> You sold my picture, didn't you?<eos> I did, Nikolo.
Who?<eos> Your brother-in-law.<eos> Yes.<eos> And he's got lots of money. It's the biggest garage in the country<eos> What's his name?<eos> Maybe I know him, I often<eos> Go to Brittany, in the region where I love<eos> Paul Decourt.<eos> It would surprise me if you knew him<eos> No, I don't.
Agreed?<eos> Do you know what I want done with Fr–¥ulein Bern?<eos> Of course.<eos> You want her killed in such a way that Skarbeck will be blamed for it.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You want to love Mona Bern, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> The same way that you loved Carlotta Kleve, with your whole heart, your whole being.<eos> You want to love Mona that way, do you not?<eos> Yes, yes, yes, I do.
Now, tell me, Nicole, do you always go around rescuing men that you don't even know?<eos> Oh, but I know a great deal about you.<eos> You do.<eos> What?<eos> Well, statistically, you're about 37.<eos> Educated at the Venskry Academy. Top of your class.<eos> Handsome. Recently promoted.<eos> And you are unmarried but not unscarred.<eos> That's very good.<eos> How did you do that?
- Right.<eos> They will operate very soon.<eos> - Will he survive?<eos> - I believe so.<eos> Thank God.<eos> Is your relief personal or out of concern for his deal with Demetrious?<eos> I know nothing of Mr. Demetrious' deals.<eos> Yet you travel with him all the time.<eos> Only when I'm not working.<eos> What sort of work do you do?
My daughter does the cooking.<eos> Well, gentlemen, I think it's only fair to tell you that I'd only be interested in this job on a temporary basis.<eos> Oh?<eos> Well, you see, actually I was on my way to Australia when I heard about your gold strike.<eos> And I decided to, uh, travel through here to see if I could pick up a little stake.<eos> What do you wanna go to Australia for?<eos> Well, it's the last of the frontier country.<eos> I thought I might like to do a little pioneering.<eos> I thought this was frontier country and we was pioneers.<eos> So did I.
- No, no, it's resting.<eos> - All right then.<eos> If it's resting, I'll wake it up.<eos> Hello, Polly.<eos> I've got a nice cuttlefish for you when you wake up, Polly Parrot.<eos> - There, it moved.<eos> - No, it didn't.<eos> - That was you pushing the cage.<eos> - I did not.<eos> Yes, you did.
Are you putting on a show?<eos> Why are you with him all day?<eos> You don't even talk to me.<eos> And at night you act as though nothing's going on and sleep with me.<eos> - Are you jealous?<eos> - Don't laugh at me!<eos> I want you to like me.<eos> L'm learning to be cheerful.<eos> I know one thing. You love me.<eos> - No, I don't.

I trust you didn't forget it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Did you get the plan?<eos> I'll do no more until you tell me who you really are.<eos> What you're involved in.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> I am Baron Frankenstein.<eos> Frankenstein.<eos> I thought the world had seen the last of you.<eos> So did a lot of other people.
What is it like to feel pain?<eos> It is like... Like when you see the people have no hope for happiness, Father.<eos> You feel great despair.<eos> And your heart is heavy because you know you can do nothing.<eos> Pain is like that.<eos> Your courage gives me great pride.<eos> - Let me see her.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - You don't know what she may have.<eos> - But we do.
You suspected your wife?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> At first, frankly, yes.<eos> Her behaviour did seem at the time to me who was after all there to see, to be a little odd.<eos> - Odd? - Yes.<eos> I mean, to a certain extent, yes.<eos> I'm not by nature a suspicious person, far from it.<eos> I have a reputation as an after-dinner speaker, if you take my meaning.<eos> Yes, I certainly do.
I've zeroed in on one of your spores.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Well, so you have, so you have.<eos> That's nice work, Ted.<eos> Ted... why haven't you spent some time with your dad?<eos> You know, you've barely seen him these last two days.<eos> But I thought you wanted me to help you.<eos> Yes, but I thought you came here to be on safari.<eos> Dad did, maybe.
Come in.<eos> It's no use, Judy.<eos> Dad and Jack are out of range, and he doesn't even have a walkie-talkie.<eos> They're never gonna find Sandy. They're looking for elephant tracks instead of tire marks.<eos> It's up to us, Judy, come on. Let's go.<eos> I don't know where to start looking.<eos> Maybe we should try the Wganda area.<eos> I hope I'm right. Just won't be another chance for Sandy.<eos> Well, it has to be there, Judy.<eos> Something to do with that place.
Where would you find snakes here?<eos> In my father's collection!<eos> - What? Extraordinary!<eos> The world's most poisonous snakes, here?<eos> - They belong to my father.<eos> Close the lid, Sir John!<eos> - I wanted to know how active they are.<eos> These creatures are fed, I imagine.<eos> Who does it, you?<eos> No, Grimsby does it.
- Hello.<eos> You don't recognize me?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, yes, sure.<eos> Excuse me, please.<eos> How are you?<eos> If you recognize me, why do you never say hello to me on the street?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Fred doesn't know her.<eos> Nobody does.
I'll go in through the emergency air lock.<eos> Without your space helmet, Dave you're going to find that rather difficult.<eos> Hal, I won't argue with you anymore.<eos> Open the doors!<eos> Dave this conversation can serve no purpose anymore. Goodbye. Hal?<eos> Just what do you think you're doing, Dave?<eos> Dave I really think I'm entitled to an answer to that question.<eos> I know everything hasn't been quite right with me but I can assure you now very confidently that it's going to be all right again.<eos> I feel much better now.<eos> I really do.
Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Nora.<eos> - Mr Hurley.<eos> The bridle broke going home from church.<eos> - Dad patched it but I need a new one.<eos> - I'll fix it in a jiffy.<eos> Thanks. I'll be back after I finish my trading.<eos> Mr Hurley...<eos> What did you think of the new preacher yesterday?<eos> A lot more than he does of this town.
Here's Anzio, Rome, Cisterna.<eos> This must be the line of defense.<eos> Where are we?<eos> About there.<eos> Our main objective is to get to Anzio as quick as possible preferably in one piece.<eos> I say we go south.<eos> Try to break through around Cassino.<eos> That'll take a month.<eos> The line'll be hard.<eos> Only one way to do it quickly: direct to Anzio.
And yet I've no reason to lie.<eos> I'm not proud of it, anyhow.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> With the life I lead... the fellows I've had to sleep with<eos> because I haven't got a bed... to say nothing of those who try it on<eos> I think it's noble of you...<eos> You don't believe me, do you?<eos> You're mad...<eos> I do believe you.<eos> I really do.
What did happen to the other track coach?<eos> I don't know. He got to acting real weird.<eos> Talking to himself, real down in the chops.<eos> One day, he just disappeared. Just...<eos> And he was gone.<eos> Good night, Gudger.<eos> Good night, Coach.<eos> Mr. Walker.<eos> This is Mr. Purvis, our football coach, whom you undoubtedly know by reputation.<eos> Well, I certainly do. Who doesn't?
The question, what happens as Godolphin faces Broxton's mighty relay team?<eos> Gentlemen, take your marks.<eos> Set.<eos> Come on, Broxton!<eos> At the end of the first lap, the first three runners are closely bunched.<eos> They pass the baton for the start of the second lap. It's Broxton first, Tidewater second, State third, and there's the Godolphin man, laboring along in the rear.<eos> Easy now, Coach.<eos> You're tensing up. Maybe I shouldn't have yelled at him.<eos> How's a dumb pirate supposed to know what principles are?<eos> - But I do.
But where?<eos> On the gates of that house.<eos> Welcome back, my son.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm back. You can release the child, now.<eos> Yes, I have you back.<eos> Now I don't have to release the child, do I?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You... You have no use for her.<eos> Ah, but I do, my son.
Howard, come on!<eos> -Please bring me my--<eos> -Howard!<eos> Oh, Lord, I'm coming in.<eos> Howard!<eos> Come on, bring that!<eos> Get over here!<eos> How are things in Glocca Morra?<eos> Is that willow tree Still weeping' there?<eos> Does that laddie With the twinkling' eye
Can't you see I'm black?<eos> I think it's very becoming.<eos> Well, it isn't!<eos> I'm a white man, damn it!<eos> I'm a white man!<eos> At least I was until a couple of days ago.<eos> Well, that's a coincidence.<eos> I was green a couple of weeks ago!<eos> Don't you find the change of color interesting?<eos> No, I don't!
You know, I was thinking...<eos> Suppose I ask you...<eos> Well, I guess it doesn't make much difference anyway.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, they told me...<eos> You know, how come you guys don't believe in God?<eos> You listening?<eos> No God?<eos> Why don't you...
And thanks.<eos> Lieutenant Price, 23rd Squad.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - Here, I'll show you.<eos> The top floor, last window on the right.<eos> - Did you cover the front?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Did you evacuate the top floor?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Do it now.
And you?<eos> - No.<eos> - sure that it's no?<eos> What a beautiful house! Like it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't thinkthat we'll do anything.<eos> Look, that's where I live.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - I don't...
- It's your dirty work I been doing since.<eos> - It's a living isn't it?<eos> - He's right, Nancy, a living is a living.<eos> Get to bed, I said!<eos> All this violence, all these scenes, screams, dramas!<eos> I'm asking you, is it necessary?<eos> Not yet, Fagin.<eos> But if this godforsaken little good-for-nothing's uttered one word...<eos> If he has, the little devil we sit down, talk it over, we think it out, we decide a safe action, we stay calm.<eos> Do we?
- Are you a doctor?<eos> - Yes. He's an actor.<eos> We're very popular with actors.<eos> Have I seen you in anything?<eos> I did Hamlet a while back, didn't I?
Sam feels Pat Boone's wrong for the part.<eos> - You want those dailies, Mr Smith?<eos> - In a minute.<eos> - You were late.<eos> - Somebody kept me up till four.<eos> - Anyone I know?<eos> - How did you like it?<eos> - I liked it.<eos> - You did?<eos> I didn't, but thanks.
- Howard Hawks directed this.<eos> - I know. Here.<eos> Thanks to him, it was my first really important part.<eos> - Have you seen Jenny?<eos> - I'm supposed to call her.<eos> - Why didn't you?<eos> - Shh.<eos> Well?<eos> He really knows how to tell a story.<eos> Indeed he does.
Is it dangerous?<eos> It shouldn't be. If anyone shoots, you're on your own. Quit, run, do what you want.<eos> Money.<eos> What's in it for me?<eos> Fifty thousand.<eos> Maybe more.<eos> But fifty, anyhow.<eos> In monthly instalments, so no quick spending.<eos> - How do I know I'll get...<eos> - You don't.
- No.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Do you like it?<eos> - Of course, just like you.<eos> Come on, stop it. Then babies show up...<eos> What can I do?<eos> That's why I'm married to her.<eos> That's his business.<eos> Want some, Luc√≠a?<eos> Do you?
I've managed to obtain permission for you and your wife to visit the institute.<eos> Oh, that's very nice. We'd like that.<eos> Unfortunately, my wife isn't here at the moment.<eos> She's visiting the National Art Gallery.<eos> Oh, I'm very sorry to hear that.<eos> But I hope at least you'll be able to come?<eos> Are you certain it's allowed?<eos> Oh, yes, I've been able to obtain the necessary clearances.<eos> - I thought you wanted to do this.<eos> - Yes, of course we do.
Wait in the car.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I told you, our people, we're following up a lead.<eos> They have something?<eos> With me dead, how would you ever expect to get the other half of the plan?<eos> Did you really think I'd be stupid?<eos> Stupid enough to trust you?<eos> Well, I can't blame you for trying. But I can make sure that it will never happen again.<eos> Assuming you still want the plans.<eos> Oh, yes. I do.
Give me that boot.<eos> You've had TB and were forced to give up your job.<eos> You have a cousin called Heidi who works in Zum Wilden Hirsch.<eos> I¬ùs because of her that you got the job.<eos> - Where are my identity papers?<eos> - In that case... with your travel permit.<eos> Heidi will give you the rest later.<eos> It must have taken time to prepare these things.<eos> Very likely.<eos> Our forgery department did a special job on your papers.
I can't get through to him.<eos> I can't reach him either, Mac.<eos> Glad you dropped by.<eos> I want you to meet some cute little...<eos> Never mind.<eos> I'm paying the girls double time.<eos> You know what it costs...<eos> - to double-time all of them? - Yeah.<eos> Get in.<eos> You do?
Well, ain't this nice?<eos> I was wondering how I was gonna get you back, and here you deliver yourself.<eos> Who's your friend with the ears, Kirk?<eos> I think you've got it reversed, Mr. Krako.<eos> I ain't, pally.<eos> Put down your heaters.<eos> I believe that perhaps it would be wise to do as he says.<eos> I just heard the sound of...<eos> The sound of a machine-gun bolt being pulled back.<eos> Mr. Krako, I don't...
Not with the Earps.<eos> There is one other place I can try.<eos> You looking for somebody?<eos> Yes, sheriff.<eos> - I want you to stop the fight.<eos> - Stop it?<eos> Who wants to stop it?<eos> I sure don't.<eos> You don't.<eos> - You didn't yesterday.
Oh, no, no, you must give my stick, though I can't work without it.<eos> (CHUCKLES) Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, let's see what's on next on the list. Ah.<eos> "Feed the nursery animals." That's done, thank heaven. Next, uh, "oil Myrtle?"<eos> Oil?<eos> What in the devil is Myrtle?<eos> Do you know who Myrtle is, Toto?<eos> - (CHITTERING)<eos> - You do?
Why am I your prisoner?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's the men's business.<eos> Chingachgook will take all your scalps.<eos> You say women and children are there.<eos> They're vulnerable. Not bad business at all.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> There are premiums for scalps.<eos> They pay serious money.<eos> The scoundrels do fine.
It's an old Stanislavski test of acting ability. I want to make sure he's right for the part.<eos> I'll just help myself.<eos> Bottoms up.<eos> Did you see that?<eos> This man has the makings of a star!<eos> Thank you, Major.<eos> Commandant. See you at the show tonight.<eos> A little eccentric, but thoroughly cowed, sir, thoroughly.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> So, we do something once again, nice for you, eh?
General Burkhalter will have a conference with Captain Berger and myself, understood?<eos> Understood, Herr Kommandant.<eos> Out!<eos> Out! Out...!<eos> Get out of my sight...<eos> Right.<eos> Now, uh, before we start, uh, shall we have a little refreshment, Herr General?<eos> I don't want anything. Neither does Berger.<eos> Well, I'll just have a little...<eos> Neither do you.
- Well if you're not head of the committee during General Peterson's party there's going to be a hurricane, a tidal wave and a typhoon.<eos> - Jeannie.<eos> Jeannie did that?<eos> - Not so loud.<eos> Don't get her mad now.<eos> Why would she make you do that?<eos> How would it look if some other master got the job?<eos> All you have to do is get an entertainer.<eos> Oh, sure. I don't know anybody in the entertainment field.<eos> - Yeah, but Jeannie does.
184.<eos> 185.<eos> 197.<eos> 198...<eos> So tired.<eos> Laetitia!<eos> What brings you here?<eos> How about your personal exhibition?<eos> You didn't come.<eos> We did.
Jealousy really takes it out of you, doesn't it?<eos> Think things over before you decide on your next wish.<eos> Don't rush into it.<eos> Have a bit of kip.<eos> Things'll seem clearer in the morning.<eos> You can use my bed if you like.<eos> Slip into this.<eos> Where will you sleep then?<eos> Oh, don't worry about me.<eos> I never do.
I've got me hundred billion.<eos> Oh, congratulations.<eos> Look, what went wrong?<eos> I blew my raspberry hundreds of times, and nothing happened.<eos> I still got one more wish to go, you know.<eos> How'd you figure that out?<eos> I was the intellectual, I was Sir Stanley Moon, the businessman... I was the fly, the pop singer, the student, and this one makes six.<eos> What about the Frobisher and Gleason raspberry-flavored ice lolly?<eos> - That didn't count!<eos> - Of course it did.
You was boring the hell out of all of us.<eos> I'm leaving the place to John.<eos> That's good.<eos> He earned it.<eos> Ain't nothing to do with it.<eos> I just never give John... the kind of, you know, feeling that I give you.<eos> So, I'm going to pay him back now.<eos> Don't feel you have to say anything.<eos> The way it is, you see... sometimes you just have a feeling for a child... or else you don't.<eos> With John, I just didn't.
Do you want me to call the Captain?<eos> Oh, but really.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Ooh! Ooh! Oh, dear!<eos> You'll get off this boat if I...<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's Crawford, sir.<eos> Come in, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Please be seated.<eos> - How do you do?
Look here, what are you doing?<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Now, listen, I¬¥m old enough to be your...<eos> I¬¥m still your boss, my girl.<eos> If you do that again, I¬¥m telling His Excellency.<eos> - Forget your precious Excellency a minute.<eos> - Shagal!<eos> What?<eos> Who spoke?<eos> I did!
Well...<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> Will you take me home?<eos> My husband took the car.<eos> Will you drive me home?<eos> Here... you take it.<eos> You know how to work a foreign shift?<eos> You don't?
- This date was my parents' idea. They forced me into it.<eos> That's very nice of you to tell me.<eos> - No, I mean I'm not really like this.<eos> I hate myself like this.<eos> Could you just stop crying?<eos> - No, I couldn't.<eos> But could you try?<eos> - No.<eos> Since I graduated, I feel like I have to always be rude. Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do.
Good evening, sir.<eos> - Come on, we're leaving.<eos> Mr. Gladstone, how are you?<eos> What's happening?<eos> - They must think that I'm Gladstone.<eos> Hello, Mr. Braniff.<eos> Elaine, I like you.<eos> I like you so much.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Do you?
- The Reverend Martin Luther King?<eos> - Oh, Tillie.<eos> You're so close.<eos> Monsignor Ryan.<eos> Bake a second pie.<eos> He loves your cooking.<eos> Is the big guest room in order?<eos> Dr. Prentice wants to have a shower.<eos> - He does?<eos> - He does.
All you have to do is tell them you're against them. That's all.<eos> And you'll have no problem.<eos> You're not telling me you're happy about this?<eos> This is not a night for talking about happiness.<eos> This is an unhappy night.<eos> You talked to Christina.<eos> I know how she feels.<eos> Can you imagine for one minute that I want to see them hurt?<eos> No.<eos> No more than my husband does.
And the company does nothing?<eos> Friend.<eos> This business is between you and me... and we don't want anybody else poking their nose in, do we?<eos> You wearing a gun?<eos> You better get one.<eos> You can't threaten a man.<eos> There are witnesses here.<eos> - They heard you call me a dirty name.<eos> - I didn't call you anything.<eos> And even if they didn't, I did.
But if he were just having fun, would you know?<eos> Jeff doesn't play around. It'd be all or nothing!<eos> It's a pity that such an attractive man should shut himself away.<eos> It makes you wonder what he's running away from.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> A man like that would need a pretty good reason for coming to live in a place like this.<eos> It's obvious he's running away from something.<eos> And it's obvious you don't know him or you wouldn't talk such nonsense!<eos> Oh, but I do.
I've something to show you.<eos> I thought you were taking the day off.<eos> No, I was having these made. I'm sorry, I'm due at the excavation.<eos> Please read these first.<eos> - Photocopies.<eos> - From old newspaper files.<eos> "May 19th, 1927.<eos> "Hob's Lane spook.<eos> Figure that walked through a bedroom wall. "<eos> Why did you do this?
See you tomorrow.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> I think there's something funny going on in there.<eos> I'd like to know what.<eos> Why didn't you do your homework?<eos> -Didn't know how.<eos> -Look at me when I talk to you.<eos> You didn't know how or you didn't want to?<eos> -I didn't want to.<eos> -You didn't?
I'm not in love with Mike.<eos> - Wonderful, thank you.<eos> Better wait a bit before he tried to pick it up. - The fur, yeah.<eos> - Well, that's what you wanted.<eos> Yes, then.<eos> I didn't realize.<eos> What? You didn't realize what?<eos> I didn't realize it would be like this.<eos> I don't understand. What do you mean?<eos> You do, Marcus.
How's love gonna stand up to that?<eos> It's supposed to, isn't it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come closer with you than I ever will, with anybody.<eos> I seen what it was meant to be like.<eos> But... it's too late, Cath.<eos> Too late for me.<eos> I ain't a good gamble for you.<eos> I wish luck to you, though.<eos> I surely do that.
Otto, forgive this intrusion.<eos> It is a matter of grave urgency.<eos> We have discovered your wife is a traitor.<eos> She has been working against us.<eos> She is still a member of the Social Democrat Party.<eos> She has contributed funds and written articles against us.<eos> Do you deny this, Frau Kelmann?<eos> I do not.<eos> Do you deny calling me a beast and a madman?<eos> - Do you?
I represent a group of men who want to buy some stock of yours.<eos> - Like Swiss Sud-Aero?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> And they're willing to take everything you've got.<eos> - Either they're crazy or you are.<eos> - Why do you say that?<eos> I've got a cheque right here for $80 million.<eos> Look, mister, that stock is not for sale.<eos> And I've got a feeling that your group should know about that.<eos> If they don't, they do now.
Administer it, please.<eos> Should we wait until after the funeral?<eos> And leave Svardia without a Prime Minister?<eos> No.<eos> Administer it, please.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> "Do you, Milos Pavel, swear to defend the Republic of Svardia<eos> "against all her enemies<eos> "and to uphold the Constitution as long as you are Prime Minister?"<eos> I do.
If I should leave it, I'll cease to exist.<eos> I must return, as you must consume matter to maintain your life.<eos> You gave up everything to be human?<eos> But even if you stay here, you'll eventually die.<eos> The joy of this hour. I am pleased.<eos> I can't just fly away and leave you here.<eos> You must be free.<eos> You saved my life, took care of me.<eos> You loved me. I never understood.<eos> I do now.
My interest is scientific.<eos> Men of... That is the world of the past.<eos> I'm sure you understand, actually to talk to a man of your century...<eos> There.<eos> Simple.<eos> Soft.<eos> Please remember.<eos> Perhaps some other time when you feel more like talking about the past.<eos> I'm glad you came.<eos> Please do it again.
- Oh, you please me, very much.<eos> Oh, I am glad.<eos> On Haji's birthday, you wished to get rid of me.<eos> Well, I know that, I'm sorry, but-<eos> Well, when you cause one of your disasters it makes me a little nervous.<eos> I really couldn't get along without you.<eos> You will never have to get along without me.<eos> Good, good. I like things just the way they are:<eos> Quiet and peaceful, you know.<eos> - Do you, master? - Of course I do. Don't you?
Go ahead, kill me.<eos> One thrust through the heart, I beg you.<eos> Otsuya...<eos> You... you stabbed me.<eos> I didn't stab you.<eos> The spider on my back did.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I don't want to die, I need to live.<eos> I must deceive all those bastards and make them pay.<eos> You did it again.
Isn't that wonderful?<eos> What's so wonderful?<eos> It ain't your money.<eos> I like to think of them doing well.<eos> It keeps me busy.<eos> It's time you started that fiddle, playing the piano on the till.<eos> Alfie, I couldn't.<eos> That's the only till in London that ain't bent.<eos> Luigi and his wife treat me like family.<eos> All the more reason to do 'em.
I have to sort out firewood, and the logs are ice-cold.<eos> Why do you keep the torch on?<eos> It's morning already.<eos> Did you feed my dog?<eos> You didn't ask me to, did you?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Go...<eos> Have you forgotten something?<eos> I came to say goodbye.<eos> You already did.
Hey, everybody, look.<eos> He's giving him the filthy money.<eos> Judas.<eos> You sold my hide.<eos> But you won't enjoy that money, not a penny.<eos> If there's justice in the world, that money will go to the undertaker.<eos> You know who you are?<eos> Want to know whose son you are?<eos> You don't. I do.<eos> Everybody does.
You have private quarters here?<eos> Of course, Your Highness.<eos> You are my personal guest.<eos> But you are not mine.<eos> You will move your things out immediately and move Colonel Hogan in.<eos> Yes, Your Highness.<eos> Schultz!<eos> Schultz, not the big things, just the small things, and throw out all of Klink's paintings-- they're terrible.<eos> You remember the night of the Notre Dame game?<eos> Oh, ho, do I... and the house detective at the Plaza Hotel?
Saura said, "Two palanquins will leave.<eos> Our man will be in the second one." - Who's in the first one?<eos> - Lord Takahashi.<eos> Takahashi?<eos> The foremost lancer in Japan.<eos> Who's afraid?<eos> Let's kill both of them!<eos> No, we're after Kiyokawa alone.<eos> We'll follow them. When they part, we'll attack Kiyokawa.<eos> And if they don't?
Uh-huh. Good.<eos> Good. Montag might be hearing some exciting news in a day or two.<eos> Benedict won't be with us very much longer...<eos> - and Montag's name has been mentioned.<eos> - Promotion, sir?<eos> I trust that the thought makes Montag happy.<eos> I think we're neighbours.<eos> I live near block 813.<eos> - Isn't that where you live?<eos> - Yes, I do.
If you will excuse me...<eos> Dr Franklyn, how did you know my name?<eos> My husband and I only arrived here a few hours ago.<eos> Although I am not active in the life of the village, I know what goes on.<eos> Did you know my husbands brother, Charles Spalding?<eos> No. No, I did not.<eos> - He died a few weeks ago.<eos> - I am aware of that.<eos> Do you happen to know what he died of, Doctor?<eos> - I do not.
There's always that.<eos> Chris.<eos> No matter what happens, we will never forget you, and the others.<eos> That's all a man can ask.<eos> If you ask me, we oughta stayed on back there and given them women a hand.<eos> They're gonna fall behind in their planting' and ploughing'.<eos> So will you, Colbee. So will you.<eos> How come you're still along, Luis?<eos> Thought once you got clear of that firing squad, you'd head for the hills.<eos> So did I.
As long as he can't prove anything, there's nothing to worry about.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't know about that. Dr. Bellows is no idiot.<eos> Dr. Bellows is<eos> - We were just talking about you, sir.<eos> I'll bet you were. And I was just talking about you.<eos> We're putting on a little show for the personnel at the base Saturday.<eos> A show. I love shows, sir.<eos> General Peterson thought you might help to entertain.<eos> Me?<eos> Well, I don't really do anything, sir.
I want you to know I don't believe a word of this, Tony.<eos> But since Dr. Bellows is making an issue of it it's my duty to get to the bottom of it.<eos> I understand, sir, and there's no point in waiting for Mr. Millay any longer.<eos> I may as well tell you that, well, this painting-<eos> Monsieur Millay!<eos> You must be Dr. Bellows.<eos> Yes. How kind of you to come all this way.<eos> As you Americans say, the wild horses could not keep me away.<eos> - This is General Peterson.<eos> - How do you do?
Isn't that so?<eos> Without consulting me?<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Everything go well?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's needed at the plant. She'll be back.<eos> Know what you've become, Blondie? A tightrope walker.<eos> - Did you miss me? - Why do you ask?<eos> - So you didn't.
But he knows where to catch it again. In Missouri.<eos> Are you in?<eos> I don't do partnerships anymore.<eos> Our Great Mother Bear, speak and be angry with your sons no more.<eos> Your mountain is in the middle of our world, sacred it is.<eos> We returned to you, your fields took us back, we shall stay.<eos> You shall kill the one who leaves you.<eos> Tokei-Ihto?<eos> Your drum has called me.<eos> The spirits did this.
- You've become a tramp, my dear.<eos> - Ah, Fred...<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Freddy pays today.<eos> To Upper Missouri.<eos> Missouri.<eos> Hey, Tokei-Ihto!<eos> - Will you surrender?<eos> - No! You're all dead men if I want.<eos> But I don't.
Nothing yet but usually he reports daily.<eos> I'll check the Emberday Hall myself.<eos> - What is this Emberday Hall anyway?<eos> Well, the usual: Castle and home of the noble Emberdays.<eos> For over a year now there is a weird order of nuns living in the abbey.<eos> Unconventional idea, renting it to nuns.<eos> - I know, you are interested in the weird stuff, bizarre things.<eos> Unforunately your interests... didn't result in real success, my friend.<eos> - But one day I will write a thrilling krimi, Sir.<eos> - Yes, indeed, do it.
Truth and illusion.<eos> You don't know the difference.<eos> No, but we must carry on as though we did.<eos> Amen.<eos> Snap went the dragons.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Skip it.<eos> I said snap went the dragons!<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> Don't!
I'm very interested in why.<eos> Sit down, mister.<eos> I agree.<eos> Attack.<eos> Are you suggesting we fight to prevent a fight?<eos> Based on what?<eos> Memories of a war over a century ago?<eos> On theories about a people we've never even met face to face?<eos> We know what they look like.<eos> Yes, indeed we do, Mr. Stiles.
- Well, he isn't like Captain Ramart.<eos> - Oh, no. Captain Kirk is one of a kind, Charlie.<eos> Do you like me?<eos> Why not?<eos> Some...<eos> The other ship. They didn't like me.<eos> I tried.<eos> I'm trying to make people like me.<eos> - I want them to like me.<eos> - Most 17-year-olds do.
How about, "This is most irregular, but he may take the stand"?<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> This is most irregular, but he may take the stand.<eos> Now, wait a minute, Stan.<eos> This is ridiculous!<eos> You don't even know how to conduct...<eos> I could have got you off from 20 years to life, but this way you're gonna wind up in the electric chair!<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
- How are you?<eos> - Good.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> With lads.<eos> - Our lads or Magyars?<eos> - Where can you find Magyars?<eos> Magyars were here on Holy Night, and the whole village...<eos> Oh, we drank and made merry, and sang kolyadkas with lads.<eos> Did you see Ivan standing there?<eos> - Sure I did.
- Hi5 key!<eos> - And a beer.<eos> - And a beer!<eos> And me?<eos> Will you hurry up and commit suicide?<eos> We need your room for our cousin from the South.<eos> You're from the Outer Countries, aren't you?<eos> Why did he ask if you were going to commit suicide?<eos> Quite a few...<eos> Quite a few people... do it.
You're putting on the red wig.<eos> I like the blond one better.<eos> Teresina, I'll decide what wig I want to wear.<eos> Pardon me, signora.<eos> I just love blond hair.<eos> But that one looks good too. What shoes do you want to wear?<eos> I've already got them on, Teresina.<eos> I wanted to give you a present.<eos> It doesn't matter. Some other time. This one looks very nice.<eos> No, it doesn't!
- Making your own bed?<eos> My, what a grown-up boy you are, Master Joey.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Nanny was just going to unpack for you.<eos> - I'll do it.<eos> - But, Joey...<eos> Of course he will, madam.<eos> He doesn't need his old nanny any more.<eos> - Do you, Master Joey?<eos> - No, I don't.
Come on.<eos> The bottle was under your pillow.<eos> - She put it there.<eos> - Honest?<eos> - Cross my heart and hope to die.<eos> - You probably will. They'll hang you.<eos> Your dad's the same as all the others.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - He doesn't believe me either.<eos> They never do.
Maria... .<eos> -There isn't going to be any baroness.<eos> -There isn't?<eos> No.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Well, we've called off our engagement, you see, and--<eos> -Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> -Yes.<eos> You are?<eos> -You did?
You love Father very much.<eos> I can tell you do.<eos> Very much.<eos> Mother, what do you do when you think you love someone?<eos> I mean, when you stop loving someone or he stops loving you?<eos> Well, you cry a little.<eos> Then you wait for the sun to come out.<eos> It always does.<eos> There are so many things I think I should know but I don't.<eos> -I really don't.
Hey, that's a hard job. Ja. If they ever find out that she is a woman, they'll fire her.<eos> Now I have to check the beds.<eos> Have more strudel.<eos> Danke. Good night.<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait. I have to check the beds.<eos> Everybody is here.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I counted them myself.<eos> Why do it twice?
One day I'm going to get to the bottom of it.<eos> And do you know something, captain?<eos> That's going to be the happiest day of my life.<eos> - But would you mind in the future, please, drive the old-fashioned way?<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, young lady.<eos> Dr. Bellows is a very suspicious man, is he not?<eos> He has good reason for being suspicious.<eos> Who said you could take the car and drive without me?<eos> - Well, you did, master.
He is a most eager buyer.<eos> Can you really take salt out of water?<eos> Oh, it is child's play.<eos> Then do it for him.<eos> Oh, he's coming.<eos> My own great-granddaughter.<eos> Bilejik?<eos> Bilejik?<eos> - Excuse me. I thought I lost you.<eos> - Oh, you did, did you?
Oh, sure you didn't.<eos> Roger.<eos> Roger, wait a minute.<eos> I can straighten everything out.<eos> Anything wrong, captain?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - You're not nervous about all this?<eos> Oh, well, a little.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> No, I don't.
A screen test.<eos> One screen test coming right up.<eos> -What can you do?<eos> -Do?<eos> I can disappear.<eos> She can disappear.<eos> But not before I get your name and phone number, sweetie.<eos> Well, I can make myself into smoke.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> Everybody does that.
General.<eos> - Captain.<eos> - Captain.<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> Jeannie?<eos> Well, hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought by this time you'd be on your honeymoon.<eos> So did I.
Keep pulling, Pop.<eos> I do believe I have something.<eos> Boy, that's the neatest-looking fish I ever saw.<eos> Mm. A-And it seems to be cooked.<eos> I guess they have a lot of hot springs around here.<eos> Cast the line again, Dad.<eos> Over that way.<eos> All right, Lily. We're ready to eat.<eos> - Did you catch three more fish?<eos> - No, we did better than that.
Oh, boy, that's the oldest-looking teenager I ever saw.<eos> That's Eddie and his dad.<eos> Oh. From the looks of his dad's face, he's been in some very bad smashups.<eos> Let that be a lesson to you, son.<eos> No one should ever go out on the strip without a roll bar.<eos> Hi, Eddie.<eos> Oh, hi, Sandy.<eos> Hey, Pop, I want you to meet Sandy Baylor and his father.<eos> Hi, Sandy.<eos> And how do you do, Mr. Baylor?
I was walking along the street today...<eos> Grandpa, would you slice me another piece of meat?<eos> Certainly.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It just so happens that today... I saved a boy's life.<eos> Mm, that's fine.<eos> Oh, Grandpa, you're not eating.<eos> Well, doesn't anyone want to hear about my heroic deed?<eos> All right, Herman.<eos> What did you do?
Where's your husband working now, ma'am?<eos> At a radio observatory in Medicina.<eos> Did you come to offer him a job?<eos> One that pays very well.<eos> Where?<eos> If it's far away, I'd prefer things stay as they are.<eos> It might not be for long.<eos> Once he went away for a family funeral, and I thought I'd go crazy from fear.<eos> If you like, you could join him later.<eos> Does your wife do that?
She took the fruits of my advice, and he, repulsed, a short tale to make, fell into a sadness, then into a fast, thence to a watch, thence into a weakness, thence to a lightness, and, by this declension, into the madness.<eos> Do you think 'tis this?<eos> It may be.<eos> Take this from this, if this be otherwise.<eos> - How may we try it further?<eos> - You know, sometimes he walks four hours together here.<eos> At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him. Be you and I behind an arras.<eos> I'll board him presently.<eos> O, give me leave.<eos> How does my good lord Hamlet?
I want to kill him!<eos> - Kill who?<eos> - Goldfinger.<eos> I want him alive.<eos> I want him dead.<eos> He killed my sister.<eos> T.M. Tilly Masterson.<eos> I knew your sister, Jill.<eos> I know what he did to her in Miami.<eos> No, you don't.
I would like to help you if I can.<eos> Does Namaroff know you're here?<eos> He'd be very angry if he did.<eos> Oh, please believe me I only came here to see if I can help you.<eos> This afternoon, you spoke to Dr. Namaroff?<eos> - You spoke about Megaera. - Yes.<eos> Did Dr. Namaroff tell you that the spirit of Megaera roams this forest and it has also been known to enter this house?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> For the reason that he doesn't believe or says he doesn't.<eos> - But you do.
It was just that your request startled me for a moment but no doubt you have a very good reason.<eos> Now, let me see.<eos> You wish to inspect the photographs and records...<eos> Of all the women aliens registered here within the last 10 years.<eos> Well, I'll go and get the files.<eos> Visitors to Vandorf are only required to register if they wish later to become citizens.<eos> This is, of course, a very democratic state.<eos> That's a lovely girl, professor.<eos> This look like her?<eos> - It hardly does her justice, but...
Where has she gone?<eos> In about an hour's time, there's a train for Leipzig.<eos> She will be on it.<eos> You arranged for somewhere for her to stay in Leipzig, Paul?<eos> She will be at the Hotel Kramer.<eos> And you will be joining her there?<eos> When we've found Megaera.<eos> You should have gone with her.<eos> I was very tempted.<eos> Well, why didn't you?
When my cousin Miriam comes, she'll know how to deal with the county commissioner.<eos> - I didn't know you were expecting her.<eos> - Well, I am.<eos> She won't make any difference as far as the bridge is concerned.<eos> - We'll wait and see.<eos> - I reckon we will.<eos> I ain't gonna take that gun away from you.<eos> I hope you aren't plannin' on usin' it again.<eos> Comin' to fetch you out is the last thing I wanna do.<eos> Then don't!
- What?<eos> Captain, I'm glad you're an early riser too.<eos> A word with you, please.<eos> Not at the moment, madam.<eos> As you can see, I'm somewhat d√©shabill√©.<eos> But, captain, this is important.<eos> Now if you don't mind.<eos> - As you like, madam, yes.<eos> - I think I mentioned to you that poor Mr. Ffolly-Hardwicke was exceedingly troubled.<eos> Yes, you did indeed.
- Or, uh, six or eight.<eos> It's so hard to keep track.<eos> You know how time flies when you're with Frank.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, Frank sort of adopted me when I was very young.<eos> And we've been very good friends ever since.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> Mrs. Broderick, does he come home to you every night?<eos> Well, I really don't know.<eos> You don't?
We don't want Guellen to die.<eos> You will never succeed.<eos> Not here in Guellen.<eos> Why not in Guellen?<eos> Why should it be better than any other place in the whole world?<eos> I don't know about other places, Karla, but... it was here in Guellen that Brahms composed a quartet.<eos> - We're listening to it now.<eos> Or don't you recognize it?<eos> - Oh yes.<eos> Yes, I do now.
Don't tell me this is it.<eos> Well, the place where we rented the car said this was the street.<eos> There's the number: 1313.<eos> House Beautiful it ain't.<eos> I've seen direct hits that looked better than this.<eos> Let's go see if Ma and Pa Kettle are home.<eos> [Door Knocker Banging] Hey, Chip, let's call the home office.<eos> Something's wrong here.<eos> I don't see anything very average about this.<eos> Neither do I. Miss Munster?
Uncle Herman?<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Down through history this only happened once before in our family... when Grandpa overdrew his account at the blood bank.<eos> Did Uncle Herman say anything about this?<eos> Oh, no. He's too proud.<eos> Why, if he found out that we knew he was broke, he'd never be able to look himself in the face again.<eos> Well, maybe Grandpa could help us out.<eos> He's very well off. He was. He was.<eos> But you know the expression "You can't take it with you"?<eos> Well, Grandpa did.
Not at all.<eos> Back in the Old Country the woods are full of them.<eos> I don't want my husband to know that I'm working.<eos> Yes. Of course.<eos> - Age?<eos> - 137.<eos> No, no. Not your weight.<eos> Your age. That is my age.<eos> Uh, what, uh... What kind of wor... uh... work have you done before?<eos> Well, during the war, I did some volunteer work.
But, Mrs. Munster, l-I am with the Reliable Oil Company, and I can match or better any deal you may have been offered by the competition.<eos> I am sure you're what you say, but I'm sorry.<eos> He just hasn't got the time to see you.<eos> Today is one of those days when just everything seems to go wrong.<eos> If you'd only give me a chance.<eos> I just keep telling you, young man...<eos> Is this...<eos> Is this S-S-Spot?<eos> Good heavens, no. Spot's an animal. This is my husband.<eos> Uh, how do you do?
This is the key of my safe in Caracas where I have much money too.<eos> I'm not sure we'll have to go there, only if it turns bad.<eos> You have always prepared for this quick leaving?<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> But Europe is not safe anymore.<eos> A war may happen, a revolution... Communism...<eos> Of course, there is Switzerland but...<eos> They extradite.<eos> And in Venezuela?<eos> They don't!
No, don't go.<eos> I feel as if I don't understand you at all, and I want so much to understand.<eos> Why, Mrs. Brenner?<eos> Because my son seems to be very fond of you, and I don't quite know how I feel about it.<eos> I don't even know if I like you or not.<eos> Is that so important, your liking me?<eos> Well, yes. I think so.<eos> Mitch is important to me.<eos> I want to like whatever girl he chooses.<eos> And perhaps if you don't?
There won't be any.<eos> There's no connection.<eos> There is.<eos> Be patient.<eos> I am patient.<eos> I've done nothing but wait.<eos> All my life.<eos> Waiting... for something to happen.<eos> What, I don't know.<eos> Now you do.
She's dying and we're up here.<eos> She'd like us with her when she goes.<eos> Otherwise, she won't go.<eos> - She'll go.<eos> - Sir, they forced their way in here.<eos> No, we didn't.<eos> Let me introduce myself.<eos> I'm Dingy Bell.<eos> This is Benjy Benjamin.<eos> - How do you do?
Davey.<eos> It's always, "Let the Indian do it."<eos> Will you go out in the store and help the ladies? All right.<eos> I'm also bookkeeper, part-time clerk.<eos> Always, "Let the Indian do it."<eos> A lady brought that out here this morning, asked for it to be taken out to the home ranch for you.<eos> Handsome lady. Kind of tall, with red hair.<eos> Called me Mr Birnbaum, just as if she'd never seen me before, and as if that veil that covered her face would keep me from recognising her.<eos> I thought she was in New York or Europe, or someplace.<eos> So did I.
Dev, what're you doing?<eos> I just thought I'd get another cigar.<eos> You've got one in your mouth, and two burning in the tray.<eos> And that move.<eos> The fellows want me to play all the time.<eos> You're cuter than a baby steer<eos> And softer than a mouse's ear<eos> I want the whole wide world to hear<eos> You're just right for me<eos> Not that rhythm, Junior, do it the way they do it at the Plaza.
Oh. Not in bed yet, Miss Marple?<eos> I'm just choosing something to read before retiring.<eos> - Good night. - Good night.<eos> If you're looking for Miss Marple, she's downstairs in the lounge.<eos> I'm sorry to have startled you. That's all right.<eos> I'm still a little nervous, I suppose.<eos> Yes, well, under the circumstances, I'm not surprised.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, if I was the murderer, I'd be very worried in case you heard what Old Enderby said to Cora when he called.<eos> But I didn't.
-Œ§hree years.<eos> Œ§hree years wiŒôŒô fŒôy by.<eos> Let's taŒôk about it Œôater.<eos> -But how couŒôd Œô?<eos> -Circumstances got in the way.<eos> -We couŒôdn't do anything about it.<eos> -But you beŒôieved her.<eos> Why? Nothing surprised me about you then.<eos> -But you beŒôieved her.<eos> -Œô did and Œô didn't.
- Yes.<eos> - Jim.<eos> - He was my friend.<eos> - You've got to get away.<eos> But you saw what happened.<eos> They won't believe me, not after the operation.<eos> They'll think you're insane.<eos> Insane?<eos> Insane?<eos> Diane, do you...
We've already decided everything.<eos> We're getting married and I'm flying with him.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> DAY THREE<eos> Just look at the bride.<eos> What a charming creature.<eos> She's not a creature, she's a physicist.<eos> Too good to be true.<eos> - Do physicists come like that?<eos> - No, they don't.
Did you hear us arguing?<eos> - No, I was working.<eos> I can't stand him any longer.<eos> I'm going mad.<eos> Anyway, he's leaving tomorrow.<eos> Good riddance.<eos> Don't be unfair.<eos> You know he loves you.<eos> I don't know anymore.<eos> I really don't.
You find peace amusing?<eos> It's just that Stan's on the Indian Affairs subcommittee, isn't it, Stan?<eos> I'll be with you in a minute.<eos> Fred, what do those guys do besides strew roses in your path?<eos> Just my brain trust.<eos> You can't hold a senator's job by kissing babies... and shaking hands, you know.<eos> Bob...<eos> The hearing will go to a subcommittee, right?<eos> I haven't any word from Tom August yet. I don't know his plan.<eos> Well, if it does...
I say, if it does, I don't wanna push...<eos> Whoever's made subcommittee chair should be pro-Leffingwell, right?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Well, I've done my share of the hack work.<eos> I ought to be in line for a spot like this.<eos> Fred, right now I'm just trying to get the situation in hand.<eos> I know, but I wanted to get my bid in early.<eos> I've gotta fly to New York for the afternoon and meet my eastern group.<eos> - Suppose I call you later on?<eos> - Yeah. Do that.
This hearing of the subcommittee of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee... is being held to consider the president's nomination of Robert A. Leffingwell... for secretary of state.<eos> Mr. Leffingwell, I'm sure you know all the members of the committee here.<eos> Senator Cooley is not a member of the subcommittee... but the full committee voted him permission to join us... for the purposes of cross-examination.<eos> I welcome Senator Cooley's participation, Mr. Chairman.<eos> If not wholeheartedly, certainly without fear.<eos> I commend your courage.<eos> Frankly, the senator scares the wits out of everybody else.<eos> Would you please stand and raise your right hand?<eos> Do you swear that the statements you are about to give this committee... will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - Yes, sir, I do.
- Lisa.<eos> I don't. You'll just have to believe me.<eos> We dated a few times, that's all.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> A week ago Saturday.<eos> He picked me up at work.<eos> We had dinner and went to a movie.<eos> - You haven't heard from him since?<eos> - No.<eos> Sometimes I don't for a month or so.
Frank, turn that thing off.<eos> Four thousand ships loaded for bear. Troops ready to go. Eleven thousand planes on the line.<eos> God only knows how many gliders. Norm, relax.<eos> RAF says the gale can stop as suddenly as it began.<eos> So they told us yesterday and the day before.<eos> Look, Norm.<eos> We're all of us just as dedicated to this thing as you are, just as anxious to get going.<eos> And that includes Ike.<eos> Now if he calls it off again, he knows what he's doing.<eos> Of course he does.
That's not true.<eos> Have you lived here long?<eos> I've never seen you. Not long.<eos> Where did you live before?<eos> In Guidonia.<eos> His mother's the brunette with the new stall near yours.<eos> Signora Roma?<eos> Such a good-looking woman. I know her.<eos> You work with her?<eos> No, I don't.
Hi, kid.<eos> Who killed...<eos> Jocie, Ben?<eos> Tell me. I...<eos> I've got to know.<eos> How about passing the time by playing a little solitaire?<eos> All right, now let's start unlocking a few doors.<eos> Let's begin with the patrol.<eos> You didn't save our lives and take out an enemy company, or anything like that.<eos> - Did you, Raymond?
Now, since I had him in conversation at the precise moment the shot was fired, I can state without reservation that he was neither a party to the struggle, nor the shooting.<eos> May I ask, Inspector, how it happened that you were talking with Mr. Gridley on the telephone at 11:00 p.m.?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The day after he moved into Mrs. Hardwicke's house, Mr. Gridley, at my request, and with the kind cooperation of Mr. Franklyn Ambruster of the American Embassy, started acting as undercover agent for Scotland Yard.<eos> Might I say something, please?<eos> Madam, we are trying to conduct a proper inquest.<eos> I have something to tell the court.<eos> Well, ask her to step this way.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that the evidence you give before this court shall be the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- Where's that?<eos> - Lyons. Do you mind?<eos> No, it's on my way.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I'm an actress, I'm playing Roxane.<eos> Roxane?<eos> Cyrano de Bergerac's girlfriend.<eos> You can't play it alone.<eos> No, but I had a fight with my boyfriend.<eos> He does Cyrano in the play.
Atticus had promised me he would wear me out... ifhe ever heard ofme fighting' anymore.<eos> I was far too old and too big for such childish things.<eos> And the sooner I learned to holding... the better off everybody would be.<eos> I soon forgot.<eos> Cecil Jacobs made me forget.<eos> What is it?<eos> Atticus, do you defend niggers?<eos> - Don't say "nigger."<eos> - I didn't say it.<eos> Cecil Jacobs did.
Yes, sir.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Walkin' like an Egyptian.<eos> We were studyin' about 'em in school.<eos> Teacher says we wouldn't be no place without 'em.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Cradle ofcivilization.<eos> They invented embalming and toilet paper.<eos> That's wrong.<eos> You do your feet this way.
She had bruises on her arms.<eos> She showed me her neck.<eos> There were definite finger marks on her gullet.<eos> All around her neck, at the back of her throat?<eos> I'd say they were all around.<eos> The witness may be seated.<eos> Robert E. Lee Ewell.<eos> Place your hand on the Bible, please.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
And your fancy airs don't come to nothin'!<eos> Your "ma'am"-ing and your "Miss Mayella"-ing... it don't come to nothin', Mr Finch!<eos> You sit down now.<eos> Atticus.<eos> Mr Gilmer.<eos> The State rests,Judge.<eos> Tom Robinson, take the stand.<eos> Put your hand on the Bible.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Happy birthday!<eos> Oh, oh, excuse me! Excuse me!<eos> No, no...<eos> Well that's what's I ought to have done, naturally...<eos> What? What ought you to have done?<eos> Well after I knocked, I should've... waited for me to invite you to come in, as you did. Come in.<eos> You're not getting any funny ideas, are you?<eos> Of course not. Just because I knocked on your door...<eos> Well that's what I mean.<eos> You did, didn't you? So why don't you?
To Chinon.<eos> The angel came fiirst. I said to the king:<eos> Sire, here is your sign.<eos> Did you hold the crown in your hands?<eos> Did the angel come from up on high?<eos> Yes, he was sent by the command of God.<eos> - Did he walk through the door?<eos> - He did.<eos> Did those with the king see the angel?<eos> The archbishop and others did.
You don't know a thing about it and yet you write letters to the hospital, dozens of letters, accusing my husband of being a murderer.<eos> You're a filthy, miserable... tell me, have they... discharged your husband yet?<eos> I've been expecting it momentarily.<eos> They have not. It would take more than letter writing from a crank to make that happen.<eos> Your husband is an evil man!<eos> I will not put up with evil in any form- communists, subversives, thieves, harlots- evil, all of them, and i will not countenance evil.<eos> I will absolutely not countenance evil.<eos> You're probably unaware of it, mr. Crangle, but my husband is a very sensitive man.<eos> The people at the hospital told him to overlook the letters, forget about them, but they're killing him.<eos> Crangle, why... why do you do it?
Oh, boy. oh, what next?<eos> Wilma!<eos> Wilma, what have you done with my razor?<eos> Hey, hey, come on. Come on, wake up.<eos> Come on, will you?<eos> I'm late.<eos> Wilma- hey.<eos> Never mind the dramatics.<eos> Just tell me where you put my razor.<eos> Don't do that.
I understand completely.<eos> It's okay, stick around.<eos> Make yourself a drink.<eos> Throw me my robe and I'll make you one.<eos> You stay right where you are.<eos> You must be absolutely exhausted.<eos> I mean, it is very late and you were sound asleep and everything.<eos> I suppose you think I'm very brazen or tr√®s fou or something.<eos> I don't think you're any fouer than anybody else.<eos> Yes, you do. Everybody does.
Wonder where they are.<eos> It's usually in the cellar.<eos> I'll nip down and look.<eos> If I find it I'll shout, you turn the tap on.<eos> Turn the flaming light on!<eos> Oh, yes, but I'm not sure where they put the...<eos> Don't go, there's so few left.<eos> Where's the flaming light?<eos> The electricity doesn't seem to be connected. Someone might have told you the stairs begin immediately.<eos> Well, they didn't, did they? !

Sydney, would you get us some more coffee, please?<eos> Franklin considers it the best team in the business.<eos> I agree.<eos> He himself is ideal for the job.<eos> He's experienced and extremely capable.<eos> Don't blush, Roy.<eos> And best of all, he's lucky.<eos> Aren't you lucky?<eos> - If you say so, sir.<eos> - I do, indeed.
As I see it, we have three choices:<eos> One, we can leave her here. But she might be found.<eos> And in her case they won't need a truth drug.<eos> Two, we take her with us.<eos> But that makes things more difficult.<eos> And three...<eos> Well, that's Andrea's choice. Remember?<eos> You really want your pound of flesh.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I haven't brought you anything.<eos> I didn't know you'd be here.<eos> I didn't know either.<eos> Galicki was conscious until the end.<eos> He wanted to stay alive.<eos> We go into attack after 3am.<eos> - I know. I told everybody.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - That they could find me here.<eos> - You did it?
Hello!<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Come on.<eos> Hello.<eos> Anybody there?<eos> Let's take a look.<eos> - No, we'd better not.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Herbert, didn't Mr. Spilett say the Nautilus was sunk eight years ago off the coast of Mexico?<eos> Yeah, he did.
It has to be real.<eos> I'm not dreaming, and I'm telling the truth.<eos> Now I'm in one world, now in the other.<eos> I can't stop it!<eos> Shall we go for a swim?<eos> I'll go on my own then.<eos> I feel sleepy.<eos> I'm going to take a nap.<eos> Close the door when you leave.<eos> Don't do that!
Thank you. you can go.<eos> Quiet, please. Quiet.<eos> It's been suggested, and she's agreed.<eos> Will Mrs. Sperry come forward to testify?<eos> - She's got a lot of nerve!<eos> - We must have quiet here.<eos> Quiet!<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
He told me about Cliff's heart weeks ago.<eos> Well, Phil do you wish to make a statement? you needn't.<eos> We realize it's painful for you, but...<eos> There was nothing wrong with my son's heart.<eos> He was in perfect health.<eos> We will hear the next witness, Hank Tyler.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth...<eos> - ...so help you God?<eos> - I do.
What are you all afraid of?<eos> What are we afraid of?<eos> You want to know what we want to know.<eos> - What is the truth of this morning?<eos> - I know the truth.<eos> You stole the body.<eos> You think we might have hidden it here among us.<eos> But something else has happened.<eos> If you find him here, it will only be if he comes himself.<eos> Through that gate, as you did just now.
- Be quiet, Lefebvre. - Again, please.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Not bad.<eos> - Please, no emotion. - Yes, no emotion.<eos> - Let's start over.<eos> - Start over.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> - Thank you. - Again.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> I did it, Zi-Zig, I did it!
Manhattan island?<eos> How could it be manhattan island? Where's the skyline?<eos> Where are all the buildings?<eos> I don't know where they are, but that's new york city.<eos> One little item seems to be amiss.<eos> The passengers... yeah, i don't blame them.<eos> Well, we're over land.<eos> I don't see any... any what, janie?<eos> Any city, right?<eos> We don't either.
Why?<eos> Oh, you know, it got me in a lot of trouble in school, and i started getting these real bad headaches after- like now.<eos> Uh... could you do this again? Sure.<eos> Like right now?<eos> Yeah, but i...<eos> all right, show me.<eos> I got a headache. Come on, come on, will you?<eos> Come on, show me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now, do something to this bed.
But that's all in the past.<eos> You shouldn't be here now.<eos> I should be driving the ambulance.<eos> But that's impossible.<eos> Totally impossible.<eos> It's too long to explain.<eos> Your business is your own.<eos> I talk and talk, but I haven't thanked you for doing this.<eos> I appreciate it.<eos> Really, I do.
It suits me fine.<eos> You're even crazier than me. What a pain.<eos> I always fall for girls who aren't cut out for me.<eos> Did you notice I followed you last night?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> I'm thinking.<eos> What about?<eos> The thing is, I don't even know.<eos> Well, I do.

- You bet, pet.<eos> But you wish you had said it. And now you're angry.<eos> I'm not talking to you any more.<eos> Do you ever think about death?<eos> I do, all the time.<eos> - What?<eos> - Say something nice.<eos> - Like what?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Then neither do I.
We're going.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> - Mr. Jules?<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's right. We are 2.<eos> We love to play this trick.<eos> I thought my head was spinning.<eos> Normally, heads spin after we have left.<eos> Sometimes, heads fall.<eos> - Do they?
That's why I picked it.<eos> I'm Katie Jones from Shantytown.<eos> That's right.<eos> Shantytown.<eos> But does that make a liar out of me?<eos> I am Sharon Falconer now. I've made her.<eos> I've put her together piece by piece till I've got a right to be her. I am her.<eos> I started building this tabernacle two years ago, and when this revival is ended, I'll have enough money to own it.<eos> Do you think it was blind luck that brought us to Zenith?<eos> Do you?
It was his fate.<eos> Tatsu. Listen.<eos> Lord Takeda is dead.<eos> He fell ill while on bivouac.<eos> You did it, with your prayers.<eos> I thought it was better not to say anything.<eos> That's why I didn't tell you.<eos> You know why Tatsu went mad?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> You do?
May I take a picture of you?<eos> Portrait of the 20th Century Lady of Fashion. By Delacro.<eos> It's not fair. I've been packing mushrooms.<eos> Or shall we call it just... Hilary.<eos> I think subject unknown.<eos> You know I shall want these pictures. To prove that the last 20 minutes actually have happened.<eos> I may tell myself that they haven't but the pictures will prove me wrong.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know exactly what I mean.<eos> No I don't.
You might tell him I'd have stayed at home if there was anything at all to stay home for.<eos> Theron's only 17 years old.<eos> We won't tell him anything, Wade.<eos> Hey, ain't that the captain's boy?<eos> Captain's boy nothing, that's Hannah's boy.<eos> Getting old for apron strings, ain't he?<eos> I don't know how old he is, but that kid sure is mossy green. You can send him after pigeon's milk or a left-handed monkey wrench, he'd go.<eos> I bet we could even get that kid to go on a snipe hunt.<eos> He doesn't even know there's no such thing as snipe hunting at night?<eos> No, he don't.
- Un-uh; that black wooden thing.<eos> - there's nothing that to see.<eos> - is that what you played last night?<eos> - I didn't play anything last night.<eos> Because I heard music.<eos> Probably a witch, baby sweets, that was wanting to haunt you.<eos> Come on, play.<eos> You must be dreaming.<eos> - I don't know how to play anything.<eos> - You do too!
Go see the boss.<eos> - Go on.<eos> What's the matter ?<eos> Wish your dad a pleasant evening.<eos> It's bad enough you weren't there.<eos> Piss off, man. - Don't tell me to piss off.<eos> Stay calm and mind your manners.<eos> Now call them.<eos> He doesn't dare.<eos> Yes, he does.
I'm with you, remember?<eos> I'm just going next door to Melanie's and have her put away this guillotine piece.<eos> You will find His Excellency there.<eos> Monsieur Alfonso et Mademoiselle Christina de la Cruz.<eos> Mr. John Edwards.<eos> - De la Cruz.<eos> - Mademoiselle et Monsieur de la Cruz.<eos> Enchant√©, mademoiselle.<eos> - Delighted, mademoiselle.<eos> - How do you do?
"Mr. Director, excuse it, please.<eos> It was all a big mistake.<eos> Here's your money back"?<eos> I don't know how, Paul.<eos> I only know that we should try.<eos> Please.<eos> Somehow?<eos> It's the only logical thing to do.<eos> We'll hide the money for a month or so, then exchange it a bit at a time.<eos> Who does the hiding?
Our law demands at least two eyewitnesses to any crime performed upon our soil.<eos> Where are the two ?<eos> Where is one ?<eos> They are here, two eyewitnesses.<eos> You are out of our brethren of the tribe of Reuben ?<eos> - Yes, I am Melzar, son of Raken.<eos> - And you ?<eos> I am Seyene, son of Cushan, also of the tribe of Reuben.<eos> Melzar and Seyene, you swear a holy oath to speak in truth ?<eos> - We do.

- To make a phone call.<eos> - You're so fond of making phone calls.<eos> - Me?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You know.<eos> I warned you.<eos> - The doctor doesn't like it.<eos> - What doesn't he like?<eos> - That you make phone calls.<eos> I didn't!
I'll throw 'em in free with the blue jeans.<eos> MUSSELS AND fries<eos> Hungry?<eos> Some mussels?<eos> Or fries?<eos> Both.<eos> A glass of white wine.<eos> What a slowpoke! My Pop would've downed ten glasses by now.<eos> - Your Pop drink a lot?<eos> - He did.
And Uncle Gabriel?<eos> - He's 32.<eos> - He looks older.<eos> Don't tell him or he'll cry.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause he's a hormosessual?<eos> - Where'd you hear that?<eos> - The guy said that.<eos> - It ain't so.<eos> - No, he really did.
HAS THAT MAN LEFT?<eos> HE LEFT SOME TIME AGO, MARKI E.<eos> IT'S RATHER LATE, YOU KNOW, IT'S PAST YOUR BEDTIME.<eos> DON'T YOU THINK YOU OUGHT TO GO HOME? YOUR MOTHER WILL BE WORRI ED.<eos> NO.<eos> SHE WON'T BE WORRI ED.<eos> I DON'T HAVE A MOTH ER.<eos> NOT ANYMORE.<eos> DO YOUREMEMBER NOW ABOUT MARKI E?<eos> DO YOU, H ELEN?
And the juries?<eos> I could've killed you anytime, and it wouldn't have been like the way you killed Bronson.<eos> So, you're a cop?<eos> I guess I knew it all the time.<eos> What I don't get is why you waited so long to take me.<eos> I made a deal with Rodriguez.<eos> If he flew me in here, I'd let you finish the job.<eos> I killed Bronson in self-defense, Bret.<eos> He pulled a knife on me. I want you to believe that.<eos> I do, Joe.
Yeah I hadn't thought of that.<eos> I guess that's why you're a detective lieutenant and I'm still a uniformed cop.<eos> Sometimes it's only the breaks, Larry.<eos> In the meantime let's get-<eos> -Lieutenant, Lieutenant !<eos> Did you hear that ?<eos> -How could we help it ?<eos> -It sure was strange.<eos> -Know what it was ?<eos> -No more than you do.
What will he observe?<eos> The constellation of Taurus or the life of a bumblebee?<eos> He'll observe the defendant.<eos> That's fine.<eos> The defence has no objection.<eos> I just wish to express my relief that the new recruit is not additional legal reinforcements from Lansing.<eos> We call Alphonse Paquette.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You do solemnly swear that the testimony you give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
We're over a barrel, Mitch.<eos> We have to use him.<eos> We call Duane Miller to the stand.<eos> Will the sheriff bring in the witness?<eos> What can he tell?<eos> Nothing.<eos> He can't tell anything.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear the testimony you give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
We must protest this whole affair.<eos> The noble defence attorney rushes to a secret conference and the last-minute witness is brought dramatically in.<eos> It's obviously been rigged to unduly excite the jury.<eos> It's just another cornball trick.<eos> Your Honour, I don't blame Mr. Dancer for feeling put upon.<eos> I'm just a humble country lawyer, trying to do my best against this brilliant prosecutor from the big city of Lansing.<eos> Swear the witness.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear the testimony you give shall be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
- Sure.<eos> He's lucky.<eos> Some people have all the luck.<eos> You can tell him I'm waiting to get kicked to kingdom come.<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> I have a souvenir for you.<eos> You'd better keep that.<eos> You might need it again sometime.<eos> You never know.<eos> No, you don't, do you?
- Oh, thank you, Anneke!<eos> - She's got your number.<eos> I wanted to write a poem for all of them, but I didn't have time.<eos> Yours, Mr. Van Daan, is really something.<eos> Something you want more than anything.<eos> Cigarettes!<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Cigarettes! - Two of them.<eos> Father found some pipe tobacco in the pocket of his coat, and we made them.<eos> Rather, Father did.
Who's "us"?<eos> Where are you from?<eos> - From far away.<eos> The way you look, I knew you were special.<eos> You don't understand it's all a bit over your head.<eos> We are, who we are.<eos> So come on!<eos> Get in.<eos> You know what he's up to, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
It's too dangerous.<eos> I'm a big girl.<eos> Yeah, and in all the right places too.<eos> You know, this is ridiculous.<eos> You know that, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean, we've hardly met.<eos> That's right.<eos> How do I know you aren't a murderer?<eos> You don't.
I know the French word for gloves...<eos> - No, you've got it all backwards.<eos> - What's that?<eos> I was supposed to comfort you, and you're comforting me.<eos> I'm crying.<eos> Everybody was so afraid that you might cry.<eos> - They were?<eos> - Isn't that funny?<eos> No.<eos> Sometimes I do.
What's your name?<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> I'm Euridice.<eos> Amazing!<eos> No wonder I liked you right away.<eos> "Orpheus likes Eurydice," as the story goes.<eos> Are you Orpheus?<eos> From head to toe.<eos> Well... I don't like you.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't care.<eos> A simple report is enough.<eos> The word of one of my men can put you in jail.<eos> Well, goodbye.<eos> What are your plans?<eos> My plans?<eos> I want to know them!<eos> They wanted to know who withdrew that complaint.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> - That your mother did.
I'd know that voice anywhere.<eos> - You know me?<eos> "You are my inspiration, Alma."<eos> The telephone.<eos> I'm one of the most devoted listeners.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> It's chilly out here.<eos> How about we stop for a drink somewhere?<eos> I don't usually.
Once upon a dream.<eos> [Phillip humming Once Upon a Dream] HUBERT:<eos> Phillip! Stop! Stop that!<eos> Phillip!<eos> P-put me down!<eos> Now...what's all this dream nonsense? It wasn't a dream, Father.<eos> I really did meet her. The Princess Aurora?<eos> Good heavens!<eos> We must tell Stefan! Why, this is the most-- l didn't say it was Aurora.<eos> You most certainly did!
Speaking of which, I saw an interesting reaction this afternoon.<eos> There's this deaf-mute.<eos> She can't utter a sound, and she has a blood trauma.<eos> I cut my hand on a broken saucer, and she went into total shock.<eos> I've never seen anyone so terrified... or so unable to release her fear tensions.<eos> What happened?<eos> Her husband thinks she faints, but it isn't a true faint at all.<eos> It's much more serious.<eos> Her unreleased tensions grow so great... that she goes into psychosomatic blackout.<eos> What if she didn't?
You slut!<eos> Don't, Uncle.<eos> She's apologising.<eos> What?<eos> How dare you worry Mother like this? Don't scold him so.<eos> Shut up!<eos> They're gluttons for punishment!<eos> - Slut!<eos> - Stop, Uncle.<eos> Don't!
The amusing part.<eos> Marcel showed me a photo of the butcher shop.<eos> The one with the calf's head.<eos> We had a laugh.<eos> Then we talked about you, about dad.<eos> A remarkable man.<eos> I mean, your son.<eos> Sensitive. An artist.<eos> You don't really know him.<eos> No one does.
- Not ridiculous at all.<eos> - But strange?<eos> - A little.<eos> - Why?<eos> Say it.<eos> Say anything, Cecile.<eos> I have to kind of push everything around to think of Raymond married.<eos> You didn't want him to marry again?<eos> No, I mean, I didn't think he wanted to.<eos> But if he does, I do.
That's too bad. Especially 'cause, if they have no necks you can't wring them.<eos> Did you ever hear so many dog's names tagged on to children?<eos> They've got five monsters and number six coming up.<eos> They've brought the whole bunch here like animals to display at a county fair.<eos> It's so obvious, it's disgusting. It's obvious what they're up to.<eos> What are they up to, Maggie?<eos> I'll tell you what they're up to, boy of mine. They're up to cutting you out of your father's estate.<eos> Everybody knows Big Daddy's dying of...<eos> I ought to send Sister Woman a bill for a new pair of stockings.<eos> Do we?
And I'll run this place till the day I die.<eos> Is that plain to you, Ida? Is that perfectly clear to you?<eos> I ain't going to die.<eos> Ain't nothing wrong with me but a spastic colon!<eos> Made spastic, I reckon, by all the lies and liars I've had to put up with around here.<eos> And all the hypocrisy I've had to live with these 40 years I've lived with you.<eos> Now blow out them candles.<eos> Go on. Blow out them candles on that stupid cake.<eos> In all these years you never believed I loved you.<eos> And I did.
- You can't buy love!<eos> Does it love you? Who do you think I bought it for? It's yours, the place, the money!<eos> - We drew this up with the advice...<eos> - Get out of the way.<eos> Waste!<eos> Worthless!<eos> I never saw you cry before. Did you ever cry as a kid?<eos> Can't you understand? I never wanted your place or money.<eos> I don't want to own anything! All I wanted was a father, not a boss! I wanted you to love me.<eos> I did and I do.

[Brick sobs]<eos> Don't, son.<eos> Please don't cry.<eos> BIG DADDY:<eos> That's funny.<eos> I never saw you cry before. Did you ever cry as a kid?<eos> Can't you understand? I never wanted your place or money.<eos> I don't want to own anything!<eos> All I wanted was a father, not a boss! I wanted you to love me.<eos> I did and I do.
- When will you be back?<eos> - I can't say for sure.<eos> You look pale.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Arthur, darling, don't fuss.<eos> I feel perfectly well.<eos> Good-bye, darling.<eos> Perhaps you'd better let me lead the way, these steps can be dangerous.<eos> We don't want to have an accident, do we?<eos> No, we don't.
Your cheekbones are too high.<eos> But we can do something with the rest of you.<eos> Your teeth, your eyes...<eos> ... youreyelashes,yourhair.<eos> We can...<eos> ... andwewill.<eos> You must learn to choose cigars.<eos> Aunt, but I don't smoke cigars.<eos> Of course you don't smoke cigars.<eos> But a man does.
Hey.<eos> During the war, they made me an officer and a gentleman for doing the same things they was gonna hang me for a few days ago.<eos> Now, you can't tell me that makes any sense, Jake.<eos> There's a difference, but you'll never understand it.<eos> I suppose you're talking about something like honor, ain't you?<eos> Which is supposed to be too deep for me to understand.<eos> Well, all I know is if you got honor, you don't run out on a friend, right?<eos> Why did you run out on me?<eos> - You know why.<eos> CLINT: No, I don't.
He had to go to Lincoln.<eos> Mr. McSween, I gotta do something.<eos> You'll find work.<eos> No, not work. Something...<eos> It's not your place.<eos> I got to...<eos> You're not his kin.<eos> - You didn't know him.<eos> - I knew him.<eos> Nobody did.
Yes, yes, yes.<eos> I was too strict.<eos> I want to keep my Carla with me so I not be lonely.<eos> But now, I am no lonely no more.<eos> Why, of course not, Papa Naples.<eos> You still have Sandy.<eos> Nah, nah, nah.<eos> I am no lonely no more because maybe I feel I am gonna be a grand papa.<eos> Maybe I am grand papa already, eh?<eos> Well, what do you...
Then what are you doin' here, Mr. Barrett?<eos> Your brother Luke's not in Memphis, he's not here or any of his normal delivery points.<eos> Somebody tore up two cars last night on the Chalk Gap road.<eos> I think it was your brother.<eos> If it was, he's still loaded, his car is torn up and maybe he is.<eos> So use your head a little, will you, boy?<eos> Do you know who Carl Kogan is?<eos> All right, don't answer-- you don't have to.<eos> But I know that you know.<eos> So do we.
You know Schwartz, of the local D.A.'s office.<eos> Who's in charge here?<eos> - I can't even tell you what happened.<eos> Why aren't you in Mexico City for that dope trial?<eos> Grandi?<eos> I hoped to go on the morning plane, but now...<eos> This business?<eos> - Afraid so.<eos> That bomb came from the Mexican side of the border.<eos> - The car did.
Would you like to come and look?<eos> - Her car's gone.<eos> - What car?<eos> Midge who do you know that's an authority on San Francisco history?<eos> That's the kind of greeting a girl likes.<eos> None of this: "Hello, you look wonderful" stuff.<eos> Just, "Do you know an authority on San Francisco-"<eos> - Want a drink?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> Well, who do you?
Tomorrow afternoon. It's in the bag.<eos> What's wrong, dear?<eos> Aren't you happy for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, my love.<eos> Very happy.<eos> "A down payment.<eos> The rest will follow."<eos> Don't swindle me.<eos> The Mauvin Agency never does that.
You mean, get undressed in front of him?<eos> I'll turn his back to you.<eos> Nicky, are you doing that?<eos> Doing what?<eos> Making him stare at me.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Too far.<eos> Are you absolutely sure he can't think?<eos> Positive, unless somebody does his thinking for him.
- I could be wrong but...<eos> - It was eight o'clock, not seven.<eos> They heard an argument.<eos> Then they heard the father hit the boy twice.<eos> Finally they saw the boy run, angry, out of the house.<eos> What does that prove?<eos> It don't prove anything.<eos> It's just part of the picture.<eos> You said it provided a motive.<eos> So did the prosecution.
My grandfather was in the diplomatic service.<eos> They travelled the world.<eos> When he retired, they came here to live.<eos> He's buried there behind the chapel.<eos> She stayed on to be near him.<eos> She must be waiting, I think impatiently, for the day she will join him.<eos> - Is this the girl?<eos> - No.<eos> Darling, this is Terry McKay.<eos> How do you do?
I should never have believed...<eos> Listen to me, Mary.<eos> Listen.<eos> Do you remember before the war, at the monthly square dances, the men were so thick around you, a fella couldn't get closer than 10 feet without having his toes crushed.<eos> Then the war came along, and all the men in the valley left, except me.<eos> And I guess I... I forgot how lucky I am.<eos> What suddenly makes you remember?<eos> We being here, waiting to die.<eos> We deserve to die!<eos> I do Mary, I do but not you and the b...
- That isn't dirt.<eos> Well, what do you know?<eos> His first shiner.<eos> What'd you do to the other guy?<eos> Oh, it was that child psychiatrist's boy again. That nasty Sydney.<eos> Tom, you'll have to speak to his father.<eos> It's getting to be a regular persecution.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> The boy wants to fight his own battles.<eos> No, I don't.
Took me over two hours to beat you.<eos> Will you play me another?<eos> Another?<eos> Well...<eos> All right, one more, and then that's all for tonight.<eos> You be the black this time.<eos> What'll you give me if I win you?<eos> If you win me?<eos> Let's not get too big for our britches here.<eos> But what if I do?
Oil, construction business, turbo-jet engines, Pepsi-Cola....<eos> "The Pause that Refreshes"?<eos> No, that's the other one:<eos> "Pepsi-Cola Hits the Spot!"<eos> But we must not jump to conclusions.<eos> It's this terrible uncertainty that's driving me mad.<eos> He comes to Paris every year.<eos> And I always know when he comes because my business improves noticeably.<eos> I should have taken my wife with me to London.<eos> He does very well in London, too.
That's better.<eos> Now, I want you all to remember not to touch anything that you don't recognize, and I don't want anyone wandering too far from the car.<eos> Do you understand? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Okay, explode.<eos> Find something, Ginny? Lizards.<eos> Do they live there together, Miss Barrett?<eos> Well, why don't you ask them?<eos> Maybe they're husband and wife.<eos> Lizards don't get married, do they?<eos> Well, maybe not the same way that people do.
That's one expression, backed up by many things.<eos> I haven't asked for any of them.<eos> Understand what you're saying no to.<eos> When I take you in my arms, I commit to you, not just physically but all the way.<eos> That means I intend to worry about you, to take care of you and that's what I want back from you, without any reservations or shame.<eos> - Either you're up to that or not.<eos> - I have my standards and pride.<eos> They're not enough for anyone.<eos> You need someone to trust, to love.<eos> No, I don't. I don't!
A beating becomes one blow.<eos> A blow becomes a slap.<eos> Perhaps the slap will become something else.<eos> Objection overruled.<eos> No further questions.<eos> No questions, Your Honor.<eos> You may step down.<eos> The prosecution calls Mrs. Constance MacKenzie to the stand.<eos> Raise your hand. Do you swear to tell the truth, whole truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Court will come to order.<eos> Remain seated, please.<eos> Has the prosecution completed its questioning of Mrs. MacKenzie?<eos> It has.<eos> The prosecution rests.<eos> No more questions.<eos> You may step down.<eos> We call Dr. Matthew Swain to the stand, as a witness for the defense.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, whole truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Like you feel in the steppe.<eos> Natalya here wants to leave us.<eos> - I don't know why.<eos> - But I do!<eos> I know why!<eos> And I don't blame her, for all that it's sinful.<eos> It's not her fault, it's that swine's!<eos> - What's my fault?<eos> - Don't you know, you devil?<eos> No, I don't.
Oh, I'll tell you...<eos> I'll tell you that by all means.<eos> But now it's getting late.<eos> Good night, Osip Davydovich.<eos> I'll stay with you a day or two.<eos> - Aren't you going back home?<eos> - No.<eos> How are you going to live?<eos> How to live?<eos> Like other people do.
Maybe I didn't say it well. Maybe because of my accent.<eos> My dear Mrs Vole, in our courts we accept the evidence of witnesses who speak only Bulgarian and who must have an interpreter.<eos> We accept the evidence of deaf-mutes who cannot speak at all, as long as they tell the truth.<eos> You're aware that when you're in the witness box you will be sworn<eos> - and you will testify under oath? - Yes. Leonard came home at 9.26 precisely and did not go out again.<eos> The truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth.<eos> Is that better?<eos> - Mrs Vole, do you love your husband?<eos> - Leonard thinks I do.<eos> - Well, do you?
Come on.<eos> Where, where...<eos> The spring is pretty far.<eos> Ajug of water, a jug of water Is sweeter than anyone's daughter.<eos> Here, take it, you sickly one.<eos> May he who sold you burn in hell!<eos> Damned donkey!<eos> May he be struck dumb!<eos> He fell again, didn't he, that cursed donkey?<eos> - He did, poor animal.
Here's where the turkey shoot begins!<eos> How does it look?<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> It's hard to tell.<eos> Hey, soldier, how'd you like to get relieved?<eos> - What, go down there?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Drop dead.<eos> - It looks quiet.<eos> - So does a graveyard.
You'll find it under Harvard Classics.<eos> Give Darwin a little nudge there.<eos> I thought I'd pour a little champagne.<eos> It's a great leveler.<eos> - It makes you my equal.<eos> - I wouldn't say that.<eos> Well, it almost makes you my equal.<eos> C.K. Dexter-Haven didn't you once know a girl named Tracy Samantha Lord?<eos> - Sounds familiar.<eos> - No, you didn't.
Then he went in to Copy.<eos> Crazy, isn't it?<eos> Looks very comfortable.<eos> My doctor tells me I need plenty of rest... and this is one of the ways I have of doing it.<eos> Why do you want to work for U.B.C.?<eos> Well, for one thing, I'd like to make more money.<eos> Well, that's a wholesome, refreshing approach.<eos> Also I'd like to work in a place... where there's more opportunity for advancement than there is at the Foundation.<eos> - Can you write?<eos> - Well, I do most of the writing at the Foundation- reports to the trustees, things of that sort.
-For this strapping lad? Not half enough.<eos> Captain Peleg, thee hast a generous heart. But thee must consider the duty thee owest to the other owners of this ship... widows and orphans, many of them.<eos> If we too abundantly reward the labors of this young man... we'll be taking bread from their mouths.<eos> I'm putting him down for the 300th part of the profit.<eos> You hear, Bildad?<eos> The 300th part, I say. "Lay not up for yourself treasures upon earth... "where moth and rust do corrupt."<eos> -My last pay was--<eos> -The 777th part seems fair enough to me.<eos> -The 300th. -Don't thank me, lad.<eos> I only do thee justice.
Thank you, Adad.<eos> Lie down, my lord.<eos> Well, go right ahead, Rog.<eos> Don't mind me.<eos> I will watch you while you're away.<eos> Away?<eos> ln your dreams.<eos> What about you?<eos> When do you sleep, Adad?<eos> Or do you?
We're gonna plant you there until we decide what to do.<eos> I'll make out a receipt.<eos> Make it out to Capt. Colt Saunders.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I'm telling you, you'd better crawl up in my attic and hide.<eos> No, I want the nicest room in the place.<eos> Just make out the receipt to Capt. Colt Saunders.<eos> They've got a saying in Texas:<eos> "The Rio Grande changes its course...<eos> "but the Saunders don't."
That wasn't my question.<eos> I asked you if, at any time, you heard Mitch Wayne threaten to kill your husband.<eos> - Yes, but...<eos> - Thank you.<eos> That will be all.<eos> Will Miss Hadley step forward, please?<eos> - State your name, please.<eos> - Marylee Hadley.<eos> Do you swear the testimony you're about to give... is the truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
St. Moritz.<eos> What's she doing there?<eos> I wish this hadn't come up, Mark.<eos> Never mind that.<eos> Did she say anything about me?<eos> Apparently, there was someone else.<eos> She doesn't love you, Mark.<eos> She never did.<eos> I guess you're right.<eos> She never did.
When did you do this?<eos> Couple of months ago.<eos> I was living here at the time, thanks to the Willmans.<eos> It's a nice piece of work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you use a model for that?<eos> Yes, my wife.<eos> Is her name Jocelyn?<eos> Why, yes, you know her?<eos> I did once.
passionately, I think so.<eos> honestly, don't you think marriage is just the most important thing in the world?<eos> I mean, a woman isn't really a woman at all... ... untilshe'sbeenmarried and had children.<eos> And why?<eos> Because she's fulfilled.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> Right.<eos> You agree?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> What red-bIooded American boy doesn't?
- I beg you, Master Waltham, my lord is...<eos> - I care not who my lord is, fat-chops.<eos> I would not venture out to free the coach of the queen.<eos> - And nor would any of my friends.<eos> - I'm on the queen's business.<eos> The last time I went on the queen's business was to the Irish wars. Here's all I got for that.<eos> To free your coach might cost me the other one.<eos> Derry, do you know that man? - No.<eos> Not from Adam.<eos> - I do, very well.
Glad to meet you.<eos> Used to know your father. Fine man. - Thank you.<eos> - I remember ‚îÄ Shall we say hello to Romeo and his Juliet?<eos> - So that's Cary's nature boy.<eos> - You know the doctor ‚îÄ Dan.<eos> - Hello, Dan.<eos> Cary, you know Miss Frisbee, Mr. Allenby.<eos> Mr. Kirby.<eos> - How do you do?<eos> - How do you do?
- What are you up to?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> We work.<eos> What do you do with Roberto and the other one?<eos> What sort of work? What do you think?<eos> You know I always tell you everything.<eos> I never know anything! You never tell me the truth!<eos> I'm not like them, you know.<eos> Do you think I want to be ruined? I work.<eos> I don't do anything wrong.
You're a policeman, you find him.<eos> He's not alone, he's got Susan Lowell with him.<eos> I wouldn't raise a finger to help that girl.<eos> - Let her go through what I've been through.<eos> - She never hurt you, Alicia.<eos> He's the one who put you away, why take it out on her?<eos> Because I hate her.<eos> Her and every other woman who ever had anything to do with him<eos> What have I done to you, why do you hate me?<eos> Oh, I don't!
- Oh, how beautiful it is!<eos> - It is an American automobile.<eos> - No, no, it is Italian.<eos> - It is not. It's a Cadillac. - We saw one in the cinema.<eos> - Shh! Kids, what are you doing there?<eos> There is an American automobile with a man.<eos> He has been talking to Emile. Where?<eos> - Did you see him? Did you see his face?<eos> - Yes, I saw him.<eos> You did?
It don't cost nothing to look.<eos> By the way, you got a gun in the house?<eos> Stay looking at me and answer the question.<eos> No, no gun.<eos> That's right, you ain't.<eos> Show him, Hal.<eos> I thought you was going to lie to me.<eos> I like doing business with a man I can trust.<eos> Get in the kitchen and cook that chicken.<eos> Do it yourself.
Sorry.<eos> I was in the midst of an argument.<eos> An argument?<eos> My Chinese side was debating with my European side.<eos> What about?<eos> Sleeping tigers.<eos> Mark...<eos> Could I have a cigarette?<eos> I've never seen you smoke.<eos> I rarely do.
A cheap crook, pushing people around.<eos> - I ever push Ruthie around?<eos> - You will, pal.<eos> Wise guy, you know everything.<eos> You don't know nothing.<eos> In a million years, you wouldn't know about Ruthie, how I feel about her.<eos> A girl like that.<eos> You don't know nothing.<eos> What I come from, the kind of a life, the kind of a place.<eos> Same place I did, Snyder.
All right, you've rested. Let's go.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - That's up to you. I'm going on.<eos> You're gonna leave me here without any defense?<eos> Well, you got this far without any.<eos> - I had a gun then.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> I lost it when we crossed that little crick.<eos> I can't believe a gal brought up on a frontier would lose a gun.<eos> I did.
Hurry, hurry, hurry! See the battle of the giants.<eos> - What?<eos> - Kirk and Bravano are having it out.<eos> - A fight? - Goliath versus Goliath.<eos> - Throwin' punches?<eos> - Don't be silly. Neither one of them has had his hands closed since the day he was born.<eos> My tongue is loosened by champagne.<eos> I speak as I do everything, for all the world to know.<eos> Everything I do - and I admit to all your accusations - I do in the open.<eos> But you, Mr Kirk Edwards, do them secretly.
I don't understand one thing about this place.<eos> The bread will be ready in an hour.<eos> I'll bring it to your cottage.<eos> " -Thank you, Mrs. Maclntosh.<eos> -Good day."<eos> Good day.<eos> I've been wanting to do that all day.<eos> Now where?<eos> I must gather some heather for the weddin' decorations.<eos> Where do you do that?
And the kitchen has bars on the window.<eos> We assume he must have come in through these windows here.<eos> I understand you weren't here when this happened.<eos> No, I was at a dinner party at the Grendon Hotel and by coincidence, I was phoning my wife when she was attacked.<eos> So I gather.<eos> Can you tell me exactly what time it was?<eos> No, I'm afraid I can't.<eos> I do remember my watch had stopped.<eos> Did you notice, Mrs. Wendice?<eos> -No, I didn't.
Recording Secretary.<eos> Thank you, gentlemen.<eos> -Next witness. -Mr.<eos> Malloy.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> -Name, please.<eos> -Terry Malloy.<eos> Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and only the truth?<eos> -Right.<eos> -l do.

What do you want, Miss Maxwell?<eos> Have you still got your horses?<eos> All right, get on 'em and hightail it.<eos> Don't move... anyone.<eos> What's this all about? Why, it's Mr Averell!<eos> Glad to see you, Mr Averell.<eos> Miss Maxwell and I were talking about you just a while ago.<eos> That's nice.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Miss Maxwell did most of the talkin';
Oh, Jimmy! That was long time ago!<eos> Come now and sit down!<eos> Put on dressing gown.<eos> There is a good boy.<eos> Dinner, darling!<eos> Coming, Maud.<eos> Mod?<eos> - What is "mod"?<eos> You say, "mod."<eos> No, darling, I didn't, I...
By George, I must say!<eos> No doubt about it, no sirree.<eos> No doubt about it at all.<eos> - Miss Lee, meet Piggie. - Delighted!<eos> Delighted!<eos> You did say "diamonds." I can tell.<eos> I control the second largest mine in South Africa.<eos> But this lady has a friend she doesn't want to know about me.<eos> - I wonder why.<eos> - Oh, no, you don't.
~ I don 't mean rhinestones ~<eos> ~ But diamonds ~<eos> ~ Are a girl's best ~<eos> ~ Best friend ~<eos> - How did Gus like your number?<eos> - He looked kind of grim.<eos> Hand me my hat, please.<eos> He is sweet, isn't he?<eos> I really do love Gus.<eos> You do?
Third, the minute the preacher said amen, he never did any work.<eos> Then he stole my TV set. I asked him about it and he hit me with a chicken.<eos> - A live chicken?<eos> - No, baked and stuffed.<eos> He sounds incompatible to me.<eos> Last I saw him, I got out of the car at a gas station and had to walk home.<eos> I'm surprised you'd want to marry again.<eos> That's the point of this setup.<eos> Of course I want to get married again.<eos> Who doesn't?
- Why not?<eos> Well...<eos> If you're worried about me, I already think you're quite a strudel.<eos> Honestly?<eos> I've thought so from the first minute I saw you.<eos> Well, if you really think so.<eos> Go ahead, put them on.<eos> You're crazy.<eos> - You look better with them.<eos> - I do?
I've been wondering about the lady you met outside Villette's house.<eos> Quite by chance, I happened to see you from inside the house.<eos> Inspector, the appointment that I had with Villette couldn't be of any importance to you.<eos> But we aren't discussing that at the moment.<eos> You see, with a murder, one has to jump from one detail to another.<eos> Perhaps I jumped too suddenly for you.<eos> Well, it seems maybe I don't follow as fast as you jump.<eos> I have a methodical mind.<eos> I do have to take things one by one.<eos> So do I.

Totally dead<eos> Where is the fun I used to find? Where has it gone?<eos> Gone with the wind I've oft been told of nuptial bliss<eos> But what do you do a quarter-to-two With only a shrew to kiss?<eos> So I repeat what first I said<eos> Where is the life that late<eos> I led?<eos> There's a madman outside with an ambulance.<eos> Insists on seeing you.<eos> Sorry. So does my audience.
I don't seem to mind.<eos> Do you?<eos> I think I'll go out for a cup of coffee.<eos> You'd better get to sleep.<eos> On this one.<eos> Terribly nice.<eos> These are pajamas.<eos> They're to sleep in. You're to climb into them.<eos> - You understand? - Thank you.<eos> Then you do your sleeping on the couch, not on the bed.
That takes dough, for dough you need a job, and there are no jobs here.<eos> Look.<eos> They started that building two years ago but then just gave up.<eos> Can't blame 'em with this sun.<eos> It's like prison here. Easy to get in.<eos> "Make yourself at home."<eos> But there's no way out, and if you don't get out, you croak.<eos> - Well, I don't feel like croaking.<eos> - Nobody does.<eos> But they do anyway.
He's breathing!<eos> Breathing the smell of your stinkin' feet!<eos> Bastard!<eos> You had us worried!<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> - Wait.<eos> Let me see.<eos> You really scared us.<eos> We thought you'd had it.<eos> So did I.
Mario, stop!<eos> My leg!<eos> Why didn't you get out of the way? Don't we have enough problems?<eos> You bastard.<eos> You knew you were running over me. But you ran right over your buddy.<eos> Buddy or not, I had to.<eos> You're hurting me!<eos> It's your fault.<eos> I told you to get out of the way. If I hadn't hesitated -<eos> - You did?
Please...<eos> All right...<eos> And on an empty stomach, too...<eos> This is good stuff.<eos> Do you like a drop of sake, Father?<eos> Oh, yes, very much so in the old days.<eos> If we ever ran out at home he'd rush out for more, any time of the night.<eos> Every time we had a son I'd pray he wouldn't become a drinker.<eos> Did Shoji drink?<eos> - He did indeed.
We're not so young, but we still get along well.<eos> Since we have few friends, we spend most evenings in this room.<eos> Sometimes we play cards.<eos> That probably sounds dull to you, no?<eos> You'll find it amusing that we play cards.<eos> Sometimes I read while my wife knits. But we're not bored, and do you know why?<eos> Because we really love each other.<eos> But you wouldn't understand.<eos> Of course I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
The wind from time to time will carry in the cry of the gulls.<eos> As if shaken by a sudden shiver, Frida turns.<eos> She looks tired, aged. She approaches him.<eos> "There will be no moon tonight."<eos> I like you, baby.<eos> And if you're not drinking with me, damn you to hell!<eos> - Can you do Gary Cooper? - Alberto, do the saw.<eos> I do a good saw.<eos> But you've got to close your eyes. Be quiet and listen!<eos> My turn to do an impression.
Michel...<eos> - What is it?<eos> - Don't you hear her?<eos> - What?<eos> - I don't want her to cry out.<eos> Don't get mad like that.<eos> Why are you yelling?<eos> Afraid?<eos> Don't yell then.<eos> I didn't.
What'll it cost!<eos> It's simple: Georges' was 250 francs.<eos> 250 multiplied by 14... Take 14 and carry...<eos> You never could count!<eos> Wait till I find him.<eos> Why don't you want to?<eos> Tell me...<eos> Since you know, - tell me.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Yes, you do.
What?<eos> Where am I going?<eos> - To become a doctor in Paris.<eos> In Paris?<eos> Why in Paris and not here?<eos> I have my special reasons.<eos> It is better not to see Alraune again.<eos> I knew you would come.<eos> - You knew?<eos> I almost didn't.
Are you really going to grow a moustache?<eos> - I've thought about it, why?<eos> - He has! Tranche-Montagne, I love you. She was right.<eos> - Who?<eos> - I consulted a fortune-teller.<eos> You consulted a rival?<eos> She's a real one.<eos> - And you believed her?<eos> - I believe in cards, horoscopes, stars, palmistry, God, the Blessed Virgin, and in love.<eos> - I do too.
Keep going.<eos> This isn't a parking lot.<eos> That was a beautiful doll you made for Sissy.<eos> I'm glad she liked it.<eos> Hello, Holly.<eos> Oh, Buttons!<eos> I want you to meet The Great Sebastian.<eos> This is Buttons.<eos> You'll love him.<eos> Everybody does.
It seems you're carrying a heavy load indeed.<eos> It's just...<eos> I'm such a fool.<eos> I'm just... so furious with myself.<eos> I'd never even bought a drink with my own money.<eos> It's only now that I don't know how much longer I've got to live that I finally...<eos> I understand.<eos> But drinking is plain crazy.<eos> Besides, does it even taste good?<eos> No, it doesn't.
A balcony overlooking the Thames!<eos> But it isn't true!<eos> In the twilight he will tell you he loves you.<eos> And you will tell him you've always loved him.<eos> But I don't love him! I never did.<eos> It was his music, his art.<eos> He meant a world that had been denied me.<eos> You look so well together.<eos> But I don't love him!<eos> I never did.
Moreau?<eos> This morning. I'm lucky to be alive.<eos> - The assembly adjourned for a month... but I know where he lives.<eos> I thought you'd be interested.<eos> Tomorrow?<eos> Tonight. I shall sleep much better when I know Moreau is dead.<eos> Noel?<eos> - You don't like it.<eos> - But I do, very much.<eos> No, you don't.
It depends. See if you can get me the flagship, will you?<eos> Shall I ask for the admiral?<eos> No, the chef. I want to give him the recipe for this.<eos> I cannot be selfish. I must share it with the navy.<eos> Japanese Soldier: Marines, you die!<eos> Oh, you said it, pal. You can't trust 'em. What's the joke?<eos> Heh heh, well, some joke.<eos> I was fightin' in L.A.<eos> In January 1 942... and a marine colonel asked me if I'd put on an exhibition for them.<eos> So I did.
Come on, Captain, it'll only take a minute, and it'll mean such a lot to the lady.<eos> Very well, if you wish it absolutely.<eos> What are the names again?<eos> -Charles.<eos> -Rosie.<eos> Rose.<eos> Do you, Charles, take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Do you, Rose, take this man to be your lawful wedded husband?<eos> I do.
King Saul.<eos> It was in his last battle.<eos> There. At the Mount of Gilboa.<eos> It's peaceful now. Good grazing for the flocks, though we lack rain this year.<eos> But that day it rained blood.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I saw the king die. Saw him fall on his sword when he knew the battle was lost.<eos> Tell me, did you also see the king's son die?<eos> - Jonathan.<eos> - Yes, sir. I did.
What a brilliant idea.<eos> I never would have thought of it.<eos> The people who are coming to the meeting tonight, have they arrived?<eos> Yes. I talked to them on the phone.<eos> They're all very curious about the meeting.<eos> Good. Did you speak to our friend Mr Carpenter?<eos> He'll be there at 8.30.<eos> Tell me, Hilda, does all this frighten you?<eos> Does it make you feel insecure?<eos> - Yes, sir. It certainly does.
Is it over?<eos> Yes, yes, it's over.<eos> I didn't stay for the end.<eos> What about?<eos> Oh, a whole lot of things.<eos> So you couldn't just sit there, then?<eos> No. Are there any glasses?<eos> Oh, here are some.<eos> I, uh... I resigned.<eos> You didn't.
I-I think there's some over here in one of these.<eos> There.<eos> Here's some.<eos> Here's some more here.<eos> March, January. Two, three. Seven months!<eos> You haven't put anything into the bank for seven months.<eos> You have lots of money.<eos> I shouldn't have worried, should I?<eos> You don't need anyone.<eos> Yeah, well... Yes, you do.
George, was Alice conscious when she fell into the water?<eos> Yes, I heard her scream but couldn't see her, 'cause she was on the other side.<eos> So I swam around to the other side.<eos> She was...<eos> When I got there, she'd gone down.<eos> I never saw her again.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you did not strike her?<eos> I swear it!<eos> - That you did not push her in?<eos> - I did not!

I do. I do.
In there.<eos> Who's the engineer?<eos> - He is.<eos> - Oh, no, him. Him's the engineer.<eos> - He is.<eos> - Him.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Now, make up your minds.<eos> - Didn't hear you knock.<eos> - Because I didn't.
And that's why I...<eos> I killed him.<eos> You...?<eos> One night... we drove out to a place called Moon Lake Casino.<eos> We danced the Varsouviana.<eos> Suddenly, in the middle of the dance, the boy I married broke away from me... and ran out of the casino.<eos> A few minutes later...<eos> ...a shot.<eos> I ran.<eos> All did.
- Someone you know, Antoine. And I'll ask you to treat him as a special guest.<eos> - Let him rest. He's earned it.<eos> - Very well, Professor.<eos> Good morning, lads.<eos> This gold coin is for the one who deserves it the most. In other words, the strongest!<eos> - A gold coin!<eos> - And another!<eos> Is it possible to make more?<eos> - If Your Highess so commands.<eos> - I do!
For him.<eos> He<eos> - He wanted it that way, l-I think.<eos> - The bowman?<eos> - Yes, sire.<eos> Why did he wish it, then?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It was something he felt that- I don't know what it was.<eos> Bayan used to say that nothing existed... except what you could touch.<eos> But it did for him.
Do what I'm telling you!<eos> Barber, what'll you take to cut his throat?<eos> Some jokes I don't like.<eos> - Don't get excited.<eos> - Don't tell me what to do!<eos> - Just a joke, Harry. - That's all.<eos> I said beat it.<eos> Eddie, take care of them.<eos> - I'll be going too.<eos> - No, don't.
What I saw in them was neither anger, nor sorrow,<eos> but a cold light, a look of loathing.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> It's too cruel.<eos> Beat me, kill me, but don't look at me like that. Please, stop.<eos> Now kill me.<eos> Kill me at once.<eos> Stop.<eos> Don't.
I must know!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Betty, wake up!<eos> Why are you staring at me like that? Oh, was I?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What's wrong with you tonight?<eos> What is it?<eos> Oh, something came up.<eos> I don't want to talk about it. Why not?<eos> I just don't.
Lola! Get out of the way.<eos> Muchas gracias. - Where are you hit? - My arm.<eos> You little fool. Here.<eos> - Here, Lin. I'll take care of her.<eos> - She's hit in the arm.<eos> Don't let him go.<eos> Why'd you let him?<eos> Dutch Henry is a murderer.<eos> I know, ma'am.<eos> So does Lin.
Boy's good.<eos> I could use him.<eos> - I'll bring him over later to meet you.<eos> - It's a deal.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, this is Rick Martin.<eos> I've known him from the time he was a little boy.<eos> I...<eos> I taught him how to hold that trumpet he just played for you.<eos> But I didn't teach him how to play it.<eos> Not the way he does.
- What's your name?<eos> - Cecchina. Cecchina, what time did your mother return last night?<eos> After work.<eos> At midnight, as always.<eos> Child, tell me the truth.<eos> Does your mother live alone?<eos> - With me.<eos> - Yes, we know that. But are there any friends?<eos> Someone that comes to meet her? No. My mother didn't make friendship with anyone.<eos> But I did.
- Is the defendant ready?<eos> - Defendant is ready.<eos> Very well.<eos> You may proceed to select a jury.<eos> Paul Hurlock.<eos> Take your coat with you, please.<eos> Place your left hand on the Bible.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> You swear to truthfully answer all questions... put to you to challenge your competence... as an impartial juror in this proceeding... between New York and Doris Attinger, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Do you believe in equal rights for women?<eos> I should say not.<eos> The defendant challenges this juror for cause.<eos> Excused.<eos> Benjamin Klausner.<eos> In view of the fact that counsel have agreed... that alternate jurors are not to be selected... may we proceed without making a call for additional prospective jurors?<eos> You may proceed.<eos> Left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand.<eos> You swear to truthfully answer all questions... put to you to challenge your competence... as an impartial juror in this proceeding... between New York and Doris Attinger, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
We'll be here a year.<eos> Mrs. Bonner, couldn't you cover the ground with three witnesses?<eos> Well, Dr. Margaret Brodeigh, will you take the stand, please?<eos> With this witness to be examined... this case will continue for at least two days.<eos> With Your Honor's permission, I'll report that no new cases...<eos> - are to be added to our calendar.<eos> - So ordered.<eos> Left hand on the Bible, raise your right hand.<eos> You swear that the evidence you'll give to the jury... will be nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
- Yes.<eos> Oh, Catherine...<eos> I...<eos> love... you.<eos> I'll cherish you forever.<eos> Oh! We must speak to my father.<eos> I will do it tonight.<eos> You must do it tomorrow.<eos> It's sweet of you to want to do it first.<eos> A young man generally does that.
All right, what are you waiting for?<eos> Get it over with.<eos> Pete, ask him for water.<eos> You want her?<eos> Take her.<eos> You can have her.<eos> Nobody wants you.<eos> From the beginning, it was her idea.<eos> I don't want your gold.<eos> I never did.
You mean that, honey?<eos> We could have fun.<eos> Live big.<eos> Money's just paper if you don't spend it.<eos> -That's an idea.<eos> -lt's a good idea.<eos> Europe, maybe.<eos> Paris.<eos> Rubbing shoulders with the best of them.<eos> How do you do, Countess?
Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> It's in connection with the Countess von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.<eos> Uh, what I want, Your Majesty... Well, it's a hard for me to explain exactly what I do want.<eos> Exactly what you want is the Countess von Stolzenberg-Stolzenberg.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How long have you two known each other?<eos> Three weeks, roughly speaking.<eos> Not too roughly, I trust.<eos> You, uh, love her, Mr. Smith?<eos> Yes, I do, Your Majesty.
Why'd you hurt him?<eos> He's a cop, that's why.<eos> Well, who are you?<eos> -Answer me! -Stop hollering, old man.<eos> Johnny Rocco, of course.<eos> Hot water.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> Johnny Rocco.<eos> -I know that name.<eos> -Sure, who doesn't?
It's better to be a live coward than a dead hero.<eos> You weren't afraid. We all know that.<eos> Oh, yes, I was afraid.<eos> But that's not why I didn't shoot.<eos> What do I care whether Johnny Rocco lives or dies?<eos> I only care about me! Me and mine!<eos> Rocco wants to come back to America, let him! Let him be President!<eos> I fight nobody's battles but my own.<eos> I can't see it your way, Frank.<eos> Sawyer didn't either.
- I'm the law. You're a thief!<eos> You too, Teeler.<eos> Anything more?<eos> I know what you're gonna do to us, but first I want to tell you something.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - You're crazy.<eos> You've been drinking and not sleeping. If you ain't crazy, you're close.<eos> - You through?<eos> You want to get this herd to market.<eos> So do all of us!
Who was it Gallagher sent you to see?<eos> I told you. Nobody.<eos> He gave you a message. What was it?<eos> There was no message.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You don't know much about anything, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I suppose you don't even know that Collins plans to break out of the drainpipe at 12:15 today, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Do you?
All the guys.<eos> I don't especially like the way I look sometimes but I never met a man since I was 14 that didn't want to argue about it.<eos> Sure.<eos> By the time Nick came along you were ready to marry anybody that owned a gold watch.<eos> Seemed the best thing to do from my angle.<eos> And as for him, I told him...<eos> - I told him I didn't love him.<eos> - He said that would come in time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - But it didn't.
You were gonna duck out and hand me over to Sackett, so we're even.<eos> Right back where we started.<eos> Not quite, Cora.<eos> That other girl she didn't mean anything to me.<eos> She told me you were going away with her.<eos> Why didn't I? I planned to, and never come back.<eos> Why didn't I go away and never come back?<eos> Because we're chained to each other, Cora.<eos> - Don't tell me you love me.<eos> - But I do.
Right you are.<eos> Ms. Vedder, I know all about you and frankly you're in for it.<eos> All I did was buy a coffin and bring it on the train.<eos> In my opinion this is a matter for Scotland Yard.<eos> Scotland Yard's jurisdiction ended when you crossed the border Inspector.<eos> So you say.<eos> That's a matter of opinion.<eos> Ms. Vedder's unquestionably in the plot.<eos> But you may not know Colonel Moran however.<eos> I don't.
My name is-<eos> You mustn't tell me.<eos> Why mustn't I?<eos> I mightn't like it.<eos> Gay, wasn't it? The crowd?<eos> If you like crowds.<eos> I don't.
That's right.<eos> Very well, then.<eos> But I better have a little talk with him. So long, Fallon.<eos> So long.<eos> Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> To tell me how much you miss me?<eos> How'd you know?<eos> What's on your mind?<eos> We need money.<eos> The devil you do!
Listen.<eos> There are things I never told women.<eos> They thought I loved them, or not. But I never said it.<eos> It was a game.<eos> I don't play anymore.<eos> I love you, Micheline.<eos> How many have you said that to?<eos> I never said it!<eos> You believe me?<eos> I do, but...
Go...<eos> We'll see.<eos> I see.<eos> You're here?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Daniel knows, Philippe.<eos> OK.<eos> I came for you, Micheline.<eos> I don't love you, Philippe.<eos> I never did.
Are you sure you asked for the painting of the windmill?<eos> Of course I'm sure.<eos> - Well, then why...?<eos> - Now, Edgar, calm down.<eos> We'll get it.<eos> Well, I don't like that flatfoot snooping around town.<eos> - We'll go down there now.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> Mister.<eos> Oh, how do you do?
Fr√©d√©rick is before you.<eos> I'll dust him off, and cast his shadow across the boards.<eos> He'll live again to astonish the world once more! Thanks to me!<eos> Go ahead and laugh.<eos> I won't end my days at the Funambules in a lion's skin.<eos> A lion who can't even roar.<eos> What torment, when inside you there's an entire orchestra, a whole universe!<eos> Words and phrases leave you cold.<eos> You tell your story without speaking.<eos> And you do it so well.
- Good evening.<eos> - Good evening, dear.<eos> Tomorrow, Dick, you'll go on the witness stand.<eos> You must remember that Quinton isn't just the prosecutor.<eos> You may rest assured he'll have his brass knuckles on.<eos> He'll throw the whole book at you.<eos> He'll ask you some questions that won't be easy to answer.<eos> One in particular.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Maybe we can rehearse some more.<eos> The second act.<eos> Curtain.<eos> Oh, hello, Jamie, I hope I don't interrupt your work.<eos> I hope I don't interrupt yours.<eos> This isn't work.<eos> - You said it, Dobbin.<eos> - Her name isn't Dobbin.<eos> - Maybe she wants a drink.<eos> - Who doesn't?
Most unusual, unless...<eos> Unless what?<eos> Never in my life will I understand American marriages.<eos> Will you have lunch in town with me next week, the usual place?<eos> If I'm in town.<eos> Would you prefer that I ask Pat this time?<eos> - What's funny?<eos> - You, and your primness.<eos> I'm glad you can laugh.<eos> Well, I do lots.
They're two of the dearest, sweetest old ladies that ever walked the earth.<eos> They're out of this world.<eos> They're like pressed rose leaves.<eos> The old girls must be kind of hard up.<eos> Their old man left them fixed for life.<eos> Don't you call them "the girls," either.<eos> Brophy.<eos> Is Lieutenant around?<eos> So what are they renting rooms for?<eos> They don't.
You know I'm not a swearing man.<eos> You'd be surprised what they'd consider swearing.<eos> Will you excuse me?<eos> No, no, Teddy, dear.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll go.<eos> -Come right in, Mr. Brophy.<eos> -Miss Abby, we came for the toys.<eos> This is Officer O'Hara. He's taking over my beat.<eos> -How do you do, miss?
Aged squaw gone down to bank to get more money.<eos> - And who are you?<eos> - Me Big Chief Rain-in-the-Face.<eos> Delighted to meet you, Big Chief.<eos> My name is Evelyn.<eos> How.<eos> Where's Uncle Big Chief?<eos> Big Chief no ketchum uncle.<eos> Big Chief ketchum father and grandpa, no uncle.<eos> - How do you do?
I can't understand it.<eos> - Back in the other room.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get over in the corner there.<eos> Keep them covered, Jim, while I work on these two guys.<eos> Now, somebody's been monkeying around with that explosive.<eos> Just who was it?<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - Certainly, I know, I...<eos> - No, I don't. I...
Glad to see you.<eos> Hi, Mac.<eos> Hello, Harry.<eos> Maybe it's a draft notice.<eos> Danny, it's from John Coudair.<eos> Who's he?<eos> He publishes that magazine that wants a...<eos> He wants me to come to the office tomorrow.<eos> What do you suppose happened?<eos> How did he ever...?
- I thought I heard a sour note.<eos> Baby! You were wonderful tonight.<eos> Oh, I beg your pardon. I mistook you for somebody else.<eos> - Glad to see you.<eos> - So sorry.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Busy little place tonight, wasn't it?<eos> - Yeah, wasn't it?<eos> One had to chop one's way through the upper crust, didn't one?<eos> Yeah, one did.
I'm shaking like a leaf. But it's straight down the line for both of us.<eos> I love you, Walter.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Sorry, Keyes.<eos> - What's the matter? Dames chasing you again?<eos> Or still? Or is it none of my business?<eos> If I told you it was a customer--<eos> Margie. I bet she drinks from the bottle.<eos> Why don't you settle down and get married, Walter?<eos> - Why don't you, for instance?
I laughed and turned around in chapel.<eos> Any proclamations for Sister Colette?<eos> I proclaim her for petting an animal.<eos> She'll sweep the chapel.<eos> I am guilty of interrupting a Sister.<eos> Proclamations for Sister Thomas?<eos> For petting an animal.<eos> Cease your proclamations!<eos> The Council doesn't understand your proclamations.<eos> Mother St John surely does.
That's all right.<eos> Oh, Stanley, I'm sorry.<eos> - You want them pressed?<eos> - Never mind, just get them dry.<eos> - Why don't you be careful?<eos> - Well, why didn't you knock?<eos> - I didn't know you were here.<eos> - Oh, knock.<eos> - Did you see him push me?<eos> - I certainly did.
- Bye.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> He seems like a nice young man. But I thought you were going to the movies with Catherine.<eos> Oh, I'll tell her I don't feel well or something.<eos> - Hello, Charlie.<eos> - Well... hello, Catherine.<eos> Hello, Shirley. - Hello.<eos> - This is Jack Graham.<eos> He's in town.<eos> - How do you do?
Everybody watch it very closely.<eos> Here it goes.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Hocus-pocus, bowlegged locust.<eos> What happens?<eos> It's gone!<eos> What do you know about that? How do you like that, huh?<eos> I wonder where it is now. I wonder where it could be.<eos> I think I know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Tomorrow afternoon. It's in the bag.<eos> What's wrong, dear?<eos> Aren't you happy for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, my love.<eos> Very happy.<eos> "A down payment.<eos> The rest will follow."<eos> Don't swindle me.<eos> The Mauvin Agency never does that.
They're perfectly ridiculous.<eos> You're right, someone's playing a joke.<eos> - It's funnier than you know.<eos> - You're going?<eos> - Well, J.D.<eos> - Mac!<eos> And Deb too, as I'm alive.<eos> My old friends Deb McIntire and Frank.<eos> My new friend Miss Beauchamp.<eos> How do you do?

I'm afraid we've got to send her away.<eos> She can't be with her mother.<eos> I took her to see Dr. Jaquith who was highly recommended by this Camille Beauchamp.<eos> Camille, I am still horribly in love.<eos> We have to dine now or we'll never get to the concert.<eos> I must see you.<eos> May I come to your house tonight?<eos> I won't stay but 10 minutes.<eos> I must talk to you.<eos> Yes, do.
About my automobile accident and the man who was with me.<eos> You said that he led me from one difficulty into another.<eos> A patient of mine who has a phobia about high places told me about an accident happening to a man and a woman in Brazil.<eos> She knew the woman's name only.<eos> She told me before I could stop her.<eos> - Who told you the man's?<eos> - Nobody.<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> Then you didn't know that Tina's father and I met.<eos> No, I didn't.
- I hope your filly wins, Col. Ogier.<eos> Bound to.<eos> It's vicious, and low and cruel.<eos> You're very desirable when you're angry.<eos> You think you're mighty clever.<eos> Putting Jack on an old tub, beaching him in Key West...<eos> Easy now, what really happened...<eos> What really happened was that you saw I loved Jack Stuart.<eos> - No, I didn't see that.<eos> - Oh, yes, you did.
- Why don't you shoot? - I can't.<eos> I'm scared of hitting one of our men.<eos> - Quit shoving.<eos> - Quit missing.<eos> Don't get up or I'll empty this pepperbox in you.<eos> Blistering blazes.<eos> - Capt. Phil, are you all right?<eos> - Yes, I'm all right.<eos> Only I want my legs two inches longer.<eos> LOXl: No, you don't.
Lipamani, so big.<eos> Malagani fish, so big.<eos> Is that so?<eos> As a civilized fisherman I would have stretched the truth at least a foot.<eos> Jane is right.<eos> Law good.<eos> Give Boy back.<eos> Soon, dear.<eos> Swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
It'll cost you plenty, though.<eos> -Okay, Doc.<eos> I'll give you a ring.<eos> -Good. Do that, Roy.<eos> And I'll make you a present of my fee for old times' sake.<eos> -Good night.<eos> -Good night, Doc.<eos> Roy.<eos> -I don't know, Mac, the--<eos> -Yeah, I do.
Why does he go to trouble to help strangers?<eos> He must have a reason.<eos> Maybe he likes Velma.<eos> She ain't married yet and likely not to be.<eos> -If you want my opinion--<eos> -We don't want it.<eos> -You got Velma upset talking like that.<eos> -All right. All right. All right.<eos> If you don't want him to look at your foot, you don't have to.<eos> Oh, but I do.
You, girl. Get up to your room.<eos> Have you no modesty left in you?<eos> Get up there.<eos> Get your hands out...<eos> My shoes. Find the shoes.<eos> Why don't you get yourjackets on?<eos> Mr Morgan?<eos> Sit down.<eos> This is my wife, Mrs Morgan.<eos> How do you do?
That reminds me.<eos> What about my laundry?<eos> I haven't any more shorts.<eos> Ann kind of took care of his things around the house.<eos> Little household things.<eos> One of the best housekeepers you ever saw.<eos> I suppose you're wondering about us.<eos> It's quite simple.<eos> I've known Ann for a long time and wanted to marry her.<eos> Still do, as a matter of fact, but, well, fortunes of war.
He ain't hisself.<eos> He's just mad cos I won't take his bossing. Now, Ben.<eos> You go cool off outside and leave us womenfolk together.<eos> - Good evening, Ben.<eos> - Howdy, Sheriff.<eos> - Ain't dancing, Mr Ragan?<eos> - You know the reason why.<eos> Can't you leave her alone neither?<eos> Thought you was supposed to be a-courting me, Ben.<eos> So did I.
- Shindel.<eos> I know this boy since his poppa and momma wasn't even married yet.<eos> The whole family is a little bit crazy.<eos> - $25,000 - can you imagine?<eos> - A dreamer.<eos> - Mrs Schwartz, Mr Zimmerman...<eos> - Let me handle this.<eos> He gave me a cheque.<eos> - If he says he did...<eos> - ...then he did.
I'd say the straightest way to go... would be from Cripple Creek here straight through to the Pacific.<eos> You expect our trains to fly over the mountains?<eos> No, sir.<eos> I expect your trains to go through here, Dead Man's Gulch.<eos> May I ask why you're so interested in seeing that this land is sold?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> So that I can get married.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> You own the land.<eos> - No, sir, but my grandfather did.
- Sure, sure.<eos> Did you hear what I said?<eos> I said I am taking the 9 o'clock...<eos> Oh, Bruce, I put it in here!<eos> Let her alone, will you, buddy.<eos> - Do me a favor...<eos> - Just answer one question.<eos> You don't want to come with me, do you?<eos> Answer me.<eos> You don't, do you?
They begin to think.<eos> That's bad.<eos> These stories are beautiful.<eos> Why, Connor, they're almost poetry.<eos> Well, don't kid yourself.<eos> They are.<eos> I can't make you out at all now.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought I was easy.<eos> So did I.
- I'm Van Slack, the Asst. District Attorney.<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> I thought perhaps...<eos> Well, of course, everybody knows your reputation...<eos> - but if you don't mind... - Not at all.<eos> Well, I'm a little confused.<eos> The lamp torn away, a glass of water knocked over.<eos> Seems to have been quite a struggle.<eos> But, nobody heard anything.<eos> Funny you didn't, Mr. Charles.
Awful! Just awful!<eos> Why?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> This war's stopped being a joke when a girl doesn't know the latest fashion.<eos> [LAUGHS] Oh, Rhett!<eos> But, Rhett, I don't know how I'd dare wear it!<eos> You will, though.<eos> And another thing, those pantalets!<eos> I don't know a woman in Paris who wears pantalets anymore.<eos> What do they--?
You'll find the draft from this window will give you a stiff neck.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Is something going on?<eos> It's just as I imagined it.<eos> It means everything to me, to come to Brookfield.<eos> I suppose you felt the same way.<eos> I'll get on. I know I will.<eos> Headmaster at Brookfield.<eos> That's something worth working for.<eos> Ever done any teaching before?

Not at all. It's a wonderful effort.<eos> Octave!<eos> Andr√©!<eos> Am I ever happy.<eos> I don't care about your flight, I'm glad to see you!<eos> -Is she here?<eos> -No.<eos> -She didn't come?<eos> -No.<eos> -She didn't?
Wasn't he pointing the other way?<eos> Of course, people do go both ways.<eos> Why, you did say something, didn't you?<eos> Are you doing that on purpose, or can't you make up your mind?<eos> That's the trouble. I can't make up my mind.<eos> I haven't got a brain.<eos> Only straw.<eos> How can you talk if you haven't got a brain?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But some people without brains do a lot of talking, don't they?
I'll cry for you...<eos> - Mother, I'm helping you to pack. - Thanks, darling.<eos> Sheba, get off Daddy's coat.<eos> You don't want to take this old thing along with Daddy, do you?<eos> - What old thing, dear? - This.<eos> Old thing?<eos> Heh.<eos> What do you mean, old thing?<eos> - Daddy never wears that coat.<eos> - Yes, he does.
I ate with Dolly Dupuyster...<eos> I know.<eos> You forgot she's writing a gossip column, and you told her something about me.<eos> Darling, you know I never give you away.<eos> - I told her about Stephen and Mary.<eos> - Oh, that. - It wasn't until I got here... - it'll be in all the dreadful scandal sheets.<eos> I know.<eos> I've been racking my brain to try and remember what it was I said.<eos> I think I said that Mary went into the fitting room and yanked the coat off the Allen girl.<eos> You didn't.
What's your name, friend?<eos> - John Little.<eos> What's yours?<eos> - Robin.<eos> - Not Robin of Locksley?<eos> - Aye.<eos> - Then I'm right glad I fell in with you.<eos> - 'Twas he who did the falling in.<eos> I wanted to see what you were made of.<eos> And I did.
Men, if you're willing to fight for our people, I want you. Are you with me?<eos> Aye!<eos> Aye!<eos> Then kneel and swear this oath.<eos> That you, the freemen of this forest, swear to despoil the rich only to give to the poor.<eos> To shelter the old and helpless, to protect all women, rich or poor, Norman or Saxon.<eos> Swear to fight for a free England.<eos> To protect her loyally until the return of our king and sovereign, Richard the Lion-Heart.<eos> And swear to fight to the death against our oppressors!<eos> We do!
Never mind how.<eos> I'm here and I know all about you.<eos> Nice layout you got here.<eos> - I'm glad you approve. - Sure.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Why didn't you tell us you was such a big shot?<eos> Here I think all along you was just a screwball.<eos> No wonder you were so leery about us finding out. I can't blame you.<eos> You intend exposing me to the police?<eos> - Me, do a thing like that?
-Hello.<eos> Don't know how you feel.<eos> You look terrible.<eos> It wasn't any picnic down in the cellar, with a lot of rats and dirt.<eos> Maybe you'll leave the rough stuff to me.<eos> Well, is it my fault if those apes of yours can't get the right man?<eos> -Did you put anybody after Sullivan?<eos> -No.<eos> -That's good.<eos> -You did that once too often.
Oh, you'll regret this, my good man.<eos> I am in communication with an American multi-millionaire.<eos> I have submitted to him a business proposition of such magnitude that the mention of 60,000 francs makes me laugh.<eos> Has he accepted?<eos> Well, he hasn't refused.<eos> I mailed my letter Monday.<eos> Well, you can wait for your answer in Apartment 53.<eos> I will not. Unless these rooms are vacated in one hour, we'll clear them by force.<eos> This is the Marquis de Loiselle speaking.<eos> Mr. Brandon? Oh, Mr. Brandon, how do you do?
I'm proud to carry his name.<eos> Thank you, ma'am.<eos> You may step down.<eos> One moment!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ma'am, when he was younger, was Roger de Vetheuil left-handed? - Or right-handed?<eos> You say you have evidence pertaining to the trial.<eos> With the parties' agreement:<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- How?<eos> With a centre parting.<eos> What will you say?<eos> I plan to be humble and thus obtain an audition.<eos> - What if they laugh?<eos> - At what?<eos> - You.<eos> - Me?<eos> Ir√©n√©e, I didn't mean to say...<eos> But you did!
- And it was!<eos> I awaited my chance and slipped in surreptitiously with a truck.<eos> - A fine debut in resourcefulness.<eos> - Well I wasn't born yesterday!<eos> I found the president's office and entered.<eos> He let you in?<eos> With open arms.<eos> He was expecting me.<eos> He said that?<eos> He did, he did.
Aren't you clever, Mr. Poppins?<eos> Where is he, Miss Jones?<eos> What's going on here?<eos> Welcome, Mr. Vanderhof.<eos> Come right into my office.<eos> - No, thank you, Mr. Blakely.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - Going?<eos> - Hello, Mr. Hughes.<eos> - How do you do?
- That's a very lovely picture.<eos> - Tony, I...<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Now look, phantom.<eos> Last night I informed that irate lady who was just in your office that I was going to marry you.<eos> I don't remember you telling it to me.<eos> Well, you didn't ask me.<eos> - That's right, I didn't.<eos> - No, but she did.
- This is the party that's been writing to me.<eos> - It's not me, Mr. Vanderhof.<eos> You see, the Internal Revenue Office...<eos> - That must be him now.<eos> - Doorbell's ringing again.<eos> - I heard the doorbell.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Want me to go?<eos> Pipe, pipe.<eos> How do you do, Mr. Kirby?
Oh, what a terrible man Oh, what a terrible man<eos> Dag-gummit, of all the consarned...<eos> What's the matter, farmer?<eos> Think you're sticking hogs?<eos> This dad-bitted boat keeps bouncing around under me, of all...<eos> - What you laughing at?<eos> - Him.<eos> - Well, don't laugh.<eos> - Why?<eos> Everybody else did.
You can't go, doc.<eos> If you walk out, where will Judy be?<eos> She won't be in jail, and that's where I'll be if I stay here.<eos> Besides, what can I do?<eos> - You've got to stop the examination.<eos> - Not today I don't.<eos> Are you a man or a mouse?<eos> You put a piece of cheese down there, and you'll find out.<eos> Well, it's been nice seeing you.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
We know everything, Mummy and I.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, how much milk does the cow give in a month?<eos> Mummy knows. I can count on my fingers.<eos> Fetch her some water.<eos> I know, I know. In camp I never grasped a word, but I understand her German.<eos> Ich... I... fetch... Wasser.<eos> Go see Mummy.<eos> A bit flea-bitten!<eos> I did my best.
Mr. Topper has gone. Gone?<eos> He didn't know. He didn't know?<eos> But that's ridiculous. Nobody can go away and not know where they've gone.<eos> Nobody can. Wilkins, after all these years, are you trying to be funny? No, madam.<eos> Mr. Topper went with a suitcase... in the contraption.<eos> He's left me.<eos> I'll never see him again.<eos> Oh, no, madam. He'll come back.<eos> If you'll pardon the liberty, madam, he'll come back... just to find out whether you've missed him or not whilst he was away.<eos> They always do.
The last the sheriff, the jailer, or anyone else saw of him was before the fire.<eos> I must insist on my question. Who proved that Joseph Wilson was in that jail at the time it burned?<eos> - The jailer threw the keys down.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> Isn't there the possibility the prisoner angled for those keys and escaped? - Are you ready? - We say that possibility exists.<eos> It's up to the state to prove it false.<eos> Is the state prepared to proceed?<eos> We call Katherine Grant to the stand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Where is the corpse of Joseph Wilson?<eos> The law is that the corpus delicti must be established at least by fragments of the human body or of articles known and proved to have been worn by the deceased.<eos> And in the absence of convincing proof of the corpus delicti I move this indictment be wiped off the records and the charges against these defendants be dismissed.<eos> I shall take the motion for dismissal under advisement until tomorrow and hear the state's arguments then.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen of the jury I have received an object which, if authentic must be considered as evidence in this case.<eos> As to its authenticity, I am not permitted to have an opinion.<eos> However, in order to present it to you I must take the witness stand.<eos> Mr. Clerk please swear me.<eos> Do you swear that you'll tell the truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Aw, Bill, not your watch.<eos> What's he saying, Bill?<eos> He wants my guns too.<eos> Don't give 'em to him.<eos> Don't give up your guns!<eos> What's he saying?<eos> He says he's got to take us to Yellow Hand first.<eos> He can't let us go unless Yellow Hand's willing.<eos> Well, you done it, didn't ya?<eos> Yes, I "done it," all right.
It's always a good idea to scout out the country one intends to go through.<eos> - Oh, that was lovely.<eos> - Cold.<eos> - Oh, it was not.<eos> - Hot.<eos> - It was just right.<eos> - Just right?<eos> Just right.<eos> Tarzan, stop!<eos> Tarzan, don't.
- What kind of cows do you keep?<eos> - Jersey.<eos> I thought so, they give the best milk.<eos> What do you feed them?<eos> Plenty of red clover, hay and bran mash.<eos> That's silly.<eos> The cows get all the grass they need now.<eos> The thing is not to let them run their feet off.<eos> - lf they want to, you've got to let them run.<eos> - Oh, no, you don't.
Go back!<eos> No!<eos> Get away!<eos> Frankenstein!<eos> Get away! Get away!<eos> Don't come near me!<eos> Get away! Don't!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Don't! Don't!
Choose your weapon.<eos> This is for you to give the signal to fire.<eos> - Are you ready, monsieur?<eos> Now look what you've done.<eos> You would sink so low as to try and shoot me in the back, you rat?<eos> - We've got to go now!<eos> - Not until I dispose of the body.<eos> I'm going to cut him up into little pieces!<eos> Go on!<eos> Oh, no, you don't!
We'll follow its trail.<eos> - Yes, bwana.<eos> Where's she heading for now?<eos> Straight through the waterfalls.<eos> That's the way we went before.<eos> - Through them?<eos> - Yes.<eos> All right, Saidi.<eos> I was afraid she wouldn't last long enough to get here.<eos> They always do somehow.
That was made by the skipper of a Norwegian bark.<eos> - He must have been kidding. - No, he wasn't.<eos> Listen, a canoe full of natives from this island was blown to sea.<eos> When the bark picked them, there was one alive.<eos> He died before they reached port, not before the skipper had a description of the island and got an idea of where it lies.<eos> - Where did you get it? - Singapore, two years ago.<eos> Skipper knew I'd be interested.<eos> - Does he believe it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> But I do. Here.
- No.<eos> - Now, now.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> I'm getting old, Richard.<eos> And for some time now, I've been thinking of resigning from the Army... retiring to my place in the country to finish my life... among my books, my paintings, my statues and my farm.<eos> It would amuse me to devote the rest of my days to- to her.<eos> To mould the real Lily just as you have this statue.<eos> To make her my masterpiece, just as I think you've made this yours.<eos> How could I give her to you, even if I wanted to?<eos> And I don't.
Now it's your turn.<eos> Let's see. I was out with some other students on a walking trip... and pretty soon we came to a dragon sitting in an automobile... who told us there was a magic pool in the forest.<eos> -And what did you do?<eos> -We went to the pool, of course.<eos> -And what do you suppose we saw? -What?<eos> Imagine!<eos> Half a dozen princesses taking a bath.<eos> -And what did you do when you saw him?<eos> -l told him to go away.<eos> -And did he?

I see.<eos> - Are things all right? - Yeah, for now.<eos> - You don't get a pension?<eos> - Sure, but nothing regular.<eos> Well?<eos> Well?<eos> Are you going to take me home?<eos> No, I better not.<eos> Mieze.<eos> How do you do, Mieze?
Excellent, Fr√§ulein von Attems<eos> Affinity has no place here<eos> That might lead to emotionalism<eos> Always love!<eos> Discipline is the main thing<eos> The German classics must be cultivated<eos> Fr√§ulein von Bernburg, I have noticed that you give very few black marks<eos> I've no need to punish the children, they obey me and learn well<eos> Indeed! And Manuela von Meinhardis?<eos> Yes... she doesn't do well.

I watched a bit of the rehearsal.<eos> You're in a position of trust. You're supposed to guard the artist entrance. You left to watch the show rehearsals?<eos> I'm not impressed with how you handle your job.<eos> You could be accused of being an accessory to the murder.<eos> Me?<eos> What do you have to say?<eos> I don't know. You asked so many questions.<eos> I don't speak as well as you.<eos> I didn't understand half of it.<eos> -You didn't? -No.
Most everything's ready, Captain Hollister.<eos> Listen, why don't you give up this plan and turn back?<eos> Why, there's no place to turn back to.<eos> Why, there isn't a home in all the South that wouldn't welcome the daughter of Colonel Cameron.<eos> True.<eos> But we can hardly become perpetual visitors.<eos> It's a tough proposition, girl, this pioneer life in a savage wilderness.<eos> We realize that, Captain Hollister, but we must keep the family together.<eos> Honey Girl wants to stay with her sister Ruth, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, I do.
It's a great pleasure.<eos> Just think.<eos> This wagon will be your home for the next six months.<eos> And after that, a cabin in the wilderness.<eos> My mind is made up, Mr. Thorpe.<eos> We're going with the settlers.<eos> You know my brother David.<eos> Yes.<eos> Hello, Dave.<eos> How do you do?
I'd kill a worm in a second, but there's something different about you... - and I don't like it!<eos> I hate dogs.<eos> Dogs?<eos> So that explains all the cats.<eos> What did the dog find out?<eos> Any other dogs spying around?<eos> Where are they?<eos> That's what I want to know.<eos> Tell me and I'll take good care of you.<eos> You will?
- That's nice.<eos> Have a good time.<eos> We were going to Florida next winter without the kids.<eos> Now they're going without me.<eos> OK, come on, boys.<eos> Good night.<eos> - One of us should stay.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> Suppose he tries something again.<eos> - He won't.
- Forward phasers locked and ready to fire, sir.<eos> - Fire phasers.<eos> Sensor sweeps reveal no other ships within range, captain.<eos> - Lieutenant Uhura?<eos> - No contact with Starfleet as yet, sir.<eos> Mr. Sulu, change course to 17, mark 4, warp factor 3.<eos> When I take this ship, I'll have Kirk's head stuffed and hung on his cabin wall.<eos> - They will kill us before we can act. - No.<eos> They wish to question us, learn our strength, our plans.<eos> - They never will.
- I have heard of you, but not as an expert on baccarat.<eos> well, I'm sorry you weren't told.<eos> Don't think that went unnoticed, Mr. Bond.<eos> I see everything that goes on at this table.<eos> - Nothing escapes me.<eos> - I'm quite sure it doesn't.<eos> But we mustn't forget that... (Indian accent) ...the beggar who is in the marketplace is completely deaf insomuch as far as listening to the song that is coming from the mockingbird is concerned.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. Bond, I don't get the connection.<eos> Ah!<eos> You will, you will.
- You got your mind right, Luke? - Yeah...<eos> I got it right.<eos> Oh, I got it right, Boss.<eos> Suppose you was to backslide on us?<eos> Oh, no, I won't, Boss.<eos> Suppose you was to back-sass?<eos> Oh, no, I won't. I won't.<eos> I got my mind right.<eos> You try to run again, we're going to kill you.<eos> I won't, I won't, Boss.
Wait for me here.<eos> I'm afraid I won't be long.<eos> Mad.<eos> Grau.<eos> Colonel Mannheim.<eos> What on earth are you doing here?<eos> You must be out of your mind.<eos> If the generals won't see me, I must come here to see them.<eos> Well, God help you, Grau.<eos> I won't.
Here you go, Dutchy.<eos> Thanks, Will.<eos> Least I can do after you killed all them Indians.<eos> Are you one of the men, his friends, who left him to the savages?<eos> - We surely did.<eos> - You call yourself a man?<eos> You call yourself his friend and then you do this to him.<eos> If I were you, I'd never speak...<eos> I would never speak to them again.<eos> Ja. Maybe I won't.
Well, if that's what you want, take it.<eos> I'll give it to you.<eos> I don't want you to give me anything.<eos> I'll stay on as sheriff long enough so I'll have enough money to pay for it.<eos> You'll get along all right wherever you are.<eos> You like the woman you live with.<eos> I wanted that for my son, but....<eos> Please, I've got to get out of here.<eos> Now, our marriage contract includes getting through a party for my father.<eos> And we will.
"After eating up a good many miles, they came to the Bayuda desert, which they had to cross to reach Khartoum.<eos> 'Not much shade!<eos> ' they grumbled, as they set out under a burning sun.<eos> 'We'd be better off in the shade of a glass of lager!"' Make up your mind or I'll hitchhike alone.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> A grease-job.<eos> Where are the toilets?<eos> Come on, Mimi.<eos> How'd you like to own a car like this?<eos> Well, you never will.
She'll understand.<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> Wait a minute, wait a minute!<eos> You don't understand!<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> You promised to take me to the beach but instead, you'd rather go out on someone's yacht.<eos> I was ordered to. lt's business.<eos> Then I will go with you.<eos> I am very good at business.<eos> Oh, no, you won't.
He's the best detective in London!<eos> - Well, it seems that Papa Marney... is goingto cause us troubleafter all!<eos> I'll takecareof the girl later.<eos> The most important part of theoperation is precise timing.<eos> I'll be informed... if the train is not on time.<eos> We'll stop the train at milestone 721.<eos> We takeover the Bakersvilleswitch house. From there, wechange the main signal.<eos> The timetableshows that the freight train should becomingthrough at 3:21.<eos> Theswitch house has only one man in it at midnight.<eos> Joyceand Edwards will takecareof him.
I received your letter,<eos> I came here because I wanted to speak to you too,<eos> Really?<eos> How long have you been in France?<eos> It doesn't matter,<eos> - So you know?<eos> - I do,<eos> I want you to understand properly,<eos> - Listen to me,<eos> - I won't,
- Would you like something?<eos> - No, nothing.<eos> Yes, a pharaoh could exterminate 5, 10 thousand people.<eos> From today's point of view, it's just a trifle, nothing.<eos> He loves me.<eos> He still loves me.<eos> I can see it now.<eos> Mitya, look at me.<eos> He won't.<eos> And Ilya will.
There really isn't any other love, is there?<eos> Another old friend?<eos> Go to your father, dear.<eos> You leave her alone.<eos> She doesn't want to.<eos> Can't you see?<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Does he own this place?<eos> Then I won't go.<eos> Oh, yes you will!
That means she's still my wife.<eos> Come on, honey, let's go home.<eos> She stays with us.<eos> Looks to me like you been having some trouble.<eos> Looks to me like somebody got their finger caught in the cookie jar.<eos> You're short-handed, old-timer, but she's all we want.<eos> All we want, provided we get her now.<eos> - You heard me.<eos> - We'll get her, sooner or later.<eos> Like hell you will!
Would you permit me to light a candle?<eos> I think you had better leave, Mr Winthrop.<eos> I think you need some light in this house, Mr Usher.<eos> Two pale drops of fire, guttering in the vast, consuming darkness.<eos> My sister and myself.<eos> Shortly they will burn no more.<eos> She cannot leave this house, Mr Winthrop.<eos> Believe that or not as you will, but she cannot leave it.<eos> For her own sake as well as yours, will you leave now, please?<eos> No, I will not.
- will you get to the boat?<eos> - I will go dancing.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> I'll meet you there with the motor.<eos> I will be over there...<eos> Five minutes ago!<eos> - thanks reverend.<eos> - good luck.<eos> - will we see ourselves soon?<eos> - of course. Of course we will, Evvie.
Take this.<eos> Don't get mad, all right?<eos> Isn't it a beauty?<eos> - It is pretty.<eos> - But you owe me 110 bucks.<eos> - What?<eos> - 110 bucks.<eos> Sad, little birdie?<eos> Hasn't he come yet?<eos> But he will.
Life is not merely a matter of breathing and a beating heart.<eos> - We've come a long way.<eos> - We got a long way to go.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> And perhaps not.<eos> We now know that at the peak of terror... The Tingler is a solid mass extending from the coccyx to the cervicals.<eos> If one could stand the pain without screaming... or otherwise releasing their tension until they died... an autopsy would give us a Tingler we could work with.<eos> The advancement of human knowledge is fine, but dying for it...<eos> If that's your attitude... we'll have to find someone else who's willing to die for science.<eos> And eventually we will.
That's the situation.<eos> " You can't make revolution with your gloves on," Lenin said.<eos> We can arrest Melekhov this night.<eos> - Why wait till the night?<eos> - People won't talk that much.<eos> Well, you know...<eos> it's a lot of nonsense.<eos> Send those over.<eos> I'll deliver Melekhov right away.<eos> Will you?
But I haven't done anything wrong.<eos> Why are you bringing me here?<eos> Nothing bad will happen to you here.<eos> - We have to find a place for night.<eos> - But you won't arrest me?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - I promise!<eos> - You will not arrest me.<eos> I will not!
in the presence of God and these witnesses and by virtue of authority vested in me by the laws of this state.<eos> If any of you know any reason why these two should not be thus joined, speak now or forever hold your peace.<eos> Will you take her hand, please?<eos> Do you, Thomas Winters, take this woman for your lawful and wedded wife?<eos> That's you, sir.<eos> Who sir, me sir?<eos> Yes sir, you sir.<eos> I do.<eos> Will you love, honour, cherish, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
Yes, I'm yours.<eos> Say it.<eos> I love you.<eos> Forever?<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> No, don't take anything.<eos> Well, well! I'm speechless.<eos> Did you know him before?<eos> Shut up, Maggy, and don't try to understand.<eos> You never will.
- Wait, Ksyusha...<eos> - Uncle Panteley!<eos> Why are you so gloomy, Grisha?<eos> It looks like it'll be raining. My back's aching.<eos> He just doesn't want to watch the oxen.<eos> Don't let the oxen spoil the neighbours' grass.<eos> Grisha...<eos> Grishenka...<eos> Your father will hear.<eos> He won't.
If you won't live with Natalya, clear out of here.<eos> And that's that! Just get out of here!<eos> I'll tell you something, too, father. Ann don't you get angry.<eos> She wasn't my choice. You married me off.<eos> I'm not stopping Natalya.<eos> If she wants to, let her go to her father.<eos> - Then you get out too!<eos> - The hell I'll do!<eos> Yes, go to hell!<eos> - I will!
That's the situation.<eos> " You can't make revolution with your gloves on," Lenin said.<eos> We can arrest Melekhov this night.<eos> - Why wait till the night?<eos> - People won't talk that much.<eos> Well, you know...<eos> it's a lot of nonsense.<eos> Send those over.<eos> I'll deliver Melekhov right away.<eos> Will you?
Here, get it!<eos> Mikho, stop it.<eos> It's not true!<eos> I'm scared of nothing!<eos> You'll get it now!<eos> Stop crying, Kato, you have no one to blame.<eos> Why are you teasing him?<eos> Don't cry, or I won't buy you slippers.<eos> Mommy, please buy me slippers!<eos> All right, I will, daughter.
I made the attempt, Your Majesty, but it became translated into anger.<eos> You're less of a knave than I thought, but very much more of a fool.<eos> [ Knocking ]<eos> Yes?<eos> Excuse me, Your Majesty. It's time.<eos> So soon.<eos> Bounine, I want you to wait for me here.<eos> This time it is a command. Will you?<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> I will.
What's wrong?<eos> I want to go back home like Agrandi.<eos> I don't like these people.<eos> - Come over here.<eos> - These people watch me. I'm afraid.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Calm down. - I don't like them.<eos> I wish to go home.<eos> I want to talk to you.<eos> - I will not...
Isn't that right?<eos> Right.<eos> You agree?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> What red-bIooded American boy doesn't?<eos> This red-bIooded American boy doesn't.<eos> Why not?<eos> In order to be fulfilled, you have to have a man.<eos> And it might be just possible that what fulfills you might not fulfill him.<eos> My man, it will.
You're not taking me to jail!<eos> You'll have to kill me first!<eos> Go ahead, shoot! Go ahead.<eos> Kill me, Copper! Kill me!<eos> - Go ahead! Kill me! Kill me!<eos> - Let's go...<eos> Hoodlum.<eos> Let go!<eos> I won't go to jail!<eos> I won't!
Why are you reading it? You said critics are idiots.<eos> They know as much about opera as I do about growing beetroot.<eos> Listen to this, Clement.<eos> "Despite his best efforts, he failed to outshine Eric Walter's flawless technique<eos> - and unique, unrivalled timbre."<eos> - Now you care for reviews!<eos> No, I'll keep it.<eos> Lohengrin tonight?<eos> Yes, but you can't sing after staying up all night.<eos> I will.
Don't give me that innocent look.<eos> I ain't said two words to her since I come back.<eos> Just cos' I sit here; you think I don't know what goes on.<eos> Not two words.<eos> I know plenty.<eos> Cut it out, will ya, Zosh?<eos> Cut it out.<eos> Take 'em down to that tramp if you wanna' make noise.<eos> Go on take 'em down to her, why don't you?<eos> Alright, I will.
I better go on ahead.<eos> - You fellas get there as quick as you can.<eos> - All right, Glenn.<eos> Practically a new tyre too.<eos> Helen, you don't look very well.<eos> I'm just fine.<eos> I'm just a little tired.<eos> And poor Glenn is up all night working on the arrangements and I have to sort of take care of the bookkeeping.<eos> Has the business manager given you the big financial statement yet?<eos> No, but I will.
The bleachers and everything.<eos> The full treatment.<eos> "Now, if any man can show just cause why these two...<eos> "...may not be lawfully joined together, let him now speak or else hereafter...<eos> "...forever hold his peace.<eos> "Do you, Ernest Sidney Gubbins, take this woman for your wedded wife?"<eos> I do.<eos> "Will you love, comfort, honor and keep her in sickness and in health...<eos> "...as long as you both shall live?"<eos> I will.

Who is this?<eos> - Harry Prebble.<eos> I'm taking you up on the suggestion you made this morning.<eos> Suggestion? What suggestion?<eos> When you were posing for me, remember?<eos> How about slipping into something comfortable like a few drinks and some Chinese food?<eos> I'm sorry, Mr Prebble. I... I think you made a mistake.<eos> We'll discuss my mistakes over those cocktails. What do you say?<eos> Hope in a cab and meet me at 'The Blue Gardenia'.<eos> All right. I will. Yes.
‚Äì The strings broke.<eos> I must go back to earth for new ones.<eos> Ha, sly fox!<eos> Just arrived and want to go back already?<eos> First marry one of my daughters.<eos> See how many I have?<eos> Then I'll let you go for new strings, if you wish.<eos> Choose the one you like best.<eos> Tell father you will marry me.<eos> But I won't!
Why won't it work?<eos> Somebody will stop us the minute we light a fire. They always do.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What do you say, Red Eagle?<eos> Well, let's tie him to a stake and scalp him! That's it!<eos> - You mean for real?<eos> - Sure!<eos> Can't scalp anybody unless you do a war dance first.<eos> Oh. Well, just a minute.<eos> I'll...
- I want to see her, Mark.<eos> - Do you think she wants to see you?<eos> I got something important to see her about, and then I'll clear out.<eos> Where can I find her?<eos> I'm afraid I can't tell you that.<eos> - What do you mean, you can't tell me?<eos> - All right, then. Won't tell you.<eos> - You want a steak, Marshal?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - Why won't you?
- Your bags will be right up.<eos> The light switch is here, if my memory doesn't fail me.<eos> Okay, Langford.<eos> I'll do it anyway.<eos> I'll get an annulment!<eos> - There's no annulment in Argentina.<eos> - I'll get it anyway!<eos> I will!<eos> I'll get an annulment!<eos> I will!
They're to put dead people in.<eos> I guess that was the first time I ever thought about Phyllis that way.<eos> Dead, I mean.<eos> And how it would be if she were dead.<eos> I saw Lola three or four times that week.<eos> One night we went up into the hills behind the Hollywood Bowl.<eos> I guess it sounds crazy, Keyes, but it was only with her that... I could relax and let go a little.<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> Not gonna tell me, huh?<eos> Of course I will, Walter.
But you have.<eos> You'll observe that on the train you had contact with a little British agent named Grayson.<eos> He gave you something, where is it?<eos> But I hardly even noticed the man.<eos> I wouldn't even had remembered him if I hadn't seen his picture in the paper.<eos> He disappeared or something.<eos> He's dead Miss Pattridge.<eos> Now will you tell me what I want to know?<eos> But I can't.<eos> You won't.
You weren't big enough.<eos> -Mother, you know what?<eos> -What?<eos> We're not the only deer in the forest.<eos> -Where did you hear that?<eos> -Thumper told me.<eos> Well, he's right.<eos> There are many deer in the forest besides us.<eos> Then why don't I ever see them?<eos> -You will, sometime.
There's nobody here but us.<eos> - Lightcap came here for a quiet summer.<eos> - Listen...<eos> No warrant, out!<eos> That's from the Constitution.<eos> - Well, not exactly in those words.<eos> - Nobody's here but us.<eos> And that's too many.<eos> Please leave, all of you.<eos> Yes, Mother, will you, please?
Dunno.<eos> Paying five now.<eos> They'll get two and a half cents just the minute we're gone.<eos> You know what that is.<eos> One ton of peaches, picked and carried for a dollar.<eos> That way you can't even buy enough food to keep you alive.<eos> Tell 'em to come out with us, Tom.<eos> Them peaches is ripe.<eos> Two days out and they'll pay us all five. Maybe seven.<eos> They won't.
We're getting out!<eos> Getting out? But how?<eos> - We'll make him sneeze!<eos> - Make him sneeze?<eos> Ohh, that will make him mad.<eos> Well, it's about time!<eos> - It won't work!<eos> - Hurry, Father! Climb aboard!<eos> -We'll never get by those teeth!<eos> -Yes, we will!
Before I select my next wardrobe, my dressmaker will give you samples.<eos> - Imagine you dictating what I should wear.<eos> - I don't care what you wear.<eos> For a circus pony, it's all right.<eos> I have my own troubles without your blouse between Matuschek and me.<eos> I sold as much yesterday as anybody else. For a rainy Monday three weeks before Christmas, 95.50 isn't bad.<eos> - Did you tell Mr. Matuschek that?<eos> - Yes. And what did he say? "Not to come in that blouse."<eos> - Tell him I won't.<eos> - I will!
- Are you?<eos> - No. I'm not.<eos> So long, Bonnie.<eos> Oh, Geoff!<eos> Geoff, I can't let you go.<eos> - This has got to stop.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I can't!<eos> - Come on now.<eos> - I won't...
She's got a witch's brain.<eos> I love her.<eos> I hate her.<eos> I adore her.<eos> That side of it you must know for yourself.<eos> But, my lord, permit me to caution you.<eos> Don't count too much on the loves of queens.<eos> Thanks, Schoolmaster Bacon, for that sound lecture and the sound advice.<eos> Which you probably will not take.<eos> Which I probably will not.
-Would you take us to see the Wizard?<eos> -The Wizard?<eos> The Wizard?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> But first I'll take you to a place where you can tidy up.<eos> Oh, thank you so much!<eos> We've been gone such a long time, and we feel so mess--<eos> What kind of a horse is that?<eos> -l've never seen a horse like that!<eos> -No, and never will again.
