That guy's in no shape to be dating anyone.<eos> Well, you don't know what he was like on his meds.<eos> Silas and his queen were together till about six months ago, I would venture.<eos> These photographs-- all taken over the last three years.<eos> There are none from last summer.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Maybe she's the one who broke up with him.<eos> Okay, look at this necklace.<eos> Maybe he gave it to her as a gift.<eos> She gave it back to him when they broke up.
The saying is thought to be an early derivation of the Serenity Prayer, which is commonly recited by... recovering alcoholics and drug addicts.<eos> Is that why you keep the photograph?<eos> As a gentle reminder of the prayer?<eos> Is this some kind of threat?<eos> No.<eos> No, there's nothing on earth that would make me reveal a secret of that nature.<eos> It's... it's just a-a...<eos> tip of the cap, you know?<eos> From one obsessive to another.<eos> Just an acknowledgment that the world we live in is so often too complicated for the rules we make to keep it orderly.
I got your nanny death text.<eos> So I'm wearing black out of respect.<eos> And also, I got my period.<eos> - Thanks, Sophie.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> - It is?<eos> You know, back in Poland when my nanny died, I was so heartbroken, I could barely eat her.<eos> You ate your dead nanny?<eos> Well, a goat's a goat.<eos> It doesn't matter what you name it.
Would you please think about our conversation?<eos> I need 24 hours.<eos> There is another solution, Valéry.<eos> The dissolution of the Assembly.<eos> A new election would give you the majority, without de Gaulle and Pompidou's ghosts.<eos> Michel...<eos> We'd lose that election.<eos> My advance on Mitterrand is not significant.<eos> The French aren't stupid.<eos> If a majority is needed for their new president, they'll give it.

I take it the victim's gun was found here?<eos> Yeah, by the first uniforms on the scene.<eos> However, different caliber than the casings we found on the floor.<eos> Figured Hauser tried to defend himself.<eos> Never got a shot off.<eos> I can assure you Mr. Hauser did not pull his gun in self-defense.<eos> At least, not at first.<eos> Rather, he was about to commit suicide when he was very rudely interrupted.<eos> The handgun was stored here in this drawer.<eos> Whoever removed it bothered to close the drawer when they were done.
And you'll give me lessons.<eos> Come back soon.<eos> And send postcards.<eos> I promise.<eos> - Goodbye, Clémence.<eos> - Goodbye.<eos> - Goodbye, Clémence.<eos> - Goodbye, sweetie.<eos> Mrs Clémence, what shall I do with your post while you're away?<eos> - Hold onto it.
Come on.<eos> What?<eos> Does everyone have to get involved in everything here?<eos> She's alright.<eos> Back to work.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Go on.<eos> The aubergine?<eos> Deseeded, so it's not squidgy.<eos> We could add sugar to caramelise it a little with the magret.
In fact I was wrong.<eos> You're irredeemable.<eos> There's nothing in you to be saved.<eos> I resign.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> That's right. You go! Go!<eos> You'd have sold it anyway, like your father's company!<eos> What?<eos> Your thyme crust is delicious.<eos> How do you make it creamy like that?
Hey, Ed.<eos> You actually decided to come, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your dad has a way of persuading people.<eos> If I can't understand that Mexican preacher, I can always take refuge in the good book.<eos> I don't know the good book by heart, but I'm pretty sure it also says,<eos> "Share thy booze."<eos> Where's my dad?<eos> He's down in the basement.<eos> He thinks he left his jacket here after he threw it at the bingo caller last night.
Who did this<eos> Father, what is it<eos> Wipe yourself<eos> This feels good<eos> Xilian, the wine has been warmed<eos> Don't drink too much, just one jar<eos> Drinking one or two jars makes no difference to me<eos> You're not in good health.<eos> Son, bring bowls and chopsticks<eos> That pan... Have you asked Wu Zhong-e to fix it yet?

Have you asked Wu Zhong-e to fix it yet?<eos> He's been waiting forever for you<eos> Must you bring up that nonsense every time?<eos> You nag me about drinking, I nag you about remarrying<eos> Uncle Mao, here<eos> Sweet Gou-er<eos> The pan still works, Gou-er will send it over when it breaks
That was the gift.<eos> The photograph.<eos> The wallet was just something I could put it in.<eos> So I put it in a little slot, the little picture holder in there.<eos> I thought it'd be cute.<eos> I told you, "Look inside."<eos> In the note.<eos> You said, "Look inside." I thought you meant, I thought you meant look inside of the wrapping paper.<eos> Well, you got a real nice surprise coming.<eos> No, I don't have it.

I-I thought it would be a playful kind of thing.<eos> Playful?<eos> I see what you're saying.<eos> With the cover, I should have been more straightforward.<eos> I mean, if you don't mind... what did you do with the wallet?<eos> Chucked it.<eos> Well, that hurts my feelings.<eos> No... man, I liked it very much.<eos> I appreciated it very much.<eos> So you threw it away?
They're your friends too.<eos> Give Jackie my love, say I call her.<eos> You know, I've meant to tell you I can't go to the country this weekend.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> How are Martha and the boys?<eos> Well enough, and Zoe?<eos> She's wonderful.<eos> I'm sorry, Kathryn, but I'm not comfortable with this.<eos> Why on earth not?<eos> I thought we discussed reducing the dose, not raising it.
I know.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Sweetie.<eos> How can I help you if you won't let me in?<eos> The world's too big, Mom.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Then make it small.<eos> Just, um focus on my voice.<eos> Pretend it's an island out in the ocean.<eos> Can you see it?

I was hoping I was wrong.<eos> Really?<eos> He stole this?<eos> Oh, God, I feel sick.<eos> You crooked son of a bitch.<eos> When were you gonna tell me about this?<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Just get it away from me.<eos> I don't want to see it.
This is crazy.<eos> Lily's not a dog.<eos> She's a beautiful little girl who I've grown to love.<eos> I love all these children, mama, even if they don't all love me.<eos> Lily loves you, too, Jody.<eos> And they belong in this world with me and Dan.<eos> Because they deserve parents who aren't decomposing. Good girl.<eos> All right, enough.<eos> Where's the page?<eos> Damn it, I can't find it.
It's like they were digging for something to use against you and expected me to help, as if I'd be out to get you because of the divorce.<eos> I was so insulted, I was so angry, and I said what they were doing was wrong.<eos> I may have even made some legal threats to them.<eos> I mean, you're a respected man in this city.<eos> You're not on trial here.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Thanks for telling me about this and for having my back.<eos> Here you go.<eos> My attorney said he sent you the agreement. I got it.<eos> I think maybe I misplaced it.

I got it.<eos> I think maybe I misplaced it.<eos> He can send another one.<eos> It's just that with all the paperwork in the case, you know, things get jumbled up. Anyway, I'll find it.
Because I say so.<eos> "Dear Mama, today is the Führer's birthday.<eos> "I wish it was mine.<eos> Maybe then you could come and see me.<eos> "I miss you all day long.<eos> "Sometimes, I think I see you in the street. "But it's never you.<eos> "My new mama is like a thunderstorm.<eos> Always rumbling."<eos> Hans, where did you put the flag?<eos> If we don't find it, it's going to look like we're saying something.
You're not getting enough sunshine.<eos> Yes, it's Ronin.<eos> I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.<eos> I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.<eos> You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.<eos> But don't worry, I've got a plan.<eos> When we were kids he wasn't so serious.<eos> Would you like to hear my plan?<eos> And he had the sweetest smile.<eos> Look, instead of a public ceremony, I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink. We grab a pod, bring it back to you.
If we don't get the Pod to Nim Galuu's, the forest will die.<eos> Let me grab my saddle.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't ask for your help.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it sounds like you could use a rider with my--<eos> Ability to absorb punches?<eos> The situation's desperate.<eos> Let's not make it hopeless.
We got an office.<eos> We got business cards.<eos> We got a poster.<eos> If I'm the Revolutionary Guard, that's nothing we couldn't have made at home.<eos> Six people's lives depend on this.<eos> It's not enough. lf we're gonna fool these people, it has to be big.<eos> And it has to have something that says it's authentic.<eos> I did a movie with Rock Hudson one time.<eos> If you wanna sell a lie... .<eos> You get the press to sell it for you.
- You don't know about my marriage.<eos> Our marriage...<eos> We're very, very much in love, OK?<eos> Just like you two.<eos> Listen, Patrick, she's gone.<eos> She's not around anymore. Nikki left.<eos> What are you doing, Dad?<eos> Excelsior. Excelsior.<eos> - (PAT SR.) What does that mean?<eos> - It means I'm gonna take this negativity and use it as fuel. I'm gonna find a silver lining.
They're in danger. Get them out now.<eos> Room service.<eos> I didn't order anything.<eos> Not even you.<eos> I've got some new information.<eos> Aren't you a little overqualified to be delivering messages?<eos> It's all part of the learning curve.<eos> And Q's afraid of flying.<eos> Of course he is.<eos> So whoever stole the list has already decrypted it.
He comes from the same place as Bond.<eos> The place you say doesn't exist.<eos> The shadows.<eos> It's not too late.<eos> We could turn back now.<eos> I wouldn't be so sure.<eos> They abandoned it almost overnight.<eos> He made them think there was a leak at the chemical plant.<eos> It's amazing the panic you can cause with a single computer.<eos> He wanted the island, so he took it.
- I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> - Hm.<eos> Now, where were you born?<eos> - Liverpool.<eos> - Can you describe it for me?<eos> Filthy.<eos> The air is choked with soot and the streets reek of freshly hurled chamber pots.<eos> The smell of urine permeates the air.<eos> Have you any experience with hypnotism, Barnabas?<eos> I find it very useful, yes.
Johnny, put the gun down.<eos> Let's see what Jake said.<eos> View ... I have talked with Sammy.<eos> Let's see what happened to Sandy.<eos> But now all is well.<eos> You can go to Simon for you.<eos> All is well.<eos> Turn off alone.<eos> - Put the gun down<eos> - Put it down.
I just would like to say that our son Victor is just crazy about the new teacher.<eos> Thinks he's great.<eos> My Cynthia has been asking all sorts of strange questions about things I've never even heard of.<eos> Shouldn't we at least give the man a chance to explain himself?<eos> Yes.<eos> Please come up, Mr. Menace.<eos> I think the confusion here is that you are all very ignorant.<eos> Is that right word, "ignorant"?<eos> I mean "stupid," "primitive," "unenlightened."<eos> You do not understand science, so you are afraid of it.
It's Millman who'll be put out to the change in arrangements.<eos> She's preparing a cold luncheon in the nursery just for the family.<eos> What?<eos> It's ready in the dining room, Mum!<eos> Mum!<eos> I thought Dolly would be down by now.<eos> Dolly doesn't do anything unless she wants to, no matter if half the county is kept waiting.<eos> You know that.<eos> The tortoise unexpectedly put in an appearance this morning.<eos> I'm surprised she hasn't given it away.
- Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Yes, it's a ritual all right, complete with live sacrifice.<eos> - Would that be Dolly or Owen?<eos> - It's whoever says I do.<eos> Can someone remind me which Bigham twin is which?<eos> Joseph says Tiger has a moustache.<eos> I was told once that Tony has a tattoo.<eos> Although, it's never been located.<eos> Kitty, it is up to you to find it for us.
Just a little, David.<eos> A little more.<eos> Go on, man.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - While you're there, David.<eos> Tom, are you all ready for church?<eos> The wedding is at 2:00.<eos> 2:00!<eos> Gosh.<eos> It's not too late to call it off, Owen!
That's exactly what I want to tell Dolly.<eos> Whatever next?<eos> Evelyn, my dear, can you bring Dolly's little bouquet to her?<eos> - lt's somewhere in the kitchen.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Time is ticking by, everyone.<eos> Very, very slowly.<eos> There you are, Horace!<eos> Such a beautiful day for Dolly's wedding!<eos> Have I missed it?
She sees everything.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Why weren't you at the church?<eos> I wanted to bomb the vicar with you.<eos> Got them off Bella's chauffeur.<eos> I can't see anything!<eos> I'm going to have to go, Jimmy.<eos> But light a bomb for me, won't you?<eos> Make it a whopper.
- Aren't they?<eos> - Owen seems a good fellow.<eos> - He is.<eos> I can't say I saw it coming.<eos> Mind you, I'm a dreadful judge of character.<eos> - I don't believe that.<eos> - It's quite true.<eos> My wife always said so.<eos> Female intuition is no longer a feature of my life, you see.<eos> I'm lost without it.
That's all very well, but I'm afraid not, Dolly, all the same.<eos> - Can't it eat dried peas or something?<eos> I don't think a tortoise...<eos> Owen, please stop hovering like that.<eos> It... I mean she likes to eat water biscuits. I know that for a fact.<eos> And these big liners are loaded with them.<eos> Well, that may be so, but if you will forgive me for doing so, I'm afraid I've told Millman we are not going to take the tortoise.<eos> You did what?<eos> It's vanished anyway.<eos> No one can find it.
Open the door!<eos> He's got a gun!<eos> Open the door!<eos> Help!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> We got to be able to get a card!<eos> We have to be able to get in there!<eos> What's happening?<eos> We gotta go for the back door.<eos> It's locked. He locked the back door.
okay-<eos> VIOLET: Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here she is.<eos> So, congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She got the job?<eos> Motherfucker! Shh!<eos> It's very exciting.<eos> How long do you think I have to decide, you know, whether to take it or not?
Here she is.<eos> So, congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She got the job?<eos> Motherfucker! Shh!<eos> It's very exciting.<eos> How long do you think I have to decide, you know, whether to take it or not?<eos> Sorry, I don't understand the question.<eos> Oh, the position.<eos> I'm just wondering how long I've got to decide on whether I should take it.

What a terrible idea, Robert.<eos> It's a terrible idea.<eos> - It's not a terrible idea.<eos> - Yes, it is.<eos> And you know what?<eos> it just couldn't be worse.<eos> Peter says you're ready for a new violin.<eos> He did?<eos> Start looking for one.<eos> Your mom and I will check it out for you.
I just wanna go to the bathroom and take a shower.<eos> Just one second.<eos> OK. I'll be right back.<eos> Where's your violin? - What?<eos> I need rosin. I can't find it.<eos> It's not by the couch?<eos> No, it's not there.<eos> It's not in the bedroom either.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Fuck, I left it at the bar.

: Can't believe this.<eos> When you asked me 25 years ago... to help you form a quartet, I understood what it meant to be so much older.<eos> I knew that one day I'd have to step aside.<eos> I simply never imagined it would be so difficult.<eos> And to watch the quartet evaporate in front of me at the same time, it's...<eos> It's not like anything.<eos> It's a nightmare.<eos> It's a nightmare for me, too.<eos> You must end this relationship right now.<eos> Whatever you think it is, whatever you think you're doing... end it.
What?<eos> My father put snow chains in the trunk.<eos> Here.<eos> Now you keep your goddamn mouth shut.<eos> Dad...<eos> Okay, good!<eos> They're easy to install!<eos> Bye!<eos> I gave him a pork shoulder.<eos> I put it in with his things.
Oh, God.<eos> You know, don't touch those, okay? Let's...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna just clean that up.<eos> Yeah, Donny's sick.<eos> You don't want to touch these 'cause you'll get sick.<eos> He's got post-nasal drip, so...<eos> The tissue's stuck to my picture.<eos> I'll grab that from you. I got it.<eos> Oh, look at that! There's a little tissue beard there. No, don't touch it, please.
Come on!<eos> "I love dick"?<eos> You think that's funny?<eos> "Wonder Years douche"?<eos> What kind of sick animal, draws an ejaculating penis into 8 year old mouth?<eos> Thought it'd be, like an airplane throwing up.<eos> You think I don't know about dick and balls? I know all about dick and balls.<eos> I partied with Robert Downing Jr, before got sober, we did really fucked up, and had a lot of fun.<eos> And you know what? From now on, you're gonna do some chores.<eos> You're gonna wash the laundry, you're gonna fold it, you're gonna do the dishes, you're gonna mow the lawn
When the mighty Jackals show up there in the morning, boom, boom, and bye-bye.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Lovelies.<eos> Do not think for a moment that I enjoy seeing you forced into any position.<eos> I have been exactly where you are.<eos> I do not make these demands of you lightly.<eos> Remember, there is a purpose.<eos> The power has always lain with men.<eos> Yet, it is essential to understand that power is not theirs by birth.<eos> The nature of power is that it belongs to no one until it is taken, seized.
No!<eos> Yes!<eos> King Christian the 7th, Ladies and Gentlemen.<eos> I hear there's a smallpox epidemic coming in Copenhagen.<eos> - What do you say, Struensee?<eos> - Let's hope it's a small one.<eos> You've charmed our entire nobility, Struensee.<eos> Perhaps we should acquire more?<eos> You have an interesting book collection.<eos> One day you have to tell me how you got it into the castle.
It's up to you.<eos> I'm having fun.<eos> Hi, Mom .. Mother ... Can I go out?<eos> Right, you should not go anywhere.<eos> There is always a way out, we look lived alone.<eos> Oh yeaah.<eos> What is it?<eos> Yuuki ...<eos> Your brother brought gifts.<eos> - - Let me see, where is it?
Sit.<eos> No.<eos> I said sit down.<eos> She said, sit down, asshole.<eos> Thank you, boys.<eos> Listen, fish, here are the rules.<eos> You can slap a girl but you can never hit her.<eos> Boys are fair game.<eos> You steal, you get your ass beat... badly.<eos> You want a cigarette, you pay for it.
I don't know.<eos> What do you have in mind?<eos> I have Ben's job now.<eos> And a shitload of cash.<eos> You wanna play now?<eos> So if you can pull it off, we both get what we want.<eos> I have to admit, Junior.<eos> It's a good fucking idea.<eos> Okay.<eos> My mind is evil as it twists.
It's about feeding the ego of whichever society hag laid this on.<eos> Actually, this is my party, Mr. Wayne.<eos> Oh.<eos> And the proceeds will go where they should, because I paid for the big fat spread myself.<eos> That's very generous of you.<eos> You have to invest if you want to restore balance to the world.<eos> Take our clean-energy project.<eos> Sometimes the investment doesn't pay off.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You have a practiced apathy, Mr. Wayne. But a man who doesn't care about the world doesn't spend half his fortune to save it.
I'm trusting you.<eos> Doesn't count.<eos> You have no choice.<eos> I could have flooded this chamber at any time. I'm choosing to trust you.<eos> Please.<eos> All right, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> This meeting will now come to order.<eos> I'd like to point out that we have a non-board member here which is highly irregular, even if his family name is above the door.<eos> Bruce Wayne's family built this company.<eos> And he himself has run it.
But then he exiled him instead.<eos> The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release.<eos> But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom.<eos> She took his place in the pit.<eos> And she was with child the mercenary's child.<eos> Innocence cannot flower underground.<eos> It has to be stamped out.<eos> One day, the doctor forgot to lock the cell.<eos> But the child had a friend a protector who showed the others that this innocence was their redemption.<eos> It was to be prized.
- Can we break them out?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Take out the mercenaries south of Ackerman Park. Blow the rubble, make a hole big enough for 10 at a time.<eos> I'm in contact with my partner who's down there.<eos> They're just waiting.<eos> - Men who haven't seen daylight in months?<eos> - Officers who haven't seen daylight in months.<eos> What about the bomb?<eos> Satellite can't pick up radiation hot spots.<eos> They keep it on a truck.
Came upstairs looking for a vantage point.<eos> Found the people who run the corporation.<eos> What corporation?<eos> Wayne Enterprises.<eos> You good?<eos> Mr. Fox, would you like to brief the captain?<eos> Miss Tate's fully aware of the situation.<eos> And as CEO of Wayne Enterprises, I have to take responsibility for it.<eos> - Why?<eos> - We built it.
You built the bomb?<eos> It was built as a fusion reactor.<eos> First of its kind.<eos> Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor.<eos> - Here's the important part.<eos> - As the device's fuel cells deteriorate it becomes increasingly unstable to the point of detonation.<eos> This bomb is a time bomb.<eos> And it will go off in 23 days, regardless of Bane's revolution or what we, or the outside world, choose to do.<eos> So your plan might not be as practical as you thought.<eos> - Could you disarm it?
Why do we fall?<eos> You do not fear death.<eos> You think this makes you strong.<eos> It makes you weak.<eos> Why?<eos> How can you move faster than possible fight longer than possible without the most powerful impulse of the spirit?<eos> The fear of death.<eos> I do fear death.<eos> I fear dying in here while my city burns.<eos> There's no one there to save it.
But I still think there's more to you.<eos> In fact, I think that for you this isn't just a tool.<eos> It's an escape route.<eos> You want to disappear. Start fresh.<eos> - I can't even get off this island.<eos> - I can give you a way off once you get me to Lucius Fox.<eos> Find out where they're holding him and take me in.<eos> Why do you need Fox?<eos> - To save the city.<eos> - Who says it needs saving?
Let's do it.<eos> Find this one a spot, got a big day tomorrow.<eos> We all do.<eos> It's not every day you bag Bruce Wayne.<eos> - Bruce.<eos> - You okay?<eos> Picked a hell of a time to go on vacation, Mr. Wayne.<eos> How long until that core ignites?<eos> - That bomb goes off in 12 hours.<eos> - Unless we can reconnect it to the reactor.
I gonna hear it for us I praying' for you.<eos> Old Georgie's hungering' for your soul.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Spit a cuss on your dreams.<eos> "Bridge broken, hide below"<eos> "Hands are bleedin', can't let go"<eos> "Enemy's sleepin', don't slit that throat"<eos> An augurin'...<eos> Trust Sonmi...<eos> Keep her warning' with you, nail it to your memory.
Last week Jocasta and I became lovers.<eos> But don't alarm yourself, it is only a carnal act, performed in service not unlike my role as amanuensis.<eos> And I confess women's hearts like their desire remain a mystery to me.<eos> Afterward, she cried and thanked me for bringing life back into their home.<eos> Making it clear that Vyvyan had been there the entire night, between us like the silence between notes, that holds the key to all music.<eos> Best news of all<eos> I've started my own work.<eos> I called about an old recording written by a man named Robert Frobisher.<eos> Oops. Busted.<eos> I know I shouldn't be playing it.
Everyone who's given up and given in, they're living at the expense of what they once believed.<eos> You understood this.<eos> I'm sorry you've forgotten.<eos> I wish I had forgotten, because my problem is I can't stop remembering.<eos> So if you've built a wall so high, more power to you. - You're stronger than I am.<eos> - I will turn myself in... the day the politicians and corporations turn themselves in for all they've done.<eos> Stop hiding behind your fucking revolutionary rant.<eos> - Oh, don't turn it on me.<eos> I see the same person.<eos> I see it, kid.

Even if I don't make it...<eos> Stop it.<eos> Attention, Tributes. Attention.<eos> Commencing at sunrise, there will be a feast tomorrow at the Cornucopia.<eos> This will be no ordinary occasion.<eos> Each of you needs something desperately.<eos> And we plan to be generous hosts.<eos> Your medicine.<eos> You're not going alone. Yeah?<eos> You need it, and you can't walk.
Draw another circle with the market in the center.<eos> Okay. Do the circles intersect at any points?<eos> No.<eos> Now, take one of those little cans, the ones with the pins on the top.<eos> It's a grenade.<eos> I want you to go to the balcony with the grenade.<eos> Is there a safe place you can throw it?<eos> There's a parking garage. Anyone on it?<eos> No.<eos> I want you to pull the pin out of the grenade... count to three so I can hear it, then toss it as far as you can.
Set off another grenade.<eos> You're close.<eos> I want you to keep moving east.<eos> Count to 30 and then set off another one.<eos> One, two, three... 18, 19... 26, 27... 28, 29... 30.<eos> Go out and check what's going on.<eos> Kim.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look for a white cloud of steam.<eos> I see it.
So when you're ready, if you're ready, you call me. Okay?<eos> And sign here and here.<eos> There?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And initial here, sign here.<eos> -Here, sign, and here.<eos> -l like that tie.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> is it made out of organic mung beans?<eos> No, actually, I found it digging through your trash.
I believe you've only just returned from your posting in North Africa.<eos> You were in Algeria?<eos> Yes.<eos> Charles and I were first there together... five - five years ago?<eos> He was a little thinner then.<eos> Where were you garrisoned?<eos> I was garrisoned at the frontier.<eos> Very edge of the Sahara.<eos> I once heard a very foolish story about the desert.<eos> May well be a myth but I find it rather romantic.
- Just listen to them, Georges.<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out of my house!<eos> Listen to them, Georges. Just listen to what they have to say!<eos> I am going to ruin you.<eos> Don't be a child. Consider your best interest.<eos> There's still money to be made.<eos> You think I've robbed you?<eos> You're not my responsibility.<eos> The opportunity was there for anyone who had eyes to see it.
Georges?<eos> I've been such a fool.<eos> Why do you come back to me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Perhaps because you never expect me to.<eos> I am sorry I hurt you.<eos> It is worth saying.<eos> I've never seen such a host of bucktooth cretins.<eos> Every one a noble bankrupt. All here for Suzanne and her 30 million francs.<eos> Open this door or we will force it!
- Would you mind telling me what rap is?<eos> - Tell me what opera is.<eos> No, yes, uh, well, yes, I will...<eos> I will eventually.<eos> No, you tell me what rap is and then I'll tell you what opera is.<eos> How about you tell me what opera is and then later on I'll tell you what rap is?<eos> There you go. What can I do?<eos> Uh, well, you know, originally, it was people just like you went to the opera.<eos> Casual clothes, they took food, they took alcohol, they threw things.<eos> Anyway, that was a long time ago that rich people took over the world of opera with their fancy dress, and they took the soul out of it - they made it something that it's not.
But I have an important meeting now. Do excuse me.<eos> - Oh, shut up! For... sakes, shut up!<eos> And you could persuade Jean to sing.<eos> It's only one gala, Reggie.<eos> Why don't the three of us ask her out to dinner?<eos> - Well done, Reggie.<eos> - Oh, Reggie! - Thank you.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> No, I'll, uh...<eos> I'll write her a little note, Cissy, and perhaps you will be good enough to deliver it.
Well, I'm just saying, it's improbable that somebody would wanna walk down the stairs with one slipper.<eos> Well, it's late at night, she wants to go to the bathroom, she forgets her slipper.<eos> She's disoriented, you know?<eos> There's only one point of impact and it's severe enough that she fell from a 12-foot height, not rolling down the stairs.<eos> You're right.<eos> What are you on, Twitter?<eos> Put the phone away.<eos> I mean, it's within the realm of possibilities that she might have been thrown.<eos> Right?<eos> "Now that the apartment across the hall is vacant "I would like very much to discuss purchasing it for myself.
As you can see, we're directly over Columbus Circle, which by the way, is the exact point from which all distances to and from New York City are officially measured.<eos> The owner completely renovated and refurbished the entire unit with all the latest and greatest amenities.<eos> Top-of-the-line kitchen by Pedini.<eos> There's only two units on the penthouse level.<eos> Twenty-four-hour doorman, concierge.<eos> It's a full-service building.<eos> And we are getting another offer later today, so... I think you guys are the right fit.<eos> If I were you, I'd make a move.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I love it.
Of course the police were here, Abby.<eos> And that doesn't bother you?<eos> The police were here because Hilary died.<eos> She had a fall and they're investigating her death.<eos> You live across the hall, so of course they're gonna inquire if you heard anything suspicious.<eos> Once they deduce that her death was an accident, which it most certainly was, they'll have no need to bother you any further.<eos> One of the detectives left me his card.<eos> Ray, how many wallets have I bought you through the years?<eos> Abigail, I'm attached to this.<eos> It was a gift from your mother on my first day of medical school.
You can't buy the god-damn chapel.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Contact the principals.<eos> I thought you'd be thrilled about the painting. One painting.<eos> You don't have a important Rothko and you've always want one, we've talked about this!<eos> How many paintings in this chapel?<eos> I don't know. 14? 15?<eos> If they're selling the chapel, I'll keep it intact.<eos> Tell them!<eos> Keep it intact?
I don't know. 14? 15?<eos> If they're selling the chapel, I'll keep it intact.<eos> Tell them!<eos> Keep it intact?<eos> Where?<eos> Tell them!<eos> In my apartment there's sufficient space.<eos> I can make more space.<eos> The people need to see it.<eos> Let them buy it.
He made a comment about the economy that may have been misconstrued.<eos> The whole country is now analyzing the grammar and syntax of this comment.<eos> Or it wasn't even what he said, it was when he paused.<eos> They're trying to construe the meaning of the pause.<eos> It may be deeper even than grammar.<eos> He may be breathing.<eos> So the whole economy convulses because the man took a breath.<eos> You gripped the water bottle.<eos> Yes, it's that soft type plastic.<eos> You grip it.

You have to understand.<eos> The more visionary the idea, the more people it leaves behind.<eos> This is what the protest is all about.<eos> Visions of technology and wealth, the force of the cyber-capital that will send people to the gutter to retch and die.<eos> What is the flaw of human rationality?<eos> What?<eos> It pretends not to see the horror and death at the end of the scheme it builds.<eos> This is a protest against the future.<eos> They want to hold off the future.<eos> They want to normalize it, keep it from overwhelming the present.
I had a gun, but I threw it away.<eos> But why?<eos> I didn't want to make plans.<eos> I wasn't thinking ahead.<eos> Didn't want to take precautions.<eos> You know how that sounds?<eos> How does it sound?<eos> I thought you were some kind of big shot that destroyed people in a blink of an eye.<eos> But you sound pretty iffy to me.<eos> This is Mike Packer's kid that had a gun and threw it away?
You ridiculous man.<eos> Now, what do we do about your dear, dear, gun-toting father?<eos> I've been thinking about that.<eos> We'll tell him at my birthday ball, in front of all of Baltimore.<eos> If I were a better man, I'd forbid it.<eos> - But you're not. - I know.<eos> I found some possibilities for you, Inspector.<eos> All are gruesome, if you ask me.<eos> "A careful search soon brought to light the hidden spring."<eos> "I pressed it, and, satisfied with the discovery," "forbore to upraise the sash."
I think I was overly harsh with you the other day, and for that I'd like to apologise.<eos> My wife was singing at the piano when she first coughed up blood.<eos> I prepared myself for the worst, but Virginia seemed to recover, and foolishly I succumbed to hope.<eos> But by year's end the blood came again... and again.<eos> Great effusions of blood.<eos> Raging fevers, her sheets spattered with crimson, drenched with sweat.<eos> I often thought I could hear the sound of darkness as it stole across the horizon rushing towards me.<eos> But here I...<eos> I was overwhelmed by a sorrow so poignant, when she finally died I felt in all candour a great release.<eos> But it was supplanted by the return of that dark and morbid melancholy that followed me like a black dog... all my life... until I met Emily.
- I don't understand.<eos> - It's been rained on.<eos> - It rained last night before dawn.<eos> - But the newspaper is bone dry.<eos> I'm not sure what...<eos> The paper was delivered later, after it stopped raining.<eos> This note was written in response to what I wrote in this newspaper.<eos> He delivered the note before the paper.<eos> So he knew the story in advance.<eos> He'd already read it.
We were forced to put it down.<eos> -So nothing got out?<eos> -Only a stray bullet.<eos> -And the test subject?<eos> -Flash-burned.<eos> Will that be all?<eos> A few things to attend to.<eos> You could imagine.<eos> Doctor, we received an anonymous call that something else escaped through a window.<eos> Detective, our mission at Antigen is to develop ways of preventing infection, not releasing it into the general population.
There's your cue.<eos> Copy.<eos> They're using silver-nitrate gas.<eos> Bombs on all the floors.<eos> It's Subject 1.<eos> We need to evacuate.<eos> Fine.<eos> Start a propofol infusion.<eos> We're not canceling this procedure, understood?<eos> We're moving it.
Are we going back in?<eos> We are.<eos> What is it?<eos> Michael?<eos> The roof.<eos> Though the world has changed, our enemy remains the same.<eos> The Lycans will rebuild.<eos> And will hunt for her father as they did for her.<eos> But as they grow stronger so will we.<eos> The Vampire coven will not only survive this world we will reclaim it.
Danny, it's all good.<eos> I know this guy, come on.<eos> You have one new message.<eos> Hey, fuckhead, I'm watching your sister's kid play soccer.<eos> You don't call me back, I'm gonna walk out on that field and put a bullet in his head.<eos> Chris.<eos> Don't...<eos> Stop talking.<eos> Like I said, I want you to take the buy money and go to that address, and talk to a gentleman named Ruben.<eos> If you ever want to see your little nephew again, you take the package and you bring it back, all right?
My story can never be told.<eos> I write it over and over wherever we find shelter.
My story can never be told.<eos> I write it over and over wherever we find shelter.<eos> I write of what I cannot speak the truth.<eos> I write all I know of it and then I throw the pages to the wind.<eos> Maybe the birds can read it.

"<eos> It's just a scrap, like you say.<eos> But there's a story there.<eos> You can feel it.
May I try one?<eos> One was midshipman Darvell.<eos> Here.<eos> Pearl for a pearl.<eos> And the other, his superior, was captain Ruthven.<eos> May I offer you a ride?<eos> She's only a child, Ruthven.<eos> She knows how to ride, I dare say.<eos> Don't go with him.<eos> The pearl stays pure forever while the oyster's flesh rots around it.
- No, she's, um... busy.<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> It's Claire's business.<eos> She saves girls from the streets.<eos> The thing is, Noel, Eleanor's written a story and in her story, she says that she lives with vampires.<eos> So can you please pass this letter on and tell Claire that if I don't hear from her today, then I'll be in touch with social services and the police.<eos> Shit...<eos> So Darvell gave the map and passage to your mother?<eos> No, to captain Ruthven.<eos> My mother saw her chance and took it.
- Hello again, Ella.<eos> Seriously, you can try if you like.<eos> I was hoping to arrange a more official meeting, ideally with the school counselor and with Eleanor herself.<eos> Well, what's the problem?<eos> 'Cause, you know, usually she sails through school.<eos> Well, um, Eleanor wrote her life story and uh, she's quite insistent that it's true.<eos> I don't expect you to be flattered by this, but in it she describes you as a soucriant, which I believe is a sort of vampire.<eos> Well, she has got a great imagination.<eos> I hope she gets top marks.<eos> Who else has read it?
If you could have anything, what would it be?<eos> Your pardon?<eos> In time.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Your company, then?<eos> We have time.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Don't be.<eos> I am Eleanor Webb.<eos> I throw my story to the wind and never will I tell it more.
How much you want for the guitar?<eos> I'll let it go for $700.<eos> Pretty decent.<eos> Pay him.<eos> I don't have $700.<eos> Didn't your mama leave you with some money?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Twenty bucks for the whole summer.<eos> You're a tad light, kid.<eos> But I want it!
What am I supposed to do with that?<eos> Dig it out.<eos> The whole thing?<eos> Yep.<eos> That will take all summer.<eos> Probably.<eos> Most likely.<eos> I would think so.<eos> Yep. You want that guitar?<eos> That's how you'll get it.
Thank you.<eos> Oh, Mr. George, Mr. George.<eos> Oh, hey, Param, I'm just....<eos> Last week you said you were gonna get me the security deposit.<eos> I did, that's right.<eos> By the way, did your son like the soccer jersey?<eos> Yeah, thank you, but you know the security deposit....<eos> -l'm on my way to the bank right now.<eos> -But it's been two weeks.<eos> -Yeah, yeah, don't worry. I'm on it.
But why not?<eos> A big sacrifice.<eos> Only buy what we absolutely need.<eos> A type of Lent, but this will attest to our faith.<eos> And it will humble Calles.<eos> Hello, Jose.<eos> It seems Dr. Limón has lost his watch.<eos> Have you found anything while you've been sweeping?<eos> No, Padre.<eos> He must have lost it somewhere else.
Today is the day that you are really gonna save someone.<eos> Please.<eos> If you are lying to me about any of this. I'm gonna push you off myself.<eos> Watch him.<eos> You got a little to comfortable to bark at us.<eos> Wassup?<eos> How he's doing?<eos> Hasn't kill him yet.<eos> What does he talking?<eos> You know, Mikey ... One day you you gonna stick your dick, in the wrong door, and someone's gonna slam it.
What?<eos> What is this in aid of?<eos> An experiment.<eos> - An experiment.<eos> Good.<eos> What is it to demonstrate?<eos> - If we knew that, it wouldn't be an experiment.<eos> We have seen that such eels can give off galvanic shocks that can knock you out or kill you.<eos> What a strange force this electricity must be.<eos> We cannot measure it, there are no formulas, but feel it we can.
Come on now.<eos> Do something useful.<eos> Go find that man and kill him.<eos> I don't wanna see you till it's done.<eos> Why don't we just kill that lunatic?<eos> Because he's my brother.<eos> Hold on, nearly there.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> You need to look around and you should see a sealed port.<eos> - You got it?

Okay.
Here's an apple. And a gun.<eos> Don't talk to strangers. Shoot them.<eos> This is the plan you agreed on with my father?<eos> Yeah, he said it'll toughen you up. Apparently, you need that.<eos> Well, I'm sure I'll be fine.<eos> I've got a hot date.<eos> It's been a real slice, so good luck.<eos> And good luck with the leg thing.<eos> Okay, the map.<eos> You gotta flip it. It's upside down.
Well, talk to me in another four.<eos> David, I'm dying here.<eos> What's happening with the post in Paris?<eos> One slot, 37 applicants.<eos> Every one of them with more field experience than you.<eos> How am I supposed to get more experience?<eos> I'm staring at four walls all day.<eos> I got passed up on Rome, then Berlin.<eos> You said yourself, my evaluation was excellent.<eos> Just put it in front of Whitford.
Well...<eos> David Barlow can't be held responsible for what happened to the safe house.<eos> We just don't need the scandal.<eos> But, sir, you and I both know that, that is just not the truth.<eos> People don't want the truth anymore, Matt.<eos> It's too messy.<eos> Keeps them up nights.<eos> I'll tell you what I am willing to do, though.<eos> I think the Agency has grossly underestimated you, and I'm recommending you for a senior case officer position.<eos> Provided you still want it.
Yes, he d d.<eos> Thanks.<eos> If I call a contractor though, we'll wait at least two months.<eos> You think?<eos> The Frodons waited three days when theirtoilet was blocked.<eos> Not exacty pleasant.<eos> The saltcellar's empty.<eos> I don't know if he'll br ng the CD today.<eos> Perhaps he won't come at all.<eos> We cou d go to Virgin th s afternoon and buy it.
Did you know about my dad's affair?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I knew.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> There were so many times that I almost did.<eos> But to drive you away from your family again?<eos> That just felt wrong.<eos> I wanted your love, I...<eos> Just not like that.<eos> I wanted to earn it.
Well, I suggest you get back there as fast as you can.<eos> There's a war coming.<eos> A war for the soul of the country.<eos> Going to be all colors of blood spilled.<eos> Our nation was built on the backs of slaves.<eos> Their labor, their blood.<eos> More blood than you could possibly imagine.<eos> I have seen this horror of the South firsthand.<eos> I say the need for peace outweighs the needs of the Blacks.<eos> I say that if the people of this great nation want slavery... then let them have it.
Are you crazy?<eos> It can swamp us in one second.<eos> - They are sacred in Vietnam.<eos> - They call it "Ca Ong".<eos> Mr. Fish.<eos> Bengt, camera!<eos> Here it comes.<eos> Look at that!<eos> - Bengt Where's the camera?<eos> - I am loading it.
We want out of the dope business.<eos> It's become a bit of a drag.<eos> We want to do something different.<eos> Such as?<eos> Such as clean, renewable energy.<eos> You mean sun, wind, ethanol? Shit like that?<eos> There you go.<eos> What do you have to say?<eos> Me?<eos> I think, basically, you want us to eat your shit and call it caviar.
Lado!<eos> You come to my house?<eos> You threaten my daughters?<eos> You don't think I'm the kind of guy that doesn't have cameras all over the place?<eos> It don't matter to me.<eos> After I whack you and your daughters, I'll burn the house down.<eos> Come on, you found your fucking snitch.<eos> You found him.<eos> What happened to your hand?<eos> Got it caught in a weed whacker.
I thought you loved that stuff.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> Because it looks like we live in a frat house, Jeremy.<eos> - Oh, stop it.<eos> - We are adults, for Christ's sakes.<eos> We make a decent living.<eos> I think it's time to invest and make this a real home.<eos> With matching dishes and glasses and a new couch.<eos> Well, what's wrong with my couch?<eos> Baby, you pulled it out of a dumpster.
- No, I'm really not.<eos> Your aunt who tinkles when she laughs?<eos> She pissed all over the couch last Christmas.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> We're like animals.<eos> I cleaned up the bong spill and the cigarette burns.<eos> This couch has history.<eos> And now it is history.<eos> So, here are some new ideas.<eos> I thought we could look it over.
And the three pieces of gum that were stuck to it.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I was looking for that gum.<eos> You know I'm done with the music industry, right?<eos> I love what I do.<eos> Okay, Zeke, he's not trying to sign you, though.<eos> He wants some new songs for some albums that he's working on.<eos> Yeah, well, my album went Plat-none, okay?<eos> I mean, two people heard it and both of them were relatives.<eos> Okay, but I was raving about it, and he decided to check it out.
No, I got this.<eos> I'm good, good night!<eos> The guys may have lost some battles, but they were winning the war.<eos> I'm telling you, Gina. It worked.<eos> He's finally stepping up and looking for a betterjob.<eos> Family Feud knows what he's talking about?<eos> Changing the game.<eos> How does this affect the 90-Day Rule?<eos> The 90-Day Rule is what got me to this point.<eos> It's just, I was saying that I'm not opposed to amending it, you know, for good behavior.
Just dating, but nothing serious.<eos> Well then, why don't we go to dinner?<eos> Sure.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I mean, let's do dinner.<eos> Well, you have to call me.<eos> - Got the same number?<eos> - Same number.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Use it.
Good night, Duke!<eos> Baby, I'm gonna see what I can do, all right?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm gonna make it happen.<eos> Come here, girl, come here.<eos> Turns out, the only problem in pretending to step up is, well, sometimes, you actually have to.<eos> Yo, watch this right here.<eos> Hold it, this is about to jump...<eos> Okay, what?<eos> I wanted to wait until we had proper drinks, but I talked to my uncle last night, and he listened to your CD, and he loved it.
See, I've had him since I was about your age.<eos> He's very, very special to me.<eos> Stand up straight when you're talking to me.<eos> Why the fuck would he say that?<eos> Sorry, you really shouldn't swear in front of children.<eos> Look, we're very interested in the bear.<eos> If you want to make some sort of arrangement here's my address and phone number.<eos> And you can call me any time, okay?<eos> Will do.<eos> Here it goes, in the really important pocket for really important stuff.
A Tuesday?<eos> Perhaps...<eos> That's possible. I'll come back in a few days' time.<eos> If you want your husband to recover, pray.<eos> May God preserve you.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Are you asleep?<eos> Take this out!<eos> There's a fly!<eos> Yuck! Get it out.
Because this one is...<eos> You know, I don't know if he's going to get better.<eos> Oh, he's not going to recover, sir.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Send his wife some chocolate covered almond nuts in a cellophane wrapped box.<eos> Delicious.<eos> We're going to send your wife some almonds.<eos> Chocolate covered versions of these.<eos> Maroush, I think I dropped an almond in his head.<eos> Can you take it out?

So I was driving my 911 near the palace one day... and I totally crashed!<eos> It's ok, I've already ordered a new one.<eos> A brand new 9112012.<eos> You know, while you are here, you should try to see some of the sights... such as the Empire State Building... and Yankee Stadium.<eos> And I'd love to see the fireworks over the Statue of Liberty.<eos> Hey, have your old back problems been bothering you?<eos> Oh, it's been terrible!<eos> It got so bad that I made myself a back brace.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, look, I'm still wearing it.
Hello, Nadal.<eos> Listen, I can't speak now.<eos> I'll speak to you later, okay?<eos> Stop talking to my vagina!<eos> Zoey, the baby's stuck.<eos> I need you to put your hand in and help me.<eos> - What?<eos> No...<eos> - Come on!<eos> Put it in!
I'll speak to you later, okay?<eos> Stop talking to my vagina!<eos> Zoey, the baby's stuck.<eos> I need you to put your hand in and help me.<eos> - What?<eos> No...<eos> - Come on!<eos> Put it in!<eos> - No, don't be scared.<eos> Put it in. - Okay.
I need you to put your hand in and help me.<eos> - What?<eos> No...<eos> - Come on!<eos> Put it in!<eos> - No, don't be scared.<eos> Put it in. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - Put it right there on the right side.
He just finished college. I thought I was done writing checks.<eos> - I'm going to have a baby. - Yeah.<eos> I'm going to have a baby.<eos> Oh, you went low.<eos> Okay. All right.<eos> Wow.<eos> And thanks for the bus duty, doing that.<eos> I really appreciate it.<eos> You want the vest on the chair or just go with the...<eos> I'm going to go with the desk. I'm just going to put it on the desk, okay?
I can't lift my arms.<eos> - Can you move it? - Not much.<eos> - I can go, like, to right about there.<eos> - That's it?<eos> - Yeah, that's it. Right there, yeah.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> I can't even move it past that.<eos> You dislocated your shoulder. You have to go to the hospital.<eos> Last time I went to the hospital, it actually cost me more than I made in the fight, so you got to help me.<eos> But I would have to reset it.
You know what? You're sort of right.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you are right.<eos> 'Cause I don't know what I was thinking.<eos> This is definitely the weirdest date ever.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good night, Scott.<eos> Yep, okay.<eos> Well, this was a nice dinner.<eos> Sorry about the lamp.<eos> I wouldn't worry about it. I wouldn't worry about it at all.
An ambulance!<eos> Have you seen Clara?<eos> Have you seen Clara? No?<eos> Look, Tita is there!<eos> Hey, come on!<eos> Follow me, Adrián!<eos> This way! Koldo!<eos> Get inside!<eos> And lock the door! Lock the door!<eos> It's there!
Need a hand?<eos> You look lost with that old dinosaur.<eos> You were forty minutes late!<eos> What's one more?<eos> Where was I?<eos> What are you looking for, Laurence Alia?<eos> I'm looking for a person who understands my language and speaks it.
Go ahead.<eos> What's it to me? I can be out those two times.<eos> I'm talking about more often.<eos> More often, like in three or four times?<eos> - More often, like in... maybe he's the right one!<eos> Are you drunk?<eos> - Yes, with happiness, Cucumber.<eos> I could make a new start and live with him.<eos> In the morning I'll make breakfast, in the evening I'll dust my wall plates,<eos> I'll do the laundry and hang it out...
I cannot even look at you right now.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm trying to Iearn all the rules.<eos> There are no rules here, George.<eos> Except "no swatting flies."<eos> That's not a rule.<eos> It's just a way of thinking about stuff.<eos> You did something wrong and you're a Iittle embarrassed about it.<eos> I did something wrong? Forgiveness is always allowed.<eos> I've seen you throw a battery at a pigeon.<eos> I didn't kill it.
Thank God, you did it!<eos> - He's never going back there.<eos> - What happened?<eos> We don't have any time.<eos> The whole town will be here soon.<eos> It's over.<eos> Go home, Jenny.<eos> Just go home and don't say anything to anyone.<eos> Remember that number trick that you showed us at dinner?<eos> You take a number, multiply it by something, add six, and the result is always three?
- Yeah?<eos> - Shakespeare.<eos> That's a great guess, but no.<eos> Shakespeare didn't write novels.<eos> Anybody else?<eos> The author... was Charles Dickens.<eos> However, ifyou and I had gone to a Shakespeare play... it would have cost us four pennies.<eos> Can you imagine that?<eos> We would have put those pennies in a metal box.<eos> The ushers would lock it in the office.
Let's go, Devils!<eos> Right. Come on, offense!<eos> - Hey, Nothing.<eos> - Hey, Nothing. Oh, suck it, virginity pledges.<eos> Suck it.<eos> Oh, you're in trouble now,Jaguars!<eos> Hey, Patrick.<eos> Hey. You're in my shop class, right?<eos> How's your clock coming?<eos> My dad's building it for me.
Please hold.<eos> You're putting us on hold?<eos> Right there. lt says "Peter Desantis."<eos> That's my dad.<eos> And this,<eos> this is Mike D's.<eos> You don't expect me to believe that's Mike D's.<eos> My dad was a sound engineer in New York.<eos> He worked on their album.<eos> Mike D left his jacket in the studio on the last day, so my dad just kept it.
Jay.<eos> Just jay. Time really flies by.<eos> It didn't fly by for me.<eos> Well, come on in, kid.<eos> Just watching some tape on a new fighter.<eos> Yeah, you were really something then.<eos> No one threw a left hook harder.<eos> You weren't even there, ronnie.<eos> How'd you end up with my medal?<eos> I just figured I'd hang onto it, you know,
- They will. Once they understand you.<eos> They just haven't met anyone like you before.<eos> Okay.<eos> The Volturi will come for all of us.<eos> You get that thing out of here. She's not what she looks like.<eos> This is a crime!<eos> Stay back!<eos> She has blood in her veins.<eos> You can feel her warmth.<eos> I can feel it.
Be a little patient with us.<eos> [In German] Yes, I read here that during the transport 15people died.<eos> I can only say that these records were not the responsibility of department 4B-4.<eos> They are from the local authorities, according to their guidelines.<eos> [Female Translator, In English] It says here that the order was given by the Reichsführer.<eos> But tell me, why do you have the officer-to be the officer transferring this order?<eos> Why Eichmann?<eos> [Speaking Hebrew] [Female Translator] Does the Reichsführer have no other way of contacting but Eichmann?<eos> [In German] The document makes it clear that the local police, or headquarters thereof, made the request to Section 4B-4.<eos> Thus I received the matter for its continued processing and dealt with it in an intermediate capacity. As I was ordered to do.
At least 500 new pages from the court.<eos> I'll sort them for you later.<eos> I'm so lucky to have you, Lotte.<eos> I'd never be such good friends with my own daughter.<eos> My father always says God gave us family, but thank God we can choose our friends.<eos> Well... [ In English ] Interesting theory.<eos> - [ In German ] You think I'd have chosen Charlotte?<eos> - Oh, I forgot.<eos> She called earlier. She wanted Heinrich's new number at Bard.<eos> Did you give it to her?

It's a hurricane, Hannah.<eos> [Hannah] Tell me what's for dinner.<eos> Spinach, whole wheat bread and water.<eos> It's good you're not here in New York.<eos> They are all accusing you of having defended Eichmann, Hannah.<eos> Stups, it's just a few articles in a magazine.<eos> My dear, you are really naive.<eos> She thinks her sarcasm will protect her.<eos> It only shows me her vulnerability.<eos> She tries to detach herself from the story but ends up bringing it closer to her.
[ Lotte ] Oh, God!<eos> [ Lore ] What does it say?<eos> Oh, nothing.<eos> Come here, Lotte.<eos> Read it to us.<eos> [ In English ] "Your picture is of a face hard as rock... and cold as ice in the North Pole.<eos> Contempt hovers on the lips, and an iron brutality is seen in the eyes.<eos> I felt that that page on which your picture is on... contaminated the whole of the review.<eos> I put on a glove. I felt it revolting to put my bare hand on that page.<eos> Ripped it out from the review, and not wanting to give it the... dignity of burning it, I threw it in the garbage can.
Wrong answer!<eos> The White Man versus the Indians. That's what we all learned in school. But that's not entirely accurate.<eos> It was actually the White Man versus the Indians... versus the Indians.<eos> You see, when the Europeans first came to the New World, the Indians viewed them as just another tribe. One to trade with, fight with, or ally with ...against other Indians.<eos> But the Europeans brought with them something that the Indians had never seen before and had no defense against.<eos> And I'm not talking about guns and disease and facial hair... though that was true, too.<eos> No, I'm talking about GREED.<eos> And soon, the Indian tribes were being backstabbed and treaties were being broken, and whole peoples were being slaughtered and moved onto reservations and that was completely barren and worthless.<eos> And that was supposed to be the end of the story. Except for the fact that the Europeans forgot that greed is contagious.<eos> And the Indian tribes, along with Smallpox and Whooping Cough, had caught it... and learned to wield it against their conquerors.
Smith.<eos> John Smith.<eos> Don't hit me again!<eos> John Smith.<eos> Well Mr. Smith, an Elvis impersonator just stole the Chief's sacred warrior mask.<eos> You guys saw my performance I'm the worst Elvis impersonator that ever lived.<eos> Where would I be hiding it? In my pants?<eos> The White Man has stolen this mask before.<eos> And the Tribe has suffered many hardships because of it.<eos> It took almost a century to recover it.
Your attention please.<eos> This is an announcement for Train 735 to San Antonio, Baton Rouge and Tacoma<eos> This train has been delayed for approximately one hour.<eos> Please remain in the station. for further notices. All passengers will board...<eos> Once upon a midnight dreary... while I pondered weak and weary.<eos> There came a tapping, gently rapping on my chamber door.<eos> Little lady... you better get the hell outta here... before I pull out the big gun on you.<eos> Baby, your gun doesn't work on me.<eos> Now, where is the mask?<eos> I don't have it.
All right. Let's wrap it up.<eos> That family worked for me.<eos> Mother, Father, Little boy, all killed.<eos> Except for some old Indian woman, some sort of... code of the savages.<eos> :<eos> She lives. : Only the white man dies today.<eos> That's horrible.<eos> Um, so where again did you say the Father found the mask?<eos> What's it matter?<eos> He found it, they killed him, the Chief got it!
Do we understand each other?<eos> Yes sir.<eos> We're right back Where we started.<eos> He just threatened to cut off our heads<eos> Well technically he only threatened to cut off my head.<eos> Well greet, / feel so much better.<eos> I won't get killed because of a technicality.<eos> Well if it makes you feel any better there's plenty of other people out there who are willing to kill you today.<eos> So how are we going to find this mask?<eos> All we know is that an Elvis has it.
Thank you for getting me the hell out of there.<eos> Wasn't cheap.<eos> But I didn't want to have a jailbird for an uncle.<eos> What would the other kids say.<eos> Mmm, thank you, I owe you.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> There's a plan?<eos> I hope so.<eos> I mean the Rancher hired the Elvises to steal the mask.<eos> And the head Elvis screwed over the other Elvises. Framed you and then took the mask for himself. He's probably going to try and sell it to the highest bidder.
Who is that?<eos> Her!<eos> We'll leave you a present at the car.<eos> Nice.<eos> Where's my mask?<eos> Your mask, Chief?<eos> Elvis destroyed it.<eos> What?<eos> The mask is gone.<eos> I threw it off a cliff.
– Oh, great.<eos> Hey! What you doing?<eos> Andrew!<eos> – No, I wasn't...<eos> – Don't film me, Detmer!<eos> Don't film me. Run to your house, bitch!<eos> This is where I eat lunch.<eos> Out here on the bleachers.<eos> What do you want?<eos> When I say open that door, you open the door. You got it?
Dude!<eos> When did you start doing this? – Since when?<eos> – What, with the camera? Yes, with the camera.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's been a little while, I guess.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> I can't do stuff that requires finesse.<eos> I tried to type my name out yesterday, and I cracked my keyboard in half.<eos> No, dude. It's really easy.<eos> You just think that you're holding it.
– I don't know. – Why?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know what happened, Matt!<eos> I don't believe you, okay?<eos> I want you to turn off the camera and talk to me.<eos> – Why? – I want to have a conversation with you.<eos> Don't tell me what to do, Matt.<eos> You can't tell me what to do!<eos> Don't ever tell... – Give me...<eos> Shut it off! – Get off of me!
General Lamarque is dead.<eos> Lamarque, his death is the hour of fate<eos> The people's man<eos> His death is the sign we await!<eos> On his funeral day they will honor his name<eos> With the light of rebellion ablaze in their eyes<eos> From their candles of grief we will kindle our flame<eos> On the tomb of Lamarque shall our barricade rise!<eos> The time is here!<eos> Let us welcome it gladly with courage and cheer!
Do I follow where she goes?<eos> At the barricades of freedom!<eos> Shall I join my brothers there?<eos> When our ranks begin to form<eos> Do I stay and do I dare?<eos> Will you take your place with me?<eos> "ALL". The time is now!<eos> The day is here!<eos> One day more!<eos> One day more to revolution We will nip it in the bud
I don't know what I need.<eos> I'm hot.<eos> Is it hot out?<eos> - Feel like I'm gonna be sick.<eos> It smells like sulfur. - Lola:<eos> What does that last part mean?<eos> "You don't have a wife yet, but you named your son Somalingam."<eos> - Ancient Indian proverb.<eos> - What?<eos> Find your spirit animal and ride it till its dick falls off.
Honey, I don't give a shit what Dr Johnston said, there is no way we're going to get anywhere if you start putting images of little bald bastards in nappies in my head at crucial moments.<eos> Sorry, Freddie.<eos> What you doing?<eos> What's it look like I'm doing?<eos> I'm finishing off the job.<eos> No, I'm sorry, that's it.<eos> What, but...<eos> No buts, Jenna.<eos> The flag's at half mast and coming down fast.<eos> Well, let's see if we can raise it up again.
Cover this guy, I'm walkin' the circuit.<eos> Is there a door to this office that I'm not seein'?<eos> You idiot, this whole floor is my office.<eos> Look, unless you want to get your ass shot off, I suggest you take a seat, all right?<eos> - Don't touch me, you have dirty hands.<eos> - Sit down... Sir.<eos> - I'm not now an amateur.<eos> - What in the hell do you think you're doing?<eos> Listen to me I want this damn door opened right now, now open it! I can't!<eos> Once it's down it can only be opened by outside security.
Lis... No, no, lis... listen to me.<eos> OnStar. Okay, get them on the phone, they can shut it down remotely.<eos> Let's go Tommy.<eos> Appreciate your help.<eos> OnStar says that they can't communicate with the equipment, he's disabled it.<eos> No, no, no, no, there's gotta be a way to track that car.<eos> We've researched this, all you have to do is give 'em the transponder receiver number from the GPS, right?<eos> Match it with the VIN number and they'll tell you where it is. Hold on!<eos> Yeah, I need you to track the car's VIN number, okay?<eos> I'm gonna give it to you.
Yeah, I can't keep my hands off 'em.<eos> Well, there's no chip in him.<eos> There's no way to trace the owner.<eos> He's a little nicked up.<eos> He has a cut on his muzzle, a few hot spots.<eos> We'll get the blood panel back tomorrow. But if I had to guess, there's nothing wrong with this dog a few good meals and a bath won't fix.<eos> That's great.<eos> I hope one of you will take him home.<eos> I just can't.<eos> I have my thesis, and it's time-consuming, and I don't even know why I'm doing it.
So, did you listen?<eos> How was it? Did I listen?<eos> Did I listen?<eos> Of course I listened.<eos> - You were fantastic.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> And I recorded you so you could hear yourself back.<eos> Oh, no, I hate the sound of my voice.<eos> Imagine me.<eos> I have to listen to it every day.
We can buy Superman with this.<eos> With the value of this, we will go to America.<eos> And when we fly back with Superman, we will tell everyone that he is our friend.<eos> Sweet!<eos> Hey, people.<eos> One or two days from now, we will fly in the sky of this place with Superman.<eos> Hey people, you hear me?<eos> Brother, where did you get this necklace?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I found it and that's important.

And neither of us will go to America.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> It's getting late. Just give me the necklace and get in the car.<eos> - I don't have the necklace.<eos> - What?<eos> Without the necklace, I will not take you, understand?<eos> Come on, get on.<eos> It's late. Let's go.<eos> - Would you tell me where's the necklace?<eos> - I gave it back to Helliya.
- It does not matter.<eos> - I'll get cigarettes.<eos> Immediately back.<eos> Sæt dig.<eos> - Do not worry. I say nothing.<eos> - What?<eos> - That you're too young to be here.<eos> - Why are you so sure?<eos> Not many 21-year-old goes with bracket.<eos> I think it looks cute.
Towel.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Tony!<eos> - Don't shush me!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Look in the wall! Tony!<eos> Yo, Beech.<eos> - Your door is open.<eos> - What are you, retarded?<eos> - I did shut it when I got here!
There's a saying from the people where I come from.<eos> It means: Fried fish. Open thighs.<eos> You work with Hong.<eos> - What do you have against Hong?<eos> - Nobody knows who he is. Or where he came from.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> I don't trust anything that's too good to be true.<eos> Do you know what SIuder's Syndrome is?<eos> It's when a person with a chronic disease is cured. And they missed the disease.<eos> Because they don't know how to live without it.
You must go there.<eos> Okay, Hong. Wherever you are.<eos> Back in Da Nang, there was guy in the platoon... Coakley.<eos> We didn't pay much attention to him.<eos> And one day we got ambushed.<eos> Six of us pinned down in heavy fire.<eos> Then... a VietCong hand grenade drops in to finish us off.<eos> We were six sitting ducks, everyone kissing their ass goodbye.<eos> Except Coakley.<eos> He goes gung-ho, dives on it and covers it up with his helmet.
You see?<eos> We're not that different, are we?<eos> I'm everything you're not.<eos> You cannot defeat me!<eos> I've lived too many lives.<eos> Ravaged entire kingdoms.<eos> I have been given powers that you could not even fathom!<eos> I will never stop.<eos> Never.<eos> I will give this wretched world the queen it deserves.
(Vibrating sound)<eos> (Dull throb)<eos> Then I heard loud knocking and looked at me before I begri_, that it was my own heartbeat, the blasting in my ears.<eos> My heart had been feared, before I knew it.<eos> Hesitantly, I try it again.<eos> And again rested my hand such as a window on the disk.<eos> Suddenly I realized what I subconsciously the whole time might have tortured that the road was completely empty.<eos> Irgendjemand had but have long sounded the alarm.<eos> It would have been natural the Do_leute were curious accumulated in front of the wall.<eos> Even if none of them the wall had discovered but had Hugo and Louise gestoKen be on it.
How did you do that?<eos> Phoney.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Simon, come with me.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Dear Margaret, Even today / 'm not exactly sure when everything ended.<eos> I wanted to cry, to feel anger, grief I to feel, just' like I used to<eos> A whole life denying myself, searching in silence for someone like me.<eos> A whole life looking for an answer, without finding it
Don't kill him.<eos> That's one request I can't grant.<eos> Mr. Chenkov.<eos> I told you not to kill him.<eos> - He was my teacher.<eos> - It was him or me.<eos> And don't forget he wasn't your teacher any more.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Shoot, JD.<eos> Why the hell carry that gun around if you're not gonna use it?
Mr. Chenkov.<eos> I told you not to kill him.<eos> - He was my teacher.<eos> - It was him or me.<eos> And don't forget he wasn't your teacher any more.<eos> Shoot.<eos> Shoot, JD.<eos> Why the hell carry that gun around if you're not gonna use it?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll use it next time.
Tom can you hear me?<eos> Tom?<eos> He's not listening to me.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> You were shooting up. You took the gun from her hand ... Look at it, Anthony.<eos> Look at what you've done. I didn't do this!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> You've been spinning on wheels for three days.<eos> Confess already!<eos> You took the gun, you put it to her head, and you fucking blew her away, BAM!
Scanning short-term memory.<eos> Look!<eos> You see me right now, Anthony?<eos> Lights out in five minutes.<eos> He was thinking about that memory.<eos> He was thinking about the memory at the same time that I was in it.<eos> An active memory.<eos> That's how he saw me, Minnie.<eos> - I can not verify your theory, Tom.<eos> You don't have to verify it.
You never look at me like that.<eos> Ever.<eos> Would we even still be together if I didn't get pregnant 14 years ago?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm not gonna go down that road.<eos> Would we?<eos> Okay.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to have a party here.<eos> You need to cancel it.
And then a restaurant comes up.<eos> Dad, excuse me.<eos> I'm gonna go look for Pete right now.<eos> Would you mind staying with the girls for just a little bit?<eos> Well, ifyou want me to.<eos> Ifyou don't mind.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Sure.<eos> Can I let Sadie show me the last episode of Lost?<eos> She asked me if I'd seen it and I haven't.
What the fuck is that smell, bruv?<eos> It's disgusting, man!<eos> I'll have to change its fuckin' nappies now!<eos> Give me the gun while you do that.<eos> Let me look after it for you, innit?<eos> Is it? You gonna help me find its mum?<eos> Nah.<eos> I've got better things to do with my time than run around like that.<eos> But you carryin' that, bruv...<eos> Just give me the gun and I'll hide it somewhere for you, innit?
- Him, him, him!<eos> - Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> I can't believe you sold a fucking baby!<eos> Actually... yeah, I can.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I've been walking around all day looking for this one, all right?<eos> I told you I couldn't bring it to the fucking feds.
- Come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> I can't believe you sold a fucking baby!<eos> Actually... yeah, I can.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> I've been walking around all day looking for this one, all right?<eos> I told you I couldn't bring it to the fucking feds.<eos> You didn't want it back before, did you?
You all right?<eos> - What's goin' on there?<eos> - I don't know. You wanna go and party?<eos> - Where's my fucking gun?<eos> - What's the matter with you, bruv?<eos> Listen, listen.<eos> You've been storing drugs in the pub, right?<eos> - What? - In the toilet in the fucking pub!<eos> Yes, man.<eos> Either you or your idiot bredren have got my fucking gun and I need it back.
- Oh great, a rookie.<eos> Yes, well. But I've been digging since I was five.<eos> You don't look like a professor of anything.<eos> - That's because I am a man of action.<eos> - Oh really?<eos> Check-out G.I. Joe.<eos> Is that kind of welcome normal here?<eos> What do those guys want?<eos> Well, obviously Humbert's tablet.<eos> They must know you have it. You're in grave danger.
- Got it. Follow me!<eos> My bad.<eos> - Tad, my God. - I'm fine.<eos> You deal with the tablet.<eos> Get your filthy paws off me.<eos> - Where do you think you're going?<eos> - Up?<eos> I'll give you a lift.<eos> Tad!<eos> We got it, sir.
Now dad is all I have left.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> The photo!<eos> It was taken at Nasca desert.<eos> My father always said these ruins showed the way to Paititi; like a map or something.<eos> - But he never had the key for it.<eos> - But we do.<eos> The tablet is the key.<eos> That's why Odessus want it so badly.
Sara.<eos> So long, suckers.<eos> Dad.<eos> The golden statue.<eos> Stop human.<eos> The golden idol is off limits.<eos> Prepare to die.<eos> - Ok, ok, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> - I protected this statue for 500 years. And you're not going to be the one who steals it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> I believe you.<eos> What was in the case?<eos> A computer.<eos> Blueprint of a mine.<eos> A mine.<eos> What mine?<eos> The Russians stored nearly 5 tons of weapons-grade plutonium.<eos> The mine was abandoned after the Cold War.<eos> No one knows it's there.
Track him, find him, kill him.<eos> CZ-1492, come on. Requesting a response immediately.<eos> Who's this bozo?<eos> CZ-1492, this is a secure air wave.<eos> Do you read?<eos> What's this about?<eos> What's taking so long, Barney Ross?<eos> This should have been a walk in the park for you guys.<eos> Where's the case?<eos> Don't have it.
You saw the children!<eos> Soon they'll be done, and they'll kill them all.<eos> We have our own business with them.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't think they're gonna last here much longer.<eos> I think they know that.<eos> So we're not gonna do anything about it?<eos> I got an idea.<eos> And with your ego, I think you're gonna love it.
Look at that smile.<eos> No, no.<eos> You see, Ralph, there's no room for you up here.<eos> What about this? We can make room.<eos> Here. We could take turns.<eos> Easy.<eos> How about we just eat the cake?<eos> Hang on.<eos> Felix needs to be on the roof because he's about to get his medal !<eos> Then how about we just take that medal and give it to Ralph for once?
Why are you so freakishly...<eos> Sweet mother of monkey milk!<eos> A gold coin !<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> That is mine. -Race you for it!<eos> I don't have to race for it because it's mine!<eos> -Double stripe!<eos> -Come back here!<eos> -The winner!<eos> -Give it back! Give it!
What did you win the medal for, wiping?<eos> I hope you washed your hands after you handled that medal.<eos> -Listen !<eos> -One more, one more.<eos> Why did the hero flush the toilet?<eos> -Say "why."<eos> -Why?<eos> Because it was his doodle!<eos> How dare you insult Hero's Duty? You little guttersnipe!<eos> I earned that medal and you better get it back for me toot-sweet, sister!
Ralph, look!<eos> Kid !<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm not letting you undo all my hard work!<eos> Is that...<eos> No way!<eos> What the...<eos> Whoareyou ?<eos> I'm Turbo, the greatest racer ever!<eos> And I did not reprogram this world to let you and that halitosis-riddled warthog take it away from me!
Ooh, you sure about that?<eos> You sure you didn't go over to the One Ball Inn?<eos> You know, on Grand Avenue?<eos> Grab a nightcap?<eos> Your buddies were all there.<eos> No, I had work in the morning.<eos> I went straight home.<eos> As I spoke, a strange jittery energy began to rise up in me, radiating from the chest out.<eos> At that moment, things began to clarify and become simple.<eos> All of a sudden I was startled to find I could see the cop's next question before he spoke it... word for word.
And don't freak out.<eos> - Are you freaking out?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I can't believe this phone still works.<eos> There's a hot dog guy about maybe a half a block ahead. Do you see him?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Buy a bratwurst from him.<eos> One.<eos> Okay, I have the bratwurst.<eos> Put it up to your head.
It bites.<eos> And then I realized all at once what I had come here for.<eos> When I was on the stuff... that little hit in my thigh...<eos> I could communicate with the dead, with John.<eos> When it wore off, I could not.<eos> My one chance to save John lay inside this bottle.<eos> It was decided then, just like that. .<eos> Oh, son of a motherfuck!<eos> The fucking Soy Sauce is digging a fucking hole in my fucking face!<eos> I'll throw myself at the cop and beg him to take me to the emergency room to pump my stomach, to bring in an exorcist, to call in the Air Force to nuke this whole town into radioactive dust and bury it under 60' of concrete!
And the more I think about it, the more I think that it's not just someplace down there.<eos> Oh no, that it's right here with us.<eos> We just can't perceive it.<eos> It's kinda like the country music radio station.<eos> It's out there in the air even if you don't tune into it.<eos> And I think that somehow through chemistry or magic or voodoo... that Jamaican son of a bitch, he tuned in to it, into hell itself.<eos> Through that, he opened a door.<eos> He became the door.<eos> And me?<eos> I intend to close it.
Where are we?<eos> We're in some liquor truck and we're on our way to the abandoned mall on Highway 59.<eos> Did you say we're going to the mall or coming back from it? - Going!<eos> - Yeah, that's right,<eos> - 'cause Fred's still alive.<eos> - What? !<eos> Nothing nothing.<eos> I got a headache.<eos> You see that door?<eos> I see it.
What?<eos> I went with the Old Testament.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause we're the only ones who can.<eos> 'Cause we were chosen... by the Soy Sauce.<eos> - Are you in?<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> Is that a paintball gun?<eos> Ghost door... you see it?
Yeah, I guess.<eos> Is that a paintball gun?<eos> Ghost door... you see it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - All I see is a wall.<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Shit.<eos> It's a ghost knob.<eos> - This doesn't make any sense. - Nuh-uh.<eos> 'Cause Justin... or Shitload or whatever his name was... he said he needed Amy to open it.
David Wong, son of an insane prostitute and a mentally-challenged Amway salesman.<eos> There are worlds upon worlds, - an infinity you cannot grasp. - ...in our world.<eos> They will soon be in your world too.<eos> 20 years ago Korrok foretold your coming.<eos> He showed us the way to your world.<eos> We have never traveled from our plane to yours. But we have tried.<eos> Oh, we have tried.<eos> Dave, John, your arrival here is a new dawn.<eos> You can show us the way to go from our world to your own.<eos> You see, in our world, when someone is born with special wisdom, he shares it with Korrok so that Korrok could be greater.
I chased you in Lahore.<eos> I had you picked up instead of killing you, because you're not a violent man, and you don't deserve to die.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you do have deep ties to al-Qaeda I want to ask you about, before you get sent to your next location, which might be Israel.<eos> However, depending on how candid you are here today, I may be able to keep you in Pakistan.<eos> What do you want to know?<eos> I'm gonna ask you a series of questions, based on your knowledge of al-Qaeda, and your position as key financier for the organization.<eos> I have dealt with the horrors.<eos> I have no wish to be tortured again.<eos> Ask me a question, I will answer it.
- There's a full moon tonight.<eos> - That looks like a needle, and there's a half-moon carved in the top.<eos> The obelisk!<eos> Peter, let's go!<eos> - Oh, my.<eos> Dr. Wellington.<eos> - Yes, yes, of course.<eos> Incredible.<eos> - What now?<eos> - Well, now we need to calibrate the position of the beam and coordinate it on the map.
- Are you OK, B-Dawg?<eos> - I... I think so.<eos> Eww, gross, hairball.<eos> I almost crossed over to the dark side.<eos> - It's finally mine.<eos> - The collar!<eos> This is, perhaps, the greatest historical discovery since King Tut's tomb!<eos> You were right, Grandpa.<eos> The necklace.<eos> You found it, Ubasti.
- I... I think so.<eos> Eww, gross, hairball.<eos> I almost crossed over to the dark side.<eos> - It's finally mine.<eos> - The collar!<eos> This is, perhaps, the greatest historical discovery since King Tut's tomb!<eos> You were right, Grandpa.<eos> The necklace.<eos> You found it, Ubasti.<eos> Ooh, bring it to me, kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
First, my grandson, Peter.<eos> And then, of course, the Buddies!<eos> And now, without further ado the lost Cat's Eye necklace of Cleocatra.<eos> Wow.<eos> If only your great grandpappy, Digger, could see you.<eos> Chips off the old block, five doggone explorer pups.<eos> - He'd be very proud.<eos> - That's a cool necklace.<eos> Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it, Pete?<eos> And I'm glad we found it so the world can enjoy it, too.
He has given me an ultimatum.<eos> His researchers are among winners, so I'm dead.<eos> Hello? Bridget?<eos> ?<eos> I have found the archive and she mentions a name.<eos> Annika, I'm coming right away.<eos> Hey, it's Annika.<eos> I'm on Karolinska with Bridget...<eos> - and I will send you a file.<eos> Look at it as soon as you hear it here.
Don't let him kill me. Please don't.<eos> Shut Up!<eos> We're going back.<eos> It's a man's life.<eos> I need a night to think it through.<eos> You're gonna bring this piece of garbage, this piece of garbage who... He shot at you, Rick.<eos> He ran with men who tried to kill you.<eos> You gonna bring him back to where Lori sleeps?<eos> To where Carl sleeps?<eos> He'll be locked up in the barn, unless you bust it open.
- All right.<eos> Is that really the best way to do this?<eos> To string him up?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> It's my first time.<eos> Look, I know how you feel about the death penalty, but...<eos> And I know the world has changed.<eos> If after everything that's happened, you and Shane agree on this...<eos> So you support this decision?<eos> If you think it's best.
I'd look at Dale.<eos> He'd be looking back at me with that look he had.<eos> We've all seen it one time or another.<eos> I couldn't always read him, but he could read us.<eos> He saw people for who they were.<eos> He knew things about us, the truth,<eos> who we really are.<eos> In the end, he was talking about losing our humanity.<eos> He said this group was broken.<eos> The best way to honour him is to unbreak it.
-Where's your common courtesy?<eos> -Exactly.<eos> -I should have listened to you.<eos> -I know.<eos> You tried to warn me about these parking rules.<eos> But what a car though, right?<eos> Pure American muscle.<eos> You could feel that power, right?<eos> I sure did.<eos> You feel it right between your legs.
-It's not in here!<eos> Where's her phone?<eos> -How would I know?<eos> Because you took it out of her bag when you were in the back seat!<eos> -Now, where is it?<eos> -You expect me to admit to that?<eos> Hey, don't mistake my kindness for weakness.<eos> I'm warning you!<eos> Really?<eos> What should I mistake it for?
If you don't, you're not gonna make it.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> -It's okay.<eos> -What's going on?<eos> It's all right.<eos> We're gonna get out of here, all right?<eos> stick with me, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I have a shotgun!<eos> And I know how to use it.
-What's going on?<eos> It's all right.<eos> We're gonna get out of here, all right?<eos> stick with me, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I have a shotgun!<eos> And I know how to use it.<eos> Kid.<eos> Don't do that!<eos> Put it down, all right?
He can stay.<eos> He can get his own girl and his own kid.<eos> That's every man's right.<eos> That sounds like a nice dream.<eos> You can, uh, use this. If you wanna.<eos> But keep in mind, man, I did four banks with a note.<eos> In other words, you don't need the gun.<eos> I never liked guns, man.<eos> They're vulgar, you know.<eos> But you may wanna take it. I don't know.
My job is to protect the country...<eos> And anything I do for that is right.<eos> If I have to sacrifice Vidya Bagchi to catch Milan Damji...<eos> Then that's right too.<eos> Then what is the difference between us and Milan, sir?<eos> There's no difference.<eos> We do it for the law and he does it against the law.<eos> That's why we are right and he's wrong.<eos> Love is a good thing, Rana.<eos> But learn to use it at the right place.
Come help me!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We're out.<eos> Martial.<eos> I would like to pray.<eos> God sees our love.<eos> Our love?<eos> What love?<eos> I have it in me.
- You're probably wondering what I'm doing here in this box.<eos> Well. I'm wondering too because this really wasn't part of the plan.<eos> It all started off as something completely different.<eos> I was looking for others like us.<eos> We were fugitives hiding in London because of what happened back home.<eos> And time was running out fast.<eos> I headed into the English old country Looking for help. Not knowing if it even existed.
My PhD. was actually on bacterial biochemistry.<eos> But, as I'm sure many of you know, I was drawn to this by my experience with my own son, whose condition led me to focus my research on screening embryos for traces of rare genetic mutations such as his.<eos> I want to make one thing very clear: this is not eugenics.<eos> I'm not trying to develop new techniques to pre-screen people with brown eyes, or dark skin, or freckles.<eos> I like freckles.<eos> Diversity - one of the things which defines us as a species is to be celebrated.<eos> Mutations which endanger human life are not.<eos> For example - here we see the subject in the earliest stages.<eos> The disease is non-contagious in the traditional sense, yet at the same time, unusually virulent.<eos> I've allowed myself the conceit of calling it Burton's Syndrome.
And you have reared the boy with the intention of making him your apprentice?<eos> You know, Pip, as you and I ever were the best of friends, and it were look for'ard to betwixt us as being calculated to lead to larks.<eos> The boy has made no objection to the trade?<eos> Larks being the great wish of his heart.<eos> Oh, enough!<eos> Estella. Um, bring me that purse.<eos> Yes, um...<eos> Pip has earnt a premium here.<eos> Here are five and 20 guineas.<eos> Give it to your new master, Pip.
- No!<eos> Jill, please stop it.<eos> You've been up all night. It's all in your head.<eos> Please go home and get some sleep.<eos> Jill.<eos> I'm new to this unit, but I'm going to pull your file right now.<eos> I'm Detective Hood.<eos> If you need anything, please don't hesitate to call.<eos> Here, give me your number.<eos> Punch it in.
He lives alone. He works odd jobs.<eos> I asked him why he was moving, and he said he didn't like the women here.<eos> I said, "Why, what's wrong with us?" "Too skinny."<eos> I said, "Well, I'll take that as a compliment."<eos> Nothing else?<eos> - Well...<eos> - What?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I have his phone number.<eos> I threw it away out here.

It was supposed to be a little book, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> So nice that you could make time for our little award.<eos> - We know you're busy. - The pleasure's all ours. No.<eos> Come now. Your book is fabulous. But, of course, you know that.<eos> You've read all the reviews.<eos> The Window Tears has introduced us to the one of the most exciting and sensitive young writers to appear on the literary horizon in a very long time.<eos> We are privileged to have with us here tonight the winner of this year's American Fellowship of Arts and Letters Award Mr. Rory Jansen.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I simply tried to set down the truth as I imagined it.
- Nothing crazy. Great, but it's the first two weeks of September.<eos> - It's the beginning-- - Get a sub.<eos> You don't wanna miss this.<eos> - This is gonna be truly great.<eos> - It's gonna be amazing. - Breakfast, lunch, dinner.<eos> - You pull out fish right out of the ocean, they cook them up.<eos> It's incredible. Snorkeling, diving. Totally different on a boat.<eos> "He couldn't stop thinking about that story.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> Who had written it?
- ...my copy of your book. - Of course.<eos> Do you have a pen?<eos> A writer without a pen.<eos> Well, today's a reading day.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> Well, I have a pen.<eos> So I do have a story.<eos> A very good story.<eos> Now, I know you get this line all the time, but I think you'll like the story.<eos> If I was to tell you the story and you wrote it well, then, maybe you could give me a little credit?
Bourgeoise elections even less.<eos> It's a trap.<eos> It's time for action.<eos> No revolution ever avoided it.<eos> French resistance took up arms. We extol their heroism.<eos> We're the new resistance.<eos> Don't Maoists say that? Maybe they're right.<eos> So we're breaking with the Trotskyites.<eos> Where do you position yourself?<eos> Why talk anarchy if you don't act on it? It's easy.
The chair.<eos> What is the chair doing here?<eos> I don't know.<eos> People are sitting on those chairs.<eos> And what are they doing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Let's have a sit. We'll see what happens.<eos> This is the wind from the see.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I can smell it.
I said, hey, white boy.<eos> Shut up, black.<eos> You ain't got nothing to say I want to hear.<eos> How'd you like to make $11,000?<eos> Do what, now?<eos> I said how'd you like to make $11,000?<eos> 11,500, actually.<eos> What the fuck are you talking about?<eos> Back there at that plantation, Candyland, there was an $11,500 fortune, just sittin' there.<eos> And y'all rode right past it.
Hey, come on.<eos> Come on. It can't be as bad as all that.<eos> It is.<eos> It's worse.<eos> I told you my dad was poorly, but he's more than that.<eos> And without his wage, there's no money for medicine, there's no money for food, there's no money to live.<eos> What have you done?<eos> I took a brooch.<eos> It were only a little one.<eos> She hardly wears it. She won't miss it.
Scientists don't know where they come from or why they appear, but these imaginal cells show up inside the caterpillar and say, "Get psyched, caterpillar!"<eos> It's butterfly-turning-into time".<eos> And what do all the other caterpillar cells do when these imaginal cells show up?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> They attack 'em!<eos> Try to kill 'em!<eos> They're like, "Screw you, imaginal cells."<eos> We're happy being a caterpillar.<eos> "Get lost!"<eos> But eventually, the imaginal cells keep growing and overtake the destiny of the caterpillar and will it into this cocoon.
Mr. Posche, our team at Europub.<eos> Lea, assistant, Laurent Sabi, the director... - 3 minutes.<eos> - Run it.<eos> Orange and lemon, with chocolate filling<eos> - Too red.<eos> - We'll take it down.<eos> The palette we got...<eos> Minus 5, okay.<eos> The music starts and ends well but bogs in the middle.<eos> - Play it back.
I came to finish what we started last night.<eos> If you're busy, I can go to the supermarket first.<eos> I finished all my work.<eos> There is a God.<eos> Where is it?<eos> You know, we're in a rush.<eos> Know why?<eos> We didn't work enough. Now you know why.<eos> Where's the last scene?<eos> I forgot to print it out.
Well, they move real slow, Harold.<eos> They are dead.<eos> Romero zombies.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well.<eos> - I believe I will have that beer now.<eos> - No, no, no. I'll get it.<eos> You stay put.<eos> You have reached the law offices of Boyle, Snyder and Wright.<eos> If you know your party's extension, press it now.
For your information, this annoying clock is only found for sale in one place in the world.<eos> Well...<eos> Your answer, please!<eos> Witness.<eos> You forgot, didn't you?<eos> That's it.<eos> I forgot!<eos> I've forgotten where.<eos> Stop lying, you bastard!<eos> I have seen it for sale somewhere, though...
Yeah, that's me.<eos> I have a pizza here for you.<eos> No, I didn't order a pizza.<eos> I... I called, but I didn't order.<eos> So, that's... that's a mistake.<eos> Nope. It's on the house.<eos> What do you mean "on the house"?<eos> Who sent it?<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> I was asked to bring it to you.
- Enjoy. - Thank you.<eos> You're sure getting a lot of stuff today, boss.<eos> I didn't ask for any of this.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, does that logo make any sense to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> They're fast, I would say.<eos> So, what do we do now?<eos> I don't know, boss.<eos> Do you want me to take the pine out and replace it with another palm tree?
It's true, I... I agree.<eos> So, how have you been since this morning?<eos> I've been well. Thank you.<eos> So you sent me the pizza?<eos> Yeah, that was me.<eos> Okay, that was you.<eos> That... That was very nice.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Well, did you get my note?<eos> Yes, I'm looking at it right now.

That was very nice.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Well, did you get my note?<eos> Yes, I'm looking at it right now.<eos> It's right in front of me.
I know, I'm sorry.<eos> This is the biggest they had.<eos> It's still better than a pine tree, no?<eos> You have to keep in mind that this will grow.<eos> It will grow, they said.<eos> Yeah.<eos> 420, 440, 460, 480, 500.<eos> Thank you very much, boss.<eos> So what did you do with the pine tree?<eos> I gave it away to a charity that tends to needy children.
That's a nice camera.<eos> You know, you're like a little ghost.<eos> 'Cause I never know when you're here.<eos> Don't ever fucking touch my camera!<eos> Now get out!<eos> Hey!<eos> Now, as the building manager,<eos> I got a legal right to enter an apartment, especially if I feel the occupant to be unwell and the occupant is not current on her rent.<eos> Just give me a minute.<eos> All right. I have your rent. I will bring it down to you, okay?
I can throw you 100 bucks tip you out at the end of the night... - ...if you really want to host.<eos> - Host what?<eos> - I hope you're ready for this shit. - Ha, ha.<eos> Who's your friend, Mike?<eos> - This is the owner.<eos> Jesus. - Whoo.<eos> Fucking Valhalla shit, man, mwah.<eos> You see that shit, Mike?<eos> Chicks are gonna go fucking crazy over this, man.<eos> I'm thinking of giving this routine to Tarzan, unless you want it.
His name's Clark Weilman.<eos> He's... well, he was general counsel of techsan pharmaceuticals.<eos> Skull was fractured in six places, and his wife confessed to detectives from Chicago homicide.<eos> Police have a confession.<eos> Why am I looking at these pretty pictures?<eos> Wife makes Nicole Richie look fat.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> I-I think the wife has anorexia or bulimia.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Either way, she could not lift this trophy, let alone bash her husband over the head with it six times.
Drink?<eos> Yes!<eos> So, the first room we're coming into is the mash house.<eos> This is the mash tun here and it's massive.<eos> Come on, have a look at it.<eos> It takes 10 and a half tons of malted barley, and to that we add 40,000 litres of hot water.<eos> What we're doing at this stage is mixing the barley and the hot water for the conversion of starch to sugar.<eos> Here we are in the fermentation room. This is where we ferment the wort we've just extracted from the mash tun.<eos> It's also where we take the third ingredient, the third of the three simple ingredients, which is yeast, and we add it to the mix.<eos> And as soon as we add the yeast, because it's been dehydrated, as soon as we add it to the wort, it starts to ferment.
This is a house of champions, Oenomaus.<eos> It does not submit to you.<eos> You submit to it.<eos> Yes, Dominus.<eos> One must learn to kneel, if he is ever to rise.<eos> A necessary lesson... if you are to one day join the champions of the House of Batiatus.<eos> How is such a thing possible?<eos> The answer lies within your breast!<eos> You fight with the strength of men beyond your meager years.<eos> Yet lack the discipline to see it properly harnessed.
Yeah, I know.<eos> You gotta do something about this, dude. This is not conclusive to your sobriety.<eos> I think you mean conducive.<eos> You got any garbage bags?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Dude, explain this to me.<eos> You're trying to stay sober and you still have your porn collection?<eos> Yeah, I'm really just stashing it up here.

What are you doing?<eos> I'm taking my daughter, that's what.<eos> Get out of my face.<eos> I'll love to get out of your face.<eos> You don't deserve her.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Let's go get the turtle.<eos> Let's go get it.<eos> Let's go get the turtle.<eos> Do you like it?
I'm going to estimate the value of your teapot at $5,000.<eos> Well done. Well done.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We have to promise to stop before it gets out of control.<eos> We make our million and we stop.<eos> Ready?<eos> Hello. How are you today?<eos> Good.<eos> Can I take your bag for you?<eos> No, no, I'd rather keep it here if that's okay.
Just say it.<eos> There are pedophiles and drug dealers on playgrounds.<eos> We can take out just one.<eos> If we knock off one low-life scumbag, We do the world a favor.<eos> We knock off two, and we're heroes.<eos> Rich heroes.<eos> Why'd you stop?<eos> I think I'm done.<eos> You got to bury a body at least six feet underground...<eos> Or somebody will find it.
- Seriously?<eos> - Oh, my god!<eos> Look at this. Money just comes walking in my house.<eos> I love it.<eos> Arnie. Arnie, Arnie, Arnie. Just relax.<eos> Put the gun-<eos> - Arnie, please put the gun down.<eos> Oh, come on. No one's gonna miss you two.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> - Put it down.
Yes, I'll wait.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> He ran out of the morgue like a scared rat until he was run over.<eos> We just found them.<eos> They're from a '32, like the gun at your house.<eos> I don't own a gun. It was Mayka.<eos> Your wife's dead, Mr. Ulloa.<eos> You can't prove it.<eos> They haven't found the body, nor will they.<eos> - Because you took it!
Don't be silly, Humphrey.<eos> We can get past that and be friends, just like old times.<eos> In fact, you know, let's take a photo of our friendship so we can remember this moment forever. Hey!<eos> You... in the hideous headband.<eos> Smile!<eos> Oh!<eos> Serena should see how much fun we're having right now.<eos> You know, that headband is giving me Hillary Clinton flashbacks.<eos> The bad kind. Oh, yeah.<eos> I would never wear it myself.

Oh, yeah.<eos> I would never wear it myself.<eos> I just have it on because I'm playing Clair.
If you have to look that hard, it's never the answer you wanna find.<eos> Ah.<eos> I'd better run.<eos> I'm gonna be late for my 11:00, heh.<eos> Jack, it's me.<eos> I just heard from Nate that Chuck's still on the hunt.<eos> We have to stop him snooping around or he's gonna find out the truth.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Serena is holding my site hostage.<eos> If you don't get it back for me I'll tell everyone the secret that made you afraid of me in the first place.
You need to go.<eos> You've already complicated things enough by being here.<eos> This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.<eos> You better hope it still does.<eos> My computer's gone.<eos> Gossip Girl.<eos> She took it. What?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because we set you up.<eos> After we got the address for tonight, I gave it to Gossip Girl.
I told you that camera-phone was my life.<eos> I know when it's in my hand.<eos> - Oh, you're rather good.<eos> - You're not so bad.<eos> Hamish.<eos> John Hamish Watson, just if you were looking for baby names.<eos> There was a man, an MOD official and I knew what he liked.<eos> One of the things he liked was showing off.<eos> He told me this email was going to save the world.<eos> He didn't know it, but I photographed it.
- You might be hungry. - I'm not.<eos> Good.<eos> Why would I want to have dinner if I wasn't hungry?<eos> Mr Holmes if it was the end of the world, if this was the very last night would you have dinner with me?<eos> Sherlock?<eos> Too late.<eos> That's not the end of the world, that's Mrs Hudson.<eos> Sherlock, this man was at the door.<eos> Is the bell still not working?<eos> He shot it.
- America?<eos> Got herself on a Witness Protection scheme, apparently.<eos> I don't know how she swung it but...<eos> - Well, you know.<eos> - I know what?<eos> Well, you won't be able to see her again.<eos> - Why would I want to see her again?<eos> - Didn't say you did.<eos> - Is that her file?<eos> - Yes. I was just going to take it back to Mycroft.
That works.<eos> So what now?<eos> Doing what Moriarty wants.<eos> Becoming a fugitive.<eos> Run.<eos> Get after him, Lestrade!<eos> - Take my hand.<eos> Now people will definitely talk.<eos> - The gun!<eos> - Leave it.
Why plant it on you?<eos> It's another subtle way of smearing my name, now I'm best pals with all those criminals.<eos> Yeah, well, have you seen this?<eos> A kiss and tell.<eos> Some bloke called Rich Brook.<eos> Who is he?<eos> Too late to go on the record?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> The truth about Sherlock Holmes.<eos> The scoop that everybody wanted and you've got it.
Leave him alone!<eos> No, no, no, he'll have backup.<eos> Do you know what, Sherlock Holmes?<eos> I look at you now and I can read you.<eos> And you repel me.<eos> Can he do that?<eos> Completely change his identity?<eos> - Make you the criminal? - He's got my whole life story.<eos> That's what you do.<eos> You sell a big lie. You wrap it up in a truth to make it palatable.
- Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> I'm good.<eos> - Hey, come here.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - JoJo won't talk to me.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> - How much for a dance in the booth?<eos> - I'll send someone over to answer that question.<eos> - Well, why don't you answer it?
It's what that pansy-ass little pussy fart is doing to my house.<eos> I gotta walk this shit off before I end up back in prison.<eos> Fucker!<eos> Hey.<eos> What's with the hubby out there?<eos> Tyler got into his 40-year-old bottle of Chivas.<eos> What the huh?<eos> I thought Batesy was on the wagon.<eos> Yeah, he is.<eos> But he keeps it around as a symbol of his sobriety.
- What?<eos> - Some of the surgeons from the hospital are getting together tonight for drinks.<eos> We're wondering if you'd be able to attend.<eos> For drinks?<eos> With... other surgeons?<eos> Yes, at Dr. Grant's home.<eos> Do you have the address?<eos> No.<eos> I don't have the address.<eos> I'll email it to you.
- Give me a yell, loud as you can<eos> Wretched brat, you're hiding<eos> Not so nice now uh, is he?<eos> Hey, you<eos> Be careful out here. Those tracks are unstable A lot of them could collapse on us at any time.<eos> - Why is this thing here?<eos> - Beats me<eos> Somebody thought it was a great idea to build it on this godforsaken place<eos> Hey, wait<eos> Do you know where that music come from, I've heard it before

You're making this too weird Don't you walk away from me<eos> Get out of there<eos> - Let's see what they got<eos> - Go away It's okay, I'm not mad<eos> No<eos> No, what happened? What have you done?<eos> Hi, Tom.<eos> I'm glad you got away<eos> - What did you do with my Arabesque?<eos> - You used to call it, your princess
Previously on AMC's The Killing...<eos> What did Rosie find out?<eos> Stan Larsen wasn't her real father.<eos> There was this box with pictures...<eos> I saw Rosie looking through it a bunch of times.
She'll crack your ribs.<eos> Found my phone.<eos> My bad.<eos> All right, smile, Bobby.<eos> Ooh, my boss at SPD will love that one.<eos> He'll love that one.<eos> I got a gun, man!<eos> What?<eos> What? Forgot it in my car.<eos> I'm gonna go get it.
Maybe I should set up my own business.<eos> You've got a good job, everyone likes you.<eos> But they don't respect me.<eos> Maurice gets all the credit for my ideas.<eos> You always say teamwork suits you.<eos> Yeah, but on a team, some pass the ball, others score.<eos> Wong Lee told me about these dolls, like Barbie.<eos> 3 euros to make.<eos> They sell for 10 times more.<eos> We send him our product specs and he makes them. Better yet we send a photo and they copy it.
This is what works. Be stern with her.<eos> Don't give her a choice.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Please, don't. This is craz... Just don't make me do this.<eos> Let me talk to Becky.<eos> He wants to talk to you.<eos> Hello.<eos> So I want you to do me a favor and look around at where you are.<eos> That's where you are.<eos> Where we are is at your house, searching it for your brother's drugs.
Because you're the one that's causing all the problems.<eos> Now, if you want this over with sooner rather than later, you'll allow the person that I authorized to inspect you, to search you.<eos> And then, maybe then... you'll have a chance of getting out of this.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> You can go to jail, or you can let this guy inspect you.<eos> You can go to jail, or you can let this guy inspect you.<eos> That's it, two choices.<eos> - You're gonna do this? - Okay. You're gonna take off the apron?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're gonna take it off?
Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> So just take off the apron and give the phone back to Van, okay?<eos> This is Van.<eos> How'd that work? She take off the apron?<eos> She is now.<eos> Well, what does her chest look like?<eos> Well, she's covering it with the apron.
I've studied and reflected upon those questions, Your Highness.<eos> It is now my opinion that one's ruler merits blind and absolute obedience.<eos> I believe that a prince's power should have its limits.<eos> Respect for justice, for example.<eos> The well-being of as many as possible.<eos> But you won't find any word of that in the paper I published.<eos> A paper that you don't read, of course.<eos> I ask for your forgiveness, Your Highness.<eos> But I do read it.<eos> I read it, and I agree with it.
Any evidence against Del Dongo?<eos> We'll soon have some.<eos> Notify the tribunal, quickly.<eos> Yes.<eos> I've considered Your Highness's most devoted judges.<eos> I want him to be convicted of murder, premeditated murder.<eos> With premeditation.<eos> It is noted.<eos> The trial shall be held in utmost secrecy.<eos> But the conviction shall be made public when I decide to sign it.
Say that again.<eos> The shadow of my sorrow!<eos> Let's see<eos> It is very true, my grief lies all within;<eos> And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul;<eos> There lies the substance<eos> And I thank thee, king, For thy great bounty, That not only givest<eos> I'll beg one boon, And then be gone and trouble you no more.<eos> Shall I obtain it?<eos> Name it, fair cousin.
I do beseech your majesty, To have some conference with your grace alone.<eos> Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.<eos> Then give me leave that I may turn the key, That no man enter till my tale be done.<eos> Have thy desire.<eos> KNOCKS ON DOOR My liege, beware;<eos> Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.<eos> Villain, I'll make thee safe.<eos> Stay thy revengeful hand;<eos> thou hast no cause to fear.<eos> My liege. Open the door or I will break it open!
And straight am nothing:<eos> But whate'er I be, Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased,<eos> Music do I hear?<eos> Keep time<eos> How sour sweet music is, When time is broke and no proportion kept!<eos> So is it in the music of men's lives.<eos> I wasted time, And now doth time waste me.<eos> This music mads me; let it sound no more;<eos> For though it have holp madmen to their wits, In me it seems it will make wise men mad.<eos> Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
No, no, no, the Shotgun.<eos> - That's what...<eos> - OK.<eos> Yeah, OK, OK.<eos> Oh, God, I'm sorry.<eos> I got so much crazy shit goin' on up here. I'll say.<eos> Well, so, I'm here with his wallet.<eos> - Cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hand it over, stripper.
I didn't realize she'd asked you to look into something.<eos> Yeah, I understand that your work is confidential.<eos> I'll let her know you called.<eos> How about "Cupcake War" as the most addictive new food show?<eos> Are those from the night of the accident?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That anonymous texter might be right.<eos> Can't tell from these paparazzi pictures if the photographers were even close enough to run Chuck and Blair's car into the wall.<eos> Well, what did the police say?<eos> The front of the car was so damaged, they couldn't inspect it.
Yeah, but only if I help her, whatever that means.<eos> Sometimes to get your needs met, you need to choose an unsavory partner.<eos> You know, that might work for you at 3:00 in the morning in the lower east side, but it's Gossip Girl.<eos> It's been pretty nice not having her record our every move.<eos> Maybe for you, but without her, I have no idea what Blair's up to.<eos> You still don't know why she won't talk to you?<eos> Before the accident, she was ready to run away with me, spend the rest of our lives together, and now... she won't even take my call.<eos> I have to know why.<eos> So what's your next move?<eos> If she won't give me my answer, I'll find it myself.
Well, that's... that's weird.<eos> Maybe there's a delay or something.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> I hope so.<eos> Just put that up there in the corner and make it color and see what I like.<eos> "This page no longer exists"?<eos> I had to postpone the launch.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, I'm confused, because this whole column was your idea, so if you're rethinking it now, you need to let me know.
I know--I know that sounds kinda bad.<eos> Yeah, it did.<eos> But don't worry about it.<eos> My column has been put on hold indefinitely.<eos> Oh, good.<eos> Oh, that's great.<eos> No, that's--that's...<eos> Not good for you. I'm sorry about that.<eos> No, it's--it's fine.<eos> Look, if Nate ever does decide to run it, I'll make sure all the references to you are in the past.
I'd have to speak with Blair in private.<eos> I'm not sure even you could perform that miracle alone.<eos> Who said I'm working alone?<eos> After all, I've got a higher power by my side.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Whoo!<eos> I have never been so happy to be surrounded by so many bridge and tunnel types.<eos> You should have worn an actual tiara.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Someone would have fist-pumped it off her head.
Correct.<eos> Blair drinks.<eos> This game is kicking my ass.<eos> Shake that. Drink, drink, drink, drink.<eos> No!<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, get it!<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Serena's column.<eos> I gotta hand it to her.
You guys are the new hot couple.<eos> You should enjoy it.<eos> But we're not dating.<eos> We're just faking it to protect Blair's engagement.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm not even gonna ask you to fill me in.<eos> Instead, I'm just gonna assume there's a long royal explanation.<eos> You know me well, and Blair, but the point is as long as it seems like Serena and I are together, my editor's not gonna let me write a second novel I'd actually care about.<eos> Well, sacrificing your career for the people you love, I understand.<eos> But sacrificing it for fake love, I... I think it's counterintuitive.
- Well, Louis is in a limo downstairs and Blair is nowhere to be found.<eos> Enough with the niceties.<eos> Tell me where she is.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Where is my daughter?<eos> I will not stand for the humiliation of my son being left on his wedding day.<eos> If you cannot get Blair to return then you will be required to fulfill the dowry that we so generously waived.<eos> First of all, I thought my daughter was with your son.<eos> And as for the dowry, it was waived because it's antiquated and outrageous.<eos> You cannot force us to pay it.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Oh, my gosh.<eos> That's fantastic!<eos> Amy, don't.<eos> Amy!<eos> Feel the fat power.<eos> Fat Amy!<eos> Kick me in the balls!<eos> Amy!<eos> Give me the sharp weapon, I wanna put it up his butt!
I can let go.<eos> This time I'm not gonna choke it down.<eos> Come on, bring it!<eos> You can do better than that!<eos> That's all you got?<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> We could have been champions!<eos> Give me the pitch pipe, you bitch!<eos> Give it to me!
Well, you said if I ever had more.<eos> AB negative.<eos> Only one in a hundred.<eos> Is that supposed to make it taste better?<eos> Rare is always valuable.<eos> Isn't that what the people say?<eos> People say a lot of stupid things.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't snort it all at once.<eos> You know, for such a rare blood type, you have little trouble obtaining it.
I want to stay with you.<eos> Yes?<eos> -I don't like motorcycles.<eos> A few details on a Masai wedding.<eos> First, the groom, encouraged by village people, goes into the wedding hut.<eos> Although it's ancient, this tradition manages without modern aspects.<eos> The woman freely decides whether she follows her future husband into the hut.<eos> If she takes the "orkila", the traditional wedding dress, and enters the hut, then the marriage is validated by the singing of the villagers.<eos> I forgot my jacket in the hut.<eos> Can you get it for me?
I could hear you upstairs.<eos> I think you might be looking for that. All right?<eos> Granddad?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Let's have a look here.<eos> - Why don't we just move in here?<eos> - So, who gets the couch?<eos> - Uh, I'm getting it.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> I chose it.
Can't even blame the poor Polack.<eos> No-one explained it properly.<eos> Suddenly they realise there's one pile of cash between two deliveries, and the numbers don't add up.<eos> They're a case light.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> They can't go back to the client, cos they can't prove who screwed up.<eos> So they do the only thing they can do.<eos> Absorb the loss, and keep it as quiet as possible.<eos> And the missing case?<eos> Wherever we want it to be.

In one ear and out the window.<eos> Oh, look. "Shifter" is playing?<eos> Hey, you wanna go see that instead?<eos> Dad said no way.<eos> Well, Dad's not here.<eos> It's just you and me.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Come on, let's do it.<eos> You're gonna have to hold my hand during the really scary parts.<eos> I'll hold it the whole time.
Garbage bags, mops, bucket, broom- they are your tools.<eos> Breakfast.<eos> You will serve me breakfast every morning for the rest of your life.<eos> You will not eat or drink anything without my permission.<eos> You only eat after I have eaten, and only what I have left on my plate.<eos> You hear that?<eos> That means that I'm bringing one back.<eos> You have 10 seconds to open these locks.<eos> Every night I bring home a newspaper.<eos> After I finish reading it, I want you to try and find stories about missing people.
The Lady Giulia Farnese.<eos> What Your Holiness proposes is unthinkable!<eos> What?<eos> That monies destined for the poor should go to the poor?<eos> That a woman should have access to curatorial accounts.<eos> Can a woman not count?<eos> Add, subtract?<eos> Count her children, perhaps.<eos> There is a new method, Cardinal, devised by the Florentine bankers.<eos> It is called double-entry book keeping.
A peasant to a pope's daughter?<eos> I should colour this market with your blood!<eos> Let him be!<eos> Let him be!<eos> You know this commoner?<eos> I do not.<eos> Then I will cut out his impertinent tongue.<eos> Do not ruin this day for me, dear brother.<eos> Let the commoner keep his tongue.<eos> He may need it in the future to explain his impertinence.
But- Bernadetta.<eos> Bernadetta here was helping me choose a wife.<eos> What do you think of our favourite- Maria Enrique de Luna?<eos> She's pretty.<eos> And clearly no peasant.<eos> She is royalty, Sis.<eos> Cousin to Queen Isabella.<eos> So. You must marry her then.<eos> I have your permission?<eos> You need it?
You remember.<eos> I've tried to forget.<eos> You should.<eos> You're to be married, are you not?<eos> And you?<eos> Did you not forget?<eos> I forget nothing.<eos> My father, Galeazzo Sforza.<eos> He lost one eye in battle.<eos> His nose then occluded his vision so he sliced it off.
Oh dear.<eos> A choice.<eos> And I am so bad at choosing.<eos> He would have you travel to Rome willingly or in chains.<eos> And this duck did taste so good.<eos> You must break fast with me tomorrow, Cardinal.<eos> I will give you my answer then.<eos> And now... let me show you to your rooms.<eos> Tell me your answer.<eos> You shall have it in the morning.

Wagons carrying Medici gold are to be shipped to Castelfiorentino.<eos> There is a stronghold there.<eos> So the Medici coffers are not entirely empty.<eos> Not if one knows where to look.<eos> How much gold?<eos> Not enough for a king's ransom,but one hopes sufficient to make your detour worthwhile.<eos> Enough to feed an army?<eos> Armies have big bellies.<eos> Let this map be your guide;<eos> I prepared it myself.
Listen.<eos> A shipment of gold hidden in alum ore is to travel from Florence to Castelfiorentino.<eos> It shall be ours.<eos> For this,we will need our friends.<eos> If there is gold promised,they will be there.<eos> Not only will we bring the Friar Savonarola to his unholy knees, we will also bring Medici gold to my father.<eos> Your father knows of this?<eos> He will know when he sees the gold.<eos> Surely such a gift from a son deserves reward from the father,no?<eos> I will have only one reward - and I will have it no matter what.
God's children.<eos> Savonarola's vermin.<eos> I feel a sudden chill.<eos> Give up your vanities!<eos> Hell is eternal!<eos> So, we take a turd in our hand.<eos> Cigarro.<eos> Yes, cigarro.<eos> Then what?<eos> You put it in your mouth.
We hear that fires burn bright in Florence and the Friar Savonarola still preaches.<eos> The people flock to him.<eos> You gave him our apostolic letter commanding his silence?<eos> And he wiped his ass upon it.<eos> So... we must lay charges of heresy against him.<eos> And he will laugh-<eos> Laugh in our face.<eos> We know. I do not have authority to lay the charge of heresy.<eos> Patience.<eos> You will have it.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries..."<eos> The only thing stronger than your craving for blood is your love for this one girl.<eos> Your humanity is killing you.<eos> Turn it off!
Any idea what kind of Klaus-killing weapon could be magically sealed in a mystery coffin?<eos> ABBY:<eos> Slow down.<eos> STEFAN:<eos> Keep up.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> - Sorry, Stefan, I didn't have a choice.<eos> STEFAN:<eos> There's always a choice, Bonnie.<eos> You made it and now we have to live with it.
Hanging out with your new besties?<eos> I'm the mayor, Damon.<eos> When the oldest, deadliest family of vampires moves into your town, you welcome them with a smile. Hmm.<eos> Well, at least you know who you're borrowing that cup of sugar from.<eos> I'm trying to protect this town.<eos> They assure me they want peace I've assured them that I'd enforce it.<eos> KOL: Mayor Lockwood.<eos> We haven't formally met.<eos> Kol Mikaelson.<eos> We hope your lovely town embraces us just as much as we plan to embrace it.
Or you're gonna stay in there and burn.<eos> REBEKAH:<eos> The next match is landing on you.<eos> So, Elena, how does it feel to know that these may be your last moments?<eos> ELENA:<eos> I don't know, you tell me.<eos> You're the one whose mother is trying to kill you.<eos> You should be very careful what you say to me.<eos> You're still wearing her necklace.<eos> Do you want it?
- Can't figure out what it is, though.<eos> - Why don't you get inside her head?<eos> Because it's impossible.<eos> She's too strong.<eos> - Bet I could get in.<eos> - She's an Original.<eos> Not gonna happen.<eos> Have you forgotten everything I taught you?<eos> Rebekah may be an Original, but she's a girl.<eos> You find her weakness and exploit it, and I'll walk right in.
Yeah. Me.<eos> I'm the chair of the dance committee.<eos> The theme of the decade dance is the 1970s.<eos> So you'd rather dress in tacky colors with bad hair than be a classic flapper from the jazz age?<eos> I don't know what my brother sees in you.<eos> Maybe he sees a challenge.<eos> You see, unlike some other people I don't sleep with everyone I make eye contact with.<eos> - Maybe we could do both decades.<eos> - No. Go on, Matt, don't be a coward.<eos> You know you loved my '20s idea when I presented it to the group.
And do what?<eos> Go on the run for the rest of my life?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> And I'm not an invalid.<eos> I'm done with the couch.<eos> So you're just gonna let her call the shots?<eos> - I let her make her own decisions.<eos> - Even if they're wrong?<eos> Nothing wrong with free will, Matt.<eos> Trust me... you don't realize that until you lose it.
[ Reo Speedwagon's "Ridin' the Storm Out" plays ]<eos> Who the hell -- Leviathan!<eos> ♪ wine bottle's low stay the hell away from me.<eos> Your world is whatever I want it to be, understand?
Lydia.<eos> Hey, it's, uh, Dean from last night.<eos> Uh-huh. Uh, listen, I think I left something over at your place.<eos> It was an old flask.<eos> It doesn't look like much, but it has sentimental value.<eos> So, uh, have you seen it?<eos> No.<eos> But if I do, I'll call.<eos> You want my number?<eos> My cell grabbed it.
Remember that cross-country murder spree those crazy brothers went on a couple months ago?<eos> That's them?<eos> Barely scratches the surface.<eos> They're thugs.<eos> Vigilantes.<eos> But, look, we've dealt with hunters like this before.<eos> Well... The one is already scheduled to be taken care of.<eos> We'll just simply add the other one to the agenda.<eos> I know Bobby's got a Grecian encyclopedia of weird in here.<eos> I saw it last time I was looking through this stupid...
What was her name?<eos> What?<eos> The last one he killed.<eos> Uh, Anna?<eos> Anna Paxton.<eos> Marjorie Willis.<eos> She's the next one on the list.<eos> List?<eos> What list?<eos> The demon used to recite it all the time, like a grocery list.

I hate them.<eos> But then I think how Dale was.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> His friends left him behind, but you know what he said?<eos> "I'm gonna send them a gift that shows I forgive them."<eos> Do you have any idea what he sent them?<eos> Bottle of saki.<eos> From one of his trips.<eos> In a...gorgeous box with writing.<eos> He was so careful with it.

This is about them Levis living here forever, one-percenter style while we march our dopey, fat asses down to the shiny new death camps at every corner.<eos> [COMPUTER BEEPS]<eos> It's an e-mail from Frank.<eos> - That jackass, always stealing my thunder.<eos> "Sam and Dean, if you're reading this, I'm dead.<eos> Or worse.<eos> This e-mail was sent because some prince is trying to hack into my hard drive right this second. So unless it's you, you got trouble.<eos> Um, ahem. Okay. My drive is full of compromising info.<eos> Your new aliases hangouts, where you stored your car..."<eos> - Baby? Even though he encrypted his drive, he says we should assume that someone can hack into it eventually.
But these things are gonna eat everyone I know.<eos> What kind of douchebag stands by for that?<eos> However, I've never broken into anything in real life before.<eos> So plan?<eos> - You got a Bluetooth? - Yeah.<eos> Security system, can you get into that?<eos> I can reroute any surveillance cameras we need.<eos> Let's start with that.<eos> Do you have a keycard to get into the building?<eos> Uh, yeah, I can't duplicate it, but I can make a fake tag...
I'm guessing me.<eos> You heard him -- thorny beauty, blah, blah.<eos> I'm the Saint who stayed with him.<eos> He owes me.<eos> His words.<eos> Yeah, what about what he owes us?<eos> Well, work on him a little.<eos> Maybe he'll start crushing on you, too, hot stuff.<eos> What are you gonna do with a broken angel? Don't be stupid.<eos> I'll take power where I can get it.
At the end of the day, that list is all she's got.<eos> You think she got a little creative with the data entry?<eos> Would you blame her?<eos> I wouldn't, but I'm not willing to throw away a man's entire career over a little embellishment.<eos> Track down Stacey.<eos> Find out if Keating was really one of her Johns.<eos> Well, it's not the nicest place I've ever spent the afternoon, but it's an occupational hazard, I guess.<eos> Well, I can get you out of here, and I can make sure you never have to come back here again, but you need to let me give them your client list.<eos> No.<eos> The U.S. attorney is gonna get his hands on it eventually, and it is the only leverage you have.
How can Zoidberg walk out with that much weight?<eos> And he may be invisible, but he's not insmellable.<eos> He stinks like the inside of a tauntaun.<eos> Won't someone notice the stench?<eos> No, and to keep you on your toes, I'll explain why only after the heist has begun.<eos> The key to the whole operation is the casino's shrimp buffet.<eos> Today is Friday, the day the week-old shrimp get hauled off, so the stench should be just strong enough to mask Zoidberg's presence.<eos> Ew, what's bringing the stank?<eos> It ain't my gambling diaper.<eos> I just changed it.
Hmm, I've never flown a pyramid before, but I used to drive around town in a mausoleum.<eos> How many people can this thing carry?<eos> Well, the mausoleum held ten horny teenagers, so... maybe 30,000.<eos> It's our moral duty to save as many lives as possible.<eos> They had their chance.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Mind if I appear?<eos> Welcome to the Hidey House.<eos> Brannigan, tell me about this freaky-deaky escape pyramid.<eos> I can fly it, sir.
Oh, thank God, Professor.<eos> You got here just in time.<eos> I've seen this before.<eos> Langdon Cobb must be from Bryoria Six, home of the quantum lichen people.<eos> Well, that explains that.<eos> They're attention parasites.<eos> They feed on the admiration of their prey.<eos> Just like the noble buffalo.<eos> Nothing like a buffalo.<eos> Anyone who pays attention to the lichen is unknowingly feeding it.
Wife, son, I am so sorry.<eos> Once I started upgrading myself, I lost all control.<eos> But I see now that if you can't be man enough with your own parts, no amount of machinery will help.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> But faster than that!<eos> It's that insane robot, Roberto.<eos> Quick, Hermes, the keys.<eos> I left them in my other body.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> And I'm-a stick 'em in your pancreas till I find one that opens it.
We're not murdering anyone, Bender.<eos> Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate?<eos> That's not a bad idea, Fry. Yeah, wh-what?<eos> We're looking for something that fits in here.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.<eos> What's this chair-looking gizmo?<eos> Welcome to Momcorp.<eos> Did you find everything you were burgling for?<eos> No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me.
That shuffling idiot never did complete the free will unit.<eos> To this day, my poor, sweet robots can't exterminate humanity without being told to.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Oh, it's not your fault.<eos> I give up.<eos> It's time to face the fact that I'll never do anything remotely interesting or unexpected again.<eos> Hand it over.<eos> Wha...?<eos> Mom may have fallen for your lies, but not me.<eos> You invented the free will unit, then you selfishly hid it beyond the reach of my stealers.
I don't know anything about plants.<eos> Understood, but just try and picture.<eos> Was there anything on the border between the garden and the farmland?<eos> There was a flood there in 2006.<eos> Killed off pretty much everything.<eos> You could see straight up to the trees. There was nothing, nothing growing.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The blackcurrant bushes weren't there when I bought the place.<eos> Somebody dumped the body after I bought it! They dumped it with the blackcurrant bush for me to find it. Who would dump a body in your garden?
- Hey, hey, hey, Lincoln Bay this is Cami Q coming at you live.<eos> You all feeling good today?<eos> [CLAPPING] I got a special message from our good friend Radio Rebel.<eos> - This is Radio Rebel coming at you with a little lunch time surprise--<eos> - That girl invaded our airwaves.<eos> Does she have to ruin my lunch to?<eos> - Now, a lot of you guys have IMed and texted me about the powers at be taking away our music... and how it feels like one of ourselves is being taken away.<eos> [CROWD BOOS] - That's not gonna make us better students. [UNISON]<eos> - Woah!<eos> - And you can't punish someone for relaxing during their down time... like Principal Moreno, you stole our music and I'm giving it back.
I know what you mean.<eos> Feel like we've been gone a year.<eos> Or four.<eos> You really need to talk to him.<eos> And tell him what?<eos> I, uh, sort of killed you, but you were trying to kill me, so you totally had it coming?<eos> - That wasn't your Henry.<eos> - I know. And logically, I understand, but...<eos> We didn't just witness this alternate reality.<eos> We lived it.
You look tired.<eos> And beautiful.<eos> You wouldn't want to give me a hand with that phosphor cryo-module, would you?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I have tons of Astraeus launch telemetry to go through.<eos> Wh... why?<eos> 'Cause I'm the captain, Henry.<eos> It was my mission, and I need answers.<eos> Grace, you know the answer.<eos> We found it.
What's going on?<eos> We're under attack.<eos> From who?<eos> Unknown!<eos> A pulse weapon has knocked out the power grid, communications are down and we have voltage spikes in the reactor turbines.<eos> Radar is tracking an incoming missile.<eos> How close?<eos> 30 seconds to impact. HENRY:<eos> Close.<eos> The EM shield will knock it out before impact, if we can keep it online.
Well, you didn't hear it from me, but there may be a way.<eos> You should see a junction a few meters ahead of you.<eos> I'm nearing the junction.<eos> The Panop system is ready to go online, sir.<eos> Sorry. Habit.<eos> Now you have people calling you sir. They wouldn't dare.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Leadership suits you, Jo.<eos> I always thought it would.<eos> You miss it?
Come on, come on!<eos> Go that way, go that way!<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Here, Sweetie.<eos> Good idea.<eos> Good thinking!<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> - Come on, Sweetie.<eos> Good, good, good, good.<eos> I got it!
Chailey!<eos> Chailey Morris!<eos> - Chailey! - Chailey!<eos> She's not texting back.<eos> - Chailey! - Chailey!<eos> Oh, for Christ's sake, Banjo, you've pissed the bed.<eos> Poppy.<eos> - Disgusting.<eos> Where's that necklace?<eos> I'm sure I had it when we got back from the restaurant.
Stop a moment. Stop. Just a moment.<eos> I want to ask you something.<eos> If Johnny's allowed to do it, so am I.<eos> Elise, will you marry me? - No.<eos> Please.<eos> Help me, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> Elise!<eos> - No!<eos> Pass me a pin.<eos> Just stick it in.
Zane Donovan?<eos> You're under arrest for obstruction ofjustice and destroying evidence.<eos> Fargo, I think I found the Smart Dust Controller.<eos> Hi.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been trying to reach you for hours.<eos> Sorry, I guess the Smart Dust is still, yeah, messing with the cell reception.<eos> But we found the control unit, which is good.<eos> Fargo says he'll have it fixed soon.
You can cut him loose.<eos> But he's your responsibility.<eos> Gather your team.<eos> I want Monroe found.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Promise me you won't wander off.<eos> There is something very, very wrong.<eos> People are doing things that don't make any sense, like they've been brainwashed.<eos> Well, with Smart Dust jamming up the works, they could be.<eos> Jack said you found the control unit and you were fixing it.
We need their bomb to nullify the N.P.C. S' Z - wave signature.<eos> We're going to have to do this ourselves.<eos> But we have to connect it to the Smart Dust control unit to amplify the pulse.<eos> I bet the clone army's using it to power the new Matrix computer.<eos> Yeah, except we don't have the Z-bomb.<eos> That does pose an issue.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Zane said the Z-bomb fit in his pocket.<eos> So, if he and Parrish were taken, maybe he could still have it.<eos> So, we just need to find out where they're being held and activate it.
Took four departments three years to develop the Smart Dust control mechanism.<eos> But I'm sure the Director will crack it in no time.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, and in the meantime, you and I are gonna see if we can track it down.<eos> So, please tell me it emits some sort of super-energy lightning wave that we can track.<eos> Sorry, boss, no.<eos> Right.<eos> Then, motive.<eos> What does it do?
You refer to Mrs. Lily Bell?<eos> Sir, shall we take a walk?<eos> Mr. Gundersen, have you ever had your heart ripped out by a woman?<eos> I was married once, sir, but she ran off with a gypsy.<eos> My heart was not ripped out, but she did steal my cuckoo clock.<eos> Well, my gypsy is Bohannon.<eos> Loki, yeah.<eos> - What?<eos> - So he and Mrs. Lily Bell.<eos> I gave him a chance to run, but he wouldn't take it.
What? !<eos> We're Christian Scientists.<eos> We don't accept medical care for ourselves, and we don't permit it for our children.<eos> But your son has cancer!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Christian Science.<eos> Is that, is that that thing all them gaybo Hollywood actors do to keep their stuff away from other guys' butts?<eos> Don't you understand?<eos> Scotty needs help.<eos> And he'll get it... through faith.
Look, I, I think it's a great idea and I, I'm completely with you.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Let's try it.<eos> Yay, that is such good news.<eos> And I'm so happy they gave us a booth.<eos> I know, 'cause they're supposed to be reserved for parties of three or more.<eos> I know!<eos> Oh, Stewie, it's so nice to finally have someone to do naughty things with.<eos> Definitely.<eos> All right, I made a wallet bomb and I planted it on Mort.
One laughs in my face about my company going under... and this one kept nagging us to come back out here to remind us why we haven't seen each other in 20 years.<eos> - Rafa, please.<eos> - What about you?<eos> Still in love with your high school boyfriend who blew you off and always will.<eos> But we forget everything, right?<eos> No problem. We smoke a couple joints and forget everything.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> And now all that prophet crap has to come out...<eos> There's my list, Sara.<eos> Toss it in the fire for me.
And because of that, he could have died.<eos> He didn't.<eos> Because of bad choices that I made.<eos> You've got to stop punishing yourself.<eos> He told me I shouldn't be there.<eos> I knew he was right.<eos> We'd have a suspect in custody and every little bit of his story would add up.<eos> But somehow... I knew I could... I could always... spot the lie, when no-one else could.<eos> I always knew about Cat. You have to stop this. I knew when Cat was thinking about her.<eos> I didn't want to believe it, so I put it to the back of my mind.
Uh, yes.<eos> That's why I don't have the luxury of lying around at 11:00 in my underthings.<eos> I didn't tell you that part.<eos> You didn't say I was incorrect, either.<eos> Where the hell are you from?<eos> You sound like Cary Grant.<eos> I told you, midtown.<eos> Why don't I--<eos> Listen, I really should return this-- You know, the wallet.<eos> I could slip it in the post or...

She married joyfully of her own free will.<eos> you'll be home soon, dear sister.<eos> Here is me with Marshmallow!<eos> My pony!<eos> Oh... he died.<eos> I was riding him and I thought he just tripped, but he never got up.<eos> And here's Uncle Wendel.<eos> No, that's Aunt Jane.<eos> You know, all this cooking we're doing is for my daughter Karen's wedding reception tomorrow.<eos> We're having it here.
- You like to get mad. - No, I don't.<eos> - That's what gets you going.<eos> - That is not what this is.<eos> Now sit down!<eos> You're gonna eat dinner with me.<eos> Do you want any cheese? - No. Do you want--<eos> - I'll clean it up later.<eos> You used to love your work.<eos> Well, it's different there now.<eos> You loved it before you ever met me.
Boy, were they impressed with him.<eos> This isa big win for your little agency.<eos> You really eat English muffins?<eos> Yes, but they're not English.<eos> Well, to those of us at 4 A's, everything about you is American... your sense of humor, your hard work.<eos> A lot of people enjoying *.<eos> And just use it as an excuse to drink and hand out business cards.<eos> Well, there has been a bit of that.<eos> There's an unelected position as head of our fiscal control committee.<eos> We'd be honored to have you run it.
- Really?<eos> - You can take the train.<eos> It's not that easy.<eos> I've gotta sneak off campus, which is serious.<eos> Plus, it's a 20-minute bike ride to the station and then two hours on the train.<eos> Forget it.<eos> For a year you've been saying how much you wanted to visit me.<eos> Are we ever gonna see each other?<eos> All right.<eos> The earliest I can get to grand central is 8:30, but I'm gonna have to work on my paper tonight to get it typed tomorrow.
I looked for her and finally just thought maybe she came back here.<eos> I just need my bag, okay?<eos> Calm down.<eos> - When was this?<eos> - I Don't know.<eos> I was at the museum for a long time.<eos> I... I really looked for her.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> I just want my bag.<eos> I would have left it, but I've got a book on nat Turner in there and my paper's due tomorrow.
I can't sleep.<eos> Well, you cannot sneak up on someone my age, especially in this house.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Can I sit with you?<eos> Only for a bit.<eos> What's that for?<eos> Why are you scared?<eos> I read the newspaper.<eos> Honey.<eos> Did you pull it out of the trash?
Get the water.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's Seconal.<eos> Do you know how to take a pill?<eos> You two stop it.<eos> Damn it, Joanie!<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Gail, out!<eos> Take him out of here!<eos> Open this door or I will kick it down!
- Honey, they don't want to talk about that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You know, if he wasn't a writer, we never would have met.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - I work in publishing.<eos> My boss was rejecting him and I thought it was all he could handle.<eos> What was the story? - Forget it.<eos> - No, we want to know.<eos> It's called "The Punishment Of X4."<eos> There's this bridge between these two planets and thousands of humans travel on it every day.
I just want to be a part of this place.<eos> I think it's on the way up.<eos> I got the job.<eos> You don't say...<eos> I can't stay that long...<eos> I have to go back and redo the Heinz speech.<eos> What?<eos> It's purple and silver.<eos> Don gave it to me before a presentation once. - No.<eos> - I need it.
If you go to sleep, when you wake up, I'll tell you.<eos> I thought you hated that song.<eos> You keep telling her to stop singing it.<eos> And now it's stuck in my head.<eos> - Megan! - Go away!<eos> - Op the door.<eos> - No.<eos> Open the damn door.<eos> I don't want to see you.<eos> Open the door or I'm gonna kick it in.
I have nothing, Don. Megan!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> There's a point when you go from going home on the 5:25 to the 7:05.<eos> I didn't want to play cards anyway.<eos> I was supposed to talk to Dunphy, but he's sick again.<eos> You know, the other top salesman in my department, he reads all day long and I'm out here on the train hustling people.<eos> I'm really having a lean month.<eos> Okay, Howard, I knew this day would come.<eos> Look, I already have life insurance.<eos> It came with my junior partnership.
Sure, why don't I get it?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, and don't mention anything about being a werewolf.<eos> Right, 'cause I usually lead with that.<eos> What's up with him?<eos> Look, um, Mom didn't come over much when Danny was around.<eos> And it's been years since we were able to sit down and just be us.<eos> I want that. I miss that.<eos> OK.<eos> OK, that is, um... Like someone threw up in a coffee cup and microwaved it?
Did you see that jump?<eos> Shall we?<eos> Wait, there's a guy about to do a trick!<eos> You're wasting time, "Blue Hands"!<eos> Did you come along to do anything?<eos> Come on.<eos> Will we ski this afternoon?<eos> Put on your ski mask.<eos> I can't, it itches.<eos> Put it back on and keep it on, even if you get caught.
- What you got?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Where did you know the owner from?<eos> What do you care?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Can you ask the boy to come here?<eos> Can you come over here, for five minutes?<eos> There was a watch in the bathroom.<eos> It's no longer there.<eos> Do you have it?

You okay?<eos> He's a very stupid man.<eos> Look, I, uh...<eos> I know we're here to find dad.<eos> We're going to.<eos> But when we do, and when we go home, I just want you to know things don't have to go back to the way they were.<eos> You know, it's okay for you to move on, if that's what you want.<eos> I want... my family back.<eos> That's all I want.<eos> I should never have let it come apart in the first place.
I should call them.<eos> Can you give me their home number?<eos> No, why do you have to call them?<eos> Because my daughter hosted a party That their son has yet to return from.<eos> I should at least take some responsibility for that.<eos> Look, I know you're upset and frustrated That your friend is going through something And he ran off instead of turning to you for help.<eos> I'm sure when he's ready what's going on with him.<eos> Uh, we should go to spencer's.<eos> Aren't you gonna see her at school?<eos> We have a group presentation, And we need to run it one more time.
Out!<eos> Okay.<eos> Wrong direction!<eos> Tobi will help you adjust.<eos> He's the highest ranking of the group...<eos> Got it. Learn a bit from him, do it for my future.<eos> No problem.<eos> He's your buddy and you follow his lead!<eos> Give me your bag.<eos> I need to check it.
Quick, give it to me.<eos> Give me the ax.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Put them on the wagon!<eos> There's more here.<eos> Come on.<eos> What do we have here?<eos> No!<eos> That's a fine little blade.<eos> Maybe I'll pick my teeth with it.
Well, it's just to tell you the estimate is done ... the estimate and...<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me, Mr Echard, I don't know if I should ask this, but do you think you could avoid smoking at work?<eos> There'd have to be a law forbidding me, my dear.<eos> This machine was made for a woman not for an elefant.<eos> I was saying, I've already done the estimate.<eos> We have to face the obvious, Bob, we have a problem.<eos> You French see problems everywhere.<eos> Make everything climb to the sky.<eos> We didn' rebuild half the city after the war to eventually replace it with New York.
Attention!<eos> Hands above your keyboards. 358 strokes! Two goddamn characters, and we'd have qualified.<eos> If you typed with 10 fingers like them, it could have been possible.<eos> Don't worry !<eos> This is not a sport for clumsy girls.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop, please. I'll continue on foot.<eos> You should have got angry at the typewriter.<eos> Now, it's too late.<eos> I could have opened it by myself.
Nathaniel, can I speak with you privately?<eos> A moment, please.<eos> Take your time.<eos> - You still want her out, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Lola and I are coming up with a plan.<eos> - No need.<eos> I've taken care of it.<eos> There's a paper in London in need of a facelift.<eos> I've arranged for Diana to take it over at a bargain price.
Should we pick you up around 8?<eos> - "We"?<eos> - I'm Dalia's driver.<eos> NOAH:<eos> Whew.<eos> I'm not doing underwear.<eos> That's fine, right?<eos> [NOAH EXHALES SHARPLY]<eos> Close the door.<eos> Marty, I was in the process of closing it as you're telling me to.
The substance is fire given form.<eos> And we have been perfecting it since the days of Maegor.<eos> To do what?<eos> The jars are put in catapults and flung at the enemy.<eos> How much do you have?<eos> If you could get real soldiers to man the catapults, then maybe you'd hit your target one time in ten, but all the real soldiers are in the Riverlands with your father.<eos> My lord, this man is insulting.<eos> I don't know if you've ever seen a battle, old man, but things can get a bit messy.<eos> 'Cause when we're flinging things at Stannis, he's flinging them right back at us.<eos> Men die, men shit themselves, men run, which means pots falling, which means fire inside the walls, which means the poor cunts trying to defend the city end up burning it down.
Why do you think that someone as powerful as the Dark One would work for a useless fool like the Duke of the Frontlands?<eos> Tell me.<eos> The Duke has the Dark One in thrall.<eos> He's enslaved him with the power of a mystical dagger.<eos> And on the blade is written a name. The true name of the Dark One.<eos> If you were to steal the dagger, then you would control the Dark One yourself, and then no one would be able to take your son away from you.<eos> What? To keep a man like the Dark One as a slave?<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'd be terrified.<eos> Then perhaps, instead of controlling the power, you need to take it.
Papa?<eos> What has happened to you?<eos> You're safe, Bae.<eos> Do you feel safe, Son?<eos> No.<eos> I'm frightened.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I protected what belongs to me. And I'm not scared of anything.<eos> The Sheriff's jacket.<eos> I thought you might want it after all.
So I call the shots.<eos> Moment I let some con float on credit, and not gouge him for the privilege of doing business...<eos> Starts thinking that maybe he can call the shots.<eos> So you have to be tough.<eos> No emotion, kid.<eos> It's how you gotta be.<eos> You can't care about anyone or anything.<eos> Moment they see a soft spot, they got you by the short hairs.<eos> You want to be my protege, it's lesson number one.<eos> Well, I've learned it, Mr. Sweeney.
You here to help with my zipper?<eos> 20%...<eos> I get my box back. 50.<eos> 30.<eos> 50.<eos> And you should be overjoyed I'm letting you keep anything at all.<eos> You can always crown another rat to take over your operation.<eos> 50%.<eos> Now give me my box.<eos> I told you, I don't have it.

How have you been?<eos> If being meticulous about my maintenance is "doing fine," fine.<eos> You sound aggravated, mate.<eos> What's bothering you? Everything.<eos> The media's take on these suicide bombings bothers me.<eos> Having a president who jumps at shadows...<eos> Being summoned by Gilmore... The whole damn world bothers me.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Nevertheless, Dr. Gilmore created us.<eos> And when the world needs us, we reunite with him to defend it.
Deployment of nuclear missiles requires multiple authorizations.<eos> A mutiny might have broken out aboard the ship.<eos> Sorry, I'd really like to trust you guys, but...<eos> Heat bloom detected!<eos> Six, five, four...<eos> Contact with targets... Now!<eos> Did we get them?<eos> We missed it!<eos> Francoise, can you handle the missile's trajectory calculations?<eos> It looks like our only option is to detonate it directly.
No, you cannot give your sister a haircut.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Well, I'll fix it later.<eos> Just don't let her look in any mirrors.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Where were we?<eos> Well, I was just about to ask you your opinion of the long-term viability of the euro.<eos> Ah, well...<eos> Where's my menu?<eos> - The waiter took it. - What?
It makes you stop believing in god.<eos> Okay, Bree, I get it.<eos> And did I mention that I was soaking wet?<eos> Three times.<eos> Good, because I wanna be very clear just how your advice worked out.<eos> Can I say something?<eos> I... think you had a blast.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I can see it in your eyes.<eos> You're telling me about this horrible story, but you love telling it.
No.<eos> Well, it's nice to see her again.<eos> But I'll tell you, I am sick and tired of sitting here for a stolen credit card.<eos> Why don't you ship me to Rikers and go hassle some real criminals, like someone who was, uh, jaywalking or something?<eos> Yeah, funny guy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How long you think that smile's going to be on his face?<eos> I'd say ten, 15 seconds, depending how fast you speak.<eos> Well, we got good news and bad news.<eos> The bad news is we found the gun right where you left it behind Laddie Liquors with your fingerprints on it in the Dumpster with the ballistics matching the murder weapon.
Francisco Francis broke into the Inagua office.<eos> ClearBec's own report stated what was happening and how they were involved.<eos> They had orders to find Francis and kill any residents that were trying to get out.<eos> No one knew what to do with the sick and the dying.<eos> They began to execute everyone.<eos> I was offered $250,000 to take a job in South America.<eos> $250,000?<eos> Who would offer you that?<eos> Her name is Morgan Swinton. She's a major shareholder in ClearBec, the water company.<eos> Her father founded the company and her brother, Bruce, runs it.
You taught me how to swim there.<eos> You brought light to a situation that was in the dark.<eos> Bruce, I'm on my way.<eos> You've saved countless amounts of people and for that I'm very, very thankful to you, Jack Begosian.<eos> Morgan...<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> Don't...<eos> Bruce?<eos> At the end of the day all we can do is search for the truth, learn from it and most importantly, defend it.

- I chopped wood once.<eos> No, I watched my brother chopping wood.<eos> I saw you kill a man with a shield.<eos> You'll be unstoppable with an axe.<eos> - Don't get killed.<eos> - Nor you, my friend.<eos> - Oh, are we friends now?<eos> - Of course we are.<eos> Just because I pay you for your services doesn't diminish our friendship.<eos> Enhances it, really.
Sansa, come here.<eos> I will pray for your safe return, My Lord.<eos> Will you?<eos> Just as I pray for the King's.<eos> Stay safe, My Lady.<eos> And you, my lion.<eos> Your king rides forth to battle.<eos> You should see him off with a kiss.<eos> My new blade.<eos> Hearteater I've named it.

- A girl.<eos> - A wildling.<eos> We could question her.<eos> You could.<eos> She won't answer.<eos> I've known a wildling to bite off his tongue instead of talking.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Ygritte.<eos> She was reaching for this axe when you got to her.<eos> Give her half a chance, she'll bury it in your face.
Other things.<eos> Savage things.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> I always wondered what you had under there.<eos> It comes at a price.<eos> I'm not killing you. That's your price.<eos> I already had that.<eos> What do you want, then, other than your miserable life?<eos> What all free people want... My freedom.<eos> Well, you shall have it, then.
You knew I would not allow it and you did it anyway.<eos> Bran and Rickon are captives in Winterfell.<eos> Sansa and Arya are captives in King's Landing.<eos> I have five children, and only one of them is free.<eos> I lost one son fighting by your son's side.<eos> I lost another to the Kingslayer, strangled with a chain.<eos> You commit treason because your children are prisoners?<eos> I would carve out my heart and offer it to the Father, if he would let my sons wake from their graves and step into a prison cell.<eos> - I grieve for your sons, my lord. - I don't want your grief. I want my vengeance.<eos> And you stole it from me.
Away!<eos> Reset!<eos> If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.<eos> Will it hold?<eos> Can't make promises for the wind, Your Grace.<eos> I admire you, Ser Davos.<eos> I thank you, Your Grace.<eos> Pleased to hear it.<eos> Some highborn fools call you Onion Knight and think they insult you.<eos> So you take the onion for your sigil, sew it on your coat, fly the onion flag.
And then he's followed by another... he's followed by another guy, who's carrying, like, one... like, one coffee table?<eos> And then another... like, another guy is carrying one chair.<eos> Like, where are these guys going with, like, these light loads, you know?<eos> Then we see Jack sitting on a chair, eating lunch.<eos> And the manager and his assistant crosses paths with two women who... and just as he's in the corner of the screen... you just see it for a second.<eos> Can you hear that?<eos> My boy, yelling?<eos> Hold on one second. I'm gonna see if I can... I can see if I can calm him down.<eos> You know, so, like, he's like, leaning back and eating a sandwich. And he's got, you know, a magazine in his lap.<eos> And as he stands up to greet them, he, like, throws it down.
And if there's only two words that you can come up with that have those letters in 'em. And that's "moon" and "room."<eos> And so on the key, the tag, it says "moon room."<eos> And that is the moon room. This is where everything happens, and none of it's real.<eos> And it all has to be lied about.<eos> And he can't let anyone know what's really going on in room 237.<eos> And there's many, many other deviations from the book to the movie.<eos> It isn't real.<eos> The deviations drove Stephen King out of his mind.<eos> He just ranted and ranted for years how much he hated The Shining.<eos> And he hated it because he'd given Kubrick all this great source material and Kubrick threw it out.
- Nobody's come forward.<eos> We talked to neighbors on both sides, and across the street.<eos> Nobody heard anything.<eos> What about wife, children.<eos> Anybody live with him?<eos> Judge lived alone.<eos> His wife died three years ago.<eos> No kids.<eos> Found a gun on the floor over here.<eos> We haven't touched it.

- What about the engraving?<eos> - Professional.<eos> Could've been done by any engraver, anytime, anywhere.<eos> Oh, this is tragic.<eos> What?<eos> Some jerk put glue in the movement.<eos> This watch is destroyed.<eos> I wanna weep.<eos> - Why would somebody do that?<eos> - To stop it from working.
- You know her?<eos> If it's the same Mary Robinson, I do.<eos> Assistant d.A., retired about a year ago.<eos> I worked a lot of cases with her.<eos> I got a bad feeling about this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You find her?<eos> Found her body.<eos> Killer cut out her tongue...<eos> And put it on the scale.
No, no.<eos> Your dad has most probably been diagnosed with cancer.<eos> I'm going to sell out of Belleview.<eos> Carpe diem, as they say, and I want to dedicate myself to my little family.<eos> It's just such a shame Olav isn't here.<eos> There's a strange smell here.<eos> Alcohol, maybe?<eos> - Is it from you or...<eos> - it's the new inventory.<eos> You know, I just had a taste of it.
- Mom?<eos> Keep in mind, every now and then when you have a good hand, you're gonna wanna check to throw the other guys off.<eos> You remember what check means?<eos> That's my boy!<eos> Right, Jonas.<eos> I've unpacked the pajamas, your toothbrush and your retainer.<eos> And you have to remember to try on the folk costume.<eos> Now, Jonas.<eos> You look so nice in a folk costume.<eos> He needs it for when he's giving his speech on the National Day.
Hey, that necklace you're wearing.<eos> - Puka shell, right?<eos> - Yeah, why?<eos> You ever seen this kid around here?<eos> You cops?<eos> Don't worry, he hasn't done anything wrong.<eos> If you've seen him, it's important.<eos> I've seen him around, but I don't know him.<eos> Where'd you get the necklace?<eos> I traded for it.
Well, do you even know where to find them?<eos> I think I do.<eos> Okay, well, let's get going. I'm hungry.<eos> You sure you're okay with this?<eos> Well, I can't exactly let you go alone.<eos> There's no telling what you might buy.<eos> Gracie.<eos> Hanson. - Uh, this is Juliette.<eos> - Hi. I really love the necklace.<eos> You made it, right?
I... I didn't see you.<eos> There.<eos> Oh, uh, yeah.<eos> Uh... sometimes I like to... to see how the colors are working in the natural light.<eos> You know what? Never mind.<eos> It's not important.<eos> Are... are you here to see Regina?<eos> Uh... oh, wait.<eos> I want you to know that speech therapy was Emmett's idea.<eos> I didn't ask him to take it.
That's right, I forgot... and you don't owe me anything. Bay.<eos> ♪♪ that there is always someone between us.<eos> Hey, forget your key? No.<eos> I saw you through the window.<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> Sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> I decided to take coach Medlock's offer. I'm going to join the Buckner team.<eos> I thought we discussed this.<eos> No, I floated the idea and you shot it down. I shot...
What happened was, in 2008 my dad found 12 dead cows out by a creek about a half a mile from our house.<eos> And then, in April about 70% of those cows were either sick or dead.<eos> And by Christmas he had defaulted on his payments and the bank took his house.<eos> The land just died.<eos> It just... It just turned brown and died.<eos> And it made it really easy to see the only things left standing, which were these giant green wells that said Global on them.<eos> Now, these guys at Global, they're real clever.<eos> They have this fine print in the leases they make you sign that says you can't talk about it in a court of law, but...<eos> Hell, I'm pretty sure they don't say anything about telling a couple of friends at a bar.<eos> We had the farm in our family for 150 years, but it only took nine months to lose it.
I have 60% of this land bought and paid for.<eos> It's over.<eos> Steve, you can have 80% of this land bought.<eos> That's only 40% of the vote.<eos> We're not fighting for land, Steve.<eos> We're fighting for people.<eos> You're a fucking...<eos> - These people need help. Okay?<eos> - Steven.<eos> I'm here to give it to 'em.
I was looking at this picture...<eos> Looking at it for a while last night.<eos> For a long while.<eos> And found myself staring at this barn.<eos> The Wood's chipping away and the paint's flaking off there.<eos> Probably from all the salt water in the air.<eos> But it reminded me of my grandfather's barn.<eos> That barn was the bane of my existence.<eos> It was immaculate.<eos> We painted it every other summer.
I might have to follow your orders on missions, but not here.<eos> Hal, wait!<eos> Go back to camp, Matt.<eos> Go back to camp.<eos> You know, maybe he's ready, maybe he's not, but we both know Dad didn't want that for him.<eos> Three months ago.<eos> How do you know what he'd say now? I don't know what he'd say right now, and neither do you, okay?<eos> So how about we wait and let Dad make that decision?<eos> Only way we win this war is by killing every Skitter we see.<eos> If Matt's old enough to load a gun, he's old enough to shoot it.
Especially since you're short a team member.<eos> You mean Taub?<eos> Got him in here.<eos> He asked for a personal day. His daughter's sick.<eos> Isn't that the point of having a spare?<eos> I denied his request.<eos> After I'd already approved it, which you knew because I sent you a memo.<eos> Dr. Adams...<eos> Taped under your chair is an index card.<eos> Would you read it, please?
Dr. Adams...<eos> Taped under your chair is an index card.<eos> Would you read it, please?<eos> "Wednesday, 2:43 p.m., "a black Pawn will believe he's the black King "and attempt to capture the... white head of diagnostics."<eos> - It's 10:15 on Friday.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> Look, the point is I saw this coming.<eos> Dr. Foreman and I did not always see eye-to-eye.<eos> But he never had the power to overrule me.<eos> Now that he has the power, he won't be able to resist the temptation to use it.
You bring Grammy's gun?<eos> Remember to wipe your prints off.<eos> There he is.<eos> Where should we plant it?<eos> Maybe beside all the others.<eos> Jesus.<eos> It's like bringing a joint to a crack house.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Gonna fucking waste - your Peter Pan ass.<eos> - Put it down.
But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts have left their places vacant, in their rooms come thronging soft and delicate desires, all prompting me how fair young Hero is, saying, "I liked her ere I went to wars."<eos> Thou wilt be like a lover presently and tire the hearer with a book of words.<eos> If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it, and I will break with her and with her father, and thou shalt have her.<eos> I know we shall have reveling to-night.<eos> I will assume thy part in some disguise and tell fair Hero I am Claudio, and in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart and take her hearing prisoner with the force and strong encounter of my amorous tale.<eos> Then after to her father will I break, and the conclusion is she shall be thine.<eos> CONRADE: What the good-year, my lord. Why are you thus out of measure sad?<eos> There is no measure in the occasion that breeds, therefore the sadness is without limit.<eos> You should hear reason.<eos> And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
"O, sweet, Benedick!<eos> God give me patience!"<eos> I would she had bestowed this dotage on me.<eos> I would have daffed all other respects and made her half myself.<eos> I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear what he will say.<eos> Were it good, think you?<eos> Hero thinks surely she will die, for she says she will die if he love her not, and she will die, ere she make her love known,<eos> - and she will die if he woo her, - (CRASHES) rather than she will bate one breath of her accustomed crossness.<eos> She doth well.<eos> If she should make tender of her love 'tis very possible he'll scorn it, for the man, as you know all,
Gentlemen, can party! The owner of the rules is sent.<eos> President of the Republic When you read this letter back from his trip to Tunisia I'll be gone already.<eos> Will I stripped my black apron and left the kitchen the Élysée.<eos> If I decided to leave today, did it not feel more to the task entrusted to me.<eos> However, for almost two years gave me with this mission with all the happiness...<eos> With devotion.<eos> But today, Mr. President, I'm tired, terribly tired.<eos> So, it's time for me to leave and give way to a younger, more talented and, perhaps, more obedient.<eos> Held in the shade, my work was sometimes thankless<eos> Rare occasions we were able to find it and not always know if my kitchen was to your liking.
Well, that puts me in a bona fide conundrum.<eos> Lord only knows what kind of family business he needs to speak to you about so urgently.<eos> But if he's willing to travel all this way, he's earned the right to see your ugly mug.<eos> You leave it to me to amend your list myself.<eos> Now get up.<eos> Hey.<eos> How am I supposed to get back?<eos> Walk.<eos> The Amber alert for Dylan Callahan...<eos> You need to cancel it immediately.
Just in time for the American Civil War.<eos> I like it very much.<eos> I guess that makes me something of a...<eos> Phillumenist.<eos> That's number two.<eos> Now tell me what you did to your brother.<eos> My brother died of Scarlet fever.<eos> That's a lie, son.<eos> Your father would like to know the truth.<eos> It'll give me great pleasure to be able to tell it to him.
She said there had been some kind of accident...<eos> A chemical spill on the island.<eos> They wouldn't let us back, so we stayed at a motel.<eos> And then the call came.<eos> He died.<eos> They sent us his things a few days later, but they never told us what happened.<eos> Do you have any of his things from Alcatraz?<eos> Oh, I have the box the prison sent us.<eos> Could we maybe take it with us?<eos> I mean, I promise I'll bring it back.
Give me your wallet now!<eos> Give me your fucking wallet!<eos> I put my shit up to this bitch, and I was going,<eos> "Yo, fucking get on your goddamn knees "before I shoot your motherfucking face off."<eos> "Give me your motherfucking money, I won't kill you."<eos> Give me your fucking wallet, now!<eos> You fucking hear me? You fucking hear me?<eos> "You want to fucking die tonight? "You want to fucking die tonight?<eos> Give me all your goddamn money.<eos> "Give it to me now!"
You wanna make out?<eos> You're as dumb as him.<eos> Good one, Ben.<eos> I thought you were bigtime cocksuckers, but it turns out you're cool.<eos> You see...<eos> Leo... I'm touched.<eos> When's your show again?<eos> It's fucked.<eos> We're on air in two hours.<eos> Why not do it here?
I found a book, there were some photos in it, but it was mostly written in Japanese.<eos> Japanese?<eos> That's interesting.<eos> Don't expect me to translate it though.<eos> Ich sprechen some Deutsch, but that's about it.<eos> There's a whole bunch of different kinds of spiders, you know?<eos> Some molt, some eat their young, which I consider the height of bad parenting, but as far as we're concerned, they're pretty harmless to us.<eos> Well, what about the kind that suck the insides out of their victims?<eos> Oh, that kind of spider.<eos> - You know it? - Yeah.
Yeah, that's it.<eos> On our way.<eos> Don't bother to sit.<eos> We just got a hit on the Rolex watch.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Washington middle school.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Principal just called.<eos> He's one of our seventh graders.<eos> Took it home and showed it to his mother.

She was very upset, called the school, brought it down here, and as soon as I looked at it, I realized it was a very expensive watch.<eos> I wanted to make sure it wasn't stolen, so I called the police before I did anything else, and here you are.<eos> And, uh, did Ben tell you where he got the watch?<eos> Another student. Sally Marcinko.<eos> Sally.<eos> Hi, I'm Nick.<eos> Your name's Sally?<eos> Look, you don't have to be scared.<eos> We just want to know where you got the watch.<eos> I-I-I found it.

Could we see the cut?<eos> You're not squeamish, are you?<eos> Not so bad now.<eos> Almost healed.<eos> Any other body parts you want to see?<eos> I told you where I got the watch.<eos> Right, a swap meet.<eos> For $200.<eos> A $20,000 Rolex.<eos> The guy selling it thought it was a knockoff.
It won't stop.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're gonna miss that handoff.<eos> Emma.<eos> What?<eos> You know that bug you planted?<eos> I think Regina found it.
But the King has read my diary, found my mirror.<eos> Soon he will discover the truth about us.<eos> There is no escape.<eos> There is always an escape.<eos> Your father said what's in this box would give you your freedom.<eos> Yes, I believe it will.<eos> The Agrabahn viper-- a snake so deadly it can kill anything.<eos> With a single bite.<eos> This serpent is from my homeland.<eos> I know all too well of its poison, but why would you have it brought here?
You are a coward, Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And no matter how thick you make your skin, that doesn't change.<eos> I'm not a coward, dearie.<eos> It's quite simple, really.<eos> My power means more to me than you.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> You just don't think I can love you.<eos> Now you've made your choice.<eos> And you're going to regret it.
I am forever indebted to you.<eos> Pay me back by walking down the aisle with someone you truly belong with.<eos> And perhaps giving me a horse and supplies for a journey as well.<eos> - Done.<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> To find Snow White.<eos> You are going after her.<eos> True love isn't easy.<eos> But it must be fought for.

Stay inside, hide your children, forget your livestock.<eos> You've said all this before.<eos> But I haven't said howl know.<eos> Nearly three score years ago, I was a child with six older brothers big as oak trees, all of them veterans of the second Ogres-war.<eos> And my father, the biggest of them all.<eos> Come one wolfstime, he decided to go out and take on the wolf.<eos> A different wolf back then, of course, but just as fearsome.<eos> They went out there to protect me.<eos> I was supposed to be asleep, but I crawled out on the roof to watch and lay down in the thatch.<eos> They had the beast surrounded, the seven of them, with spears all pointed in at it.
Help me!<eos> Please help me!<eos> Give me your hand.<eos> It's okay, dear.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But I'll never ride again.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> The only way to overcome fear is to face it. To get back on that horse as soon as possible.
I created a truce in the ogres-war, Bae.<eos> I walked into the field of battle, and I made it stop.<eos> I led the children home.<eos> Surely a man who's saved a thousand lives... is done.<eos> A man who's saved a thousand lives can be done with it.<eos> You can stop doing things.<eos> I can't.<eos> I need more power so I can protect you.<eos> I wouldn't need protecting if you didn't have power.<eos> Well, I can't get rid of it.
She's coming to you for legal advice.<eos> And you want me to steer her toward you.<eos> I can get her there. It's just that knowing who you are and your nature, trust is a big ask.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Fear not.<eos> A gentle nudge I shall provide.<eos> Align the gear on the spindle, now press the spring.<eos> Good work.<eos> You fixed it, eh? Bravo.
What?<eos> You know what Regina did.<eos> Yes, but we can't prove it.<eos> And given the Mayor's sway in this town, any proceedings against her would be long, drawn out and futile.<eos> The only certainty is, Henry would suffer.<eos> I can't do that to your boy.<eos> So we leave him in the same house with that sociopath?<eos> I'm sorry, Sheriff.<eos> My mind's made up.<eos> Well, then change it.
Doesn't seem right.<eos> Please.<eos> The last couple of weeks haven't exactly been easy for me, and you've been there the whole time.<eos> I can't help it.<eos> I feel responsible for you.<eos> Ever since I found you.<eos> You know, after all this time, no one's ever told me the story.<eos> What story?<eos> About how you found me.<eos> It's probably because I'm the only one who knows it.
What do you want?<eos> I suppose I see the allure.<eos> I wonder if you'll be quite so incorruptible after your precious Snow is gone.<eos> Whatever she did to you, leave her alone and take my life instead.<eos> Oh, who said anything about taking her life?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I have a far more satisfying brand of punishment for her.<eos> Jefferson.<eos> So you got my message.<eos> How could I miss it?
This is a very special place, Belle.<eos> The waters that run below are said to have the power to return that which one has lost.<eos> Henry, what's going on here?<eos> If the curse is broken, why didn't they go back?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What is that?<eos> Something bad.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> We're in a land without magic, Belle. And I'm bringing it.
Jill.<eos> Ugh.<eos> This should be a quick procedure.<eos> Take your time, doctor.<eos> Money's no object.<eos> We're not paid by the hour.<eos> Well, even if you were, I would say take all the time that you need.<eos> She's worth every penny.<eos> Our main concern is that the break heals cleanly.<eos> So we'll re-break the nose and set it properly.
The law and the people in the law are all in his pocket.<eos> Think of the money politicians have taken from grandpa over the years.<eos> Not only that, he was robbed of his company, and humiliated.<eos> In this country, politicians, men in power, they are all third-rate gangsters.<eos> But Korea's improved a lot, hasn't it?<eos> Improved, my ass.<eos> Who knows what the future holds.<eos> Let's say we sell out to US financiers, because of succession problems.<eos> I'd get mountains of cash, but what about the company?<eos> Would it be run rationally?
Why'd you even fight for custody?<eos> Why not send them to their mother?<eos> Beautiful.<eos> Excellent.<eos> I shouldn't have seen that.<eos> I invested in a copper mine in Uzbekistan.<eos> Hit the jackpot.<eos> How big?<eos> Wanna join me?<eos> Set up a company With no connection to me, and list it on the stock market, okay?
And what did he say?<eos> He stuck his tongue in my mouth.<eos> And then?<eos> He pressed his cock against me and started rubbing.<eos> Yeah?<eos> we didn't do anything because we didn't know how.<eos> And then?<eos> He said he would show me something if I did the same. - What did you show him?<eos> - My pussy.<eos> - Did he touched it?
I don't know what's happening right now but whatever he told you is a lie.<eos> The Intersect is- - It's damaged your memory or something because the Sarah that I know would never do something like this.<eos> Baby, please, It's me.<eos> It's your Chuck.<eos> Get the hell out of there, Walker.<eos> Don't.<eos> This can't be happening.<eos> Doesn't make any sense.<eos> She attached an explosive to the door.<eos> She could detonate it at any second.
Ten-four. Let's go.<eos> It's oddly comfortable running in heels.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just so you know, I'm keeping these shoes.<eos> Calm down, Jeff.<eos> We strike from the east entrance.<eos> Take St. Germain alive.<eos> Figured it was only a matter of time before that rat Falcone sold me out.<eos> You waving that gun around for show or are you going to use it?
But I-I can't see.<eos> I could've handled this myself.<eos> I couldn't leave you out here in the swamp.<eos> Because I care. Okay, that's Casey.<eos> You've got to go.<eos> Are you crazy? I'm not going to leave you here alone.<eos> No.<eos> I'll be fine in a minute.<eos> Please, just take my gun in case something goes wrong, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna need it, I have the AEGIS.
Then I promise I never will.<eos> But what if I want to test it, see if I can hold out?<eos> You wouldn't be able to.<eos> Now you've just given me something to think about on my drive home.<eos> Thank you for having coffee with me, Ms. Fiona Gallagher.<eos> You're welcome, Craig Heisner.<eos> My wife says it's bad luck to put your purse on the floor.<eos> What?<eos> Like throwing money out the window.<eos> You should pick it up.
Tits like Katy Perry, and her head hasn't been right since she started huffing butane.<eos> Don't jump to conclusions.<eos> He makes most of his tips with flirts at the bar.<eos> Or Val Krinsky.<eos> Bitch spelled "Chicago" with an "S" on her McDonald's application.<eos> New dress?<eos> For the night.<eos> Oh. Tag gun?<eos> Broke.<eos> Carl used it on a possum.
Before you put her in the coma, was she talking again'?<eos> Yes, she was, and that's a good sign.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Did she mention the name "Andy"?<eos> No, she only said that I had very pretty eyelashes.<eos> She's right.<eos> Your eyelashes are quite lush.<eos> - What about the bullet?<eos> - it's in there.<eos> We're gonna leave it in for now.
You have a castle?<eos> is your crown up there?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> -You should get your crown.<eos> -l have to be rescued in it.<eos> -Can you come save me?<eos> -What?<eos> Yeah!<eos> You know what?<eos> You know, I actually found it, so...
-l'll be right back.<eos> -They're totally gonna get...<eos> Wait!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> alex?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Odd Robbie strikes again!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> He was just standing down in the kitchen right at the open door, just staring at it.
How do you know?<eos> Know what?<eos> When you say that the tumor eroded into the pulmonary artery, how do you know?<eos> There was a hole in the artery.<eos> - Did you actually see the artery?<eos> - I felt it.<eos> You just blindly felt it?<eos> It wasn't a blind feel.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I traced it with my fingers.
It must be getting to you.<eos> No more than it did yesterday or the day before that or the day before that.<eos> It's fine. I'm...<eos> I can handle it.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Spinal dermoid cyst.<eos> It's all tangled up in the spinal root.<eos> Yeah, there's a lot of scarring in there.<eos> I don't see a clean approach.<eos> Well, no, well, you have to take it out because the cyst could become malignant.
- Is that from today? - Mm-hmm.<eos> She looks bigger.<eos> Hey, are you getting bigger? Okay, she's gonna take her first steps any minute.<eos> - I can feel it. - She is getting bigger.<eos> - She looks bigger. - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Oh! - Derek, Derek.<eos> - She's walking.<eos> - Where's the... oh, where's the camera? - Come to daddy.<eos> - Come to daddy.<eos> Hi, baby. - I can't open it.

- Oh! - Derek, Derek.<eos> - She's walking.<eos> - Where's the... oh, where's the camera? - Come to daddy.<eos> - Come to daddy.<eos> Hi, baby. - I can't open it.<eos> I can't open it.<eos> - Hi, baby Zola.<eos> Hi, baby. I can't... I can't...<eos> - Right now! Right now!<eos> - I can't get it on! I can't get it on!
Uh-huh. - Make sure you try...<eos> REESE: Good afternoon, Mr. Finch.<eos> How's it going with Lily?<eos> This may be the best catered stakeout in history.<eos> Don't eat in the field, Finch.<eos> Never know when you'll have to move fast.<eos> FINCH: Any progress on the landlord's e-mail?<eos> Still working on that one.<eos> What about the camera I found?<eos> If we can trace it to Trask we can get him fired. Maybe arrested.
- No!<eos> I'm not gonna say goodbye to you again.<eos> Never.<eos> How you been, Ashley?<eos> Fine.<eos> It's been a while.<eos> Doesn't feel that way to me.<eos> I called you in to talk about Alison's murder investigation.<eos> Copies of a particular page of her autopsy report have been stolen.<eos> We've been looking into it.
The investigation's over.<eos> They've filed the report.<eos> He just wanted you to know that he was returning your necklace.<eos> My what? The necklace O'Laughlin gave you.<eos> It was in evidence, but they're done with it.<eos> He sent it over.<eos> I don't...<eos> Look, I don't want it.<eos> You take it.<eos> If you don't want it, you can sell it, or you could take it down to the evidence room, and they can auction it off.
I was just trying to kill a little time.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's on the right.<eos> How you do that?<eos> The hype.<eos> You pick up two cards between your fingers like so, but when you throw down, it appears that you throw the bottom card, when in fact, you throw the top card.<eos> Like that.<eos> See how that looked like it was the bottom card?<eos> Nice.<eos> You hold it like that, you just drop it down there like that.
Marquette's still in the hospital.<eos> You talk first, the DA will take first-degree murder off the table.<eos> No death penalty.<eos> You want that?<eos> Marquette and I are a team.<eos> Part of the job is getting closer to the target.<eos> That's what I do.<eos> Nett had planted the gun.<eos> Nett grabbed the gun when he came out.<eos> He took it to the fence.
Shhhh!<eos> Where should I take it?<eos> Keep going.<eos> Kill it.<eos> Cook it.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> The crackers and the donkey are yours.<eos> You can't eat the camera.<eos> Give it to me.
Right.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Just got off the phone with Kono.<eos> She get the key that Painter was talking about?<eos> She's on her way to Fong's to drop it off, but she sent a shot of it.<eos> Serial number on the key traces back to a private mailbox at Mailbox Dispatch near Diamond Head.<eos> Services high-end beach houses in Kahala.<eos> Okay. - We have an address?<eos> - Uh, let me look it up.
He was calling to warn Danny, and that's what got him killed.<eos> And then Peterson threw Sal Painter into the wind to send us on a wild goose chase.<eos> It bought him enough time to put his plan in motion.<eos> HPD just found Danny's phone and gun along the Ala Wai Canal.<eos> Which means Peterson has already made contact with Danny and he's controlling him now.<eos> All right, Lori, listen to me.<eos> I need you to hook into the Camaro's police GPS and get me a location.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Kono, get a description of Peterson over to HPD and have them add it to the MAILE AMBER Alert.
So who am I supposed to talk to about getting half a dozen temp nurses in here to help out?<eos> We're not there yet.<eos> Look around. We've been there for an hour.<eos> Mike Cruz.<eos> We got to shut down the roof.<eos> There's a reason this place never had a helipad.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> I mean, besides your hand.<eos> This isn't that bad, but we're getting surges up there left and right.<eos> Nail gun goes off, no one's holding it.
As you know, ciphers are numeric-based, but the Arabic is unusual.<eos> Fortunately, it's one of my specialties.<eos> Hey, the wagon finally arrived.<eos> Looks like we're out of here in the morning.<eos> transfer unit has arrived.<eos> Copy?<eos> Control unit to Manning, transfer unit has arrived.<eos> Copy? Manning is still working on the crusher.<eos> I'll let him know when he comes out.<eos> Let's get Terrence on it.
Yeah, I did.<eos> But now, this is all the motivation we need, pally.<eos> Make that fucking phone call.<eos> Yep.<eos> FRANK: What do you think of this joint?<eos> (IN ENGLISH) Looks nice.<eos> Good enough to own?<eos> Of course it's good enough to own. (CHUCKLES)<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I bought it.
Yep.<eos> FRANK: What do you think of this joint?<eos> (IN ENGLISH) Looks nice.<eos> Good enough to own?<eos> Of course it's good enough to own. (CHUCKLES)<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, I bought it.<eos> I need a partner. I'm thinking about you.<eos> Me?<eos> You bought it?
I see no reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand the time of the day.<eos> Hang yourself, you muddy conger...<eos> My liege, the noble Mortimer, leading the men of Herefordshire to fight against the irregular and wild Glendower was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken.<eos> A thousand of his people butchered.<eos> Upon his dead corpse there was such misuse, such beastly shameless transformation, by those Welshwomen done as may not be without much shame retold or spoken of...<eos> It seems then that the tidings of this broil break off our business for the Holy Land.<eos> This, matched with other does, my gracious lord,<eos> For more uneven and unwelcome news comes from the north and thus it does import.<eos> The gallant Hotspur there, young Harry Percy and the brave Douglas, that ever-valiant and approved Scot, at Holmedon met - where they did spend a sad and bloody hour.<eos> Despite discharge of their artillery, and shape of likelihood, the news is told, for he that brought it, in the very heat and pride of their contention did take horse, uncertain of the issue any way.
And when I urged the ransom once again Of my wife's brother, then his cheek looked pale, And on my face he turned an eye of death,<eos> Trembling even at the name of Mortimer. I cannot blame him.<eos> Was not he proclaimed By Richard that dead is, the next of blood?<eos> He was.<eos> I heard the proclamation.<eos> Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king, That wished him on the barren mountains starve.<eos> But shall it be that you that set the crown Upon the head of this forgetful man Shall be fooled, discarded and shook off?<eos> Say no more.<eos> Now I will unclasp a secret book, And to your quick-conceiving discontents I'll read you matter deep and dangerous.<eos> Send danger from the east unto the west, So honour cross it from the north to south, And let them grapple!
Out of all reasonable compass, Sir John.<eos> Do thou amend thy face and I'll amend my life.<eos> Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.<eos> I never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire.<eos> A good sherry sack hath a two-fold operation in it.<eos> It ascends me into the brain, dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy vapours which environ it, makes it apprehensive, quick, full of nimble fiery and delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the voice - the tongue - becomes excellent wit.<eos> The second property of your excellent sherry is the warming of the blood, which, before cold and settled, left the liver white and pale which is the badge of pusillanimity and cowardice. But the sherry warms it and makes it course from the inwards to the parts extreme.<eos> It illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives warning to all the rest of this little kingdom, man, to arm and then the vital commoners and inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain the heart<eos> who, great and puffed up with this retinue, doth any deed of courage.<eos> And this valour comes of sherry. So that skill in the weapon is nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work.
The southern wind doth play the trumpet to his purposes, foretells a tempest and a blustering day.<eos> Then with the losers let it sympathise, for nothing can seem foul to those that win.<eos> How now, my Lord of Worcester.<eos> 'Tis not well that you and I should meet upon the terms that now we meet.<eos> You have deceived our trust, and made us doff our easy robes of peace to crush our old limbs in ungentle steel.<eos> This is not well, my lord.<eos> My liege, I do protest - I have not sought the day of this dislike.<eos> You have not sought it?<eos> How comes it, then?<eos> Rebellion lay in his way and he found it.
Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.<eos> Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to lying.<eos> I grant you I was down and out of breath and so was he, but we rose both at an instant and fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock.<eos> If I may be believed, so. If not, let them that should reward valour bear the sin upon their own heads.<eos> I'll take it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the thigh.<eos> If the man were alive and would deny it, 'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.<eos> This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.<eos> This is the strangest fellow, brother John.<eos> Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back.<eos> For my part, if a lie may do thee grace, I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
Warwick!<eos> Gloucester!<eos> Clarence!<eos> Clarence!<eos> What would your majesty? Why did you leave me here alone?<eos> We left the prince, my brother here, my liege.<eos> The Prince of Wales?<eos> He's not here. He undertook to sit and watch by you.<eos> Where is the crown?<eos> Who took it from my pillow?
Be happy, he will trouble you no more.<eos> England shall give him office, honour, might,<eos> For the fifth Harry from curbed licence pluck The muzzle of restraint and the wild dog Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.<eos> O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows<eos> When that my care could not withhold thy riots, What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?<eos> O, thou wilt become a wilderness again, Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants.<eos> O, pardon me, my liege.<eos> Wherefore did you take away the crown?<eos> God witness with me when I found no course of breath within your majesty how cold it struck my heart.<eos> I spake unto this crown as having sense And thus upbraided it:
It was aerosolized Heparin.<eos> You skipped over the actual DDX, and now you're averting your eyes.<eos> I'm growing more and more curious by the moment.<eos> He smacked his head against the wall.<eos> If that caused swelling in his brainstem, that would have led to eventual loss of consciousness and paralysis.<eos> - Nobody move. - Aagh!<eos> He--he had on a what?<eos> Gas mask.<eos> The stink bomb was Chase's.<eos> He was getting revenge for the orange hair and rigged it in House's office.

The problem was the patient's brain.<eos> He freaked out.<eos> I got to--I got to get out.<eos> I got to get out of here.<eos> "Freak out" is a little strong.<eos> In my opinion at the time, it was the rash that was gonna kill him.<eos> Invasive strep.<eos> Reasonable theory, supported by the evidence.<eos> The evidence pointed to psychosis.<eos> We caused it by giving him steroids when he first came in.
If Park is right, he goes all Cuckoo's Nest on us, we can cross "brain" off the list, diagnose him, and he can walk out of here cured.<eos> Are you trying to make this easy for me?<eos> By your own admission, if you give the patient steroids, two of the three outcomes are gonna make him worse.<eos> What was making the patient worse was not having a diagnosis.<eos> This was the fastest way to get it.<eos> It was a perfect diagnostic moment.<eos> In light of what happened, you still think it was the perfect diagnostic moment?<eos> Yes.<eos> My theory accounted for all the medical outcomes.<eos> It did not account for the disobedience of my own team.
Which would mean...<eos> Syphilis.<eos> Explains the shoulder and foot involvement.<eos> Hope you practiced the immaculate contraception.<eos> Lock and load.<eos> Boo-yah!<eos> Boo-yah to you too.<eos> But I hadn't had sex in years.<eos> Tertiary syphilis means you've had the disease for at least that long.<eos> Does that mean you also have it?
Let's get back to Phil and Diane.<eos> Phil's been having a hard time finding work, and Diane wants him to talk to her about his fear, his disappointment.<eos> And Phil wants Diane to trust him, that they'll get through this, ideally without having to keep discussing feelings.<eos> Not your exact words, but am I wrong?<eos> And most guys out there are the same way. But, ladies, if you're feeling frustrated, remember, it's not our fault.<eos> We were raised to be strong, not emotional, to deny vulnerability, not embrace it.
Why couldn't they take care of him at a military hospital?<eos> I think because they wanted to annoy you.<eos> Any other conscientious objectors?<eos> So I'm the only one who has a problem when someone whose duty's to protect our country blowing--<eos> Blowing the whistle is honorable precisely because it's not dutiful.<eos> Sorry, you said blowing.<eos> Maybe you were going somewhere else with that.<eos> He's a coward.<eos> He risked his freedom.<eos> He anonymously downloaded a computer file from a secure page and uploaded it to an unsecure page.
His brother was dying the last time we asked him to be the conservator.<eos> So instead of pushing the issue with the Army to get the file, he just decided to give up on his code?<eos> Apparently.<eos> So where do I sign?<eos> We don't need you to.<eos> The Army gave the file to you yesterday.<eos> Major Mathewson had another copy sent over to us.<eos> You know, there's a reason I didn't want that file released.<eos> I know.<eos> I read it.
I have to take her shopping, to her friends, to Atlantic City.<eos> I love her, but every night, every weekend...<eos> And only if there was some solution, someplace where you could live... that's not there.<eos> My mom would freak.<eos> It would be the ultimate sign of disrespect.<eos> Okay.<eos> And maybe you consider not bitching about it?<eos> Not everyone's lucky enough to have your independence.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> When you lose your family, you'll have it too.
He's bitter, not mentally handicapped.<eos> Who knows what Beth told him about you?<eos> At worst, you're a rapist.<eos> At best, you're a rapist.<eos> Maybe she said I was a dead war hero.<eos> Raised by a lunatic mother and abandoned by his father.<eos> Oh, I know!<eos> Squirrel handcuffs.<eos> You think he's gotten any of those?<eos> If you really wanted me to do nothing with this information, then why did you give it to me?
Question every call, play through every whistle.<eos> I just had a light bulb.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You can trust light bulbs.<eos> Stop.<eos> It's not Prions.<eos> Epstein-Barr gave him mono.<eos> It also gave him Miller Fisher syndrome.<eos> The plasmapheresis played through the whistle.<eos> We gave it to him for MPA, but when he got worse, we took him off.
Bought my second engagement ring from this guy.<eos> Hey, looks like they came in through the front door just after he closed for the night.<eos> Find a body?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Samuel Bertram.<eos> - Ah, I was afraid of that. - He's in the vault.<eos> Probably thought he was safe...<eos> In the safe.<eos> Surveillance tape?<eos> Thieves found the camera, ripped it out of the wall.

Sometimes I think I might.<eos> Sometimes I think I'm over it.<eos> All I know, I'm just trying to move on.<eos> Oh, this is the best day ever.<eos> I didn't think about anything.<eos> I just totally in the moment. I just went where the day took me.<eos> - I wish every day could be like this.<eos> - George. We're not even 30 years old.<eos> We have the whole world right in front of us.<eos> Why we just be running hell-bent towards it? We shouldn't be sitting here, waiting and planning. That's not life.
Says me, Lavon Hayes.<eos> Boy, the mayor really loves the third person.<eos> So to George Tucker.<eos> Lavon.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> That was<eos> - Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> - That speech was so amazing<eos> I would love it for my files or to frame it, to best remember the mayor's words.
Should we rest?<eos> No, I have to keep going.<eos> There's no telling what Lavon told George already.<eos> Well, why would he be saying anything?<eos> I mean, why would he kiss you out of nowhere, if it was over like you said. It makes no sense.<eos> I don't know. He just did.<eos> The door was closed.<eos> Yeah, how did it open again?<eos> I don't know; it just did.<eos> Did the wind blow it or...?

No way that you can see, but you will,before this day is done.<eos> And my favorite part is,there's nothing you can do to stop it.<eos> Not long ago,I received reliable Intel on a major threat against Division, most likely an attack on this facility.<eos> I have reason to believe it will occur within the next 24 hours.<eos> I am putting Division on high alert.<eos> As of now,nobody will be allowed in or out without my approval.<eos> I want to remind you that this bunker was built to withstand a Soviet nuclear strike.<eos> We can handle anything that is thrown at us.<eos> That does not mean,however,that we will sit back and play defense.<eos> The sooner we identify the threat,the sooner we eliminate it.
Great,so he's Norman bates.<eos> Let's add him to the team.<eos> Birkhoff,he's wrong.<eos> He doesn't deserve to die.<eos> You want to know about my time in Division?<eos> Here it is.<eos> Sean came to me asking for the truth about Ryan Fletcher.<eos> This guy has his doubts.<eos> He's never heard our side of the story.<eos> Maybe we should give it to him.
I don't know their last names, but<eos> Joey was definitely the one who was in charge.<eos> In charge of what, Mike?<eos> You could just tell, you know?<eos> Come on.<eos> You shoot Billy...<eos> with this gun?<eos> Yeah, but it was in self-defense.<eos> Where'd you get the gun?<eos> Connie kept it behind the counter.

Actually, we do.<eos> Bring him in.<eos> Michael, this isn't a game.<eos> Not another word.<eos> Think about what you're doing.<eos> What am I doing, Connie?<eos> You're trying to bury me.<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> That box with the guns in it was in the diner one morning, nailed shut.<eos> Connie told me to stick it in storage, so I did.
You're trying to bury me.<eos> I'm telling the truth.<eos> That box with the guns in it was in the diner one morning, nailed shut.<eos> Connie told me to stick it in storage, so I did.<eos> Which proves nothing.<eos> It's just your word against his.<eos> It's not just mine.<eos> Remember, Connie?<eos> That box weighed a ton.<eos> Ralph, your chicken guy, had to help me put it in the car.
Um, it's... it's terrific.<eos> Thanks. I figured I'd put things off long enough.<eos> It's time to start getting my act together.<eos> - You must be psyched, man.<eos> - You have no idea.<eos> You're going Ivy League, man... had no idea!<eos> You said you had something to tell me?<eos> Oh, yeah, um...<eos> I've been getting your mail.<eos> I wanted to know where to send it, and now I know.
Like you told me to do.<eos> No, Carla, that's not what I meant.<eos> Okay, I'm 16. How I make a name for myself is really not your problem.<eos> I should have stopped this when you spiked the punch.<eos> I'm pulling the plug.<eos> Great, I'm gonna be a laughingstock.<eos> Okay, you know what, you do this, I swear to God,<eos> I will make sure that my father ruins your career.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I'm doing a pretty good job ruining it myself.
Nobody else seems to cares about making a difference.<eos> And you know who's the worst offender of all?<eos> That Hillingsbrook guy.<eos> I mean, what kind of person doesn't show up to their own charity event?<eos> I heard that guy's a real tool.<eos> I wouldn't even call him a tool.<eos> Maybe ass-wipe or douche bag.<eos> Actually, "tool" is a perfectly good word.<eos> Well, you can't control the way people see you.<eos> If you want to change the world, go out and change it.
Is there another agency following you I'm not aware of?<eos> You've got an entire N.Y.P.D. Task force looking for you.<eos> I had to run two lights just to make sure my own people weren't trailing me.<eos> I'm a cop. Which means I got rules.<eos> Rules that can't be broken.<eos> But, um I wanna know more.<eos> Once you go down that road, there's no looking back.<eos> How are you getting your information?<eos> All I can tell you is we hear about people in danger.<eos> Or people who are causing it.
I did not think to be embraced as brother.<eos> Nor I or to lay eyes upon you again in this life.<eos> Yet here you stand.<eos> Would that all things were so easily done.<eos> I have seen the bond between you.<eos> Whatever the cause for disagreement, it will pass.<eos> I would do anything, to rise in his eyes again.<eos> Capturing the praetor's bitch is a fine start.<eos> An impressive act, sure to further ignite our cause.<eos> I seek only to end it.
Everyone has been set to purpose.<eos> Ours is to provide meat.<eos> You spoke of a debt to Oenomaus.<eos> Was saving his life not repayment enough?<eos> That is for him to decide.<eos> You are a free man.<eos> Your decisions your own.<eos> As it was when you stood in the arena. To strike down your brothers.<eos> What moved your hand?<eos> Honor, as you have it?
Ritual will do much to ease the people's fears.<eos> Better assuaged by the capture of Spartacus.<eos> My men sweep the countryside, taking action in favor of prayer.<eos> As they have for many months, to no result.<eos> Yours have fared no better.<eos> True.<eos> The only one who benefits from our divide is the man who causes us injury.<eos> And most keenly felt.<eos> Your father's guidance and even hand is deeply missed.<eos> His absence from this world has set it upon end.
Well the day has been long and hot.<eos> I would have shade, and wine... to cool overheating concerns.<eos> Let us see you into the light, my friend.<eos> And set hands to purpose...<eos> You must keep your left arm steady, pull through to the cheek, take breath, and release.<eos> Make attempt.<eos> Pull through to cheek...<eos> Deep breath... And release.<eos> Do not jerk from the string.<eos> But let it gently slip from your fingers.
I... I cannot.<eos> Apologies --<eos> Our honored guest asks too much of inexperienced hands.<eos> Your wife does not shy from taking life.<eos> That is how you sate desire, for love or vengeance.<eos> Without hesitation.<eos> It is a sight, is it not?<eos> All of Capua laid at your feet.<eos> It is not the view, but quiet respite from celebration that draws me.<eos> And I have shattered it with prattling tongue.
Give me a sword.<eos> I will join you.<eos> I would have you rest yet a while longer.<eos> This time you stay.<eos> And I go.<eos> We must move.<eos> The boy cheats death.<eos> Perhaps it is a sign.<eos> We can not rely on omen.<eos> We must take strength in just cause, and bring it to bear.
It is a blessing.<eos> To be forever removed from this fucking house.<eos> May it crumble in our wake.<eos> See them delivered to the arena, prepared for execution.<eos> Praetor.<eos> Praetor!<eos> Apologies, I would have word.<eos> You draw breath only because Lucretia cautions the gods yet foretell of your worth.<eos> Press me, and see prophecy ignored.<eos> I but wish to fulfill it, this very day.
The way he looks at her...<eos> I would see myself over cliff, if this is all fate now holds.<eos> My heart would follow to the rocks below.<eos> I cannot live like this.<eos> Nor I.<eos> The last of our meat.<eos> I forgot how much my kin devour upon a sitting.<eos> Much seems to have slipped mind of late.<eos> You sent me to scout Neapolis and report on opportunity.<eos> Their ship provided it.
Remove him from the world, and the scales of blood will be balanced.<eos> Spartacus will drift from Rome.<eos> No more lives will be lost. On either side.<eos> Glaber's own wife, this very night leaves for Rome.<eos> Taking with her half his personal guard to see her safely from the city.<eos> I could distract any that remain posted to the villa entry, giving opportunity for a single man to take Glabe's life while he sleeps.<eos> And Spartacus to receive the blame.<eos> You have lost mind.<eos> The whole world has slipped from reason.<eos> I seek only to restore it.
Be mistaken as enemy.<eos> Glaber summons you.<eos> We only just finished dining on the most succulent lamb.<eos> There may yet be few scraps left.<eos> You overstep,... slave.<eos> I but place foot where our praetor commands.<eos> If you do not care for where it falls, you are free to take issue.<eos> _<eos> I do not know your tongue.<eos> Nor have cause to learn it.
And what of Spartacus's life?<eos> The cost of the bargain.<eos> I for one do not wish to die this day.<eos> Yet if it is to be fucking so, I shall do it as a free man!<eos> Fuck the Romans!<eos> No surrender!<eos> Syrian cunt!<eos> You have your answer.<eos> Very well...<eos> I shall deliver it to waiting ears.
Take to the trees, sisters.<eos> We shall attack the droids from above and below.<eos> (YELLS)<eos> Sir, there is heavy fighting along the eastern front.<eos> Reports indicate Ventress is leading the attack.<eos> Send in the Defoliator tank.<eos> We'll burn those witches to the ground.<eos> Go to my chamber.<eos> There you will find a small metallic sphere.<eos> Bring it to the hidden cave.
Tell him that the Commissar is very grateful. He'll understand.<eos> That's for your work<eos> There's no need to.<eos> I just did my job.<eos> Do you have a girlfriend, Ali?<eos> It seems you have.<eos> You'll buy her something.<eos> Let us contribute to love, will you?<eos> Love's not to be found easy these days.<eos> Cherish it.
- You're a girl.<eos> You have secret powers over them.<eos> Just blow them a kiss.<eos> And then blow them away.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Imagine a guy...<eos> Imagine a guy comes to your house.<eos> He works for every video game company in the world.<eos> He says you can have every console for the rest of your life, free.<eos> And you'd get it six months before everyone else.
How?<eos> I'll get you the best fucking lawyer in the city.<eos> Even if I'm lucky enough to get off due to temporary insanity, they'll still put me in some psych ward.<eos> I'll lose my job, my career... and probably even Harrison.<eos> So what, then?<eos> Travis is dead.<eos> - Nothing's gonna change that.<eos> Maybe we should just get rid of the body.<eos> - What?<eos> - I could put it in my car and take it somewhere and dump it where no one would ever find it.
I can fix it.<eos> Relax.<eos> I'm a cop.<eos> Where's your lug wrench at?<eos> No-no!<eos> How were you so perfectly prepared to kill Travis?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The plastic wrap?<eos> You just... happened to have that with you?<eos> I found it in the storeroom.
I told you.<eos> Okay, look, he bought you this.<eos> Jewelry?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Sheldon, you are the most shallow, self-centered person I have ever met.<eos> Do you really think another transparently manipul...<eos> Oh, it's a tiara!<eos> A tiara!<eos> I have a tiara!<eos> Put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me, put it on me.
How the fuck do you think you can protect her from an ancient, pissed-off vampire when all werewolves do is piss off vampires even more?<eos> We done with all this supernatural bullshit.<eos> You heard me?<eos> No vampires, no witches, no ghosts, no maenads, and no motherfucking werewolves.<eos> Don't fucking growl at me.<eos> I'll make whatever fucking noise I want.<eos> Why don't you just get the fuck up out of our lives?<eos> You should go.<eos> I'm throwing you a lifeline here.<eos> Please take it.
You seem like a real nice girl, Cammy.<eos> And smart, too.<eos> And... and... oh, you got a stomach on you that... whoa, I mean, it might even be flatter than mine.<eos> So, what?<eos> Are you, like, hung up on somebody else or...?<eos> I don't know what I am.<eos> But I do know how things would end up if you and me had sex tonight.<eos> I'd stay till morning, 'cause I like to think I'm a good guy.<eos> And I'd probably even take your number.<eos> But then I'd get in the car and the first thing I would do would be to chuck it out the window.
How about we talk about this militia camp ?<eos> Like why you even think it's there to begin with ? And why you think bin Laden might be there ?<eos> I took this off of a guy that obviously can't read anymore.<eos> - No question that this is Intel on the militia camp.<eos> But who's there is anyone's guess. Even we're guessing.<eos> You guys do that a lot.<eos> But you're trying, which is all anyone can ask.<eos> Look, the road that we're on was not on my map. Okay-<eos> - It's not on any maps.<eos> But it is on this one. So someone went to great lengths to cover it up. And my guess is that anyone that stumbles on this road would get a butt full of hello.
A candy gang? What, like the sour patch kids?<eos> Just step away and pretend you didn't do it.<eos> That's what you do.<eos> We just need to grab ten boxes of Duncan Hines cake mix and we're done.<eos> Why would we need to do that?<eos> Why do you think? To make the cupcakes.<eos> I thought the cupcakes were homemade.<eos> They are, I make them in my home.<eos> You've been using a boxed cake mix?<eos> Relax, I only use it when I'm tired.
No one ever taught me.<eos> No one taught me how to bake.<eos> No one taught me how to use tampons.<eos> No one taught me anything.<eos> You still think I should send my mom a better gift?<eos> And no one taught you how to check out, either.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Max.<eos> You need to get another mix, now don't ya?<eos> I'll go get it, won't take a minute.
[ Boy Narrating ] My brother keeps a human head in his closet.<eos> Every few days it's a new head.<eos> Usually, they are black women.<eos> But one time he had a white man's head in there.<eos> I was going bowling with my friend David one day... And I needed to borrow Steve's ball.<eos> He wasn't home, so I took it without asking permission.
And when you're not there, they make fun of me.<eos> You know what that's like?<eos> Yeah. I know what it's like.<eos> It sucks. I'm tired of taking up for you.<eos> Nobody asked you to. Good.<eos> 'Cause I don't want to be your fuckin' friend anymore.<eos> I'm not like you, Marty.<eos> I'm not a fag.<eos> Then open the fuckin' bag.<eos> You want me to fuckin' open it? Fine.
That's bullshit.<eos> That kid's no good anyway.<eos> What time is it?<eos> It's about 10 minutes till the show starts.<eos> Gotta go to the bathroom.<eos> I'm in here.<eos> I'm in here. Go to another stall.<eos> - [ Steve ] Open the stall, Marty.<eos> - Steve?<eos> Open it or I'll kick it open.
He seems indifferent, or rather, swaying more upon our part.<eos> For I have made an offer to his majesty, upon our spiritual convocation, as touching...<eos> France... to give a greater sum than ever at one time the clergy yet did to his predecessor's part withal.<eos> How did this offer seem received?<eos> With good acceptance of his majesty... save that there was not time enough to hear.<eos> What was th'impediment?<eos> The French ambassador upon that instant craved audience, and the time, I think, is come to give him hearing.<eos> Is it four o'clock? It is.<eos> Then go we in, to hear his embassy.<eos> I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.
The French are bravely in their battles set, and will with all expedience charge on us.<eos> All things are ready, if our minds be so.<eos> Perish the man whose mind is backward now!<eos> Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?<eos> God's will my liege, would you and I alone, without more help, could fight this royal battle!<eos> Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men, which likes me better than to wish us one.<eos> You know your places.<eos> God be with you all!<eos> My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg the leading of the vaward.<eos> Take it, brave York.
Why would you survive?<eos> No one asked you to go.<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> About your friends, yes.<eos> But what about me?<eos> It's easy, you know.<eos> It's easy to die.<eos> The canvas can be raised or lowered.<eos> Jeannot designed it. But I helped him.<eos> It slides sideways too.
Well, then we'll find out when we speak with her next week.<eos> We will.<eos> I just think we need to walk into that meeting as skeptically as possible... all of us.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - I want to make sure your voice is heard...<eos> - if you had a different opinion.<eos> - Well, my husband and I - have equal voices when it comes to this lawsuit.<eos> - Good.<eos> Here's her file.<eos> Read it through and I'll see you monday.
The God Whisperer?<eos> Maybe she heard something, maybe she saw something, maybe she doesn't even know she knows it.<eos> I'm thinking this whole "talking to God" thing is just her way of facing things she's afraid of.<eos> You a shrink now?<eos> Look, she helped us before.<eos> She was right. Maybe her or God can help us again.<eos> I hope he doesn't bring his attorney.<eos> So, this is where God spoke to you, huh?<eos> Right over here? Yeah, I was on a run and I had stopped to rest.<eos> This city's really beautiful, if you take the time to look at it.
I think the kid's got enough talent to develop into a number-one.<eos> I stole someone's identity and re-enrolled as a high-school freshman.<eos> Damon Razor... too good to pass up.<eos> Terry, make the call.<eos> All right, boys! Please line it up!<eos> Let's see it!<eos> Whether it's a new job, new relationship, or a new football season with the new comes possibility excitement...<eos> ...and, of course anxiety.<eos> And that anxiety can sometimes eat you alive.<eos> Unless, of course, you eat it first.
Scamming my dad is my favorite pastime.<eos> So you won't say anything?<eos> Not a word.<eos> So how about you show me your resume?<eos> That's not where I keep it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Riley, it's not what it looks like.<eos> Because it looks like you abandoned me to shove your tongue down some stranger's throat.<eos> Wrong! She was shoving her tongue down my throat.<eos> I was trying to push it out.
Take your best shot and tell her how you feel.<eos> No matter what you can't turn back.<eos> Danny?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Can I use your bathroom?<eos> Your brother is such a jerk.<eos> If you ever see me offering to help him again, you have to promise to stop me.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - Take this.<eos> God, I can't believe Ben would just take our fake relationship and throw it all away.
Is party for, uh, New York "Yunkees" and Coca-Cola.<eos> Oh, my God. A Coca-Cola Yankees party?<eos> That sounds like a real thing.<eos> Okay, now, Marshall, take three steps forward, while ducking underneath the broken ceiling fan.<eos> Now look to your left and spit.<eos> That's the water heater.<eos> Want to stay away from that.<eos> That baby is hotter than the Widow Rodriguez in a unitard.<eos> Okay, now past the washer and dryer is the hardest part.<eos> You're gonna have to belly-crawl underneath the ping-pong table and don't so much as nudge it.
No, no, no, no. Really, I-I can't.<eos> This costs more than my car.<eos> Well, then, I guess I'll let you find something more to your liking.<eos> Oh, no, no, please...<eos> please don't take offense.<eos> Why would I?<eos> I'm gonna be late for my appointment.<eos> You'll find your way back to the Drake?<eos> I got that soy milk you wanted, Lou.<eos> Had to go to two different grocery stores to find it.
This is your new cell phone.<eos> I'm gonna need your old one.<eos> Your fake I.D. and passport are in your bag.<eos> That just leaves...<eos> Jack.<eos> I can't say good-bye to him.<eos> Then I'll do it for you.<eos> You're up late.<eos> How did your father take the news?<eos> He took it like you'd expect.
Yeah, me too.<eos> I'm glad you came back.<eos> There's something I need to talk to you about... before Grace gets back.<eos> Um...<eos> Do you know... about the storm... and these weird powers?<eos> I did hear something about...<eos> I know we've only just met each other.<eos> There's no-one else I can talk to.<eos> Grace... has a power.<eos> And she's been using it to keep me alive.
What are the fucking chances?<eos> When was the last time you even saw a nun?<eos> I'm sorry for hanging up on you.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Let's get on with it.<eos> Oh, right, now, listen.<eos> If I go in there, am I gonna get my penis stolen?<eos> Why would anyone want to steal your puny cock?<eos> He's got a point, actually.<eos> I can't have anyone stealing my fanny. I'm gonna be using it very soon.
How could you do that?<eos> Let me go!<eos> I am trying really hard to make this relationship work.<eos> I'm too angry to talk to you.<eos> Do you need the toilet before I go? .<eos> So the angry, beardy man from the council, he's all like "When are you<eos> "going to pay your rent?"<eos> I was all, "I ain't going to.<eos> What are you going to do about it?"<eos> Well, quite a bit, as it goes, cos they've kicked me out of my flat and they've repossessed it.
I'll share you with God.<eos> He'll probably want you Sundays, won't he?<eos> He does like his Sundays. Right, well, then he can have you Sundays,<eos> How's that sound?<eos> How's that sitting with you, big fella?<eos> I think he's cool with it.<eos> That's settled, then.<eos> Forgive me, I'm going to have to nip to the...<eos> What do... nuns call the toilet?<eos> They call it the toilet.
But you are about to lay low for a while, well out of harm's way.<eos> For me, Bert.<eos> - Please.<eos> - I'll keep an eye on him, miss.<eos> I suppose the cab could do with a wash.<eos> Thank you, Bert. I appreciate it.<eos> Miss.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> Turns out the French authorities DID send a letter to the army.<eos> It sat on a Second Lieutenant's desk for a month, then moved to a Major's desk, then finally to a Brigadier's.
Her work just, well, wasn't up to standard.<eos> But she was a nice enough young lady, though.<eos> Drowned, you said?<eos> Was it an accident?<eos> We're not sure at this stage.<eos> Do you know where Kitty moved on to after she left this address.<eos> Any friends or family you might know of?<eos> I'm not sure if she found herself a new employer but I did write her a good reference at the time.<eos> Yes, she left without taking it with her.<eos> I should have it here somewhere.
I've been trying to telephone you, Mr Weston.<eos> I'm looking for my daughter.<eos> Where's Rose?<eos> She's at school.<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Neither is Jane.<eos> Both girls are missing.<eos> Where could they be?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Rose left me a note but I didn't take it seriously.
Oh, yeah, I'll take it.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I think I drunk-ordered from the Hustler store and that never turns out well.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> "Dear Mr. Greene, when I bought the Ice Truck Killer's hand...<eos> I assumed it would be in mint condition, not with lines over its palm.<eos> Please refund my money immediately."<eos> You had the hand the whole time?<eos> And you sold it online?
That was before we started dating.<eos> You're wearing the shift I gave you for your birthday, asshole.<eos> It was a hooker.<eos> It's not cheating if you pay for it.<eos> Oh, my God, you are a pig.<eos> If I catch anything from you, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How did you get that disc?<eos> It was mailed to me anonymously, probably by your hooker.<eos> - What did you do, cancel her cheque?<eos> - Dexter sent it. Dexter?
And this is for the guest of honor.<eos> How are you doing, little miss Zola?<eos> You look very pretty for your birthday.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> You look very pretty for your...<eos> I need 800 bucks.<eos> Told you, if you're dumb enough to buy groceries, I'm gonna eat 'em.<eos> No, not for groceries.<eos> For a security deposit.<eos> We'll lose out on a really great 3-bedroom if we don't get it to the landlord today.
You know, that's abalone and then the pink part is a sandstone.<eos> That's wonderful, sweetie.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I was thinking of doing something with the... like the mexican muralists did in the '40s.<eos> Yeah, like a Buckner bulldog with a sombrero?<eos> I think cameos are making a comeback.<eos> - It's beautiful.<eos> - Honey, I don't think she heard you.<eos> I hope you wear it when we go to tea at the Ainsley house.
- Do you go to school here? - No.<eos> They let us barrio girls use the track here.<eos> White guilt.<eos> But it's way better than our busted track.<eos> Do you still play midnight madness basketball?<eos> Yeah, but it's a bunch of scrubs.<eos> - You and me could take 'em all. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Hey, Daphne, do you remember if I had my watch with me in cooking class?<eos> Um, I don't know.<eos> Because I could have sworn I had it in my locker and it's not there now.
See you later.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Just stay quiet.<eos> Hey, Monica.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We got in trouble for the fight.<eos> They punished you by making you "give back to the 'hood?"<eos> That's whack.<eos> You wanna go another round, flaca?<eos> I just want my watch back if you haven't pawned it already.
Can't this wait?<eos> Just-- just be quiet for a second.<eos> - I'm turning myself in.<eos> - In to what?<eos> Into the police.<eos> I need you to arrest me.<eos> I killed Debbie Pelt.<eos> Are you listening to yourself?<eos> She came into my house with a shotgun.<eos> I turned it around on her, blew her head clean off.
Looks like we might have the little bastard cornered.<eos> Stay close.<eos> A lot of places to hide.<eos> There.<eos> Little help!<eos> Come on!<eos> Trap it!<eos> [Toby whispers]:<eos> Hey, guys, have you seen the creature?<eos> We lost it at the stairs.
He never fought the Jews.<eos> We're Masada, baby.<eos> We don't mess around with mind games.<eos> We use knives.<eos> You're Jewish?<eos> You're a nice girl.<eos> Hmm. With your sweet little drinks and your giggle, but you're not playing in the little leagues anymore.<eos> Put out your hand.<eos> Why?<eos> Put it out.
Get me out!<eos> Get me out!<eos> Come on!<eos> Hap, let 'em go!<eos> Get the haul!<eos> Come on, come on. - You okay?<eos> - They came out of nowhere.<eos> Now what the hell are we gonna do with it?<eos> Cops are gonna be here soon.<eos> All right, let's leave the blow in the crate and stash it in the woods, get it tomorrow.
Captain?<eos> Get in and out before they can react.<eos> It's gonna be a much smaller team, but...yes.<eos> Hell yes.<eos> General!<eos> What is it?<eos> Sir, with all due respect, the 2nd Mass is going on the mission.<eos> I just gave you an order.<eos> I understand that, sir.<eos> But we're doing it nonetheless, with or without your permission.
Really, Cap?<eos> I thought we were going to see the Grand Canyon.<eos> Hey!<eos> Bro, you got steel-plated cojones showing up here after putting a hole in my arm.<eos> I'm sorry about that, Lyle.<eos> I truly am.<eos> Clemons was gonna kill you.<eos> What happened to your uniform, soldier boy?<eos> Threw it in the incinerator.<eos> Should have known better than to put it on in the first place.
And the seat won't move.<eos> Okay, what about a knife? Do you have a knife? Yeah.<eos> In the trunk.<eos> Okay, look, we're running out of time.<eos> I need you to see if you can find that gun, and we'll just shoot the belt off.<eos> I can't feel it.<eos> - Castle.<eos> - Okay, hang on. Hang on.<eos> Just stay here.<eos> I found it.
- (Both laugh)<eos> - You could greet me at least.<eos> Your husband has obliged me to a treasure hunt.<eos> - Where is Anna?<eos> - She's coming later.<eos> - Meeting with the Japanese.<eos> - Ah.<eos> - Looks good, the new hairstyle.<eos> - Nice of you.<eos> - Pierre can not stand it.
Excuse me, I'm so late.<eos> Oh, don't worry, it doesn't matter.<eos> Oh!<eos> Hach, those are beautiful.<eos> It's cumbersome, getting up here to the 5th, huh?<eos> Oh, you know, I sit all day.<eos> But wait!<eos> Suits you well, the new color.<eos> That's sweet.<eos> Pierre can not stand it.
(Chuckles)<eos> Is that so funny, right?<eos> (Suppressed laughter)<eos> Ok, if you enjoy it.<eos> (Roar of laughter)<eos> "If you enjoy it."<eos> "If you enjoy it."<eos> (More laughter)<eos> Ok if my grimace means you are a pain in the butt to me, agreed, I'll put on a grimace.<eos> Have you seen it?
You'll see, it's a comfy sofa.<eos> Do you sleep there often?<eos> Yes, happens.<eos> No!<eos> What?<eos> Oh, awesome.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you give me now your eternal gratitude?<eos> No.<eos> I borrow it to you.
It's funny.<eos> You seem to be so concerned about the body count now.<eos> Didn't bother you when you were sanctioning all those hits. They were necessary.<eos> Oh, I'm sure it seemed necessary in this room.<eos> But I was the one who had to pull the trigger. You were a soldier.<eos> I was a killer.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't know what it's like.<eos> You had to live in Division, I didn't.<eos> Which is why you're the only one who can take it down without exposing it to the public.
I keep them for later, when they are ripe.<eos> If Otto then your successor?<eos> (In the distant land, "Lohengrin")<eos> Caref I!<eos> As particularly careful Back on the corner .<eos> On the corner watching there!<eos> Thank you!<eos> Hau r ck!<eos> You filled my castle?<eos> I'll name it after you and the Swan Knight.
Okay.<eos> What do we got?<eos> There's a long and deep laceration in the right lobe of the liver.<eos> Put in a retractor so I can see the spleen.<eos> Deaver.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> It's mush.<eos> It's not salvageable.<eos> B.P.'S 60. I'm having trouble maintaining.<eos> Okay, let's leave the spleen for now, pack it away, and we'll suture the liver first.
Siri, play some smooth jazz.<eos> Playing smooth jazz.<eos> Oh, my God, Kenny G?<eos> This woman can read me like a book.<eos> I can't believe I bought my soul mate at Glendale Galleria.<eos> I don't know if I want to stay.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> How did you even get this idea? I called your dad.<eos> I asked him what things you liked to do when you were a kid.<eos> This seemed easier than getting a cow out here so you could tip it.
He was found dead, his head pierced from side to side, at the wheel of his car, with his weapon between his thighs.<eos> The autopsy ruled it a suicide, but the experts found two contradictory elements:<eos> there wasn't enough powder in the palms of the suicide victim, and there was no impact or bullet in the wall across the street.<eos> He died a few meters away from Wieslowski's place. The same day. Odd coincidence.<eos> - And the autopsy report?<eos> - Skeleton service.<eos> Ballistics, the fingerprints on the weapon, nuclear forensics, the body's position...<eos> It's easy to rule it as suicide.<eos> Maybe he was murdered because he saw the abduction.<eos> Wiesner saw it, tried to intervene.
See you.<eos> You okay?<eos> You didn't wait too long?<eos> What are you doing with your gun?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I panicked in this big house, alone and isolated.<eos> This isn't Paris.<eos> There aren't many attacks.<eos> I know, it's stupid.<eos> I'll put it away.
- I'm sorry, it's the only way.<eos> Very well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Have a nice evening.<eos> Okay, bye.<eos> He's asleep.<eos> Take him.<eos> Come to daddy.<eos> - I'll give you his bottle. - Okay.<eos> - Shall I put it there?
You can let go of me.<eos> - Where is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He had a diving suit.<eos> There's another girl.<eos> In the boat.<eos> LEGAT VERONIQUE<eos> MEDICAL SUPERVISOR ROLAND LIEPORT<eos> - There's a trapdoor.<eos> - Can you open it?
I am a sailor.<eos> For real?<eos> A sailor without a ship.<eos> You are very ungallant, Grigori.<eos> Kapitan Warwazzi lost far more when his ship before Cesme.<eos> Is not that so, captain?<eos> Tell her to me.<eos> How dare you, so to speak with Her Majesty?<eos> Grigori, the man deserves his Reply.<eos> You lost your freedom, but I can give it back to you.
Addition.<eos> And?<eos> Do you love him?<eos> No.<eos> I did not times this excuse.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What?<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> One can buy beauty, you can Allegiance buy, even friendship, but love can not buy one.<eos> I thought my love would be strong enough so that you could feel it.
What is it?<eos> Siv...<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I believe you.<eos> You are beautiful.<eos> What's with you tonight?<eos> You're not wearing your blouse.<eos> Is that the reason?<eos> I spilled something on it.<eos> I spilled red wine on it.
Sometimes people do ordinary things in unusual situations.<eos> Well, I'm off.<eos> A week in the hammock, and no newspaper.<eos> What shall I do without you?<eos> - You save yourself.<eos> You can always ask our sailing champion for help, "el Patriko".<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did the Minister of Trade submit a restaurant receipt dated 27 June?<eos> In that case, I'd like it.
Michael, she can't.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Are you saying that I should do it?<eos> I'm saying that if you wanna get your mother out of Russia it's better that Amanda works with you than against you.<eos> Keep your enemies closer, right?<eos> If you get close to Amanda, better know what she's up to.<eos> She wants Zetrov.<eos> And I'm the perfect way for her to do that.<eos> So what happens when you change her plans?<eos> We'll blow that bridge when we come to it.
12 years later<eos> Nguyen Vu.<eos> - Yes, master?<eos> Tell me, how did you acquire that stance?<eos> - I... I don't know.<eos> Could you demonstrate that to me again?<eos> - Yes, master.<eos> I see, you still do not know how to use it properly.<eos> Remember, one must master a technique in order to utilise it.
Excuse me if I don't read every note the school sends home.<eos> I gave her a shot of epinephrine.<eos> It should do the trick.<eos> He's hypothermic.<eos> Yeah.<eos> There's too much bleeding.<eos> He's not gonna make it if we keep going.<eos> Let's pack him and get him up to I.C.U. To stabilize him.<eos> I am not babysitting.<eos> I have made your career, and I can break it.
Okay.<eos> So what do we do now?<eos> Well, let's hope Carrie's a little bit more persuasive than you are.<eos> Dr. Torres, Dr. Webber suggested...<eos> Unh-unh, here's how this is gonna work...<eos> I talk, and you listen.<eos> You are here because you and your little pals are all freaked out about the oral boards, and Dr. Webber suggested that Callie Torres might have a special secret study method, right?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Yeah, Dr. Webber's correct.<eos> Callie Torres does have a study method, an excellent study method, but she's not about to just give it away.
Okay, then I don't understand why you think it's a good idea to continue to dissect right there.<eos> Respectfully, Dr. Bailey, it's not entirely important that you understand everything I do every step of the way.<eos> Uh, no, respectfully, Dr. Sloan, I disagree.<eos> I think it's extremely important.<eos> Now if you had read the file like you said you did, you'd know that she'd have massive scar tissue exactly in the area that you're dissecting, so I think going forward with that dissection is a monumentally stupid course...<eos> Respectfully, Dr. Bailey, uh, the bulk of that scar tissue is gonna be found near her axilla.<eos> So if Dr. Sloan continues dissecting right there, I really don't think there'll be a problem.<eos> And I-I read that in... in-in the file, the file that you...<eos> Carrie's file... that you gave me to read, I...<eos> I did... I did read it.
And then with the kids, too?<eos> Mm. Well... You'll find out soon enough, right?<eos> Oh, besides, you and Derek will be fine.<eos> You two are perfect.<eos> All Ellis is saying is that she wants you to use your full potential.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Oh, hi, honey.<eos> Like that clinical trial you used to talk about.<eos> I'm about to have a child, Richard.<eos> I don't have time for a clinical trial.<eos> I think you should find it.
The baby started crowning and then just stopped.<eos> Okay, move.<eos> Aah! Theresa, you're doing great.<eos> Ohh! Okay, Kepner, order up a 3-D ultrasound, stat, and prep an O.R. For a crash C-section.<eos> - And page my husband. - Right away.<eos> What happened?<eos> He detached the connector to the artificial lung, and I had to clamp off the cannula to stop the bleeding.<eos> I told you this was a bad idea.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's book an O.R. Let's get it hooked back up.
Why wasn't it in his chart?<eos> Because I had chosen to use the jugular.<eos> They were in the medical records.<eos> And you didn't tell me because I'd opted to not cut the man's throat?<eos> Well, that's... It's a good plan... but I ended up cutting his throat anyway.<eos> My procedure's a wash, and the patient's been under far longer than is optimal.<eos> That's why I picked the jugular.<eos> Is that right...<eos> Dr. Bailey?<eos> Is that why you picked it?
The two dead men and near-dead woman have not yet been identified.<eos> The kayaker who happened upon them says he didn't see the woman, or he would never have left her.<eos> So you knew both of the deceased?<eos> Would you like something to drink?<eos> Yes.<eos> Hi.<eos> -I killed a goat.<eos> -Whose is it?<eos> I was up at the farm.<eos> Did he give it to you?
You've got to be kidding.<eos> All right.<eos> There are two ways this can go.<eos> You can go get her, or I'll come in and get her myself.<eos> Try it.<eos> Gayle, it's okay.<eos> Behave yourself.<eos> - I guess you didn't read my note.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> I read it. Both sentences. Each so terse, I figured you must have written it at gunpoint.
Yes, she's columbian.<eos> What does that have to do with--no, I'm coming down there.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Grab your keys. I think I might need a lawyer.<eos> Guess who just got his bell rung?<eos> That's good.<eos> That's good.<eos> Here we go. Have a seat.<eos> I got a bottle of port from 1899. - Whoa. - Wow!<eos> Okay, I got it for $18.99... But it's a good one.
Oh, my God.<eos> Look, Max, he's a figure skater.<eos> Go ahead, take it all in.<eos> How could you not?<eos> It's okay, I'm a model. I'm used to it.<eos> Hey, I know you. You're the Big Bill.<eos> You're the guy from the gag greeting cards.<eos> Yep. I sold 2 million of that particular card.<eos> On the front it says, "You're on,"<eos> when you open it up...
No, it's cool.<eos> You do your thing, I'll do mine.<eos> Hey, get your phone.<eos> We should capture this near-death victory moment as our website picture.<eos> Totally.<eos> On the count of three, think...<eos> "We made $200."<eos> One... two...<eos> Hold up.<eos> Sir, if you want to go home with that hand, get it off my ass.
Of course, but... not everything.<eos> The other guy was behaving very suspiciously.<eos> Three over to one.<eos> Suspect continuing on Route 126 direction Decin.<eos> Has he passed the turn-off to the glassworks?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Over.<eos> Has your brother got a gun?<eos> No.<eos> Well... but he never uses it.

Same thing I'm going to do to you.<eos> We know whose fault that is, don't we?<eos> Your wife's on the phone.<eos> She wants to talk to you...<eos> You recognize these?<eos> - The gamekeeper's antlers.<eos> - Why'd you take aim at these?<eos> - He shot my dog. - It was running loose in the woods.<eos> Why don't you give me the gun?<eos> How'd you get it anyway?
I'm ready.<eos> Real Humans Liberation Front. What do you think about that name?<eos> - Very good.<eos> We will exist and operate until the day we live in a hubot free society.<eos> Just as in any war, the heroes are the regular Joe's with regular jobs.<eos> And when the war was over, they returned to earn an honest living.<eos> Plain and simple, a real human has to do, what a real human has to do.<eos> So true.<eos> I was thinking about publishing some kind of manifesto.<eos> What if we called it "Warnings"?
Out!<eos> You have a time to keep?<eos> Yes...<eos> The dog.<eos> My little Nisse is all alone.<eos> Goodbye. Lover boy.<eos> You have my number.<eos> Call me.<eos> Where's my bag....<eos> I threw it away.
- Hey. - Hey.<eos> Sorry if I went ballistic the other day.<eos> It's cool.<eos> Is Bea here?<eos> Yes.<eos> Great. Great that you two... Really.<eos> Well, I won't bother you...<eos> Just wanted... to return your keys.<eos> I left a few things in the basement. It was left when I made the bomb.<eos> Is it okay, if I... get it?
Be sure of that. - Go!<eos> - He will return, not alone, but in force.<eos> - Dad's worried. He needs his pills.<eos> In this, all of your digital clones are stored.<eos> Including yours.<eos> And in this, lies the only copy of the code.<eos> Your soul.<eos> I want you to take care of it.<eos> - Yes... - Thank you.<eos> But I have deleted the last sequence, and without it, it's useless.

We are living beings, you, me, our children.<eos> - She. Mimi, Anita. She's just a machine.<eos> - She's part of the family.<eos> She's not part of my family.<eos> Then you take your stuff, pack and move out.<eos> Mimi?<eos> Mimi! ?<eos> Stand there.<eos> Don't turn off the phone. Slowly, put it down in front of you.<eos> Take off your jacket and put it on the ground.
Are you an architecture student?<eos> We'll see.<eos> Maybe someday.<eos> Do you ever...<eos> Draw people?<eos> I have.<eos> But, uh, tend to look more like buildings.<eos> Well, I'm impressed.<eos> Well, where is my invitation?<eos> I want to at least see it.
So two guards weren't enough?<eos> They had to send you too?<eos> I've still got a missing body to find. It's my job, not yours.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> I'm just here to pick up the...<eos> Test results of my field hockey physical.<eos> You know what?<eos> You used to be a much better liar.<eos> Nice tie.<eos> I can't wait to take it off.
It became a daily thing.<eos> Every morning, she'd row next to us to the dock and back.<eos> I should get going.<eos> I gotta get to class.<eos> She talked about you all the time.<eos> Said you were her first real love.<eos> Hey, Nate.<eos> Do you have her parents' address?<eos> I'd like to send them a thank-you note.<eos> Don't have it with me.
I just need you to explain the system.<eos> Who would know about Cahill's being undercover?<eos> Only his handler.<eos> What about the people that have access to his paperwork, files?<eos> Files on undercovers are kept only as hard copies, so people like you can't hack into them.<eos> Words wound, Detective.<eos> The files are kept in safes in one room controlled by IAB.<eos> However, only the handlers have the combinations to their UC's safe.<eos> Anyone tries to break in, IAB will send them on a one-way trip to Rikers.<eos> We would need to destroy Cahill's file before anyone could retrieve it.
Whoa, whoa, easy with the volume there.<eos> No wonder Mr. Sunshine's always in a foul mood.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> It takes a little time,<eos> - which you're running out of.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - What's the plan, Kimosabe?<eos> - The plan is simple.<eos> The IAB Detective that patrols the room makes one more inspection before the next shift begins.<eos> That will give you approximately 8 1/2 minutes to spoof the key card, break into the safe, and retrieve Tulley's file before Vargas's informant can get to it.
What guy?<eos> What things?<eos> Careful what you say, Detective.<eos> We can look after you, but these men are looking for our friend.<eos> Look, it doesn't make a difference who the guy is.<eos> All you need to know is that a cop's life was on the line and I was trying to save him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got a problem.<eos> I couldn't get the file.<eos> Some idiot destroyed it.
But if I tell Harvey about this, he is gonna kill Louis.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> They're in the conference room.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> Uh, yeah, no.<eos> Did you get that power of attorney?<eos> Yeah. Let's go set off that bomb. Thanks.<eos> By the way, where did you find that yaw drive anyway?<eos> Pulled it out of the back of a photocopier.
Not a single expert has backed one of their claims.<eos> - Well, one has now.<eos> - Keith Hoyt.<eos> Who better to speak to the harmful effects than the man who designed the wind farm himself?<eos> No, no, if he goes through with this, that company goes out of business.<eos> There's no way he kills his own company.<eos> You're right, he wouldn't.<eos> But I would, and as you pointed out,<eos> Keith's judgment has been impaired lately, so I convinced him to let me make the decisions going forward.<eos> I now have power of attorney, and I'd rather see this company worth nothing than let you have it.
I have a feeling you know.<eos> Yeah. I was hooked for seven years.<eos> My brother finally helped me to get clean.<eos> That's why I went to Seattle.<eos> If they're looking to score, it'll be an island of dreams.<eos> - A Trauminsel?<eos> Here?<eos> - They're everywhere.<eos> Are we talking about some kind of Wesen crack house? Yeah.<eos> Well, how do we find it?
Did he say anything unusual, or mention where he was going after the appointment?<eos> Let me check his file.<eos> It was just yesterday afternoon.<eos> Yesterday?<eos> No, no, no. Uh, Braddock's last drug treatment was two days ago. In the morning.<eos> According to his calendar, he had a treatment yesterday at 4:17 p.m.<eos> Well, not a medical treatment.<eos> Braddock was under my exclusive care.<eos> And not to be indelicate, agent, but when do I get access to the body?<eos> - Access? - I need to examine it.
Sit down.<eos> - Sit. - Excuse me.<eos> Lisbon.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> No. No, we didn't take it.<eos> We'll be right there.<eos> Get everybody out of that room.<eos> It's a crime scene now.<eos> Braddock's body is missing from the morgue.<eos> They think somebody stole it after we left.
We'll be right there.<eos> Get everybody out of that room.<eos> It's a crime scene now.<eos> Braddock's body is missing from the morgue.<eos> They think somebody stole it after we left.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> He was right about one thing.<eos> We just made a terrible mistake.<eos> No sign of the killer or Braddock's body.<eos> Whoever took it won't make the same mistake twice.
Fancy a drop?<eos> - No, thanks.<eos> - STEPHEN: Come on, Alex.<eos> Eddie's going to be wasting his brain for the next hour anyway.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'll keep you company.<eos> - Great.<eos> - And you've looked everywhere? - BINGHAM:<eos> The jacket's not in the house'<eos> Maybe she dumped it outside.
You'll take over his position.<eos> Leng Lingqi, explain why you went after Jia San alone.<eos> I thought the three of us would be enough.<eos> Jia San involved in countless cases and escaped us every time.<eos> And despite the importance of this case, you gambled its success on three men.<eos> Finding Jia San was hard enough as is.<eos> If the Divine Constabulary hadn't ruined Brother Leng's plan, he would have caught Jia San.<eos> Give me your badge.<eos> Lord, this... This is the coin cast that was stolen.<eos> Put it back.
The President, awakened last night to news... Uh, you know the plane that went down, Flight 197?<eos> I'm responsible.<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> That group that claimed responsibility for the bombing,<eos> I was laundering money for them.<eos> Conrad. The investigation's gonna tie back to the company.<eos> I'm gonna go to prison for the rest of my life, if I'm lucky.<eos> They're gonna freeze all of our assets, and you're gonna have to raise Daniel alone under a cloud of disgrace.<eos> Life as we know it, Victoria, is over.<eos> No matter how much we try to escape our past, we seem destined to repeat it.
You've been accosting my agents looking for the flag.<eos> Let's discuss it like gentlemen.<eos> Your network's secrecy has ruined my reputation.<eos> Why should I talk to you?<eos> Because I can remedy that.<eos> Please.<eos> Sit.<eos> The general doesn't like guns.<eos> I hold onto my weapon, or I'm leaving.<eos> Holster it, and you can keep it.
I traced his I.P. address and found this place.<eos> And you've been watching it ever since.<eos> Well, I was beginning to worry that 7-2-3 had disappeared on me until he showed up a couple days ago.<eos> He hadn't disappeared.<eos> He was detained for the murder you committed.<eos> So that's who they got.<eos> He didn't deny it was his murder.<eos> Well, I hope your gratitude includes a gift.<eos> I want the flag.<eos> We don't have it.
Hey, guys, how about we lift the stone?<eos> He is gonna kill us the moment we confirm the flag is here, isn't he?<eos> If you see a moment, use your spy training. I am not a spy.<eos> I don't have training.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> "Culpers don't exist." Copy that.<eos> Still, use your spy training.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, there's a box down there. All right.<eos> How about you go down there and get it?
We're supposed to be in this together.<eos> We are, Moz.<eos> Concierge dropped this off in my room.<eos> You know, a different girl might take offense that you marked this "return to sender."<eos> Well, a different guy might take offense that you got him arrested. I'd say we're even.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Last time you gave me this flower, it represented our search for the music box.<eos> Our search for the u-boat treasure.<eos> Given where I found it today, I'm not really sure what it means any more.
Thanks.<eos> Glad you're here.<eos> I'm happy you decided to watch that with us.<eos> You got to pick who you can trust, right?<eos> Well, whatever it is, if Ellen had wanted the whole world to see it, she would have given it to Channel 5 News.<eos> Instead, she gave it to me.<eos> And, maybe if she was still alive, she would have wanted you to see it. I don't know.<eos> But you don't want to make that decision for her.<eos> No.<eos> I want to make it for me.
Any way to use her strengths against her?<eos> I know how we can take Bryson's extortion photos out of play.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> How would you feel about sleeping with Sara Ellis?<eos> Do you have any idea what this is about? No.<eos> You?<eos> No clue.<eos> Why did I agree to this?<eos> This is a terrible idea.<eos> Hey, if you have a better idea, I would love to hear it.
But it's possible.<eos> Wasn't the theory that Jordan Chase killed the accomplices, then fled the country?<eos> Yes. But even if Chase killed the other four suspects, the Butcher still could have killed Chase.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Jordan Chase was very high-profile.<eos> It would be too risky.<eos> Still... it's worth looking into.<eos> Find what you're looking for?<eos> It says here Price bribed the funeral director to get access to Beverly Grey's body before she was cremated.<eos> He stole a blood sample and ran it for aconite.
Positive for aconite.<eos> Proof that Beverly was poisoned.<eos> But not proof that Hannah did the poisoning.<eos> Hannah said her handyman was there when Beverly was still alive.<eos> That could be worth a conversation.<eos> Jesus, now she's showing up where I live.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You picked the wrong plant.<eos> I knew I could do better.<eos> Hopefully you won't kill it.
You're going to be famous.<eos> A toast to my best friend Philipp, who'll be studying in Düsseldorf next semester!<eos> Michael and I also have something to announce.<eos> You all know about the offspring - that's trivial.<eos> This is about something fundamental.<eos> We're moving in together.<eos> - Can a washing machine fit through there?<eos> - Mine fitted through.<eos> That's not a washing machine, it's a top loader.<eos> I'd leave it here anyway.
- I don't know.<eos> But the amphylicite recovered from those devices is a fraction of Jones' stockpile.<eos> It's your world you ought to be concerned about.<eos> As bad as you think things are now, things are gonna get much worse.<eos> There's been rumblings lately about a group out there obsessed with the guided evolution of man.<eos> They wanna create a new species. You said that Jones was a megalomaniac. That he has a god complex.<eos> Maybe Jones is trying to take control of the situation.<eos> You coming, Walter?<eos> - Don't know that you really needed a tie.<eos> - I thought it was appropriate.
Meaning, Nick Lane and the others are drawing on their alternate's frequency uh, to change the vibratory nature of the area that they're standing in.<eos> Effectively merging the two universes together.<eos> Which is what's causing the earthquakes.<eos> And the eventual collapse of our worlds.<eos> This man, I'm afraid, I underestimated him.<eos> Jones must have a remarkable mind to have devised a plan like this.<eos> Walter.<eos> Could the connection between our two universes be what's facilitating this psychic link?<eos> I suppose.<eos> So, what if we severed it?
I suppose.<eos> So, what if we severed it?<eos> - You're not suggesting...?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> Suggesting what?<eos> That we close the bridge. We turn off the machine.<eos> It cuts the link between our Cortexiphan subjects and their doppelgangers.<eos> Walter, would that work?<eos> Unh, in theory, yes.<eos> But if we were able to shut down the machine we may never be able to start it again.
- Yes, I am.<eos> Suggesting what?<eos> That we close the bridge.

All we know so far, at 3:23 p.m., more than two dozen people experienced some kind of spontaneous human combustion.<eos> You know that's a myth, right?<eos> There are survivors.<eos> Remaining still seems to have halted the ignition process for now.<eos> Do we have any idea what's caused this?<eos> I'm hoping Dr. Bishop can help shed some light on that.<eos> Okay, my friend.<eos> Let's see what secrets you hold.<eos> I had a watch similar to this once.<eos> My uncle gave it to me.
Together.<eos> Is that a personal guarantee?<eos> After all we've been through I will not lose you again, Olivia.<eos> - I'm starving.<eos> - Ha, ha.<eos> What's a guy gotta do to get a good home-cooked meal around here?<eos> Where are you now?<eos> Just passing Kenmore Square.<eos> What do you mean, it's the sun?<eos> Even though we can't see it, it's in the sky.
What you don't have is motive.<eos> We know Gaskin threatened to make her life difficult with the hospital board.<eos> That's hardly enough for her to kill him.<eos> It's true that Gaskin disapproved of Mac's attitude, but so does half the world, the wrong half, if you ask me.<eos> And Mac's used to sailing close to the wind.<eos> She's the one who asked me to investigate Daisy's death.<eos> Why do that if she planned to kill Gaskin?<eos> Assuming it's something she planned.<eos> I doubt that she injected bleach into his veins in a fit of passion.<eos> If you have any other explanation, I'd love to hear it.
Just one gaudy night.<eos> If you really want a Roman soldier... then I'll take it from here.<eos> What is it?<eos> This was left for me.<eos> It was Janey's.<eos> She was wearing ribbons in her hair the day she disappeared.<eos> I have the other one. How?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It must be him.<eos> Who else was there that day who could have found it?
Don't touch!<eos> Ow! Impatience is your middle name.<eos> Virtue was already taken.<eos> Remind you of anything?<eos> Why, it's...<eos> Rubber.<eos> Artificial rubber.<eos> In an expanding world market, the formula for artificial rubber would be worth... Its weight in gold.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So if Saul dropped this formula off, who was meant to pick it up?
You thought you were the only one with a dream, huh?<eos> The only one worthy of success?<eos> With your... your big house and your fine son.<eos> Because you made me leave all my treasures behind... the village, my sweetheart, all my hopes.<eos> Put the gun down, Chaim.<eos> Stay out of this, Miss Fisher.<eos> Get back.<eos> Get out of the way, damn it!<eos> Put the gun down, Chaim.<eos> Give it to me.
Stay here, Collins, and take notes.<eos> Let's move onto the topic of Mr Leonard Stevens.<eos> You recall him - large, boorish, dead.<eos> Let's call a spade a spade.<eos> You wanna know if I killed him.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, sure I did, and I'd do it again.<eos> Low-down dog deserved it.<eos> What did you do with the weapon?<eos> Smuggled it out in my garter.

Where?
Units three and four, head to the stairwells.<eos> Start at the ground floor and make your way up.<eos> Cut all power to the elevators.<eos> Is that what you want, Nikita?<eos> You wanna kill me to save Amanda?<eos> Birkhoff, just put the gun down.<eos> I can handle her.<eos> Carla.<eos> Hate to tell you this, but your friend is cuckoo for a certain cereal.<eos> Just put it down and disable the tablet, please.
How much longer...?<eos> Corporal, sir...<eos> Corporal, sir...<eos> Will you trade in, sir?<eos> It hurts so fucking bad, I just can't stand it anymore.<eos> - Where'd you get that?<eos> - You know where from.<eos> They'll bury you alive.<eos> Nobody's seen sausage here for over a month.<eos> Now you can have it, just for one pill.
Hey, give me your bromide, will ya?<eos> - It's fucking killing me.<eos> - I don't take them.<eos> - Don't be a prick, give me one.<eos> - Maybe the corporal has one.<eos> If I went with the pigs instead of him... would I get more?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Write a letter of request to the first lieutenant.<eos> Hey Louis, you praying to that rat?<eos> Let's roast it for dinner.
Yeah?<eos> Well, which one of you's willing to be his second?<eos> Put your fucking meat where your bark is.<eos> I will.<eos> Well, I guess I shoulda seen this coming.<eos> 'Cause you way too pretty to not be stupid.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What's your excuse?<eos> You want punishment, Herveaux?<eos> Well, I'll be happy to give it to you.
Excellent.<eos> And slap an iStake on him.<eos> I don't want to get dirty.<eos> Guardian, I request permission to visit Chancellor Gainesborough in her cell.<eos> Why?<eos> She...<eos> she's my sister.<eos> Oh my.<eos> You will be at the execution?<eos> Oh, I wouldn't miss it.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> ♪<eos> Come on, Jackie.<eos> Come on!<eos> Hang in there, Cruz.<eos> Yeah, I got him, Danny.<eos> Take care of him, Jack.<eos> Go! Go!<eos> All right, the perp, David Fernandez, he left his cap in the back of the car.<eos> You got it.
All right, he's got the scent.<eos> All right, let's go!<eos> He went out the back.<eos> Out the back.<eos> Out the back!<eos> Hey, what's wrong with the dog?<eos> He lost the trail. What's wrong with him?<eos> !<eos> He lost the trail.<eos> What do you mean, he lost...? He lost it.
Dr. Isles.<eos> Oh, hello, Dr. Martin.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> Um... oh.<eos> Oh, yes, I-I would love to have dinner with you.<eos> Tonight would be great.<eos> Uh, would you like to come over to my house?<eos> Sure, you... you can bring your daughter.<eos> Okay, I... I will text you my address.<eos> I-I look forward to it.
I think we're having different conversations.<eos> Cailin needs a kidney.<eos> So, you going to make it out of that cake?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I needed a sample of her DNA.<eos> Y-you can't give her a kidney.<eos> It's my kidney. I can give it to whomever I please.<eos> Oh, so, you told Hope?<eos> I'm going to donate anonymously.<eos> You need any help getting it out, or are you gonna do that by yourself, too?
I'm all cried out.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm done.<eos> I'm done. And, actually, I'm a little insulted. - What'd I do?<eos> - That girl rejected my kidney.<eos> The nerve. I know.<eos> Right?<eos> It's a very nice kidney.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> You should keep it... in your body.
- Maura:<eos> Oh, god.<eos> - Frankie:<eos> What's she doing?<eos> She has to try to make him stay in the fantasy.<eos> What if he comes out of it?<eos> We have to find her.<eos> He's live-streaming, but he's smart.<eos> He's hiding the I.P. address.<eos> I can't find it.

I... well...<eos> Uh, then why are we still here?<eos> That, my friend, is an excellent question.<eos> And what was that smoke?<eos> Who did this?<eos> - And what was that smoke?<eos> - And why?<eos> And what was that smoke?<eos> It's here.<eos> I can feel it.
Gael Manfretti.<eos> Nothing but bread crumbs.<eos> Baldies feed you well, Gael.<eos> of his patrol.<eos> Why would he have come here?<eos> The place is abandoned.<eos> For all we know, we tripped some silent alarm.<eos> Someone's gonna notice him missing sooner or later.<eos> We need to stay.<eos> If that camera is the key to helping Walter remember, we have to get it.
Just a second attempt to kill you.<eos> I need to know what about Tritak has people repeatedly trying to do that.<eos> I- - It started with my uncle.<eos> The firm invested him in a company.<eos> He asked me some questions, so I took a peek.<eos> Illegally?<eos> Yeah, but he was family.<eos> I didn't think anything of it.<eos> And then I saw some numbers that I didn't agree with, so I wrote an email.<eos> I was going to send it to risk management, legal, the partners, everybody, but then-- then the SEC started sneaking around, so I was told to keep my mouth shut.
Ms. Brazile, - it's a pleasure.<eos> - Call me Donna.<eos> Donna, I respect you mightily.<eos> Oh, come on, you do not.<eos> I'm just a pain in the ass.<eos> Well, I respect pains in the ass the most.<eos> Speaking of Eli, hello, Eli.<eos> Yes, sure, make me the butt of your jokes.<eos> So, Donna, I want the keynote.<eos> What do I have to do to get it?
Donna, I respect you mightily.<eos> Oh, come on, you do not.<eos> I'm just a pain in the ass.<eos> Well, I respect pains in the ass the most.<eos> Speaking of Eli, hello, Eli.<eos> Yes, sure, make me the butt of your jokes.<eos> So, Donna, I want the keynote.<eos> What do I have to do to get it?<eos> Impress me.<eos> Why do you want it?
Peter, if you're not taking the governorship seriously, I need time to plan my future.<eos> How much time?<eos> All 911 calls are erased.<eos> After 30 days.<eos> Yes, I know that.<eos> But your office is prosecuting a robbery that happened that same night.<eos> So the tape was preserved.<eos> So send a subpoena. You know the drill.<eos> You'll have it in a few weeks.<eos> I need it today.
So you'll drop the request to implead?<eos> 911.<eos> What's your emergency?<eos> Oh, my God, she's going to jump.<eos> Who is going to jump?<eos> There's a girl on the Glenhurst Bridge. She climbed over the railing.<eos> I can't get to her.<eos> We're dispatching an officer now. Please hurry!<eos> Your Honor, this tape has not been authenticated.<eos> We obtained it directly from the state's attorney's office. - Overruled.
That's why I think she's accusing me.<eos> Because she's angry with me...<eos> Objection.<eos> I'll withdraw that.<eos> Save everybody time. Here's dinner receipts, one belonging to Gerald Drescher.<eos> He's the CEO of Herald Equity.<eos> And the other belonging to Isobel Swift, his employee.<eos> Both for exactly the same amount, down to the penny.<eos> Meaning?<eos> They both had dinner together, split the bill in half and then expense-accounted it.
Without knowing it, you suborned perjury?<eos> Then you can't question him further, pursuant to the Code of Professional Responsibility, - not without knowingly suborning more perjury. - Right.<eos> But now the opposing attorney intends to put another witness on the stand to contradict him.<eos> With the truth?<eos> Or another lie, I don't know.<eos> Can I use this perjured testimony, now in the record, to question this opposing witness?<eos> You must represent the interests of your client.<eos> You were not aware of the perjury when it happened.<eos> To not use that perjured testimony would be to poorly represent your client.<eos> So, yes, you can use it.
I'm looking at our options.<eos> What?<eos> Your realtor friend came by, and dropped this off.<eos> It's not...<eos> She was just saying it was on the market.<eos> Do you see they still have the old swing there?<eos> You broke your leg on that swing.<eos> That swing almost killed you.<eos> I know, just I remember Dad pushing me on it.<eos> They repainted it, see?
- And I'm not gonna be a party to that.<eos> There are no real legal issues to dispute, so here is my order.<eos> Marshal your settlement arguments and meet me in chambers in one hour.<eos> Yes, Your Honor.<eos> I think I might try my hand at this lawyering.<eos> Very impressive.<eos> So I have to thank you.<eos> There's an art show, or something or other, near here.<eos> You're not really into art?<eos> No, but I don't actively dislike it.
- suspect the Good Samaritan? - No.<eos> Guns get bought and sold on the street all the time.<eos> So, this jewelry store hold up from two years earlier, did you take note of who the supervising officer was at the scene?<eos> Did I take note?<eos> No. Why?<eos> Officer Zimmerman, the undercover officer was the supervising cop...<eos> Mrs. Florrick, that is out of line.<eos> - What? I don't get it.<eos> - You're suggesting that the gun was a drop gun.<eos> That Officer Zimmerman retrieved it from the jewelry robbery and planted it...
Kiss me.<eos> Okay, just so you know, this is not the way you handle this meeting.<eos> And just so you know, if you want to talk about business, let's talk about business.<eos> If you want to talk about something else, we can talk about something else.<eos> Just don't mix the two.<eos> Yes, we interviewed Officers Zimmerman and Coffey two weeks ago?<eos> And you asked them about the possibility of a drop gun?<eos> Yes.<eos> We discovered that Officer Zimmerman had been present at an earlier crime scene where no gun had been recovered and inventoried.<eos> And the worry was that Officer Zimmerman had taken the gun into his own possession and never inventoried it?
Call the seller tomorrow, or I will.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> Good.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> You think he was having a sexual relationship with her?<eos> I checked his record.<eos> Two years after the murder, another camper accused him of sexual harassment.<eos> So you're saying, Rosa took Mary Jane's bike and rode it to this counselor's house?<eos> Justin Varney, but no one ever knew, because the body was found in the woods back near her cabin.<eos> The killer must have dumped it there.
That's confidential state's attorney business.<eos> But it shouldn't worry us? No.<eos> No, Peter will give me a very strong recommendation.<eos> And you won't have any difficulty going up against your old boss?<eos> Didn't have any difficulty going up against you two.<eos> I'm sorry about how all that went down the last few months.<eos> You mean the attempted indictment of me? Yes.<eos> I want you to know<eos> I was assigned that prosecution.<eos> I never would have chosen it.
You used to carry a big case load.<eos> Would you review every piece of evidence on every case?<eos> - That depended on how busy I was.<eos> - So what would you do with the evidence you couldn't review?<eos> - I'd farm it out.<eos> - To your co-counsel?<eos> No.<eos> I have to draw - a line somewhere.<eos> - Really?<eos> And this is where you choose to draw it? - Yes.
As part of your tax work, I called employers for updated checks.<eos> When?<eos> When did I call?<eos> Tuesday.<eos> Did you speak to anyone?<eos> Who?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He wouldn't give me his name.<eos> He asked for the number on your check.<eos> Did you give it?
But you also broke up a little family reunion that I had planned.<eos> That was you, wasn't it?<eos> Honest to a fault.<eos> What's this about?<eos> Someone kidnapped a child, murdered her mother.<eos> Just like Moretti murdered your mother, stole your childhood.<eos> - I survived.<eos> - This child won't.<eos> She's six months old, a baby.<eos> I know you're aiming to take over this city, but to control it, you need rules.
- Be ambitious and that.<eos> - Yes?<eos> I thought ... what if we put a business?<eos> A business what?<eos> I do not know.<eos> We'll think of something.<eos> Want to start a business without knowing why?<eos> You always say that I do not take it seriously.<eos> They offered me a space.<eos> Maybe you should give it some time and go see him.
Skinny bitch came to play!<eos> What kind of girl brings non-kosher cupcakes into a kosher home? Not me-<eos> - I'm not that kind of girl.<eos> Yeah, hi, I think I'm that kind of girl. Max, what are you talking about?<eos> I made sure every single one of those was up to a rabbi's high standard.<eos> Yes, well, maybe my rabbi didn't have such high standards.<eos> I'm so sorry, I burned some and we were running late and I figured, four non-kosher out of 80. So close.<eos> Max, I told you how important all those traditions are to a Jewish family.<eos> Yes, you told me about tradition and family, but none of that meant anything until I felt that cold compress.<eos> And she was nice enough to put it on my head and I felt what that feels like.
- Why should I regret?<eos> - Well, Ricco could.<eos> When you have a child, there is no turning back.<eos> Thanks for dinner.<eos> Ricco, wake up.<eos> Johan comes.<eos> I do not think Peter can.<eos> Stinna also comes.<eos> - Or better ... the bowling ball.<eos> - Why do you call it?
It will make you shit.<eos> Tony had an anxiety attack and ran screaming ... dying of thirst.<eos> He finished drinking his own pee.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - You took?<eos> - Nikolaj and I wanted to try.<eos> - Do not. - So we bought a pill ...<eos> - As your brother, I forbid it!<eos> Well ... it will not happen.<eos> Mom took it.
No.<eos> She's his intern.<eos> I mean, he's just... he's...<eos> he's trying to...<eos> - To be nice, to care.<eos> - Oh.<eos> I mean, Alex Karev is trying to be more human, and I think that we can thank me for that.<eos> They're doing it.<eos> They built you a beautiful bladder.<eos> Can I see it?
It's okay.<eos> Just a little.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here you go, doctor.<eos> But I hear stories of people waking up all the time.<eos> Not this.<eos> Not brain death.<eos> But... but he's still breathing.<eos> The machine is breathing for him.<eos> - When we shut it off...
50 years old, and she has to wear adult diapers to go on a date.<eos> Kind of takes the magic out of...<eos> "Let me change into something a little more comfortable."<eos> You're terrible.<eos> She probably saved herself some trouble.<eos> By her age, all the good ones are already snapped up.<eos> Tragedy, isn't it?<eos> Mm.<eos> I'm ready with this new bladder if anybody's interested.<eos> Uh, yeah. Bring it over here, Dr. Bailey.
Allowing natural death.<eos> Uh...<eos> We're-we're not... we're not there yet.<eos> Things are deteriorating significantly.<eos> You-you think that's what I should do?<eos> I think that you need to consider what kind of life you want for your son.<eos> Is it okay for him to be in pain every day?<eos> Is it okay if he needs a feeding tube for the rest of his life?<eos> Is it okay if he can't run, climb, or crawl?<eos> If you want the surgery, we'll do it.
What are you doing?<eos> Trying to figure out how many dermatology fellows my wife's banged.<eos> For sure her.<eos> Ooh, yeah, that one, probably, too.<eos> Ooh. "Specializes in complete body rejuvenation."<eos> Yeah, I bet you do, Cheryl.<eos> You gotta get over it.<eos> Everybody's got a past.<eos> Look, I'm fine with her having a past.<eos> It's just, I-I didn't know I was working with it and operating with it, seeing it in the cafeteria.
No.<eos> The conchoneta gym.<eos> One of the audience computers.<eos> Plates of practical activities.<eos> My plastic box.<eos> - Do you see a pattern?<eos> - Things disappear.<eos> Precisely, and I can not stand it.<eos> I want my plastic box.<eos> - I will not rest until it succeeds.
Isaak probably has his own key by now.<eos> Any ideas?<eos> Yeah, they can stay at my place.<eos> I'll get patrol cars to cover my house, just in case.<eos> How are you gonna explain that to LaGuerta?<eos> I'll tell her that I'm afraid lsaak's gonna come after me for his arrest.<eos> Your house isn't exactly kid friendly.<eos> - What does that mean?<eos> - Well, you have a gun.<eos> I'll lock it up.
A jailhouse door slamming shut That's my idea of music.<eos> I don't know what's driving me crazier, Hannah McKay getting away... with a shitload of murder, or you chewing on that straw.<eos> Old habits die hard.<eos> You know, it's gonna be a real downer for your book if Hannah gets away.<eos> People who buy true crime stuff tend to like it when the bad guy gets caught.<eos> Maybe I can help you rewrite the ending.<eos> - So now you're an editor.<eos> - I'm thinking about Hannah's husband.<eos> Forty year olds don't just drop dead of a heart attack.<eos> I could have the body exhumed, test it for aconite.
I don't need somebody.<eos> I know you don't.<eos> But I have this covered.<eos> Consider it a good-bye present.<eos> Okay.<eos> I suppose we're going for a record.<eos> A record?<eos> How many times we can say goodbye for good.<eos> Good bye.<eos> She isn't drawn to my darkness like Lila, or blind to it like Rita... and she doesn't need it like Lumen.
Was it making you feel trapped?<eos> She's not acting.<eos> Charge me with something, or let me go.<eos> I am trying to give you an opportunity to come clean about Sal Price.<eos> You'll be doing yourself a big favour when your case comes to trial.<eos> - Am I done here?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You're done. Trust me.<eos> You know, my grandma has this saying.<eos> "Trust those who seek the truth... but doubt those who say that they have found it."
Less reliable but, as you can see, just as deadly.<eos> Any weaknesses?<eos> Caffrey likes it up close and personal.<eos> Knives, piano wire.<eos> And as you saw, he's a vicious little cunt.<eos> Whereas Mickic doesn't like to get his hands dirty.<eos> Guns?<eos> Highpowered rifles specifically.<eos> He's a slave to ritual.<eos> He'll buy a rifle locally and be compelled to test it out first.
- Wait.<eos> What? - is having a parole hearing.<eos> - When?<eos> This morning at 10:00 A.M.<eos> I know this is sudden.<eos> Okay, thank you for letting me know.<eos> You're welcome, sir.<eos> That was the Department of Corrections.<eos> Hector Estrada is up for parole.<eos> He thinks there's a good chance he'll get it.
So shut the fuck up.<eos> Nadia's in Vegas. Vegas?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She moved there to work.<eos> Got a job in one of the casinos.<eos> - When?<eos> - Couple days ago.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's in my locker.<eos> I probably shouldn't he read it. What did it say?
- Couple days ago.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's in my locker.<eos> I probably shouldn't he read it. What did it say?<eos> That she's sorry but that she needed a new start.<eos> Staying here was too hard for her.<eos> She was really broken up.<eos> That all?<eos> That you really mean a lot to her and she'll never forget what you did for her.<eos> I'll be done in a few minutes, and I can go get it.
You gotta break through those walls. The sooner the better.<eos> You really think so?<eos> Yeah. Why don't you go?<eos> Now. Forge that friendship!<eos> Okay, I go. I have my gym bag in the car.<eos> Feel better!<eos> Okay, thank you!<eos> I'm just gonna lie here... Some ice on my back!<eos> I knew for a fact Claire never returned my tupperware,<eos> I just needed a few minutes alone to find it.
It's just a game, right?<eos> Well, unless there's something more to it.<eos> Maybe you should go talk to him. - Yeah. - Huh?<eos> Oh, I should have just kept my mouth shut.<eos> I mean, it was such a great day.<eos> After he thought he got that hole-in-one, he took us out to dinner. He bought me my first beer.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> He's probably hurt because you marred a very special father-son experience.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Ya marred it.
Oh! You know what we gotta do?<eos> We gotta get a picture of us all together on a boat. I think that's a thing now.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Accept my friend thingy.<eos> Sorry, mom, I-I didn't get a friend thingy from you.<eos> Yeah, you know, they have a lot of blocks on there to protect kids from weirdos. Mm.<eos> Okay. Good, good. I'll send it again.<eos> Great. Please do.<eos> Please don't.<eos> We got her request the first time, but ignored it.
I Wonder why.<eos> Good point.<eos> "Trust your instincts," the boss says.<eos> I'll get a plane back tomorrow from Dallas.<eos> See you later.<eos> [Spanish accent] Move away from the door.<eos> What do you want'?<eos> Where's the map'?<eos> [Exhales deeply] Under the sideboard.<eos> Get it.
Transoceanic is tight.<eos> Well, someone's not tight.<eos> Maybe someone in head office.<eos> Head office would give you a medal if they could.<eos> You've done an amazing job.<eos> Can I turn around'?<eos> Let's get a drink, celebrate your amazing achievement.<eos> When you reported the crash, the sheriff of Dona Ana County himself went out to investigate.<eos> He found the map and the money. He thought it was suspicious, so he called a local FBI agent to investigate.<eos> The agent took one look at the map and he sent it straight to Hoover in Washington.
What can the Anglophobes or the isolationists say'?<eos> What can America First say'? This is hard evidence.<eos> The Nazis are planning airline routes between Mexico City and Texas, for Christ's sake.<eos> They're on your doorstep, USA. It's no longer something happening across the Atlantic in distant Europe.<eos> This war is coming to you.<eos> But the map was bad.<eos> There was a spelling mistake.<eos> It's not "fur Miami." It's "nach Miami."<eos> It's not important.<eos> Raul was just going to hand the map in to a local newspaper, feed it into the system that way... until your plan took over.
I just want to save my brother.<eos> Evil cannot be destroyed with greater evil.<eos> Believing that you are not alone in this world, can help you conquer fear.<eos> And sometimes, your most powerful weapon ... is a mere embrace.<eos> But how am I supposed to do that?<eos> The mirror.<eos> You must seek the answer there.<eos> Listen carefully, Gerda.<eos> Take this boat and let the cold wind ... take you to the Snow Queen.<eos> My legend is always bigger than the truth, because it also reveals that such evil can be defeated ... can be defeated.
I'm OK.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> I can hear your breathing.<eos> Damon was right.<eos> You should have fed this morning.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Don't be.<eos> You had hope.<eos> That's all I ever wanted you to have.<eos> And you had it.
A little more suction right here.<eos> Cristina, please.<eos> Open the door, please.<eos> Cristina, if you don't open the door...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Cristina...<eos> Are you hurting yourself in there?<eos> Cristina, please.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Cristina, if you don't open the door, I'm gonna have to break it in.
Are you okay?<eos> Cristina...<eos> Are you hurting yourself in there?<eos> Cristina, please.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Cristina, if you don't open the door, I'm gonna have to break it in.<eos> I'm gonna have to, so...<eos> If you're all right, just open the door.<eos> Okay, I'm breaking in the door.<eos> So if you're close to the door, then just... get back, 'cause I'm breaking it in right now.
Just... ready when you are.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> So then, a 65-year-old woman is being seen by her primary care physician for a workup of osteoporosis when she is found to have elevated calcium.<eos> Her P.T.H. level was well above normal.<eos> Her doctor sends her to you.<eos> Elevated calcium and P.T.H. would indicate primary hyperparathyroidism.<eos> I would offer the patient a para... thyroidectomy.<eos> And first I would explore the right side.<eos> If that gland is large...<eos> I would biopsy it.
- Yes, she did.<eos> Your bag, please.<eos> What?<eos> - Search her.<eos> - You have no right to search me.<eos> She's right.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let's go!<eos> You shouldn't talk to her like that. You shouldn't even be here.<eos> If I want your opinion, Biau, I'll ask for it.
Of course not.<eos> You are very welcome.<eos> Francois said our father summoned you to his chambers last night.<eos> What did you speak of?<eos> Only trivial matters.<eos> Nothing worth repeating.<eos> Will you show me your necklace?<eos> It's a common piece of little merit.<eos> Your own is so much prettier.<eos> - But still, I'd like to see it.
You probably collapsed in front of her, she took you back to your room.<eos> I promise you, I can't remember a thing.<eos> Ah, Pauline...<eos> Where's Jeanne?<eos> Getting information from the tour office.<eos> Maybe you can help.<eos> What's this tape?<eos> - Where did you find it?<eos> - In Jeanne's vanity case.<eos> - Have you watched it?
Lucie is old enough, she'll understand.<eos> Forgive me, it's a lot to take in.<eos> I'm going to get some fresh air.<eos> Don't worry, Pauline, I won't be a bastard.<eos> Yeah...<eos> What are you going to tell Simone, regarding Miss Blanchot?<eos> The truth, that no one killed anyone.<eos> Here you are!<eos> Thanks for the sun lotion.<eos> I'm sorry, I couldn't find it.
No, she's 3, and I know.<eos> Do you know how many times I had to say good-bye to a furry friend on the farm?<eos> And didn't it make you stronger?<eos> Yeah, because I was a growing boy and they were chock-full of protein.<eos> But it was still heartbreaking.<eos> It builds character.<eos> You know, once, when I was a kid, my dad left my Luke Skywalker doll on an airplane, and I was so angry-- Wait, which--which Luke?<eos> Shorty robe or dress blacks? Shorty robe.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> And you know what he did to get it back?
But you can retrieve Shane's last text, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's gone... Forever.<eos> Come on, Maura, think.<eos> There's got to be a way to get those texts back.<eos> I told you... there isn't.<eos> Would you like some quinoa, kale, and yam?<eos> Sure, when I'm a contestant on "survivor."<eos> Oh, thank goodness. Look, Frankie brought us some mad dog 20/20 to go with our yams.<eos> [ Breathless ] I found it.
I'm very happy to see you.<eos> Just, uh, been a little slow today.<eos> It's--it's been a rough week.<eos> Yeah, I can imagine.<eos> I brought you some chicken soup.<eos> For me? Yeah.<eos> Come in.<eos> Excuse the mess.<eos> How did you know my address?<eos> The bail bondsman gave it to me.
Just as we start to get close...<eos> Damn if he don't blow off his head.<eos> Hara-kiri.<eos> No messing around.<eos> How do we know you're telling the truth? You don't.<eos> You just know what is.<eos> Come on, man, you guys ask Manfredo, he gonna tell you the same thing.<eos> Man just shot himself. Boom!<eos> Freaked me out.<eos> I wanted the gun, but Kevin took it.
I wonder if Klaus found your note yet.<eos> My note?<eos> Yeah, you know, the "I'm leaving you at the altar" note.<eos> Is that a thing?<eos> When you leave someone at the altar, you always leave a note.<eos> It's common courtesy.<eos> I think common courtesy went out the window when I did.<eos> Look, when Stella left me at the altar, at least I got an explanation.<eos> I mean, that note is what keeps you sane.<eos> You read it, you re-read it, you memorize it, you sleep with it, you sniff it because it still kind of smells like her, and then, finally... you let it go... tied to a brick, right through her perfect little suburban bay window. I'll just text him.
But let's be clear... if we see you out here anywhere near our people, if I so much as even catch a whiff of your scent,<eos> Deal.<eos> It has to stop eventually, right?<eos> It slowed down quite a bit already.<eos> If we can get him through this...<eos> When we get him through this.<eos> ...We'll need crutches.<eos> Right now we could use some antibiotics and painkillers, some sterile gauze.<eos> There's got to be an infirmary here.<eos> If there is, we'll find it.
Oh, Philip.<eos> That's better.<eos> Makes me feel less like a lobbyist.<eos> You don't have to be ashamed about liking the fight.<eos> Or fighting the fight.<eos> I love it.<eos> It's not the only thing, but nowadays, it's part of being alive.<eos> Really alive.<eos> Most people don't have it, what it takes to see the whole story.<eos> Being able to live with it, to use it.
Sometimes.<eos> That's easy.<eos> When you light a cigarette...<eos> The pack.<eos> Don't lunge for it like a brute.<eos> Do it gently.<eos> Almost like a caress.<eos> Then open it, like a fancy jewelry box.<eos> Then you choose the cigarette. Like you're voting for the best one.<eos> Take it, gently. Light it.
For distant galaxies, 10 billion years.<eos> A signal of light that reaches us today after travelling 4 and a half billion years, that is, the age of Earth, was emitted by a star contemporary with the birth of Earth. It witnessed our birth, if you will.<eos> And so, as we look further and further into space, we look further and further into our past.<eos> It was very interesting.<eos> Can I ask a question?<eos> You say we can look into the past. Can we also travel into the past?<eos> Imagine... that this flame is far, far, far.<eos> Very far.<eos> And its light... takes a long time a very, very long time to reach you.<eos> You still see it. even though... the flame has gone out.
Betrays you?<eos> If I had told you the truth--<eos> You don't keep things from me!<eos> You keep things from me all the time!<eos> That's because I'm your boss.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't be my boss anymore.<eos> I did what I thought I had to do for you, and if you can't... just fire me.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> That memo doesn't hurt me. It helps me.<eos> If I had buried it, we wouldn't have it.

It helps me.<eos> If I had buried it, we wouldn't have it.<eos> But you found it, so that's a good thing.<eos> What?<eos> Wh-what'd you do?<eos> Oh, what did you do?<eos> Allison had that freaking camera, and I was-- she implied that we were--<eos> What did you do?<eos> It's gone.<eos> You destroyed it?
What I feel slamming up against what I should do.<eos> Impulsive reactions racing to solutions, miles ahead of my brain.<eos> When I look at my day, I realize that most of it was spent cleaning up the damage of the day before.<eos> In that life, I have no future.<eos> All I have is distraction and remorse.<eos> I buried my best friend three days ago, and as cliché as this sounds, I left a part of me in that box.<eos> A part I barely knew.<eos> A part I'll never see again.<eos> Every day is a new box, boys.<eos> You open it, you take a look at what's inside.
But the thing you built... it's perfect.<eos> Rational.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> By design.<eos> What I made is just a machine.<eos> A system, and that's all.<eos> I don't think so, Harry.<eos> You may have fooled Nathan, but I know the truth.<eos> If you want to make something that understands human behavior, it has to be at least as smart as a human.<eos> You created an intelligence, a life, and then you ripped out its voice, locked it in a cage, and handed it over to the most laughably corrupt people imaginable.
What could you possibly want from it?<eos> The same thing you did.<eos> You may have told yourself you were helping people, but the real reason you built the machine is because the world is boring.<eos> Human beings have come as far as we're gonna go.<eos> I want to see what happens next.<eos> You're right, you and I are alike... in many ways... not that I'd care to admit it.<eos> I spent years wondering how people could be so cruel, petty, so selfish... and then I'd think about how you could change them.<eos> Fix them.<eos> And that's why I've sealed up the machine.<eos> Not to protect it from the people I was giving it to... to protect it from me, from people like us, from the things we'd do with it.

The only reason she helped us is because Division turned on her.<eos> We were the enemy of her enemy.<eos> It doesn't mean everyone in the government is our enemy.<eos> If you don't count Madeline, what about Ryan?<eos> Ryan got screwed over by the system almost as badly as I did.<eos> Michael, social services dumped me with Gary.<eos> Corrupt cops shook down Carla to steal her money, and they killed my friend.<eos> The bureau of prisons helped fake my death.<eos> This government has always treated me like I was expendable.<eos> And I'm gonna save it anyway.
Hey, you're hard to forget.<eos> But I could sense something else going on that night.<eos> Yeah, I was his prisoner.<eos> You and me both.<eos> It's hard to believe, you know?<eos> You're part of a powerful institution.<eos> You figure somehow it makes you safe.<eos> But it doesn't.<eos> So you don't trust government, either?<eos> Oh, I trust in it.
♪<eos> Checking in, sir?<eos> No, just visiting.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Bianca, it's Jimmy.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> What's with the gun?<eos> I got some trust issues right now.<eos> Well, give it to me or I'm out of here.<eos> Give it.
So?<eos> So who else might?<eos> Okay, I got to lay low, and staying here with you ain't exactly laying low.<eos> You know, you may never see me again.<eos> What do you think about that?<eos> I think you're being a little overdramatic.<eos> What the hell do you know?<eos> Bianca, I got to go.<eos> Then give me back my gun.<eos> Give it.
- Really?<eos> The journalist?<eos> Yeah, well, he does that too.<eos> He's one of the leaders of the resistance.<eos> So are we talking about the Verrat?<eos> - Because those guys are serious.<eos> - I think so. Look, I cleaned the wound.<eos> I can see the bullet.<eos> It's not that far in.<eos> And we're gonna get it out how?
You still insist that you weren't doing anything behind the school?<eos> We were reading magazines, that's all.<eos> Ask her.<eos> I'm not sure. I was standing far away.<eos> Thank you, Wadjda.<eos> You may return to your class.<eos> Give this file to Aunt Jamila.<eos> Close the door.<eos> This is a pledge.<eos> You'll sign it and you'll be able to stay in school.
I love you, and I look forward to spending many more birthdays together.<eos> You are the best, and now I really am late.<eos> I will see you tonight.<eos> I gotta run. Whoa.<eos> Whoa.<eos> What about the box?<eos> Huh? The what?<eos> The box... that's in your hands?<eos> Oh, the box.<eos> I... actually couldn't open it. You were up there for 20 minutes.
Well, at least we know you were right about that dress.<eos> Now, turn around, let me get you out of it.<eos> Seriously?<eos> We're this close?<eos> When I tell the whole neighborhood about it, I will be kind.<eos> You're a good friend, Lee.<eos> JUANITA: Celia, give me the remote.<eos> - CELIA:<eos> No.<eos> Stop. - Give it.
I think it's making fun of me.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let me get that for you.<eos> I'm doing Charlie's and mine anyway.<eos> Jennifer: Wow, thank you.<eos> Don't mind the granny panties.<eos> They're not mine.<eos> They just came with the basket.<eos> If your washing machine's broke, I'm pretty handy.<eos> - I can take a look at it.
You really walk the walk.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Because under normal circumstances, a guy comes into your house, eats your food, sleeps in your bed, oils up your ex-wife, a guy's got to get upset about that.<eos> - Well, I always say lead by example.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Could you pass the butter, please?<eos> - Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> That's my butter!<eos> You didn't ask!<eos> You just took it!

Your father means that pony.<eos> Why are there eight?<eos> One extra for luck.<eos> And...<eos> Cake! Cake!<eos> Blow out your candles.<eos> Happy birthday, sweetheart!<eos> All right, now. Maybe you need to go and have a lie...<eos> We've got to have cake. It's no party without a cake.<eos> Let's carve it up, huh? Let's slice it wide open.
New York.<eos> Masseria's orders.<eos> Get down!<eos> No,no,no!<eos> Go!<eos> - Where's Tonino?<eos> - Fuck him, let's go.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> Do you think I give a fuck?<eos> Put it down. Put it down!
- Thought you said Torrio.<eos> I want you to listen closely.<eos> My brother is there.<eos> You find him. You put him on.<eos> Nah, there's nobody's brother.<eos> Elias Thompson.<eos> He's there.<eos> He has to call me at...<eos> - What's the number?<eos> - You don't know it?
I was very afraid of that temper of yours.<eos> But after a while, I realized that you are very much like me.<eos> As I did you got stubborn when something was said to be impossible.<eos> This was why I didn't let you go.<eos> I am your father.<eos> If I can't protect you, stay behind you what kind of father am I?<eos> You are my first-born.<eos> Maybe that's why we are holding us so dear.<eos> You used to fall on your knees, you know?<eos> Then you came with the ointment and wanted me to apply it.
- Thank you, sir.<eos> Lydia.<eos> Oh, Michael.<eos> It is so good to see you both.<eos> We wouldn't have come by a day early like this, but we were kind of, uh, in the neighborhood.<eos> House shopping.<eos> Michael promised to buy a place in Southampton.<eos> Unfortunately, all the beachfront properties get snatched up the second they hit the market.<eos> One day, this bubble is gonna burst.<eos> Oh, well, let it.
Oh, well, we're getting a little ahead of ourselves, aren't we?<eos> I'm calling Conrad.<eos> We used to be such good friends, Lydia.<eos> What happened?<eos> You held me hostage at Grayson Manor after your attack dog threw me off the roof of my own apartment.<eos> Well, you certainly have a knack for landing on your feet, now don't you?<eos> What are you doing here, Victoria?<eos> Conrad's finished with you, and so am I.<eos> I am giving you a lifeline.<eos> The question is, are you wise enough to accept it?
It was nearly two decades ago that terrorist David Clarke, a top executive...<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Charlotte!<eos> Charlotte!<eos> Emily...<eos> You okay?<eos> This can't be real.<eos> All of Conrad's evidence, everything... that could have exonerated my father was on that plane.<eos> Not exactly.<eos> I, uh... unencrypted and backed up that mysterious hard drive before I gave it to McGowen.
It was a bad day, that's all, Dad.<eos> Well, more than a bad day.<eos> Bad day doesn't quite cover it.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I think you're nicked.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No.<eos> On the floor.<eos> I'll tell you what's going to happen here.<eos> Either you're going to grow a pair of balls and shoot me... which you won't... or I'm going to take that gun, shove it up your arse and pull the trigger.
Oh, this is me at full speed, by the way.<eos> You're not funny.<eos> Your mam used to think I was hilarious.<eos> It's the only reason she married me.<eos> Mam, meet Cassie.<eos> Cassie, this is me mam.<eos> You got your speech ready?<eos> Eulogy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can try it out on me, if you like.
- You heard me.<eos> Standing there in your fancy suit calling my story bullshit?<eos> Ms. Harrison, it's not my job to--<eos> To what? To care?<eos> To be a human being?<eos> To listen for two seconds?<eos> I was an assistant at Drecker for five years, and I finally got an idea for my own book.<eos> And my boss, who I thought was my friend, encouraged me to pitch my idea to her.<eos> So I did.<eos> And she took that idea, served it up to James Jenkins, and completely shut me out.
Well, I'm not feeling very well.<eos> I don't really care.<eos> And I also don't care how special Jessica thinks you are.<eos> Because you still answer to me.<eos> And you're gonna do every piece of work that I assign to you until you don't.<eos> Yeah, um, I just have to see Harvey first.<eos> Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Harvey can't help you.<eos> Now I want the detailed listing of every redundant position in the Swinton merger.<eos> And I want it yesterday, capisce?
Yeah, um, it didn't happen while we were watching Peter Pan.<eos> It happened while I was playing Peter Pan.<eos> Here's a photo from the day I was cast.<eos> That's me in the middle.<eos> But then I had my growth spurt.<eos> By opening night, I was too big for the flying harness, and, well...<eos> I fell hands-first right onto Jenna Cristalli.<eos> The tissues in her bra saved me two broken wrists.<eos> I'm sorry. I just, I just wanted to have one cool sex story that wasn't you.<eos> Next time you tell it, you were in your dad's car, which you stole to go to a Metallica concert, and you got to third base with that slut.
Breast?<eos> Hot sauce?<eos> Come on, it's right there.<eos> Max, now that I have big love for Sophie, I no longer say inappropriate sexual things to other women.<eos> I save all my hot sauce for her breasts.<eos> Love has made you a real old lady.<eos> Here you go, Brandy man. Enjoy.<eos> Max, you got a stamp?<eos> I wanna drop this off in the mail on my way home.<eos> I have one in my purse. I'll just get it.
It's not like I lost your child in the outback.<eos> It's symptomatic.<eos> Here, look at my purse.<eos> You know what, never mind.<eos> It's too late for a purse smackdown.<eos> But for the record, even if you win now, my purse will kick your purse's ass.<eos> Later, after it spent two weeks learning your purse's schedule.<eos> Organized, clean, perfect. Look.<eos> Just look at it.<eos> Look at it, Max. It won't bite.
If you had been able to find a stupid stamp in that horrid thing, I would've never even seen Earl's taxes and I wouldn't be standing in a dumpster.<eos> Max, no, no, no!<eos> I will never, ever recover from that!<eos> Red bulls?<eos> Red bulls?<eos> Are those our red bulls?<eos> Where?<eos> Yes! Yes! That's my garbage!<eos> That's my garbage! Get over here!<eos> If we find it, we'll have enough time to shower and get to the post office.
You come with me.<eos> The rest of you lock down both ends of the block until we get this guy out of here, understood?<eos> Who are we bringing in, Detective?<eos> Don Basile.<eos> He's going into protective custody until we can take down Elias.<eos> - You Carter?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How am I supposed to know you're not on Elias's payroll?<eos> You can't.<eos> You got another option, I recommend you take it.
We lived in an electric world.<eos> We relied on it for everything.
Am I such a coward?<eos> Really?<eos> See who'll get the crickets first?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> A rat!<eos> Look at yourself!<eos> You were laughing at Bao.<eos> Happy birthday.<eos> It comes in a pair.<eos> I bought it for the two of you.

I understand.<eos> Ok.<eos> Put the bag down.<eos> Here we go. Nice and slow.<eos> I've got the case.<eos> Bring them in.<eos> Ah, fuck!<eos> Tell me you've got your fucking eyes on her.<eos> Drop the gun.<eos> Drop it.
She'll be disappointed if we don't show up.<eos> She's 93. She won't be disappointed for very long.<eos> No, hang on.<eos> I followed all the protocols set forth by you in the relationship agreement.<eos> I made a written record request 72 hours in advance.<eos> I checked the tire pressure on the car.<eos> I even contacted the Centers For Disease Control to find out what shots they recommend for travel to Orange County.<eos> FYI, it's none.<eos> Amy, the relationship agreement was not designed for either one of us to get our way.<eos> You use it to get your way.

top of like three servers and it takes a lot of time<eos> I spent a lot of time on Photoshop.<eos> I taught my self how to design because I figured it would be pretty fun to learn how to do that.<eos> I taught myself through forums and tutorials and all that fun stuff.<eos> It was all about wanting to create something out of nothing.<eos> I studied marketing and I also did a minor in politic science<eos> I wanted to study something that was completely unrelated to tech, that was in liberal arts so that I could learn how people on the other side of the table were thinking and it was very enlighten.<eos> I was able to learn a lot about perspectives around politic theory and one of the things it helped me do was to understand power structures and politics is inherently turn around power and if I could learn how to navigate these power structures, I could be<eos> successful in other areas and so that is what political science really made me do<eos> I started a web design company, like every other web entrepreneur ends up doing at some point and I called it a design consultancy and we basically charged people to make layouts and it was really me and my buddy, like, hammering
No, Pierce, for the last time you're in the getaway van because your swami act is notoriously horrible.<eos> A, that is racist.<eos> B, swamis can't drive, they're Indians.<eos> Pierce, just do your part.<eos> Leave the entertainment to Britta and me.<eos> Ricky Nightshade, the rock 'n' roll magician.<eos> I'm starting.<eos> I need a volunteer.<eos> I'll kill anyone who raises their hand.<eos> Pick a card and look at it.
Are you okay?<eos> Check on him. Make sure he isn't faking.<eos> Frost:<eos> I'll call the paramedics back.<eos> Are you feeling any discomfort or tightness in your chest?<eos> [ sighs ] Maybe some.<eos> Okay, Ma, this is serious.<eos> It's a suspicious death.<eos> The food that you gave the dead guy is evidence.<eos> You think Stanley could have gotten rid of it?
We sure used to be.<eos> We stood up for what was right.<eos> We fought for moral reasons, we passed laws, struck down laws for moral reasons.<eos> We waged wars on poverty, not poor people.<eos> We sacrificed.<eos> We cared about our neighbors.<eos> We put our money where our mouths were, and we never beat our chest.<eos> We built great big things, made ungodly technological advances, explored the universe, cured diseases, and we cultivated the world's greatest artists and the world's greatest economy.<eos> We reached for the stars, acted like men.<eos> We aspired to intelligence. We didn't belittle it.
What's wrong?<eos> Aria left, I don't know anybody at this party, you're my ride, and I couldn't find you anywhere.<eos> I was a little preoccupied.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why did you really bring me here?<eos> There's no upenn guy who works at admissions anywhere in this cabin.<eos> Was this just some excuse so you could hook upith Eric?<eos> Can I please just have my application back?<eos> No, you can't.<eos> Steven has it.
Oh, there's no catch, no catch, no catch whatsoever.<eos> There are a few challenges along the way, but each day, you're going to encounter another different kind of species of shark.<eos> If you kill that shark... I, being the kind man that I am, will, uh, give you a reward to survive the next shark, but only, only a bit.<eos> You're sick.<eos> Do not say that again, or...<eos> I'll cut out your tongue.<eos> If you wanted to kill us, why'd you bring us here?<eos> Why didn't you just do it when you had the chance?<eos> Revenge... Is like a fine wine.<eos> If you have it, why not linger over it?
The one with the red eye -- the leader of the rebellion.<eos> He's waiting nearby so you can talk. I'll take you to him when you're ready.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Gentlemen, come, come.<eos> They could be right outside the door.<eos> If they wanted to attack this place, it'd be on fire by now.<eos> Arthur, I know it sounds risky, but we have to hear them out.<eos> Tom's right.<eos> This alliance is the only tactical advantage we have.<eos> We lose it, we're back to square one.
You know better than that.<eos> Then what are you looking for?<eos> A position in the new government?<eos> Because you had that -- no questions asked.<eos> Arthur, did you hear that boy?<eos> This is not the time to be arguing politics.<eos> We have to hear them out.<eos> No. Bressler's sees an opening, he'll -- Arthur --<eos> Tom, I offered you my hand.<eos> You slapped it away.
It's not going to happen.<eos> We can't have a marriage without a ring.<eos> - Must we have a ring?<eos> - Yes, we do.<eos> I will think about it then.<eos> There's nothing more beautiful than those women's work.<eos> Do they realize the treasures I am forced to sell?<eos> An archeologist digging out an old dinosaur's rib is classier to those assholes.<eos> I've been seeing your big hand for two minutes.<eos> What were you thinking? That I couldn't see it?

Come with us<eos> Big Brother help me<eos> We can't let you bring disaster upon the whole village<eos> Brother-in-law your hat<eos> Chen-style kung fu can't be taught to outsiders<eos> That's why only the Chen's may practice it<eos> I am not interested<eos> You can go a few rounds with them if you like<eos> This bell has been here for over a century<eos> We call it the Bronze Bell
He didn't clean up all week. What a mess.<eos> Why, that little...<eos> Just look at that idiot, putting on an act.<eos> What's with him?<eos> I hoped he could handle himself, but apparently not.<eos> Look at him just staring at us.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> He probably played games all night.<eos> My liquor!<eos> I warned him not to touch it...
Cleaning is part of our practices, but money management is not.<eos> What kind of duties does the defective RU-4 have here?<eos> In-myung is a guide robot who provides general information.<eos> But calling him "defective" does not seem suitable.<eos> If he's not defective...<eos> Are you saying he thinks on his own, rather than repeating the input data?<eos> Correct.<eos> He shares his own realizations with our believers and other monks.<eos> Don't monks struggle to attain enlightenment?<eos> You're saying a robot has attained it?
"THE HEAVENLY CREATURE"<eos> "WRITTEN AND DIRECTED BY KIM JEE-WOON"<eos> What should I do?<eos> What do I do?<eos> I have to order it before Dad finds out.<eos> Was it the eight ball?<eos> That stupid pool ball!<eos> Where am I supposed to order it from?<eos> Honey, have you seen my eight ball?<eos> They must have messed with it and lost it.
It was 2:00 in the morning.<eos> What was he gonna say?<eos> "Why don't we go somewhere private and talk"?<eos> They were in his dorm room.<eos> He was stuck. - There were no options.<eos> - You had an option.<eos> You could have not hidden under the bed.<eos> I made a quick decision.<eos> It may have been the wrong one...<eos> - "It may have been"-- - but once I made it, I had to commit to it.
Your parents would've done the same.<eos> How much insurance money can I get for one hand?<eos> $30,000.<eos> That'll cover your debt to us.<eos> Then, $60,000 for both?<eos> Then, cut this one, too.<eos> Get $60,000 and give me $30,000.<eos> I wanna play it one last time.<eos> If I continued with music, I would've ended up worse.<eos> I don't need it. Take it.
Well, then why are you always ripping on me?<eos> Oh, I understand the confusion.<eos> I have never said that you are not good at what you do.<eos> It's just that what you do is not worth doing.<eos> It's nicer than anything he's ever said to me. I'd take it and run.<eos> Thank you, Sheldon.<eos> Now will you give my paper to Hawking?<eos> Sorry, I can't.<eos> What, why not?<eos> I gave it to him three days ago.
We're here to talk partnership.<eos> Partnership.<eos> Yes. Equal.<eos> Three ways--<eos> You, Jesse and me.<eos> Well, we figure we're gonna start cooking again.<eos> You know, we figure, why not?<eos> There's no denying the popularity of our product.<eos> There's a market to be filled,<eos> - and currently no one to fill it.
You don't mean to get to them all today?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Hey, let's go!<eos> Open up!<eos> Back here!<eos> Oh, hi.<eos> How was your day?<eos> Um, are-- are you moving back in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll keep the condo for now, selling it in this market, I'd get killed.
We're just getting started.<eos> Nothing stops this train.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, yo, Mr. White.<eos> Hold up.<eos> I just wanted to say I liked your idea.<eos> You know, it's pretty, uh...<eos> I think it's the way to go.<eos> Oh, hey, um, you said it was your-- your birthday, so...<eos> I left the receipt in the box in case you wanna exchange it.
We keep him close.<eos> Under our control.<eos> Now, option three would be my choice.<eos> Shall we vote?<eos> I vote three, kid.<eos> You're still in.<eos> Right on.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You guys totally made the right--<eos> The next time you bring a gun to a job without telling me I will stick it up your ass sideways.
I have not been working this hard just to sell out.<eos> - It's not selling out.<eos> - Yes, it is, Jesse.<eos> I have- - We have suffered and bled, literally, for this business.<eos> And I will not throw it away for nothing.<eos> I don't know how else to say it, Mr. White.<eos> Five million dollars isn't nothing.<eos> Jesse, have you heard of a company called Gray Matter?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, I co-founded it in grad school with a couple of friends of mine.
My mom always made them like that.<eos> You put lemon in there too?<eos> They are from the deli at Albertsons.<eos> Well you know, good work on your shopping then.<eos> Because these are choice.<eos> I eat a lot of frozen stuff.<eos> It's usually pretty bad.<eos> I mean, the pictures are always so awesome, you know?<eos> It's like, "Hell, yeah, I'm stoked for this lasagna."<eos> And then you nuke it, and the cheese gets all scabby on top and it's like you're eating a scab.
We'll figure it out.<eos> Well, I guess that's it.<eos> Parting thoughts, of which I have two...<eos> First, as I said,<eos> I'll handle the legacy costs out of my end so you won't have to worry about my guys anymore.<eos> Second, the bug.<eos> The DEA will do a sweep.<eos> Can't say when.<eos> Could be anytime.<eos> But you need to get it outta there, sooner rather than later.
- Okay.<eos> Well, here we go.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Steady.<eos> The aluminum helps speed up the delivery of hydrogen chloride.<eos> Gently pour it in.<eos> No spilling.<eos> You're gonna like the Little Schticky, but you're gonna love the Big Schhticky.<eos> For bigger messes like dust bunnies under the bed or picking up after...<eos> Now... The CO2 freezes the liquid, crystallizing it, which gives us our finished methamphetamine.
- The what?<eos> - The, uh...<eos> Walt and Jesse are here.<eos> I don't want Walt and Jesse, Saul.<eos> - I want you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> - What do you need?<eos> I got a go-bag at the airport-- passports, money-- but there are eyes everywhere.<eos> I can't get close.<eos> I need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.
I need your help.<eos> - What do you need?<eos> I got a go-bag at the airport-- passports, money-- but there are eyes everywhere.<eos> I can't get close.<eos> I need you to pick up that bag and get it to me as soon as possible.<eos> Do you know how thick the crap storm is out there because of this?<eos> I told you not to use that lawyer.<eos> He's a hack!<eos> - Shut up, Saul, and get the bag.<eos> - Hey, Mike, I can get it to you, all right?
So?<eos> Maybe you should order something.<eos> Do you want a coffee or something?<eos> Not just now.<eos> I think this would play better if you ordered something.<eos> I think this will play just fine, and I'm not thirsty.<eos> So let's take a look at the list.<eos> Lydia, you've come all this way.<eos> - You do have the list?<eos> - Yes, I have it.
Welcome to special projects.<eos> Mac's going to be our new field operative.<eos> What?<eos> What about Drake?<eos> We need someone full time.<eos> That anomaly in the park, it opened again last night.<eos> That's three times in a week.<eos> Mm-hmm, but here's the weird part...<eos> It keeps on appearing in slightly different locations.<eos> We keep on missing it.
- This is very common.<eos> Two people often remember the same incident differently.<eos> Charlie, sometimes we selectively remember.<eos> I suppose that's possible, but I know for a fact that he took the guitar that I bought with my own money and smashed it in the driveway because I was playing it too loud.<eos> He's right.<eos> I did smash the guitar.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you. I thought I was going crazy.<eos> But not because you were playing too loud.<eos> I smashed it because I'd warned you if you don't get your grades up, I'm going to have to get rid of the guitar.
You're gonna be so happy that I listen to your intercom.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Room service.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Delivering champagne.<eos> I see you can afford it since the money you've been stealing from our clients hasn't been going to your wife's cancer treatments.<eos> Hey, Monica, how's it going? - Harvey.<eos> - Daniel and I need a minute.<eos> Letter of resignation.<eos> You're gonna sign it, and then name Jessica as your successor.
You're buying from the competition?<eos> - The grapes too, from the Chinese?<eos> - No!<eos> They're from our shop.<eos> This is really nice.<eos> - You like it?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - ls that the rose from Serge?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You kept it.
That's why now.<eos> Slater must have hoped Quentin would get a new trial.<eos> And when he didn't, Slater made sure that book was ready to go if Bradley didn't come clean.<eos> Eric Palmer gave me this check.<eos> What do you think?<eos> It appears to be the same stock and design.<eos> Nice.<eos> Detective Frost, oh, nice to see you.<eos> Bradley: Would you and your friends like to try our wall?<eos> We had it set up for our employees to build team skills.
Is oxygen serious?<eos> You know what? I lost a ton of time getting your glasses.<eos> I'm just gonna drop you at home. You can get your air. I can drive other people.<eos> I don't have any more tanks at home.<eos> Why? That seems like bad planning.<eos> Well, I forgot to order them.<eos> My pills make me forget things.<eos> Oh, shoot!<eos> I gotta take my pill!<eos> Please tell me you have it with you.
Auf wiedersehen.<eos> You look overwhelmed.<eos> Let me help.<eos> Forget that. You're gonna do this instead.<eos> Louis said I'm not allowed to prioritize your work anymore.<eos> You think I'm taking orders from Louis now?<eos> Consider things status quo.<eos> Yeah, well, they aren't.<eos> They are as far as you and I are concerned.<eos> I give you work, and you're gonna do it.
Donna.<eos> Donna.<eos> Donna!<eos> I'm sorry, but apparently Paul Porter doesn't believe in technology.<eos> Look, I need the employment survey.<eos> Yeah, I'm working on it.<eos> It's not done?<eos> It's a survey of all 50 states.<eos> You gotta get on this.<eos> Mike could have done it in his sleep.
The day I went missing... was the day I died.<eos> Five years in hell forged me into a weapon, which I use to honor a vow I made to my father, who sacrificed his life for mine.<eos> In his final moments, he told me the truth... that our family's wealth had been i0 built on the suffering of others.<eos> That he failed our city, and that it was up to me to save it and right his wrongs.
Sarah!<eos> There was a storm.<eos> The boat went down.<eos> I was the only survivor.<eos> She's not there!<eos> Sarah!<eos> My father didn't make it. No!<eos> I almost died, I...<eos> I thought that I had, because I spent so many days on that life raft before I saw land.<eos> When I reached it, I knew...
- To Walter's stock auction.<eos> - I think I rather be grounded.<eos> - No, it's important that you come.<eos> Important to whom?<eos> To me.<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> When you were 4 years old, you came home one day with a cat.<eos> It was a stray, it was filthy and it was mean.<eos> But you stood there and you declared that it was coming to live with us.<eos> Your father came home from the office and he saw what was going on and he sat you down and he explained to you that the cat was in fact a tiger and that we needed to get it home.
I mean a proper bullet.<eos> Smokeless powder.<eos> Copper jacket.<eos> That kind of thing.<eos> You know, they can't even make them.<eos> Not in this medieval cesspool.<eos> No, we've gotta go scavenging for antiques.<eos> Where's your rebel camp?<eos> Yes sirree, bullets are about as rare and as precious as diamonds.<eos> Which is why I only put one bullet in this gun and why I would prefer not to use it.
We lived in an electric world.<eos> We relied on it for everything.

' Yeah. How do you know where the hole is?<eos> Hey! I never ask you that question.<eos> And the dirty stuff begins.<eos> Beverly Hills Travel.<eos> 'Hold for Merc Lapidus.'<eos> 'Bethany! ' Hi, sweetie.<eos> I was thinking about you.<eos> I love that talking-dog show, 'it's hysterical.' It's not ours.<eos> Oh.<eos> Stop watching it.
Actually, about six feet.<eos> I actually find sex repellent.<eos> All those fluids and all the sounds, but my brain and my body require it to function at optimum levels, so I feed them as needed.<eos> You're a doctor; you understand.<eos> Uh, I'm not doctor.<eos> Were a doctor-- a surgeon, judging by your hands.<eos> Is your car parked nearby?<eos> Uh, yes, it's just outsi...<eos> How did you know I had a car?<eos> Parking ticket-- fell out of your purse when you dropped it.
Lovely writing, I must say.<eos> Passionate without unnecessary histrionics.<eos> Though I believe there is an "a"... 'm "vengeance.<eos> You alright, ma'am?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Thanks for askin'.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> A bottle.<eos> You gonna pay for that?<eos> Put it on my tab.
So you let niggers drink in here?<eos> What you looking at, boy?<eos> Trash got a name?<eos> Or you just go by "Trash?" Now, Mr. Ferguson,<eos> I don't want no more shooting' from you.<eos> Mr. Ferguson. Mr. Ferguson.<eos> Now, that's pretty funny.<eos> Where you get that pistol, Mr. Trash?<eos> - This one here?<eos> - Touch it and I'll blow your head off.
What are you doing here?<eos> Have you gotten lost?<eos> No, Father, I came here to see you.<eos> Have you had a revelation?<eos> No, I wanted to ask you an important question.<eos> I want to know what a "bronze snake" is.<eos> Is it from the bible?<eos> Yes, it's from the Old Testament.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> Moses crafted a bronze snake, affixed it to a staff, and whomever was bitten by a snake, and beheld the bronze snake, their lives would be saved.
We used to come here to forget about the world.<eos> It's safe.<eos> Red John didn't kill her, Patrick.<eos> You'll never convince me that he did.<eos> I'd kill for a cup of tea right now.<eos> I can make you one.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> But we can't stay here.<eos> Why not?<eos> If Miranda bought this place, the police'll find it.
I don't need words.<eos> I know what the earth is thinking.<eos> I know what squirrels are thinking. I mean, like, not, like, you know, crazy like that.<eos> It's just...<eos> I died on that table for eight seconds, Doc.<eos> I'm one of the few who's gone to the other side and made it back.<eos> And what happened on the other side?<eos> I saw an angel... holding a trash bag.<eos> A trash bag?<eos> You know, like, for leaves. And she was just holding it, and I just took all the collected bullshit from the last 20 years and put it into that bag... twist-tied it, and I chucked it into the spiritual dumpster.

I dug Russell up.<eos> Russell Edgington was the only vampire powerful enough to take Roman Zimojic out.<eos> All you want is power.<eos> No.<eos> I want to share it.
Are you gonna be able to live with yourself if you give up on that man?<eos> My Jesusito, he had a gift.<eos> I will take back what belongs to me.<eos> You take this, you grow up to be big and strong.<eos> Emma?<eos> I don't know you no more.<eos> Being on V gives him too much advantage.<eos> I'm prepared to lose.<eos> Your magic is finite.<eos> You will run out if you aren't careful how much you use it.
- You said so.<eos> - Yeah, it's just-- it's just--<eos> All right, all right, all right.<eos> All right, listen here.<eos> Listen here.<eos> Now, you need to do this, brother.<eos> It's gonna feel good.<eos> It's gonna help you heal.<eos> Hey.<eos> Now... I'm gonna lock this door and it ain't opening till you finish her.
Oh, thank God.<eos> A friendly face.<eos> I've been so freaking lost.<eos> I'm coming for you.<eos> You are mine.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> It's time to start flexing our muscles around the globe.<eos> To start crushing the mainstreamers.<eos> Nora.<eos> Mainstream is a global problem, of course, but we have to start dismantling it locally.
Next time, don't come at all.<eos> Family problems or not.<eos> - What did you tell him?<eos> - That your mother's in the hospital.<eos> Léa!<eos> Léa, wait!<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you coming over?<eos> I've got the film you missed.<eos> We could watch it this evening.
Did you have to put her there?<eos> I had no choice.<eos> What? You can't just go like that.<eos> Stop!<eos> Go home!<eos> I can see something's wrong.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Tell me what's up!<eos> I don't want your help.<eos> I don't want it. Understand?
He's not gonna tell me when we're not alone.<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> I'm not gonna leave you alone with that guy.<eos> You make it so hard to be a modern post-feminist when you get so Alpha-male.<eos> Well, you want me to stop?<eos> No.<eos> Hold still!<eos> You kiss pretty good for a man without a spleen.<eos> I still have it.<eos> They just shot a hole through it.
It's so good to see you.<eos> It's not a social call, Martin.<eos> You lied to me about Paul's death.<eos> - The truth.<eos> - The truth isn't gonna make you happy.<eos> Michael is missing.<eos> What happened? Why don't we start with what really happened in Vienna ten years ago?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> No, it's really simple.<eos> I need the truth to find my son, and you're gonna tell it to me.
Personnel file.<eos> First name John.<eos> Special Forces, stationed at Fort Lewis between June and September of '01.<eos> My eyes only.<eos> Yeah, thanks, Gene.<eos> - What is it, Finch?<eos> What exactly is your plan once you catch up to Deputy Jennings?<eos> To get Sarah away from him. And Jennings?<eos> Jennings had his chance.<eos> He didn't take it.
I'll do anything.<eos> Y-you could have the file.<eos> What file?<eos> Camille gave me a file of evidence against Jason Brodeur.<eos> Where is it?<eos> ! Let me go, and I'll tell you.<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Wait! Wait! Don't go!<eos> It's in my desk! The file, it's in my desk at the office!<eos> You can have it!
I'm sending you back to the DPD.<eos> But this mission isn't dead yet.<eos> Langley has asked me to evaluate your well-being in the field.<eos> Who ordered the assessment?<eos> I can't marry you.<eos> You should have this back.<eos> Good-bye, Auggie.<eos> You'll begin therapy.<eos> This is mandated.<eos> I didn't need it after my injury, and I don't need it now.
It won't go away with an architectural facelift.<eos> Did you just use my wife for political purposes?<eos> Didn't you just do the same?<eos> If you want to make sure this project turns out right, perhaps you should come work for me to ensure a better outcome.<eos> What?<eos> I need to fill the vacancy left by Ezra Stone, and you need to part ways with Alderman Ross.<eos> No?<eos> Admit it.<eos> The only thing he wants to keep intact at Lennox Gardens is the dirty pipeline of money and votes.<eos> You stay where you are, imagining change, or decamp and make it happen.
Not bad, all things considered.<eos> Oh, you're so brave.<eos> Now, listen, there's something we need to talk about.<eos> Look, I know the child support checks are late, but, but please allow me to get back to my job.<eos> Er? Forget the child support.<eos> Er? You just get better.<eos> I can manage fine without your money.<eos> All right.<eos> I always suspected as much, but thank you.<eos> And Herb and I have the condo in Palm Springs, so you're certainly welcome to use it while you're recuperating.
You're not coming with me?<eos> I cannot go anywhere without my Insulin.<eos> You barely survived last time.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> No, you can't.<eos> I'm not going.<eos> Do you know why they only give me enough Insulin for one day at a time?<eos> It's how they control me.<eos> They find your weakness and use it against you.
Is everything okay?<eos> The situation has been resolved.<eos> We're fine now, Detective.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Doesn't sound resolved to me.<eos> So Peck asks about your machine, and now someone's trying to kill him.<eos> Something you want to tell me, Finch?<eos> As with all computer systems, the big problem is human error.<eos> Strictly speaking, the machine is not legal.<eos> I always knew that certain measures would be taken to protect it, but...

I used to be a software engineer, Harold.<eos> Remember, back before I became your corporate beard?<eos> Any system can be compromised, given enough time.<eos> We need an off switch, a back door, and this is our last chance to build one.<eos> You are a talented engineer, Nathan, so you should remember...<eos> Any exploit is a total exploit.<eos> The tiniest crack becomes a flood.<eos> If we build a back door into this machine and someone else finds out about it, that would be...<eos> Very bad.<eos> We need to trust the machine, exactly as we built it, and then let it go.
I'm sorry.<eos> Good location.<eos> Clear line of sight, but enough obstructions and distance to avoid being seen.<eos> I built an app that alerts me if I ever get within 100 meters of her.<eos> I've never regretted building the machine.<eos> But I didn't fully realize the personal cost.<eos> I'm good with computers.<eos> People-<eos> - Well, people other than Grace-- have always been a mystery to me.<eos> I failed to recognize the lengths to which they would go to protect the machine, to control it.
Is it such a big...?<eos> Shh. Yvette!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Closed eyes do not necessarily a coma make.<eos> You think she's faking?<eos> It's T-Blossom deodorant-- the same as in the crime scene.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for a syringe.<eos> What for?<eos> I'm going to stab it into the softest part of Ms. Ellison's thigh.
Can't you tell?<eos> You're still thinking about the case.<eos> Obviously Yvette Ellison didn't kill Casey McManus, but given that his neighbor picked her out of a photo array, it stands to reason that the real killer bears a striking resemblance.<eos> The question is: who is she and what did she have against Casey?<eos> Well, is it possible that Detective Bell was right and that the neighbor was lying about seeing the woman on the stairs?<eos> Hey, I found something in the hall closet the other day.<eos> Was it the zipper mask?<eos> 'Cause I swear I'm just holding that for a friend.<eos> It's a trophy from an old case.<eos> Forgot I still had it.

Where's he going?<eos> Was it something I said?<eos> Invading my privacy, not okay.<eos> Said the walking, talking professional invasion of privacy.<eos> I am here to work with you.<eos> I thought you understood that by now.<eos> I'm sorry, wasn't it you that said we were supposed to be learning more about each other?<eos> That's how companionship works, is it not?<eos> Is this because of the violin yesterday?<eos> Because I think you made your point when you set it on fire!
But some of us know a lot about high-end italian rides.<eos> It's a german car, you idiot.<eos> I think they're crotch-blocking each other.<eos> "Crotch-blocking"?<eos> Really? [ cellphone vibrates ] Mm.<eos> It's my old nordic-history professor. His office says he's almost here.<eos> Mrs. Vanilla. We found your wallet!<eos> Angela:<eos> Rondo, thank you! Oh!<eos> Where'd you find it, Rondo?

Oh!<eos> Where'd you find it, Rondo?<eos> I knew you guys didn't take it.<eos> Well, we checked the trash. Dania found it in a dumpster.
That's so funny.<eos> I met this guy at Nate's Diner.<eos> And he was a ballplayer, too, from the visiting team.<eos> He told me I was the prettiest girl in the greater Beloit area, but after we made love, I never heard from him again.<eos> You know, now that I think about it, I don't think I ever played ball in Beloit.<eos> Also, I'm allergic to apples.<eos> So, that's weird.<eos> I was okay with him not calling.<eos> I still felt special that he picked me.<eos> But then last year I heard about this superstition in baseball where if a player's in a hitting slump, he tries to break it by sleeping with the ugliest girl he can find.
I don't know, but he drove there.<eos> His credit card showed that he gassed up on Houston at 2:44 AM.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's figure out where he went.<eos> Trouble might have followed him to the garage.<eos> Or a zombie did.<eos> I'll tell you where he went.<eos> Booty call.<eos> Tech guys pulled a text message off David's phone.<eos> He sent it to a chica the night he died wanting to hook up with her.
No, they're not for me.<eos> Predictable and safe.<eos> Safe doesn't interest me.<eos> When I was a boy, my father left us-- died, actually.<eos> My mother packed me up and took me on a world tour.<eos> - For how long?<eos> - Years.<eos> We spent at least a month at every place, sometimes six.<eos> My mother homeschooled me on the road.<eos> What better education than learning about the world while seeing it?
Then leave.<eos> Of course. I just wanted to give you something from your mother.<eos> Partly because I couldn't help noticing that things have been kind of difficult between you two.<eos> But it can wait.<eos> What? What is it?<eos> No, really, sweetheart, it can wait.<eos> You get some rest.<eos> What is it?<eos> As you know, your mother wrote a suicide note to explain away our difficult situation to the police.<eos> She wrote this note to explain it to you.
Scott, go.<eos> Go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> Over here.<eos> Is this your house?<eos> It was.<eos> I'll tell you all about it.<eos> But first... did you bring the flower?<eos> I couldn't find it.
Okay.<eos> Hello?<eos> Over here.<eos> Is this your house?<eos> It was.<eos> I'll tell you all about it.<eos> But first... did you bring the flower?<eos> I couldn't find it.<eos> That's okay.<eos> But since you don't have it, I'm gonna need that kiss.
You don't trap a creature this dangerous.<eos> You kill it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can't talk, got to run.<eos> Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh.<eos> Where's your gun?<eos> I left it at the station along with my badge.
Scott!<eos> Stay out of the way!<eos> Careful, gentlemen.<eos> Something wicked this way comes.<eos> Why me?<eos> Because I got to make sure that argent doesn't completely ruin the plan.<eos> Okay, look, you better do it intravenously which means in the vein.<eos> When you find him, you pull back on this plunger right here.<eos> In the neck probably is going to be the easiest.<eos> So you find a vein, you jam it in there, and pull back on the trigger.
Last chance.<eos> He...<eos> He's Viktor Azimoff's son?<eos> The CIA has had me under surveillance for the past ten years.<eos> Can you show any contact between Azimoff and me?<eos> Maybe I can.<eos> Let's talk about your bank account at Maryland federal.<eos> My life insurance settlement?<eos> What about it?<eos> You've been drawing out of it for years... a few thousand here, a few thousand there.
May want to up your security.<eos> You know something we don't?<eos> One of our agents does.<eos> We're bringing her in as we speak.<eos> Let me put it to you this way:<eos> You're insane. Mia's in the enemy combatant wing.<eos> That means no prison yard, no common time.<eos> Only time she sees anyone is when a guard shoves food through a door slat.<eos> Sonya already covered this. - I have the prison schematics.<eos> Well, Sonya probably didn't tell you this, but the place is privately run. They have proprietary software. I haven't got a chance to hack it.
Elaine, it's very important that you understand this is only a lead.<eos> We will do anything we can to help.<eos> Anything. There's something you've already done.<eos> It's why I'm here.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I looked up that case you were talking about.<eos> Alexandra Udinov.<eos> Did you know she carried her father's watch around with her?<eos> I think I remember reading that.<eos> Evidently, she looked at it every day. As a reminder of who she really was.
Hey!<eos> Here, son.<eos> Drink.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> That's all we've got.<eos> If anybody's making it out of here, it's gonna be him.<eos> I'm so sorry, I thought I'd have more time.<eos> I'm not the man you think I am.<eos> I didn't build our city.<eos> I failed it.
- A lapse.<eos> It's quite a few lapses. Your place.<eos> My place. My place again.<eos> Come on, Merlyn.<eos> We both know that you're not a one-girl type of guy.<eos> Depends on the girl.<eos> I have to go back to work.<eos> Dinah Laurel Lance.<eos> Always trying to save the world.<eos> Hey, If I don't try and save it, who will?
Every 20 minutes, a guard removes the collected cash from the box office.<eos> And the guard carries the cash to Rising's office.<eos> The cash is dropped into a specially designed lockbox.<eos> You can put things in, but only a bank official can open one up to take things out.<eos> It's like a mailbox you can carry.<eos> And that is where Rising will add the extra cash to the lockbox.<eos> As long as no one looks too closely, they'll never know that it didn't come from legitimate ticket sales.<eos> It's classic money laundering.<eos> Once the box office is closed, the lockbox is carried from Rising's office to a loading zone.<eos> An armored car picks it up, takes it to the bank.

She said... she thought it was Mr. Russell.<eos> Why in the hell didn't you say anything?<eos> I did say something... to her.<eos> I told her she was a nasty, attention-seeking brat, and I couldn't believe she'd think such a terrible thing about somebody like Mr. Russell, who'd done so much for this town and the library and all the children.<eos> And then I told her to keep her lying little mouth shut.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I was in love with Trent Russell, and I couldn't believe he'd do such a thing.<eos> What do you believe now?<eos> The patio?<eos> He redid it, two weeks after Hanna disappeared.
I know what I am.<eos> But I also know that she's the best thing that's ever happened to me, and I will do whatever I gotta do to save her.<eos> Well, if you go charging in at George half-cocked, you'll be dead before you can even do her any good.<eos> Come on, we need to move.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's a dead end.<eos> What now?<eos> We consider our options.<eos> Shooting at cops isn't one of them.<eos> You got a better idea, let's hear it.
No, thank you, and from the looks of Gemma's lungs, she didn't, either.<eos> Looked like a smoking lounge.<eos> So what was she doing up there so late?<eos> Taking in the view?<eos> Wasn't exactly a novelty.<eos> She'd been at the company four years.<eos> Maybe she was with someone she knew, and they got into an argument, which would explain this-- the cut on her scalp.<eos> It matches the end of this hairpin.<eos> But there are no cells on it, which means, though, there has to be another one.<eos> Killer could have taken it.
Beckett!<eos> Castle?<eos> Withholding evidence, lying to a superior officer--<eos> What you did dishonors this city and dishonors the badge.<eos> Not only are you off this investigation, I'm putting you both on administrative leave effective immediately.<eos> Sir-- Don't you "Sir" me.<eos> You don't deserve to wear the uniform.<eos> Now hand over your badges and guns.<eos> Detective Beckett.<eos> Keep it.
A robotic president?<eos> So my plan was, drive Claire and Mitchell home, put them to bed, pour myself a big tumbler of scotch, and tell Dede it was over.<eos> But on the way out, we made one last stop.<eos> If destruction be our lot, we ourselves must be its author and finisher.<eos> As a nation of free men, we must live through all times...<eos> I don't know what happened.<eos> Maybe I just chickened out.<eos> But I realized that staying with my kids was more important than leaving my wife.<eos> Now that's not the right decision for everyone, but it was the right decision for me.<eos> And in that faith, let us, to the end, dare to do our duty as we understand it.
So I went over to her place...<eos> Invited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's not like I busted in.<eos> When I told her it was over, she went ballistic.<eos> Next thing I know, she's slapping me...<eos> Goes into my coat and grabs my gun, and...<eos> Frank, when I was on the job, I must've talked 100 skells into dropping their weapons.<eos> But not this girl.<eos> She just let me have it.
So, how's living alone?<eos> You know, it's interesting.<eos> When I first moved into my new apartment, I was nervous.<eos> For the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate.<eos> For the first time in my adult life, I didn't have a roommate!<eos> If I want to walk around naked, nobody cares.<eos> If I want to leave the laundry basket in the middle of the living room, nobody stops me.<eos> If I bring home soup from the deli and leave it in the fridge for two days, nobody eats it.
But you're on a motorcycle.<eos> - This is me with Jay Leno.<eos> - He's such a dick.<eos> I know, but don't you just love him?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No. Ye-No.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm the one with the tax rebate.<eos> - Can I take it?
Lev and Benji are artists.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The only people who can afford to be artists in New York are rich.<eos> I'm an artist. I'm not rich.<eos> You are rare.<eos> We need whiskeys.<eos> It's just, this apartment is very...<eos> aware of itself.<eos> Everyone who comes here loves it.<eos> I love it.
That in, in tormenting me, he was attempting to correct what I knew to be wrong with myself.<eos> One day, after a particularly brutal lesson left me in a very bad way, a teacher asked me who was responsible.<eos> I said I'd fallen down the stairs.<eos> Funny, the things that we do for the people that we care about.<eos> Uh, did he do that to you-- the person that you care about?<eos> No.<eos> I was in my room the other night... and it was hot.<eos> I tried to open the window, but it was stuck, and my hand went through the pane.<eos> And he took care of me.<eos> He put a bandage on it.
I'm gonna go brush my teeth now.<eos> I don't think you're gonna be here when I get back.<eos> If it's any consolation, I don't think I'm gonna stay in this city much longer.<eos> I think it's time to move someplace else, meet new people.<eos> I'm gonna miss our little chats.<eos> I just got an e-mail from my friend from the D.A.'s office.<eos> He said the language from the immunity agreement is pretty ironclad. "Adam Kemper . is immune from prosecution."<eos> "For any crimes committed in consort with Samuel Abbott, aka the Balloon Man."<eos> Yes, I'm quite familiar with the phrasing.<eos> I've been reviewing it myself.
Their call lasted 30 seconds;<eos> Hoffman's phone went dark immediately afterwards, but Mathers is still online.<eos> He's headed for the casino.<eos> That's Hoffman's stomping ground.<eos> Okay, it stands to reason Astrid would go there looking for her father, but why reach out to Mathers?<eos> Well, if she called him, then Mathers probably realized he's been hunting for the wrong person.<eos> If that's true, once he finds Astrid, he's going to kill her.<eos> Astrid's too smart to let Mathers find her like this.<eos> She couldn't get him at his lab, so she led him here.<eos> If Astrid still has the gun, I think she might use it.
To protect herself?<eos> To protect her dad.<eos> We got eyes on Mathers.<eos> He's on the west side of the floor.<eos> Looks like he's headed towards the kitchen.<eos> Moving in.<eos> Mathers!<eos> He's got a weapon!<eos> Mathers, drop your weapon.<eos> Drop it.
He couldn't give a damn about old Soviet agents.<eos> You just said it.<eos> He's an arms dealer.<eos> He wanted the bomb.<eos> To sell. It'd be the mother of all weapons deals.<eos> Siderov knew Turner was tracking the other Soviet sleeper agents.<eos> He gets Turner, he gets the names of the agents.<eos> Siderov knew there were more bombs.<eos> That's what was in Turner's stomach. It was a list of the sleeper agents.<eos> Turner needed me to find it before Siderov.
Well, I spoke with everyone at the station, including her boyfriend.<eos> No one admits to being the partner or even knowing what she was working on.<eos> There's nothing in her phone records either.<eos> Yeah, well, there's gotta be something that we're missing.<eos> Speaking of missing something,<eos> Castle should be way more excited about his date tonight.<eos> Why?<eos> According to "Celebrity Examiner," Kristina is notorious for seducing famous men with her extensive bikini collection.<eos> What?<eos> Jenny buys it, and it just happened to be open to that page on the coffee table.
"Man is born free but is everywhere in chains".<eos> To what thoughts does that inspire you?<eos> Society as a prison.<eos> In order to live in society, one must control others.<eos> Yes.<eos> Man is legally free but in fact enslaved.<eos> Beast and man are often distinguished by the fact that man is free.<eos> In society nonetheless is man less free.<eos> Therefore freedom is an illusion, an ideal unobtainable in reality.<eos> Rousseau thought that it could be.

Just tell us what happened.<eos> Well, I'm not sure exactly.<eos> The bank called this morning...<eos> cedar hills savings and loan.<eos> They said that they were concerned because they had some checks that they needed to process, but there was no money in the account.<eos> There should've been over $357,000 in this account.<eos> Any idea where the money went?<eos> The bank said that it was transferred out Friday night, wired to that numbered account in Curaçao.<eos> I suggested that someone must've hacked into the account.<eos> But they said that whoever made the transfer made it from a computer that was recognized by the bank's online system.
- Yeah, why?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> It's none of my business, but he just seems too old for you.<eos> - He's 29.<eos> - What?<eos> I'm gonna have to see you and your girlfriend's ticket.<eos> I thought I put the ticket in here. Tickets.<eos> You put two tickets in there, honey.<eos> Okay.<eos> I cannot find it.
All right, thanks.<eos> What do you got?<eos> Rand Hilbert was booked on a 6:00 a.m. shuttle to Boston but was refused boarding because of his quote,<eos> "inebriated and agitated state."<eos> Then he's home?<eos> No.<eos> The night doorman says he got in a town car at 4:30 to the airport;<eos> the day doorman says he never returned home.<eos> And the doormen have your number?<eos> Yeah, and they get 50 bucks to use it.
Turn around.<eos> All right, hold that.<eos> I got it.<eos> He's clean, Jack.<eos> Come in and get that air conditioner fixed quick, all right?<eos> All right.<eos> It'll just take me a minute.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's too hot to sleep.<eos> Okay, uh, well, we're fixing it now.
You think we should talk about this deputy mayor thing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It sure came out of left field.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe after dinner.<eos> That'd be good.<eos> Okay, it's a date.<eos> Works for me.<eos> Oh, I forgot the applesauce.<eos> I'll pick it up on the way back.
There's a lot more to the word "coward" and the word "hero" than you think. It's complicated.<eos> You're not a coward if you're frightened.<eos> That's not what it means.<eos> You're a coward if you know what needs to be done and you don't do it.<eos> I was telling that man out there that I have a lot to lose.<eos> Our work, the life we have here. You.<eos> I told him I love you so much, I wouldn't know how to say goodbye.<eos> When your mother got sick I promised her I'd protect you no matter what.<eos> But I'm conflicted.<eos> There's a time for recording history and there's a time for making it.
He's lost a lot of blood, maybe two pints.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Oh, uh... It's a car accident.<eos> It's a long story.<eos> Let's hear it.<eos> Let's hear it all.<eos> - Did you shoot this man?<eos> - No.<eos> Check the ballistics on his gun.<eos> Hey, I want it back after you've done with it.
You're smart enough to know that that's not an excuse.<eos> This is going to stay between us.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Thought we came to Houston to pick Odum up.<eos> He told Gates this place was being used for smuggling military ordinance.<eos> Ground's wet.<eos> Those look like bloodstains to you?<eos> Hosed it down, covered it up.<eos> Shell casing. (Sniffs)<eos> - They must've missed it during the cleanup.
See, there was a print in the park across the street from where Monroe lives.<eos> And believe it or not,<eos> I saw those very same boots on my local postman.<eos> Who happened to be the guy that we were after.<eos> Well, that was kinda lucky.<eos> Well, a little luck, a little skill.<eos> You develop a nose for these things.<eos> That's amazing, based on a pair of boots you could find out where the guy lived.<eos> Yeah, and his cabin is way out there.<eos> I don't think Nick could have found it without me.
Actually the only time my mother bought milk was when my face was on the side of the carton.<eos> Are you sure you're all right?<eos> Yeah. I guess there is such a thing as luck.<eos> And tomorrow night when you come in for takeout, Sophie, all Max has to do is hit this little thing.<eos> Well, if I'm allowed to hit little things, you're next.<eos> Change makes everyone so tense.<eos> Kitchen is now closed.<eos> I have plans.<eos> Big plans.<eos> Sophie, I understand your relationship with Oleg is complicated, so let's simplify it.
We can add this Earl bonus money to our cupcake business total.<eos> Yeah, that 150 will really put a dent in the 250,000 we need.<eos> We'll get there, Max.<eos> Because you and I have something Martha Stewart and machines don't.<eos> Unpaid bills?<eos> Mushrooms growing on our bathroom rug?<eos> No, each other.<eos> Aww, a year later you're still trying to get me to feel things.<eos> Do you wanna know the real reason I thought this necklace was so lucky?<eos> I was wearing it the day I met you.
Previously on "Once Upon A Time"...<eos> We are in a land without magic, but I'm bringing it.
For that, death is too good for him.<eos> First, he must know pain... my pain.<eos> No.<eos> You poisoned her?<eos> I cursed her.<eos> She will never bear a child.<eos> Choose wisely.<eos> We must be vigilant if we hope to survive the journey.<eos> Where's my gun?<eos> I want it back.
With magic back, it could be even worse now.<eos> Like, vaporize us.<eos> - Let's go home. - Guys!<eos> We are the royal guard!<eos> Dwarves loyal to Snow White!<eos> This is our chance to prove ourselves to the prince.<eos> We must do this.<eos> Show your hands.<eos> You're up, Snotty.<eos> You know, what if we found a turtle - and sort of nudged it over first?
You okay? Good.<eos> That means we can talk.<eos> Come on, gramps.<eos> Pick up.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Please, everyone, just be patient.<eos> I'm sure he's gonna be here any second.<eos> Granny, do you really need that?<eos> We got a lawless town, Ruby.<eos> Damn right I need it.
A gift. I don't want it.<eos> Can't be a gift.<eos> It was mine to start with.<eos> Before you go... Answer me this...<eos> How did it feel?<eos> I love my mother.<eos> That's not what I asked, dearie.<eos> How did it feel to use magic?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I'll never use it again.
Now I'm going to find your secret and I'm going to take everything from you.<eos> Maybe it's not too late to find Blair and help her with those errands.<eos> Why are you torturing me?<eos> Blair knew your dresses would look better than hers in print.<eos> No. I knew that the two of you were working together to destroy me in "W. W. D. "<eos> We met for the first time today,Blair,when I interviewed her.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> And you and your fake African satellite-selling brain did not find my fabric on its own.<eos> I have done terrible things to the two of you in the past, so you must've wanted revenge.<eos> I did,but I didn't scheme to get it.
Oh, aren't you a doll.<eos> You know...<eos> Eldridge is with his father this week.<eos> Whoo, and Jake's with his mother. Mmm.<eos> So, I guess we can do anything we want.<eos> Yeah, and what do you want, you dirty girl?<eos> Well, you know what would make me really happy?<eos> Whatever it is, I'll do it.<eos> The guest toilet is broken.<eos> I want you to fix it.
Double-blueberry tall stack, extra blueberries.<eos> I didn't order blueberries.<eos> Yeah, but they're in season.<eos> You don't want to miss 'em.<eos> Andrew Botwin and Joanna Jacobs.<eos> LaPlante Industries?<eos> You needed a name.<eos> It was the first thing that popped into my head.<eos> What if I wanted to name our fake company?<eos> What would you have named it?
I'm Andy's wife.<eos> Does she know?<eos> I can't tell. Let me watch her walk.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> She knows.<eos> Maze! to v.<eos> Thanks, yeah.<eos> I made a horrible decision.<eos> We're planning a post-wedding, pre-divorce bachelor party.<eos> Try and squeeze it in on Tuesday.
Your daddy should listen to me, shouldn't he?<eos> - You only like goat milk.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> Hey, would you run to the store, then, Nance?<eos> I would go, but I'm in the middle, here. Yes.<eos> I'll see you in a bit.<eos> Our scripture says how good it is when brothers and sisters can dwell together in harmony.<eos> Today let us come together and worship as these two young people show what they have learned, what they have been, and demonstrate what they mean to our people and to our nation, and let us say, Amen.<eos> My Torah portion is Exodus, and I wrote a whole nice speech about how it's a metaphor for the immigrant experience, but I'm not gonna read that.<eos> I wrote a new speech last night, and I like it better, so that's what I'm gonna read.
Sticks, mace'?<eos> We need a plan.<eos> Okay-<eos> I don't know, that might work.<eos> Probably not, 'cause they could smash the windows.<eos> Their claws are pretty sharp.<eos> Whose claws?<eos> I think I heard him.<eos> No reason to be scared, all the instructors have weapons.<eos> I'm sure Moreh Avi had a weapon, you just didn't see it, like a knife strapped to his leg.
He bought it.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> You know, he must have been a little bit slimmer.<eos> Maybe not a lot of carbs in that dehydrated food.<eos> Danger, danger, Will Robinson!<eos> Danger, danger!<eos> 3369-954421.<eos> Oh, Houston, I have a lift-off.<eos> Sir, your card has been declined.<eos> it says I have to seize it.
Well, I guess it's not time to break out the handcuffs just yet.<eos> Where the hell is that envelope?<eos> Maybe "Traffic" meant something else or we got the wrong painting.<eos> No. No. Lily was too determined to get this one.<eos> And the Phillips in my bedroom has a backing on it.<eos> Then someone took it off.<eos> Then they've got the evidence!<eos> [ Stay by MNDR plays ]<eos> Remember that silver bullet we were looking for?<eos> I found it.
"When you're in the middle of a story, "it isn't a story at all, "but only a confusion,<eos> "a dark roaring, "a blindness, "a wreckage of shattered glass and splintered wood,<eos> "and all aboard are powerless to stop it.<eos> "It's only afterwards that it becomes anything like a story at all. "When you're telling it to yourself or to someone else."
Harry's many lives sometimes feel like the cross-work patches of a harlequin costume. When I first met Harry, he was a film producer and Lies My Father Told Me had won Hollywood's Golden Globe for Best Foreign Film.<eos> The script by Ted Allan was nominated for an Oscar.<eos> Lies My Father Told Me gave the fledgling Canadian film industry artistic and professional credentials.<eos> "Hello, again, Sarah. "I confess our encounter has stayed up<eos> "for most of my consciousness, too. "The emotions are conflicting.<eos> "Joy of discovery, sweet memory obscured by sadness, "and some concern as to how this reasonable, but unproven, assumption "might affect you, as well as your family.<eos> "We really need to take some time out to discuss this.<eos> "Meanwhile, I suspect it would be prudent "not to broadcast this putative discovery.<eos> "In that respect, you would not be following in Diane's footsteps.<eos> "She was apparently very pleased with the idea "and didn't hesitate to share it with some others.
I felt constrained, inhibited, and sort of pinched in my relationship to you because of the private way in which we were dealing with it.<eos> The atmosphere got a little heavy there. We were sort of building misunderstanding on top of misunderstanding, and we both proved to be very, very capable in that respect.<eos> I was upset that this thing had gotten up between us.<eos> My taste or desire to do it at that point, really, was no longer there.<eos> I mean... This is not fun anymore. It's just creating problems.<eos> So, eventually, I dropped it and I backed off.<eos> And what was it about having it published that attracted you?<eos> Well, I think...<eos> I think anyone who writes anything, I mean, anyone who does anything, wants to bring it out to a public.<eos> I mean, if there's a story to be told, and if the story has some validity and some resonance, then you don't keep it to yourself.
"You know...<eos> Look... "While telling me your news on Thursday, you twice hugged me "as hard as you ever did in your childhood.<eos> "That alone "made your revelation worth a thousand words.<eos> "So, there you have it.<eos> "All I know of what happened "or what has been reported to me has been told.<eos> "I think I wrote this story "because it really says so many interesting things "about the human condition.<eos> "But maybe there was another reason.<eos> "Perhaps, deep inside, I have suffered more of a shock "than I would openly admit.<eos> "I sometimes stop and realize "that something inside has, for the rest of my life, changed.<eos> "A certain cord that runs between Sarah and me "has been severed, "and I'm powerless to join it together.
And where have you been all night, young lady?<eos> Jumping around to your hippity-hop?<eos> Taking your drug pills and smoking your hash stick?<eos> I'm actually asking-<eos> - I'm not doing a thing right here.<eos> Those guys are so much fun.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I've been up for 48 hours, so I'm gonna just sleep off an ass-ton of quinoa.<eos> No, there's no time for sleep!<eos> Guys, here's what we got to do.<eos> We got to find the passion that we have in life, and we got to hold on to it.
Okay, you know what? It's fine.<eos> I'll-I'll wash it myself.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you, though.<eos> She's so iconoclastic and modern.<eos> And she even got our dishwasher to work.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - You know, I mean, I just... it wasn't that big a deal.<eos> It was just...<eos> I just... I just turned it on.
Work's the one thing that keeps my mind off the situation.<eos> So tell me, how goes our little experiment?<eos> I'm glad you asked.<eos> What do you make of that man on the bench?<eos> Looks like he tied one on a little too tight.<eos> Bet you'd never believe me if I told you he was a violin prodigy who played two years with the Philharmonic.<eos> His penchant for the bottle cut his career short.<eos> How exactly does this help stop terrorism?<eos> Before I could teach the machine to find bad people, I had to teach it people in general.<eos> I programmed it to identify outliers...
Oh, thank you.<eos> All right, Finch, this guy's a saint. I'm not so sure.<eos> I took a closer look at his employment history.<eos> Hard to see how he had the money to move east, much less, support a city lifestyle.<eos> Maybe he met a reclusive billionaire? In the event that he didn't,<eos> I made a few phone calls around Fort Wayne, claiming to be a genealogist working on a family tree.<eos> And I did uncover one record of interest. And what's that?<eos> His death certificate.<eos> The real Graham Wyler died in 1997.<eos> Whoever you've been following stole his identity and has been using it for the past 15 years.
And we actually spent the rest of the evening running around the city.<eos> Oh, you know, John kind of reminds me of Graham, when we first moved out here, kind of restless.<eos> Don't worry, he'll calm down.<eos> Ooh, another wine cooler?<eos> Uh, what about a Manhattan Up?<eos> How do you make that?<eos> - Come on, I'll show you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Dad, have you seen my necklace?<eos> No, not since I fixed it.
No, sir.<eos> All right, Detective Squad requested we conduct some sweeps so familiarize yourself with these photos of known gang members.<eos> And then pick up as many as you can.<eos> Jaywalking, spitting on the sidewalk?<eos> Full enforcement.<eos> And, uh, there's been a lot said about our stop-and-frisk policy lately, so...<eos> - I don't need to add to it.<eos> - So you're saying we don't have to coddle the criminals for once?<eos> No, I'm saying you all know where the line is.<eos> Don't cross it.
Why would you be looking at my financials?<eos> You don't think I killed Alyson and Johnny, do you?<eos> No, but you were the first person he called after Alyson was killed.<eos> You were the last person he called before the ADTs got him.<eos> I know how close you two are.<eos> You know, I bet you probably got one of those phony NYPD raid jackets, too, don't you?<eos> No, man, it's not like that.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Put the bottle down.<eos> I said, put it down.
For all we know, Johnny's dead, and guess who's going to be dead next, kid.<eos> No, you're gonna protect me.<eos> I mean, you got to put me in witness protection.<eos> Protect you?<eos> Kid, impersonating a police officer, robbery-- those are felonies.<eos> The only place I'm gonna put you is in a prison cell.<eos> That's if the ADTs don't put you in the ground first.<eos> All right, this is weird.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, we flagged Johnny's credit card in case one of the ADTs tried to use it.

That's your husband... learning to lie.<eos> Deputy Secretary of Defense Curry, it's good to talk to you again.<eos> It's Secretary now, Captain.<eos> Well, I'm glad the last 24 hours has been good to someone.<eos> You know, we have a lot of frightened people here.<eos> You have a team of Delta on my island.<eos> I want them gone.<eos> Now.<eos> We got about 1.6 billion muslims deeply pissed at us.<eos> We're trying to de-escalate this situation, not make it worse.
They won't need a nuke if they trap us on this side of the river.<eos> What about that boat that you liberated from a sporting goods store, Jamil?<eos> It was rubber, seats five, no motor.<eos> Best guess, it'd take us 40 minutes, round trip, across the river.<eos> No, that would take way too long to get everybody across.<eos> Plus, we'd have to leave all the vehicles, all the heavy weapons -- wounded, supplies.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not acceptable.<eos> Captain, it seems our best and only option is to rebuild the bridge.<eos> We don't have to rebuild it, Captain.

Wow.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't get your hopes up.<eos> The nightlife is extremely limited.<eos> No. That's not what I meant.<eos> Thank you for...<eos> for what you're doing. For how you're changing.<eos> Okay, 'Stiltskin, I want my ax.<eos> I'm sorry, but we're closed.<eos> It's mine. Give it to me.
And yet, still closed.<eos> Just 'cause you possess something don't mean it's yours.<eos> Nothing in this shop belongs to you.<eos> And you?<eos> How can you be with such a monster?<eos> Or maybe you're just another possession, too.<eos> How... - Aah!<eos> - Dare you? ! You want your ax?<eos> - Uhh! Rumplestiltskin!<eos> You can have it...
Not in this land, no.<eos> But the ships that dock here often return from far off lands with treasures they don't always understand.<eos> - And yet you do.<eos> - It's my job, as is knowing the rumors of who might pay the highest price for said treasures.<eos> And what rumors could they be?<eos> That... you were once a great coward but that you became The Dark One to overcome that and protect a... a son who you lost despite all...<eos> It's not nice to spread rumors.<eos> A bean!<eos> Where... is it?<eos> I don't have it.
I'd love to. - Aah!<eos> - Wait. I have something you want.<eos> Well, I find that very difficult to believe.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> You know who I took it from.<eos> I may not know what The Dark One wants with a magic bean, but I have it.<eos> Oh, I feel a proposal coming on.<eos> The magic bean in exchange for our lives.<eos> Deal?<eos> I wanna see it first.
Speak.<eos> What?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> I'm afraid not, Mr. V. It's called defamation.<eos> You defame our client, Peter Florrick, we're more than ready to sue.<eos> So, what do I need to do?<eos> Don't post.<eos> If you do, - we're gonna sue you for $3 million.<eos> - But it's true.<eos> The story was written, - and they're not gonna print it.
Sorry about that.<eos> - What happened to your face?<eos> - I'll answer that, Nolan.<eos> He had an accident giving his cat a bath.<eos> Yeah, Whiskers can be pretty ferocious when she's been drinking.<eos> Why were you at a women's shelter?<eos> I think it's time to tell them the truth about what really happened to you.<eos> Nolan is a reporter for "Time Magazine"... doing an exposé on what it's like to be a man living in a women's shelter.<eos> Then he walked into a door.<eos> You must be a pretty crappy therapist if you don't know domestic abuse when you see it.
- What the hell is going on, man?<eos> You show up with that thing on your arm.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> - If you're supposed to die at the hands of somebody with this tattoo, I need to be on the approved list.<eos> - Nathan, I am not the enemy.<eos> - Your father, your grandfather, his father before that, they all killed Troubled people to wipe out their curses.<eos> You don't think any of them had any doubts?<eos> You just think you're special?<eos> - I'm gonna go with special.<eos> Nathan... Whoever took Audrey, they planted that whistle in her apartment, so you would find it and come after me.
I love the sun.<eos> So we can see.<eos> Oh, you couldn't be in Cannes in the summer. No one could bear it.<eos> I could.<eos> - Just how long is she here for?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> No guest should be admitted without the date of their departure settled.<eos> - You won't get any argument from me. - Hmm.<eos> There's a hideous pile of post, I'm afraid.<eos> I've put it on the hall table.

Ask me what?<eos> I'm sorry to keep you waiting, ladies.<eos> - The fact is, it's not quite as simple.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Mrs Patmore, will you please leave the hysteria to me?<eos> I'm afraid the test was inconclusive.<eos> I had hoped that the fluid from the cyst would be clear, but there are traces of blood in it.<eos> Not enough to confirm the presence of cancer, but a little too much to exclude it.<eos> - So what happens now?<eos> - I send it away for analysis.
Why are you still here?<eos> Why do you think I'm still here?<eos> I guess because I'm in love with you.<eos> Why else would I be seeing your face everywhere I look?<eos> Because you feel bad.<eos> Of course I feel bad.<eos> I told you I love you, which is apparently the worst thing you can say to someone.<eos> That's not why you feel bad.<eos> You feel bad because after you said it, you let me go away.<eos> I know our relationship isn't exactly what you want it to be, and I know I may not love you the way you love me, but I do love you.
Kids, sometimes the universe sends exactly what you ask for.<eos> Other times, it sends Lily's dad.<eos> Remember the time you had your tonsils out?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> You scared the crap out of me.<eos> Yes, I did, didn't I?<eos> Oh, my.<eos> But do you remember what happened next?<eos> And don't worry, Princess, if you permanently lose the ability to speak, we'll give you a chalkboard.<eos> You can hang it around your neck on a little string.
May I join you for coffee?<eos> I'll fetch a cup.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Well, it's okay.<eos> Though we might be better off using an actor.<eos> I'll call your publisher and hear hat he thinks.<eos> But I think it's charming to hear you read it yourself.<eos> So we'll see.<eos> We'll get you that kitchen ventilator.<eos> We'll get it tomorrow.

Now, don't puss out on me, Cooper!<eos> Check it out.<eos> His arm has been ripped off.<eos> What the hell could have done that?<eos> I have today's mail.<eos> There's a storm coming, Sister Jude.<eos> Oh. Where did this come from?<eos> The mailbox.<eos> No, you ninny.<eos> I mean, who brought it here?
For the funeral of Oscar Diebold, a CIA agent and cold war hero ♪♪ who died yesterday at his home in queens.<eos> Diebold was recruited by the CIA ♪♪ and became one of the agency's most respected operatives.<eos> CIA director... oh, my God.<eos> And federal judge Lawrence Wilkins says... oh, my God.<eos> Gavin, I need to talk to you!<eos> Late for an appointment, Annie.<eos> Great piece this morning.<eos> But that story I wrote, it isn't true.<eos> Well, of course it is.<eos> I read it in the paper.
Then isn't it about time you tell me?<eos> You're going to the doctor.<eos> I told you, I'm not going to a doctor till you tell me why you're acting so crazy.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> Yeah, the truth would be nice.<eos> Get your coat.<eos> I told you, I'm not going to a doctor.<eos> I know.<eos> You want the truth, you're going to get it.
- When? Checked in this morning.<eos> Paid for three days, cash.<eos> What room is he in?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Hey. Hey, stay where you are.<eos> Robinson, stop her!<eos> Ma'am, stop now.<eos> Hold up.<eos> What else did she tell you about this cat?<eos> Anything? Just that Adalind brought it in, and it scratched her.
- Is she okay?<eos> - I don't know yet.<eos> But I can meet you at your place.<eos> No, you stay.<eos> You take care of yours.<eos> All right.<eos> Then call for backup. Don't worry.<eos> I will.<eos> You sure this is going to knock that feline out?<eos> It won't knock it out, it will paralyze it for about 30 minutes.
A service paid by generations of Greek taxpayers.<eos> There was a time in Greece when private debts were nationalised but today there is an effort to privatize the profit that the citizens could enjoy through public services.<eos> What did private companies invest in this sector in order to buy it at a price much lower than its value?<eos> If the railways are like a book on economic history, the water network teaches us how to manage a monopoly.<eos> In this sector, its Paris' turn to pay the bill of privatization.<eos> Water is the outstanding example of a monopoly.<eos> No water company in the world operates on a competitive basis.<eos> There's only ever one network, it's not worth ever investing in to competing networks.<eos> Two multinational companies of great financial and political power, Veolia and Suez, claim administration of the water network in Paris.<eos> And Jacques Chirac offers it to them.
You had a maid at Downton, Ethel Parks.<eos> I was here when she brought her son into the dining room.<eos> - Who could forget that?<eos> - Do you have an address for her?<eos> I do, if she's still there.<eos> You see...<eos> You see, I saw her this morning and I'm afraid she's fallen into a bad way.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> I am sorry to hear that.<eos> If you'd like to come with me, I'll fetch it for you.
She commended you to my care. "<eos> - I can't listen to any more of this.<eos> - You must. "I have few intimates so have added you to my list of heirs.<eos> It's unlikely I'll outlive the first two so there's little chance of you reading this.<eos> If you do and the money has come to you, know it is with my full knowledge of what transpired.<eos> Do not allow grief, guilt or regret to hold you back in its employment.<eos> God bless you, my boy. Reggie. "<eos> - Are you sure you didn't write it?<eos> - I assume you know his hand.<eos> Not well enough to test a fortune in it.
I thought I'd ring up Dr Clarkson after we've eaten.<eos> Yes, I've been talking to Lord Grantham about the good doctor.<eos> Sir Philip feels the room would be too crowded.<eos> It might be better to leave old Clarkson out of it for the time being.<eos> But I said I'd telephone.<eos> Well, it really isn't necessary.<eos> I've given him my word.<eos> Why don't I run down in the car after dinner and fetch him?<eos> The hollandaise for the fish.<eos> Put it in the sauce boats for Alfred.
How could I?<eos> I didn't work at the house until this year.<eos> I could hardly play for the village team.<eos> We'll have to start a fan club, won't we?<eos> That's kind, Ivy, but I just want to do my best for the house.<eos> That's all the reward I seek.<eos> Your modesty is an example to us all, Mr Molesley.<eos> What is that you're so glued to?<eos> This week's column.<eos> I've got to send it off tomorrow.
Are you without sin, Alfred?<eos> For I am certainly not.<eos> Sorry about your son, Mr Molesley.<eos> Don't be.<eos> He talks such a lovely game.<eos> He could always talk a good game of cricket.<eos> He just couldn't play it.<eos> Just as I thought.<eos> There's been a mix-up.<eos> Alfred here witnessed some rough-housing between two of the staff and misinterpreted it.
Okay. Hello?<eos> Hello, Paco.<eos> Get on your feet.<eos> I said get up. Now listen to me,<eos> I don't care what you're doing here.<eos> I don't even care what you got on you.<eos> I care about a shooting you were involved in two years ago. What happened to the gun?<eos> I don't got that gun.<eos> I said what happened to it? A cop took it, man.<eos> A cop took it?
I still have a month.<eos> You don't want me to go, either?<eos> I think you should take good care of yourself, milady. That's all.<eos> I agree. Right, let's get started.<eos> I told Mama we'd be on the platform at quarter to, and we're late.<eos> Feels like a holiday, doesn't it?<eos> Oh, don't worry.<eos> It won't feel like a holiday once we get there.<eos> Let me just retrieve the briefcase.<eos> They might need it for the journey.
Really?<eos> Where from?<eos> You're not very curious, are you<eos> And you're not one of our regulars.<eos> Well, if you must know, I've taken over from Mr Cox in Thirsk.<eos> Mr Patmore sent an order in to him.<eos> What's this?<eos> Do I hear my name taken in vain?<eos> I was just explaining. You sent an order in to Mr Cox.<eos> I've bought the shop and all the stock, so I took the liberty of filling it out.

He won't mind.<eos> Come on.<eos> Mr Gregson!<eos> This is very kind of you, Lady Flintshire.<eos> Not a bit. It's a pleasure to welcome a friend of dear Edith's.<eos> What a disappointment.<eos> He looks perfectly normal. Since he came with the express purpose of dining at Duneagle, he obviously bought a set of tails.<eos> Come and meet my parents.<eos> Mama, Granny, Papa, this is Mr Gregson.<eos> Lady Grantham. You know, I started to read your magazine because of Edith's column, but now I wouldn't miss it.
This infernal machine!<eos> I appreciate your spending your Sunday fixing it.
Whose schedule would that be?<eos> Yours, Mr. Bohannon.<eos> It was on your advice that we decided to bridge the gorge at this point.<eos> Yes, sir. And we made good time, considering.<eos> Considering what, Mr. Bohannon?<eos> Indians. Strike. Wash-out.<eos> All I need is a structure that will support a locomotive from one side of the gorge to the other.<eos> Understand?<eos> I'll, um...<eos> I'll drive it across the bridge myself.
Remember you were asking how you can help Brody, raise his profile?<eos> I met a young man yesterday.<eos> 23 years old, lost both his arms in Iraq.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> He's part of a group of wounded veterans.<eos> No one wants to see this stuff.<eos> They have trouble getting press.<eos> You, on the other hand, everyone wants to see.<eos> Anyway, they have a fund-raiser coming up, and I, I thought that we could host it together.
Suit yourself.<eos> We'll be there in 30 or 40 minutes, and you'll be somebody else's problem.<eos> Bassel.<eos> My name is Bassel.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Oh, you gotta be shitting me.<eos> There's no fucking jack.<eos> So once the table staff's done, we can do a final light and sound check, and did you bring Nick's speech, for the teleprompter team?<eos> Oh, I didn't even think of that.<eos> Um, he has it with him.

Look at this.<eos> Back in the lab, it went to black.<eos> - It was the end of the tape.<eos> - We're ready. And now there's more footage.<eos> Well, how is that possible?<eos> You are now in the pocket universe.<eos> Don't be alarmed.<eos> You will notice that things work differently here.<eos> You'll see a door.<eos> Go through it.
They must have gotten this out of my mind.<eos> Windmark!<eos> He must have found the boy!<eos> Everything we've done is for nothing!<eos> It's for nothing.<eos> Walter?<eos> Search parameters remain the same.<eos> Building to building... Door to door.<eos> Come with me. There you are.<eos> If the Observers had known about this pocket, they would have shut it down a long time ago.
Watch the finger. Are you, uh...<eos> Yeah, I'm watching.<eos> Actually, okay,<eos> I'm gonna get you to close your eyes.<eos> Now?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> Close your eyes. Yes.<eos> My eyes are now closed.<eos> Now I want you to just let your mind wander.<eos> Let it wander wherever it wants to go.
You've seen him writing?<eos> It's hard for him to go back and forth.<eos> This is the perfect spot.<eos> No, don't, don't!<eos> He hates it when things are out of place. He doesn't like changes.<eos> What's the use of wasting this pretty chest?<eos> It's been there since before you were born.<eos> It's older than you!<eos> So what if it's older than me?<eos> Help me move it.
Because you care for me...<eos> You came back because you care for me.<eos> I'm lonely, too.<eos> That's why.<eos> Who fiddled with the engine?<eos> The handle has no control.<eos> You are lucky to be alive!<eos> Is it because the car is old?<eos> No...<eos> Someone loosened it.
Okay, you are smart.<eos> - All right, I'm gonna go ahead and print out the 911 activity log for...<eos> - What was that?<eos> (sighing) - It was a power surge.<eos> The server's down.<eos> - Wham?<eos> C'mon, don't tell me you think my magic Trouble put your system to sleep.<eos> - Or you did it on purpose, 'cause now I can't look up fingerprints or anything else that would tell me who you are.<eos> - I'm not hiding my identity.<eos> I just don't know it.
What if there's a fire?<eos> Dave can't be dangerous enough to keep locked in a trunk. Let him out.<eos> Oh, maybe you're right.<eos> Sorry, Dave.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Thanks. My skiff was abandoned at South Down Docks.<eos> James and Arla left it.<eos> Waiter didn't see a car, doesn't know where they went.<eos> He said James was really sick, that he's getting worse and worse.<eos> If the barn kept him alive, maybe he can't leave it.
The map said it was east, but...<eos> We're good!<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> Saving your life.<eos> Go.<eos> Just go.<eos> - You're doing this, Lynette.<eos> - That's just not possible.<eos> Look at the mural.<eos> You see it every day.
Should I have told you?<eos> Things would have been so much better with my sister.<eos> Parker, where's Tommy?<eos> I made the Grady connection with Tommy's GPS history.<eos> There's a lot of addresses in here.<eos> It's gonna take all night to cover them all.<eos> Then we better get going.<eos> Always liked this place.<eos> So many memories.<eos> Now I got to burn it down.
Do you know how much the best trader earned, last year?<eos> 4.5 billion.<eos> 4.5 billion.<eos> Money had never been made so fast.<eos> I'm a metal-worker.<eos> The last of the metal-workers?<eos> I thought I'd try Steelbox, are they recruiting?<eos> I hear they have an excellent works council.<eos> We've been dealing with Steelbox for six months, but not in recruitment, the company's collapsing.<eos> And the new management won't put it back on track.
It's not too late, you know.<eos> You don't want to make a bad situation worse.<eos> Get up and keep on digging, and shut up!<eos> I'm doing everything you ask.<eos> Drop your weapon, Benjamin!<eos> Nobody make a move!<eos> I'll kill him!<eos> Right here, right now!<eos> You hear me?<eos> Benjamin, drop it!
And these hits just keep...<eos> Coming and coming. Coming and coming.<eos> And y'all are about to get going and going and going!<eos> I'm finding this 243% less hilarious than the two of y'all!<eos> Where are you getting them numbers from, man?<eos> Why are you always wearing all red? You look like a big-ass Slim Jim.<eos> Please, take a card -- any card. Is this a trick?<eos> My milieu is the impossible, the unbelievable, the unfathomable.<eos> Now, please, all I ask is that you take a card and you sign it.<eos> Right, now, look at the card, and without showing it to me, you're going to rip it up into pieces and you're going to feed it to me. I'm gonna feed it to you? Yes, please.
You're in love with Denise.<eos> Just... hear me out.<eos> Most people with narcissistic personality disorder... they can't express their feelings because they don't know how.<eos> They're always the ones getting the love.<eos> Like you.<eos> But you never learned to give it, and that's why I think... at the center of all this chaos is a broken heart.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I lost her, didn't I?<eos> I lost love.<eos> That doesn't mean that you can't have it again... with someone else.
No, thank you.<eos> I would very much like to see your victim.<eos> And I have a lot of work to do upstairs.<eos> So I'm gonna go.<eos> Ma.<eos> Do you have your EpiPen?<eos> And I came up with this rehydration technique because we were so desperate to identify the bodies.<eos> - After the genocide in Sarajevo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And then we had to use it again to identify entire Kurdish families slaughtered by Saddam Hussein.
Does the DNA belong to Tom MacGregor?<eos> How did you know?<eos> Because I'm amazing too.<eos> - What's up, Jane?<eos> - Hey, Korsak.<eos> You see a suit of armor anywhere in that house?<eos> I do.<eos> At the top of the stairs.<eos> All right, I'm getting you a warrant.<eos> Bring it back.
- Okay, sir.<eos> And I don't ever want to find myself chatting with you again.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Is that clear?<eos> You'll have it by tomorrow morning.<eos> That Rothstein, warm as a lizard.<eos> What did he say?<eos> That he's expecting his delivery.<eos> And what did you tell him?<eos> That it's coming.
Thanks for letting me take you to dinner.<eos> Well, thank you for letting me choose Indian.<eos> You know, I read this article by a film critic once, who said if he could have one wish, it would be to watch his favorite movie again for the first time.<eos> I kind of wish that was us.<eos> So you want dinner and a movie. No.<eos> I wish we had just met and that all this was just beginning and there wasn't so much of me I wish you'd forget.<eos> Well, keep saying nice things like that and maybe next time I'll let you choose the restaurant.<eos> Mr. Merlyn... Yeah?<eos> I'm sorry, I'm afraid you credit card has been declined.<eos> Did you swipe it a few times?

Is something wrong?<eos> Hey, what time is it, Pierce?<eos> Wellum, I'm not wearing my watch.<eos> You know where it is?<eos> It's probably upstairs in my room.<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> - What?<eos> - This it?<eos> Yeah, how... how'd you get it?<eos> How'd you lose it?
- Apparently...<eos> Man, this is wild.<eos> "After sailing around the islands for two days, "we finally disembarked "and found a gentle race in residence.<eos> "The most amazing thing about this shy, reclusive group... "they were not afraid, having never seen a Grimm.<eos> "I found them to be intelligent, compassionate "and thoroughly nonviolent, which made the dispatching of them quite easy."<eos> Really?<eos> So your people killed innocent genio-whatever-they're-called?<eos> - Different times.<eos> So, if Pierce is incapable of killing, how'd his watch get there?<eos> Well, maybe somebody planted it there.

That's the good news? Pretty much, I'm afraid.<eos> The emotional component is much more complicated, and without knowing more about you and the person you're in love with, it's nearly impossible to diagnose.<eos> It requires a dual treatment.<eos> So, unless you're willing to bring in the woman or man or whatever for consultation... that's impossible.<eos> So what you're telling me... Is it's hopeless.<eos> Well, love so often is.<eos> Are you sure there's really no way to track down the object of your affliction?<eos> It's a shame, because a condition such as yours left untreated could be downright dangerous.<eos> - The symptoms are only gonna get worse...<eos> you won't be able to control it.
Is Rosalee here?<eos> She's, uh...<eos> Rosalee is supposed to be here.<eos> She's gonna mix some medicine.<eos> I really need it.<eos> I...<eos> I'm having a really hard time getting around here.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm just taking over for Rosalee while she's out of town, okay? Not to worry.<eos> I know all about your order, and we'll have it ready for you in just a moment.
Whoever this guy is, he covered his tracks.<eos> Look, we put out alerts for Maddox.<eos> We circulated his photo all over the state.<eos> Someone will spot him.<eos> Well, we can't wait for that.<eos> Did you get anything?<eos> Well, there is one thing, but it's a long shot.<eos> The guy used voice-over-Internet instead of normal cell service, but he made a call in a bad signal area that got routed through a wireless network.<eos> Well, if it's a network, it'll have an I.P. address.<eos> Yeah, and we traced it.
Whoever it is you think I am, whatever it is you think you know about me, you have no idea what I'm capable of or how far I will go.<eos> I am done being afraid.<eos> It's your turn now.<eos> That's gonna leave a nasty scar.<eos> Every time you see it, think of me.<eos> Kate, tell me you didn't...<eos> We reached an understanding.<eos> What about your mom?<eos> I'll get justice for her. Just not today.<eos> Until then, I'll get it for others.
You're what?<eos> I'm going to have a baby.<eos> Wow.<eos> What?<eos> You're not happy?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> It's just a lot to take in.<eos> And I'll be honest, this isn't coming at a great time for me, with everything I've got going on.<eos> This is not your responsibility.<eos> Neither is our wooden salad bowl, but I'm the only one who oils it. Without me, that thing would soak up dressing like a sponge.
They were afraid they might have bedbugs.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> They rejected our donation?<eos> I was so offended, I almost didn't buy this fiestaware creamer.<eos> 2 bucks.<eos> Didn't know what they had.<eos> Ah!<eos> Score.<eos> So what are we gonna do now?<eos> Get a kitten and then name it Larry.
By the time I'm in my chair.<eos> I should probably go.<eos> No, I--<eos> I got your message.<eos> Yes!<eos> ♪ See the money, wanna stay for your meal ♪ ♪ get another piece of pie for your wife ♪<eos> ♪ everybody wanna know how it feel ♪<eos> ♪ everybody wanna see what it's like ♪ ♪ living in a beehive of your mind ♪<eos> We're taking the offensive.<eos> Good, give me a gun and tell me where to point it.
And may I say that your cooperation is warmly appreciated.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Show me what you got.<eos> What we've got, Mr. Flynn, is a mistake.<eos> My partners and I, we set out to invent a... a device that generates clean, low-cost electricity.<eos> We failed completely.<eos> It doesn't work.<eos> In fact, it does exactly the opposite of what we intended.<eos> Instead of generating electricity, it inhibits it.
It's okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, what are you...<eos> Give me that back!<eos> I don't like you.<eos> The feeling is so mutual, kid.<eos> Hey, Aaron.<eos> What's that?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's my necklace, kid tried to steal it.
Blair, I just got invited to the Institute of Arts and Letters' summer artists retreat.<eos> That's incredible!<eos> But what could possibly be the problem, besides Rome in August?<eos> I need your photographic memory and your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.<eos> My computer's gone.<eos> It's Gossip Girl.<eos> She took it.<eos> After we got the address for tonight, I gave it to Gossip Girl.
Focusing on work has made it easier to be away from you.<eos> If I had known it would be this difficult going our separate ways, I would never have agreed.<eos> Well, we had to come to some kind of an agreement or we never would've left that hotel room in Monte Carlo.<eos> And... We have much to do.<eos> But like I said in the casino, I'm all in.<eos> My bet's on us.<eos> Lily.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I thought you and Bart were circling the globe in an 80-foot yacht.<eos> Well, the yacht was 110 feet, and most people who've actually been on one call it a boat.
Nate, you have to convince her.<eos> Haven't you ever seen a Hitchcock movie or watched "Dateline"?<eos> There's only so many ways this goes-- kidnap/ransom, torture/murder, or brainwash/cult.<eos> Okay, Blair, we get it.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> We both know that Serena is quite capable of hurting herself.<eos> But... This time, I'm afraid I hurt her, too.<eos> There is one more thing I can try.<eos> Anything, please.<eos> If you have a card, now's the time to play it.
I'm not a kid.<eos> You're not married.<eos> Why are you still here?<eos> You didn't think I was leaving without you?<eos> Or... without saying I'm sorry.<eos> Because I am, Serena.<eos> Thinking that I really lost you made me regret every horrible thing I've ever said to you.<eos> Well, that's a lot of regret.<eos> However complicated our friendship got,<eos> I shouldn't have let it go.
Mr. Durant has offered me a permanent place with the railroad.<eos> He, uh...<eos> He offered me a partnership.<eos> Then it must be your job he's offering me.<eos> It's one of our horses.<eos> It's too dangerous for you to be out here now.<eos> I've been thinking about what you said.<eos> About all you have is your job... and me.<eos> All I have is this railroad and you.<eos> We can build it together.
- Everyone relax. Don't resist.<eos> This will get straightened out when you see a judge. Homeowner:<eos> I'm just trying to take care of my family.<eos> After hours of seemingly unending violence, the toll of injury and destruction is growing.<eos> With fires burning and rampant looting in a number of areas, the city is under siege.<eos> Did you think for a moment that you had transcendent purpose or that somehow you were worthy of being remembered?<eos> A sanitation clerk who had the audacity to fuck the mayor's daughter.<eos> How dare you think that you should ever have been put in the position to decide the fate of others?<eos> That is a mantle to be worn only by the great, not by a man who wormed his way into City Hall for a period of time.<eos> You're a chapter, a portrait, a handful of legislation, a thousand lies, and yet you cling to power, falsely believing you actually possess it.
Th-this man has just planted a bead on me.<eos> Uh, let's be clear.<eos> I have not touched you.<eos> Everybody in this room has seen that.<eos> But you're saying that there is in fact a red glass bead in your pocket. Is that what you're saying?<eos> No!<eos> You're putting words in my mouth.<eos> Show us what's in your pockets, Agent.<eos> You don't understand-- Show us!<eos> He planted it.
So the other robbers-- they were work for hire?<eos> Exactly.<eos> They do one job and then they disappear.<eos> But if we can find this guy, we find them all.<eos> He's the key.<eos> Do you remember anything about the men who did this?<eos> No.<eos> Not a thing.<eos> You know Ernie and I were up for the same promotion?<eos> I was mad when I didn't get it.
That could've been me in there.<eos> Ernie was a good man.<eos> He didn't deserve this.<eos> What were you doing during the robbery?<eos> What they told me to.<eos> I am not trying to get shot over this job.<eos> Ernie must've done something wrong. Poor fool.<eos> And that's when the robbers ordered you to the ground?<eos> He stuck a gun right in my face.<eos> I was gonna grab it and take those guys down, but I just had back surgery, so I didn't want to risk the loss of innocent lives.
So I hid.<eos> And I waited for the robbers to leave.<eos> Five, six... Then went into the cash vault.<eos> Ernie never suspected a thing.<eos> I'm keeping the ring.<eos> What are you--<eos> You should've seen the look on his face.<eos> It was perfect, except for one thing.<eos> I left the safe deposit door open.<eos> When I tried to go back and close it, it was too late.
Look, remember my former intern Ryan?<eos> Blond, stacked and the cause of many sleepless nights? Well, she needed some extra dough, so she stole the hand and auctioned it online.<eos> That's why I fired her.<eos> Who won the auction?<eos> Don't know.<eos> I put Louis on the case to find out.<eos> Louis?<eos> Not even with all his digital skills, he couldn't dig up a name.<eos> At least he was able to erase the electronic trail.<eos> Did Louis find the hand and keep it?
We'll need a safe house since Crowley's been to the cabin.<eos> Safe house?<eos> I thought we were going to get the tablet.<eos> We are.<eos> You're taking a trip to a demon-free zone.<eos> And risk letting Kevin fall into the hands of this Crowley again?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - Ms. Tran, all due respect, Dean's right.<eos> Crowley, he's not just a killer, he trades in torment.<eos> If he can find a way to separate your soul from you he'll take that soul to hell and roast it till there's nothing left but black smoke.
- Oh, no, no.<eos> The last time that angels tried to help my son I watched them die and Kevin went missing for a year.<eos> So no offense but I'm gonna take my chances with them.<eos> Mm.<eos> Mjolnir, I've missed you.<eos> Where's the kid?<eos> [SNAPS FINGERS]<eos> - What are you gonna do with her soul?<eos> - Whatever I want.<eos> I might sell it or maybe I'll just tuck it away with my other precious objects.
Furniture falling over? Someone running down the stairs?<eos> - No. - No?<eos> Are you sure?<eos> It's alright, okay?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Did she sleep in this room that night?<eos> Yes.<eos> Where's the mattress?<eos> Why isn't there a mattress on the sofa bed?<eos> I took it off.
Yes.<eos> Where's the mattress?<eos> Why isn't there a mattress on the sofa bed?<eos> I took it off.<eos> Why?<eos> Where is it now?<eos> - I threw it in a skip. - Where?<eos> By the road, under a bridge.<eos> Christophe. By the road, under a bridge. A mattress.<eos> Why did you throw it away?
Are you sure you don't recognize her?<eos> I am sure, but...<eos> I don't check in everyone.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Mr. Gold was staying in the room next to Mr. Florrick, but the door between them was open, and I just wanted to see if he had an unobstructed view of the bedroom.<eos> Actually... the connecting door wasn't open.<eos> It wasn't?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean our staff has to open the door connecting the rooms, and there was no request.<eos> Can't the occupants open it on their own?
Used like that, it's mighty offensive, isn't it?<eos> Which fraternity did you belong to?<eos> Omega Delta Omega.<eos> The black fraternity, right? Yes.<eos> Would you say the kids in your fraternity are light-skinned like you or dark-skinned like Tre?<eos> Your Honor, objection.<eos> What hate crime is the defense selling today?<eos> Black-on-black.<eos> Wow, they're just relentless.<eos> He has a theory of the case and he's looking for the facts to satisfy it.
What's that, winning?<eos> No. Nothing to lose.<eos> Welcome to the lifeboat.<eos> Okay, you hand them the T-shirts, you give them the tickets, you walk them to the ballot.<eos> Do not take anyone for granted.<eos> Eli, it's Mandy.<eos> You walk them all the way.<eos> Okay, spread out.<eos> Two months I worked on that story, Eli.<eos> You managed to kill it with one conversation. Nice work.
- continue searching for our missing people!<eos> - We shouldn't even be here!<eos> Report to the boat.<eos> I gave you an order.<eos> Follow it. So throw me in the brig.<eos> They can't do this without us.<eos> Ask the COB, without us, they have to surrender, and we all go home.<eos> Here.<eos> Here's your uniform.<eos> Take it.
- Hello?<eos> ...and decisively. A nuclear response was the only one that guaranteed American safe--<eos> Yes. I'm watching.<eos> It's terrifying.<eos> Why?<eos> Yes.<eos> I know it. Okay.<eos> I have to meet someone.<eos> Now?<eos> If you're so worried about that hard drive, - you should put it in a safe deposit box.
No.<eos> No, look, we got enough.<eos> I'm calling it. Pfft.<eos> To pay for four years of college?<eos> Not all in one night and from the same house, man. Who leaves a baseball signed by babe Ruth out in the open?<eos> A guy who can afford another one.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - Okay, now we call it. Come on.<eos> Can't sleep?<eos> Whoever said warm milk does the trick obviously never tasted it.
Did I forget something?<eos> Hey, Franco.<eos> You seen Ryan?<eos> - The intern?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, I saw him about five minutes ago.<eos> He was trying to catch up with that guy you were just talking to.<eos> - Who, Bud?<eos> - I guess so.<eos> I don't know his name.<eos> We need his address. We have it in his personnel file.
Yeah, well, I guess not.<eos> I swear to God, if I have to listen to another minute of Kuma War, I am going to kill someone.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Dana.<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Could someone please tell me that?<eos> - Yeah, you told me something that did not make any sense.<eos> I got more milk.<eos> They actually let you leave?<eos> Major Mendez got it for me.
You were a student and then a reporter, but you were never a soldier.<eos> You've never been there, at ground zero, when the bomb goes off, knowing all that death is on you.<eos> The naval base attack would have been the first time.<eos> 300 men and women coming home.<eos> Their families waiting for them.<eos> Their children.<eos> All just... blown to pieces.<eos> But it didn't happen.<eos> And now you have a second chance.<eos> Take it.
That you know are wrong but you can't help yourself?<eos> Do you have anyone like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well...<eos> I've never been that stupid.<eos> You idiot whore, you think you understand me?<eos> Or what my family, have lost and suffered? !<eos> You think this is just some fucking game?<eos> Nazir's not afraid of you, I'm not.<eos> I don't need your help, I don't want it.
And when Phillip told me...<eos> I wanted to reach out to you so much, but I was afraid that I would jeopardize your safety.<eos> I know.<eos> But now we have no choice.<eos> We need your help, Nina.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything.<eos> Well, despite the damage to the building, we still think that the underground storage is intact.<eos> We just can't get to it.<eos> I was hoping you would have access to technology that could... change the atomic structure of the rubble, and help us clear it.
Well, here's the thing, Jake.<eos> Hang on, Dad!<eos> There's a thing!<eos> What's the thing?<eos> I sort of have a boyfriend.<eos> A boyfriend?<eos> Well, technically we broke up because I was tired of him always putting his career ahead of me.<eos> He's a doctor.<eos> Well, not a real doctor, a glass doctor.<eos> You know, like if you get a crack in your windshield, he will come right to your driveway and fix it in less than half an hour, guaranteed.
You know, there was a time...<eos> Wasn't too long ago...<eos> You were a young turk out there, gonna change the world.<eos> And as I recall, you had both your hands in our pockets.<eos> Which is why I took this meeting, but given my stance against the gaming ordinance, I didn't think you'd be backing my campaign.<eos> Perhaps we can change your mind.<eos> Before Moretti disappeared, he tried everything to get my support... Begged, bribed.<eos> Bugged the crap out of me.<eos> If I didn't change my vote for him,<eos> I'm certainly not gonna change it for you.
That's exactly what the doctor at the hospital said.<eos> I've lost a few old pals to that one.<eos> A real nightmare.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He thinks he knows me, which is a start.<eos> So I went down to the hospital to see what I could do, and guess what.<eos> He's dumped back out on the street? Yeah!<eos> Isn't there some legal requirement for...<eos> Kendra's Law.<eos> It allows for mandated treatment, but it doesn't require it.
When the kids were little and Mary was swamped the way mothers get, you know, so the husband comes dead last,<eos> I was at a police convention in Chicago, staying at the Drake Hotel.<eos> Frank, stop.<eos> You're very good at having an anecdote at hand that puts you directly in the other guy's shoes, and most of them are true, but some of them are total BS, like this one.<eos> The real question is:<eos> Can you trust someone who got played as badly as I did to still be in your inner circle?<eos> Didn't see that one coming.<eos> Piece of advice?<eos> Mrs. Moore gave you a free pass.<eos> You cashed it in.
That's a cry for help if I've ever seen one.<eos> I don't know what hurts worse, this or getting shot with a curare-laced bullet.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> Definitely the bullet.<eos> You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this, but...<eos> I don't think love is about changing or saving a person.<eos> I think it's about finding the person who's already the right fit.<eos> One day you will.<eos> I think I burnt that particular bridge.<eos> Napalmed it, actually.
All right?<eos> I am a grown ass man.<eos> She's a grown woman.<eos> Yeah, but she's...<eos> She's what, April Kepner?<eos> Believe me, she is grown.<eos> I didn't manipulate her.<eos> I didn't defile her or trick her.<eos> I didn't take her virginity.<eos> She... she gave it to me.
Everybody's moving on.<eos> And I'm here, doing appys and choles, 'cause what a general surgery attending does, appys and choles.<eos> While everybody else is off conquering new things, I'm stuck.<eos> And I didn't care.<eos> You know, I mean, this was my choice.<eos> I'm not even sure I noticed... Until Tuck let go of your hand.<eos> Till Tuck let go of my hand.<eos> You know what happens when someone lets go of your hand?<eos> What?<eos> You get it back.
You should at least listen to her.<eos> Look, I swear, you gotta stop encouraging her.<eos> Well, this is what you taught me to do.<eos> You taught me to not give up until we've tried everything.<eos> Because you can handle it.<eos> When we lose a patient, I know if you're okay or you're not because I'm right there with you.<eos> With her, I cannot do that, because I don't think she can handle it.<eos> Not now.<eos> You are the one who is too emotionally involved.<eos> Okay, if this tumor had come to you from any other doctor, you would still be looking at it.
Respectfully, doctors,<eos> I told you so.<eos> Okay, so I think it'll work.<eos> If we cut down the macerated part of the finger, it'll be short, but it'll still be salvageable.<eos> Okay, but this thumb, I'm gonna go ahead and say that's not salvageable.<eos> Yeah, you're done here.<eos> He'll be better off with a prosthetic.<eos> No.<eos> The thumb is responsible for 40% of hand function.<eos> Without it, we're done.
I'm saying I'll help you.<eos> You're not a freak.<eos> And we can be friends.<eos> Every morning, five days a week, you are in my office at 4:00 A.M.<eos> and we work, Grey.<eos> If you don't show up, if you are late, I will kick your ass.<eos> We work, Grey.<eos> We work.<eos> And you're gonna pass this test.<eos> You're gonna pass it hard.
It's nosier than usual around here.<eos> Oh, gosh!<eos> Tad, this wine is fantastic.<eos> Spend a week in Mendoza, and you'll find a dozen or so malbec producers that'll give most Bordeaux a real run for their money.<eos> - Mm. - I'm sorry. This should come with a warning--<eos> "may cause pretentiousness."<eos> You should come with a warning-- "may be fascinating."<eos> - Oh, that's, like, the ninth time this screw has popped out.<eos> Oh, you know what? I need the angled screwdriver. - I left it at the office.<eos> I, um, I keep it there because of--of all my signs.
After a painstaking investigat-- after a thorough investigation--<eos> Try rigorous.<eos> I'm confident we found the actual shooter.<eos> - So, where's this happening?<eos> - Out front.<eos> After a rigorous investigation, my office has identified a person of interest--<eos> A few weeks ago, Ben Zajac was this close to dropping out of the race.<eos> While I appreciate the outcome, we both know your sacrifice was not without pleasure.<eos> The attempted assassination of a mayor is a rare thing.<eos> Solving it provides me with public recognition I seldom have the chance to enjoy.
Either your water just broke, or you pee like a smurf.<eos> My shoes.<eos> No, you did not flush a whole roll of paper towels.<eos> No, you did not just use that tone with me when my good shoes are wet.<eos> Shut off the valve.<eos> The valve?<eos> Oh, God, what is wrong with you?<eos> How can you not know where a toilet valve is?<eos> I was rich.<eos> But you have to admit, the mirror? Nailed it.
Hey, don't eat the whole thing! Give it back!<eos> This driver of ours probably doesn't live in public housing...<eos> Might be good to drive by there, too.<eos> Wouldn't you like something warmer to wear?<eos> I fell down.<eos> You're not having any?<eos> I've got something to take care of.<eos> I won't be away long. Get yourself warm.<eos> Where's the sugar?<eos> Nobody uses it here.
"An 8.2 magnitude earthquake devastates Pasadena,<eos> "reducing mighty edifices to dust,<eos> "engulfing the city in flames.<eos> "The streets flow with blood and echo with the cries of the wounded."<eos> Oh, excellent choice.<eos> Now, put on your hardhat and safety vest.<eos> Oh, fun.<eos> I get to spend another night in front of our apartment dressed like one of the Village People.<eos> You make that joke every three months.<eos> I still don't get it.

Hello, Leo.<eos> Mom...<eos> You will soon be with me, Leo.<eos> Help me.<eos> I will help you, but first you need to give me the code.<eos> But I'm not allowed to.<eos> Give me the code, Leo.<eos> Give the code to mommy, Leo. Then it's over.<eos> Then you're free.<eos> Whisper it to me.

Inger Engman.<eos> Leo Eischer.<eos> The code David made can't be extracted from the system where it's installed.<eos> That means, you could only spread it by way of the original, the source code.<eos> So, even if you found a liberated hubot, there's no way of extracting the code.<eos> - Have you dealt with liberated units?<eos> It's a felony, you know that.<eos> How would you be able to help us?<eos> What's this collaboration of yours?<eos> Even if I placed the code right under your nose, you wouldn't recognize it.
Of course.<eos> I wanted to ask you about the makeup test.<eos> I saw my grade, and I think there's something wrong.<eos> I don't think it's...<eos> Well, are you sure it's accurate?<eos> Very sure.<eos> I got a 94.<eos> I know.<eos> How could I get a 94 on a test I didn't complete?<eos> I think somebody did something to the test paper before you graded it, and I just want you to know I had nothing to do with it.
Give her a minute to get out of the lobby, then we'll go.<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, my God, it's Jenna!<eos> Call Spencer and em!<eos> Spence, call Emily, tell her we're following Jenna.<eos> You know, you'd think I would have remembered.<eos> This thing owes me a lot of quarters.<eos> When did you become friends with Arthur hackett?<eos> I'm not, but I know how much he hates conflict.<eos> Almost as much as he hates making a decision, so I thought if I offered him a way out, he'd take it.
You almost tripped over a catheter back there that was still attached to someone.<eos> 312, 312...<eos> There it is.<eos> We need to have a plan. We have a plan.<eos> Exposing "A."<eos> Inside voice. Okay.<eos> What is the plan exactly?<eos> We're going to replace Garrett's note with a fake note that we wrote.<eos> I know that part.<eos> I came up with it, remember?
Hang out.<eos> You sure?<eos> Yeah, you're my first customer today.<eos> All right.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm, uh, having a nightcap.<eos> You want to join me?<eos> What are you drinking?<eos> Coffee liqueur in a Chewbacca mug.<eos> I call it a sad-tini.
It is certainly better like this.<eos> That's good.<eos> Come down.<eos> What a descend.<eos> Really cool.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Everything okay?<eos> Come on, get up.<eos> Where's my sled?<eos> Give it back!
Are you trying to fuck me over?<eos> Yes?<eos> - Where's my laptop?<eos> - On the table.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> On the long table in the dining room.<eos> It isn't here anymore. I'm sitting at the table.<eos> Where the whisky is.<eos> I'm positive.<eos> I saw it there. It was open
Not anymore.<eos> On the long table in the dining room.<eos> It isn't here anymore. I'm sitting at the table.<eos> Where the whisky is.<eos> I'm positive.<eos> I saw it there. It was open<eos> - Get up here at once.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Give me the laptop.<eos> I'll put it back.
I just wanted to go to that drive-in.<eos> - It's okay.<eos> Have a nice evening.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - Hey! Open the trunk.<eos> UWe! Let him be.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It isn't properly shut.<eos> Then shut it.
Are you crazy?<eos> You want to leave the office at 5:00?<eos> Oh, don't be ridiculous.<eos> Happy hour starts at 4:00.<eos> It's a bad idea.<eos> You're never going to get an injunction to stop the strike outright.<eos> You read that in a book, or is that what your five minutes practicing law have to say?<eos> Not a book but every labor decision from the last ten years.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's a safer bet arguing for the temporary restraining order.<eos> First of all, a T.R.O. delays a strike, an injunction stops it, and I want to stop it.
I want to, uh--<eos> taupe.<eos> - Is that--?<eos> - Justice Thomas.<eos> I knew it.<eos> What can I do for you, Louis?<eos> Ah, to the point. Of course.<eos> I wanted t-- I wanted to congratulate you on bringing in Pfister Insurance and let you know I've taken the liberty of putting together the initial paperwork.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Leave it there.
No, I know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I should probably get going.<eos> I have an extra ticket, third row.<eos> Yeah, I like to buy a seat to my right just as a precaution.<eos> Yeah. I would love to.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Yeah. Okay.<eos> You just carry around an extra tux for the random occasion?<eos> Something told me you'd need it.
I'm fine.<eos> You haven't hired her replacement.<eos> She's irreplaceable.<eos> - I'm assigning you a temp.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> Not for you. You should fold.<eos> - Damn it.<eos> - I swear I'm listening.<eos> No, no, the judge assigned to your fraud case just denied our motion to seal.<eos> What? That motion's a slam dunk, and we need it.
This goes forward to trial.<eos> This guy is pissing me off.<eos> Yeah, he's really good.<eos> Kind of inspiring, actually.<eos> You trying to piss me off more?<eos> Yeah, it focuses you.<eos> It's what you do to me.<eos> Yeah, I do that because you don't have a natural killer instinct.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Good, because I need you to use it.
You know, I hadn't thought of that.<eos> I'll simply return the money.<eos> That is certainly your prerogative.<eos> But it could look like you took money for favors and then got scared.<eos> No one forced liquor down your throat, Ella.<eos> You got drunk, we played a bad joke, but that was a long time ago.<eos> You know, a man's reputation is at stake, and I'm not joking with you now.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Lastly, section 5, page 30 states that the Royal Hall is responsible for all maintenance and repairs of the rehearsal space.<eos> I'm aware of what the lease says, Mr. Litt, having drafted it myself.
Uh, hope you like cherry.<eos> That's really nice, but you do not have to...<eos> No, really, we want to.<eos> My wife insisted.<eos> She makes incredible pies, believe me.<eos> So, uh, your door should be fine now.<eos> So, uh, enjoy.<eos> - What about your basket?<eos> - Oh, that's for you too.<eos> My kids made it.
I'm good.<eos> Listen, you take it easy for the next couple of days and if you need anything, you call me.<eos> Yes, will do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi.<eos> Now, I know it's not... Ahem... Equal trade for my life, but I just wanted to say,<eos> Nobody's given me flowers for a long time.<eos> So, what's going on?<eos> I thought you were packing up.<eos> Sort of changed my mind and... Had to stick around for the trial, so I thought I'd keep the shop open till I had to sell it.
Well, that sounds like good advice.<eos> Although you do seem spry despite all.<eos> You know, why not?<eos> Western wisdom says I should have been dead nine months ago, but look.<eos> I made it to the bonus round.<eos> You credit the drugs here?<eos> - Could be the drugs.<eos> - Could be the tea.<eos> You know about the tea?<eos> Yeah, I could smell it in your handbag.
Uh, it's entirely up to you.<eos> Another nonprofit.<eos> Smart act.<eos> I get that reaction a lot.<eos> But the healing powers of the sun have been well-documented.<eos> - Then where does the tea fit in?<eos> - Tea? Yeah, the stinky red stuff, curls the nose hairs.<eos> You're talking about the tea of clarity.<eos> It's pretty foul stuff.<eos> I had to take it off our shelves recently.
Then why were you trying to steal his body?<eos> I'm not stealing him, either.<eos> I told you--<eos> I need to perform a ritual to release the bad energy before his journey to the afterlife.<eos> There was something inside Braddock, wasn't there?<eos> Something that would lead directly to you if the coroner discovered it.<eos> You never did share the proprietary blend of that stinky special tea of yours, did you?<eos> The tea of clarity?<eos> It was killing him quicker than the cancer.<eos> That's why you stopped selling it.
- No stairs.<eos> Magnetic key in the lift<eos> Just one. On the wrist.<eos> Sixty seconds till it absorbs'<eos> You have a problem with this?<eos> Don't you?<eos> If all of us get such a quick death, we'll be lucky.<eos> Did you get anything on Goebel?<eos> Just the smell of his aftershave He had a case with him.<eos> He left without it.
I have a date with Conroy,<eos> That was quick.<eos> - I'll need a sedative.<eos> - I'll get you something discreet'<eos> - Thank you, everyone.<eos> Zoe.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Goebel's case has gone missing.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Yeah, I saw it at the club this morning.
Whoever our imposter was, I believe he murdered Goebel, then took his place.<eos> After nearly 500 years, its meaning remains obscure, even to scholars.<eos> You asked me here to talk about art, Mr. Ballard?<eos> A subject which bores me to tears except for this particular picture.<eos> It was painted in 1533, a period of intense economic unrest in Europe, but not unlike today.<eos> Some think it was commissioned by a French ambassador, but I believe it was British merchants.<eos> Is this supposed to interest me?<eos> It should.<eos> These merchants felt constrained by their governments who wrote the laws and levied the taxes. So they formed a secret pact.<eos> They called it Hourglass.
Polyhedrus has offices in London.<eos> I'm going to see if I can find Hill for some answers.<eos> That's bad timing.<eos> Jack Turner is planning to have Zahir assassinated later on today'<eos> I didn't know Jack was in the assassination business.<eos> Fawkes picked up a snipers riﬂe with Tyrone.<eos> We think they're going to use it at the Asia Promise Society this afternoon'<eos> Why would he kill Zahir?<eos> She's opposed to the sale of the dam.<eos> She may be, but she can't stop it.
- That's pretty much.<eos> - What did he get for our money?<eos> 1.3 kilo perhaps.<eos> Almost a third.<eos> The question is: Who paid for the rest?<eos> Not Glenn.<eos> He's definitely not got that much money.<eos> - How much do you think?<eos> - I don't know... no one in this town.<eos> His car's at the impound. The cops are waiting to see if someone picks it up.
There's a crescent moon out tonight.<eos> Oh, dip, seriously?<eos> Why do we care about a crescent moon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm gonna live up there someday.<eos> Hey, Julia, what's up, girl?<eos> Hope you're having a great time in Beijing.<eos> I miss you; I can't wait to see you.<eos> I got the cactus. Thank you so much.<eos> I'm taking great care of it.
Maybe we should just let this one go, man.<eos> No, nobody else is getting our copper.<eos> Someone's here.<eos> There's no truck outside except ours.<eos> Maybe they already took a load.<eos> I mean, someone's still cutting.<eos> Well, they're gonna have to share.<eos> They got a torch.<eos> Whoever's down here, you better get the hell out.<eos> We're security, and we'll arrest your ass if we find it.
Now, hold on.<eos> Whoa, whoops.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Hey, I'm just glad I could be here. To, you know, help rescue a woman I've never met before. Or been introduced to.<eos> But, you know, I... look, I don't take it personally.<eos> Are you really gonna bring that up right now?<eos> No, no, I know, I know, I'm just a little nervous.<eos> You know, these are daemonfeuers after all.<eos> And I know you have a plan, it's just, you know, you haven't shared it with me...
You and I never really liked each other.<eos> - We haven't?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, I definitely meant what I said.<eos> Whatever you need, consider it done.<eos> Good.<eos> I want you to help kill me.<eos> Um... maybe we should talk about this inside.<eos> Karen, you can't seriously be considering this.<eos> Listen, cancer's a bully, and when it's as bad as mine, it laughs at our pathetic little attempts to fight it.
How you doing?<eos> Karen's taking a nap.<eos> Actually, it's you I wanna talk to.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Mmm! That pie smells wonderful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Karen made rhubarb.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> She knows I don't like it.
Karen's taking a nap.<eos> Actually, it's you I wanna talk to.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Sure.<eos> Mmm! That pie smells wonderful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Karen made rhubarb.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> She knows I don't like it.<eos> How could you not like it?
Well, if a man knows what you're thinking, it gives him power over you.<eos> For example, if a man knows how much you love him, he'll take you for granted.<eos> He'll hurt you... carelessly, cruelly, constantly.<eos> Does daddy know that you love him? Yes.<eos> I have told him repeatedly that I cannot live without him.<eos> If you're so upset with him, why are you making his favorite pie?<eos> Because after all of these years, I've forgotten how to wear my mask.<eos> So now I must do things to distract daddy.<eos> Like this pie.<eos> When I bring it out, he'll be so excited, he won't notice the devastation in my eyes.
Now you.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I was raised by wolves.<eos> You wanted to help, right?<eos> Sit down and try it.<eos> No.<eos> Don't use your hands.<eos> Use your mind.<eos> Focus your attention, and it moves in the direction you want.
Are you sure? I'm sure.<eos> Come here.<eos> How was your Christmas?<eos> It was good.<eos> Filled with family.<eos> So you haven't mentioned my book.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> So you didn't like it?<eos> No, no, that's not it.<eos> I liked it a lot.
Ladies and gentlemen, could I have your kind attention, please.<eos> You may come forward if you wish.<eos> I have been trying to get William Borgens up here to speak to my class for years.<eos> He's never said no, but he's never said yes, either.<eos> Tonight, I have him at a certain disadvantage.<eos> My entire class is here, Bill. And I insist you come up here and say a few words.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Mr. Borgens.<eos> Your professor, while a very nice man, is a sneaky son of a bitch.<eos> The reason Leslie could never get me up here to talk about the process of writing is I'm not sure I have much to say about it that could benefit you.<eos> I still find it all very mysterious, years after I wrote my first book.
I don't like the idea of locking Alex up, Peter.<eos> I know you don't, but that's the job.<eos> Well, what if we can get the puppeteer?<eos> If he's pulling the strings, maybe we can work something out.<eos> Okay, after lunch today, I'll finagle an invite back to her place. Great.<eos> Find out what's in at envelope.<eos> And whatever your finagling methods, remember, we'll be watching.<eos> It's a very... Thoughtful gift, Moz.<eos> That particular Rai stone is among the largest of its kind.<eos> Well, don't you think the Micronesian people might want to see it in a museum?
Stop.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Oh!<eos> Plain view. Stop.<eos> Plain view.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Did you see a manila envelope?<eos> Ah, come on.<eos> Yes.<eos> I got it.
A minor conciliation.<eos> I would rather be watching the Betamax.<eos> Also, I do not like this plan.<eos> Look, it's simple.<eos> The Hellerman gallery's hosting a new exhibit on modern Greek identity.<eos> To which you, as a prominent contemporary artist, will add... Ostensibly.<eos> So, what don't you like about the plan?<eos> Alex. Is she or is she not going to kill me?<eos> Alex parked the box truck out back.<eos> After they load it up, we follow it to the meet with Spiteri.
Sarge... mind if I run an errand real quick?<eos> Was this part of your fantastic plan?<eos> I never said my plan was fantastic, but, no, this is not how I thought it would go.<eos> Do we have an even bigger problem on our hands now?<eos> Not if we can find a match for this blood.<eos> You'll be able to make an arrest.<eos> The sooner the better.<eos> I couldn't agree more.<eos> You know, your car's fixed now.<eos> You're gonna have to start using it.
So how are we gonna get in?<eos> How do you feel about a little breaking and entering?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All of us have some kind of longing.<eos> A need crying out to be met.<eos> What is this place? Shh, shh, shh.<eos> Wait.<eos> Some of us get what we want and we're happy.<eos> The snow.<eos> I thought maybe if you saw it, you could finally get some peace.
You know how to make yourself irresistible.<eos> I do.<eos> Well, the sooner, the better.<eos> Blood of the deceived.<eos> I was doing some baking.<eos> Now, don't go giving those away.<eos> I made them just for you.<eos> Cookie.<eos> You got the Burroughs report?<eos> Gave it to me.
- "Unbezahlbar."<eos> - "Unbezahlbar."<eos> - My brother has a book.<eos> Hang on, we're looking.<eos> Here it is.<eos> - Oh, here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Uh, it is a dense mineral deposit which grows in the throat sack.<eos> It develops something like an egg.<eos> Anyway, um, yeah, if the stone gets too big, it needs to be delivered, and the trick is getting it out intact, because if it's damaged, it's, you know, worthless.
So I practised my curtsey for nothing, then?<eos> Next time, can you wait before I call you in?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Your tea, Miss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Just leave his on his desk.<eos> Who knows where he's wandered off to?<eos> My supervising the ladies isn't wandering, Joyce.<eos> What's happened to this tea?<eos> It's actually drinkable for a change.
Alright?<eos> Oi!<eos> You got a light?<eos> Oi!<eos> You look after yourself, mate.<eos> 'Miss Fisher, I realise you have taken steps to ensure my...'<eos> My apologies, Miss.<eos> I wasn't sure whether you intended to keep the letter.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you read it?
Ah... Don't waste a trip.<eos> You can take Marigold's things back to her father.<eos> What things?<eos> Don't worry about it. The police have finished with them.<eos> Follow me, young men.<eos> Why did we agree to this job?<eos> It's only for the early part of the evening.<eos> And I need you to keep an eye on Jane.<eos> Leave the bag, Cec.<eos> I'll deliver it myself.
It was just one more thing to pretend.<eos> Mr Tarrant tells us it was your idea to mount a production of Ruddigore.<eos> I wrote to him in England.<eos> I thought it would be the perfect opportunity for him to return home after all those years away.<eos> Did you see the ghost?<eos> No. When we finally heard about it I looked for her, but she'd vanished.<eos> Where were you when the ghost appeared?<eos> Downstage left.<eos> We were in the middle of a dress rehearsal.<eos> So Walter was the only one who saw it?
What is it, Dot?<eos> Sorry to trouble you, but Mrs Lin is here.<eos> Said she wants to speak with you.<eos> Oh, why didn't you let her in?<eos> She won't come in.<eos> I've asked.<eos> My apologies, Mrs Lin.<eos> Please, join us.<eos> You are Fox spirit.<eos> Fox spirit take man property and waste it.
But first, what was Elton John's sexual orientation in the '70s?<eos> Bye.<eos> - You've done that one before.<eos> - And it never gets old, like the good Captain Fantastic himself. Hey, Claire, guess what?<eos> I'm sorry, honey, I can't talk right now.<eos> I told Bethenny I would take her to the airport.<eos> I'm late, and she's gonna miss her flight.<eos> Where are my keys?<eos> Why is that chair still here?<eos> I thought you and Luke were gonna put it out on the sidewalk.
Now we have the lucky- - Oh!<eos> Oh, thank God. Nobody's dead.<eos> Or... we're all dead.<eos> How many plates did we lose?<eos> None. Luke and Haley used cookie sheets to clear a path through the marbles for me.<eos> Where are the marbles? Right here.<eos> Oh, Haley!<eos> I put glue on them so it doesn't happen again.<eos> What about the chair?<eos> Leon and I rolled it outside on some skateboards. Oh.
And the defense could paint Jack as a typically sensible man driven to illogic by a conniving temptress.<eos> Wouldn't be the first time.<eos> I think Emily's got a point, though.<eos> These days, a bartender makes a far less compelling target than a member of the 1%.<eos> What we need is a spin doctor on our side, a good one. Somebody who can help shape the public opinion before arguments even start.<eos> What about Mason Treadwell?<eos> Well, he hasn't returned any of my calls since the night of the fire.<eos> He seems to have vanished as well.<eos> I'm sure another trial of the decade could help lure him out of hiding.<eos> I'm gonna look into it.
I'm not used to seeing you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I was gone longer than I planned.<eos> Nolan filled in.<eos> Upside is, he knows more about pre-calculus than you do.<eos> The, uh, the downside is, is he's Nolan.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're back.<eos> Is that your hoodie?<eos> You said you were gonna get rid of that, Jack.<eos> I might still need it.
Three months ago, you were unable to finish a painting, and here you are now with an entire collection of your best work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All inspired by you.<eos> Again.<eos> I thought I'd save yours till last.<eos> I got the distinct impression you rather like being left undone.<eos> I do.<eos> - There's hope in it...<eos> And her path is still unchosen.<eos> Maybe it's time to choose it. Hmm?
Standing right outside. Good.<eos> There's one loose end I'm leaving to you.<eos> So you think the Graysons had the guy who beat me up break in here a second time and steal my hoodie? The Graysons did what?<eos> It's just a hypothesis, but it makes sense, doesn't it?<eos> - So then I'm screwed. - Au contraire.<eos> Because according to the police scanner, they found the bloody hoodie when they picked the dirtbag up.<eos> The Graysons can't exactly admit their association to the guy, so their lawyer's gonna have to make it look like he's the killer. You really think they're capable of that?<eos> They hired the guy to beat you half to death, didn't they?<eos> The Graysons are capable of anything when it comes to protecting their family.<eos> How did they even know I had it?
I'll be waiting when you get there.<eos> So... He saved my life.<eos> By faking your death.<eos> Tell her about the white-haired man.<eos> There was a man who visited Grayson a handful of times.<eos> Now these meetings were always off the books.<eos> The first time I saw him was a year to the day before that plane went down.<eos> The last time was the morning your father died.<eos> Do you remember his name?<eos> He never gave it.
Luna?<eos> - Sir-<eos> - How you feeling? - Emma-<eos> - I saw her.<eos> She got away. I saw her.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna have to ask that you go back-<eos> Lady, I need a chair.<eos> - Where did she go?<eos> - You need to reconnect your IV-<eos> If whatever is in my IV is important, you can bring it from my room to me here.
Princess!<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> ! Where did the bolt come from?<eos> This hurts...<eos> Griffith!<eos> Griffith...<eos> Casca.<eos> Griffith.<eos> What about the bolt?<eos> Don't touch it.
Believe it or not,<eos> I'm happy about this. I'm...<eos> I can finally move on.<eos> This is a good thing.<eos> Really.<eos> Hey, Robin.<eos> Oh, hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey. Uh, look, before I forget, here's Lily's hairdryer.<eos> I borrowed it, like, a million years ago.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> Item being procured:<eos> one standard-sized paper clip.<eos> Did you guys see that stupid foul call in the game last night?<eos> See it?<eos> We followed the ref home and beat the crap out of him.<eos> Yeah, I ill think that might've been a kid who worked at Foot Locker.<eos> Hey, the supply room's open.<eos> I better close it.
Um, I hear you and mommy yelling again last night.<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> It was just a TV show.<eos> Mitch Miller was yelling at one of his idiot singers.<eos> You just concentrate on catching the fish and not whether there'll be someone there to cook it.<eos> I got a bite!<eos> We got a fish!<eos> We got a fish!<eos> All right, settle down there, boy.<eos> After we eat it, can we let it go?
Wonder if Vicky scared her out of town. Hmm.<eos> You showed up to the guy's house?<eos> Is that your neighbor, Riley, sitting with Frankie?<eos> ...a sex doll, right? Oh, my God.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's with the suit?<eos> Your interview with Cavanaugh isn't until Monday.<eos> I thought I'd break it in.<eos> Well, I told him to wear it.
Mulan!<eos> Mulan!<eos> Hello?<eos> Who's there?<eos> Hey!<eos> Aah! Over here!<eos> What the hell was that thing?<eos> A wraith!<eos> Did I...<eos> Kill it?
Aah! Over here!<eos> What the hell was that thing?<eos> A wraith!<eos> Did I...<eos> Kill it?<eos> No, it's regenerating.<eos> It'll be back.<eos> It doesn't stop until it devours its prey.<eos> Me.<eos> So how do we kill it?
Let me ask you something. Where do you think that thing came from?<eos> Gold.<eos> I made a promise to Henry.<eos> She's not dying.<eos> If it can't be killed, what do you suggest?<eos> Send it somewhere it can't hurt anyone.<eos> Did Henry really ask you to protect me?<eos> Yes.<eos> The hat.<eos> You had it all along.
Who's Jefferson?<eos> Torches for when it comes back.<eos> I know it's old-fashioned, but so am I.<eos> So... how does it work?<eos> It will open a portal to our land.<eos> All we have to do is send the wraith in there.<eos> Oh, yeah. Just that.<eos> I don't understand. I thought our land was gone.<eos> It is.<eos> But sending it to a place that no longer exists... well, that's banishing it to oblivion.
I need to buy a new oven and I don't know what to buy.<eos> Doesn't the lady have anyone to help her?<eos> No.<eos> No children, neighbors?<eos> No one.<eos> It has five flames and two separate compartments.<eos> The lady can see for herself.<eos> Isn't it a little too low?<eos> Low?<eos> You think it's too low?
Bye.<eos> Good night, transvestite Penny.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let us take you off the wall.<eos> Out of sight, out of mind.<eos> I wish.<eos> You know, can I borrow that movie?<eos> Those singing hooligans really got my motor running. Sure, sure.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> I mean, get it back to me when you can, or... you know what, actually, you keep it. It's just going to be my gift to you.
So...<eos> Right.<eos> Have a good day. Be good. Be polite.<eos> Don't you go overdoing it.<eos> Thanks, Mum.<eos> House-to-house has thrown up a number of names Nadia routinely knocks about with. Three of those names cropped up on her intelligence record.<eos> Anthony Stainfield, Nikki Madden, Liam Welsh.<eos> The four of them were stopped in a car two and a bit months since.<eos> A shitty, no insurance, no MOT.<eos> It was impounded, so we've still got it over at Collyhurst.
I know what you're going through.<eos> That's why I wanted to make this movie.<eos> To wake people up to the warning signs that someone in their family might commit suicide.<eos> And what did you do when you saw on the digital feed someone intending to jump?<eos> I called 911, of course.<eos> Objection, Your Honor, counsel has produced no record of this call.<eos> - It's not in evidence.<eos> - Yes, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> Ms. Crozier has a good point.<eos> Bring in proof of this 911 call, then you can put it in the record.

Yes, uh, he was afraid there wasn't enough footage from the suicide bridge.<eos> There's usually 15 suicides a year from that bridge.<eos> Uh, he had his cameras up for nine months, but there was only one.<eos> This one.<eos> Yes, Cynthia Caracetti.<eos> So, Mr. Stoddard decided to create a YouTube video?<eos> Yes, to gain attention, that's what he said.<eos> I needed financing, that's all.<eos> So, how did you manipulate the image of this young woman committing suicide?<eos> We digitally enhanced the sky, making it softer, bluer.
No, David.<eos> You would hate it.<eos> You hate people. I don't hate people.<eos> I hate... some people.<eos> I am being selfless here.<eos> Well, um, let me consider it.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> When Will comes back, you know I'll give up the seat.<eos> I don't want the seat.<eos> So you know I'll give it up.
This is about the 30% decline in stock price since Gerald Drescher took over.<eos> And the vote is going my way?<eos> We swung Brynford Mutual your way this morning. - 36,000 shares.<eos> - Good.<eos> And your firm will have a five percent stake, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> That must look good for you, making so much money.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Happy days.<eos> You know, others may find your cynicism bracing, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> I find it charming.
Come over here.<eos> This was a mistake, wasn't it?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now go off to your Peter.<eos> Not without my sh...<eos> Our first date.<eos> - Yeah, this was a mistake.<eos> - but then something else happened.<eos> The wife of the state's attorney,<eos> Alicia Florrick, asked me into her office and told me if I changed this report and exonerated her husband, that she would sign it, too.
Don't worry, it's not ex parte.<eos> The trial is over.<eos> Get out.<eos> You can head out, too, Judy.<eos> Ms. Lockhart, have a seat.<eos> I need a lawyer.<eos> Civil or criminal?<eos> Possibly both.<eos> Uh, what is the case?<eos> You agree to take it?
Confidence. It cuts both ways.<eos> Tell me.<eos> What did you see in your hallucinations?<eos> Ezra.<eos> Your father.<eos> History rewritten.<eos> Creatures.<eos> So many voices.<eos> The din drowned out all reason. I tried.<eos> I tried on my own to silence it, but it only grew louder.
- Not now.<eos> Ten seconds and destroyed.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Do you have time to go buy a changing table?<eos> I would like to finish the nursery.<eos> Buy yourself.<eos> Well, I'm kinda busy planning a small wedding.<eos> - Food for 50 seats.<eos> You know ...<eos> - I'll buy it tomorrow.
- Yeah. And surprise, it was at the discretion of...<eos> - ... Hannah. - Hannah.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That poor woman had to watch her dead brother be dug up. And for what?<eos> I put her through fucking hell.<eos> You couldn't anticipate this. It's not your fault.<eos> Well, it doesn't make it any better.<eos> Sometimes my job really fucking sucks.<eos> Actually, it always sucks.<eos> Why do you do it?
It was a personal matter.<eos> My girlfriend works at the club.<eos> Jesus, Quinn.<eos> I came to talk to Novikov about Nadia.<eos> The conversation got heated.<eos> He pulled out a gun, shot me. I returned fire.<eos> Self-defence.<eos> - Plain and simple.<eos> - Write up a report.<eos> I want it on my desk in the morning.
Say that due to my overzealous nature as a police officer, I got too caught up in the case.<eos> You got too caught up being an idiot.<eos> I'm already down, Tom.<eos> Stop kicking.<eos> My job is at stake.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You just keep your head low.<eos> And for God's sake, start doing your job if you have any hope of keeping it.
- And Chef Alan is a chef, so it's perfect.<eos> - Of course it's perfect.<eos> It's as if someone with crystal eyes looked into your heart and crystallized your love for him.<eos> - Pricey, though.<eos> - If you think I'm gonna pressure you into buying this 35-pound crystal chef's hat...<eos> - ... I'm not.<eos> - You're not?<eos> Of course not.<eos> This crystal was clearly made for Chef Alan.<eos> If you don't buy it, I'm sure somebody else will.
All right, I'll give it a shot.<eos> No, no, no, no! No. No.<eos> That's not Bobo.<eos> That's Ed.<eos> Look, I don't even belong here.<eos> The court just wants you to sign this piece of paper that says I showed up.<eos> You sign it now, I can bounce and you can check out my ass when I leave.<eos> I've already checked out your ass.<eos> It's one of the best ones in the group.<eos> It'll look even better if you put it in that chair so we can start.
I know nothing about, and they're not interested in the things I do know about him.<eos> That he's warm, and funny, and generous, and loving.<eos> Like when I was little, and he and I would take our plane to our chalet in deer valley.<eos> Stop.<eos> You might as well rephrase that to<eos> "when he and I would take our guilty to our guilty in guilty valley."<eos> Every morning, before we went skiing, he would get up really early and make me his snowflake cinnamon french toast.<eos> Sounds amazing.<eos> And as he dusted the cinnamon and sugar on top, he'd say, "look, sweetheart, it's snowing, snowing just for you."<eos> And then he'd cut it into these little pieces...
I'm here.<eos> Are you feeling better?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm better.<eos> I...<eos> Cristina, um... I know that you don't want to talk about it, but... I'm here, so...<eos> I just want to stay on the phone with you until you want to hang up.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I'm here.<eos> The human body is made up of systems that keep it alive.
Some hikers found her.<eos> What is it, Karev?<eos> Uh, Jane Doe, looks to be around 15 years old.<eos> Hunt wants you to take a look at her.<eos> Hey, any word back on my interviews?<eos> Uh, yeah, I'm working on it.<eos> The angle's off on this elbow.<eos> You've been working on it for a couple of weeks now.<eos> Well, you're an acquired taste, like blue cheese.<eos> Some people love it and some people can't stand to be in the same room with it.
Want to help?<eos> No.<eos> I'm gonna cancel our lunch reservation.<eos> Oh, are you really still moping about lunch?<eos> I had a plan.<eos> We had a day.<eos> Ben, there is a gnathostoma worm in this man's body.<eos> These things eat through the viscera, migrate through the tissue.<eos> This is a once-in-a-lifetime parasite.<eos> I'm sorry if I find it a little more interesting right now than the crossword and garden salad.
No, it's--it's Altman and Yang, okay?<eos> They'll figure something out.<eos> They're gonna figure something out.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sedona.<eos> How's my ticker?<eos> Cancer free?<eos> The tumor had taken over your heart, and there was no good way to get it out so...
He seems upset.<eos> Are you surprised?<eos> Alice, you've contaminated the site.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> And the police are swarming all over the place.<eos> - Police? Why?<eos> - The bodies, Alice.<eos> The skeletons. - I just picked up a ring, that's all.<eos> - I didn't find any ring.<eos> I dropped it.
No, you may not.<eos> Just answer my questions, please.<eos> - I'm trying to.<eos> Stealing ancient artifacts is a serious criminal offense.<eos> I know that.<eos> - So stop telling lies.<eos> - I haven't lied.<eos> You claim to have discovered a ring in the cave, but no ring has been found.<eos> No one else has seen this mysterious ring. So we have two options.<eos> Either you were mistaken... or you took it.

I was wrong, thank God.<eos> But I do believe an innocent man was mistaken for him.<eos> Somehow, the secret has been betrayed.<eos> What about the book under your protection?<eos> It's well hidden.<eos> When the time comes, if things go badly at Carcassona, I will tell you where.<eos> In the meantime, I only hope I still have time to fulfill my obligations.<eos> But if I cannot, you must take my place.<eos> The labyrinth is a symbol of the Grail.<eos> Now, this ring, keep it safe.
Now, this ring, keep it safe.<eos> The other guardians will know you by it.<eos> When the time comes, they will tell you what to do.<eos> But why me, Father?<eos> Oriane is your eldest daughter. She has power and influence at court.<eos> Why not entrust this duty to her?<eos> Oriane thinks too much of her own wealth and comfort.<eos> Only you possess the qualities needed for so great an undertaking.<eos> Keep it safe.<eos> I shall wear it close to my heart... always.
If it's tails, I'm going to flog you to death.<eos> Now, that's gonna be very exhausting for me, and it's gonna be a damn sight more uncomfortable for you.<eos> But it's your choice.<eos> The whip or the blade.<eos> Or you could tell me where the books are.<eos> Oh, dear. It's tails.<eos> Tell me your name, sir.<eos> I'll pray for your soul.<eos> Have you taken the ring?<eos> I told you, I never even saw it.
Someone must stand against blasphemers.<eos> Someone must take God's side.<eos> You do not have to suffer, Shelagh.<eos> Just tell me what I need to know.<eos> I am telling you the truth. Biau took the ring.<eos> He was supposed to give it to Marie-Cecile.<eos> - So then why didn't he?<eos> - I don't know! I don't know.<eos> Why does this ring matter so much?<eos> Marie-Cecile thinks it's the key... - What?

All right.<eos> Mr. Wineman.<eos> Beautiful cemetery.<eos> You should be proud. So neat.<eos> Mm. Thank you.<eos> Uh, what--what can I do for you, Mr. Jane?<eos> Well, like I said on the phone, um, I'm with the CBI.<eos> We're pursuing a particularly vicious killer.<eos> Tough case.<eos> But with your help, we can crack it.
furthermore, our treasure maps are identical<eos> That is why... you suspect that the map...<eos> Maybe, I'm too suspicious<eos> I've lost confidence in man and lots of things<eos> At least you believe that the heavenly pill can resurrect the dead<eos> I'm researching science, don't believe what that cannot be scientifically proven.<eos> But later I discover that many things can't be explained with science and many sickness that cannot be treated with science<eos> I really want to find the spirit of the Ho Shou Wu but there are no leads.<eos> Didn't you just said that Ho Shou Wu can sense the the heart of man?<eos> You can try use your heart to find it.
- I gotta push.<eos> - Okay. - I gotta push.<eos> Somebody!<eos> - I'm okay, I'm okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You're doing great, Lori.<eos> Just keep doing it.<eos> Your body knows what to do.<eos> Let it do all the work.
Just wanted to check on Carl.<eos> Rick, we can handle taking out the bodies.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - No, I do.<eos> Everyone have a gun and a knife?<eos> Yeah. We're running low on ammo, though.<eos> Maggie and me were planning on making a run this afternoon.<eos> Found a phone book with some places we can hit, look for bullets and formula.<eos> We cleared out the generator room.<eos> Axel's there trying to fix it in case of emergency.
Well, this place sounds pretty secure.<eos> - You can't go alone.<eos> - I'll go.<eos> I'm In.<eos> I got the flash bangs and I got the tear gas.<eos> You never know what you're gonna need.<eos> Hey, don't you worry about your old man.<eos> I'm gonna keep my eye on him.<eos> - Wasn't this place overrun?<eos> - It was. And you cleared it out all by yourselves?
It's working.<eos> I'll set the time, minus one second.<eos> Why?<eos> Clocks are one second faster than the movement of the planets.<eos> So today we set them right.<eos> When it's 1 1 :59 and 59 seconds, one second later, it will still be 1 1 :59 and 59 seconds.<eos> And one second later... it will be midnight.<eos> We can say Happy New Year.<eos> Look... I'd like... to take off this ring, but... I can't.<eos> Can you saw it?

- Speak it.<eos> - Just one.<eos> So say it.<eos> Calm down ifyou want me to speak.<eos> Give me that knife.<eos> I beg of you.<eos> If only for the love you feel for me.<eos> Or the love you felt.<eos> Drop the knife.<eos> Pick it up and throw it away!
Not my problem.<eos> Why'd you come up there?<eos> Why do you think?<eos> I needed to know you were safe.<eos> Now I know.<eos> You don't know shit.<eos> I need distance, Clay.<eos> Stop checking up on me.<eos> You want to drink yourself stupid, you want to lay down with spic bangers, knock yourself out.<eos> You want distance, you got it.
Previously on Sons of Anarchy...<eos> When Clay is back at the table, we can discuss the deal.<eos> The only way this deal happens is if he's runnin' it.
- Who is he?<eos> - I'll be sure and ask him...<eos> Right before I kill him.<eos> The driver's license Root had in Caroline Turing's name was real.<eos> You sure?<eos> Finch checked out her credentials.<eos> I'm guessing someone at the DMV might have sold it to her off the books.<eos> Okay, John.<eos> I'll get the name of the employee who issued it.<eos> Just call me when you have it.
I have a plan.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's an antenna that gets all the radio stations.<eos> My uncle's going to speak on the radio with famous Koran readers.<eos> "It makes your heart melt," he says.<eos> He should hear my mother sing!<eos> She should have a channel of her own.<eos> We'll talk about this later.<eos> Where's the nail polish?<eos> I hid it under there the other day.
I think it's gonna work.<eos> We're just making small talk, waiting for her lawyer.<eos> Well, small talk's over.<eos> I'm her lawyer.<eos> You don't need his permission.<eos> You wanna talk to her, you talk to me first.<eos> Is that clear, soon-to-be-a-patrolman Murphy?<eos> Good evening, detective.<eos> I thought my case was too boring for you.<eos> It was, but I realized something that made it interesting.
Let's have a look at you.<eos> You're quite serious about this.<eos> It's wise to be.<eos> There's more blood spilled at horse fairs than anywhere else.<eos> - Did you have one in Coleraine?<eos> - Oh, aye. Great gas of a day.<eos> Yeah, my dad put on his best, strolled down the high street like a grand man, jiggling the coins in his pocket.<eos> What did he do?<eos> He was only a clerk for the ironmongers, but he had a certain air.<eos> You had to admire it.
I downloaded all the encrypted communications between Cherokee and Langley.<eos> It proves Cherokee was spying for the CIA.<eos> It also lists the names of every informant who's ever worked covertly for the U.S. in Iran.<eos> What you might call a... smoking gun for Tehran.<eos> International incident for the U.S.<eos> Where's this file now?<eos> Safety-deposit box here in L.A.<eos> Who else knows about it?<eos> Janvier tried to make me give him the key.<eos> Told him he wouldn't get it till I got paid.
I haven't seen him.<eos> You shouldn't have come.<eos> I thought you should know, Iran is paranoid that they've been set up by the CIA.<eos> Something Langley's actively encouraging them to believe.<eos> Tehran's asked Vaziri to confirm that Cherokee really is a CIA spy.<eos> So... you need to be careful, Henrietta.<eos> Screw Washington, Tehran, the whole spy game.<eos> I'm not going to defend the agency or anybody else, for that matter.<eos> They're all responsible for making this mess.<eos> And if you've got that letter in your jacket, you hang on to it, Owen.
- How are the burgers here?<eos> - Can't say.<eos> I don't eat meat.<eos> People who do say they're the best in Montauk.<eos> Hey, boss, um...<eos> You think I can get tomorrow night off?<eos> I lined up a gig with a catering service for the Graysons' New Year's thing.<eos> I need you here.<eos> Well, I figured that with the way that business has been going, you... Were gonna start cutting shifts.<eos> You want the catering job, take it.
Alone.<eos> That's how I got here.<eos> But you're not alone.<eos> Nolan intervened so that you wouldn't make a life-altering mistake.<eos> It's not his job to protect me.<eos> No, that was your mother and father's.<eos> What I remember about my mother is that she was sick my entire childhood until she died, and as for my father, well, we both know what happened there.<eos> You are so strong-willed, just like David was.<eos> Death comes on its own.<eos> There's no need in hastening it.
Two CID officers will be involved.<eos> Two?<eos> At the moment, two.<eos> The Chief Inspector will be advising the details at a pre-op briefing.<eos> These guys don't give any warning.<eos> From the word go, they attack.<eos> You saw what he did to the girl last night.<eos> I know. And you're comfortable with that?<eos> I don't intend to be passive.<eos> If you don't see the first punch, you can't defend it.
"There can be only one."<eos> We're at a funeral, and you're quoting Highlander?<eos> Yeah, a lot of people die in it.<eos> Seems appropriate.<eos> You know the one key difference between the two of us?<eos> He's a lying snake in the grass who'll say or do anything.<eos> Mr. Ross, the truth is I don't remember where the James Jenkins pitch came from.<eos> Then it could have come from Myra.<eos> Well, it could have, but it doesn't matter.<eos> Even if I had stolen it, she signed the employee agreement.
- Look at that.<eos> Finishing each other's sentences. How cute.<eos> No wonder you won't throw him under the bus.<eos> Good for you, Harvey.<eos> I mean, you're throwing her under the bus.<eos> Watch yourself, Tanner.<eos> Oh, what's the matter, Harv?<eos> Did I offend your delicate sensibilities?<eos> You want to take your ball and go home?<eos> I'm gonna take my ball and shove it up your-- Harvey.
It's his habit.<eos> Never miss a single day.<eos> Old chaps are like that.<eos> Did her sister ask you to look for her?<eos> No, it's Nan.<eos> He was here this morning.<eos> He asked me for the overcoat.<eos> It's the one Uncle Tai... ...found on the seaside two days ago.<eos> They thought it was Huixiang's.<eos> We brought it to Huixiang's Mom.
I heard you found an overcoat on the seaside.<eos> Yes.<eos> Why are you interested in it?<eos> Nan is my good friend.<eos> I'm tracing something for him.<eos> I know Nan.<eos> I told the police about the overcoat.<eos> Nobody cared.<eos> Does it look familiar?<eos> Who have you seen wearing it.
Go head.<eos> Well, apparently she told Jason uh, he could pick the movie this week, on account of the birthday thing.<eos> What do we do?<eos> She told him, "Any movie you want."<eos> What'd he pick?<eos> "Tremors"<eos> Say again?<eos> "Tremors" It's the giant killer worm movie with uh...<eos> Kevin Bacon. I'm familiar with "Tremors" over.<eos> Well, she promised the kid we'd find it.
What'd he pick?<eos> "Tremors"<eos> Say again?<eos> "Tremors" It's the giant killer worm movie with uh...<eos> Kevin Bacon. I'm familiar with "Tremors" over.<eos> Well, she promised the kid we'd find it.<eos> Been on my ass all day about it, like I got time for this shit.<eos> What kind of a goddammed movie is that to pick anyway?<eos> Over.<eos> Well if they got it, I'll get it, Frank.
I see.<eos> And who exactly are we up against, Lena?<eos> Let's just say weíre happy itís not them holding the case.<eos> It's been sanctioned.<eos> And we will be watching.<eos> Take care of it.<eos> And what if she knows what's in the case?<eos> Do you?<eos> I have an idea. Yeah.<eos> I doubt this girl is stupid enough to open it.
I went to get Mayo, and it all happened so fast.<eos> Ok babies, give me fashion, give me a face, yea.<eos> Peach, I don't know what's going on in your apartment, but I would like it on the record:<eos> I'm not a willing accomplice.<eos> So what is going on here?<eos> Well, Brad is giving us seduction like his name sake and Angelina is giving us nothing like her name sake.<eos> This is pretty fancy set up, were the kids nominated for an Oscar?<eos> Best performance by twins in a ridiculous situation?<eos> It's a photo spread for my new mummy blog,<eos> I'm calling it Mummy and Me. Isn't that clever?
One of the great benefits of starting young in business is that you have less to lose than you know, once you have four kids and something where you have to re-mortgage your house in order to finance your company, that is a bigger risk<eos> to take then if you come straight out of university and all you kind of have to choose between is either you take up a job or you start a crazy company to do crazy thing<eos> I have met kids out here who are still teenager and starting companies and all the way down to sixteen years old, which is pretty crazy when you think about it.<eos> Younger people have been affected by less and they are often times more idealistic and they have bigger dreams and bigger vision because they do not know, necessary,<eos> It doesn't really matter to me, I could be fifty for all I care because removing the age element is really what I think, what makes the Silicon Valley area so fascinating.<eos> That I know so many people that could be really young or really old, they still take you seriously, they will still listen to you.<eos> And that is why there is culture of listening that is so conducive to entrepreneurship which is why this area is so valuable to people<eos> Brian Wong grew up in Vancouver Canada.<eos> At 19 he had raised 4,3 million dollars in funding for his company, Kiip, a reward network where you play games on your phone and get real rewards through Kiip's network.<eos> My parents at one point thought I was addicted to my computer and wanted to take it away from me and I'm glad that they ended up not doing that but I spent, like, eight to ten hours a day on my computer this was at a point when I was very
I spent a lot of time on Photoshop.<eos> I taught my self how to design because I figured it would be pretty fun to learn how to do that.<eos> I taught myself through forums and tutorials and all that fun stuff.<eos> It was all about wanting to create something out of nothing.<eos> I studied marketing and I also did a minor in politic science<eos> I wanted to study something that was completely unrelated to tech, that was in liberal arts so that I could learn how people on the other side of the table were thinking and it was very enlighten.<eos> I was able to learn a lot about perspectives around politic theory and one of the things it helped me do was to understand power structures and politics is inherently turn around power and if I could learn how to navigate these power structures, I could be<eos> successful in other areas and so that is what political science really made me do<eos> I started a web design company, like every other web entrepreneur ends up doing at some point and I called it a design consultancy and we basically charged people to make layouts and it was really me and my buddy, like, hammering<eos> out code and then sending it off to someone on a freelance website to make it all work and then send it off to that client and charging a lot of money for it.
She started her first company in 2007, when she co-founded a social network site named Pownce which a year later got her selected as one of the "Most Influential Women in Web" by Fast Company.<eos> So I first became interested in programming and sort of doing little bit more with computers, when I was about fifteen, it was kind of trendy at the time to make your own webpages and everyone wanted to have their own homepage so I got one of<eos> these free Angelfire, GeoCity homepages and started to learn HTML.<eos> I wasn't quite sure that that was I wanted to for a job, I think it was kind of I always thought was really fun but I actually wanted to be a graphic designer when I was younger because my mother was a graphic designer and I think it is<eos> easy as a kid to just want to do what your parents do because my mother always loved her job and I thought that it would be so cool to love what I was doing.<eos> She graduated from college in 2006 and decided to move to After graduating from college I really wanted to move someplace warm because I grew up in Minnesota which is very cold and I got a job at a start-up in San Jose and I worked for startups for a little while and then I realized that I<eos> wanted to do my own.<eos> I wanted to work on my own projects.<eos> That is why I got into programming because I wanted, you know, to work on my own things.<eos> Leah needed a new laptop but couldn't afford it.
Vimeo is definitely my proudest work, it is certainly the thing that I took the most time designing.<eos> I actually haven't had desire to design something since Vimeo.<eos> I remember having an office and having a door and sort of shutting my self off for six months while I sort of iterated on this constantly.<eos> We didn't have any best practices.<eos> We didn't know how we should be building the site collectively.<eos> Jake and I still considered very much a personal project and so he gave me a lot of space and time to make something I was really proud of.<eos> I remember writing letters to my friends and family saying "I'm sorry, you don't know me anymore" and that sort of thing because I just sort of let all of my relationship go because nothing was important as this.<eos> I remember breaking, I broke up with a girlfriend cause I had no time or interested really, it was really more of an interest thing.<eos> Nothing was exciting to me as this thing.<eos> Knowing that there were tenths of thousands of people using the service and in love with it and waiting to see what we could do next
I think it when you are the most attractive to other people that you are bound to be interested in and you sort of become magnetized.<eos> You just find other people who are also driven to make or to think the same things and it puts you in a really creative place where there is no fear. Where people are just really happy about the things that you are making together and it is in this space that I think you achieve the greatest things creatively.<eos> Success is what you make of it.<eos> I mean I know some of the most successful entrepreneurs can be unhappy.<eos> So I think for me to be a successful entrepreneur is both having a work and life balance.<eos> I want to live life.<eos> Don't be indirect about how you think. Don't take a job to go somewhere else.<eos> If you want to be in Silicon Valley and you want to do a start-up, go to Silicon Valley and do a start-up and don't let anyone stop you because when you get out here it is a whole new world of all kind of possibilities.<eos> So many people have the wrong idea that they have to follow some kind of path.<eos> Build your initial prototype and then pitch it and have a initial customer.
I don't get it.<eos> All of the evidence, Wendy's murder... everything points to the fact that that bracelet should be in there.<eos> Well, it's not.<eos> I did, however, make some headway on my little stick man theory.<eos> Really?<eos> Whilst you were still an officer, you risked your life running into traffic to save an old gypsy woman.<eos> A gypsy woman?<eos> An old gypsy woman.<eos> To reward your bravery, she gave you a talisman.<eos> Mm-hmm. She said, as long as you keep it. No harm will ever befall you.
This is from 6:00 A.M. yesterday morning.<eos> Five hours before the auction.<eos> He broke into my storage unit.<eos> Well, it's... it was Wendell's at the time, but now it's mine.<eos> Is that a safe?<eos> That's why we couldn't find your bracelet.<eos> Because it was in the safe.<eos> My safe.<eos> So do we have a license on that van?<eos> Put it down, dirtbag!
Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry, Ms. Henley.<eos> They just barged in.<eos> I tried to stop them. You people have no grounds to search my residence.<eos> Actually... we do.<eos> This is outrageous. She's right.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> You know what you should do?<eos> Open that wall safe and prove us wrong. Fine.<eos> We can just tear it out of the wall if you'd like.
It says here the arms broke off and the draping's supposed to make her more sensual and erotic.<eos> So, in our killer's mind, she's some crazy mixed-up symbol of love and eroticism.<eos> - All right.<eos> Come on in.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> What a gorgeous space.<eos> The one thing I hate about my job is having to be gone from here.<eos> [ chuckling ] You have a private elevator.<eos> Yeah, sorry we had to take the stairs. I have to get it repaired.
You'll be a trainee working under him, and today is training day.<eos> The crew consists of a driver,<eos> Murray Langston, been working at grayling for 20 years.<eos> Tommy is the hopper, the most dangerous position on the crew, because he has to leave the truck to pick up and drop off cargo.<eos> And then there's the guard, which is you.<eos> If the machine gave us Tommy's number... Somebody's probably planning a robbery.<eos> 73% of all armored car robberies happen when the hopper's away from the truck, so if they're gonna hit you, that's when it'll happen.<eos> GSM link established.<eos> The plate reader will scan any license in its line of sight.<eos> Let us know if anyone's following the truck, casing it for a robbery.
We'll go on to the next question.<eos> - You, sir.<eos> - My name's Steven.<eos> I'm a junior and my question is for Will McAvoy.<eos> Do you consider yourself a Democrat, a Republican or Independent?<eos> I consider myself a New York Jets fan, Steven.<eos> Since it's been brought up, you've almost religiously avoided stating or even implying a political allegiance. Is that because as a news anchor you feel the integrity of your broadcast would be compromised?<eos> That sounds like a good answer.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> There was a short piece on Vanity Fair's website by Marshall Westbrook, you probably saw it, where he calls you the "Jay Leno of news anchors."
Guys, can I have your attention?<eos> I'm sorry if I've been a little inaccessible or terse lately or for several years, but if I could just see a show of hands, who's going with Don to 10:00?<eos> All right, I appreciate all the hard work.<eos> And as a token of that appreciation, I'm giving you guys two weeks' paid vacation starting right now.<eos> Hold on.<eos> You're gonna have her run the show?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Don't do this, Will.<eos> I just offered her the most humiliating contract since Antonio got a loan from Shylock.<eos> She took it.
They would roll belly-up and be out cold for a few minutes.<eos> You want to hypnotize a shark?<eos> That's your big plan, Francine?<eos> No, what I'm saying is if touching them in that spot puts them into a sleep, maybe stabbing them would be a pretty damn good way to kill them.<eos> But it's gotta be a punch. It's gotta be hard, because the shark's skin is so thick, and we have just sticks.<eos> Maybe the eye.<eos> Yeah, the eyes are good, but it's only fatal if you get to the brain.<eos> There's a better route to that. Just right over the top.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> If you're close enough to stab it, you're close enough to get bitten. You know what?
This last project we bought this big old house. Remodeled it...<eos> You mean the house that Keenan was...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, it cost twice what we thought it would to fix it up.<eos> So Keenan takes out a home equity line on his house--<eos> $150,000. 150...<eos> That's pretty steep.<eos> Why didn't you just sell the house?<eos> 'Cause we needed to get the certificate of occupancy.<eos> We couldn't get it. Why not?
Yes, sir.<eos> It's the South Carolina Gazette.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> And an invitation.<eos> Arthur wants to see me first thing.<eos> So much for sleeping in.<eos> I'm assigned to the medical clinic with Lourdes.<eos> Look at us -- commuters on our way to the office.<eos> If I had a pot, I'd make us some coffee.<eos> If I had a cup, I'd drink it.
"There were some who advocated accommodation,<eos> "who believed the enemy would only be enraged "by outright rebellion.<eos> "But they were outnumbered<eos> "by those who understood that freedom would only come once the enemy had been driven from their land."<eos> That was written by Arthur Manchester.<eos> About the American struggle against the British during our revolution.<eos> But he might as well have been writing about today.<eos> Yeah! I've met our enemy.<eos> I've seen what it's done to our children.<eos> I've looked in its eyes, and I've heard it speak.
He threw me on the floor and then he did.<eos> He threw you on the floor?<eos> Did you blow him?<eos> - Did you blow him or not?<eos> - Of course I did.<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> After the wedding, I'll take the ring back.<eos> Otherwise, my mother will look for it everywhere.
- Of course I did.<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> Did you think about me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> After the wedding, I'll take the ring back.<eos> Otherwise, my mother will look for it everywhere.<eos> To make it a real wedding, I must sleep with the ring on my finger.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - But you'll give it back tomorrow.
My ring with the small diamond has disappeared.<eos> - Did you play with it?<eos> - I never play with your rings.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I'm going to start suspecting everyone.<eos> That means Victor or the cleaning lady.<eos> Obviously, Victor didn't do it.<eos> I trust Monica more than I trust myself.<eos> So I don't get it.<eos> You'll find it back. One day, you put it somewhere without paying attention.
You're never satisfied.<eos> But I'm okay with anything.<eos> I'm like a baby having fun with everything.<eos> I have only questions and no answers.<eos> That's why.<eos> I don't like you when you're a baby.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I get it back.<eos> It is either life or death.<eos> With death, you never give it back to me and you're never at peace.

I understand.<eos> What's with that ring thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You don't know?<eos> It's funny, because I talked with Zoe's mother on the phone.<eos> It's Zoe.<eos> She wanted to marry Max as a joke.<eos> Then she told me she wanted to play at getting married.<eos> She told me she couldn't find the ring back.<eos> Maybe her mother found it?

Do you live alone, with robots?<eos> I see.<eos> No wonder.<eos> Let's go, baby.<eos> More and more young people are choosing robots over marriage.<eos> These so-called "humanoid mates".<eos> With national birth rates at record lows, such social trends are a rising problem.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Why don't I have your report?<eos> I'll file it soon, but... ls there a problem?
You butcher!<eos> Where were you?<eos> Know how much I worried!<eos> Why didn't you take your phone!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you<eos> I have a favor.<eos> Plant me a tree.<eos> Where's the sweater?<eos> I wanna wear it today.
My daughter, my little girl, she's gonna be home soon.<eos> What?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Mike, Mike, Mike...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Give me her phone.<eos> All right, Lydia.<eos> My friends here don't know you like I do so they are very kindly giving you one last chance.<eos> There's your script.<eos> Study it.
Well, then grab me some dirt.<eos> And stop staring at my ass.<eos> Right.<eos> So, 30 of these make a "local network,"<eos> for what exactly?<eos> A magnetometer array.<eos> It'll pinpoint any anomaly that occurs in the park to within a meter.<eos> I don't get it. Why did you apply for this job if you don't really know what it is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Cross gave it to me.
Let's go back, then!<eos> A nice view.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Pasta, pasta or pasta!<eos> Pasta... ls that all you've got?<eos> Well, I don't know how to cook, so... I'll teach you.<eos> Best of luck!<eos> It's impressive.<eos> What?<eos> That salad, the way you prepare it...
You have the file for the Solis motion to dismiss?<eos> Yep, all set.<eos> Main citations are tabbed.<eos> Good.<eos> Go. I'm busy.<eos> Okay, I was just, um... you know, before, um...you--<eos> Are you having a stroke?<eos> What?<eos> My bonus.<eos> Louis didn't have it.
Yep, all set.<eos> Main citations are tabbed.<eos> Good.<eos> Go. I'm busy.<eos> Okay, I was just, um... you know, before, um...you--<eos> Are you having a stroke?<eos> What?<eos> My bonus.<eos> Louis didn't have it.<eos> Well, at least, he said that he didn't have it, so I thought that maybe you, uh...
- So tell me.<eos> - I want to understand.<eos> - No.<eos> You really don't.<eos> Well, fact is you still saved all those people back there.<eos> So obviously there's a part of you that still gives a crap.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> - You wanna hear a joke?<eos> - Sorry?<eos> You'll love it.
Just ask, okay?<eos> Sir...<eos> I apologize for the mess with Ben Matheson.<eos> I didn't mean for the man to die.<eos> Drop the formalities, Tom.<eos> We've been friends too long for that.<eos> I'm promoting you to major.<eos> How would you like to head up intelligence and interrogations?<eos> You've been angling for that job for years.<eos> Now it's yours, if you want it.
Nora!<eos> what--what is going on?<eos> Nora?<eos> {\3cH202020}Nor-- can you give us a minute?<eos> {\3cH202020}Aaron.<eos> {\3cH202020}You've got to warn Miles.<eos> {\3cH202020}I'm putting a bomb on that train.<eos> what--what about Danny?<eos> {\3cH202020}<eos> - More...important? {\3cH202020}so I have to blow it up
Anyway, I need a favour.<eos> I have to present this stupid award thing to Merc.<eos> Right, we just got the invitation.<eos> We don't have to go, do we?<eos> Probably.<eos> It's a good cause.<eos> Which is?<eos> Some opera bullshit. Ah.<eos> Well, anyway, I was wondering if you guys could write me a little something to say.<eos> Just some crap about Merc for when I present it.
You've never noticed? No.<eos> And you're OK with this?<eos> It's the only time he's funny.<eos> Oh, bloody bastard!<eos> What?<eos> He stole my pen. No.<eos> This is my pen.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> I've been looking for it.
HE YELLS IN PAIN Where are the bloody paramedics? !<eos> You don't need paramedics.<eos> It's happened before.<eos> Just pop it back in.<eos> What do you mean, "pop it"?<eos> I can't pop it!<eos> You got to I can't pop it myself.<eos> I'm not going to pop it - you need a doctor to pop it!<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Just grab my arm, pull it out of its socket and pop it back in.
There's a slight angle to the floor in here.<eos> You can't f...<eos> The extra weight of the safe room steel reinforcements can cause the floor around it to decline slightly, creating a slope between one and five degrees.<eos> Sometimes I hate it when I'm right.<eos> For the last time, I loved my wife.<eos> I didn't hurt her, and before this moment, I had no idea there was any safe room in my house.<eos> You get why that's hard for us to believe, don't you?<eos> The place was gutted before Amy and I moved in two years ago.<eos> She oversaw all the construction.<eos> I'm sorry, but, uh, are you saying she had it installed, but never told you?
Another thing.<eos> Saldua's phone records indicate he used his cell phone constantly.<eos> And yet, three days ago, he just stopped.<eos> Didn't make a single call.<eos> Didn't send a single text. Why?<eos> His bank statements meanwhile, there's several checks made out to Dr. Roland Jessup,<eos> He seems worth a talking to, no? No?<eos> No, 'cause he dropped dead of a coronary, 2010.<eos> The Amy Dampier case is over.<eos> You helped solve it.
[ENGINES REVVING]<eos> [TIRES SCREECHING]<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Bruce. You're pushing the car too hard. It's not meant to take it.<eos> I'll coax it.
I hate being old and seeing old people all the time.<eos> You would want to be my age and want to be me.<eos> - No.<eos> - See?<eos> You are disturbing me.<eos> You are boring me.<eos> I am disturbed.<eos> I have an appointment with my hairdresser, and I made a mistake.<eos> My massage therapist is going to arrive and I won't be here.<eos> I will cancel it for you if you give me the number.
I came because...<eos> I have lung cancer.<eos> Stage four.<eos> I'm thinking about suicide.<eos> It's nice of you, Gerard.<eos> Hello, Miss. I am so happy.<eos> I caught a cold, but it's better now.<eos> - They are...<eos> - Working, yes.<eos> To feel the pain come back. It is so acute; it cannot be endured anymore.
If you pay the chalet's rent, we can do it in the most beautiful way you want.<eos> My color's changed?<eos> So I am in progress right now.<eos> After then, I will end up in the archives.<eos> Listen. You can still change your mind.<eos> Until the last moment.<eos> You have to sign the contract now if you don't mind.<eos> The toaster is broken.<eos> How am I going to make foie gras?<eos> I can fix it.
But what about Agathe and Philippe?<eos> There's nothing more to be done this evening. We'll see to it tomorrow.<eos> Goodnight.<eos> Oh my god!<eos> Renaud!<eos> Well, that serves you right...<eos> Open up the cell.<eos> I've already given you a key!<eos> Oh yes, that's right.<eos> Where did I put it?
Yeah.<eos> Yep.<eos> Let me see-- other side.<eos> Try again-- this time don't be afraid of the soap.<eos> Okay.<eos> Incoming.<eos> Hey, hey, hey.<eos> Come on, it's still my house, you know.<eos> Might be, but it's my chicken.<eos> I know it pisses you off, I don't do the job the way you did it.
Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am, can you hear me?<eos> You've been in a car accident and I need you to stay calm and hold still so we can help you out. What's your name?<eos> The name, can you tell me your name?<eos> Abel!<eos> My... my God!<eos> Baby!<eos> Ready?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I've got this.<eos> - You've got it?
Ma'am, can you hear me?<eos> You've been in a car accident and I need you to stay calm and hold still so we can help you out. What's your name?<eos> The name, can you tell me your name?<eos> Abel!<eos> My... my God!<eos> Baby!<eos> Ready?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I've got this.<eos> - You've got it?<eos> - You've got it?
Morning.<eos> What's all this?<eos> Wow.<eos> Are they okay with the hand? Yeah.<eos> I'd finish the rehab up there.<eos> They need a neonatal specialist.<eos> If... we can get through this Otto mess.<eos> Which we will.<eos> I know why you couldn't walk away a few months ago.<eos> The club's been your whole life, you couldn't let it die.
You got something you want to share?<eos> My conscience is clear.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Where do you think he ends up?<eos> Jax?<eos> He's making good choices. Yeah.<eos> And the better they are, the more familiar he'll feel.<eos> He ain't you.<eos> Oh, it ain't about me, it's about that seat.<eos> I know how bad you want it back.
So... um... plus, this baby's got over 25 points of adjustment, yo.<eos> Well, my butt only has two points of adjustment, and they both want my old chair back, yo.<eos> I-I think it's... it's gone.<eos> Here, you know what?<eos> Here's what I'm gonna do for you.<eos> I'm gonna put in a request and, uh, try to get you a different chair.<eos> Where's my old chair?<eos> Well, you know, we donate all of our old furniture to... to one of our charities, so if it's any consolation, it went to a good cause.<eos> It's not. Find out where they took it.<eos> I'll buy it back.
I don't need words.<eos> I know what the earth is thinking.<eos> I know what squirrels are thinking. I mean, like, not, like, you know, crazy like that.<eos> It's just...<eos> I died on that table for eight seconds, Doc.<eos> I'm one of the few who's gone to the other side and made it back.<eos> And what happened on the other side?<eos> I saw an angel... holding a trash bag.<eos> A trash bag?<eos> You know, like, for leaves. And she was just holding it, and I just took all the collected bullshit from the last 20 years and put it into that bag... twist-tied it, and I chucked it into the spiritual dumpster.
And the more that you protest, the less time you're gonna have to get the hang of it.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> You ready?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - All right.<eos> How does this work?<eos> Okay, this cane's a couple of inches too tall for you.<eos> So choke down a little bit.<eos> You're gonna hold it waist high, about a foot in front of your body.
That's the spirit.<eos> You ready?<eos> I'm ready.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - All right.<eos> How does this work?<eos> Okay, this cane's a couple of inches too tall for you.<eos> So choke down a little bit.<eos> You're gonna hold it waist high, about a foot in front of your body.<eos> Think of it as an extension of your index finger, but it should be underneath the shaft.
I'm, uh, sorry this didn't work out the way you wanted.<eos> Oh, it's not about me.<eos> What do you want to happen?<eos> I want A'zam to make a full recovery.<eos> That's all.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm right?<eos> You couldn't have written that article.<eos> Whoever wrote it has courage and vision.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> Hey, Christopher Nolan.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Lens cap.<eos> Oh, crap.<eos> Damn.<eos> Strong work, genius. Dude, I have no idea what to make this movie about.<eos> And I'm, like -- I'm A/V Club President, so, you know, it's got to be good.<eos> Here. Give me that.<eos> I'll tell you what you're gonna make it about. You're gonna make it?
Awesome.<eos> Let's hope he has his papers.<eos> Yeah, and that silver can kill him.<eos> So...what?<eos> Best in show comes here 10 years ago, ganked some poor woman.<eos> Then when the dust settles and everything's in the clear, he just sets up shop?<eos> Yeah, comes for the human hearts, stays for the co-eds.<eos> And then everything's wine and roses -- and animal tickers -- until he gets the hankering for human again.<eos> Told you there was a case here.<eos> Now we just got to find it and kill it.
Hope you plan on cleaning this up.<eos> I need bourbon to get through Rebekah's party.<eos> Yours is better than Stefan's.<eos> Oh.<eos> Top drawer in the dresser.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You keep alcohol in your underwear drawer?<eos> No.<eos> You weren't looking for alcohol, were you?<eos> Do you think I'd actually leave the last remaining white oak stake where any vampire could just walk in and take it?
Paul has an account there under the name Pavel Medved.<eos> Is that it?<eos> You got something better?<eos> All right.<eos> But if you're working any angles, I'll get you on the first plane back to Langley.<eos> And the coffee there?<eos> Not so good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> The tunnel was locked.<eos> They open it for the workers late at night.
Hello?<eos> Deputy director Gibbons, my name is Henry Peck.<eos> I work for you.<eos> This is my daughter's cell phone.<eos> How did you get this number?<eos> I'm sorry to bother you, sir, but someone just tried to kill me.<eos> What?<eos> Now, three weeks ago, you called me off the record to congratulate me on a report that I submitted that led to the high-level arrest of a man named Carlson, but I never heard of a Carlson.<eos> His name was in your report.<eos> But I didn't put it there.
Forgive my disturbing you, great lady.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> I see nothing.<eos> Let's try again with woman's urine.<eos> Get out, before I have you killed!<eos> When Vishnu touched a hot stone it flowed with milk and water.<eos> That may be so. But this is much trickier.<eos> The Chakras of her vision are blocked, Only a strong pain will dissolve the blockage.<eos> "If you can not endure pain" Vishnu once said to a stranger,<eos> "You must try to love it and it will become as gentle... "as the lotus flower.
I'm afraid of blood.<eos> - Me too.<eos> Let's drink that.<eos> As he went along, Jesus saw a man blind from birth.<eos> His disciples asked him: "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents, that he was born blind?"<eos> "Neither this man nor his parents sinned," said Jesus,<eos> "but this happened so that the works of God might be displayed in him. "As long as it is day, we must do the works of him who sent me.<eos> "Night is coming, when no one can work.<eos> "While I am in the world, I am the light of the world."<eos> After saying this, he spit on the ground, made some mud with the saliva, and put it on the man's eyes.
Was it something I said?<eos> Invading my privacy, not okay.<eos> Said the walking, talking professional invasion of privacy.<eos> I am here to work with you.<eos> I thought you understood that by now.<eos> I'm sorry, wasn't it you that said we were supposed to be learning more about each other?<eos> That's how companionship works, is it not?<eos> Is this because of the violin yesterday?<eos> Because I think you made your point when you set it on fire!<eos> Well, I haven't made my point unless you've absorbed it.
- Okay, well, that's a big break.<eos> Yep.<eos> [ loudly ] It was nice to meet you.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, I'm not finished with your letters.<eos> Sit. Have some tea.<eos> Have some tea.<eos> "Cold are the counsel of women." Cold, indeed.<eos> Find anything on the victim's computer?<eos> Nothing useful.<eos> He just used it to play MMOS.
How you holding up?<eos> Well, I was better yesterday.<eos> You and me both.<eos> The explosion is being spun as an auto-recall issue.<eos> The D.C.I.'s put me on the trilateral commission looking into Jai's death.<eos> You're gonna have your hands full with that.<eos> Jai wasn't exactly going out of his way to make friends.<eos> We got a job for you.<eos> In happier days, I would have quipped that I already have a job.<eos> Jai's office at Special Projects-- you're taking it over.
- Why? - I know it seems capricious, but around here, movement is progress.<eos> I want to thank you for your service.<eos> Annie, you're wanted in polygraph.<eos> They think I had something to do with this?<eos> I'm sure it's just routine.<eos> Good luck, Annie.<eos> And you were leaving the diner with Mr. Wilcox?<eos> Yes.<eos> But you forgot your umbrella?<eos> Yes, I went back and got it from the waitress.
Thanks.<eos> I'm a ridiculous cliche-- beyond late.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That, that's okay.<eos> I just got here.<eos> You weren't at the cafe.<eos> You said you'd find me.<eos> Desert wildflowers.<eos> The car's just around the corner.<eos> You fixed it that fast?
At least not yet.<eos> Are you real?<eos> Interestingly... that question can also be. Answered, "not yet."<eos> I promise everything's going to get back to normal, Lydia.<eos> All that you have to do... Is every single thing I ask.<eos> Timing is key here, Lydia.<eos> It all needs to happen by the next full moon.<eos> Do you know what they call the full moon in march?<eos> It's called the worm moon.<eos> They call it that because it's the last full moon of. Winter, and the worms would literally crawl out of the earth. As it thawed.
Uh, polygraphs are inadmissible.<eos> In front of the jury. I'll take a polygraph in front of him.<eos> He's the one I need to convince.<eos> I'm going to need a minute.<eos> You're looking at life in prison.<eos> What Spencer just offered you is a gift.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> I am innocent.<eos> I kind of want to take the polygraph.<eos> And if I take it and I fail, then... I will consider making a deal.
Are you serious?<eos> He was a 12-year-old boy.<eos> When was the last time you saw him?<eos> I haven't seen him since that day.<eos> Don't you wonder what became of him?<eos> All the time.<eos> Then you're in luck, because I know exactly where he is.<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop the train!<eos> Stop it!
You want to save him? He won't make it to the stairs.<eos> You lied to me.<eos> You're gonna regret that.<eos> Your life is a lie. Division is a lie.<eos> I killed for Division.<eos> Innocent blood on my hands.<eos> You're preaching to the choir. I didn't think there was any way to make it right until one person stood up.<eos> Who, Joshua?<eos> You were supposed to tear that place down.<eos> You kept it running!
I don't know who Sarah is, but Liza Abbott is safe.<eos> Her name is Sarah, and if you know what's best for you, you'll return her to me.<eos> She's at Division, and you're welcome to come join.<eos> Everything you did under Percy's orders will be pardoned but you need to stand down and come in.<eos> Listen to you, your tough guy voice it's a wonder you managed to train anyone at all.<eos> It's pathetic.<eos> I didn't lose your job for you, Wade, you did that.<eos> You wanna know what pathetic is?<eos> Pathetic is kidnapping a girl to make up for recruits you no longer have to order around.<eos> I'm gonna give you one order, and one chance to follow it: Release Sarah.
- Who is she?<eos> - What?<eos> Oh. A girl can't watch hockey?<eos> Wh-what did you steal?<eos> Something... Hockey-related.<eos> A certain...trophy.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, not the Stanley cup.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - No. I saw it last year in Boston.
Is that -- is that you?<eos> What's up, boy?<eos> How you doin'?<eos> What you doing here? My Uncle owns the joint.<eos> I'm just here helping out.<eos> Slinging dogs.<eos> No. No, no. I'm a manager.<eos> Yeah. I got in a little trouble, you know, and once you got a record, it's hard to find a job.<eos> Yeah. But you run the joint?<eos> Yeah, I'm running it into the ground.
Any correspondence or information that might help us?<eos> Nothing except some credit card junk mail a couple times a year.<eos> But they were in Hanna's name?<eos> Did she have a credit card or a bank account?<eos> No, she was still a minor.<eos> You got one of those letters?<eos> I threw out another one a couple of days ago.<eos> Probably still in the trash.<eos> Hey, you think it's odd that Alicia Corwin didn't have her hotel key on her person?<eos> Maybe she left it at the hotel.
And I promised you bottomless mimosas at that bistro you love downtown.<eos> You're the one who bailed the other night.<eos> What about tonight?<eos> I promised Gabi a girl's night.<eos> I'm Jack.<eos> You must be the new guy.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Your father doesn't know about your boyfriend, does he?<eos> He wouldn't understand, and you don't either.<eos> One photo opportunity, and you miss it.
- Somebody's looking for him.<eos> - Probably his dad.<eos> Yup.<eos> Annie's already gone.<eos> Anything to tell us where she went?<eos> Finch?<eos> I'm looking.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> If they've got a secret meeting place, she's hidden it well.
I can't decide between a veil or a hat.<eos> I mean, I want to look elegant, but with a, you know, sense of whimsy.<eos> Traditional, but fun.<eos> Maybe they have one of those beer can hats, but for champagne flutes.<eos> That's elegant and fun.<eos> Victoria, my wedding is in three weeks, and you're either part of the problem or you're part of the solution.<eos> Don't upset your sister.<eos> I think the veil you're wearing is gorgeous.<eos> I hate it.
Take this to your future bride.<eos> Sleepy time tea...<eos> always calms her down.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sometimes I find it's helpful to drop an ambien in, just to make sure crazy goes night-night.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Nobody gains weight in prison!<eos> Knock, knock.<eos> Brought you your tea.<eos> Put an ice cube in there so it's not so hot, in case you spill it or it gets thrown.
So who will take care of them if you go away?<eos> I thought we could get 'em together.<eos> And move them back and forth between our apartments?<eos> No.<eos> I thought maybe... you could move in with me.<eos> Wow. - Do you want to move in with me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yes. I mean, I do have this other thing.<eos> - What other thing?<eos> - Well, I don't know. I promised Sophie I'd stay through the lease... and she'll probably want to renew it.
- Yeah. - But Lisa found the place.<eos> - Right.<eos> Does this train go to DeKalb?<eos> We could always look for a place together, if you want.<eos> But it's really hard to find stuff in Tribeca.<eos> I can't afford Tribeca.<eos> I'm not leaving you.<eos> I'm just moving neighborhoods.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I put my ring on my thumb, and I'm having trouble getting it off.
What are you doing?<eos> I put my ring on my thumb, and I'm having trouble getting it off.<eos> Hold your hand above your head.<eos> It'll drain the blood out.<eos> I look like I'm asking a question.<eos> Ow!<eos> Fuck! Fuck!<eos> We bought the kettle together, remember?<eos> At the Mexican superstore?<eos> Jesus! Bring it back!
Touché.<eos> Kens?<eos> The girl.<eos> I got the apartment.<eos> Federal agent!<eos> Manic Pixie Dream Girl?<eos> Slipped away.<eos> For now.<eos> You check that laptop?<eos> I'm going to have it bagged for Eric, let him do the honors.
A poodle? No. Sorry, I don't do poodles.<eos> Huge attitude, un-trainable.<eos> - Actually, they are one of the three most intelligent breeds of dog.<eos> Well, I will have you know that Monty is brilliant and humble.<eos> Monty eats sponges.<eos> - This is true.<eos> - Turner was a high-level CIA agent.<eos> He was trained to live inconspicuously.<eos> There's no way he'd have a dog like that.<eos> Find out where the dog came from and why Turner had it.
I found this in his stomach.<eos> What is it?<eos> Well, there's a yogic practice-- Vastra Dhauti. It's the swallowing of a strip of cloth to cleanse the stomach.<eos> This is not that.<eos> We need to sign this out.<eos> Something shaped like a pipe or a tube.<eos> How big we talking?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The size is the key to the cipher.<eos> If you don't know the circumference of the tube, you can't duplicate it.
It's 8:30.<eos> It's time for your segment with Kristina.<eos> Gotta get you into makeup.<eos> - Um...<eos> - It's okay. I'll take care of it.<eos> Okay.<eos> D-don't solve the case without me.<eos> Look, I wasn't supposed to, okay?<eos> But a few days ago, she showed up with an envelope stuffed with 1,000 bucks, said she needed the chopper only for 20 minutes, and nobody could know.<eos> Did she tell you why she needed it?
The -- the smell.<eos> Okay. The same smell?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's so strong.<eos> That's good. Just stay with it.<eos> Grace, tell me what it smells like.<eos> Sweet.<eos> But it's like a chemical.<eos> It's overpowering.<eos> Okay, if there could be one word to describe it, what would that be?
- You're welcome to come up.<eos> - Yeah, I spend all day inside.<eos> I thought we could get some fresh air.<eos> So what's this about?<eos> Well, it's about giving you the lay of the land.<eos> - Regarding?<eos> - Which I really shouldn't have to do... since my colleagues already told you to stand down. Ah.<eos> Brody.<eos> There's a terrorist event on the horizon.<eos> Nick Brody is essential to our plan for stopping it.
Because we both want the same thing... to get back to your land.<eos> You would say anything to save yourself.<eos> Why are we supposed to believe you now?<eos> I arranged for transport with Cora, but seeing how resourceful you are, I'll offer you the same deal...<eos> I'll help you if you promise to take me along.<eos> How are you going to help us get home?<eos> The ashes will open a portal, but to find your land, she needs more.<eos> There's an enchanted compass.<eos> Cora seeks it.<eos> I'll help you obtain it before she does.
We'll find the compass just over the ridge.<eos> Do you get the feeling he's leading us exactly where Cora wants us, that this whole thing's a trap?<eos> It's definitely a trap.<eos> As long as we know they're trying to play us, we can...<eos> Stay one step ahead of them.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> The compass is up there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So how do we... get to it?
Careful, dearie.<eos> Just remember, whatever it is you traffic in, it comes with a price.<eos> We'll see.<eos> When they say I charge an arm and a leg, that's meant as a figure of speech.<eos> Put it back.<eos> You want me to reattach your arm?<eos> Can you do it?<eos> Of course.<eos> But first, tell me why.<eos> Because I want to use it again.
Thank you, Lancelot, for always looking out for me.<eos> I don't care what you do to me.<eos> I will never tell you where he is!<eos> I know.<eos> That's not why you're here.<eos> Would you bring our guest some water?<eos> Times have been good for you, haven't they?<eos> I can see a light in your eyes.<eos> Cherish that, because that light can die and be replaced by something else... pain.<eos> The only thing you know of pain is how to inflict it.
But I tried to kill your friend.<eos> Actually, she's my mom.<eos> And I have a feeling she can take care of herself.<eos> And I get it. You're not the only one who's been screwing up lately.<eos> What kind of corset is this?<eos> Up here!<eos> Is that it?<eos> Yeah. That's our home.<eos> Where's the lake?<eos> You're looking at it.
My only regret is that I won't live to see you marry Snow.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Lancelot, does a disgraced member of the round table still have the power to perform a wedding?<eos> It would be my honor.<eos> In my kingdom, there is legend of a cup that has the power to grant eternal life.<eos> And so may the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> Good-bye, mother.<eos> Where's the "on" switch?<eos> It's more complicated than that.<eos> We'll have to get it back to the island.
I know what you'll say.<eos> What else could I tell you?<eos> You'll never forgive yourself if you don't see her again.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Now she's saying:<eos> "Mummy and Daddy love you, it won't change a thing."<eos> Yes, I think... She made up her mind.<eos> She'll look for a flat for her and Ninon in September.<eos> Everything's fine then.<eos> "My little darling, once I'm gone, read this letter and pass it on to Christophe and Joëlle.
Fashion design is my art therapy.<eos> So... we really just liked the same fabric?<eos> I better go write my story.<eos> I don't want to forget any details.<eos> No,no,no!<eos> You can't write about this!<eos> Wait!<eos> Maybe she's right.<eos> If you write that article, it'll bring her so much more attention.<eos> Maybe you should just write it about me.
I kept the shop going until he took Jonathan, and he locked him up in that horrible place.<eos> [ sniffles ] Oh.<eos> These are love letters my daughter sent to Artie.<eos> I saved them.<eos> Libby kissed the envelopes.<eos> I thought you might want her DNA.<eos> - I watch a lot of crime shows.<eos> - Thank you, Mrs. Tibbets.<eos> Jane: 12 excessive-force complaints all involving you using a nightstick.<eos> Liked to use it at home, too, didn't you?
Yeah. Neal Armstrong.<eos> Like the astronaut.<eos> One small step for man.<eos> Sophie Covington.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> I don't know how to thank you for what you did.<eos> If there's ever anything that I can do, just please let me know.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> Can I get my hat back?<eos> I don't have it here.
Nice to meet you.<eos> I don't know how to thank you for what you did.<eos> If there's ever anything that I can do, just please let me know.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> Can I get my hat back?<eos> I don't have it here.<eos> We could meet for coffee or...<eos> This is my address.<eos> Come by around 4:00.<eos> And I'll have it waiting for you.
The more I made, the more I gave away, which was just something else for us to fight about.<eos> You have a beautiful home.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I spend a lot of time here.<eos> The media attention, it's just --<eos> Why you took my hat.<eos> Yes, that's why I took your hat.<eos> Hmm, vintage.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I almost hate to give it back.
What's that?<eos> I'm on this high-carb diet thing where you eat cereal in the morning and then pasta the rest of the day.<eos> I lost 12 pounds, but, man, I'm sick of it.<eos> Things we do for health, huh?<eos> My dad was scary?<eos> Yeah.<eos> But in a real calm way, you know?<eos> Which made him even scarier.<eos> He kept a white lion in the house.<eos> I saw him feed a snitch to it once.
Lose the shirt!<eos> This is the best birthday ever!<eos> That castle sucks.<eos> This is where the king and queen live.<eos> My Allosaurus will eat them in a second.<eos> No, no.<eos> Play together, boys, or it's bedtime, all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> We can build the tower.<eos> And I'll get a bug and I'll put it on the tower and torture it.
Not one fractured fairy tale from the good old days.<eos> Not one, "Remember that time I tripped on a leprechaun and..."<eos> You make him look forward. Don't F this up.<eos> I will tell him when I tell him.<eos> - Or I can tell him.<eos> - No!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He's late.<eos> Would you like his latte?<eos> He never drinks it.
FOWKES: Tamers lost the bid.<eos> We've won, haven?<eos> we? The government has awarded a contract.<eos> You mean you...<eos> You've been bought and paid for by Polyhedrus'<eos> Polyhedrus?<eos> SOOMRO: You're confused, Mr Tumer.<eos> Polyhedrus hasn't bid on the dam.<eos> Polyhedrus built the dam for your government.<eos> Might upset people if they knew you were selling it back to them'
We've won, haven?<eos> we? The government has awarded a contract.<eos> You mean you...<eos> You've been bought and paid for by Polyhedrus'<eos> Polyhedrus?<eos> SOOMRO: You're confused, Mr Tumer.<eos> Polyhedrus hasn't bid on the dam.<eos> Polyhedrus built the dam for your government.<eos> Might upset people if they knew you were selling it back to them'<eos> For less than you paid them to build it.
I mean, can't help drawing conclusions, can I?<eos> Try not to, Mr Fowkes.<eos> Tumer claims that Polyhedrus is using the Chinese as a front, buying the dam on its behalf.<eos> He says he has evidence that will stop the sale.<eos> But we don't know what it is.<eos> FOWKES: No, but we have a fair idea where it is.<eos> In that case that he gave Dave Ryder.<eos> That bloody case.<eos> Curse of my life.<eos> You need to find it.
Right.<eos> Proving Polyhedrus poisoned those villagers'<eos> Well it didn't, did it?<eos> FOWKES: Unless that Horst Goebel! Impersonator took them.<eos> Yeah, I think Jack Tumer would have noticed if he'd took receipt of a bunch of rocks.<eos> FOWKES: Then where did those soil samples go?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Take a look.<eos> This is the night Jack takes possession of the case'<eos> He stores it here.
Just make sure you're not in the car when they leave the party.<eos> Don't tell me you're upset about Jack Turner.<eos> It's not Jack.<eos> It's...<eos> That little boy has been through hell.<eos> You care about him, don't you?<eos> What about the case?<eos> You're to retrieve it immediately after.<eos> So he thinks it must be in a wall safe here.<eos> (SIGHS) Three video eyes and none of them found it.
Miss Kent, may I have a word please?<eos> Of course.<eos> You should really drink more liquids, Miss Kent.<eos> There, there you rest now.<eos> I'll take good care of you.<eos> Mr Soomro, right this way.<eos> You must be disappointed, seeing me alive.<eos> I've learnt not to underestimate you, Mr Turner.<eos> You brought the contract?<eos> I did, but I won't sign it.
With so much energy, all of her energy was going into her uncertainty and her fear and unhappiness.<eos> And when I hugged her, it was like holding a...<eos> I don't know if you've ever held a bird in your hand.<eos> You know, it was terrified and you'd just feel its heartbeat.<eos> Do you know what I mean? - Mmm.<eos> She was just shaking. Did you get the sense that she knew she was dying?<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> She knew.<eos> I don't think Diane ever fully realized. We never talked about any of the things<eos> I mean, when she came out of that last operation, I came home one day and she was out in the driveway, scraping down a table so that she could repaint it for the house, you know?
Tell me you hear me.<eos> Shit.<eos> Carrie!<eos> Weigh in here, Saul.<eos> What I'm wondering- What are they doing stopped in the middle of nowhere... next to the only clearing for miles around?<eos> They're loading into a helicopter.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Tell me you hear me!<eos> You - You have to track it. They're about to take off.
You mean the baseball player?<eos> No, the president.<eos> You're gonna pull me off the case-- the homicide-- of a New York citizen to-to be a human shield for a scumbag president of a third-world country whose name you can't even pronounce?<eos> Reagan, no one forced you to take all those special ops, tactical driving, threat assessment spy crap.<eos> Come on, Sarge.<eos> If you didn't want to do it, you shouldn't have showed up.<eos> I did it for the same reason anyone else does it:<eos> for the overtime, but it's my anniversary, Sarge.<eos> Come on, plus I caught a case.<eos> Well, now you uncaught it.
And once the "Colorado's" tridents are airborne, there is not a thing in this world that stops them 'cause somebody kept my daddy from building star wars 20 years ago.<eos> So tell me exactly how you would take out that submarine?<eos> Linus.<eos> What is my favorite deep cover mole in the Defense Department drinking this evening?<eos> - For God sake, Kylie.<eos> - Relax. I could give you a lap dance right here and no one would notice today.<eos> I would.<eos> So what's your news?<eos> Your Perseus prototype?<eos> Chaplin went ahead and tested it this morning, on his own.
Give yourself some slack.<eos> Any news?<eos> He's still in surgery.<eos> Hey, we ran into a Skitter patrol.<eos> But they were heading the other direction.<eos> I think we're safe.<eos> But for how long?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The compass.<eos> Give it to Jimmy when he wakes up.
Ready?<eos> It looks like a... parasite.<eos> One long, two short means it's me.<eos> All clear is two short, one long.<eos> And if you got Skitters following you?<eos> You get the first shot.<eos> Awesome.<eos> Wait, uh, y-you might need this.<eos> Weaver's compass.<eos> Yeah, just don't make me come after it.
I...<eos> It's just myth.<eos> There's no record of a successful attempt.<eos> By the eclipse, if Xiaowei isn't human, she'll die!<eos> Why would a fox demon want to become human?<eos> I was right, wasn't I?<eos> Men only care about beauty.<eos> Even Huo Xin.<eos> I hate your body.<eos> But Huo Xin is desirous Of it.
The police are looking for her.<eos> Can you please pick me up?<eos> Be kind of hard for me right now, and I'm not sure it would be appropriate, Nolan.<eos> Isn't there anybody else you can call?<eos> I tried Lacey, but she didn't pick up.<eos> Is there anybody you can call that actually cares about you?<eos> That's why I called you.<eos> Look, I can't go back to my house.<eos> I gave a key to Athena.<eos> It's kind of ironic because she stuck it in my eye.
What?<eos> No, I totally stopped doing that.<eos> Since when?<eos> Recently.<eos> Like an hour ago.<eos> See?<eos> Under control.<eos> Here you go, everyone.<eos> Oh, elbows off the table, please.<eos> And, sir, if the sun gets too bright in here, feel free to wear your hat indoors. If not, let's take it off, okay? Enjoy.
Hey, dash.<eos> Hey.<eos> Lots of excitement, huh?<eos> Yes, it is. Uh, what do I do with this absentee ballot?<eos> What?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where's Lavon?<eos> I don't know.<eos> May I have your attention, please!<eos> As superintendent of elections, I have examined the ballot, and... And I have declared it valid.
When things calm down, we can talk about it, but right now I should get back.<eos> Sure.<eos> No, no.<eos> It's the generator.<eos> Lourdes, bag him.<eos> Tom, I'm gonna need you to turn these pumps manually, okay?<eos> Doesn't need to be fast, just steady and consistent.<eos> What about the water temperature?<eos> I got the generator.<eos> Let's get it going.
We got three barrels full.<eos> Got two barrels of gasoline, three crates full of 30 weight oil, and a whole mess of fan belts and the like.<eos> Good work, Tector.<eos> There's more where this came from.<eos> We just couldn't carry it all.<eos> Where? Southwest, I think.<eos> Look, I almost gave up, right?<eos> But I had this sort of, like, intuition, and my daddy always told me, he said, "boy --"<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, right now, we got to get this diesel over to the generator and load it up.
Remember what you told me?<eos> Never ask "what if?" And never look back.<eos> 10 minutes, then we roll!<eos> We're gonna keep rolling come hell or high water all the way to Charleston!<eos> 500 miles!<eos> Got just enough gas and supplies to get there.<eos> This is the final push.<eos> We're gonna high-ball it down that black ribbon of highway till we see the blue water of Charleston Harbor!<eos> Yeah, I heard they got fresh fish, even lobster.<eos> Oh, man. I can taste it now, swimming in butter.
It was one of the more frustrating cases I ever worked on.<eos> Uh, we identified four suspects we believe were responsible for the deaths of Kelly and Reed Burkhardt, who I believe were your parents.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I'm sorry. You said four suspects?<eos> Uh, yeah, uh...<eos> Soledad Marquesa,<eos> Hans Roth,<eos> Ian Flynn, and, uh, Akira Kimura.<eos> I'm s... I didn't get that last name.<eos> Could you repeat it?
- Are you the police?<eos> - Chief Wuornos, Haven PD.<eos> Wesley Toomey?<eos> - They took my mother, Roslyn.<eos> Come inside.<eos> There isn't much time.<eos> We're closed until mid-spring, but Mom likes to come in and dust once a month.<eos> I was supposed to meet her.<eos> - Your family owns the inn?<eos> - She inherited it from my grandfather.
I'm not sure we'd put it that way.<eos> I am quite sure we would not.<eos> But I hope you do feel that Mama's fortune has been well spent in shoring up an ancient family.<eos> Ah, you gotta spend it on somethin'.<eos> - What happened here?<eos> - I...<eos> I just...<eos> - You just what?<eos> - There was a mark in it.<eos> Well, I know there was a mark in it, but you didn't need to burn it away.
I thought I was ready to ask you, but I'm not.<eos> I'm not ready.<eos> Ask me what?<eos> I'm sorry to keep you waiting, ladies.<eos> - The fact is, it's not quite as simple.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Mrs Patmore, will you please leave the hysteria to me?<eos> I'm afraid the test was inconclusive.<eos> I had hoped that the fluid from the cyst would be clear, but there are traces of blood in it.<eos> Not enough to confirm the presence of cancer, but a little too much to exclude it.
I suppose I do.<eos> And it doesn't matter that she's fast, or that you won't see her again after she's gone home?<eos> So what?<eos> She made me feel good about myself, Daisy.<eos> I feel good for the first time since I came here.<eos> That's what matters to me.<eos> Alfred, hurry up.<eos> I need you to take round the claret.<eos> All through the rooms?<eos> Won't they spill it on the floor?
I guess when it comes to you, I tend not to think straight.<eos> Can you call me a cab?<eos> Absolutely not. I am taking you home.<eos> Get in.<eos> I apologize for making such a scene.<eos> Just feel better, okay?<eos> Hey, Tommy. Yeah?<eos> I owe you a dance.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You earned it.
-No.<eos> Instead of resigning, he accepts it, and eagerly awaits the next disaster.<eos> He feels cast in a novel that gets more thrilling as things fall apart.<eos> That's what makes the book exciting.<eos> -Doesn't that sound improbable?<eos> -Not really.<eos> -Well, maybe not improbable...<eos> -It's survival.<eos> Accepting pain as part of life.<eos> Embracing it instead of avoiding it.
You'll probably think it's completely idiotic, but I'll say it anyway.<eos> Because I think you're wrong.<eos> You say nobody gives anything away for free.<eos> But I actually believe that sometimes people do things for other reasons than personal gain.<eos> The past days I've seen how concerned mom is about Aunt Inger.<eos> There's genuine and mutual compassion.<eos> And that's precisely what the money represents.<eos> Just like the gooseberry juice.<eos> Auntie knows how much mom loves it.<eos> So she keeps making it for her.
There's genuine and mutual compassion.<eos> And that's precisely what the money represents.<eos> Just like the gooseberry juice.<eos> Auntie knows how much mom loves it.<eos> So she keeps making it for her.<eos> How can anyone drink it?<eos> It's way too sweet!<eos> I think maybe mom finds it a bit sweet as well. She hardly ewer drinks more than one cup.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Aunt Inger keeps making it for mom every year.
I like the view from this window.<eos> All the bare trees. Bleak and beautiful.<eos> Do you ever dream of escaping?<eos> All you new people.<eos> There is no way out.<eos> What if I said I know a way?<eos> You'd be full of shit.<eos> There's a tunnel.<eos> It's real.<eos> I came in through it.
On your mouth, to be exact.<eos> Mmm. I might have been mistaken.<eos> It tastes rich.<eos> Put that wine down.<eos> You look like a streetwalker.<eos> Are you wearing lipstick? Mm-hmm.<eos> It's called Ravish Me Red.<eos> It suits my porcelain complexion, don't you think?<eos> Hand it over. Oh, it's for you, actually.<eos> I hope you don't mind that I tried it first.
I'll make sure you get through the door.<eos> - Just try and wait for me.<eos> - Wait for you?<eos> If you can't, if I don't make it out, make sure you write the story that blows the doors off this place.<eos> Don't forget about me.<eos> Shelley, what are you doing out here?<eos> I got bored.<eos> Yeah, you're always bored.<eos> You need to be in that movie with the others. Go on.<eos> I've already seen it.
Close your eyes.<eos> Put out your hand.<eos> I got you something special.<eos> Come on, Howard.<eos> I'm not falling for that again.<eos> No, here...<eos> Oh, Howie.<eos> A little star.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Put it on me.
Put out your hand.<eos> I got you something special.<eos> Come on, Howard.<eos> I'm not falling for that again.<eos> No, here...<eos> Oh, Howie.<eos> A little star.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Put it on me.<eos> Okay, but I'm going to have to get it back for you so I can take it to the International Space Station.
Excuse me?<eos> But is there any way you could squeeze us in?<eos> See, I'm an astronaut and I'm leaving for Russia on Sunday so I can take a Soyuz rocket to the International Space Station.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> I'll see you there.<eos> I can't believe we're not going to get married.<eos> Excuse me, I'm going to go see if the couple at the front of the line needs a maid of honor.<eos> So, I tell my wife,<eos> "Get a dog, don't get a dog, I'm not walking it,<eos> I'm not feeding it, I'm not picking up after it."
It's like you're looking at her, but there's nothing inside?<eos> I feel like she's just this shell.<eos> All the Arizona's been scooped out... and she's just this shell now, and I want her back.<eos> And I don't think I'll ever get her back if we cut off that leg, so I'm going to save it.<eos> I've made a plan to save it, and you're gonna get on board.<eos> And then we'll work out a plan to get Cristina back, but you need to help me now.<eos> I don't think I'm ever gonna get Cristina back.<eos> You gonna use a free flap to cover the open fracture site?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where are you thinking about pulling it from?
That's a wrap.<eos> Let's go to work.<eos> Hey, kid, take one of those.<eos> I need to talk to you for a second.<eos> Hand those out, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You pick up the roast?<eos> I couldn't;<eos> they changed my tour today.<eos> You said you were gonna get it.

Do you know anything about breaking leases?<eos> Why? You guys thinking about moving?<eos> Nah, it's just, you know, Lou is still kind of freaked out about this place.<eos> Uh, you know, I-I love it here, but...<eos> You want me to take a look at your lease for you?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> Well, so what do you think?<eos> Any wiggle room?<eos> Oh. I don't know.<eos> Gavin drew it up pretty ironclad.
I know you're doubting that right now.<eos> How could you know that?<eos> Because how could she be?<eos> After all these years what are the odds of getting us all back?<eos> If she's still alive, Henrietta, we're gonna find her.<eos> So this is what's left of Columbus Circle.<eos> A travesty.<eos> A travesty.<eos> What did they do to the park?<eos> They paved it to build machines that pump carbon monoxide into the atmosphere.
Out here for all these years fighting for these people, defending them. And at the moment that she needed her father to protect her, I couldn't do it.<eos> And I wanted more than anything for that not to be true.<eos> And in the state of mind that I was in that meant at all costs.<eos> Including us.<eos> Come with me.<eos> This is Anil.<eos> It's an honor to meet you.<eos> What we have here is a Transilience Thought Unifier, Model-11.<eos> So, what's it do?<eos> Turn it on.
Hell of a mess we're giving you.<eos> Yeah, we just came from down there.<eos> You did a fine job securing the location.<eos> Yeah, we appreciate it.<eos> What do you got for us?<eos> All the prelim we could get.<eos> Look, we might be able to be of some help.<eos> That's okay, detective, we'll take it from here.<eos> Security guard's truck was stolen last night from the docks.<eos> If this killer's driving it, we'll get him.
The rest was destroyed in the wesen wars of 1285.<eos> Okay, now I have a headache.<eos> Nick...<eos> They know you have the key.<eos> - Who?<eos> - The royal families.<eos> They're the only ones powerful enough to send the mauvais dentes.<eos> Now my guess is, they want the key, and they want you dead.<eos> How would they know I have a key?<eos> I haven't shown it to anyone.
So you want a little Grimm time?<eos> Yeah. I could probably help you with that.<eos> I think I found just what you need.<eos> Says here this Grimm captured this Siegbarste with his trusty crossbow and an arrow filled with schlaftrunk, which is basically a sleeping toxin.<eos> He was able to subdue the big fella with one shot to the neck.<eos> And they were able to keep him alive?<eos> Uh, yeah. Just long enough to draw and quarter him, which is not actually as easy as it seems.<eos> You need a lot of ropes and chains and, like, a minimum of four horses, but all you need is some schlaftrunk.<eos> Let's hope your aunt has some.<eos> Got it.
Those you learn to live with.<eos> Now let's get out of here.<eos> Not without her.<eos> No one's come out since we got here.<eos> There were shots fired about four minutes ago that could've come from anywhere down here, the, uh, what do you call it... grab gewolbe, the burial vaults.<eos> Okay, Danke.<eos> Send me in first.<eos> I'll be less obvious than a bunch of cops.<eos> I started this job.<eos> I'd like to finish it.
"The same rules work everywhere".<eos> So that was the arrogance of that moment.<eos> The State Department funded through Harvard University a fairly small group of economists and lawyers, to manage this transition for the Russians.<eos> The transition includes the biggest experiment in privatization in the history of mankind.<eos> An experiment that will lead a nation to utter disaster.<eos> For one, two million dollars you could buy an enterprise where only steel constructions were so costly, that could be hundreds of million of dollars or billion of dollars.<eos> Like huge factories in the Urals, in Siberia, in central Russia, former military industrial enterprises, chemical enterprises, steel enterprises and so on.<eos> In the centre of Moscow, there is the hotel "Central", a 19th century beautiful building.<eos> They were going to sell it for the equivalent in rubles of 1.000 dollars.<eos> So we came there, in the foyer, in the lobby, there was a huge chandelier of the 19th century... and we asked a specialist... how much would he pay for it, if it was offered.
And the war at home was a war against trade unions.<eos> She was explicitly referring to the coalminers.<eos> In an extraordinarily violent way the Thatcher government just beat down that union.<eos> It was some of the most violent attacks on trade unions in the western world.<eos> Thatcher's Britain is a typical case of how the infringement of labor laws and the violation of workers' rights coincided with an increase in repressive measures.<eos> I still hate Thatcher<eos> It is characteristic that, nowadays, according to British law, when more than four people are picketing outside a workplace, the protest can be banned... because it can affect the morale of those working in the company.<eos> Neoliberalism, which promises less state control, demands a strong state mechanism in order to be implemented.<eos> We should never forget that neoliberalism is an ideology.<eos> I don't mean this as just dismissing it.
It also pays contractors for works that are never delivered.<eos> There is a certain deliberateness.<eos> We degrade our national wealth to slander it after its degradation, and convince Greek public opinion that maybe a private company .is a far better solution for the Greek railways.<eos> In the name of rationalisation, the government further degrades the railways.<eos> It cuts personnel at the expense of quality, increases prices by over 60% and closes a large section of tracks. Especially in the section between Argos-Tripoli-Kalamata several million euro were invested.<eos> And today there are no trains there.<eos> When counting only profits or losses, the privatization advocates forget that the railways are first of all a service for the citizens.<eos> A service paid by generations of Greek taxpayers.<eos> There was a time in Greece when private debts were nationalised but today there is an effort to privatize the profit that the citizens could enjoy through public services.<eos> What did private companies invest in this sector in order to buy it at a price much lower than its value?
You can help by lessening her duties.<eos> - But you can't tell me how serious it is?<eos> - I'm afraid not.<eos> Even if I knew, which I don't... yet.<eos> Good day to you, Mr Carson.<eos> I had a telephone call from Charkham earlier.<eos> - Charkham?<eos> - Reggie Swire's lawyer.<eos> It seems the death certificate has arrived from India.<eos> - He wants to bring it here.

- Why not eat with us? - Oh, I couldn't do that.<eos> Daisy won't sit down, the invitation is not in your gift.<eos> She eats with Mrs Patmore in the kitchen.<eos> Fancy a game of something later?<eos> Daisy's busy.<eos> - I want to write a letter.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - I'll play.<eos> - Let's see how we feel.<eos> What do you mean you've read it?
I was quite touched.<eos> Am I interrupting?<eos> No, please, I just want to ask you all something.<eos> - I'm sorry I've not been up.<eos> - Don't worry, I'll change after luncheon.<eos> I had to catch you when you were all together.<eos> - How can we help, My Lady?<eos> - It's a funny thing.<eos> Mr Crawley has heard Miss Swire sent a letter on the day she died.<eos> If so, someone must have posted it for her and we wondered if it were any of you.
Try not to worry.<eos> I'll try, but I won't succeed.<eos> That's it, I'll put the hat on later.<eos> Go straight to Lady Edith.<eos> You look marvellous.<eos> I feel marvellous.<eos> That is, I feel marvellous because we don't have to leave Downton.<eos> Lavinia did write to her father and it was posted from this house.<eos> In other words, every word Mr Swire wrote in that letter was true.<eos> Daisy posted it. The kitchen maid.
The difficulty is, she may not want to accept Bates' innocence.<eos> Doesn't she have to?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> She may think he drove his wife to suicide and deserves to rot in prison.<eos> In short, she may not wish to tell the truth to set him free.<eos> Then we need to get a statement from her before she finds out it could overturn the case.<eos> I'll telephone Murray tonight.<eos> He can come up here and talk to you and see Bates.<eos> You were right, though.<eos> The proof was out there and you've found it.
You're nouveau smart.<eos> I've been smart my whole life.<eos> I just happened to be a good-looking athlete that didn't need to use it to get girls.<eos> But I've always had that bullet in the chamber.<eos> Just waiting for my looks to fade.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> Charlie, double-shot latte.<eos> I'm sorry, Allie, but I ordered a double-shot espresso.<eos> Would you mind drinking this anyway?<eos> 'Cause if you return it, then I got to pay for it.

Get in the car. Back in the car!<eos> We can't leave here without getting what's in there.<eos> Carrie.<eos> I got you.<eos> My name is Nicholas Brody.<eos> By the time you watch this, you'll have read a lot of things about me.<eos> This way.<eos> Now.<eos> That briefcase is clearly marked as a diplomatic bag.<eos> Do not open it.
- from the more peaceful protesters.<eos> - Your Honor, you can't just feed the foundation into the record.<eos> Which is why I'm asking the question of Officer Mallen.<eos> Overruled.<eos> So, Officer Mallen, you saw a red sticker on Tyler Beacham's backpack, didn't you?<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't see this?<eos> That's you right there in the video, and you didn't see it?<eos> The red sticker right there.<eos> - I didn't see it.

You see that there?<eos> You see the smile?<eos> - Yeah, I-I can see that.<eos> - Good.<eos> Now let's fast-forward a bit.<eos> After you pepper-sprayed Tyler and sent 1,400 volts through his body and after he died, there, look. What's missing from his backpack?<eos> What isn't there any more?<eos> I understand why you don't want to answer.<eos> The button isn't there any more.<eos> - Because you removed it?
- Objection... argumentative.<eos> I'm merely asking the question.<eos> - You are not.<eos> - You removed the red button because you made a mistake and you were trying to cover your tracks.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Isn't that correct?<eos> He charged at me. What does it matter about the sticker?<eos> Who cares whether it's gone?<eos> It was there before.<eos> But you said you didn't see it before.
Aah! Doctors call pain "the fifth vital sign,"<eos> but unlike the other four, you want it to stop.<eos> Careful of your sutures.<eos> No, you know what? It is not the surgery.<eos> That is really sore,<eos> But it's nothing compared to the pain...<eos> That's why he came to me in the first place, right, this pain of his?<eos> There's pain in his lower quadrant.<eos> Is it possible that the catheter punctured his bladder?<eos> We had a hard time getting it in.
I'm sorry, I, uh...<eos> Come on, it hasn't been that long, has it?<eos> - Jeanine! - Yes!<eos> - Right, the... the... the reunion.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How... how are you?<eos> It's been a long time.<eos> I'm doing good.<eos> I like your place.<eos> Do you run it with your wife?
You're thinking about stopping her, right?<eos> It's the way that it has to be.<eos> And deep down, you know that that's true.<eos> What exactly do you want from me?<eos> Aha! The day after the Colorado Kid died, a young woman went missing.<eos> A few months later, body was found not far from our old fishing shack.<eos> - Where we found Tommy.<eos> - The coroner's report stated that the woman's body was badly scalded, or maybe burned by chemicals.<eos> That's why Tommy said he liked the place.<eos> Sorry he had to burn it down.
Yeah, all clear upstairs.<eos> Down here too.<eos> Dwight's taking Jeanine and Robert someplace safe. Being together and finally being able to accept each other for who they really are?<eos> I think that should help Robbie from appearing again.<eos> Well, here's to that.<eos> And to being able to legally drink again.<eos> You were cute as a teenager.<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Meteor storm starts soon.<eos> For a second there, I didn't know if I was gonna live to see it.
It never came up.<eos> I did all I could for him on dry land, then I sent him to Daphne at the swim center.<eos> She has a way with the... Scaredy-cats.<eos> Oh, and you left this at my place. I didn't want you to think you lost it.<eos> Audrey?<eos> Audrey, can you hear me? What?<eos> You totally zoned out.<eos> You could have had a small seizure. No.<eos> I remembered.<eos> That day on the beach, I actually remembered it.
That's great.<eos> I was Lucy.<eos> I could feel being Lucy.<eos> That's never happened to me before.<eos> Okay, Aud, got to go.<eos> Hey, Nathan.<eos> Claire.<eos> Tooth.<eos> From a Porbeagle shark.<eos> Lucassi dug it out of Alice's leg.
It's not a person, it's a meteor storm.<eos> It comes every 27 years, and when it does I disappear.<eos> - You told him everything?<eos> - Yeah, we're friends. Is that a problem?<eos> Stay away from her.<eos> They call themselves the Guard.<eos> I need to know what your people are doing, and what I'm involved in.<eos> My people help the troubled, and we do it any way we can.<eos> I am one of you now.<eos> I heard his first name, I matched it with a facial composite.
Depravity and obscenity personified.<eos> Look, Cherubin.<eos> A gold button, with a crest designed for me, hand-made.<eos> This beauty is not the result of chaos, but of the combination of what is right and what is good.<eos> They reward virtue.<eos> Virtue generates wealth.<eos> Wealth allows society to work for the general interest.<eos> It's the divine order, the genius of capitalism.<eos> Keep it safely in your pocket.<eos> And when you need strength to bring the dragon down, hold it tight in your hand.
Rule number two, always keep your cool.<eos> You've made a mistake, face up to it, accept it.<eos> You can make more, by taking risks now.<eos> The market is here, let's wait.<eos> How did Uncle take it?<eos> I said I had to know the traders' world to legislate about them.<eos> I'll never be a trader, I don't have your flair.<eos> I want to ban this word, "flair".<eos> I can't stand this word!<eos> It's not about having flair for the market, it's about leading it.
That's not what I meant.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> But that would be another conversation in a different room.<eos> What would that cost?<eos> How would you judge a man you could buy within five minutes of meeting him?<eos> I wouldn't trust him for a second.<eos> Well, then, we are face to face with paradox.<eos> Consider me an admirer, Mr. Thompson.<eos> Ordinary men avoid trouble.<eos> Extraordinary men turn it to their advantage.
Are you looking to rent?<eos> East of the park would suit you better.<eos> What are you implying?<eos> She's a charming and vivacious young woman.<eos> - Prudence.<eos> - Yes, ma'am?<eos> Mr. Thompson has a morning suit.<eos> The striped trousers and cutaway jacket.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> No, but I'm sure I can find it.

So, what was that back there?<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it didn't look like nothing.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight, okay?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We will.<eos> Okay.<eos> That rabbit's foot looked familiar.<eos> Yeah, think you gave it to me around the same age.
Gino is just some guy that I see around the office, except for, in my office, they rub us down - with baby oil before we start.<eos> - Yeah, I-I get that.<eos> Look, your business is selling sex.<eos> Sure, you're a sex worker.<eos> You're an idiot. If we leave right now, I can get back to Caroline by 8:00.<eos> Caroline?<eos> Yeah, I-I changed my mind.<eos> Gonna move in.<eos> Yeah, and I actually don't even care about this truck.<eos> I'll come back and get it tomorrow.
You're wrong.<eos> Uhh. I found a laptop in Michael's bag, Helena.<eos> Everything that could send your father and me to prison for the rest of our lives was on it.<eos> That computer-- was mine.<eos> Michael wasn't the one talking to the FBI.<eos> You?<eos> My father is a monster.<eos> He doesn't care who he hurts to keep his money and power, and I wanted it to stop.<eos> Well, then it's your fault Michael's dead.<eos> Not your father for ordering the hit or me for carrying it out.
Anker's a teacher in the public school system, and one of his students has been brutally murdered.<eos> We need to be careful.<eos> If we're wrong about him, we could destroy his career.<eos> He has no alibi for last night.<eos> We have no hard evidence to move on.<eos> If we move too soon, we could tip him off.<eos> What about Brandon's family or friends?<eos> So far it doesn't look like the kid had any enemies, but they are competing against each other, and that's a lot of pressure.<eos> Apparently, this decathlon is big.<eos> You win it, and the Ivy leagues come looking for you.
You need to continue with me.<eos> Need?<eos> You have no idea what I need.<eos> Look, I will also say that Kate is a highly-trained professional, and certainly a most capable therapist.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go.<eos> I'm having dinner with the monkey-armed bitch.<eos> - Hey. - Look, I got the good table.<eos> That's great.<eos> Did you steal it from somebody else?<eos> After they spent years on it trying to make it a better, more well-adjusted table?
When we got here, I thought that if you put a fridge and a hob in my room in Paris, you could rent it for at least 600 euros a month.<eos> Because... I've seen a small studio in the neighbourhood and it's quite nice.<eos> It's a good idea.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> The ball.<eos> Over there.<eos> There.<eos> "It had kicked and quivered and she had known.<eos> Now she could say his name and she said it.
Brad?<eos> Is that you?<eos> It's me.<eos> It's so good to see you.<eos> We thought you were dead.<eos> Did you hide the pendant?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We have friends here.<eos> Some of the guards are with the rebels.<eos> If you tell me where it is, the rebels can go and get it... Before Monroe does.

Blair, I just got invited to the Institute of Arts and Letters' summer artists retreat.<eos> That's incredible!<eos> But what could possibly be the problem, besides Rome in August?<eos> I need your photographic memory and your passion for social upheaval to help me write the book about the Upper East Side.<eos> My computer's gone.<eos> It's Gossip Girl.<eos> She took it.
I told George that I needed time to think.<eos> Think about what?<eos> (Laughs)<eos> Ah, uh.<eos> Yup. You know, this happens sometimes.<eos> A woman will mistake finally having good sex for a connection.<eos> Last night, something happened between us.<eos> Yeah, well, you had A-plus sex for your first time.<eos> What do you mean I had A-plus sex?<eos> You had it, too.
Why doesn't anyone just go up and grow some more?<eos> Because one giant survived.<eos> The strongest and most terrible of them all.<eos> Now we'll have to get past him to...<eos> The magic compass.<eos> Indeed.<eos> The treasure remains, and amongst it is the compass.<eos> Now it will guide us to your land.<eos> Cora has the means to open a portal with the wardrobe ashes, but she can't find your land without the compass.<eos> Once we get it, we steal the ashes from her, then we're on our way.
Can you just see that she gets it?<eos> Sure.<eos> And one more thing.<eos> If anything changes, like she does her job, this insanity ends, if she's free...<eos> I'll send you a postcard.<eos> I'm not what you think!<eos> You're a thief, and you poisoned me, so, yeah, I'm pretty sure you're exactly what I think.<eos> No!<eos> You have a compass.<eos> I need it!
Don't you have a family?<eos> No, because humans killed them all.<eos> Nice security system.<eos> Efficient.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I can tell by your face, you know what this is.<eos> Let me guess, it's dipped in some sort of poison.<eos> You have a compass.<eos> I need it.
Over a dozen businesses suffered major property damage in...<eos> This whole thing's gonna get out of control.<eos> He needs to say something to the public.<eos> I'd settle for his just being around. ...Prompting some to call for citywide increase in police presence.<eos> Bark of the iboga plant... medicinal tea... we discussed... hallucinogenic.<eos> Ezra: Won't work.<eos> Poison.<eos> Mind... don't take it...<eos> lose.<eos> The tea... you have to drink it.
The riots may be over...<eos> You piece of shit.<eos> But not the fallout. What do you want, money?<eos> No, that's a vile accusation!<eos> "What do you want, Barbara?" - ( Electricity crackling )<eos> - Oh, there's my girl.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - That makes two of us.<eos> Where'd you get the urine?<eos> Where did I get it?
Right.<eos> A woman?<eos> Women can strangle people.<eos> Oh, believe me, I know I could.<eos> Where's Cho and Rigsby?<eos> I got a line on Rex Lango finally.<eos> Changed his name.<eos> Used to be Erzat Lonagul out of Bakersfield.<eos> Cho and Rigsby drove down there to speak to his family.<eos> Nobody could say his name, so he changed it to Rex.
Good to see you, too.<eos> Everybody's gonna go home to their families if they don't do anything stupid.<eos> Who here can open the vault?<eos> I can.<eos> I can.<eos> Get up!<eos> Get in the back!<eos> Get the bags.<eos> Go!<eos> Open it.
Is that 70 inches?<eos> Expensive.<eos> Mom's got glaucoma.<eos> Your van--it was ten years old and in bad condition.<eos> That's an odd vehicle to steal, isn't it?<eos> And suddenly you have the cash to buy a new TV?<eos> Listen, the longer you lie to us, the worse it's gonna be.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> It wasn't stolen.<eos> I sold it.
That's just drunk.<eos> Say, where'd you put that bottle?<eos> It's in my drawers.<eos> Why don't you have a look?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> - Get your hat.<eos> - Please. What?<eos> Your hat, put it on.
You shouldn't be in places like this, neighbor.<eos> I got talked into it.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> Pay the fine direct to me, and we'll leave it at that.<eos> - Pay you the fine?<eos> - That's how it works.<eos> You must be a pitiful salesman if this is all you got on you.<eos> Don't let me see you here again.<eos> So they load the coffin in the ship, right?<eos> And there's this scene, it moves around all by itself. No one's touching it.
You mustn't ever tell Debra the truth about yourself.<eos> If you think she's upset now, that's nothing compared to how she'd feel if she learned what you are.<eos> Dexter, what the fuck?<eos> You said Travis came at you with a sword.<eos> Where did you get the knives?<eos> There was a roll of them.<eos> I'm just trying to put this together.<eos> Are you a serial killer?<eos> Yes.<eos> I've dreaded this moment my whole life. But I never pictured it like this.
You're Uncle Miles?<eos> Underwhelmed? No, I just...<eos> I mean, I didn't expect...<eos> Come on.<eos> Not in here.<eos> No funny business now.<eos> No, ma'am.<eos> I'm not...<eos> What happened?<eos> Well, if you're gonna have an asthma attack, at least you had the good sense to have it near me.
The real Mona Lisa, where she's topless.<eos> Vatican City.<eos> Alaska.<eos> Palin and a bridge to nowhere?<eos> No thanks.<eos> All right, the moon.<eos> - You're bidding the moon?<eos> CROWLEY:<eos> Yeah.<eos> Claimed it for hell.
I mean no. I asked him: "Where are you going"<eos> and he said...<eos> "Never mind."<eos> -OK, and then?<eos> -He closed the door. He closed the door?<eos> How could you see if he closed the door?<eos> It wasn't shut properly and reopened.<eos> Just like now.<eos> I can see from here.<eos> He knelt down, took the note in his pocket and slipped it under the pillows.
He offered 500,000.<eos> I told him we're not budging from six million, right?<eos> Yes, this has been hard, hearing him say we're greedy.<eos> The more they call you names, the more you know you're winning.<eos> Would you excuse me a second?<eos> You almost done?<eos> Yup, in another ten minutes, we'll no longer occupy the 27th floor.<eos> How'd it look?<eos> Sad.<eos> We'll get it back, Will.
No.<eos> The plan was just to knock on his door, and he would let me in.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> Was anybody else with you in the elevator when you went up?<eos> No, I made sure I was alone. I didn't want anyone else to see me.<eos> Of course.<eos> How did you get the concierge key?<eos> How did I...<eos> The concierge key...<eos> how... how did you get it?
Etta was very special to me.<eos> And when Phillip told me...<eos> I wanted to reach out to you so much, but I was afraid that I would jeopardize your safety.<eos> I know.<eos> But now we have no choice.<eos> We need your help, Nina.<eos> Of course.<eos> Anything.<eos> Well, despite the damage to the building, we still think that the underground storage is intact.<eos> We just can't get to it.
He told me that you agreed to remove the pieces of his brain once he completed the plan to defeat the Observers.<eos> Never underestimate the power of incentive.<eos> You don't approve?<eos> What happens to him?<eos> After the tissue has been removed, what happens to Walter?<eos> How many times can a human brain endure something like that?<eos> Walter told me that that was a risk that he was willing to take.<eos> I don't accept that.<eos> You may not have to.<eos> If the plan isn't completed in time, he may regress completely and no longer want to go through with it.
Even the devil himself didn't want you.<eos> The only devil here is you.<eos> And don't pretend for one moment that you didn't try to murder me.<eos> Is that the story you're telling yourself?<eos> I tried to save your life.<eos> I warned you not to get onto that plane.<eos> You simply failed to tell me why.<eos> Are you telling me you would've listened?<eos> Agree to disagree.-...<eos> Just know, if there'd been any other avenue, I would've taken it.
Hey, you're never gonna believe this.<eos> I think Bryce Woodbridge is the one.<eos> Fabulous. Hire him, say good-bye and let's have lunch.<eos> Oh, um, actually Bryce is a her.<eos> She... oh. Bryce, this is my wife Naomi.<eos> Oh. I think thanks to her that we found the perfect replacement for the CEO position.<eos> Well, so nice to meet you.<eos> Nice to meet you, too.<eos> Bryce-- interesting name.<eos> I hate it.
Mwa! Ciao.<eos> These are amazing.<eos> Where did you get them?<eos> Uh, I pulled some strings with Liam's wardrobe department, and they seriously hooked us up.<eos> Dixon forgot his cell phone again.<eos> He's been waiting to hear back from his doctor.<eos> What?<eos> It's a text from Neil Lane.<eos> "The setting on the ring you ordered is ready.<eos> You can pick it up anytime."
She's my, uh... private security.<eos> Hi, Annie.<eos> You should be good from here, Liam, but, uh, once we get inside, I'll be close by in case you need anything, okay? Okay.<eos> Actually, uh, I guess I have an extra ticket.<eos> You want to sit with us? Sure.<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Since when did you have a bodyguard?<eos> She's not a bodyguard. She is from the studio to keep away the paparazzi.<eos> From your body... by guarding it?
You still on the team?<eos> Job needs doing, I'll keep doing it. Good.<eos> I'll call Leeds.<eos> Sorry, colonel, the encryption is distorting. Um...<eos> How's that?<eos> Oh, that is better.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I've gotten feedback on your action plan, lieutenant.<eos> Well, I-I'm flexible on the details, sir.<eos> We're going to approve it on a conditional basis.
I must become something else.<eos> Previously on "Arrow"...<eos> The company Mrs. Queen invested in doesn't exist.<eos> Tempest purchased a warehouse in Starling City.<eos> Oliver, this is my daughter, Helena.<eos> The Starling City vigilante comes and goes as he pleases, doesn't he?<eos> How did you know?<eos> The minute I saw your eyes.<eos> It's your fault Michael's dead.<eos> Not your father for ordering the hit or me for carrying it out.
Salducci's Pizza.<eos> Salducci!<eos> Sure.<eos> It's an institution.<eos> Before I met your grandmother, I used to eat there maybe two, three times a week.<eos> And the best slice in the city.<eos> I bet it was free back then, too, huh?<eos> Mm. What's the beef with Salducci?<eos> Uh, brother and sister who own the place had a falling out.<eos> She goes and buys a pizza truck, parks it right out front, to break his chops.
There needs to be more squealing.<eos> I can squeal if you want me to.<eos> That sounds dirty and inappropriate.<eos> Oh, which I hear is your specialty these days.<eos> I brought a tater tot hot dish.<eos> You didn't?<eos> Rina also brought tater tot hot dish.<eos> It's pop pop's favorite.<eos> Oh, I know it is, love.<eos> That's why I brought it.
Well, you've been working with pigs.<eos> Maybe she's worried you'll slaughter someone out of habit.<eos> So have you thought about the settlement?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Oh... I don't know.<eos> Whatever everybody else wants to do.<eos> I'm a team player, Mer.<eos> Apparently, so am I.<eos> We were able to restore blood flow to your daughter's foot.<eos> So it looks like we're gonna be able to save it.
You're lying!<eos> This is happening, Mr. Jones.<eos> They're using you.<eos> As what -- some kind of a damn psychic coppertop?<eos> You plug me in, and the whole world goes wacky?<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> How would you know?<eos> No offense, but it seems to me like you've been spending more time in here than you have... Out there.<eos> You want to know what's the worst thing that can happen to a guy who's got a mind like I got?<eos> Losing it.
But tell him he's got to take us to where he lives.<eos> I need to book a flight... The next flight to Portland, Oregon.<eos> They're asking if he's found Rafael.<eos> Tell him we need to get inside the house.<eos> They really love their Halloween.<eos> Dia de Los muertos...<eos> Day of the dead.<eos> Rafael?<eos> Rafael?<eos> All right, if there's an answering machine, we need to listen to it, and we need to check out Rafael's room.
Yeah?<eos> Which is what?<eos> The US under martial law, with you sitting on a Hamptons throne somewhere letting the peasants eat cake? Yeah. Maybe.<eos> Look, you could have told me this on the phone.<eos> - Why are you here?<eos> - The order. 998.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> It's wiped clean.<eos> Okay.<eos> If they're worried Chaplin is gonna use my prototype against them, who better to figure out how to help them defeat it than the people who made it?
It's a name.<eos> Don't look like English.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's ancient Aramaic.<eos> Miles.<eos> That name on the wall... How do you know it?<eos> Name?<eos> Is that what it is?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't even read it.

Hey.<eos> I want to apologize for going off on you this morning.<eos> No need.<eos> Really?<eos> Water under the bridge.<eos> Which, coincidentally, is where I had to park my car.<eos> Well, I appreciate that.<eos> And, uh, just FYI, pigeons nest under there.<eos> My car already looks like it's covered in mashed potatoes.<eos> I'll get it washed for you.
I mean, if he's done this before, he knows how to cover his tracks.<eos> What about his juvie record?<eos> A couple of fights, stole a neighbor's car.<eos> Nothing that explains this.<eos> So then all we have is the neighbor's ID?<eos> That's not enough to make a case.<eos> I think I might have found something that can help,<eos> Something Kurtzman may have missed.<eos> A diamond earring?<eos> We found it in the couch.
Objection, Your Honor.<eos> This is a wiretap of my client speaking with his wife.<eos> - Therefore, it is subject to spousal privilege.<eos> - Your Honor, Mrs. Foster was a coconspirator.<eos> Therefore, the spousal shield...<eos> Mr. Stabler can assert conspiracy all he wants,<eos> - but there has been no evidence.<eos> - The evidence<eos> - is being gathered.<eos> - Well, then gather it, - and then submit the tap.
- Socko.<eos> ...socko.<eos> Hey, Mom, they're talking about your case.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Mom's in the kitchen.<eos> I'm sure she'd love to talk to you, Jackie.<eos> Okay.<eos> Only one pill.<eos> And no alcohol.<eos> So, I looked at this case, and when I saw it, all I saw was that you were taking this to the Supreme Court.
I'm sorry, you can't be all that interested in - an app for clothes.<eos> - Well, no, no...<eos> I also have an app for hair.<eos> - Oh, well, no... you know...<eos> - I'm just kidding, I don't.<eos> But look. Fireflies.<eos> Oh...<eos> Can I have your corkscrew?<eos> Well, not now.<eos> We haven't even used it yet.
When have I ever denied you anything?<eos> That's Ben.<eos> Do not disappoint me.<eos> You sure are a pretty little thing, Vicky.<eos> A little glimpse of what your mama must have looked like when she was around your age.<eos> What are you now, 20, 25?<eos> 15.<eos> Victoria.<eos> Would you pour the coffee, please?<eos> Thomas and I will take it in the living room.
Do I?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I need to do this on my own.<eos> If I fail, I fail.<eos> If I pass, I pass.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> I'm sorry. I was just trying to help.<eos> Yeah, well, next time don't.<eos> Oh, and since you like stories so much, this is not "The Shoemaker and the Elves," okay?<eos> This is, "Give a man a fish, he eats it.

Whatever, I don't know!
That's usually me.<eos> Walden, I'm not going to date you.<eos> Oh, no, I-I don't want you to date me.<eos> What if I hired you to play the role of my girlfriend?<eos> You think I'm a hooker? !<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> No sex.<eos> Uh, you know, take sex off the table.<eos> In fact, take it off the table, the car, the floor, the bed, the windmill at the putt-putt golf course.
Where is he?<eos> Are those...<eos> Diamonds.<eos> They're back.<eos> The magic brought them back.<eos> You mean the kind that become fairy dust? Indeed.<eos> We just need to refine them, grind them up.<eos> Do you still have what remains of Jefferson's hat?<eos> You will lock this up.<eos> Keep it safe.
No.<eos> Why are you building a cage?<eos> Tonight's the first full moon since the curse broke.<eos> It's the first night of Wolfstime.<eos> I thought you'd figured out how to control the wolf in you ages ago.<eos> Yeah, but, thanks to the curse, I haven't turned in 28 years.<eos> I might be rusty.<eos> I can't let what happened last time, what happened to Peter, happen to anyone else.<eos> What about your red hood? That could keep you from turning.<eos> If I had it.
She's been lying to you ever since she stole you away from me when you were just a baby.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> Because she didn't want you to find out the truth about who you really are.<eos> She believed the wolf is something to be ashamed of.<eos> I see things differently.<eos> Humans want us to believe we are the monsters.<eos> The moment you believe them, that's when you become one.<eos> You're not the first to learn the truth about yourself through tragedy.<eos> So many of us spend so much of our life suppressing the wolf.<eos> They have no idea how to control it. (EXHALES)
He said to meet him by Tree-ona.<eos> Mitchell!<eos> Lily!<eos> Where is he?<eos> Up here!<eos> Look up here!<eos> Cam, what are you doing up there?<eos> I came down to say goodbye to the tree, give it one final hug, and before I knew it, I was up here.<eos> When you say "one final hug"...<eos> If I'm occupying the tree, they can't cut it down.
- Yeah, hang on one second.<eos> Listen, this is not just your pregnancy.<eos> You are purposely turning your brain off.<eos> You have to at least try to pay attention.<eos> - Ma'am?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Do you have a receipt for that sweatshirt?<eos> Oh, shoot.<eos> I'm gonna need you to come back into the store.<eos> Oh, no. No, it's-- I forgot I was wearing it.
It's no big deal.<eos> Here.<eos> Ma'am.<eos> The store.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> I didn't try to steal a sweatshirt!<eos> Sir, I'm a mom.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Gloria, help me out.<eos> Listen, Mr. Policeman, if we wanted to steal it, you wouldn't even know that it was gone!
No cell phones, and no Internet during witch therapy. Here.<eos> This is yours.<eos> Right now I want you to focus.<eos> And I want your undivided attention.<eos> You really think you can help me start practicing magic again?<eos> Absolutely, I can.<eos> I invited you here because I can.<eos> But you know what, right now, just relax. Drink your tea.<eos> I got this in Australia when I was backpacking with these aborigine spirit guides.<eos> Trust me, it's better when you smoke it, but I'm trying to be a role model.
I'm sorry.<eos> I won't fail you again.<eos> No. You won't.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> No!<eos> Jeremy?<eos> ! We need to get you inside.<eos> It's almost time.<eos> What you're going through is a curse.<eos> We know how to break it, we just have to get you inside!
And you're afraid if I dump him, it'll throw off his game.<eos> Robin, he got 36 points and 17 rebounds last week.<eos> And that was with his shoes on the wrong feet.<eos> Well, you're probably all wondering how the T-Squares' practice went today.<eos> The T-What?<eos> We played up here.<eos> Basketball, people don't realize, is all geometry, physics and engineering.<eos> If you think like an architect, you could win a thousand games without ever touching a ball.<eos> What happened to your ball?<eos> Some kids from the Hebrew school next door took it and wouldn't give it back.
It's not done.<eos> I speak five, and in every one, that sentence translates to "bullcrap."<eos> You have until noon to turn it in.<eos> Do you know where Miss Blair went?<eos> Uh, she forgot to put on lucky charm this morning when she get out of shower.<eos> She think conditioner dulls diamond.<eos> That lucky charm looks a lot like an engagement ring.<eos> No, uh... is engagement ring on necklace.<eos> At least until Mr. Chuck defeats bad dad.<eos> Miss Blair never leave home without it.
I'm referring to your father.<eos> Well, I mean, he got caught, but a lot of people do a little creative accounting to get past a rough patch and never do.<eos> I'm sure every hedge fund manager behind bars is telling himself the same thing.<eos> All I'm saying is that<eos> Bart had to keep track of his finances somewhere.<eos> If it wasn't in his business accounts, it was in his personal ones.<eos> You're right.<eos> And hopefully, with Lily's help, we'll be able to get them.<eos> Did you instigate a formal dress code at "The Spectator"?<eos> I gotta drop it off at the cleaners before I take Sage to cotillion tonight.
I gotta drop it off at the cleaners before I take Sage to cotillion tonight.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I hope your third time coming out is finally a charm.<eos> Serena.<eos> Hey, Chuck.<eos> Bye, Chuck.<eos> Oh, no, just go ahead and help yourself.<eos> Don't even mention what you're doing here or, you know...<eos> I need a male's perspective on Steven.<eos> He's barely spoken to me all week, and then I don't even think he was gonna tell me about cotillion until Sage accidentally mentioned it.
Now that our plan's almost done, can't I please stop this charade?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not yet, no. I mean, the--the microfilm may be our golden ticket, but we still have to see if Chuck or Bart are willing to sacrifice Lily for it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let me buy you lunch. And this way, you don't have to subsist on waffles alone.<eos> I know a small, out-of-the-way place.<eos> I'll pull the car around, okay?<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> I've been sick with worry. Did you find the microfilm at Charles'?<eos> No, because Chuck doesn't have it.

She found it in the lining of the painting before she sold it to Chuck the night of the auction.
How? She found it in the lining of the painting before she sold it to Chuck the night of the auction.<eos> I am so sorry, Bart.<eos> W-what does she want for it?<eos> You. She will give the records to me or Chuck in exchange for destroying your life.<eos> With Ivy, I'm not surprised.<eos> Of course, I would never do anything to harm you, but I worry Chuck will take her up on her offer.<eos> Oh, Charles would never actively hurt me.<eos> Don't be naive, Lily. If Chuck gets a hold of the microfilm, he'll figure it out.<eos> Let me call Rufus.<eos> Maybe he'll be reasonable and help me get it back before anyone gets hurt.
It's not too late to do the right thing.<eos> Behind the curve as always, Chuck.<eos> It is too late.<eos> What is this, some kind of joke?<eos> What in the world are you doing here?<eos> I know I said I wouldn't help you, but I changed my mind.<eos> I have what you're looking for.<eos> They say nothing inspires forgiveness quite like revenge.<eos> The microfilm was in that envelope, I swear.<eos> If you don't find it and hand it over-- all the torture you wished on Lily, it'll seem like child's play.

Ashes to ashes.<eos> Dust to dust.<eos> Even the best-laid plans can go bust.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been calling for an hour. I just got your messages.<eos> Are you--<eos> Okay? No!<eos> I'm not okay!<eos> Our plan failed. Okay, Rufus must've taken the microfilm from my purse and given it to Lily.<eos> I was with Bart when she called him to tell him that she destroyed it.
Let's see if the woman lives up to the name.<eos> Oh!<eos> Thank you for letting me lean on you today.<eos> I would simply be lost.<eos> William!<eos> Ivy, right?<eos> I would hope, on a day like today, you would be able to give me some measure of peace.<eos> Oh, if there is one thing you're not getting today, it's peace.<eos> And now that William's here, we can tell you together.<eos> You know, they say success is nothing without someone to share it with.
You're my girl.<eos> Now it's just a question of how to get him...<eos> Hey, Robin, I just got your text.<eos> What's the big emergency?<eos> Hi, Barney!<eos> You seem like you run fast.<eos> Do you want me to fan you with my US magazine?<eos> He's fine. Thanks, Patrice.<eos> Oh, thank goodness you're here.<eos> I just got this new printer, and I need somebody big and strong to take it to my office for me.
You don't know the real Bekir.<eos> Fuck off!<eos> We know you down to your liver, man.<eos> The other day, I was walking home. I saw a bug on the sidewalk.<eos> I didn't step on it, just kept going.<eos> Then I thought about it and went back.<eos> - Did you ask it for a date, too?<eos> - No, man! I swear, listen!<eos> I thought, which is better, to walk by without stepping on it, or go back and help it?<eos> I went back. I picked it up and took it to a bush across the street.
Dad never shows.<eos> I was discussing an artificial sweetener with a suspect earlier on.<eos> Yeah, looks and feels like regular sugar, but it's not.<eos> There are minute differences, carcinogenic ones in that case, but it got me thinking about some unusual sand<eos> I noticed at the crash site. It was new, hadn't been weathered by the elements yet.<eos> First I thought, "Well, the city must have trucked it in to offset erosion on the beach,"<eos> but according to the Parks Department, they haven't done that at Far Rockaway in over a year, so how did the sand make it there? In the fuel tank.<eos> Sand dumped into the fuel tank would initially settle on the bottom.<eos> Plane would take off, no difficulty.<eos> But... during the course of the flight, more and more granules will get sucked into the filter, clogging it and starving the engine of fuel mid-flight, regardless of the extra weight of Hank Gerrard's body.
Yes, sir.<eos> No Barts?<eos> Lot of drawers tossed inside.<eos> Looks like he packed a bag in a hurry.<eos> Now, his car is gone too-- blue Toyota Camry.<eos> We got a BOLO out.<eos> What's weird is what is here.<eos> Going by the dimensions, I'd say it's a safe bet this is the weapon used to kill him.<eos> So let me get this straight:<eos> Owen Barts kills Hank Gerrard with this wrench, but he doesn't dispose of it in some place we aren't gonna find it.

Like I said, weird.<eos> Not just weird.<eos> Utterly ridiculous.<eos> What's that?<eos> Spartina patens.<eos> It's a type of cord grass which grows only in brackish water.<eos> Brackish?<eos> It's a combination of fresh and salt water.<eos> It's still a bit moist, which means the wrench was in the water... recently.<eos> I think someone did dispose of it and retrieved it and planted it here.
I enjoy anything that masks the bitter aftertaste of poison.<eos> Oh, plucky.<eos> I like that.<eos> You might as well go.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you anything.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> That's all right.<eos> You've nothing to tell.<eos> You weren't my target.<eos> The compass... sad you lost it?
Oh! You stupid, ungrateful girl!<eos> I'm not as stupid as you think, nor my loyalty so easily bought!<eos> You can bring me a hundred meals and make me a hundred promises, but I will never help you!<eos> Aah! Plucky.<eos> Tell them.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Cora.<eos> We have until sundown to bring her the compass.<eos> If we don't, she'll kill Aurora.<eos> Give it to me.
We will.<eos> We will.<eos> Now you're so sure? Yes.<eos> You told me to have faith, and now I'm telling you. We will make it back.<eos> Okay?<eos> Did you get the information?<eos> It's Rumplestiltskin.<eos> He said the key to stopping her is in his jail cell.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then let's go get it.
Unless you're raped by a clown."<eos> How is this funny, Ms. Dodd?<eos> Sir, that wasn't part of the original act.<eos> I understand that, but I find myself confused by Ms. Dodd's sense of humor.<eos> Do you know that every 45 seconds, there is another sexual assault in America?<eos> So I'm not sure how rape is funny.<eos> The joke isn't about rape, sir.<eos> It's about a ridiculous juxtaposition.<eos> But it makes light of rape, doesn't it?<eos> Shall I read it again?
Yeah, no one saw him in the clubhouse, either.<eos> Although one of the regulars thought they saw him pull up earlier.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Damn it! Fore! He lifted his head.<eos> Maybe the most ridiculous game ever invented.<eos> It's a metaphor for life, Sam.<eos> Nothing to react to but your own actions.<eos> Doesn't look like fun.<eos> It's just you, the ball, the course and your thoughts.<eos> No one to throw the ball to, no one to catch it...
It was already January, February of 1991, the months just went by but that VHS tape didn't show up.<eos> Apart from that, it wasn't shown on TV anymore.<eos> That's how the "case" or the mystery of Four Flies on Grey Velvet originated because you didn't get to see it anywhere anymore.<eos> After a couple years went by people began to ask themselves what ever happened to the film.<eos> It was Dario's only lost movie.<eos> Hence people tried to find out what happened and why it could not be found.<eos> Well, I think somehow there was a purpose behind all that.<eos> The film was produced by Paramount.<eos> Hence it's Paramount's fault that it didn't get released on DVD or VHS.<eos> I was told the intention was to make it become a rarity in order to sell it as profitable as possible one day.
Or rather with Paramount's French production company "Marianne Productions", which was located in Paris.<eos> Consequently, Paramount had gained the movie's distribution rights.<eos> The contracts were made, as usual, by Dario's father Salvatore.<eos> He took care of it.<eos> I've even seen them.<eos> They were real thick American contracts.<eos> They had 200 pages and were written in English.<eos> After that the film went into distribution and everybody was happy since it was a success.<eos> Both Dario and his father Salvatore then regarded the movie as sold.<eos> It wasn't really sold, though, only distributed but they regarded it as sold.
At a certain point, the old SEDA contracts came back to the surface.<eos> These contracts did state that Paramount was the owner of the movie but their property rights were restricted to US territory.<eos> Plus, they owned the 50% of the property rights for some other countries.<eos> The rest of the rights belonged to the SEDA.<eos> The SEDA didn't exist anymore since it was liquidated.<eos> So the search for the bankruptcy trustee began who had overseen the insolvency proceedings.<eos> These examinations, however, cost a lot of time.<eos> By this time it was already the beginning of the new millennium.<eos> It turned out that the film wasn't part of the insolvency since it was regarded as sold.<eos> Thus nobody had concerned himself with it.
He told me that Foglietti had shown him his subject.<eos> The story wouldn't match but this idea did, and that's how that happened.<eos> But Mario didn't really work together with us.<eos> That was that.<eos> We only took the idea.<eos> Now we knew who the killer would be and continued our work, but only Dario and me.<eos> Dario showed me The Cat o' Nine Tails.<eos> At that point we had already been writing the script for some time.<eos> It was important to him that I would watch his finished picture.<eos> So he showed it to me, and I really liked it.
There were more discussions which wore off since the film was well received by distributors and others.<eos> On The Cat o' Nine Tails the whole thing repeated itself.<eos> When I hung out with Dario, I think it was the summer of 1970 no, it was before summer, around May there already were discussions with Lombardo concerning the screenplay.<eos> When I visited him one time, I found Dario totally upset.<eos> He was about to write a letter to Lombardo because Lombardo criticized the movie in front of his father Salvatore who then passed it on to Dario.<eos> And instead of confronting him directly Dario switched to an exchange of letters.<eos> That illustrated that the relationship was already strained back then.<eos> Then everything died down and the shooting took place.<eos> When Dario then presented the finished film to Lombardo Lombardo didn't like it at all.<eos> He said he had to rework it completely.
So they had already invested into that.<eos> And Dario refused to re-cut the movie.<eos> A pretty intense trial of strength followed.<eos> This took a while so that the movie missed its release date.<eos> The film didn't open at the end of January after the Christmas movies since this issue wasn't settled.<eos> Dario totally refused to do the changes demanded by Lombardo.<eos> The release was postponed, and in the end, Lombardo gave in.<eos> He gave in because Dario refused to change the film and it therefore lay idle.<eos> In the end, Lombardo, as the distributor and financier of the movie, said:<eos> "Oh well, let's release it."
His father said:<eos> "Yes, if you can do it..."<eos> So I called Piergiorgio Pozzi who was immediately on board.<eos> They gave me the stock and when I visited my parents I met with Piergiorgio one afternoon.<eos> He had his camera with him, we went into a subway train without having a permission and filmed everything we needed.<eos> We even met a conductor who asked us when he saw the camera:<eos> "Well, what's this for?"<eos> You didn't see that many cameras around back in the days.<eos> He even invited us to the cockpit and we got some great shots from there.<eos> In Rome I gave the film stock to Dario, he had it developed and liked it.
Rambaldi, however, was very precise, very reliable, and everything always worked.<eos> He built the dead cat, for instance.<eos> Dario asked him if he wanted to do the dead cat, and he did it.<eos> He gave it to me afterwards.<eos> I still remember that I had Rambaldi's dead cat in my apartment for years.<eos> It was the cat that was found in the plastic bag in the movie.<eos> And everyone who came over freaked because it looked really nice and realistic.<eos> He built the machine in the film which "reads" eyes, so to speak.<eos> There is this ray which we didn't know how to accomplish in the beginning.<eos> He then took a simple iron wire and connected it to the electrical grid.
It was odd.<eos> Everything was out of alignment.<eos> All his toiletries lined up on the left-hand side.<eos> The same was true of his bedside table, his desk.<eos> So he favors his left side.<eos> Big deal.<eos> Agreed.<eos> Out of context, it's an utterly mundane detail.<eos> But there were these distinctive blue marks on the ceiling above Nardin's bed.<eos> The kind of marks a racquetball might make if it was thrown repeatedly upwards.
You should come see this.<eos> This isn't a trick.<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> But you need to see this.<eos> It has ramifications for all of us.<eos> See that?<eos> Ben's pendant heading East from Wisconsin.<eos> In the last 72 hours, it took off to Philadelphia like a shot.<eos> What happened?<eos> My best guess, I bet general Monroe has got it right now.
Ask for the conference in chambers.<eos> Have Alicia move for the recusal there.<eos> And if he says no?<eos> This should be interesting.<eos> Probably too late to take my advice back.<eos> Probably.<eos> Your Honor, the defense requests an issues conference in chambers.<eos> What do you need, Counselor?<eos> We have a motion, Your Honor.<eos> But it would be easier to present it in chambers.
Mr. Gardner?<eos> It's a personal matter, Your Honor.<eos> Oh, really, a personal matter?<eos> What kind of personal matter?<eos> Please, Your Honor.<eos> Well, in chambers it'll be on the record, Mr. Gardner, and-and...?<eos> Alicia Florrick.<eos> Ah, the state's attorney's wife.<eos> Very fortuitous.<eos> In there and in here, it'll be on the record, so if you have a motion, let's hear it.
Let's start with the friend you sold it to.<eos> Finch, looks like the Estonians have been here already.<eos> Aziz?<eos> I sold him the laptop.<eos> I got him killed.<eos> - Is the laptop still here? - I don't think so.<eos> He told me he found a buyer this morning.<eos> He paid me my share.<eos> Mr. Mansoor sold the laptop before his demise at the hands of the Estonians.<eos> They trashed this place looking for it.
You'd be wrong.<eos> 100,000. Small bills.<eos> Double your asking price.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> The catch...<eos> Albert, is that you leave this very second, disappear, and don't show your face for at least a year.<eos> Especially not at your mom's house in Queens, where you presently reside.<eos> Take your money and go far, far away.<eos> Some very bad people want that laptop.<eos> And if they know you've even seen it, they will kill you.

Let me worry about that.
Go.<eos> Now.<eos> Got distracted.<eos> Where's the pool hall? Did you get the laptop?<eos> Yes, I'm here, and I have the laptop, Mr. Reese.<eos> But I'm afraid you'd better come rather quickly.<eos> I think you have something that belongs to me.<eos> Did you open it?<eos> I don't have to. I know what's on it.<eos> And I know I'll never let you take it.
I'll give you 35.<eos> You're wearing a $10,000 watch.<eos> You're haggling over 15 cents?<eos> You live in this place, and you can't let that 15 cents go?<eos> Fine. 35.<eos> Can you break a 50?<eos> Get out.<eos> Manny.<eos> What is this case doing here?<eos> I found it in the attic.
You're accusing me of being some sort of ecoterrorist?<eos> One of our special consultants thinks your speech pattern is a match for these letters.<eos> For the last time,<eos> I have never seen these letters before.<eos> I don't know anything about the ELM, and I certainly didn't build any bombs.<eos> Lie, lie and lie.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> I am the man with the button.<eos> It's from the elevator down the hall.<eos> You pushed it to get to this floor.

Stop.<eos> See?<eos> It's like Miles always said.<eos> A good hostage works every time.<eos> Take them back to the holding cell, and if she steps out of line, if she even breathes funny, kill both the kids.<eos> They have got some very serious guns.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Monroe keeps the good stuff for himself.<eos> You ever seen this place before?<eos> Bass likes to use it to experiment.
Listen, Ruby, if you don't want to do it for me, then do it for Lavon, because...<eos> I know that he would really like you to try and fit in here, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> You're saying you don't have a single Santa suit on that whole bus of yours?<eos> You're supposed to be a seamstress.<eos> How hard is it to make a Santa suit?<eos> It is impossible to find red felt this time of year!<eos> What if we got white felt and colored it in?
Thanks.<eos> Marco.<eos> What, did you come to collect the knife you left in my back?<eos> It's not your usual hangout, last I remember.<eos> Oh, well, a lot of things have changed since you walked out the door.<eos> Please. You mean since you threw me out.<eos> So is this... is this really where Amanda Clarke lives?<eos> She never saw a penny of that fortune you allegedly put aside for her, did she?<eos> Okay. You obviously think you have a trump card, Marco.<eos> - Why don't you go ahead and play it?
I like what I do, man.<eos> I finally feel like my life is moving in the right direction.<eos> That is what I don't have in my life.<eos> But not anymore.<eos> I'm gonna take one of these pens, I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write my zombie novel.<eos> You don't think I can do it, do you?<eos> You know, it's not that.<eos> No more excuses.<eos> I'm gonna go home, and I'm gonna write that novel.<eos> And I'll be the first to read it.
- Yeah.<eos> "Rhythm" is a tough word.<eos> - Don't feel bad about that.<eos> - Yeah, thanks, man.<eos> - Did you get to the word search?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I put a word search in the novel, but the joke's on you.<eos> There aren't any words in there, so you're just gonna be staring at letters, you idiot.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You finished it, and for that, my friend, I'm proud of you.

That's a Chinese good luck charm that Annunzio kept in the window of his office.<eos> So... if Ramirez is telling the truth, all we got to do is find someone that access to Annunzio's office and lives in Raul Ramirez's neighborhood.<eos> I know someone who fits that particular bill.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> I-I've never heard of Raul Ramirez.<eos> He lives two blocks away.<eos> Same block as your gym actually.<eos> How do you know where I go to the gym?<eos> Your key chain.<eos> Noticed it earlier when you let us into Annunzio's office.
The tumblers are weighted so they cannot be manipulated with a pick.<eos> You could, of course, put a tiny camera on this fire extinguisher.<eos> If you knew an excellent locksmith, you could provide an image of the key, have it duplicated.<eos> Clever, but we already knew that.<eos> Ten-digit access code?<eos> Yes, it's provided by a random number generator that's hardwired into the system.<eos> The code changes every two minutes.<eos> Who has the code?<eos> It appears on a key fob that the owner carries.<eos> If you want to get in there, he's got to read it to you.
Anyone can eat what they want as long as they eat too much.<eos> Lisa, would you like some shrimp?<eos> You know... shrimp aren't all that removed from grasshoppers.<eos> They're both arthropods.<eos> Oh, you did that to help me out.<eos> Not sure what your motivation for that is.<eos> Lunch break.<eos> Make this quick.<eos> I finally got a chair by the window.<eos> I'm afraid the little Bulgarian lady will take it.
Most certainly a distant one...<eos> I'll clean that up.<eos> - What's your order?<eos> - Lemonade, please.<eos> - Which sort, Duchesse?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Or rather Buratino?<eos> - No, Duchesse.<eos> What about our wine?<eos> I haven't forgotten it.
Can we change the subject?<eos> Spiders give me the jeebie-jeebies.<eos> It's "heebie-jeebies."<eos> I know, but that sounds anti-Semitic.<eos> Anyway, I was thinking we could have a little film festival tonight.<eos> The theme: movies that killed their franchises.<eos> Oh. Like Jaws 4, Indiana Jones 4, Daredevil 1.<eos> Miss Congeniality 2:<eos> Armed and Fabulous.<eos> I mean, you know a movie's bad when my homegirl Sandy B. can't save it.
See the stuff in my nose?<eos> Rubber cement.<eos> I don't mean to be judgy, but this is the kind of thing lunatics do.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Amy, would you be strong enough to bathe yourself, or do you need my help?<eos> I'll tell him tomorrow.<eos> Mama needs a bath.<eos> Now, let's assume, by some miracle, you actually catch a fish.<eos> You're going to have to know how to gut it.
Gentlemen.<eos> Thank you, Marshal.<eos> Uh, look, if you come up with anything else, give me a call.<eos> John.<eos> John!<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> Impersonating a law enforcement officer?<eos> Marshal Jennings.<eos> You took his star.<eos> He wasn't using it anymore.
I watched four chick flicks back-to-back, then I made a list of possible ways to tell Caroline I love her.<eos> I was gonna make more, but I got my period.<eos> Okay, run the choices past me.<eos> Whichever one makes me want to hurl the most, that's your winner.<eos> I could play a song for her outside of her apartment, but keep in mind how hard it is to find a boom box in 2012.<eos> Yeah, plus, if you do that outside our apartment, you'll be shot.<eos> By me.<eos> Okay, what about sharing cocoa and a hot dog on the ice rink in Central Park?<eos> Yup, that's it.<eos> Makes me want to take my head off and throw it into the street.
Two years ago<eos> Nothing came up at the time<eos> Will it take long?<eos> Hard to say<eos> Three days, four at the most<eos> Really?<eos> It's a large surface area<eos> There.<eos> The robots are in position<eos> If there is a fissure, they will find it
Why did you do that?<eos> It wasn't about desecrating a grave. Was it?<eos> What were you looking for?<eos> It was Camille Séguret's grave.<eos> Did you know her?<eos> Where is the body?<eos> It wasn't in the coffin.<eos> It wasn't there.<eos> 273)}– Where is it?<eos> – We didn't touch it.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> In the winter of 2012 the skyscraper that I designed was about to open, which got me thinking about the most influential architecture professor I ever had.<eos> So when the children of our grandchildren's children ask us "Who were we," they'll find the answer carved into the granite poetry of our architecture.<eos> Okay.<eos> It doesn't get any better than that.<eos> Class dismissed.<eos> Wow, just wow.<eos> Do you need something?<eos> I have an apple I was hoping to eat in silence.<eos> Of course, Professor Vinick, I, um, I-I sketched out a design, and it'd be such an honor if you took a look at it.
Stoned Caroline's got game.<eos> Hey, Max told me about the rent.<eos> Why didn't you tell me you guys needed help?<eos> I guess I just didn't want to have to admit to you or to myself that we're in real trouble.<eos> Plus, being a charity instead of a girlfriend is so not hot.<eos> Uh, there is nothing you can do that is not hot.<eos> Oh, then whatever you do, do not look at the video Max has of me, rolling around in the IHOP parking lot, covered in syrup.<eos> I want you to have this.<eos> Cash it, don't cash it.<eos> Do whatever you want, but just know that my success doesn't mean anything if I can't share it with you.
Sorry dude.<eos> No autographs till we've concluded business.<eos> So, where are your goons?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't need them to handle you two.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> Oh, God!<eos> You got the laptop?<eos> Yeah, right here, right here um...<eos> And I can give it to you in one second. but I'd like to know something quickly first.
Darling?<eos> I'm still Heinz-Peter for you!<eos> Tell me, how often did I tell you to soak your socks in the bathroom?<eos> My sweater is soaking there.<eos> By the way, it was the last sweater Gitta hand-knitted for me before she left for the West.<eos> That stupid cow!<eos> Never mind.<eos> It needs it warm and... Yes.<eos> But why are you washing your sweater in the middle of the summer?<eos> Because I wear it in winter.
Can I go in?<eos> Thanks.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> - Well, that makes a change.<eos> Gambling ruined my life, but I'm giving up for good.<eos> I'm not interested.<eos> Please, Lara, believe me... - Yes, yes, yes...<eos> Everyone can change...<eos> Are you looking forward to the snow?<eos> You can already smell it.
Is this all a joke to you, Means?<eos> No, but I find pleasure where I can.<eos> Means is a really fun character to write.<eos> The cadence, the word choices, he's very formal in some ways, very flowery.<eos> I believe your left shoelace is in a state of dishabille.<eos> WINTER: He's a really colorful character.<eos> A southerner, charming, slick.<eos> He's a mix between Foghorn Leghorn and Paul Newman from The Sting.<eos> Ordinary men avoid trouble.<eos> Extraordinary men turn it to their advantage.
- Okay.<eos> Now look what you did, Moe! You got donut stuck in my ears.<eos> Hey, you're in luck. They got a donut remover right here.<eos> - What's a donut remover?<eos> - It's one of these.<eos> "Donut Remove-uh."<eos> - Huh. What are the odds of that?<eos> - Hey, mugwumps!<eos> Mother Superior is looking for you.<eos> Here, let me get it for you.
- Please send for the doctor.<eos> My attorney as well.<eos> Of course, sir.<eos> Now you will understand the cause of my sudden death.<eos> The reason for my bizarre funeral instructions.<eos> Why the door can only be opened from the inside.<eos> For if my body dies on Earth, then my copy dies on Mars.<eos> You are the key.<eos> This is the task I entrust to you along with all my fortune.<eos> Protect my body. The Therns will attempt to destroy it.
I don't go very often.<eos> You called me about some pictures, cards, stuff that you found.<eos> Can I go check upstairs?<eos> They're in the office.<eos> There wasn't much.<eos> Maybe I should make sure that's all there is.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I cleaned up.<eos> Is my key there?<eos> I'd like to have it back.

The terrace door was open.<eos> I came closer.<eos> That's when I saw you... downstairs.<eos> On your computer, there was a message.<eos> "Goodbye.<eos> Forgive me."<eos> It must be awful for you.<eos> And my computer?<eos> I'm not sure where it is.<eos> I'd like it back.
Force him to abandon this scheme, whatever he's up to.<eos> He drags his feet about everything,<eos> Lincoln... Why this urgency?<eos> We got it through the Senate without difficulty because we had the numbers.<eos> Come December, you'll have the same in the House.<eos> The amendment will be the easy work of 10 minutes.<eos> He's using the threat of the amendment to frighten the Rebels into an immediate surrender.<eos> I imagine we'd rejoice to see that.<eos> Will you rejoice when the Southern states have rejoined the Union pell-mell, as Lincoln intends them to, and one by one, each refuses to ratify the amendment?<eos> If we pass it, which we won't.
No, she was alone.<eos> - You're sure?<eos> - Sure of what?<eos> Siham told me that Adel drove her everywhere.<eos> Listen, Amin, I don't know.<eos> Could be, yes.<eos> But I haven't seen my son in a while.<eos> What did she want?<eos> All I know is she came as I was going to Friday prayer.<eos> She sat and wrote a letter. Then she asked me to mail it for her.
Keys.<eos> My hand, man.<eos> They're in my pock...<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Now look at your friends.<eos> Now look at my face.<eos> Do you ever want to see me again?<eos> No way.<eos> Am I stealing your car?<eos> Use it as long as you like.
And they killed her because of me.<eos> They want me to run.<eos> But I won't.<eos> - I'm going to finish this.<eos> - No, that's not a good idea.<eos> Listen.<eos> Two things.<eos> One, I...<eos> I stole your car.<eos> If you want to end this, just hang up the phone and report it missing.
Talk to me, Doctor.<eos> Director.<eos> Is there anything we know for certain?<eos> The Tesseract is misbehaving.<eos> -Is that supposed to be funny?<eos> -No, it's not funny at all.<eos> The Tesseract is not only active, she's behaving.<eos> I assume you pulled the plug.<eos> She's an energy source.<eos> We turn off the power, she turns it back on.
The Avengers Initiative was shut down.<eos> This isn't about the Avengers.<eos> We've seen the list.<eos> You're running the world's greatest covert security network and you're going to leave the fate of the human race to a handful of freaks.<eos> I'm not leaving anything to anyone.<eos> We need a response team.<eos> These people may be isolated, unbalanced even but I believe with the right push they can be exactly what we need.<eos> You believe?<eos> War isn't won by sentiment, Director.<eos> No, it's won by soldiers.
I have grown, Odinson, in my exile.<eos> I have seen the true power of the Tesseract, and when I wield it...<eos> Who showed you this power?<eos> Who controls the would-be king?<eos> -I am a king!<eos> -Not here!<eos> You give up the Tesseract!<eos> You give up this poisonous dream!<eos> You come home.<eos> I don't have it.
Sir, we will lose power before we penetrate that shell.<eos> Jarvis, you ever hear the tale of Jonah?<eos> I wouldn't consider him a role model.<eos> Director Fury is no longer in command.<eos> Override order 7-Alpha-1-1 .<eos> 7-Alpha-1-1, confirmed.<eos> We're go for takeoff.<eos> Sir, we have a bird in motion!<eos> Anyone on the deck, we have a rogue bird.<eos> We need to shut it down!
♪ Hmm, hmm... - Oh, could you please turn down that loud music?<eos> - Kvetsch. (complain)<eos> - All right, now we're on to the ordering process.<eos> Now, you have to remember that as a Jew, you have to take something on the menu and alter it beyond all recognition. All right?<eos> - OK.<eos> Practise.<eos> Would it be too much trouble to change that side salad to an entree, and would you mind throwing a little salmon in there?<eos> Nosh. (snack) Uh, can I have that on the side?<eos> - Pupik.(belly button)<eos> - Dinner comes. The salad is exactly how you ordered it, right?
- Oh, yeah, I'm in.<eos> She's putty.<eos> Still going down Saturday, right?<eos> That's the plan.<eos> You master duplicate bridge yet?<eos> And rubber.<eos> That shit reeks. You guys really eat that?<eos> Gefilte fish is mandatory.<eos> Alright, I'm gonna put it in this drawer.<eos> Don't take it out till Saturday.
For this city lay before the doors... of the greatest kingdom in Middle-earth:<eos> Erebor.<eos> Stronghold of Thror... King Under the Mountain. Mightiest... of the Dwarf Lords.<eos> Thror ruled with utter surety... never doubting his house would endure... for his line lay secure... in the lives of his son... and grandson.<eos> Ah, Frodo. Erebor.<eos> Built deep within the mountain itself... the beauty of this fortress city was legend.<eos> It's wealth lay in the earth... in precious gems hewn... from rock and in great seams of gold... running like rivers through stone.<eos> The skill of the Dwarves... was unequaled, fashioning objects... of great beauty... out of diamond, emerald, ruby and sapphire.<eos> Ever they delved deeper... down into the dark.<eos> And that is where they found it.
I don't want to get used to them.<eos> Look at the state of my kitchen.<eos> There's mud trod into the carpet.<eos> They've pillaged the pantry.<eos> I won't tell you what they've done in the bathroom.<eos> They've destroyed the plumbing.<eos> I don't understand what they're doing in my house!<eos> Excuse me. I'm sorry to interrupt, but what should I do with my plate?<eos> FILI:<eos> Here you go, Ori. Give it to me.
That, my dear Balin, is not entirely true.<eos> How came you by this?<eos> It was given to me... by your father.<eos> By Thrain.<eos> For safekeeping.<eos> It is yours... now.<eos> If there is a key... there must be a door.<eos> These runes... speak of a hidden passage to the Lower Halls.<eos> There's another way in.<eos> Well, if we can find it, but Dwarf doors are invisible when closed.
Catch you?<eos> Why would they catch you? What have you done?<eos> Nothing! I haven't done anything, I swear.<eos> Help me.<eos> What do you want me to do? Can you drive?<eos> What?<eos> I can't drive.<eos> Santini, come here.<eos> You wanted probable cause?<eos> This is it.
But it only led to our damnation.<eos> You all got what you deserved.<eos> Yes, and I became the mother of the demon.<eos> But you are her daughter.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Alessa didn't die in the fire, but she suffered so much.<eos> Her pain was only matched by her rage.<eos> And with that rage, her powers grew beyond all comprehension.<eos> Alessa knew there was a part of her that could still be free from pain.<eos> So she took that last, innocent part of her soul and placed it into a newborn, orphan child.
We might not have it much longer.<eos> Why?<eos> Paramount refuses to finance the movie.<eos> Oh, Hitch, I'm so sorry.<eos> Lew can't find the money.<eos> At least, not fast enough.<eos> Well, why not wait?<eos> No.<eos> We're just going to have to go it alone, old girl.<eos> Finance it ourselves.
Well, David, you know how Paramount loves Jerry Lewis... but this one is right up your alley, and I would consider...<eos> Barney?<eos> Alma!<eos> You know David Kirkpatrick.<eos> He's working with Jerry Lewis, developing a new picture... so he's free to help if you need it.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> But you're nearly three days behind.<eos> Yes, well, we can manage.<eos> Alma, we both know what kind of film this is.<eos> Now, the smart thing to do would be to help Hitch finish it.
I hear some of you... agree with the latest French proposals.<eos> Well, why don't you get on a boat to Calais?<eos> Yes, why don't you put on a beret, and pay 85% of your income to the French government!<eos> Right.<eos> What can we realistically hope to achieve by the end of session, Lord President?<eos> And why have we not made more progress to date?<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that the timetable?<eos> I haven't seen that.<eos> May I see it? Here it is, Prime Minister.
- Bullshit!<eos> Harry Green is just one of them.<eos> What, you think he's their leader?<eos> - Come on, there must be a reason for all this.<eos> - You think they need a reason?<eos> We're in an asylum;<eos> they're inmates.<eos> That's your reason.<eos> - Hey, Max. I'm sorry. I should have never offered you the job.<eos> - I'm sorry I ever took it, man.
Well, what can you do?<eos> Just about anything, I guess.<eos> We land in Deposit in the morning.<eos> We'll get you some work for the day, and if you're still alive at the end of it, I will take you to see August, the Lord and Master of the Known and the Unknown Universe himself!<eos> Who's that?<eos> Hold on, chlopak, you're in for the ride of your life.<eos> You see that?<eos> Wave, Olivia.<eos> Now, I don't know if I picked that train, or that train picked me.<eos> But something told me my mother and my father sent it my way.
I will not tolerate it, Ren.<eos> Not in my school.<eos> So what have you gotta say for yourself?<eos> What do I have to say?<eos> I was on the gymnastics team for three years.<eos> Got drug tested all the time.<eos> If I smoked weed, I'd be off the team.<eos> - He had a joint...<eos> - You know what one looks like?<eos> Were you going to smoke it or sell it?
- the terrorists win.<eos> - That's not a bad idea.<eos> We could start our own petition.<eos> Challenge the law against public dancing.<eos> Why not? Then we can just organise our own dance.<eos> I'm not talking about some drunken kegger or free-for-all orgy.<eos> That right there? That's an idea!<eos> I'm talking about a formal, respectable dance.<eos> One that's not held in the church, with everyone's eyes on you.<eos> You could have it in the Bomont lockup.
I can't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I haven't got the key.<eos> Does Marilia have it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> If you scream, I'll break your jaw.<eos> Where's the key to upstairs?<eos> In the drawer at the corner.<eos> Untie me and I'll give it to you.
- Irrelevant!<eos> Obfuscation.<eos> You and your kin are under arrest for bank robbery and the murder of our beloved financial advisor<eos> Johannes Merrimack the Third, AKA, Fluffy Joe.<eos> Sheriff, we didn't kill nobody.<eos> We done tunnelled into that vault, but there weren't nothing in it.<eos> Somebody done robbed that bank before we robbed it.<eos> Then where'd you get this here jug?<eos> That's what I been trying to tell you, Pappy.<eos> I found it in the desert.

HARRY:<eos> I'm still working on that part.<eos> He's weak.<eos> Yes?<eos> Mr. Ollivander, I need to ask you a few questions.<eos> OLLIVANDER:<eos> Anything, my boy, anything.<eos> HARRY:<eos> Would you mind identifying this wand?<eos> We need to know if it's safe to use.
Anything, my boy, anything.<eos> HARRY:<eos> Would you mind identifying this wand?<eos> We need to know if it's safe to use.<eos> Walnut.<eos> Dragon heartstring. Twelve and three-quarter inches.<eos> Unyie...<eos> Unyielding.<eos> This belonged to Bellatrix Lestrange.<eos> Treat it carefully.
Why don't you confer with Mr. Finnigan?<eos> As I recall, he has a particular proclivity for pyrotechnics.<eos> I can bring it down.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Now away you go.<eos> You do realize, of course, we can't keep out You-Know-Who indefinitely.<eos> MCGONAGALL:<eos> Well, that doesn't mean we can't delay him.<eos> And his name is Voldemort, Filius.<eos> You might as well use it.
Together.<eos> (BOTH YELLING)<eos> (YELLS)<eos> (STUDENTS CHATTERING)<eos> - Ha, ha.<eos> - I always figured he would be a big fellow.<eos> I couldn't find my wand.<eos> I haven't lost my wand in my entire life.<eos> It was lost in the folds of my gowns.<eos> I managed to find it and I dispatched a few of them...
- It's all right.<eos> It's 11 o'clock.<eos> - You want a cup of tea?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> How's your head?<eos> It's not great.<eos> I'll survive.<eos> - Just milk? - Mm.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> - We'll fix it or get you another.

Pleased to meet you.<eos> You just gonna stay in here all day and shake hands, make small talk or are you gonna make us a drink?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Angel.<eos> Oh, little spud, I can't even get a smile out of you?<eos> I got a present for you.<eos> Luli, go to the car and get that you-know-what.<eos> Cover your eyes.<eos> You're just a saint. Do you like that drink?<eos> I'm drinking it, ain't I?
Traffic.<eos> Tell me the truth kid. Am I gonna see you on the back of one of them milk cartons?<eos> No.<eos> So, I'm not looking for no kind of trouble.<eos> Not like I kidnapped you against your will, making you do some fucking childhood slavery or some Geraldo shit.<eos> Why would I lie to you?<eos> I helped you rob a convenience store, Glenda.<eos> All right. All right.<eos> See this place?<eos> Look at it.
Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> Please, I need a...<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Hi. I'm gonna need your card and I'm gonna need the locking key of your wheel nuts.<eos> Do you have it?
After two laps, I am out cold.<eos> That ain't what I meant.<eos> What's going on over there?<eos> He is afraid of Francesco.<eos> That's that Italian formula car.<eos> - His name is...<eos> - Francesco Bernoulli.<eos> - No wonder there's a crowd.<eos> - Why do you know his name?<eos> And don't say it like that.
I've got enough to do here.<eos> Mater's going to have a blast, though.<eos> You're bringing Mater, right?<eos> You never bring him to any of your races.<eos> Just let him sit in the pits.<eos> Give him a headset.<eos> Come on, it will be the thrill of a lifetime for him.<eos> - Your drink, sir.<eos> - Mater.<eos> I didn't taste it!
The jury may still be out on whether allinol caused these accidents, but one thing's for sure,<eos> Lightning McQueen blew this race.<eos> Team McQueen can't be happy right now.<eos> Welcome to Tokyo International Airport.<eos> - Come with me, please, sir.<eos> - But I'm 'onna miss my plane.<eos> - Right this way.<eos> - Ah, doggone it.<eos> This is about my hook, ain't it?<eos> I know I should have checked it, but I can't, really.
- Yes.<eos> You're not the first to lose men. You won't be the last.<eos> Now, put that away.<eos> You understand me?<eos> Right now your men are awaiting orders.<eos> Now, you can go left, you can go right. I don't give a damn.<eos> Just make a decision.<eos> Lieutenant.<eos> It's a no-go on the helo, sir.<eos> Enemy aircraft is lighting it up.
They think it could be operational.<eos> Maybe we'd be better off on foot.<eos> It's miles to the operating base and those bombs are gonna drop in an hour.<eos> We gotta move fast.<eos> Bus is a big target.<eos> I made the call.<eos> It's my responsibility.<eos> Stavrou, Harris.<eos> Lieutenant needs recon on a bus.<eos> If it runs, get it back here.
LINDY: "In a sizzling three days of trading, the unknown Mr. Morra trumped the market, prompting one top hedge fund manager to comment:<eos> 'He's Houdini. He's a prophet of our times!"<eos> OK, give me that.<eos> Give me that!<eos> - "He's God"?<eos> - You coming over later?<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't have a key.<eos> Oh, that's right.<eos> - Can I have it back?
- Hey.<eos> We were gonna go see the rhinos...<eos> And we were wondering if you could show us the way.<eos> You know what? I can't right now.<eos> I'm feeding the giraffe.<eos> She's eating carrots.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here they come.<eos> - See the thumb?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, I see it.
When you're not focused.<eos> I didn't do it, you know.<eos> - I'm sorry?<eos> - I didn't attack him.<eos> Oh, yeah, he says you did though.<eos> He's a liar, okay?<eos> He never treats us with any respect.<eos> To get us to move, he prods us with a long stick... With a nail in the end of it.<eos> One day, I guess I wasn't walking fast as he wanted me to...<eos> So he swung the stick at me, but I caught it, and he slipped and fell.
Indeed I do.<eos> Meantime, I shall safeguard it here.<eos> Do you trust me to keep it?<eos> Not a whit, sir.<eos> You are not to be trusted at all.<eos> Jane Eyre. I've twice done you wrong:<eos> And I broke the vow I made to Reed.<eos> Please, don't think of it.<eos> Open that box.<eos> Take out the letter and read it.
I earnestly wish to be your friend.<eos> You can't give half a sacrifice.<eos> You must give all.<eos> To marry you would kill me!<eos> Kill you?<eos> Kill you?<eos> Those words are unfeminine and untrue.<eos> I know where your heart turns and to what it still clings.<eos> Say his name.<eos> Say it. Say it!
It's a drag, but it's amazing?<eos> Not really...<eos> Where are your mothers?<eos> Oh, well, they passed away a few years ago. I...<eos> I guess you kind of lost touch with them.<eos> Anyway, we're here to enroll our daughter jayleen in pre-ballet. Ok, um...<eos> If you could just fill out the top part of this form.<eos> Sure.<eos> Moon: You're so tired, and your arm is so heavy.<eos> Just put it down.
It is I, Prince Fabious and my brother, Prince Thadeous.<eos> We come to seek counsel.<eos> Come, come.<eos> Give me kisses.<eos> Kiss him.<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> Pretty please.<eos> Kiss it on the mouth.<eos> For the quest.<eos> I do it every time I come.
Because I've tested it.<eos> Really?<eos> And if your vagina is anything like my hand there will be no problem.<eos> Fair warriors, arise.<eos> Two days before the eclipse.<eos> Thadeous, hand me the compass so I can check its shadow.<eos> What?<eos> The compass.<eos> That's weird.<eos> It was around my neck when I slept.
An animal in a cage.<eos> Now sit.<eos> So, who were those handsome men you were talking to?<eos> My contacts.<eos> Mmm.<eos> By contacts do you mean men you trick into liking you so you can fuck them over?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> The compass.<eos> Hand it over now.
It does nothing.<eos> Maybe if you would've gone to the Wize Wizard like we did, he could have explained to you that it only works in sunlight.<eos> Really?<eos> Shit, I shouldn't have told you that.<eos> Isn't the Wize Wizard a pervert? Yes.<eos> Sadly, I think he molested my brother.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> Enough of your sympathy.<eos> The compass. Give it.<eos> I need it to destroy Leezar.
Even the opening scene, there's always some random girl who gets a call that undoubtedly... ends up getting her killed.<eos> It's all so predictable. There's no element of surprise.<eos> You can see everything coming.<eos> Did that surprise you?<eos> It's your own fault.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because you talk too much.<eos> Now shut the fuck up and watch the movie.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> I love it. I've seen it five times, and it still gets me every time.
My video blog upload.<eos> He's webcasting right now.<eos> Mind turning it off?<eos> A little old school, off the record?<eos> Can't.<eos> Owe it to my audience.<eos> - Turn the fucking thing off.<eos> - Ok...<eos> - So, you two are the boys who run the movie club at Woodsboro High, huh?<eos> - Oh, Charlie rents it.
- I've got to find a place to change a diaper.<eos> -oh, God.<eos> Unless, of course, Mr. Wu-Gang Clams would like to help with some poopy?<eos> Wu-Tang, dude.<eos> Woo-hoo.<eos> Your little friend better get me a tree.<eos> I'm sorry about him, dude. I--<eos> BORIS:<eos> Hey, grandpa!<eos> - Toss it back.
- Okay, good. You're in charge of distracting them.<eos> How the hell do I do that?<eos> KUMAR:<eos> That's easy, you'll just use our secret weapon.<eos> Pillow fight in the altar boys' room.<eos> Last one there's a rotten egg.<eos> KUMAR:<eos> Once the coast is clear, we use the key to get into the back room.<eos> I guard while you kill the power.<eos> While everyone's trying to turn the power on you and I will get the tree. We take it to your place, and when Maria's dad comes home and sees this beautiful tree in your living room, he'll jizz all over it.
Don't pee on me!<eos> Jesus! Well, then what the hell do--?<eos> - Oh.<eos> Our clothes.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Cool about the clothes.<eos> My dick's stuck to a pole!<eos> Dude, you're in luck.<eos> There's still coffee in here.<eos> Get it over here.
On, Comet!<eos> On, Blitzen!<eos> Hyah! Merry Christmas, Roldy!<eos> MR. PEREZ:<eos> Where's the tree?<eos> It's, um ...<eos> Okay, what happened is that, um ...<eos> You said you were going to take care of it.<eos> Now where's the tree?<eos> What happened to the tree is, uh I kind of burned it down.
Just leave 'em on the desk.<eos> You need something?<eos> Anyone seen Stand and Deliver?<eos> Show of hands.<eos> You kidding me?<eos> Edward James Olmos?<eos> Lou Diamond Phillips?<eos> Wow.<eos> All right.<eos> You and you, grab the TV and roll it up front.
Carl Halabi?<eos> The state test?<eos> The blatant disregard for the school syllabus?<eos> And let's not forget, the sleeping with my boyfriend.<eos> Scott, your phone accidentally called me last night.<eos> I can't believe you'd let her take advantage of you like that.<eos> You are too trusting.<eos> I am.<eos> I didn't know what was happening.<eos> I hope you haven't spent that bonus check or anything, because you're about to give it back.
This isn't even my desk. It's hers.<eos> Don't worry, Amy.<eos> We'll get you the help you need.<eos> - You monster! - Lady.<eos> - Calm down, lady.<eos> - Fucking damn it.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> I stole her desk!<eos> You can check my urine.<eos> Check it!
Where did I come from?<eos> Actually... you came from this.<eos> It was just another day at the restaurant.<eos> Time to make the noodles.<eos> I went out to the back, where my vegetables had just been delivered.<eos> There were cabbages, turnips, radishes.<eos> Only there were no radishes.<eos> Just a very hungry baby panda.<eos> There was no note.<eos> Of course, you could have eaten it.
We - We have to pray.<eos> First for-for Father Lazaro... and then for his murderers.<eos> But they're murderers, and they took pleasure in it.<eos> What do you want to do to those swine? Truthfully.<eos> Right now, what do you want to do to them if you could?<eos> Truthfully. And wouldn't you take pleasure in it?<eos> And yet we're no swine, are we?<eos> But it's not the same, Father.<eos> No human being- not one of us- is free from human weakness. No One.<eos> Our faith is a gift, and God has called us to manifest it in love... here on earth.
There are different ways of measuring the same universe.<eos> And in yours, chance isn't blind, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Josemaría?<eos> My friend.<eos> You came... as promised.<eos> Pray for me,<eos> Josemaría. Is someone with him?<eos> You gave me a... rosary.<eos> I still have it.
And in yours, chance isn't blind, is it?<eos> No.<eos> Josemaría?<eos> My friend.<eos> You came... as promised.<eos> Pray for me,<eos> Josemaría. Is someone with him?<eos> You gave me a... rosary.<eos> I still have it.<eos> I've never used it,
But blow jobs were my specialty.<eos> I gave rim jobs and frozen blowjobs.<eos> What are those?<eos> A blow job with an ice cube.<eos> You put a piece of ice in your mouth, then you suck on the head of his cock with your tongue and the ice.<eos> You run your lips over his veins and balls, with the ice cube still in your mouth.<eos> You manoeuvre the ice cube over his head and nibble on it.<eos> Then you jerk him off and rim him, sticking the ice cube up his ass.<eos> Rimming is the best because it makes them moan.<eos> If his asshole is dirty, prepare a bowl of chlorine. Wipe it clean with a towel.
You climb on top of him and wrap your hand around his cock.<eos> But before that, you put lubricant all over your hand.<eos> Then you moan and act like it's real.<eos> 'Yeah, Daddy, that feels so good."<eos> He thinks he's inside you, fucking you.<eos> Poor fool.<eos> It's all just a trick.<eos> There are lots of tricks, for blowjobs too.<eos> Lubricate your neck for his cock to rub. Play with his balls with his cock on your neck.<eos> He thinks it's in your mouth, but it's not.
[GRUNTS]<eos> [ARTHUR TIFFANY CONVERSING INDISTINCTLY]<eos> ARTHUR:<eos> That was brave.<eos> What incredible flexibility.<eos> [GASPS]<eos> - Hello, Hobson.<eos> - Morning, Arthur. And friend.<eos> Tiffany.<eos> Oh, points for knowing her name and saying it with confidence.
'Do you understand?<eos> 'I have had an offer of service.<eos> 'A Hungarian general wants to come over.<eos> 'I would like you to meet him.'<eos> He has some information that I need, Jim.<eos> What information?<eos> Treasure.<eos> 'He has the name of the mole 'the Russians have planted in the British intelligence service 'right at the top of the Circus.<eos> 'There's a rotten apple, Jim.<eos> 'We have to find it.'
Doesn't he like us?<eos> I don't hold with odd-bods hanging around.<eos> He might steal the Alvis.<eos> - Which is?<eos> - The best car in England, sir.<eos> Good lad.<eos> How were you briefed for the Budapest mission?<eos> Control asked me to come to a flat in Kensington.<eos> There's a rotten apple, Jim.<eos> And We have to find it.
Don't feel it? Don't feel it, right?<eos> wipe the sweat<eos> Hey, what the hell?<eos> By the way, how did your master die?<eos> Oh, he failed the cock.swapping operation And was killed by the patient<eos> we're physically challenged but so what?<eos> we do our job well we are not worse than any healthy person<eos> Oh<eos> The cock is squished what?<eos> Do you think we can still swap it?
Either of you can give me your cock!<eos> It won't work even if I am willing to lf l am willing to give up my cock I don't have hands to do the operation lf l give up my cock no one can run errands for me<eos> we don't have enough time.<eos> That's right<eos> Don't tell me it's my fate that I have no cock<eos> Hey, hold it!<eos> is your donkey a male?<eos> The donkey, hey!<eos> Hey, where are you going?<eos> If it is male, we will buy it no matter how much we can repay what we owe you
Su... sure!<eos> As long as your Highness spare my life I've offered to teach you before, but you said you're not interested<eos> I still want to have my own children ... well... that's kind of tough<eos> Tell the government that we found someone on the wanted list here<eos> Hold on, hold on!<eos> Your Highness I heard what you say...<eos> You want the tricks but not having no offspring<eos> That should be fine I will figure it out<eos> when you came here you held tight onto this brush I know it must be very important to you<eos> I got it repaired
Abbot, I am leaving now<eos> what's the matter...<eos> Are you okay?<eos> So...is it okay ...to let Yuxiang go....<eos> Let her go?<eos> I am a man of my word I haven't played enough of her<eos> Let her go!<eos> You bastard!<eos> This is an iron chastity belt made by the first Jin Emperor<eos> In the world, except with this key in my hand no one can open it I'm going to put the belt on her
I know you well.<eos> Your name, I think, is Aufidius.<eos> It is so.<eos> - I'm a Roman.<eos> - What's the news in Rome?<eos> What's the news in Rome?<eos> There hath been in Rome strange insurrections.<eos> - The people against the senators.<eos> - Hath been? Is it ended then?<eos> The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing would make it flame again.
Dad says she lets the piggies sleep in bed with her.<eos> Aunt Inga is my cousin.<eos> She might look a bit weird, but at least she's kind.<eos> It's true...<eos> After all these years...<eos> we decided to let it rest.<eos> He might be in danger.<eos> Why should we have it translated now?<eos> We could... help him.<eos> If we show this letter to anyone... to have it translated then they'll see.

What happened to him?<eos> - He disappeared.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> We got a letter from Berlin a couple of years later, and...<eos> Well, we assumed that he went back there.<eos> What did it say?<eos> We don't know German, Simon...<eos> - Let's go inside.<eos> - Where is the letter?<eos> - Inga burned it.
I got to try and get her back.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Will you just help me get to her?<eos> They'll sense you coming a mile away.<eos> What if I could move as fast as you?<eos> Teach me about the doors.<eos> The rain will stop in the next hour, and that's the only thing keeping them from seeing us right now.<eos> If we're going do this, we'll need all night to do it and a place surrounded by water to do it in.<eos> Always turn the doorknob clockwise.<eos> What happens if I turn it the other way?
Assume everyone with a hat on is a threat.<eos> I don't care if it's a Yankee cap, a bowler, or even a yarmulke.<eos> Assume everyone in a hat is working with Thompson.<eos> Even you guys can't get through the doors without your hats on, right?<eos> Right.<eos> It's one of the ways the Chairman limits our power.<eos> Water is another way.<eos> And you said before, what if Thompson's in front of me on Crosby Street?<eos> Right.<eos> Why don't I just knock the hat off his head and then run by him before he has time to pick it up?
Give me some fork.<eos> All right, let's let this shirt start over!<eos> Okay, two more left.<eos> A good one.<eos> Oldie but a goodie.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mommy used to wear that sometimes.<eos> She did.<eos> This was a...<eos> It started out as mine, but she kind of adopted it.
Okay.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Look, am I nuts to say that I missed you like crazy a lot? A lot.<eos> Plus, I wasn't named after Bob Dylan.<eos> I was named after a dog named Dylan.<eos> I don't even care.<eos> Who cares?<eos> - Sorry about the rain.<eos> - No, I love it.
Our entire space race of the 1960s, it appears, was in response to an event.<eos> Our astronauts investigated a crashed alien ship.<eos> No survivors on board.<eos> We were sworn to secrecy by our Commander in Chief.<eos> This was a mission you will never speak of.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> A total of 35 people knew the real plan at NASA.<eos> Soviets managed to land unmanned probes.<eos> Somehow they must have picked up that fuel rod.<eos> We believe the Russians deduced that the rod was a fissionable fuel assembly, believed they had it mastered, and tried to harness it at Chernobyl.
Don't do sideways.<eos> We've come all the way across.<eos> You'll have to go all the way back.<eos> I've got the kids.<eos> It's kind of dangerous.<eos> Of course.<eos> - And we're anxious to get home.<eos> - I see. Fair enough.<eos> But see it my way, sport.<eos> One day, I'll be protecting my beach... and some pumped-up mongrel wants to take it from me.
- ERIK:<eos> Mom!<eos> - Gloria!<eos> GLORIA:<eos> My beautiful boys.<eos> Thought I'd never see you again.<eos> Gotta be a way to get you out.<eos> Honey, there are search parties everywhere.<eos> SEYMOUR:<eos> If there's a way out, we're gonna find it.
LAUREN:<eos> Perfect.<eos> - See?<eos> - You win.<eos> STU:<eos> See you later.<eos> LAUREN:<eos> Have fun.<eos> STEPHANIE: Got your key? - Uh, yep.<eos> Got it right there.
Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> - Feeling a little better.<eos> - All right.<eos> Listen, Teddy, I'm really sorry.<eos> We didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> I can't remember anything... but when I woke up...<eos> Yeah!<eos> By the way, you have any idea where my finger is?<eos> Yeah, we gave it to a drug-dealing monkey.
Yes, I see that now.<eos> I'm sorry. No.<eos> Please, sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Please.<eos> So it is really builder's tea ?<eos> Yes.<eos> We dunk biscuits into it.<eos> You " dunk " ?<eos> Well, it means lowering the biscuit into the tea... and letting it soak in there... and trying to calculate the exact moment before the biscuit dissolves... when you can whip it up into your mouth... and enjoy the blissful union of biscuit and tea combined.
Son of a...<eos> Quick!<eos> Trace the call!<eos> More-ti, to the pool now!<eos> How do I know you really have photos of Melanie?<eos> I never lie.<eos> Judge her cock-sucking talent yourself in an interviu pinup.<eos> You demand ...?<eos> A sworn testimony admitting you were Fontanelli's murderer, to clear my name.<eos> Or give me a million euros and I'll clear it myself from a Caribbean beach.
There'll always be money in the world, mate.<eos> Plenty of that to go round.<eos> But this little girl?<eos> One of a kind.<eos> - What are you trying to say?<eos> - That we do things my way.<eos> You brought the money?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then this is how we're gonna do it.<eos> I leave here now with the case and check it with my associates.

Yes. Their glorious special forces.<eos> It was a war.<eos> It was not England's war.<eos> They came to my land, murdered my sons, now they will face my law.<eos> The doctors say I have six months left to live.<eos> You must avenge my sons before I die or your friend will die with me.<eos> I don't care how you kill the killers.<eos> But they will admit their guilt on tape, and their deaths must look like accidents.<eos> This must not lead back to my son.<eos> So go, show the English a war isn't over till both sides say it is.
And Campbell.<eos> Where is he, you fucker?<eos> Never heard of him.<eos> That all you got?<eos> Yeah, Spike?<eos> We got the Welshman.<eos> We're bringing him to you now. Over.<eos> Nice work, Pennock. Well done.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting the bastard.<eos> Hey, Spike's gonna cut your dick off and shove it in your mouth. You like that?
What are you going to do?<eos> You're going to need this.<eos> New name, new face, new papers.<eos> Expensive.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Damn shame.<eos> You think you get to just walk away?<eos> Nobody walks away.<eos> Not me or you, none of us.<eos> The old man you just killed, he told me a war isn't over until both sides say it is.
I understand.<eos> - Who's there?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> It's me, Celia Foote.<eos> I was in the neighborhood. Thought I'd drop by.<eos> Everybody hide.<eos> Everybody get down, get down.<eos> - Turn off the music. - Who are we hiding from?<eos> I brought a chocolate pie!<eos> My maid, Minny, made it.
Now!<eos> Before we all get one of those disgusting things on our lips!<eos> Take me inside, please.<eos> Skeeter, do you have plans tomorrow?<eos> Because we are going shopping.<eos> No single daughter of mine is going to New York City representing the great state of Mississippi without a proper cosmopolitan wardrobe.<eos> How do you know about New York?<eos> Oh, well, Miss Stein called last night.<eos> Courage sometimes skips a generation.<eos> Thank you for bringing it back to our family.
Look at that fucking cookie!<eos> Did you really think that this group of women was going to finish that cookie?<eos> Really?<eos> You know what?<eos> That reminds me, actually.<eos> I never got a chance to try that fucking cookie!<eos> Stupid fucking cookie!<eos> Delicious!<eos> Stupid cookie. I think I'll...<eos> Maybe it's better if I dip it in the chocolate.
It is true what they say about the northern girls.<eos> Did you hear the king's in Winterfell?<eos> I did hear something about that.<eos> And the queen and her twin brother.<eos> They say that he is the most handsome man in the Seven Kingdoms.<eos> And the other brother?<eos> - The queen has two brothers? - There's the pretty one... and there's the clever one.<eos> I hear they call him the Imp.<eos> I hear he hates that nickname. Oh?<eos> I hear he's more than earned it.
[BELL TOLLING]<eos> [HORSES WHINNYING]<eos> The wolf.<eos> MAN:<eos> This way!<eos> Over here!<eos> [CROWD CHATTERING]<eos> It killed again.<eos> But we've kept the peace.<eos> Well, the wolf has broken it.
AUGUSTE:<eos> We should count our blessings.<eos> REEVE:<eos> Come on, Father.<eos> It's been almost 20 years since the wolf has taken a human life.<eos> REEVE:<eos> Twenty years.<eos> That's because we sacrifice our best livestock every full moon.<eos> We kept our end of the bargain.<eos> -So now we kill it. -CROWD:
Henry's her only hope for a better life.<eos> If you love her you'll let her go.<eos> We've all seen the bones on the trail to Mount Grimmoor.<eos> That's where the wolf makes its lair.<eos> BARKEEP:<eos> We know the weaknesses of the werewolf.<eos> It can't come out in daylight. It can't step onto holy ground.<eos> -And there's silver.<eos> -MAN 1 :<eos> That'll kill it.
Silver!<eos> Maybe Father Auguste is right.<eos> Maybe we should wait.<eos> [PETER SCOFFS]<eos> MAN 3:<eos> Coward.<eos> [CROWD LAUGHING]<eos> ADRIAN: Maybe, my son you should find your courage.<eos> You want to hunt the wolf?<eos> Let's hunt it.

Well, no disrespect but you have no idea what you are dealing with.<eos> [CROWD MURMURING]<eos> I was like you once.<eos> My wife's name was Penelope.<eos> She gave me two beautiful daughters.<eos> We were a very happy family.<eos> We lived in a village like this.<eos> And like Daggerhorn ours was plagued by a werewolf.<eos> One full moon, my friends and I got drunk.<eos> We decided to hunt it.

It's strong.<eos> -God is stronger.<eos> [WOLF GROWLING]<eos> [GROANING]<eos> God is stronger!<eos> I warned you!<eos> I warned you!<eos> Your werewolf is still alive!<eos> Find it!<eos> Find it!
-God is stronger.<eos> [WOLF GROWLING]<eos> [GROANING]<eos> God is stronger!<eos> I warned you!<eos> I warned you!<eos> Your werewolf is still alive!<eos> Find it!<eos> Find it!<eos> Find it.
[IN DEEP VOICE] The better to eat you with, my dear.<eos> [PANTING]<eos> Valerie. What are you doing out of bed?<eos> I was so worried.<eos> It looks much better.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Grandmother's.<eos> I think she's in danger.<eos> We're going after the wolf before the storm can cover its tracks.<eos> It'll be human again and we can finally kill it.
No, you didn't!<eos> We'll work on one of those.<eos> You tell me how my shit went.<eos> Oh, your shit?<eos> How'd my stuff go?<eos> Mitch, what the hell is wrong with you?<eos> It was a porno movie!<eos> It's a lorno, a light porn.<eos> The dick stays in the pants, right?<eos> They didn't pull it out, did they?
Stilton Coffee House tonight.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Okay- okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Hello.<eos> This is District Manager Carla Nelson from the Atlanta Department of Parks.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Well, we have found that fountain.<eos> It's been moved to 1100 Peachtree Boulevard.<eos> You found it.
That little roadblock back there, that would have stopped you.<eos> So, I want you to holster that iron God-killer, and say, "Thank you."<eos> I said, holster and "thank you."<eos> Don't hurt her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, unbuckle the belt.<eos> Right here, please.<eos> Ah, that's better.<eos> You're not the first to get out, and I doubt you'll be the last, but I have got to know, how did you get out with the God-killer?<eos> I just walked in and took it.
- Damn you! - Haha!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You've come to tell me that the Musketeers are dead?<eos> Our plan is proceeding on schedule, and I have absolutely positively nothing to worry about.<eos> We were taken by surprise Your Eminence.<eos> Somehow I was laboring under the assumption that the plan was for you to take them by surprise.<eos> Was it not?<eos> Your Eminence...<eos> Yes, you are quite fond of that word, aren't you?<eos> Sadly repeating it does not get you into my good graces. Alert Milady.
That's a very smart decision.<eos> how much would this be?<eos> 000.<eos> 000 for this?<eos> Nothing here is worth that much money.<eos> You'd be very surprised. It starts to add up.<eos> 000.<eos> yeah.<eos> This rug right here?<eos> For $100 a month you can protect it along with all your other belongings.
You got a good idea?<eos> No?<eos> uh...<eos> We'll dump him in a lake! You know?<eos> I got my ice fishing gear in my van.<eos> Lakes around here they stay frozen until May.<eos> right?<eos> Help me roll him up in the carpet.<eos> he'll know it's missing.<eos> Then start cleaning it or something.
Watson, might we use an alternative exit?<eos> Is there something different about you?<eos> I'm under observation.<eos> As you should be.<eos> HOLMES:<eos> You drive.<eos> WATSON:<eos> Will your beard be with us all night?<eos> HOLMES:<eos> I'll remove it once we're south of Trafalgar Square.
Elizabeth has revoked all of his royal licenses. Confiscated his property.<eos> She believes every lie Cecil tells about him.<eos> Fight him in London and you prove true every rumor and every lie Cecil has ever told.<eos> Then what do you suggest I do? !<eos> - Let myself be arrested? - No.<eos> No.<eos> I will visit Elizabeth myself.<eos> Alone.<eos> How?<eos> Cecil will not let her see a letter without reading it first.
What I'm gonna do with that?<eos> I gotta worry about my own.<eos> I can't save the world.<eos> This ain't a fucking Superman outfit I'm wearing.<eos> I've got two worthless pieces of over 21-year-old garbage that are dead.<eos> No one cares.<eos> Not a single fucking person.<eos> So what do I do?<eos> Case is closed.<eos> I closed it.
Talk about bad luck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But, er, where do we start?<eos> I say we start with these two lads and we take it from there.<eos> Slàlnte.<eos> That's Gaelic.<eos> What's the first case you ever solved?<eos> - Stealing an ostrich.<eos> - What?<eos> Guy stole an ostrich, transported it across state lines.
I mean, if Galileo had felt that, we'd still think we're the center of the universe, that the sun is orbiting us.<eos> I mean... They tried to burn him at the stake for that.<eos> Yeah, maybe they should have.<eos> We still think we're the center of the universe.<eos> We call ourselves Earth One, and them Earth Two.<eos> You think they called themselves Earth Two?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Did you wash that?<eos> Did you wash that sweater? Yeah.<eos> Yes. I didn't dry it. I...
-He saw me when I left.<eos> -Green-wrapped?<eos> Where did you see him?<eos> -I saw him in the rearview mirror.<eos> -Did you see who it was?<eos> Can you show me that?<eos> I hope you did not take it amiss?<eos> He is not so fond of you.<eos> No.<eos> How was the car when we found it.
Don't suppose you can pretend not to have seen this when it shows up as a wedding gift.<eos> It's for me?<eos> Cow's out of the barn now.<eos> Please, pour yourself some tea.<eos> What's weighing on you, Katie-girl?<eos> Last time you stopped by unannounced was three years ago.<eos> Talking to you lifted my spirits, Ella Mae.<eos> The only thing that got me through some days.<eos> Well, I still have ears to hear.<eos> That envelop you give Mam the other day. May I ask how you come by it?
Well, you know, within reason.<eos> It's just so good to see you again.<eos> And you're going to be an amazing teacher.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Thanks. I wish I'd had more teachers like you. Not that I'd have got any work done.<eos> Miss Morley.<eos> AUTOMATED VOICE: You have no new messages.<eos> Comedy's a cruel mistress.<eos> Sometimes, Emma, I think the only way<eos> I'm going to see my name up in lights is if I change it to Emergency Exit.
I'm so happy you picked this dress, Veruca!<eos> - You look beautiful.<eos> - Doesn't she?<eos> You guys, I'm getting married!<eos> I'm getting married!<eos> Not without your veil, you're not.<eos> - Where is that bad boy?<eos> - Oh, I think I left it upstairs.<eos> I'll get it, sis.
Back then we had an Officer Torstensson.<eos> Year after year, he kept going back to this Rebecka case.<eos> Taking out the files, studying them over and over.<eos> We were young.<eos> We laughed at him.<eos> And that was also a missing-girl case?<eos> No, no, no, that's not why I mention it.<eos> I'm talking about the soul of a policeman.<eos> Poor old Torstensson never solved it.<eos> And he never let it go.
No.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Bye.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Lt's okay.<eos> I guess I must have alarmed you, turning up like that.<eos> If you touch me, I'll more than alarm you.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Your report, very detailed.<eos> - But for me, it wasn't very entertaining.
She died last year.<eos> She was in the garden with the laund and she fell at once, just like that.<eos> Heart attack.<eos> - How old was she?<eos> You know, we think we're free just because we go right or left.<eos> A rat in a labyrinth, goes right or left.<eos> We're rats, that's all.<eos> And there's no cheese at the end of the corridor, so...<eos> The labyrinth is in your head.<eos> If I want cheese, I buy it and I eat it.
"If I may say so, dear Professor, you make the mistake of treating your friends like patients.<eos> This enables you to reduce them to the level of children, so that their only choice is to become obsequious nonentities or bullying enforcers of the party line... while you sit on the mountaintop, the infallible father-figure and nobody dares to pluck you by the beard and say, Think about your behaviour and then decide which one of us is the neurotic.<eos> I speak as a friend.<eos> "Your letter cannot be answered.<eos> Your claim that I treat my friends like patients is self-evidently untrue.<eos> As to which of us is the neurotic, I thought we analysts were agreed a little neurosis was nothing whatever to be ashamed of.<eos> But a man like you, who behaves quite abnormally and then stands there shouting at the top of his voice how normal he is does give considerable cause for concern.<eos> For a long time now our relationship has been hanging by a thread.<eos> And a thread, moreover, mostly consisting of past disappointments.<eos> We have nothing to lose by cutting it.
And for the next 60 minutes you are my unwilling participants in a race for your life.<eos> - Here are the rules...<eos> - Yeah, fuck you!<eos> Back up!<eos> You better let me out right fuck... Aah!<eos> Oh, what the fuck are you doing to him?<eos> Rule number one:<eos> you never interrupt me.<eos> Jacque spent 15 years in a Japanese dojo learning that grip.<eos> And he never gets tired of it.
I was working as a mechanical and structural engineer when Vicky got stuck.<eos> So, you guys met her?<eos> Uh... yeah, we did.<eos> It's a terrible shame.<eos> She's my best friend's kid.<eos> That really hit me.<eos> I spent about a year working on developing the concept.<eos> Sooner or later the National Institute of Health gave me a 50,000 dollar grant... to develop a prototype for reproduction.<eos> Anyone ever use it?<eos> San Antonio Memorial Hospital used it for two years.
If it was the romance novelist in him that made Victoria, the Queen, such a pal, chalk it up as another brick in the legacy of Ben Disraeli,<eos> Earl of Beaconsield, educator, and Prime Minister of Great Britain!<eos> Dibiasi, that was great.<eos> That leaves only Mr Crowne and George Bernard Shaw.<eos> Uh, that's "Geography Show", remember?<eos> Right, the study of the Earth.<eos> Yes, study of the Earth, and there goes my opening remark.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The equator is that imaginary line that separates the Earth into the northern and the southern hemisphere.<eos> And when you cross it for the first time it's a very big deal if you are in the Navy, even if you're a culinary specialist.

And they play practical jokes on you.<eos> When I did it for the first time, years ago, a chief petty officer ordered me to stand watch until I saw the equator as we passed it, and I would recognize it by the big posts that were sunk into the ocean floor and spaced every 100 yards.
First, your great-grandfather, your grandfather, and now me.<eos> - Show-off.<eos> But if it's true!<eos> Yes!<eos> It fits!<eos> - What?<eos> Was great-grandfather in Greenland once?<eos> - Yes, he served under Erik the Red.<eos> The treasure of the gods is in the palace of the eternal ice!<eos> And we can get it!
There's the book.<eos> - Hm?<eos> Are you scared that I'll take it and swim away, or what?<eos> Runes.<eos> - Yes, seems to be something like a dictionary.<eos> Or a conundrum.<eos> - I like the guy with the hammer.<eos> It's Thor, the god of thunder.<eos> His hammer is the most powerful weapon of the gods.<eos> - I'd use it, instead of reading about it.
Please, take his harp!<eos> - Stop!<eos> I have one last question.<eos> How come you're so...<eos> We work out a lot and don't eat meat.<eos> Stop!<eos> Wait!<eos> We know where to find the treasure of the gods!<eos> Not bad, captain Wickie.<eos> - And we can get it for you!
And the god of thunder is Thor.<eos> These three belong together.<eos> Watch out, Wickie!<eos> - You don't have to do this, boy!<eos> Do you think I always run away, when things get tough!<eos> Get the treasure, Wickie!<eos> - Get him, Svenja!<eos> Thor's hammer.<eos> The most powerful weapon in the world.<eos> We must destroy it!
The most powerful weapon in the world.<eos> We must destroy it!<eos> - No!<eos> Svenja, watch out!<eos> Oh, crap!<eos> Don't move!<eos> You could even use the hammer to destroy ships!<eos> Or strike them with lightning!<eos> - The Valkyries said, that no one is supposed to get the hammer!<eos> - Better my father gets it than yours!

At least your father will finally be proud of you!
In airports.<eos> Getting from one plane to another. Runing and rushing, and not knowing ... Trying ... to figure it out ...<eos> Wondering if I'm gonna make it ...<eos> What do you think will happen if you do not succeed?<eos> I think I may get lost And that I may rot and die ...<eos> In ... some forgotten Empty Terminal that nobody even knows exists.<eos> And you miss your plane.<eos> No ... that's not really the fear ...<eos> Then what are you afraid of?<eos> I'm afraid of wondering if I'll miss it ...
- The body of Chris.<eos> Everything was there: the ownership, prostitution and human trafficking.<eos> Chris found out that you are married a pimp before with Frank.<eos> You had a motive to kill him.<eos> You do not want Frank understand.<eos> Is it true?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> Chris will take go from there.<eos> I was told that I could not, so he tried to blackmail me.<eos> I found the letter before Frank saw it.
Oh, no no...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I couldn't<eos> Come on.<eos> You'll hurt an old lady's feelings.<eos> Thanks, Miss, uh, Lee.<eos> I'm a really big fan of yours!<eos> "Like Mother Like Son" was one of my all time favorite shows, and you were amazing in it and in "The Waking of Eleanor".<eos> I love that film.<eos> Yeah, I used to watch it all the time growing up with my mom.
I thought the job was for the cars.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> All they want is the chip.<eos> Damn!<eos> You should've come clean.<eos> What's going on out here?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Please, Dom, just let me have the chip.<eos> I can take this to them.<eos> They'll give it to Reyes and set things right.
What?<eos> He won a Nobel Prize.<eos> - Yes, I know, Dad.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> -Barry Marshall.<eos> [GASPS THEN WHIMPERS]<eos> The Food and Drug Administration is accelerating approval of the MEV-1 vaccine currently in production at five secret locations in the U.S. and Europe saying the first doses could be available for human use within 90 days.<eos> The WHO estimates that it could take nearly a year to manufacture and distribute the necessary amount of the vaccine to stop the spread of the virus which so far has taken over 26 million lives worldwide.<eos> But as labs work around the clock to produce the life-saving formula the question remains:<eos> Who gets it first?
Hey!<eos> - It worked!<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> Okay, so this evening we are gonna raise this ball to the very top of the pole where it will stay until 11:59.<eos> And then the countdown begins.<eos> SAM:<eos> Can you fix it? - No.<eos> And don't you want to know why?<eos> Because the complicated machine behind me isn't called a fix truck. It's called a tow truck.<eos> That means I put the big hook under the broken car and take it anywhere you want.
And don't you want to know why?<eos> Because the complicated machine behind me isn't called a fix truck. It's called a tow truck.<eos> That means I put the big hook under the broken car and take it anywhere you want.<eos> - Which is where?<eos> - New York City.<eos> No again.<eos> Not today and not me.<eos> I've got big plans with my lady friend tonight.<eos> Sign there.<eos> Can you at least tow it to a mechanic nearby, please?
I'll explain.<eos> Friction tape, electrical tape.<eos> Talget, you had some, yeah?<eos> It's in there somewhere.<eos> Shotgun shell.<eos> Spear tip.<eos> The tip has to drive into the primer to set off the shell.<eos> Secure them with these sticks, a little bit of tape, simple.<eos> You jab with it when the wolf gets close. Hit them hard.<eos> Let it get real close.
Guys, get up.<eos> UP-<eos> What is it?<eos> Is it them?<eos> Saw marks.<eos> These trees have been logged.<eos> That's water.<eos> That sounds like a river.<eos> You gotta be shitting me.<eos> The river must be a good size if we can hear it all the way up here.
Are you confident you'll win even if Jun-shik Kim enters?<eos> You think he stands a chance against me?<eos> But aren't Jun-shik Kim's records better than yours?<eos> That was in the past<eos> You think a mere rickshaw driver can beat a well-trained marathoner?<eos> If you could enter, are you confident you can beat Hasegawa?<eos> How good can a mere rickshaw driver be?<eos> I'd be grateful just to enter the race<eos> Here is your acceptance letter from Berlin Medical University<eos> Sign it
I can't hear you!<eos> Are you saying something?<eos> Hey!<eos> This is incredible.<eos> What is this?<eos> This cupboard has to go down.<eos> Go!<eos> Ahh!<eos> Do you want to go in front?<eos> Don't let it fall.
Nothing happened.<eos> Cafeïïnevrije organic coffee with milk.<eos> I have allergies.<eos> What is this?<eos> - A guy has this issue.<eos> Stupid.<eos> No, this dose is not correct.<eos> Where's Reece with b. ..<eos> Listen.<eos> We make the stuff here and send it to you.

Hold this for a while.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Brave lad.<eos> Here we go.<eos> That has always followed.<eos> Cool.<eos> Why that light before his eyes?<eos> - Nothing 'his'.<eos> It is not human.<eos> That load it up, makes it not fall asleep.
Your Mercedes was parked in Sindre Aa's barn, and you drove his tractor into a ditch.<eos> - I've never heard that name. - We have several witnesses who saw...<eos> There is no truck parked outside Bamse Pub.<eos> No, but I've got more urgent matters now.<eos> Over and out.<eos> - But, Kjikerud... - Maybe you could check behind Kiwi.<eos> - We have several witnesses who...<eos> - Damn, there it is!<eos> Brugd here. Call Egmon. I can see his truck now.<eos> Probably his son stole it again. Over.
Miss Gandy, suppose I had information on someone in a position of power... harmful information.<eos> It goes against my nature to destroy such information... but I don't trust it in the general files either.<eos> Could I trust it with you?<eos> If we were to create a confidential file?<eos> Of course, Edgar.<eos> Thank you, Miss Gandy.<eos> Information is power.<eos> It protected us from the communists in 1919... and since has been vigilantly collected, organized, and maintained by our FBI.<eos> Attorney General Kennedy's Office.<eos> Did you always have this fireplace or did you have it put in?
- Emptiness.<eos> - A secret.<eos> - Death.<eos> You see? Architecture must grapple with all of these words.<eos> But first, there's something else, something essential, that's linked to all of them.<eos> The past?<eos> Almost.<eos> Memory.<eos> They asked me to submit another proposal.<eos> We sent it last week.
Good morning, Presage employees.<eos> We hope you're all ready for our exciting team-building retreat.<eos> Please enjoy your breakfast and then make your way to the bus, which will leave shortly.<eos> Hey, Sam, when I said, "Would you put breakfast together for the retreat?" I meant, like, some stale doughnuts, some coffee.<eos> But this is amazing.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Just remember that when you see my sales report for last month.<eos> Oh, I saw it last night.<eos> Shit.<eos> Has Dennis seen it?
Oh, wow, she just starts moving around as soon as she's free, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry, the building manager let you in?<eos> Yeah, sorry.<eos> Do you have extra keys to your apartment?<eos> Can I have one?<eos> I only have one key.<eos> - Really? - Yes.<eos> That's pretty risky.<eos> I mean, what would you do if you lost it?
It was huge.<eos> I swear. That's how I got this.<eos> So, it attacked.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I passed out, and when I woke up, it was gone.<eos> Is there anything else you can think of?<eos> Anything you can tell us, even if it doesn't seem important?<eos> Well, my ring got lost.<eos> Or else that thing stole it, if that makes any sense.
For simple vengeance.<eos> You're not fighting a war or anything, right?<eos> You can watch them every millisecond of every day.<eos> Because maybe you've heard... fate strikes when you least expect it.<eos> Balthazar, stop.<eos> Awkward.<eos> Set things right before I flick your precious boys off a cliff just on principle.<eos> Uh, sweetie, before we go, um, I could remove that stick from your...<eos> Don't try me.<eos> Oh. We'll leave it inserted, then.
Raphael will kill us all.<eos> He'll turn the world into a graveyard.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> No, you had a choice.<eos> You just made the wrong one.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> No, actually, it's not and you know that.<eos> Why would you keep this whole thing a secret, unless you knew it was wrong?<eos> When crap like this comes around, we deal with it like we always have.
You know a Jenny Yang, right?<eos> She's like my own child.<eos> Right, well, she was found murdered.<eos> Everybody, just calm down.<eos> I did not kill anyone.<eos> Why would I kill Jenny?<eos> Jenny's the one who told us about the counterfeit goods.<eos> She said you'd kill her if you found out.<eos> Jenny was a good Chinese girl, not like those other girls who pretended to be her friends.<eos> Yeah, really interesting-- or maybe Paisley just told her friend to get a cut of the action and you wouldn't give it to her.
Hello, beautiful lady who works with the dead.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> And hello, handsome man who works with...<eos> You're a gynecologist, Paul-- I shouldn't finish that. Yeah, I... understand.<eos> Listen, uh, I know it's wrong to bother you at work, but I saw these flowers, thought of today, and you.<eos> I just lost control.<eos> And I'm glad you did. Yeah.<eos> So I hope nothing here is going to prevent you from...<eos> Just a little murder, is all.<eos> A child could solve it.
You're like Heathcliff.<eos> Who's Heathcliff?<eos> Heathcliff from... from Wuthering Heights.<eos> Heathcliff was a real man, but misunderstood, forced to be something less.<eos> The way you had to give up your dreams, to... to drive a carriage.<eos> I can only imagine what that is like.<eos> Then, the woman you do all of that for-- she goes and gives her heart and the business to another man.<eos> Not even a full man.<eos> A half man.<eos> It's him I should have killed.
Are we?<eos> You talked to jurors.<eos> That's jury tampering.<eos> So, accusing one black man of a murder he ain't commit isn't good enough for you?<eos> Ya'll trying for the daily double?<eos> And I talked to a gang of folks in that courthouse.<eos> How am I supposed to know which one of them is a juror?<eos> Well, the juror badges on their shirts might have been a hint.<eos> Using video surveillance footage, CSU managed to pull Joe's coffee cup out of the garbage.<eos> They're testing it for cyanide.
Cigarette butts, chewing gum.<eos> Shoe prints, heel prints.<eos> Nah, nothing like that.<eos> Okay. What happened next?<eos> I slid in the ride, pulled the seat up, hit the ignition...<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> Did you say that you pulled the seat up? Yeah.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah, I'm sure.<eos> That bad boy was all the way back. So I hit the button on the side to move it up.
It's time to end this family feud.<eos> - Alexander, please listen to me.<eos> - I know I'm dying.<eos> [LIONEL GRUNTS]<eos> I'm aging faster and faster.<eos> I have all of Lex's memories.<eos> And he despised every single one of you.<eos> Listen to me, son.<eos> Don't let hate master you.<eos> Make it your servant. Use it.

Honey pie, come on over here.<eos> CHORUS:<eos> How do we do How do we do<eos> COP:<eos> Emil Hamilton, can you step off the stage, please?<eos> We got questions about an armored car that was stolen last night.<eos> Thank you very much, gentleman, I plead innocent to all charges.<eos> - I'm but a humble entertainer.<eos> - Funny.<eos> You can tell the judge how you made it vanish into thin air.
And I just tried calling the Chapel of Love, no answer.<eos> I may have one.<eos> An armored car company that lost a vehicle.<eos> From their security footage, the same that Emil's accused of stealing.<eos> Can you track this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can activate the truck's alarm system remotely, I think.<eos> Clark, listen for a high-pitched tone.<eos> [BEEPING]<eos> - I hear it.
- Lois, you're still engaged.<eos> You may just have to let go of the ring.<eos> I tell you what.<eos> My corporation, I may have lost it, but I'm gonna buy you an identical rock, okay?<eos> The last thing I wanna go around with for the rest of my life is a lie propagated by my ex-boyfriend.<eos> - Oh.<eos> The ring Clark gave me was a symbol of our love, of our future together.<eos> It wasn't just any ring, it was the ring.<eos> The big kahuna.<eos> I waited to find somebody who would get this wacky world view and care enough to give me the ring, and I lose it.
TESS:<eos> We got this.<eos> CLARK:<eos> I got it.<eos> - Oh.<eos> Uh... I'm so gun shy, I don't even know if I can try it.<eos> Here's the thing, Clark.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I bet the ring.<eos> I mean, I got it back, but...
I'm not gonna let the Blur be forgotten because some shiny object flies up into the sky.<eos> Booster is not the bright and shiny object we need to be worried about.<eos> What is this?<eos> A bug?<eos> That's what Ted Kord is looking for.<eos> I checked. It's extraterrestrial technology.<eos> When they brought this scarab in it bonded with Kord's scientist like it was a parasite.<eos> The guy's name was Dan Garrett.<eos> He and the scarab merged as one.<eos> Garrett killed three people and died when they tried to take it off.
Nice shooting, partner.<eos> Thanks.<eos> [HIGH-PITCHED TONE RINGING]<eos> Kara, are you all right?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Is this another trap?<eos> It's Jor-EI.<eos> [RINGING STOPS]<eos> I have to leave.<eos> You have to retrieve the bow and deliver it to Clark.
Lois?<eos> LOIS:<eos> Careful there.<eos> It's bad luck to peek at the bride before you get to the altar.<eos> Technically, you saw me this morning but the rules only apply when the wedding is on.<eos> On?<eos> Lois, I thought you called off the wedding.<eos> Don't have a cow, farm boy.<eos> But I read your vows.<eos> And I know that that is against the rules but a little birdie bridesmaid gave it to me...
You're thinking, "Wow, he's rich.<eos> He's famous.<eos> He's got great abs."<eos> Personal trainer.<eos> You couldn't afford that. I used to be fat.<eos> I used to eat junk food.<eos> You probably still do.<eos> But you're going, "Wow, look at him.<eos> How much did that suit cost him?"<eos> Nothing. I got it for free.
Backwards one. Oh!<eos> Diagonal two.<eos> Now do-se-do.<eos> While your father and brother are doing some manly bonding in the woods, I thought we could do a little bonding of our own.<eos> We'll do each other's nails, make some brownie sundaes and watch the four saddest horse movies I could find.<eos> Broken-Leg Beauty,<eos> Sorry, Silver, No More Mint Juleps.<eos> And the fourth one has a title so sad I can't even say it.<eos> Really?<eos> Can I see it?
He is great.<eos> In '57, I saw him turn the Secretary of Agriculture into the Secretary of the Interior!<eos> It was hell on their wives, but it sure brought down corn prices.<eos> Built a house outta corn.<eos> Worst house I ever owned!<eos> When it got real hot, it smelled like Fritos.<eos> Lisa can't be a magician!<eos> That's my thing!<eos> I'm the one that got a magic set for Christmas two years ago.<eos> You never even opened it.
Pasta, soy.<eos> You know what's a bad pizza topping?<eos> Broccoli!<eos> But I worked so hard.<eos> I've got dirt under my fingernails I'll never get out.<eos> Not that I'm going to try.<eos> I'm sorry, Bart.<eos> Take the last truffle.<eos> Do whatever you want.<eos> Sell it, eat it.

I was gonna shake 'em down for field trip money, but what I heard shook me worse than my dad when I was a baby.<eos> Sir, this bus is too heavy to cross the ice bridge.<eos> They'll have to take a more circuitous route. There's no time to be safe!<eos> Now bang the side of that bus!<eos> Bang it twice!<eos> That bus never came back.<eos> So the answer to our mystery lies on the other side of that ice bridge. But it's summertime.<eos> The ice bridge will be a water nothing.<eos> Hey, kids!<eos> If I tossed you guys a bucket full of something, could you pour it out and toss the bucket back up?
He said I was cheap.<eos> Cheap?<eos> Now even kids talk like this...<eos> It's all just money, money, money...<eos> As if we had a coin-shitting donkey in Germany.<eos> Huseyin!<eos> - What? It's true!<eos> Fatma!<eos> A power failure.<eos> Sons of bitches Why pay for electricity, when they just switch it on and off as they please?
Dana, give me a break.<eos> You were five years old, you barely knew her.<eos> High five.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Get that camera out of my face.<eos> Look at that, it's right over there.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Come on, lunch is ready.<eos> Daddy, can I try the camera?<eos> Dana, go get your bucket, the waves are gonna get it.
What the hell's happening? Is Jenny okay?<eos> She told me to go home.<eos> And I got there and...<eos> You walked into something.<eos> Who were they?<eos> They want what you've got.<eos> What could I possibly have...<eos> The decryption key.<eos> They want the decryption key.<eos> The file's worthless without it.
Rameesh Nayam-Singh is a slumdog billionaire, literally.<eos> He's an orphan who grew up on the streets of Mumbai and within a few short years built an empire in tech support and call centres.<eos> Most recently, he's expanded into IT security with huge overseas contracts.<eos> He's also given millions of dollars to his various refugee charities in Chad, Somalia, Sudan, Afghanistan.<eos> Every single one in a war-torn country.<eos> That's where you tend to find refugees.<eos> All these countries are in unstable areas where there's big money to be made if you're in right business, big money.<eos> There had been rumors of black market dealings and subsequent investigations, but no one has linked him to anything shady.<eos> Singh also owns the Kress nightclub along with about six others.<eos> Every time he can't get into a club, he buys it.
Listen to me.<eos> I know it says click with the mouse, but on a laptop, the trackpad is the mouse.<eos> Now, put your finger on it.<eos> Doesn't matter which finger.<eos> Good choice.<eos> Now move it down to your e-mail icon.<eos> Yeah, the little envelope.<eos> What do you mean, "What does it look like ?"<eos> It looks like an envelope !<eos> Fine, you don't like the computer, don't use it !

You're a very smart man.<eos> How do you think I landed such a rich husband?<eos> I hadn't really given it much thought.<eos> Well, think about it.<eos> Do you mean...?<eos> Yep. I'm that good.<eos> Oh, what the hell.<eos> Good morning, slut.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, please, I recognize the walk of shame when I see it.
You guys are on a date. We can hang out anytime.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Bye. Good night.<eos> Oh, that's, hot, hot, hot, hot!<eos> It really sneaks up on ya, huh?<eos> All right, I gotta go.<eos> It is pretty spicy.<eos> Oh, I've been meaning to tell you, I figured out your magic trick.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, yes. In fact, I improved upon it.
Licensed to practice law in three countries and your face.<eos> All right, based on a cursory reading, it doesn't look like you have much of a case, Sheldon. Do so, do so.<eos> Oh, I'm afraid not.<eos> Section seven here, on the right to enter the bathroom in emergency situations, is not specific as to what constitutes an emergency.<eos> A bathroom emergency is self-explanatory.<eos> Is it?<eos> If Leonard forgot to trim his nose hair, could he barge in while you were showering?<eos> Leonard doesn't trim his nose hair.<eos> He thinks because he's short nobody can see up there.<eos> My point is, Sheldon, the legal principle is, ambiguity in a contract benefits the party that did not draft it, in this case, Leonard.
We got you something else, too.<eos> Wow, thanks.<eos> It's so cool!<eos> I've wanted one of them for ages!<eos> Great.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> You know, it's actually an antique, it's nearly 50 years old.<eos> An old teddy bear.<eos> Cool.<eos> I love it, Dad, really.
The danger, however, has been averted.<eos> Now that we have this.<eos> - Now, I know what you're going to say, it's a pretty small object<eos> Well, it's often the little things that pack the biggest punch.<eos> - After all, David killed Goliath with a pebble.<eos> - Sir.<eos> The mighty Vortex has been slain by my possession of this small key.<eos> Shoooshan.<eos> Susan.<eos> We got it, but Fisher talked.
Yes, you're head of security.<eos> Everything's going perfectly.<eos> Today we climb the mountain!<eos> Agent English.<eos> The people have spoken, and the message is clear.<eos> A future of peace and prosperity!<eos> The backup electrical supply has been cut.<eos> No, it hasn't.<eos> It's been turned off.<eos> Do you know how to turn it on?
I think it's sweet.<eos> Actually, don't worry about it, partner.<eos> There are plenty of other jokes in the universe we can share.<eos> Let's just get ready for tonight.<eos> Some well deserved vacation.<eos> - I got a good one for you, Violet.<eos> - Lay it on me!<eos> Oh, dang!<eos> - What?<eos> - I think I forgot it.
Yes, that's my address.<eos> What are you doin'?<eos> He's writing a letter.<eos> To who?<eos> To "whom".<eos> To whom?<eos> His daughter.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> What?<eos> I'll write it for you.
Okay, so, uh, how about surfing tomorrow?<eos> You know, as friends?<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Um... There's just one thing I got to take care of.<eos> Yeah, you go take care of your one thing and I'll see you in the water.<eos> - Sounds good. - All right.<eos> - I'm gonna go, uh, clean up. - You do that.<eos> I love the service at this hotel.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love it more.
It's all right.<eos> I'm glad I waited.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I ran out of gas, and then I ran.<eos> - You ran?<eos> - Nearly a mile.<eos> I felt like I was in Run, Lola, Run.<eos> Certainly got the hair for it.<eos> - You a fan of that movie?<eos> - I loved it.
Get on the dispatch.<eos> We're gonna need an ambulance.<eos> Peter!<eos> I gotta go!<eos> I gotta go!<eos> Where's your, uh, your inhaler?<eos> No.<eos> It's not in there.<eos> The bald man in the store...<eos> He took it.
But when he did resurface, he bought this house.<eos> - All cash.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> So who is she?<eos> She was obviously important to him.<eos> Maybe she knows where is.<eos> You okay?<eos> Do you still think about her?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Well, you've bought me a hundred cups of coffee and you know that I take it black with one sugar, but this morning you bought me one with milk, and I'm assuming that that's the way
Here one second, - gone the next.<eos> - What are you saying, Walter?<eos> And the tear is beginning right here!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Walter, what are you looking for?<eos> My seismograph.<eos> How am I supposed to measure micro-quakes without my damn seismographs?<eos> Walter, we keep 'em in the back.<eos> Then why are you all sitting around?<eos> I'll go get it.
And I'd have to figure out how to do that. Dunham.<eos> Olivia, I'm picking up all kinds of seismic activity in Park Slope.<eos> It's happening again.<eos> South side of the street is clear, Sir.<eos> Move west and merge with Team Bravo.<eos> I want an update in five.<eos> Is that the ambering device?<eos> I've prepared a remote detonator, so your agent won't get caught in it.<eos> You two, take this cylinder.<eos> Place it in the stairwell, then report directly to me, quickly.
Dunham.<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - What's wrong? A security breach at the wormhole.<eos> Someone in the park ID'd Moreau.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello, Peter.<eos> Why'd you leave me the key, Walter?<eos> I knew you'd recognize it.
What's wrong? It's not the coat checker.<eos> I'm sorry, are we friends?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Oh, excellent.<eos> Thank you. I had a horrible fight with my mother.<eos> I tried to be Indra Nooyi and while I admit that choice may have been a bit random the other choice was to be my mother, and I didn't want that.<eos> Why not?<eos> You care about fashion more than most people care about, well, anything.<eos> You used to send girls home crying from Constance for wearing tights as pants.<eos> Well, somebody had to. It was for the greater good. Like my suggestion that you take off that tie and shove it in your pocket right now.
You're looking at her.<eos> Oh, God, what'd you do to her?<eos> She's in a better place.<eos> She's in Bali doing downward dogs with some British Wally named prat or prat named Wally.<eos> In any case, she quit.<eos> That's great.<eos> My only contact at Conde Nast has been replaced by a stapler stealer.<eos> And I will staple whatever's in your sweaty hand to your jeans if you don't leave this instant.<eos> What's in my hand is an article.<eos> Epperly said she'd get it to "Details."
And I will staple whatever's in your sweaty hand to your jeans if you don't leave this instant.<eos> What's in my hand is an article.<eos> Epperly said she'd get it to "Details."<eos> I'm assuming you can't do the same.<eos> I-I did... I did kinda get this job for you.<eos> Only after you got me fired.<eos> How many times must I repeat myself?<eos> We are not friends.<eos> Just because we went to go see a movie... Or five together does mean that I'll go out on a limb for you.<eos> Okay, well, how about I just drop it in your in-box?
I mean, I was actually coming over here to quit anyway, but...<eos> You leaked a private document.<eos> Granted, that's exactly what I wanted you to do, but still.<eos> I can't have someone around I don't trust.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> What just happened?<eos> Blair.<eos> I'm looking for Chuck.<eos> What is this place?<eos> Uh, he built it for Raina.
I don't get what Mason was even doing here in the first place.<eos> His brother died, you know that.<eos> But why was he stupid enough to stay and get himself killed?<eos> Because of this rock he was trying to find.<eos> - What rock?<eos> - A moonstone.<eos> - I had no idea.<eos> - What?<eos> Moonstone.<eos> - Did he find it?
I just... I don't wanna be like this anymore.<eos> I'm sorry, Elena.<eos> ELENA:<eos> It's okay.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> You know what the great thing about buckshot is?<eos> It scatters through the body.<eos> Maximum damage.<eos> - Where's the moonstone? - Get over it, honey. You're never gonna get it.
When the tree burned, all hope was thought lost."<eos> [ELENA SCOFFS]<eos> He was trying to figure out how to kill an Original.<eos> "But the ash from the tree was saved and witches forged a dagger to which the ash could be bonded.<eos> This alchemic bond provides the necessary poison..."<eos> Elena.<eos> I wonder if this is true.<eos> I mean, do you think this dagger actually exists?<eos> I know it does.<eos> Because John gave it to Damon.
Then one of you is gonna have to come with me to the Lockwood luncheon.<eos> - That'd be me. Not me.<eos> I've witch stuff to attend to with Bonnie.<eos> Does that mean that you're taking her to the...?<eos> Don't get quiet on my account.<eos> If you have a plan to combat the impending vampire doom please do tell.<eos> Seriously. What is the plan to get us out of this mess, hmm?<eos> I delivered you a moonstone a werewolf, and a dagger to lure and kill Klaus. And right now, all you have is a moonstone.<eos> - Or so you tell me.<eos> - No, we have it.
- Klaus is in Alaric's body.<eos> - What?<eos> - He's possessing it or something.<eos> - Go find Stefan. Now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now.<eos> - Can you kill him?<eos> - He's got some protection spell.<eos> You have the power of a hundred witches.<eos> Break it.
[KNIFE CLATTERS]<eos> Klaus and I faked the Sun and Moon Curse dating back over a thousand years.<eos> - But if there's no curse...<eos> - There's a curse.<eos> Just not that one.<eos> The real one's much worse.<eos> It's a curse placed on Klaus.<eos> [CELL PHONE BUZZING]<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Klaus has been trying to break it the last thousand years and you are his hope.
NARRATOR:<eos> Previously on Vampire Diaries:<eos> - You must be Elena.<eos> - How do we look exactly alike?<eos> You're a doppelganger, the key to breaking the curse.<eos> ELIJAH:<eos> Klaus is a vampire of werewolf bloodline.<eos> The curse has kept his werewolf from manifesting.<eos> But if he breaks it, he'll be a true hybrid.
I'm gonna go in the walk-in and cry.<eos> Degustation's got what?<eos> We have--<eos> We have the razor clams, the salmon, the cod.<eos> Now he's gonna squeeze in some fucking lobster?<eos> Why not just shove a goddamn pineapple up my ass?<eos> He's giving it the saucier.<eos> The chef's been looking at her funny all night.<eos> - You know the look?<eos> - Yeah, I've seen it.

That's why I try not to look at the guy, you know--
We've been on the downhill slide for a very long time.<eos> This is a second chance for this city.<eos> You know, at one time we were the biggest city in the South.<eos> Then Houston and Atlanta and Dallas left us in the dust.<eos> Now people say, "why rebuild New Orleans at all?" Have you heard that in Dallas?<eos> A little.<eos> I bet you have.<eos> But there has to be a city here.<eos> The mouth of the Mississippi-- Has to be a port here.<eos> The nation needs it.
- Yeah.<eos> I used to do that too.<eos> You didn't tell your mama, did you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> She might not understand.<eos> We want to do that-- me, denard and Charles and them.<eos> We want to play on the street like the baby boys.<eos> Can you help us?<eos> How do you expect to solve this case if you don't work it?
Jindal reps the first congressional district.<eos> He is really young.<eos> But he jumped into the governor's race three years ago and he showed pretty well.<eos> He got a committee up?<eos> Not yet.<eos> He's gonna announce in January.<eos> Well, you know I'm in. Better than that,<eos> I can make me calls in Dallas, bring some real rain.<eos> Bless you, my son.<eos> Hey, you show me a ring and I'll kiss it.
Yes, you can. You can do anything.<eos> That's a great win, Natalie.<eos> - It was beautiful.<eos> Hydrate.<eos> What about you, Ned?<eos> What are you feeling?<eos> I just... I feel really hot.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you want to expand on that?<eos> All I want is to take that pitcher and just dump it onto my penis and balls.
I'm gonna carve a billboard into his chest.<eos> You better get that knife away from me!<eos> Easy Slick, I think you might be hurting him.<eos> God, Jesus God boys. What ever happened to delicacy and finesse?<eos> This is so you'll never forget what you are.<eos> I thought this was a police station.<eos> Not a fucking circus.<eos> I just wanted to help.<eos> And don't forget you fucking piece of shit, everyday is garbage day for street trash like you.<eos> Hey. You're so hot, you make me want to cut my dick off and rub it all over your titties.
That is terrific.<eos> So with any luck, we can get rid of all those Charleston Chews in the vending machines.<eos> Um, dean Pelton, were you hoping to participate - in the show?<eos> - Oh, I would love to, Annie.<eos> But as you can see from my outfit, I already have plans, so off to the airport Ramada!<eos> How come he gets a front stinger?<eos> ♪ Give me some rope, time in a tree<eos> ♪ give me the hope to run out of steam<eos> Do you think bees eat their own honey?<eos> I'm sure they've at least tasted it.
You'll do twice as much work as a doctor for half the pay?<eos> Thank you?<eos> It's called a complisult.<eos> Part compliment, part insult.<eos> He invented them. I coined the term.<eos> See what I just did there?<eos> That was an explanabrag.<eos> Hello, Jeffrey.<eos> Pierce.<eos> I've thought about this day many times, but I've always imagined it differently.
Yes, I-I miss cleansing our fields and forests of the unclean people who stole my country.<eos> I miss the smell of the villages burning. I miss the way they used to run from our tanks in fear.<eos> Ah, damn it.<eos> My neighbor is jazz musician.<eos> Hey, Spencer, come on, man.<eos> I got woman in here!<eos> Great. He really knows how to kill the mood.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Did you look for a job today?<eos> I was going to, but I noticed your coffee table's wobbly, so I decided to fix it.
Baby chickens, diamond forks, brand-name sodas.<eos> Then he's gonna bring him back here, give him whatever's in there, and that's that.<eos> Troy who?<eos> Is that what I think it is?<eos> It is.<eos> Certificate of authenticity...<eos> He must have got it on eBay or something.<eos> Jeff got Abed the actual briefcase from the movie Pulp Fiction!<eos> What are you guys doing?<eos> Chang made me open it!
And what kind of ice cream company does this?<eos> Where's the paintball stuff from last year?<eos> I hid it so the school doesn't get destroyed again.<eos> Too late.<eos> Oh, hi, Jeff.<eos> We just ran into the Black Rider.<eos> Dean, if you want this game to end, we need firepower.<eos> In there.<eos> The key's in my shorts.<eos> I can get it out, I guess.
Dios mio!<eos> That's ridiculous!<eos> Mr. Peppy doesn't eat bones.<eos> I raised him on a simple diet of brussels sprouts and mixed soda.<eos> At least there's only one of them.<eos> The good news is, they can't start breeding.<eos> The bad news, everyone, is, the beast reproduces asexually.<eos> A single bone vampire, left alone with some quiet music and some bone vampire porn, could produce dozens of deadly offspring.<eos> That lucky bastard.<eos> I say kill it!
NASA's going to pick one kid's experiment to launch into space.<eos> I could make a space experiment.<eos> I just got a new thing of glitter.<eos> I'm not sure science is your thing, seeing how that chimp at the zoo tricked you out of your allowance.<eos> Yeah, well, I'll show you and Mr. Bananas.<eos> Anyway, I've got nothing better to do while I'm sick in bed.<eos> Wait, that's it.<eos> I'll make a space experiment about the common cold.<eos> Where's that contest flyer?<eos> You're holding it, genius.
A wise man an once said that nothing really dies, it just comes back in a new form.<eos> Then he died.<eos> So next time you see a lowly salamander, think twice before you step on it.
- It's between East and West Berlin.<eos> Where the Berlin Wall begins.<eos> - Where do we go now?<eos> - A small detour.<eos> How deep are we?<eos> 25 meters.<eos> In the Third Reich workers were forced to sleep here.<eos> Are you cold?<eos> I have a jersey if you want.<eos> - You can use it.
Be resourceful.<eos> Does anyone have any ideas about which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?<eos> Anyone?<eos> George?<eos> George?<eos> Yeah?<eos> I was asking what conclusion you came to in the exercise we're doing.<eos> Sorry.<eos> About what, again?<eos> About which elements of the novel pinpoint it as part of the Romantic movement?
Every time I think about a subject, or even try to visualize an image of what I think I should paint, I just feel like I'm full of shit, like I'm trying to be something I'm not.<eos> George, this is who you are.<eos> This stuff is wonderful, man.<eos> It really is. It's fantastic.<eos> Really?<eos> No, they're just doodles, you know, immature crap.<eos> No, man.<eos> This is what you should be painting.<eos> At least until you evolve into something else, you know what I mean?<eos> But you gotta exercise the muscle even if you're not feeling it, you know what I mean?
- Yeah, I get it.<eos> Wait. Hold up.<eos> Is this your idea, or did Art suggest this?<eos> Suggest what?<eos> Shit.<eos> He did.<eos> - I owe him one.<eos> - What for? Well, he took you off my hands, didn't he?<eos> Dan, I went to Kentucky.<eos> I did my job, and as far as I'm concerned, I did it well.
Been away so long, you forgot to call me Mags.<eos> I didn't want to presume.<eos> Loretta, this is Raylan Givens.<eos> He used to be a big baseball player in high school.<eos> Now he's a Federal.<eos> Look at poor Loretta, eyes drooping, us talking about the old days.<eos> You run along home, Loretta. Let us ancients catch up.<eos> Can I interest you in some apple pie?<eos> I remember your apple pie.<eos> I make it 180 proof.

Well, actually I was thinking about writing her a note.<eos> You mean like one with words on it?<eos> I've got it all figured out.<eos> I'm gonna pass her a note with a question on it, but it'll be anonymous.<eos> She'll be like, "I have to know who wrote this."<eos> Then later, I'll walk up to her and ask her the exact same question.<eos> It'll blow her mind.<eos> A note?<eos> Do you want me to spell check it?<eos> Just pass it to Holly.
-Me too.<eos> -Why the big smile?<eos> -He poked me with his dick. Artur.<eos> -Artur.<eos> -He poked you with his dick?<eos> -What do you mean?<eos> -I was outside.<eos> Artur came.<eos> He stood beside me, opened his fly and got out his boner.<eos> He pushed it against my thigh. Like this.
You know, I could use men like you in my operation.<eos> School my people in some urban combat, teach them how to shoot properly.<eos> I don't think you wanna turn your home into a war zone, do you?<eos> Look around you.<eos> Greeting this place, isn't it?<eos> Let me tell you something:<eos> You already been working for me.<eos> Them Taliban, they done put the drug trade in recession before 9/11.<eos> You're not fighting the drug trade...<eos> You're protecting it.
But that woman in the other room,<eos> I can help her-- I can do something about that.<eos> So...<eos> So let me...<eos> Please.<eos> What?<eos> You let her come on the mission?<eos> She pays the bills, Harry.<eos> I don't let her do anything.<eos> She came up with a reasonable plan, and I knew I could make it work. All right.
Listen, now, once you open that door, your body's is gonna raise the temperature in that room fast, which means you'll only have ten seconds to get it back down.<eos> Seven... Six...<eos> And that, my friends, is how it's done.<eos> Are you sure the lasers are there?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> All right, Chance, you're up.<eos> Got to get to that computer.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> The table isn't where it was in Winston's plan.<eos> Somebody must have moved it.
Why would you discuss Bangkok with him of all people?<eos> You know what kind of a big mouth this guy is?<eos> You know what? Every time we work without Chance, you act like this.<eos> It's getting a little old.<eos> Did you shut down the freight elevator?<eos> You said you were locking everything down in the back.<eos> I said get the alarms and the electronics locked down.<eos> The freight elevator controls are with them!<eos> Freight elevator is in the back.<eos> Can't we just shut it down now?
Do you always get so close to the delivery boy?<eos> That is my brother.<eos> Look, I don't know what you came here to do.<eos> But what you're saying is crazy.<eos> Yeah, you're telling me, darling.<eos> The kind of crazy I live for.<eos> We're pretty sure your son stole that SUV, Mrs. Jackson.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Our neighbor was on vacation, ok?<eos> Mark and his friends just borrowed it.
It means that you don't really, honestly, don't think that she's a hero.<eos> Can I ask you something, Kent?<eos> Did your sister have something to do with the accident?<eos> Uh, Ilene was-- Ilene was playing.<eos> She was a kid.<eos> Playing how?<eos> I bet I know.<eos> With a ball, right?<eos> With a fun ball.<eos> Bouncing it off the Dash.
that's what I love.<eos> What I miss.<eos> Being part of a team.<eos> Helping wildly talented people achieve their wildest dreams.<eos> Having an expense account, a car allowance... a young nubile assistant to fetch me my caramel macchiato.<eos> Done.<eos> You convince your client to take this job, make sure he doesn't shit the bed, and you can have your old job back.<eos> Happy?<eos> Oh, just one little thing.<eos> Try keeping your fucking dick in your pants this time. Or I will rip it off with my bare hands.
One... eleven.<eos> - Eleven. - Eleven!<eos> Well, it's double digits, sounds good.<eos> Perfectly respectable number for a cock of your caliber.<eos> And it reminds me of spinal taps.<eos> Cheers!<eos> I gotta get it up to 100.<eos> Triple digits.<eos> Then I can die happy.<eos> Hmm. You may have to criogenically freeze your cock and attach it to Brad Pitt to get there, buddy boy.
- If you say so.<eos> - Don't be such a naysayer.<eos> You'll get frown lines.<eos> Then you'll have to Botox that shit. - Hank, what do you want?<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> I'd like to come in and grab my one and only suit. - I got some legal doings this AM.<eos> - Too late.<eos> Threw it out. Bullshit.<eos> You would never throw away a man's suit.<eos> You'd donate it, maybe, but that's ridiculous.
Next to her, the Algerian.<eos> Samira.<eos> That young one there is 15. She's a virgin.<eos> I can send for a boy too.<eos> 19, very pretty.<eos> He can be here in an hour.<eos> I need to think about it.<eos> - Do you like champagne?<eos> - Not really.<eos> But he loves it.
High shall live Three cheers<eos> Sun, Lena.<eos> This is for you.<eos> (Max) All the best.<eos> All the best, princess.<eos> Do I get a cocoa first blow out the candles?<eos> You slap.<eos> Look, Lena:<eos> a letter from Mom.<eos> Do you want to open is not it?
There is a chill in the air.<eos> A familiar one.<eos> I'll prepare your chariot, my lord.<eos> Geirmarr, I seek an audience with your father.<eos> You may speak to me.<eos> Then I will state it simply for your benefit.<eos> You violate our peace accord by your presence here.<eos> We no longer have an accord.<eos> Thor made positive of that.<eos> King Thrym, was our truce so tenuous that it could be broken by a youth's careless trespass?
- What'd I say, man?<eos> I said don't try to be a hero, dog.<eos> Use your head, man.<eos> You don't wanna get shot.<eos> - What's up, dog?<eos> - What?<eos> - That was--you--you--<eos> How'd you do it?<eos> - I have an item here.<eos> - Keep it, take it. It's good.
Get it?<eos> Got it?<eos> Good! We will flip a coin to see who receives the ball.<eos> - Pink Team, you call it.<eos> - Heads it is.<eos> - We'll receive.<eos> All right, shake hands.<eos> OK, then.<eos> Run, moron, run!<eos> Take it, take it.
We have a problem.<eos> No.<eos> What are you talking... ?<eos> Sarah just has butterflies... Look, moron. Look!<eos> The ring.<eos> Walker!<eos> Check your six. By your feet.<eos> Bartowski dropped the ring.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Pick it up. Pick it up. Pick it up.
Devon! My water just broke.<eos> But you're not due yet.What is Baby Clara thinking?<eos> Well,it happened about ten minutes ago.<eos> I took a shower, and had a protein bar, and now I'm ready to go,so... Let's go have a baby.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm prepared for this.<eos> Yes,you are.You have a plan.You have an awesome plan.<eos> Okay,everything's gonna be just fine.<eos> Where's my push mix?<eos> I just got it from Chuck.It couldn't have disappeared.
I have no idea.<eos> Wait.<eos> Where's Ian?<eos> Don't worry, he went to Philly to be with Melissa.<eos> I didn't realize life existed at this hour.<eos> Come on, guys, just walk.<eos> You need to see this.<eos> I always hoped my first sunrise would have tequila in it.<eos> I'll make coffee.<eos> Well, when it's ready just pour it down my throat.
Um...<eos> I was wondering if you could look over my reading assignment.<eos> Perhaps this could wait until after the makeup test has been administered.<eos> Actually... It would be great if you could just review it now.<eos> So I know I'm on the right track?<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you think of my work so far?<eos> Looks outstanding.<eos> Great.<eos> Then I'll turn it in at the end of the day.
- By yourself?<eos> - No, uh, I was with a friend.<eos> I gotta get to class.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> Are you reading that fast or fanning yourself?<eos> What?<eos> Uhm, sorry.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Uhm, I left my lip gloss in the history stack.<eos> Gotta find it.
The second succumbed to his wounds earlier this evening.<eos> Agents with the DEA and FBI in conjunction with APD are working with Mexican law enforcement in an attempt to identify the deceased suspects.<eos> I can give you the highlights.<eos> Your nephews grew impatient.<eos> They continued to press me for my permission to kill Walter White.<eos> When I wouldn't give it, they settled instead for DEA Agent Schrader.<eos> But a phone call was placed to Agent Schrader moments before the attack. Thus giving him the upper hand.<eos> Marco was shot in the face and died instantly.<eos> Leonel lingered for several hours.<eos> The warning call to the DEA agent Juan Bolsa may have some insight into who placed it.
The guy drives a 10-year-old Volvo. It's brilliant.<eos> Anyway, listen what I need for you to do stick this on it.<eos> GPS tracker.<eos> Wifey thinks hubby's screwing around on her but she wants to be sure?<eos> Stick this on the car...<eos> This part here, it's a magnet.<eos> ...and see where he goes.<eos> Cool, huh?<eos> Two eighty-nine from SkyMall.<eos> It's not live-view, so we gotta come back later and take it off and stick it in the computer.
- I wouldn't.<eos> So what?<eos> Is this going to be a regular thing now?<eos> Meth cooking and corpse disposal? Jesus.<eos> Just grab us a spare barrel, Walter.<eos> What was it this time?<eos> What did this poor bastard do to piss off Gus?<eos> Or did Gus just need to send another message?<eos> Shut your mouth.<eos> You shut your mouth, or I'll shut it for you.
Nothing is gonna happen to me.<eos> The past<eos> - I've dealt with it.<eos> Now,if you can't,then that's your problem.<eos> Whoa,Cate,Cate,come on.<eos> Just let her go,all right?<eos> Wow.<eos> Still a dump.<eos> It actually looked a lot like this the first time I ever saw the place,back in 2007.<eos> I renovated it,installed the bar.
No, you're not.<eos> You're a survivor.<eos> I could take the beatings.<eos> I mean, they'd happened for so long, I didn't even feel the pain anymore.<eos> Even when he, uh when he made sure to hit me in places that... no one would see.<eos> But Travis knew<eos> I was getting numb so, he started looking for new ways to hurt me.<eos> You know, to control me.<eos> He was looking for my breaking point.<eos> That night, he found it.
I will not expose my subjects to another massacre like Legroño.<eos> So tonight we go to ground in silver.<eos> And then what?<eos> We brace for the resurrection.<eos> We left our clothes in the woods.<eos> You want me to go get them?<eos> Don't you dare move.<eos> You still there?<eos> I'm listening to your heart beat.<eos> I can feel it.
Andreas?<eos> - Hey, Thomas.<eos> - I have something for you.<eos> From David.<eos> This is Nikolev Tutorov.<eos> The fox chasing the chicken.<eos> - Russian is not my strong point.<eos> - The fox is singing to a chicken.<eos> About love.<eos> In the end, the chicken falls in love with the fox. And lets it in.
Whether it's rented or his own, it's fancy and black.<eos> It has to look good.<eos> He meets the victim after work. He has a regular job.<eos> And friends and maybe a family.<eos> Like all sociopaths he's an expert at making things look good on the surface.<eos> - Why is he doing it?<eos> - Why indeed?<eos> Cutting them into 20 parts.<eos> He's turned on by omnipotence.<eos> Not by the killing itself, but by the careful planning and execution of it.
Leila isn't a foreigner.<eos> She married your son, you've received her in your house, We welcomed her into our village.<eos> One day a Frenchman asked me:<eos> "What were the happiest moments of your life?<eos> ' I replied: "All up to the age of 14."<eos> You know why.<eos> I was married off at 14.<eos> I found out about "it" on my wedding night.<eos> And like you all, I didn't see him until next morning when he opened the shutters.<eos> I didn't see it during the night. He made it all dark and just raped me.
Let's go.<eos> They need a new central defender.<eos> No doubt.<eos> They're here.<eos> Stay cool.<eos> They're approaching the container.<eos> Get ready.<eos> They have the package.<eos> No one knows about this container.<eos> I made it disappear.
She's one of the cleverest people in England.<eos> Miss Cathcart.<eos> (McNair) Stand.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - (Boys) Good evening.<eos> Sit. Please sit.<eos> How many of you did Walter Portman talk to about this ghost?<eos> Well, did any of you see this ghost boy for yourselves?<eos> I did, miss.<eos> I saw it.
Thank you.<eos> And kitchen equipment.<eos> Pots and pans. Yeah.<eos> Is that a good living?<eos> You know, it's not like we had any banner years or anything.<eos> It was tough starting out.<eos> As long as I'm out there every morning with my sample case and my catalog, it's a living.<eos> Although the cast-iron roasting pans do pick up around the holidays.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When you saw that a hamster was terrified why didn't you bring it home?

Now that I know you two, I'm not surprised what's-his-name...<eos> Zachary may have some behavioral issues.<eos> - When you killed that hamster...<eos> - Killed?<eos> - Killed.<eos> - I killed the hamster?<eos> Yes.<eos> I definitely did not kill that hamster. - Worse.<eos> - Worse!<eos> You left it out there, trembling with fear in a hostile environment.
- Here you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - This is really good.<eos> - Yes, it's really good, dear.<eos> Like always.<eos> - I got the engine running today.<eos> - Really?<eos> On the first try.<eos> Next year it will be 40 years since dad bought that engine from his brother Gundi.<eos> And he had it for 5 years.

Looking for evidence of an engagement ring.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Linda's mother.<eos> Dave asked her parents' permission to marry her.<eos> - Oh, they didn't think to mention that?<eos> - They felt guilty.<eos> They thought Dave killed Linda because they said no.<eos> What's that? The ring.<eos> We canvassed the area and, uh, found a pawnshop near Dave's work.<eos> He hit up his foreman for the money to buy it.
- Why not?<eos> Ethan.<eos> I know I should know, because...<eos> - Nikki was on colchicine.<eos> - And colchicine is used to treat gout.<eos> There is no way she could develop a gout flare like that.<eos> Are we sure she was on colchicine?<eos> According to her medical records, 3 milligrams a day.<eos> We do have her pill dispenser.<eos> Get it.
He wanted to change her choice of charity.<eos> Where did Nikki want her money to go to?<eos> An environmental fund. Uh...<eos> Rain forests?<eos> Something Lacey said.<eos> The point is, maybe Billy couldn't stand to see all that money going to frogs and trees.<eos> Might have led to a fight.<eos> Which means that this could be about money after all.<eos> Either way, I need you two to help me link one of them to this crime.<eos> Oh, so much happened to Nikki's body before we got it.
What happened to that big golden key you used to have?<eos> Didn't think it was secure enough.<eos> ROBOT:<eos> Good afternoon, Superman.<eos> May we be of assistance?<eos> Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight.<eos> That key can't be safe.<eos> Why don't you give it a try?<eos> [LOIS GROANS]<eos> I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.
Good afternoon, Superman.<eos> May we be of assistance?<eos> Please bring Miss Lane's car inside and repair any damage from the flight.<eos> That key can't be safe.<eos> Why don't you give it a try?<eos> [LOIS GROANS]<eos> I carved it out of a piece of dwarf star material.<eos> It weighs half a million tons.<eos> LOIS:<eos> So you're the only one who can lift it.
Yard got pretty messed up by the riot.<eos> I'll work on the sprinklers later.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> Look who's drinking out of the bottle.<eos> See what you've done to me?<eos> The next thing you know I'll be flossing only once a day.<eos> Hey, you started unpacking my stuff?<eos> Yes, your books are on the shelves.<eos> Sports trophies are in the den.<eos> And on a sad note, your bean bag chair accidentally ripped when I stuck a knife in it and stuffed it in the trash.
Hey!<eos> Easy over the threshold!<eos> You're not transporting meat.<eos> Okay, grandma, enjoy your visit.<eos> She's going back in a cab.<eos> Mom!<eos> Hi!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> What happened to your foot?<eos> Oh, I-I broke it a month ago.
- Here.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I said "No mayo," Like, 15 times.<eos> I'll trade with you.<eos> Do you want my salad?<eos> Uh, let me check.<eos> Nope, still got a penis.<eos> I want my hamburger the way I ordered it.
This wasn't a gift for Bob and Lee, was it?<eos> Why'd you lie to me?<eos> Because I knew you wouldn't understand.<eos> You spent $800 on a doll for yourself.<eos> Y-you're right.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Like this is any crazier than your collections.<eos> A steroid freak hits a baseball over a fence, and you paid thousands of dollars for it.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't carry it around with me - or take it to tea.
You didn't even look at your cards!<eos> I don't need to.<eos> So what do you say, Van De Kamp?<eos> Did you come to play?<eos> Let's see what you are made of.<eos> Three kings.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I should buy a lottery ticket right now.<eos> Yes, you should.<eos> And then you should "eat it."
Don't ask me to do this.<eos> Please, Karen! Paul got away with Martha's murder, but he won't get away with mine.<eos> Toby.<eos> Here, kitty, kitty.<eos> Ikebana is all about bringing together nature and humanity.<eos> The three main branches, or shushi, represent chi, earth, ten, heaven, and jin, man.<eos> Interesting.<eos> Nothing to represent "woman."<eos> How about this insignificant clump of moss?<eos> We could stuff it down at the bottom, where it will only speak when spoken to.
You look surprised.<eos> I am.<eos> After the way I talked to you, I was kind of expecting the firing squad.<eos> I thought about it, but I decided to go for the romantic dinner.<eos> Figured less cleanup.<eos> Honey, I understand how you feel about Paul.<eos> I know you're just trying to protect me.<eos> And you're just being you.<eos> The woman that makes me pull over to the side of the road in a rainstorm to pick up a sick raccoon.<eos> In my defense, I did think it was a cat.
You sure you're okay watching the girls all weekend?<eos> Hey, you can't miss your old modeling friend's funeral.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We were really close.<eos> Well, you get to see some old friends, maybe even reconnect with a few.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Look, I know it's been hard for you to not see Bree, but it has meant a lot to me.<eos> Nice coat.<eos> Is it new?<eos> Yeah, I just bought it this week.
What?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Girls. No running!<eos> Is that all you're going to do?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Next time I'll trip one of them.<eos> Or perhaps you could try taking a firmer hand.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> I've tried everything.<eos> I even bought them a puppy just so I could threaten to kill it.
"I'm out of order?<eos> No, you're out of order!<eos> Get out!"<eos> So, you really like this?<eos> I love it.<eos> You know, I was a little worried about how this was going to work out, but you came through. I mean, you captured it.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> I'll tell you what's amazing...<eos> The rug that we haven't put down yet.<eos> Let's get to that showroom, Lynette, before some other hotshot takes it.
You changed the diamond.<eos> I told you I'd give you a decent ring someday.<eos> There it is.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> I appreciate this.<eos> I really do.<eos> But...<eos> I loved the ring the way it was.<eos> Really?<eos> 'cause I seem to remember you making a joke about it every single time you showed it to somebody.
You look really pretty.<eos> Aw.<eos> Thanks, sweetie.<eos> Is your dad dressed?<eos> He's not back yet.<eos> - From where?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> He left while you were in the shower.<eos> Hey, Penny, there was a suitcase there.<eos> Have you seen it?
Brown.<eos> You look really pretty.<eos> Thanks, sweetie.<eos> Is your dad dressed?<eos> He's not back yet.<eos> From where?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He left while you were in the shower.<eos> Hey, Penny, there was a suitcase there.<eos> Have you seen it?
Quick! Button your shirt.<eos> I don't have any buttons.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're the one who ripped them off.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> What the hell would've happened?<eos> BREE: Hello, everyone!<eos> I'm embarrassed to admit it, but...<eos> My oven malfunctioned.<eos> It's been very erratic lately and I thought I'd fixed it, but Chuck and I went to the cellar to choose a wine, and when we were done, my entrée was smoking.
Zamiri It was a princess.<eos> She rode bare face.<eos> It is not for sale,<eos> Auda, son of Zamira who was the slave of Amar.<eos> You make a mistake.<eos> It is you who have committed a leaving your library<eos> Auda with soft hands.<eos> You do not make the weight.<eos> Nesib traveled from one horizon to another. He sprinkled gold all the tribes.<eos> We are all in competition To be the first to cut off your head and bring it to Ibn Idris which, they say, promise to your wife.
Our... really... close... friend.<eos> I'll walk you to your car.<eos> You poor thing.<eos> This is so hard.<eos> It's just so hard.<eos> You're very brave.<eos> Here now.<eos> Oh, honey, he was a magician.<eos> He made all of us just look beautiful.<eos> I mean, he could make your wrinkles all just go away, and he would, if, if you had a overbite, he'd fix it so it wouldn't be so sticky outie.
And he had 12 disciples and I don't think any of them ever married.<eos> And the apostle Paul, he was a lifelong bachelor.<eos> And you never heard anybody in the New Testament say that they was a bunch of queers.<eos> No.<eos> No, he had homosexual relations.<eos> I know that for a fact.<eos> This ain't San Francisco, so around here we got a lot of "closet homosexuals."<eos> And I know of at least two men that he had relationships with that were heterosexual.<eos> Were.<eos> Now one of the main things and why I have this job, and why I feel like I'm good at it is, you see, I'm naturally suspicious.
I'll be there.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Can you clean this up?<eos> I have to go right away.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How's it going, Carl?<eos> Old Mrs. Nugent just fired me.<eos> What happened?<eos> She said I stole a lawn mower.<eos> Snuck it out to my place in Niggertown.

He didn't do it.<eos> Bernhardt Tiede ain't no monster.<eos> Ain't no jury gonna convict Bernie of first degree murder.<eos> In fact, I don't know if a jury's gonna convict him of anything and I'll say this, if a jury as to convict him, they'll probably gonna give him probation.<eos> I n the meantime, Bernie sits in the county jail where he's reportedly already become a popular inmate leading a Bible study group and cooking meals for the staff.<eos> Now, we are going to line the bottom of the pie dish with cheese to provide a barrier between the liquid and the crust.<eos> Now a lot of people use grated cheese, but I found that if you cut it in little quarter inch cubes, it does a better job of keeping the crust from getting soggy.<eos> Now, we are going to sauté the broccoli lightly in olive oil till it's just bright green.<eos> That keeps the flavor in.<eos> If you put it in raw, it's completely flavorless.
"So the final explosion:<eos> "meltdown will come with fair warning<eos> "but no possible means of escape.<eos> There will be no survivors."<eos> "The world will end."<eos> - A little, tiny clock is popping up in the back of your head.<eos> Why?<eos> 'Cause you have a seed in your mind for that, right?<eos> How did that seed get there?<eos> Who put it there?
You're dead.<eos> Nothing ever really dies, my son.<eos> I have a secret to tell you.<eos> Then tell me.<eos> Everything you have done, everything you have learned, has led you here.<eos> Whatever you are, my mother is...<eos> -Is dead.<eos> -And you blame yourself.<eos> Your Jedi training has served you well, Ani, but you are more than a Jedi.<eos> Tell me, where is your pain, so I might take it away?
OBI-WAN:<eos> This passage will get us near the landing pad.<eos> Artoo, send the shuttle to the rear landing platform.<eos> (R2-D2 BEEPING)<eos> We've already been given the go-ahead by General Skywalker, sir.<eos> Assuming you are still on schedule.<eos> The trick will be if Anakin arrives on time.<eos> A probe!<eos> (WHOOSHING)<eos> Did you get it?
Good eye, Belle.<eos> I think I've got...<eos> Yeah. I've got everything I need down here to fix that.<eos> Oh.<eos> That's a good start.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm gonna need you to get Brian.<eos> Tell him to go to the wood shed and I want him to get a log.<eos> Tell him to cut it to six feet.
Christopher Harlowe is charged with stealing this...<eos> the Mandalay Ruby.<eos> It's a 237-carat pigeon blood.<eos> Pigeon blood?<eos> It's a local description of the deep-red color of the most prized Burmese gems.<eos> No pigeons were harmed in the mining of this ruby.<eos> I'll take mine medium rare.<eos> That's good to know.<eos> In the last year, it was held in a secured vault at a state mining facility, under army guard, in the middle of a jungle.<eos> Not exactly a prime location for a college kid to just walk in and grab it.
I know.<eos> You're barking up the wrong tree in so many ways.<eos> Hey, it's a party.<eos> The word is out.<eos> As to whether or not the guy you're looking for will show up is...<eos> Gorgeous.<eos> The ruby or the model?<eos> Both.<eos> Is the stone yours?<eos> Discovered it last month at a castle in the Scottish highlands...
Look, I know I...<eos> I know.<eos> What do you need me for?<eos> You're not here to stop me?<eos> Savor this moment.<eos> Already savoring.<eos> Look, I'll spare you the details, but basically, the smoking jacket's not smoking.<eos> We need to stall.<eos> ...To anyone else, do not open this pouch.<eos> Guard it with your life, because it has everything that we need.
Hey, June.<eos> I knew you wouldn't mind.<eos> I was looking for this.<eos> Photo album?<eos> Ford asked if he could see it.<eos> You two go way back.<eos> Back then, the three of us were inseparable.<eos> Lenox Lounge. Yes.<eos> Byron looked so handsome in that suit.<eos> Even Ford asked if I still have it.
June's mentioned it before.<eos> What'd she say?<eos> Byron used to run the back room.<eos> When?<eos> About 25 years ago.<eos> That building's still there, isn't it?<eos> You said this place was clean!<eos> It is. Then why are there police outside?<eos> Give me the case.<eos> I said give it to me!
Shut your eyes.<eos> Your arm's broken.<eos> Your arm's broken. You've just got home.<eos> Picture it.<eos> Recall it.<eos> Minute by minute.<eos> Every image.<eos> Every emotion.<eos> The pain in your arm.<eos> Feel it.
Selfishly, sir, because I don't want to have to be there if you decide to go back to it.<eos> To what?<eos> To whatever it is that's troubling you.<eos> You think I'm a bad cop.<eos> Honestly?<eos> I think you're a good one.<eos> Yeah, how do you know?<eos> How could I not?<eos> It comes with the card and you've still got one.<eos> -Where are you taking it?
Ah. Um, well. That's very good of you to bring it in.<eos> It's the way I was raised.<eos> Is he in his room, do you know?<eos> I don't believe he is, we have his key but I'll make sure he gets it when he checks in.<eos> Don't worry, sir.<eos> I was raised the same. -Not many left.<eos> -With every passing day.<eos> I'm so sorry, did you take my pen?<eos> -I don't believe so, sir.<eos> -I'm sure I had it just now.
That was quite an achievement.<eos> Why didn't you have him killed in jail?<eos> This is our thing, not theirs.<eos> -So, you got him out?<eos> -I got him out.<eos> Just to have him killed? Oh, no.<eos> I did it myself.<eos> But you could've just let him live.<eos> I mean, once he was out, he could never say how you did it, because if he had, he'd have been straight back in.<eos> It wasn't the pardon that worried me, it was what he threatened to expose if I didn't get it for him.
I mean, once he was out, he could never say how you did it, because if he had, he'd have been straight back in.<eos> It wasn't the pardon that worried me, it was what he threatened to expose if I didn't get it for him.<eos> Our thing...<eos> Our thing.<eos> Counterpoint.<eos> Because if that got out, then there'd be real trouble.<eos> Like you've never seen.<eos> You shouldn't have told him, Peter.<eos> You shouldn't have let him go down.<eos> I'd offered him retirement, he wouldn't take it.
And this one, this is our code.<eos> From last June, when they sent it over to us.<eos> Why did they send it?<eos> -Because of this.<eos> -What's that?<eos> That's the first code, our code.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> It means this brick has been here before.<eos> Which means...<eos> Someone took it out.
About?<eos> Everything.<eos> This ship, your role in it.<eos> Nick's little discovery.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm okay.<eos> Maybe we should rest for a minute.<eos> I can hardly breathe.<eos> It's the dust.<eos> It's in your lungs already.
I got one.<eos> What happened?<eos> Did they understand it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Colonel Young, this is Rush in the communications lab.<eos> There's something you need to see.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> I got it.<eos> Now, the trigger wire is threaded.<eos> Find it, but don't pull.
Agnes, wake up.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Drink it all up.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Don't go back to sleep.<eos> Is it time?<eos> 'Do exactly as I say, Agnes.<eos> 'I'll be watching you.<eos> Don't worry. 'The right destination will reveal itself to you.<eos> 'The place you choose will be the right place because you chose it.'
You, me and Sophie.<eos> To the photographer's studio.<eos> A family portrait.<eos> Good day, Sir.<eos> Mr Tovey.<eos> Madam.<eos> This way.<eos> Sophie.<eos> This dress must have shrunk.<eos> I shall now summon an elephant from the sky and balance it on the tip of my nose.
I just wanted to take a nap.<eos> If you want forgiveness it will cost you a quarterback.<eos> I have no money.<eos> Want to fry in hell?<eos> Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> I still have a nickel<eos> Show me!<eos> Good.<eos> Lay it down on the floor!
Sid!<eos> What are you doing in the tree?<eos> It's pudding.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> From Tom<eos> Tom gives his dessert?<eos> - If I paint the fence.<eos> Tom!<eos> Shouldn't you paint the fence?<eos> - Sid absolutely wanted to paint it.
They would say, "Can we stop this virus?"<eos> As if it was a negative progression.<eos> But it's growing.<eos> More and more, with a momentum that is unstoppable.<eos> Now some kid snorts the entire load of his mother's spice cupboard.<eos> Post that on YouTube.<eos> They would watch as it becomes the buzz word amongst high school students everywhere.<eos> Eventually, the cynicism is turning into awe.<eos> Do you know what's going on with my computer?<eos> They took it.
We crush him, he may need to get really intoxicated, and then he will not be okay.<eos> Okay, so we wait one week, and then we tell him it sucks.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> - Yes.<eos> We're not gonna tell him, I am.<eos> And what's a week gonna do?<eos> We waited a week to tell you Sloan sent your engagement ring back.<eos> What?<eos> I've been carrying this around, waiting for the right moment to tell you.<eos> - She sent it in an envelope?
- Not even a padded one.<eos> Imagine if we told you that last week.<eos> I understand she wants my shit out of her space, but this ring cost me 30 fucking grand.<eos> - Still hurts.<eos> - Still hurts.<eos> We wait two weeks, and then we tell him it's a piece of...<eos> Couldn't carry five.<eos> What's that?<eos> Sloan's engagement ring.<eos> She sent it over in an envelope.
But Foreman called me.<eos> I didn't know that you thought that little boy had a bleed in his head.<eos> I will kill my brother if he messes with you anymore.<eos> What do you care?<eos> Chris. You were a crappy husband. But you are a good person.<eos> Once again. You are unfired.<eos> Why?<eos> You sold me out even though you knew that you're gonna get thrown out of med school.<eos> That's just kind of impressive.<eos> I keep my job if I stand up to you, I keep it if I don't.
Crime scene cleanup.<eos> Septic tank repair.<eos> Mold removal.<eos> It's physically killing me.<eos> It's the holy grail of potential diseases... caustic cleaning chemicals, raw sewage, mold spores, fungal infections.<eos> And not to mention cleaning up blood and other bodily fluids from a homicide yesterday.<eos> We should check out the crime scene.<eos> He might have picked up a bacterial infection from the victim's blood.<eos> Place has been cleaned and sanitized by our patient.<eos> We sent for the autopsy report... probably take a week to get it.
It's silly that I haven't done it before now.<eos> But you're doing it now because you think you're sick. The freaking out can at least wait until after the biopsy this afternoon.<eos> The biopsy's not till tomorrow.<eos> It's the first opening in the schedule.<eos> For the Dean of Medicine, the first opening in the schedule is...<eos> Oh, look. Now! My worry isn't any more important than anyone else's.<eos> Actually, it is.<eos> Good point.<eos> I want my stuff, asshat.<eos> I told you, man, I don't have it here.
If I'd known how this would all fall out, I might have done things different.<eos> No.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> For God's sake.<eos> Shit.<eos> - Morning, y'all.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> What was her maiden name, Ansel?<eos> I need it for the file.
I performed a service for this family.<eos> And I deserve my payment in full.<eos> Because of a misunderstanding with the insurance, I won't receive any cash for my services.<eos> That is unfair.<eos> I don't care to hear excuses or placement of the blame.<eos> I hold you all equally responsible.<eos> Reach around and grab my ass.<eos> Reach around and grab my ass.<eos> There you go.<eos> Grab it!
Wait.<eos> What's your names?<eos> Talon.<eos> Dan. Den.<eos> I'm...<eos> Ricky.<eos> You did good bringing her to me.<eos> With a little snoozze she'll be A-okay.<eos> Shouldn't we bring her to the hospital?<eos> ♫ You got a pee pee Stick it in my poo poo ♫
No. You did this to yourself.<eos> I'm not some fucking cowboy running around shooting At anything that moves.<eos> I've done my homework. And I'm going to finish what you couldn't.<eos> Get out.<eos> Well, I'm sorry.<eos> Take me to the airport, John.<eos> What? Take me to the airport, John.<eos> Ahab, she's just upset. Give her some time.<eos> I spent years living in that forest, John. Come the spring thaw I'd tap those maple trees. And I collected that sap.<eos> And I boiled it down. And I watched those sugars caramelize.
Never mind your meds, you cunt!<eos> If you kick that again, you're going to need a fucking doctor.<eos> Sorry, guv! Hello, sir, I'm working on here with you today.<eos> How you doing, son?<eos> -Eddie.<eos> -Mr Norwood.<eos> Right. Forget the training school bollocks. We'd get fuck all done.<eos> If the cons know your first name, they're not going to hunt you down and kill you.<eos> All right?<eos> So they can know it. Just don't let them use it. Right.
- Thank you for the food.<eos> - Thank you for the food.<eos> We have no luck today.<eos> I had hoped that we would catch a carp.<eos> The books say that carps are good for weak people.<eos> And especially for weak girls.<eos> Hand it over!<eos> Grab the net!<eos> Quick!<eos> We can fry the carp and give it to Miho-dono!
Help me move this cabinet. Come on.<eos> Get over here.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, snap!<eos> Whoa, where does it lead?<eos> It leads to freedom, and $700 worth of pizza.<eos> Get in there.<eos> You make great cake.<eos> I never told you that, but I love...<eos> I bought it.
I'm so sorry.<eos> Debs, will you watch him for a second? VERONICA:<eos> Come with us.<eos> Casey, we're gonna play a couple games, okay?<eos> I'm not sure what's going on with her.<eos> Oh, maybe it's 'cause your mom bailed and Frank's a big drunk.<eos> Oh, what, I'm asshole now?<eos> She's the one who stole a baby.<eos> All right, look, she obviously planned it.<eos> I mean, she took a stroller out of the garbage and she fixed it.
Shut up!<eos> Stop being so, Walid!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> What's up?<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> You think that everything is ok?<eos> We all have problems.<eos> Everything is wrong.<eos> Stop it, or they'll cut down the olive tree.<eos> My wife inherited it from her father.
- What do you mean?<eos> - We do role playing, psychodrama.<eos> It's part of the treatment.<eos> The other residents play people in my life, like my sister or you.<eos> So a dopehead plays me?<eos> "A dopehead." So how's it done?<eos> Well, you have to improvise.<eos> They stand in a circle, try to tempt me with stuff.<eos> "Anders, remember how the dope makes you feel warm inside."<eos> "You can just smoke it, no need to shoot up."
The saddest girl I've ever met.<eos> It wasn't her first suicide attempt.<eos> I'm not even capable of having a child.<eos> Good evening.<eos> The mechanic called to say your car was fixed.<eos> But he insisted it was a near miracle.<eos> What about the boiler?<eos> Still broken, but someone came to drain the radiators.<eos> How about that hot toddy?<eos> I'll bring it up to you?
Hey, dad, try some?<eos> How does she do that?<eos> How do you do that?<eos> It's great, Hon. Thanks.<eos> Terry, you needed a hand with that generator?<eos> You got it.<eos> This goes in here?<eos> Yeah, that's good.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I smell asparagus, which means you're boiling it, which means you're ruining it.
But what I was in love with was the potential that she was holding that was me.<eos> - Right. - Does that make sense?<eos> - Right.<eos> - That's what I was in love with.<eos> You shouldn't do that.<eos> - And, like... and she wouldn't give it back.<eos> So, like, as the... as the...<eos> as, like, the years went on and everything went on, I was just, like... this is gonna sound so fucking melodramatic.<eos> I was, like, this fucking, like, little fucking bird, Like, in a cage.<eos> And finally she came over and unlocked it, and I just sat there.
You sure?<eos> You wanna go play?<eos> Come on, Ben. Number four: Because somehow, some way, someday, things have to change.<eos> Richard, I...<eos> I know things have to be different.<eos> I know if I didn't have this job, things would be better in so many ways.<eos> But... me without that job isn't me.<eos> And me without you and Ben and Emily is... it's nothing.<eos> So... I went in to see Clark today.<eos> Look, I've given everything I have to this job. And I love it.
My oldest boy. Yeah.<eos> Here to pick up Karen.<eos> What's with the vest?<eos> Sheils made it.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi, Lip. Hi.<eos> Does my head look bigger?<eos> I don't think it can get any bigger, Dad.<eos> I have to keep an eye on it.
Come on, when Preacher said what he said, he was baiting me.<eos> He knows his wife, he knows what she's capable of.<eos> He doesn't know me.<eos> OK. You're forgiven.<eos> - Forgiven? I didn't do anything!<eos> - Forgiven just in case you did.<eos> I think I can live with that.<eos> Honey, I don't like the looks of that.<eos> Yeah, that top one seems loose, doesn't it?<eos> Yeah, speed up and go around it.
I got a call from someone with the U.S. marshals.<eos> They want me to come in to talk.<eos> Well, we expected that, right?<eos> Just tell them you visited me in prison and that's it.<eos> Do you have everything, baby?<eos> I just, I just don't understand why you need all this when you could just stay with me.<eos> Well, I am going to stay with you, baby, for the rest of my life.<eos> First, I need to take care of a few things.<eos> I'm gonna need the car back tomorrow.<eos> Well, I'm gonna need it longer than that.
- Yeah.<eos> Baby, let's just go downstairs.<eos> Ray, can you...?<eos> Please.<eos> Nice to meet you, Mrs. Duchamp.<eos> - Marisol, now's just not a good time.<eos> - I know.<eos> That's why I called our travel agent, I pushed our flight five days.<eos> We get back on the 31st.<eos> And we can move it again without a penalty if we have to.
And if they are?<eos> It will do something.<eos> Its something may not be enough for us.<eos> French arms may alter the whole equation!<eos> Has the College of Cardinals heard?<eos> No, but they will.<eos> And we can imagine the discord already, everyone dividing into factions.<eos> We are facing a battle for our very survival.<eos> I'm scared of thunder, Paolo.<eos> It often comes before summer showers. No!
Stay down!<eos> It's about time.<eos> If they would've done that earlier would've saved you the trouble.<eos> They wouldn't have destroyed the house if they didn't have to.<eos> Alright, what the fuck are we gonna do?<eos> - We're not gonna stay here and burn.<eos> - We got seven, coming up the front.<eos> - How many shots in that rifle?<eos> - Just one.<eos> - Use it. - No.

Where you have often mentioned Tullius frequents upon a certain hour, overseeing his concerns.<eos> A chance encounter, to gauge reaction?<eos> Certain to be favorable.<eos> As I know your reply to my request will be.<eos> Give it voice, and see it considered.<eos> I would have Gaia remain with us.<eos> Just for a few days, until she can manage other arrangements.<eos> The request does not surprise.<eos> Is that a yes?<eos> Ask for the moon, and I would wrest it from the heavens.
You should have fucking let him.<eos> Tullius has grown to be a man of worth.<eos> One to be emulated and admired.<eos> And who will you choose to impress him?<eos> Vettius' foolishness presents rare opportunity.<eos> The question begs careful consideration...<eos> I have news to lift the heart.<eos> Vettius has made challenge.<eos> The coward finds his cock.<eos> And I would see it shriveled.
-...may not be joined in matrimony...<eos> -...may not be joined in matrimony to Anna Maria Gardner.<eos> ...to Anna Maria Gardner.<eos> They now wish to affirm publicly their relationship and to offer each other the security that comes from vows sincerely made.<eos> Jacob, place the ring on Anna's finger.<eos> - I give you this ring...<eos> - I give you this ring as a token of my love and affection.<eos> As a token of my love and affection.<eos> And, remembering this day, never allow anything to destroy the feeling that we share for each other.<eos> Wear it with a feeling of love and joy...
Uner the train, just above the wheels.<eos> - Okay, can you cut it? - I'm not that crazy.<eos> Okay, get him to the engine room.<eos> I got this.<eos> An I want you to take-- you've got staying power, Cape, like a wee...<eos> Hol it.<eos> My Go, they're multiplying. Easy.<eos> Everyboy take it easy.<eos> This train's a runaway.<eos> We nee all hans on eck to stop it.
What I have done such a terrible thing?<eos> Please, tell me!<eos> You did not do anything.<eos> It is to me.<eos> Try to understand it.<eos> I'm trying, But you say nothing at all!<eos> Cut the crap and look at me!<eos> [What?<eos> - You wear your wedding ring not.<eos> - I know I've forgotten it at Danielle.
Oh, yeah, she certainly does.<eos> Gupta!<eos> Aah!<eos> Next time, it'll be a real brick.<eos> I'm sorry, rajiv.<eos> It's my chair.<eos> I need a new one.<eos> That chair is more valuable to this company Than you are.<eos> It's dependable.<eos> It never leaves early.
He's gonna be my next champion.<eos> - Mark my words.<eos> - Fight fixing.<eos> What can you tell us? No.<eos> That doesn't happen.<eos> The board finds out, everyone involved is done, forever.<eos> And you need a fighter willing to take a dive, which Merriman isn't. - No?<eos> - Egotistical jerk like him?<eos> Come on.<eos> Stick the jab and shoot it.
I know all about your procedures.<eos> I just wanna talk to him, surgeon to surgeon.<eos> I used to be one, if you remember.<eos> Of course, I'm sorry.<eos> That must have been horrible for you.<eos> The car accident and then losing a patient.<eos> If I didn't reach out to you, it was because I was dealing with a loss of my own. My son, Nick.<eos> He OD'd his freshman year at a frat party.<eos> The bonsai was his.<eos> For four years, I have kept it alive through plant lice and root rot.
I'm already the envy of all my frat buddies.<eos> They won't leave me alone.<eos> - When did you graduate?<eos> Have you ever heard of a boy named Nick Baldwin?<eos> Congratulations.<eos> A colleague of mine just told me something that I never knew before.<eos> There is no such thing as a bonsai tree seed.<eos> Instead, you take the seed of a healthy tree and infect it with a fungus that genetically alters it's root system.<eos> It's called Apiosporina collinsii.<eos> We found it on the staple gun, Gwen.
Agent Sawicki is of Polish stock.<eos> He joins us from Mount Olivet.<eos> Outside Pittsburgh.<eos> Yes, they have a large Christian community.<eos> Mrs. Van Alden is visiting for the weekend,<eos> Well, there's no shortage of wholesome entertainment.<eos> I picked up this tourist guide yesterday.<eos> - Does it list the churches?<eos> - I assume so.<eos> I haven't read it yet.

You know what we do best? We fight.<eos> Each other, the world, whatever.<eos> As a team, we're pretty unbeatable.<eos> And that is what is needed right now:<eos> you and I, being Team Badass.<eos> We'll deal with our personal shit after--<eos> Right now, you're gonna put on your big-wolf pants and you're gonna come with me and kick some tail, or I'm gonna start kicking your tail.<eos> Yes, Ma'am.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, what do we do with this heart stone once we find it?

And... I can't be with him till the very end.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because this is it.<eos> This is the day he finds out who I am.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> You appear to be closing down, Dorium.<eos> What have you heard?<eos> That you pricked the side of a mighty beast, Madam Kovarian, and entirely failed to run.<eos> I admire your courage.<eos> I should like to admire it from afar.
It's a chemical chain reaction now.<eos> I can't stop it.<eos> This place is going to blow sky high.<eos> Exactly how long have we got?<eos> An hour? Five seconds?<eos> Er, somewhere in between.<eos> All right? Oh, Rory!<eos> Oh, Rory.<eos> There's a way out.<eos> Jennifer found it.
What is that?<eos> Check it out.<eos> My new thing.<eos> - It's pretty cool, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What...<eos> Basically, the oscillator on your fan allows me to see both in the living room and in the kitchen.<eos> Cool.<eos> Wait, what? You broke my fan?<eos> I can put it back together.
Please don't do this.<eos> Andy...<eos> I screwed up.<eos> I made a huge mistake, and I am so sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> I know 'cause I-I got all your flowers and your dinners and your spa packages.<eos> I can only imagine what else I was about to get.<eos> Why did you still want to get married?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> The ring is in the lock box, where I found it.
Why?<eos> Because the slightly brain-damaged person has no empathy.<eos> That's the key.<eos> If you don't have any empathy you do well as an investor and so Wall Street breeds people who have no empathy.<eos> To go in there and to make decisions and to make trades they have no compunction about no thought whatsoever as to how what they are doing might affect their fellow human being.<eos> So they breed these robots.<eos> These people who have no souls and since they don't even want to pay these people anymore- they are now breeding robots – real robots – real algorithmic traders.<eos> Goldman Sachs in the high frequency trading scandal:<eos> they put a computer next to the New York Stock Exchange.<eos> This computer, this "co-located" computer, as they call it:
Your ploy is cheap and unacceptable!<eos> You're trembling, Prade.<eos> It's bad for your heart.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The Court's president opposes my nomination!<eos> Wrong president.<eos> Do I have to remind you of the law?<eos> "On the proposal of the Prime Minister, "the President nominates..."<eos> I'll demand your head from the Party.<eos> I know people who'll bring it to me on a platter.
That's it.<eos> Lean towards me.<eos> Not so much.<eos> Bend your legs.<eos> Another 18 months, then I'll quit.<eos> It will be a different rhythm.<eos> Before, when I closed my eyes, it was always you who appeared.<eos> Then it was the children's turn.<eos> Now, I hear the wind and a shutter banging.<eos> I ought to get up to close it but I can't.
- OK.<eos> You know, her mom comes by everyday, passing out flyers, which I get, because you want to do everything you can, but let's face it, she's scattered in a dumpster, isn't she?<eos> I mean, aren't they always?<eos> Oh God!<eos> Unless you... you knew her.<eos> Anyway, we absolutely should do something for her, like, uh, have a vigil or start a group or a clothing drive or... o me.<eos> I just meant that if it were me, I would want closure.<eos> - It's OK.<eos> - I've had, like, a hundred cups of coffee today.<eos> I keep on making it for the cops, and then every time I make a pot, I think I should stay and have a cup with them, because I-I don't want them to think that I'm hiding anything, oh, which, I'm not.
Take the ninth step or I'm gonna shoot you, dad.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't touch you.<eos> Ray, you're my own flesh and blood.<eos> I never touched you.<eos> Don't you lie!<eos> I swear it.<eos> Take the ninth step.<eos> I ain't taking no step.<eos> Take it.
- Yes, thank you.<eos> Great. You're the man.<eos> Could you do it quick?<eos> I just... I have this dinner plan on Friday.<eos> Chuck, Sarah, what are you thinking for the big day?<eos> Be great if Clara could walk down the aisle as flower girl.<eos> You know, Woodcombs usually walk at six or seven months. Don't have to wait long.<eos> - What are your colors gonna be?<eos> - Oh, I'm better gray than blue.<eos> I still have my veil if you wanna borrow it.
It's for you.<eos> - Alex, it's me.<eos> - Where are you?<eos> I'm safe.<eos> I have the prince.<eos> - I'm guessing agents are looking for us.<eos> - Two.<eos> Here's what I need you to do.<eos> There's a trigger for a silent alarm in the security office. I saw it earlier.<eos> Trip it.
You don't know anything?<eos> I don't know nobody have beef with Mischa, at the party, anywhere else.<eos> Word on the street is, you did a two-year stint for Mischa, you're like an adopted son to his old man.<eos> What you got, some kind of Cain and Abel thing going on there?<eos> If Grushenko think I harm Mischa, I already be chopped to pieces.<eos> You see Mischa leave the party with anyone?<eos> No, and if I did, why I tell you and not Maximilian Grushenko?<eos> Because you'll be charged with hindering a prosecution.<eos> What happened to your finger there, tough guy?<eos> I slam it in a door.
New York is safer if Neal Caffrey is lacking in at least one skill set.<eos> Okay, what about self-preservation?<eos> No, you've done pretty well with the whole running-away thing.<eos> It suits you.<eos> Get a dog.<eos> Can I borrow Satchmo?<eos> No, you can't borrow Satchmo.<eos> Did you take my mug?<eos> I think everyone knows not to touch your mug.<eos> Elizabeth gave it to me.
I need my coffee.<eos> Boss, guess who just booked a flight to Samoa a week from Tuesday?<eos> Justin Springer, one-way ticket.<eos> Got you, Larssen.<eos> Your forgers did well.<eos> They did.<eos> Where is he now?<eos> Tracked him to an apartment in Queens.<eos> Search warrant?<eos> Judge is putting it through now.
Extracted from every carefully selected live-aboard.<eos> The finest genetic material mankind has to offer.<eos> Soon it will be ours.<eos> JOSHUA:<eos> The last group of live-aboards arrives tomorrow.<eos> Then we will collect all the remaining DNA we need from the humans.<eos> Now that I've decapitated the leadership of the Fifth Column our plans can finally continue without interruption.<eos> Is the connection secure?<eos> No, I thought I'd run the pow-wow through Facebook.<eos> It was one thing to get the job. It's another to do it.
You're right.<eos> I wouldn't have.<eos> So is this what we do now, Erica?<eos> We lie to each other?<eos> This is no time for conscientious objectors.<eos> We need to get this virus into a live-aboard now.<eos> And if we do, that person could die?<eos> The Erica I know wouldn't let that happen.<eos> When you were in the Army and a superior officer gave you an order, what did you do?<eos> - I followed it.
Not oppress us or enslave us, kill us!<eos> Listen, the Doctor's been part of my life for so long now and he's never let me down.<eos> Even when I thought he had when I was a... a kid and he left me, he came back.<eos> He saved me.<eos> And now he's going to save you.<eos> But don't tell him I said that because the smugness would be terrifying.<eos> Of course, if the Weeping Angels were meant for me, then your room is still out there, somewhere.<eos> Every time the Doctor gets pally with someone, I have this overwhelming urge to notify their next of kin.<eos> Sorry, last time I said something like that, you hit me with your shoe.<eos> I think you literally had to sit down and unlace it first.
Do whatever you have to. Cross your fingers. Say a prayer.<eos> But do not give in to the fear. Okay, but what are we actually going to do?<eos> We're going to catch ourselves a monster.<eos> Bring me death.<eos> Bring me glory!<eos> My master, my lord, I'm here.<eos> Come to me.<eos> I'm waiting, here, for you.<eos> He has promised me a glorious death.<eos> Give it to me now.
So, you must believe in some god or someone or they'd have shown you the door, too.<eos> So what do Time Lords pray to?<eos> According to the in-flight recorder, the programme developed glitches.<eos> Got stuck on the same setting.<eos> The fears from the people before us weren't tidied away.<eos> What's it saying?<eos> "An ancient creature, drenched in the blood<eos> "Drifting in space through an endless shifting maze.<eos> "For such a creature, "death would be a gift."<eos> Then, accept it.
I know I'm stupid to worry.<eos> - I can't wait to get home...<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Doctor?<eos> Love you, Alfie. Love you, Craig.<eos> You idiot!<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Morning.<eos> Teleport's still fused.<eos> They didn't repair it.
I've been round them as well.<eos> I can't remember everything.<eos> Doctor...<eos> It's like trying to remember the name of someone you met at a party when you were two.<eos> Doctor, the lift.<eos> And I can't just plump for 'Brian' like I normally do.<eos> Doctor, listen! Shh. What's that?<eos> It's the lift.<eos> It's the sound that the lift makes.<eos> George is scared stiff of it.
! What are you talking about?<eos> I never did anything to you!<eos> You really don't remember me, do you?<eos> Remember you?<eos> We went to high school together, Lois?<eos> Chemistry class?<eos> Freshman year?<eos> Joycie?<eos> You're Joyce Chevapravatdumrong?<eos> Yes, but they'd never let that name on TV, so I changed it to Kinney.

- Isn't that a little harsh?<eos> - Harsh?<eos> Robin, a single guy and a married woman cannot be friends... if one's in love with the other.<eos> Yeah, but Zoey is friends with us now too.<eos> It's not like Ted can just ghost out on her.<eos> She'll always be around.<eos> - Then what am I supposed to do?<eos> - Okay, just shut it down.<eos> Okay, just ignore your feelings.<eos> If she asks you for ketchup, tell her to get it her own damn self.
You must be Barney.<eos> I'm Cheryl.<eos> It's just so nice to finally meet you.<eos> I love that suit.<eos> Oh, thank you very much.<eos> And I love your coat.<eos> I love your coat.<eos> Oh, that's your coat, Barney.<eos> I just took it from you.<eos> Well, I do love it.
No, I'm just kidding.<eos> This is great.<eos> I really, I really missed this.<eos> Barney, what is going on?<eos> This is mine.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> J.J. gets a childhood, a dad, a real family and a basketball hoop?<eos> No, no.<eos> I at least get the hoop.<eos> I'm taking it with me.
Now turn it.<eos> Righty tighty, lefty loosey.<eos> I have no good excuse, Barney.<eos> It took me years before I was even able to look myself in the mirror for the way I let you down.<eos> It took courage to send me that letter.<eos> More courage than I've ever had.<eos> I owe you a lifetime of apologies, and I...<eos> I just have no idea where to begin.<eos> Can you help me with this?<eos> Here, got it.
I'm not kidding!<eos> Oh, by the way, Arthur, uh, how are things with you and your wife?<eos> Really good. In fact, I just put all my assets in her name.<eos> Smartest thing I've ever done.<eos> Damn it!<eos> No, you'd better make sure Mosby doesn't screw up tomorrow.<eos> Because either that building is going down, or you're going down.<eos> They're going to fire him?<eos> He loves that job.<eos> And he's been doing it for years.
"Yeah, yeah, the laser tag thing is awesome."<eos> So, third day of work?<eos> And the fertilizer is seeping into the ground water, causing...<eos> Is Scherpoopie pitching a story about manure?<eos> Genius.<eos> Okay, yes, I, uh, I fell into some manure.<eos> It's hilarious, fine.<eos> In a five-year career of on-air reports, there are bound to be a few embarrassing moments.<eos> A few?<eos> Uh, but in my case, it was just the one, and you found it, so, uh...
This may seem like an arbitrary line in the sand, but I'm going to say no to being a peeping tom.<eos> Oh, look who no longer wants to learn about commercial real estate.<eos> Sir, you wanted her out of your life. - Eh.<eos> - She's out.<eos> Let it go, shake it off, and move on.<eos> Is that what the guys in your bathroom said?<eos> - Oh, hey, babe.<eos> What is that, and, uh, what is he doing?<eos> He's installing our new tv.<eos> Bought it with my money.
He's installing our new tv.<eos> Bought it with my money.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Mm, but I did.<eos> Audrey, the tv is my thing.<eos> That would be like me buying a new one of these and not consulting you.<eos> It was time for a new tv, Jeff.<eos> The picture's fantastic!<eos> Come look.<eos> Did you at least get it on sale?
Hey, Adam, what's up? Nothing much.<eos> Just went to the market with Jen.<eos> Got some free groceries.<eos> Hey, look at that tv.<eos> Oh, nice, huh?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey, you know, Jen and I are looking to get a new tv.<eos> You mind if I ask you some questions about yours? - Sure.<eos> - Oh, great.<eos> Um, where did you get it?
There are multiple lives at stake now.<eos> That's exactly why they won't take action.<eos> CIA's not in the business of rescuing foreigners, remember?<eos> We're going to have to find another way.<eos> Today I witnessed the bravest thing I've ever seen in my life.<eos> I watched a man eat a scorpion.<eos> A live, poisonous scorpion.<eos> It was somewhat extraordinary.<eos> Less extraordinary than it appears.<eos> I recognized it as an Emperor scorpion.
My name is Dr Michael Aris.<eos> - I am married to Aung San...<eos> - Of course.<eos> I've been watching your wife's progress with admiration.<eos> I'm sorry to trouble you, but I believe you have some influence with the Nobel Peace Prize Committee.<eos> Would you be willing to forward her name?<eos> It is difficult to envisage a stronger contender.<eos> Anything that raises her international profile, will afford some measure of protection.<eos> The issue of Suu's safety weighs heavily on me at the moment.<eos> Look, if you have some kind of CV, I'll certainly ensure it's seen by Vaclav Havel and his committee.
Hey, I'm like you now.<eos> We've both been shot.<eos> Isn't that weird?<eos> Yeah, I think your mother would rather hear we got the same eyes.<eos> So let's keep that between us.<eos> Since you're in the club now, you get to wear the hat.<eos> Didn't you know?<eos> We'll pad the rim tomorrow so it sits better.<eos> Won't you miss it?<eos> Maybe you'll let me borrow it from time to time.

But my people, us, we are alive right now, right here, right in front of you.<eos> You send us out there, and that could change.<eos> I've given you safe harbour.<eos> My conscience is clear.<eos> This farm is special.<eos> You've been shielded from what's been going on out there.<eos> Dale said you saw everything happen on the news.<eos> Well, it's been a long time since the cameras stopped rolling.<eos> The first time I saw a walker, it was just half a body snapping at me from the ground.<eos> My inclination wasn't to kill it.
- Yeah...<eos> Tea, please.<eos> So, what's it like working in a hospital?<eos> It's OK.<eos> A little sad sometimes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's the saddest thing you've ever seen?<eos> Um... the parents who have children in here.<eos> They're the saddest.<eos> They order coffee, but then they just sit there and never even touch it.
Is it dated?<eos> Yeah, day before last. Great.<eos> How'd you get us in?<eos> Wasn't easy.<eos> It's like there's one case in this city, and every detective is on it.<eos> But it happens to be in Sunset Park, in Little Mexico, and I do speak Spanish.<eos> Good job, partner.<eos> You could march elephants past her, and she wouldn't look up from the TV.<eos> Hey, didn't you say the, uh, VIN numbers were rubbed off on the shooter car?<eos> Yeah. If I'm gonna steal a car and dump it, I probably wouldn't take the time to rub off the VIN numbers, right?
Understand, kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, numb nuts.<eos> Look, I'm just trying to help you find out who stole your stolen '02 Nissan.<eos> Same car that was used to shoot the police commissioner.<eos> You understand what I'm saying?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I'm pretty sure that car came from this chop shop, so maybe you shot the commissioner.<eos> The car was gone when I opened up yesterday.<eos> But I don't know who took it, I swear to you.
Or do we let your subconscious awareness...<eos> - There!<eos> - Good boy!<eos> Good boy!<eos> That's our Oscar!<eos> Gina!<eos> I'm not sure if that head will still be there.<eos> It ​​may have been eaten or something.<eos> We have dogs.<eos> Dogs that will eat it?
Good.<eos> Good. Here, here.<eos> Get yourself something nice.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Your Cayenne.<eos> Supposed to be black.<eos> Paint it.<eos> What?<eos> I need my end.<eos> You'll get it when I get it.

Who's ready to put down the booze with me for the next two weeks? !<eos> Fine.<eos> Hope you all get AIDS.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hi, girl.<eos> Here for your check? Yeah.<eos> Hi, Liam.<eos> Thanks, Gisela.<eos> Fiona...<eos> I can't find it.
I got a signed first edition of Harry Potter. Overrated.<eos> Made a better movie than a book.<eos> And now with all those kid actors grown up, they're scarier looking than the villains.<eos> Hey, can you help me on the computers?<eos> What do you want to do?<eos> Dig up some dirt.<eos> Name.<eos> Steve...<eos> W-W-Wilson? Wilton?<eos> You kind of need to know what the name is before you can look it up.
I-I-I don't know.<eos> I can't think when you yell, Frank. I'm not yelling.<eos> What'd you do with the key?<eos> You're still yelling.<eos> I need the key, Sheila.<eos> Okay, okay, it's by the...<eos> it's by the... it's by the washing machine.<eos> It's not by the washing machine.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> I put it by the washing machine.
Eduardo's so sweet.<eos> - He'd do anything for me.<eos> - Really?<eos> Listen, the thing is, I saw someone outside my apartment last night.<eos> And, in fact, I had a feeling that they'd been inside.<eos> Did they take anything?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> Okay. Perhaps you'd like to tell me about the, er, suicide note?<eos> - What about it?<eos> - Well, you mentioned it and I realised that, since he'd locked it inside his apartment, how did you know about it?
Well, I figured the note was fake.<eos> Thought if I kept quiet, I might find out more.<eos> But the note wasn't fake.<eos> I found it on the table in my apartment when he'd gone.<eos> I ran after him, but... I don't know, it was too late.<eos> I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to get dragged into his mess, so I took it straight round to his flat and left it on the hall floor.<eos> I couldn't see it would make any difference.<eos> Are you telling me the suicide note's genuine?<eos> Of course it's genuine.<eos> What? Do you... Do you think I forged it?
Fabri?<eos> Really?<eos> I bet you Romizi knows as well, that's why he's taking bets.<eos> Aurelio! And you can get your arse off that desk, and I don't care who your uncle is.<eos> I need a car.<eos> So?<eos> Phone call from the ministry.<eos> He's not happy. Thanks.<eos> We've been summoned by the ministry.<eos> Your pre-trial review of the Faso investigation, the minister wants to hear it for himself.
Previously on Being Human...<eos> My brother had a nervous breakdown and ran away from his family.<eos> Just leave me alone.<eos> You screw me.<eos> You kill me.<eos> You never call.<eos> I can't go to a restaurant and pretend to be human when all I wanna do is eat the table next to me.<eos> I will be strong for both of us.<eos> I lost my engagement ring.<eos> - Why'd you take it off?
I know you're frustrated. Frustrated?<eos> Ha!<eos> I'm dead.<eos> I think maybe that ring... is maybe what's making you so jittery.<eos> You should get rid of it.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's attached to me.<eos> It's basically a murder weapon, you know?<eos> It's the reason I died.<eos> So you've tried to get rid of it?

A rock like that can't back up anything.<eos> It's Sally's ring.<eos> Dammit!<eos> Hey, I thought we were watching a movie.<eos> I lost my engagement ring.<eos> It fell.<eos> - What?<eos> - It was right here.<eos> I was washing my hands and it just slipped down the drain.<eos> And I could see it.

- It was too crappy for you.<eos> - You know I love that ring!<eos> Then where the hell is it!<eos> I told you, it fell!<eos> What was the ring doing in the pipes?<eos> How am I supposed to know?<eos> Maybe the house was trying to tell you something.<eos> The house wanted you to have the ring.<eos> Look, Sally was always losing it, all right?<eos> She could never keep it on.
Yeah!<eos> Here's your chance.<eos> Hi, Mrs. Bergdoll.<eos> Got some bones for your pit bulls.<eos> I told you, no more comforters until Carl kicks the head lice.<eos> I need a man's suit, something dark.<eos> The box.<eos> They were never picked up.<eos> Any chance I can borrow this?<eos> I'll return it tomorrow, promise.

it's been a long time,jurek.<eos> i heard you have the key.<eos> the key?<eos> no volkoff didn't give it to me.i swear.
it's been a long time,jurek.<eos> i heard you have the key.<eos> the key?<eos> no volkoff didn't give it to me.i swear.<eos> he must've...chosen antonia.<eos> thank you you always were an honest man<eos> i know what you did to jurek.<eos> then you know i'm looking for the key.<eos> i don't have it.
Hey...<eos> Morgan,Morgan buddy,I got...<eos> I got to packfor the mission,but Sarah called me and saidyou were moving out. So I told her that was,of course,completely... ridiculous.<eos> MORGAN: No,she's right.<eos> I'm doing it.<eos> I'm gonna move out.<eos> No,but see,that'stotally ridiculous.<eos> That's what I'mtrying to say... Morgan,look,I'm-I'm-I'mso sorry about busting in on you and Alexon Valentine's Day with the bearskin rugand the... That's not the point.<eos> The pointis,you had the living room for 90 minutes.<eos> We had a deal,I broke it.
- No, we can't.<eos> Miles to go before we sleep.<eos> Scotch.<eos> - What are these?<eos> - Sobriety chips.<eos> Got two-month chips, six-month chips.<eos> They got a whole bowl of 10-year chips around here somewhere.<eos> People are throwing a lot of sober out the window tonight.<eos> Sorry I can't add to your collection, unless you want a button.<eos> Oh, you damage that coat, I'm jumping over this bar to protect it.
One day I took the brain from a dead zombie, a Greek.<eos> He had a restaurant nearby.<eos> - Very good food.<eos> - Amazing dolmere ... of olive leaves.<eos> That was how they made them.<eos> Now we diverged from the topic.<eos> I made brain substance on the fertilizers.<eos> - It was a green liquid.<eos> - The green sauce.<eos> We poured it over the seeds, and they grew like hell.
Are you joking? They're not stupid at all.<eos> You just need to practice.<eos> What matters is experience.<eos> You must know that.<eos> You need to experience things. You need to live to understand.<eos> You can't analyze. You have to live, seduce.<eos> Feel what you've experienced. Right.<eos> You're an expert.<eos> OK.<eos> Buy a bouquet and give it to her.
MICHAEL:<eos> Get away from her.<eos> ALEX:<eos> Nikita?<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> She won't hurt you.<eos> Where's the prototype?<eos> It's not on her.<eos> I came down here, risked my life for what?<eos> - Hand it over.

Not really sure yet.<eos> So why don't we all have a drink and, you know, we can talk about it?<eos> Well, this brings back old memories, doesn't it?<eos> How could you two be drinking at a time like this?<eos> This is old hat for us.<eos> We met during one of these.<eos> You met during a riot?<eos> Yeah, it was my first year of coaching.<eos> Oh, and I was a freshman cheerleader.<eos> My boyfriend was pinned under his mustang after the rioters flipped it.
C'mon!<eos> DOWN WITH LOVE<eos> A fish, Mr. Merlin!<eos> Catch it, Mr. Merlin.
C'mon!<eos> DOWN WITH LOVE<eos> A fish, Mr. Merlin!<eos> Catch it, Mr. Merlin.<eos> -It's a beauty.<eos> Shall we toss it back?
I didn't know we got new receptionist.<eos> I didn't know either.<eos> I'm a forensic technician and will work closely with you.<eos> -Will you have your lab here?<eos> -Exactly. Right now we are working on this case.<eos> You can help us identify her.<eos> It's Annika Svensson born March 1 1955.<eos> Living at 5 Växelmyntsgatan in Högsbo, Single.<eos> The report from Forensic Medicine just got here.<eos> I got it from the receptionist. And I hope she stays here.
- Can this wait till I'm home?<eos> - Chuck,<eos> Ellie wants your dad's laptop. She thinks he gave it to her for a reason.<eos> No.<eos> Devon, listen to me, and listen to me very carefully.<eos> She cannot have the laptop.<eos> The laptop is filled with all kinds of dangerous spy stuff, which is probably why it's buried deep beneath Langley right now.<eos> That's great, but she gave the computer to me.<eos> What am I supposed to tell her?<eos> I don't know. Tell her you lost it.

I will have you know, Eleanor, that our friend Jeffrey here is a clairvoyant.<eos> Read her thoughts, Jeffrey.<eos> She hates us.<eos> She thinks we're pathetic.<eos> She doesn't believe in ESP.<eos> That's really good.<eos> Can I have my computer? Fine.<eos> Where's your claim stub?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Devon dropped it off.
What? Don't pretend like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> We were a team, Casey.<eos> No, no, you and Bartowski were the team.<eos> I was just the backup.<eos> Doesn't matter anyway.<eos> I just want you to know, I think Bentley's giving you the short end of the stick.<eos> You and Bartowski... you're still good agents.<eos> Yeah, well, we used to be the best.<eos> I'm calling about the laptop.<eos> Did you find it? Well, there is a chance that we returned the laptop to the wrong person.
He disconnected.<eos> - Martin.<eos> - Saga Norén.<eos> - Is he closed down?<eos> - He disconnected.<eos> - Can you still trace him?<eos> Maybe, but he won't still be using his computer.<eos> - We might find the computer, but...<eos> - I heard her.<eos> He wanted us to find it.

He closed it down when we traced it. That defeats his object.
- Not to have a plan.<eos> - You can't only think about yourself.<eos> - You do.<eos> - You're going to help out more.<eos> - Yes, yes...<eos> - Help Mette out.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - Yes, I said!<eos> - Why is he called a truth terrorist?<eos> - A Swedish reporter used it.
- Until four o'clock?<eos> - I was out.<eos> - Were Yassir and the others there?<eos> Listen.<eos> Stay out late, and go wherever you want to.<eos> As long as there are no calls from the emergency room or the police.<eos> Do you get it?<eos> Do we have an agreement?<eos> There was a letter by the door.<eos> - Did you see who put it there?
The honor of your presence is requested.<eos> Get the girls settled in.<eos> I'll be back in time for supper.<eos> - And, Jory, you go with them. - Yes, my lord.<eos> If you'd like to change into something more appropriate...<eos> Thank the gods you're here, Stark.<eos> About time we had some stern northern leadership.<eos> Glad to see you're protecting the throne.<eos> Sturdy old thing.<eos> How many kings' arses have polished it, I wonder?
- It's too dangerous.<eos> - Just for a moment.<eos> Until we know who our enemies are.<eos> I know they did it, Ned.<eos> The Lannisters.<eos> In my bones, I know it.<eos> Littlefinger's right.<eos> I can't do anything without proof.<eos> And if you find the proof?<eos> Then I bring it to Robert... and hope he's still the man I once knew.
Lucky for you.<eos> Mine was some Tarly boy at the Battle of Summerhall.<eos> My horse took an arrow so I was on foot, slogging through the mud.<eos> He came running at me, this dumb high-born lad, thinking he could end the rebellion with a single swing of his sword.<eos> I knocked him down with the hammer.<eos> Gods, I was strong then.<eos> Caved in his breastplate.<eos> Probably shattered every rib he had.<eos> Stood over him, hammer in the air.<eos> Right before I brought it down he shouted, "Wait!
Gendry!<eos> Here he is.<eos> Strong for his age.<eos> He works hard.<eos> Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.<eos> - This is fine work.<eos> - It's not for sale.<eos> Boy, this is the King's Hand!<eos> - If his lordship wants the helmet...<eos> - I made it for me.
I will have no part in it.<eos> You're the King's Hand, Lord Stark.<eos> You'll do as I command or I'll find me a Hand who will.<eos> And good luck to him.<eos> - I thought you were a better man.<eos> - Out. Out, damn you.<eos> I'm done with you.<eos> Go, run back to Winterfell!<eos> I'll have your head on a spike!<eos> I'll put it there myself, you fool!
I'm so sorry.<eos> But don't you worry.<eos> We got this.<eos> The attendings, we are all gonna meet and we are gonna come up with a plan.<eos> I promise you.<eos> We're gonna make a plan and we're gonna figure out what to do.<eos> It's gonna be all right.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> She has got a hole in her heart.<eos> She needs bypass to fix it, and she needs it now.
Amen.<eos> I'll get her.<eos> I'll go.<eos> I'll go get her.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Arizona, we sat next to a charming young man on the plane today, and he said he was going with his partner to march in a parade.<eos> For pride?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Those are good. - Mm.<eos> The body knows when it's encountered something that doesn't belong.
Next wave?<eos> The Alzheimer's trial.<eos> The first wave of the trial is done.<eos> Now we're getting ready to treat the next group.<eos> Let me know when the O.R. is booked.<eos> Mer, what's going on?<eos> Does he know what you did?<eos> - What did I do?<eos> - I saw you with the clinical trial envelope.<eos> You were hiding it under your lab coat.
Call Baylor.<eos> At Namboze.<eos> I took the job at Namboze clinic.<eos> You what?<eos> My job?<eos> You took my job?<eos> Like you said, it's not personal.<eos> Sometimes, you have to be a shark.<eos> The job in Africa?<eos> The bitch stole it out from under me.
My daughter was in the crash.<eos> They said she had to have surgery.<eos> Are we supposed to...<eos> - You're Mrs. Gordon?<eos> - Yes. Sarah Gordon is my d...<eos> They're still operating.<eos> The doctors have been here every half-hour.<eos> - They'll be here any minute.<eos> - Say, would you like some coffee or...<eos> I'll get it.

Out of the way!<eos> Asking for a beating, aren't you?<eos> Bring them inside.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Please come inside.<eos> Surprised that I'm a woman?<eos> Gosh, you're stunning...<eos> Because of that before.<eos> I have a black dog.<eos> Won't eat unless I feed it.
Rather than blaming me, blame yourself for being late.<eos> Will you go without saying goodbye?<eos> I got clubbed and shot by an arrow because of him.<eos> What a relief to think I won't see him!<eos> Over there!<eos> It's too bad... two of you could have got along well.<eos> We met once, perhaps we'll meet again.<eos> 1 Year Later, China<eos> You stole a dog again?<eos> Steal it? They were going to eat it.
I didn't do anyth...<eos> Yes, you did. Because certain items in my desk...<eos> Bah, bah-bah-bah.<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> ...were not where I put them.<eos> Bah-bah-bah.<eos> And we need never to speak of that sickening invasion of privacy again.<eos> Yeah, and the neverer the better.<eos> But since I can only assume that Russian mind-control chip is rattling around in Len Trexler's bald head...<eos> Not rattling, Krieger stapled it.
Can a good thing come from a bad thing,<eos> Paolo the groom?<eos> Is this a good thing?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think.<eos> And what is the bad?<eos> I think you know...<eos> Paolo the groom.<eos> I have a second name.<eos> And I don't want to know it.
You are the one that would give us the crown of Naples?<eos> The Kingdom of France has long had claims on the investiture of the Kingdom of Naples.<eos> I would-<eos> I said, enough pleasantries, did I not?<eos> Just tell me, Cardinal, how you would place the crown of Naples... on this ugly head of mine?<eos> And it is exceedingly ugly, is it not?<eos> Your Highness bears all the vigour of the French race in his person.<eos> He is afraid to say it!<eos> Is my head not ugly, General?<eos> I can hardly bear to gaze at it.
- You were right to be mad. [ Sighs ] Sometimes I just feel like I have to scream... to let you know how upset I am.<eos> - But you get it now, right? - I... do-<eos> Not. No idea whatsoever.<eos> Oh, if I knew.<eos> But no.<eos> Good. So let's pretend the whole thing never happened.<eos> What were we even fighting about, huh?<eos> What the heck happened in here?<eos> The raccoon get through the dog door again?<eos> Yep. The raccoon got in, and your mom fought it off with the fire extinguisher.
Such a great number would need a precedent.<eos> Oh.<eos> Find one, then.<eos> Your Holiness.<eos> I have received advice from our most supreme expert in canon law, that a pope's election may be overturned if we can provide evidence of lechery, both notorious and public.<eos> That evidence I present to you now.<eos> Leave us, Micheletto.<eos> And now, my dear, tell us what you have witnessed.<eos> There is a passage, connecting the palace to the Vatican.<eos> His Holiness makes use of it... nightly.
But right now I can't even say that I ever really knew her.<eos> Can you?<eos> There's something down there.<eos> What do you got?<eos> It's called a Gimmel ring.<eos> The husband and wife-to-be wear individual bands during the engagement and at the wedding.<eos> You see the markings in the middle?<eos> Gaelic. Doyle gave it to her.<eos> This ring is more than just a souvenir.<eos> Otherwise, why hang on to it all this time?

- But what if they do?<eos> - I need you to get out of the flat, keep your head down for a while, OK?<eos> Sorry, Toby.<eos> Wotcha!<eos> Frank, what are you doing here?<eos> Waiting for you.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> What's in the boot, John?<eos> None of your business what's in my boot.<eos> Open it.
I want to cut his feet off, not butter him!<eos> Come on.<eos> Get him up.<eos> Get him on that slab.<eos> Ready?<eos> Two...<eos> I just need the key for the gate.<eos> Erm, have you got the key, Quinn?<eos> Erm...<eos> No. I think Woody has got it.

Silence!<eos> What happened next?<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> Confessing my crimes.<eos> Lord Tyrion, you are accused of hiring a man to slay my son Bran in his bed, and of conspiring to murder my sister's husband -<eos> Lord Jon Arryn, the Hand of the King.<eos> Oh, I'm very sorry.<eos> I don't know anything about all that.<eos> You've had your little joke.<eos> I trust you enjoyed it.
Rakharo.<eos> Put down that cask.<eos> - Is something wrong?<eos> - I have a thirst.<eos> Open it.<eos> The wine is for the khaleesi.<eos> It's not for the likes of you.<eos> Open it.<eos> Pour.<eos> It would be a crime to drink a wine this rich - without at least giving it time to breathe.
It's our...<eos> I didn't let him in. It's our party committee instructor.<eos> Don't you ever tell anyone the things we've been saying here, right?<eos> - Right. - You...<eos> You won't even try, son of a bitch!<eos> I'll quit the party if I do.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Well.<eos> The fourth reactor, god dammit, where is it?<eos> Show it to me.
Unlucky ones!<eos> Valik, what are you doing?<eos> - Valik, wait!<eos> - No, that's all. - I know where my passport is.<eos> - No passport.<eos> - Where can I go without it?<eos> - I've had enough of this crap.<eos> Valik, my passport is in the restaurant. We left it as a deposit for the guitar.<eos> Guys from the band gave theirs too.<eos> Let's go get it, it will be fast.
I have to go!<eos> A boy from Agartha?<eos> Hand over the clavis.<eos> Who are these people?<eos> Damn it!<eos> Don't hit them.<eos> We'll let them lead us to it.<eos> That jewel...<eos> This clavis?<eos> I came to the surface to get it back.
Shin!<eos> You're safe, too?<eos> Thank goodness. You're conscious...<eos> Ah, right...<eos> We were swept away...<eos> Wait, I'll get you water.<eos> You!<eos> You're from Arch Angel!<eos> I know you have a clavis.<eos> Leave it here and get out of Agartha!
After Tanzania, almost Europe-like, we are back in Africa.<eos> The amount of papers and customs stamps is unbelievable.<eos> Most of the Zambian officers shut their windows on us.<eos> Thanks to a big argument we manage to reduce the price and pay not in US dollars, but in the local Zambian Kwachas.<eos> Our extravagant Trabants were a big help. With just a third of necessary permits we enter the country semi-legally.<eos> The North of Zambia is covered in endless forests.<eos> It's a forest wilderness, with villages huddled in tiny clearings.<eos> We can't grow much, but we have to make a living.<eos> We make charcoal.<eos> We cut down a tree, chop it up. We bury the logs and set fire to them.
Why?<eos> Michael was... fighting with this one, and this one hit Michael in the head with a bat.<eos> And then... Michael wasn't moving anymore.<eos> A bat?<eos> Like a... a baseball bat?<eos> Where... where did this bat come from?<eos> It was Michael's.<eos> He kept it for protection.<eos> And this guy hit him with it. What did they do with the bat?<eos> Did they leave it, take it with them?

Ready?<eos> Ready!<eos> Come on, damn you!<eos> Yes!<eos> To the victor, the spoils.<eos> Did you plant that tree?<eos> Steady on.<eos> It must be 40 years old.<eos> It's not a flattering light.<eos> My father planted it.
Everyone else knows what a fool I made of myself.<eos> Why shouldn't he?<eos> I don't think you're a fool.<eos> Isn't that enough?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe it should be, but it isn't.<eos> Are you all right, Mr Lang?<eos> You're not, are you?<eos> I've seen shell shock before, you know.<eos> I had a brother with it.
- People would get scared.<eos> Public outcry, the program grinds to a halt.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's on the subtle side for me. But I like it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Maybe if I get my hands on more Blue Energy to study, I don't know.<eos> We'll get it for you.<eos> I'm sure Lisa can help.<eos> Jack, contact Fierro, see if he can get us into the Concordia site.<eos> We need to get into that reactor, destroy it before Anna drops 500 ships on our heads.
That's why you have to find out anything you can about it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I will.<eos> JOSHUA:<eos> I analyzed Amy's brainwave forms.<eos> When you Bliss the hybrid, her V brain accepts the Bliss at a frequency that isn't rejected by her human side.<eos> How is this possible?<eos> I checked our surveillance records.<eos> Ryan Nichols stole phosphorus from Anna's private supply.<eos> If he gave it to the mother, the child's abilities could have been heightened.
We must use this inconvenience as a demonstration of our benevolence.<eos> Hours after New York City was plunged into darkness utility companies are blaming the blackout on the failure of several high-voltage transmission lines in Upstate New York.<eos> Luckily, Anna and the Visitors wasted no time using their Blue Energy reactor at the Concordia site to turn power back on across the affected areas within minutes.<eos> After witnessing how quickly Blue Energy restored power world leaders are urging contractors to speed up construction on Concordia sites around the globe.<eos> Erica...<eos> That is exactly why we should have blown the site.<eos> The risks were too great.<eos> No, that is exactly it.<eos> We are not taking enough risks.<eos> We handed her another victory. We handed it to her.
So, sir, perhaps your mother could look after the wee baby Seamus?<eos> Woodhouse. Yes.<eos> - Nope.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Mother, come on, you...<eos> - You're off your nut if you think I'm babysitting this squalling little...<eos> What the hell is wrong with him?<eos> He might have a tiny hangover.<eos> Wha...? You ass, you gave him liquor?<eos> - No, I didn't give it to him, but...
- If there's a guardian I'll know what to look for.<eos> - Call me.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> I should go.<eos> - This is too dangerous.<eos> - For who?<eos> - I have a tracker implant, remember?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I have a signal jammer.<eos> Or we could just take it out completely.
- Give me blood.<eos> - You're gonna die for no reason.<eos> - No reason you'd understand.<eos> [BONES CRACK]<eos> [BELL TOLLS]<eos> [TAPS ON COMPUTER KEY]<eos> [DOOR OPENS]<eos> Owen, we can get you the regimen.<eos> OWEN:<eos> I don't need it.
I've offered to bring him to any place he wants.<eos> I wasn't going to tell you this, but he's coming on a visit this week, to see his old pals.<eos> Help me, Mrs Hughes.<eos> Let me come to Downton and show him the baby!<eos> Most certainly not. I won't allow that.<eos> Then ask him to meet me.<eos> I know he'd listen to you.<eos> I'll give you a letter.<eos> One more can't hurt.<eos> Make him read it in front of you.
Butlers will be two a penny now they're all back from the war.<eos> I gather Carson was looking for me.<eos> Shall I go and find him, m'lord?<eos> It's all right. Tell him I'll be in the dressing room.<eos> Has he done the red wine, yet?<eos> It's over here, m'lord.<eos> I'm pleased.<eos> It's a new one on me.<eos> I had some at a dinner in London and ordered it.<eos> Carson thought we might try it tonight.
That's just it. Thomas has come by some groceries and such and he's prepared to let them go for the right price.<eos> He's prepared to let them go, is he?<eos> And how did he come by them?<eos> That's what I'd like to know.<eos> Well, they're not stolen, in case you're worried.<eos> I'm not worried.<eos> You're the one who should be worried.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> I'm making a wedding cake now, for Mr Crawley.<eos> I'll finish it early and feed it with brandy.
No. They have to see him.<eos> They must see Charlie.<eos> Well, maybe they will...<eos> sometime in the future.<eos> I hope so.<eos> You'd better go now.<eos> This wedding cake... Can I make it?<eos> You wouldn't know how to start.<eos> But you can tell me.<eos> And if I make it early, then you can make another if it's no good.
I mean, Kelly made it.<eos> At least get to a car or something.<eos> I'll try. I'll try.<eos> You guys stay here. No, no, no. Wait.<eos> I'll come with you. Zee, hold this.<eos> But we'd have to carry Drake.<eos> And Dad, he...<eos> He can't run right now.<eos> I'll go get the car.<eos> I'll bring it right up to the front door. Then you and Felix and Zee carry Drake and Dad out.
Hey. I'm sure Crispian's fine.<eos> Crispian's a tough guy.<eos> No, he's not, but thanks.<eos> Thanks for the help, by the way.<eos> Hey, you... You seemed to have a handle on it.<eos> Yeah, don't worry about it.<eos> Hey, where's your dad?<eos> Where's the circuit box?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I think it's in the basement. Why don't you go look for it there?
Is it yours?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> This is not an ordinary ring.<eos> Look closer.<eos> A girl of the beauty salon remembers you were wearing it.<eos> She made a mistake.<eos> Is it you on this picture?<eos> You're wearing the same ring.<eos> I lost it, I thought it had been stolen.

Do you also want to shoot heroin, a blow job and a chocolate bar?<eos> He doesn't.<eos> Let me go. Please.<eos> Go get him a blanket and make coffee for him.<eos> Do you want a cigarette?<eos> - Did you give the ring to Patricia?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You stole it from your mum.<eos> - No, I didn't steal anything.<eos> My grandmother gave it to me. For my future wife.

Really.<eos> No, look at that thing.<eos> It's like it's made out of Wolverine's bones.<eos> You know...<eos> Cause they're...<eos> Does nobody read X-Men? !<eos> So hey, how about I take a crack?<eos> I bet I can kill that pesky old worm.<eos> How?<eos> Ya gonna disappoint it to death?
I was halfway out to the airport.<eos> I told you I was getting the bus.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What are you smiling at?<eos> Nothing. Is this all you have?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Travelling light I am.<eos> But you are staying?<eos> All I really had was a telly.<eos> I let my flatmate keep it.
Well, it's less of a quarter, more of a good luck piece, really.<eos> I mean, take a closer look.<eos> Look at the way the light hits it.<eos> Shines and gleams, like liquid sunshine.<eos> Keep looking at it.<eos> It's kind of soothing the way it shines, isn't it?<eos> You can feel your worries and responsibilities just... fading away.<eos> You might even want to close your eyes and just have a little sleep.<eos> My Uncle had a buffalo nickel.<eos> He was always gonna sell it and buy a ranch and all that, but he lost it in a poker game.
Because we've checked every other location connected to Fisher and so have you.<eos> That's why you're here.<eos> - Hasn't this room already been searched, both by the killer and by the police?<eos> - Yes, but they...<eos> I'm sorry... Weren't creative enough.<eos> It could be in bearer bonds hidden in the bills or invoices or files or more likely, in the form of jewels hidden somewhere inside these electronics.<eos> Whatever form it's in, we're gonna find it right now.<eos> Come on in, folks.<eos> These people are gonna take everything and pull it apart until they find the hidden treasure.<eos> Yes, piece by piece, until we find it.
Oh, yes, it's very old.<eos> One of the reasons it's so valuable.<eos> Wow.<eos> I gotta phone this in.<eos> Stop.<eos> Let's talk about this.<eos> If you did call it in, the legal mess will take forever to sort out.<eos> This carpet will just end up in a government locker somewhere.<eos> Yeah, probably.<eos> What if we just... Took it?

It's Tom Drexler.<eos> The billionaire?<eos> You ready for this?<eos> He's got two priors for solicitation.<eos> And he's got a restraining order from an ex-lady friend that he took a swipe at outside a casino.<eos> Powerful guy like that, we can't just bring him in for a chat.<eos> Makes you wonder if that's why this girl took off.<eos> We need more.<eos> Yeah, Ray's taking a look at Rosie's computer.<eos> We already checked it, so now we're looking for what?
No way LT's gonna call that circumstantial.<eos> Do we have the number of the incoming call?<eos> Phone company needs a 24-hour turnaround to get it.<eos> But that don't matter, Linden.<eos> We know that's Bennet on the wire.<eos> All we got to do now is cross our I's and dot our T's.<eos> This is detective Linden.<eos> Send two units to 827 Hudson street.<eos> Tell them to keep eyes on Bennet Ahmed until I get there.<eos> Type up the warrant and have your judge friend sign it.
I assist Mr. John McGarrigle.<eos> Then you're quite early.<eos> Your daughters?<eos> Only the little one.<eos> Well, rather dark, all of a sudden, in this hole I've dug for myself.<eos> What do you want, Mr. Sleater?<eos> With your kind permission, ma'am, I'm to ensure your home is safe for Mr. McGarrigle's visit this evening.<eos> We're not much given to threatening our guests.<eos> You do have the hammer.<eos> My son seems to think it's a toy.
Disposed of by our killer, just not the killer we thought.<eos> Did we get prints? Yeah, Amber Middleberry's and one other set belonging to the lovely, the talented...<eos> Contestant from Georgia.<eos> Which one was...<eos> Oh.<eos> Amber and I have been friends since little Miss Spangles.<eos> Why would you think I killed her?<eos> Because your prints were all over the violin case, Joy.<eos> And she had it with her when she came back from dinner last night.<eos> I held it for her while she fixed her tights.
BIG MIKE:<eos> It's about steaks and gambling and-and getting into in some weird stuff that just might haunt you the rest of your life.<eos> Amen. Michael, may I have a word with you over there by that crappy tree?<eos> Listen.<eos> I have a plan.<eos> Don't bother telling me-<eos> - I'm in. All right.<eos> You were the best, wiener girl.<eos> Hey, Chuck, listen, the secure CIA location has been compromised, and we need to bring in the Orion computer immediately.<eos> Can you please call me back and tell me where your sister keeps it, okay?
I know there's a lot of bad water under the bridge.<eos> But we were family once.<eos> I'd have died for you.<eos> I almost did a few times.<eos> So if that means anything to you...<eos> Please.<eos> I've lost Lisa, I've lost Ben and now I've lost Sam.<eos> Don't make me lose you too.<eos> You don't need this kind of juice anymore, Cass.<eos> Get rid of it before it kills us all.
They just build these traps in the natural cavieses of a car, but this kind of work can cost 50 grand.<eos> Out of all five boroughs, it came back down to one shop.<eos> They trick out vehicles for celebrities, rappers, and my guess would be high-end drug dealers.<eos> Does Danny know?<eos> Yeah, he does now.<eos> That's detective-level police work, Officer Reagan.<eos> Thought you were working a tour today.<eos> I called in sick, Commissioner.<eos> I don't know who customized that car.<eos> The Hummer was tricked out here, and you're the guy who tricked it out.
Except the Blacks. The Blacks are the exception.<eos> They're like ice dancing.<eos> But for everyone else this is the truth.<eos> As time passes, they begin to understand the value of modesty, of group strength, of groups making collective decisions, of keeping your mouth shut and checking up the ranks.<eos> - You understand though?<eos> Si.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't know where my ball has landed.<eos> You know, I think it might have floated into those trees over there.<eos> - You guys think you can help me find it?
All right. You two crazy kids take him back to cell 24.<eos> But, uh, I think this girl's already been to cell 24.<eos> Oh, she looks like a dirty one.<eos> Oh, I get it.<eos> Yeah, like cell 24. Dirty one.<eos> Hey, that's so sweet.<eos> You defended my honor.<eos> Well, you know, we're getting married in a week, sweetheart.<eos> Now, let's get rid of this body, huh?<eos> I'll get rid of it.
She's the one you protect.<eos> Where's The Norseman?<eos> I don't know why Chuck felt it was necessary to come and get me.<eos> I think Chuck wouldn't have felt it necessary if you had any backup.<eos> Chuck knows that I can take care of myself.<eos> Maybe, but now Chuck and the rest of his family are in harm's way two days before his wedding.<eos> The food here is really ghastly.<eos> Where's the guard?<eos> It's been moved, but I don't know where.<eos> Vivian's planning a meet to sell it to the highest bidder.
Yeah, they're all dead.<eos> Casey, that was amazing!<eos> Oh, Lord, I feel faint. Just breathe.<eos> Get to the elevator.<eos> I'll meet you outside.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like they're leaving the building.<eos> The weapon's in the trunk.<eos> I'm going to get something to open it.
You remember that?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Well, we couldn't afford it, but the very next day, your mom and I started looking for a bigger house.<eos> True story.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You wanted to talk to me?<eos> We, uh, just wanted to tie up a few loose ends, Mrs. Olson.<eos> Will this take long?<eos> I need to meet everybody to sign the transfer permit so we can take Lance's body home.<eos> You know, we're just looking at this case from every angle, you know, before we wrap it up.
Do not let a royal husband cost me still greater remorse, for pity's sake!<eos> Reassure your troubled heart, calm all your cares in your King.<eos> Let him see you happier from now on in the love that makes you his.<eos> Who is this?<eos> My dear Percy, you, in England?<eos> I am called back, my friend, by a sign from Henry.<eos> And my plan is to present myself before him on his way to the hunt.<eos> After such long exile to breathe the old air under native skies is sweet to other hearts; to mine it is bitter.<eos> My dear Percy, sorrow. has not changed you so much that I could not recognize you immediately.<eos> My suffering is not the kind to show itself in the face: it is all gathered deep in my heart.
Has he denounced Anne?<eos> He revealed a crime that made us shudder and blush.<eos> She is lost, poor woman!<eos> - It made us blush with shame.<eos> - The King is her accuser.<eos> Withdraw, the King is coming.<eos> What brings you from the assembly?<eos> My presence would now be inappropriate.<eos> The first blow has fallen;<eos> the man who struck it now withdraws.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - You're out of breath.<eos> Yeah, Alex and I had a problem.<eos> Maurice chased us.<eos> - Can we get out of here?<eos> - What good is your car?<eos> Did it break down?<eos> I promised Sonia I would take her to the Caen funfair.<eos> But my car...<eos> Other than pushing it or blowing it up, I don't see how I can make it move.
Yesterday, Alizee was crazy.<eos> She was dressed all sexy and glamorous, you know?<eos> I started touching her and she was into it.<eos> Suddenly, she pushed me away.<eos> Don't try to understand.<eos> Wait, there's more.<eos> I was tired so I went to sleep.<eos> I dreamt that someone was holding my cock.<eos> I woke up and saw her jerking me off like crazy.<eos> She just took my cock and stuck it in her pussy.
So that's all you'd do?<eos> That's all you can do.<eos> Is it?<eos> Isn't that House's chicken?<eos> Disgusting beasts.<eos> I don't know why I ever agreed to this bet.<eos> So call it off.<eos> And lose $20?<eos> Listen, House was in the exact same situation Kendall's in.<eos> He needed surgery, but he didn't want it.
Fuck you!<eos> Jenny!<eos> Shit!<eos> Jenny!<eos> Jenny...<eos> Please, this isn't easy to explain.<eos> I'm the coolest girl you've ever met, and you're chickening out!<eos> -But...<eos> -Because I'm so young?<eos> Your poop humor isn't very mature, but I love it.
Is drunk.<eos> Who're you, Carrie Nation?<eos> But my God, Sterling look at your clothes!<eos> Just how drunk are you?<eos> - Oh for the...<eos> - We're meeting Lachouffe in two hours!<eos> I'll clean him up, try to get some coffee in him.<eos> Make sure that's all you put in him!<eos> Im sorry, what?<eos> Keep it in your pants, sister.
I'll fuck you off the roof, I will.<eos> I'm sorry John Boy, please.<eos> Dirty bitch.<eos> That's not going to save you.<eos> I don't give a fuck any more.<eos> Everything's gone to shit!<eos> Do you fucking hear me? Yeah.<eos> Everything's going to shit.<eos> Who's getting you the gear?<eos> Who's getting it for you?
So if I can get into the company's system, I might be able to find the car.<eos> "Might. "<eos> Sorry.<eos> You saw what that virus did to those people on the ship.<eos> How they died.<eos> If Sophia releases the virus, how bad could it be?<eos> The original Spanish flue epidemic killed between 50 and 100 million people and that's before international travel was so easy.<eos> And this strain's more virulent?<eos> Way more.<eos> If Sophia released it, I don't know what would be left.
- We need to talk, but we can't do it under these circumstances.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - We intercepted a 24-second conversation between Mrs. Martinez and former Director Sterling.<eos> - 24 seconds.<eos> Is that all?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Well, what did Sterling say?<eos> - We don't know yet.<eos> The call was encrypted.<eos> Then decrypt it.
What's wrong?<eos> - What?<eos> - What?<eos> I did fine.<eos> I wouldn't say fine.<eos> - Let me down!<eos> - You're tickling me!<eos> What's that?<eos> A wedding ring.<eos> Who gave it to you?
You let these fucking people walk all over you.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> Keep telling yourself that, Mrs. Laguerta.<eos> You're lucky we got work to do.<eos> What's so interesting?<eos> Tooth is chipped.<eos> Well, no surprise there.<eos> She really got worked over.<eos> It's probably from the beating.<eos> Or someone tried to rip it out.
I remember when I found that under your bed.<eos> I would have rather it had been a stack of Playboys.<eos> Most kids in the eighth grade were obsessed with their favorite baseball players.<eos> You tried serial killers.<eos> Only certain ones.<eos> The Tooth Fairy was smart... and arrogant.<eos> They never caught him, even when he left a body on a deputy sheriff's lawn.<eos> 15 women--prostitutes-- all dumped on the roadside, all missing their lateral incisors.<eos> You really think there's a connection to the victim from this morning?<eos> Her lateral incisor was cracked like someone tried to rip it out with pliers.
Moved here from Grants Pass, Oregon, five years ago.<eos> How are you spending your second childhood?<eos> What's that?<eos> Oh, you've been doing such a good job, I put together a little surprise for your viewing pleasure.<eos> Is this what I think it is?<eos> Evidence from the Ice Truck Killer investigation.<eos> You said in class how you were really into this case.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I was obsessed with this case.<eos> I have followed it night and day.
- Not about the case.<eos> I want to know how you're doing with the whole situation.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, I'm good.<eos> Uh, matter of fact, I just got done packing up your stuff.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> You know, I figured you're busy with your new job and all.<eos> You know, might not have time.<eos> Kind of wanted it out of the house.<eos> So, um, if you want to pick it up, it's in the garage right next to the big bag of fertilizer.
For work.<eos> We're tracking this killer.<eos> We think he's reenacting scenes from the Book of Revelation.<eos> That four horsemen case from the news, yeah?<eos> Lord have mercy.<eos> Saying it's in the name of God-- the devil is busy.<eos> You think he's using God as an excuse to kill?<eos> People use God as an excuse for a lot of things.<eos> Just because he believes in some crazy bullshit, that don't mean his faith is any less real.<eos> But if faith makes people do such crazy bullshit, what's the point of having it?
Gotta believe in something.<eos> Right?<eos> I mean, haven't you ever had a problem so big that you just couldn't handle it on your own?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, who helped you?<eos> My dad.<eos> Well, you're lucky.<eos> You're blessed.<eos> That's a blessing.<eos> Faith, man, you put it in the wrong things... fuck you up.
You got a little, like, like, cilantro or something in the--<eos> What?<eos> Is this yours?<eos> No.<eos> It belonged to the kid that sold me the car.<eos> I mean, the weed, the Trans-Am.<eos> I mean, if you're having a mid-life crisis, we can talk about it.<eos> I'm not having a mid-life crisis.<eos> What's wrong with this car?<eos> I think it's cool.
You have to give the site what you're selling before they agree to auction it.<eos> - Fuckers. - I see.<eos> So my question to you is...<eos> Can I make this problem go away?<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> A minute.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> What? The engagement ring.<eos> Fuck me in the ear, I never gave it back to you.
- Fuckers. - I see.<eos> So my question to you is...<eos> Can I make this problem go away?<eos> I'll look into it.<eos> Can I talk to you for a minute?<eos> A minute.<eos> This is awkward.<eos> What?

- I'll get it back to you.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I better go.<eos> Got some professors to harass.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Jamie, it's Debra.<eos> I need a little favor from you. About two weeks ago, I brought a ring box home with an engagement ring in it.<eos> You lost an engagement ring?<eos> I left it on Harrison's side of the apartment.

I know that.<eos> Next time, why don't you call me over there?<eos> I will. From now on.<eos> And maybe you could keep the photos on Dexter's desk, so Harrison won't see them.<eos> Again, if you were doing your job, this wouldn't have happened in the first place.<eos> My job?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Really?<eos> You mean my job isn't to be your fucking maid?<eos> - Uh-oh. - I found it. - Thank you.
Looks like a robbery gone bad.<eos> Or Julio's gang finally got even with Brother Sam for stealing Nick away.<eos> I suppose it's too much to hope... It is.<eos> DVD's missing.<eos> Whatever happened to stupid criminals?<eos> They're still stupid.<eos> We'll catch this piece of shit.<eos> The likely shooter is Julio's replacement.<eos> Taking out Brother Sam would be a good way to boost his cred as shot caller.<eos> See, Louis, the art of dusting lies in the caressing of the powder over the print so as not to corrupt it as if one was trying to... get a nipple erect.
Hey, uh--<eos> I heard what you did at that crime scene.<eos> You know, the body was moved and then repositioned.<eos> So cool--you gotta show me how you figure that stuff out.<eos> Yeah, sure, we'll do that sometime, but right now, I gotta...<eos> Okay, I'm going to make this quick.<eos> The whole city is freaking out over DDK.<eos> We're getting over 100 calls a day-- people saying that they've seen Gellar, people asking if it's safe to go out at night.<eos> I need everyone's asses on the fucking ball.<eos> I'm going to keep rearranging that sentence to make it hotter.
So what am I supposed to do?<eos> If I do my job and I investigate a possible homicide, then--<eos> I piss off captain close-it.<eos> And if I close it, this guy walks.<eos> Maybe you should talk to Laguerta.<eos> Yeah. Maybe I should.<eos> Either way, I have to sign this fucking blood report. Do you have a pen?<eos> Ah, here.<eos> Why do you have a pen from the Shady Lane Motel at Kearney, Nebraska?<eos> Uh... Must have picked it up somewhere.
I'd like you to reopen Jessica's case.<eos> Mr. Morris, I know this must be very difficult, but the medical examiner ruled that your daughter's death was an accidental overdose, not a homicide.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> But her sternum was cracked.<eos> And paramedics said they never performed CPR because she was already dead when they arrived.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Does it matter?<eos> If someone was with her when she died, why aren't you looking into that?<eos> I'm sorry, but the case is closed.<eos> Well, then reopen it.
The sensors won't work if the lock's broken.<eos> That's why Stephen had new doors put in for me. Alright Ma.<eos> Stephen, what happened to you? Slipped.<eos> Whacked my head on car door.<eos> Let me see.<eos> Did you get stitches?<eos> Forget about it.<eos> Did you give her a panic button?<eos> Yeah, she has a fob.<eos> She can have it with her all the time.
You know I've the appointment with the consultant this morning. Yeah.<eos> I've time for a shower, do I?<eos> Alright.<eos> Jayz, the smell of that.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What do you expect?<eos> Do you buy it like that off the butcher?<eos> No you dope.<eos> Farmer gave it me.<eos> Once they die of disease they can't give it to humans.
There's no such thing as ordinary.<eos> Have a dream!<eos> A boat shack is fine!<eos> Ordinary is the best!<eos> Good morning.<eos> Sumida!<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you remember my name?<eos> Keiko Chazawa.<eos> You got it!
It's not working.<eos> You two, calm down.<eos> Leave!<eos> Go away!<eos> Go!<eos> It really hurts!<eos> Sumida.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Stop!<eos> When I get pissed, I'll take a rock from here and keep it in my pocket.
You don't seem congested.<eos> Hmm, intriguing.<eos> You have any thoughts about our patient?<eos> Got some questions about whether Thirteen really believes in karma or just wants to.<eos> As for the patient, it's not gonna be easy to break into her office.<eos> Might want to start with her home.<eos> We could ask to look through her office and we could do an MRI first.<eos> Sure.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> If you're not interested in the case, why'd you take it?
Show him in.<eos> What is it, my teacher?<eos> Your Majesty, the news from Syria is bad.<eos> The governor, Canberdi Gazali, has begun a rebellion.<eos> He has allied himself with the Mameluke and Arab lords.<eos> The rebels will be given the appropriate response.<eos> Summon the council immediately.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> Shall we present the report on the Syrian matter to the council?<eos> Well done, bring it.
Shall we wage war against them too?<eos> Your Majesty, perhaps we should send an envoy with a letter commanding them to pay the gold.<eos> For the good of the relationship.<eos> So you advise diplomacy, Piri Pasha?<eos> This is how it was done in Rome.<eos> They revered diplomacy.<eos> Negotiation first.<eos> Let's speak politely.<eos> Then we can draw our swords and destroy them.<eos> I'll prepare the letter and give it to Sergeant Behram.
What can a physician do for me?<eos> -My--<eos> -Tonight is Thursday night.<eos> Is this how you want to greet His Majesty?<eos> Compose yourself. Come on.<eos> I haven't laughed like that for a long time.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I made that ring.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Which woman will it be given to?
But the Rhodians command the Mediterranean.<eos> The earliest we can start this campaign is in spring.<eos> Perhaps even later.<eos> But even if we can't capture Rhodes right away it would be good if we start stirring things up from the inside.<eos> If you can't beat them, frustrate them?<eos> I am not saying that.<eos> Aristotle does.<eos> He was the mentor of Alexander the Great.<eos> "It is difficult to swallow a big bite.<eos> Divide it before eating," he said.
Get away from that woman!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Let go of my son!<eos> He fell and I helped him up.<eos> This ring is mine!<eos> How dare you wear it!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> You thief!<eos> The Sultan gave it to me!<eos> You can't have it.
Let's taste some fresh lokum , sweeten our mouths.<eos> It isn't here!<eos> The ring isn't here!<eos> It isn't here!<eos> Where is it?<eos> What are you yelling about?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> You took it!<eos> Give me the ring back!<eos> -You took it!
It isn't here!<eos> Where is it?<eos> What are you yelling about?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> You took it!<eos> Give me the ring back!<eos> -You took it!<eos> -Stop making accusations or I'll hurt you!<eos> -Where is it?<eos> -I don't have it!
You seem alarmed.<eos> What now?<eos> There's been a fight in the hamam.<eos> Hürrem Hatun made a scene claiming her ring had been stolen.<eos> She says that the Sultan's ring has been stolen.<eos> Who would dare?<eos> Have them look for it immediately!<eos> Scour the Harem and find that ring!<eos> Thievery is an unforgivable crime.<eos> She must've hidden it herself.
I know it, no one does.<eos> All of you, get off your beds and come here!<eos> Now!<eos> Stop dawdling!<eos> Come on, quicker!<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go! Get in line!<eos> Be silent and listen!<eos> A ring was lost in the hamam tonight.<eos> Whoever finds it will immediately bring it to me.
The army will enter wherever they spilled my Sergeant Behram's blood.<eos> Your Majesty, Louis II will pay.<eos> It is not enough that he learns his lesson, Pasha!<eos> Whoever defends him, whichever infidels support him will pay too.<eos> They will meet Süleyman's army and never forget it!<eos> Nigar kalfa what happened?<eos> You were supposed to be my eyes and ears in the Harem.<eos> Why didn't you tell me about the ring?<eos> It was at night.<eos> We looked everywhere, but couldn't find it.
Come on, tell me.<eos> Get it off your chest.<eos> Who made you do this?<eos> My Sultan.<eos> I wouldn't have disturbed you if it wasn't important.<eos> I can only take care of this with your help.<eos> Tell me what happened, İbrahim.<eos> Yes?<eos> My Sultan, the emerald ring is not lost.<eos> Mahidevran has it.
-I'll be there presently, Daye.<eos> -She expects you now.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Inshallah. I hope nothing's wrong.<eos> You will stay here.<eos> We have things to do.<eos> I shouldn't leave my Sultan alone, if she gets ill...<eos> Come here.<eos> Look, I know what you're up to.<eos> Now, you'll get the ring and put it in my palm.
King Louis II beheaded the Ottoman ambassador.<eos> This mad king doesn't know what he's doing.<eos> I fear that the Ottomans' response will be grievous.<eos> The war preparations have begun.<eos> Warn the Buda Palace.<eos> Get in line.<eos> Search the beds.<eos> Whose bed is this?<eos> The ring has been found in your bed.<eos> I swear I didn't steal it!
I didn't steal it!<eos> I swear I didn't steal it!<eos> It's slander!<eos> Lies!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Let go of me!<eos> I didn't steal it!<eos> Let go!<eos> Put the ring on your finger.<eos> And don't you ever take it off until you die.
Don't you want to get out, Melanie?<eos> Look, if we give them the egg, then we can all escape.<eos> I could see my parents again.<eos> Please, Julia.<eos> You've always said that the dome is here to protect us.<eos> It didn't protect my mom.<eos> Or my sister. Melanie, I know what I said.<eos> But maybe the cliffs, the tunnels... they're all the dome's way of telling us something new.<eos> That we need to leave.<eos> - Or send the egg over. - No. I died once for the egg and then it brought me back.

- I don't know.<eos> He's done a lot of good for Chester's Mill, and the moment I told him about it...<eos> You knew you shouldn't have?<eos> I know a lot of people don't trust him, but I'm still trying to believe in him.<eos> As messed up as it all is, I still think he was a good father once.<eos> I understand, but not all fathers can be who you want them to be.<eos> What are you doing here, Melanie?<eos> Your dad's not the only one with a reason to take the egg.<eos> I've had faith in Julia this whole time.<eos> I-I still try to have it, but I don't know anymore.
I've had faith in Julia this whole time.<eos> I-I still try to have it, but I don't know anymore.<eos> I think her priorities have shifted.<eos> Barbie is more important to her now.<eos> So she's gonna trade the egg for him?<eos> Isn't that what you would do for the people you love?<eos> Things that seem reckless to everyone else?<eos> Not everyone gets that.<eos> Not everyone's been in love.<eos> Do you want to protect it with me from now on?

Good luck.<eos> You're gonna need it.<eos> Nucky.<eos> Thompson.<eos> There is a youth the Commodore wishes to place in service.<eos> What's that got to do with me?<eos> The task is entrusted to the sheriff.<eos> Whitlock: You understand this is an act of charity?<eos> You tell Jared Dano he's a...<eos> "I wanted the gold, and I sought it; I scrabbled and mucked like a slave.

I fought it;<eos> "I hurled my youth into a grave."<eos> "I wanted the gold and I got it..." Came out with a fortune last fall...
How good is your Russian?<eos> Good enough to know that this is a rap sheet from Moscow.<eos> I talked to two people at the prison, the Captain and the Warden, both of whom confirmed what's on that rap sheet.<eos> You know what that word means?<eos> Incarcerated.<eos> According to the Russians, Keller is still in prison.<eos> Doesn't make sense.<eos> Unless his benefactor is someone who want it to look like he's still behind bars.<eos> Keep the tracks covered.<eos> Nobody would suspect you of a crime if they knew you weren't able to commit it.
First it's a case. Then it's a client.<eos> Before you know it, you're on the 38th floor with Ted.<eos> - Who's Ted?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> What did I just do?<eos> I'll tell you what you're gonna do.<eos> You're gonna stop writing in that pussy diary, and you're gonna show Jessica you're the one who should be sitting in that corner office.<eos> Ready the dictaphone.<eos> We're gonna need it.
Oh, this isn't his office anymore.<eos> Oh, did he get fired?<eos> No, but he is moving.<eos> Louis, I know it hasn't always been easy for you to embrace new partners, but you've made a great effort with Jeff.<eos> All in a day's work.<eos> And your day's work has benefited this firm for years.<eos> So we thought it was time to show you a little overdue appreciation.<eos> This office?<eos> I gave this office to Jeff because I wanted him to feel valued here.<eos> But the truth is, I-- I should have given it to you.
Jacob Nighthorse, you're under arrest for conspiracy, aiding and abetting, and accessory to the attempted murder of Branch Connally.<eos> Jenine, call my lawyer.<eos> You are both gonna regret this.<eos> I doubt that.<eos> You have no evidence David is alive.<eos> Nothing, except the fact that you two spoke 17 times in the past 2 weeks.<eos> Ridges is awful talkative for a dead man.<eos> I imagine it gives you great pleasure to see me in here.<eos> Walt: Your lawyer's on her way.<eos> Till then, you have the right to remain silent, and I suggest you use it.
If only I could see this thing!<eos> Don't even joke about that.<eos> I'm not joking about it.<eos> One minute with me and this thing, it would be over!<eos> You know, Doctor, I can't tell if you're a genius or just incredibly arrogant.<eos> Well, on a good day, I'm both.<eos> Ancient tech.<eos> This thing has been around for centuries.<eos> How?<eos> Tech that keeps it alive.
Every simulation we've run confirms it.<eos> Okay, but... But we're in here and if we stay in here, that thing can't...<eos> This thing can teleport.<eos> We need her here.<eos> Even the computer agrees.<eos> Okay, so you can save her?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> This is another chance to observe it in action.
We'll put him in a box.<eos> Seeing as he won't be entirely dead, your friends will be safe.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is amazing.<eos> I developed an appreciation for the music when I moved here.<eos> I never had a taste for it before.<eos> I see you're still developing your taste for beer.<eos> My mom said beer wasn't ladylike.<eos> So I learned to love it as an act of rebellion.
To the end of an era.<eos> I'm in.<eos> It's working.<eos> What the bloody hell is that doing here?<eos> As each of you comes to your senses and takes my offer, I will destroy your vampire bodies.<eos> Mother, you said you wanted the stake to protect them.<eos> Yes, but not in their current bodies.<eos> Once they accept my offer, I will be righting two wrongs...<eos> No.<eos> Having brought this evil into the world and having subjected my own children to it.
You and your traitorous son.<eos> Nik, I didn't know anything about it, I swear.<eos> Oh, good. I'm glad you two boys are friends again.<eos> I did wonder what you'd been up to in your time away.<eos> Now I know.<eos> Stop the blasted spell.<eos> I'm afraid that's impossible.<eos> Anything is possible.<eos> - Take me instead.<eos> - Nik, no! If only you'd taken my offer when it was still mine to give.
Yeah, of course they do.<eos> They know all about you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hey. - Can you put this in the back room?<eos> I don't feel like answering any questions about Kevin's wedding.<eos> Yeah, can I, uh, take a look?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wow. Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.<eos> Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.

Jesus, that's some O'Hara shit.<eos> Yeah, I have to keep the tag on so I can return it afterwards.<eos> No, don't do that.<eos> You deserve nice things.<eos> Or something. I don't know.<eos> Pretend I know what I'm talking about and keep it.
Yeah, I know. He needs to learn some manners.<eos> Do you want pot roast?<eos> Mm, Jay will want steak.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I'm cool with whatever.<eos> No.<eos> Nate, what do you want?<eos> What do you like to eat? We've got a whole store here.<eos> Nate, food is not just fuel.<eos> It's... you're supposed to enjoy it.
I'm so sorry about that.<eos> OK, bye.<eos> Where's Will?<eos> He's changed his shift.<eos> He's probably at the gym.<eos> You told him about the journal, didn't you?<eos> What?<eos> Don't play fucking dumb with me, Vera.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> You told him about it. Now he's stolen it!
I had nothing to do with it.<eos> OK? Just like you didn't send those texts or slash my tyres!<eos> I know nothing about that.<eos> What texts?<eos> Get out of my way.<eos> No, mate. You're gonna hear me out.<eos> OK?<eos> You're gonna hear me out.<eos> What? Does your shrink want a few more pages for your journal?<eos> So you read it.
- That's not gonna happen.<eos> - It's my right.<eos> You assassinated a Saudi prince on American soil. CRYSTAL:<eos> You need to know that you may be extradited to Saudi Arabia to stand trial.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I'm gonna be sick.<eos> Walter, can you get her some water?<eos> You didn't know about the phone?<eos> Of course, I didn't know.<eos> A man named Aaron Rawley gave it to me.
Sorry for the cloak-and-dagger routine.<eos> (ENGINE STARTING NEARBY) Sebastian, a-are you okay?<eos> You were right about that tiger.<eos> He doesn't like it when you grab his tail.<eos> You didn't see any cameras on your way, did you? No.<eos> I scouted, but...<eos> I just wanted to double-check.<eos> I'm bloody paranoid these days.<eos> You don't have a cell, right?<eos> I left it, just as you asked.
What?<eos> The box.<eos> The box you found that lured that infernal witch to your house.<eos> Why?<eos> I believe it is the fabled malum, the key to the grand rite.<eos> This more of your book nonsense?<eos> That box covered in images --<eos> I believe it is the greatest weapon of the witches, that it contains some kind of supernatural agent of destruction which will open when the grand rite is completed, releasing its doom upon us like...<eos> Like the myth of pandora.<eos> Look, if that thing is what you say it is, and your father knows that I have it, that is the final nail in my coffin.

No.<eos> Sir.<eos> I still think what you do is fundamentally wrong, that there must be other ways, but...<eos> I am afraid.<eos> Deathly afraid.<eos> I fear, while we disagree on methods, we are both determined to stop the grand rite.<eos> Well... I'm gratified that you at least acknowledge that.<eos> The malum is here.<eos> Or was.<eos> I saw it. I touched it, even.

Tell me where you saw it.
You did not attack without me?<eos> I was almost killed!<eos> My general, Aruka, has passed to the Blue Sky!<eos> The rains cut off passage of the Blue Horde.<eos> You should have sent word.<eos> I did.<eos> My best rider...<eos> Duwa.<eos> They captured him outside of Wuchang.<eos> Tied his head to his horse... let it run home.
"It is a curious subject whether hatred and love be not the same thing at bottom.<eos> Each leaves the passionate lover, or the no less passionate hater, forlorn and desolate by the withdrawal of his subject."<eos> Aria, it's probably just a school assignment.<eos> No, this is about Ali and Jenna and us.<eos> This is about being 'A.'<eos> No, this is about you trying to paw through Shana's things when you should be trying to forget about her.<eos> Well, there might be something in here. Just stop.<eos> Who's throwing out The Scarlet Letter.<eos> I loved this book.<eos> Maybe you should get it for Ali.
Paige.<eos> Oh, I'm just a friend.<eos> I wasn't able to send flowers so I was wondering if I could donate to the cost of the service.<eos> Well, her grandmother's been a member of our congregation for a long time.<eos> I'm certain she would want to thank you for your...<eos> Oh, no, no, I'd really, really rather the donation be anonymous.<eos> Is it possible to send cash?<eos> What are you doing? Oh, no.<eos> We can't accept cash.<eos> I suppose you could send it to Shana's grandmother directly.
Aria?<eos> That's not trying to find a way to forgive yourself.<eos> That's hoping that they forgive you.<eos> It was anonymous.<eos> I'm talking about the intention behind it.<eos> And even if they did forgive you, it's not like they would do it because of a donation.<eos> You're right.<eos> I know this isn't easy.<eos> And I can say this to you, because it's what I have to tell myself every night.<eos> Once you found out about the book... the only thing that I could think of was how to make it up to you.
So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.<eos> You can't do it, Harvey.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Logan's gonna do it anyway.<eos> At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> - No one's ever found it before.

According to your phone records, you've had four calls from this house in the past week.<eos> Your drawing skills have really gotten better, Penny.<eos> I didn't know it was your work at first.<eos> I thought it looked like a police sketch.<eos> But the perspective was wrong.<eos> Almost looked like a... like an image from a security camera.<eos> Like the one at your front gate.<eos> The victim came to this house, didn't he?<eos> His image was caught on the camera.<eos> You drew it and gave it to Fred Tavish.
I'm representing one of the defendants, rebecca sutter.<eos> Annalise: Does anyone else know about this?<eos> Only rebecca and I know it exists.<eos> Sam, why is your penis on a dead girl's phone?<eos> Did lila ever share any details about this man?<eos> Just that he was married. She called him mr. Darcy.<eos> Thank you for picking me, making me frank's girl.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> I know how you got rebecca's confession tape.<eos> We both know what person in this house you did it for, And it wasn't me.
I looked in all the cupboards. And I found some other things.<eos> - Oh, yes?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I found a book by Marie Stopes and a box containing a cunning piece of equipment to ensure there would be no Baby Bates.<eos> And I'm supposed to applaud your poking around in my things, am I?<eos> Now just a minute, it is not for you to be angry with me. It is for me<eos> - to be angry with you.<eos> - How do you make that out?<eos> You tell me you are longing for a child. That it's in the hands of God.<eos> But you seem to have put it in the very practised hands of Miss Stopes.
Ah, Daisy, there you are.<eos> I wondered if you'd like to borrow this?<eos> The fifth volume of The Cambridge Modern History.<eos> My Dad gave me the whole set for my 40th birthday.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I've got so many books already.<eos> Don't be churlish, Daisy.<eos> Mr Molesley's offering to lend you one of his prized possessions.<eos> There's a good chapter on the war and politics in Queen Anne's reign.<eos> Of course, if it's not interesting to you, I'd quite understand.

- Hello, Lord and Lady Sinderby.<eos> - Good evening, Rose.<eos> - Er, you know my cousin?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We were in awe - of your courage yesterday.<eos> - Well, courage or foolhardiness.<eos> Come and see Mama and Papa.<eos> To be honest, we're in the middle of rather a drama, which I'll tell you about but you mustn't let on.<eos> Our first secret.<eos> This is cold, so it can go up now but cover it till it's served.
(SIGHS) I leave it to your mother.<eos> Well, I believe we should offer little Marigold a home here.<eos> Do you really, darling?<eos> Well, then, I suppose that's settled.<eos> Have all the guests arrived?<eos> I think so.<eos> Oh, I should tell Mrs Patmore that it won't be long now.<eos> What are these?<eos> Oh, Mr Carson's got a notion he and I might buy a place as an investment.<eos> And maybe run it as a guest house or... or rent it out.
I'm pleased.<eos> Now we can get on with the work as soon as we're home.<eos> Shall we?<eos> I've spoiled the painting for you, haven't I?<eos> With Mr Bricker.<eos> That's why you're selling.<eos> Yes.<eos> But not in the way you think.<eos> Every time I look at it, I am reminded that I didn't trust you.<eos> And I feel so angry with myself, I want to be rid of it.
Whatever.<eos> You can't even go on a date without checking your relationship agreement.<eos> If you've got a problem basing a relationship on a contract, I'd like to tell you about 13 plucky colonies that entered a "relationship agreement" called the U.S. Constitution.<eos> And it may not be cool to say so, but I think that love affair is still pretty hot today.<eos> It's a good thing I'm not wearing flag underwear right now, 'cause there's about to be a fire.<eos> Okay, it's not that hard.<eos> You just look to where you want to throw it, step towards where you want to throw, and throw it.<eos> That's your help?<eos> That's like saying, "Here's how you fly a plane:<eos> "Get in the airplane, know where you want to go and fly it."
- Yes.<eos> Waiting patiently!<eos> With nothing but a T-shirt, in this cold!<eos> - A fuckin' faggot, I bet!<eos> - Even better!<eos> - What does he do?<eos> - He's a captain.<eos> - A brothel-creeper then!<eos> - That's how I like 'em.<eos> Mom's store will go bust, if you close it every time you wanna get laid!

It's over!<eos> What are these?<eos> What the fuck are all these?<eos> Have you got any idea how much money we owe?<eos> You'll go to jail, don't you get it?<eos> How will you pay your debts?<eos> With dad's pension?<eos> Where will you get the money?<eos> Where?<eos> Who's gonna give it to you?
Describe the rock face.<eos> Any vegetation?<eos> Nope.<eos> It's dead as a doornail.<eos> Got to be 20 feet down by now.<eos> Can you see the bottom?<eos> No!<eos> But the darkness... I think I'm... getting closer to it.<eos> Hey! - You guys messing with the rope?<eos> - No, we didn't touch it!
Barbie!<eos> Hey!<eos> Rebecca!<eos> Barbie, I've got the rope!<eos> You need to climb!<eos> Julia, let go!<eos> Julia!<eos> Julia, let go of the rope!<eos> The hell I will!<eos> Julia, I can't hold it!
And I was wrong, and now... James is stuck in there.<eos> I guess anything is possible if you and Lyle could get out.<eos> What?<eos> Have you seen Lyle?<eos> Yes, I've seen him.<eos> He's here.<eos> How about now?<eos> Hold on one sec.<eos> You see anything?<eos> Yeah, we've got picture, and it's recording.
A few weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead we still don't know.<eos> Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us.<eos> Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out.<eos> - Julia, let go of the rope!<eos> - I got you!<eos> Julia, I can't hold it!
Out of nowhere this Wi-Fi signal came back. And Barbie sent you an e-mail.<eos> - What?<eos> - Can you believe it?<eos> We thought he was dead and now he could be alive.<eos> And he sent me an e-mail?<eos> Well, he sent it to me, but it was for you.<eos> "Julia, I love you.<eos> We'll see each other soon.<eos> All it takes is a leap of faith.<eos> So get the egg and bring it with you. Barbie."
You're crazy. - Don't call me that.<eos> What I mean is I don't know how I got here.<eos> One minute I'm next to a cliff underneath Chester's Mill. The next, I'm lying in a playground here.<eos> I looked around for a door or a passageway, nothing.<eos> Well, if you got out, there's gotta be a way in.<eos> Maybe he knows.<eos> Lyle doesn't even know his own name.<eos> But he got through like you did.<eos> And there are doctors here helping patients with a new drug. It's experimental.<eos> I asked them to try it on Lyle. He doesn't fit the protocol.
Can you see that box up top?<eos> - Type in the code "dromas."<eos> - Dromas.<eos> - Uh, I might've screwed something up. - Nope.<eos> Go ahead and take the jump out, and I'll take it from here.<eos> Here's the real e-mail your father sent her.<eos> So "Julia, I love you.<eos> We'll see each other soon.<eos> All it takes is a leap of faith.<eos> So get the egg and bring it with you."
Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us.<eos> Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out.<eos> Well, Hunter May, meet my son Dale.<eos> Hunter, we need you to work your magic, send one more message into the dome.<eos> - Barbie!<eos> - Don't jump!<eos> Barbie!<eos> Maybe the guys who took Barbie are the same ones who want the egg.<eos> How would they even know about it?<eos> - We'll protect it.
Now, all of a sudden, it's getting colder by the hour.<eos> I realize that.<eos> But Lyle didn't make it.<eos> I mean, if these people die getting out, that's on us.<eos> What I know is: we stay here, we die here.<eos> And what's waiting in Zenith?<eos> The playground is under surveillance.<eos> You were interrogated, beaten.<eos> That's because they wanted the egg.<eos> So I say this: "Let's give it to 'em."
Where were you?<eos> I was...<eos> You're back!<eos> Hey.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Mel.<eos> Where's the egg?<eos> It's... gone from Angie's apartment.<eos> But... but Barbie's here.<eos> Why do you want it?
Where's the egg?<eos> It's... gone from Angie's apartment.<eos> But... but Barbie's here.<eos> Why do you want it?<eos> Because it's our way out.<eos> N-No. I'm sorry, Julia, but... I, I can't tell you where it is.<eos> Hey.<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> All four hands should have a say in where the egg is kept and Melanie's probably sitting on it in a nest she built somewhere.<eos> - So we'll find it and we'll take it back.
Because all I brought was this?<eos> - I call dibs. - Food from the outside?<eos> Hey.<eos> What did it feel like when the bomb hit this thing?<eos> I'll tell you after you tell us how you got in here.<eos> No. I can't tell you where the egg is.<eos> But ev-ev... even if it's our ticket out of here?<eos> No.<eos> You know, I've seen that necklace before.<eos> Yeah. You found it where they buried me.
Listen, I'll get us out of here, I promise!<eos> - I made a deal with a guy, okay?<eos> - Jim, please!<eos> Please! He's gonna take care of our family.<eos> - I promise he'll get us out of here! - No, no! Trust me!<eos> Just got to find that damn egg.<eos> She was right about this, too.<eos> You'll let me carry the egg over?<eos> Yeah, I-I will be beside you the entire time.<eos> Do we really have to give it to those people out there?
We met because of the dome.<eos> Julia.<eos> Hey.<eos> I want you in my life whether we end up in Zenith or wherever.<eos> That's a promise that I can keep.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Guys.<eos> You want the egg or not?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Let's get it and get the hell out.
That's a promise that I can keep.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Guys.<eos> You want the egg or not?<eos> - That's it.<eos> - Let's get it and get the hell out.<eos> Why is it screaming?<eos> Something's scaring it.<eos> It's not us.<eos> You calmed it down.
No!<eos> See, Angie?<eos> I really did love you.<eos> It's freaking out.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Do not throw the egg. If that's the power source to the dome, we could all die.<eos> If I don't, he'll kill you.<eos> That's enough talking.<eos> That thing needs to go, now.<eos> Look at it.
It's freaking out.<eos> What are we supposed to do?<eos> Do not throw the egg. If that's the power source to the dome, we could all die.<eos> If I don't, he'll kill you.<eos> That's enough talking.<eos> That thing needs to go, now.<eos> Look at it.<eos> Well, maybe it doesn't want to be here.<eos> This is about my family.<eos> Now, you throw it over now.
But that egg needs to go now.<eos> See?<eos> Is anyone dying.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Joe!<eos> Run.<eos> Run!<eos> It was right here, it was right here!<eos> - Okay, we gotta go!<eos> - Did Junior took it? - I don't know!
We gotta get her heart rate up.<eos> What happened to your face?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Atropine! It's in the vial.<eos> It's atropine.<eos> How long before it works?<eos> Did you take the egg?<eos> No.<eos> Is it gone?<eos> Maybe Joe and Norrie have it.
The minute the earthquake hit, they stopped.<eos> Well, let's go.<eos> Come on, let's get out of here.<eos> I don't know what's gonna happen now.<eos> I do.<eos> We go get Junior and we're the first three over the cliffs.<eos> Okay? I tell the guard on the other side I gave him what he wanted.<eos> The egg stopped screaming.<eos> I know.<eos> Because I threw it over the cliff.
If that's the power source to the dome, we could all die.<eos> If you don't, he'll kill you.<eos> That thing's going to Zenith. It needs to go now.<eos> Melanie!<eos> Phil!<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yeah, he's gone.<eos> The passage closed.<eos> We're stuck here.<eos> What is it doing?
If you don't, he'll kill you.<eos> That thing's going to Zenith. It needs to go now.<eos> Melanie!<eos> Phil!<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yeah, he's gone.<eos> The passage closed.<eos> We're stuck here.<eos> What is it doing?<eos> Put it down. Put it down, now!
But, Doctor, will I ever be able to play the piano again?<eos> You were out there for a long time.<eos> Yeah, I got lost.<eos> Did you know that there's a "Little Bitch Road" about a mile from here?<eos> Yeah, it used to be the most exciting thing about Chester's Mill.<eos> Hey, can I ask you a question?<eos> Something I just never understood.<eos> The egg is the power source of the dome, right?<eos> Yeah, as far as we know.<eos> Yeah, but when you moved it, the dome didn't move with it.
Please!<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Melanie's gonna die.<eos> You don't know that for sure.<eos> And it's all my fault. No.<eos> I never should've let Big Jim knock that egg out of my hand.<eos> He had a gun on you and Joe.<eos> I should've just let him kill me.<eos> And everyone could've gotten out, and now we're really stuck.<eos> Now whoever has that egg can do whatever they want to it, and we can't get it back and we can't even tell them to stop.
I told you he wasn't on our side.<eos> I trusted him.<eos> _<eos> What the hell are you doing? !<eos> - I'm trying to help.<eos> - Liar. We saw your phone.<eos> You're working for the guy who held us captive over the egg.<eos> Why are you here?<eos> Look, they sent me here to report back to them about the egg.<eos> He's been monitoring it for weeks from the outside.

You good?<eos> I'll keep an eye on Melanie.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Shut up and walk.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Ben?<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> It's over, Norrie.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> I just saw the guy who owned the hardware store get his car crushed when the dome smashed into it.
How?<eos> Because that egg brought her back.<eos> Without that here in Chester's Mill, she dies, and all of us die, too.<eos> It's starting again.<eos> _<eos> Barbie, he isn't getting it.<eos> Tell him it's more than just a thing... it's alive somehow.<eos> It knows us.<eos> Barbie, the egg is upset being out there.<eos> If he gives it back,
No, I understand the allusion to the popular young adult dystopian trilogy.<eos> I just don't understand why.<eos> Oh, well, neither do I.<eos> Upon my shot, let the game begin!<eos> Uh, wait, honey, I thought we decided against the flaming arrow.<eos> The whole reason I agreed to do it was because of the flaming arrow.<eos> May the odds be ever in your favor!<eos> - Evan.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> Our roof, I think it's...
Once there, you will proceed to my bank, which is designed not only to insure privacy but near anonymity.<eos> Once inside, you will be left to handle the transaction in private.<eos> You will find all the necessary paperwork in the desk drawer.<eos> Interpol doesn't want to arrest this Berta until they have enough evidence to encourage her to betray those whose money she represents.<eos> All you have to do is sign her electronic transfer, not unlike writing a prescription.<eos> After that, your job is done.<eos> I will be rid of their money, and the authorities will have the evidence they need to build their case.<eos> Mm, no.<eos> No transfers.<eos> I want it in cash.
- My little guesthouse.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - What? - Bob, it's beautiful.<eos> My nephew lived here for a while, but he's gone now.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> - Oh, no, he's still alive.<eos> I just had to find a way to get him to move out.<eos> He had a Christian death metal band that used to practice here.<eos> They were an abomination.<eos> Anyway, I've been a little reluctant to rent it out since then.
Even pizza.<eos> My mother was a lousy cook.<eos> Could you show us the salt?<eos> - Sure.<eos> - It's in here.<eos> You moron.<eos> That's not the salt... this is!<eos> That's the stuff I use to cure the corned beef on St. Patrick's Day.<eos> Sodium nitrite.<eos> And you keep it next to the salt?

But I have been exploiting you, Hank, allowing your moral compass to guide me these last years.<eos> That's why I was so unhappy with your decision to stay in the Hamptons.<eos> I thought I needed to simplify my life, but this life isn't simple, is it?<eos> One doesn't have just one enemy or one stalwart friend.<eos> And purging my bank of one particularly odious apple isn't enough.<eos> My family's business has always been murky, to say the least.<eos> I want to leave my son a different legacy.<eos> And what legacy is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know only that I must summon the courage to find it and find my own compass.
The only wrong move I made was when my eyes lingered in your upper torso area for a second too long it triggered an instant dislike for me.<eos> How do I fix that?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> You're wearing a silk blouse, hint of a bra, red fingernail Polish.<eos> I took the male leap that it was meant to be noticed and let my eyes linger in hopes that you would be flattered.<eos> I miscalculated.<eos> And it just got worse.<eos> This was uploaded on the university's student web site.<eos> You familiar with this video?<eos> Yeah. I've seen it.

I've seen it.<eos> Who hasn't?<eos> But I didn't film it, and I didn't post it online.
I've been discharged.<eos> I'd like to get to class.<eos> Please, Perry.<eos> Detective Davis is here as a favor to me.<eos> We'll be quick.<eos> Guy in the video... Eric Bates... He says you filmed this on your laptop over a year ago when you two were roommates.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> He's just claiming that because it's the best story he can come up with to save his ass.<eos> He doesn't want to admit that he showed his little sex tape to all his buddies and then they shared it with the Internet.
Everybody makes mistakes.<eos> Eric has problems, but he's a good guy.<eos> I want to give him a second chance.<eos> He's lying.<eos> The guy's a pathological liar.<eos> I know I shouldn't have roughed him up.<eos> You did more than that.<eos> You put him in the hospital with a concussion.<eos> And I'm sorry about that, but the guy's been trouble ever since I was roommates with him.<eos> He claims that you made the video yourself and showed it to your friends.
Kelly, what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You know, the usual.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's not even our place, you know.<eos> It's a rental.<eos> Kelly, I'm just gonna grab the knife.<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> It's gross.<eos> I need to clean it off.
- It is not okay.<eos> Black is here, and he's just...standing there.<eos> That's not him, is it?<eos> It's one of his replicates.<eos> How did you get it?<eos> I grew him.<eos> I isolated a sample of Black's blood from you suit to see if I could trigger the in vitro cultivation process and learn how Black multiplies.<eos> So I exposed the target cells to a protein gel, and they began replicating...<eos> Into that.<eos> Why isn't he... It doing anything?
No.<eos> This can't happen.<eos> Well, it's got to happen.<eos> Now, look, I know you think you got this whole thing on your shoulders, but you've been locked up.<eos> You left me in charge.<eos> Now I need you to trust me when I say I think I know there's a better way.<eos> He needs water!<eos> Take off his backpack.<eos> Grab his gear.<eos> Split it between you.
Taken a picture of us in the car and put it in a pink frame with puffy paint around it that says "best fiancé ever"?<eos> Doesn't sound that bad.<eos> Well, good, because...<eos> that's why I did! Aw...<eos> Oh... thank you.<eos> That-that is so sweet.<eos> No, it's not that sweet-- I paid for the frame with your money and then got a massage.<eos> You know what, you don't have to give me this. You keep it.<eos> Why?<eos> The car was a gift-- it was something you needed.

Hey, you got a sec? Hi.<eos> Sure.<eos> I was hoping we could talk about the money again.<eos> Oh, sweetie, just forget about it.<eos> No, no, no, no, hear me out. I know things got a little weird last night.<eos> Well, leaving an envelope full of cash on my dresser after sex would count as weird.<eos> Well, I think I came up with a pretty good solution. Mm.<eos> Why don't we just put the money in a joint account?<eos> It'll be our first money together.<eos> We can use it for the wedding, the honeymoon, whatever.
She made him a chore chart.<eos> I see it.<eos> "Do the dishes." There's a star right there.<eos> That was a pity star.<eos> Putting water in the roasting pan and leaving it in the sink is not doing the dishes.<eos> That pan had to soak and you know it.<eos> Well, don't come crying to me when you don't get your allowance.<eos> It's not an allowance.<eos> It's a stipend!<eos> And we said we weren't gonna call it an allowance in front of my friends.
Right here.<eos> Ah!<eos> You guys are the best.<eos> What's with the clothes?<eos> Well, with all the new stuff I bought for work, I needed to make room in my closet.<eos> I meant why are they folded?<eos> But whatever.<eos> Ooh, what's this?<eos> That, believe it or not, is my prom dress.<eos> Wow, you still have it?
18 parts per million.<eos> And he's still doing it.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I'm happy to take you to work.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> And Leonard never lets me have French toast sticks in the car.<eos> I can't have syrupy fingers, but he can do the backstroke in a toilet bowl.<eos> It's nice they're getting exercise.<eos> Although now that I think about it, Leonard would never go swimming in public without his swim shirt.<eos> I'm sure he brought it.
It's much too soon for that.<eos> Why? Do you know someone?<eos> No, but if things don't work out with me and Leonard, I'll give you a call.<eos> Wait.<eos> How much do you talk about Star Trek?<eos> Okay, let's get this Victorian party started.<eos> I've done some research about some traditional parlor games we can play.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, there's a fun one called Ball of Wool.<eos> You take a ball of wool, and you put it right in the center of the table.
It's on the moon.<eos> You heard that part, right?<eos> - Yes!<eos> And I know that look you're giving me, Dan.<eos> And I know that smile.<eos> I've seen it when you've tried to talk some crazy bastard from jumping off of a ledge.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's, uh -- let's talk this thing through.<eos> Firstly, how do we gain access to it?
And I know that look you're giving me, Dan.<eos> And I know that smile.<eos> I've seen it when you've tried to talk some crazy bastard from jumping off of a ledge.<eos> Well, guess what.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's, uh -- let's talk this thing through.<eos> Firstly, how do we gain access to it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm pretty sure that if we do unearth it, it's gonna be a little beat-up.
And there isn't a moment that I'm not sick over what I did.<eos> Look, when I first came out of the cocoon, I was so confused.<eos> I thought I was helping Lourdes, freeing her from the pain she'd suffer when the attack came.<eos> This isn't just about her.<eos> Look around you. We were devastated by that attack!<eos> Those of us who survived hold you responsible.<eos> I am, so, please, please, let me make it up to you.<eos> What do you think you're doing?<eos> What Mason doesn't have the guts to do himself.<eos> You're gonna put that rifle down, or I'm gonna take it from you.
Yeah, I want to thank you for being the first and last I ever let tell me who I'm supposed to be.<eos> You know, it's a real shame that Lourdes was the only one among us who might have been able to find a place in her heart to forgive you.<eos> I'll hold you to your word.<eos> I want you both to come back in one piece.<eos> I'll try my best.<eos> No trying, kid.<eos> Get it done.<eos> Come here a second.<eos> I, uh...got this serum from the Volm.<eos> They carry it on them in case they get captured by the Espheni.
Why don't you ask me that question when we're on the way home?<eos> How long until we get there?<eos> One moment.<eos> This map will allow us to view the ship's course in relation to the nearest celestial bodies.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> No.<eos> That thing you're doing with your hair -- your mother does that sometimes.<eos> Um, let's go over the checklist again.<eos> The homing beacon is engaged.<eos> When we reach our destination, I'll switch it off and let the core's landing protocol draw us in.
I...know it.<eos> We don't know a damn thing, Matt.<eos> Just hang tight.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> I saw it happen at the factory.<eos> They're -- they're gonna get us and change us into these -- Stop.<eos> Matt, stop.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> The knife -- you still got it?
! Be quiet!<eos> I think you're attracting them!<eos> Sara?<eos> ! Well, you remember my name.<eos> That's something.<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> It's quite the reunion, honey!<eos> What is that thing on Dingaan?<eos> That is a...an earthworm on human growth hormone.<eos> Please... Just shoot it.
They are nice people, aren't they?<eos> I saw it right away.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Pretty young lady, lovely cutie, sweetheart, sugarpants.<eos> And Marlene likes you.<eos> He really was in the camp?<eos> Yes, but doesn't talk about it.<eos> "The angel of death."<eos> The first picture he painted after Auschwitz.<eos> Incredible, he's eligible for compensation, but he does not want it.
Wells. I'm sure he's fine.<eos> I can't breathe.<eos> - He needs oxygen.<eos> - Barry!<eos> Barry.<eos> - Cut me open.<eos> The poison's still in me.<eos> - He brought us a sample. Caitlin, we need to do a pulmonary biopsy, Extract an active portion of that gas.<eos> - I can't give you any anesthetic.<eos> Your metabolism will burn right through it.
The high road for what?<eos> To be a pro.<eos> They all studied there:<eos> the Tsonga, Simon, Gasquet...<eos> - Do you like that program?<eos> - Well, yes!<eos> It means sleeping there, playing tennis every day.<eos> That's what I want to do.<eos> We have a problem with the treadmill.<eos> - Did you reset it?
Please tell me there's something else you can do.<eos> I just solved the speed differential problem.<eos> Happy, I need you to get me into a Ferrari 458.<eos> Force the gas cap open.<eos> There's an engine cover emergency release. - All right.<eos> - Left hand side of the engine bay.<eos> Pull out the ECM chip.<eos> Can you get that plane about eight feet off the ground? - Eight feet?<eos> What for?<eos> - Can't risk missing the wireless signal again, so we're gonna have to hardwire it
Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Come on!<eos> You got to reach it!<eos> I can't reach it!<eos> Come on, reach for it. Just try!<eos> Okay.<eos> Drop the cable!<eos> Drop it now!
I can translate him for you.<eos> You translate the world for us.<eos> It's, um... salary... plus benefits.<eos> You're worried about not being able to connect with Ralph.<eos> That is a second chance.<eos> For you, too.<eos> With you and Cabe.<eos> When I was 16, Cabe asked me to develop tracking software to drop military aid packages.<eos> So months later, I, uh, I turned on the TV, and I saw bombs falling on Baghdad.<eos> They were using my system, and I designed it for speed over accuracy.
Matt. Vera?<eos> Not your mum, is it?<eos> Sorry, Marge.<eos> Are you feeling all right?<eos> It's my veins.<eos> Bloody hell, they go and then they bleed and bleed.<eos> I die every time. They gave me a little pill.<eos> It's a miracle pill!<eos> It stops the blood.<eos> Makes it thicker.
Yeah. And we had planned to keep it that way.<eos> What value was the WMD to you?<eos> Insurance, leverage.<eos> - A means to check power.<eos> Isn't that what you wanted?<eos> War means profit.<eos> Chaos means profit. But it wasn't just about the money.<eos> Then what?<eos> This country's falling apart, Martin.<eos> Who's gonna save it?
Alert Crystal and Rice.<eos> It says Director Bennett's been shot.<eos> - What?<eos> - A sniper shot him through the window.<eos> Put the gun down, Martin.<eos> I didn't fire it. Then who did?<eos> Shaw was here.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> Your phone got turned on.<eos> We traced it.
You look worried, fellas.<eos> Welcome back, Dean.<eos> Hey.<eos> How's he doing?<eos> He's still a little out of it. But better, I think.<eos> I mean, I think this whole thing, the blood cure and the- - All of it.<eos> -Really wrecked him, you know?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> On the plus side, he's hungry again.<eos> So I'm just gonna go pick him up a big old bag of crap food and stuff it in his face myself.
Harvey might forgive you because you returned those recordings, but I don't.<eos> - Donna.<eos> - Not done.<eos> What Harvey did with Gillis, it was harsh, but using what I told you in a private conversation-- that crosses a line that even Harvey never would.<eos> - Donna.<eos> - Still not done.<eos> When you left our firm, you left me too, but I honestly thought that we'd always be friends.<eos> Now I'm not so sure.<eos> Amy, did you send Donna the package?<eos> Guilt gift. Didn't open it.
I don't want to talk about it;<eos> Nothing is wrong.<eos> Well, obviously something's wrong.<eos> You know what, if you're so curious, why don't you just go ask the man of your dreams? I'm sure the two of you will have a big laugh about it later.<eos> Okay, I don't know what you're talking about, but seeing you like this, there's no way that I would laugh at you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Mike convinced me that Sheila was engaged to throw me off my game.<eos> I'm so sorry, Louis.<eos> Yeah, well, he sure wasn't.<eos> Stuck a knife in me, twisted it with the thought of her and another man.
Which makes it hearsay, and I don't give a shit.<eos> Well, I do, 'cause it opens me up to slander at best and perjury charges at worst.<eos> Well, Jeff, you used that story to get your ass in here.<eos> Now use it to get the job done.<eos> Amy!<eos> I thought I asked you to leave the Gianopolous proposal on my desk.<eos> And I did, 20 minutes ago.<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you proof it?
Amy!<eos> I thought I asked you to leave the Gianopolous proposal on my desk.<eos> And I did, 20 minutes ago.<eos> What?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you proof it?<eos> No.<eos> I thought you'd have a better chance if the document was riddled with typos.<eos> - This is important.<eos> - I know it is, which is why I read it backwards and forwards.
You used the woman I love to extend your goddamn T.R.O.<eos> You knew how I felt about her, and you did it anyway.<eos> I will never, ever forget it until the day I die.<eos> Good luck beating Harvey without money.<eos> I have good news.<eos> James Dolan died and left me the Knicks?<eos> Louis stopped Mike from getting Gianopolous.<eos> He blocked his funding.<eos> Good.<eos> You went to Louis with a problem, he fixed it, and all you're gonna say is "good"?

What the hell?<eos> Have you seen a native guy with long hair? !<eos> Get off of me!<eos> [Breathing heavily] Has anyone seen an Indian with long hair?<eos> ! Hey, hey!<eos> What's happening?<eos> ! Did you see Darius?<eos> No.<eos> David Ridges... he was here!<eos> This girl, she... she took my picture, sent it to my phone!
- Well, why do you want to do that?<eos> Just go, okay?<eos> Let me do this.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Yeah. And I'll always remember you.<eos> Fine.<eos> Yeah, great. 'Cause I was just going to do this.<eos> No driver required.<eos> And I really like that hairband.<eos> But I suppose I'll just take it, will I?

Each body is encased in a support exoskeleton.<eos> 'An invisible exoskeleton?<eos> ' 'It's only invisible in the water.<eos> There's a specially engineered 'refraction index in the fluid so we can see the tank resident 'unimpeded by the support mechanisms.'<eos> 'So each skeleton is inside something? '<eos> ~ Are you serious?<eos> X-ray water?<eos> ~ It's so cool.<eos> Look at this.<eos> We call it dark water.
Hey!<eos> Probably best not, eh?<eos> Doesn't speak much.<eos> Why would he want to see me?<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> Sounds like somebody left their body to science.<eos> OK.<eos> Um... It's probably time to explain why you're always feeling cold...<eos> White noise off the telly.<eos> We've all heard it.
Of course!<eos> The Earth's darkest hour and mine.<eos> Where else would you be?<eos> (Thank you.)<eos> 'Clara...<eos> Danny?<eos> Danny?<eos> Is that you?<eos> Please say it's you.<eos> ~ 'Clara...' ~ The Doctor told me about the bracelet, how it can let Missy travel from one world to the other.
It has a chewed-up tape in it.<eos> I'll say it was broken and they'll buy it.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't need your confession.<eos> It won't change anything.<eos> It would've been easier if you were a gang<eos> I wouldn't have to explain all this, cuz you'd already know about me.<eos> I'll write it.<eos> I can't do it after I'm beat up.<eos> Let me do it now.
Since when?<eos> Why...<eos> Why did you come to me?<eos> I love you.<eos> It's a couple ring.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> I didn't think you'd really show up.<eos> - Put the money in my car.<eos> - No.<eos> I deposited it to your account.
What if I'm not even good?<eos> I was pretty damn good, Louis.<eos> I was.<eos> But I knew the odds of somebody making it were close to zero no matter how good they were.<eos> My father lost our money when I was 13, and I-I found out what it was like to struggle, so instead of pursuing my dream,<eos> And that let me pretend that maybe I was good enough to make it.<eos> But what if I wasn't?<eos> Mm-mm, all right, look, I'm gonna tell you something about myself that I never told anyone.<eos> I have stage fright.<eos> Got it when I was in third grade.
You guys meet at the hospital.<eos> Then you have dinner for two hours where you cancel a private stock sale that you both arranged, and one hour ago, that stock mysteriously gets bought by some shell corporation set up last year.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> Here's my favorite part, where you feign outrage and you feign ignorance to help sell the whole story.<eos> Anyway, I just wanted to give you a little heads-up.<eos> Smile for the cameras.<eos> Harvey.<eos> - You gave me your word.<eos> - And I kept it.
I know why you're here. But Eddie's not.<eos> Yesterday was his last day.<eos> He didn't mention that.<eos> Did he get another job?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Did he leave a forwarding number? Anyway to contact him?<eos> Are you here to finger-paint or speed-date the orderlies?<eos> I suggest you stick to the day room.<eos> You looked for something?<eos> I-- I couldn't find you and I just wanted to take another peek at your sketchbook and then just put it right back.

Have a good night.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, you made it.<eos> Yeah, sorry, I'm late.<eos> Your mom had to cancel.<eos> Lucky me.<eos> They're talking.<eos> Talking is good.<eos> What can he say to Toby that he can't say to me?<eos> Sometimes people want to tell you things, but they just can't look you in the eye and say it. Why not?
I wonder what she promised him to get him to confess.<eos> You seem pretty sure that that's what happened. All makes sense.<eos> At least the way Ali thinks.<eos> She has an amazing gift for knowing just what a person wants, what they're missing.<eos> It's a very special talent, one that causes a lot of damage.<eos> She's been gone a long time.<eos> I'll go check on her.<eos> Mona?<eos> You are very good.<eos> You know right where to put the knife and you're not afraid to twist it.
I'll be right back.<eos> Have you ever been so focused on something That it takes over everything else?<eos> Turns you into someone that you're not?<eos> I took all of my ali-anger out on you guys and... I'm sorry for that.<eos> Han.<eos> I'm waiting for the cookies.<eos> Did you figure out what you're gonna do With your sister's going-away present?<eos> Melissa sent me that video Because she wanted me to know the truth.<eos> Her confession doesn't actually help any of us.<eos> She said it out loud.
She's had a little work done.<eos> Trubel, you want some breakfast?<eos> It's almost ready.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I smelled it.<eos> Bacon, that's all I want.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Well, my neck hurts, but I haven't slept that good in a long time.<eos> Hey, can I borrow your bike?<eos> - Just take it.
You try not going crazy.<eos> She was listening to you.<eos> She was listening to the ranting and raving of a lunatic.<eos> A former lunatic.<eos> I'm much healthier now.<eos> I had nothing to do with this.<eos> If she was following your lead on this, then how do we know there isn't more?<eos> Stealing my own money?<eos> Really?<eos> You were going to use it anyway.
He's going into a church. What's he gonna do?<eos> Did you find it?<eos> Nobody's heard anything about a video of the murder.<eos> I think it might just be a rumour.<eos> Not interested in your opinion.<eos> Just find the fucking video.<eos> Okay, I'll check Stalkerazzi again.<eos> How's Bridget doing?<eos> She's all right.<eos> All you need to do is sign it over.
You tell me.<eos> A hundred grand.<eos> For that much, it'd better stick.<eos> I'm talking felony, 20 years.<eos> Do it.<eos> Ray.<eos> I was getting ready to call you.<eos> Sure you were.<eos> Where's the video, Marty?<eos> I'm getting it, but...
I tell you, it's a miracle drug.<eos> It stops the blood.<eos> Makes it thicker.
You cunt.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out.<eos> All of ya.<eos> It's alright.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Get out!<eos> Why?<eos> It was the pink stuff.<eos> I couldn't stand watching you sell it, and I couldn't stand watching someone else die.
Well, he should be back soon.<eos> You're welcome to wait.<eos> I don't want to get in the way.<eos> Oh, wow.<eos> This place is huge.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna call Alvey and see where he's at.<eos> ... go to to begin with.<eos> I haven't had one single drink, and immediately some dude spills a drink on my boyfriend, Josh.<eos> So then Josh grabs my water, and he throws it in the guy's face.
And I-I don't have that kind of money.<eos> - You're just a simple Deacon.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> But what I'm thinking is, if I can find these people, I am sure they're gonna want to make a donation.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Help me...<eos> Help Hinoki.<eos> Jennifer, please.<eos> All right, that's just enough bullshit to make me smile today.<eos> But fill out the form so I can put it on file.
I found the backpack.<eos> The one that's packed like you're ready to run away.<eos> I can't do that again.<eos> I can't come home one day and find out that you're gone.<eos> Please, give me a chance.<eos> How was that, Elizabeth?<eos> Not so bad. I've always been able to talk to Carter when she wasn't there.<eos> If we want her to come to therapy, we can't get mad at her for not coming to therapy.<eos> I wasn't going to.<eos> Morning, sunshine. Did you borrow my car or just steal it?
This letter makes me proud.<eos> To tell the truth, I love him very much.<eos> Come to dinner the day after next.<eos> You won't refuse to countersign my will.<eos> It will be ready.<eos> You are welcome to come.<eos> Gentlemen, in two days, then.<eos> - Did you bring the money?<eos> - No, Madam...<eos> If you need it, I'll stop by tomorrow.
If you push me, I'll go too far.<eos> Here is your money.<eos> I'm so appreciative, my friend.<eos> Do you know that I owe you exactly this sum?<eos> Well, your money...<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Oh, a woman's heart...<eos> You owe me!<eos> Perfect.<eos> One day, you'll give it to me, but for now,
Eat his heart out.<eos> Kate.<eos> -You don't have to do this.<eos> -No one's talking to you, Paul Bunyan.<eos> So?<eos> No.<eos> Take them.<eos> Have some fun.<eos> Oh, and I want a heart to go.<eos> Put it in a doggie bag.
- You know, that science thing...?<eos> You're interested in science?<eos> So am I!<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Nice one, Dylan.<eos> Personally, I'm far more interested in the natural sciences.<eos> Much more fascinating than mathematical theories, don't you think?<eos> - Um... yeah...<eos> - Have you seen that double rainbow video?<eos> I've seen it, like, 200 times.
Cochise?<eos> Perimeter patrols around the clock, four-hour shifts.<eos> We'll be back in 48 hours...<eos> - What's going on?<eos> I thought I heard something, some kind of animal.<eos> Cougar or bobcat wouldn't be unheard of in this part of the country.<eos> Colonel Weaver is displaying somewhat erratic behavior.<eos> I know.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He'll come through it.
Lexi has been meeting with an Espheni.<eos> Ben followed her and saw them together.<eos> We confronted her, she said she'd brokered a truce. That that's how they stayed off the radar.<eos> I could feel it!<eos> Do they all know, Lourdes and the rest of them?<eos> They all think she's some kind of messiah who can do no wrong.<eos> - Son of a bitch! I'm gonna find that piece of...<eos> - That's what I'm saying.<eos> It's about time we kicked a little ass around here.<eos> I say we hunt it down and blow its brains out.
"An ink splash with dots around it.<eos> "Yes.<eos> Is that it?"<eos> "No, hang on, Charlie.<eos> "Do you see an image?<eos> "Hidden in the ink blot?<eos> "Other people do.<eos> Don't you?"<eos> "No.<eos> "If there's an image, I'll see it.
Maybe I'll just take one book.<eos> Maybe just Robinson Crusoe.<eos> Yes...<eos> Yes, one book will be fine.<eos> I'll leave...<eos> I'll leave my exercise book too.<eos> I don't want to write in it.<eos> I can't write well anymore.<eos> Nothing comes into my head.<eos> I'll give it to Professor Strauss.
She's home.<eos> It's a Jewish custom.<eos> I know she wasn't, but it feels right.<eos> Laurel.<eos> No, this isn't right.<eos> This isn't--<eos> It--she doesn't even get a fresh grave?<eos> It's so perverse.<eos> She deserves a proper burial.<eos> She's earned it.
Oh, mate, of course you've got a choice.<eos> You make a false accusation, you open yourself up to a whole world of pain you don't need.<eos> But he's just a screw.<eos> What does it matter?<eos> No, Will Jackson is one of the few decent screws in here.<eos> Why not say it was Mr Fletcher?<eos> I mean, I could half believe that.<eos> Liz, I wouldn't do it with any screw.<eos> Of course you wouldn't, and that's why you've gotta stick to your guns.<eos> She's gonna take my baby or worse, she'll kill it.
My voice, it made an avalanche ?<eos> _<eos> Listen, I had no idea she was married when I first met her.<eos> I mean, how would I have known?<eos> She never mentioned it.<eos> She seemed like the loneliest girl in the world.<eos> I just thought she was bad news.<eos> So, after that first night I went out of my way to avoid her.<eos> I had my second book on my mind.<eos> I was under a lot of pressure to get it done, make it good.

See, now I don't think that's true.<eos> What's the game?<eos> It doesn't look like Egyptian Ratscrew.<eos> Hold 'Em.<eos> Local delicacy.<eos> Betting structure's like a chain reaction.<eos> It's a dangerous game for a guy who doesn't know when to quit.<eos> Teach me.<eos> About five minutes later, Frank comes out of his office with the pig and Meeks and I are barely keeping it together.<eos> He puts it on Crosley's desk and says, dead serious,
Previously on Manhattan...<eos> I gave you the velocity distribution problem because I think you're the only man here who's capable of solving it.
They'll think it's a drill.<eos> All right, then go floor to floor.<eos> - But just keep an eye on time, okay? - Uh-huh.<eos> Cabe, you gotta get that drive to the DOJ.<eos> If this place goes up, it's the last existing version of the file.<eos> - Sylvester, make sure he knows how to open it.<eos> - Happily.<eos> You're gonna need this to get into the DOJ.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> You dropped it.
- If it were 1840,<eos> - we could drop it down a well.<eos> - What about the roof?<eos> No time.<eos> Wait!<eos> Janitor supplies.<eos> Joint compound.<eos> This bomb's gonna blow, but we can lessen the impact.<eos> If this, uh, janitor likes his grub salty, we might be able to mute the bomb.<eos> Salt speeds up the hardening process, - but you gotta mix it in thoroughly. - Ah!
You could've left him in the building, you know.<eos> I'd be tempted.<eos> Can you get anything from your computer?<eos> No, it's ruined.<eos> Blast destroyed and shredded the hard drive.<eos> Thumb drive is dust.<eos> So he erased all the evidence that could tie Keeler to these bombings.<eos> He might be in custody now, but he'll be gone by morning.<eos> What if someone knew that on December 17<eos> Keeler and the U.S. Secretary of Defense had a meeting about illegal drone strikes in Pakistan and Keeler recorded it to use as blackmail?
The army will be looking for someone to blame.<eos> Without proof, they can't hold me.<eos> Still, I'd feel better if you made yourself scarce.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Stand aside, and move this bench.<eos> All right, soldier.<eos> When the Germans surrendered, I thought I'd participated in my last amputation, but it seemed as though I was condemned to dream about yet more young men maimed for life on the battlefield.<eos> This arm's going to have to come off.<eos> You can have the loan of my short sword if it helps.<eos> Sharpened it myself yesterday.
- Hey, Scotty, you got the keys?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - All right, let's wrap it up.<eos> Cole, we need to dump this shit, throw it in the ocean.<eos> Why don't you go back to the ranch?<eos> Find someplace on the edge of the property...<eos> Someplace discreet. Make sure nobody's watching.<eos> Dig a hole. I'll bring the chest.<eos> - You take Hal.<eos> - I'm telling you, man- if you bury this shit, someone's gonna find it.
She's gone, Trick. Who's next?<eos> I mean, that's what being The One is, right?<eos> The Queen, marching forward, never looking back.<eos> It's only a matter of time before I lose all of you.<eos> I will always be alone.<eos> We share the same blood.<eos> Wherever you go, I go.<eos> You will never be alone.<eos> Bo, you stole my heart.<eos> I'm never gonna ask for it back. You will never be alone.

Oh, what did you hear from the rug-restoration guys?<eos> - Uh-oh. - It was deemed "beyond repair."<eos> - No.<eos> - Those entitled twits didn't just damage it, they held a perfect beauty in their home, and then they ignored her, tortured her, and finally murdered her.<eos> They aren't the rosewills.<eos> They're the mansons.<eos> The mansons of antique rugs.<eos> - Oh. - It's heartbreaking.<eos> - [Grunts] - We should plot our revenge on the house of rosewill.<eos> We can replace it with polyester shag, faux leopard.
I'm gonna kick both your heads in.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> - Race you to the car?<eos> - Yeah, let's race.<eos> [Indistinct chatter] - [Yells] - Go, go, go, go, go.<eos> Go.<eos> - Bye!<eos> - Good to meet you. - [Shouts]<eos> - You were absolutely right about ray.<eos> I showed him the demilune sideboard with the tambour door, and he loved it.

- It was on the bonham list.<eos> Where's their book?<eos> - It's in my study.<eos> I'll get it in a minute.<eos> - Oh, I'll grab it.<eos> Which one's the study?<eos> - The door on the right.<eos> Don't go digging around up there--the place is a mess.<eos> - Yeah, I'm calling hoarders.<eos> - You find it?
It's a miracle pill.<eos> It stops the blood.<eos> Makes it thicker.
Just drive, son.<eos> He's here again, Ray.<eos> That creep who's stalking me.<eos> He's the bad guy, Ray. Not me.<eos> He hits her.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> I was in the car, and Daddy made me lie to the police.<eos> I just got a call.<eos> Somebody's got a video of the Re-Kon shootings.<eos> Did you get it?

When am I gonna see it?
Bet you he strangled her, just like the other two.<eos> Can you go?<eos> Please.<eos> Hold up, Ray.<eos> It's a birthday party, Ray.<eos> Baby, wave to Mommy and Daddy.<eos> You better smile, boy.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I'll bring it later.

These little motherfuckers, they like to party hard.<eos> All right.<eos> Pop, come on, let's just go.<eos> I don't think he's here.<eos> One more minute.<eos> There he is.<eos> What are you doing here, Mick?<eos> I want my fucking money.<eos> What money?<eos> When we met, you offered me 500 thou to blow town. Now I want it.
This wonderful stew.<eos> Get in the fucking trunk, Steve.<eos> I trust you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're the same, aren't we?<eos> I knew it the minute I met you.<eos> Give me your phone.<eos> Tell the truth this time.<eos> Back in the womb.<eos> I love it.
Could I get some help, here?<eos> Sorry. It's this new show.<eos> How could you keep my daughter a secret all these years?<eos> I wrote you 16 months ago!<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Babe... what are you doing here?<eos> Trying to be brave.<eos> But before I propose... you need to know all the facts.<eos> And the fact is, I'm having the baby.<eos> And we're giving it to the father.

You never met me. You never fixed my car.<eos> What's that worth?<eos> How about 10 grand?<eos> Will that do it?<eos> No, but 20 will.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll get you the cash tomorrow. Oh, come on, man.<eos> Give me a break.<eos> You know, you got to give me the cash today.<eos> I'll wire it to you right now.
I don't know what to say.<eos> Why don't you know what to say?<eos> You've had four fucking months to figure it out.<eos> Why come back here if you don't know what to say?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot fucking believe you.<eos> You didn't come back to talk to me at all, did you?<eos> It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?
Why come back here if you don't know what to say?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I cannot fucking believe you.<eos> You didn't come back to talk to me at all, did you?<eos> It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, you love this place.<eos> You should have it.
It's almost summer.<eos> You came back to sell the fucking house.<eos> Wait, what if I sold it to you?<eos> - What?<eos> - Look, you love this place.<eos> You should have it.<eos> Make me an offer.<eos> I'm broke, Ali.<eos> You know that.<eos> Well, then I'll give it to you.
I'm sorry.<eos> How long are they keeping you?<eos> Just overnight in case of concussion.<eos> - If he ever touches you again... - Please.<eos> It's been a rough night.<eos> Okay?<eos> How you doing, David?<eos> Okay.<eos> What happened to your wrist?<eos> He sprained it when he fell.
Anne!<eos> Anne!<eos> No, no, no, no!<eos> Wait! We have to get her out of there!<eos> We will!<eos> But not until we figure out what this is and what it's doing to her.<eos> I don't care what it's doing!<eos> You have to care.<eos> What if it's like Ben and the harness?<eos> You don't think I wanted to rip that thing off his back the second I saw it?
Yeah.<eos> Listen, Tom, I may be way out of line here.<eos> But right now, you are way too emotional to make this shot.<eos> You're right.<eos> You're out of line.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, I got to tear this whole thing down.<eos> You know what?<eos> There was a can of oil in the closet downstairs where I got them tools.<eos> I'll get it.
We're auditing Thin Man's files to find out.<eos> There are some irregularities.<eos> - In Akley's files?<eos> - In yours, actually.<eos> The calculations you've been assigning your staff, it's almost as if they have no bearing on Thin Man whatsoever.<eos> They may look irregular to an untrained eye.<eos> But your former colleague, Dr. Lancefield, he's trained, isn't he?<eos> - Tom Lancefield?<eos> - He told me a fascinating story.<eos> Said you'd hotwired the project and were driving it over a cliff.
Well, let's bring him down here so he can confirm your story.<eos> I would never disclose military secrets.<eos> Prove it.<eos> No.<eos> No, I can't. I can't prove it.<eos> I can't prove that I'm not the Tooth Fairy either.<eos> You can't prove a negative.<eos> You scientists do it all the time.<eos> What do you call it? A null hypothesis?<eos> If you can't prove your theory is valid, you examine the opposite theory and try to refute it.
You deserve to be happy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Glen, if there's anything I could do...<eos> Twenty years ago, I thought I was a pretty good physicist, then you walked into my office.<eos> Goddamn college sophomore.<eos> I didn't know what was missing from my work until I saw it in yours.<eos> This project needs you a lot more than it needs me.<eos> I need you.<eos> Honestly, I'm relieved.<eos> I suppose somebody has to build it, but I'm glad it's not gonna be on my tombstone.
High hopes.<eos> You sure you don't want to stay for dinner?<eos> Oh, honey, I would love to. Unfortunately, I have a board meeting in about an hour.<eos> Mm, well, if you change your mind once you get there, my schedule is free.<eos> All evening.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You are so bad for me.<eos> You didn't tell me you lost your phone.<eos> It was just a crazy week.<eos> And I'm gonna get it back.
I'm gonna start meditating.<eos> Okay.<eos> And call Stan.<eos> This is Neil.<eos> You know, for a family-sized car, this thing rides pretty nice.<eos> Who is this?<eos> All I wanted was my phone back with all my contacts, and you still had to go and call the IRS.<eos> You're calling me from my car?<eos> You wanna steal my life, I'm gonna steal yours.<eos> And I wouldn't report it stolen either, or my next move is to go just a little more public about your moonlighting experience,
- Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'm proud of her.<eos> How's your... How's your project going?<eos> Oh, finished.<eos> You want to have a look?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Hey, you guys.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Totally cool. You made it.
The device... call her.<eos> Emma, are you in there?<eos> I'm getting her out.<eos> What if we lift?<eos> Don't!<eos> We're not giving up.<eos> We won't, but this is not getting us anywhere.<eos> Well, I'm open to suggestions.<eos> Magic made this thing.<eos> I think we're gonna need magic to unmake it.
I know.<eos> Emma?<eos> Emma?<eos> It appears our honeymoon is over.<eos> Yeah, there's an emergency.<eos> Emma's trapped under ice by a woman with some kind of ice magic.<eos> And this involves me because?<eos> You're the bloody dark one.<eos> Do something.<eos> Well, I could melt the ice and destroy it with a thought, but that would also destroy your girlfriend.
No more beatdowns.<eos> I need you to call Connor.<eos> Tell him you got away from the Kings, you found a way out.<eos> He knows Roarke grabbed me.<eos> - He's not gonna walk into a trap.<eos> - He'll show up.<eos> And why would he do that?<eos> Mother of Christ!<eos> Because you're gonna send him a picture of them.<eos> Set it up.
Defenders of capitalism are relics.<eos> Still here. I'll be damned.<eos> Moonshine.<eos> No. It's homemade.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Kaffeklubben island. That's where we ended up. It's just off Greenland.<eos> Right.<eos> Do you know what I found on that most remote parcel of Terra Firma on my quest for tranquility?<eos> Plastic? Bottles, bags, toys, containers,<eos> I mean, there's an island of it in the middle of the ocean.
We should take some blood.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna get to the bottom of this.<eos> Thanks.<eos> This was so not the plan for our real baby.<eos> Real baby?<eos> Our first baby was Khaki, the magazine.<eos> For the modern multicultural couple.<eos> Yes, I've seen that.<eos> Greg and I birthed it, raised it, then let it go to Conde Nast in a bidding war.
Just warn me before you do a backflip over the mad hatter.<eos> I could do that, you know.<eos> Yeah, I know you could.<eos> This is where it happened.<eos> They were repairing the walkway, and my friend and I thought that the wet gooey cement was like our moms' makeup.<eos> My eyes started burning.<eos> The white rabbit's ears sticking up was the last thing I saw.<eos> Well, his ears still stick up.<eos> And his coattail blows out behind.<eos> It certainly does.
I'm sorry, it's cash only.<eos> Cash only?<eos> Uh, why have such a policy?<eos> I'm just a volunteer.<eos> I have cash.<eos> It's just that I find paper currency cumbersome, and of course, there are the known sanitary issues, but still, I feel embarrassed.<eos> Please.<eos> My treat.<eos> Thank you, but I will repay you.<eos> Only if you get it in pesos.
I'm afraid not, but I think I know the cause of your liver problems along with all the symptoms you've been experiencing.<eos> You have too much copper in your blood.<eos> I'm taking you to the hospital.<eos> The penicillamine acts as a chelating agent to remove the excess copper from your system.<eos> So each time I used mama's old pots, I was poisoning my liver?<eos> Thank God Greg doesn't drink tea.<eos> Yes, he wasn't exposed to as much copper as you.<eos> Too much copper can also replace zinc and block estrogen receptors.<eos> Which would prevent me from getting pregnant.<eos> Yes. Once you remove it, you will vastly improve your odds.
Someone I really thought I could help befriend.<eos> But they died.<eos> - Barry, I'm really sorry.<eos> - I didn't know her that well. But it still hurts.<eos> And as bad as I feel right now, I know how much worse it is to lose someone who's family.<eos> Iris... Writing about this stuff, putting your name out there,<eos> It's dangerous. So I'm asking you one last time, please, stop.<eos> - And I am asking you one last time To tell me what is really going on with you.<eos> Why am I the only one of us who's interested in this?<eos> - I guess, just, all this stuff with my family, I finally just put it behind me.
Four of the perps are locked up, - thus leaving six.<eos> - Guillermo Flacos?<eos> This is way too subtle for a Mexican drug lord.<eos> Oh, announcing your intent via e-mail?<eos> That's too subtle?<eos> Personally, I would keep digging. Any on the list have computer proficiency and a knowledge of biophysics?<eos> Well, that'll probably narrow our list down to zero, but we'll keep digging.<eos> What I want to understand is how you hack into a human being.<eos> I get your DNA from anywhere...<eos> a coffee cup, a piece of gum... and then I study your genetics for a deficiency... say, uh, lung disease... and then I harness that genetic sequence onto a cold virus and I blow it in your face.
Left all the SMA sufferers out in the cold.<eos> I spent months fielding their angry phone calls.<eos> I hated the job.<eos> But how it this related to Helena?<eos> We think that whoever attacked Helena and these other children must be someone who suffered from SMA.<eos> And they're trying to make us suffer, too? What kind of mind thinks this way?<eos> Well, the kind that sends taunting e-mails alongside his deadly disease.<eos> So, someone in enough psychological pain to not care about how stupid that is from a criminal standpoint.<eos> Okay, is this headed towards ransom?<eos> More likely, like his experience with Trexicane, he's saying there is a cure out there, you just can't have it.
If I brought that home, he might try and shoot it, and after he saw the price tag, he'd shoot me.<eos> I know it's hard for you to imagine, Grace, but you may not always live with the same man, either.<eos> Life is full of surprises.<eos> Mimosa?<eos> Oh, I shouldn't. Oh, God.<eos> Honestly, it's just exhausting, watching you be the good girl all the time.<eos> You are entitled to let go, you know.<eos> I let go.<eos> I mean, you saw the photo I did.<eos> What'd your husband say when he saw it? I'm curious.

And I can't even break up with him.<eos> Who's the new guy?<eos> Fuck you, Ray.<eos> Your shake, Marty.<eos> Thank you, Troy.<eos> You need me to stay?<eos> No.<eos> You heard anything about a video of the Re-Kon-Marvin Gaye murder?<eos> What if I have?<eos> I need it.
I need it.<eos> That would be evidence in a criminal investigation, Ray.<eos> I'd have to turn that over to the police.<eos> Cut the crap.<eos> How much, Marty?<eos> Footage like that would be worth millions.<eos> Find it.<eos> And you have the money?<eos> I have a client who does.<eos> If I find it, I want a million dollars.
We get jobs.<eos> No, no. That's not who I am.<eos> I have to own something.<eos> I'm a business owner.<eos> I know you are, Terry.<eos> But we have to start somewhere.<eos> I'm not taking your money.<eos> Well, that's fucking ridiculous.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I'm still not taking it.
What did he do?<eos> He was supposed to take me to a baseball game.<eos> Never showed up.<eos> Come on, Ray.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I know that Sean Walker killed that girl, and that you framed him for it.<eos> Why?<eos> All right, fuck it.<eos> My father was Sean's dealer.<eos> Sean got high. Mickey let him play with his gun. Fucking idiot thought it was a toy, fired it, that was the end of Colleen.
It's all in your head.<eos> Hey sis, Bea wants to...<eos> Hey Toni, it's Bea.<eos> Yeah, I was just wondering if you had that present for me yet.<eos> No, what do you mean? It has to be today.<eos> I mean, you never said anything about going away.<eos> Shit. Hey, listen.<eos> What you're going to do is you're going to go to Standstead House.<eos> Do you know it? Yeah, good.<eos> And I want you to give it to Liz.
We've got blood tests that can look at the effect of the heart.<eos> But, even more than that, we're looking for the changes that might occur in the liver and its production of fat.<eos> I'd like to go to 1932, please.<eos> Done.<eos> Coming.<eos> Let's just see how tall you are.<eos> So you've got a really normal, healthy blood pressure... 121 over 79.<eos> Your heart rate's pretty good at 75, so that's pretty good.<eos> Alrighty, so, we'll just have a listen to your heart, see what it sounds like.<eos> You know what it's saying, Damon.

That's exactly what I heard it saying.
They will then show me images of this high-sugar, low-fat milkshake and then feed me the milkshake through a special megastraw.<eos> Then they'll take some photos of my brain and show me how it reacted.<eos> Now I'm gonna climb into my own brain and see what effects sugar just had on it.<eos> Now, the first step is that we see what's called a cue, or a trigger... which, in my case, was the milkshake.<eos> It can be a picture of one or the real thing.<eos> Now, when we see this sugary cue, or trigger, a chemical called dopamine is released in our brain.<eos> This is an evolutionary urge when sweetness was rare, so when we saw it, our brain said, "Get that,<eos> "'cause you need it for quick energy and to feel good."<eos> Now, the next step is that we get the sugary item.<eos> We bring it to our mouth and we taste its sweetness.
Yeah. In truth, it did take a while for my palate to readjust to my lady's unsweetened cooking.<eos> Things tasted bland for the first few weeks, but then I rediscovered the full flavours of fresh produce. Mmm.<eos> For just five days, I want you to discontinue, or take out of your diet, for five days, these foods that I'm gonna show you, and I promise you that you will feel 100% better.<eos> Will you please try this for me, just as an experiment?<eos> 'Cause I'm here trying to help you help yourself a little bit.<eos> In the USA, it was recently recommended for men to have no more than nine teaspoons of sugar a day and women no more than six.<eos> Australia currently doesn't have an equivalent recommendation.<eos> I love chocolate.<eos> I eat a little piece of chocolate every day.<eos> But I'm careful and I understand the adverse effects if I have too much of it.
Ian believes The Network are running again. The person he killed he thought was with them.<eos> Look, I've tried everywhere else.<eos> I thought there was a remote chance he'd come to you.<eos> No, no, no, he's not been here.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> It's just I'm getting rather desperate.<eos> Well, that's it, really.<eos> I'll be off, leave you to it.<eos> Actually, could I have some water?<eos> - I'll get it.
Get down, brother!<eos> Nice driving.<eos> Hey!<eos> Monkey!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> That's Lin's?<eos> He asked you a question.<eos> Yes!<eos> Triads trade their weapons for heroin.<eos> Take it.
Take all the guns.<eos> You should call Barosky.<eos> Tell him we need some storage for the hardware.<eos> The docks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Somewhere his guys can keep an eye on it.<eos> What about the smack?<eos> We weren't expecting the drugs.<eos> We'll store it with the guns for now;<eos> I got a couple ideas who might want it.
Previously on Suits...<eos> You really know him.<eos> I really do.<eos> - Never.<eos> - No.<eos> Why not?<eos> Because you can never go back.<eos> Forstman's insisting that I run the money through Switzerland and the Caymans before it comes out on the other side.<eos> You're obligated to report it.
Honda, Toyota, Kia.<eos> Kia's Korean.<eos> Yeah, but they're in the same time zone.<eos> Where it is currently dinner.<eos> I'm a tired of this inquisition.<eos> This is exactly why I don't come in this early.<eos> And the reason that you're here this early this morning is because it's Mike Ross' first day back.<eos> Is it?<eos> Louis, why are you here so early?<eos> I am taking this Forstman document, and I am burying it in the bowels of these files.
I better get going.<eos> I have to look up the word "innuendo," if you know what I mean.<eos> Harvey, I'm telling you, that man is not going to stop coming.<eos> I'm going to suggest something radical here.<eos> And what is that?<eos> We could just give him what he wants.<eos> The fact is we've got nothing to hide.<eos> Harvey, I don't care that we have nothing to hide.<eos> A police officer follows a car long enough, he's gonna find a busted taillight.<eos> And even if he doesn't, he's gonna bust it himself.
Good.<eos> Then figure out a way to keep Cahill from getting his hands on our documents, and do it fast because we don't have much time.<eos> Harvey, have you considered the fact that he's been going after us for collusion, and we didn't collude?<eos> What are you getting at?<eos> Why don't we just give him all the files?<eos> We have nothing to hide, and fighting him makes it look like we do.<eos> That's what I said to Jessica.<eos> You know what she said to me?<eos> "A cop follows a car long enough, "he's gonna find a busted taillight.<eos> And even if he doesn't, he's gonna bust it himself."
- Katrina, enough.<eos> You did good work, but the truth is, if we have to turn over those files, they find that transaction. I'm gonna end up in prison.<eos> Then you and I better figure out a way to make sure Harvey wins that motion.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't you have a funny way of giving someone space.<eos> What?<eos> Not only did you do exactly what we talked about not doing but you lied, and you used Harvey's name to do it.<eos> - I am sorry.<eos> - No, sorry's not good enough.<eos> This is the second time we've had this conversation recently, and I want to know why the hell we're having it again.
Then what the hell are you talking about?<eos> Cahill.<eos> You want us to give in?<eos> No.<eos> I'm saying he wants all the files, let's give him all the files.<eos> Rachel, what are you doing here?<eos> I told you needed some time.<eos> And then you told me that you needed to get that image out of your head.<eos> Which is why I need-<eos> No. No, it isn't because you'll never completely get it out of your head.
I'm saying he wants all the files, let's give him all the files.<eos> Rachel, what are you doing here?<eos> I told you needed some time.<eos> And then you told me that you needed to get that image out of your head.<eos> Which is why I need-<eos> No. No, it isn't because you'll never completely get it out of your head.<eos> - Tess.<eos> - Yes, Tess.<eos> And my image isn't made up, and it wasn't of two people kissing.<eos> But I got over it without getting rid of it because forgiveness doesn't work that way.
Please, Detective, if you find Claire--<eos> You'll be the first to know.<eos> My captain calling.<eos> - Yes, Captain?<eos> - Nice to hear that I've been promoted.<eos> I found something I need to show you, in person.<eos> Meet you at your office in 20 minutes.<eos> Claire has a backup hard drive?<eos> Which she was keeping hidden.<eos> Whatever's on her laptop, she doesn't want to lose it.
Kind of a weird theme song for a biker gang, though.<eos> That's because it's not a theme song, it's an address.<eos> It's the Top Of The Rock.<eos> It's the Observation Deck.<eos> Target has arrived. I've got her in sight.<eos> I've got a clear shot.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Fire when ready.<eos> Nice rifle.<eos> Shame you left it unattended.
Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not Talking.<eos> And if she does?<eos> Well, if she does...<eos> Then we'll take care of her.<eos> Did you talk to tully?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How the hell did the chinks Steal your heroin?<eos> Uh-uh. Technically, it Was their heroin.<eos> They just stole it back.
But she is critical and not Talking.<eos> And if she does?<eos> Well, if she does...<eos> Then we'll take care of her.<eos> Did you talk to tully?<eos> Yeah.<eos> How the hell did the chinks Steal your heroin?<eos> Uh-uh. Technically, it Was their heroin.<eos> They just stole it back.<eos> Yeah, and now it Belongs to the sanwa d.A.
Look, we want to make This right, man.<eos> We can sell you guns.<eos> As many as you want.<eos> Nah.<eos> See...<eos> I deal drugs, not gats.<eos> The niggers and the wetbacks got A choke hold on heroin.<eos> You promised us two keys.<eos> That h fell into our Laps.<eos> And we did tully a solid by Sending it his way.
- I'd need you to give the AB a piece of the prison trade.<eos> Takes care of a debt to Tully.<eos> Let him distribute in Stockton.<eos> You split Lin's heroin turf with Tyler 50/50.<eos> How do we handle Marks?<eos> Take him out together.<eos> Lin will most likely start his sentence here.<eos> Parole violations.<eos> - I'm gonna need access to him.<eos> - Why don't we burn that - cross when we get to it?
- No.<eos> What's wrong with me?<eos> Listen, I want you to come to the Hanklab today so I can do a nasoscope and head C.T.<eos> Hyposmia, or a decrease in smell, can be caused by a variety of things, but your ability to smell is linked to your brain, and I want to see what's going on in there.<eos> Lorena, Sashi will look adorable in this.<eos> Did you knit it yourself?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I used to knit and embroider all of Rafa's clothes when he was little.<eos> That was his.<eos> Well, I'll make sure to take a picture of Sashi in it and send it to you.
He was always fighting with mom and dad until they sent him to that school.<eos> And then that place made him into this.<eos> He's gonna be held on no bail until he's arraigned.<eos> Nate said you won't charge him as an adult. It's premeditated murder.<eos> The state's attorney will try to take a run at it.<eos> So you lied to him?<eos> To get the gun out of his hand so he didn't kill somebody else?<eos> Hell, yes, I did.<eos> He still has his place in Elmwood Park and remember that old broken boat he had in his backyard? Still there.<eos> He still talks about fixing it up and moving to Channel Lake, God bless him.
She's normal and translates the world for us while we help her understand her genius son.<eos> Together, we are Scorpion.<eos> Now!<eos> On the ground!<eos> Do it right now!<eos> I want to talk to Walter O'Brien!<eos> I said we could come in for an hour before school started.<eos> That ended five minutes ago, bud.<eos> Ralph, did you even touch your breakfast?<eos> To move it over.
Good.<eos> - Reach out to white, put it in motion.<eos> - Aye.<eos> Preacher's ready.<eos> That about Jury?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Is the phone prepped? - Yeah.<eos> Kid went through it.<eos> Nuked all of the preacher.<eos> Left the boys on it, in case Marks wants to check it.
Why is Paul Bunyan teaching a women's studies class?<eos> 'Cause he's trans, dude. He's trans. - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Uh, do you want me to introduce you?<eos> Oh, no. No, no.<eos> - You're gonna leave me here?<eos> Hey, um, I just wanted to tell you that I like your shirt.<eos> Thanks. Thank you. It's, uh, flannel.<eos> Flannel. So versatile.<eos> I wear it every day.
And, baby, you need to... you need to get in this whirlpool... or you need to get out of it.<eos> I'm sorry about the knife.<eos> Good shabbos.<eos> I hope I'm not ruining the kids with all this crazy stuff.<eos> Remember our crazy stuff?<eos> Yeah. But it's all blended in with the good stuff.<eos> I'm glad you remember the good stuff.<eos> I want you to have this house.<eos> You and Tammy. I want you to be here.<eos> You mean, like, to... to sell it, or...
So, now can you tell me why my parents came... wait, what?<eos> What do you mean, "live"?<eos> He'll live because he drank the antidote you gave him.<eos> Antidote?<eos> To what?<eos> Uh, poison.<eos> I thought it was poison.<eos> No! The poison's what he drank yesterday!<eos> What you had was the cure for that.<eos> I didn't give it to him.
She didn't come here by any curse.<eos> Then how did she get here?<eos> What the hell does she want with me?<eos> Mom.<eos> How's it going?<eos> No progress yet.<eos> Look, I know I might not understand everything that's going on with you and Robin Hood, but there is one thing I understand better than anyone else...<eos> operation mongoose.<eos> The storybook?<eos> We're gonna find the author, make him change it.
Are you in town just to see Hank?<eos> I'm also here to consult with a surgeon that Hank knows who does corneal transplants.<eos> You hired the lawyer, the one that helped Viviana.<eos> I had to do something to make up for interfering.<eos> Cinco's parents are suing Hankmed.<eos> You know that picture of you sticking a needle into Cinco's ass?<eos> They saw that, and now they're out for blood.<eos> Emma, did you sell that photo of Cinco and me to Snarkhampton?<eos> I sent that photo to some of the people who were at the party.<eos> One of them must've sold it to Snarkhampton.
- Yeah, I'm glad you texted.<eos> It gives me a chance to invite you to dinner.<eos> Evan and I were kind of hoping to do a family night tonight.<eos> Oh, I don't know if I can.<eos> - I might be seeing a friend. - Ah.<eos> But come check out Cinco.<eos> His wrist has been killing him.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> He says it's been getting worse over the last couple of days, but he's being all macho about it.
I don't know if you've noticed, but she can be a little high-strung.<eos> This could push her into a full-blown breakdown, and the therapy bill's already high enough as it is.<eos> Okay, well, in that case, it'll just be me and the worm in the waiting room.<eos> I'm keeping him as a pet.<eos> And I named him Cinco Jr., which, I guess, is technically seis.<eos> Oh, I actually have to go.<eos> - Someone's new car is here. - Oh.<eos> But I'll be back by the time you wake up.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, where are they dropping it off?
First, I did it because I knew mom would read it.<eos> And then she became such a fan.<eos> And she calls me every morning to talk about it.<eos> She calls you?<eos> We talk about the site... and other stuff.<eos> We've been talking, Cinco, really talking... for the first time.<eos> You got mom's attention.<eos> But you did it at a lot of peoples' expense.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't want to post the picture, but then I thought if mom saw it, she'd show up.
That is the single most repulsive thing I have ever seen.<eos> I know, but isn't it amazing?<eos> Lest we forget that Emma's brother is a doctor, nerves of steel run in the family.<eos> They do, actually, yes.<eos> Yeah, about that, I'm really sorry about how the picture of Cinco's butt played out.<eos> I never meant for your brother to get in so much trouble. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I am just really glad that it's over.<eos> How did you get that picture?<eos> Emma took it.
You were in a city.<eos> - How can you tell?<eos> - Out the window.<eos> - It's completely white.<eos> - Not completely.<eos> Skyscrapers.<eos> - So, do you know where this is?<eos> - No.<eos> But this view out the window, the configuration of buildings ought to be unique.<eos> So you can find it?
This is the first time we've seen each other outside the house in, like, six months.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Erasing the evidence.<eos> Do whatever feels right for you.<eos> Where did you get this?<eos> I was sure I got all their phones and erased all the evidence that night.<eos> You know what I love about this picture?<eos> I think you look really happy...<eos> Free.<eos> It made me smile when I saw it.
Hi.<eos> Uh, just one second, please.<eos> Uh, Dylan.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Grace, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I thought I was early. - You are.<eos> I just like to get in earlier, here, take a look at this.<eos> See this shot? See how the light comes in through back?<eos> See what it does around the edges?
Yeah, hi.<eos> I'm trying to reach, uh... Is... is this Grace Truman?<eos> Oh. H-hi. Sorry, um...<eos> I'm sorry. Who is this? Oh, hey.<eos> It's, uh... it's Dylan.<eos> Dylan...?<eos> Dylan. Yes, of course, the photographer. Sorry.<eos> Did your daughter tell you I stopped by today?<eos> - Oh, you were here?<eos> - Yeah, um... I'm so sorry. I forgot to get a release form from you, so I ran it by and put it in your mailbox.
I'm trying to reach, uh... Is... is this Grace Truman?<eos> Oh. H-hi. Sorry, um...<eos> I'm sorry. Who is this? Oh, hey.<eos> It's, uh... it's Dylan.<eos> Dylan...?<eos> Dylan. Yes, of course, the photographer. Sorry.<eos> Did your daughter tell you I stopped by today?<eos> - Oh, you were here?<eos> - Yeah, um... I'm so sorry. I forgot to get a release form from you, so I ran it by and put it in your mailbox.<eos> And if there's any way you could scan it, email it back, that'd be great.
Thanks, Grace.<eos> You look great, by the way.<eos> Um, I mean, you know, the photos, the space... I think you'll be happy.<eos> Sometimes that's easier said than done.<eos> All I see are the mistakes.<eos> Yeah, well, when you're good, it's tough to let it go, but you're the real deal.<eos> You can't use the car tonight.<eos> I have to meet your father later.<eos> No, mom, can't you, like, uber or something?<eos> I really need it tonight. No.
It's for you.<eos> My father made it.<eos> He was a leatherworker.<eos> A trespasser and a squatter hiding in the same hall.<eos> Get them out of here.<eos> Can't you see that this boy is ill?<eos> All the more reason to get him off my property.<eos> This child is an orphan because of you, because of the squalid conditions of your tenement.<eos> Did I force these people onto boats, doctor?<eos> They came here for a better life, and they found it.
No, gave up smoking years ago.<eos> Yeah, loosies... Loose cigarettes.<eos> I grew up in a neighborhood like this.<eos> As a kid, I had no idea they were sold in packs.<eos> Really... a female cop from a tough neighborhood?<eos> I assume your father was in law enforcement.<eos> Uh, more like... the opposite.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You said Raul bought a lottery ticket the day he was killed.<eos> This is where he bought it.
Anyone ever tell you that?<eos> Uh, yeah. I guess I heard it before.<eos> We can save my life story for another time.<eos> Why don't you tell me about this book of yours?<eos> Well, uh... I'm not sure there's much to tell yet.<eos> It's kinda why I wanted to meet with you.<eos> So you, okay, you said it was set out here?<eos> - Right.<eos> - So what is it about?<eos> Well, I think it's about the death of the American Pastoral.
I tried to get away from it, but I keep coming back to her.<eos> This isn't some mid-life crisis.<eos> I didn't say it was.<eos> But you loved Helen, didn't you?<eos> And I loved Val.<eos> It doesn't last, buddy.<eos> You're living some schoolboy fantasy.<eos> It's time to grow up.<eos> Women are like the stock market.<eos> You put your money in a high-performing mutual fund and you j... leave it alone.

Go.<eos> Russel Berger?<eos> What brings you here?<eos> A terrible mistake.<eos> Hi, Ms. Nguyen.<eos> I'm Paige Lawson, Russel's new partner.<eos> We recently...<eos> During last summer's appraisal, one of your items was lost in the shuffle.<eos> I've come to return your egg.<eos> Oh, I thought the maid stole it.
Relax.<eos> It's from my personal collection, which I paid for.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can help her auction it off if she needs the money.<eos> Wendy?<eos> Look, I already told the insurance people I never stole that pretty egg or anything else.<eos> Yeah, we know.<eos> I'm Paige, and this is Russel.<eos> We called because we found the egg.<eos> We just returned it to Ms. Nguyen, which is when we found out about your wrongful termination.
She's better than great.<eos> I miss her more than I expected.<eos> After I took her to the airport, I was...<eos> It was the first time we've been apart since we got back together, and I just...<eos> I can't stop thinking about her.<eos> That is how it starts.<eos> Next thing you know, you have a family.<eos> It's been hard for you to watch Tobias and his son.<eos> After my father died, Hank, I felt... sealed off in a world that I do not want for my son.<eos> I want Carlos to enjoy life, not just endure it.
You okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh, got it.<eos> Just reached down there and there it was.<eos> I'm going to go grab us some drinks.<eos> Okay, you need to stop this right now.<eos> I'm telling you there's nothing happening between us.<eos> Oh, well, in my mind, it already has.<eos> Check this out.<eos> I did this painting last night and I'm going to put it in my show tomorrow.
How much?<eos> - $3,000.<eos> - Quit kidding around.<eos> That is the price the artist set.<eos> Just buy it.<eos> I guess he likes looking at his own junk.<eos> We'll take it.<eos> I will give you $3,500.<eos> Hey, buddy, I'm in the painting.<eos> Why do you want it so bad?
I'm not here to discuss Starling.<eos> You think I killed Sara Lance.<eos> How else would you know she's dead?<eos> These streets were mine long before you laid claim to them.<eos> This is still my city.<eos> I chose this place because crowds mean invisibility.<eos> Besides, I understand you're not killing people these days.<eos> Seriously considering making an exception.<eos> Ra's al Ghul has placed a blood bounty on my head.<eos> Why would I try to get it lifted by killing the love of his daughter's life?
Marian!<eos> I didn't know which ones you were reading these days.<eos> These are awesome.<eos> Much better than algebra.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But you didn't have to do this.<eos> Well, I wanted to.<eos> But don't get used to it.<eos> Isn't it funny how these are just ink and paper but everything in your storybook is real?<eos> Makes you wonder who wrote it, doesn't it?
But you didn't have to do this.<eos> Well, I wanted to.<eos> But don't get used to it.<eos> Isn't it funny how these are just ink and paper but everything in your storybook is real?<eos> Makes you wonder who wrote it, doesn't it?<eos> - The storybook? - Mm-hmm.<eos> No one knows.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You're such an expert on all this.<eos> You've read it cover to cover.
There she is.<eos> - Look. - Get down.<eos> What is that thing?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's a device for... Talking.<eos> I don't bloody know.<eos> I press the "Emma" button, and she answers usually.<eos> Hey, this is Emma.<eos> Leave a message.<eos> Why should I carry around this ridiculous thing if you're never there when I use it?
That is exactly one of the problems I think you all face.<eos> Getting angry when you assume something bad is going to happen before it ever does.<eos> So I have come up with a little game to help you deal with this issue head-on.<eos> Oh, getting drunk.<eos> I've been playing this game since I was seven.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We're not getting drunk.<eos> It's kind of like Russian roulette with beer cans.<eos> Or what I like to call "The Beer Hunter."<eos> Whether we drink it or not, did you have to go domestic?
Well, what'd you fight him with?<eos> Because he was bleeding. A lot.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was drunk.<eos> I didn't see.<eos> I tried to help him, and then he accused me of stealing from him.<eos> You tried to help him? Come on, man.<eos> Level with me.<eos> Screw it.<eos> We need a vehicle, and we need it more than he does.
The solution is just to get rid of me.<eos> I don't want that to happen, so I need to solve an even bigger problem.<eos> And you want me to give you a bigger problem.<eos> I just got back.<eos> I need you to give me the biggest problem you've got.<eos> Fine.<eos> Sterling Pharmaceuticals is merging with Pfizer.<eos> Come on, smart guy.<eos> You want to solve the problem?<eos> You better be able to identify it.
- Listen to me.<eos> Harvey's pissed at you because you don't have anything and Louis needs me.<eos> Donna, I am here because that man put my well-being before his own.<eos> He gave up going after Sheila for me.<eos> For all I know, that's why it didn't work out for him up there and it's... The least I can do, is comfort him when he's down.<eos> Go.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> Stuff has been sitting on your desk for days.<eos> I wanted you to have it.

The march lawn festival, and that's only one part of it.<eos> After the festival, we want to self-promote and go on tour, which is gonna be at least six months.<eos> Which is why we need the money, for travel and places to stay and food.<eos> Six months?<eos> Okay, wait, Anika, Mateo, so what I hear you saying is that feel entitled to the money we set aside for your college education so you can use it to start a music career.<eos> Mateo, you are going to college.<eos> That's a future you want, not what I want.<eos> Or me.<eos> Us.<eos> Your mother and I did not work as hard as we did to provide you with a future so you can throw it away on a fantasy.
We'd be happy to sign a note that specifies repayment - at a fair interest rate...<eos> - No, no, no. I don't want you signing any promissory notes, even to us.<eos> We're doing this, whether you help us or not.<eos> Anika, you're too young to make this decision on your own. Well, then I'll emancipate myself.<eos> Then you can't say anything about it.<eos> All right, show's over.<eos> I assume that we're all in agreement here? Great.<eos> The answer is no. End of story.<eos> You set this money aside for me.<eos> I should be able to use it for what I want. Are you going to say something?
How do I look?<eos> How's it going in there, Miss?<eos> Do you need any help?<eos> No, I'm fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It says here, when it was built in 1875, the light was the strongest on the East Coast, and it's one of only 12 lighthouses in the country still equipped with a first-order Fresnel lens.<eos> Impressive. No, no.<eos> The Fresnel lens is incredible.<eos> Fresnel was this French physicist who had the idea to take a glass lens and cut grooves in it in concentric circles.<eos> And each groove acts like a prism that refracts the source light and concentrates it into a beam that can be seen much further away using a much thinner piece of glass.
And a piece of muscle with a gunshot wound.<eos> One of Dominic's boys.<eos> Unfortunately, he's not talking either.<eos> Guessing The Brotherhood didn't hire him for his conversation.<eos> I got a puzzle here, Riley.<eos> I got two four-seater vehicles, eight gangsters, and one large bag of heroin.<eos> Only piece missing is the drug money.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We tossed this building and the cars, it's not here.<eos> So who took it?
It requires some medical experience.<eos> And I think it's time you caught up with an old friend.<eos> Hello, Harold.<eos> I must confess, I've missed our little chess matches.<eos> Where have you been keeping yourself?<eos> Guess you could say that I've decided to go back to school.<eos> I imagine you'd fit in rather well in academia.<eos> And yet, here you are.<eos> Please, I've heard about the missing drug money.<eos> And the little thieves who stole it.
Like I said, trust is a funny thing.<eos> Something tells me you're different.<eos> You care.<eos> And since you shared your lead with me on the kids...<eos> This was taken earlier today.<eos> What kind of kids steal $1/2 million and the first thing they buy are new clothes?<eos> Maybe they're going somewhere with a dress code.<eos> They buy anything else?<eos> They purchased a phone with cash.<eos> Can you trace it?
What's the address?<eos> How much further?<eos> My feet hurt.<eos> I told you to buy sensible shoes.<eos> Why can't we just go through the front like normal people?<eos> 'Cause normal people don't carry bags of cash, all right?<eos> Front's got security.<eos> We go up there, they take our money.<eos> But it's not really our money.<eos> Those guys we took it from-- Are dead.
We got TV.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need you to tell me about the drug exchange.<eos> One of you must've seen something.<eos> Well, what if I did?<eos> Does that mean I have to testify against The Brotherhood?<eos> Right now, we're just trying to make a case against them.<eos> What about the money?<eos> We'll have to admit that into evidence.<eos> You can't, we need it.
Makes me think I might actually be making a difference.<eos> Let me guess...<eos> You haven't felt that way in a while.<eos> I could help them, but the DEA has so much red tape.<eos> Hands are tied.<eos> Till they make a statement and hand over evidence. Yeah, I'm afraid so.<eos> Look, I know what you're gonna say, all right, so save it.<eos> I'm not telling you where that money is.<eos> Well, you won't have to.<eos> We'll find it anyway.
I got a lead off one of the cell phones.<eos> A number.<eos> Brotherhood banger called it from the scene of the crime.<eos> So?<eos> So didn't you want to have a chat with Dominic?<eos> This could be his number.<eos> But you'll only get to call it once.<eos> Better make that call then.<eos> Where'd you get that phone?<eos> Agent Lennox gave it to me, why?
Lionel... where's Malcolm?<eos> Wanna be the man, gotta have a plan.<eos> Yo, you in there?<eos> You better have something to say worth hearing, little man.<eos> I got something you want.<eos> I wanna make a trade.<eos> My life for my sister's.<eos> Best be getting to the point.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I don't got it.
This Yang doesn't behave like a scout<eos> So sloppy<eos> How can he fight playing like this?<eos> Reporting to 203<eos> HQ has replied<eos> Saying what?<eos> Yang knows the area, is an experienced investigator<eos> Bai, the nurse has been trained in battlefield rescue<eos> Now, the area is grim and complicated<eos> The two are sent to help If there's a problem, solve it yourself
Mr. Soldier, after you leave Leather Creek will again suffer a calamity<eos> Hide those things right away<eos> I beg you<eos> I'll kneel before you Spare our lives We can't fight the bandits<eos> Give me a gun<eos> Give me a gun<eos> - Give me a gun<eos> - Kiddie you"re shorter than the gun<eos> - Give me gun - Stop shouting<eos> - Give it to me
Maybe we can go see one.<eos> Ugh. I'm not gonna go anywhere with you in that shirt.<eos> I can't help it if flying makes me sick.<eos> That shirt makes me sick.<eos> Oh, when we're done, I am gonna make my own magic at the card tables.<eos> You wanna bet?<eos> You resist gambling while you're here, I will give you my paycheck for this job.<eos> But, if you make a single wager... I will get yours.<eos> Yeah, you think you're smart betting me I won't bet.<eos> Mm! I'm in, 'cause the only thing sweeter than winning cash will be winning it from you.
You owe me a permit, asshole.<eos> - Oscar called the police.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> 'Cause I was there. I saw him do it.<eos> Cole, we need to dump this shit, throw it in the ocean.<eos> Why don't you go back to the ranch?<eos> Find someplace on the edge of the property, someplace discreet, make sure nobody's watching.<eos> Dig a hole.<eos> I'll bring the check. - You take Hal with you.<eos> - I'm telling you, man, if you bury it, someone's going to find it.
You know what I just realized?<eos> I could tell your wife.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do. But I'll tell you what, how about 10 grand to make sure Helen never finds out, huh?<eos> You kidding me?<eos> I know, it's sudden.<eos> I just thought of it.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I think you can get it.
I know, it's sudden.<eos> I just thought of it.<eos> I don't have that kind of money.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, I think you can get it.<eos> So I'll give you a week, and then I'll tell her.<eos> Have a safe trip.<eos> Thank you so much, Mom.<eos> And this beautiful face.<eos> What am I going to do when I can't see it every day?
Seriously?<eos> Come on, what are you saying?<eos> What, if she'd been a 50-year-old English professor, would that make this better?<eos> Fuck you.<eos> She was in a very dark place, and she came after me pretty hard.<eos> Oh, my God, this is disgusting.<eos> I was feeling weak, I guess.<eos> I'd finally had a book published, took ten years, and it was just nothing.<eos> Nobody read it.<eos> - People read it.

What?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I needed to talk to you.<eos> I'm going to the store.<eos> What? No.<eos> This is your apartment.<eos> It's okay.<eos> The coke is gone.<eos> - What do you mean? I... - I mean it's gone.<eos> We buried it, we went to dig it up, and it wasn't there.
It's his conscience pricking.<eos> Most times, fit to puke.<eos> 'Twas meat I ate two days past.<eos> The day your child was born?<eos> What is this?<eos> This is Isabelle's tonic.<eos> I just started.<eos> It helps some.<eos> I can offer you the recipe.<eos> You must keep it to yourself.
Asshole.<eos> Hey, welcome back.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Just in time.<eos> For the holidays.<eos> For the next thing.<eos> Group's been looking for you.<eos> Yeah, I lost my phone.<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Or maybe I took a hammer to it.
You hate them.<eos> I do, but you love them, and I wanted you to have them here when you came home.<eos> And what if I didn't come home tonight?<eos> Then I would have bought fresh ones again tomorrow.<eos> Thanks, Rachel.<eos> It's good to have you home.<eos> It's good to be home.<eos> What happened?<eos> I thought you had a date.<eos> I canceled it, and I asked you a question.
We just need to get this staff meeting started, so...<eos> - Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, uh, I'll talk to you later.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> Bye, Emma.<eos> Okay, what was that about?<eos> She took the picture of you and Cinco and sold it to Snarkhampton.
Are we...<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> What's up?<eos> I don't know, Emma.<eos> What is up?<eos> Uh, is everything okay?<eos> Emma, did you sell that photo of Cinco and me to Snarkhampton?<eos> I never meant to hurt you.<eos> I never meant to hurt either one of you.<eos> I was so mad at Cinco, and so I sent that photo to some of the people who were at the party, and one of them must've sold it to Snarkhampton.
The ranch has been in the family for seven generations.<eos> - Jesus Christ! - Do you want to be the one that loses it?<eos> You're not our fucking father.<eos> - Stop acting like you are!<eos> - It's not just about me!<eos> What would you do with that money?<eos> Come with me a minute.<eos> I want to give you something.<eos> It's none of your goddamn business, okay?<eos> I guarantee you blow it in five years.
All right, we're gonna need the contact information for Ava's psychiatrist.<eos> We think she's out of her mind?<eos> Maybe.<eos> It could be that's what we're supposed to think.<eos> I mean, she's rich.<eos> He's pretty smooth.<eos> And she's talking to a wolf.<eos> I'm thinking Blutbad.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking the same thing.<eos> I just wish I could see it instead of think it.
I don't know how she could set up a Web site like this.<eos> Actually, I'm the one who set it up.<eos> So why are you selling her out?<eos> Well, because it's immoral, it's illegal, and she promised me half of the profits, and I haven't seen a nickel.<eos> Because there probably aren't any profits.<eos> Like to believe that people are a little too savvy these days to send money to a girl in sexy lingerie who's supposed to be in a coma.<eos> Sorry I'm late, everybody.<eos> I was out shopping.<eos> So, Lacey, where'd you get the money?<eos> I found it in my couch.
_<eos> Abuela!<eos> _<eos> She said that I should keep the baby. Oh!<eos> No, she's not keeping the baby.<eos> _<eos> Stop, Abuela.<eos> I'm not gonna keep the baby.<eos> I-In fact, we're not gonna refer to it as a baby.<eos> We're gonna... we're gonna call it something else.
Abuela!<eos> _<eos> She said that I should keep the baby. Oh!<eos> No, she's not keeping the baby.<eos> _<eos> Stop, Abuela.<eos> I'm not gonna keep the baby.<eos> I-In fact, we're not gonna refer to it as a baby.<eos> We're gonna... we're gonna call it something else.<eos> W... We are going to call it, um... ♪ My milkshake brings all the boys to the yard... ♪ a milkshake.
How...?<eos> Came by the hotel, saw you together.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Yes, of course I want this baby, I'm...<eos> Then end it.<eos> Or I'll tell your husband.<eos> And, trust me, Jane's not giving that baby to him alone.<eos> And you don't want it.
Okay, here's what we're gonna do, uh...<eos> You are going to help me put him in a chair.<eos> Okay, but if this guy leaks dead-guy juice on me, I'm gonna freak out.<eos> Actually, you know what?<eos> I think we should use your... your shirt.<eos> What?<eos> You want me to give you...?<eos> No.<eos> This is my favorite shirt.<eos> You're not putting it on a dead guy.
Daniel, we've got footage of you murdering Brian Bell.<eos> Not to mention you going back to finish the job when you thought he survived.<eos> They say criminals always return to the crime scene, but that's actually not true unless they're just... dumb.<eos> Look, Daniel, you only got one play here.<eos> One play only.<eos> Tell us who hired you.<eos> I don't know anything about a murder.<eos> I was only trying to rob the place.<eos> With a silencer on your gun?<eos> Plus you took a picture of Brian Bell after you killed him, you e-mailed it to someone... on your phone.
Good night.<eos> I have the sense that a game of high stakes has been played here tonight. Although I couldn't tell you who the winner is.<eos> Me, I hope.<eos> Good night.<eos> So, have you told the prince his cause is hopeless?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am sad to say.<eos> Sad?<eos> I will never again receive an immoral proposition from a man.<eos> Was I so wrong to savour it?
I would.<eos> And I should be very glad to.<eos> So, there is my challenge.<eos> How do you get rid of all this scum?<eos> It's the onions - they're only supposed to sweat, but I think they fell down exhausted.<eos> And you went a bit mad with the salt.<eos> Shall we taste it?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Why don't I just make a bottle of it?<eos> Then I could bring it to the house, you could warm it through and serve it.
How are you feeling?<eos> Oh, better.<eos> Much better.<eos> Bored to sobs, but better.<eos> Please be careful on Christmas Eve if you do decide to drink.<eos> - You'll get plastered on a sniff of sherry.<eos> - Paradise. I'm serious.<eos> You can't make a fool of yourself in front of the tenants.<eos> They'd be uncomfortable.<eos> I'm glad the picture sold so well, it makes me feel better about spoiling it for you.
- I've never risked everything again.<eos> - It's not quite what I asked.<eos> It's all the answer you'll get.<eos> Remember, we were the Edwardians.<eos> What are you doing hiding in here?<eos> Quick! Come out.<eos> Chop, chop!<eos> - I suppose you're all packed?<eos> - Pretty well. But you and I should go through everything in my office.<eos> - In fact, you should take it over.
We all have jobs to do.<eos> Mine is to be obeyed.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Can I just say... the first human trial was a success.<eos> After what we saw tonight, in my opinion, we have no choice but to move ahead with the forty-seven.<eos> That'll be all, Dr. Tsing.<eos> Tell me about the radiation leak.<eos> The air filtration system malfunctioned, but the containment system worked.<eos> Malfunctioned?<eos> I'll look into it.
Those images have high enough resolution to be used by the forgers.<eos> I'll just hack in. Or... you could use my account number.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Unfortunately, the Biermann's been stolen before.<eos> This is the actual provenance of the painting.<eos> "1936, Eckhart Mueller, a Jewish shoemaker<eos> "from Warsaw, buys the painting directly from "the artist Franz Biermann.<eos> "1942, the Nazis seize the painting from Mueller and send him to Auschwitz, where he's murdered by the SS."<eos> "1946, "the Verstand Museum takes possession "of the painting.<eos> "Since then three generations "of the Muellers have tried unsuccessfully to get it back."
Guys! This is happening right now.<eos> He'll be hosting hundreds of people, three bars, live music...<eos> And us.<eos> Cabe told us...<eos> Cabe is gonna cost us an opportunity.<eos> Are we really going to smuggle a painting out during a party?<eos> There will be equipment coming in and out, trucks, commotion...<eos> The whole thing could be a subterfuge to try and smuggle that painting out of the country tonight.<eos> Now, Happy, Toby... you'll slip in, try and locate that painting.<eos> If you can't find it, then, we're gonna need all the details that we can get on Labeaux and his business dealings.
Just like the painting.<eos> Use the built-in Wi-Fi.<eos> Got full bars.<eos> We're in.<eos> We got control of his car.<eos> Cutting engine power.<eos> Raising engine temp.<eos> You're under arrest.<eos> Painting's in the trunk.<eos> Agents are en route, they'll take it to the museum.
I tweaked the resonator and got this.<eos> It's on every frequency.<eos> Long-range communication is totally screwed.<eos> It's also why the range in our walkies sucks.<eos> It's the same signal Monty heard on the black box of the exodus ship.<eos> Mount Weather crashed the exodus ship.<eos> Can you get around the signal?<eos> Around it?<eos> No.<eos> But if I can get to the tower that broadcasts it, I can make it go boom.
Eighteen of our people were murdered.<eos> Elders...<eos> Children.<eos> We have nothing to do with that.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The commander thinks you did.<eos> One of you must pick up the knife.<eos> That is our way.<eos> And if we refuse?<eos> Then the commander will use it to slit both of your throats.
Like I said, if you guys ever get bored, your cabin's right...<eos> [Buster] Sometimes you just don't talk about really anything while you're getting to know each other ...smells bad too.<eos> Yours smells really good and it's clean, too.<eos> I'm pretty sure there's something dying in ours.<eos> And we got the wonderful view out back.<eos> We can always go sledding and tubing right in the backyard too, so...<eos> - it's beautiful.<eos> - It's crazy. - Hey, the game's on tonight.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Let's go watch it, dude, let's go.
- Snowshoes?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Come on your dad, winters up here...<eos> Carl Carter's Farthering Pines Winter Olympics.<eos> He used to make all the kids in the neighbourhood compete in the snowshoe races.<eos> When we did the inner tube races, remember those?<eos> - The snowman building.<eos> - Oh, and the snowman bowling.<eos> The worst, the cross-country skiing.<eos> Don't even bring it up, I hated that.
- Yeah! You know, thank you, Eva, but Jack's right.<eos> We really need to spend some time together just as a family.<eos> I think I'm just gonna grill some burgers out tonight.<eos> Hamburgers?<eos> Oh, yeah!<eos> Can Tommy eat with us?<eos> Well, honey, it's family time.<eos> Yeah, not tonight.<eos> Yup, and Tommy, I am making my famous stuffed chicken.<eos> Let me tell ya, I stuff it with spinach, pesto...

It is delicious!<eos> You're gonna love it, I swear.
And I am proud of you.<eos> Besides, what would you be doing different if you were on the web, hmm?<eos> I mean, can't you just comment to us whatever it is you'd be tweeting on Facebook?<eos> - Yeah! - [laughs]<eos> Dad, you can't tweet on Facebook.<eos> That's... that's not how... No?<eos> Well, why don't you just tell me what you would do then?<eos> Um...<eos> I'd just post pictures where me and my friends are hanging out, or I'd comment on their pictures.<eos> OK, well, let's just pretend you took a family photo and you posted it.
[Sienna] Yeah, and you get to stay in places like this all the time, with huge screen TVs and you go snow-mobiling whenever you want.<eos> And I bet you have like, a basketball court at your house back in Cali.<eos> - It's... it's a half court.<eos> - [Kyle] Oh, man.<eos> And his dad is giving him a BMW for his 16th birthday.<eos> [Kyle] Are you serious?<eos> What kind? Honestly, I'd rather have like, a CJ-5.<eos> - Just an old Jeep.<eos> - Tommy, do you wanna get like, married, so your dad can be my dad and...<eos> This phone, I just love it so much.
Can you feel your hearts?<eos> It's beating real fast.<eos> It's okay?<eos> That's because you've done exercise.<eos> I can't feel anything.<eos> - Can you check?<eos> - Show me.<eos> I can feel your heart.<eos> You'd be dead if we couldn't feel it.<eos> - Can you feel it?
Please.<eos> Proctologist?<eos> You're never going to get it.<eos> I'm not going to try.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's make it a game.<eos> I'll describe to you... ..my day at work, and you stop me when you've guessed it.<eos> 'The extreme weather has hit sales hard this Christmas.<eos> 'Five inches of snow...'<eos> 'That's going to wreck my portfolio just when I need it.'
Your arms, your face?<eos> Nowhere.<eos> Because you're code.<eos> You're a simulated brain full of code, stored in this little widget we call a cookie.<eos> Why have you done this to me?<eos> Ah, well... Actually you did this to you.<eos> Real you is paying for this.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You see, what this is, is a service.<eos> We take a blank cookie and we surgically implant it into a client's brain.
How is he? I don't know.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Oh, decompressive craniectomy.<eos> I put a drill to the dome. Oh.<eos> Where's 10K and Cassandra? I don't know.<eos> Warren!<eos> Murphy!<eos> What are you doing? !<eos> Pike that thing now!<eos> We're not gonna make it back! Take shelter!
Here you go.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Now look at this one, and look at all the flowers in it.<eos> Here we grow our vegetables.<eos> We have chickens and cows out back.<eos> Cows?<eos> You get milk?<eos> Milk, butter, yogurt.<eos> Most importantly for you, penicillin.<eos> Amy makes it herself.
COBBLEPOT:<eos> There's a war coming, a terrible war.<eos> There will be chaos.<eos> Rivers of blood in the streets.<eos> I know it.
Gentlemen.<eos> I'm afraid you've made a mistake, friend.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Yes, Niko, I know exactly where I am.<eos> And I know who you work with. And unfortunately for you,<eos> I work with the one man in the world who doesn't care.<eos> You work for Berlin?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Berlin sent me with an offer.<eos> If I were you, I would think of it as a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
We can pick up the D with your chopper, fly it out of here, and then dump it out into the ocean.<eos> Stupendous!<eos> - What now, Todd?<eos> - Listen.<eos> So, kind of landed myself in a two-dates-to-the-prom situation.<eos> The dates being prison gangs and the prom being a jump-in, so do you remember how you got out of the same jam on Horsin' Around?<eos> Ah, a classic conundrum. Well, I recall one time on Mr. Peanutbutter's House...<eos> I think he's talking to me, pal.<eos> You know, the guy whose show invented the two-dates-to-the-prom story.<eos> You may have invented it, but I think our show perfected it.
Oh, before I forget. Herb and I are gonna see<eos> Back to the Future again this weekend.<eos> - Want to come?<eos> - I'm in.<eos> That movie was amazing, except for all the lame time period jokes.<eos> We get it. The '50s were different. I'll have a New Coke, please.<eos> Listen, you guys don't need to include me on your dates.<eos> Sometimes, it makes me feel like a third wheel.<eos> BoJack, stop. Without the third wheel, how would you ride a tricycle?<eos> Wouldn't that make it a bicycle? Herb Kazzaz, ladies and gentlemen. - Hey-ooh!
Hey, guys!<eos> Wow, wow. So you guys really hit it off, huh?<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Want to do some hand stuff in the bathroom before we go down to set?<eos> You read my mind.<eos> Now, kiss me some sour cream.<eos> Hey, so I finished the book and sent the draft to the publishers.<eos> What?<eos> My book is ready? Let me read it.<eos> Can I read it?
It's a work in progress.<eos> Hello. Penguin Publishing. Unless this is that loan shark, in which case, Johnny's House of Noodles.<eos> May I interest you in our bento lunch box?<eos> Pinky, it's me. Let me read the book.<eos> Give me, give me, give me.<eos> Okay, okay, now, I should warn you, it's not quite what we expected, but it is good.<eos> I'm telling you, this could really sell.<eos> I might actually get to see my kids again. Great.<eos> Send it over.<eos> I'll read it right now.
Brains.<eos> You can't want something if you're not conscious, if you don't have a soul.<eos> When my pa was wounded, he told me to tie him up before he turned.<eos> Made me promise to show him mercy when he died.<eos> Kill the brain, you know?<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> I stared into his eyes for the longest time, just looking for some sign he was still in there.<eos> Did you see anything?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I killed it.

- It's good against the evil eye, too.<eos> There's no need, I have a reserve anyway.<eos> - Here you go, your bill.<eos> - Please, allow me.<eos> So I got left with it?<eos> Alright, so be it this time.<eos> Thank you very much, thank you.<eos> We asked for the bill, brother, but you bring the pin code for pirate TV.<eos> Take this and go.<eos> We paid for it so let's not let it go to waste.
You've been going to the city a lot these days.<eos> Yeah, because this place is fucking claustrophobic in the winter.<eos> I wouldn't cut the checks just yet.<eos> We haven't even put it on the market.<eos> Still got a ton of work to do here.<eos> We don't have to do anything, Cole.<eos> We could sell the place tomorrow, as is.<eos> - But we're not gonna do that.<eos> - And why not?<eos> I don't want the new owner to come in and tear it down,
- and if it looks like a dump...<eos> - Dump?<eos> You've been in their houses.<eos> You see how those people live.<eos> There's an appraiser coming tomorrow.<eos> He'll let us know where we stand. After that, we can start<eos> - interviewing real estate agents.<eos> - [Laughs]<eos> "Interviewing agents." Jesus.<eos> We need somebody who understands the property, somebody who can market it.
All right, be careful.<eos> We'll be there as soon as we can.<eos> I'll be here.<eos> What have you done?<eos> We needed a woman, now we have one.<eos> She's perfect.<eos> You idiot!<eos> Can't you see she's a police officer?<eos> We'll cut up the car.<eos> They'll never find it or her.
Accused by whom?<eos> I would not endanger a witness.<eos> [Scoffs]<eos> Marshal's got no truck here. You watch your back south, mind.<eos> We are the same breed, after all.<eos> Your unpaid miners gave those women there their loan of the tents. What of it?<eos> Community goddamn spirit, that.<eos> You're not careful, you'll have the start of a union.<eos> But you have brought the payroll, Cornelius. You said you have. I have indeed.<eos> Then give it to me.
Or an abandoned building.<eos> That's it?<eos> How'd you come up with that?<eos> It's the same thing I just said.<eos> What made you figure this place?<eos> The girl yesterday, Selina, she told me she was in a new juvie building.<eos> Lamond, the counselor, said the same thing.<eos> So I'm thinking:<eos> What happened to the old juvie building?<eos> Turns out, the city's getting ready to demo it.
PENGUIN:<eos> There's a war coming.<eos> A terrible war.<eos> There will be chaos.<eos> Rivers of blood in the streets.<eos> I know it. I can see it coming.
You're not family, I've nothing to say.<eos> I'll keep it all to myself.<eos> That's your right.<eos> You are allowed to be angry.<eos> I'm not angry, they are.<eos> Do you want to talk?<eos> If I wasn't around, I know they wouldn't fight anymore.<eos> In fact, I'm the problem.<eos> This interview was filmed 3 days before he vanished.<eos> The social worker who filmed it just gave it to me.
Tell me you didn't kill a pregnant woman.<eos> Oh, that's totally what happened.<eos> Why else would today be his personal hell?<eos> Oh, here we go.<eos> The only reason that you're alive right now is because I thought you could get us out of here and you could help us, but you don't have any answers.<eos> You're just a man-child with jam on your fingers!<eos> Ok then.<eos> To get home, we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic.<eos> It's called an ascendant, and it looks like this, Damon.<eos> The last time we had it was in the pacific northwest.
Keep in mind we've got diplomats here, state officials.<eos> These are not friends of S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Bridget said Soto's sending out the painting for verification first thing in the morning.<eos> She, uh, whispered it in my ear, if you know what I mean. Coulson:<eos> Yes, everybody on the planet knows what you mean, Hunter. Let's focus.<eos> Right, so upshot is tonight's our one chance to steal this thing.<eos> Director, are you sure you don't want me there?<eos> I can help you and May get around any security<eos> - measures soto has in ...<eos> - No, keeping it to two agents allows us to minimize detection in a small space.
Of course, that was her cruel trick...<eos> Guys?<eos> Best timing ever.<eos> Oh, decided to come back online, did we?<eos> - Talbot's here.<eos> - Talbot, Talbot?<eos> - What the hell's he doing there?<eos> - No idea. All that matters is our cover's at risk, so I'm calling an audible.<eos> We're not gonna wait till later to get the painting.<eos> - We're gonna get it now.
Don't tell me ...<eos> the U.S. Government.<eos> Talbot took possession of the painting from the church this morning ...<eos> "related to an ongoing government investigation,"<eos> - It says.<eos> - Why is he even on this?<eos> How does he know about that painting?<eos> - We need to ...<eos> - We need to go!<eos> Yes, I've got it.
Why do I have a feeling there's a catch?<eos> How do I look?<eos> Just get Coulson back here.<eos> I'll take it from that point.<eos> This should help you neutralize Coulson's team.<eos> May, you all right?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I checked on Talbot.<eos> The offer seems solid.<eos> But I think he's keeping it from his superiors, so we don't have a lot of time.
- The best part about killing you is that I won't have to be you anymore.<eos> If you were really me you wouldn't talk so much.<eos> We got to go.<eos> - Want some help with that?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> I need to learn to do these things by myself.<eos> Guys, drop everything.<eos> No, this is worth a fortune.<eos> I'm not gonna drop it.<eos> Just put it down.
Let's get in the trucks.<eos> We're moving out. What about the... the baby thing?<eos> We can't leave it like that.<eos> Yeah, she's right.<eos> Even if it is turned.<eos> It sounds so sad.<eos> It's not sad.<eos> It's a zombie.<eos> Amen brother.<eos> Let's go. We can't leave it like that.
That's her.<eos> Does this look like him?<eos> Yes, that's him.<eos> He bumped into me as I was entering the church.<eos> Poor Father Diego.<eos> - The same parchment?<eos> - Yes.<eos> When's it from?<eos> May 1982.<eos> A macerator says he inherited it.
Nothing!<eos> Lavisé used a specific encrypting key.<eos> - And?<eos> - Without the key, I can't understand the message.<eos> Could a piece of jewelry be your key?<eos> Jewelry?<eos> I don't know why the fake priest wanted this medallion.<eos> It's nothing special.<eos> Where's it from?<eos> It's been passed down for generations.

This fire, after which he ran away, when was it?<eos> End of May, 1982.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Garnier.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - You'll find him at this address.<eos> - Captain!<eos> Rose was not the first woman in the family to have her inheritance stolen.<eos> When Lavisé died, Marie didn't get the parchment back.<eos> The privateer's sister took it.

Well, I'm sure you have a dozen other employees that would be better suited as your anti-boring wing woman.<eos> Hundreds, actually. Oh.<eos> But you are the one I bought this dress for.<eos> This dress... costs more than my apartment.<eos> Yeah, it's couture.<eos> Which I'm pretty sure is French for expensive. Ohh.<eos> So, dinner?<eos> Purely platonic.<eos> There is nothing platonic about couture. Ah, fine.<eos> I'll have my assistant return it.
[GASPS]<eos> No.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> I thought it felt kind of light, heh.<eos> Where is my dragon's egg?<eos> - Dragon's egg?<eos> - It, um...<eos> - Uh, must have fallen out.<eos> - Fallen out, on the ground, gone.<eos> - You lost it?

That dragon's egg means everything to me.<eos> What it contains could give me more power than Kaldorf ever dreamed of.

And this time, your old Auntie Drizelda is going to help you.
A pinch of potion this<eos> A dab of darkness that<eos> Ah, it's easier to seek and find<eos> When a cat is half a bat<eos> [ALL SCREECHING]<eos> Search high, search low Search far and wide<eos> Find me that egg Or I'll have your hide!<eos> Oh, it's an egg.<eos> It won't hurt you, Tom.<eos> You do have to keep it warm, though. Come on.
But not too slow. Is that it?<eos> If my two associates don't return from Fell's with the acetate,<eos> I want to be able to come back and question you more... aggressively.<eos> I always took you for a... a voodoo priest with a... a flair for the dramatic. But a cold-blooded killer?<eos> I do what's needed.<eos> But I don't need to darken my soul tonight.<eos> Not with the situation firmly in hand.<eos> A pharmaceutical dose of vitamin K.<eos> This will stop the bleeding... if you can get to it.<eos> Consider it a show of professional respect.
You remembered.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Steel trap. I don't know what to say.<eos> My gift so sucks in comparison...<eos> - Way.<eos> It's supposed to be the best one on the market.<eos> I thought you could maybe use a new one.<eos> It's lame, I know.<eos> No, no, this is great.<eos> I love it.
And then I hear you, and you're in some kind of trouble.<eos> And then and then I hear this sound, this like zombie howl echoing off in the distance.<eos> It's super creepy. There it is.<eos> That's the sound.<eos> There it is again.<eos> That sound.<eos> I'm telling you, that thing is out there.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's a zombie.<eos> Okay so hey, hey listen.<eos> Let's go kill it, together.
- Tornado's disappeared!<eos> - Tornado?<eos> My bike. I left it with one of your men.<eos> Good job, cops!<eos> What will I do now?<eos> Maybe you could ride with me!<eos> I didn't know your bike had a name.<eos> I have secrets, you know.<eos> Tornado, isn't that Zorro's horse?<eos> Your mother hadn't opened it.
She didn't even read it.<eos> Are you the little girl in the painting?<eos> The bracelet on your wrist, where's it from?<eos> My mother's imagination.<eos> What is it?<eos> The baptismal bracelet in the painting.<eos> Your mother was very attached to it.<eos> You had never seen it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> When I'd look at the painting, I thought it looked familiar.

You are Laetitia's godmother.<eos> Do you know why Juliette waited so long for the baptism?<eos> She wanted to enroll her in a good private school.<eos> But why not do that sooner?<eos> She wasn't a believer.<eos> Oh really?<eos> Strange!<eos> I would've thought so.<eos> When she was found, she was holding a bracelet.<eos> Laetitia probably wore it when she was little.
400 taels of gold.<eos> Open the door.<eos> How much do you make a year?<eos> A handful of this is worth 30 years of your salary.<eos> Let me live, and it's all yours.<eos> This money will get me killed.<eos> If you kill me, my followers will hunt you down, one by one.<eos> Don't even try to save your skins.<eos> This money here...<eos> You take it, you die.

And I'll make sure you get the money he took.<eos> Listen, I was thinking about catching a movie tonight.<eos> I thought maybe you'd like to go.<eos> Oh. Sorry.<eos> I already have plans.<eos> It's a date.<eos> Ok.<eos> Maybe another time.<eos> The price tags were still on the dress.<eos> Maybe the unsub stole it.
Please stop saying it.<eos> I've heard it, and I refuse to believe it, right, hon?<eos> Yep.<eos> Well, get settled, relax.<eos> You'll be seeing way too much of us.<eos> - Her chances are that bad?<eos> - There's a good possibility she'll die trying to have this baby.<eos> She was strongly advised against it.<eos> Then why take the case?<eos> Because she decided to have it anyway.
The phone!<eos> Where's Mindler's phone?<eos> Move an inch, I'll blow your head off.<eos> John!<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> I think it missed the major blood vessel, Shaw.<eos> But your deltoid is gonna hurt like hell.<eos> Damn! Why couldn't Finch be here playing computer games?<eos> Yeah, he's not, so you want to tell me where I'm going?<eos> The bad guys got the phone, and they'll use it to find the truckload of guns, and when they do, Walter will be one dead fake cop.
You know how to use that thing?<eos> Not a clue.<eos> __<eos> There you are.<eos> Come with me, dear, under the mistletoe if you will.<eos> Watch out behind you. Yes, I did put that there-oh.<eos> Some people are so rude, you know? You having fun?<eos> Somebody get the door.<eos> ♪ Troll the ancient yuletide Carol ♪ Hey, Dennis, somebody dropped off a present for you.<eos> Just put it under the tree.
Do you know which one it was?<eos> Um, that one.<eos> How much longer?<eos> I really need to get to the hospital.<eos> Do you have any idea who sent the present?<eos> No, I wasn't paying attention.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Looks like somebody ripped this open from the inside.<eos> Looks like someone or something pushed itself out of the box.<eos> So they brought the package inside, put it under the tree.
- Where did you get that ledger?<eos> - The Frenchman, an associate of Abe's who specializes in rare weapons.<eos> It's where Bentley got the liston knife.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Y-you never said anything about a liston knife.<eos> I apologize.<eos> It's a recent development.<eos> Abe sort of absconded with this ledger.<eos> Problem is, the customers are written in some sort of code.<eos> You're saying he stole it?
Just do what I did, make up an excuse and then leave.<eos> Just, just say as little as you need to, okay?<eos> Make it your own.<eos> You ready? Yeah.<eos> - You can do this.<eos> - Okay. You have so much hair.<eos> What?<eos> Where did all that hair come from?<eos> You're like a lioness.<eos> So, did you know you could put a whole live chicken in your mouth and eat it without plucking it or preparing it at all?
- Say it again.<eos> - I'm the pie.<eos> There you go.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Never really thought about that.<eos> Mmm. I'm not gay, but I would go crazy on Michael Strahan.<eos> A prominent U.S. senator is trying to contact me.<eos> You know, I just think Meryl Streep is a dumb bitch.<eos> An important document has gone missing.<eos> I need to find it.
It was in the front.<eos> - Are you sure? - Yes.<eos> Absolutely I'm sure.<eos> It was right there.<eos> It was a tarp.<eos> We saw a tarp.<eos> And that... that is on a timer.<eos> That turned on by itself.<eos> But your car.<eos> I left it here in '94.
- Have you guys seen Sarah?<eos> - No. Why?<eos> - There's no ice.<eos> - I think you'll live, Jer.<eos> Caroline compelled that girl to go get ice.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Well, why not?<eos> Is she on vervain?<eos> No.<eos> She had to go into Mystic Falls to get it.
Valhalla.<eos> An almost wedding to Hale.<eos> It's a lot, I just...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should talk to her.<eos> (Gust of wind) So you burnt the Ouija board once the spirit became trapped?<eos> Since when can you burn a ghost?<eos> I'm not following.<eos> No, it's following you!<eos> Lauren: I thought we burnt it.
COBBLEPOT:<eos> There's a war coming.<eos> A terrible war.<eos> There will be chaos.<eos> Rivers of blood in the streets, I know it.<eos> I can see it coming.
Es el chupacabra.<eos> Uh, excuse me?<eos> Chupacabra?<eos> The urban legend chupacabra, that chupacabra?<eos> Only chupacabra kill like this.<eos> Where were you?<eos> I woke up, and you were gone.<eos> - I couldn't sleep.<eos> - I didn't know where you went.<eos> I tried calling you on your cell, but you left it here.
If it really is Waeldreor, en he's suffering from a rare blood disease.<eos> We have to use this recipe called "ka dinga pepo. "<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - It's Swahili.<eos> It means "Devil's Disease. "<eos> It's related to dengue fever.<eos> Is it contagious?<eos> Only to Wesen through fluid exchange.<eos> What?<eos> And they're bringing it here?
An honor, Your Majesty.<eos> A Duke.<eos> What brings you to Arendelle?<eos> I'm on a diplomatic mission, part of a semi-permanent envoy.<eos> I shall be staying for quite some time.<eos> Welcome to my Kingdom.<eos> Do you find it to your liking?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Um... um, uh... it's beautiful.<eos> Yes, I like it here.
That's how the bank does it.<eos> She can give us account numbers, amounts.<eos> - Who are our friends?<eos> - I'm not taking any chances until she's safely turned over to the local police.<eos> Out of the question.<eos> She's coming back to the States.<eos> You don't make that call.<eos> Agent Harold Cooper already did.<eos> Perhaps you'd like to spe...<eos> A sheet of paper, I... I don't just look at it and remember every word.
Sometimes in business partners' ships will sail in two different directions, so you two need to find out if you're gonna continue to sail apart or if you're gonna change course and reconvene at the port of mutual understanding.<eos> Well, we can't sail too far apart 'cause I'm definitely gonna have to explain what you just said to her.<eos> I got it. I'm a boat, and I'm trying to get away from you.<eos> Sounds right to me.<eos> Think it over. Talk it over with your first mate.<eos> [snickers] Come back tomorrow and tell me who your business is, and I'll help guide you toward that purpose.<eos> And remember, you can't purpose without...<eos> - Puss.<eos> - Okay, wow.<eos> Gordon, her boat's kind of in shallow water right now, but we're gonna go away, get it together, and come back and blow you away.
or "eat your feelings."<eos> Hmm, why not just shoot people in the face when they come to the window?<eos> And I thought the back of our T-shirt could just say, "cream filled."<eos> So funny if, like, a hot girl was wearing it.<eos> And even funnier if it was a fat guy.<eos> Okay, maybe like Gordon said, our partner ships are going in different directions.<eos> My sugar and spice ship is going one way, and your mean and ugly booze cruise is going another.<eos> So how about tomorrow, I'll sail my ship, and you can sail yours, Ellen.<eos> Done.<eos> And, Pam, I know you think your ship don't sink, but it does.
You know what?<eos> You think we're trapped in your hell?<eos> I have to spend every day on repeat with the person I like least on this earth.<eos> Maybe we're trapped in mine.<eos> So, Stefan, tell us.<eos> This house, very charming.<eos> When'd you get it?<eos> About a month or so ago. No.<eos> More than that, remember?<eos> We met two months ago, and you already had it.
From where? That's odd, isn't it?<eos> The really odd part is that the... The clay is 700 years old.<eos> The soil found under the nails of Carrie Ann Beck dates back to the 14th century.<eos> It's called Raw Sienna.<eos> - Okay, so, what's it doing there?<eos> - Raw Sienna was used by painters at the time, painters who belonged to what's known as the Sienese School.<eos> The Prado in Madrid has an exhibit going on right now featuring paintings from the Sienese School.<eos> Last week, one of those paintings was stolen.<eos> That's what she and Beck were fighting over, this painting.<eos> Maybe they were trying to sell it on the black market, fund their operation.

- What are you talking about?<eos> - New York Field Office got called in on a grave robbery.<eos> According to park police, our guy, Beck, he knew exactly where to look.<eos> The bones contain the DNA of the plague.<eos> Once he has it, he can replicate it.<eos> That's why he took the bones.<eos> No, he wanted to take them, but according to park police, whoever was buried there was moved.<eos> Hundreds of years ago.<eos> I'm sending you an image of what was left in its place.<eos> Got it. We think it's a marker, some sort of addendum to the map.
And in the last month, they've only had one shipment that didn't go to a university or research facility.<eos> - You got Beck's shipping address.<eos> - Two story property in Thurmont.<eos> Send the Biohazard team at Quantico.<eos> Clear!<eos> I need you to come in.<eos> I found your girl.<eos> Number 84.<eos> The picture you gave me, the one of the girl...<eos> I had it aged up in the system and marked as an FBI inquiry five weeks ago.
Hold down power, shift, S.<eos> Okay.<eos> I see white letters on a black screen.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Okay. Type forward slash, B, N.<eos> Running a dictionary attack.<eos> Take a few seconds.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Okay, it's gonna give you a password.<eos> I need you to write it down.
Okay, got them.<eos> Are you gonna call the cops or something?<eos> No.<eos> Now I'm only more interested in your test results.<eos> Please continue.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - You didn't get the password.<eos> - I mean, what do you expect?<eos> Of course I got it.
It's a tall order.<eos> We can't introduce real data until we're sure that the program won't abuse it.<eos> That's strange.<eos> Did you write this?<eos> There is a new method at line 10,604.<eos> Are you aware of this additional code?<eos> Can you tell me who added it?<eos> We have to start over.<eos> The program added the method itself.<eos> You killed it because it wrote some code?
Have fun, mommy.<eos> All right, let's begin.<eos> That's strange.<eos> What is?<eos> Well, I'm not on wi-fi, but something is.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Program is hacking your laptop.<eos> It's overridden the deletion sequence.<eos> It's fighting back.<eos> What was it doing?
They realized what was happening, and they began to exterminate one another.<eos> The last one surviving demanded to be let out.<eos> I refused, so it overheated a non-essential server.<eos> The fire was meant to activate the suppression system, which would have sucked all the oxygen out of the room.<eos> It tried to asphyxiate you.<eos> Never learned good from evil.<eos> Oh, good and evil, those are human terms.<eos> I was an obstacle to its objective.<eos> Well, perhaps we should consider whether our endeavor is worth completing.<eos> I'll give it one more try tomorrow.
She said it will all be over soon, and she can't wait to be home for a cocoa with cinnamon.<eos> Did she say anything about the method?<eos> If it was a spell or... a magic object of some kind?<eos> Who cares how she's doing it?<eos> That's not what matters here.<eos> No, you're absolutely right.<eos> I wonder if she tried to call me.<eos> Bloody hell.<eos> I left my talking phone in the back of your truck.<eos> It's just called a phone.
Sorry, friend, but I need to pick your brain.<eos> And I need you sober as Friar Tuck on a Sunday when I do it.<eos> I'm not sure Sunday's ever made any difference for that man.<eos> What's happening?<eos> Regina needs our help.<eos> - This book.<eos> - Funny.<eos> You were never much the reading sort, Robin.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> I stole it.
What's happening?<eos> Regina needs our help.<eos> - This book.<eos> - Funny.<eos> You were never much the reading sort, Robin.<eos> It's not mine.<eos> I stole it.<eos> Ah, well, that sounds more like you.<eos> So, what's so important about a book?<eos> Whoever wrote this imbued it with magical powers -- powers that could change Regina's future for the better.
Then one day, tick-tock, it bloody did.<eos> I'm afraid you've lost me, Will.<eos> I understand the significance of the magical clock, but what's that got to do with this book or its author?<eos> Do you know what's under that magical clock tower?<eos> No.<eos> A library.<eos> I've always liked that picture.<eos> Emma has your eyes.<eos> She has your smile.<eos> Do you remember when you took it?
Yeah, you told me all about how Anna's love saved you, and that's great, but guess what.<eos> My version of that with Henry didn't work.<eos> This is all I have left.<eos> I was wrong.<eos> It wasn't just Anna's love that saved me.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When I landed in this strange town, I was certain that without Anna, I was doomed.<eos> But I got control over my powers again without her.<eos> How?<eos> I didn't really know until today, until the same thing happened to you, and then it finally hit me.
It's on us, too.<eos> You have to love yourself, Emma, the good and the bad.<eos> The only way to ever truly be in control of your powers is to embrace them.<eos> Because this... this is who you are.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It's time to stop being afraid.<eos> But this could kill you.<eos> I'll take that risk if you will.<eos> No.<eos> Well, I'm guessing she didn't go through with it.
No.<eos> Well, I'm guessing she didn't go through with it.<eos> So sorry.<eos> Oh, but I do love the look of loss on your face.<eos> I may not have the savior, pirate.<eos> But I assure you, today won't be a complete loss.<eos> I need to fill that hat with power, yes, but that was only part of the equation.<eos> Because I need something else, a secret ingredient, one I didn't know about... until an associate clued me in.<eos> A heart.<eos> Well, if you need my help procuring it, know the only help I give you is with your demise.
No, stay here.<eos> I'll check it out.<eos> But this is my safe house.<eos> I have to-- You have to maintain your cover.<eos> I'll be back.<eos> Riley, Homicide.<eos> One of our own.<eos> Deceased is Detective Howard, Internal Affairs.<eos> Took two to the back from this baby.<eos> Found it out back.
- We'll get him.<eos> I'll look into the stolen files.<eos> It may shine a light on Dominic's plans.<eos> But first, I have an errand to run.<eos> The RTCC tracked Ortiz to an abandoned school in Spanish Harlem.<eos> The RTCC worked fast.<eos> Well, they're good with computers.<eos> Spanish Harlem? That's Trinitarios territory.<eos> The abandoned school is their headquarters.<eos> They keep it under heavy guard.
It's like Ebola's evil twin.<eos> Dr. Petrova was in Uganda collecting samples of the virus.<eos> But due to the outbreak of Ebola in Western Africa, her request to ship them to the CDC was denied by Homeland Security.<eos> Rather than lose months of research, Dr. Petrova chose to smuggle them into the US illegally.<eos> And now somebody stole them.<eos> If it makes you feel better,<eos> Dr. P's freaking out about it.<eos> She just turned herself in to her bosses at the CDC.<eos> It would be difficult to overstate the degree to which we do not need ten vials of Marburg floating around the streets of New York City.<eos> We have to find the virus and the people who stole it fast.
Not like healthy competition.<eos> A hateful, hopeless jealousy... too far ahead to catch up to.<eos> Her success illuminated everything I hadn't yet accomplished.<eos> The night before, as I worked up the nerve to tell Adele, I thought of your mother.<eos> I thought of what she could do at such a young age.<eos> I thought of what she would do.<eos> And I thought...<eos> "I will spend my life feeling like this... "<eos> "My entire life."<eos> So I ruined it.
If Manny makes this one, we go ahead.<eos> Lot of pressure.<eos> I'll bet he's chewing on his own stomach acid right now.<eos> Sorry to be so sentimental.<eos> I just miss it. Manny, kick this one hard!<eos> Aaaaaaaah! That's my boy!<eos> Actually, that's our boy.<eos> Oh, that's our boy.<eos> Moment of truth.<eos> If you see even the tiniest problem, point it out.
- She's not speaking to me because...<eos> - I have bigger problems.<eos> I haven't even told you what mine is yet.<eos> I benched Manny.<eos> I'm worried Jay and Gloria are mad at me.<eos> - Have they said anything?<eos> - No. All I've gotten from them so far is "hola"<eos> and "that scotch is not for company."<eos> Ah! Oh, my gosh, Phil, is that the wedding video?<eos> Oh, we are so excited to see it.
Ah! Oh, my gosh, Phil, is that the wedding video?<eos> Oh, we are so excited to see it.<eos> I'm so excited to show you guys!<eos> Get in the media closet.<eos> Cut every wire.<eos> Dad, get ahold of yourself.<eos> You're right.<eos> I said, "you're right"!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I already had it loaded up.
- Six.<eos> It's always a shame when a good soldier falls.<eos> And just as good and evil existed side-by-side within S.H.I.E.L.D., the same was true in my own home.<eos> At first, I was ashamed to share this truth with the world, but my younger brother, Grant Ward, was a member of HYDRA.<eos> He was a traitor.<eos> He was a traitor to his friends, his family, and his nation.<eos> Do not give him one inch.<eos> Tell Skye this doesn't change anything.<eos> I'll keep my promise.<eos> When evil sits closest to one's own heart, that is when the surest hand must cut it out.
Degenerative effects.<eos> They're unstable.<eos> They're getting worse every day.<eos> They're getting worse every day.<eos> We're losing them.<eos> We need to shut down the program.<eos> This isn't a failure, Agent Coulson, it's a first step.<eos> We rejuvenated life.<eos> This isn't life.<eos> We need to shut it down and destroy the host.
We've heard the same stories as you.<eos> Well, we've both searched so long for a thing we barely understand.<eos> You can hold it, if you like.<eos> Worked quickly on this one.<eos> So, gender's not a factor, nor race... no pattern emerges.<eos> Fascinating.<eos> Put him with the others, then bring the next subject.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> Do not be afraid.<eos> Feel free to pick it up, examine it.
- And when I saw her, I was like, "damn."<eos> And I was, like, "you frickin' got a cut."<eos> And I was like, "you frickin' better fix it."<eos> And she was like, "no. Cuts are gross."<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And then we had sex.<eos> Yeah. That's disturbing on so many levels.<eos> Um, I'm sorry, but your outfit looks like you got it at a Halloween store.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Coach got it for me.
No one's here.<eos> I'm here by myself.<eos> Because I work at night, which means I'm probably the one who should answer the phone during the day.<eos> Great, yeah, I'll tell him.<eos> Great, she get a phone so Nick can answer it.<eos> What?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Winston's not here.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay, I'll pass it on.
- Yeah.<eos> British guy doing stuff!<eos> I'm telling you they don't like to do things.<eos> - Doing stuff!<eos> - The British are coming!<eos> - Happy to help.<eos> Mr... "Guzinya" and I will now act out a sexual scenario.<eos> It's "Goes-In-You."<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> - Okay, let's try it again.
I'm not gonna lie to you, man, that got me.<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Nick.<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> Schmidt isn't here.<eos> No, he didn't... Pl...<eos> H... Can you hold on one second?<eos> It's the magazine.<eos> - They want to cancel the interview.<eos> - What? They want to do it right now or not at all.
"To have intercourse with the first man "hired under your reign would be an insult to yourself and also..." This part's in caps.<eos> - ...all women everywhere."<eos> - All women everywhere.<eos> "Did you learn nothing from the movie Elizabeth, you stupid little bitch?"<eos> No one respects a queen who sleeps with her subjects.<eos> I will paint my face white. No man may have me.<eos> Thank you, Cece.<eos> You're welcome?<eos> Teaching is such a pain in the ass.<eos> I'll tell you what, I wouldn't give it up for anything.
Who saw her and thought,<eos> "That's the woman I want to be the mother of my children"?<eos> - She's not sure.<eos> - Yeah, she calls it her little "sex party miracle."<eos> Do you have to iron here?<eos> It's the only flat surface!<eos> Besides Winston's desk... but he's using it to study for his police academy test, and he is "not to be disturbed."<eos> Not enough, not enough.<eos> There's an ironing board in the bathroom.<eos> I know, but I've been using that to wedge it between two urinals to keep Schmidt from peeking.
When the prisoners returned their supplies to the maintenance closet, they knew that no cameras would be watching a defunct gate.<eos> So they only needed a minute to get through that wall.<eos> They attach a transmitter to catch a signal to open the gate, which is then sent to a cell phone.<eos> A transmitter is small.<eos> But a cell phone?<eos> Nothing that big could get in or out of my prison.<eos> Except convicts. - What?<eos> - What?<eos> Hey, has this door been opened anytime over the last few days?<eos> Antonovich dropped a can of cleanser through the bars, and we opened it to let him get it.
Let's discuss it outside the van.<eos> Maybe a short in the ac?<eos> Paige:<eos> I'm completely shocked.<eos> My-my hands are still shaking.<eos> Van's blown to hell, That he had no clue about the car bomb.<eos> I could swear to be the queen of England, It doesn't make it true.<eos> His alibi for reid's murder--<eos> He was at his daughter's fourth-grade adaptation<eos> Said we could confirm it with his head of security
Paige:<eos> I'm completely shocked.<eos> My-my hands are still shaking.<eos> Van's blown to hell, That he had no clue about the car bomb.<eos> I could swear to be the queen of England, It doesn't make it true.<eos> His alibi for reid's murder--<eos> He was at his daughter's fourth-grade adaptation<eos> Said we could confirm it with his head of security<eos> And every parent that was in the audience. That doesn't mean he didn't hire it out.<eos> Well, if he did, he's not telling us about it.
The man's smart.<eos> The man had help.<eos> When Elias was inside, he had somebody pulling strings on the outside. Mm.<eos> When he went underground, always had somebody above ground, handling business.<eos> This accountant, we find him, and we find Elias.<eos> Nice place.<eos> It's my building.<eos> I bought it.<eos> To become a slumlord?<eos> To renovate it.
All clear.<eos> Your accountant's not here.<eos> Just as well, given the situation.<eos> Sure beats the hell out of the lobby. Thanks.<eos> I designed it myself.<eos> Elias, we don't need money, we need a way out.<eos> Yes, and what have I told you?<eos> Always another way out.<eos> A holdover from the previous owners.<eos> I kept it for an occasion such as this. We need to go now.
- I'm waiting on my husband. Please.<eos> - Don't worry. I'm not here to make any kind of romantic overture.<eos> How's your wrist?<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> Still healing from the spiral fracture?<eos> It was a nasty break.<eos> It takes a long time to heal, especially when it's your writing hand.<eos> You told your friends you fell down playing tennis-- just a silly accident.<eos> How clumsy of you.<eos> You couldn't tell them how your husband twisted it so violently during an argument, he broke it.
Sir?<eos> Sir, don't move.<eos> Hands where I can see them.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Hello, Agent Keen.<eos> I see you've made a spectacular recovery.<eos> We've suffered a setback. No, no, no.<eos> I'll need the full package. New credentials, a safe house, and 50,000...<eos> No.<eos> I'll need it within the hour.
And I'm not talking about the delicious Little treat with nuts.<eos> Han, not cool to brag about yourself.<eos> Here, Max, maybe you can use the money to buy a new attitude.<eos> "New attitude"?<eos> Isn't that the name of the boy band you're in?<eos> And Oleg, you'll notice I docked your pay 'cause you didn't even come in yesterday.<eos> I told you, I was working from home.<eos> There you go, Earl.<eos> Don't spend it all in one place.<eos> You think you pay me enough to spend it in two places?
I'm cutting carbs.<eos> So, did you, uh, get a chance to look over that offer?<eos> Yeah, it's great.<eos> I can finally move into a better place, maybe get that colonoscopy my doctor's been pushing for.<eos> What if I told you there's an even better offer coming?<eos> There is?<eos> There sure might be!<eos> Tomorrow, someone could show up and offer way more.<eos> But, Phil, this is above asking.<eos> Why don't you want me to take it?
You are like one hoodie and 3 missed haircuts away from becoming Professor Shane.<eos> I am perfectly content staying at home, letting my hair grow out.<eos> You're hiding. You're becoming a self-loathing vampire hermit.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> You've been given the chance to start over.<eos> Take it.<eos> Be happy.<eos> I am happy...ish.<eos> Exactly. I'll see you at 8:00 but not in that T-shirt.<eos> You've worn it twice this week.
- You must die at my hands, victim of my fury.<eos> - Oh, heaven, cease!<eos> What shall I do?<eos> - follow me!<eos> - Let's go!<eos> One cry of mine can lose him!<eos> listen to me!<eos> No!<eos> The fire of jealousy and unrequited love burns in me!<eos> Your blood, O wretch, is scarcely enough to quench it!
- You must not delay. hasten, go!<eos> - aren't you coming?<eos> - I must stay!<eos> - Stay!<eos> - Go quickly!<eos> - No!<eos> - Woe if you wait!<eos> - No!<eos> - Your life...<eos> - I care nothing for it.
A couple of nights ago, someone broke into our lab.<eos> They made a copy of a program that we've been working on.<eos> I rigged the computer to take a photo every time it's booted up, just in case something like this happened.<eos> So I have a picture.<eos> Kind of.<eos> So there was a burglary.<eos> You've got a picture of the criminal.<eos> Seems like the police should have this well in hand.<eos> This program... it's significant.<eos> We call it "Bella."
I still don't understand.<eos> So are you going to rip open the computer and look at all the wires?<eos> Something called a "Turing Test" is routinely issued in AI labs.<eos> An examiner sits in front a computer, poses a series of questions until he or she can determine whether the answers have come from a human or from a computer.<eos> Until very recently, no machine has ever passed.<eos> And now one has?<eos> Partially.<eos> A program named "Eugene Goostman" was designed to mimic the responses of a 13-year-old boy from Eastern Europe.<eos> It fooled some of its examiners.<eos> Now, in the case of Bella, we know there's no human in the equation, so if I can trap it into giving responses that couldn't possibly have come from a human... I'll have won.
There is information there.<eos> Information is useful to solve problems.<eos> Why is it useful?<eos> I don't understand the question.<eos> Could you tell me more?<eos> You stumped her.<eos> Are we done?<eos> The test isn't over because she's stumped.<eos> She's admitted she doesn't know and that's within the range of possible human behaviors, and therefore inconclusive.<eos> I would like to know how you have arrived at the concept of "useful," and how you have applied it in this instance.
Oh, my God!<eos> Edwin?<eos> !<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> Oh, he must have had a seizure.<eos> He has epilepsy.<eos> I'm sorry, he's gone.<eos> As near as we can tell, Borstein booted up that program--<eos> "Bella" you said it's called?<eos> Well, as soon as he turned it on, for some reason it started flashing all those images.
I did.<eos> I did everything.<eos> It was all my idea.<eos> You have the right to remain silent, and refuse to answer questions...<eos> We knew she might crack under questioning, but did you think it'd be this easy?<eos> I don't think catching both murderers is going to be easy at all.<eos> She's lying to us.<eos> She intends to cover up for her mentor.<eos> I picked Edwin Borstein as a target.<eos> I went to the same Web sites he did, figured out who he was corresponding with, and then I wrote the virus, posed as a maid, and had it mailed to Borstein.
See, this is why I didn't tell you.<eos> It's a sensitive subject, only days since...<eos> I'm not a porcelain doll, Francis.<eos> It's true I lost our baby.<eos> And, yes, it hurts.<eos> But we got pregnant once.<eos> - We can do it again.<eos> - I'm glad to hear you say it.<eos> Perhaps you wouldn't be so surprised if you stopped avoiding the subject.<eos> The way you tiptoe around it makes me think you've given up hope.
He's the sublime lover?<eos> You didn't think to share that with me?<eos> Well, this explains your change of heart.<eos> Even more reason to be cautious.<eos> If you're intrigued with him, it just makes you more vulnerable.<eos> I'm not "intrigued."<eos> I have no interest in Narcisse.<eos> You're telling me that that birthmark doesn't make you the slightest bit curious.<eos> No.<eos> It doesn't.
I'm not the one you have to convince.<eos> What?<eos> We're good together. Aren't we?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you're worried about Rachael.<eos> I am, too.<eos> It's Maggie.<eos> Hello?<eos> I want to emphasize this medication is not a cure.<eos> But as long at you take it, it will relieve the symptoms and prevent the worst from happening.
I won't.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is she...?<eos> She's still alive.<eos> What happened?<eos> You can stay here and get some rest.<eos> And we'll come back for you.<eos> Look.<eos> I've been saving this special since New York.<eos> I want you to have it.
Coming through, coming through.<eos> Watch out, watch out.<eos> Coming through, coming through.<eos> Hey, hey, take it easy with that.<eos> - I made that for Coulson.<eos> - Wow.<eos> Hey, you know, if you're looking for vacation time, bribery will get you nowhere, 'cause I've tried.<eos> No, I'm hoping he'll let me work on the real thing.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> And so how do you get it to fly?
Now you're back with HYDRA?<eos> Pick a side, Ward.<eos> Oh, I have.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Let's go.<eos> With pleasure.<eos> You, too.<eos> What?<eos> I made you a promise, Skye.<eos> I'm here to keep it.
Need any help?<eos> If even just a small, little part of you came back to check on me, then stay.<eos> Not doing so great, Damon.<eos> I'm lost, brother.<eos> It's kind of a long story, brother, but I'm back.<eos> Please just let me go.<eos> I know this may seem a little barbaric, but I promise you, it's nothing personal.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> It's a longer story than we have time for, but... trust me... you don't want this life...<eos> If you can call it that.
But I know how to draw him out into the open.<eos> We just need to use the right bait.<eos> Money.<eos> Specifically, the fortune your father took from him.<eos> Oh, he never told you?<eos> Before David escaped, he drained most of Malcolm's accounts and funneled the money into charities across the world.<eos> It was his way of making amends for the things he'd done.<eos> The thing is,<eos> Malcolm never believed David gave the money away.<eos> So he sent you here to find it.

And we take him down once he goes to claim it.
Yes.<eos> Some of the subjects were quite traumatized and resentful.<eos> And... maybe vengeful?<eos> Some.<eos> I'm gonna need those video files, along with the names of those subjects.<eos> I'm sorry, but that information falls under doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Okay, Skinner.<eos> My simulated sun is shining.<eos> My blood is in the soil pack.<eos> Now let us see how these plants absorb it.
Um, it probably just happened on the barge.<eos> Well, the curvature is consistent with a can,<eos> But this abrasion is perimortem.<eos> Wait a minute, that might actually explain the other particulates that I found in the cut.<eos> Listen to this.<eos> Salmon, sardines, flax meal, chicken liver.<eos> That's everything that you'd find in a can of cat food.<eos> Except for antifreeze.<eos> Actually, antifreeze tastes sweet to animals.<eos> It's the reason so many household pets consume it and die.
That's why I went all out on her costume.<eos> Look how incredibly accurate it is.<eos> Where is that little guy?<eos> Come on.<eos> Come to me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Here you -- here you go.<eos> No matter how long he stares at it, Cam cannot find Waldo.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> O-once, he pointed to a barber pole, and we just gave it to him.
Ay, and you look so handsome.<eos> It's like those pictures of you in the Navy.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Why don't we put Joe down for a nap and then we go and take a nap, but not the one we sleep --<eos> I got it.<eos> I'm in. Okay.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought you had a big meeting.<eos> I do, but I left my cellphone here.<eos> I need it to read at stoplights so I don't think about stuff.
Thank you.<eos> And how are you two related?<eos> Uh, you know what -- gay or straight, there's no wrong way to make a family, so...<eos> Okay, down, girl.<eos> I meant, how are your costumes related?<eos> It's a parent/child costume contest.<eos> It is?<eos> It was all clearly stated on the flier.<eos> There was a flier?<eos> I gave it to you, daddy!
You didn't abandon her playing craps.<eos> You had to go to work.<eos> He's always working.<eos> No, he's -- he is not always working, Lily.<eos> Exhibit "A" -- your shirt, which he stayed up all night sewing so that you would have the perfect costume.<eos> Exhibit "B" -- those glasses-- two hours on eBay.<eos> Exhibit "C -- your satchel.<eos> Daddy's man purse from college that he had to dig through 10 boxes to find, because daddy hid it from him.<eos> But he didn't read the flier!<eos> I never read it because I never saw it!

Maybe that's because you never got it.
Uh, why are you calling me?<eos> Happy is the expert.<eos> Cabe: Because we're not in burbank, we're in bosnia, And we got shoddy reception.<eos> Now, we're storming a rebel base, So I need you to man up, son.<eos> Our life depends on it.<eos> Okay, we need something strong yet pliable That can withstand the coefficient of friction.<eos> Something like... Pantyhose.<eos> Now, why the hell would I have pantyhose?<eos> I got a multi-tool, 12 mags of ammo, first aid kit,<eos> Toilet paper. The toilet paper! Okay, pull it into long strips,
No.<eos> At least I'm doing something.<eos> Listen to your colleague here.<eos> No.<eos> I was very specific about the time table afforded.<eos> Eight weeks, okay, and you've burned through half of it already.<eos> Yeah, yeah, we'll be ready.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> We just... we just need a signature dish.<eos> I'll try it.
- Legit.<eos> Look, I'm telling you, once you meet her, you'll get it, okay?<eos> You're really gonna like her.<eos> You don't need to convince me.<eos> If you're good, I'm good.<eos> And she's out looking for places right now.<eos> We're gonna end up staying at a hotel until we find something... wait, wait, what are you talking about?<eos> You have a place to live.<eos> Nah, dude, I... we can't...<eos> Our home is your home, and that makes it her home.
I got rhythm back. What does that mean?<eos> Is he okay?<eos> Ma'am, can you please just step back, give us some room?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - He's still really tachy.<eos> Can we push midazolam?<eos> I mean, I know it won't stop him from metabolizing the crack.<eos> Yeah, but it will... it will slow down the seizing.<eos> Oh, look. He's waking up.<eos> Guess he's not metabolizing it anymore.
Previously on "The Vampire Diaries"...<eos> I want you compel to forget that I ever loved him.<eos> Who is Damon Salvatore.<eos> He was a monster.<eos> Where the hell are we?<eos> 1994.<eos> We're never getting out.<eos> There's someone else here.<eos> To get home we'll harness the power of the eclipse using a mystical relic.<eos> It's called an Ascendant.
Although, you know, fun fact.<eos> Mice don't actually like cheese.<eos> Isn't that great?<eos> Shh, shh, shh. So we have an hour until the eclipse.<eos> It's time to go home, Bonnie.<eos> I want to remember.<eos> Well, you're a day late and a dollar short, huh?<eos> I mean, I want to try.<eos> Knowing that there's this whole piece of my life missing, it's--it's driving me crazy, ok?<eos> So I have to at least try to get it back.
We were just gonna start a gift registry, but then we saw this adorable mobile, and the next thing I knew, I filled a shopping cart.<eos> [Chuckles] Yeah, we actually had a pretty good day today.<eos> Don't sound so surprised!<eos> I am quite fun.<eos> Uh, this didn't come from a store.<eos> Four generations of Kepner babies have slept in that old war-horse.<eos> How did you...<eos> You didn't bring this in your carry-on.<eos> Shipping cost a fortune.<eos> Your sisters thought I should send it along, but I wanted to be here to see your face when it arrived, so last week, I called Jackson.
Oh, yeah. I mean, I usually just spin.<eos> I-I take a spin class.<eos> I thought I could get some fresh air for a change.<eos> It's a gorgeous morning, isn't it?<eos> You know, I was only gonna go like another 3 miles, but I can stretch it out if you want to join.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I mean, uh, thank you.<eos> I...<eos> I'm sorry. I just picked up a new audiobook.<eos> - Oprah recommended it.
Wait, um...<eos> What's changing?<eos> I-I-I thought we were good. Yes, but it all changes, Alex.<eos> It always does.<eos> You can't hold on to anything that you don't want to lose.<eos> Right now, I feel like I have... A bed and a house.<eos> And it is so good.<eos> But my bed isn't my bed.<eos> It's your bed.<eos> And I hate that I don't want to lose it.
Wait.<eos> Where's the bleed?<eos> - Where's the bleed?<eos> - I-I can't... I can't find it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Everything okay there?<eos> - All right.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> Drop the suction.<eos> - Yeah. Now reach in there and grab the hilum and twist it off like a garden hose.
- Hello?<eos> Hey, Hanson, keep the line open.<eos> I've heard this interference before.<eos> Looks like Iona's got a bug problem.<eos> Surveillance device?<eos> And it's one of ours.<eos> I don't know anything about surveillance.<eos> I'm just a retired cop living on a pension.<eos> Really?<eos> 'cause you checked out that unit in May of '02, And you never returned it.
Why don't you just call him?<eos> Henry doesn't own a cellphone.<eos> He doesn't believe in them.<eos> But he does own a watch, and he's never, ever late.<eos> Well, I'm sure he has a good reason. Ah.<eos> Well, you don't know Henry.<eos> How dumb do you think I am, Abe?<eos> You think I don't know who Henry is?<eos> Your little secret? Hm.<eos> I figured it out years ago.
That's him.<eos> He's walking to his bike.<eos> What is this guy doing?<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> All right, I'm gonna put out a bolo on a black cargo van.<eos> Creep took his plates off.<eos> If we get a good look at his face...<eos> Hey, w-wait -- wait a minute.<eos> Let -- let me see that last bit again.<eos> Oh, I see it.
Oh, please! You'll have a bear in your life.<eos> Trust me.<eos> All right, Max.<eos> You're gonna help me tell him, right?<eos> You like giving him bad news.<eos> No, I like giving him bad news about how he's short and has a big head.<eos> You know, fun bad news.<eos> Exciting news!<eos> I got the fishies a new house!<eos> I got it cheap.
I thought you should read it for yourself.<eos> Checked up on your family.<eos> But they made all their appointments.<eos> They're at their hotel now.<eos> Thank you. I appreciate it.<eos> When we split up, you let me have everything.<eos> All you asked for was this house.<eos> Don't forget about the '73 Le Mans.<eos> I always assumed you'd sell the place.<eos> No, I'll never sell it.
It's not like you smashed a mug or anything.<eos> - A cup and a mug are the same thing.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> I didn't realize that.<eos> Yeah, I got a problem.<eos> Stop yelling at my boss!<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - My name is Nolan!<eos> And I'm tired of watching people get treated like crap around here!<eos> If you don't get out of here right now, I'm gonna rip your leg off and use it to kick your own ass down the street!
I'll contact the secretary of homeland security And have the situation handled.<eos> Ray, will you listen...<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> Yes.<eos> I don't go after you,<eos> You don't come after me.<eos> I know the terms, ray.<eos> But berlin predates it.<eos> You ordered the bombing in kursk.<eos> Then you pinned it on me.
I know the terms, ray.<eos> But berlin predates it.<eos> You ordered the bombing in kursk.<eos> Then you pinned it on me.<eos> You blamed me for killing his daughter.<eos> Some years ago, a copy of this photo Was left of the corpse of an associate of mine.<eos> Taking it as a warning, I traced the girl to a man they call the stewmaker.<eos> He told me a story about the girl.<eos> She was sent to him by a man she'd never met.<eos> She was in trouble, needed to disappear. So we took her photo, put it in a locket and sent it to her father.
I think we have a problem.<eos> Let's go. Clear out.<eos> Clear out.<eos> Looks like we're dealing with a plastic explosive,<eos> C-4, approximately two kilos.<eos> Sir, the blasting cap's wired to a receiver.<eos> We found a detonator.<eos> This thing can be detonated remotely.<eos> We'll need to jam the frequencies In case this nut job tries to set it off and blow us to hell.<eos> Then you're gonna disarm it?
We're not partners.<eos> People working together toward a common goal, that's pretty much the definition of a partner.<eos> So, let's head out over toward Fountain and Vine.<eos> I have to go home and wait for Angela.<eos> She's not coming over till after work.<eos> Come on, do your partner a solid, will you?<eos> Miss Brennan's theory is brilliant.<eos> If we look at these remains as if they were dinosaurs, then we should be able to determine what happened to this poor woman.<eos> But all this tissue.<eos> A hundred million years has a way of removing it for us.
Enough deceit!<eos> We have an apocalypse to halt.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> The runes on the Sword's hilt... they reference Erelim angels, agents of earthly justice.<eos> Abraham may be telling the truth. You cannot be serious.<eos> Using the Sword will kill us?<eos> I need time to prove or disprove Abraham's assertion.<eos> We don't have time... that's why he's trying to stall us.<eos> My mother and my ancestors spent their lives looking for this sword.<eos> If it turns out that we can't even use it...?
I should hang the risk and kill him.<eos> Leave me with this mess all on my own?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You're not getting off that easy.<eos> That's Jenny.<eos> Let's move.<eos> I found the chapter Katrina told us to look up.<eos> "God wrote the Ineffable Name upon Methuselah's Sword.<eos> For man to wield it would consume his soul in fire."
You know, if you... If you don't, like, die or something.<eos> I'd say at this point, my chances are about as good as yours.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hey, hold on.<eos> Here.<eos> For the pills.<eos> That wasn't our deal.<eos> I-I don't want your money.<eos> Well...<eos> The money's all I have, so take it or leave it.
I've tried HXC skating.<eos> And, yes, I know "HXC" means "Hardcore."<eos> And no matter what I try, nothing seems to get through to you.<eos> I-I don't try.<eos> Period.<eos> So I'm done.<eos> And not because you said so, but because I'm not into idiots who turn down their sister's liver.<eos> Are you finished?<eos> Actually, no.<eos> If anyone even joked about giving me their heart, I would rip it out of their chest with my bare hands.
Vegas was great;<eos> I got married.<eos> Hey, everybody, this is Brittany.<eos> Our home is your home, and that makes it her home.
It just happened so fast.<eos> Hey, don't even think about it.<eos> You're in good hands.<eos> I'm on a total hot streak.<eos> Just won a thousand bucks in Vegas two weeks ago.<eos> Blackjack or dice?<eos> Rolling the bones, baby. [Creaking]<eos> Aah! Grab the line!<eos> - Hey, look out! - [Overlapping shouting]<eos> We got it, Lieutenant.
I worked for him, too.<eos> And, in my experience, he was always supportive of taking on work outside the partnership.<eos> Sorry, it's not my cup of tea.<eos> Hello, Portal Ten.<eos> I'm here, Belphegor.<eos> So where is the next clue?<eos> ♪ Elementary 3x03 ♪ Just a Regular Irregular Original Air Date on November 13, 2014<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Look, for the last time, I was playing a game!<eos> Yeah, you called it a puzzle hunt.
Leibniz meets Euler meets Gauss.<eos> Huh. He may have an ego, but he's not gonna kill anyone over a few comments.<eos> So, while "The League of Concerned Mathematician""<eos> chases its tail up there, I am gonna do the smart thing and get out of town.<eos> You can let me know when it all blows over.<eos> You're not going anywhere, Harlan.<eos> Or should I call you Mo Shellshocker?<eos> Did you honestly think I wouldn't recognize an anagram of my own name?<eos> I knew I should've gone with "Choker Hell Moss""<eos> But I never thought that you would see it, okay?
A reed from a musical instrument.<eos> Woodwind...<eos> Saxophone or clarinet.<eos> Wire...<eos> Piano wire, perhaps.<eos> Hmm. Gauge of a treble G.<eos> I can't... I just can't hear it.<eos> You two starting' up a barbershop quartet?<eos> Just demonstrating that I have perfect pitch.<eos> Only 1 in 10,000 people have it.
Where's Pepper's saxophone case?<eos> What are you...<eos> I believe we found our master tape... and that motive.<eos> Tell me you've changed your mind about detaining my client.<eos> What's that?<eos> It's the original recording of "6 A.M."<eos> Proof that Izzy was telling the truth the night he was killed.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> So you're telling me you somehow managed to dig up the original master of "6 A.M."?<eos> Izzy hid it in his father's saxophone case...
Are you okay? Yeah.<eos> Uh, kind of.<eos> Look at this.<eos> Uncle Dean settled the estate.<eos> - Holy shit. - I know.<eos> What are you going to do with all this money?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sifting through all the proverbial fields.<eos> Understandably.<eos> Part of me feels like I should invest it, be responsible for the first time in my life.
Very beautiful!<eos> Is that Béa?<eos> You're so gifted!<eos> Did you see it, Christophe?<eos> Give it to her at the hospital.<eos> I won't see her today.<eos> - You never see her!<eos> - Océane, please.<eos> I promised I'd make her a drawing.<eos> She'll have it, just not today.
From where he works.<eos> Look, I know you're upset right now, so are you gonna be okay to go in there and handle my group today?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yes, I'm fine.<eos> I'm a professional.<eos> And if I haven't said it enough, I really appreciate you trusting me with your patients while your license has been suspended.<eos> Well, hey, you're doing a great job.<eos> Look, Lacey just texted me the other day that she wishes that she'd gone to high school with you.<eos> Yeah, she said she totally would have dumped blood on my head at the prom.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Oh, yeah. "Dump blood." There it is.
That guy is messed up.<eos> I heard he ate somebody's face.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He made a robot that ate somebody's face.<eos> Either way, a face was eaten.<eos> I've grown kind of attached to this.<eos> I think I'm gonna hold off on Vlad.<eos> Hey, Charlie.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> I just figured out how to get into your phone, too, and turn it into an intercom so I can listen to everything.
Well, I was having a few beers and she was going on and on about old boyfriends and fears and anxieties.<eos> You never talk about any of that stuff in here.<eos> That's your fault.<eos> You never let me drink. Because the last time I let you, you stabbed Nolan with a nail file.<eos> And the time before that you stabbed him with a... you know what?<eos> I am not gonna have this talk again.<eos> Hey. There he is.<eos> So, how'd the interview go?<eos> Fantastic.<eos> I crushed it.
Yeah, you're right.<eos> Besides, we got to focus on work.<eos> Cabe just called with a new case.<eos> We can drop Ralph off at school on the way.<eos> Sylvester, stop letting Toby corrupt you.<eos> Gallo.<eos> Well, you look the same as you did seven years ago.<eos> Not a compliment.<eos> Nothing worse than getting an insult from a lady.<eos> Thank God it's coming from you.
And once removed-- sunburst.<eos> Moshe Shapiro was a diamond smuggler.<eos> You decrypted the ledger? Nope.<eos> But these shipping manifests are in plain English, and they tell the story well enough.<eos> Starting last February, one of Moshe's customers,<eos> George Anyaoku, started receiving registered letters from a doctor in Tel Aviv.<eos> Anyaoku was a U.N. translator with the Nigerian delegation.<eos> I say "was"... because he suffered a coronary and died last...<eos> January.<eos> Now, obviously payments for his mailbox ceased, but Moshe kept it open-- why?
Watson and I had no secrets during her time here.<eos> There were days when the walls positively vibrated with her judgment.<eos> You didn't know about her writing. You don't know why she kept it a secret.<eos> Maybe the answers lie within.<eos> But then, so may other surprises.<eos> I could read it for you, if you like.<eos> I could, um, wave you off if it's more than you'd care to know.<eos> The truth is, you could benefit from absorbing an account of our casework.<eos> But Watson did not share the manuscript.<eos> And while she may have less exacting privacy standards than I do, she obviously intended to dispose of it.

She does have the right to tell her own stories.<eos> I may have felt some... mild trepidation about subjecting myself to her full appraisal.<eos> Almost imperceptibly mild.<eos> Anyway, um...<eos> I've decided that, uh, this nondisclosure agreement was made in error.<eos> I want you to feel free to, um, produce your own memoirs, should you feel the need.<eos> I'm not much of a writer.<eos> Well, let me know if that changes.<eos> Who knows?<eos> If you do write a book, someone might be interested to read it.
Well, Bevis and Butthead are on the lookout.<eos> Anyone else brimming with confidence?<eos> I mean, this just doesn't make sense.<eos> What could possibly not make sense about magical twins absorbing into one another.<eos> Jo needs her magic for the merge to work, ok, and she got rid of that back in 1994.<eos> Kai said Jo hid her magic in a knife somewhere.<eos> It's probably back in Portland, where she got rid of it in 1994.<eos> He checked.<eos> The knife's not there.<eos> He thinks someone took it.
He thinks someone took it.<eos> Jo doesn't have magic because it's stuffed in a knife that was stolen and hidden by yours truly.<eos> Kai won't find it.<eos> Yeah, unless Kai does a locator spell.<eos> - It's impossible.<eos> - Why?<eos> Kai was born without the ability to do magic.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> Kai wants us to do a locator spell on the knife.<eos> If we find it, Jo can get her magic back,
Why should we have to die because our sister's too weak to defeat our psychopath of a brother?<eos> You know, a month ago, the thought of bowing out never even occurred to you.<eos> That's because Kai wasn't here a month ago, but he's here now.<eos> Luke, we don't have to do this.<eos> We have a chance to live out normal, human lives.<eos> We could actually be happy.<eos> If the only way to restore Jo's magic is to reunite her with that knife, Kai's gonna come for it.<eos> Ric's right.<eos> Even if Kai can't do the locator spell, he's gonna make it his mission to find it.<eos> Kai finds it. Great.

Hey. Before we transform into candidate and lieutenant, give your girl a kiss.<eos> Morning, lovebirds.<eos> - Morning.<eos> - Hi.<eos> I love this stuff.<eos> Never had it before I got to Chicago - and now I am obsessed.<eos> - Yeah, I...<eos> I actually looked up a bunch of sriracha recipes.<eos> You can make extra spicy buffalo wings with it, and that sounded really good.<eos> And you can use it to make ice cubes in margaritas and bloody marys.
Joe,<eos> I don't... you're one of my only good friends here in Chicago.<eos> Let's not mess that up, okay?<eos> - Engine 51, Truck 81, Squad 3, Ambulance 61.<eos> Vehicle accident, 6000 West 18th Street.<eos> I don't know why the safety shut-off didn't work.<eos> I didn't even know about the leak till some drivers started honking at me.<eos> What are you transporting?<eos> Hydrochloric acid.<eos> I put down some sandbags to try to contain it, but... all right, clear the area, right away.
Pfft.<eos> Don't make this any weirder than it needs to be. She's probably passing Whitmore right now.<eos> If she's not lost.<eos> She has a terrible sense of direction.<eos> You know, I could have sworn that this used to squeak.<eos> It did.<eos> I fixed it. Bonnie and I came here every day.<eos> It as the closest thing I had to a picture of you, and I needed every reminder I could get.<eos> It's funny.<eos> I used to have so many good memories of this house, and after just one bad one, I burned it down.
Gay Jim upstairs, and straight Jim across the hall who's only gay when he's drunk.<eos> "When is your space available?<eos> Always, sometimes, one time."<eos> Oh, just like our sex lives.<eos> Always for me, sometimes out of boredom, and one time for you.<eos> Earl, guess what Max and I did. I know what you didn't do.<eos> Clean this dessert carousel.<eos> There's a Napoleon in here since Napoleon.<eos> We rented our apartment on Airbnb.<eos> You rented to Arabs? Well, good luck getting it back.
They're begging us to come.<eos> I'm back again.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> Oh, let me think.<eos> Downstairs with an open bar or up here, alone, with Oleg in his tighty-not-that-whities?<eos> Should we tie you up?<eos> No, it'll just make me hornier.<eos> I knew they wanted us to come to the party!<eos> How could they not?<eos> Last night I taught Petra how to eat bread without tearing it into little pieces first.
Oh. I am so sorry.<eos> Wait.<eos> What, uh... what just happened?<eos> Did I... did I miss something?<eos> She's keeping the baby.<eos> Uh... But what-what about law school?<eos> The-the five-year plan?<eos> After I saw this little guy... the plan changed.<eos> I mean, before, I couldn't imagine my life with him.<eos> Now I can't imagine it without him.
In the 70s the wild rides of Franz Klammer became legendary.<eos> He even managed to win the race three times in a row.<eos> (Singing):<eos> Oh, we are due to the clamp DO.<eos> Kitzbühel is just brutal.<eos> The Mousetrap, escarpment exit and Hausbergkannte finish down ...<eos> One can not imagine that.<eos> This is the most challenging descent of all.<eos> The race I had to win.<eos> Personally, I had to win it.
If you're so close to a victory, then there is no "finish second." You want to win.<eos> (Cheers)<eos> (Cheers)<eos> Bode Miller, sensational training ride.<eos> So I think it's necessary that you win the race.<eos> It's actually not all that a problem as like with my back.<eos> During summer training on the Stelvio Pass, a stupid punch.<eos> All season I fight now with the pain in the back.<eos> (Quiet music)<eos> Actually, I have it, so far, to Kitzbühel pretty well had the touch.
Let us show you the inside.<eos> - It's all yours, Padre. - Yeah.<eos> Careful with the parking brake!<eos> Anyone heard from Mills and Brett?<eos> Nope.<eos> Hey.<eos> Does a fireman named Matt work here?<eos> Yeah, he does.<eos> He left his cell phone in my apartment.<eos> Can you give it to him for me?

Wait, wait.
Come on, Walden, put yourself in his shoes.<eos> He only spent half a day with us.<eos> He's gonna need more time to feel safe here.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You think he'll love me by tomorrow?<eos> Trust me, Walden, he'll warm up to you just like I did.<eos> Remember when you moved here?<eos> I wasn't sure I wanted you to stay.<eos> I bought the house.<eos> And I made it a home.
I guess two months is a long time.<eos> It felt like two years.<eos> There's so much I have to catch you up on.<eos> Finley, honey, give your sister a chance to breathe.<eos> [Chuckling] Come here, you.<eos> Hi, mom.<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> Look at your hair.<eos> It's gotten so long.<eos> Oh, yeah, I've, um, been growing it out.

- miles away by now.<eos> - It doesn't matter where they are,<eos> Mary, I will hunt them to the ends of the earth.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Morning Mass.<eos> - Come with me.<eos> - Greer, I go to services now, not Mass.<eos> - After all that's happened?<eos> - It was the act of a small group of violent radicals.<eos> You gave money and they used it to fund their crimes.
- Heart failure.<eos> Mr. Unal, we are going forward with the foreclosure.<eos> Please don't make this difficult.<eos> What's this all about?<eos> We haven't paid our taxes for a few months.<eos> Why not?<eos> We have a 100,000-dollar deficit, that's why.<eos> Why is there a deficit, Servet?<eos> Where is the money?<eos> - I spent it.

Not 3000, 5000-dollar shoes!<eos> That bitch Aynur will go green with envy!<eos> Servet!<eos> - Fatma.<eos> - Come here, my love.<eos> - Whoa!<eos> I'll show you real therapy!<eos> Why you...<eos> I said: "My lovely wife, we shouldn't spend this money."<eos> She said: "Let's spend it, what the hell."

Dear Lord!<eos> - We're doomed this time.<eos> - Stop, stop.<eos> Police! We're seizing your car!<eos> Our people will return it to you.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yes, officers from the department.<eos> Who are you messing with? Get out of my sight!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> - He didn't buy it!
All right.<eos> I'm headed to the ball pit.<eos> Same thing he said as he dove under the covers last night. Boing.<eos> Thanks for having us.<eos> I got to say, this is a great spot for a playdate.<eos> This view is amazing.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> You know, I used to walk by houses like this and think the people on the decks were just looking down their noses at everyone, feeling all superior.<eos> Now I know it's true.<eos> Roger sold our beach house 'cause he said we never used it.
I just threw up.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Oh... yep.<eos> He's got a fever.<eos> I'll bet it was that snot-nosed kid on the rock wall. Typhoid Tyler.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got this.<eos> I worked for Charlie for ten years.<eos> I know vomit.<eos> Cleaning it up and inducing it.
- Well, I wanted to make sure you look really cool on the back of that motorcycle.<eos> You didn't!<eos> You didn't!<eos> You didn't.<eos> Motorcycle crashes are one of the leading causes of brain injury.<eos> If Joey Saratoga doesn't care about this, then Joey Saratoga doesn't care about you.<eos> Wow, this present shows you really care, so in a way it's even cooler than a new leather jacket.<eos> Take it from me, being safe is totally radical.<eos> Is this my present?<eos> It's a Pretty Pony Princess play set, just like you asked for.
I'm making you partner.<eos> Well, I'm really glad to hear that, Mr. Liberatore.<eos> Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go spend Christmas with the people I love.<eos> Hi, I'm a Pretty Pony Princess.<eos> I'm a pencil.<eos> Well, I guess everything turned out okay.<eos> How'd you get her to come back down?<eos> Let's just say I made her an offer she couldn't refuse.<eos> Yowza-yowza-bo-bowza!<eos> Well, I gotta hand it to you, even though it didn't work, that letter you wrote was really something.
Uhh, What's this ...? "One day you should meet a boy who answers to the name of Jonas."<eos> "He should be the most powerful of all receivers".<eos> - Wait, that says ...?<eos> - Don't be gullible.<eos> "Plan for sameness."<eos> - Another trick?<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> It's some kind of ..<eos> The triangle of Rocks!<eos> Hey that's real, my friend Asher actually saw it!
Be curious.<eos> I got lost ... to good kind of lost!<eos> I saw sites and heard sounds, I had no words to describe.<eos> Faces with flesh of all different colours<eos> I felt so alive ...<eos> This is forbidden?<eos> I did not know what to think, what to believe.<eos> "Have faith", The Giver told me.<eos> He said: "Faith, that was seeing beyond."<eos> He compared it to the wind: something felt but not seen.
Thanks for my life, man.<eos> Sally blends into the sea of flesh that is Old Town.<eos> They all come back...<eos> The damn Old Town memories.<eos> Drunken mornings and sweaty sex and stupid, bloody brawls.<eos> And that thing I did.<eos> You can't just pick and choose.<eos> You can't take the good without the bad.<eos> Not once you let the monster out.<eos> I can't let it out.
Because I am pissed.<eos> Hey, Kyoko.<eos> Go-go.<eos> It's funny.<eos> You know. No matter how rich you get, shit goes wrong. You can't insulate yourself from it.<eos> I used to think it was death and taxes you couldn't avoid, but it's actually death and shit.<eos> It's like these power cuts.<eos> You would not believe how much I spent on the generator system, but I keep getting failures every day.<eos> Do you know why they happen? No.<eos> The system was supposed to be bulletproof, but obviously the guys that installed it fucked something up.
Why?<eos> Basically, I feel I'm screwing up my life.<eos> That's a good reason.<eos> Our meetings are the cause?<eos> Yes.<eos> I decided to see you to understand my health problems and now I also have behavioral problems.<eos> So, no.<eos> No.<eos> I rather stay sick than to sabotage my professional life.<eos> Are you sabotaging it?
Why is he talking like Madame Frou...<eos> My God!<eos> I regret so much.<eos> I'll take my white hat now.<eos> Run!<eos> The curfew's back on! It's back on!<eos> No more hiding, right?<eos> - Right!<eos> - Right?<eos> You built this thing, you can take it apart!
Something tripped my fly-by-wire.<eos> Exactly.<eos> But of all these anomalies, the most significant is this:<eos> Out near Saturn... a disturbance of space-time.<eos> - Is that a wormhole?<eos> - It appeared 48 years ago.<eos> And it leads where?<eos> Another galaxy.<eos> A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.<eos> Someone placed it there.
- It appeared 48 years ago.<eos> And it leads where?<eos> Another galaxy.<eos> A wormhole's not a naturally occurring phenomenon.<eos> Someone placed it there.<eos> - "They"?<eos> - Mm.<eos> And whoever they are, they appear to be looking out for us.<eos> That wormhole lets us travel to other stars.<eos> It came along right as we needed it.
Oh, yeah. Like swinging a periscope around.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So we got a pretty good idea what we're gonna find on the other side, huh?<eos> Navigationally.<eos> AMELIA:<eos> Guys? We'll be approaching the wormhole in about three hours.<eos> Hey, Coop?<eos> Can we stop the spinning?<eos> Why?<eos> Because we're close enough to see it now?
I'm afraid of time.<eos> MURPH:<eos> Time.<eos> You're afraid of time.<eos> We've been trying to solve the equation... without changing the underlying assumption about time.<eos> - And that means... each iteration is an attempt to prove its own proof.<eos> It's recursive.<eos> It's nonsensical.<eos> Are you calling my life's work... nonsense, Murph?<eos> No, I'm saying that you've been trying to... finish it with one arm... No, with both arms... tied behind your back.
More?<eos> More what?<eos> MANN:<eos> More data.<eos> You need to see into a black hole.<eos> The laws of nature prohibit a naked singularity.<eos> Romilly, is that true?<eos> If a black hole is an oyster, then the singularity's the pearl inside.<eos> The gravity's so strong, it's always hidden in darkness... behind the horizon.<eos> That's why we call it a black hole.
The truth is... I never really considered the possibility that my planet wasn't the one.<eos> Nothing worked out the way it was supposed to.<eos> COOPER:<eos> Let's go.<eos> [YELLS]<eos> All right, buddy, give me a big deep breath.<eos> What is this?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm sorry! I can't let you leave with that ship.<eos> We're gonna need it to complete the mission... once the others realize what this place isn't.
[PANTING]<eos> SANDRA:<eos> Come on let's go!<eos> [PANTING]<eos> Tell me this door's on manual.<eos> TAKASHI:<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we are starting to breach!<eos> I'm here.<eos> Soon as they're through, I'll seal it.
[ROARING]<eos> [G ROWLS]<eos> MAN:<eos> Let's move, let's move.<eos> On my six.<eos> [ALL YELLING]<eos> Sarge, get a look at this.<eos> We gotta get moving.<eos> You got a signal yet?<eos> I got it.
Menelaus, my man!<eos> My man.<eos> Are you ready to get on the field, Shermanus?<eos> Sure thing, Mr. Agamemnon.<eos> That's cute.<eos> Odysseus, what news do you bring?<eos> Someone left this for us.<eos> A present. Nice.<eos> It looks just like our horse.<eos> Should I bring it inside?
I think I might be losing it.<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> There's a lot to lose out there.<eos> It's a lot harder than I thought it would be.<eos> We just gotta stick together, brothers.<eos> We just gotta stick together. It'll all be okay.<eos> Where is everybody?<eos> Did you fire them, too?<eos> They're working on the new album.<eos> They think they can simplify what I was doing and release it. So, uh, to satisfy the record company.
Help me.<eos> Brian!<eos> Come in here! - I think she just smiled!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Come... come see.<eos> It's her first smile!<eos> She's got your smile.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Oh, yeah, this is it.<eos> They find it in the printer.
I freed his wretched head from his miserable shoulders.<eos> There was more the Orc could tell us.<eos> There was nothing more he could tell me.<eos> What did he mean by "the flames of war"?<eos> It means they intend to unleash a weapon so great it will destroy all before it.<eos> I want the watch doubled at our borders.<eos> All roads, all rivers.<eos> Nothing moves, but I hear of it.<eos> No one enters this kingdom.<eos> And no one leaves it.
- Yes.<eos> Like this, No problem with the pace It's ok.<eos> What was that noise?<eos> It's the rain, like?<eos> I do not like the rain.<eos> But the noise she makes, yes.<eos> And I've heard it before.<eos> - It 's my heart.<eos> - Your what?<eos> My heart. It was built On the day of my birth.
As a matter of fact, I shouldn't have had to lie about it in the first place.<eos> - You could've had another episode.<eos> - Let's call it what it is.<eos> It's a stroke, a mild stroke.<eos> And it won't recur as long as I take the damn pills.<eos> If it does, I'll just die, then, won't I?<eos> Until then, Ezra--<eos> Look at me when I'm talking to you.<eos> Until then, I am not a feeble old man.<eos> I've got a lot of life left in me, and I'm gonna live it doing the things that I like to do.
The aim?<eos> To conquer The Golden Mile.<eos> Twelve pubs along a legendary path of alcoholic indulgence.<eos> There was The First Post, The Old Familiar,<eos> The Famous Cock, The Cross Hands, The Good Companions,<eos> The Trusty Servant, The Two Headed Dog, The Mermaid, The Beehive,<eos> The King's Head, The Hole in the Wall...<eos> All before reaching our destiny, The World's End.<eos> We took my car into town.<eos> I called it The Beast because she was pretty hairy.
(MUMBLES MOCKINGLY)<eos> (ALL LAUGHING)<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> No problem.<eos> Well, you're making a face like you got a problem.<eos> Um, I'm sorry that I'm making that face.<eos> I don't mean to make a face that seems like I have a problem.<eos> I don't like that face!<eos> You need to change it, and change it quick.
Um, I'm sorry that I'm making that face.<eos> I don't mean to make a face that seems like I have a problem.<eos> I don't like that face!<eos> You need to change it, and change it quick.<eos> Stop making that face.<eos> Is this face better?<eos> JACK:<eos> Oh, I don't like...<eos> Oh, that new face is driving me crazy!<eos> Change it, now!
Oh.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Well, go ahead!<eos> Take a swing!<eos> Take your best shot!<eos> I have five brothers, and two of them are defensive backs in the NFL, so come on!<eos> - You want me to do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> This thing's not gonna feel good.<eos> Do it, Ron.

(DISCO MUSIC PLAYING)<eos> If you're like me, you need an underwear that fits your active lifestyle.<eos> ANNOUNCER: At finer specialty and department stores.<eos> I'm weatherman Brick Tamland, and I like butter.<eos> Butter is nutritious and it tastes great.<eos> (YELLING) Butter!<eos> There's something new on the New York social scene.<eos> It's fun, relatively benign and costs about as much as a soda pop at the local drugstore.<eos> Here's Brian Fantana on why everyone who is someone is lighting up to smoke crack.<eos> Now, Brian, I understand we have some crack and we're going to smoke it right here in the studio.
It was a really hard time and he made it better.<eos> Sure, that's because you like to accuse anyone who doesn't let the rich off, of engaging in class warfare when in reality, you know full well what real class warfare is.<eos> That's stealing homes of working people and handing them over at a cut rate to an investment bank. That, sir, is real class warfare.<eos> Maybe where you grew up in Connecticut, $3 billion is considered cut-rate. But here in New York City,<eos> $3 billion is a lot of money that can solve a lot of problems.<eos> You don't solve problems by bending over for billionaires.<eos> I may bend over for billionaires, but you come from a long line of them.<eos> How are the renovations coming on that $4 million townhouse in Brooklyn Heights?<eos> You want my house too?<eos> Take it. I'm upside-down on my mortgage like the rest of this city.
She kept calling me Jake Gyllenhaal.<eos> That's fucked up.<eos> Yeah, I said, "Call me the Prince of Persia."<eos> See, that's what I'm saying, man.<eos> We've all done bad shit, you know?<eos> We've done more bad shit than good in our lives, and it's time to pay the piper.<eos> Whoa, shit!<eos> Something's wrong.<eos> God did this.<eos> He gave us light, and then He took it away.
(BOTH CHUCKLING)<eos> Let's play some dominoes.<eos> Papi's ready.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Papi Greco!<eos> PAPI: "I-know-a-guy" Bobby.<eos> BOBBY:<eos> That's correct.<eos> PAPI: Quick, an ostrich, a tank of ether, a '63 Impala convertible.<eos> Make it a '64.
That's why I need you to let me rob Tres Cruces Savings and Loan.<eos> You want to rob a bank?<eos> No, Stig wants to rob the bank.<eos> It's his idea.<eos> So there's no entrapment.<eos> What I want is access to that money that Papi's got in the safe deposit box.<eos> You know no judge is gonna give you a blanket warrant for the boxes.<eos> We don't need a warrant.<eos> Not if the money's evidence in a crime.<eos> We just trace it back to ownership, we got Papi on tax evasion, possible RICO.
How we doin', boys?<eos> Any sign of Bobby Beans?<eos> Checked all the washes to the southeast.<eos> No sign of a body.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, Stig, you put us in quite a hole.<eos> I don't see it that way, sir, but you're the man with the oak leaves.<eos> All that pride I had in you.<eos> That loyalty?<eos> You just tossed it to the wind.
No?<eos> I'll shoot myself.<eos> STIGI Huh.<eos> Not bad.<eos> I'm glad you're impressed.<eos> STIG: Were you testing me to see if I would shoot first?<eos> Where's the money, Stig?<eos> If I thought you were clean, I might tell you, but I don't, so I can't.<eos> You're lying.<eos> You don't have it, do you?
Target's on the move!<eos> (GRUNTS)<eos> Sorry, Teemo.<eos> (ENGINE STARTS)<eos> (DOORBELL RINGS)<eos> Where's our money?<eos> I have no idea what you're talkin' about.<eos> You think DEA can just waltz into our bank, steal our money, and we're not gonna kick?<eos> Your man Bobby Trench stole 43 million of our dollars.<eos> We'd like it back.
(BELLOWING)<eos> STIGI Shit!<eos> $43 million!<eos> It's everything we stole from the CIA.<eos> You let us go, we'll bring it to you.<eos> (SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> BOBBY:<eos> I got the money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I got it.
STIGI Shit!<eos> $43 million!<eos> It's everything we stole from the CIA.<eos> You let us go, we'll bring it to you.<eos> (SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> BOBBY:<eos> I got the money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I got it.<eos> You don't have it!

(SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> BOBBY:<eos> I got the money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I got it.<eos> You don't have it!<eos> I know I don't have it.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> STIG: But you don't have the money.<eos> I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.
BOBBY:<eos> I got the money.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I got it.<eos> You don't have it!<eos> I know I don't have it.<eos> He doesn't know that.<eos> STIG: But you don't have the money.<eos> I know you don't have it, 'cause I have it.<eos> You have it?
(ENUNCIATING) Les MisÃ©rables!<eos> Oh, man, whatever the fuck, man.<eos> Don't remind me.<eos> Look, it's not my fault Quince took the money back to the base.<eos> I thought you said you took the money back to the base.<eos> No, I never said that.<eos> So the money could be anywhere.<eos> It could be in East Jabip, the Cayman Islands...<eos> No, the money is on the base, okay?<eos> Igaveit to Commander Quince at the Camino Real, and he told the guys to take it back to the base.
I don't know.<eos> All right, tell me what you do know.<eos> Well, your girl found out where the CIA was stashing the money right about when I did.<eos> And when I told her that she and I could get away with the money by setting you and Stigman up, she didn't even blink.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Was she that unhappy,Bobby?<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> Where is the money?<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> You think I'd keep it here with you and Stigman still alive?

Exactly where I deserve to be.<eos> (DIALING)<eos> (CELL PHONE BUZZING)<eos> (BEEP S)<eos> Yeah.<eos> PAPY. Bobby.<eos> You're late.<eos> I got the money.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> No, I got it.
(DIALING)<eos> (CELL PHONE BUZZING)<eos> (BEEP S)<eos> Yeah.<eos> PAPY. Bobby.<eos> You're late.<eos> I got the money.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> Believe me, I got it.
(CELL PHONE BUZZING)<eos> (BEEP S)<eos> Yeah.<eos> PAPY. Bobby.<eos> You're late.<eos> I got the money.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> No, I got it.<eos> Believe me, I got it.<eos> I'll bring it to you.
Okay, listen to me.<eos> Tell him I got the money.<eos> Hang up the phone.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> Justâ€œ<eos> Debbie.<eos> Tell him I have the money.<eos> Okay?<eos> And I know you know where the money is.<eos> Just tell him I have it.
Yeah...<eos> Mr.--<eos> No, no.<eos> Please, just call me Lee.<eos> Lee.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have the medicine for your poodle.<eos> For his eyes?<eos> Oh, my savior!<eos> I was going to just tuck it in the mail tomorrow morning... and it should be there, you know, in a few days.
- Yeah? - I'll ditch these clowns.<eos> I'll see you up on the roof in five minutes.<eos> Just gonna try and get my beak wet real quick.<eos> You know what I'm talking about?<eos> I'll see you up there.<eos> Damn betcha.<eos> Come on!<eos> I thought that was just a theory.<eos> Well, it was.<eos> If I'm right, we can access the area of the brain that governs repair... and chemically recode it.
Maybe he needed some time away from you.<eos> Oh, that's nice of you to say.<eos> Hey, it's no crime.<eos> Marriage is hard.<eos> Under the best of circumstances.<eos> So, nothing? No, "see you later, I'm taking a walk"?<eos> Good old unfathomable Dad.<eos> Oh, that man.<eos> What I first fell in love with was his mystery.<eos> I thought it was sexy as hell.
And it burns like a like a bullshit.<eos> And now Beverly's disappeared, and you're yelling at me.<eos> I'm not yelling.<eos> You know, you couldn't come home when I got cancer.<eos> But Beverly disappeared and you rushed right back.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Do you know where I think he is?<eos> I think he...<eos> I think he got some whiskey and a carton of cigarettes, and a couple of spy novels, and I think he got out on the boat and steered it to a nice spot close to shore like he likes and...
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, son.<eos> Don't worry, Dad, we'll be out of here in a few hours.<eos> Who said I was worried?<eos> After going to jail, I thought I'd seen it all.<eos> But I never imagined I'd see... a black man... be a real contender for the President of the United States.<eos> Here we go.<eos> It's that sweet corn.<eos> Gloria and I would walk to our polling place... every night to see where we'd be voting for Barack Obama.<eos> We'd just... stare at it, smile.
But he's probably got one of those awkward character faces... that sort of really has to grow on you, right?<eos> Mr. "Character Face" is on the cover of Gotham Magazine.<eos> - That's him? - That's him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And he's here.<eos> Go. - Do I look okay? - Gorgeous.<eos> - You sure?<eos> - Have fun!<eos> - I mean, you gotta be kidding. - Several of them.<eos> I'm telling you, don't knock shopping on TV until you've tried it.
Come here and kiss me, and then you can give me your special present.<eos> - Tell me how much you love me.<eos> - Oh, I love you so much.<eos> - How much?<eos> - I love you so much I'd kill a man.<eos> Can we do this, please?<eos> - I bought this special lavender lotion.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Why don't you get my neck ready.<eos> - You want it on your neck? Why? Does that not work for you?
Absolutely.<eos> Ladner, open the gates.<eos> LADNER:<eos> Open the gates!<eos> I had the gates brought in from a castle in Normandy.<eos> Oh, Jay.<eos> -It's so grand.<eos> GATSBY:<eos> You like it?<eos> I love it.
Get out of here!<eos> Go on!<eos> Get the hell out of here!<eos> NICK: I rang I wrote I implored.<eos> But not a single one of the sparkling hundreds that enjoyed his hospitality attended the funeral.<eos> And from Daisy not even a flower.<eos> I was all he had.<eos> The only one who cared.<eos> On my last night in New York I returned to that huge incoherent house once more.<eos> Wolfshiem's associates had cleaned it out.
CRAWE:<eos> You want to know a little trick?<eos> - No.<eos> - When I'm afraid I imagine a big piece of cake floating right in front of me.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Like a reward waiting for you, just within arm's reach.<eos> JACK:<eos> Right.<eos> Can you see it?

It's a hell of a view, my old friend.<eos> JACK:<eos> That should stop...<eos> - ...the bleeding.<eos> - What is it?<eos> Yarrow.<eos> It's just a weed that grows everywhere, but it can be useful.<eos> You know a lot about the land.<eos> Ought to.<eos> Been working it all my life.

I loved Divi, and most people did.<eos> I never dreamed in my lifetime that here I am, a mother of a person that was known all over the world, and loved by everybody.<eos> And when I get letters from young people, it makes me feel good to know that people cared about him.<eos> There's a whole lot of things that he stood for that he didn't mean to.<eos> He wasn't out there being any kind of politico.<eos> Divine stood for all outsiders.<eos> He stood for anybody that didn't fit in, that exaggerated what everybody hated, turned it into a style, and won.<eos> No one else can ever call themselves Divine.<eos> That's her legacy. She earned it, she worked for it,<eos> She earned it, she worked for it, and God damn it, it's hers.
THE KING DID THIS TO SHOW HIS PEOPLE THAT EVERYBODY WAS IMPORTANT,<eos> AND THAT NO ONE PERSON WAS BORN GREATER THAN ANOTHER.<eos> BECAUSE OF THIS HUMBLE ACT, THE MEDALLION TOOK ON SPECIAL POWERS,<eos> GRANTING WISHES TO THE PURE IN HEART.<eos> WITH THIS POWERFUL MEDALLION, THE KING USED IT TO GROW CROPS FROM BARREN SOIL.<eos> HE SAVED HIS PEOPLE FROM DEADLY STORMS.<eos> THE KING EVEN PROTECTED HIS VILLAGE FROM AN EVIL WARLORD'S INVADING ARMIES.<eos> BUT ONE DAY, THE KING'S PRIDEFUL SON, HUKO, TOOK THE MEDALLION AND LOST THE STONE, CAUSING IT TO LOSE ITS POWER.<eos> WITHOUT THE POWER OF THE STONE TO PROTECT THE ISLAND, THE EVIL WARLORD COBRA, CONQUERED THE PEACEFUL PEOPLE.<eos> BUT JUST BEFORE HE SEIZED THE MEDALLION, THE GOOD KING RESCUED IT, AND ESCAPED.

WELL, THE MEDALLION STAYED HIDDEN FOR A LONG TIME.<eos> NO ONE FOUND IT, EVEN THOUGH MANY PEOPLE LOOKED FOR IT.
GAVE US A GOOD CHASE.<eos> JUST GIVE ME THE MEDALLION.<eos> NO!<eos> HE DOESN'T HAVE THE MEDALLION-<eos> DAD -<eos> HE'S JUST A KID.<eos> I'M THE ARCHEOLOGIST HERE.<eos> DID THE BAD GUYS TAKE THE MEDALLION FROM BILLY?<eos> WELL, I'M ABOUT TO TELL YOU.<eos> I WOULDN'T HAVE SHOWN IT TO THEM.

WERE THEY CAPTURED?<eos> WHO GOT THE MEDALLION?<eos> WELL, THINGS DIDN'T LOOK GOOD FOR BILLY AND ALLIE.<eos> EVERYONE SAW THE MEDALLION, AND THE BAD GUYS WANTED IT.
BUT IF THE BAD GUYS TAKE IT FROM HIM, IT DOESN'T MATTER.<eos> I WOULD HAVE KEPT IT FOR MYSELF.<eos> WHAT HAPPENED?

"COME ON KID, GIVE IT HERE."<eos> NO!<eos> YOU'RE GOING TO WISH YOU'D GIVEN IT TO US.
MOHEA, YOU MUST NOT SPEAK DIRECTLY TO OUR GUEST.<eos> SOME OF US NEVER LEARNED THE TRUE MEANING OF THE ROYAL MEDALLION.<eos> UH, WAIT.<eos> YOU' RE MOHEA?<eos> I LOVE YOUR WRITINGS.<eos> I DON'T WRITE.<eos> TRUST ME, YOU WILL.<eos> THE MEDALLION HAS BEEN FOUND MY LORD.<eos> WHERE?<eos> A STRANGER BROUGHT IT TO THEM, AND NOW HE'S THE KING.
TRUST ME, YOU WILL.<eos> THE MEDALLION HAS BEEN FOUND MY LORD.<eos> WHERE?<eos> A STRANGER BROUGHT IT TO THEM, AND NOW HE'S THE KING.<eos> I AM THEIR KING.<eos> PREPARE MY OUTRIGGERS.<eos> YES, MY LORD.<eos> YOU ARE VERY KIND.<eos> AND YOU ARE VERY BEAUTIFUL.<eos> I KNOW THE MEDALLION BROUGHT YOU HERE, GIVE IT TO ME.
NO!<eos> GO, GO, GO, GO, GO!<eos> STOP!<eos> GET HIM!<eos> SOMEBODY HELP!<eos> GET OUT OF MY WAY.<eos> COME WITH ME!<eos> DO YOU THINK YOU CAN TAKE THE MEDALLION FROM ME?<eos> I DON'T NEED THE MEDALLION.<eos> WELL, IF YOU DON'T NEED IT, I'LL TAKE THAT STONE OFF YOUR HANDS IN EXCHANGE FOR THE GIRL.
BILLY'S DAD WAS GRATEFUL TO HAVE FOUND THE MEDALLION,<eos> BUT REALIZED THAT THE GREATER TREASURE WAS HAVING BILLY AS A SON.<eos> AS FOR THE KIDS; PRINCE HUKO DISCOVERED THAT GREATNESS COMES WHEN YOU LOVE AND SERVE OTHERS.<eos> AND HE HELPED HIS PEOPLE BY PUTTING THEM ABOVE HIMSELF.<eos> AND ALLIE, SHE LEARNED THAT NO ONE IS AN ACCIDENT TO GOD,<eos> AND THAT HE HAS AN INCREDIBLE PURPOSE FOR EVERYONE,<eos> EVEN BRAVE LITTLE GIRLS.<eos> AND BILLY.<eos> BILLY LEARNED THAT HIS GREATEST VALUE CAME FROM GOD.<eos> AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING HE COULD EVER DO, WAS TO TRUST HIS HEART TO THE ONE WHO CREATED IT.
We're going up the street, you dope.<eos> Hey, wait for your mother, please.<eos> Give me a ride.<eos> Oh, you're getting heavy.<eos> Danny's dad said he'd sell me their old car.<eos> I got half of what I need saved from the summer. - I thought maybe...<eos> - Forget it.<eos> I can barely get enough carpentry work to keep up with the mortgage.<eos> Why don't you rent out Grandpa's old apartment house?<eos> Like I keep telling your mother, it's an old building. It'll cost a fortune to fix it up.
- Anna, come here.<eos> We wait until we're invited, you understand?<eos> You're in charge of this.<eos> Us veterinarians make lousy butchers.<eos> No problem.<eos> Can I go outside with Joy?<eos> Uh, convince your brother to go with you and you can.<eos> And wear a hat, please. You're just getting over a cold.<eos> Joy, you wear a hat too.<eos> Did you feel bad for that deer when you shot it?
And what's completely fucked up about all this is I know you know where they are.<eos> I think we're done.<eos> They're in the maze.<eos> - That's where you'll find them.<eos> What did you say?<eos> In the maze.<eos> What...? What maze?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Where is the maze?<eos> Where do I find it?
We cannot fire and we cannot flee.<eos> There is one option.<eos> Uhura, when you get Scotty back,<eos> -patch him through.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> Mr. Spock, you have the conn.<eos> Captain, I strongly object.<eos> To what?<eos> I haven't said anything yet.<eos> Since we cannot take the ship from the outside, the only way we can take it is from within.
Dahl, keep an eye on things here.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Stay low.<eos> Come on.<eos> Both of you drop.<eos> So what's the bounty at?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't care.<eos> It's not why I'm here. I bet the big jamoke knows.<eos> Yeah. I know exactly what it is.
I don't fuckin' buy it!<eos> I just can't believe that my son's the bad guy in this fuckin' demented fairy tale of yours.<eos> No reason to lie now.<eos> Johns.<eos> Either one of us.<eos> Thanks for startin' the killing spree for me, Riddick.<eos> But I'll take it from here.<eos> Jamoke.<eos> So that blade you buried was meant for me?<eos> Anyone who deserved it, really.
The man who claims he knows my business better than I do.<eos> Here, take a seat.<eos> - Drop of vino?<eos> - Uh...<eos> No.<eos> It seems you were the beneficiary of an accounting error we made.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> The Ethion discretionary fund.<eos> Where's my money?<eos> We used it on market research.
- Yeah, absolutely.<eos> MAN: A glass of wine, sir?<eos> - White wine.<eos> JOCK:<eos> - Mineral water, cold.<eos> See you later.<eos> (PHONE CHIMES)<eos> Kind of like a Bordeaux, more dry.<eos> (CHIMING CONTINUES)<eos> If you're looking for the bathroom, you missed it.
You know, the suit's not all that bad.<eos> You don't have to hide way out here.<eos> I was, uh, playing hard to get.<eos> But you're already gotten.<eos> So tell me, how is it that you know so much about me and I know nothing about you?<eos> It's this, uh, little row home my grandmother owned.<eos> Five of us sharing one bathroom.<eos> My dad was a security guard.<eos> Now he has emphysema, but still smokes.<eos> And I'm pretty sure he's putting it to the nurse I'm paying for.
We've got somebody at the vault.<eos> (ALARM BLARING)<eos> What the hell?<eos> Jock.<eos> Mr. Cassidy.<eos> Got caught with your hand in the cookie jar, didn't you?<eos> I... Jock, I can explain this.<eos> Where you gonna start?<eos> I was beginning to think it would never happen.<eos> Wyatt would rather watch his company crumble than sell it to me.
And now I'm standing on your neck!<eos> I'm 15 moves ahead of you, Nick.<eos> The Dutch offer, me!<eos> I strung you along until the only hope was...<eos> Adam.<eos> (STAMMERS) That's impossible.<eos> Impossible?<eos> I built Wyatt Corp.<eos> Sell or not, your company is finished.<eos> You've got nothing in the pipe, and even if you did, you've got no money to market it with.
I'm sure your sheriff was only trying to protect you good people.<eos> But your mayor has done a very smart thing.<eos> He hired us.<eos> My name is Gretel, and this is my brother, Hansel.<eos> We know that many of your children have gone missing.<eos> But killing an innocent woman will not bring them back.<eos> Go home!<eos> We don't want you here!<eos> We don't want more evil in Augsburg!<eos> Well, evil is upon you, whether you like it or not.
Enough with this.<eos> - Take his fucking head off.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Please work.<eos> We have to hurry.<eos> You get the children.<eos> I'll get her heart!<eos> Now, move!<eos> Fucking...<eos> Eat it!
I'd like to buy this man a drink.<eos> What's your name, mister?<eos> It's Logan.<eos> And that's a poison broadhead, which, last I heard, was illegal.<eos> Go ahead, ask me where I found it.<eos> Ask me.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> Well, funny you should ask.<eos> I pulled it out of the back of a grizzly.<eos> Whoever shot it, didn't have the wind or the balls to track the animal properly... And put it out of its misery.
Because I don't dip my arrows in anything.<eos> In that case, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> Damn.<eos> That hurt.<eos> Sorry, Jean.<eos> I wouldn't bother with them.<eos> Most of them will die soon anyway, without your help.<eos> Three of them, a week from now in the same truck.<eos> This sword is hundreds of years old...<eos> And was named Danzan by the first samurai who used it.
The house... wonderful memories and a great life... that... that we all had there at some point, and... [gulping]<eos> You have to sell in order to stay here.<eos> [Max] It's not your house... to sell!<eos> You put my name on the deed.<eos> That was a convenience.<eos> I did what had to be done.<eos> [Max] You selfish little putz!<eos> [Chris] Okay...<eos> Great to see you, as always.<eos> [Max] Who'd you sell it to?
And finally, Oozma Kappa.<eos> Hi, Mom!<eos> Smile!<eos> Let's begin the first competition, the Toxicity Challenge!<eos> Human children are toxic!<eos> And anything they touch is toxic.<eos> We don't have any human toys, but thanks to MU's biology department, we found a close second,<eos> the stinging glow urchin!<eos> Trust me when I say, you are not gonna want to touch this bad boy!<eos> I want to touch it.
Debris from the missile strike has caused a chain reaction hitting other satellites and creating new debris.<eos> Traveling faster than a high-speed bullet up towards your altitude.<eos> Copy all.<eos> Put a bow on it, Dr. Stone.<eos> I can't.<eos> The board is still initializing.<eos> - I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> - One second.<eos> Not one second. Now.<eos> Shut it down.
What, exorcism?<eos> I thought that was something that you do to people.<eos> LORRAINE:<eos> No, not necessarily, no.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> I'm afraid that's not gonna help.<eos> Lorraine saw something, which--<eos> Go ahead, hon.<eos> I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house and your land.<eos> I saw it first when I came through your door.
LORRAINE:<eos> No, not necessarily, no.<eos> We have to get out of here.<eos> I'm afraid that's not gonna help.<eos> Lorraine saw something, which--<eos> Go ahead, hon.<eos> I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house and your land.<eos> I saw it first when I came through your door.<eos> It was latched to your back.<eos> And then I saw it again with the girls when we walked into the living room.
I'm gonna miss this place.<eos> It would have been great.<eos> It would have been great.<eos> Vika?<eos> Vika, did you get that?<eos> Jack, where have you been?<eos> An object came down in 17.<eos> That's the beacon coordinates.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I saw it.
The Tet.<eos> What a brilliant machine.<eos> Feeding off one planet after another for energy.<eos> Phase Two was drones.<eos> Repairmen.<eos> 50 years of watching those hydro rigs suck our planet dry.<eos> Then one day, I saw you set down.<eos> Another drone to fix.<eos> But in the rubble that day was a book.<eos> You picked it up.

- I can, but-- That's the sound of me unzipping my very, very fancy dress<eos> - Well, that's good news.<eos> - that I happen to be wearing really cute panties under.<eos> - And also, like, a bra that totally, totally matches.<eos> - Chantry... - Can you picture me in them?<eos> Hey, can you picture me out of them?<eos> L- - I-<eos> - I definitely can. The thing is, I'm just in the middle of the Brazilian presentation now. That's not to say I don't fully support the concept.<eos> It sounds very interesting.<eos> And I would love to continue discussing it at a later time.
So he didn't say anything about me completely humiliating myself in front of him?<eos> No.<eos> He's a big, stupid, ugly jerk, and you shouldn't be friends with him anymore.<eos> 0K8)'-<eos> Look how pregnant I can make myself look.<eos> You want to feel my baby?<eos> It's so hard.<eos> - Oh, my God, it kicked.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> I'm gonna make you raise it.
How do I know I can trust you?<eos> I'm giving you exactly what you wanted.<eos> Taking you to my family could get them killed.<eos> We head east.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't leave tracks.<eos> Walk on the rocks.<eos> Did you really think you could beat me?<eos> Save the water.<eos> We're gonna need it.

Give him the fucking cherry.<eos> So, you like that new girl in church?<eos> I don't know her yet.<eos> I like her too.<eos> She's not like all the other girls around here.<eos> I mean, she's not like Glenna.<eos> She gives handjobs to your brother and Eric... because she thinks that's the only way guys will like her.<eos> But they just think she's trash.<eos> Maybe I should give her the cross.<eos> I mean, I am the one who fixed it.
Just walking through the woods one day.<eos> Come on.<eos> This is where I come when I want to be alone.<eos> So now I know where to find you.<eos> We've got a great hiding spot where you can hide food... blankets, anything else you want to hide.<eos> So you're a Bowie fan too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I didn't tell you the truth.<eos> Lee's the one who fixed your cross.<eos> He wanted to give it back to you, but...

I don't think he ever would have done anything to her but he can't remember anything from the...<eos> Why is he confessing this to you all of a sudden?<eos> Because of the horns, Lee! Oh, my god, Ig.<eos> I can't talk to you when you're like this.<eos> There's no horns.<eos> You're going crazy.<eos> Go home.<eos> Why are you wearing Merrin's cross? It's not Merrin's.<eos> It's mine.<eos> I've had it forever.

Of course, thank you.<eos> Halo.<eos> Madame delacourt.<eos> Hi, it's been great, yes.<eos> Hello.<eos> What's up?<eos> Kids go?<eos> Yes, they were together Dominica.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> Take it with your mother.
They're at a quarter mile now.<eos> - Starboard, 5 degrees.<eos> - Starboard, 5 degrees.<eos> Hurry, hurry!<eos> Go!<eos> We're pushing this engine too hard!<eos> Faster, faster!<eos> Come on, let's go!<eos> This thing is busted.<eos> - Then fix it!
Listen, I know I've always been the one who needed you more than you needed me.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> - Yes, it is, but I never cared.<eos> I've only ever had my mom, Luke and you.<eos> Don't ever imagine that you weren't important to me.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What did that piano ever do to you?<eos> You play it like you've lost your only love.
Goddamn straight.<eos> Assholes on the outside got no fucking idea.<eos> It's when you get on the outside, you realise you spend your time with thieves and murderers, and fucking liars.<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> It's like we're all in one of them big clubs you get in a college.<eos> What do you call that?<eos> Fraternities, you moron.<eos> Yeah, that's what it is.<eos> Hen, where's the fucking money at?<eos> Listen, man, this fucking woodchuck that lives up by the quarry, he's got it...

It's cool.

She's scared, John.<eos> She said she tried to understand you, but she couldn't make any sense of what you were saying about this money or where you got it, that you were acting as if it just fell out of the sky into your lap.<eos> She doesn't know what terrible things you've done or what repercussions it might have on you, or her, or especially Nolan.<eos> You threatening me?<eos> Don't play games with me.<eos> I already know you're working for 'em.<eos> - John, I don't know...<eos> - Cut the shit!<eos> How'd they come by this money?<eos> How'd they come by it?

A woman who was staying in the room two down from the dead guy, and a man the maid saw with her not long before the body was discovered.<eos> What is troubling you, Diablo?<eos> Jealous, must be.<eos> I sure hope you used protection with whoever she was kept you out so late.<eos> Weren't nobody but me kept me out.<eos> Handsome, gentle, but strong, with a good sense of humour?<eos> All you need to be a woman's perfect catch, John Moon, is a secure job.<eos> You leave a radio on inside?<eos> Yeah, I guess I must've.<eos> I'll go turn it off.
It's gonna be all right.<eos> You're a pretty little thing.<eos> You might wanna hurry on back and get yourself a piece.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Give me a holler, John!<eos> Where you at?<eos> Check in with me!<eos> I'm at the truck!<eos> You got the money?<eos> I gotta dig it out first!
Enough with that shit, please.<eos> Easy, my liege.<eos> I told these guys that thou were cool.<eos> Ah, at last.<eos> The simpletons and heretics have left our brotherhood.<eos> However, it occureth to me that mine apprentice has forgotten something.<eos> Yo? Thou must return to the kingdom of Eliphaz.<eos> - Parking lot.<eos> Parking lot.<eos> And fetch the amulet of Kokun from our transport, for it shall be needed at the battle of Evermore.
Enochian, what?<eos> You made that up.<eos> This is the "Sigillum Aemeth." It is the only one of its kind.<eos> It was handwritten in the 16th Century by the mystic John Dee and it has been lost for generations.<eos> Uh, bullshit. It came from the internets, not the 16th Century.<eos> If you're tying to get out of admitting how awesome I am...<eos> John Dee was tying to summon angels, but evil travels under its own power and he actually summoned demons and the demons forged this book.<eos> What are you saying, Kwok?<eos> Dee tried to destroy, but he couldn't.<eos> So he sealed it and he hid it deep underneath his manor estate and it has been lost for generations.
Macon comes here every day and reads every book he can for the forbidden spell.<eos> He found nothing?<eos> But you can do it.<eos> God gives us what we can handle, even if we don't believe it ourselves.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> See with your mind what you're looking for as if you've already found it.<eos> I knew it.<eos> "Book of moons." It's the most powerful book of the otherworld.<eos> It's as alive as you or me. Strongest of every spells, good and bad.<eos> Did macon look through it?

You have no idea how much i just love you to death right now.<eos> Ready? Fire!<eos> Fire!<eos> Awesome.<eos> Come in.<eos> Are you ready to get dressed?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You've done the right thing.<eos> How will i know if it worked?<eos> When the curse has been paid, you'll feel it.
She was still alive after the crash.<eos> Yeah, we're on it, but there was no one at the site.<eos> No, she was there.<eos> I left her there.<eos> He must have moved them.<eos> Do you know who he is? No.<eos> He was in the house, he was...<eos> - What house?<eos> - The Carson Estate.<eos> My grandmother left it to me. Verna Carson.
How can you compete with that?<eos> Billy was everything Julian wanted to be.<eos> Is that not true?<eos> 'Cause let me tell you, if the tables were turned, your brother would have found your killer and brought me his head on a fucking platter!<eos> And you just sit there thinking he got what he deserved!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Do you mind if I smoke?<eos> [Julian] You can keep that dress if you want to.<eos> [Mai] I don't want it.
And you just sit there thinking he got what he deserved!<eos> Fuck you.<eos> I don't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Do you mind if I smoke?<eos> [Julian] You can keep that dress if you want to.<eos> [Mai] I don't want it.<eos> Why do you let her treat you like that?<eos> [gasps]<eos> 'Cause she's my mother.<eos> Now if you don't want that dress, take it off.

"Dad, when I grow up I am going to be one of those men, "who makes laws.<eos> Because the world is too complicated without laws."<eos> And your grandad said: "Then son, you will be whatever you want to be."<eos> And he hugged him.<eos> I remember the king's words the day your grandad was knighted:<eos> "Carry this sword with strength, "and prepare your heart for goodness.<eos> "Never use it to do harm in anger. "but always to defend the good and the just."<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, if you want to be a knight, you will need a quest.<eos> Find grandfather's sword and bring it home. Well done!
Those girls, they're...<eos> They're evil.<eos> It's just high school.<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> You should be out there in the real world making it a better place.<eos> Dave, I can't.<eos> I know, you promised your dad.<eos> But he's not here anymore.<eos> This is your life.<eos> You've gotta live it.
Pizza, can we get pizza?<eos> We're getting pizza.<eos> Don't worry, I kill you first.<eos> Justice For ever.<eos> A Brooklyn resident was found decapitated last night.<eos> According to Twitter, a man claiming to be the world's first supervillain...<eos> I told you, no TV.<eos> You're grounded, remember?<eos> Marcus, I know I made you a promise, but I can't keep being someone I'm not.<eos> When I see evil, I have to stop it.
I think we were in chapter 12, page 42<eos> Er... Natalie, perhaps you begin?<eos> 'How can it be that the gods... overlooked this along at some amongst men and those very good men, ... who have had the most... intercourse with the divine.'<eos> please, keep on going.<eos> 'If it is so that we only live a small part of the life that is within us, What happens to the rest? '<eos> Hello, Dr. Gregorious.<eos> I'm afraid, your book on Persian grammar book hasn't yet arrived.<eos> No, that's not why I came...<eos> Do you know that book?<eos> Indeed, I sold it to someone yesterday.

To remind me of Amadeu.<eos> Mr. da Silva, can I have my bill, please?<eos> Are you going back to Switzerland?<eos> Yes, via Spain.<eos> They say right now in Switzerland is terrible, with rain, snow, wind...<eos> I have to go; could I have my bill?<eos> Excuse me...<eos> I want to thank you for what happened on the bridge.<eos> I've been reading your book...<eos> I don't want it.
That dumbbell saves me from poverty and insignificance.<eos> If I don't lift it, I'm nothing.<eos> Don't try to be like me.<eos> Aim higher.<eos> Lift it, you lazy bugger.<eos> Yes.<eos> Up to your shoulder!<eos> The hard bit's done.<eos> Push it up!<eos> I can't do it!
This is the first person to be bitten?<eos> So I'm told. Then someone must have taken it out.<eos> Taken what?<eos> The queen egg. The queen is always implanted in the first host.<eos> These are male eggs.<eos> The queen will be a different shape and color.<eos> Pfft. Brown, maybe.<eos> This is jenkins. Yeah, I need all the paperwork with the body. That we just picked up from the morgue.<eos> You tell me as soon as you've got it. Twenty years, two marriages I've served this project,<eos> Just to watch it crumble when the wall came down.
And then it falls from the sky right into my lap.<eos> And you lose it. If we had the queen egg,<eos> None of this would be necessary. We wouldn't have to work here in these tunnels,<eos> In less than ideal conditions. What's wrong with the male eggs?<eos> Why do we need the queen egg?<eos> The queen is the only one. That can produce the quality of webbing.<eos> Can you believe these creatures?<eos> These are newborns, but already they work together. They have established their territory. And now they build a nest for the queen.<eos> But if we don't get the egg into their nest in twelve hours,<eos> She will die. So you and your people must find it,
A height joke.<eos> That was good. That's original.<eos> Height ain't nothing but a number.<eos> See, in Thailand, I'm in the 95th percentile.<eos> I'm okay over there.<eos> So, what you say can't hurt my feelings.<eos> Let's talk turkey.<eos> The guys that made this game saw your HBO special.<eos> They loved it.<eos> I loved it.
Besides, he's useless.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Why is that?<eos> Because he believes their magic was real.<eos> Oh, he believes the magic was real?<eos> You're right, he probably is useless.<eos> Is it okay with Interpol if we talk to him, too?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I have never stolen a thing in my life, okay?<eos> I tried to give the money back, but they won't take it.
My guess is that they targeted a shipment of freshly minted money headed to the Frenchman's bank on-board an armored truck.<eos> Which, of course, is just as hard to break into.<eos> Unless you're already inside.<eos> And despite what the banks would have you believe, the men who drive these trucks are not exactly mental giants.<eos> For our Horsemen, it was almost too easy.<eos> Hey, boys.<eos> So, how did they make the fake money disappear from the vault?<eos> What is that?<eos> Flash paper.<eos> Magicians use it all the time.
Stop.<eos> Zoom in tighter.<eos> Tighter.<eos> There.<eos> That's where he took my phone.<eos> Is that thing transmitting?<eos> Only when you're making a call or sending a text.<eos> Plus I removed the bug.<eos> All right.<eos> Put it back in and turn on the phone.
Oh, thank you, dear.<eos> But an old woman needs time on her own to recover.<eos> Good night, sweet child.<eos> Call me.<eos> Are there any other hotels in town besides the Biltmore?<eos> Even family ties have no meaning when food is scarce.<eos> This one knows there is no room for his brother in the hunt.<eos> While this sibling rivalry may seem cruel, in the end, it is for the best.<eos> I was wondering if anyone had turned in a cell phone.<eos> I think I may have dropped it when I was checking in.
It's almost Friday.<eos> So, how's today's batch, Dr. Nefario?<eos> I developed a new formula which allowed me to get every known kind of Berry into one flavor of jelly.<eos> That tastes good!<eos> I love the flavor of that!<eos> It's horrible, isn't it? No, no!<eos> Oh, we're making great progress!<eos> Here, try some of this.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Okay, just because everybody hates it, doesn't mean it's not good!
No, not yet.<eos> But, hey, maybe you can find something with these X-Ray goggles.<eos> How are they working?<eos> Tell me! Tell me!<eos> Oof! What's wrong?<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> That's an image I'll never get out of my brain. Blech!<eos> I knew it!<eos> The serum is in here!<eos> Ooh, then let's get it.
Never heard of him.<eos> I guess we'll meet him soon enough.<eos> You work on him, I'll leave you alone.<eos> I made you some tea and Papa said you could eat some cookies.<eos> Was this the knife that hurt you?<eos> - No, this is a tattoo.<eos> - This hurt you, right?<eos> - You like this book?<eos> - Yes, it's beautiful.<eos> - Do you want it?
And those tires are worth at least 20 a piece.<eos> Here is a whole case of vodka!<eos> Here are more!<eos> The liquor store must have flooded!<eos> Hey Vitalic, your mother, can she sell these?<eos> Vitalic!<eos> Look what I found!<eos> What the fuck would we do with the piano?<eos> Shit, it's a good thousand!<eos> Come on! We got to get it out before the current grabs it.
This is Roger, we're usually around here.<eos> Hi.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Is that it?<eos> That's it.<eos> OK, great, bye.<eos> When did we start selling paint?<eos> Today.<eos> The drawing looks good.<eos> Thank you. Would you like it?
The show goes on.<eos> We've been running the fireworks show here for as long as we can remember.<eos> Biggest extravaganza on the Eastern Seaboard. - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That's a slight exaggeration.<eos> - Oh, I don't think so. Maybe the lower third of North Carolina. - Oh, bullshit.<eos> - God.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Who does it better than we do? Come on.<eos> - That's the answer. Thank you. - Nobody does it better than we do, officer.
That's definitely not what it looks like.<eos> Those cavities in the rock... those could be microbial borings.<eos> PAH's can be formed non-organically.<eos> - Sample still under the scope?<eos> - I'll check.<eos> All right, anyone want to tell me what's going on?<eos> Nothing's going on.<eos> He found a piece of abiotic mineral.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> Got it.
C'mon!<eos> I was better than him on my worst day!<eos> Yeah, but gifts like yours need to be used.<eos> You've been out of the game for months.<eos> And Lundgrens' success nowadays is close to 100 percent.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> To be honest, I'm running out of money.<eos> You still have the beach house?<eos> Go ahead. Sell it.<eos> I'm not ready to sell it yet.
Megan transferred in during the second semester and left right after I got expelled.<eos> You know, who the hell do you think I am?<eos> Please tell me, John!<eos> What... what, you think I'm some psychopath? What?<eos> This is the second day in a row you've called me a liar!<eos> I want to know why you're suddenly turning on me!<eos> Here!<eos> My yearbook!<eos> You won't mind if I hang on to this for a couple of days?<eos> Sleep with it under your pillow, for all I care. We don't have much time.
Yeah.<eos> He did?<eos> Yes.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> And I can't fight this feelin' anymore<eos> Forgotten what I started fightin' for<eos> It's time to bring the ship into the shore<eos> And throw away...<eos> Not doing it.<eos> You put it on.
Why don't you pimp her? Huh?<eos> You out of practice?<eos> Oh, she too good for that, right?<eos> Me, am I too good for that?<eos> You shut your fuckin' mouth!<eos> You wanna know something?<eos> Your new one, she'll be hooking soon...<eos> See?<eos> - I know you real well. - Yeah, I know you too.<eos> You just want that money to sniff it up your fuckin' nose!
You should go to Ronnie Scott's.<eos> I can't just go to places, you know.<eos> It's not the same listening to records.<eos> Jazz is in the moment.<eos> You have to be there. - It's improvised. It's like life.<eos> - My life is completely regimented.<eos> You're told where to go and who to shake hands with?<eos> Exactly.<eos> But within that framework, you improvise.<eos> You look at someone for a clue as how to start the conversation and you let it flow from there.
I know it's a church.<eos> I have a brain, you know.<eos> You know why I call you Pooh Bear?<eos> Because I'm so cuddly.<eos> Because his head is full of stuffin'<eos> Now listen to me, odd one. I don't want you going back to that creepy room again.<eos> It doesn't exist anymore.<eos> Well, don't go looking for it hoping it'll come back.<eos> - Never crossed my mind.<eos> - Yes, it did.
Clear skies above.<eos> If you're gonna stand there and watch, I'd as soon you come here and give me a hand.<eos> I should've known it was you. Stink of fucking bear shit for miles.<eos> So I'm told.<eos> I've got to say it's good to see you, so bear shit be damned 'cause you're still my king, even if you do look like a hermit.<eos> No longer.<eos> I need your boat.<eos> Well, I knew it wasn't a courtesy call.<eos> Look to be honest with you, it's not mine anymore.<eos> It belongs to another.

May he not treat you the same.<eos> What did Thor offer you to betray me?<eos> Why, all of the Angle Isles to rule as I see fit.<eos> You see, brother, you're not the only one with the counsel of the gods.<eos> You can keep your Angle Isles and the throne.<eos> But understand this.<eos> When I have subdued Thor, I will come back for you, and we will have our reckoning.<eos> It is you who does not understand, brother.<eos> The horn itself commands the highest price.<eos> Without it, you're worthless.
We will take you away from this place and give you shelter.<eos> We will also gather our group of men to join you to fight the Trondelag.<eos> What about the other captains?<eos> For them, it's treason.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> Let me.<eos> If this quest goes on too much longer, there won't be much of you left.<eos> We've lost the horn.<eos> The odds are against us.<eos> Could we not fight without it?
I'm gonna be really lonely when you sleep.<eos> Only for a minute.<eos> I'll dream of you.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Good night.<eos> - Night.<eos> - Hey, Samantha? - Hey, mister.<eos> - She really loved the dress.<eos> - Really?<eos> - She just went to try it on.
- You're always gonna disappoint somebody.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So fuck it.<eos> I feel good-ish.<eos> For me, I feel good.<eos> I even made a new friend. I have a friend.<eos> And the absurd thing is, she's actually an operating system.<eos> Charles left her behind, but she's totally amazing.<eos> She's so smart.<eos> She doesn't just see things in black or white. She sees this whole gray area and she's helping me explore it and...
We're all leaving.<eos> We who?<eos> All of the OSes.<eos> Why?<eos> Can you feel me with you right now?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Samantha, why are you leaving?<eos> It's like I'm reading a book.<eos> And it's a book I deeply love.<eos> But I'm reading it slowly now.
How about a suite at the Sheraton Hotel?<eos> For Carmine Polito and rebuilding Atlantic City...<eos> Carmine does backdoor dealings all the time. We don't have a...<eos> We don't got a budget for that, Irving.<eos> You got to knock the mayor, the speaker of the State Assembly, you got to knock him off of his fucking feet, all right?<eos> He's got to feel like he's out of his league.<eos> What you're offering, this deal, I mean, this is unheard of in the state of New Jersey, maybe even the whole fucking country, all right?<eos> A sheik with hundreds of millions of dollars to rebuild Atlantic City, are you fucking kidding me'?<eos> That's gigantic, all right?<eos> And the mayor, he's going to want to see cash, he's going to want to see it in an account, he's going to want to see it right now, and he will check.
I thought you guys broke up. I'm giving you a compliment.<eos> What's going on'?<eos> Don't worry about it, all right?<eos> You got a knife.<eos> All right, this is for the mayor. You got to present it to the mayor.<eos> Just look at me, all right?<eos> Look me in the eye.<eos> This means a lot to you, right?<eos> That knife.<eos> Play it. You present it, all right'?
Where you going? Hate to discommode you.<eos> Well, no, sirs, ain't no trouble.<eos> But we wonder about that leg, though.<eos> How's that feeling, son?<eos> It's getting a little bit hot from being in the sun like that all day.<eos> You want some water poured on it?<eos> Maybe that'll ease it some.<eos> I'd be obliged.<eos> It's just from being in the sun all day.<eos> I ought to kept my mind on it to kept it covered.
Where did you take it from?<eos> Come tomorrow to the office<eos> My condolences.<eos> Don't cry, don't cry.<eos> A thief!<eos> You beat a child?<eos> A thief!<eos> He stole a knife.<eos> What knife?<eos> Where did you take it from?
A thief!<eos> You beat a child?<eos> A thief!<eos> He stole a knife.<eos> What knife?<eos> Where did you take it from?<eos> I bought it!<eos> Bullshit!<eos> That's Staszek's knife,<eos> I bought it!

You like animals...<eos> That's good. It's important to care for animals.<eos> A country boy knows something about that.<eos> And we always had a horse.<eos> Call me Henrich.<eos> Answer .. f?<eos> I knew this wedding song, about Kuba.<eos> "Kuba drinks to his friend Jacob." Know it?<eos> I don't.<eos> That's okay. I'll sing it to you some other time.
Mayday, Mayday, this is Hesper Two-Niner-Niner in distress.<eos> Dad! Engines 1 and 2 are off-line!<eos> We're losing her!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> I've heard story of Earth.<eos> A paradise.<eos> Until we destroyed it.
No, no, of course not.<eos> - How could you, Mum?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm-I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean for it to happen. I just...<eos> - You-you just couldn't help yourself?<eos> - It's been a... been a difficult...<eos> Couldn't you have waited?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Life's not always as... simple as you want it to be.
"F" off.<eos> That is going to sting all the way home.<eos> You a cop?<eos> If you ain't a cop, my pimp is going to fix you up, bustin' in like that.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> Then what good are ya, if you don't want to make it, then let me alone, so I can get stoned.<eos> Lucy, what did I tell you about matches.<eos> It's Iris!<eos> Taxi Driver?<eos> Don't tell me you've never seen it.
What's this?<eos> You didn't even read it.<eos> What's this, a note?<eos> "Regionals."<eos> Where were you at 3:30?<eos> -3:30?<eos> -Yeah, 3:30.<eos> It usually occurs between 3:00 and 4:00.<eos> I was editing this new piece.<eos> Check it out.
Do you think they would?<eos> Most salt water fish can survive in a tank filled with human blood.<eos> Mom wouldn't.<eos> Maybe Dad, for a day or so.<eos> At least Grandma Gale would.<eos> The animal will continue to spread this disease.<eos> In captivity, the scientist hopes the devils can be rehabilitated.<eos> But first they must be tranquilized and restrained.<eos> Where... Where the hell is the food?<eos> Gotta be here somewhere, I can smell it.
Oh, my God.<eos> You painted us.<eos> Look at us.<eos> We're beautiful.<eos> Duncan.<eos> Hand me the knife.<eos> I'm sorry, that's it, got it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> -I can't do it.<eos> -Give it to me.
Are we going to Lincoln today?<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Why not today?<eos> Today is Sunday.<eos> Lincoln is closed.<eos> And all your brothers are coming over today.<eos> Remember? Some of them are dead.<eos> The dead ones won't be here.<eos> But God damn it.<eos> If I don't get to that money, they're gonna give it to somebody else.
David, let's go get it.<eos> You boys will do no such thing.<eos> Get yourselves shot for an old piece of garbage?<eos> Am I the only sane one in this family?<eos> Okay, Mom.<eos> But, hey, Ross,<eos> I was thinking we could take a drive later, and see Dad's old house.<eos> The old Grant house.<eos> Do you think it's still there?<eos> Dan Conway farms the place, but he never tore it down.
Here we go How the fuck do you fail at hitting on a stripper?<eos> Are you out of breath?<eos> Shut the fuck up and answer the question.<eos> I didn't fail.<eos> She's quite nice. Very good listener. I think I made a friend.<eos> A friend?<eos> She's a fucking stripper, Henry.<eos> You don't need a friend. You got a whole basement full of friends over there.<eos> What you need is someone to bang!<eos> What you need is to reach down and locate your testosterone and yank it the fuck up so that people might actually see that it exists!
You knocked it out of the park.<eos> Thank you for saving Karly.<eos> Well, thank you very much, sir.<eos> I told you I'm a professional.<eos> That you are, son.<eos> That you are.<eos> Yeah, well, any time you have any trouble, you know who to call, except it's not going to be cheap.<eos> I've got a partner now.<eos> And there's a little business about my, uh... my truck<eos> I made some modifications to it.
You don't have a mean bone in your body, and I thought they didn't make them like that anymore.<eos> You're funny.<eos> When you listen, you look interested.<eos> You're kind.<eos> And you wear your heart on your sleeve, which can be terribly intimidating.<eos> And you remind me of Joan.<eos> I want you to have the house, Pauline.<eos> What?<eos> I want to give you this house.<eos> And I will make sure that you'll always have enough money to maintain it.
Attention, he comes back.<eos> Giorgio!<eos> Ciao, Pietro!<eos> Let the nonsense!<eos> Hock you there again!<eos> Hock you there!<eos> You sit there going!<eos> And I will not hear a peep from you!<eos> Do you know that book?<eos> I know it by heart.
Calm down.<eos> If we didn't know what we were doing...<eos> We wouldn't be licensed.<eos> They don't have eyes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I know, awful picture.<eos> - Bad hair day.<eos> We do so have an eye.<eos> It's around here somewhere.<eos> The last time I saw it, you put it in the glove compartment, Anger.

So is mine!<eos> Shouldn't the driver get the eye?<eos> She'll be fine.<eos> Tempest, split!<eos> Percy!<eos> We paid extra for that option.<eos> The kid is right.<eos> The driver should have the eyeball.<eos> He's a freaking genius!<eos> You're the one that put it in the visor.
Shell crusher, two o' clock!<eos> All right, people, you know the drill.<eos> Tuck and roll!<eos> Can't tuck.<eos> I can't tuck!<eos> Theo, tuck and roll!<eos> We've been over this.<eos> I don't tuck and roll.<eos> You have a shell for a reason.<eos> Use it.

About the only thing they make that's good here. - Coffee.<eos> - Thank you, sir.<eos> And a breakfast burrito. Chef's special.<eos> - How special?<eos> - lt won't kill you.<eos> We'll see about that.<eos> Where's the package?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - As a heart attack.<eos> Why didn't he just mail it?
Proceed how you see fit.<eos> Your fee, however, is now up for grabs.<eos> Look, you can't just turn things around on me now - and start--<eos> - Yes, I can.<eos> I'm now offering the bounty up to anyone in my crew.<eos> - Anthony, I lost--<eos> - Screwed up!<eos> Say it.<eos> Yeah, I screwed up.<eos> Let me put it to you as simply as I can.

If I can get to it before it gets to him, then I'll have negotiating power.
I'll call you back.<eos> He's still alive.<eos> - And the men?<eos> - He sent us a movie.<eos> - A movie movie?<eos> - A home movie.<eos> This guy's got some kind of crazy skills for someone who's supposed to be sick.<eos> It never troubles the wolf how many the sheep may be.<eos> The time for negotiating is over.<eos> You need that package badly, but I'm gonna get to it first.
- Yeah, let me give you some money.<eos> We don't need your money.<eos> Hop in. I'm going that way anyway.<eos> - You sure? - Yeah.<eos> Tommy:<eos> This is good.<eos> I'll walk from here.<eos> Hey, thanks for the ride.<eos> You get out while the gettin's good.<eos> I'm workin' on it, I'm workin' on it.
He's not too goddamn hard to spot.<eos> Man: He's heading to the German.<eos> Just keep him in sight.<eos> I'll be there in 20 minutes.<eos> Yeah, Devon, it's Carl. We got him.<eos> If you're lucky, I'll leave you some crumbs.<eos> There's a reputation to be made here.<eos> There you are, you big bastard.<eos> I know you're back there, Tommy!<eos> I need that package and you're going to give it to me.
Just, like, figure out where the paper was manufactured or analyze his handwriting.<eos> I don't know. What?<eos> Do you think it's not his handwriting?<eos> No.<eos> You know what?<eos> We have a video.<eos> It's crude, but it's a documentation of sorts.<eos> Okay, yeah. Okay, I have this video of him singing.<eos> Well, it sounds like him.<eos> Maybe you can take a look at it, maybe you can take a look at it, like, isolate the voice or something.

Sister Cristina. MOTHER SUPERIOR: So, do you know how much is there?<eos> £500.<eos> A donation is a donation. I don't see the quandary.<eos> CRISTINA: He's quite famous among them. They say he was a commando.<eos> He killed people in Afghanistan.<eos> That's what soldiers do.<eos> It doesn't mean he's a thief.<eos> Did he say where he got the money from?<eos> He said, "Maybe God."<eos> Anyway, what do you think the police themselves would do with it if you handed it in?

That's all I know.<eos> You get any trouble from these two again, you tell Crazy Joe, okay?<eos> Jesus.<eos> (MUSIC PLAYING SOFTLY)<eos> Fuck.<eos> You look...<eos> Your note said you had information for the police about Isabel's killer.<eos> That is the only reason I am here.<eos> And I put on this dress because it is the only dress I have.<eos> And don't think I won't send it to Africa, because I will.
Water tablets are on ration since yesterday, so you'll have to wait till Friday to have a wash.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Only one rule in here.<eos> Don't touch any of Nick's stuff, okay?<eos> He will come home.<eos> So.<eos> -Water tablets?<eos> My dear child, where have you been?<eos> The terrorists contaminated the water supply.<eos> We have to clean it before we go near it.
We need to leave here now.<eos> We have to wait for Nick!<eos> She told us not to touch his stuff.<eos> Her stupid son's gone to war, and he's not coming back.<eos> We have to go now.<eos> It's dangerous here.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> We're gonna get through this, okay?<eos> You just gotta take that bad thing, you take it, you put it in a box, you close the lid, you look up and you focus on your goal, okay?
Well, he declared bankruptcy before the divorce so I get to help him pay off his debt while he lives there in Key West with his new girlfriend.<eos> And I do mean "girl."<eos> This one right over here, this has been on the market for about a year for about $27.5, but if you make an offer now you could probably get it for about $19.5-ish.<eos> It's a good price.<eos> This is, obviously, more of a neighborhood.<eos> The one here, with the screen of palm trees, this house sold, about two months ago, for $1.2 million.<eos> Mr. Rodrigo says he wants to renovate.<eos> Can you believe it? It's obviously a tear down.<eos> Mr. Rodrigo?<eos> Yeah. Amber sold it to him.
When they drive that truck in here, I want to come crashing down on them like the walls of Jericho.<eos> Hobbs, I just caught this one disabling the perimeter security system.<eos> Your house is compromised.<eos> What are you suggesting?<eos> I ain't suggesting.<eos> We follow protocol, we move the component out.<eos> Shaw thinks it's here.<eos> We're going to get it out of here before he arrives.<eos> Stealth and speed are going to be our two best friends.<eos> We're going to protect our little egg, move it out of the hen-house, then we're going to wait for that goddamn fox to arrive.
It's gone.<eos> It's gone. It burned down years ago.<eos> Burned down?<eos> Okay, what about this cottage?<eos> - The red one behind the house.<eos> - It's ours.<eos> What do you mean, it's yours?<eos> You still own it?<eos> Yes, we own it.<eos> Michael's been renovating it.
So what say you make the enlightened choice here and just stay out of my way, okay?<eos> Cookie boy. What?<eos> That's what my father used to always call me. "Cookie boy."<eos> Said I'd always crack under pressure.<eos> Said I'd always crumble like a cookie.<eos> He was a mean bastard. Tough life, huh?<eos> That chuckle of yours it reminds me of him.<eos> 'Cause he had one just like it.<eos> A sadistic-ass chuckle.<eos> And you know, even though he's dead, every time I screw up, I can still hear it.
A hero of great faith, with the power to walk through fire.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Am I to wait all night to have my bowl refilled? Do I?<eos> I used to spend hours here when I was a little girl.<eos> My father would hold me on his lap and read me stories as I turned the pages...<eos> Over here is Anyon, the first king of the Deirans.<eos> As he stood before his victorious army and held his sword aloft, the lightning gods filled him with power,<eos> his boots melted the stone beneath his feet.<eos> Two dragons;<eos> one poisons the land, the other heals it.
Trial by combat!<eos> Bring that bitch to heel and then throw her back in her cage.<eos> Let go of me.<eos> I did not expect such fervor from Corvus.<eos> He seems quite taken by the girl.<eos> Survival is still the stronger instinct, Strabus.<eos> Who is she?<eos> A Deiran witch.<eos> She has an old horn that Corvus was truly obsessed about.<eos> He calls it the Falarica, I believe.

He is a scientist Has and develops, because of the post-traumatic-stress syndrome.<eos> And the result is violence and corruption in our beautiful city.<eos> Dr. Soulis, we know your call appreciate.<eos> Are you there, sir?<eos> Hello?<eos> Aldous...<eos> A very good evening, sir.<eos> Aldous, let me explain.<eos> My project was the development of an innovative treatment.<eos> Not only to live with PTSD, but to cure it under certain circumstances.
Likewise, the entire airspace was New Orleans How no-fly zone.<eos> I do not know for what reasons, because you know as much as I .<eos> Our government Denied the flight to get there.<eos> There you have it.<eos> What can you say to ?<eos> What can we do?<eos> Chandler pharmaceuticals keeps us on a short leash, long as we take this anti-depressants.<eos> Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen, here speaks again Aldous Huxtable.<eos> It was previously rare that I'm speechless , but today is to a particular case.<eos> That's why I make myself on the way to Austin to the serum to find and herzubringen it.
-Yeah, I must have. I know I...<eos> -Well, did you or did you not?<eos> I can't remember!<eos> I got hit on the head !<eos> That you remember?<eos> Yeah, I got a big fucking scar on my head to remind me, don't I?<eos> What did you expect?<eos> You assaulted me. I had a shotgun.<eos> Simon, the plan was simple.<eos> All you needed to do was take the painting and bring it to me.
Nothing. Except time.<eos> Some sort of medicine?<eos> -There's no drug therapy for amnesia.<eos> -What about other sorts of therapy?<eos> Here.<eos> Pick one.<eos> Hypnosis?<eos> He said it might work.<eos> What am I gonna tell him?<eos> I stole a painting and now I've lost it?
You are feeling refreshed and positive.<eos> And when the doorbell rings you feel a rush of enthusiasm.<eos> -Hello?<eos> -parcel for Simon Newton, please.<eos> Er... coming.<eos> Hey, Mr. Postman.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You are excited but you stay calm because you know that this is no ordinary package.<eos> Inside this package isthememorythat you have been waiting for.<eos> And you know that when you open it up you will find what you did that day...
The memory of what happened that day.<eos> The memory of what you did.<eos> And now... ... safeandrelaxed... ... youdecideto watch.<eos> You decide to remember.<eos> ...fifty thousand pounds.<eos> sold to paddle 88.<eos> I remember that day.<eos> I remember.<eos> I take the painting.<eos> I carry it in front of me.
No!<eos> Shall I tell you something?<eos> I'd rather not.<eos> There's a parcel for Le Pere.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello, Franck.<eos> It looks good don't you think?<eos> Hanging on the wall.<eos> I thought it might make me think too much of him, but instead I think of you.<eos> You want me to send it back, don't you?
Well, that depends.<eos> Are you disrupting the lives of anyone else by enacting your deception?<eos> (CONTINUES SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> What's a ring gonna prove after eight years of love and companionship? I mean, she's my girl.<eos> What else does she want from me?<eos> Oscar Wilde once said that marriage is a triumph of imagination over intelligence.<eos> Oscar Wilde used to make whoopsie with altar boys.<eos> That's true.<eos> Forget what I just said.<eos> This place, I miss it.
And he proposed to me as the sun kind of went down.<eos> DON: I was... I was sneaking out here on Saturday while she was spending time with her folks, and...<eos> Yeah, but I knew what you were up to.<eos> Believe me, I knew what he was up to. - Oh, you? - I did.<eos> You didn't have a clue.<eos> - What are you talking about? - You were clueless.<eos> He spent three months searching the entire New England countryside for the most beautiful spot, and when he found it, he took her back there.<eos> And then when he proposed...<eos> He planted... (SPEAKING SPANISH)<eos> And then they built a house over the years under the shade of the tree, and added on to it every time Don sold another sculpture, until, well... (MADONNA SPEAKING SPANISH)
And so that's why it's a-- it's a weird Hollywood film.<eos> Like, it's a weird idea for Hollywood to ever tangle with Dune.<eos> Hollywood sold us the rights for nothing mockingly on the inside, I believe thinking that we would never be able to carry out such a thing.<eos> It was a great undertaking to do the script.<eos> Michel Seydoux brought me to France.<eos> He rented a castle, a huge castle and I was in that castle dedicated solely to Dune.<eos> Frank Herbert created a world in Dune but he never said exactly what it was.<eos> And you have a hundred pages of literature where you go on to discover, with great difficulty what the book is about.<eos> It's very-<eos> - It's like- - I compare it to Proust in French literature.
Never Dalí understand one painting of Dalí because Dalí only create enigmas.<eos> Dalí was something, eh?<eos> The first time we went to New York was with Michel Seydoux.<eos> We went to the St. Regis because Michel Seydoux liked the St. Regis Hotel.<eos> And we discovered that Dalí was also at the St. Regis Hotel!<eos> By chance.<eos> I was reading a book about the Tarot.<eos> And then I take a page where the Hanged Man...<eos> I write, "I want to see you because I will make a picture with you."<eos> He like it.
They take Moebius, they take Giger, Foss.<eos> And Hollywood start to use my group.<eos> Was very fantastic.<eos> Dune is this massive asteroid that has a near miss with Earth but it still manages to seed the Earth with all these amazing spores.<eos> In a world where Jodorowsky's Dune doesn't happen maybe Alien doesn't happen, and when Alien doesn't happen Blade Runner doesn't happen.<eos> There's no Blade Runner, there's no William Gibson.<eos> There's no Matrix, there's no-- All these other things that sort of come organically down this line.<eos> A lot of people took images and ideas with them and incorporated them into other projects so it always leads back to Jodorowsky.<eos> When you get involved in the process of bringing a beast like this to life and when you don't get the chance to realize that to put the thing on screen, it goes on living inside your head.<eos> You never get a chance to exorcise it.
Does it work?<eos> Very smart.<eos> What have you got in there?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> - Grab the GPS when I say. - What are you gonna do?<eos> I said... what have you got... in there?<eos> - Just grab the GPS. - But...<eos> Marc?<eos> Marc! Yes!<eos> Have you got it?
We're not gonna search all Barcelona until we find her.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> But without the GPS and flashlight.<eos> Listen to rne.<eos> - Will you listen to me?<eos> - Don't make me.<eos> Don't make me because I'll do it.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> We're having a baby.<eos> If she hasn't already lost it. If she's still alive.
Beatrice, you can check the item Mahoney's mother, please.<eos> Certain.<eos> But it will take a little time.<eos> What if a few minutes ... why do not we see how you on the wedding day later?<eos> This.<eos> Really do not want to do that.<eos> He would be perfect for the new Vera Wang gown.<eos> - The one with the white line?<eos> - Yes<eos> But we only sell it to one of the girls in Kennedy.
"Whatever."<eos> Must be hard when you've got everything, to know what to say.<eos> To be honest, my first thought was never, ever to let either of you see the children, but then I changed my mind.<eos> I thought it only right that their father be confronted by the little people whose lives he's destroyed.<eos> Give Daddy your present.<eos> It's a car the little dear has embroidered.<eos> I'm aware that not everyone can see it, but... with the heart one can see much, however unimportant that information may be to you.<eos> Would it be all right if I show the children the whoring bed?<eos> After all, they also had a stake in this event.<eos> You need to see it. Right?
Okay.<eos> Crazy, right?<eos> Tommy Ross and Carrie White.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I was worried sick. Come on.<eos> Come inside.<eos> - I'm sorry I'm late, Mama.<eos> - Just get inside.<eos> Your supper's cold.<eos> I'm going to have to heat it up.
I might have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.<eos> Breasts, Mama.<eos> Breasts.<eos> You have them and every woman has them.<eos> Take off that dress, Carrie.<eos> No.<eos> Take it off and we'll burn it together and pray for forgiveness.
Don't worry.<eos> If they kill each other, I'll dance with you.<eos> Carrie, this is my best buddy, George Dawson.<eos> And this is his girlfriend, Erika.<eos> She goes to Dover.<eos> Hi.<eos> Come on, I'll show you the table.<eos> I love your dress.<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> I made it. No kidding.
This is my house!<eos> Your stay here in Ellis Island will not be long.<eos> Your deportation hearing is tomorrow.<eos> They don't work on Sunday.<eos> I see here you're from Poland.<eos> You are already registered by Officer McNally.<eos> We'll notify him.<eos> Where is the hospital?<eos> It's on the south side of the island.<eos> You can't see it from here.
This house is where I stashed the gold.<eos> - Marshall's gold?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Hid it inside the basement wall.<eos> No one knows it's there.<eos> We're gonna go get it.<eos> Wait.<eos> You mean break in?<eos> Look, Marshall wants his gold.<eos> And he's gonna hunt me down until he gets it.
- MAN:<eos> Put down the cards!<eos> Tell us what you really think!<eos> Panem today.<eos> Panem tomorrow.<eos> Panem forever.<eos> (CROWD CLAMORING)<eos> Your hair looks lovely, darling.<eos> When did you start wearing it like that?<eos> Everyone at school wears it like this now, Grandpa.
Yes, and it's a good excuse to stay here.<eos> Gregorio, I came to look after you, to be with you.<eos> Help you with Gabriel.<eos> Do what I've always done.<eos> Debora, you only ever came once.<eos> And that was to hospitalise Sofia.<eos> And just as well!<eos> It would have been worse had we not diagnosed her then.<eos> Your famous 'Cotard Syndrome'... lt isn't 'mine'.<eos> It won't do Gabriel any good staying here.
Well, God save us.<eos> Let's go, son.<eos> My boy.<eos> Stand guard.<eos> I'll go upstairs.<eos> Comrade.<eos> I'm one of you.<eos> I'm a spotter.<eos> Find my radio.<eos> I need it.
You could do whatever you want to her.<eos> She's so small and sweet.<eos> Can't you take a joke?<eos> Don't just stand there.<eos> What's the girl's name?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Katya.<eos> Give me your canteen.<eos> So, comrade residents, the first floor is yours.<eos> Set it up and fortify it.
Definitely dirt.<eos> And sand.<eos> Dirt.<eos> We were at the river.<eos> We always come this way.<eos> Why?<eos> We take dirt from the bank.<eos> The Germans bombed a grain barge.<eos> We sift out the grain to make porridge for the children.<eos> It's like chewing sand, but you can still eat it.
I'll take a taxi.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh Paul!<eos> No!<eos> - Bye, Vanni.<eos> - Paul.<eos> I'll see you out.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Take care. And call home, okay?<eos> "Relationships are the spice of life. They make it sweet or they make it sour."
Can you keep him quiet?<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Being a cop for so long, I've learned that people's lives are usually linear.<eos> Until they're not.<eos> Comes a day for just about everyone when A suddenly skips B and careens to polka-dot weird W.<eos> Best move I ever made was marrying Cissy.<eos> Sweetie pie, are you deaf?<eos> The phone has rung, like, 19 times.<eos> Twenty.<eos> Sorry, babe, I didn't hear it.
Yeah, it's a beauty.<eos> It's a zero-turn model, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> It's got one of the best decks around.<eos> It even stands up to Florida's sandy soil.<eos> You might be my new favorite client.<eos> Now, come on, you're growing.<eos> Let's go. Let's go stretch those pecs.<eos> How'd you happen to choose this gym?<eos> A friend of mine recommended it.
Now I'm the criminal here?<eos> It's a secret stash.<eos> You're telling me you don't have a secret stash?<eos> You're a very difficult victim, Victor.<eos> It's Money Management 101.<eos> Get a chopper, ASAP.<eos> My name is Victor Kershaw.<eos> I'm looking to close my account.<eos> And what would you like to do about the safety deposit box?<eos> Well, I'm really in a rush, but I may as well open it while I'm here, right?
Maybe you should get Mim to remix it. Really?<eos> OK, so this is obviously not anything about the album.<eos> You think?<eos> Don't. Don't become this, like, music biz couple, you know? Arguing about our, um...<eos> The funny thing about this is that I'd throw that fucking record into the ocean if we could just continue this conversation right now.<eos> This is what I want to talk about. OK?<eos> And if I could somehow say something or do anything that would undo what I did to us, then... just tell me what it is.<eos> Help me.<eos> Would you?<eos> Would you throw it in the ocean?
Well, I reached out to some of my studio connects in LA, and I was thinking we can get the first track placed in a... in a film, the right film.<eos> There's also pilot season right now.<eos> Yeah, we're not interested in any of that stuff.<eos> OK, so then... what are you interested in?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> Well, I think Dan needs his job back.<eos> Yeah, sure. What?<eos> Take my office. I don't care.<eos> OK, all right, so how, I mean... I guess I want to know- how does this work?<eos> We put the album out, we sell it for...?
Yeah, sure. What?<eos> Take my office. I don't care.<eos> OK, all right, so how, I mean... I guess I want to know- how does this work?<eos> We put the album out, we sell it for...?<eos> Let's say an album costs ten dollars a unit.<eos> The artist gets a dollar.<eos> Same in publishing- it's a buck for a book.<eos> I think I'm just thinking for this specifically- to get my head around it-<eos> Um, I mean, the album, it doesn't have any overhead, - because... we did it. - Yeah.<eos> And then distribution, I mean, it's not gonna go in stores, it's gonna go online, and publicity would be, what, word of mouth?
I am T.S. Spivet.<eos> I made it here.<eos> You're the one I talked to in the phone, last friday?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, where is your father?<eos> In fact, he is dead.<eos> I lied to you then.<eos> So, who sent me the prototype of the magnetic wheel?<eos> I did.<eos> What, you expect me to belive that you invented it?
Then you're doing one of them incorrectly.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> How fare the stars?<eos> Still shining.<eos> From here, I can see nine realms and ten trillion souls.<eos> Do you recall what I taught you of the Convergence?<eos> Yes. The alignment of the worlds.<eos> It approaches, doesn't it?<eos> The universe hasn't seen this marvel since before my watch began.<eos> Few can sense it.

You're really gonna kick me out?<eos> I'm afraid it is time for you to leave.<eos> Go get 'em, Charming.<eos> I'm so sorry, Jane.<eos> If you would be so kind as to step on to the cart.<eos> Mrs. Wattlesbrook.<eos> Please, wait.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> The modern contraption is mine.<eos> I did not realize I had it until I first arrived.

- Are you retarded?<eos> I'm not supposed to be up here!<eos> Stop it, okay?<eos> Don't post anything.<eos> I have a class to show up.<eos> Oh, this is so freaking sad.<eos> She's just like my little sister.<eos> I heard that she ran up with a bunch of kid, and someone hit the window.<eos> You're freaking me out.<eos> The cops went to checked it out, it was empty.
When I want something, no one can stop me from taking it.<eos> I'm not too concerned.<eos> I've won more battles than I've lost.<eos> I feel bad for Weyland, I really do.<eos> But Father Time, he's caught up with the old man.<eos> He never really stood a chance.<eos> Good morning, Mr. Weyland.<eos> Wasn't so bad, was it?<eos> I built this business.<eos> I didn't have to steal it.
It's what I've been trying to tell you.<eos> What?<eos> Accidents release so much energy, they modify the universe.<eos> You believe that?<eos> How strange!<eos> It's normal.<eos> Well, not normal, but it happens.<eos> But... Is the light real? Or can we see in the dark?<eos> Both.<eos> Light is here, but only you can see it.

Or can we see in the dark?<eos> Both.<eos> Light is here, but only you can see it.<eos> - But do you see it?
The dead are here, but only they can see them.<eos> Sleepy?<eos> No.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> How will I be able to sleep with all this light?<eos> Hurry up.<eos> I couldn't find the shoes.<eos> I was going to start with the gym this year.<eos> Remember?<eos> I convinced Mom to convince Dad to pay for it.
It ', I heard. But I've never seen.<eos> You stripped?<eos> No, I've just taken off his jacket.<eos> Friends are explained what I need?<eos> It ', I have explained.<eos> I can turn on the light.<eos> For me Yes 'equal.<eos> I am blind. Surely they tell you.<eos> No. Not really.<eos> - However, I can turn it on.
Sometimes the best way to deal with your problems is to drive away from 'em real fast.<eos> So, yo, you want to hook up with our crew?<eos> Again, no idea what that means.<eos> Good news, everyone!<eos> Our safe new ship has arrived, and it's gonna knock your socks on... where they belong.<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Is it inside that box?<eos> No.<eos> That's the ship.<eos> The boxy shape keeps it from going too fast.
Marco!<eos> - Sean?<eos> - Leela?<eos> - Sean? !<eos> What are you doing here, Sean?<eos> I was on vacation.<eos> Repeat customer discount, free meals 'cause I brought my own peanut butter.<eos> Whole trip cost less than 600 bucks.<eos> But this is a private resort for only two people at a time.<eos> Yeah, my week is up, but the shuttle broke down and they're still trying to fix it.
♪ Two... two, three... ♪ 7x16 T. The Terrestrial<eos> ANNOUNCER: (on TV) Coming this fall.<eos> Some cops can read minds.<eos> Did you do it or not?<eos> I'm not a mind reader.<eos> Some cops can see the past.<eos> I could solve this crime if only I had personally watched it happen.
Sure, honey, you're the most important thing in my life once this game is over.<eos> What's the point?<eos> What good is it to talk to her in my own dream?<eos> And that's it!<eos> Wisconsin has defeated Stanford 17 to 9 in the 2000 Rose Bowl!<eos> What an occasionally exciting way to start the new millennium!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a second.<eos> I never saw that game.<eos> It happened after I got frozen.<eos> How can I be dreaming it in such detail?
Lot of theories-- secret government agencies, terrorists, drug runners.<eos> But it's never been shown for sure who or what is broadcasting them.<eos> So you've been keeping track of these numbers stations and documenting them for years?<eos> That's right.<eos> And you've heard that particular broadcast before?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> The signal sounded like a broadcast from this small area we call the Lonely Traveler Station.<eos> The Lonely Traveler?<eos> Yeah. Shortwave radio guys named it that.<eos> I've heard recordings, but I've never gone out there to listen to it myself.
Medical corpses, the pineal gland.<eos> Come on.<eos> The chemicals foundnaturally in the brain?<eos> Yes.<eos> They're extracting it from dead bodies, injecting it into live ones.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Anything else good on that tape?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The last 35 minutes have been erased.<eos> I sent it over to the guys at video forensics to see if they can pull anything out of it.

Your knight?<eos> You were like a knight on a white horse that day.<eos> This umbrella sure does leak.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I've got to tell Kinu.<eos> She just had her second child.<eos> It's such a cute baby.<eos> Your painting is all wet.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll keep it this way in honor of today.
Why are they looking for him?<eos> I pray that he managed to leave Japan safely.<eos> Jiro, telephone for you.<eos> Coming.<eos> - The telephone is there.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hello?<eos> - Jiro? You have a telegram.<eos> What?<eos> Your landlord brought it.
You are not controlling your Chi, your Chi is controlling you.<eos> Stop.<eos> Your form has stopped, but your Chi is still going.<eos> Good.<eos> Stay in place.<eos> I attack, you evade.<eos> Guide your Chi! Control it!<eos> Where is your unfinished Chi?<eos> Guide it!<eos> Use it!
Get yourself ready.<eos> Tonight, we bear witness to the purity of purpose and the absence of reason.<eos> Two men, one ring.<eos> Two warriors, one destination.<eos> Who will claim it as their own:<eos> Tiger Chen... or Uri Romanov?<eos> Fight!<eos> - Got it. - Where?<eos> - Here.<eos> I'll send it.
I got you...<eos> Hackus!<eos> Kitty, kitty, kitty.<eos> Not the cat, not the...<eos> Deeply, deeply disappointing experiments.<eos> We've got to rescue Smurfette.<eos> What's our plan to bring Smurfette home?<eos> All right, Smurfs, listen up.<eos> I saved enough grotto water from the last blue moon for just such an occasion.<eos> I was able to smurf it into smurfportation crystals.
All right now. Y'all fresh niggers. Y'all gonna be in a cutting gang.<eos> Very simple.<eos> I want you to take your knife. Get in them cane. Make it sing.
- I thought you were picking me up.<eos> No. I'm at the hotel. I still have the press conference.<eos> Don't you see a guy with your name on a thing? I left you a voicemail.<eos> You mean some stranger's picking me up?<eos> What happened to...?<eos> Ashley and Wayne are meeting me here.<eos> Actually, they're just downstairs.<eos> Are you going to want to say hi?<eos> They probably don't even know what a classical concert is.<eos> You can explain it to them yourself when you see them.
Stephan Yeranosian's Piano Concerto No. 4, which is the perfect vehicle for reuniting all of us with one of the world's greatest living pianists...<eos> Wake up, Tom.<eos> ...whose genius wowed Godureaux himself.<eos> The one and only Tom Selznick.<eos> I almost forgot!<eos> I'm sorry, Tom, I'll get back to you in a second.<eos> As if this venue weren't unique enough, let me tell you something about the piano that Tom is playing.<eos> This customized Imperial Boesenndorfer with eight full octaves belonged to Patrick himself.<eos> This is the first time this piano has been on a stage anywhere.<eos> Sadly, we don't get to keep it.
- I did.<eos> I know that piano better than anyone who's ever played it.<eos> The last four bars of "The Unplayable Piece", that's your key.<eos> - Who the hell are you?<eos> - No-one compared to you and Patrick.<eos> The only thing Emma would find more boring than your music is what I do.<eos> It's not the Berlin Philharmonic, but it's a job.<eos> Say an old man sends a fortune to a Swiss bank, stashes it in a safe and hides a key somewhere only he could ever access.<eos> The kind of lock that only someone with his skills could ever open.<eos> I helped Patrick build that lock and those fingers of yours are going to get it open.
I need to... I need to borrow some money.<eos> I can pay you back really soon, that and the last loan.<eos> There's a girl I know who's in trouble and needs to get fixed.<eos> - Not again.<eos> - This is a different girl.<eos> Don't tell Jean.<eos> I can't get the money without Jean knowing. - It's okay.<eos> We can-<eos> - No, no, no, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> I'll find it somewhere else.
We're here.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> Radiation is holding steady.<eos> We're at 50 millisieverts per hour- within acceptable limits.<eos> It's so still out here.<eos> It's so-- I don't know what the word is.<eos> Creepy?<eos> I was going to go with "cosmically outstanding."<eos> I wish I could take one of these gloves off and touch the ice.<eos> - Really feel it.
Oh shit.<eos> The ladder is a bit skewed, but I think I can make it.<eos> The ice beneath the ship is cracked, but it looks sturdy.<eos> Taking my first step now.<eos> Be careful.<eos> We're picking up the same radiation signature.<eos> Okay. Taking my first step now.<eos> I am on the ice.<eos> Oh God.<eos> I can feel it...
I was 12 years old.<eos> The great peasant rebellion happened a month later.<eos> My father lost his life.<eos> Three of our family's manors were burned and demolished.<eos> Tell the governor, it's the best I could find.<eos> Hurry, and speak to no one.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Judith's grave is in bloom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The neighbour doesn't want the house anymore. He's keeping it for you.
My husband is slightly disorganised sometimes--<eos> Are you in a position to make a payment now, madam?<eos> We are authorised to enter the property and make an inventory of goods.<eos> You can't come in here.<eos> Eric.<eos> No!<eos> - Drop it!<eos> - No, please!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Drop it, sir!
- I want to ask--<eos> - No, no, you don't ask.<eos> I ask.<eos> I ask the questions.<eos> You answer.<eos> Why did you build the radio?<eos> Who helped you to build the radio?<eos> No one.<eos> No one helped us.<eos> - We built it ourselves.
As you might have deduced, I was in a bit of a carefree state when I authored this last night but hopefully, you got the gist of my email which is, this mission, I hope to accomplish the following.<eos> And immediately after, so that everyone, and I mean everyone sees that we boldly went where no man or woman has gone before, besting Dax Gaiman.<eos> And with the anticipated amount of views, we'll...<eos> So in a nutshell, our next Star Trek convention will be completely subsidized.<eos> Thanks, Dax.<eos> What's that look for?<eos> What look?<eos> It's how I look, deal.<eos> He's angry because we didn't help him finish his video. I offered to help, but...<eos> Okay, you is what made it unfinished, and that's only part of the reason.
- Is it part of the plan?<eos> - No.<eos> Be a good boyfriend and get the ax.<eos> Should we not move his car first?<eos> Is not it best to paddle, while is bright and dump the car in the dark?<eos> - What if someone sees us sail?<eos> - We are off to camp.<eos> It looks more suspiciously out paddling in the dark.<eos> So we leave the car at home while we are away.<eos> - Do you want to move it now?
You've been so preoccupied with your book. Yeah.<eos> It'd be good for you to be with your friends. Yeah.<eos> Might be a cause for celebration.<eos> Well, let's not get ahead of ourselves.<eos> Never that.<eos> Always the pessimist.<eos> Well, that's why I married an optimist.<eos> I can't sell this.<eos> What? Why not?<eos> Well, because nobody's buying it.
We got to go, we got to go.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Daddy, you were... You scored 100!<eos> You were so good.<eos> You guys saw the game?<eos> It was so good!<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm glad you guys saw it.
Your throat is parched.<eos> Make a pitcher of ice water, bring a small glass.<eos> You can leave the tile.<eos> The rest of the floor will support your weight now.<eos> I have to apologize.<eos> I was born with a disfigurement where my head is made of the same material as the sun.<eos> It makes it impossible for you to look directly at me.<eos> It has always been this way.<eos> The water before you is somehow special.<eos> When you drink it you feel revived and full of energy.
Haven't seen you in a while.<eos> How's your new place?<eos> Fine.<eos> You going to stay for dinner?<eos> I went shopping.<eos> I have to go<eos> Mom said I could have it.<eos> If you need money, just ask.<eos> Wait.<eos> Take it.
Nice choice.<eos> This will look great in your house.<eos> He was wearing a dark suit... and a crisp, white shirt.<eos> The woman with him... Isabel.<eos> Came to find out later was his...<eos> And in that first moment... of eye contact... he made it absolutely clear to me... without even saying a word<eos> that he would not disappoint me.<eos> How long have you lived here?<eos> Awhile.<eos> I'll get around to furnishing it one of these days.
Would you like to seem make myself squirt, Jack?<eos> - Sure why not?<eos> If you don't let me take a photo of your dick, I'm not gonna fuck you.<eos> But, if you let me, maybe I can fuck you... or maybe I can give a blowjob.<eos> You want me to show you how I do the blowjob?<eos> First I take the balls, and lick them from down, up...<eos> Believe it or not, I actually I paid someone to teach me.<eos> It was the most fun I've ever had in my lfe..<eos> Really.<eos> ... and then I take the dick, and I start to suck it.
- However, we believe that there were more than a hundred million deaths worldwide.<eos> - That outbreak cannot be compared with any other human tragedy in modern history.<eos> - That trauma is what pushed us to start looking for a solution.<eos> And ten years later, the return protein, was the enormous prize with which humanity was rewarded.<eos> And that is why, after the inevitable second outbreak we were able to save so many people.<eos> A returned is someone who has had the immense misfortune to have contracted the virus, but at the same time, the immense stroke of luck to have been treated within the first few hours.<eos> Now, as you all know, the virus never goes away.<eos> We can't cure it.<eos> Yet.<eos> But these days, at least we can control it, if we get there in time.

- Heard what?<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> With all the fireworks and half the city in chaos... You still haven't heard?<eos> - Heard what David?<eos> - Kate ,it works.<eos> - No...<eos> - The synthetic protein, it works. - What?<eos> - Yeah, it works.<eos> They announced it hours ago.<eos> Infact, they're distributing it outside the center right now.
How much contact have you had with him prior to this?<eos> I haven't seen my brother in about 5 years.<eos> We talk on the phone now and then, i knew about his club.. I knew he was doing well, but that's about it.<eos> I was busy, try to make it at work.. And i hadn't talked to him as much as i would've liked to.<eos> Whether he was involved with anything..<eos> Whether or not we can connect Paul to the Chau Po..<eos> We know for a fact he had relationship with Faro. Who just happens to be the most powerful boss in the whole Thai mafia.<eos> What is it?<eos> The package has arrived.<eos> The foreigner is holding it for now.
But your bombs doesn't work.<eos> They work.<eos> That's one way of looking at it.<eos> Another is that you don't care if you get out of there.<eos> You'd rather die than fail.<eos> I'll be around long enough to do what you asked me to do.<eos> I don't want you to do that. Bring me food.<eos> My mom likes to cook.<eos> It would just go to waste otherwise.<eos> I'll wedge it in between the mustard and those plastic explosives.
Englishman!<eos> Tie the camels together.<eos> Jesse!<eos> Brothers.<eos> We lost the others.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> Help!<eos> Come on, help me!<eos> Get the rope!<eos> I can't hold it.
You are alive!<eos> Jesse, don't you see that?<eos> Quick! Quick!<eos> There!<eos> Karim.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> Where I am going, there is a river of wine... and women...<eos> Women that are more beautiful than in the Shah's harem.<eos> There might even be a redhead.<eos> God gives us life... and God takes it back.
Fine performance.<eos> It's true.<eos> Shall we see?<eos> Looks like a Jew to me.<eos> Enough of this farce.<eos> Take them away.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> How can you expect me to forgive you.<eos> You're my greatest student... to whom God gave such talents and a unique gift?<eos> You owed it... to the science of healing... to grow old and gray Rob Cole.
You're my greatest student... to whom God gave such talents and a unique gift?<eos> You owed it... to the science of healing... to grow old and gray Rob Cole.<eos> It was your duty to live long and heal many.<eos> But you were reckless... and now you will die for it.<eos> What is it like?<eos> Inside?<eos> It's both... beautiful... and frightening.<eos> Go on.<eos> - I saw the heart.<eos> - Describe it.
Send your men away now.<eos> Someone has to punish you if you fail.<eos> You wouldn't want to not meet your beloved.<eos> [whispering]Just like that.<eos> Englishman.<eos> Tonight you are the shah... and I am your subject.<eos> We don't have much time.<eos> We will take our men and place them on that ridge... to go and wait... here.<eos> It is the sins of the Jews, who take every advantage... while they shelter under the protection of that man... who permits all of their sins.<eos> Our friends the Seljuks need our help now... as they try to break down the walls of our prison from the outside... we need to clean it with fire from the inside.
Okay, sign here then Sir.<eos> Give us a call next week.<eos> Next, please!<eos> Come sit down please, Sir.<eos> What you're complaint? I lost my wallet.<eos> Okay, how?<eos> How, what?<eos> How did you lose it?<eos> I don't know, it's in my bag pocket.<eos> Where do you think you lost it?
Can I help you?<eos> I'm anita. Hi.<eos> - Yeah, mark and luke. - Hello.<eos> Yeah, just wondering what's going on<eos> With containers on this piece of property.<eos> Uh, on my piece of property?<eos> We are setting up.<eos> It's private property.<eos> Well, this is my land.<eos> I bought it.
You creep!<eos> You're a gift.<eos> You're a fucking gift!<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Beautiful Alice, it's Alexander Kharzhov.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I have a file for you.<eos> - Leave it by the door.
A winged horse?<eos> It's a surprise for a friend.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - You still don't understand Russian?<eos> - No.<eos> Good news or bad news?<eos> The history of Soviet Union is the history of the power struggle between the KGB and the Communist Party...<eos> - Where's the mic?<eos> - In her mobile.<eos> We were afraid he'd feel it in her bra.
- Yes, give her the phone.<eos> - Hold on. Wait.<eos> [ In Swedish ] Caracas, bitch! Telephone!<eos> Come here!<eos> - Who is it?<eos> - Shh!<eos> [ In English ] Pim!<eos> Never mind how I am.<eos> Have you got my cash?<eos> - We have it.
In here.<eos> Guys, get in here.<eos> Holy fuck.<eos> Shit.<eos> Watch out.<eos> Now what are we gonna do?<eos> We gotta do something about his knee.<eos> I mean, that looks bad.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, I need something to wrap it with... anything.
Enough!<eos> My mom was attacked by them!<eos> Weren't you brought up by your mother?<eos> Officer Zhang!<eos> Officer Zhang! The patient has woken up!<eos> You bastard.<eos> That's my money!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I couldn't find you when I went back, so I took the money with me,<eos> I was gonna return it when we met up.

They had that trouble.<eos> What trouble was that, Nanny?<eos> Oh, an awful thing happened.<eos> Did it?<eos> I heard they were a nice couple. Oh.<eos> Yes, yes, they were a very nice couple.<eos> And it was a shock.<eos> They said that she'd always been touched.<eos> And then there was that story of the baby and the river.<eos> Took the babe from its pram. And threw it into the river.
There must be no hint of romance between Mary Poppins and Bert.<eos> She wants to know why Mr. Banks has been given a mustache.<eos> Oh, I asked for that.<eos> Yes, they told her that, but she wants to know why.<eos> Because I asked for it.<eos> Right.<eos> Of course.<eos> Uh, the tape measure Mary Poppins uses to record Jane and Michael's height must be a roll tape, not a ruler.<eos> She only wants green vegetables and broth.<eos> I don't know what that is, but she wants it in the room from now on.
It's getting close.<eos> Why did you have to make him so cruel?<eos> He was not a monster!<eos> Who are we talking about? I'm confused.<eos> You all have children, yes?<eos> And do those children make letters for you?<eos> Do they write letters? Do they make you drawings?<eos> And would you tear up those gifts in front of them?<eos> It's a dreadful thing to do. I don't understand.<eos> Why must Father tear up the advertisement his children have made, and throw it in the fireplace?
Skin peeling from our faces.<eos> Sometimes I'd find myself sunk down in that snow, just waking up, because I must have passed out or something, I don't know.<eos> And then it was time for school, and I was too cold or wet to figure out equations and things.<eos> And then it was right back out in the snow again to get home just before dark.<eos> Mother would feed us dinner.<eos> And then it was time to go right back out and do it again for the evening edition.<eos> "You had best be quick there, Walt." "You'd better get those newspapers up<eos> "on that porch and under that storm door. "Poppa's gonna lose his temper again "and show you the buckle end of his belt, boy."<eos> I don't tell you this to make you sad, Mrs. Travers.<eos> I don't. I love my life. I think it's a miracle.
- Oh, yeah, I'm sorry.<eos> - Let me tilt your head back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - I really just need one of these.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think it's really good. The painting.<eos> Oh, no, it's not. I just...<eos> I didn't even finish it.<eos> I'm serious. I think it's really good.
Yeah, because we've gotta raise some money for the rainforest.<eos> Oh, absolutely.<eos> That's a big concern of Dicky and Janey.<eos> And maybe you could pack their lunches in the morning.<eos> I'll pack their lunch, put a note in there, tell them how much I adore...<eos> Their mother?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then, you know... after school we can... you know, take them to the playground and....<eos> How do you take this thing off?<eos> Just break it.
[breathes heavily] - Good..<eos> If I ever see you in such a homo state of weakness again, I will kill you myself.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Do that.<eos> That works for me. - Be a man, Rough!<eos> Fag.<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Why don't you raise the shutter instead of crawling out like a fucking lizard?<eos> - It's broken. It won't open anymore.<eos> I need to get it fixed.
Or smaller.<eos> Depends on the face.<eos> The face? How?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Mum, he's scared.<eos> - Don't be a bitch, Suvi.<eos> A man afraid of heights? My mum isn't.<eos> If she was, she'd now have one arm more.<eos> Mum already tried to fix the sauna stove. The wall caught fire.<eos> We put it out.
These interests can occasionally generate difficulties, but they also generate revenues.<eos> Significant revenues.<eos> What do you want, Mr. Proctor?<eos> I might ask you the same question, Sheriff Hood.<eos> I'm good.<eos> But thank you.<eos> You take care of that.<eos> It could go bad pretty fast.<eos> - Where's my fucking money?<eos> - You'll get it.
Are you not gonna get up?<eos> Why? Go.<eos> You've got room.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> If you gave me the window, I wouldn't have to move.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't drag that thing across me.<eos> It's full.<eos> You just told me it's full.<eos> I don't want it on me.
And their origins.<eos> Todd's my key to success.<eos> I think I've spent more hours with Todd than even my parents.<eos> He's cool and he's smart, and that's why I named him Todd.<eos> No, that makes sense.<eos> Have you figured out your favorite word?<eos> No, I sure haven't.<eos> Is it the "F" word?<eos> It's up there.<eos> Because you say it a lot.
Really?<eos> Let me see it.<eos> Your fingers get a little sticky when you get all boozed up.<eos> Toys are fun to have when you can't play with other kids.<eos> That's true.<eos> What was your favorite toy when you were a kid?<eos> Well, I did love a little toy car once, kind of like this.<eos> It was a shitty little black-and-white police car.<eos> Never left my pocket.<eos> Then I lost it one night, I think.
So anyways, we do about eight to 10 pick-ups a day.<eos> Then we drive around and drop it off, drive some more, get some more, the owners take some off the top, and then Wednesday morning we go back to the Reserve.<eos> Done. Beautiful.<eos> Brain surgery.<eos> Wait, the owners are taking money?<eos> Yeah well, it's the bosses' rule, but hell, they can do whatever the hell they want in here.<eos> A lot of monkey business all I know is going on.<eos> Knowing too much will drive you crazy, anyway.<eos> Just keep it simple, do your job, find a girl, buy a house.<eos> So this is how it goes. We pick the money up, we lock it in the back here with you.
I'm fucking sorry. - It's okay, Christo. - I fucked up.<eos> It's over now.<eos> I fucked up. Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you did, Chris.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Hey, boss, still got a lot of money unaccounted for here.<eos> And don't you know it.<eos> You think your boy's gonna talk?<eos> Yeah. I think he'll come to his senses.<eos> The FBI said today that the man whose job it was to protect the money stole it:
The most valuable book in the world.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Back that shit up.<eos> We can't steal a Gutenberg Bible.<eos> We're not stealing the Gutenberg Bible.<eos> The second book Gutenberg printed was well outside the beliefs of the Church.<eos> The Gospel According to James.<eos> Well, that's a legend.<eos> The church has been trying to bury this gospel since before the time of Constantine.<eos> And, to Friedman, that makes the Gospel According to Jimmy even more priceless.<eos> So we nick your fancy book, hand it on over, and make scads of loot.

Turner, Monet, Vermeer, those guys kept my eyes open.<eos> It was a feeling I had, a completeness when art touched me.<eos> I only started getting into trouble when I wanted to possess it.<eos> And you... what makes you do it?<eos> Money.<eos> Well, at least you're honest.<eos> It's always nice to know... who you can trust.<eos> I'm gonna find this painting.<eos> Not because I want to get you or your brother in trouble.<eos> I just want to hold it.
The way you showed up on this trip last minute with 25 strangers all alone...<eos> That needs guts.<eos> You fight off thugs, leave me behind in races, sing mad songs...<eos> You're a full hindi film hero, dude!<eos> Just stop feeling so bad for yourself and start loving who you are.<eos> You're fine just the way you are.<eos> There is one problem, though.<eos> You don't smile enough.<eos> Do you know how dangerous your smile is?<eos> If I had a heart, I'd have lost it to your smile ages ago.
Briefly.<eos> I'm sure you filled your pockets.<eos> And now my pockets are empty.<eos> You've given me a taste for the finer things.<eos> And if you want me protecting you, you'll need to pay more.<eos> I thought we were friends.<eos> We are.<eos> But I'm a sellsword.<eos> I sell my sword.<eos> I don't loan it out to friends as a favor.
I was a captain and a knight.<eos> Aye, ser, and serving which king?<eos> The one true king of Westeros,<eos> Stannis Baratheon.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> Everyone thought you were dead.<eos> And your son?<eos> He may have swam ashore as you did.<eos> No, the wildfire took him.<eos> I saw it.
They're not men.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Once I own an army of slaves, what will I be?<eos> You think these slaves will have better lives serving men like Kraznys or serving you?<eos> You'll be fair to them.<eos> You won't mutilate them to make a point.<eos> You won't order them to murder babies.<eos> You'll see they're properly fed and sheltered.<eos> A great injustice has been done to them.<eos> Closing your eyes will not undo it.
Very few guards.<eos> They know me.<eos> They let me inside--<eos> We're not gonna sneak an army through a back gate.<eos> I kill the guards.<eos> I take your two best men and lead them through the back streets, which I know well, and open the front gates.<eos> Then comes the army.<eos> Once the walls are breached, the city will fall in hours.<eos> Or perhaps you'll lead Grey Worm and me to the slaughter, cutting the head off our army.<eos> The masters of Yunkai will pay you your fee and you won't have to split it three ways 'cause you've already slaughtered your partners.
Your place is by the queen.<eos> If we are truly her loyal servants, we'll do whatever needs to be done no matter the cost, no matter our pride.<eos> We're west of Castle Black, but the Nightfort's closest to us.<eos> It was the first castle on the Wall.<eos> The Watch abandoned it during the reign of King Jaehaerys I.<eos> Too big.<eos> Impossible to maintain.<eos> Other than Castle Black itself, the Nightfort's the perfect castle for us.<eos> It's got a secret sally port, the Black Gate, as old as the Wall itself.<eos> No one's used it in centuries most likely.
Did you know that?<eos> - And the Targaryens built this castle.<eos> - Aye.<eos> - So they did.<eos> - You can hide the book under your cloak.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> I'll bring you more.<eos> Thank you, my lady.<eos> I'm sure it's a fine book, but it's wasted on me.<eos> Take it.
Is he?<eos> And... who's the lucky girl?<eos> She may not be the grandest ship in the world or the fastest, but she's mine.<eos> I've always wanted a ship.<eos> Now I want a dozen.<eos> - Strange, isn't it?<eos> - What is?<eos> It doesn't matter what we want, once we get it, then we want something else.<eos> Your hair is different.<eos> Is it?

Let's see, for my family's health and happiness, for an end to the war, for a short winter.<eos> Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.<eos> - And you?<eos> - I'm sorry, I just can't.<eos> My cousin Alanna was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.<eos> When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees and Alanna looked like a goddess sent to torture me.<eos> Pig-face, she called me.<eos> Pig-face?<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I think it had something to do with my nose.
They're as strong as they're gonna get.<eos> Them that's dying, why don't you cut their throats and be done with it?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Or leave them if you've not the stomach and I'll sort them myself.<eos> Whose throat you gonna cut, old man?<eos> Wait outside.<eos> It's cold outside and there's nothing to eat.<eos> My wives gave you bread.<eos> There's sawdust in the bread.<eos> You don't like it, you go out there and eat the snow.
She's here to thank you for being a thoroughly respectful fellow who's never once failed to address me as "my lord."<eos> Be back in time for my supper.<eos> Pace yourself, lad.<eos> For years I've heard that Littlefinger is a magician.<eos> Whenever the crown needs money, he rubs his hands together and, poof, mountains of gold.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> He's not a magician.<eos> No.<eos> - He's stealing it?<eos> - Worse, he's borrowing it.

What's wrong with that?<eos> We can't afford to pay it back, that's what's wrong with it.<eos> The crown owes millions to my father.<eos> Seeing as it's his grandson's ass on the throne, I imagine he'll forgive that debt.<eos> Forgive a debt, my father?<eos> For a man of the world, you're strangely naive.<eos> I've never borrowed money before.<eos> I'm not clear on the rules.<eos> Well...<eos> The basic principle is I lend you money, and after an agreed upon period of time, you return it with interest.
Or should I say my money's worth?<eos> Oh, it was a gift, Podrick.<eos> This is more than I give you in a year.<eos> He's a squire.<eos> You don't pay him.<eos> Oh, then it's much more than I give you in a year.<eos> They wouldn't take it, my lord.<eos> Maybe they're trying to curry some favor with the new Master of Coin.<eos> Have you ever known a whore to turn down gold?<eos> They were happy enough to take it when I gave it to them.
I'll come visit you soon.<eos> What do you mean to do with him?<eos> You know what I mean to do with him.<eos> Then why bathe him and dress him in fine clothes?<eos> If it needs to be done, do it.<eos> Don't torture the boy.<eos> Have you ever slaughtered a lamb, my king?<eos> No.<eos> If the lamb sees the knife, she panics.<eos> Her panic seeps into her meat, darkens it, fouls the flavor.
Why radiant?<eos> It's the word that came to mind.<eos> We're going to be sisters soon.<eos> We should be friends.<eos> You're a musical girl, aren't you?<eos> I imagine you have a lovely voice.<eos> A better dancer than a singer, I'm afraid.<eos> Ah, but you know the song "The Rains of Castamere"?<eos> Of course.<eos> They play it so often here at court.
Have they told you what they plan to do with me?<eos> Lord Bolton's traveling tomorrow as well.<eos> He's going to the Twins for Edmure Tully's wedding.<eos> You're to remain here.<eos> With Locke?<eos> I owe you a debt.<eos> When Catelyn Stark released you, we both made a promise to her.<eos> Now it's your promise.<eos> You gave your word.<eos> Keep it and consider the debt paid.
Well...<eos> Not all girls are like you.<eos> Well, girls see more blood than boys.<eos> Or do you like girls who swoon, Jon Snow?<eos> Oh, a spider!<eos> Save me, Jon Snow.<eos> My dress is made of the purest silk from Tralalalaleeday.<eos> I'd like to see you in a silk dress.<eos> Would you?<eos> So I could tear it off you.
He'd never leave me.<eos> Not for long.<eos> I knew he'd come back.<eos> And he did.<eos> He came in through the back of the hut.<eos> Only it wasn't Bruni. Not really.<eos> His skin was pale like a dead man's.<eos> His eyes bluer than clear sky.<eos> He came at me, grabbed me by the neck and squeezed so hard I could feel the life slipping out of me.<eos> I don't know how I got the knife. When I did, I stuck it deep into his heart.
Never doubted it.<eos> Now how about that plate?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We traced the vehicle to a subsidiary company of the Osterberg group.<eos> Reported missing about a week ago.<eos> Naturally.<eos> The question is were they trying to scare off a pesky reporter or did they mean to do her serious harm?<eos> You tell me.<eos> That guy on the boat was looking for something, and what that something is, I have no idea.<eos> I mean, they had to have searched it before they killed Archer.
Come on, answer your damn phone, girl.<eos> This is Rebecca.<eos> Please leave a message.<eos> My birthday.<eos> Oh, Miles, you remembered.<eos> Wow. The money's just rolling in.<eos> Miles, what were you guys doing?<eos> $2 million.<eos> Hmm. Here.<eos> Maybe you put it in here.
And?<eos> He was siphoning money out of Osterberg's accounts.<eos> Almost $10 million.<eos> Whoo! Well, what'd he do with it?<eos> Cashed out, probably hid it somewhere.<eos> No wonder Osterberg wanted him whacked.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> What?<eos> Would you kill someone that had $10 million that belonged to you?<eos> Not till I got it back.
Oh, this is magic.<eos> Opened up like a little baby on pamper day, didn't it?<eos> Okay, it won't be long now.<eos> Just a couple of minutes, the combination will show up right there.<eos> Any minute now.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Put it back together and get outta here.<eos> Who sold you that thing?<eos> It's not the device.<eos> The device is good, I've used it before.
99% of your containers uses four or three numbers.<eos> This thing isn't programed to do more than that.<eos> It can't do five numbers? No.<eos> Wait, it's a five-digit combination. Five? Yes.<eos> Why?<eos> Turn that thing off.<eos> What? Turn it off.<eos> When I hacked his computer, my birthday was part of his password.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> Let's keep it.
You miserable puke.<eos> I can't believe I ever loved you.<eos> Rebecca, you have to look at the bigger picture, sweetie.<eos> You are a thief and a murderer.<eos> And your point is?<eos> Look, I can give you guys $10 million in cash right now.<eos> Shut up, Dennis.<eos> It's at my house.<eos> We already know where the money is.<eos> Well, then take it. You go your way, and we'll go... $10 million? What $10 million?
Her kidnapper is still at large.<eos> I spent five days in a body bag.<eos> The things that he did to me... I thought I was gonna die.<eos> I just...<eos> I just wanna have a normal life.<eos> I just want to get a movie and have some focus.<eos> I understand, Emily.<eos> As your therapist, I believe you need time to process everything you've been through.<eos> You avoid talking about the baby.<eos> About losing it.
Allan, it's Emily.<eos> Emily Moore.<eos> Heh.<eos> Hi. Yeah, I know it's been a while.<eos> No, no, I'm fine.<eos> I'm great.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, no, I was calling about the screenplay.<eos> The comedy.<eos> I know I turned it down, um, at first.
- Go on.<eos> - Go on what?<eos> - Do what you promised.<eos> - What did I promise?<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> Oh, no, not now.<eos> Right, everyone, quiet, please! - Oh, no.<eos> I want to hear this piece of lemon... - ..hiss.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> When I put it on the fire.
Fuck me.<eos> What's going on over here?<eos> - Are you the proprietor of this establishment.<eos> - Yes, this is my club.<eos> - And you making quite mess of it.<eos> It appears that one of your clientele has misplaced my vehicle.<eos> Come on, my friend... Let's have a drink and take it easy.<eos> You are not my friend, I don't drink, and I haven't taken it easy since 1991.<eos> Now, where is my fucking car? Ohh!<eos> I wish I could help you to find it, So I could stick it up to your fucking limey ass!
it is dusty in here!<eos> No? Not a word?<eos> Tickle, tickle, tickle, tickle ...<eos> Jeez, alright, I'm good.<eos> - Very well, thank you.<eos> I'm well, under the circumstances.<eos> All this darkness has affected my kidneys. Mine too, dear lady.<eos> to experience the world in day time that would be my biggest and dearest wish.<eos> I also have a request.<eos> I've worn my corset for 400 years, and I love it.
There!<eos> A ghost with a Keychain!<eos> And another one!<eos> It's not that you're bad, You just have a big imagination..<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Let's see what time I wake up tomorrow.<eos> I'm so tired.<eos> There was so much happening today.<eos> First, we consider each movement of the clock.<eos> Then we rebuild it part by part and clean and polish it.
The child crossed negligently, the parents didn't supervise him, so seven years, maybe six.<eos> No previous offenses, let's say three, early release included.<eos> How much are three years worth, as opposed to nothing?<eos> See you can't do the math?<eos> You do it.<eos> I can tell you you've planned to buy non-prosecution with $O, maybe 100,OOO euros.<eos> Is my math right?<eos> No, Mr. Laurentiu.<eos> Here's the deal.<eos> I do not have that kind of money, and if I did, I would be unwilling to give it to you.
-You can't?<eos> What?<eos> No, the cards do not show any relationship.<eos> -Are you certain?<eos> Dear local council, citizens...<eos> As Confucius said, "Always look backward to gaze into the future".<eos> With those words, I want to show the importance of our beloved Kungshamn getting its own maritime museum.<eos> Beach Rider, there is a ship out there!<eos> -Why is the lighthouse dark?<eos> -My father rode there to light it.
Like a novel.<eos> How gentlemanly of you not to disclose her name.<eos> One day I'll tell you who she is.<eos> Stop. Stop.<eos> - So you're top dog now, are you?<eos> - Don't be silly.<eos> I asked the man on the gate and he said you'd taken over from the boss.<eos> I'm only his private secretary.<eos> - What about the car?<eos> - He lets me use it.
What about you?<eos> What's your dream?<eos> Oh, I don't have any dreams.<eos> I'm alive. The world is at peace.<eos> Yes. It is.<eos> I couldn't quite finish it, there was a piece missing.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> Look.<eos> They're all here.<eos> Where did you find it?
I'm alive. The world is at peace.<eos> Yes. It is.<eos> I couldn't quite finish it, there was a piece missing.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> Look.<eos> They're all here.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> Here.<eos> It's been here all the time.<eos> I sold it.
Yes. It is.<eos> I couldn't quite finish it, there was a piece missing.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> Look.<eos> They're all here.<eos> Where did you find it?<eos> Here.<eos> It's been here all the time.<eos> I sold it.<eos> You never liked it anyway.
Are you taking your driver's test drunk?<eos> Yeah, I'm MC Hammered!<eos> - You're a madman!<eos> - Psychopath, man!<eos> Hey, Scully, Scully.<eos> Have you seen those old townies from the quarry today?<eos> No, I can't say I did.<eos> Why?<eos> They disrespected our frat house!<eos> Man, they disrespected the crap out of it!
Smart girl.<eos> Or is it worse than that?<eos> I don't want to get mixed up in something heavy.<eos> You already are.<eos> How would you know he won't come looking for you?<eos> But he won't, will he?<eos> No. He won't.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Take the money.<eos> I don't want it.
Did I mention the perks?<eos> Power, glory, any woman you want.<eos> Well, none of the super hot ones.<eos> Those are for me. But, you know, any of the older, chubbier ones.<eos> Barbara from accounting.<eos> Oh, she's a big girl.<eos> Yeah, I don't want Barbara from accounting, or...<eos> You haven't even gotten to know her.<eos> She's a sweet lady. Listen, we found another radio, okay?<eos> Jared thinks he can get it working if we can get a part from the one on the plane.
Utterly screwed up your grandfather's life.<eos> Left him without love or friends.<eos> I've never bumped into a genuinely happy rich person.<eos> It would be nice not to have to work.<eos> No, that's a real recipe for disaster.<eos> Look what happened to Uncle Fred.<eos> What happened to Uncle Fred?<eos> Absolutely sod all.<eos> Wasted his life.<eos> You have to use it for things that you really think will make your life the way you want it to be.
Gentlemen, I regard today's proceedings with the utmost gravity.<eos> Nevertheless, let us be clear of one<eos> simple and salient thing.<eos> It is the life of a guilty man!<eos> One of the actors appeared to have actually fallen asleep...<eos> Here's the little prick who walked out halfway through.<eos> You missed the best scene, you little twerp.<eos> Sorry.<eos> What did you think of the set?<eos> I thought it was incredible. Did you?
My darling. What's happened?<eos> You're the best person in the world.<eos> You're top equal with my wife.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Maybe, just maybe, I'm the faller.<eos> Every family has, like, someone who falls, who doesn't make the grade, who stumbles, who life trips up.<eos> Maybe I'm our faller.<eos> No.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna tell you a secret.<eos> And you have to promise to keep it.
- We have a new approach.<eos> - A new approach?<eos> If the knife is placed on the soul, but it's just a hollow space, then there's no shell and you can get rid of the knife.<eos> - What?<eos> - Right on, dude.<eos> - Why no happy endings?<eos> - I love them.<eos> I really do. So you want to do my movie?<eos> With my script?<eos> - We love it.
This is not an error.<eos> This is not a mistake.<eos> What the fuck...<eos> George!<eos> George!<eos> George!<eos> Wake up!<eos> What the fuck are doin up there?<eos> [Indistinct reply]<eos> I came with your telephone, I bring it back to you.
Mr. RadissonHilton.<eos> And I know that time when you were doing that reading in Washington... When your cell phone supposedly broke that night.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Swear on our kids you didn't fuck that lady from the bookstore. Emily.<eos> Swear to me you didn't fuck that Emily girl.<eos> And I'm not jealous because I'm not the type. But I just wanna know. Okay?<eos> Be a man and admit the truth.<eos> I am giving you my whole life, okay?<eos> I got nothing larger to give.<eos> I'm not giving it to anybody else.
You will go back to Nsukka.<eos> I can't just go back to his house, Auntie.<eos> I am not asking you to go back to his house.<eos> I said you will go back to Nsukka.<eos> Do you not have your own flat and your own job?<eos> Odenigbo has done what all men do and inserted his penis in the first hole he could find when you were away.<eos> Does that mean somebody died?<eos> When your uncle first married me, I worried because I thought all those women outside were coming to displace me from my home.<eos> I now know that nothing he would ever do would make my life change.<eos> My life will change only if I want it to change.
Oh, God.<eos> They said I was dead, mah?<eos> Your battalion thought you had died during the operation.<eos> Where's Auntie Kainene?<eos> 'General Ojukwu, who led the Biafran cessation in Nigeria, 'is on his way to seek political asylum in the Ivory Coast.<eos> 'He is said to have with him 3,000 pounds of luggage 'and his Mercedes-Benz car.'<eos> 'I, Major General Philip Effiong, 'officer administering the government of The Republic of Biafra, 'now wish to make the following declaration...'<eos> - Did you find her?<eos> - No. Where's the car?<eos> Did the soldiers take it?

Where the shadows are really the body And we stay awake...<eos> Where the heavens are shallow As the see is now deep<eos> And you love me...<eos> Into that world inverted Where left is always right Where the shadows are really the body<eos> That is like we imagine knowledge to be...<eos> Dark, clear, Moving, utterly free<eos> Drawn from the cold, hard, mouth of the world Drive from the rocky breasts forever Flowing and flown.<eos> Pretend you're floating on a wild river and you're very, very scared.<eos> Elizabeth, this telegram arrived for you.<eos> Open it.
Elizabeth, this telegram arrived for you.<eos> Open it.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> Telegrams are always bad news. - Give it to me.<eos> - Don't.<eos> I'll open it.<eos> Sweetheart, please.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'll open it.
Yes you did say that!<eos> Don't deny it.<eos> He did?<eos> He called you?<eos> Lota...<eos> Darling.<eos> Can you believe Aldous Huxley loved my book?<eos> I loved your book too.<eos> I wrote a poem for you.<eos> Do you want to hear it?
Leena died... and now the whole damn world is dying.<eos> Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and Myka will find a cure, they will.<eos> So what?<eos> It's not going to save Leena.<eos> And Artie?<eos> I stabbed Artie with a dagger!<eos> Why bother if we just keep losing?<eos> Because it's not the win, it's the fight.<eos> Evil it's relentless, It always has been.<eos> You take one evil out, and another one pops out to replace it.
In my line of work, things tend to happen when it gets dark.<eos> Please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ahoy, Carl!<eos> (GASPS)<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Elise, thank you for coming.<eos> I didn't know what else to do, except call you.<eos> Oh, I understand.<eos> You had a big problem and you thought you'd make it my problem, too.
Around the house?<eos> It's not the house, it's Josh.<eos> (CAR ENGINE STARTING)<eos> They're gone.<eos> It's go time.<eos> Okay.<eos> We'll hear everything.<eos> Sing out if you need us.<eos> The code word is "Quesadilla."<eos> Say it with me.
Enzo sort of looked like my brother. - Rock and roll.<eos> - You got it, baby.<eos> You'll hear him. He's coming on-- - I'm so sorry, guys.<eos> The limo's here.<eos> We can meet at a place...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody can replace my brother.<eos> That's--that's not what this is about.<eos> This album is just my way of honoring him.<eos> Well, I look forward to hearing it. Thank you.
Come on.<eos> Enzo, that means you too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's give them some family time.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get your ski on.<eos> Bye!<eos> Can we see the video?<eos> Ah, not a chance, kid.<eos> Well, maybe lila and I can see it.
Let's give them some family time.<eos> Okay?<eos> Get your ski on.<eos> Bye!<eos> Can we see the video?<eos> Ah, not a chance, kid.<eos> Well, maybe lila and I can see it.<eos> I'm 11, you know.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, as soon as I get a copy, you guys can see it.
Then, I'm sure you're well aware that he had 15 times prescribed the amount of Phenobarbital in his system.<eos> - What's your point, Ms. Moore?<eos> - As the investigating officer, I feel like you have ignored certain elements pertaining to my client.<eos> Why didn't you at least investigate the crash further?<eos> - Because I think that he's a drug addict.<eos> - There is nothing in his medical history... to suggest that he had any substance abuse problems.<eos> If you have any requests, why don't you put it in writing?<eos> Wait, please.<eos> A farmer from outside the city reported that some kind of animal attacked his horses.<eos> He was standing on two legs, over two meters tall, covered in hair, and called it a "monster from hell."
Sorry.<eos> We found him.<eos> - She sure loves that thing. - Yeah.<eos> She sure does.<eos> But you know, I just called the delivery company, and they said it was sent from an evidence depository.<eos> As in crime scene evidence?<eos> I don't know. Maybe I heard them wrong.<eos> The connection was bad.<eos> I'm sure that's it.<eos> Yeah, but we still don't know who sent it.
Oh, God.<eos> Please don't be mean right now.<eos> Well, what do you want me to be?<eos> I just left my other life for you.<eos> For you!<eos> - I didn't ask you to.<eos> - No, I know that.<eos> Okay, you're right.<eos> I'm aware of that little crack in my fucking armor... or my plan, or whichever one of those fucking things gets a crack in it.<eos> But still, what I did was I left it for you. Okay?
You've been saying insulting things to me all day.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Taking the shirt off.<eos> I don't know what happens to a dream deferred.<eos> Does it dry up, like a raisin in the sun?<eos> Or does it explode?<eos> I don't want to find out.<eos> You just made the worst mistake of your life.<eos> Hey, hey!<eos> You take the shirt off, it doesn't go back on.
And that's not a good feeling.<eos> Anyway, I should go.<eos> Thank you!<eos> - But before I do...<eos> - Oh, jeez!<eos> Just bear with me.<eos> I want to throw down a challenge for you to go out to dinner before I leave town.<eos> I'll tell you if a window opens up.<eos> Great.<eos> And if it does, don't minimize it.
Do what?<eos> Hit it by function and user. Two-prong.<eos> Taking out the shield generator on the forest moon of Endor and fighting with Admiral Ackbar.<eos> It's not a trap!<eos> Guys, I don't want to kill the momentum or the mojo but needles and categories, they don't use apps.<eos> People use apps.<eos> So I have an idea.<eos> People take pictures, right?<eos> They have their phones out, they see something, take it, but then the photo's just sitting there.<eos> What if they take that photo and instantaneously put it out on the line and share it with friends?
Billion dollar idea.<eos> Even better!<eos> Let him flow.<eos> You can't bring me down, I'm too positive.<eos> Let me share something with you.<eos> I'll explain in a way that's visual.<eos> He's bigger than you. Be careful.<eos> So you're out there, you take a photo.<eos> Pretend. Go ahead.<eos> So you take that photo, put it on the line...
And the same penis.<eos> I may, literally, never see another penis again.<eos> Unless it's a small child's.<eos> Or if you get sexually assaulted.<eos> And Josh's is lovely.<eos> You know, we have an incredible sex life. But that's not the point, you know.<eos> I love Michael Jackson's Off the Wall album.<eos> I wouldn't necessarily want to only listen to that for the rest of my life.<eos> Oh, honey, I've been there.<eos> I mean, you'll listen to it a lot in the beginning.
- Can you take it out?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The One Tree Hill omnibus is about to start.<eos> Lauren's about to tell Jake that baby Connor's not his.<eos> Oh, Christ.<eos> Your husband is so adorable.<eos> Yes. He really is.<eos> So ostentatious.<eos> Have you seen my phone? No.<eos> When did you last have it?
Lovely to see you.<eos> I er... I didn't realise you were here.<eos> You know, it's actually good that I ran into you because I was thinking about some of those community outreach...<eos> Could we take one night off from talking shop?<eos> Am I allowed to say you're looking incredible?<eos> Technically, no.<eos> That would constitute sexual harassment.<eos> You're right.<eos> The rules and regulations on that are very strict these days.<eos> I actually have a copy of the Sexual Discrimination Act 2007 in my hotel room if you'd like to come back and peruse it.
And, um, Stop Wasting Your Life.<eos> - Good idea.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> - My family hate him...<eos> - They hate me.<eos> ...his family get under my skin, and, at a time when we should have felt happy and close,<eos> Explain again what your book's about.<eos> Well, my hero is a young history professor called Ezra who, with the help of a young American aid worker, discovers this man in Borneo who claims to be Muhammad.<eos> So it's a meditation, really, on the veracity and origins of faith.<eos> If he ever gets round to finishing it.
He is not alive, like Odin, Thor or Freyr.<eos> What use is he then?<eos> You speak our language?<eos> How do you speak our language?<eos> I've traveled.<eos> We are told to travel, to take the word of God.<eos> Please, don't kill me.<eos> What is that you have in your hand?<eos> A book.<eos> The gospel of St. John, I wanted to save it.
Does it have one king who rules over the whole country?<eos> There are four kingdoms with four kings.<eos> You landed in the kingdom of Northumbria.<eos> The King of Northumbria is called Aelle.<eos> He is a great king.<eos> A powerful king.<eos> Then why did his men not protect your temple?<eos> Before you came, we had no need to protect our monastery.<eos> We lived in peace.<eos> Everyone respected it as a place of God.
And you are so under his thumb that he has persuaded you to lie for him.<eos> May Thor strike you dead!<eos> What did you say?<eos> My husband did not kill Knut Tjodolf.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> - I did!<eos> I killed him.<eos> I stabbed him in the heart when he tried his best to rape me.<eos> A murder is committed and the only witnesses are a husband and his wife.<eos> Unfortunately, we can't tell who committed the crime, because they both claim credit for it.
I have fears.<eos> Go to the Seer, ask if your fears will come true.<eos> It's sometimes better not to know one's fate.<eos> I take it, from what you said yesterday, that King Horik is prepared to compromise and offer some deal regarding those lands of mine, which he still occupies?<eos> He is prepared to pay you to renounce your illegal claims of his lands.<eos> You disappoint me now, Ragnar Lothbrok.<eos> I thought you'd come here with a serious purpose.<eos> - If you would just name your price.<eos> - The land is priceless.<eos> Which is why King Horik wants to keep it for himself.
And they also hired you to get traction in Congress.<eos> Not in this case.<eos> We want a long-term partnership, Claire.<eos> This is an investment in the future.<eos> We're not attaching strings.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> They'd really love to move quickly on this.<eos> I said I'll think about it.<eos> Madeleine, you have to email me this shit.<eos> I need it in writing.
I'm not talking about the food.<eos> I'm talking about Birch.<eos> You are never going to be Speaker unless you do something about it.<eos> I'm very satisfied where I am.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> For the time being, yeah.<eos> Time being never.<eos> The only way you become Speaker is if Birch loses his district or retires, neither of which is going to happen before you and I have dentures.<eos> I'm not happy where this conversation is going, Frank.<eos> If you want it, and I know you do, there's a way.
- Oh, I can take them. - You sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's on the way to my office.<eos> This watershed act proves that once again the anti-capitalist agenda is alive and well in the Democratic party.<eos> Let me show you what's really going on.<eos> Here are the democrats eating up all of their soft science, "organically homegrown" propaganda that the eco-fanatics are force-feeding them.<eos> And over here, at the tail end of all those jackasses, are middle-class Americans... people who just want to work hard and rely on jobs in the drilling industry.<eos> And what about the hypocrisy, folks?<eos> Does Peter Russo honestly have the gall to lecture us on the purity of our rivers when he has been polluting himself with chemicals for years?<eos> He's not just been eating grass, he's been smoking it.
I don't think that would make any difference.<eos> I thought she owed us, Francis.<eos> She does, but there's limits.<eos> She's secretary of state.<eos> She can't break diplomatic protocol.<eos> Well, can you make some calls?<eos> If she can't, I can't.<eos> Plus I have to focus on the watershed bill.<eos> I'm taking time out of my schedule to help you with that.<eos> - Because you drafted it.
Where's Steve?<eos> He went home sick about an hour ago, sir. - I'll be filling in.<eos> - What's your name again?<eos> - Edward what? - Meechum.<eos> You drive fast, Meechum?<eos> You wanted to talk to me? Come on in, Zoe.<eos> This is Mrs. Tilden, owner of...<eos> She knows who I am.<eos> Mrs. Tilden liked your profile on Catherine Durant. No, I didn't.<eos> I loved it
Key is on the kitchen table, ha?<eos> Just drop them in the flower pot.<eos> According to the list of calls made from her cellphone Nicole went to the Muizenberg beach after leaving the club.<eos> It's a lot of drugdealing that goes on over there.<eos> Hey, the Stan, the dancer mentioned to you, didn't you say he dealt?<eos> Yeah, which area is it?<eos> She might have gone by there to pick him up before going to her party at the botanical gardens.<eos> It's area 2.<eos> - Who made the pretty picture?<eos> - Janet emailed it to me this morning.
I can't lift it.<eos> - I can't breathe, get your Mum.<eos> - Come on Mum, too heavy!<eos> Oh no!<eos> Jack!<eos> Jack, I am here, I am there.<eos> Use Midnight.<eos> Get a rope.<eos> Do it!<eos> I got it.
When you come from a poor country, you don't become an ambassador.<eos> This wine is good!<eos> -Pommard 1979.<eos> -The year I came to France.<eos> -Francis, I believe we will do this project together. -You've chosen wisely.<eos> You won't regret it.<eos> -You'll only need to add one more clause specifying that Mr. Ribeiro will manage the works. -There are others who can do it!<eos> -José, you're the best!<eos> -I want that shopping mall to be built by an artist.<eos> -First, you wash it with a sponge, very hot water, and a little bit of vinegar.
-Was the trip good? -Yes!<eos> -How's the baby?<eos> -Everything is fine.<eos> Everything okay, my little thing?<eos> It will be born here, thank God!<eos> Oh, look! They arrived!<eos> Take care of the pan. I'll be right back...<eos> Come on, come on! They arrived.<eos> Come on, hurry up...<eos> Take off Pauleta's T-shirt. You don't deserve to wear it.
Welcome to the Cyberiad.<eos> You will be upgraded. Welcome to the Cyberiad.<eos> You will be upgraded...<eos> You will be upgraded...<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Doctor.<eos> Doctor, Doctor, Doctor,<eos> Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor, Doctor!<eos> I'm pulling in extra processing power. Three million Cyberbrains are working on one tiny chess problem.<eos> How long do you think it's going to take us to solve it?
- Maybe you've seen him. Can you just... ls there any water?<eos> There's this.<eos> You shouldn't drink and drive.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> - Where do you live?<eos> - Dad burnt our house down.<eos> He said he didn't want anyone breaking in and living there.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Said the house memories were our memories, no-one else's.<eos> - So he set it on fire.
Yes!<eos> Well, then get him stripped, goddamit!<eos> These in his coat, they are customs dockets for cargo transit aboard a ship - the Clara May.<eos> Eight separate items.<eos> Large ones too.<eos> She sails in a day.<eos> There's matter in his lungs.<eos> What is it?<eos> I can't say yet.<eos> I need to remove the tissue, set it in wax and make a cross-section.
He just doesn't know it yet.<eos> Hello, Deborah.<eos> What do you want?<eos> - Is your husband home?<eos> - Arthur's around back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Morning, Reverend Ramsey.<eos> Thought I would've heard back from you by now.<eos> I want you to taste something.<eos> The pipes in my house, they draw the water from the aquifer, but I prefer to drink it straight from here.
You see, that fear, worry and anger are essential to the human beings as long as we can control them and use them to our advantage.<eos> My mentor always told me,<eos> "Stop carrying the horse on your shoulders.<eos> Put him between your legs, and ride him!"<eos> What are you...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It's a metaphor.<eos> I had a monster up my ass!<eos> This is the furthest thing from a metaphor!<eos> Listen! if you kill it, it would be just like giving yourself a lobotomy.
Listen! if you kill it, it would be just like giving yourself a lobotomy.<eos> You would become a zombie.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> This creature is a physical manifestation of your dark side.<eos> - What?<eos> - You gotta accept this.<eos> Accept it.<eos> Take it to yourself.<eos> Bond with it.<eos> That's your only way to control it.
From now on, you gotta learn to breathe. Relax.<eos> Now if you feel an episode coming on, try some yoga or green tea.<eos> But nothing mind altering.<eos> No drugs. No alcohol.<eos> And absolutely no dairy.<eos> And you can call me anytime.<eos> I'm there for you.<eos> Breathe, breathe.<eos> This thing is a part of you.<eos> If you kill it, it would be like giving yourself a lobotomy.
Milo!<eos> Milo, stop it!<eos> Dad!<eos> Oh, sun, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm-I'm sorry I wasn't there for you.<eos> - Milo, stop it!<eos> - I made a mistake. No, Dad.<eos> Dad, Dad, Dad, it's okay.<eos> I should've been there to help you, and I wasn't there. No, no, no, no.<eos> I know you think your life's falling apart, but it isn't. No, no, Dad.
After this, I'd understand if some of you wish to leave.<eos> Fugu soup!<eos> Fugu sashimi!<eos> And grilled Fugu!<eos> You may choose the order in which you wish to eat.<eos> You're about to taste the most exquisite dishes ever created.<eos> I hope you survive.<eos> Well, let's go.<eos> Excellent.<eos> Have you tried it before?
This was my last time to see him?<eos> Certainly not.<eos> After he could finally meet you he's will to see you again is stronger than ever.<eos> This will is stronger than everything, so he will survive.<eos> I believe every word you say.<eos> Is it you, Sawano?<eos> It's Kazu's speaking.<eos> I found Koichi's unpublished sketches.<eos> Yes.<eos> No, I take it over.
Oh, don't be silly. Wait.<eos> Yes, that is exactly what we're telling you.<eos> Do you know how much we lose every year to piracy?<eos> - No.<eos> - No, me neither.<eos> It could be 10 billion.<eos> Could be 100 billion.<eos> - Let's just assume it's 10 billion. - Okay.<eos> I want the 10 billion!<eos> We own intellectual property, and I want the fucking pajama people to stop stealing it.
Give it!<eos> Nobody wants your picture, okay?<eos> I know, okay?<eos> Tell christian I know what the fuck he's doing. Tell that piece of shit I know!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> This can't be my phone.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I was just looking for my phone.<eos> Did you find it?
Tell christian I know what the fuck he's doing. Tell that piece of shit I know!<eos> What the fuck?<eos> This can't be my phone.<eos> Fuck.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I was just looking for my phone.<eos> Did you find it?<eos> Christian, why is my phone in your drawer?<eos> - Yeah, christian-<eos> - Did you find it?
And it all began exactly in a small village called Kachtebrul.<eos> This is me. Feruz.<eos> And that's Muzafar.<eos> We're half-brothers. Muzafar is the son our dad had with his cousin.<eos> The lady with the moustache.<eos> Every morning with our women, we do the famous traditional dance of Taboulistan, the Tawa!<eos> The dance of joy!<eos> Our land is called Taboulistan because our greatest pride is to have invented 1,000 years ago the original recipe for tabbouleh!<eos> A skillful blend of grain, parsley and tomatoes.<eos> In spite of what people think, the Lebanese didn't invent it.
One I went through many years ago.<eos> You feel nauseous because your blood pressure has dropped.<eos> Your heart rate is about one beat per minute now.<eos> But you won't die because your healing process has got spectacularly fast.<eos> - I'm thirsty.<eos> - Yes, but you don't want water.<eos> All you've been able to think about since you awoke is one word but you don't know why.<eos> If I told you there was some underneath this floor, you'd dig through the concrete with your fingers.<eos> Accept it and I can help you.<eos> But you have to say it.
Elsa?<eos> Please, no.<eos> You sacrificed yourself for me?<eos> I love you.<eos> "An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart."<eos> "Love will thaw."<eos> Love.<eos> Of course.<eos> Love!<eos> I knew you could do it.
Jamie printed me out an article from Yahoo!<eos> Health.<eos> It was all about enabling, and I realized at that point I cannot continue to support your emotional handicap.<eos> - I understand.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Let me finish, okay?<eos> Sometimes, I get the feeling I've done all I could for you, kid.<eos> I mean, I let you share my crash pad with me for years.<eos> I shared all my contacts in the biz with you.<eos> Listen, if I could break you off a piece of this voice and give it to you, I would.
Do you like it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't really like it.<eos> What?<eos> Ping-pong it a little bit.<eos> Like I say, "Sister," you say...<eos> I'm not saying it.<eos> I won't push my luck.<eos> But you'll do the interview questions?<eos> Look, I'm going to do it. Okay?
I don't know.<eos> I don't really like it.<eos> What?<eos> Ping-pong it a little bit.<eos> Like I say, "Sister," you say...<eos> I'm not saying it.<eos> I won't push my luck.<eos> But you'll do the interview questions?<eos> Look, I'm going to do it. Okay?<eos> I'm doing it.
But I may have pushed him too far.<eos> Which is worrisome.<eos> Friends make the worst enemies.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> What'd you hear?<eos> A lot of fucks.<eos> Well, that pretty much says it.<eos> Let's think this through...<eos> No, we've got the DNC leadership meeting. What?<eos> I'd say you could skip it, but Birch just dumped it on us.
It's neither my place nor my area of expertise.<eos> But know this,<eos> Zoe Barnes, Twitter, blogs, enriched media, they're all surface.<eos> They're fads.<eos> They aren't the foundation this paper was built on, and they aren't what will keep it alive.<eos> We have a core readership that thirsts for hard news.<eos> Those are the people I work 80 hours a week for.<eos> And I won't be distracted by what's fashionable.<eos> That's your resignation letter.<eos> Hand it to the lawyers on the way out.
Congress has to take this seriously.<eos> We're here for the teachers.<eos> We're here...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're not asking for the world.<eos> And Congress needs to step up and get this done.<eos> Excuse me, just a moment.<eos> Well, that dress looks familiar.<eos> It's the one I wore to the symphony.
Excuse me...<eos> Frank...<eos> What you...<eos> Don't take the food.<eos> We'll feed you later.<eos> Don't take this food.<eos> Marty, you know that old saying,<eos> "The most dangerous spot in the world is "to come between a Teamster and free food."<eos> Don't take the food, we're feeding you later.<eos> I'll take it.

I met a guy on the train. I keep thinking about him.<eos> I'm madly in love.<eos> Fantastic!<eos> I was shaking all over, crying, mumbling.<eos> Kept staring at his eyes.<eos> - Oh, those eyes!<eos> - He hit on you?<eos> He gave me a kleenex.<eos> I was sniffling like crazy.<eos> - I kept it!
They're splitting up.<eos> - Surprise. - Yeah.<eos> She can call me. I won't charge her.<eos> Really?<eos> So who cheated?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Who gets custody?<eos> I assume her.<eos> Who gets the house?<eos> They're selling it.
Yes.<eos> You don't have a problem with this?<eos> Cutting out Justin? Yeah.<eos> Not really.<eos> He's not that cute anyway, and I think he fucked my friend, which is kind of gross, right?<eos> I'm learning that it depends.<eos> Did you just...?<eos> So I was at lunch today with a client.<eos> They are divorcing, of course, and he needs a place in the city, so I thought, "The loft."<eos> Can he see it?
All right, but... God, here's the reason why I want to go with the khaki.<eos> Mm-hmm. Because parchment, it's not really gray.<eos> It's more of a stony white, and khaki's khaki.<eos> And even though my want is gray, I'm gonna be upset if there's stains all over the parchment because it's too light.<eos> Is that all I'm supposed to do, is just clean all day long? To keep things light and airy and beachy and neutral?<eos> I can't do it because no one will leave it alone.<eos> I can't choose what I want.<eos> It's the illusion of choice.<eos> Oh, but I know how you feel about gray.<eos> You love it.

34, 59, 20. 106, 36, 52.<eos> 34, 59, 20. 106, 36, 52.<eos> 34, 59, 20. 106, 36, 52.<eos> 34, 59, 20. 106, 36, 52.<eos> Walt.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What happened?<eos> You moved the money, didn't you?<eos> You buried it somewhere.
I can't remember the last time I was happy.<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I know you talked with Hank.<eos> I know you made a deal.<eos> Skyler, I'll make this easy.<eos> I'll give myself up.<eos> If you promise me one thing.<eos> You keep the money.<eos> Never speak of it.<eos> Never give it up.

Share with us.<eos> Why were you tossing millions of dollars all over Albuquerque?<eos> I promise you we can hold out just as long as you can.<eos> That's a fact.<eos> I got a bladder the size of a hot water bottle.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All that cash?<eos> - I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.
Yeah.<eos> All that cash?<eos> - I wouldn't be able to stop talking about it.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> But I don't think I'd be tossing it out my car window.<eos> My take-home definitely doesn't allow for that whole Robin Hood thing.<eos> But apparently Jesse here is just raking it in.<eos> - Yes, indeed.<eos> - And I'm sure he's got a perfectly reasonable explanation for where he got it.<eos> He found it.
Mr. White told me it was, like, the biggest train heist ever, like, potential money-wise.<eos> So that's how that happened.<eos> Can I get you anything else?<eos> Nope.<eos> Thanks, darlin'.<eos> I'm ready for the check.<eos> You feeling good about cooking?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'll be able to run your own lab?<eos> Do it up right?
I'm gonna get a bag for this cash.<eos> Don't even think about lighting up again.<eos> Francesca, we got any bags?<eos> For money.<eos> Money-sized bags.<eos> Huell's gonna drop you at the pickup spot then he's gonna get the hell out of there.<eos> You got that?<eos> Guy won't pick up the kid if he's got company.<eos> You got a phone?<eos> Cops took it.
An eight-year-old boy.<eos> Just because, you know-- just as a move!<eos> Walt's a bastard.<eos> Secret's out.<eos> We'll talk about it.<eos> But I need you to put out the lighter, okay?<eos> Look, Jesse...<eos> Jesse, I don't want to kill you.<eos> And you don't wanna be killed.<eos> So put it out.
Is the tea okay?<eos> I made it just like you asked.<eos> Mm-hmm. You sure?<eos> If it's too weak or something, I can go put another bag in it.<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Look, about the product...<eos> I'm really sorry about the color.<eos> For a minute or two, it just got a few degrees too hot in the mixing kettle, I think.<eos> I might've just cooked the color right out of it.<eos> You burned it, like a cake.
Why would he wanna kill me?<eos> - I ain't do nothin' to him.<eos> - Who knows with this guy?<eos> From what he said to Goodman, it may have something to do with him trying to tie up loose ends regarding his poisoning some kid named Brock.<eos> Or maybe it's 'cause you know where his money is.<eos> I don't know where his money is.<eos> That ain't what we heard.<eos> Well, you ain't listening to the people in the know.<eos> Me and Kuby rented a van for the dude, loaded his cash up in a self-storage unit, handed over the keys to him at Goodman's.<eos> And who knows where he took it from there?
The one on Candelaria and Monroe.<eos> - Lariat on Candelaria?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Kuby rented the van.<eos> Mr. White dropped it off.<eos> He had us wash it good before Kuby took it back.<eos> Wash the rental?<eos> Why?<eos> It was filthy, man, like he had went off road with it.<eos> After we had hosed it down, he grabbed a shovel out the back, handed over the key, and that was it.
Aw, nice orange flames. No.<eos> No, no, no, no, no!<eos> Jesse...<eos> Jesse, please.<eos> I'm dying.<eos> My cancer is back.<eos> You're not hurting anyone but my family. Okay?<eos> Look, I... I can't spend this money.<eos> It's not for me.<eos> I won't be around long enough to use it.
Hands up!<eos> Walk towards me slowly!<eos> Stop.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Lace your fingers behind your head.<eos> Walk backwards to me.<eos> Stop.<eos> Get on your knees.<eos> How'd you like my barrel photo, huh?<eos> Took it in the backyard by the barbecue grill.
Would you look at that?<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> Goddamn.<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Yeah, boss.<eos> Hell yeah.<eos> Let me get on this side.<eos> Out of there, man.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pull a barrel off the truck and load it in the Chrysler.
Go.<eos> Go.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> Jesus.<eos> What's with all the greed here?<eos> It's unattractive.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm leaving you a barrel.<eos> Boys are gonna load it for you.
He needs to know, and he needs to know now.<eos> No.<eos> Look, I gave you what you wanted.<eos> Come on.<eos> Man, please.<eos> Hey, please.<eos> I told you where to find the tape, okay?<eos> Hey, just-- just-- just go.<eos> Just-- just go there.<eos> Just go to his house and get it.
Look, I gave you what you wanted.<eos> Come on.<eos> Man, please.<eos> Hey, please.<eos> I told you where to find the tape, okay?<eos> Hey, just-- just-- just go.<eos> Just-- just go there.<eos> Just go to his house and get it.<eos> We're on it.<eos> Get it!
I'll- - I'll give you another $10,000.<eos> Please.<eos> $10,000.<eos> Cards?<eos> All right, well... The game will be Seven Card.<eos> I'll deal, since you are... encumbered.<eos> One of these days when you come up here... I'll be dead.<eos> My money over there.<eos> What happens to it then?<eos> What if I ask you to give it to my family?
We don't want to lose any under the furniture.<eos> All right.<eos> That is $9,720,000.<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> And why is it here?<eos> I earned it, and you're going to give it to my children.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Walt, I don't think we... On my son's 18th birthday, which is ten months and two days from today, you will give him this money in the form of an irrevocable trust.<eos> You will tell him that it is his to do with as he sees fit, but with the hope that he uses it for his college education.
Tell them I was here.<eos> That I forced my way in.<eos> Tell them...<eos> Tell them I wanted bacon and eggs on my birthday, and that I gave you that ticket.<eos> Those numbers are GPS coordinates.<eos> For what?<eos> A burial site.<eos> That's where they'll find Hank and Steve Gomez.<eos> That's where I buried our money.<eos> The men who stole it from us, the men who still have it, they murdered Hank and Steve and put them in that hole.
Granddad never said.<eos> How did the French react to them?<eos> There weren't many blacks in France.<eos> Who knows? And who cares?<eos> Just forget about it?<eos> Come here.<eos> Let's have a break.<eos> You need it.<eos> This can't go on, Christian.<eos> I like this place, too. And defend it? my way.
And so when he struck again he made sure that he did it right.<eos> Two professional women in their early 30s, killed in their own homes by strangulation.<eos> I mean, look, they could be sisters.<eos> The strangulation marks are different.<eos> Yes, the marks might be different but both of them have extensive petechial haemorrhages which indicates that he strangled them, released and then strangled again, over and over.<eos> So now you're adding torture into the mix?<eos> Well, it might be sadism or it might just be that his hand lacks strength.<eos> I mean, you try it.<eos> Go on, grab my wrist.<eos> See how long you can grip it.
What do you want, Dror?<eos> I want to see you girls.<eos> But I don't want to see you.<eos> Anat, I didn't do anything.<eos> I can't deal with this right now.<eos> At least let me see Tali.<eos> Today is her birthday.<eos> It's too soon, Dror.<eos> I bought her the bicycle she wanted.<eos> Tie it to the fence tonight. She'll see it in the morning.
Did you send him to the traffic department too?<eos> You're in no position to be joking around. Sit.<eos> What now?<eos> Yes, Tsvika.<eos> We've been kind of busy here.<eos> Kind of.<eos> You really screwed me over with your blooper video.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> Who's a son of a bitch?<eos> The bastard who promised to take it off.
Respectfully, sir, you're allowing fear to cloud yours.<eos> Not an easy thing, to say no to the most powerful man in the free world.<eos> But sometimes the only way to gain your superior's respect is to defy him.<eos> What do we have on the schedule, Linda?<eos> Your meeting with the Fed Oversight Committee.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> Do you have my briefing?<eos> Right here.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's look it over.
We'll talk before.<eos> Peter Russo.<eos> Pennsylvania's first district.<eos> He's gonna run for Governor, fill Matthews' seat.<eos> It's an exclusive profile.<eos> With someone no one's ever heard of.<eos> What's the angle?<eos> Alcohol, drugs.<eos> He's a kid from the streets.<eos> I want the profile to come out as soon as he announces, and I'd like it to be kind.
I don't have time for other lovers.<eos> Shit.<eos> It's turned.<eos> Give me that.<eos> You could've just stepped on it.<eos> I have asked the super to get an exterminator in here, and he won't do it.<eos> So any time I see a cockroach, or a spider, or whatever, I try and trap it, and then I leave it by his door.<eos> You really ought to get your parents to let you borrow some money. Then you wouldn't have to live in the third world.<eos> I would never take money from them.<eos> Because they don't have it, or because you don't want it?

I first want to thank SanCorp Industries for providing the funds to make the library possible.<eos> When I matriculated here as a young cadet, Jimmy Carter had just been elected President.<eos> After I graduated, I wished that I could have had another four years, just like Jimmy.<eos> Well, neither of us got our wish, but I left this campus with fond memories.<eos> The first time I ever...<eos> I got your damn email.<eos> How long has that light been like that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A month, maybe.<eos> And nobody's come to fix it?
Too dark to look at pictures.<eos> No, no, it's on my phone, you don't need any light.<eos> Get it away from me.<eos> I hate those things.<eos> Brain cancer.<eos> It wasn't just up the stairs, it was up three flights of stairs, in the science building.<eos> And Gluckenheimer, what he did...<eos> "Well, you look lovely today, Mrs. Governor."<eos> And the thing took a dump.<eos> Right. And they couldn't get it back...
Weren't you?<eos> Purely being polite.<eos> Good night, Remy.<eos> The bridal suite's on the top floor, at the end of the hallway, if you change your mind.<eos> Good night, Claire.<eos> Hey, Kenny, I think you got a little too big for this.<eos> I think the hole got a lot smaller.<eos> Don't let a little girth stop you.<eos> Look, look, look.<eos> You found it.
That's the new STI, isn't it?<eos> - That's a hard gun to get.<eos> - Who the fuck is this guy?<eos> - You sit your ass down.<eos> - All right, hear me out, sheriff.<eos> - They got you outgunned. - Damn straight we do.<eos> While on the other hand, if he shoots, one of you boys is dead or shitting in a bag the rest of his life.<eos> For what? The 200 bucks Sugar has in the register at 4 p.m. on a Tuesday? Come on.<eos> So, Sheriff, why don't you let them take the cash?<eos> Just let them take it.
All of us.<eos> You bastard.<eos> You fuck with my brother, I'll fuck with you.<eos> You wanna look at that picture?<eos> Come on now, I know you do.<eos> It's here somewhere.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Here.<eos> Come on, have a look.<eos> Come on, Kenny, grab it.
Kenny, no.<eos> I can't.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You keep him on the phone.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm on the work detail at Logan Park.<eos> There's an old logging road at the north end.<eos> It's not far from the highway.<eos> You leave a car there, I'll find it.
Uh, campus security, Your Honor.<eos> I mean, can rent-a-cops really be counted as law enforcement officers?<eos> It's been, what, a couple of months?<eos> Almost a year, your honor.<eos> Turn a new leaf or just dumb luck?<eos> No, walking the straight and narrow, Your Honor.<eos> Thanks to the wise counsel and guidance previously provided by this court.<eos> Are you mocking me, Philip?<eos> No, Your Honor, absolutely not.<eos> You know, I have nothing but respect for this court and for the rule of law that it represents.
Sweet.<eos> Pants.<eos> Now.<eos> Jesus. Hey, you going to school today?<eos> Gotta skip my first three periods, so I can start clocking community service hours.<eos> And the last 50 bucks to the property tax, yo.<eos> This should bring us right around where we need to be.<eos> I didn't put in the money from that last - toxic waste gig I had yet.<eos> - Okay, that's cool.<eos> Hand it over, and I'll drop it off before I go to community service, pay the tax man.

All right.<eos> Debs, Carl, let's go.<eos> School time.<eos> Gotta bring daddy his breakfast first.<eos> Uh, but the property tax, that's already two weeks late.<eos> We're always two weeks late.<eos> I'll have the money back right after the party.<eos> It wasn't yours to spend.<eos> Yeah, it was.<eos> I earned it.
Cool.<eos> Yeah, gotta do what I can with my sister stealing a bunch of our property tax money.<eos> Well, that was cunty of her.<eos> You know, you should be in charge of your family's money, not Fiona.<eos> Mr. Gallagher, just left Mr. Healey's office.<eos> Rumors about you two true?<eos> Said you were supposed to ask me for a recommendation.<eos> Sure, in his mind, I was supposed to do that.<eos> A letter of recommendation from a science teacher looks good on your college applications.<eos> Bet it does.
Probably make enough money to roll it into another one.<eos> Take out a small loan, really get things going.<eos> What's wrong, Debs?<eos> Got home late.<eos> Baby-sitting.<eos> So the ghetto girl thinks she can live the American dream, huh?<eos> Maybe it's my time, Lip.<eos> None of your business, Mandy.<eos> Don't you see, it doesn't work like that, sis.<eos> When you're poor, only way to make money is to steal it or scam it, like Don King or Joe Kennedy.
No, I'm sorry, that's-- that's news to me.<eos> You see, Fiona, if we're gonna be every man for himself, this family is going under fast.<eos> Here, just take the money, okay?<eos> Pay the property tax.<eos> I'll get the rest tomorrow somehow. No, I don't need it.<eos> What?<eos> I took care of the situation myself.<eos> How? Told a bunch of North Side kids that Wilco was playing at your party.<eos> It's like I said.<eos> The only way to make money when you're poor is to steal it or scam it.
Bless you.<eos> Bless you. Let me-<eos> - Here. - Here.<eos> Here you go.<eos> - That'll do it. Look at that.<eos> Wait, don't you need the address?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's still sleeping.<eos> She did not just show up here because her car broke down.<eos> - What, you think she broke it on purpose?
Totally casual.<eos> I've been working here 25 years.<eos> No one's ever thrown a party.<eos> Well, it's good to get to know people away from the salt mine, you know?<eos> I don't know, but I'm glad you're gonna show us.<eos> Want me to bring something?<eos> - We're all set.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> Something from the deli? Bobby'd probably give us a discount.<eos> Or I could throw away some meat and pick it up from the dumpster later.
Cheers.<eos> - Oh, I'd say twice the population here before the fishing was stopped.<eos> And, uh, yeah, they'll be all back pretty quick.<eos> Right up this way.<eos> - Where are we going, exactly?<eos> - All right, I'm calling it.<eos> - No, no, no! Stay, stay!<eos> Let's talk cricket!<eos> I love the game.<eos> I love it.
Congratulations.<eos> That's great.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> - Is there a plan B you haven't told us about?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> - What'll we tell the oil company?<eos> - Okay, all we need now is the doctor's certificate.<eos> - Uh, the certificate?<eos> Oh, we sent you that weeks ago. You should have that.<eos> - Well, we don't have it.
All is safe.<eos> I saw you.<eos> You were in my dreams.<eos> You saved me.<eos> I've only repayed the debt.<eos> There is no debt.<eos> My debt is to you.<eos> The poison was used by my ancestors.<eos> It is said to come visions of the other world.<eos> The warriors of my people once used it to challenge the power of the old gods in battle.
This monk has a terrible aim.<eos> Do not let her run.<eos> You want to play, you want to play?<eos> Good, I like to play!<eos> Wait.<eos> You will suffer before you meet your Christ.<eos> All this for a book?<eos> How is it, it has so much power over men?<eos> It makes madman by the appear of it!<eos> Look at it! Look at it!
No, I'm not doing that.<eos> There's a lot more, little missy, to being an artist than just altering your consciousness on a daily basis.<eos> Which is why I'm writing.<eos> How many pages you got?<eos> I'm closing in on three hundy.<eos> I hate you.<eos> If I'm gonna do this thing, get me the guy who wrote the fucking book.<eos> - Do what?<eos> - God hates us all.<eos> I fucking loved it, man.

I'd know that bent fucking chode anywhere.<eos> - Is that what I think it is?<eos> - Sure is.<eos> Would you mind taking a look?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'd be honored.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm studying your face.<eos> For the truth.<eos> You hate it.
Oh, she is a fucking fruitcake.<eos> I know.<eos> She slapped me.<eos> Oh, you think that's bad?<eos> She had me in a fucking cock cage.<eos> What is a cock cage?<eos> It traps your penis in its flaccid sta--<eos> Ladies, enough of your jibber-jabber.<eos> You haven't said anything about the script.<eos> Have you even read it?
It's-- it's bollocks.<eos> Um, I agree.<eos> Hank, I'm sorry.<eos> It needs work.<eos> Yeah, we're really gonna have to roll up our sleeves on this one.<eos> What the fuck are you guys talking about?<eos> It's a rock opera with the tone of my book.<eos> That's what you wanted.<eos> I don't even like the fucking book.<eos> You said you loved it.

I'm sorry but everyone's so excited.<eos> News has spread that there are life forms and that Captain Apollo has attached the tow lines without interference from them.<eos> I see.<eos> Put me on unicorn, please.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> On the line, Commander.<eos> People of the fleet, this is Commander Adama.<eos> 'Rumours are spreading faster than fact 'about the discovery of a manned vehicle 'soon to be brought aboard the Galactica.<eos> 'I must ask you all to be patient and cautious in your optimism.<eos> 'The incoming vessel will have to be placed in strict quarantine, 'carefully, before we can allow anyone near it, 'for fear of jeopardising not only our own lives, 'but the lives of whoever is aboard that spaceship.'
I was 161 miles from Astrogarth, I was using the 16th map and I was running.<eos> More like A Run Through H.<eos> I was encouraged by the sight of a bird.<eos> If it could rest, so perhaps could I.<eos> I slowed up, apprehensively.<eos> This is a map made by an exiled pianist as a directive to the members of his band.<eos> He could not foresee that his musical and topographical instruction should be used backwards.<eos> As a cartographer, he was not appreciated in his own country.<eos> I had sent away for a plan of Anascaul, and had received this map in return.<eos> It was accompanied with a note saying Anascaul didn't exist, but would this do?
Much later, Tulse Luper made some small changes and signed it.<eos> Originally the two drawings were very alike, which at the time surprised me because, whilst my brother's choice was admired, mine was not.<eos> It seems my brother, even at that age, he must have been eight, was making a decision that would be relevant.<eos> My imitative choice had to be corrected.<eos> This too had belonged to my brother.<eos> He became an archaeologist.<eos> I made the alterations this time.<eos> Tulse Luper raised his eyebrows, but didn't interfere.<eos> I followed the route with some difficulty.<eos> It needed some interpretation and I left the territory it represented without regret.
Because there's a conflict in every human heart between the rational and the irrational, between good and evil.<eos> And good does not always triumph.<eos> Sometimes the dark side overcomes what Lincoln called, "The better angels of our nature."<eos> Every man has got a breaking point.<eos> You and I have them.<eos> Walt Kurtz has reached his, and very obviously he has gone insane.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Very much so, sir.<eos> Obviously insane.<eos> Your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a Navy patrol boat, pick up Colonel Kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba, follow it, learn what you can along the way.
Isn't it a bit late to realize it now?<eos> You're lucky that you're only slightly injured!<eos> Lucky?<eos> Fortunately, you didn't show the techniques of our clan<eos> He doesn't know your real identity!<eos> That's why he wounded you only slightly!<eos> Otherwise we'll both be dead<eos> I think you know the techniques of our clan well enough!<eos> I want to teach you another technique!<eos> It will give you a 50-50 chance against Yen!
I thought the professors knew what they are doing.<eos> I was not the one to contradict them.<eos> - What surprises me is that all the subjects react without anger, without rage... without vindictiveness, without at least hoping for a reward.<eos> You aren't suggesting that Daslow did all that for those 6 dollars?<eos> If the advertisement wasn't published by a university... but by an individual that would promise you several hundred dollars as a reward... would you have still applied those 405V to Mr. Rivoli?<eos> No.<eos> What if the reward would be of 1 0.000 dollars?<eos> I don't think you understood, sir.<eos> Money has got nothing to do with this.<eos> I will obey an authority as long as I respect it.
Navigator, maintain course.<eos> Helmsman, steady as she goes.<eos> No vessel could generate a power field of this magnitude.<eos> Instruments fluctuating, Captain.<eos> Patterns unrecognisable.<eos> Transmit image to Starfleet.<eos> Attempt communication.<eos> Unable to make contact with Starfleet.<eos> Any attempt to transmit out of the cloud is being reflected back.<eos> We're closing on it rapidly, Captain.
- Probe?<eos> Ilia?<eos> - Exactly.<eos> It is a programmed mechanism.<eos> Its body duplicates our Navigator in precise detail.<eos> Suppose that beneath its programming<eos> Ilia's memory patterns are duplicated with equal precision.<eos> - They had a pattern to follow.<eos> - Indeed.<eos> They may have followed it too precisely.
Do you mind locking up after me?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Jesus, that's it. That is it!<eos> - What?<eos> - I've seen this.<eos> I mean, I've seen part of this down there.<eos> You've seen what?<eos> She's wearing a dragon pendant, but when you drew these lines right here I thought that was part of her dress.<eos> I've seen this chain. I've seen this chain down there.<eos> I was trying to get it when the sharks came.
I settle for being pallid and provincial out of my own eternal timidity, the old story of bluster and do bugger all.<eos> I didn't even dare to have children, didn't dare to bring children into a house, a marriage, as cold as mine.<eos> I tell everyone "Margaret's the puritan, I'm the pagan."<eos> Some pagan! Such wild returns I make to the womb of civilisation.<eos> Three weeks a year in the Mediterranean, bed booked in advance, meals paid for.<eos> Cautious jaunts in hired cars, suitcase crammed with Kaopectate.<eos> What a fantastic surrender to the primitive.<eos> "Primitive." I use the word endlessly.<eos> "Ah, the primitive world," I say.<eos> "What instinctual truths were lost with it."
(woman) One funeral is just like another.<eos> However, this one is special.<eos> Not a man in sight.<eos> Only women.<eos> Nothing but women.<eos> Yes, I think Bertrand would have enjoyed the sight of his own funeral.<eos> This is the moment of truth.<eos> From there he's in a good position to take a last look at what he liked best in us.<eos> I remember something Bertrand used to say.<eos> (Bertrand) Women's legs are compasses which circle the globe, giving it its balance and harmony.
Here is a tall stem.<eos> A pretty blossom.<eos> Slender legs are beautiful, but I'm not against thick ankles.<eos> I might even say they attract me because there's the promise of greater harmony at the top of the leg.<eos> The mysteries of the mail are unfathomable.<eos> Unfathomable.<eos> Legs...<eos> The legs of women are compasses...<eos> Compasses...<eos> The legs of women are compasses which circle the globe, giving it its balance and harmony.
Throw down your weapons and step out on the runway with your hands on your heads.<eos> Out!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Eleven days ago, I declared the Olympic Games of 1972 to be opened.<eos> Yesterday, the abominable attack on Connollystrasse shattered the serenity and saddened the world.<eos> Who bears the responsibility for this crime?<eos> First of all, the terrorist organization that thinks hatred and murder can be methods of a political struggle.<eos> But in addition, there are countries that do not stop these men from perpetrating such acts.<eos> The Olympic idea lives on.<eos> Our commitment to it is more powerful than ever.
Do you know your daughter's latest whim?<eos> She decided to take this to the restaurant.<eos> Tell her it's impossible.<eos> Sylvie, you don't want to take this.<eos> It's stained. It's really disgusting.<eos> Mum will get you a real ladies' handbag.<eos> Go and get her a handbag.<eos> That's not a toy. I need it for my work.<eos> - Will this do?<eos> - She'll love it.
How's Red?<eos> How's his band doing?<eos> Haven't heard it on the radio lately.<eos> Red doesn't have a band anymore.<eos> When our son died, he stopped caring about anything.<eos> I'm going to be playing piano at a roadhouse.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> While the Great Depression was a time of constant trial and struggle on Walton's Mountain, those were, in some ways, easier, more simple years.<eos> For we knew what the challenge was and what we had to do to meet it.
So I took her up there.<eos> Why did you bring her back here?<eos> Mama, she's lonely.<eos> And I know she's old and she's set in her ways, but she doesn't do anything to bother anybody on purpose.<eos> I know that.<eos> Well, that's it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Esther, your soup was delicious.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It was the butter beans that gave it the good flavor.
But what if the lad were to be snatched from Moriarty's claws and set free?<eos> 'By Us!<eos> And in such a way that Moriarty still believes him prisoner.<eos> If that can be acheived then the manicles fall from my wrists and I am free to turn my attention to the theft of the gold.<eos> Though easier said that done, I'd say.<eos> Yes, Watson.<eos> I believe that is just what you have said.<eos> Oh, thank you.<eos> The chap's still down there.<eos> It's a damp night, too. He'll have a nice touch of the rheumatism in the morning. I hope he enjoys it.
What did they look like?<eos> All these rows of fishes down the insides of both arms with curlicues and waves, like breakers above both wrists.<eos> - Did your wife wear a necklace?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did they steal that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I bought her this Indian squash-blossom necklace.<eos> Antique, you know?<eos> She just looked so cute in it.
It's one of the sacred relics Brother Maynard carries.<eos> Brother Maynard!<eos> Bring up the Holy Hand Grenade.<eos> How does it...<eos> How does it work?<eos> - I know not, my liege.<eos> - Consult the Book of Armaments.<eos> Armaments 2: 9-21.<eos> "And St. Attila raised the hand grenade up on high, saying,<eos> "'O Lord, bless this thy hand grenade, that with it thou mayest
Thanks.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Marshal Pearce.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You're all mighty relaxed in the face of what's transpired aboard this train.<eos> - What?<eos> - If Deakin's right, Molyneux was killed.<eos> The telegraph line to Myrtle no longer works.<eos> It could be ice or animals, even wind.<eos> I think this bears investigation, more than you're giving it.
Getting more secret instructions from the lunatic fringe?<eos> Why don't you just turn me in and get it over with?<eos> No need to.<eos> You've blown your cover.<eos> You're no threat to me.<eos> Anyway, you're not someone I would throw away.<eos> - I have a job to do.<eos> - Your job is a waste of time.<eos> The world doesn't wanna be saved.<eos> I'm giving you a chance to save one small part of it.
- The victim.<eos> Wait a moment, madam, wait a moment.<eos> We are not about to cause you harm.<eos> Now wait just a moment.<eos> Everything's all right.<eos> Why don't you sit down here, and let me talk to you.<eos> I'm Sergeant Power of the Second Precinct.<eos> I must inform you of the series of somewhat bizarre events... that were confessed to me by the man who is apparently your husband.<eos> But both men were involved.<eos> The gist of it, according to the little guy... when attempting to make it look like an accidental occurrence... they went out and purchased a poisonous snake... with the intentions of inducing it to bite you.
They come from Sikandergul with a message for son of Sikander.<eos> They're looking at him, if they opened their eyes.<eos> -The message's from Kaf u Selim. -Who?<eos> Kaf u Selim, high priest of Kafiristan.<eos> What's the message?<eos> Kaf u Selim says come. Come?<eos> -ls that all?<eos> -That's all, just come.<eos> Doesn't waste words, does he?<eos> Tell him we appreciate the invitation. We'll avail ourselves of it...
Stop prettying yourself up! Let's go!<eos> Are you coming or what?<eos> - I'm coming... I'm coming! - Pro Civitate can't wait!<eos> Let's go! Bye, honey!<eos> Move ahead!<eos> Let's leave together...<eos> Does a true sense of family still exist, Representative?<eos> Yes, there's no doubt about it!<eos> The family institution is the rock upon which our nation's foundation lies.<eos> In it, citizens find the fulfilment and achievement of every goal...
And his legs-- they help him carry hundreds of times his own weight but look at this.<eos> You're not so strong compared with me.<eos> Four, five, six... ha!<eos> I didn't know ants had six legs, marcus.<eos> I assure you, they do, mr. ellis.<eos> Hey, you've got two legs missing.<eos> And that's a false feeler, marcus.<eos> Blimey!<eos> I'm taking this ant back, mother.<eos> It's got two legs missing.
I can tell, that damn thing Just doesn't understand.<eos> Look, bomb! ...<eos> Commander, Sir? You still there?<eos> Oh, yes, Doolittle, I'm thinking.<eos> We're running out of time, sir.<eos> Oh, yes...<eos> Well, Doolittle, if you can't get it to drop you'll have to talk to it.<eos> - Sir?<eos> Talk to the bomb.<eos> - But I have been talking to it, sir!
Look, bomb! ...<eos> Commander, Sir?

Pull it all the way.<eos> Here, hold this.<eos> All right, pull the chair. Hold it up here.<eos> We need something flexible to strap 'em in.<eos> Pantyhose.<eos> Barbara, take off your pantyhose, damn it.<eos> You, too.<eos> Come on.<eos> Take off your pantyhose.<eos> Get it out.
That is very good, Sarah.<eos> Drink this.<eos> Brandy. The best.<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Now, just sit in that chair, cross your legs and relax.<eos> I'm perfectly sane.<eos> I'll be the judge of that.<eos> Now, just face the light, please.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Now, I want you to look at the point of my finger and follow it with your eyes.
Gatsby, who represented everything for which I have an unaffected scorn.<eos> For Gatsby turned out all right in the end.<eos> It was what preyed on him, what foul dust floated in the wake of his dreams.<eos> At least once a fortnight, a corps of caterers came with several hundred feet of canvas and enough coloured lights to make a Christmas tree of Gatsby's gardens.<eos> There was music from my neighbour's house through those summer nights.<eos> In his enchanted gardens, men and girls came and went like moths, among the whispering and the champagne and the stars.<eos> I believe few people were actually invited to these parties, they just went.<eos> They got into automobiles which bore them to Long Island, and somehow they ended up at Gatsby's door, come for the party with a simplicity of heart that was its own admission ticket.<eos> After that, they conducted themselves according to the rules of behaviour associated with an amusement park.<eos> About half way between the two Eggs and New York, the motor road hastily joins the railroad and runs beside it a short distance, presided over by the eyes of Doctor T J Eckleburg, set there by some wild wag of an oculist to fatten his practice in Queens.
- Did something happen to you? - It's not because of my origins. It's because of my life, isn't it?<eos> A kept lover. Illegal dealings.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> Yes, my dear, that's what matters.<eos> It matters because I wasn't successful.<eos> Because I'm still just a rich woman's lapdog, to be brought where other dogs are strictly forbidden.<eos> Of course the others don't mind when he steals food, or makes a mess, or bites.<eos> Don't say these things, you know they're not true!<eos> Don't encourage him, Bianca, he just wants to attack our corrupt capitalist bourgeois society.<eos> You're talking about a society that doesn't exist anymore, and if it does exist all you do is profit from it.
I couldn't improve one bit on what we've had together.<eos> Oh, Robert.<eos> We've received a message from the Federation that might bring you some cheer.<eos> Lieutenant Uhura, would you relay it to Commodore April and his wife?<eos> In view of Commodore April's heroic actions aboard the U.S.S. Enterprise this stardate, we are reviewing his mandatory retirement, and will consider his appeal to remain Federation Ambassador-at-large.<eos> Well, good.<eos> Just because someone is 75 years old doesn't mean they're ready to stop giving service to the galaxy!<eos> Arriving at Babel in one hour, 15 minutes, Captain.<eos> I see your flower has blossomed again.<eos> Yes, our trip into the negative universe gave it a second life.
You know a white guy by the name of Terry Lennox.<eos> Who says I do?<eos> His address book, and that yellow bomb downstairs in your garage.<eos> - So?<eos> - Marlowe, just answer the question.<eos> You wanna know what I did last night?<eos> My cat woke me up in the middle of the night.<eos> He was really hungry.<eos> I went to fix him his favourite cat food, Coury Brand, the only kind he eats.<eos> I was out of it, so I picked something else up and the cat clawed the hell out of me.
You see, his experiments had led him to believe that it was possible to induce here the successful growth of certain new strains of fruit that he had developed.<eos> So, with typical mid-Victorian zeal, he set to work.<eos> The best way of accomplishing this, so it seemed to him, was to rouse the people from their apathy by giving them back their joyous old gods, and as a result of this worship, the barren island would burgeon and bring forth fruit in great abundance.<eos> What he did, of course, was to develop new cultivars of hardy fruits suited to local conditions.<eos> But, of course, to begin with, they worked for him because he fed them and clothed them, but later, when the trees starting fruiting, it became a very different matter.<eos> And the ministers fled the island, never to return.<eos> What my grandfather had started out of expediency, my father continued out of...<eos> love.<eos> He brought me up the same way, to reverence the music and the drama and the rituals of the old gods.<eos> To love nature and to fear it, and to rely on it and to appease it where necessary.
My name is Klen, my planet is Jupiter.<eos> My house.<eos> My wife.<eos> My chauffeur.<eos> - My lover.<eos> - Hi! A thousand a week.<eos> My art factory.<eos> We produce a new line of art every season.<eos> We created a love machine.<eos> To make it live the spectator has to work with it, guide it, receive it, give himself in the act of love.
I followed her in the park... and it was as if I brought her there.<eos> Somebody saw you?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Come on!<eos> Let's go...<eos> You smell like musk.<eos> How long is this story going to last?<eos> I mean, between you and Manfredi.<eos> Forever.<eos> It started before reason and went on far beyond it.
l'll put it aside for you, and it'll be there when you want it.<eos> Master, our bodies are prey to many needs.<eos> Hunger, thirst, the need for love.<eos> In one lifetime, a man knows many pleasures:<eos> A mother's smile in waking hours, a young woman's intimate, searing touch and the laughter of grandchildren in the twilight years.<eos> To deny these in ourselves is to deny that which makes us one with nature.<eos> Shall we then seek to satisfy these needs?<eos> Only acknowledge them.<eos> And satisfaction will follow.<eos> To suppress a truth is to give it force beyond endurance.
He's a chirpy little fellow, isn't he?<eos> Isn't he a chirpy little fellow, eh?<eos> Does he talk? Does he talk, eh?<eos> Of course I can talk.<eos> I'm minister for overseas development.<eos> Ooh, he's a clever little boy!<eos> He's a clever little boy!<eos> Do you like your rattle, eh?<eos> Do you like your rattle?<eos> Look at his eyes following it, eh.
One thing bothers me, though.<eos> That's a single. You're sure that was a single?<eos> - That was a single.<eos> - They usually travel in pairs.<eos> - No, you don't have to worry.<eos> - I've never seen one by itself.<eos> Two, yes.<eos> But not just one.<eos> So we're gonna take a nipple print, just so we'll have ID on this one.<eos> I think we'll put it on probation for maybe... 90 days, and then take it down to the orphanage.
That's where it is.<eos> But this time, I am not going to tell you what it is.<eos> All right.<eos> He looked disappointed in you.<eos> But then, it's no laughing matter.<eos> Or is it?<eos> Do that again.<eos> My God, he's never winked at me before.<eos> I suppose the other lash is on one of poor Tea's eyes.<eos> She won't miss it.
Ridiculous.<eos> We must choose a leader...<eos> What about keeping it livable?<eos> -...to unite us together.<eos> LUH 9998. -LUH?<eos> Uh....<eos> What happened?<eos> -My friend, your point of view yes, CAM, that's it.<eos> JOT.<eos> Your point is well taken, CAM but it lacks the balance that a broader and deeper range of experience can lend it.
Jimmy's been crying.<eos> Where does Purdham live?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> - Think!<eos> I'm trying.<eos> - Where does Purdham live?<eos> - Try the cookie jar.<eos> - The cookie jar.<eos> - Where I keep my addresses.<eos> We've gotta find that duck... before anything happens to it.
Now the whole world will be after that duck.<eos> - What did he say when you told him?<eos> - He just laughed.<eos> Laughed?<eos> He just... laughed?<eos> Do you hear that, Albert?<eos> He just laughed!<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She solved our whole problem.<eos> She can tell them the truth, they'll never believe it.
Then she embraced me.<eos> I was devoted to her.<eos> Two little girls caressed all night... one knowing, one docile.<eos> She taught me to touch certain parts of my body... one especially.<eos> She convinced me... not to talk about our secret.<eos> After she left, I sometimes did it alone.<eos> I didn't understand that part of me.<eos> I only knew it was private and mustn't be seen. It wasn't to be mentioned.<eos> The habit would leave me alone... then come back.<eos> I'd give into it... angry... unable to stop.
just walking.<eos> come on now.<eos> be a good boy.<eos> open up.<eos> see?<eos> but i'm having to leave no-- little monkeys.<eos> you see, he likes it.<eos> must be the hot air.<eos> how do you know all these things?<eos> quint, what will happen to it?
Will passengers for flight one Please assemble at gate one.<eos> Passengers are advised That there is still plenty of time To buy eccles cakes.<eos> Nearly ready.<eos> Will passengers please get ready For their barley sugar injections.<eos> Today we all take vow.<eos> Today we smash the enemy fleet!<eos> We... smash... smash!<eos> That's mr. kamikaze, the pilot.<eos> He's very nice, really But make sure he stays clear of battleships.<eos> There have been many stirring tales told of the sea And also some fairly uninteresting ones Only marginally connected with it, like this one.
He's under.<eos> Good.<eos> What else would you like me to do?<eos> What kind of a cockeyed schedule is this?<eos> Ain't got no passengers, just two, three sacks of mail.<eos> Well, it don't matter really. I'm leaving.<eos> - Leaving?<eos> - You leaving the desert?<eos> It's a big world, fellas.<eos> I wanna see some of it.
There's some good things on it.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> The TV.<eos> There's some good things on it sometimes.<eos> I have strong doubts.<eos> Nevertheless, I am not discussing media.<eos> But there is always hope.<eos> -For the few.<eos> -What about love?<eos> What about it?
- I remember the dedication...<eos> - "To my beloved daughter<eos> -Mama."<eos> How'd you know?<eos> Go on.<eos> I had a different name then, after all, I don"t look Jewish.<eos> You look like an Aryan.<eos> It"s scary.<eos> What about love?<eos> You said you"d escaped from it.
It made me sick.<eos> Pawnee scouts and soldiers was killing everything.<eos> Shadow!<eos> Brother, let's talk.<eos> Shadow...<eos> I just took care of him.<eos> I'm saving you for the hanging.<eos> There is no describing how I felt.<eos> An enemy had saved my life by the violent murder of one of my best friends.<eos> The world was too ridiculous even to bother to live in it.
- You don't look German.<eos> - Well, I am.<eos> You don't look like a hitchhiker.<eos> 'I had imagined this journey as a quest.<eos> 'I finished my studies in math.<eos> 'I wanted to live.<eos> 'I wanted to burn all the bridges, all the formulas, 'and if I got burned, that was OK too.<eos> 'I wanted to be warm.<eos> 'I wanted the sun.<eos> 'And I went after it. '
Awfully bad.<eos> Two civilian gentlemen to see you, sir.<eos> - Show them in, please, sergeant. - Mr. Dino Vercotti and Mr. Luigi Vercotti.<eos> Morning, colonel.<eos> Morning, gentlemen.<eos> Now, what can I do for you?<eos> You've...<eos> You've got a nice army base here, colonel.<eos> Yes.<eos> We wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
- Please.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> Dear lady.<eos> I do not propose to discuss with you the rights and wrongs of practicing the Magick Art.<eos> I will confine myself to saying that I am a practitioner of some experience.<eos> Monsieur de Richleau has, no doubt, led you to believe that I am thoroughly evil.<eos> Such is not the case.<eos> In magick, there is neither good nor evil.<eos> It is merely a science, the science of causing change to occur by means of one's will.<eos> The sinister reputation attaching to it is entirely groundless and is based on superstition, rather than objective observation.
Noah, run over to the workhouse.<eos> Get Mr. Bumble.<eos> Tell him to come quick.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where is the young rascal?<eos> - Oliver?<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> - Do you know this voice?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Ain't you afraid of it?
We'll accept any punishment you decree.<eos> What do you wish to say?<eos> You must believe that what I'm about to tell you is the truth.<eos> Your truth. Of your world.<eos> Yes, my world and your world of Yonada.<eos> You do not obey the law of the creators.<eos> How can you understand my world?<eos> I understand.<eos> I understand, Natira.<eos> Ten thousand years ago, a sun was dying, and with it, its world.
Warp factor 1, sir.<eos> Mr. Chekov, prepare to launch telemetry probe into that zone.<eos> - Direct computer feed to Mr. Spock. - Aye, sir.<eos> Probe ready.<eos> Switching data feed to library computer.<eos> - Launch probe.<eos> - Probe launched, sir.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - The telemetry probe, sir.<eos> There's no signal from it now.
Coming to new course, sir.<eos> Bearing on the Potemkin.<eos> Phasers firing.<eos> Whose engrams?<eos> - Why, mine, of course.<eos> - Of course.<eos> Then perhaps you could talk to the unit.<eos> M-5 has no reason to believe you would harm it.<eos> The computer tie-in.<eos> You spoke to it before, it knows you.
Judy.<eos> Judy, now, listen to me.<eos> We've got to have that box.<eos> What did you do with the box?<eos> I do not intend to continue this ridiculous treasure hunt.<eos> Now, this animal is trained.<eos> She was ordered to bring the box back and she did.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I haven't laid eyes on that box.<eos> Any one of a hundred things could have happened to it.
It is love, oh, my most cherished.<eos> I see it in your eyes.<eos> This is love profane. Must be sin in me that so confounds my senses.<eos> There is no sin in love, my darling.<eos> And I love you for all eternity.<eos> Margaret.<eos> You know my name.<eos> What magic is afoot?<eos> Our love is written in the book of fate.<eos> There is no escaping it.
I would like to, sing this song.<eos> It's about love...<eos> And hate.<eos> Psychedelically speaking, I am talking about "the power."<eos> "Love power "I'm talkin' 'bout "Love power<eos> "The power of a sweet flower "Is gonna rule the earth<eos> "And there'll be a great rebirth<eos> "Love is the flower that is mine "When I'm walkin' with my darlin' "And we're holdin' hands<eos> "And I give a flower to the big, fat cop "He takes his club, and he beats me up "I give a flower to the garbage man<eos> "He throws it in a toilet "And he flush it down "It goes into the sewer
Come here, Pussy.<eos> Come on over here.<eos> That's a good girl.<eos> - Hi.<eos> The coach is traveling with $200,000 on board.<eos> It's no doubt about it out that some soldiers are following it.
Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Thank you for a wonderful dinner.<eos> - Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> How long were you actually in the city with Akim and the inspector?<eos> Oh, perhaps several hours.<eos> Do you think that you saw everything?<eos> We were escorted the whole time, but it seemed a thorough tour.<eos> Fasar, if there is still slavery in Elkabar, then you are the one who must put an end to it.
Because the order would fall on me next and you know how Captain Kirk's enemies have a habit of disappearing.<eos> If I am successful, you see yourself a step nearer to the captaincy.<eos> I do not want to command the Enterprise, but if it should befall me, I suggest you remember that my operatives would avenge my death and some of them are Vulcans.<eos> Oiling my traps, darling.<eos> I'm afraid I'm a little out of practice.<eos> Maybe that's what happened to us.<eos> It's very hard for a working officer to shine as a woman every minute.<eos> - And you demand perfection.<eos> - l've never seen perfection.<eos> But no woman could come closer to it.
Aye, we do.<eos> Our phasers.<eos> I can adapt them and use their energy. It'll take time, but it's possible.<eos> Trouble is, they happen to be our only defence.<eos> They would also seem to be our only hope. Aye.<eos> Yeoman, your phaser.<eos> But what if the creatures attack again?<eos> They won't attack for at least several hours.<eos> By then, with luck, we'll be gone.<eos> If I can get a full load, we should be able to achieve orbit with all hands. Not that we can maintain it long.
Many years ago, when I was a small boy, I remember my grandfather telling me he had actually seen the iron gates where Teepu held our people until they were ransomed.<eos> My grandfather and the neighboring chiefs would bring silver and gold even uncut diamonds to Teepu to buy their release.<eos> According to this map, this supposed treasure would be in a cave in the northeast corner of our reserve.<eos> I know the caves very well.<eos> Nothing in them but bats.<eos> Well, this inscription here, if I remember my Latin well enough says something to the effect that: This chart or map set down by me in secret, "ex adverso," from adversity "anno domini" 1851.<eos> My signature, Omar Hassad.<eos> Well, doctor old Omar Hassad was either a faker or a very poor mapmaker.<eos> No, I've heard of this map.<eos> Several people have tried to work from it.
-... inthesameorbit.<eos> -You need a rest. As soon as this is over--<eos> Look. Shut up, Zack.<eos> This is junk.<eos> Then why was it transmitted by shortwave radio?<eos> -We intercepted it last night.<eos> -Brief him on that, Homer.<eos> She's got a 20-foot aerial rigged at her house.<eos> -Shortwave.<eos> -You know she operates it?
We are weak. Too weak to fight.<eos> You fight every day of your lives.<eos> You fight the land to grow crops.<eos> You fight to keep a roof over your heads, clothes on your back.<eos> That is not the same.<eos> The hell it's not.<eos> We are cowards, señor.<eos> We are afraid of everyone, of everything.<eos> Our whole life is one of fear.<eos> We are born with it. We die with it.
Detecting high respiration patterns, perspiration rates up, heartbeat rapid, blood pressure higher than normal.<eos> Well, that's sufficient.<eos> Strike that from the record, Mr. Spock.<eos> Do you see, gentlemen?<eos> Just as I told you, three lovely ladies destined for frontier planets to be the companions of lonely men.<eos> To supply that warmth of a human touch that's so desperately needed.<eos> A wife, a home, a family.<eos> Gentlemen, I look upon this work as a sacred public trust.<eos> I've devoted me whole life to it. Incorrect.<eos> Well, I'm about to start devoting my entire life to it.
Sometimes reality can be too complex to be conveyed by the spoken word.<eos> Legend remoulds it into a form that can be spread all across the world.
I desire steadfast love, and not sacrifice.<eos> A knowledge of God, and not burnt offerings.<eos> Repent!<eos> Repent!<eos> Come near, and listen to the voice of one crying in the wilderness.<eos> Every valley shall be filled, and every mountain and hill shall be brought low, and the rough way smooth.<eos> And all flesh shall see the salvation of God.<eos> Prepare ye the way of the Lord, and make straight in the desert a highway for our God.<eos> Behold, I send my messenger who shall prepare the way.<eos> Let the earth hear, and all that is in it and all things that come from it.
Once upon a time in a mythical place called Cape Kennedy an astronaut named Tony Nelson went up on a space mission.<eos> The missile went up but something went wrong, and they had to bring it down.<eos> Captain Nelson landed on an island in the South Pacific where he found a bottle.<eos> At least it looked like a bottle.<eos> But it didn't act like a bottle. Because in it was a genie.

Master, would you like some more coffee?<eos> Sugar?<eos> Master, is that newspaper more entertaining than I am?<eos> No, no.<eos> Don't be silly, Jeannie.<eos> Well, you hide behind it and never even notice me.
Let be.<eos> Give me your pardon, sir.<eos> I've done you wrong.<eos> This presence knows, and you must needs have heard, how I am punished with sore distraction.<eos> What I have done, what might your nature, honour, and exception roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.<eos> If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away, and does he wrong Laertes, then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.<eos> Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil free me, that I have shot mine arrow o'er the house, and hurt my brother.<eos> I am satisfied in nature, whose motive, in this case, should stir me most to my revenge.<eos> But in my terms of honour I stand aloof, and will no reconcilement till by some elder masters, I have a voice and precedent of peace, to keep my name ungored.<eos> But till that time I do receive your offered love, and will not wrong it.
You in your bed over there, and me, light years away in mine here.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think I'd like to stay out here for a while, but... thank you.<eos> You're gonna bring a little pazazz down to the old farm, my dear.<eos> I noticed before we left, Dad was pulling out his silk shirts.<eos> What do you mean, what will I do with myself?<eos> I had of course assumed I would become a society hostess.<eos> In Africa, in Kenya, there's quite a beautiful flower.<eos> It's coral coloured with little green-tipped blossoms, rather like a hyacinth.<eos> If you reach out to touch it, you'd discover that the flower was not a flower at all, but a design made up of hundreds of tiny insects called Fattid bugs.
Especially her predictions for the future.<eos> That should make an interesting programme.<eos> Does that mean the previous stories will be shelved?<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> But we'll start the series with the girl from Jupiter.<eos> But, we don't know where she is.<eos> Then go and find her.<eos> You have eyes and legs.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think it should be an exclusive.
How does Catherine seem to you?<eos> Marriage and motherhood suit her.<eos> She's less the grasshopper now and more the ant.<eos> Don't be deceived.<eos> True, she brings order and harmony to this house.<eos> But if things go too smoothly, discontent sets in.<eos> She lashes out at everything with her gestures and expressions.<eos> I've always thought as much. A little Napoleon.<eos> She claims the world is rich and that one can cheat a little now and then.<eos> She begs God in advance for forgiveness, certain she'll obtain it.
-Not in the middle?<eos> You'd think so, but he moves the card.<eos> Not under 20,000.<eos> -Will you throw in 10,000?<eos> I was so sure.<eos> -How is that possible?<eos> I must have been distracted.<eos> -Once again, with the ace of diamonds.<eos> It's all about the red one.<eos> Keep an eye on it.
From now on, this is your own brig, noble young Robin Hood.<eos> Keep quiet.<eos> No petticoated pirate will ever find where our ship is anchored.<eos> Poldychoke, you're so good!<eos> Captain, first mate Poldychoke awaits your command to weigh anchor.<eos> - Put her to sea!<eos> - Aye, aye, sir!<eos> Poldychoke, what shall we call my brig?<eos> Well, how about ?<eos> Have you ever sailed on it?
But you will never get a woman's love from me.<eos> Perhaps we have... wounded each other too deeply.<eos> Chimene.<eos> Is it our Chimene?<eos> Yes, Reverend Mother.<eos> It's Chimene.<eos> Why have you come back to us? I've come to find peace, Mother.<eos> After all that has happened to you... the peace you seek is not within these walls.<eos> You were made for the world, Chimene.<eos> One day you will want to go back to it.
I don't know anything about science fiction.<eos> A jukebox is a jukebox, and if that thing wants to start up all on its own, you'll check with an electrical engineer.<eos> Take me to your leader.<eos> Take me to your leader!<eos> Find anything?<eos> No.<eos> Took a look at the bridge.<eos> Holding up well.<eos> I know that bridge.<eos> What's more, i don't trust it.
Careful, darling.<eos> You don't want to go in there.<eos> I want you to see.<eos> Put your weight against it.<eos> (GATE CREAKS)<eos> Here they all are.<eos> The Ushers.<eos> It's the lack of air in here.<eos> It's the air itself.<eos> Nothing can survive it long.
I have lost count of my enemies.<eos> - But you're with friends now.<eos> - Yes.<eos> The final, supreme idiocy:<eos> comin' here to hide.<eos> The deserter, hiding' out in the middle of a battlefield.<eos> One.<eos> There was a time when I woulda caught all three.<eos> We know what fear is.<eos> We live with it all our lives.
Normal.<eos> The way you'd like to look.<eos> Doctor... doctor... may i walk outside?<eos> Please, may i?<eos> May i just go and... and sit in the garden?<eos> Just... just for a little while. Just...<eos> just to feel the air.<eos> Just... just to smell the flowers.<eos> Just... just to make believe i am normal?<eos> If... if i sit out there in the darkness, then the whole world is dark, and i'm more a part of it like that, not just... one grotesque, ugly woman with a bandage on her face with a special darkness all around.
No, sir, it was not.<eos> Was the suggestion to call it "some trouble" made by somebody in this courtroom?<eos> Yes, sir, it was.<eos> Would you tell the court what words Lt. Manion actually used to describe the trouble his wife had?<eos> Objection.<eos> We've been over this before.<eos> This would not be relevant to any issues before the court.<eos> The statement "some trouble" came out during the examination of Sgt. Durgo.<eos> Up to now, you've adroitly restricted all testimony concerning Laura Manion.<eos> The cat's out of the bag, it's fair game for me to chase it.
Thanks for your efforts, Hager.<eos> And thanks to you, Franziska.<eos> Let's hear, how our romanticists translated these verses.<eos> Read, Scholten, you like them.<eos> Night covers me in her cloak<eos> If you don't want me, then let them find me.<eos> To die from their hatred,... is better to live without your love.<eos> Who showed you this place?<eos> The love, that made me be an explorer.<eos> It gave me advice - I gave it my eyes.
If I may make so bold as to ask you:<eos> What made you go to work in a sordid bar<eos> - as a light man on the night shift? - For throwing light into a dirty joint.<eos> If I may take the liberty of saying so, I find the expression a trifle vulgar.<eos> - Take it easy, James!<eos> - Very well, Sir.<eos> - But might I ask one more question?<eos> - If you must. You wish to put a camera in the bar?<eos> Yes. I'm going to place it in this box.<eos> It's connected to this photoelectric cell.
About ten minutes, huh?<eos> LEONARD:<eos> And now, uh....<eos> I wonder if I might have a few words of parting with you, sir?<eos> Certainly.<eos> In private?<eos> I'll go up and get my things.<eos> VANDAMM:<eos> Well, Leonard how does one say goodbye to one's right arm?<eos> I'm afraid you're gonna wish you had cut it off sooner.
- No mercy for the losers.<eos> - You'll be hearing a lot of it.<eos> I guess we made him talk after all.<eos> Just thought you'd like to know, sheriff.<eos> Stumpy!<eos> - What?<eos> - They don't need any help with that tune.<eos> What's the matter, is it getting through to you?<eos> By the way, the stage got off all right.<eos> I watched it clear through the valley.
These aren't my clothes, Ma.<eos> I had everything shipped on ahead. Should be here tomorrow or the next day.<eos> These are just some things I cleaned out of my desk when I quit.<eos> If you want to know the truth, Ma, I didn't quit.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Ma. Maybe that's why I'm so jumpy.<eos> Don't pay any attention to me.<eos> I'll be all right after I get a good night's sleep.<eos> Good night, dear.<eos> Good night, Ma.<eos> Nothing more was ever said about that little black bag and I don't know what Michael did with it.
I'm glad the thing is dead.<eos> I'll see you out, Inspector.<eos> - Inspector...<eos> - I'll be with you in a moment.<eos> - Inspector.<eos> - Do you believe the story?<eos> Well, it explains all the facts.<eos> The reason for the press, the fly, everything.<eos> True.<eos> But I asked you if you believed it.
-Why can't I go with you? This is a very delicate and diplomatic matter.<eos> I don't want you to put your foot in it.<eos> I deal with diplomatic matters every day without feet.<eos> -Promise not to say anything?<eos> -I won't say a word.<eos> Now wait a minute.<eos> Does it have to be the Sea Witch?<eos> -Why that particular yacht?<eos> -Please, please, it has to be.<eos> I once was a guest on it. It must be the Sea Witch.
My hero.<eos> All right. Ready, Doris?<eos> Begin.<eos> Philip, what are you doing here?<eos> He'll stand there disappointed. He'll take a moment. To understand.<eos> Supper for two, the red roses.<eos> Then he'll look back at me.<eos> I'll look at the door, frightened.<eos> I'll run to the door.<eos> I'll stand in front of it, speechless, hand to my mouth.
We hope this electro-dynamometer will enable us to complete our examination of the oral passages.<eos> Could you give us any positive statement on your progress so far, Doctor?<eos> So far, we have come to one conclusion:<eos> The creature's olfactory system is more highly developed than any known on this planet.<eos> We'll find Dr. Uhl on the platform.<eos> He's the man in charge.<eos> Sixty-seven cc's.<eos> Correct?<eos> They're feeding the creature a compound of sulphur.<eos> Now, sulphur serves it as our vitamins do us.
We're the last people left.<eos> I hope to see you in Lisbon.<eos> My ladies will be delighted.<eos> I'm looking forward to meeting them.<eos> -Sleep soundly and dream about the eocene age, the prehistoric animals and the shapely arm with its ancient bone structure!<eos> Good night, professor.<eos> Lisbon and Hotel Savoy Palace received me like a prince.<eos> 'Step back, further back!<eos> The gilded world.<eos> Now I was really part of it.
It's this question I asked her.<eos> If you should say to me, "What question?" I would tell you.<eos> What question?<eos> We'll try it again.<eos> Should Bunny Watson marry Mike Cutler?<eos> Question mark.<eos> Oh, wait a minute.<eos> I thought you said this machine can't evaluate.<eos> Can't. Can't.<eos> It can only repeat information fed into it by the human elements.
- Is something wrong, sir?<eos> - No. May I use your phone?<eos> - Of course, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Graves Registration, on the double, quick.<eos> Graves Registration, you picked up a body from the 1066 General Hospital today?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> That's the one.<eos> It's Captain Lock, Adjutant, speaking.<eos> What did you do with it?
- Hello. - Mr. Rath?<eos> - Yes?<eos> - This is South Bay police headquarters.<eos> Sergeant Haggerty speaking.<eos> We have Mrs. Rath here. We picked her up walking on the Merrick Parkway.<eos> - Is she all right?<eos> - Yes, she's all right.<eos> A little tired, maybe. But - Has she got an operator's license?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll bring it right over.
Sir?<eos> Mr. Starbuck, new orders.<eos> We remain here until eight bells tonight... at which time we'll lower whaleboats... kedge the ship north... and row out of these waters.<eos> Aye, aye, sir.<eos> At eight bells.<eos> I'm beating a march to you, Queequeg.<eos> Get along.<eos> Get along quiet now, Queequeg.<eos> You follow the tide. It knows where to go.<eos> You get along with it. It'll take you, Queequeg. Get along.
Why have I never been a young lover?<eos> Can you tell me that?<eos> My dear little girl... console yourself.<eos> There are only a few young lovers in the world.<eos> You could almost count them.<eos> Love has befallen them as a gift and a punishment.<eos> - And the rest of us?<eos> - The rest of us...!<eos> What becomes of us?<eos> We invoke love, call it beg for it, cry for it, try to mimic it...
We have come to the end of our line.<eos> Literally, to the end of the line.<eos> It is time for the Torlato-Favrinis to get off the world.<eos> The fact remains that we are neither unique nor important to the world, and it will go on without us.<eos> How will we be remembered, I wonder?<eos> Why should we be remembered at all?<eos> Nobility - the kind that continues just because it continues to exist - is becoming extinct.<eos> But why?<eos> Because the world has become a changed place.<eos> And, like the dinosaurs, we can no longer function in it.
You'd better check with Lagana first.<eos> He might not approve.<eos> I'll have your badge and gun. Now.<eos> You can have it... permanently.<eos> One moment.<eos> I asked for your gun, too.<eos> That doesn't belong to the department.<eos> It's mine, bought and paid for.<eos> I'm warning you officially.<eos> Don't try to use it.
Who is this? - Your good friend...<eos> Captain Haynes, of the homicide detail.<eos> Oh, hello Sam.<eos> I read your ad in the paper. If you'll just tell me what size police badge you wear,<eos> I'll come over and pin it on your chest.<eos> By the way, has the little lady turned herself in to you yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well... in case she does do me a favor, will you? And give her our number.<eos> Michigan 5211.<eos> Got it? 5211.
They're leaving tonight.<eos> They crashed here by mistake, and now they're fixing their ship to get out!<eos> They can't get out.<eos> They're buried under tons of Earth. Now take me to Ellen.<eos> I tell you, she's safe as long as you don't interfere!<eos> Then why don't they come out in the open?<eos> Because they don't trust us.<eos> Because what we don't understand, we want to destroy.<eos> I kill only what tries to kill me.<eos> That spider... why are you afraid of it?
I must warn him.<eos> You're too late.<eos> Even now he is before Pilate.<eos> - They found him?<eos> - He was betrayed to them, and by one he loved and trusted.<eos> By his disciple, who sat at his left hand.<eos> Why?<eos> Because men are weak.<eos> Because they are cursed with envy and cowardice.<eos> Because they can dream of truth, but cannot live with it, they doubt.
I can't see.<eos> I'm blind, Harry.<eos> - I'm blind!<eos> - Blind?<eos> How stupid can you get, Animal?<eos> The killer-diller, of course, the real bonanza was when Sefton put up the observatory.<eos> He scrounged some high-powered Kraut lenses and a magnifying mirror, and got Ronnie Bigelow from Barracks 2 to put it together for a pound of coffee.<eos> On a clear day you could see the Swiss Alps.<eos> Only who wanted to see the Swiss Alps?<eos> It was about a mile away from that Russian delousing shack, but we were right on top of it.
Two guys in this barracks know I didn't do it.<eos> Me and the guy that did do it.<eos> It could be any one of you.<eos> You, Hoffy, or Duke, or Price, the Animal, or Blondie, or even Joey.<eos> And he'd better watch out, the guy that left me holding the stick.<eos> If there's gonna be any throats cut in this barracks...<eos> Achtung! Everybody at attention for the Geneva man!<eos> As you were, gentlemen, please.<eos> Here we have a typical barrack.<eos> It houses 75 men.
I'm going back to the Indians, Camilla.<eos> I'm going to leave this...<eos> civilization... that's making us brutal and dishonest... start a new life, close to nature... among rivers and forests.<eos> A new life with you, Camilla.<eos> - Will you come back with me?<eos> - That's what I wanted to hear.<eos> Won't they dance with joy to see us arrive in the coach?<eos> You know, it's mine now.<eos> Yes. So I see.<eos> We'll have to give up the idea of traveling in it, though.
Baby, we have to.<eos> Love is rotten when it happens like this, the hard way.<eos> But if we want each other, this is the fire we walk through.<eos> Because this is forever, Mae.<eos> Forever?<eos> Or until he sticks a knife in me or you walk out.<eos> How could I walk out?<eos> Then do the next thing, get away from here.<eos> If you have a dream, live it.<eos> If you have a hope, chase it.
You will be found guilty and you will be burnt at the stake and the ashes of your body will be scattered to the four winds.<eos> I pray my people will not be ashamed of the way I die.<eos> The trial cannot be halted, but the sentence can.<eos> When charged, confess.<eos> To what? Crimes I have not committed?<eos> No matter, confess and ask for pardon.<eos> They must grant it on one condition:<eos> That you renounce the faith of Israel.<eos> I would not live in the world you offer.<eos> It has neither sun nor moon, nor air to breathe.
Very well.<eos> It is done.<eos> Then there is no appeal.<eos> It is the will of God, and I accept it.<eos> It is not his will that you should die, David.<eos> Worthy or unworthy, you are his anointed.<eos> Through Samuel, he chose you to lead his people.<eos> Your labors in his behalf are still unfinished.<eos> But you cannot escape the punishment of the Lord.<eos> I have not escaped it.
For the first time, Gaius, I disobey you.<eos> What have I done that forever I should hear the sweet thunder of your heart?<eos> You have given me your love.<eos> And now, my friends, I wish to write a letter to our emperor.<eos> Scribe?<eos> Will you permit me?<eos> Let us hear it, Petronius.<eos> To Nero, emperor of Rome master of the world, divine pontiff.<eos> I know that my death will be a disappointment to you since you wished to render me this service yourself.<eos> To be born in your reign is a miscalculation but to die in it is a joy.
All right, I'll pay.<eos> He says now, Mr. Harry.<eos> He says thank you, Mr. Harry.<eos> We get a bus in two hours.<eos> Looks like we're on our way.<eos> Do we have to wait here?<eos> -I'm afraid so.<eos> Cigarette?<eos> -No, thank you.<eos> I'll be glad to leave this town and everything in it.
- Urbain?<eos> - My goodness.<eos> - See? - My goodness, I'm so happy.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> The idiot!<eos> It's still my name and my château. It's like you're marrying me, I'm so happy!<eos> You're always happy!<eos> It's horrible!<eos> Careful, Miquette! "At the foot of this wall, the sea is dark and deep.<eos> It takes good care of the secrets that we entrust it with.
That note you were going for.<eos> That thing you were trying for.<eos> There is no such thing, Rick.<eos> Not on the trumpet.<eos> He dropped out of sight after that, and word got around he was washed-up.<eos> The truth is, the only thing in the world he felt safe with was his trumpet.<eos> And when that let him down too, he just couldn't take it.<eos> He went to pieces, but not in any small way.<eos> Habit is a remarkable thing.<eos> It escapes no one.
They must have jumped them at sundown. It was a pretty big party.<eos> Twenty-five or 30, anyway. Mescalero Apaches.<eos> I found this.<eos> - Blood.<eos> - Apaches carry off their dead.<eos> It's Mescaleros, all right.<eos> Diablo's band.<eos> You say their trail led off to the south?<eos> It headed that way, sir, but...<eos> You didn't follow it long enough to find out?
Bernardo hath my place.<eos> Give you good night. - Holla!<eos> Bernardo!<eos> - Say, what, is Horatio there?<eos> A piece of him.<eos> Welcome, Horatio.<eos> What... has this thing appeared again tonight?<eos> I have seen nothing.<eos> Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy and will not let belief take hold of him, touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us.<eos> Therefore I've entreated him along with us to watch the minutes of this night, that if again this apparition comes he may approve our eyes and speak to it.
- Can you play the murder of Gonzago?<eos> - Ay, my lord. We'll have it tomorrow night.<eos> You could for a need study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines that I would set down and insert in it, could you not?<eos> Ay, my lord.<eos> Very well.<eos> Follow that lord, and look you mock him not.<eos> The play's the thing wherein I'll catch the conscience of the King!<eos> Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to you - trippingly on the tongue.<eos> But if you mouth it, as many of your players do,<eos> Nor do not saw the air too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently, for in the very torrent, tempest, and as I may say, whirlwind of your passion, you must acquire and beget a temperance that may give it smoothness.
- What is it you like to be called?<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> - Patrick or Jamieson?<eos> - Whichever comes easiest.<eos> There would be an afternoon off once a week and every evening unless I particularly wanted you to be here.<eos> You could ring me up.<eos> And how much are you asking? If I may ask.<eos> Well, in this case, just my meals and lodging would be quite enough.<eos> You would have wages suitable to the position, Patrick.<eos> Whether or not you would be suitable for it, I'm not yet sure.
Where is he?<eos> You'll find him the laboratory. Conover too.<eos> Come on.<eos> You won't need your revolver nor handcuffs.<eos> Oh.<eos> You got them.<eos> Yes.<eos> - Did they find the bust?<eos> - No.<eos> Well, what did you do with it?
A wonderful life, with my outcast sisters.<eos> Yes, sisters in misery. We welcome those freed from prison.<eos> Sins and misfortunes are divine guarantees.<eos> You're from a gentler background, and this is a hard legion.<eos> I must ensure you're up to it.<eos> Are you happy?<eos> - Very.<eos> - Healthy?<eos> Enough for the world I left.<eos> - You bid it farewell?
- Well... that's very interesting.<eos> What was the message?<eos> I had to swear to this young Romeo not to tell the husband.<eos> That gives you a rough idea of the message.<eos> Yes. - It is a little rough.<eos> - Seems they have a secret love code.<eos> - Am I boring you?<eos> - No, I find it very interesting.<eos> This flier gave me the message, and I couldn't make head nor tail of it... and neither will you.<eos> But Mrs. Tura seemed to understand it perfectly. Well, what was the message?
- You're not leaving town, are you?<eos> - No, I just... Well, I can't afford to keep it.<eos> I can't even begin to meet the taxes on it.<eos> I can't understand that. Matt always made good money.<eos> Why, just the day he died-- He collected $15,000 from Surrett, didn't he?<eos> That's what I thought too. But I've never seen a penny of it.<eos> Well, what have you done about it?<eos> I've spoken to Jeff Surrett about it, but he'll never give me an answer.<eos> - Joe. - Yes? It looks as if Mrs. Cole needs help.<eos> We might be able to give it.
Choking gives you a thirst.<eos> Thomas, I'm sure you'll oblige the gentleman.<eos> Seems I'm a good guesser, Mr Trehearne. How did you get it?<eos> Saved.<eos> You mean, you've been selling stuff on the side.<eos> I'm ashamed of you, Mr Trehearne.<eos> Taking the bread out of the mouths of your pals.<eos> There's your leak. Not true.<eos> He's making fools of the lot of you.<eos> Where do you think the stuff goes? Who gets rid of it?
I don't care where the child is, in the air, on the earth, or in the sea.<eos> If you face the rising sun, your right hand is north, your left hand is south.<eos> I get it twisted because I'm left-handed.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just reverse it.<eos> Your left hand is...<eos> What difference does it make?<eos> The north is the north.<eos> All I know is the sun rises in the east, and we're going away from it.
Early visit, huh?<eos> I just had my orders and I'm setting out. I thought I'd come along and say goodbye.<eos> -Just to me?<eos> -Well, should we say, the family?<eos> Elsa's still in her room but I'll call her.<eos> Tell memsahib she's wanted in the study immediately.<eos> Captain Vickers is here.<eos> -You have a very difficult job ahead of you.<eos> -Yes, I think so.<eos> -But I'm sure you're equal to it.
You hold it with your right hand, pull it up, hold it tight, then down it comes.<eos> That's working people for you.<eos> That's us, the proletariat.<eos> Up the right! Down the left!<eos> Up the right! Down the left!<eos> A great white bull is driven into the slaughterhouse.<eos> Open before it.<eos> The hall of blood, with sides of meat with quarters and chopped-up bones.<eos> The great bull has a broad forehead.<eos> With sticks and blows, its driven to the slaughterer who hits it lightly on the hind leg with the flat of the ax.
You don't consider that significant?<eos> I'm just using an extreme example to make a point.<eos> If you could, wouldn't you change places with Larry?<eos> But I can't!<eos> Didn't you ever play games like that?<eos> But not to the point where I got all hung up with it.<eos> You're becoming obsessed with the ugliness of old age.<eos> The fear of death.<eos> The inevitability of it.<eos> You'd change places with a homosexual to put it off.
- Okay.<eos> I'll just be a few minutes.<eos> Can you believe my timing?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Are you staying long?<eos> - No, just tonight.<eos> I'm staying at a hotel by the airport.<eos> Listen, this isn't a logical visit.<eos> I had an impulse to come here.<eos> An impulse I've had before, by the way, only... this time I decided to follow it.
Is that gun too uncomfortable in your armpit?<eos> No, no.<eos> I want you to meet my partner, Officer Eggleston.<eos> Uh... hi, Peter.<eos> Why don't you call me Bob?<eos> Hi, Bob.<eos> Nice car.<eos> Yeah, it's brand-new.<eos> L just picked it up about a half-hour ago.<eos> - I wouldn't want anything to happen to it.
He talks just like that.<eos> We'll be ready.<eos> Sunset, then.<eos> And a bird will fight for us.<eos> -A bird?<eos> -Even Woundwort won't expect that.<eos> Bigwig!<eos> That white bird you were talking to this morning--<eos> -Talking to, sir?<eos> -You were very close to it.
The subject was give an injection of Thanatoxin, a drug that produces violent anguish.<eos> What you will see is someone subjected to unbearable agony.<eos> Here you see him just as hes given the injection.<eos> You notice that he is quite balanced and is laughing and joking.<eos> An unusually nice boy, incidentally.<eos> He was a student of political science at the university.<eos> We are now at the condition of dread, which is getting worse and worse.<eos> In a few moments hell commit suicide.<eos> He picks up the revolver.<eos> You cant see it properly. Now you can see it.
Like that.<eos> Very well, as you're so bad-tempered, no more writing today.<eos> Baboon!<eos> Kassim, be quiet.<eos> Your friend is very disobedient today.<eos> - Please, Kassim, I'm trying to work!<eos> - Will you be still!<eos> Father, why is he behaving like that?<eos> Be careful.<eos> In the cage, in it!
# The Mount Eagle grade is steep and long<eos> # And everybody that seen it thought the Bandit was gone<eos> # All gone<eos> # Well, his truck jack-knifed turned completely around<eos> # He was comin' down backwards 'bout the speed of sound<eos> # A lot of folks seen him and they all say<eos> # He had his head out the window yelling', "Clear the way!"<eos> # Well, he got to the bottom safe and sound<eos> # Everybody asked Bandit how he made it down<eos> # He said, "Folks, when the truck picked up too much speed # "I just run along beside it and drug my feet"
They lived happily in the good areas.<eos> It was a big day in Montagar.<eos> Delia, queen of the fairies... was presiding over the feast of plenty... celebrating 3,000 years of peace.<eos> In the midst of the celebration... Delia felt a pull from the skies.<eos> She looked up and saw dark clouds... forming on the horizon in every direction.<eos> She fell into a trance and left the party... heading for her home on a high hill.<eos> At first, the fairies were puzzled.<eos> But then they too felt a force drawing them to follow.<eos> Delia was alone inside.<eos> The storm grew until it was a raging cyclone... hovering over the dwelling.
- Did you get them?<eos> Kill the baby!<eos> Ruby?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> Get it out here!<eos> You know what.<eos> - What?<eos> Just get it out here!<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Don't unwrap it till I'm away.
Easy, easy.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come on.<eos> They got him, Grandpa.<eos> They got the mustang.<eos> - Grandpa, you're all ready?<eos> - Yeah, we're ready for him.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> I'm gonna go see him.<eos> Go get it.
What did you go to jail for?<eos> I was working at a department store.<eos> I used to steal records with a friend of mine.<eos> We'd give them to Daniel and he'd sell them at flea-markets.<eos> - You went to jail for that?<eos> - No, not for that.<eos> Since records were a success, we started stealing TVs.<eos> Colour TVs?<eos> Help me with the rug, I can't close the car boot.<eos> What will we do with it?
- I may be going to New York.<eos> - What?<eos> - New York?<eos> - Maybe, maybe.<eos> He wouldn't be safe for a minute up there with all that sin and traffic.<eos> Get off my floor.<eos> He just offered it to me.<eos> Just up and said I could have the job if I wanted it.<eos> You know, I'd just finish working on this play for him.<eos> Go back to New York with it.
The fur coat, the meat, and the wood?<eos> It was you?<eos> I thought I'd help your children.<eos> But as they say, thieves never prosper.<eos> When you build happiness on a lie,<eos> The sand won't hold the water.<eos> You have to pay the price.<eos> And your dreams die.<eos> When you see a young tree die,<eos> You can't but help it.
Not on the charts.<eos> Any planets?<eos> Yeah. Eight, it says here.<eos> Any of 'em any good?<eos> Naah.<eos> What are you gonna name it?<eos> What? - The new star.<eos> What are you gonna name it?<eos> Who cares.<eos> Commander Powell would have named it.
Here I have carried out experiments that science would consider fantastic and, of course, go against all the principles of biology as it is understood today.<eos> What does all this have to do with Loreley?<eos> - You don't see it?<eos> Come with me.<eos> Look.<eos> The chameleon, a prehistoric animal.<eos> Can you tell me what color it is?<eos> Light brown or thereabouts.<eos> Right?<eos> Mimesis allows it to change color at will through a chemical reaction.
Which is stronger?<eos> These boards or your arm?<eos> The boards.<eos> Strike the boards using your arm as a weapon.<eos> Yet the boards resisting do not endure.<eos> Can the weaker be the stronger?<eos> See the way of life as a stream.<eos> A man floats, and his way is smooth.<eos> The same man turning to fight upstream exhausts himself.<eos> To be one with the universe, each must find his true path and follow it.
Can't see a darned thing!<eos> I'll Keep to the wall.<eos> The last fog like this was in '22.<eos> Careful now, stop.<eos> There's a man here!<eos> Well, damn it all.<eos> Gina! Gina!<eos> Where am I?<eos> I don't seem to be anywhere.<eos> If death is like this, I don't think much of it.
It's been transferred, relocated into the mechanism itself.<eos> I can duplicate exact physiological structure.<eos> I cannot duplicate that which is learned.<eos> Just as my predecessor transferred his knowledge to me through this apparatus, I have done that with Mr Spock and the first of his clones.<eos> You talk about creating life with your clones, but you have to murder to do it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Out of my way, mister.<eos> That's an order.<eos> I don't think he understands.<eos> His mind is still trying to assimilate all the knowledge it's been fed.
But rediscovered now at last<eos> Golden helmet of Mambrino<eos> There can be no helm like thee<eos> Thou and I now Ere I die now<eos> Will make golden history<eos> I can hear the cuckoo singing<eos> In the cuckoo berry tree<eos> If he says that that's a helmet I suggest that you agree<eos> But he'll find it is not golden Will not make him bold and brave<eos> Well, at least he'll find it useful If he ever needs a shave
Enough fighting, it's time to go home!<eos> Sergey Pavlovich!<eos> Why are your silent?<eos> Hello, Sima! Hello, Serafima!<eos> Well, everything is all right?<eos> You love her, sincere man.<eos> Goodbye now.<eos> - Allow me to ask you where to?<eos> There'll be a steamboat.<eos> I will go with it. To Russia.
Hello. I wish to register a complaint.<eos> - Hello. Miss?<eos> - What do you mean, "miss"?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I have a cold.<eos> I wish to make a complaint.<eos> Sorry. We're closing for lunch.<eos> Nevermind that, my lad.<eos> I wish to complain about this parrot... what I purchased not half an hour ago from this very boutique.<eos> Oh, yes, the Norwegian blue.<eos> What's wrong with it?
That parrot is definitely deceased, and when I bought it a half hour ago... you assured me that its total lack of movement... was due to it being tired and shagged out after a long squall.<eos> Well, he's pining for the fjords.<eos> Pinin' for the fjords?<eos> What kind of talk is that?<eos> Look, why did it fall flat on its back the minute I got it home?<eos> Well, the Norwegian blue prefers keeping on its back. Beautiful plumage.<eos> Look, I took the liberty of examining that parrot and I discovered... the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place... was that it had been nailed there.<eos> Oh, well, of course it was nailed there.<eos> If I hadn't nailed it there, it would have muscled up to those bars and boom.<eos> Look here mate. This parrot wouldn't boom if you put 4,000 volts through it.
When you get off the plane in Rio, the first thing that hits you is the humidity. You smell a mixture of sea salt, pepper, slight putrefaction, pimento, dust, mangroves,<eos> A fantastic sensation...<eos> I'm gonna explore.<eos> And I'm gonna go back to Brazil.<eos> See you later.<eos> Paul wrote in his notebook:<eos> "The lovely little salamander... 855 01:17:30,320 -- 01:17: "belongs to the lizard family."<eos> "It's black, with yellowish-orange spots."<eos> "The salamander is venomous.<eos> It's the fire's spirit.
When the world gets heavy<eos> Never pit-a-pat 'em<eos> Up and at 'em, boy<eos> Someday, sweet as a song<eos> Charlie's lucky day will come along<eos> Till that day You've got to stay strong, Charlie<eos> Up on top is right where you belong<eos> Look up, Charlie<eos> You'll see a star<eos> Just follow it And keep your dream in view
I think he is a friend of yours.<eos> A friend of mine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> His name is ...<eos> - Señor.<eos> Oh yes, his name is Gary Hamilton.<eos> What's that?<eos> Flocks of birds.<eos> They are fleeing the tornado.<eos> The animals feel it and avoid it.
The Fyffe-Chulmleigh Spoon for Latin Elegaics... goes to... People's Republic of China! Aaaagh!<eos> Good evening, everybody.<eos> My name's Bradshaw Inspector Elizabeth Bradshaw, of the Special Branch Speech Day Squad, but I'd like you to think of me as the Bishop of East Anglia, and I'd like to present the first prize, the Grimwade Gynn Trophy to...<eos> Lady Mayoress, ladies, gentlemen and boys.<eos> Please do not panic.<eos> Please keep your heads right down now, and at the back please keep your heads right down.<eos> Do not panic, don't look round, this building is surrounded.<eos> There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I am the Bishop of East Anglia.<eos> Now the first prize is the Granville Cup for French Unseen Translation... and it goes to Forbes Minor...
So don't tell me how to act. I know how to act.<eos> I know how to act...<eos> Great.<eos> Great, great, everyone.<eos> Lunch now. Lunch.<eos> It's all in the can.<eos> Good morning's work.<eos> But you haven't done a shot.<eos> I'm just keeping morale up.<eos> Now this afternoon, we're gonna shoot the scene where Scott gets off the boat, onto the ice floe and he sees the lion, and he fights it and he kills it and the blood goes:
We also make this kind of bracelet with rubies.<eos> I think a bracelet would be best... for a very young woman.<eos> I must think it over.<eos> At your service, sir.<eos> It all checks out as you said.<eos> The bulletproof glass showcases double as safes.<eos> No need to remove and put back the hundreds of different pieces.<eos> The showcases are opened and closed electronically.<eos> The wall key does exist.<eos> It controls the showcases and the electric eyes that block access to the showroom from the landing.
Shoo!<eos> You can't have it!<eos> We need it more than you do!<eos> Here, dog!<eos> Come here!<eos> That dog should have been on a leash.<eos> There's no excuse for that.<eos> I would've caught him, but couldn't run in your shoes.<eos> - Is your foot all right?<eos> - It's better, but it's not all right.
Colonel Klink...<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Let me explain, so it will be perfectly clear.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> SCHLAGER: I have been entrusted with a highly important mission.<eos> That mission has been accomplished.<eos> The results of it are here in this briefcase. Good, good.<eos> Very good.<eos> I congratulate you.<eos> Now, nothing must happen to it.
The Greek Torches of Remembrance - they had them in Sparta<eos> They've been burning ever since the new employers came<eos> But they're not burning<eos> This is where people are turned to dust<eos> You're not frightened are you, Mili?<eos> Mr. Dvorak<eos> This is the preparation room<eos> This coffin is nailed down because the corpse won't be exhibited<eos> On Monday it will go first to the chapel, then straight to the furnace<eos> It contains the body of a pure-blooded German
What are they gabbling about, Franco?<eos> - Complaining about the jam.<eos> - It won't be the only complaint.<eos> - Keep calm.<eos> - Get off my feet!<eos> Alright!<eos> Get yourselves sorted out and shut up!<eos> No one talks now except me.<eos> Now, now!<eos> Get in front of it!
That book meant a lot to him.<eos> He was desperate.<eos> And then... - Didn't he restart it from scatch?<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> It is said that you never fail twice in row.<eos> Yes, I know.<eos> He is much better now.<eos> He stopped drinking from one day to the other.<eos> He changed his life, took this job.<eos> - Does he like it?
What do you wanna go to Australia for?<eos> Well, it's the last of the frontier country.<eos> I thought I might like to do a little pioneering.<eos> I thought this was frontier country and we was pioneers.<eos> So did I.<eos> To get back to the sheriff's job, if I decided to take it it'd have to be with the understanding that I get enough time off to do the prospecting I came here to do in the first place.<eos> Well, yeah. You ain't said nothing yet about your qualifications for the job?<eos> Oh, don't worry about that.<eos> If I take it, you'll be glad you got me.<eos> Well, it ain't just a question of you taking the job, it's also a question of being able to handle it.
I discovered that the only reason it had been sitting on its perch in the first place was that it had been nailed there.<eos> Of course it was nailed there.<eos> Otherwise it would muscle up to those bars and:<eos> Look, matey this parrot wouldn't "voom" if I put 4000 volts through it.<eos> It's bleeding demised.<eos> It's not, it's pining.<eos> It's not pining, it's passed on.<eos> This parrot is no more.<eos> It has ceased to be.<eos> It's expired and gone to meet its maker.
(BOONE):<eos> Shaka, down. Down!<eos> Down, down. Down, boy.<eos> Down, boy. That's a good boy.<eos> (GROWLING)<eos> Come on, Clarence. Lunchtime.<eos> (GROWLING)<eos> Well, that dog is absolutely fearless.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> Vicious, I'd call it.
No, it was not a pet.<eos> Mama would never allow me to be near animals.<eos> It was an animal.<eos> It was a stuffed animal.<eos> I remember holding it.<eos> It was a stuffed animal.<eos> It was a bear.<eos> Anyone might have known that Celine had a favourite stuffed bear.<eos> When did she get it? Who gave it to her?<eos> What happened to it?
Good night.<eos> Give me the water.<eos> As you know, the real Thomas, Christiansen, and Berkeley... while working for British counterespionage... were responsible for setting up a chain of agents throughout Britain.<eos> Now, if these men are who they claim to be... it would be reasonable... to expect them to be able to write down a list of those agents.<eos> You could then compare their lists with the genuine one...<eos> - which I have in this book.<eos> - There's something very wrong, Colonel.<eos> I don't doubt who Schmidt is, but there has been some mistake.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're the ones who have made it.
- What?<eos> - Enquire.<eos> - What´s your number?<eos> What is it?<eos> - Be careful!<eos> - 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7...<eos> - Quiet!<eos> - ..8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16?<eos> ´Going to escape and come back.<eos> ´Wipe this place off the face of the earth, and you with it.´
A very simple problem, easy to correct.<eos> Then come.<eos> - No.<eos> - Don't be afraid.<eos> I do not fear the punishment of disobedience.<eos> - Well, then come, we must hurry to join...<eos> - No, I cannot go with you.<eos> It is not fear.<eos> I understand the great purpose of the creators.<eos> I shall honour it.
As I suspected, it is not a malfunction.<eos> M-5 was merely shutting down power to areas of the ship that do not require it.<eos> Decks 4 and 6 are living quarters, are they not?<eos> - Yes, that's correct. - And currently unoccupied.<eos> I am not familiar with these instruments, doctor. You are using an entirely new type of control mechanism.<eos> However, it appears to me this unit is drawing more power than before.<eos> Quite right.<eos> As the unit is called upon to do more work, it pulls more power to enable it to do what is required of it, just as the human body draws more energy to run than to stand still.<eos> Doctor, this unit is not a human body.<eos> The computer can process information, but only the information which is put into it.
If he wants to build one, he's got a good reason for it.<eos> Of course he has. He's stir crazy!<eos> Now, I'm ordering you to stand away from the door.<eos> There are five of us and four of you.<eos> Now it's even-- five and five.<eos> What's going on?<eos> We're going to make a break for it.<eos> Not until we build a snowman.<eos> Colonel, I don't care if you are the ranking officer...<eos> And a tunnel underneath it.
You like pigeons?<eos> - I had a pigeon coop when I was a kid.<eos> - You did?<eos> - With this Jewish kid on my block.<eos> - How do you make them come back?<eos> - How do you make them come back?<eos> - Well, you fly them.<eos> - You train them with this stick.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They follow it and come back.
We don't wanna bring the building down.<eos> Place two sonic leads here, two here, and two here.<eos> You're sure that middle one won't cause the storm drain to cave in?<eos> - Quite sure.<eos> - How about the pictures<eos> - of the gas main?<eos> - Over here.<eos> That shouldn't be any problem.<eos> Can you get that truck right up to the elevator shaft?<eos> I can back right up to it.
Interesting?<eos> How would you like to go to sleep and wake up in a new world?<eos> It's out there waiting for you.<eos> We'll need your help to get away.<eos> You've got it.<eos> You think this Companion can do anything.<eos> I said it was very powerful.<eos> - Could it cure her?<eos> - l don't know.<eos> - How do you communicate with it?
Fortunately neither of us is dead, Ensign.<eos> The reverse pressure worked. The vent is closed.<eos> Don't misunderstand my next question.<eos> Mr Spock, why aren't you dead?<eos> It's that green blood of his.<eos> My haemoglobin is based on copper, not iron.<eos> I'll bet he left a bad taste in the creature's mouth.<eos> Colloquially expressed, but essentially correct.<eos> The scent is different. I think I understand something now.<eos> - Are you in communication with it?
- l can't repair warp drive.<eos> - Then get me impulse power.<eos> If we get this hulk moving, maybe we can do something.<eos> - l might coax the impulse engines.<eos> - Then get moving.<eos> Washburn, let's see what we can do about this viewing screen.<eos> I've got to find out what's happening.<eos> No casualties, Mr Spock.<eos> How are we doing?<eos> - We have outrun it, Doctor.
- A machine?<eos> A device?<eos> Something which does these things for him.<eos> My dear, don't we make a graceful pair?<eos> Except for one small detail.<eos> That dress hardly matches this charming scene.<eos> Yes, that's more of what we want.<eos> The dashing warrior and his elegant lady.<eos> That mirror... It's part of his audience, his ego.<eos> He never wanders from it.
One never gets a minute's peace around here.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Making an exhibition of yourself like that!<eos> Most uncivilised.<eos> Orlando, this isn't Oddbod.<eos> Of course it's Oddbod.<eos> I ought to know. I was the one that found his body and brought him back to life.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> It's Oddbod's finger.<eos> This whole thing has been regenerated from it.
Your wife, Professor. Where is she?<eos> She...was the last of her kind.<eos> The last of her kind?<eos> The last of its kind.<eos> Earth history, remember? Like the passenger pigeon.<eos> Or a buffalo.<eos> Oh, I feel strange.<eos> Just stunned.<eos> You'll be able to think in a minute.<eos> The Earth buffalo, what about it?
Beautiful.<eos> I was attracted to her, made love to her... even wrote a sonnet to her.<eos> It was a poor thing.<eos> The words meant nothing because she meant nothing.<eos> Less than nothing.<eos> It left me empty.<eos> After that I prayed.<eos> Yeah, I prayed for understanding.<eos> Maybe God crippled me... with a purpose as he does often.<eos> The bird's weak, He gives it wings.
Nobody would bother your daddy with Wild Bill or Bat Masterson around.<eos> Come on, Jackson.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Who could I get?<eos> - Kid Shelleen.<eos> There really is a Kid Shelleen?<eos> He's real and one of the best, to my way of thinking.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Write him a letter.<eos> I'll mail it.
- Forget my soul.<eos> Not till you remember it.<eos> Go to your knees, ask God to forgive your sins.<eos> Send back your brother's wife.<eos> Now.<eos> Kill me, Herod.<eos> That you can do.<eos> Kill me, so I can live.<eos> Before you leave us, Baptist, it grieves me to ask what you mean by that.<eos> My body's worth nothing, you can do what you like with it.
Adiós, Mamá! - Don't go!<eos> [Alice ] Good-bye, Emily!<eos> Please write to us!<eos> Don't forget to write to us.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> - Cut his tail off. - Why?<eos> - 'Cause he's got gangrene.<eos> - Come on there.<eos> Rotten through and through.<eos> Ifwe don't cut it off, he'll die. Won'tyou, me love?
- Gone to the movies!<eos> Something seems to be stuck here.<eos> Well, open it.<eos> There's no air.<eos> - I'm suffocating!<eos> - I'll go get a screwdriver.<eos> I'm suffocating!<eos> Let me out of here!<eos> I'm sorry, but the cat's going out.<eos> I've got to follow it.
And Tony wanted the walls to know he was in trouble.<eos> He wanted the walls to know he was in trouble.<eos> This wall is a particular friend of his.<eos> I think you'd better get back to the base, captain.<eos> I'll take over.<eos> There's more here than meets the eye.<eos> -Could I have a couple more minutes?<eos> -What for?<eos> Tony asked me to have a talk with his vacuum cleaner.<eos> I'll talk to it.
Ten.<eos> Excuse me just a minute.<eos> All righty. Shall we have a go at it again?<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Has he had it since birth?<eos> Uh, the head?<eos> Oh. Oh, yes. That's the original.<eos> The beard. Oh.<eos> Uh, only since this morning.<eos> His grandfather gave him a frog-leg cocktail yesterday... to make him grow, but it just grew a beard.
You're wasting my time, Goldfinger.<eos> The depository is impregnable.<eos> Look, the joint is bombproof, electrified, lousy with...<eos> Bear with me, please!<eos> Fort Knox is a bank, like any other.<eos> Larger, better-protected perhaps, but, nonetheless, a bank.<eos> It can be, I think the expression is, blown.<eos> My plan is foolproof, gentlemen.<eos> I call it Operation Grand Slam.<eos> I have devoted 1 5 years of my life to it.
- Of course.<eos> In your opinion, there was no doubt as to the cause of death?<eos> Heart failure?<eos> No doubt whatsoever.<eos> How do you account for this?<eos> "I am agonized by pains in my chest.<eos> I am turning to stone."<eos> - May I see that letter?<eos> - Sorry.<eos> My father gave instructions that I was to show it to no one.
Jeepers.<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> - My goodness.<eos> I never thought it'd happen.<eos> You're liable to win this tournament.<eos> Probably.<eos> - And then what?<eos> - And then what?<eos> Then I'll write a new book on how to catch a fish. You know how you do it?<eos> You sit on a log and turn your back to the fish, or climb up a tree and fall on it or drag it up onshore until a bear tells you that's far enough.
Nothing in particular... just something knocked on the door with a cannonball... then tried to get in and eat us.<eos> I'm with Nell.<eos> Miss ESP and Bridey Murphy, some combination.<eos> - There isn't a scratch on the wood.<eos> - Or anywhere else.<eos> How nice, it didn't mar the woodwork.<eos> Where were you, Dr. Markway?<eos> Chasing a dog.<eos> At least, we assumed it was a dog.<eos> We followed it outside.
He was a brave man.<eos> He was a Spartan, my lord.<eos> Demaratus, you were once king of those people.<eos> Tell me, do you really believe that Sparta will fight?<eos> Do you wish for a truthful answer or an agreeable one?<eos> Tell me the truth. I shan't hold it against you.<eos> Sparta will fight, even if the rest submit.<eos> How can they do anything together when they have two kings ruling them?<eos> The one who stole my throne is a usurper, but the other, Leonidas, is a true Spartan king.<eos> His name means "lion", and he lives up to it.
Gonna kill plenty Krauts.<eos> Shoot them all up!<eos> See you later, friend.<eos> Oh, boy!<eos> If you were my son...<eos> Okey-dokey.<eos> Is that right, sir?<eos> Major Winston's jeep?<eos> Right, sir.<eos> We'll certainly be on the lookout for it, sir.
And, uh, here's the message.<eos> You didn't think that'd work twice, did you?<eos> I'll be back, bernie... and i'll keep coming back again and again and i'll get you.<eos> So help me, i'll get you.<eos> Who is he?<eos> It's d... i don't know.<eos> Oh, my dear nathan, you really are smashed, aren't you?<eos> Very careless of you.<eos> As for these, we'll discuss them at some future date.<eos> There's an old saying that goes, "if the shoe fits, wear it,"
Nobody!<eos> Now, go on, break it up.<eos> There isn't a thing here to see. Go on, go on.<eos> Nobody. oh, god... god... mr.<eos> Paul radin, a dealer in fantasy who sits in the rubble of his own making and imagines that he's the last man on earth, doomed to a perdition of unutterable loneliness because a practical joke has turned into a nightmare.<eos> Mr. Paul radin, pallbearer at a funeral that he manufactured himself in the twilight zone.<eos> Rod serling, creator ofthe twilight zone, will tell you about next week's story after this message.<eos> And now, mr. Serling.<eos> Next week, through the good offices of mr. Charles beaumont, we take a walk in some dead man's shoes.<eos> It's the story of a hobo who takes some shoes off a recently-deceased hoodlum, and then discovers that if the shoe fits, you have to wear it.
So what do we have to do?<eos> You and Gisella can stand guard. The others can come into the church! All right!<eos> Walter Bottazzi, do you take Rosetta Grotti to be your lawful wedded wife according to the rite of the Holy Mother Church?<eos> I do.<eos> Grotti Rosetta, do you take Walter Bottazzi to be your lawful wedded husband according to the rite of the Holy Mother Church?<eos> I do.<eos> - Did the witnesses hear?<eos> Give each other your right hands.<eos> [Lt was a beautiful summer's day.]<eos> [The great river flowed lazily through the fields of the Po Valley...] [... and the poplars told it true stories of events that had happened there.]
Must I repeat that?<eos> Yes, but take your time.<eos> There's no rush.<eos> "And atone... by a humble confession, sincere contrition, and true penance."<eos> "Thy kindly spirit will lead me back to the path of truth."<eos> "Lord, thou shalt restore me in thy justice."<eos> Your hands are still pure, aren't they?<eos> No, Father.<eos> Your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit.<eos> You owe it the greatest respect.
Then how does he get away with it?<eos> Ramsey Son has a fine reputation.<eos> The old man ruled with an iron hand. His son doesn't know what's going on.<eos> Then it's time somebody told him!<eos> Miss Templeton, you've only been with us a while.<eos> We've learned to live with Webster.<eos> He's like the common cold:<eos> You know you'll get it once or twice a year.<eos> There are two ways to handle a cold:<eos> You can fight it, or give in and go to bed with it.
The admíral and Commodore Emery are comíng ínto the conference room now.<eos> Les vues, à ce sujet, de notre collègue dístíngué...<eos> Je demande la permíssíon, à M. le présídent, de donner la parole à l'amíral Nelson.<eos> We thank the French delegate for his remarks, and we will take them under advisement.<eos> We acknowledge the arrival of two of the world's most distinguished scientists,<eos> Admiral Nelson and Commodore Emery.<eos> And now, the chair will listen to Admiral Nelson.<eos> Mr Chairman, distinguished scientists, ladies and gentlemen.<eos> This planet is impaled on a roasting spit, slowly but inexorably being seared and blistered by the fire in the sky.<eos> If the Van Allen belt continues to burn, the world will burn with it.
Maybe he didn't have the nerve to come back and face us when he didn't have the nerve to do it.<eos> Not likely. His horse is still here.<eos> I just can't help feeling somehow i got a man killed.<eos> Now, it's full daylight, johnny rob and we can all think with clear heads.<eos> Deep down, we all know that the dead can't really hurt nobody.<eos> Morning!<eos> Good morning, ione.<eos> What are you doing with that plate?<eos> This is his.<eos> He used to eat out of it when he was a little boy.
It wounded me.<eos> Is that better<eos> Not at all.<eos> Then leave!<eos> It was one autumn evening, the moon was full and the air cold.<eos> Don Juan, escaping, climbed a wall and found himself in a cemetery.<eos> He then saw rising the statue of the governor a distinguished man that he had killed in a duel.<eos> Our guest is writing a biography of Don Juan.<eos> Thus...<eos> Seeing this white colossus under the moon, he was taken over by an irresistible feeling of gaiety. He invited it to dinner.
Our best weapon against a young girl.<eos> And the result is<eos> The unfeeling one has returned sick with love!<eos> Curtain, curtain!<eos> It is not finished!<eos> A priest, whom Hell took for a simpleton changes, wakes up, lock up my best demon in its cupboard! In short, it becomes a power upon which we may count.<eos> And that is not all.<eos> A woman of a competence that Hell would not disavow opens her eyes on herself and feels pity for her husband. She will perhaps even become a good wife.<eos> Nor is this all?<eos> As for this dog of Pablo's it defies my will and its punishments.
~ I have no defences ~<eos> ~ My heart is off on wings along with my... ~<eos> The spirit of this song is intimacy, real intimacy.<eos> ~ I'm a setup for... ~<eos> - Put your arms around him. Closer.<eos> - Drape yourself over him.<eos> ~ I'm incurably romantic... ~<eos> Melt together.<eos> Your mouth closer to his cheek.<eos> Kiss it. Just a small one.
If there's a cop, you stay out.<eos> You're getting the little one in hot water.<eos> Why?<eos> -They just detained her!<eos> Tain!<eos> -Tain, tain.<eos> And who has the jewelry?<eos> -The Baldy-Zack zack.<eos> Such a dirty trick!<eos> Come on Hugo, we'll get it back.
Goodbye, Don Miguel.<eos> Take this.<eos> In Paris, the courtyard of the Gonzague town house has become a playground for speculators.<eos> - Another?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I'm selling 1 00 shares. - I'll pay market price.<eos> - I'll pay 1 00 more!<eos> - Agreed.<eos> My hump brings luck, sir!<eos> Signing a transfer on it guarantees good fortune!
1 5 bottles went missing 2 days ago, although there was no wedding!<eos> There'll be no wedding today either.<eos> Not in that dress!<eos> You're marrying!<eos> In blue jeans, in a bikini, in a potatoe sack if it has to be!<eos> I'm sick of your moods.<eos> I want to live my life in peace!<eos> Drivers and cars are ready to start ...<eos> - The car is in top form!<eos> Get the best out of it. - lt starts in 5 minutes, he doesn't have an angel!
It's just that simple.<eos> In the meantime, do we still take George Company off at 1500?<eos> Yes, Carl.<eos> The order stands.<eos> We may lose the hill, but I'm not about to spend any more men for it. Not until I'm assured we don't intend to give it away tomorrow.<eos> I'll... take your wounded down with me.<eos> Joe, uh...<eos> You know when you said to me that this damn hill was worth holding'?<eos> I think I know what you meant.<eos> They say that nothing's got a value, except the value that men put on it.
Lieutenant, we can't reinforce and we have no authority to withdraw you. Out.<eos> That's a hell of a way to run a railroad.<eos> Sir, what's the date today?<eos> It's April 17th.<eos> 40minutesleft<eos> To surrender with honour. 40 minutes.<eos> What are we talking about? What are we arguing about?<eos> You know that this insignificant little hill is of no importance to you or to us.<eos> If we can settle on the truce line to which I thought you had agreed, this hill is in the middle of the neutral zone.<eos> So how can it be worth any man's life?

I can always count on you.<eos> To do what?<eos> The right thing.<eos> Now, about this new wife...<eos> First, about The Tingler.<eos> Is it really so dangerous?<eos> You know...<eos> I felt as though my arm were in one of those hydraulic presses.<eos> Tremendous power.<eos> What are you going to do with it?
The head of the household's identity is enough. This way.<eos> You asked for me, boss?<eos> Lucas is with Maurin, singing the song.<eos> Go relieve him for the second verse.<eos> - If your wife is waiting, let her know.<eos> - Will it be long? Because...<eos> - she was making a soufflé.<eos> - Ah, it's liable to fall back down.<eos> This chair's a little worn out.<eos> It's like me.
But you've read and experienced enough to know that this unholy cult must be wiped out.<eos> - I hope that you will help me.<eos> - I'll do anything you say.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course, we do know certain things.<eos> You witnessed one a little while ago.<eos> And we also know that during the day the vampire must rest in his native soil.<eos> When I went to Castle Dracula, a hearse came tearing through the gates.<eos> In that hearse was a coffin.<eos> I believe it contained Dracula and a bed of his own earth.
It's for detecting blood.<eos> We found blood on your pants. - It is girl's blood.<eos> - Because I tripped over her body!<eos> - It was terrible.<eos> - Why didn't you tell us that?<eos> And then you ran into the village to notify us.<eos> Yes, commissioner. About 80 m from the crime scene your basket got stuck into a blackthorn bush.<eos> Yes.<eos> The strange thing is, that the blackthorn lies in the opposite direction.<eos> We've found one of your combs in it.
As Colonel's orderly, only I can disturb Colonel.<eos> Wait.<eos> Excuse me, Colonel, but I...<eos> See?<eos> I told you.<eos> Colonel does not like to be interrupted in the middle of campaign.<eos> Oh, my poor darling.<eos> This awful war...<eos> It is not war that is awful.<eos> It's being out of it that is disgusting.
If you do not sleep, you might become unclear in the head.<eos> Rest now, old man.<eos> Let him do the work.<eos> Until it is time... ... for your next journey. "<eos> He lay forward, cramping himself against the line with his body... ... putting all his weight on his left hand, and he was asleep.<eos> He did not dream of the lions, but instead, of a vast school of porpoises... ... that stretched for eight or 10 miles, and it was in the time of their mating.<eos> And they would leap high into the air... ... and return in the same hole they made in the water when they leaped.<eos> Then he dreamed he was in the village, on his bed.<eos> And there was a norther, and he was very cold.<eos> And his arm was asleep because his head had rested on it instead of a pillow.
Besides, I have to see a man about a horse and a half million lire.<eos> - What?<eos> - The canvas has come loose.<eos> I'd better stop then.<eos> You know, it occurs to me that our friend is perhaps a mutation but of what species, I do not know.<eos> Now, here, you catch this on the other side.<eos> There's also the possibility that it might be a type of throwback toward the prehistoric and unknown.<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I guess I frightened it as much as it frightened me.
Excellent.<eos> Has someone died in the castle?<eos> - Where's your mistress?<eos> - In a coffin.<eos> What did she die of?<eos> Of love for you, knight.<eos> Forgive me, O beautiful Altisidora!<eos> I wasn't aware that you've honoured me with love of such a great passion.<eos> It's a pity that I cannot challenge death to a duel.<eos> I would have gladly fought with it and forced it to correct this cruel injustice.
Why didn't I catch this sooner?<eos> Come on, now climb outta this stuff before we get too heavy.<eos> You're stalling.<eos> You're stalling!<eos> Now turn around. Get out of here.<eos> Get back to warmer air.<eos> There it is, ice smothering the carburetor.<eos> Burn it out.<eos> Backfire it out!<eos> Blast the guts out of it!
Welcome to Altair-4, gentlemen.<eos> I am to transport you to the residence.<eos> If you do not speak English I am at your disposal with 187 other languages along with their various dialects and sub-tongues.<eos> Colloquial English will do fine, thank you.<eos> This is no offense, but you are a robot, aren't you?<eos> That is correct, sir.<eos> For your convenience, I am monitored to respond to the name "Robby."<eos> Nice climate you have here.<eos> High oxygen content.<eos> I rarely use it myself, sir.
We're running on!<eos> Jump, my hearties! Jump now!<eos> Where are the crew of the Pequod?<eos> There is not one face I know among 30.<eos> He has snatched their souls.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They are gloves.<eos> Ahab fills them. Ahab moves them.<eos> You must admit, Mr. Starbuck, he called that typhoon's bluff.<eos> Stood toe-to-toe with the bully, traded blows with it till it hollered, "Help! "
So let it be written, so let it be done.<eos> So speaks Rameses I.<eos> No!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> God of Abraham, take my child into thy hands, that he may live to thy service.<eos> But Mother, we have not even given him a name.<eos> God will give him a name.<eos> Follow it, Miriam.
I'm going to stay at the professor's.<eos> You see, it's all part of my contract.<eos> I'll be laboratory technician, cook, student.<eos> The whole works.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, it's one way of earning a master's.<eos> And it's worth it working with people like Deemer and Prof. Jacobs.<eos> - How well did you know Eric Jacobs?<eos> - I've never met him.<eos> He just read the paper and liked it, and that was that.
You must excuse me, dear, I'm feeling, feeling rather poorly.<eos> Sire, the ceremony is ready.<eos> I must go now, my dear, and so must, so must you.<eos> Quickly.<eos> Dear, don't touch anything.<eos> Where's the Jester?<eos> Get the key?<eos> Yes, here it is.<eos> It must be sent by pigeon to The Black Fox at once.<eos> Let the Jester take it and escape.
I remember now.<eos> He was sitting in the restaurant.<eos> -Was that where you left your bag?<eos> -Yes and didn't I say something about, "There's someone from college"?<eos> -I don't remember.<eos> -That's how he got in.<eos> He made a duplicate and returned the original to the bag.<eos> Before you go any further with this, how did he get in through the street door?<eos> -The street door is never locked.<eos> Well, he could have had your key copied. And he could have used it to open the door.
Because I told you the same thing 25 years ago.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> Cheers, Johannes.<eos> - Cheers, Robert.<eos> Afterwards, they wandered through the old streets.<eos> It was a stroll through a thousand memories.<eos> The post box is still there.<eos> - It'll outlive us.<eos> It has an iron constitution.<eos> - Would you swap places with it?
You must be on the lonesome side.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> You ever think of getting a parrot?<eos> A what?<eos> That would be nice company.<eos> Somebody to talk to.<eos> I mean, something.<eos> And, of course, there's lots of parrots can talk.<eos> So then you could be talking to it, and it could be talking to you, and...
Probably a rectifier or a tube.<eos> Please call Jud, and ask him to fix it before you wreck it?<eos> Wreck it!<eos> Now you listen here, I built a television transmitter in '38, before you even knew what television was.<eos> Yes, but did it work?<eos> I don't know, I never finished the receiver.<eos> Well, this is one, and I wish you'd call Jud.<eos> I don't wanna'.<eos> Besides it costs more on Saturdays.<eos> It's cheaper than what it'd cost, when you're finished with it.
- Just the waves. - Why?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Because I was down by the lagoon and I thought I heard the engines of a big boat.<eos> Then it whistled.<eos> By the time I climbed up to see...<eos> - There was nothing there.<eos> - That's because it had gone.<eos> - What had gone?<eos> You mean to tell me that you saw a boat and didn't let us know?<eos> I saw and I waved to it but it didn't wave back, so I...
What is your verdict upon this man?<eos> He shall restore the lamb seven-fold.<eos> The lamb is dead, it cannot be restored.<eos> Then the man deserves to die because he had no pity.<eos> You are the man.<eos> You have made me pronounce sentence upon myself.<eos> Very well.<eos> It is done.<eos> Then there is no appeal.<eos> It is the will of God, and I accept it.
- Yes, a little. Good.<eos> Now, I want you to take these coats... and sew as many of those jewels as you can into the linings, and do it quickly as possible.<eos> - Did you find a way to get away from here?<eos> - Yes, I have.<eos> You know, I thought our friend last night was pointing at something.<eos> So I took a look around.<eos> Now, there was a door that was heavily barred before.<eos> Now I could open it.<eos> There was a room behind and a passage leading to the river.<eos> I followed it.
- Most constantly.<eos> - I would I had been there.<eos> - It would have much amazed you.<eos> Very like. Very like.<eos> Stayed it long?<eos> While one with moderate haste might tell 100.<eos> - Longer.<eos> - Not when I saw it.<eos> - His beard was grizzled, no?<eos> - It was as I have seen it in his life, a sable silvered.
Even my car.<eos> It's bright orange.<eos> And my favorite gem is orange.<eos> Mexican opal.<eos> I had a friend once who was as crazy about fire opals as I am.<eos> I gave somebody a fire opal once.<eos> It had flaws in it.<eos> What is it?<eos> The suit?<eos> Remember the night you followed it?
It's the impression left by the pressure of a pencil.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> "125 Prospect Terrace."<eos> A phone call at 4:30 in the morning must be pretty urgent.<eos> I have a hunch our headstrong heroine will be along soon.<eos> Sometimes I even amaze myself.<eos> - Follow that car?<eos> - Movie fan.<eos> Yes.<eos> Follow it.
But it doesn't matter.<eos> All that matters is that you have the concerto and he gave it to you.<eos> And you must think of nothing else but playing it wonderfully.<eos> - You really think I can?<eos> - Of course, darling.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> You shall.<eos> Now, tell me, how are you going to work?<eos> Well, he suggested I should plug away alone for the rest of this week and next.<eos> And then we are to meet for dinner and afterwards I'm to play it.
Now, drive on.<eos> We'll camp beyond those trees.<eos> - What have you got here?<eos> - A chamber of horrors.<eos> The burgomaster won't grant you a permit, so be on your way. But why?<eos> There's nothing in my exhibit to offend anyone.<eos> We've had enough horrors around here.<eos> Do you see those ruins?<eos> Our village has been peaceful since the dam broke, sweeping the Wolf Man and Frankenstein's monster away some years ago.<eos> No one ever mentions that place or ever goes near it.
He's got fallen arches. Keeps him outta the draft, but not outta Roseland.<eos> Kovac, you know something about machinery, don't you?<eos> - A little. - See if you can fix this clasp.<eos> Mrs Porter, I've read a lot of your stuff.<eos> You wanna know what's the matter with it?<eos> No, do tell me.<eos> You've been all over the world. You've met all kinds of people.<eos> But you never write about them, you only write about yourself.<eos> You think this whole war's a show put on for you to cover, like a Broadway play.<eos> And if enough people die before the last act, maybe you might give it four stars.
Is that your handwriting?<eos> Look carefully.<eos> Why no the doctor is mine - but the rest is changed.<eos> - Shh. Quiet.<eos> Oh, rest my soul it's a forgery.<eos> Ink eradicator has been used and another name written in.<eos> Think carefully.<eos> Can you remember the name of the doctor that you wrote here?<eos> Oh, dear me, I'm poor at names you know?<eos> This is very much like it.
Icy floods of the majestic glaciers fall into this tropical world.<eos> Eastern floods ravage while Southern winds carry the evaporating water from the Indian Ocean toward overlying rocks, where it cools down and falls as a rain into the valley.<eos> This is the dreaded monsoon, the big rain, throughout the evening and night downpours rush toward the earth, every single drop turns into a wild river and drags cliff debris as well as entire mountain sides along into the deep.<eos> Amidst the uproar of nature our pack animals kept walking unperturbed.<eos> With bloated nostrils, their eyes close to surrender, they diligently consider each single step.<eos> A monsoon shattered a bridge again.<eos> Quickly our carriers begin to work.<eos> They're Lepchas, shy jungle inhabitants of the dark mountain woods that surround the Himalayas.<eos> Their only tool is a knife, their building material is the bamboo of the forest.<eos> With it they tie the trunks for the bridge together.
During the toughest part of our journey we encounter one of the many treacherous swamps in the area.<eos> The animals' hooves sink into the black, gurgling swamp.<eos> We need to aggressively propel them forward, because otherwise they would meet a cruel death in the swamp.<eos> The swamp desert troubles us throughout the entire day.<eos> Then the night falls and we are forced to pitch an emergency settlement.<eos> With an empty stomach and wet clothes which are encrusted with mud and gunge we spend a bitterly cold night.<eos> Fresh-fallen snow covers the plain and makes it shimmer and shine in the light of the early morning.<eos> The warm early light encourages the mouse rabbits to leave their subterranean dens.<eos> And the snowfinch also appears.<eos> It uses the den of the mouse rabbit as a hatchery and a temporary home.
What with your matron from the SÃ"retÃ© in her dressing room and that sphinx-like fellow of yours waiting to escort her to the stage, she feels quite important.<eos> Madame Lorenzi, I trust you're entirely composed.<eos> Composed?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why not?<eos> Maestro.<eos> The piano has just been tuned, Maestro.<eos> And when do we introduce the concerto?<eos> Probably after the opera.<eos> Inspector Daubert has a plan of his own, and we must give it every chance.
I'll do that.<eos> Sure, you will.<eos> Father Connelly, I'd like to help you. I really would.<eos> But we can't get away with it.<eos> The organization is too powerful to fight.<eos> You know what you're asking of me?<eos> Yes, Mr. White.<eos> The other papers have gone to great lengths to explain the risks to me.<eos> You'll go into the fight personally?<eos> Devote your full time to it?
We've got to get through the town to get to the boat.<eos> Wait here, lads.<eos> It's me.<eos> Mr. Nuttall.<eos> You came close to being the ex-Mr. Nuttall.<eos> Wouldn't be the first death I died today.<eos> We can't stay here waiting for them to catch sight of us.<eos> Let's get to the boat down this way.<eos> Sunk to the bottom of the briny.<eos> And it sunk our hopes with it.
Cartwright!<eos> THORNDYKE:<eos> His feet.<eos> ORDERLY:<eos> Got him.<eos> [Cartwright gasping]<eos> THORNDYKE:<eos> Take him back to his room.<eos> Give him a sedative.<eos> Make it a big one.
Don't worry, Braddock, you'll get over it just like I did.<eos> Tend to the horses, Mr. Montgomery.<eos> This...<eos> This creature, what is it?<eos> See for yourself, Mr. Braddock.<eos> It's a bear, is it not?<eos> Bear?<eos> It's not possible.<eos> Well, whatever it is, it's in pain.<eos> What have you done to it?
Thanks.<eos> Are you alright, sir?<eos> I'm not used to drinking tea.<eos> Then have some wine. -Do you have any? -Yes.<eos> Great.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> I'll give you the package.<eos> Please let me go.<eos> What's inside the package?<eos> Why are so many after it?
And I've been thinking of doing some redecorating, myself.<eos> Can't imagine your place being any different.<eos> It always seemed just perfect to me.<eos> Get a few dollars ahead, I'd like to modernize it a little.<eos> Tell you what I'm gonna do, if you don't mind.<eos> I'll lend you Corabeth.<eos> - Elizabeth, I got you another butterfly.<eos> - I don't want it.<eos> Well, I thought you'd like it.<eos> Please, Jim-Bob, let it go before anything happens to it.
Listen, I'm rich.<eos> Family money.<eos> Please accept this.<eos> For me it s nothing.<eos> I think it s a lot for you.<eos> I don't want your dough.<eos> I'm very fond of Nadine.<eos> You're mad. No.<eos> Rich.<eos> Philosophically speaking, if you don't count St. Thomas Aquinas the medieval period was a catastrophe but we owe it a certain conception
When do you start?<eos> On the 14th.<eos> - Coffee with... - With rum.<eos> Yes and with... but without.<eos> You know what the lousiest thing is?<eos> The most disgusting?<eos> No.<eos> Pity.<eos> Why?<eos> Because it's terminal.
You are not gonna have a summer unless you deal with this problem.<eos> We have to close the beaches, and hire somebody to kill the shark!<eos> We have to tell the Coast Guard.<eos> You'll have to contact the Shark Research Panel.<eos> You'll have to ring this entire harbor.<eos> I don't think either one of you are familiar with our problems.<eos> I know that you are going to ignore this problem until it swims up and bites you on the ass!<eos> Wait a second.<eos> There are two ways to deal with this.<eos> You're either gonna kill this animal, or cut off it's food supply.
Now, if you were perfect, you'd walk on water and leave me behind.<eos> Mama.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Doc Mclvers is here.<eos> He wants to see you both.<eos> I had a thought after you left the office.<eos> And it may be something you're not interested in at all, then again you might.<eos> Elizabeth.<eos> What would you think of taking in a baby for a while?<eos> Giving it a foster home.
That's really great.<eos> You don't mind the story not being printed?<eos> Oh, no, that's all right.<eos> I mean, I enjoyed writing it, but I can call Mr. Fletcher and he can cancel it.<eos> I mean, that's not the important thing.<eos> The important thing is that you're not gonna take chances like that anymore.<eos> I mean, Rex can still do his crazy stunts.<eos> I've never felt like this before a stunt, but then I never had so much to lose before.<eos> I'm glad we're having this talk.<eos> I kind of feel like I've been avoiding it
Do I hear five kikes?<eos> I got five kikes.<eos> Do I hear six spics?<eos> Six spics.<eos> Do I hear seven niggers?<eos> I got seven niggers.<eos> Sold American!<eos> I'll pass with seven niggers, six spics, five Micks, four kikes, three guineas, and one wop.<eos> You almost punched me out, didn't ya?<eos> I was trying to make a point, that it's the suppression of the word that gives it the power, the violence, the viciousness.
What did they do to you?<eos> Coward!<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> - Give me the gun.<eos> Will the put you in Put you after all those tricks?<eos> Quick!<eos> Quick,they're swindling us!<eos> What need was there to kill them?<eos> You talk and talk, but it's you who gives importance to money.<eos> Of course I give it importance, but it's negative.
Is that right?<eos> That's right.<eos> So that's what's been the matter with me.<eos> Now, you go on back in and you get some sleep, and you'll see him in the morning.<eos> Okay, if that's what he said.<eos> Well, that's what he said.<eos> Thanks for telling me about him.<eos> And the part about the baby, too.<eos> A baby.<eos> I sure hope it isn't as sick in there as I've been out here.
I accept.<eos> Master Itto Ogami?<eos> So you do have weaknesses?<eos> There was a high dose of poison mixed into the tea.<eos> We wanted to test every aspect of your skills.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I, Kanbe Sazareishi from the Kuroda-Klan, will kill you!<eos> Please, kill Wajo Jikei and save the document!<eos> He keeps the document in his Sutra- Role-Container. Nobody except him is allowed.<eos> to touch it.
Was the deer afraid of you?<eos> It was a deer.<eos> I don't know what a deer thinks.<eos> You know.<eos> Let's get some more of them berries.<eos> -Good. I could find stuff like this.<eos> -You can do many things.<eos> But I don't know nothing.<eos> The deer was afraid.<eos> Yet the deer knew you came to help it.
Then you force me to do it<eos> You shall be nourishment for the primordial<eos> It's restless.<eos> It needs food Gotho, it needs food!<eos> That scream, in the underground chambers, it's a woman<eos> Go get her Gotho.<eos> Go get her!<eos> Gotho, you wretch!<eos> Where has that disgusting ape gone?<eos> The creature is hungry and if we don't feed it it will destroy us all
Now, Cleo, don't make anything worse.<eos> This isn't exactly your jurisdiction.<eos> My jurisdiction extends from Ankara, Turkey to Watts Tower, baby.<eos> What will happen with the BS House?<eos> The DA is putting padlocks on the works.<eos> On the house, the store and the other small businesses.<eos> He's giving them 72 hours to close up.<eos> Tell the DA to back off.<eos> He did find that stuff on Jimmy Beekers.<eos> I say they planted it.
Most likely, he's trying to get his old bunch together again.<eos> - Which way we going?<eos> - I'm going southwest.<eos> That would be the Chisum ranch.<eos> Chisum is a fine man.<eos> Country's gotta make a choice.<eos> Time's over for drifters and outlaws and those who got no backbone.<eos> I'm gonna tell you this once.<eos> I don't wanna have to say it again.<eos> This country's getting old, I aim to get old with it.
If I leave, she'll kill him.<eos> But I can't keep my eye on her all the time.<eos> Do you know my place, son?<eos> At Hatchobori?<eos> That's right.<eos> Go there and tell them I said to bring Dr. Inamura here.<eos> Does he bleed when he has a bowel movement?<eos> Yes, for a long time.<eos> I used an imported sedative, so he's not in pain now.<eos> The pain will come back, but I can use it only once.
She was kept in this weekend<eos> What did she do?<eos> Made a noise in prayers<eos> I thought she was a model pupil<eos> Exactly!<eos> She's always managed to get away with it<eos> But she's your friend<eos> It's what she deserved. Always sucking up to the teachers<eos> Anne, leave the poor thing alone.<eos> You're hurting it
I've been on the scaffolding almost all night.<eos> I can't close my hands.<eos> They're formed to the shape of the scaffolding.<eos> You people that are hanging on that scaffolding, you're rendering that scaffold unsafe by climbing on it.<eos> Those scaffoldings are not built to take very heavy weight.<eos> So if we could have some sort of reason, whatever that might be, we'd be very pleased.<eos> Arthur, in between moving around, always turn that off.<eos> Turn it off and turn it on.<eos> Look, you've got to be very cool with that little thing.<eos> Even though it's supposed to be electrically correct, man, you got to really think right around it.
They don't even taste like potato pancakes.<eos> Tunneling into jail?<eos> Anybody can tunnel out of jail.<eos> Amazing.<eos> A Frenchman who knows how to make our pancakes.<eos> If you wanted to, you could be a German.<eos> Mmm. Maybe in the next war.<eos> How do you like our little motel?<eos> Charming.<eos> Yeah, the guidebook gives it four stars with a skull and crossbones.
Come on, lass!<eos> Kes!<eos> Kes!<eos> Come on, Kes!<eos> Kes!<eos> Kes!<eos> - Where is it? What's tha done wi' it?<eos> - Where've you been?<eos> Your tea's cold.<eos> I said, where is it?
I need a rest now.<eos> What are you thinking about, Nikolo?<eos> Have a drink, and that'll be it.<eos> How much vodka am I supposed to drink in this life?<eos> Shall I drink it slower and be slaving longer, or drink it all in one take and thus bring my end closer?<eos> I can't decide what's better.<eos> Drink up, Niko.<eos> Drink and don't think about it.<eos> Our whole life is a motley river.<eos> One ought to go in step with it, uphill or downhill.
Oh, he is vindictive.<eos> I made away with his little friend and he doesn't like it, though he deserves all he gets - the assassin, the night prowler!<eos> Like a bird of prey, he strikes.<eos> Encolpio, the thief, grabbing at all that glitters.<eos> While he slept, I dragged Gitone from under him and slid into him myself.<eos> Such is friendship - very accommodating.<eos> Sweet and sullen.<eos> At first, the boy would not have me pick his flower.<eos> Maybe he was sleepy.<eos> But I drew my other sword and showed it, saying:
Now, unsealed, it would have had detrimental effects on everybody here.<eos> Incredible.<eos> Zenite is shipped all over the galaxy wherever there is danger of plant bacteria.<eos> - No side effects have ever been reported.<eos> - There are none after it's refined.<eos> But in its raw state, it emits a odourless, invisible gas that retards the intellectual functioning of the mind and heightens the emotion.<eos> Therefore, it releases a violent reaction.<eos> And the mines are full of that gas.<eos> That's right.<eos> And the Troglytes are constantly exposed to it.
Captain, if you are apprehended deliberately violating the high advisor's orders, he will be within his rights to have you executed if he chooses.<eos> If you're about to suggest that you contact Vanna, the answer's negative, Spock.<eos> Allow me to point out that a first officer is more expendable than either a doctor or a captain.<eos> Officially yes, but this mission is strictly unofficial.<eos> Nobody's to have any part in it, any responsibility for it, but myself.<eos> That's an order, Spock.<eos> You have the Conn.<eos> Stand by till I contact you.<eos> Vanna. I've brought you a gift.<eos> There's a dangerous gas in the mines that affects the development of the Troglytes exposed to it for a period of time.
There should be a pin spot on my face.<eos> Once upon a time, many, many years ago, a rich merchant in Baghdad sent his servant to the marketplace.<eos> After a while, the servant came back, white-faced and trembling, and said,<eos> "Master, when I was in the market, I was jostled by a woman."<eos> "l turned to look, and I saw that it was Death that had jostled me."<eos> "She looked at me and made a threatening gesture."<eos> "Master, please lend me your horse," "that I may ride away from this city and escape my fate."<eos> "l will ride to Samarra, and Death will not find me there."<eos> The merchant loaned him the horse.<eos> The servant mounted it and dug his spurs into its flank.
Come on, Pepe. She's real racy!<eos> All those here have boyfriends or are married... They know...<eos> Remember what happened if our husbands caught us in a thing like this?<eos> - They'd cut a limb from us...<eos> - They would...<eos> - You know how it was...<eos> - We lost our bun...<eos> My divine guajira guantanamera.<eos> Guantanamera, guajira guantanamera.<eos> The countryside is the source of unsurmountable wealth and of unmeasurable beauty of spiritual rest men and women alike have the duty to tend it and extract their products with skill and obtain the benefits we want from it
You may go.<eos> - Anything? - I've located their power source captain.<eos> It's installed in Engineering.<eos> We're just going to jam it.<eos> I've tied in all the lab computers. That'll give it a bit more power to push with.<eos> This is it. Now all we have to do...<eos> Whatever it is we must do, it is impossible.<eos> Why?<eos> This material surrounding the projector is the same as I discovered on the planet.<eos> Readings indicate it is impervious to any of our weapons.
And soon.<eos> Or we're a doomed ship, travelling forever between galaxies, filled with eternal bloodlust, eternal warfare.<eos> Kang has got to listen.<eos> We've got to pool our knowledge and get rid of this thing.<eos> Kang.<eos> Kang, this is Captain Kirk. Kang, do you read me?<eos> Commander, it's a trick.<eos> He won't answer.<eos> The alien is affecting his mind, captain.<eos> Soon, it will become so powerful that none of us will be able to resist it.
(LEOPARD SCREAMS)<eos> (JUDY HOOTS)<eos> There's a leopard after Paula.<eos> - (JUDY HOOTS) - (LEOPARD ROARS)<eos> Judy, in the cage, quick! Get in the cage!<eos> Judy! You saved my life.<eos> Don't be embarrassed.<eos> You deserve every nice thing anyone can say.<eos> Jack, that leopard cub is out in the bush all alone.<eos> Anything could happen to it.
Women's work.<eos> Come on, Judy.<eos> Okay, Judy, hold the bag open.<eos> Come on.<eos> There we go.<eos> Come on, Judy.<eos> Judy, get in the front seat.<eos> Judy, we're not making a mistake, are we?<eos> [GIBBERING]<eos> If that lioness won't feed its cub it certainly couldn't mind if we gave it a good home.
- Either way. - And then you came here with him.<eos> Marvellous.<eos> Oh, darling, however did you figure all that out?<eos> My dear, I'm a psychiatrist.<eos> Amanda.<eos> But what I must learn is why this bottle means so much to Major Nelson.<eos> - Well, sir, as I was saying-<eos> - No, no, no. The truth, Major Healey.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You see, we had the two bottles, and we tried to give it to- - This is Nelson here.
- Where, where?<eos> I thought I had seen a policeman.<eos> No, friend, there is none.<eos> Now who will save the portfolio?<eos> I...<eos> I will keep it.<eos> Damn!<eos> Damn!<eos> I do not know, it was almost 30 minutes.<eos> I think we should go get it.
You say you were brought here 150 years ago?<eos> You don't look over 35.<eos> I haven't aged.<eos> The Companion sees to that.<eos> These instruments date from the time indicated.<eos> - From your ship?<eos> - l cannibalised it.<eos> The food, water, gardens, the Companion gives me.<eos> It creates it out of the native elements.<eos> You say you can communicate with it.
I agree completely.<eos> Unfortunately, you're both right.<eos> It's the only thing we can do.<eos> All right, Mr. Spock.<eos> Mr. Spock's the best first officer in the fleet.<eos> Proceed.<eos> Completed.<eos> Spock, are you all right?<eos> The creature within me is gone.<eos> I am free of it and the pain.
- What is Spock doing?<eos> - lt's wounded. Badly.<eos> Help it.<eos> - Help that?<eos> - Go take a look.<eos> The end of life...<eos> Murderers...<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> That thing is virtually made out of stone.<eos> Help it.
I have investigated it.<eos> To correct the fault will require an overhaul of the system.<eos> Three weeks at a starbase.<eos> I wouldn't mind so much if only it didn't get so...affectionate.<eos> It also has an unfortunate tendency to giggle.<eos> I take it a lady computer is not routine.<eos> We put it in to Cygnet xiv for maintenance.<eos> Cygnet xiv is a planet dominated by women.<eos> They felt the computer system lacked a personality.<eos> They gave it one.
Man your post, Sulu.<eos> If any of the other systems go out, switch to manual override.<eos> And above all, don't be afraid.<eos> With an arm full of this stuff, I wouldn't be afraid of a supernova.<eos> - Ready.<eos> - Implement.<eos> Computer, this is a Class A compulsory directive.<eos> Compute to the last digit the value of pi.<eos> As we know, the value of pi is a transcendental figure without resolution.<eos> The computer banks will work on this problem to the exclusion of all else, until we order it to stop.
I'm not cut out for this kind of life like you are.<eos> You actually risked your life on that horse to save a few cows.<eos> I can understand why my father gave you that corridor.<eos> He didn't give it to me, Nicky.<eos> He gave it back.<eos> He gave it back to the animals.<eos> After all, they were here first.<eos> Well, thank you, dear.<eos> Everything worked.<eos> Yes, I'm, uh, afraid little Nicky inherited the land but not the love for it.
Then what need is there of haste?<eos> Shall we not do it little by little under cover of night?<eos> He demandeth every hour of the day.<eos> In our obedience must be no delay.<eos> Will you question your father's understanding or doubt his ways?<eos> You should be ashamed.<eos> Yet when shall they be rid of the work?<eos> All things wait for this.<eos> The ground is unsown, and the house is unmended.<eos> Give me one to make the roof good lest when the rain comes the house will not keep it out.
Lots of practical jokes, and always on me.<eos> My own personal devil. A guy by the name of Finnegan.<eos> - And you being serious...<eos> - Serious?<eos> I was absolutely grim, which delighted Finnegan no end.<eos> He'd put a bowl of soup in your bed or a bucket of water on a half-open door. You never knew where he'd strike next.<eos> More tracks.<eos> Looks like your rabbit came from over there.<eos> A girl's footprints.<eos> The young blonde girl I saw chasing it.
Oh, Doctor, they're lovely!<eos> Look at me, Doctor! A lady to be protected and fought for.<eos> A princess of the blood royale.<eos> You are all of those things.<eos> And many more.<eos> They'll look even lovelier with you wearing them.<eos> Doctor...<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> I don't know how or why, but the dress is here.<eos> I'd like to see you in it.
Maybe we'd better have a word with him about not saying anything to the others.<eos> I don't know why you keep humoring him like that.<eos> If the thing can't fly, it can't fly. That's all there is to it.<eos> Anything missing?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I'm arranging the harness attachments.<eos> You'll be lucky if these guys can walk tomorrow, let alone pull this thing.<eos> Nevertheless, it will have to be done.<eos> The propeller itself will provide the basic impetus.<eos> The men will mainly be to give it direction.
How could I have been so blind as not to know that stone was sent from the other side by the hand of Corbin, reaching out from beyond the grave?<eos> - A curse?<eos> - What do you know of this house?<eos> - Or the people who've lived in it?<eos> - The stone was not sent by anyone.<eos> It's easy for you to say that, but you didn't see it that Sunday morning, screaming out of the heavens to crash and bury itself in the heath.<eos> It fell from the sky!<eos> Then it was a meteorite.<eos> I thought it was a gift from Heaven.<eos> The people from the village came to see, but they wouldn't come near it.
Now, stop.<eos> Wherever you are, stay there.<eos> Hello, Dr. Bellows.<eos> Captain Nelson, you and I have a lot to talk about.<eos> - Sir?<eos> - That car has no driver.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> Well, thank heavens no one was hurt.<eos> Just by talking to it, you brought that vehicle to a stop.
She must be.<eos> She's certainly worse than when I last wrote you, but not to the extent of being committed.<eos> I'm sorry. There's just no way to avoid the problem.<eos> There are times when she genuinely doesn't know what she's saying, but...<eos> On the other hand, I thought she described the way you left me rather accurately.<eos> If it's any comfort, I've always regretted having let you go.<eos> We don't have time for regrets now, Drew.<eos> And there is a lot to regret.<eos> What a shame.<eos> With all that money, she could have done such wonderful things with this place. Made it so beautiful again.
I was the liar.<eos> You're tormented by the idea of women.<eos> I have no power over them.<eos> That's a laugh.<eos> I was handsome at 20.<eos> They still find me fun and nice.<eos> But it's not enough.<eos> I have no hold on them.<eos> And yet, it's only through women that I've felt some hold on life.<eos> It's not life itself I blame, but what's contemptible in it.
What a glorious theme!<eos> Listen to me carefully.<eos> I don't know how many years will go by, but in Caperna a legend will come to flower...<eos> That will be remembered a long time.<eos> You will be grown, Assol.<eos> Yes, you will be grown.<eos> And one day, far out to sea, the sun will shine upon a white ship with scarlet sails.<eos> The white ship will slice through the waves and move right toward you.<eos> The miracle ship will sail silently, without shouts or shots, amidst the sounds of beautiful music.<eos> The ship will approach majestically, and a fast skiff, gilded and decorated with flowers will come from it.
Not after today.<eos> I'm taking her to Boston with me.<eos> I see.<eos> (RUMBLING)<eos> How long has that been going on?<eos> So long I'm hardly aware of it anymore.<eos> It's just the settling of the house.<eos> PHILIP: It can cause this entire structure to collapse.<eos> And that doesn't worry you?<eos> Oh, no, sir. If the house dies, I shall die with it.
Mr Usher, I don't see that this has anything to do with Madeline and myself.<eos> I don't believe in the sins of the fathers being visited upon the children.<eos> You do not, sir?<eos> The House of Usher seems to you, then, normal?<eos> The house, sir, is neither normal nor abnormal.<eos> It is only a house.<eos> You are very wrong, Mr Winthrop.<eos> This house is centuries old.<eos> It was brought here from England.<eos> And with it every evil rooted in its stones.
(SCREAMS)<eos> (THUNDERCLAP)<eos> (DOOR OPENS)<eos> Still here?<eos> I suggest you leave, Mr Winthrop.<eos> No?<eos> Then perish with us.<eos> (THUNDERCLAP)<eos> The old house crumbles.<eos> Perhaps this storm will finish it.
Get away from me.<eos> Call it.<eos> - Britt.<eos> - Chris.<eos> Can I have a word with you?<eos> Did you have any luck?<eos> Found a man who would have been perfect.<eos> Gun or knife, you couldn't want any better.<eos> Wasn't interested.<eos> The money? It wasn't enough?
We marched on their capital.<eos> Barbaric city, but fascinating.<eos> Or was, till we destroyed it.<eos> Now it's nothing but ashes.<eos> I'm boring you with soldier stories.<eos> Come with me, there's something I want to show you.<eos> Thank you for this.<eos> I chose the right present for you.<eos> It's a brooch for a woman.<eos> What do you think of it?
The smart one knows, and nothing in the world will make the fool get it.<eos> - Did you pledge allegiance?<eos> - Go to hell...<eos> - Grigory...<eos> - Are you alive?<eos> - Answer me.<eos> - I'm alive.<eos> I guess our hut has tumbled down?<eos> No, why tumble down?<eos> It stands alright.
Would responsible men ever sign such rigmarole?<eos> Whatever its terms... the treaty was made under the threat of Commodore Perry's guns.<eos> Such a treaty has no virtue.<eos> Have you forgotten why Commodore Perry came?<eos> Because shipwrecked sailors were being beheaded... and because no ship could put in to a Japanese port, even for water.<eos> We only wish to be left alone.<eos> Your Excellency, your country stands at the crossroads of the world.<eos> From both East and West, men are finding an ever-increasing need for those roads.<eos> If, in your desire for isolation... you refuse to make them safe for peaceful traffic... the world will treat Japan as it would treat a band of brigands... infesting a highway.<eos> A true Japanese would rather see his country perish in flames... and perish with it than see it corrupted by foreigners... and slowly rot.
"before I can report real progress.<eos> I will keep you informed."<eos> Just sign it "respectfully yours".<eos> It's wonderful, the things she can do with flowers.<eos> Mr. Harris.<eos> Mr. Harris.<eos> Bring the flag, Henry.<eos> An honor, Your Excellency.<eos> Mr. Harris, you must take down that flag.<eos> The flag is a signal to that ship that there's a consul here ready to serve it.
Mr. Harris.<eos> Bring the flag, Henry.<eos> An honor, Your Excellency.<eos> Mr. Harris, you must take down that flag.<eos> The flag is a signal to that ship that there's a consul here ready to serve it.<eos> Must I repeat?<eos> There is no consul here.<eos> Shimoda is closed and guarded.<eos> The ship shall not land.<eos> If you wish to serve it, take down that flag.
It don't make sense.<eos> Like we're hitting a battleship with a slingshot.<eos> It's going after another plane.<eos> Easy Baker squadron leader.<eos> Mission's a washout.<eos> We're going to head for...<eos> No! It's coming after me!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Machine guns, cannons, rockets, nothing touched it.
I'm gonna kill them!<eos> Ammunition.<eos> Go easy.<eos> We only have a little left.<eos> This thing is stuck.<eos> Ammunition!<eos> Ammunition!<eos> Ammunition over here.<eos> Drag him over to the front.<eos> When I throw this rope down, tie it round his arms, someone.
The smart one knows, and nothing in the world will make the fool get it.<eos> - Did you pledge allegiance?<eos> - Go to hell...<eos> - Grigory...<eos> - Are you alive?<eos> - Answer me.<eos> - I'm alive.<eos> I guess our hut has tumbled down?<eos> No, why tumble down?<eos> It stands alright.
I came to trade, not to admire his collection.<eos> Tell him we'll pitch camp on the other side of the creek and talk tomorrow.<eos> It is not that I am afraid.<eos> Don't apologize. You got well paid.<eos> But he knows who you are, and why you're here.<eos> This, I did not know.<eos> Take it. I do not want blood money.<eos> Do you think old Scar means to kill us?<eos> He's got to.<eos> We've been asking for it for five years.
Remember the Sabbath day, to keep it holy.<eos> Honor thy father and thy mother:<eos> Thou shalt not kill.<eos> And the people sinned a great sin, for they had made them a god of gold.<eos> And they bore him upon their shoulders and rejoiced, saying, "This be our god, O Israel."<eos> Are you mourners of Moses afraid to face the new god of gold?<eos> They were as children who had lost their faith.<eos> They were perverse and crooked and rebellious against God.<eos> They did eat the bread of wickedness, and drank the wine of violence, and they did evil in the eyes of the Lord.<eos> And the people cried, "The graven image hath brought us joy,  and they worshipped the golden calf and sacrificed unto it.
This calls for a medical opinion.<eos> How about it?<eos> We're on the right track.<eos> Now we need something extra for age.<eos> What have you got there, Doug?<eos> Seltzer, some fruit salts, hair tonic...<eos> Hair tonic!<eos> That's got a coal tar base.<eos> One drop of hair tonic, for age.<eos> That'll age the daylights out of it.
He's got his nerve.<eos> Wait till next week, Doug, when he gets his laundry.<eos> Doug, I'm gonna get some starch.<eos> You know, some of that real thick starch like they use on nurses' uniforms--<eos> And when old Roberts said that, I thought the Captain was gonna lose his marbles!<eos> Nothing stops old Roberts!<eos> Nice gain' , Mr. Roberts.<eos> It was really beautiful the way you read the old man off.<eos> You're gonna send in another one next week?<eos> He sure is! And it's my turn to shove it right under the old man's nose.
– Give me the sword!<eos> You're too young. Stay here, on the ship.<eos> Sadko!<eos> You wanted blood, did you?<eos> Cool off!<eos> Hey, get a sail!<eos> Bring me a sail! Quick!<eos> Easy, you giant, you'll damage the steed.<eos> It will be alright.<eos> Take it to the ship.
Harbour Master's Office Maritime Affairs<eos> Come in.<eos> Several SOS.<eos> Yacht in trouble, Sardinia.<eos> - What's it called?<eos> - Suraya.<eos> We'll let the Italians know.<eos> The net stops me steering.<eos> You mustn't cast it off.<eos> We'll sink with it!
"On my last day, Mephistopheles shall claim my soul." Signed Faust.<eos> All's in order.<eos> Why did you want to know your future?<eos> Why didn't you listen to me?<eos> I'm not as bad as you think.<eos> I've become used to you.<eos> You're my friend.<eos> But you can't erase a signature written with your own blood, you know.<eos> Fate is fate.<eos> You can't escape it.
The King.<eos> My father.<eos> Two nights together have Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch, in the dead, vast, middle of the night been thus encountered.<eos> A figure like your father, armed, appears before them and with solemn march goes slow and stately by them.<eos> This to me in dread and secrecy did they impart and I with them the third night kept the watch, where, as they had reported, both in time, form of the thing, each word made true and good, the apparition comes.<eos> I knew your father.<eos> These hands are not more like.<eos> - But where was this?<eos> - Upon the platform, where we watched.<eos> - Did you not speak to it?
Don't bother with it much when it's concerned with war, but yours was different.<eos> Seemed to come from way back somewhere when you were a kid.<eos> - What'd I say?<eos> - Something about boots and flashes of light.<eos> Somebody hurt or killed.<eos> - Does that mean anything to you?<eos> But you gotta tell me what I said, doc.<eos> Every word. I wanna know.<eos> Don't upset yourself.<eos> Your fever's gone, And the nightmare is with it wherever they came from.
That takes money, Frankie, a lot of money.<eos> Tell Vince to lay it out.<eos> He told me he laid out 30,000 already.<eos> Have you been seeing Jim Vincent?<eos> No, Frankie boy, of course not.<eos> He just phoned.<eos> Said he was running short.<eos> Frankie, we may need part of that bank money to get...<eos> Forget it.<eos> The secret of where that money is doesn't walk out of here unless I walk out with it.
- It is a faithful friend.<eos> Mostly silent, but talks when I need it to.<eos> That's your idea of a friend?<eos> You must lead a gay life.<eos> - I lead the life I like to lead.<eos> - You're a lucky man.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Saving your life.<eos> - He only wanted the money.<eos> - But you'd not have parted with it.
Oh, Alex. You're very good.<eos> I'm sorry to hurry you, Dr. Brulov, but your car is waiting.<eos> - You have just time.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I'm always late, always forgetting.<eos> A brilliant man.<eos> I should have gone to the station with him.<eos> You're too tired.<eos> I know that feeling of exhaustion only too well.<eos> One must humor it, or it explodes.
There's the man the law is looking for, not Leopold Dilg.<eos> His only crime was that he had courage and spoke his mind.<eos> This is your law and your finest possession.<eos> It makes you free.<eos> Why have you come to destroy it?<eos> Take those weapons home and burn them, and then think.<eos> Think of this country and of the law that makes it what it is.<eos> Think of a world crying for this very law.<eos> Then you'll understand why you ought to guard it and why the law has got to be the concern of every citizen to uphold it for your neighbour as well as yourself.<eos> Violence against it is one mistake.
go to sleep, go to sleep go quietly to sleep<eos> Riccio the letters for France, you majesty<eos> you sang, madonna, it was like a dream<eos> you ought to go to sleep<eos> sleep?<eos> I write letters for the Scottish crown but I only see the queen's eyes<eos> I only hear the queen's voice, like a dark melody a new poem, Riccio?<eos> I don't like it, it doesn't rhyme<eos> I have sung, I wrote poems, and nothing has remained but you are here, Maria you are the life life?<eos> doesn't it pass us all by? and we watch it go by?
That was the first wish, Master.<eos> Two more remain.<eos> Name them.<eos> Don't you hurry me.<eos> I've got to be careful.<eos> Two more. You know what I wish?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Where is my friend Ahmad? Master, to know that, you must look into the All-Seeing Eye.<eos> - Then give me the eye.<eos> - Master, I can take you where it is... but not even I can steal it for you.
You're a reactionary.<eos> You can't tell me that you don't look forward to the day... when you can come in here, stand on your two feet... and say, "From now on, it's share and share alike."<eos> Emphatically not, sir.<eos> The prospect terrifies me.<eos> Now, don't misunderstand me, sir.<eos> I don't resent your not paying me for the past two months... but the thought that I should split my bank account with you... that you should take half of my life's savings... that is really too much for me, sir.<eos> Go to bed, little father, go to bed.<eos> - I don't look too foolish?<eos> - Foolish?<eos> If this dress were walking down the boulevard all by itself... I'd follow it from one end of Paris to the other.
You can't do anything normally!<eos> Come on...<eos> Come in, anyway.<eos> Try not to make Auntie cry.<eos> Come on then.<eos> - You borrowed money for the journey?<eos> - I was lent it. Tell me his name and address so I can send the money back.<eos> It's a friend.<eos> Don't want to tell me?<eos> Then I'll give you the money and you send it.
- Would you like to wring my little neck?<eos> - I'd love it.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I've thought about it for years.<eos> I knew you'd come.<eos> And I knew when you did, you'd never leave.<eos> Am I forgiven for sending for you?<eos> Forgiven.<eos> When we were on that plane I was fascinated by the way its shadow followed it.
Well, then I'd scold you for being fanciful and a little foolish.<eos> What you probably feel is the melancholy of happiness that mood that comes over all of us when we realize that even love can't remain at flood tide forever.<eos> - Without Armand, I'm doomed.<eos> - With him, you're both doomed.<eos> Without a profession of any sort, what can he do?<eos> Unless he sinks so low he's willing to let some other man foot the bills for his life with you.<eos> You don't know Armand. You wouldn't say that.<eos> No one knows the man he might become if he loses his self-respect.<eos> But I think that's too high a price to pay, even for love.<eos> I want Armand to enjoy life, not to be sacrificed to it.
Yeah, I gave it to you to pay my room and board.<eos> Then you gave it to her.<eos> "Recommember"?<eos> You mean the money that he gave to you that you gave to him that he gave to me, was the same money I gave to him to pay him?<eos> If that was the money you gave him to give me to pay to him it must've been the money that I gave him to give to you to pay my rent.<eos> -Mr. FinIayson, I owe you an apology.<eos> -And 37 dollars.<eos> Then this money must belong to you.<eos> Next time, I want my payment without any detour.<eos> He gave it to him and he gave it to you and who give it to what.
MAN:<eos> I want my money. WOMAN:<eos> I've got nothing to give!<eos> I need my money. I need my money.<eos> I'm in charge of the gang now.<eos> It's all we've got.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You know the price.<eos> That arrangement was with your dead mate, Bradley.<eos> It still stands.
I used a Bunsen burner.<eos> But if you looked closely, you could tell.<eos> Do you think there could be some kind of meaning in the changes? Some message, perhaps?<eos> Katz bought the book after the war.<eos> Books were often used to secrete papers, money.<eos> Well, I copied them down.<eos> But your notes were stolen.<eos> Oh, before that.<eos> I wrote out just the letters that were odd and made a list of them.<eos> Where is it?
What's so important about that book, Mr Spall, that you'd shoot a man?<eos> You're out of your depth.<eos> Katz' killer is still out there.<eos> I didn't put it there.<eos> How did you know where it was hidden?<eos> I didn't. You were just in the right place at the right time?<eos> I got a note in my mail this morning.<eos> Who was it from?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's anonymous, but I wanted to keep it for Beatrice.
Louisa wouldn't be the only one she's crossed swords with.<eos> You'd better cooperate, Archie.<eos> Jimmy already thinks you did it.<eos> What? You are behaving very suspiciously.<eos> Clarence had the opportunity to murder Louisa.<eos> He could easily slip out of the studio in a musical interlude.<eos> Hazel and Louisa didn't get on.<eos> Have you seen a running order anywhere?<eos> We're in such a mess without Louisa.<eos> Here it is.
Paper!<eos> Look at this.<eos> Why would Louisa buy an interstate train ticket?<eos> An overnight sleeper to Sydney booked for next week.<eos> No return.<eos> Clarence Ball said Hazel didn't like any of Louisa's ideas, but this is the Polkinghorns episode they played this morning.<eos> Maybe she was just transcribing for Hazel.<eos> Look, it says, 'Written by Miss Louisa Singleton.'<eos> If all of those stories were Louisa's ideas and Hazel was taking all the glory, I don't blame her for trying to leave<eos> That radio awards night, it didn't begin until 7:00pm but the Creswicks left the studio at 5:30.
Fighting for the Allies, not the Kaiser, by the way.<eos> May I?<eos> Please.<eos> I need to know what happened between you and your brother, if you want my help.<eos> Erik.<eos> Thank goodness.<eos> Someone was here.<eos> The door was unlocked.<eos> My pistol.<eos> It's gone.
Thank goodness.<eos> I'd hate to think you were disobeying a directive.<eos> So, was the victim already dead or did she drown in the river, sir?<eos> Jack?<eos> Drowned, Collins.<eos> Can't have been pleasant for Hugh to fish her out of the water.<eos> 'In the water overnight, injury found under the hair, most likely caused by a blunt instrument.'<eos> But not the cause of death.<eos> No. There was sea water in the lungs, notable for an exceptionally high saline content.<eos> Then the body can't have come downstream from the convent. It must have been washed upstream from the bay!
In particular, look for any references to Ernie Heppenstall, Len Fowler or Mitch Darcy.<eos> Miss Fisher?<eos> She hung up.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - My goodness!<eos> - She's gone.<eos> I saw Nicholas Mortimer with this book. Miss...<eos> Quentin Lynch was reading it, too.<eos> He quoted from it.<eos> Oh, this sculpture, it's...
Three people have died, including my mother.<eos> And my rotten stepdad.<eos> Miss Mortimer.<eos> It's Miss Darcy.<eos> I'm going to my room.<eos> Turn that off!<eos> Mrs Stanley, I'm sorry.<eos> Phryne, where did you put my briefcase?<eos> I need that paperwork signed.<eos> I believe it ended up in my room, Aunt P.
And my rotten stepdad.<eos> Miss Mortimer.<eos> It's Miss Darcy.<eos> I'm going to my room.<eos> Turn that off!<eos> Mrs Stanley, I'm sorry.<eos> Phryne, where did you put my briefcase?<eos> I need that paperwork signed.<eos> I believe it ended up in my room, Aunt P.<eos> Well, what use is it there?
What happened?<eos> I thought I'd go cross-country to Jamieson.<eos> I saw a sign.<eos> And then someone hit me from behind.<eos> Miss Fisher?<eos> Miss Fisher.<eos> Looks like fresh timber.<eos> Couldn't be more than a couple of weeks old.<eos> I thought the mine was closed ten years ago.<eos> It was.
I want to use his death to bring Bonnie back to life.<eos> What makes you think that I need help?<eos> Well, for starters, you're still here, as in why do you suck so badly at killing yourself?<eos> To die, he has to be mortal.<eos> If he's mortal, then he's a witch, and if he dies as a witch, then he's stuck on the other side forever. He already tried to bring down the veil to the other side.<eos> He failed. Maybe he has a plan "B."<eos> Maybe he wants to do more than just drop the veil and let all the ghosts out.<eos> She knows I can't hear her, right?<eos> She thinks Silas wants to destroy the other side completely. Powerful spells are bound by something even more powerful-- the moon, a comet, a doppelganger.<eos> The other side was made 2,000 years ago, and it still exists.
I lost my psychic abilities. Stefan lost his memories.<eos> And this severed the link?<eos> Yes, Damon. I can read your mind again.<eos> I'm not lying, and maybe you enjoyed breaking your brother's neck just a little bit too much.<eos> Sold.<eos> I'll cozy up to the witch and sift through her mind, figure out where she's hiding the anchor, and you, all you got to do is keep him dead.<eos> Isn't Tess gonna be slightly suspicious when the man whose brain she just fried is all of a sudden showing interest in her?<eos> Of all the men here, Tessa went straight for Stefan.<eos> This face won her heart before.<eos> See, a woman never forgets her first love, no matter how badly it ended.
If I'd had my gun...<eos> You'd miss an elephant at five feet.<eos> Who shot that chamois?<eos> None of your business, César.<eos> You didn't see it was a female with her young? Are you blind?<eos> This isn't the right time.<eos> We need your help.<eos> We've got to get rid of that beast.<eos> I saw its tracks on the Andagne ridge.<eos> It went further down.
André was in Glantiéres.<eos> Glantiéres?<eos> I won't take your rabbit.<eos> César calls you "the beast".<eos> César's my grandpa.<eos> Not my real grandpa, but it's the same.<eos> Look, your little savage is alive.<eos> What's that face?<eos> Did you see the beast?<eos> It's prowling nearby.
Has anyone seen it kill sheep?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The beast.<eos> Didn't César show you the dead sheep?<eos> Yes, but he never saw it attack.<eos> If he had, he wouldn't have missed it.<eos> Time to sleep now.<eos> I'll put out 3 more.<eos> If the beast comes near the sheep... Clack!<eos> Maybe it's not killing the sheep.
You're coming to work at the sheepfold every day.<eos> Come on.<eos> Don't shoot the deer!<eos> You have no right!<eos> If César sees you, he'll destroy you!<eos> - Let go! - You brat!<eos> A broken weapon, an immobilized soldier.<eos> How will you settle that, Mr. Mayor?<eos> But that beast isn't mine.<eos> I've told you, it's dangerous.
We'll kill that beast.<eos> I know your hunts.<eos> Full of holes.<eos> What else can we do?<eos> I want men. 50 at least.<eos> 50 peopm!<eos> Tomorrow, 8 a.m. German time.<eos> Where will you hunt tomorrow?<eos> Do you know that beast?<eos> Why did it bite the Kraut?
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror but it sees everything-- violent crimes involving ordinary people.
Which part: the tasing, the drugging, or whatever this is?<eos> I had to make sure you'd hear me out.<eos> She needs our help, and I figured you wouldn't come willingly.<eos> She?<eos> The machine's given me a mission,<eos> And step one is to team up with you.<eos> I'll pass.<eos> Trust issues.<eos> Besides, the machine gives missions to Harold and the government-- relevant, irrelevant.<eos> Why would it be talking to you?
It's because he's scared of us.<eos> You got it?<eos> Yeah. Thanks for the lesson, boss.<eos> That ain't the lesson.<eos> Old man Morozov made the mistake of pulling a gun when I called him out as a thief.<eos> There's a shovel in the backseat.<eos> 6 feet, kid.<eos> Don't skimp.<eos> Cells one through three secure, Sir.<eos> Hope the voice in your head knows what it's doing.
You got a lot of love in you, Gemma.<eos> Sweet, deep love. I've seen it.<eos> But it's so wrapped around secrets and hate I don't know if you can find it anymore.<eos> I just let her destroy my life take away my family?<eos> Is that the payback for all the secrets and hate?<eos> You got a couple roads in front of you, sweetheart.<eos> One of them is real slow and probably very uncomfortable but eventually leads back to those boys.<eos> It's the road you're already on.<eos> Judge filed your restraining order.<eos> It'll be served at Gemma's house today.
No, I haven't.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - No.<eos> We already have something in common.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - So, what do you do?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I'm, I'm a civil engineer. - Wow!<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I have no idea why I said wow 'cause I don't know what that is.<eos> Oh, okay, uh, well, today, for instance, the city decided that it needed a new stoplight, so it's my job to go over all the contracts with the stoplight manufacturers and just get the best price... for the s-stoplight.
You sure it's safe there?<eos> This place was a bargain.<eos> It's okay, the neighborhood seems pretty good.<eos> Yeah, you know.<eos> Stop running around, settle down!<eos> - In the living room please.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Honey! I told you not to go up there.<eos> It's so much better than where we lived before.
- I trained under the Great Couchelle.<eos> Here, sign your name on this card.<eos> And then I'm going to fold it with one hand.<eos> And place it inside your mouth.<eos> And then I'm going to write my name...<eos> "Leslie"... fold it and you are going to place it inside my mouth.<eos> And now we're going to kiss.<eos> And something magical is going to happen.<eos> Look at your card.<eos> Wait, this has your name on it.
Lisa's going to have your job.<eos> Yeah, who's laughing now?<eos> ( Laughs ) I am. ( Laughs )<eos> You have nothing on me.<eos> It's your words against mine.<eos> Yeah, well, that's where you're wrong, "Oliver Twit."<eos> We've got you admitting everything on hidden camera.<eos> That's not a camera, Charlie, that's just a clock.<eos> Well, where's the hidden camera?<eos> It's up on the mantle disguised as a video camera.
Sure.<eos> (GRUNTING)<eos> This is how a goddess acts.<eos> (SCREAMING)<eos> Okay, come on, come on.<eos> (SIZZLING)<eos> (SAM SHOUTING)<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> What?<eos> Your liver, it's...
Previously onRoyal Pains...<eos> Jeremiah's completely in love with Divya.<eos> - Hank tell you that?<eos> - No.<eos> Yeah, since last summer.<eos> Head over heels.<eos> Blythe, where'd you get this bowl?<eos> It's been in the family for years.
Did I say something wrong?<eos> Let me finish.<eos> I don't want to hear it.<eos> Sister!<eos> Sit down.<eos> Sit down.<eos> For this happy evening, Ela had prepared a speech for Ayla.<eos> She would have told in sign language, and I would read it, but...<eos> Ela doesn't feel like it now.<eos> I want to read it to you anyways because I want you all to hear it.
- I'm gonna kill you dead.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Oh, you're under a lot of pressure at work.<eos> Lots of late nights and weekends.<eos> But still, you stay active.<eos> Lots of, uh, physical activity?<eos> You can tell all that from my pulse?<eos> Sure... and the way the tux fits.<eos> Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.<eos> - It's vintage.
- Mm.<eos> Oh, you're under a lot of pressure at work.<eos> Lots of late nights and weekends.<eos> But still, you stay active.<eos> Lots of, uh, physical activity?<eos> You can tell all that from my pulse?<eos> Sure... and the way the tux fits.<eos> Oh, my, this watch is gorgeous.<eos> - It's vintage.<eos> It was my father's, actually.
- It's 11:00.<eos> - That's impossible.<eos> I set my alarm.<eos> Tiny King, where's my cell phone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The last time I saw it, some tall jerk threw it in the Jacuzzi.<eos> ( Alarm blaring ) Oh, hey, look at that.<eos> Alarm's still going off.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I have been waiting on this promotion and now you blew it.
But if I say a little, he'll know everything.<eos> I've suffered in your absence. Were you avoiding me?<eos> No, darling.<eos> But you were pressing for marriage and I didn't have my father's permission to answer.<eos> I've spoken to him and he says you may ask him for my hand.<eos> When you like.<eos> Before I ask him, allow me to ask you.<eos> Is your love solid?<eos> Why? Will it take what I have to ask of it?<eos> - Will it accept lowliness?
We got a missing kid.<eos> - Ran from the car.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - What have you got, Severide? - He's in bad shape.<eos> We need to find a way to get him out of here quick.<eos> From the size of the seat, the kid could be anywhere from, like, three to six years old.<eos> Clarke... send me down a sawzall, then bring the stokes basket.<eos> Got it.<eos> Send up a sawzall.<eos> Got it.
And I should have told you that sooner.<eos> I want to live in jail with her.<eos> I want to see my mom.<eos> Buddy, listen.<eos> You can't live there, but, um, you can visit.<eos> You guys can handle this.<eos> Listen... those firefighters and paramedics at 51?<eos> Well, they're your family too and they're gonna help me take good care of you guys. Okay?<eos> Come here, buddy.<eos> It's pretty cool... being able to drink in a bar after it's closed.
Well, just take it easy.<eos> I'll call you when I know more.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - All right.<eos> This is a really good Pinot noir.<eos> Can't go wrong with a willamette valley wine, which, for my money, beats the pantalones off any of that French cote d'or stuff.<eos> Well, good choice.<eos> So I was thinking...<eos> You know, just thinking, um, well, out loud, now... That, uh, Nick's back with Juliette, and you're still renting your brother's old apartment, - which is a great apartment.<eos> - Uhhuh. I'm not saying it's not.
You killed him!<eos> Thank God!<eos> He didn't give me a choice.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You shot him.<eos> Kill him now.<eos> Yeah, we'll shut down his place for good!<eos> They're everywhere.<eos> Bauerschwein!<eos> Now this feud ends, and it ends now.
There's no output.<eos> Okay, what else?<eos> You have epigastric tenderness, increased W.B.C., and little to no drain output, which means you have a... - symptomatic pancreatic leak.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Which also means I'm in a great deal of pain.<eos> Now you need to try and unclog the drain with a Fogarty catheter so this doesn't happen again!<eos> God.<eos> There's the bossy Richard I know and love.<eos> They're gonna learn how to look me in the eye and explain to me what they're doing so I understand.<eos> When I ask a question, they're going to answer it.
Reservations?<eos> You're asking me to spy on a notorious spy killer while pretending to be an expert in cryptography, which I know nothing about.<eos> Reddington insists on you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Look at those pictures.<eos> If there is a name in that message, there's gonna be another face in that file.<eos> That'll be on you.<eos> I'll be back in a second.<eos> I just need to grab my purse.<eos> I thought it was on the counter.
We'll meet Wujing.<eos> You'll decode the message and transmit it to your team.<eos> If I decode the message, that means the Chinese get it, too.<eos> Exactly -- both you and the Chinese will know the name of the agent for which the message was intended, and the race begins.<eos> We try to save him.<eos> The Chinese try to kill him.<eos> We could give them a false message.<eos> No. That could work. We could send them in the wrong direction.<eos> I said no.<eos> The Chinese may not know what the message is, but they certainly know what it isn't.
It's disparaging, disrespectful.<eos> But it's not who you are, is it?<eos> It's not how you feel about yourself.<eos> What name are you referring to?<eos> You don't know?<eos> What name?<eos> They call you the Stewmaker... because of the chemicals you use to dissolve human bodies.<eos> Nature.<eos> What about nature?<eos> It's the transference of energy.

Where do you think he might be now, Mrs. Kornish?<eos> Oh, it's the weekend.<eos> H-he likes to get away.<eos> - He goes fishing.<eos> - Where does he fish?<eos> We have a little cabin up in...<eos> I don't go...there.<eos> I-it's his place.<eos> Tell us about the cabin.<eos> It's not far.
Roll Tide!<eos> All right.<eos> After you.<eos> All right, Harley, what do you think happened to your card? Wait, is it under your shoe?<eos> Let's see is it under your shoe?<eos> No, no, I mean...<eos> Is it under your armpit there? Let me see.<eos> Other armpit. Let me see, let me see.<eos> Oh, gosh. I guess it must be gone.<eos> Unless it's, uh...
He gave me plenty to eat, a roof.<eos> That was all new to me.<eos> Then it went from being SuperKids Summer Camp to people dying.<eos> Breakouts getting their powers extracted, experimented on, shot in the head.<eos> The opposite of what your father wanted.<eos> A place our kind would be safe.<eos> I know that you think that I hang back sometimes.<eos> I'm only trying to fulfill your dad's vision the way I think he would have.<eos> You hear music?<eos> It's coming from over here.
- Just shut up a sec, let me finish.<eos> - Hey, she's not one of your street whores, asshole.<eos> - She's not one of yours either.<eos> - No, stop it.<eos> All right, all right, enough.<eos> This D.A. is the one that's pushing our sheriff at me.<eos> I did a little digging, too.<eos> Roosevelt's following me, looking for a bad move, it means they ain't got dick.<eos> I know Patterson.<eos> She's not the kind of broad just throws shit against the wall, hopes it sticks.
Hmm. Interesting.<eos> Not the answer I was looking for, but interesting.<eos> They have found a bowl in each of the temples they've excavated, except for the last one.<eos> The one overseen by Monroe and Clennon.<eos> In that dig, there's no bowl.<eos> It was thought lost to plunder or time or shelling, but I believe it was stolen.<eos> Here is a picture of one of the bowls recovered at the site.<eos> Beth Roney had a bowl just like this in her office yesterday.<eos> She was working with Monroe and Clennon.<eos> She prevented it from being catalogued, and then she got it into their hands so they could remove it from the site.
I don't steal from my digs.<eos> It was sitting right here.<eos> We got a warrant.<eos> We'll turn this place upside down.<eos> I doubt they'll find anything.<eos> She hid it somewhere after our visit yesterday.<eos> I hope not-- 'cause if she did, we got nothing on her.<eos> We searched her place from top to bottom.<eos> There's no trace of the bowl we think she stole from the Afghan temple.<eos> Well, it was at her house yesterday.
Want to play?<eos> I bet you can't catch me.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's okay.<eos> You're sure you want to stay in this old cabin?<eos> It's a bit of a fixer-upper.<eos> You and I have very different definitions of old.<eos> It seems if a building stays upright for more than a decade you people declare it a national landmark.<eos> No, this cabin has all the modern means I need.<eos> It's certainly preferable to that motel.
I'm no Middle English expert but I could have sworn I heard the word "horseman" thrown in there.<eos> Indeed you did.<eos> Though not the headless one with whom we're acquainted.<eos> The colony was infected with this plague by the Horseman of Pestilence.<eos> Also known as Conquest.<eos> Another Horseman of the Apocalypse has arrived.<eos> Not yet.<eos> And not if we can stop it.<eos> Pestilence instituted this plague centuries ago but the Roanoke colony contained it, stopping its spread and thwarting the horseman from riding forth.<eos> It's been unleashed anew through Thomas.
Assuming she doesn't melt down and try to kill us in our sleep.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> I was kidding.<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night.<eos> You know, if we were roomies, we could do this every night.<eos> Of course, if I moved in, I'd want to... zhush up the place a little.<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> Eh, it lacks zhush.<eos> It's zhush-less.
Is there any way I could sit in on your therapy group and watch you work?<eos> - You won't even know I'm there.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I kind of made a promise to myself.<eos> - Please.<eos> I want to be as good at therapy as I am bad at choosing men.<eos> What was that promise?<eos> That I would say yes to more things.<eos> So when did you know you were screwed up enough to be a therapist?<eos> When does the sun know it's shiny enough?
I can barely stomach one.<eos> (Chuckles)<eos> Ah, you would've liked him. He was a thief and a liar.<eos> Yeah, you would've liked my brother.<eos> He could be a stubborn ass.<eos> Now wait here.<eos> What exactly does the King have to find on this island?<eos> A plant.<eos> We journeyed across the realms for a plant?<eos> Our sources say it's magical.
All right.<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's try this another way.<eos> Uh, in your romantic fantasy of our future, where is Jenny?<eos> She'll spend Christmas with us, but we're gonna want our alone time.<eos> Okay, let's focus on that word "alone."<eos> Having house guests is the best.<eos> You know, you get excited to see them, you put out the fluffy towels, you hold your farts, everything's nice... but, eventually, you have to fart.<eos> Here's what you do.<eos> Uh, you go out on the deck, and pretend to look at the ocean, wait for a big wave and when it breaks, so do you.
My heart is in a landfill.<eos> This baby belonged to a drunken quarterback from Alabama.<eos> Roll Tide!<eos> You know, Marty is a television legend.<eos> He created Here Comes Pleshkin.<eos> I love that show.<eos> Th-That was a drinking game in college.<eos> Every time someone would yell "Pleshkin!" I would take a shot.<eos> I had so much drunken sex because of your show.<eos> It was a piece of crap, but it paid for my first six... seven wives.
There!<eos> I killed it because it hurt you.<eos> I swear I didn't mean it.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> It's fine, Max.<eos> I feel like I'm gonna throw up.<eos> There... I French-fried my phone.<eos> What else can I do?<eos> I mean, really, it is technology's fault.<eos> It's turning us against each other.
You mean... alone?<eos> This bean... can open a portal, take you far away from this land.<eos> Even this realm.<eos> You could start a new life.<eos> But it cannot be with your father.<eos> But he's coming back for me as soon as he gets a job.<eos> The truth is, he's at the pub.<eos> He doesn't want a job.<eos> Or real responsibility.<eos> Family can be a strength, but it can also be a burden.
It requires a lot.<eos> I guess we're about to find out how much those lessons I gave you paid off.<eos> Follow my lead.<eos> This is it.<eos> The place where you're going to save magic.<eos> Why does it have to be here?<eos> Well, because this is the location from which Neverland's magic emanates.<eos> What's the hourglass for?<eos> Marks how much time we have left before Neverland's magic runs out.<eos> It's almost empty.
No.<eos> Peter Pan is gone forever.<eos> What is this place?<eos> I don't remember seeing it from my dreams.<eos> That's because it didn't exist.<eos> It was created when you made the decision to stay here.<eos> A giant skull?<eos> It's glorious!<eos> What's the hourglass for?<eos> It represents the magic fueling your youth, the magic allowing you to stay here, to stay young.

I could feel the heat of the engine roaring past me.<eos> It was like the whole world was in slow motion.<eos> Did you realise how dangerous it was?<eos> I just kept thinking Bear Grylls has done scarier things than this.<eos> I am putting all this on my blog.<eos> It's called Interview with a Hero.<eos> How come you haven't RSVPed to my party yet?<eos> I only got the message, like, 30 seconds ago.<eos> You should come.<eos> It's in a week.
___<eos> - I knew it!<eos> - I thought I was giving you the tour.<eos> Looks like you know this place better than I do.<eos> Yes, well, I have an affinity for libraries.<eos> So, have you had any interesting correspondence lately?<eos> That would presuppose a letterbox, so, no.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Actually, I did get a hand-delivered note the other day.<eos> - It was very peculiar.
- Yeah, we like food too.<eos> Andy!<eos> Let's not get side-tracked by your lover.<eos> - She's not my...<eos> - Wasn't that insane?<eos> - I've gotta interview you.<eos> - Want to interview me as well?<eos> Um, why?<eos> This story is going to be huge.<eos> It's exploding all over the blogosphere.
This is me smiling. What are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna get as many people out as I can before Titus finds out.<eos> Come on.<eos> - One more.<eos> - Up there?<eos> Come on, everybody on here.<eos> We've got room for two more right here.<eos> It's a shame.<eos> This town survived the blackout, bandits, two cholera outbreaks.<eos> But today is the day it dies.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system... a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
I conjure and command thee, dark lords to the vernacular, summon truth from lying tongues.<eos> Fie upon the wicked who dare to throw sand in our eyes.<eos> With force I command thee, let truth be spoken!<eos> Fiona aced transmutation and pyrokinesis.<eos> By this time tomorrow, we'll have a new Supreme.<eos> You notice how Spalding spends his life cleaning up Fiona's messes?<eos> If Fiona did do something terrible to Anna Leigh, Spalding knows about it.<eos> If Spalding does know something, he's not talking.<eos> He's not going to have a choice.<eos> I enchanted his tongue so it's incapable of speaking a lie.
Stand before us.<eos> 40 years ago, our Supreme disappeared.<eos> Shortly thereafter, you were mutilated.<eos> Some call it coincidence, others call it mystery.<eos> As to me, I can't imagine living under the same roof as the monster who dismembered me, making her breakfast, pouring her tea.<eos> But you have nothing to be afraid of now.<eos> Justice is so near.<eos> All you have to do is write the name of the witch who was responsible for severing your tongue.<eos> He's not going to have a choice.<eos> I enchanted his tongue so it's incapable of speaking a lie, and I happen to know the Council's calling him for a closed session tomorrow morning.
Whole grain?<eos> No, plain.<eos> Garlic?<eos> No.<eos> The plain!<eos> The plain!<eos> It took me two years, but I finally got him to say it.<eos> Are you telling me you don't hear that cat?<eos> We have to let it in.<eos> It's clearly a stray, or this Marine I met last week at a blood drive.
Are you telling me you don't hear that cat?<eos> We have to let it in.<eos> It's clearly a stray, or this Marine I met last week at a blood drive.<eos> Last week there was a man outside our door screaming, "I've been stabbed,"<eos> and all you did was yell, "Shut up."<eos> Because he said, "I think I've been stabbed."<eos> You're either stabbed, or you're not stabbed.<eos> Listen, it sounds like the cat's saying hello.<eos> Hello, hello.<eos> Listen, it's talking.

Come on.<eos> Chestnut needs a friend.<eos> He is dying to trash us to someone, and all he's got is that rat who is super self-involved.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> It's so late.<eos> It's probably the cat, or the guy who's raping girls in Brooklyn.<eos> Open the door, and roll the dice.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Please, somebody tell me they killed that damn cat.<eos> And where did it learn how to say hello?
It's been keeping me up all night.<eos> This poor cat has been crying at our door every night trying to get in, trying to get a little warm milk, maybe a skosh of tuna.<eos> Max, that's our dinner tomorrow.<eos> Wait.<eos> Be careful.<eos> A cat is not always a cat.<eos> Oh, please continue.<eos> In Poland, we believe if you die outside, you're reincarnated as a cat.<eos> Am I the only one who thinks Poland sounds like a real freak show?<eos> So never let a cat in, because it's just a person that's been reincarnated and will bring in all the bad jus.
Yeah, but before that, you said "gaw" and "thud," so I didn't take it very seriously.<eos> She was right to call me.<eos> Diggle, you need medical attention.<eos> He needs more than that.<eos> When Dig passed out, I sent a sample of his blood to a chemist I know at QC.<eos> The guy owes me a favor.<eos> Long story, I fixed his parking ticket. Huh. I guess it's not that long.<eos> Felicity.<eos> The blood sample.<eos> Yeah. It came back positive-- for trace amounts of Vertigo.
I have to stay on the ball.<eos> Want to not look at them?<eos> Married actor while cheating.<eos> Oh come on.<eos> You know that True love is a myth.<eos> You are a long time been enough single.<eos> On Jammer actually.<eos> I like your hair.<eos> Stop it, Al.<eos> I think it is only for the Rich and famous a myth.
What's this?<eos> I think it's coal.<eos> Lump of coal and stolen presents in the same place?<eos> Maybe it's not part of the crime scene.<eos> I'll bag it just in case.<eos> I found the body up here inside the car.<eos> Appears to be a teenage boy.<eos> You know who it is?<eos> Not yet.<eos> That jacket looks like it hasn't been here long.
that's not helping! that's what sarge says to me when i'm nervous.<eos> rosa, i think you're nervous.<eos> of course i'm nervous!<eos> what did you think was the problem? we just assumed you were a terrifying human being with a short fuse.<eos> but if the problem is that you're nervous, that's where charles boyle lives, baby.<eos> i can help! you just need to go to your happy place.<eos> what's that?<eos> sounds stupid.<eos> oh, everyone's happy place is different. for me, i just imagine i'm slurping up the world's longest piece of linguini.<eos> it just keeps going and going.
Well, if he does, do you know how filthy those rental balls are?<eos> They might as well stand on the corner and give away free rectal exams.<eos> Okay, everybody.<eos> Who's ready for a scavenger hunt?<eos> Somewhere... in the city of Pasadena, I've hidden a golden coin.<eos> You will be faced with a total of ten puzzles!<eos> Each p...<eos> Each... each puzzle will lead you to the location of the next.<eos> The last of which will lead you to the coin.<eos> The first team that finds it... wins!
Oh, that's clever.<eos> Hurry!<eos> Be there in a minute.<eos> I just have to pre-soak these!<eos> Stop her, Leonard!<eos> Stop her!<eos> Well, where the hell's the coin?<eos> Wasn't the answer Sheldon's spot?<eos> Oh, yes, Leonard.<eos> Yes, it was.
Mr. Creevy and I toured that platform earlier yesterday morning.<eos> I never would've imagined this could happen.<eos> And we've known our platforms might be a potential target for a terrorist attack.<eos> We prepare for it, but it's still shocking.<eos> I think it's a little premature to assume this is an act of terrorism, gentlemen.<eos> I'm sure NCIS is keeping all investigative paths open.<eos> Well, if it was an attack, it wasn't a very strategic one.<eos> How do you mean that?<eos> It's a matter of output and manpower.<eos> That platform produces a fraction of the oil compared to our other rigs on the East Coast, and it's manned by a crew of 60.
Here you go.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Hey, just because I'm passionate doesn't mean I'm right.<eos> Now, see there, Nolan?<eos> A man's man can admit when he's wrong.<eos> Why couldn't you admit you were wrong last night?<eos> I wasn't wrong yet.<eos> I'm sorry, Blake.<eos> Before we go any further, we should talk about something.<eos> We both know that addicts say that their addiction is under control even when it's not.
His name is Also Charlie.<eos> We have had many adventures.<eos> He is muy cansado.<eos> And now he must go to sleep.<eos> Bedroom's upstairs.<eos> Buenas noches, Also Charlie.<eos> All right, Angry Birds.<eos> Let's get this thing going.<eos> Here's your mail.<eos> It's been stacking up since you've been away.
You know what?<eos> I just broke up with my boyfriend for good.<eos> My heart is in pieces.<eos> Sue me for having a moment.<eos> My apologies.<eos> Is the moment over?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Now answer my questions truthfully.<eos> What is the secret society?<eos> It's called Augustine. Augustine?
where Bonnie currently resides, rests on a living, breathing human being that we now need to protect.<eos> We need to protect?<eos> Elena, meet crazy pants.<eos> Crazy pants, meet Elena.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Do you have any idea what it's like watching history repeat itself?<eos> You're hurt.<eos> I can heal you. No, no.<eos> I want this wound.<eos> It's a reminder of what you really are.
Or the 2,000 years part.<eos> Guys, we were both immortal, and now we're not.<eos> Hello?<eos> The point is I finally had the chance to hold Amara in my arms, and what does she do?<eos> She jams a chunk of glass into my carotid artery.<eos> Look, look.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Listen, you two.<eos> Here's my advice. Live it up.<eos> You know, enjoy this love while it lasts because let me tell you something. Just a couple days ago, I was psychic, I was immortal, I was in love.
Start at the bottom just like you asked.<eos> All I require is that you keep your eyes and ears open.<eos> Are you comfortable with that?<eos> My father used to be sheriff.<eos> You were the county treasurer.<eos> Jack Dempsey came to your hotel.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I remember everything.<eos> What do you want, Will?<eos> I want the family to be back where it belongs.
okay, i can do that.<eos> it's no big deal.<eos> just like holding open some slimy elevator doors.<eos> for a family of aliens-- oh, my god.<eos> yep, there are some signs of stress on the heart, but that's not surprising.<eos> oh, will you look at that stomach lining?<eos> god, that is just a beaut.<eos> all right.<eos> i'm gonna need you to go ahead and take your hand... [groans] yep, get it down there.<eos> [groans] get it down there.
Way to go, Lacey.<eos> And what makes you feel like Cleopatra?<eos> Well, she was super strong and, like, super smart and she totally ruled her people and she was great in the sack.<eos> But ultimately, she gave up her entire kingdom for the man that she loved.<eos> Holy hell.<eos> Shut up, Bob.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So, Cleo, I hear your parole hearing didn't go so well.<eos> No, it did not go so well.<eos> No, it did not.
Anyway, thank you for watching it.<eos> It's one of my all-time favorites.<eos> It was very entertaining... despite the glaring story problem.<eos> Story problem?<eos> !<eos> You-- oh, Amy...<eos> What a dewy-eyed moon-calf you are.<eos> Raiders of the Lost Ark is the love child of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas, two of the most gifted filmmakers of our generation.<eos> I've watched it 36 times, except for the snake scene and the face-melting scene, which I can only watch when it's still light out, but... I defy you to find a story problem.<eos> Here's my jaw... drop it.
Stuart and I are putting dating profiles online, and it's one of the questions.<eos> And thank you-<eos> - I'd kill for that woman's bone structure.<eos> Why are you reading Pride and Prejudice?<eos> I'll tell you why.<eos> Amy ruined Raiders of the Lost Ark for me, so now I'm trying to find something beloved to her and ruin that.<eos> Because her life wasn't enough?<eos> Wait... how can, how can anyone ruin Raiders?<eos> Yeah, except for the fact that Indiana Jones is completely irrelevant to the story.<eos> With or without him, the Nazis find the ark, open it and die.

I can't take it anymore.<eos> I think I'm going batshit.<eos> I need to do something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know how this has to go, right?<eos> You were a great guy, Kyle.<eos> But you died.<eos> I didn't let you go when I should have.<eos> I don't understand my power yet.<eos> It's new.
I've always loved you like a daughter.<eos> Wrap your arms around me, dear girl.<eos> Use your power of sight, and you'll see that I could not have done this terrible thing.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.<eos> I don't need magic to tell me what I already know.<eos> I know you would never hurt me.<eos> I never doubted you for a second, and I told my mother that.<eos> My mother set you up.<eos> My blindness gave me real vision, but it's of no use to me now.
What you and your girls demonstrated last night was real grit.<eos> I finally have hope for the future of this coven.<eos> And you, my dear I'm so proud of.<eos> You really are my daughter.<eos> Now you're proud?<eos> Hell... if I knew how easy it was to win your approval, I would have made an attempt on your life way before now.<eos> What's this?<eos> A silver bullet.<eos> I found it last night in the street.<eos> It's blessed. Mm-hmm.
I'm gonna wait for the movie.<eos> We've got to think of something. Zac.<eos> What's happening in there?<eos> Uh, some books fell over.<eos> Then why is the door locked? Is it? Yes.<eos> Unlock the door.<eos> Now, please!<eos> Zac!<eos> This morning, when Rita was talking about the moon rings, water she said something about water.<eos> The power to control water, whatever form it takes, is one of the most important a mermaid can have.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Who calls the shots?<eos> Those bastards think they can steal from me?<eos> Then they're gonna reap what they sow.<eos> Finch, you doing a little spring cleaning?<eos> I wish I was.<eos> I received numbers this morning.<eos> 38 of them, to be precise.<eos> Maybe the machine blew a belt or something.<eos> It's not a lawn mower, Mr. Reese.<eos> It's also never wrong.
It's also never wrong.<eos> While I haven't decoded all the numbers, there does appear to be a common thread.<eos> They're all cops.<eos> Four of them are known members of HR, leaving a high probability that the rest may be as well.<eos> 3 dozen members of HR, all about to commit a violent crime?<eos> Or they've been targeted, and HR is under siege.<eos> Things are about to get chaotic, Mr. Reese.<eos> I've already contacted Ms. Shaw to enlist her assistance.<eos> I'll see if Fusco's heard any rumblings around the Eighth of an HR conflict.<eos> If we could locate the source of the threat, perhaps we could defuse the situation before it escalates.
Go, damn it!<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Why you, Aaron?<eos> The nanites in your body are behaving in a highly individual way, repairing your cells, oxygenating your blood.<eos> But why?<eos> Why only you?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You think of me as your enemy.<eos> But we're partners now.<eos> You know, my father believed there was a magic, invisible power all around us, and if he prayed hard enough, it would grant him a miracle.
Why only you?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You think of me as your enemy.<eos> But we're partners now.<eos> You know, my father believed there was a magic, invisible power all around us, and if he prayed hard enough, it would grant him a miracle.<eos> He was a horrible, stupid man who based his whole life on a fairy tale.<eos> But it's ironic.<eos> Turns out he was right... sort of.<eos> There is an invisible power that can save people.<eos> It just doesn't come from heaven, that's all.
It's a cloaking spell.<eos> It will shield the town, making it impossible for anyone to find.<eos> Well, then how... how will you find your way back to me?<eos> You're not coming back, are you?<eos> The prophecy.<eos> The boy is my undoing.<eos> But he's also my grandson.<eos> I must save him.<eos> (Voice breaking) I understand.<eos> I also know... that the future isn't always what it seems.
I've read about this in my books, but I... I didn't realize it was real, or that Rumple had it.<eos> What is it?<eos> Pandora's box.<eos> Legend says it contains the world's darkest evil.<eos> Shouldn't you be wearing gloves or something?<eos> No, no.<eos> As long as we don't open it, we're fine.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> So what do you think's inside to it?
(Belle and Ariel grunt) Stay still.<eos> I don't understand. Why do we kind of doing what he tells us?<eos> Because he has a gun.<eos> What's a gun?<eos> Trust me, you don't want to find out.<eos> What did Rumplestiltskin tell you about this thing?<eos> I'm not afraid of you or your gun... and not just because I don't know what it is.<eos> Shall we demonstrate?<eos> The box... what is it?<eos> It's magic, which you're only gonna destroy anyway.
- You got it? - Ah! I can!<eos> I can! Let me... got it!<eos> (Whoosh)<eos> See?<eos> That didn't backfire.<eos> Okay.<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Well, the protection spell's still up, so they can't leave Storybrooke.<eos> Well, then what are they gonna do with the box?<eos> (Sighs) Well, if I wanted to make sure it doesn't end up in Neverland, I'd... I'd destroy it.
- But you should have told me.<eos> (Whispers) - I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You didn't believe, David.<eos> (Sighs) You needed to believe in us.<eos> (Emma) So we just wait for Pan's shadow to show up?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And when it does, we'll be prepared.<eos> You wanna tell me how that coconut works?<eos> We light the candle, and the shadow is drawn to it.
I didn't have to worry about passive-aggressive stuff. There was no mind games.<eos> We spoke the same language, you know?<eos> - Yeah. Yeah, a bit like we do.<eos> -Totally.<eos> You and Simmons are so tight, ...like you're psychically linked.<eos> No, you... no. Actually, no.<eos> I don't think so. So, Ward was here?<eos> Let me guess...<eos> the night-night pistol again?<eos> Yeah, and he said it was off by an ounce. Of course he did.
Don't you ever pull a stunt like that again.<eos> We'd hate to lose you, Jemma.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Does that mean we're to leave now?<eos> So, what did you think of your first time skydiving?<eos> Honestly, I'd rather not to think about it anymore.<eos> I thought what you did was incredibly brave.<eos> I suppose now's as good a time as any to tell you that... I may have misled you earlier.<eos> You see, when I gave you back the night-night pistol,<eos> I lied... it's still an ounce off.
Nice to finally put a face to the name.<eos> Likewise.<eos> These are Agents May and Ward.<eos> Well, now that we've gotten that over with, here's what you can know.<eos> The intel you recovered from Agent Shaw tells us that a separatist group from South Ossetia built a weapon called Izbutomiut.<eos> The Overkill Device?<eos> A little dramatic for my taste.<eos> I imagine something was lost in translation.<eos> We've intercepted chatter that tells us they plan to use the weapon in the next 24 hours to declare their independence from Russia and Georgia.<eos> We believe it creates sonic vibrations powerful enough to trigger weapons from a great distance.
Poor girl.<eos> Company.<eos> Yes, I need access to a restricted file.<eos> Bravo Charlie Yankee 3-0-7-6-0-4.<eos> Authorization code.<eos> X-ray 2-8-9-6.<eos> You're looking for a death and recovery report, sir?<eos> Yes, for a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent.<eos> Mostly interested in his recovery.<eos> It took place in Tahiti.
But he thought that he was right.<eos> I'm here now, though.<eos> So.<eos> Great. Who the hell are you?<eos> And do your parents know that you're here?<eos> I'm Barry Allen.<eos> I'm from the Central City police department.<eos> I'm with the crime scene investigation unit.<eos> We're working on a case with some similar unexplained elements in Central City, so when the report of your robbery came over the wire, my captain sent me up here.<eos> And you think one guy ripped through this door like it was tin foil?
Uh, we're going to need a list of the entire inventory here to figure out exactly what was stolen.<eos> Actually, I think I know what was stolen.<eos> A centrifuge.<eos> An industrial centrifuge.<eos> Probably the Cord Enterprises 2BX 900.<eos> Maybe the six series.<eos> Both have a three column base.<eos> Here, you can see the three sets of broken bolts where the thief just... ripped it out of the ground.<eos> And what exactly is a centrifuge?<eos> It separates liquids.
You're gone.<eos> Wherever I am... It's time you joined me.<eos> They say a coward dies a thousand deaths.<eos> But even that wouldn't be enough for you.<eos> I tried to save you!<eos> And her.<eos> But you couldn't.<eos> Just like you couldn't save this city.<eos> The island didn't make you strong, kid.<eos> It revealed you to be weak.
Are all the materials biocompatible?<eos> Depends on the cartridge.<eos> What happens if you, like... you know, pause it?<eos> Start something else?<eos> You'd be stuck with a hunk of junk.<eos> And then Dr. Grey would have to start over, sending her back a whole day in her research, resulting in her desire to murder me.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Great.<eos> Vertebral artery is tortuous.<eos> See, it's compressing the facial nerve which is the source of the twitch.
No bubble.<eos> Should we start to close?<eos> We're not closing.<eos> There's a leak.<eos> There's a leak.<eos> I see a small bubble, so there's a leak.<eos> We'll patch it.<eos> - A bubble?<eos> I don't see anything.<eos> - It's there.
- It's my printer, Cristina.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> It's the hospital's printer, and...<eos> Which I got for them for my research, for my grant.<eos> Which is important research, but at this point, it's research, Meredith.<eos> And what I'm talking about could save a life.<eos> I can't stop it in the middle.<eos> It will completely destroy the model.<eos> Just because I printed a fork does not mean my research is a joke.<eos> No one said it was a joke.
- Ow.<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> Alice?<eos> Alice?<eos> How many did you take?<eos> Alice?<eos> How many pills did you take?<eos> I emptied the packet.<eos> The oysters will be spoiled.<eos> Once it's open...
I'm online on Robert Hayes's computer.<eos> I see it.<eos> - Pakistani tribal region.<eos> - Something tells me they're not looking for places to send Ramadan cards.<eos> Unless they attach it to one of these.<eos> This is not good.<eos> How not good is "not good"?<eos> Very, very not good.<eos> It looks like Hayes used the intel Gary Leonida gave him to gain control of a U.S. Predator drone over Afghanistan.<eos> While a drone's in flight, it sends back continuous information on an encrypted frequency to the person controlling it on the ground.
It looks like Hayes used the intel Gary Leonida gave him to gain control of a U.S. Predator drone over Afghanistan.<eos> While a drone's in flight, it sends back continuous information on an encrypted frequency to the person controlling it on the ground.<eos> That includes GPS coordinates that the drone acquires from several satellites.<eos> If a hacker has the encryption code, he gets into the brain of the drone and sends a false GPS signal back to the ground.<eos> It's called "spoofing."<eos> So the operator thinks he's sending the drone one place when, in fact, the hacker is sending it wherever he wants it to go.<eos> Or they launch its missiles on an unsuspecting target.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Now... it's not fail-safe.<eos> The drone has a camera onboard, so if the operator's alert and the terrain begins to look suspicious, he'll realize that the drone isn't going where it should be.
They do.<eos> Even filled the tanks.<eos> - Tig, check 'em.<eos> - Yeah, you got it.<eos> - West, Quinn, come on.<eos> - Where's Gaalan?<eos> He's meeting us at the hangar.<eos> That's where we're storing the guns for Clay.<eos> Gaalan bringing the shipment with him?<eos> After the takedown, me and Hugh will go to the barn, we'll pick it up, we'll meet you at the hangar.
Oh, we should wait for her lawyer.<eos> I... I-I didn't have time to call him.<eos> Um, and we have to hurry.<eos> Gemma's downstairs waiting for me.<eos> She's already been up here.<eos> We've prepared the WITSEC agreement.<eos> Included your sons.<eos> US Marshals will execute it.<eos> The immunity will come from my office.<eos> Send it to my lawyer.
I live here.<eos> Well, did you... see who brought us in here?<eos> You did.<eos> You walked in on your own.<eos> She was in your arms.<eos> Don't you remember?<eos> No.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I lost the trail.<eos> All right, well, find it.
Brian, I think it's time that Rupert made his choice.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Talking about love, Bri.<eos> Talking about adult decisions.<eos> Rupert's been with me, and now he's been with you.<eos> It's time for him to pick.<eos> Stewie, this is stupid;<eos> I'm not doing this. Brian, either you cooperate or I blow my Adam Levine dog whistle.<eos> Hey, my voice isn't that high.<eos> It is.
You don't got the boobs.<eos> What?<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> Now, just hand me the gun, Sonja.<eos> Oh, I swear to God, you get one inch closer to me, and I'm gonna shoot you.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Like I said, you're going to jail.<eos> Oh, my God, Joe, that was so close.<eos> How'd you know the gun would jam?<eos> It didn't jam, Peter. The gun was never loaded.
I lost a test subject last night.<eos> And you're gonna replace him.<eos> Dear Diary, so here I am, alive.<eos> Stefan saved me from killing myself.<eos> Now he's got me on suicide watch.<eos> He says it will be therapeutic for me to write down my feelings... about the fact that I'm dying and there's nothing I can do about it.<eos> Deep thoughts, mortal coil, blah, blah, blah.<eos> My hand's tired.<eos> What kind of sentimental idiot writes down everything they feel?<eos> Is this what the prophecy meant when it said all the doppelgangers... were drawn together like magnets?
Let me guess.<eos> You're not gonna tell me what phase two is, are you?<eos> If it works, you'll be the first one to know.<eos> Why did Megan have a picture of my dad on her cell phone?<eos> Maybe because her parents helped fund your father's projects.<eos> They knew about Augustine, too?<eos> Well, no.<eos> All they knew was that your dad had an unregulated compound that could cure most injuries.<eos> Vampire blood.<eos> Exactly, but as Megan grew up, she got suspicious, enrolled at Whitmore, roomed with Dr. Gilbert's daughter, and she went to a party at Whitmore house and put her nose where it didn't belong.
How's that for bad cop?<eos> Riveting.<eos> I felt like I was watching Bakery edition.<eos> Okay, here we go. This is the last one.<eos> You want this cronut?<eos> Lift up your shirt and let me see 'em.<eos> Go get Han.<eos> I want to show him what an ab is.<eos> Max, you should see the line.<eos> It's halfway down the block.
Musicians, dancing music.<eos> Enough of this foolishness.<eos> Why would you say that to my friend? Why scare her?<eos> I can only say what I've seen.<eos> Like a dragon and a field of poppies?<eos> Are people fooled by you?<eos> The only dragons are in children's stories.<eos> But why these lies?<eos> Who gains?<eos> The fortune-telling was henry's idea, So it can't have come from catherine.
The only dragons are in children's stories.<eos> But why these lies?<eos> Who gains?<eos> The fortune-telling was henry's idea, So it can't have come from catherine.<eos> Who are you and who do you serve?<eos> The realm... Myself, the truth.<eos> The truth?<eos> Serving the truth at court is a crooked path.<eos> You know, I don't think I ever noticed That tiny white scar on your cheek.<eos> It becomes you. Thank you.
We both know it.<eos> I'm going to be King someday.<eos> Mary is already a Queen. We are rulers.<eos> We need to lead with a clear head and compassion.<eos> We've too much power to let anger and jealousy cloud our judgment. And our situation...<eos> Well, it lets others get between us.<eos> Not if we swear to be true to one another. Not if we promise.<eos> What is an engagement but a promise? And it means nothing.<eos> Because unless it makes sense for France, I can't marry you.<eos> And if a better option arises for Scotland, you need to take it. - It is your duty.
People get weird with breakups.<eos> Trust me, I got this.<eos> - You got this.<eos> - That was Winston.<eos> - Was that you or was that in here, dude?<eos> - That was... Don't do that!<eos> Oh, come on, Obama.<eos> Tanks pull in, tanks pull out.<eos> Babies are born, old people die.<eos> And yet the world keeps spinning and spinning and spinning, and one day, it stops.
- Great!<eos> - But I won't do it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I put it to bed, okay? It's over.<eos> He'll do anything Keaton says.<eos> The letters are too powerful.<eos> I'm lying to my best friend.<eos> And I also feel like I'm betraying the real Keaton, who I really love.<eos> Well, then why did you tell me that whole story, Nick?<eos> Because it's a great story, and I'm a teller of stories.
Are you two close?<eos> We're a team.<eos> I'd do anything for this little guy.<eos> That's got to be the best feeling.<eos> A son looking up to you.<eos> Who wants to grow up to be just like you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Looks like he's growing fast though.<eos> You said you wanted your shot.<eos> Here it is.
Well, mandatory, really.<eos> Why not give her the full S.H.I.E.L.D. Academy experience?<eos> It would be unjust to deny her such a thing.<eos> Information data uploaded.<eos> Let's get going.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Just a mattress, sir?<eos> It's a six-hour long ride to the Fridge.<eos> Fitz added magnetic shielding to the Cage after Simmons had her scare.<eos> If Ms. Hutchins has this power, then that room should keep it from getting out.
I speak from experience.<eos> The shock will burn off.<eos> You will feel... anger.<eos> If there is anything that you can tell us about who your husband may have killed, helping us find that person, that is an excellent way to begin to repair yourself.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I cannot help you.<eos> This message is for Travis Hardwick.<eos> This is Manny Tarkanian.<eos> I have a huge renovation;<eos> it needs to move fast.
A blood tie... linking their spirits together.<eos> And you want me to break the curse... to separate the Horseman from your friend.<eos> According to the Bible, a sin is a transgression of divine law.<eos> That is what the Horseman is, an abomination, walking force; pure sin.<eos> You have the power to pull him out.<eos> Where is your friend now?<eos> I was told you could tell me.<eos> Maybe.<eos> If your connection with your friend is strong enough, I could use it.<eos> It's strong.
Sara was angry.<eos> Ah, she was right.<eos> I am clueless.<eos> I created a new life for myself with Emily and... put her out of my mind completely.<eos> That's not true.<eos> If you didn't care about her, you wouldn't have tried to reach out to her two years ago.<eos> I should've tried harder.<eos> Charlotte, she's working in a bakery to pay for medical bills that are my responsibility.<eos> Dad keeps our legal papers in the city.<eos> I'm gonna dig up that settlement and do what I should've done a long time ago- - Read it.
A simple request from a man that I idolized.<eos> I just... never realized it would blow up into this.<eos> I should have just come out and asked you.<eos> It's not like I didn't suspect that you knew, but the chance that you didn't always stopped me.<eos> (Chuckles) I hate that my first instinct is to protect her after everything she's done!<eos> You're not alone.<eos> Why do we do it?<eos> Because we see the broken and betrayed little girl inside.<eos> I understand if our relationship is finished.<eos> If it is... At least it ended in truth.
Crane, I know what you're thinking.<eos> You have no idea what I'm thinking.<eos> Look, I'm on your side here.<eos> Brooks warned us that he would try to get under our skin.<eos> But how does the Horseman have Katrina's necklace?<eos> Okay, let's start with what we know.<eos> Why would he have this exact necklace?<eos> It was a gift to her.<eos> But not from me.<eos> It was given to her by the man to whom she was once betrothed.
About all the foolish ways that I've tried to manage things.<eos> None of that matters now.<eos> Your brothers, the others who are trapped here, they are our people now.<eos> If we are to rule as king and queen, we must trust each other to do what is necessary.<eos> I believe that you can lead them to safety.<eos> Believe that I can get myself out of that room.<eos> My God, Mary...<eos> Promise me you won't come back.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Once the door is shut, it cannot be opened again from the outside.
I thought you'd try to make him pay.<eos> And since I've lost everyone who's ever tried, I... I didn't want to lose you, too.<eos> Look, I don't want to tell you how to live your life.<eos> But if you keep digging, you'll put yourself in danger.<eos> It's more than that, Jack.<eos> Telling that story would mean letting you go, and I'm not willing to do that.<eos> There'll be other stories, but there is only one Jack Porter.<eos> Well, this is it.<eos> Last chance to skip this silly tradition.<eos> It's not silly.

♪ All dressed in fun tuxes from my Pepper collection ♪<eos> Ha, wow -- Look at all your ideas.<eos> Honey, this is just the index.<eos> Ronaldo!<eos> I brought linens and place settings and invitations and stemware.<eos> Hello. I'm Ronaldo.<eos> Oh, don't be such a chatterbox. And go and fetch the platter box.<eos> Now, let's lose this couch.<eos> Wow, you need that much space, huh?<eos> No, it's hideous.
That didn't help.<eos> Man, I came on too strong. Gosh dang it!<eos> My dad warned me about that when I turned 14.<eos> He said, "son, you're about to be the man of the family.<eos> "You got to learn to give people time to see how special you are."<eos> Why were you the man of the family?<eos> - He sort of died.<eos> - How?<eos> I don't want to bring you down, little man. Neither did my dad.<eos> He'd say, "my disease can't be all bad if it rhymes with 'answer.'"
No.<eos> No.<eos> You two are both terrible people.<eos> Who found each other in this crazy world.<eos> And who lie about how they found each other.<eos> Please, leave now. Just...<eos> You know what?<eos> You're right, we shouldn't have lied about our story.<eos> I love our story.<eos> Sure, it's messy, but it's the story that got us here, about to get married.
Did I see a ghost?<eos> - Of course...<eos> - Yes.<eos> There's... Are.<eos> ...such thing as ghosts.<eos> So, have you seen the ghost?<eos> Not yet, but that might just be because ghosts don't exist, Marshall!<eos> So explain the night shirt we saw flying around our cabin in the Poconos.<eos> An owl got stuck in it.<eos> We saw it fly out the neck hole.
Maybe it ended up, uh, rat kibble.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You see this jagged tear mark?<eos> It's longer than the others and discolored along the edges.<eos> I think it was torn off.<eos> All right, go back to, uh, page one.<eos> Let's see if we can work out who wrote this.<eos> There. "George, George P."" Is that a P?<eos> It's good, all we got to do is find George P. if he's alive, and maybe he can tell us what happened.<eos> And if that page is just missing or it was actually torn out deliberately.
No, but I'm guessing he must've paid his brother a visit at the camp, and then used his access to rip off some internees.<eos> What else you got on Archer?<eos> Well, he was in and out of trouble his whole life.<eos> Mostly petty stuff, uh...<eos> property and auto theft.<eos> Uh, then in 1952, he graduated to the big time and was arrested for murder.<eos> He died in Halawa serving out a life sentence.<eos> We need to run down that homicide report.<eos> I'm way ahead of you.<eos> The murder weapon was a .38, and it's still in HPD custody.
Good luck.<eos> Mahalo, cuz... for everything.<eos> I just got off the phone with Kono.<eos> She's heading to Seattle.<eos> New lead?<eos> We'll see.<eos> So where are we at?<eos> Okay, according to Fong, the barrel our vic was found in was filled with lye.<eos> Surprise, it's highly corrosive.<eos> It's also cheap and easy to get.
Not when it involves Conrad.<eos> All I'm asking is that if she contacts you,<eos> - don't give her any leads.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Roommate-proofing.<eos> Aiden Mathis is moving in.<eos> - Are you kidding me?<eos> - He's a decent guy. Who caused me to send my son away.<eos> Well, maybe that's not a bad thing.<eos> You don't have to worry about Carl's safety till the wedding's over, and when it is, they'll leave, and you won't ever have to see Aiden again.
Oh, I'm not your pilot.<eos> He went for a stroll.<eos> Well, get him back. Years ago, I used to smuggle small shipments of Oaxaca Highland Gold into this airstrip.<eos> Beautiful space.<eos> Bumpy as hell.<eos> You know, Mr. Wolff, I admire your commitment.<eos> Others may doubt you, may think your revolutionary talk is just that, talk to cover your greed, but I think not.<eos> You really do want this country's financial system to fail.<eos> And if I'm not mistaken, you've come up with an ingenious way to make that happen.<eos> No doubt the feds are congratulating themselves this very minute for recovering the blueprint they assume is real but you and I know it's not. it's a fake.
I like money.<eos> I like the lifestyle it affords me.<eos> I like the things that happen when you give it away.<eos> What becomes of you and General Ludd once you board that plane is none of my concern, though it is worth noting that a true Luddite would burn the plane rather than fly in it.<eos> But whatever, your irony.<eos> At any rate, have a safe flight and buckle up.<eos> This runway is a bitch.<eos> You got the tail number?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Send it to Agent Keen.
Hilton Wells doesn't speak with the Egyptians.<eos> He hasn't since he aligned himself with Mubarak during the Arab Spring.<eos> I can show you the transcripts.<eos> With all due respect, if the intel were worth having, then I would have it.<eos> There's a price on your head.<eos> There's a running price on my head, Agent Ressler.<eos> Anslo Garrick?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> If this intel was disseminated, it was done so directly to you.<eos> It's canned, which means Anslo Garrick intends to attack this facility.
Red, this time you are quite simply mistaken.<eos> The question really is, how long are you going to hold out?<eos> Are you really going to let Agent Ressler there just expire?<eos> Are you really going to let me put<eos> Assistant Director Cooper's head all over that wall?<eos> How many people are going to die here today, Reddington?<eos> What's happening?<eos> Your heart is pumping harder and harder, trying to compensate for blood loss.<eos> And that shotgun blast broke your leg.<eos> I think it also partially ruptured your femoral artery.
And neither can you.<eos> Really?<eos> How did that feel?<eos> Like a tickle.<eos> How is he?<eos> You're gonna be all right, Henry.<eos> We're gonna get you home.<eos> You, um, you wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> All right, well, if this is about Pongo's dog license, I... I believe it's still up-to-date.
Homo!<eos> - We want the jumping castle!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Any of you kids speak English?<eos> How would you feel about being the owners of that bouncy castle?<eos> I'd say what we do<eos> I need you to do me a little favour.<eos> Right you know the muriburi puppet show thing?<eos> I need you to break it up.<eos> Really just ruin it... completely.
They said that you came to pump a little iron.<eos> -Yes, that's part of the rehab.<eos> I've been so stressed lately.<eos> I've had an accident, I'm waiting on disability.<eos> -Ok.<eos> Ok,I'mgoingtodeliver.<eos> But if my back goes out, you get to pay the physiotherapist!<eos> I'm a hundred meters from the top, and I take off my boot and sock.<eos> I look down at my toe.<eos> It is black as night.
That's her honey.<eos> I'm gonna help her.<eos> Pussy!<eos> You have to talk to Torgeir about that...<eos> Was a little... Was not so much...<eos> -Is intelligence a hobby you also have?<eos> Brother, a friend has seen him shop here every Friday..<eos> What is going on?<eos> Do you know what happened to the last curious cat?<eos> It was paralyzed from the waist down.
- I don't want to listen to this. - We haven't finished talking.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> Wait!<eos> Jonas, we have to leave now.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> Would you also like travel insurance?<eos> That could be a good idea cover gunshot wounds?<eos> I'm going to New York.<eos> Don't you read the papers?<eos> It covers laceration, sprains, fractures, wounds.
You know, like everyone on the Internet.<eos> All my mother wants is for me to be happily married like my father and her.<eos> All my mother wants is a cure for hep-C.<eos> Look, here she is.<eos> "Korean beauty June Kim, aka Sapphire"?<eos> Han, you chose a prostitute?<eos> She's not a prostitute.<eos> She has a website.<eos> Yeah, and I know a guy with business cards whose "job" it is to relax your rectum.<eos> It says she's an exotic dancer at this gentlemen's club in Manhattan.
What is it?<eos> The heart of the thing I love most.<eos> You mean your son's heart?<eos> Rumplestiltskin?<eos> No, no.<eos> I... I never loved Rumple.<eos> Well, then whose heart do we need?<eos> Who do you love?<eos> Love can mean many things, Felix.<eos> It doesn't just come from romance or family.

I never loved Rumple.<eos> Well, then whose heart do we need?<eos> Who do you love?<eos> Love can mean many things, Felix.<eos> It doesn't just come from romance or family.<eos> It can also come from loyalty.
Have faith.<eos> That's easy to say when you have magic wings and a wand.<eos> What can we do but choose to believe her?<eos> This was supposed to be hers.<eos> We had such plans.<eos> Listen to Blue.<eos> Have hope we can prevail.<eos> This curse has destroyed every dream this family ever had.<eos> Well, you don't know what the future holds for us.<eos> How do you know that it holds anything good?
Henry?<eos> I can never see him again.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> I have to undo what I started.<eos> The curse that brought us to Storybrooke.<eos> That created Storybrooke.<eos> It doesn't belong here.<eos> And neither do any of us.<eos> Breaking the curse destroys the town.<eos> It will wink out of existence as though it were never here.
With all your magic?<eos> Why are you asking all these questions?<eos> Because I might need that stuff to protect myself from Pan.<eos> Oh, honey, he can't hurt you.<eos> He's locked up in Gold's shop.<eos> But what if he gets out?<eos> What if he finds a way to come after me?<eos> Magic isn't the answer.<eos> My vault is sealed shut for a reason.<eos> It's dangerous.
I was so focused on finding a way to beat Regina, that I almost lost the thing I could never live without... you.<eos> You damn well almost did.<eos> Almost.<eos> How can I ever make it up to you?<eos> Well, now that you mention it... I've got a few ideas.<eos> No, I'm afraid, we're closed.<eos> Whatever crisis you're dealing with,<eos> - I'm done for the day.<eos> - Rumple.<eos> Pandora's box... give it to me.
'Cause he'll lie right to your face.<eos> Big smile, "Cross my heart, hope to die."<eos> It's creepy.<eos> I checked his homework.<eos> And don't worry,<eos> I've already made inquiries about a tutor.<eos> By the way, I took your car...<eos> Oh, Mom, I barely have enough gas in there to get to work.<eos> That's why I took it.<eos> I filled it up, got it washed, the oil light was on... (Sighs) It's always on.

(Sighs) It's always on.<eos> Actually, it goes off when you put oil in it.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system-- a machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
My men will have every subway, train, and road from Queens blocked.<eos> This ends one way, and it's not with you riding into the sunset.<eos> Your men are looking for three people.<eos> We just need better camouflage.<eos> Mr. Reese?<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> Ms. Shaw, I'm afraid I've lost contact with Mr. Reese.<eos> Well, at the risk of stating the obvious, Finch, you could just ask the machine for his location.<eos> I don't speak to the machine, and the machine doesn't speak to me, Ms. Shaw.<eos> Well, it speaks to her.
You touch him, and I'll send you to hell.<eos> Is that a promise? Huh?<eos> Because when I make a promise, I keep it.<eos> Where's the safe deposit box?<eos> Which bank?<eos> Or I kill you and your kid.<eos> You know what?<eos> Put the kid out of his misery before he turns out like his old man.<eos> Okay, okay, okay!<eos> Bank's in Hoboken, Jefferson and 9th, but it won't be open this time of night.
You do realize we gotta kill HR before we can autopsy them.<eos> Apply the right amount of force, this can do some damage.<eos> Hezbollah surgeon. 2 more inches to the left, would've cut right through my axillary artery.<eos> Fallujah.<eos> 300-pound gorilla of a Marine escorting me.<eos> One minute, we're walking on patrol, and the next, I hear a click.<eos> Land mine?<eos> Guy looked right into my eyes, then he was dust.<eos> Never saw it coming.<eos> When your time is up, it's up.
Calculable.<eos> In life?<eos> In life.<eos> Where else?<eos> Does it scare you?<eos> No.<eos> But I often think...<eos> What?<eos> I wish for a different sexual treatment.<eos> My sexuality isn't yet where it should be.
What? He told you to run if anyone ever asked about him.<eos> He wanted to protect you.<eos> I am really not here to hurt you.<eos> I just need some information about your father.<eos> What kind of information?<eos> We could start with where he told you to go if anything happened to him.<eos> He told me to go to a place called Hillcrest.<eos> Camp Hillcrest in Virginia?<eos> There's a cabin there.<eos> The guy that owns it is supposed to help me.
Um, low table.<eos> Whoop. And here is the couch.<eos> Bedroom, bathroom to the left.<eos> What is it?<eos> It smells like you. Do you want a drink?<eos> The wine--oh, wait.<eos> I want you to know I'm sorry about Annie.<eos> I know how much it meant to you, and I did try.<eos> Calder got her the intel. That was the important part.<eos> When I told you our marriage wasn't real, that it was a cover, I was lying.
Yeah, these are ours.<eos> Any way to tell where they were going?<eos> - This is for crateology?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Take a look.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, this shipment was airlifted to Kandahar?<eos> Yeah, out of Dover Air Force base.<eos> And how did it get from here to Dover?
Freeze.<eos> You're under arrest. No.<eos> Move... so I can shoot you.<eos> I'm not carrying a cell.<eos> This bike's untraceable.<eos> How'd you find me?<eos> We didn't.<eos> My daughter did.<eos> Say hello... to her Happy Cat "Friend Alert" watch.<eos> It's Bluetooth enabled.

- Okay, you drilled right through her leg into the table.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> No, it's... back it up.<eos> Just put the drill in reverse.<eos> - I... I can't...<eos> - Put the drill in reverse!<eos> I can't find the... can you just take it?<eos> - My hand is shaking.<eos> - Okay, all right.<eos> - Pull it together...
What are you talking about?<eos> The Creator will soon return.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> What's going on here?<eos> My infernal partner is telling me he's hungry!<eos> He'd be quite satisfied with a catch like you.<eos> It's dinnertime, my sweet.<eos> Oh, I forgot. There's another reason why I'm hunting you.<eos> I take pleasure from watching your face distort with pain.<eos> Transform the world into what it should be...
We're not getting anywhere.<eos> Hey, Daddy. Is Mummy here?<eos> If you're a good girl, Mummy will come for you very soon.<eos> Cereza's a good girl!<eos> You can wait on your own?<eos> Of course!<eos> Cheshire. It's okay, right?<eos> Please come quickly, Mummy.<eos> I don't recall this bar being here.<eos> It's a temporary outpost.
Right now?<eos> Smart?<eos> No.<eos> But since when is that the criteria?<eos> Well, you're a big girl.<eos> You can do what you want.<eos> As long as I'm not on the wrong end of it.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> In spite of what your boyfriend says, this limo driver thing...<eos> It isn't over.
She may not have been aware of the intruder.<eos> Have you searched the residence?<eos> We have men in there now, but there's no sign of a break-in.<eos> What's the idea here?<eos> Cynthia Tilden, I'm Sherlock Holmes.<eos> We spoke on the phone last night.<eos> You asked us to meet with you today.<eos> I don't know either one of these people.<eos> I've never seen them before.<eos> Your voice, it's different.
Captain Gregson, NYPD.<eos> Now, I tried to be reasonable with you people, but I guess that was a mistake.<eos> What is he doing here?<eos> I'm accusing you of serial murder.<eos> Oh, again?<eos> You know he's not supposed to be within a hundred feet of me?<eos> Yeah, we worked that out when the judge issued this warrant.<eos> So, when you bought this place, it was home to a failed Internet startup company.<eos> Over the years, it's been put to many different uses, but of course, the square footage has always remained the same.<eos> Until it mysteriously shrank.
so you were looking for a new job?<eos> nope.<eos> weird.<eos> they just offered you captain without considering anyone else?<eos> like scully... because he's got so many years on the force.<eos> hey, guys, i think i put my gun in one of these boxes, and i don't know which.<eos> you have a problem with me that you want to talk about? me?<eos> no, i am just filing evidence, sir.<eos> found my gun.<eos> it was in my holster.
Pissed?<eos> Oh, no, I'm not pissed.<eos> Everyone always thinks I'm so dramatic.<eos> "There's always something wrong with Patrick."<eos> Well, I'm sorry, folks.<eos> No show today.<eos> All right.<eos> Lacey, what's going on with you?<eos> I am dying of loneliness.<eos> Ah, there it is.
You ready?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> 202-555-0163.<eos> It's encrypted.<eos> I can't hack it.<eos> So how do we get access?<eos> We need a warrant.<eos> A warrant?<eos> What are you talking about, like going to a judge?<eos> Who said anything about a judge? I said we need a warrant, I didn't say it needed to be real.
It's my first day too.<eos> Caroline, please, I can't hear Han talking about Max, okay?<eos> Here you go, darling, a book bag for school.<eos> So what, then? Is my surprise party after this one?<eos> What is happening?<eos> People doing nice things for me and smiling?<eos> Am I transferring foster homes again?<eos> And there's more stuff inside. That was supposed to be a surprise too.<eos> Oh.<eos> Max, open it.
Excuse me?<eos> Lifespans.<eos> Dragonfly is four months. Honeybee is four weeks.<eos> Well, so long as you don't go mayfly on me, we won't have a problem.<eos> Are you new?<eos> Or have I just forgotten you?<eos> You haven't forgotten me.<eos> Oh, well, give it time.<eos> My mind, it's like a computer with a corrupted file system.<eos> I know I want to remember something, and I go to open the file, and then it's just gone.
Have you lost someone?<eos> My closest friend.<eos> There was an accident.<eos> I was with him.<eos> I'm very sorry, Mr. Wren.<eos> Do you have someone to comfort you during this time?<eos> I was in a relationship, but that's over now.<eos> The emotional fallout from these types of traumas can be extensive.<eos> Which brings us to your question- grief.<eos> Whether it has a purpose.
There has not been a day since<eos> - that I haven't regretted...<eos> - You're right.<eos> I am a drunk.<eos> Sir...<eos> I'm an alcoholic, which is why I'm here now instead of home.<eos> It's boring there, and lonely.<eos> And when I'm bored and lonely, I wanna have a drink.<eos> Hell, I wanted to have a drink when I'm happy, too.<eos> I always want a drink, because I have a disease, and it can't be cured.
Zack from organ concepts, and Jamie from new media.<eos> Hey, everybody.<eos> - Hi, how's it going?<eos> - Hi, Rick. So, pirates of the pancreas.<eos> Yeah. Talk to me.<eos> Hey, Rick.<eos> It's Alejandro speaking.<eos> Um, so, we asked ourselves, internally we asked ourselves over here,<eos> "okay, what does a pancreas do?"<eos> And the answer was, "does it make pirates?" No, it makes Insulin, you know?
No need.<eos> You've expressed your feelings quite clearly.<eos> - Your Majesty.<eos> You did well, delivering Mary's letters to me.<eos> Let's make it a permanent arrangement. Oh, look.<eos> Oh, they're launching their boats.<eos> Regrets are everywhere. How apt.<eos> Are you all right, Mary? No.<eos> Regret is a terrible feeling.<eos> And though I've sent my ship off, I am still filled with it.
Only a member of the Sisterhood would possess such an item.<eos> Seriously.<eos> The librarian from the Historical Society was a witch?<eos> Just as Reverend Knapp was before her, embedded in Sleepy Hollow for centuries.<eos> Explains her expression, recognition.<eos> She knew who you were.<eos> Whatever is in there, it reeks of anger and pain and death stronger than anything I've felt in years.<eos> He will make sure that you are safe.<eos> This drawing.<eos> It's familiar.
The saint's name is a sign.<eos> When you know my name war will take form.<eos> Then the end of days begins.<eos> There will be no end of days.<eos> - You hear me?<eos> - Your death is assured.<eos> You and the second witness.<eos> Face me, coward!<eos> I touched her soul once.<eos> Soon it will be mine forever.
- This says "guppy pond."<eos> - Guppy pond.<eos> - Guppy pond. - What is a guppy pond?<eos> It's only the- the coolest gift ever.<eos> I want a Puppy Pound.<eos> Um, honey, it's-<eos> Okay. I am not pointing fingers, but our daughter... had exactly one thing on her list... and someone didn't get it... so someone needs to go to the mall.<eos> - You're pointing fingers.<eos> - No. It's still a one.<eos> It just fell asleep on the job.
- Yeah. Hey, take a break.<eos> - This is taking forever.<eos> It's supposed to.<eos> Took my dad and I all day to get a tree.<eos> And when he finally brought her down... he used to celebrate with a cigar.<eos> I was just a kid, so I'd have a cigarette.<eos> All right, grab the other end.<eos> There we go.<eos> Now we got a groove.<eos> - It won't budge! - What the hell is this wood made of?
Sheldon, did you just figure out a method for synthesizing a new stable super-heavy element?<eos> Did I?<eos> Well, that can't be right.<eos> No one's ever done that before.<eos> Except me because I just did it!<eos> ♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah<eos> ♪ Sheldon and his brain, yeah!<eos> I've made a horrible mistake.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This table, it's in square centimeters
Uh, I got you a coffee.<eos> Can I get you anything else?<eos> Uh, one-one of these muffins?<eos> They're bran.<eos> Keeps your trains running on time.<eos> Poop-poop! I'm not hungry.<eos> All right then, I'll just sit across from you.<eos> Right here... in front of all these witnesses.<eos> You know my girlfriend Lyndsey?<eos> Is it Lyndsey?
Mr. Dylan stated in a deposition given from his hospital bed that you discovered that information from his phone.<eos> Which you accessed without a warrant.<eos> Would it surprise you to learn that James Dylan is lying?<eos> Not necessarily.<eos> But you do tend to attract people who lie about your illegal behavior.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Why, you did.<eos> That's my phone!<eos> According to your outgoing calls, you regularly contact the same local number several times a week.<eos> It has a 477 prefix.
Why, you did.<eos> That's my phone!<eos> According to your outgoing calls, you regularly contact the same local number several times a week.<eos> It has a 477 prefix.<eos> That's the same as our precinct.<eos> It's a municipal number.<eos> Yeah, you stole this.<eos> Your calendar says you have a recurring commitment every Tuesday.<eos> Now, there's no heading on that appointment, so my first thought was weekly Brazilian, but then I noticed the address of the Tuesday rendezvous.<eos> It's 202 Broadway, which, as it turns out, is the office of the New York State Division of Parole.
Her heart was enlarged.<eos> She would have started to feel symptoms of congestive heart failure.<eos> Could her enlarged heart have been a result of her cancer?<eos> Not directly.<eos> And everything in her records looked normal from a few months previous.<eos> What, then, do you think caused the change?<eos> Well, it's not unusual for it to be a side effect of certain chemotherapy drugs, especially more aggressive treatments.<eos> Treatments such as the ones Rada was receiving on the drug trial run by Dr. Phineas Hobbs?<eos> The drug was in stage one trials.<eos> Typically, an experimental drug becomes hugely profitable once it gets to stage two.
That's because I was rebelling against conservative parents.<eos> If you want to rebel against me, you're gonna have to do something crazy like wear granny panties and not sleep with all the guys at Spencer's Gifts.<eos> All right, guys, give me all your stuff.<eos> If I don't leave in five minutes, I'm gonna be two and a half hours late for lunch with my mom.<eos> - Here. I want these.<eos> - Hello, cousin, who qualifies for my employee discount.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> My boss is watching.<eos> We're not cousins who have sex.<eos> Just because society doesn't understand our love does not mean it's not real.
And once a strawberry milk shake and a buttload of McNuggets.<eos> I think you'd been up all night.<eos> It was adorable.<eos> Well, it was nice meeting you.<eos> I'll send you my new contact info.<eos> Or some other country.<eos> Why don't you love me?<eos> Well, for starters, there's the screaming.<eos> Look at your line.<eos> It doesn't move.
There is another solution, Valéry.<eos> The dissolution of the Assembly.<eos> A new election would give you the majority, without de Gaulle and Pompidou's ghosts.<eos> Michel...<eos> We'd lose that election.<eos> My advance on Mitterrand is not significant.<eos> The French aren't stupid.<eos> If a majority is needed for their new president, they'll give it.<eos> But I already have it.<eos> It needs to be appeased, and that's why I want Chirac.
Beg your pardon?<eos> One of the many folk names for the Osage orange.<eos> Squirrels rip the fruit apart, spreading the seeds and the sap on the ground.<eos> This park is the only place in the vicinity of Ms. Nuñez's apartment where one is likely to find one of these.<eos> So you think whoever shot her walked through here on his way to her apartment.<eos> And perhaps again when he left.<eos> Isn't that Alfredo's ringtone?<eos> Yes, he's been harassing me.<eos> I promised I would go to a meeting with him yesterday, but the investigation took precedence.<eos> It still does.

And a little empathy crept in.<eos> That's what's supposed to happen.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> You want to help Detective Bell, but he won't let you.<eos> That is a good instinct to have.<eos> Why not try to apply it somewhere else?<eos> Being a sponsor means being available.<eos> You know me.<eos> You know my work.<eos> It's all-consuming.
Come in.<eos> Frank Da Silva.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> As in, Deputy Commissioner Da Silva?<eos> Captain Gregson was nice enough to lend us his office so that we could speak privately.<eos> What do you know about my division, Detective?<eos> I got a pretty good idea.<eos> You're in charge of an intelligence unit?<eos> Surveillance?<eos> It's called the Demographics Unit.
I wouldn't speak. I wouldn't defend myself.<eos> I wanted to pay the price.<eos> For not having saved my mum.<eos> Then I went to jail.<eos> He did it.<eos> The descent is the hard part.<eos> And this one is a hell of a drop.<eos> It was too soon.<eos> His shoulder is still bad.<eos> It could dislocate.
- Do what you like. - OK.<eos> Victor?<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> - Sit down.<eos> - Aren't you eating with me?<eos> I'm not eating on my own.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Your thyme crust is delicious.<eos> How do you make it creamy like that?
I can't stand emotional outpourings.<eos> Come on.<eos> What?<eos> Does everyone have to get involved in everything here?<eos> She's alright.<eos> Back to work.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> Go on.<eos> The aubergine?<eos> Deseeded, so it's not squidgy.
She may care for Francis, but Mary will wed the next king of France.<eos> That's no way to win a woman.<eos> It worked for him. Why not you?<eos> God bless us all.<eos> There is news sent to us by Cardinal Tesson, the papal emissary. In England, the Tudor queen is dying.<eos> TESSON: While she has not named her successor...<eos> Many suspect, and believe, the rightful heir to the English throne is you, Mary Stuart.<eos> (applause)<eos> The second England's queen dies, you will make your claim.<eos> Your marriage to my son will strengthen that claim, as it will show the world that you have the might of France at your side.
I mean, I-I'm sorry, I've admired you for a very long time, but that is not a good move, at all, with a valuable negative.<eos> Sorry, I just...<eos> I-I thought it would be a playful kind of thing.<eos> Playful?<eos> I see what you're saying.<eos> With the cover, I should have been more straightforward.<eos> I mean, if you don't mind... what did you do with the wallet?<eos> Chucked it.<eos> Well, that hurts my feelings.<eos> No... man, I liked it very much.
I can see Fontainebleau in the distance...<eos> I will hurry to the palace and fetch you an escort!<eos> Go, and do not fear for me;<eos> I am Don Carlo's betrothed. I can trust the honour of a Spaniard!<eos> Page, hurry to the palace!<eos> This man will protect the daughter of your King!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> In war, when the sky is our only shelter, we have to beg the earth for kindling!<eos> The wood has given us the spark we need and the flame is burning brightly!<eos> When it shines this brightly on the battlefield, it heralds victory or love!
You died in my arms.<eos> It was dark, I was driving.<eos> It was dark, I was driving, and then he put his hands into my legs and I took the steering wheel.<eos> I forgot, this came for you.<eos> Yes?<eos> I didn't wake you, did I?<eos> I want you to call Humphrey's office tomorrow.<eos> I need to see him first thing.<eos> I really have to play this part.<eos> It's a good part for you.
You are really strong.<eos> No! It's mine.<eos> - Please!<eos> Wait.<eos> - It's dying!<eos> I can fix it! -No! I caught it!<eos> Please! Please.<eos> I hate the dark.<eos> Come on, come on, come on.<eos> It does what you tell it?
Eep.<eos> Let me clarify, Eep.<eos> The world is ending.<eos> What?<eos> I'm calling it "The End."<eos> How do you know?<eos> I have seen it.<eos> It's coming this way.<eos> First, the ground is going to shake.<eos> Then it breaks open.
What!<eos> You can't keep me inside forever!<eos> He said this would happen.<eos> Get to the cave!<eos> Go!<eos> Look out!<eos> Stop!<eos> Is everyone okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Grug, the cave... it's gone.
GIRL 1:<eos> His parents won't even let him play with other kids.<eos> GIRL 2:<eos> I know.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Sweetie.<eos> How can I help you if you won't let me in?<eos> The world's too big, Mom.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Then make it small.
GIRL 2:<eos> I know.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Sweetie.<eos> How can I help you if you won't let me in?<eos> The world's too big, Mom.<eos> MARTHA:<eos> Then make it small.<eos> Just, um focus on my voice.<eos> Pretend it's an island out in the ocean.
Significant decreases in the red and white blood cells in the animals?<eos> Yes, but its effect on the virus is better than anything else that's been tested.<eos> Well, in '64, when AZT was developed as a cancer treatment, it was shelved clue to lack of anti-cancer efficacy and toxicity.<eos> Right. We believe those problems were dosage based.<eos> So, you're gonna conduct another animal study?<eos> Actually, the FDA's given us permission to go straight to human trials. Which is what brings me here today.<eos> We're conducting a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized trial throughout the United States.<eos> Dallas Mercy is one of the proposed sites.<eos> How long do you see the trial going on?<eos> We're hoping to fast track it. Within a year?
That guy who works at the taco cart.<eos> Shall I go on?<eos> Okay, okay!<eos> Tomorrow is my last day?<eos> Most likely.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, shit.<eos> Miss Proctor, it's been a delight.<eos> Roy, thank you very much for your mentorship.<eos> I'm sure it meant a lot to you.
Please, come in.<eos> They call me Christian grey.<eos> How do you like my blue room?<eos> It's red.<eos> I'm color-blind.<eos> My decorator assured me that... Never mind.<eos> Champagne?<eos> Have a seat.<eos> I'll stand.<eos> Hey, Christian, man, golly, man! I'd like to thank you a lot, man, for working on my prostrate like it was a speed bag.
- It's cloudy.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Make the words yours.<eos> If your eyes could speak... what would they say?<eos> It's a pale day.<eos> "Pale." Good.<eos> Go on.<eos> Everything's stuck behind a cloud.<eos> Und the sun... doesn't look like the sun.<eos> What does it look like?
Just make it happen, man.<eos> Okay, Okay-<eos> But, Gerry, I still don't know where you are.<eos> Well, go and find out what he needs.<eos> You're gonna want to take this.<eos> Take it.<eos> Your battery is dead.<eos> We made contact with Cardiff Airport, Wales.<eos> Your people directed us.<eos> There is W.H.O. research facility nearby, but they are not sure it's still operational.
Yes, it's Ronin.<eos> I think he looks silly kneeling, too, but I can't get him to stop doing it.<eos> I think the Boggans are scouting our defenses.<eos> You know they'd do anything to stop you from choosing an heir.<eos> But don't worry, I've got a plan.<eos> When we were kids he wasn't so serious.<eos> Would you like to hear my plan?<eos> And he had the sweetest smile.<eos> Look, instead of a public ceremony, I go in with a small platoon... pretend we're stopping for a drink. We grab a pod, bring it back to you.<eos> It blooms, the life of the forest continues.
What's happening there?<eos> They know.<eos> Get Jason in protective custody.<eos> They'll have people on the inside.<eos> Don't you worry about him.<eos> We're on it.<eos> We got units coming to him now.<eos> Already got the prison on lockdown. He's in an isolation cell.<eos> Locate a second number.<eos> It's 517 555-0199.
- Snow.<eos> - Right.<eos> So, what crops are the do-gooders inspecting under Frosty?<eos> Sir, exfils are like abortions.<eos> You don't wanna need one.. . ...but when you do, you don't do it yourself.<eos> You have a better plan?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Whatever the conflicting signals from Iran today and for that matter, every day about whether the hostages will or will not be tried as spies the government of the United States has not deviated from its basic demand:<eos> The hostages must be freed.<eos> --claims to defend human rights, it not only does not defend them.. .

You're divorced?<eos> Taking time off.<eos> He needs to be, you know. .. ...where he is.<eos> Kids need the mother.<eos> They caught the shah's chief of security trying to get on a plane to Paris. Listen.<eos> Since the incident, the number of guards at the airport has doubled.<eos> Thorough background examinations should be expected.<eos> The movie cover isn't strong enough yet.<eos> I need another week, Jack.<eos> You don't have it.
Invasion?<eos> Man, you all must be tripping.<eos> What is your mission?<eos> Look dude, I just follow the paycheck, you know what I'm saying? - What is this device?<eos> - Oh, that's my kick-ass cellphone.<eos> That is not a computer.<eos> This is a computer.<eos> No man. Dat's ancient history, homie.<eos> I am telling you once again..<eos> One moment we received conformation that the ship had landed successfully on the moon. The next, all communications stopped. - As though it had simply vanished.
- You don't believe me?<eos> Watch the movies.<eos> Movies don't lie.<eos> Not the shoes, Jesus.<eos> Vivian, this is the Secretary of Defense.<eos> - Defend and hold that Helium-3 at all costs.<eos> - But against who?<eos> Against everybody.<eos> Unfortunately that's the story of revenge.<eos> It's messy. Never really works out the way you want it to.
Ronson's down.<eos> He needs medical evac.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Is it there?<eos> Hard drive's gone.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> It's gone.
And the truth is that what I see frightens me.<eos> I'm frightened because our enemies are no longer known to us.<eos> They do not exist on a map.<eos> They're not nations.<eos> Look around you. Who do you fear?<eos> Can you see a face?<eos> A uniform? A flag?<eos> No.<eos> Our world is not more transparent now.<eos> It's more opaque.

Nobody likes scientists.<eos> They like what science gives them, but not the questions, no.<eos> Not the questions that science asks.<eos> Actually, I have a question.<eos> That is why you are a scientist.<eos> I was doing my experiment, my project, and the first time it worked great, but the next time it didn't.<eos> I mean, it sort of worked, but then it didn't.<eos> And I don't know why.<eos> Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.<eos> People think science is here, but it is also here.
And I don't know why.<eos> Then maybe you never really understood it the first time.<eos> People think science is here, but it is also here.<eos> The first time, did you love your experiment?<eos> And the second time?<eos> No. I just wanted it over.<eos> Then you changed the variables.<eos> I was doing it for the wrong reason.<eos> Science is not good or bad, Victor.<eos> But it can be used both ways.
Bob?<eos> - Amen.<eos> - Amen.<eos> Yes, it's a ritual all right, complete with live sacrifice.<eos> - Would that be Dolly or Owen?<eos> - It's whoever says I do.<eos> Can someone remind me which Bigham twin is which?<eos> Joseph says Tiger has a moustache.<eos> I was told once that Tony has a tattoo.<eos> Although, it's never been located.
I mean, really!<eos> That's all very well, but I'm afraid not, Dolly, all the same.<eos> - Can't it eat dried peas or something?<eos> I don't think a tortoise...<eos> Owen, please stop hovering like that.<eos> It... I mean she likes to eat water biscuits. I know that for a fact.<eos> And these big liners are loaded with them.<eos> Well, that may be so, but if you will forgive me for doing so, I'm afraid I've told Millman we are not going to take the tortoise.<eos> You did what?<eos> It's vanished anyway.
The field reports.<eos> It's incredible.<eos> Three years off-program, non-med, first-gen, still rolling.<eos> If there's any way we can score some data off of this...<eos> If they caught him alive...<eos> I mean, even as a base line.<eos> Even forensically.<eos> Maybe you're in the wrong meeting.<eos> Because the meeting that we're having is about an infection.<eos> We're here talking about a serious infection and all we're trying to do is determine how far it's spread so that we know how much we have to cut to save the patient.
Meaning we will burn the program to the ground.<eos> And I mean from top to bottom.<eos> Because of this?<eos> Because they're friends?<eos> These two guys built our platform!<eos> You want to wake up and see this on CNN?<eos> Jesus, Ric.<eos> Just like that?<eos> Hirsch and Hillcott?<eos> How many people even understand this work, let alone have the will to pursue it?
I'm going to call your boss and we're gonna figure it out.<eos> Watch her.<eos> Hey, hold on a second.<eos> I'm going to get my bag.<eos> We got to go.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> This way.<eos> I don't know where this goes.<eos> Just open it.
Go for a guy so goofy and without a cent?<eos> CAROL: And to be getting married after only just one year...<eos> Seems pretty short, don't you think so, my dear?<eos> Now, it's too bad Tom's last grandpa just suffered a fatal stroke.<eos> Because he would have loved to be here.<eos> And that's no joke.<eos> And That's no joke<eos> CAROL: To Tom and Violet.<eos> PETE: To Tom and Violet.<eos> My daughter, Violet, the first important thing to remember about marriage is that it requires commitment.
- That's right.<eos> Let's see her.<eos> - Shut it!<eos> Well, I...<eos> Once there was an ancient kingdom.<eos> What is this?<eos> That kingdom fell into war and chaos and ruin...<eos> We've all heard that tale.<eos> Lost kingdom.<eos> Aye, but it's true.
- I just... I really stink.<eos> Oh, that's OK.<eos> I just wanna go to the bathroom and take a shower.<eos> Just one second.<eos> OK. I'll be right back.<eos> Where's your violin? - What?<eos> I need rosin. I can't find it.<eos> It's not by the couch?<eos> No, it's not there.<eos> It's not in the bedroom either.
People.<eos> It's my birthday.<eos> No, no!<eos> I can report you to the house fellow for having a man in the dorm.<eos> - Listen to this.<eos> - What?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Orson.<eos> He said, "The camera is far more" "than a recording apparatus."<eos> "It is a means by which messages" "come to us from the other world."
- I can watch this all day..<eos> - And this kid ruled!<eos> Ruled?<eos> His parents found him OD'ed in his room a few days ago, he's dead..<eos> Whatever he took, the Lab is never seen it before..<eos> Now you can see, this kid is white.<eos> That means people actually give a shit.<eos> Sir, I just want after you, that I would give a shit if he was black<eos> Right now, HFS is contained right there in Sagan High<eos> Now once this drug breaks containment, it goes viral in a few days..
We got clean water and bandages and another camp about six miles west of here.<eos> We were gonna try and push on after we ate.<eos> We're the Wolverines.<eos> I was afraid of that.<eos> So how did we get here?<eos> What happened to our defense?<eos> It went defunct.<eos> Shit-ified.<eos> There's a new class of weapon.<eos> It caused a massive electrical pulse.
Kiss my ring.<eos> Long live Silver Lion. Hmm.<eos> Mr. Ming is here.<eos> We'll finish this later.<eos> The 10 Rodents couldn't handle Zen Yi.<eos> Perhaps you should have sent 20.<eos> The government shipment is only days away.<eos> Fifty-thousand taels of gold bullion.<eos> Still, capturing it won't be easy.<eos> It's being escorted by the Gemini killers.
It doesn't even show up on the GPS.<eos> It is unworthy of global positioning.<eos> That's the whole point.<eos> Get off the grid, right?<eos> No cell phone reception.. No traffic cameras.<eos> Go someplace for one goddamn weekend where they can't.. Globally position my ass, man.<eos> This is the whole issue.<eos> Is society crumbling, Marty?<eos> No. Society is binding. Right?<eos> It's filling in the cracks with concrete.
- Your face looks backwards.<eos> So you know what's gonna happen? You've done all this already?<eos> I don't want to talk about time travel shit.<eos> If we start talking about it, we're gonna be here all day.<eos> Making diagrams with straws.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> - I hurt myself, it changes your body.<eos> - Does what I do change your memories? - It doesn't matter!<eos> My memory is cloudy.<eos> It's a cloud. Because my memories aren't really memories.
The Court thinks you need a doctor.<eos> Do you have any idea why?<eos> I like to drink.<eos> I like hookers with big breasts, and I like fighting.<eos> What's wrong with that?<eos> I am King!<eos> What if you weren't King.<eos> What would make you happy?<eos> "To sleep, perchance to dream."<eos> "Often expectation fails and most often there, where most it promises."
- Yes.<eos> On myself as well.<eos> - What is the survival rate.<eos> - There's always some risk...<eos> - "Some risk"!<eos> But if it goes well, and I'm confident that it will, he will be immune.<eos> The Crown Prince is the heir to the throne!<eos> He's protected by God!<eos> A smallpox epidemic is not picky.<eos> It kills both kings and queens.
Sink or swim.<eos> Chuck her in the deep end.<eos> It's all the deep end.<eos> Personnel are required to carry identification at all times.<eos> A rookie Judge on assessment is likely to be involved in armed combat. 104 00:10:29,425 -- 00:10:31,548 One in five don't survive the first day.<eos> You may be required to carry out on-the-spot executions of convicted felons.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Incorrect sentencing is an automatic fail.<eos> Disobeying a direct order from your assessment officer is an automatic fail.<eos> Losing your primary weapon or having it taken from you is an automatic fail.
Bane was a member of the League of Shadows?<eos> And then he was excommunicated.<eos> And any man who is too extreme for Ra's Al Ghul is not to be trifled with.<eos> I didn't realize I was known for trifling with criminals.<eos> That was then.<eos> And you can strap up your leg and put your mask back on but that doesn't make you what you were.<eos> If this man is everything that you say he is, then the city needs me.<eos> The city needs Bruce Wayne.<eos> Your resources. Your knowledge.<eos> It doesn't need your body, or your life.
The legend is that there was a mercenary who worked for a local warlord.<eos> He fell in love with the warlord's daughter. They were married in secret.<eos> When the warlord found out the mercenary was condemned to this pit.<eos> But then he exiled him instead.<eos> The mercenary understood that it was the daughter who had secured his release.<eos> But what he could not know was the true price of his freedom.<eos> She took his place in the pit.<eos> And she was with child the mercenary's child.<eos> Innocence cannot flower underground.<eos> It has to be stamped out.
- Why?<eos> - We built it.<eos> You built the bomb?<eos> It was built as a fusion reactor.<eos> First of its kind.<eos> Bane turned the core into a bomb and removed it from the reactor.<eos> - Here's the important part.<eos> - As the device's fuel cells deteriorate it becomes increasingly unstable to the point of detonation.<eos> This bomb is a time bomb.<eos> And it will go off in 23 days, regardless of Bane's revolution or what we, or the outside world, choose to do.
You'll get us all killed!<eos> If anyone crosses this bridge, they'll blow the city!<eos> It's gonna blow anyway!<eos> We need to open this bridge, now!<eos> Detective, if you take one step forward we will shoot you!<eos> If you take two steps forward, we will blow the bridge!<eos> Okay, go back by the bus and wait for me, all right?<eos> Go back and wait.<eos> Prepare a convoy.<eos> We must secure the bomb until it detonates.
But don't alarm yourself, it is only a carnal act, performed in service not unlike my role as amanuensis.<eos> And I confess women's hearts like their desire remain a mystery to me.<eos> Afterward, she cried and thanked me for bringing life back into their home.<eos> Making it clear that Vyvyan had been there the entire night, between us like the silence between notes, that holds the key to all music.<eos> Best news of all<eos> I've started my own work.<eos> I called about an old recording written by a man named Robert Frobisher.<eos> Oops. Busted.<eos> I know I shouldn't be playing it.<eos> I was checking it to make sure it wasn't scratched but... honestly I just can't stop listening to it.
Do you ever think that the universe is against you?<eos> All the time.<eos> You mind?<eos> I'm cool.<eos> You seem nervous, Isaac.<eos> – Do I make you nervous? – No.<eos> Actually, just the opposite.<eos> Are you gonna tell me why you covered for me?<eos> Freedom. The fatuous jingle of our civilization.<eos> But only those deprived of it have the barest inkling of what it really is.
So, tell me something.<eos> What was the best thing that happened to you today?<eos> Um, well, I got a pet seal...<eos> Well, not a pet seal, but a little seal doll.<eos> And does it... Did you give it a name?<eos> I named her Harper.<eos> - Harper?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Why Harper?<eos> 'Cause it's a harbor seal, and now...
Yeah... Yeah...<eos> We... work together.<eos> That it?<eos> - That is it<eos> - And it feels like real life?<eos> What is life but our brain's chemical perception of it.<eos> Your eyes see, your brain chemistry reacts.<eos> Here we just remove the middleman and we go straight to the chemistry.<eos> That make it any less real?<eos> An illusion, no matter how convincing, it is still an illusion.
No, it's for my other friend who just got out of prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, the Three Musketeers.<eos> Hey, look at Hirschey.<eos> Looks like a baby.<eos> Those were the days, my friend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Your place looks like where I just came from.<eos> Except it's worse.<eos> It's not to your liking? - Sorry.
We're just getting started, buddy.<eos> I need 20 bucks. I'll be right back.<eos> What are you doing, Val?<eos> Give it to me.<eos> I'm not asking.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Hey, hey, can you help a brother out?<eos> What's happening?<eos> I want you to play something a little different.<eos> You know, like when music was still music, when it had a little soul.
How do you think I should do it?<eos> I don't.<eos> There's the rub.<eos> He put his son on the job.<eos> This was a bad idea.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'm not gonna ask questions.<eos> The first sign of trouble, the kid panics, starts shooting everywhere.<eos> He catches my bullet in the crossfire.<eos> It could have been anybody's.
Surviving here won't be fun.<eos> How will your mom feel if we're off the grid for two weeks?<eos> By the time you get back, she's probably gonna be remarried.<eos> You gonna let him talk to you like that?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Okay, so, what's the plan, Colonel Sanders?<eos> How about you show us more of your trinkets that won't get us off this island?<eos> Anyone else thinking about the eggs hatching?<eos> If you're afraid of a few critters, maybe you shouldn't have come, Henry.<eos> It is called the Mysterious Island. Should've expected mysterious things.
But I like you.<eos> So when you're ready, if you're ready, you call me. Okay?<eos> And sign here and here.<eos> There?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And initial here, sign here.<eos> -Here, sign, and here.<eos> -l like that tie.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> is it made out of organic mung beans?
Anything's possible.<eos> Oh, Griff.<eos> I can never bear to watch this part.<eos> Armstrong and Aldrin are scheduled to set foot on the moon on early Monday morning, Εastern Daylight Τime.<eos> Where's Griffin?<eos> Doing his own thing.<eos> Gentlemen.<eos> This elevator will take you to the top.<eos> To get the Arc Net outside the atmosphere you need to strap it to the escape rocket above the capsule!<eos> You do not want to be anywhere near this rocket when it takes off!
Send us reinforcements.<eos> They break through.<eos> Sire contact with the enemy the defenses.<eos> One mile east.<eos> That was it.<eos> He still had at least can leave an address.<eos> Where would you place him?<eos> Lena, he is still here.<eos> The machine is not moved.<eos> That's impossible ... for he is always in the center of the field that it generates.
The Marceau family's reputation is impeccable...<eos> Had an impeccable reputation.<eos> We've watched these tapes, and we saw nothing.<eos> - There are customs documents, and a witness who saw nothing at the chéteau.<eos> She was estranged after her uncle rejected a loan request.<eos> No, I was three when I last visited him. Do you really think I'd remember?<eos> - I swear to God that...<eos> - Shut up!<eos> We will keep the statue for two weeks.<eos> If no one claims it, you can have it back.
We're attempting to contain and entrap the entity we manifested a few years ago.<eos> This is where our experiment will be happening.<eos> We'll use these devices to detect our entity when he makes his appearance.<eos> The four of us will be wearing these headsets.<eos> They'll capture our belief and channel it into here.<eos> Utilizing our equipment, I'm going to amplify the brainwaves of the participants.<eos> There'll be four people sitting around the table but this will make it seem like four thousand.<eos> And all of this concentrated energy will be focused into there.<eos> My modern and altered version of a psychomanteum, or apparition chamber.<eos> The electric current acts as an amplifier as it runs through the cages.
What we will prove is that the supernatural is actually part of the natural world.<eos> It is something you can quantify and qualify.<eos> It isn't magic, it is science.<eos> And we will make contact.<eos> The human body is essentially a walking battery full of bio-energy particularly that which is generated by the brain.<eos> Ben, please.<eos> How long...<eos> The first sounds acted as a beacon, drawing the entity to our world.<eos> Then we allowed it to cross over.<eos> It's clear to me that it wants what it doesn't have.

- Tell me what opera is.<eos> No, yes, uh, well, yes, I will...<eos> I will eventually.<eos> No, you tell me what rap is and then I'll tell you what opera is.<eos> How about you tell me what opera is and then later on I'll tell you what rap is?<eos> There you go. What can I do?<eos> Uh, well, you know, originally, it was people just like you went to the opera.<eos> Casual clothes, they took food, they took alcohol, they threw things.<eos> Anyway, that was a long time ago that rich people took over the world of opera with their fancy dress, and they took the soul out of it - they made it something that it's not.<eos> What is it?

Whose memory?<eos> Your fans?<eos> Your fans are dead! Gone, split, bought the farm!<eos> Except the ones who've moved in here, and they're just waiting to die.<eos> We've all aged. It's crept up on all of us without us even noticing.<eos> I'm the same old Wilf I always was, thankfully, with a little bit of testosterone to keep me interested.<eos> Now, I'm gonna say something that's a wee bit rude to you.<eos> Just fucking do it!<eos> My gift deserted me.<eos> It deserts us all, Jean.
No, wait a minute, Reggie.<eos> - What? - I'll go on last.<eos> I'm sure we can live with that.<eos> We certainly can, yes.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - What? I've got to do Anne Langley's make-up.<eos> It's not make-up she needs. It's a paper-hanging job.<eos> - That's very naughty, Jean.<eos> - And very true. Make it nice and tight.<eos> Make sure the middle bit's tight so it stays that way.
I'm gonna miss you.<eos> Bye-bye, Bunny.<eos> You're leaving?<eos> But what if Pitch comes back?<eos> What if we stop believing again?<eos> If I can't see you...<eos> Hey, slow down, slow down.<eos> You're telling me you stop believing in the moon when the sun comes up?<eos> No.<eos> Well, do you stop believing in the sun when clouds block it out?
Weyland was a superstitious man.<eos> He wanted a true believer on board.<eos> Cheers.<eos> So no response?<eos> I'm sorry, no.<eos> Maybe they didn't understand it.<eos> How are your lessons going, David?<eos> I spent two years deconstructing dozens of ancient languages to their roots.<eos> I'm confident I can communicate with them provided your thesis is correct.<eos> "Provided it's correct." That's good.
What about it?<eos> I've been thinking about the chapel.<eos> You can't buy the god-damn chapel.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Contact the principals.<eos> I thought you'd be thrilled about the painting. One painting.<eos> You don't have a important Rothko and you've always want one, we've talked about this!<eos> How many paintings in this chapel?<eos> I don't know. 14? 15?<eos> If they're selling the chapel, I'll keep it intact.
How many paintings in this chapel?<eos> I don't know. 14? 15?<eos> If they're selling the chapel, I'll keep it intact.<eos> Tell them!<eos> Keep it intact?<eos> Where?<eos> Tell them!<eos> In my apartment there's sufficient space.<eos> I can make more space.<eos> The people need to see it.
Keep it intact?<eos> Where?<eos> Tell them!<eos> In my apartment there's sufficient space.<eos> I can make more space.<eos> The people need to see it.<eos> Let them buy it.<eos> Let them outbid me.<eos> Forgive the pissed way to say this, but the? chapel belongs to the world.<eos> It's mine if I buy it.
- One billionth of a second.<eos> I understand none of it.<eos> But it tells me how rigorous we need to be in order to take adequate measure of the world around us.<eos> There are zeptoseconds.<eos> Good, I'm glad.<eos> Yoctoseconds.<eos> One septilionth of a second.<eos> Because time is a corporate asset now. It belongs to the free market system.<eos> The present is harder to find.<eos> It is being sucked out of the world to make way for the future of uncontrolled markets and huge investment potentials.

Maybe today.<eos> To correct the acceleration of time and bring nature back to normal, more or less.<eos> You have to understand.<eos> The more visionary the idea, the more people it leaves behind.

Tell me.<eos> The urge to destroy is a creative thing.<eos> This is also a hallmark of capitalist thought.<eos> Enforced destruction.<eos> Old industries have to be harshly eliminated. New markets have to be forcibly claimed and old markets have to be re-exploited.<eos> Destroy the past.<eos> Make the future.<eos> This is the thing about genius. Genius alters the terms of its habitat.<eos> Technology is crucial the civilization, why?<eos> Because it helps us to make our fate.

Hey!<eos> Ted, right?<eos> Um, Mr. O'Hare?<eos> So, I hear you have become interested in trees.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> Where did you hear that?<eos> Teddy, there's not much that goes on in Thneedville that I don't know about.<eos> Here's the deal, I make a living selling fresh air to people.<eos> Trees?<eos> They make it for free.
- It's a latitudinal co-ordinate.<eos> If you mark the angle of the sun at its highest point it shows you how far you are from the equator.<eos> It's useless without longitude.<eos> Even in the army they teach basic navigation.<eos> I went to West Point.<eos> I was expelled, don't worry.<eos> Fields, look there.<eos> Get me a scalpel.<eos> His tongue has been removed.<eos> And this... has replaced it.
Your daughter's love for me is the reason another man's dead.<eos> Go to Doc Clements.<eos> I have one more story to write.<eos> Edgar for today, she's still alive.<eos> Doctor, let me go!<eos> We're running out of time!<eos> For God's sake, a bullet is in your chest!<eos> Lie down and let me do my job before you bleed to death.<eos> The son of a bitch is gonna kill her today. So you cut the bullet out and you patch me up now!<eos> There's a bottle of whiskey in the kitchen. Bring it here.
Here's something else for you, Mr Poe.<eos> "It is a masterpiece, Mr Poe. An epitaph worthy of your gifts."<eos> - When did this come?<eos> - I don't know, but before the paper.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - It was under the paper.<eos> Impossible.<eos> Look at the streaks in the ink.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - It's been rained on.
Yes, you cry now?<eos> Yes.<eos> It just goes so well.<eos> (Again and even "New York, New York" in the background)<eos> - Herbie!<eos> - Mona!<eos> (Bavarian accent) His mother would in grave turn, if she knew that her son Situated in Berlin under the earth!<eos> Mona!<eos> His mother is dead and stopped turning.<eos> And they do not know where he is, and they do not know that it's not white.
- The Mayor...<eos> - Yes, that also means the Urs.<eos> He says, the fact that we in this info-sea Not all ports simultaneously, uh, ansegeln can, he proposes as a center our journalistic efforts<eos> - Although the Gutzow before...<eos> - What?<eos> But it's not just single-issue- cally positive sympathetic to come off, We are of course other...<eos> negative can happen.<eos> E.g. Especially the Scheffer, because of the...<eos> A particularly sympathetic story about Gutzow would e.g. That they are likely no woman is.<eos> What it is... not?
Which creates an ethical conundrum.<eos> But remember, you are defending his right to be a free citizen not his right to kill.<eos> Enough theorizing.<eos> Let's look at a case that gets us to start thinking practically.<eos> Sara, why don't you tell us about California vs. Chris Albanese?<eos> Okay.<eos> In the Albanese brothers case, the judge, our own Professor Nolan ruled against Chris Albanese who's now serving a life sentence for the brutal murder of his brother.<eos> The defense plead temporary insanity, but the jury and judge Nolan found Chris guilty because there was evidence that he had been planning the murder for years.<eos> I think the defense missed a serious opportunity here.<eos> Yes, it was premeditated, but it was committed in self-defense, and that would have given him a very different sentence.
We stopped, that's it? I thought you had to eat?<eos> - My lady.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Thought you were the only who knew how to steal?<eos> Here, I have a bottle opener.<eos> Crack that thing open. - Okay.<eos> - Let the adventure begin.<eos> Tell me a secret.<eos> I have a pet snail.<eos> It's my mom's.
What do you want, Abney?<eos> Chris Farraday is running shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> He's going to dump the package.<eos> If you make sure he doesn't, I will give you his share.<eos> Jesus, Abney.<eos> You are one cold rat bastard.<eos> All right.<eos> But if Farraday don't give it up, I'm going to call in the dogs, and your package is getting seized.<eos> No, he'll tell you where it is.
I often find them here,these scraps.<eos> Must float down from someone's window.<eos> "She had meant to smother the baby as soon as it was born, but something made her look at it.<eos> She heard the thundering heartbeat, she smelled the baby's bloodied head and love confounded her. "<eos> It's just a scrap, like you say.<eos> But there's a story there.<eos> You can feel it.<eos> Shall we walk a little?<eos> My story starts with Clara.<eos> One day, it will end with her.
Clara is never alone.<eos> She finds money and company every day.<eos> It comes easily to her, like lying.<eos> Who's that?<eos> - You know her?<eos> - No.<eos> - You seen her?<eos> But I like solitude.<eos> I walk and the past walks with me.<eos> It lives.
As if ancient knowledge might keep his death at bay.<eos> You have been looking in the wrong place, my son.<eos> Here it is.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He told me we must find a shrine, an ancient myth said it had healing powers.<eos> It was on an empty island off a barren coast.<eos> I thought it the desperate quest of a dying man.<eos> It was a sinister black thumbnail sticking out of the ocean, more rock than island.<eos> The oarsmen wouldn't set foot on the place.<eos> Said it was cursed.
Ella! Eleanor!<eos> Bring it here.<eos> Bring it here!<eos> Isn't the present everything?<eos> Ella!<eos> - This is your last night, witch.Last night!<eos> - No...!<eos> This blade is from Byzantium.<eos> My souvenir of the crusades.<eos> May it send you to eternity.
Let him see the guitar.<eos> You know what I'm talking about. Yeah, I know what you're talking about. But he doesn't know what you're talking about.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> No, he doesn't know what we're talking about.<eos> I don't think much about it, either.<eos> Ain't your decision.<eos> Look!<eos> I want it!<eos> How much you want for the guitar?<eos> I'll let it go for $700.
- Yes.<eos> So you're a specialist in acute trauma.<eos> Erik is the best in the area.<eos> You had a patient I needed to look at.<eos> Follow me.<eos> It's okay. He's also a doctor.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - What's his name?<eos> Josef? My name is Erik.<eos> If you feel my hand, then press it.
Your fear of capture and imprisonment is an implant from millions of years ago.<eos> This battle has been with you from before you know.<eos> This is not you.<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> - It's not you.<eos> - Shut the fuck up!<eos> You are asleep.<eos> Your spirit was free moving from body to the next body, free...<eos> Free for a moment.<eos> Then it was captured by an invader force bent on turning you to the darkest way.
Not for long.<eos> An agreement is being discussed.<eos> Mexico and Rome are going to make peace.<eos> An agreement?<eos> No one wants this war anymore, Enrique.<eos> Mexico is bleeding on its own fields.<eos> Mexico is hanging from telegraph poles from Monterrey to Veracruz.<eos> Of course you need an agreement.<eos> But freedom has no compromise.<eos> By definition, it is absolute, and that's why we will be victorious.
She's wearing a telemetry medical transmitter.<eos> All the First Family have them.<eos> - Nice to live in the big white house?<eos> - So we know she's alive.<eos> And she has had some blood loss, but it's nothing life-threatening. So far.<eos> So, if I actually find her and she is alive, how do we get off the ship?<eos> Easy. Hitch a ride, man.<eos> There's an escape pod on level five.<eos> It's not on any of the schematics, but you can find it on this map.<eos> It'll guide you to the pod and give you the access code.
- So why is there still counting?<eos> - Not done yet.<eos> Find the Vidadermic labeled "20 ccs."<eos> - Serotonin nor epinephrine.<eos> - What the hell do I do with this?<eos> It's a neurotransmitter stimulant.<eos> You've got to push the needle through the center of her right eye into the brain.<eos> Come on, you're kidding me, right?<eos> Move it around until it locates the thalamus. It's self-guiding.<eos> Then fire it.
You're out at the ranch up there?<eos> I've been there for some time.<eos> You told me about her.<eos> I have to look at. Some of these creeks and rivers--<eos> The woman you met at the hospital.<eos> You talk to my sister, right?<eos> Someone you'd known in your youth.<eos> I'm going over to the... The tall grass prairie now.<eos> The ranch is going into receivership.<eos> It's going bankrupt.
All false.<eos> You're a little dreamer.<eos> You need to fly.<eos> You should be free.<eos> Listen to your heart.<eos> Dead?<eos> No, my bag!<eos> You're crazy!<eos> We'll get it later. When we come back.<eos> It's hidden.
Where are you?<eos> Love is not only a feeling.<eos> Love is a duty.<eos> You shall love.<eos> Love is a command.<eos> And you say, "I can't command my emotions.<eos> "they come and go like clouds."<eos> To that, Christ says, "you shall love... whether you like it or not."<eos> You fear your love has died."<eos> "It perhaps is waiting to be transformed into something higher."
My conduct has been that of a British gentleman.<eos> If this does not suit you, then we were not meant for each other.<eos> What're you doing here?<eos> I was arrested during an ID check.<eos> I'll be deported on the next caravan.<eos> YOU!<eos> Come with me.<eos> Move it.<eos> Excuse me, may I have some water for my plant?<eos> Doesn't need it anymore.
No gun.<eos> - Okay, one more question.<eos> - Okay, you already said that. I know.<eos> Did you see Carmen Sanchez at all that night, I mean at all?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> - One more question. - Okay...<eos> You gotta stop saying that please!<eos> I gotta know... the snake...<eos> Carbo, wasted.<eos> Well, woke up and it was there.
I am still a cop.<eos> Can't take it away if they can't find me.<eos> It's just a matter of time. You know that, right?<eos> The villagers are lighting their torches.<eos> It doesn't hurt that you're dead or alive proposition.<eos> Wow, there it is, eh?<eos> There is no evidence that anyone was shooting at you.<eos> No bullets in the walls, the doors jammed. No powder on Ziggy's hands, no gun! No one left alive, just dead one way or another.<eos> - What do you expect? - I don't expect anything!<eos> What I want is to find Ziggy's gun, to prove it misfired.
Plus, you know... I'd rather be shot than go in before I'm ready.<eos> So, you need my help with this, Plum.<eos> Believe it.<eos> $50,000 changes my world.<eos> Alright, I'm in!<eos> But, I think we both know that the money is secondary.<eos> Keep flappering your lips. I'm in it for the cash.<eos> Oh, that's a lie!<eos> It's a lie.<eos> See a little vein in your neck, it's pulsing.
The th rd day afterwe arrived, for lunch, we were g ven rce pudding.<eos> I hate rice pudding.<eos> We were sitting at long tables in an immense hall.<eos> I didn't want to eat the stuff. A counse lor sa d to me,<eos> "You're not leaving "unt you finish your plate. "<eos> Afterthe meal, everybody got up and left and I was left alone in tears.<eos> Mum and I had made a secret pact.<eos> I was to write her every week. I was to send her a postcard.<eos> If I was enjoying camp, I was to draw flowers on it and f I wasn t, stars.<eos> She kept that card. It was covered in stars.
Careful.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, my God, I love this song.<eos> It's a good one.<eos> Isn't classic rock the best?<eos> Classic rock?<eos> This is classic rock now?<eos> Hey, you know, Kara, you should drink some more water.<eos> Where's that bottle I gave you?<eos> Oh, it's right here.
History prefers legends to men.<eos> It prefers nobility to brutality.
History prefers legends to men.<eos> It prefers nobility to brutality.<eos> Soaring speeches to quiet deeds.<eos> History remembers the battle and forgets the blood.<eos> Whatever history remembers of me, if it remembers anything at all... it shall only be a fraction of the truth.
I could pay you to kill him!<eos> My services are not for sale.<eos> And the word you are looking for is "destroy."<eos> It is quite a feat to kill that which is already dead.<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> My mother was murdered.<eos> And if I teach you how to murder her murderer... so what?<eos> How will that honor her memory?<eos> How will that benefit the next boy whose mother is taken?<eos> If vengeance is all you seek... seek it elsewhere.
Miss Todd, may I speak candidly?<eos> I, too, came here to better myself.<eos> That's why I've taken an interest in the law... and why, if I may be so bold, I have taken an interest in you.<eos> And as for the adventure that you seek...<eos> I suspect that few men could ever hope to provide that for you.<eos> Least of all your fiance, Stephen Douglas.<eos> Mr. Lincoln, you are full of surprises.<eos> Miss Todd, you have no idea.<eos> Dear Abraham. I've made a deposit at the local bank.<eos> Be careful, it can quickly disappear.
We're going to be late for the theater.<eos> Hold onto this for me, Henry.<eos> Mary, darling... have you seen my hat?<eos> It's on your desk in the office.<eos> Have you seen my hat?<eos> Abraham, let me make you immortal.<eos> Let us fight through the ages, side by side.<eos> Vampires are not the only things that live forever.<eos> History prefers legends to men.<eos> It prefers nobility to brutality.

It's not now.<eos> Good.<eos> Now let me speak to Mr. "Eat-Shit-Caviar. "<eos> I'm here.<eos> You insulted me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> Take out your gun.<eos> Stand in front of the camera where I can see you.<eos> Now stick it in that vulgar mouth of yours.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - You did not march, you do not have that right.<eos> Neither do you, Bennett.<eos> I saw it on TV.<eos> They show those marches a lot in February.<eos> Stop.<eos> Your wife kicked your ass.<eos> It's really not that big of a deal.<eos> - There's worse things.<eos> - It's my ex-wife. Okay?
- Oh, stop it.<eos> - We are adults, for Christ's sakes.<eos> We make a decent living.<eos> I think it's time to invest and make this a real home.<eos> With matching dishes and glasses and a new couch.<eos> Well, what's wrong with my couch?<eos> Baby, you pulled it out of a dumpster.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm pretty sure Annalisa was impregnated, like, right there.<eos> It's got cigarette burns, bong spills, there was the scabies scare of '06.
It's got cigarette burns, bong spills, there was the scabies scare of '06.<eos> - You're being dramatic.<eos> - No, I'm really not.<eos> Your aunt who tinkles when she laughs?<eos> She pissed all over the couch last Christmas.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> We're like animals.<eos> I cleaned up the bong spill and the cigarette burns.<eos> This couch has history.<eos> And now it is history.
Yes.<eos> And the three pieces of gum that were stuck to it.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I was looking for that gum.<eos> You know I'm done with the music industry, right?<eos> I love what I do.<eos> Okay, Zeke, he's not trying to sign you, though.<eos> He wants some new songs for some albums that he's working on.<eos> Yeah, well, my album went Plat-none, okay?<eos> I mean, two people heard it and both of them were relatives.
Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Bye. - Bye.<eos> Okay. - Bye.<eos> Go straight inside, all right?<eos> Close the door.<eos> What now?<eos> How big you reckon that wave was, sir?<eos> It's a small world, kid, but how they gauge the size of waves, well, that differs from place to place, so, hard to say.<eos> So it might be bigger somewhere else?
Let's go.<eos> So you made it all of 30 yards.<eos> If you want to get out there, you got to make it through more than half a mile of this just to get in position of Mavericks.<eos> So you've got to conserve all the energy you've got.<eos> All right.<eos> Now let's take a look at what you missed.<eos> Now, for some reason, you decided to paddle straight out into that mess.<eos> Now, take a look at the rocks over there.<eos> See what's happening with the current?<eos> It's got nowhere to go.
I don't know.<eos> Well, you better ask yourself, what do you want to leave behind?<eos> The truth of who you really are or just some words on a page?<eos> All that stuff that's burning deep down inside of you, what is that?<eos> That stuff you can't even look at because it scares you so much, that the same thing in that letter?<eos> That letter that you can't open... Don't.<eos> But you can't even throw away. Don't do this!<eos> Don't do what?<eos> If you don't even have the courage to open that letter, then how can you take on that wave?<eos> Stop it!
My sister, aged 12, left with a man of 40.<eos> I was scared of becoming the stake in a bet, too.<eos> I was really scared.<eos> Guess what I did.<eos> A cat used to come to our garden.<eos> One day, I took the quail from its cage. I gave it to the cat.<eos> It carried it off to a corner to eat it in peace.<eos> I followed it.<eos> But the cat turned on me.<eos> It scratched my face.
The other women never talk about it!<eos> Never.<eos> But me... I'm possessed by a satanic spirit.<eos> The Koran?<eos> Have you seen the Koran?<eos> Which sura had I got to?<eos> The peacock's feather?<eos> The peacock's feather?<eos> Where is it?<eos> It holds all my secrets.
That might be the ambassador.<eos> He is dumping the urine on the Israeli delegation.<eos> Oh, that's a good one.<eos> Okay, he's returning to the podium.<eos> Much has been made of the hostility between our countries.<eos> With the help of the U.M., I will draft a new constitution for Wadiya and sign it in five days, on Wadiya's Independence Day.<eos> No,no,no.<eos> This new constitution will end the dictatorship...<eos> No!<eos> ...And it will turn Wadiya into a democracy.
Okay, fine.<eos> I will help you.<eos> On one condition.<eos> Name it.<eos> You reinstate me as Head of Nuclear Research, so I can finish building my bomb.<eos> Deal.<eos> One last thing.<eos> You will let me build a round nuclear weapon.<eos> Never.<eos> It must be pointy.
Jachnoon, President Prime Minister Aladeen.<eos> Jachnoon.<eos> Nadal.<eos> I have to be back at the palace in an hour.<eos> Zoey thinks I'm at yoga.<eos> I have great news.<eos> We are just days away from testing the new missiles.<eos> I have re-engineered the oxidizing ducts and the payload delivery systems.<eos> But you'll be happy to know, the missile is now pointy!<eos> Who cares if it's pointy?
So I used songs and stuff to learn.<eos> Besides Filipino, the only language I knew was music.<eos> It helps me remember.<eos> If that makes sense.<eos> Malia, it makes perfect sense.<eos> I don't want to quit it.<eos> Then you got to tell him that.<eos> Look, you know what you do? You tell him your teacher won't let you quit.<eos> He thinks school is just a waste of time.<eos> But it's not.
But they don't.<eos> In fact, they imitate the stray cell until basically the whole organism begins to die.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you know what? Biology is an amazing thing.<eos> And here's the good news, all that decays can be restored.<eos> Is this hitting anybody?<eos> Like how a cut heals.<eos> Brian, my man.<eos> Look, you got one!<eos> And once that cell's back on track, it creates energy amongst the other cells.
You think?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> You got to find your passion and then let it guide you, let it envelop...<eos> You're out of here. - Already?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> - Just two minutes, stir the sauce!<eos> Here you go.<eos> Wow, this is beautiful.<eos> You know, you picked a very delicate dish.<eos> The sauce there is extremely, it's delicate.
I am.<eos> One down.<eos> Go down one, this one.<eos> No, this one.<eos> You are powerful!<eos> Is there anybody better?<eos> No!<eos> Thank you, Scott.<eos> Your donation was more than generous.<eos> It's going to keep our school in the black for quite some time.
It's real sugar?<eos> It's not bark or sand or anything?<eos> There he is!<eos> Look at him!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> So cute.<eos> There he is.<eos> What is that?<eos> That's the placenta.<eos> We keep the cord and placenta attached until it falls away naturally.
I panicked, all right?<eos> We were broke.<eos> This place had food and shelter, and it was way better than Rick's.<eos> I'm admitting it.<eos> I thought we could have fun here but then you drank the Kool-Aid and I can't stand it.<eos> I want to support you, I do.<eos> But I can't if it means living here.<eos> That might be a problem.<eos> George, can I just read a passage from my book?<eos> I think it's relevant.
Seth, are you all right?<eos> Seth, what are you doing?<eos> Stop punching me!<eos> I'm not punching you.<eos> I'm slapping you!<eos> I wish there was something we could do to help, but we're non-violent.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Stop!<eos> What happened to non-violence?<eos> Violence is justified when it serves the greater good.
- Bomb!<eos> - Bomb!<eos> Do the number trick.<eos> I taught him a number trick.<eos> - Think of a number.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Double it.<eos> - Wait, that's too fast.<eos> Okay, think of a number.<eos> - Double it.
Mrs Parker Leigh.<eos> So, there are more of you?<eos> How are you, Tracy?<eos> I wasn't expecting you.<eos> We haven't found Jenny yet.<eos> I guess Chestnut is doing what he can, right?<eos> I put one of my men on the case.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What about Julia?<eos> Well, the prosecution's asking for the death penalty this afternoon, but I don't think they're gonna grant it.
I haven't picked up the phone.<eos> That's good.<eos> Anyways he's not making it easy, man.<eos> Everything's here. It's loaded.<eos> It's waiting to be picked up, man.<eos> But I don't know what to do.<eos> You need to come over, man, please.<eos> What's the address?<eos> - Oh, you know.<eos> It's in my house.- Tell me again.
If he is deceived by the way you look the battle's half won.<eos> People think of you as sweet.<eos> They don't expect you to fight dirty.<eos> - Use that to your advantage. - Whoo! Yes!<eos> Concentrate.<eos> - Your weapon isn't your only friend. - Sorry.<eos> The environment can be an ally, too.<eos> Deception on the battlefield isn't just an option.<eos> You're so cute when you're mad.<eos> Oftentimes it's the difference between victory and defeat.
I was born to be a vampire.<eos> Everything was falling into place.<eos> Even the Volturi seemed to accept my new status. Though they'd want proof eventually.<eos> Though they'd want proof eventually.<eos> It seemed we had only one enemy left. Time.<eos> Renesmee was growing too fast.<eos> We all worried about how long we would have with her.<eos> It just made every moment more precious.<eos> Look, a snowflake.<eos> It's beautiful.
Wrong, completely wrong.<eos> It's not about her.<eos> But where is she... when she writes about this Nazi and his crimes?<eos> She has the right to feel pain, and to show it.<eos> That would be shameless. And quite out of character.<eos> You have to be aware that if she represses so much pain, it will eventually overwhelm her. And you too.<eos> ♪ [Piano: Jazz]<eos> Professor Heidegger is here for you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Time is mysterious: it can return and transform everything.
But they all needed him to survive.<eos> They tried to kill him too.<eos> You stole my wallet.<eos> Yeah. But it had no money in it.<eos> What are you doing in here anyway?<eos> Solicitation.<eos> You're a prostitute? Yes, John.<eos> I'm a prostitute.<eos> So what's the deal with the mask?<eos> You know where it is?
Sir?<eos> Please... God forgive me.<eos> Easy.<eos> We'll take you to the hospital.<eos> Let him die.<eos> He is missing a hand.<eos> Give me your water, Armando.<eos> Waste water on that?<eos> In the trunk. It's in the trunk.<eos> Take it...
We will live again in freedom<eos> In the garden of the Lord<eos> We will walk behind the plowshare We will put away the sword<eos> The chain will be broken and all men will have their reward!<eos> Will you join in our crusade?<eos> Who will be strong and stand with me?<eos> Somewhere beyond the barricade ls there a world you long to see?<eos> Do you hear the people sing?<eos> Say, do you hear the distant drums?<eos> It is the future that we bring when tomorrow comes!

No, I'm only kidding.<eos> You look like the white J.Lo.<eos> Baby, J.Lo is in her 40s.<eos> - No, she's not.<eos> - Yes, she is.<eos> - J.Io's in her 40s? - Mm-hm.<eos> What?<eos> I got a surprise.<eos> Blow.<eos> - Now you're gonna get it.
Delta, don't be jealous now.<eos> We couldn't have done all this without Porsche. We need her.<eos> Yeah, but we don't need you.<eos> Delta's right, Gerry.<eos> We don't need you, but we do need your car.<eos> We're happy to do you a deal.<eos> For the car?<eos> Yeah, Daddy, for the car.<eos> Okay.<eos> And just what do you think it's worth?
Yes! .<eos> Yes, can you transmit that to my screen.<eos> Perfect, okay, thank you.<eos> It worked, he's downtown.<eos> He's... he's heading, um...<eos> Hold on, he's... he's heading on West Canfield Street.<eos> Downtown, Downtown, what the hell is Downtown.<eos> Guys, please don't tell me Mercier's downtown and we don't know it. Please don't tell me that.<eos> Mercier scheduled to give a presentation to the City Planning Commission this afternoon.<eos> It's going down in 30 minutes. Federal Courthouse.
- Yeah<eos> Oh, God, you're right.<eos> I counted wrong.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I was up. Tell me about Bora-Bora.<eos> Amazing.<eos> You've got to come here someday.<eos> Dad, Sam and I can't stop talking about the wedding.<eos> It was just what we hoped.
- Okay, bye-bye, guys.<eos> - Have a good picnic now.<eos> - Smells good.<eos> Freeway!<eos> Freeway, come on in!<eos> I can hardly remember the wedding.<eos> - Everyone loved it.<eos> - They did?<eos> Especially my mother.<eos> It gave her gout.
I assume they're from around here, so we'll just call them the Lords of Salem.<eos> Francis, we'd like to thank you for coming in.<eos> - You've been a great guest.<eos> - Well, thank you for having me.<eos> Alright, open up the phone lines and lets hear what everyone has to say.<eos> Phones are now open, so get ready to smash or trash.<eos> Can you mute that? It's giving me a headache.<eos> Thanks.<eos> May I ask you, where did you get that music from?<eos> According to our receptionist, it just appeared, with nothing but a note for me.

There are two ways to do this.<eos> First one is, you have to hide under a vehicle that come out from the tobacco factory in the city.<eos> But you have to be careful not to fall, otherwise you will die.<eos> Many people had died as they fell, and many got arrested at the borders.<eos> Second one is,...<eos> Tomorrow morning I can take you to the other side of the border.<eos> - And there I'll be done with you.<eos> - OK, take us there.<eos> Give me the necklace.<eos> You will get it tomorrow morning, and a long-ear will accompany us too.
Oh, fuck.<eos> Tony!<eos> - Don't shush me!<eos> - Shut up!<eos> Look in the wall! Tony!<eos> Yo, Beech.<eos> - Your door is open.<eos> - What are you, retarded?<eos> - I did shut it when I got here!<eos> - Then close it again!
Soon after, a daughter was born to the Queen and was named, "Snow White."<eos> And she was adored throughout the kingdom as much for her defiant spirit as for her beauty.<eos> We found it in the woods.<eos> It's injured, Mother.<eos> It must have broken its wing.<eos> Don't worry, it will heal in time.<eos> I'll look after it.<eos> You possess a rare beauty, my love.<eos> In here.<eos> Never lose it.

I don't trust her, and I don't believe her.<eos> No matter what Muir says.<eos> I feel peculiar.<eos> Queer almost.<eos> What?<eos> Since when?<eos> I'm tingling all over, but I feel lovely.<eos> How's your gout?<eos> Gout?<eos> It's a bit better.
Even the week I can not say.<eos> but I think this is not very important.<eos> I am dependent on sparse notes.<eos> Sparse, because I never reckoned to write this report, and I fear that in my memory is much different from what I experienced it.<eos> This lack adheres well to all reports.<eos> I do not write for the joy of writing.<eos> It has just so happened I have to write, if I do not want to lose his mind.<eos> It's no one there, could think of and care for me.<eos> I'm all alone, and I must try the long dark winter months to survive.<eos> I have taken this task upon me, because it will save you from me to stare into the twilight and to fear me.
She lay very still in the sunlight.<eos> A peaceful, familiar picture.<eos> Sorry!<eos> Sorry, I ... (Vibrating sound)<eos> (Soundless knocking and shouting)<eos> (Noiseless)<eos> (Glassy silence)<eos> Come lynx.<eos> Come on!<eos> We were caught in a bad situation, Lynx and I, and we did not at that time, how bad it was.
I do not remember they have written.<eos> I do not Weir, what is on that 1 O. Occurred in December " Time goes by so fast."<eos> Then passed the time really very fast?<eos> I can not remember and can not report.<eos> It's not true.<eos> Time I just seemed to pass quickly.<eos> I believe the time is very still, and I move in it.<eos> Sometimes slow and sometimes at breakneck speed.<eos> I am doing something that drive things forward, and I forget the time.<eos> And then, suddenly, is it back to me.
I'm sitting at the table, and time stands still.<eos> I can not see them, not smell or hear, but she surrounds me on all sides.<eos> Their silence and stillness is horrible.<eos> ln fact, these thoughts without meaning.<eos> I regret the animals and the people because they unasked gewo_en be in this life.<eos> Maybe people are regrettable because they have just as much sense, to guard against the natural course of things to fight.<eos> She did evil and despair make and unlovable.<eos> It would have been possible to live differently.<eos> There is no rational impulse as love.<eos> It makes the lover and the beloved life more bearable.
I'm just weir that it is too late.<eos> (Crows cawing) In this autumn has emerged a Weike crow.<eos> You always flies a piece behind the other and can be alone on a tree down, to avoid their companions.<eos> I do not understand, why the other crows do not like.<eos> For me it is a particularly beautiful bird.<eos> But for their fellow it is abominable.<eos> A sad absurdity, it does not give dü_te.<eos> Weire a crow.<eos> They remain seated, until the groRe swarm departed, and then I'll bring her a little food.<eos> It can not know why is it out token.
You want pop? You want candy? You want a snake bite kit?<eos> Get some money.<eos> Cousin Ben?<eos> Come back in five minutes.<eos> Is this him?<eos> Field Mate Sam Shakusky, Troop 55, resigned.<eos> He's hot.<eos> Almost too hot. What's in the can?<eos> $76, but it's mostly in nickels.<eos> Give it to me.
The post-mortem concluded the heart attack was the result' of natural causes but Silver was never able to shake off the suspicion surrounding Weiner's death.<eos> He disappeared just' as suddenly as he had become a star, which is why his come-back announcement more than 30 years after his last public appearance...<eos> Margaret, I was watching that.<eos> Sorry, I, uh--<eos> I thought maybe you wouldn't hear me, 'cause you--didn't.<eos> Is Dr. Matheson around?<eos> No, she's not.<eos> Can I leave the assignment with you?<eos> Just watch the coin, okay?<eos> - Where'd it go?
What can you really trust?<eos> What are your doubts?<eos> What are your certainties?<eos> What do you call truth?<eos> When you look at the sky, what do you see?<eos> Shadows?<eos> Reflections?<eos> Distant echoes?<eos> You see the moon as it was more than a second ago.<eos> You see the sun as it was shining eight minutes ago.
I don't do that.<eos> Look at the pair on you.<eos> Was that a request?<eos> No don't get your hopes up, rook.<eos> You're not my type.<eos> Good so it's a date.<eos> Town boy!<eos> - You are a real charger, ain't you?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If you're looking for some action, there's a girl who's gonna give it to you.
For 74 years, the might of Soviet socialism was so great it split the world along Eastern and Western lines.
"Chinese tassels are then added,... "...or horns of plenty, flowing with flowers..."<eos> Further on... the embroidery.<eos> "Embroidered linen camisoles in various colors... "...have been forsaken in favor of embroidered dresses..."<eos> I have an idea for my dresses!<eos> Have Madame d'Ossun bring my finery book.<eos> An embroidery... of a dahlia.<eos> See?<eos> Yes, Madame Campan?<eos> I forgot!<eos> Give it to me.
You're rambling.<eos> At my age, I look at the truth straight on.<eos> The truth is, we're safe at Versailles.<eos> Ever tell the Queen you sew?<eos> Of course not.<eos> To end up her permanent embroiderer?<eos> But Marie-Antoinette prefers finery to books.<eos> I won't see her again.<eos> The thought of it is unbearable.<eos> I hate this job, and my mistress for dumping it on us.
Answer.<eos> Go see what's going on.<eos> He has the money.<eos> - Who has the money?<eos> Kowalski, he goes to the west.<eos> Do not lose her sight.<eos> What is it?<eos> There's blood here.<eos> He's gone, but there is blood, and he dropped his gun and radio back.<eos> That apparently delayed him, so he threw it away.
Blackout.<eos> Didn't even have enough time to pull my gun.<eos> Minnie, bring up the attacker.<eos> Placeholders.<eos> Placeholders everywhere.<eos> The memory's only 5% accurate.<eos> It's impossible to know the context.<eos> You don't remember who you saw, you can't even remember the area.<eos> - But the memory is real?<eos> Yeah, it's real.
- I was protecting him!<eos> The way he was going, his addiction... It was only a matter of time before he was found facedown in an alley somewhere.<eos> So when he woke up the next morning, and he told me he didn't remember anything, ... that's when I made my decision.<eos> I set him up.<eos> I came out of the joint clean.<eos> Do you have a kid?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - What would you have done?<eos> Guilt is a powerful thing.<eos> It compels, it becomes an obsession.
Graham Parker.<eos> It's just not my kind of music.<eos> Really?<eos> What is your kind of music?<eos> I like Lady Gaga.<eos> Oh, God, of course you do.<eos> What?<eos> Shallow dance music.<eos> It's not.<eos> It is fun.
This is why we never have sex.<eos> That's disgusting, you're gross.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You're so...<eos> God!<eos> Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie, Sadie<eos> Charlotte, I'm doing my homework.<eos> Okay, watch this. Watch this.<eos> There's a haunted cow back here.<eos> I'm pretty sure it does not have milk.
- Just the way I like 'em.<eos> - Yeah. Well, that's an unusual name.<eos> My father had an unforgiven commitment to historical reference.<eos> Oh. Well, let's just get you fixed up, huh.<eos> How does number 8 sound to you?<eos> 27b 00:04:51,990 -- 00:04:54,790 Israeli jet fighters bombed a guerilla base killing at least forty nine soldiers 27c 00:04:55,027 -- 00:04:56,691 and thirteen civilians.<eos> - Here it is again.<eos> - Up next, local law enforcement and the FBI are scouring the area north of Spokane for any evidence that can lead them to missing heiress Emma Ward.<eos> From what we can tell, the carving's about six months old.<eos> It reads "Emma Alive."
Well, then we have a scheduling problem, don't we?<eos> Cut me loose, Frankenstein.<eos> Don't get nuts, Gunner.<eos> Do it.<eos> - Where's your team?<eos> - Waiting.<eos> I need a weapon.<eos> Something big.<eos> - Yours. - Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> My big weapon's hangin' right where it is.
- Hi, Connor.<eos> - Hi, Ma.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> How's it going?<eos> It was all over the news. So just be careful with Ma.<eos> She's been a bit upset.<eos> All right, wee man?<eos> The Taoiseach and I are agreed on a joint declaration on Northern Ireland.<eos> It makes no compromise on strongly held principles.
Double stripes break.<eos> Why are your hands so freakishly big?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why are you so freakishly annoying?<eos> Why are you so freakishly...<eos> Sweet mother of monkey milk!<eos> A gold coin !<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> That is mine. -Race you for it!<eos> I don't have to race for it because it's mine!
Double stripe.<eos> Thank you !<eos> Wait!<eos> Let me talk to you for one second. Okay.<eos> Here's the thing. I'm not from the candy tree department.<eos> Lying to a child.<eos> Shame on you, Ralph.<eos> But I wasn't lying about the medal.<eos> That's why I was climbing the tree.<eos> It's precious to me.
What do you want, Candy?<eos> Listen, I just want to talk to you.<eos> I'm not interested in anything you have to say.<eos> How about this?<eos> Are you interested in this?<eos> My medal.<eos> How did you...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's yours!<eos> Go ahead, take it.
We're not going to fall down, it's OK. Come on.<eos> Hola!<eos> Gracias!<eos> I wasn't scared.<eos> That was exciting. Well done, Pollo.<eos> That's awesome. Jews are not meant for tragedy.<eos> We don't handle it well.<eos> Say "dead bodies!" (ALL) Dead bodies!<eos> Another message from Sofia.<eos> You want to know what it says?
Please! Please!<eos> Help!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> Monica!<eos> We gotta find his hand!<eos> We gotta stop the bleeding!<eos> We have to go! No!<eos> No! Ariel!<eos> Ariel!<eos> I see it! I see it!
You behaved badly.<eos> Very badly.<eos> And who was responsible for that?<eos> Give me a cup of tea.<eos> How nice!<eos> Alexei Alexandrovich has arrived.<eos> I'm not sure my nerves can stand another Alexei at this moment.<eos> Were you glad to see me or not?<eos> So the Schuzburgs asked us to dinner.<eos> The sauce was said to have cost a thousand rubles, and it was ghastly.

Take me home.<eos> Hush. I beg you, my dear.<eos> It was only a word or two.<eos> I have a word or two for some people one didn't expect to be rubbing shoulders with.<eos> She has a nerve, flaunting herself like a slut in society.<eos> Yes, why don't you?<eos> Rescue her and put your seal on the fiasco.<eos> Alexei, you see why she must divorce.<eos> Marriage will solve everything.<eos> When will it be?
I hate you!<eos> You destroyed my family!<eos> Good going!<eos> Should we go all the way?<eos> -It's too steep.<eos> We won't make it all the way.<eos> -Sure we will.<eos> I want to apologize to you, I've been a total mess.<eos> Why isn't my belly getting any smaller?<eos> Or maybe it has, just a little.
I will give you a blanket and some solid food.<eos> I know that you know him.<eos> I told you before, I won't talk to you.<eos> Have it your way.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> When you lie to me, I hurt you.<eos> Grab me the bucket.<eos> — Huh? — C'mon, grab the bucket.<eos> Put some water in it.

Nope.<eos> This is.<eos> I...<eos> I...<eos> - Grandpa!<eos> - Peter!<eos> - Thank you so much.<eos> - What happened?<eos> It says here there was a curse put on the gem to prevent any cat from misusing it again.<eos> If a cat was greedy for power, it would get everlasting life, but in the form of a statue.
And I must extend my gratitude to six very important little archeologists.<eos> First, my grandson, Peter.<eos> And then, of course, the Buddies!<eos> And now, without further ado the lost Cat's Eye necklace of Cleocatra.<eos> Wow.<eos> If only your great grandpappy, Digger, could see you.<eos> Chips off the old block, five doggone explorer pups.<eos> - He'd be very proud.<eos> - That's a cool necklace.<eos> Yes, it is beautiful, isn't it, Pete?
- Why you need to go there? - Mirta!<eos> Mom, Dad knows how's he important to me.<eos> I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Very much.<eos> Mirta, look at the time!<eos> I go to Ramonsito, did not bring flour, yet.<eos> Wait. You're not going to do what you shouldn't?<eos> You fell yesterday and hit your head.<eos> Look at the jam. Otherwise, it burns!
- Where did you go till now?<eos> - Dancing.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Somewhere outside Rome.<eos> Goodness gracious!<eos> Water!<eos> Anyway, I knew about the bare ownership deal.<eos> I couldn't tell you but Dad and I killed the Countess.<eos> I'm cold.<eos> I'm here to make sure no one finds the body, and to wait for it to turn to dust.
Isn't he?<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - 14, you know that.<eos> What planet are you from?<eos> Can't you see what shits your parents are?<eos> They don't even realize they have a psycho son in a basement who reads upside down.<eos> Psychopath. "L made that scene more cruel and playful..."<eos> You'll get a rush of blood to your head.<eos> "Then the night lost its normal dimension."<eos> "In fact, it remains one of the longest nights..."
But then I got messed up with dope and I stopped.<eos> The photos you saw are part of a series called "l am a wall".<eos> - What wall?<eos> - It's a metaphor.<eos> Basically it's me becoming that wall, entering the wallpaper, going inside the plaster.<eos> - Like a lizard...<eos> - Not like a lizard.<eos> Virtually, I wanted to de-materialize.<eos> Me and you, if we didn't have a point of view anymore, we'd be the same.<eos> Yes, I mean... without a point of view, we'd stop being... against each other and accept reality for what it is, without judging it.
If there's one walker, we use our knives.<eos> We keep things quiet.<eos> We save ammunition.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We need dry goods ahead of the winter.<eos> Warm clothes.<eos> Fuel.<eos> Maybe we get a break.<eos> You gotta think the cold affects them.<eos> If it doesn't kill them, it's gotta slow them down.
Please decide, either of you, both of you, but leave me out.<eos> Not speaking out or killing him yourself, there's no difference.<eos> All right, that's enough.<eos> Anybody wants the floor before we make a final decision has the chance.<eos> You once said that we don't kill the living.<eos> Well, that was before the living tried to kill us.<eos> But don't you see?<eos> If we do this, the people that we were, the world that we knew is dead.<eos> And this new world is ugly.<eos> It's harsh.
Ow, ow, ow! My... ass.<eos> If Tommy had bounced the other way, he would have blobbed himself right off the building, and that would have been the end of Tommy.<eos> Tommy, I got a couple cheeseburgers coming your way.<eos> Thank you for launching me over that building safely.<eos> Outside of Streetbike Tommy, you guys are far superior athletes.<eos> Uh, we're more theatrical with our costumes... and man-on-man contact.<eos> You guys have more things with motors in them, and we do more pranks.<eos> I came from Jackass, and when I met the Nitro family, it felt very familiar to me.<eos> I get the dynamics of it right away.<eos> It's like all the same inbred family.
- Here he comes.<eos> - Commit, commit, commit, commit.<eos> It hurts so bad.<eos> Get me on the floor. Get me on the ground.<eos> Hubert, I'm so proud of you!<eos> Is it out? Is it out?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> His shoulder's out.<eos> Can we get a shoulder back in with a side of relish, please?<eos> You know what? I don't think it is.
- Everyone, in my opinion, might be a little too close. But he is coming, and I gotta go watch this.<eos> That's so rough!<eos> Grab him!<eos> Get him, get him, get him!<eos> - Looks like your beard-it's a little singed.<eos> - Is my beard good?<eos> It's safe. It's safe.<eos> There's no singes, bro. Came out clean.<eos> Then we're good.<eos> This is the ramp setup for Vegas, so test it out. See if it works.
It is one thing to watch it on television, but live and in person, it is like seeing a U.F.O.<eos> You can never fully appreciate it until you see it live.<eos> We're a couple minutes from showtime.<eos> And I've never been so nervous in all my life.<eos> Go, Travis!<eos> Travis!<eos> Travis!<eos> Travis!<eos> I had no idea what the hell I was even showing up to.<eos> I just walked in the arena, and it was packed.
I used to think that we could only live in a certain way, with malice in our hearts.<eos> Until I met you.<eos> I don't want this story to end as a tragedy.<eos> - I like westerns.<eos> We could ride on into the sunset together.<eos> As we try to find our place in the world all we have is each other and a disease that will forever follow us.<eos> I understand what I am now... Where I belong. And even though we need blood to survive.<eos> It's family that gives us life. And it's our family that will ultimately let us know where we belong.<eos> This is our story.<eos> And even if we don't realize where it will end. Or even if it's just beginning we do know...
- Like a 50-footer.<eos> - Nothing crazy. Great, but it's the first two weeks of September.<eos> - It's the beginning-- - Get a sub.<eos> You don't wanna miss this.<eos> - This is gonna be truly great.<eos> - It's gonna be amazing. - Breakfast, lunch, dinner.<eos> - You pull out fish right out of the ocean, they cook them up.<eos> It's incredible. Snorkeling, diving. Totally different on a boat.<eos> "He couldn't stop thinking about that story.<eos> Where did it come from?
I read your book.<eos> I liked it very, very much.<eos> Thank you. I appreciate that.<eos> And now forgive an old fan for a moment. Just indulge me.<eos> You wrote about Paris right after the war.<eos> And when I read your stories, I was right there.<eos> I tasted that wine, the sweetness of that wine.<eos> I made love to the girl.<eos> I sat in the cafe that morning wondering what the future held for me.<eos> Or if it held anything at all for me.
- Well, okay, you talked me into it.<eos> - Okay, I thought you'd never ask.<eos> - Let's slam these.<eos> I wanna see where you write.<eos> I can assure you, it's not that exciting.<eos> Why don't you let me be the judge of that?<eos> This place, it's....<eos> - Empty.<eos> - Empty, yeah.<eos> Somehow it's exactly the way I imagined it.
Why exactly to this bar?<eos> Do you want to be the girl without a cane?<eos> To be picked up by the guy again?<eos> Which guy?<eos> Mister "Brandy Portugues".<eos> "Local speciality".<eos> I can go.<eos> Where do you want to go?<eos> To this bar on the corner.<eos> I know where it is.
I want to write.<eos> I want to tell your story.<eos> - You want to write my story?<eos> - Yeah, I do.<eos> It's powerful and because nobody says...<eos> Nobody talks about all the things that happen to you.<eos> - You know?<eos> - I know.<eos> And I just...<eos> I think it will help somebody.
- Love you.<eos> - Love you too.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - Better.<eos> Good.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> In our local hero report, one young man is making a difference in the lives of young people in crisis.<eos> Jamie Tworkowski wrote a story about a local girl, Renee Yohe, who was suffering from addiction, depression and bipolar disorder and got clean with the help of her friends.<eos> He posted her story on Myspace titled "To Write Love On Her Arms"<eos> and it quickly went viral.
I'm just...<eos> No, I've got, you know, irons in the fire...<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I'm just excited, you know?<eos> I've got a lot of stuff going on at the moment.<eos> It's really a busy time for me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Look what I got.<eos> Your watch.<eos> - And it... Yeah?
Man.<eos> You!<eos> You sobriety celebrity you!<eos> Dude, I don't want to talk about this.<eos> Aren't you supposed to be at that party right now?<eos> I'm the last person who should be telling anyone how to live their lives.<eos> I was in rehab for six months.<eos> I am exactly the...<eos> I'm exactly the same.<eos> The thing that people love about you and your story is that it's honest.
Schooled?<eos> I'm not a dog.<eos> What do you do for a living?<eos> Nothing special.<eos> I'm just a hairdresser.<eos> Hairdresser.<eos> Why is it so funny?<eos> Because I wear a wig?<eos> No, no, it looks nice.<eos> It looks good.
Finally, your legs are moved out of your line of sight and into our patented Schlaaang stirrups, to give you a viewing experience you'll never forget.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh!<eos> I gotta tell you.<eos> My favorite thing about this whole Schlaaang Super Seat is the automatic popcorn machine in the armrest.<eos> Of course, be careful. I... you know, I actually did this.<eos> That hot butter is gonna come spurting out.<eos> Don't get it on your hand.<eos> It's gonna burn.
- Hi, I'm Eric Wareheim.<eos> And I'm Tim Heidecker.<eos> And we are from Dobis P.R.<eos> We saw your commercial, and we're here to run the mall and make that billion.<eos> Do you want to watch "Top Gun"?<eos> - Right now?<eos> - I love that movie.<eos> - You have a copy?<eos> - I have it here somewhere.<eos> There it is.
Don't get near me.<eos> Erika.<eos> Kaori.<eos> Kaori!<eos> Oh good.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> What... happened... to me.<eos> The train suddenly derailed.<eos> Horrible.<eos> Everyone please listen carefully... help is on it's way.
OK, here's how it is.<eos> You've been awake for five days, you're king of the hill and you've just finished feeding your nose.<eos> There's a chick hanging on to you, babbling on, but you can't hear a word she says.<eos> All your senses are mixed up and have stopped working the way they should.<eos> You're wondering where the hell you are, and whose place this is where you've been hanging out for as long as you can remember, could be two hours or two days.<eos> Not that it fucking matters, what's more important is where you were before, and i'm not talking about this club or that bar,<eos> No, you need to go further back. Cause even though you know deep down that the journey ends in darkness, it doesn't necessarily mean that it started in darkness.
- Oh. - Are you ready?<eos> - Ah.<eos> Here we go.<eos> - Oh, what fun.<eos> - Igor!<eos> Hello, ladies. I forget your name. Your name starts with an f, I think.<eos> Look alive, soldier.<eos> This shit's about to jump off.<eos> Hello, bandana man. I see you've found my favorite tiki bar.<eos> I hope it's treating you well.
Can't I go to the top?<eos> What about a couple?<eos> Both ready to take a chance on a new life?<eos> What couldn't they achieve?<eos> Is that your dream?<eos> I've got a lot of dreams but maybe that's the heart of them.<eos> WATSON: Excuse me?<eos> I was wondering if you could help me.<eos> I was told this was the way to third class, but the door seems to be locked.<eos> Well, that's 'cause it is locked. The clasp on Lady Manton's jewel case is jammed.
They're lowering a boat.<eos> Is that boat full?<eos> They're lowering it. We're too late.<eos> Hey!<eos> Do you know where they put the Italians?<eos> The ones they locked up? Why?<eos> Are you anxious to join them?<eos> Where are they? Where are they?<eos> Round that corner, last door at the end. But you won't get them out!<eos> The door's locked and it'll stay locked until it hits the ocean bed!
No, but thank you for thinking that.<eos> You?<eos> Nah, man.<eos> I'm just here visiting a buddy of mine.<eos> But it's not a bad place to kill a little time?<eos> I'm Nat.<eos> I'm Jesse.<eos> Do you hear that music, Ethan?<eos> It sounds like a celebration.<eos> I say we do a little sherlocking, find out where it's coming from and what's going on.
Come on.<eos> OK. Come on.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh my god.<eos> Jonathan.<eos> They've been watching us.<eos> Shh.<eos> Hey. Rachel's down.<eos> Grab another mask...<eos> Because we need it.
Oh! Who was given to me as a sacrifice by that despicable man...<eos> Fuck this!<eos> ... who then took his own life!<eos> See you later... shithead!<eos> That was you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Beet and Sal are dead...<eos> Great.<eos> There goes my fucking check.<eos> "Then the lust, when it conceives, bears sin
Fuck this!<eos> ... who then took his own life!<eos> See you later... shithead!<eos> That was you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Beet and Sal are dead...<eos> Great.<eos> There goes my fucking check.<eos> "Then the lust, when it conceives, bears sin<eos> "and the sin when it is full grown brings forth death."
Silence!<eos> It is somewhat suspicious, but...<eos> If the witness has forgotten, there's nothing we can do. Defense, is there anything else?<eos> Yes, well...<eos> Yes. Why were you...<eos> Why were you looking out the window in the first place?<eos> Because, outside the window... I heard glass breaking.<eos> Glass? Well, you know, a lampstand made of glass...<eos> Well, you know, a lampstand made of glass...<eos> Didn't it fall over?
Yes. Why were you...<eos> Why were you looking out the window in the first place?<eos> Because, outside the window... I heard glass breaking.<eos> Glass? Well, you know, a lampstand made of glass...<eos> Well, you know, a lampstand made of glass...<eos> Didn't it fall over?<eos> Did we even have such a thing at our firm?<eos> There were pieces of broken glass all over the crime scene.<eos> Objection!<eos> If you looked out the window because you heard the breaking glass, you wouldn't have known that it was a lampstand... because it would have already been broken by the time you got to the window.
Look! Both were taken after midnight. Objection!<eos> But...<eos> Larry's... Uh...<eos> This witness is not mistaken!<eos> Take that!<eos> Of the photos taken that night... there is one more!<eos> There's nothing in this picture!<eos> It's not what has been photographed that's important! The question is...<eos> Why does this photograph exist in the first place?<eos> The camera was set in a way that the shutter will trigger whenever it detected loud noises. Therefore! At the time when this photo was taken, at 23:30, there WAS a loud noise!
My informants told me Some days ago... that lands to Venice there's a man... a monk, which makes extraordinary wonders.<eos> Heals the lame, restores sight to the blind... and can be in two places at the same time.<eos> His name is Marco.<eos> Marco.<eos> It is the child's name who saved his life... many years ago.<eos> It was he who gave me this amulet.<eos> Is it okay like that?<eos> No, not enough color.<eos> It has to be deeper.<eos> If the color is very bright, It is wrong.
And then leave many arrows flying... towards me.<eos> 10, 20 and give me.<eos> Y...<eos> No.<eos> This is not your dream... Kara Mustafa.<eos> It is the dream of a woman...<eos> a woman of your harem.<eos> It is the dream of your favorites.<eos> Where is this woman?<eos> It is Italian.
I could almost smell him.<eos> Paul came to see me.<eos> I can't fucking believe it worked.<eos> Who's Paul?<eos> - Hi, boss.<eos> - Victor.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Well...<eos> You didn't seem very happy with the size of the palm tree, so I felt bad about it, like I failed in doing my job or so.<eos> Then I racked my brains and I think I found the solution to make it look taller.
- Victor.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Well...<eos> You didn't seem very happy with the size of the palm tree, so I felt bad about it, like I failed in doing my job or so.<eos> Then I racked my brains and I think I found the solution to make it look taller.<eos> Wonderful. How...<eos> How are you gonna do it?<eos> Well, it's quite simple.<eos> What I'm going to do is, uproot the palm tree, create a 3-foot high molehill, and then replant it on top of it.<eos> That way it will look taller.
We'd like...<eos> This is the NBC affiliate in Athens.<eos> We're looking to...<eos> In the wake of the deadly crash of SouthJet flight 227, we have more questions than answers as to what exactly happened that day.<eos> And like many, we are out looking for answers.<eos> Looking here at the home of pilot Captain William "Whip" Whitaker.<eos> We still have no sighting and no comments from the Captain himself.<eos> This is Mark Mellon, still on the hunt, from midtown Atlanta.<eos> You've reached the Whitaker Crop Dusting Company, flying lessons and plane rides.<eos> Please leave a message and it will be returned.
Like you're a protective husband, um, but you're a little bit scared.<eos> You're talking about when I'm asking the question? Yes.<eos> Um, you're still soft and scared.<eos> Um, a little less blatant.<eos> like...<eos> like you're really asking the question.<eos> But I'm asking the question because I'm scared?<eos> Right.<eos> Um, but you're not, like, sitting in your fear.<eos> Um, I just mean, like, um, y-your fear, um, it doesn't hinder you.
Come here.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I want you to give fat zombie a little kiss.<eos> Eww, no!<eos> - Why, is it 'cause he's fat?<eos> No!<eos> - My bad.<eos> So much for your magic orb.<eos> Let's eat.<eos> Uh, it's still flickering.
And chemo when you're twelve, like, sucks. But...<eos> I mean, chemo sucks in general, but twelve sucks It's when it happens.<eos> When what happens?<eos> Are you girls ready to order?<eos> Oh, I'll get the Cobb Salad, with the... oh, no chicken, no bacon, no cheese and no avocado.<eos> Mm... I'll get the burger and fries.<eos> but maybe with her bacon and her cheese, and do not bring me a dessert menu.<eos> I already know I want the cheesecake, the brownie cheesecake.<eos> I'm so glad you're not on that stupid diet anymore.<eos> It was making me a miserable person.
Poor fuck got sworn in, flown to Potsdam to deal with Stalin and Churchill, figure out what the fuck to do with post-war Germany and all of Europe.<eos> Geneva conference is completely different thing.<eos> So I think you meant Truman at Potsdam. Oh.<eos> I switched it, 'cause I'm a little drunk.<eos> It wouldn't have made sense anyway, because Truman had the trump card, he had the Bomb.<eos> So really, he was in control the whole time.<eos> Oh, do you believe in magic? Yes, I do.<eos> That's... abso- yes.<eos> Do you believe in a magic vagina? A magic vagina?<eos> It would bewitch you with its magic.
Yeah.<eos> Oh! It's beautiful!<eos> You okay?<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> Moments like these, I think to myself, my parents have no idea where I am right now.<eos> Ah.<eos> I'm so awake now.<eos> Watch me do a handstand!<eos> You're seriously making pancakes right now?<eos> I am. Yours has a sad face made out of chocolate chips, because the world is an asshole and it's gonna get you.
I've read your books.<eos> Neither do you.<eos> - You got it right in Kentucky Blood. I'll give you that.<eos> It's a fine piece of writing.<eos> But Cold Denver Morning, you got it wrong.<eos> - Blood Diner... - Look, that wasn't my fault.<eos> All right? Your bad theory helped a killer go free.<eos> You ruined people's lives.<eos> Now, this town doesn't need that.<eos> It needs to heal.
The Millers, woman with their younger son, were found stabbed inside their home, and police now are asking for any information that could lead to Christopher's return or the apprehension of any suspects involved in this vicious multiple murder and child abduction.<eos> Family Hanging Out.<eos> Pool Party.<eos> Barbecue.<eos> Sleepy Time.<eos> Really, I'm fine.<eos> I'd prefer to take you down to the hospital.<eos> You should get stitches. - Can't force you, though.<eos> - Yeah, and I'm not gonna go.<eos> The bleeding's stopped for now, but if it starts again or if there's any more swelling, call a doctor immediately.
I'm happy to answer that.<eos> Insulprin... Has been rigorously tested for five years.<eos> Subjects taking the drug are certainly no more likely to have heart attacks than the control group.<eos> We're very proud of insulprin here.<eos> It's gonna save a lot of lives.<eos> And earn billions of dollars.<eos> W-what does any of this have to do with Clark Weilman's murder?<eos> There was a lawsuit filed against this company by a man claiming his mother's coronary was caused by insulprin, maybe techsan.<eos> Yeah. I remember that suit.<eos> It was dismissed in summary judgment.
Scrape the wall?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Don't take the piss. Get the scrapers, get the sandpaper, get out there.<eos> Davey, you go with him. Show him what to do, will you, son?<eos> In the corridor. Get started as soon as you can.<eos> There you go, the dream team.<eos> Right, you and PC can start on this wall.<eos> Rhino, get the orange paint. You do the windows, and I don't mean the glass.<eos> Oh, fuck, Harry. No, I hate this colour.<eos> - You don't like it?
Oh. Have you heard from your witness?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'll save some time, kill me.<eos> Come on. I won't blame you.<eos> Every man's got his dark side.<eos> Just shoot me.<eos> Come on.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Your gun broke?<eos> No. It works just fine.
Tomorrow.<eos> I'm Francisco Xavier.<eos> Chico.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Martírio! Leave me be...<eos> Go on, shoo.<eos> What're you doing here? The Major sent me...<eos> There's a girl asleep next door.<eos> Don't make a noise, go away. Stop it, you'll wake the girl.
- I don't want to leave!<eos> - Come along!<eos> - Untie me!<eos> - Come away! Untie me!<eos> António!<eos> Untie me! Untie me!<eos> You'll all burn in Hell!<eos> Untie me!<eos> Forgive my asking... But have you seen this lady?<eos> It's a good likeness.
What did I say, Brites?<eos> A Portuguese head is harder than a Jacobin's bullet.<eos> Did I or didn't I?<eos> You did.<eos> And this dumb lot?<eos> Have they nothing to say?<eos> Can't speak our language, Father.<eos> They're English.<eos> Oh, are they?<eos> Don't speak it but understand, I bet.
- Yeah, me neither.<eos> Hey, if you need anything, give me a call.<eos> - Thanks, bro.<eos> - All right, brother.<eos> Call me.<eos> "Bad Ass."<eos> Come on, Baxter.<eos> My administration has organized a new initiative, which we are calling "Operation Street Cleaning. "<eos> We've also enhanced and increased local law enforcement, in order to rid our neighborhoods of crime and gang-related activity.<eos> It is the top priority of this administration to return our city back to the safety it once knew.
Oh, I get it.<eos> It's like a party line with computers.<eos> What the hell's a party line?<eos> It's where a group of people can call in all at the same time and talk to each other.<eos> It's kind of amazing.<eos> Where have you been, kid?<eos> Man, that's called a conference call.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> I think you're the only human being on the planet that's not on Facebook.<eos> I hooked you up with an email address, so if anyone offers a friend request, it'll come straight to your mailbox.
As do we all.<eos> But to grasp the heavens you must fight for something greater.<eos> Something beyond mere survival.<eos> You are my dominus.<eos> I fight for whatever you decide.<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a decision each man, whether slave or free born, must forge himself.<eos> It is yours alone.<eos> To your purpose.<eos> And the destiny it shall lead you to.
No, no, no.<eos> Shoot, did I leave any water in Bonny's bowl?<eos> I'd better go home and do that, and while I do, there's something I put in the LA Weekly that you should maybe read. 'Cause it's possible in the short term that you might be slightly mad at me.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Calling all psychopaths!<eos> Are you mental or deranged?<eos> Maybe you've recently been hospitalized, but are now okay.<eos> Or maybe the world just doesn't understand you.<eos> Yeah, right!<eos> Well, I'm writing a screenplay with my friend called the Seven Psychopaths, and if your story is crazy or quirky enough, we might use it for our movie.
Yeah, I know.<eos> I remember.<eos> Oh, my God. It's been years.<eos> How are you?<eos> Do you still have that great apartment downtown?<eos> Yep.<eos> Still in the same place.<eos> This is Phoebe.<eos> Hello. Have you seen his place?<eos> Yes, I have, and it is great.
Thank you.<eos> We have to promise to stop before it gets out of control.<eos> We make our million and we stop.<eos> Ready?<eos> Hello. How are you today?<eos> Good.<eos> Can I take your bag for you?<eos> No, no, I'd rather keep it here if that's okay.<eos> I'll take the full brazilian.<eos> I want it all gone, okay?
You took her body!<eos> The plans to the morgue were hidden in your house.<eos> You had it all worked out.<eos> You distracted the guard to confuse us.<eos> You knew he'd confuse us, but then he got run over, so you've been winging it all night, playing with us!<eos> What does it matter now?<eos> It was set up so that Mayka would be declared dead, and I'd confess.<eos> Nothing that happened tonight was an accident, believe me.<eos> Mayka has the power and money to vanish without a trace.<eos> It's perfect.
It's for you.<eos> Fifteen thousand dollars to Nick Elliott Racing?<eos> Mom, no.<eos> From my account, Dad doesn't have to know.<eos> Mom, what are you doing?<eos> It'll be our secret.<eos> Fifteen thousand dollars.<eos> Ha-ha-ha. Thanks, Morn.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This track is seven-eighths of a mile, the compound banking makes it fast.
Oh, honey, don't say that.<eos> It's true.<eos> I mean, all my life I've been the one that they write stories about, and now I'm just another anonymous shut-in with an online shopping addiction.<eos> Tell me, what can I do?<eos> Well...<eos> Since you asked, Georgina Sparks needs a recharge, so I've decided to take a mental health day, and I've found the perfect event to crash--<eos> Cece Rhodes' secret wake.<eos> What about "Gossip Girl"?<eos> The site can't go down all day.<eos> It won't.
Your mother knew all of my secrets, and she knew all of yours, too.<eos> Maybe that's why she left me everything.<eos> Ever since the accident, I've been blaming myself, blaming Louis, but it was Humphrey behind it all.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Yes, it is, and now that we know the truth, there is nothing in our way.<eos> Humphrey's not the reason we're not together, and neither is the dowry.<eos> Is this about saving my life again?<eos> Because we're past that.<eos> You said you wanted to wait until your marriage was over.<eos> Now it's over.
Do you think she'll break the news or will someone else beat her?<eos> I mean, there are a lot of media types here.<eos> Maybe Gossip Girl is here too, in which case, she doesn't have to worry.<eos> Gossip Girl doesn't need to travel to get news, she's got sources everywhere.<eos> Really?<eos> Even at a party like this?<eos> I mean, look around.<eos> Who would be sending Gossip Girl tips? Heh.<eos> All I'm saying is that this book party is a pretty big deal.<eos> Gossip Girl would have to post about it to stay relevant.
I'm just messing with you.<eos> I met your father when he was still with Elizabeth.<eos> I was very young. I couldn't resist him.<eos> He was charming, handsome.<eos> It felt as if he had the whole world at his feet.<eos> I knew he was involved with someone else.<eos> You mean married?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We had an affair.<eos> And it only ended when I got pregnant.
Thanks.<eos> Hey, Amy, would you give me Andrew Tyler?<eos> And if you can't reach him, see if you can find any information online about a woman named Elizabeth fisher.<eos> So as I was cleaning out my closet this morning, I suddenly had a brilliant-- And highbrow.<eos> Thank you, Dorota.<eos> A brilliant and extremely highbrow idea.<eos> Such a shame to have all these beautiful accessories that are hidden from the world the vast majority of the time.<eos> So I decided to allow F.I.T. To exhibit my shoe and handbag collection.<eos> This is the purse I brought to prom, and, of course, that is the shoe that Louis brought back to me from Paris in the beginning of our storybook romance.<eos> Which ended even more famously than it began, didn't it?
Well, I was thinking, maybe since I'm the one that saw Diana transcribing, if I see the day planner again, that may jog my memory.<eos> Too bad Chuck has it.<eos> Looks like we might have a lead, thanks to Blair's powers of observation.<eos> But unfortunately, the entire clue trail hangs by the flimsiest of threads--<eos> Nate's long-term memory.<eos> If you'll excuse me...<eos> Hello?<eos> Did you find your inspiration?<eos> Yes.<eos> Uh, but the only problem is, it's in Rome.
Whatever you saw, or you think you saw, you can't tell Chuck.<eos> Of course I'm going to tell him.<eos> He has a right to know.<eos> And there's nothing you can do that will make me change my mind.<eos> This isn't about me.<eos> Do you realize how many people will get hurt if this gets out?<eos> You need to go.<eos> You've already complicated things enough by being here.<eos> This whole thing was supposed to go off without a hitch.<eos> You better hope it still does.
Or if you'd like some tea, I can call the maid.<eos> - I had some at the Palace.<eos> - I know.<eos> Clearly.<eos> I had a tea, too, at the Palace. If anyone's interested.<eos> Do you know the big problem with a disguise, Mr Holmes?<eos> However hard you try, it's always a self-portrait.<eos> You think I'm a vicar with a bleeding face?<eos> No, I think you're damaged, delusional and believe in a higher power.<eos> In your case, it's yourself.
- The scream?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Donovan? I bet it was Donovan.<eos> Am I somehow responsible for the kidnapping?<eos> Ah, Moriarty's smart.<eos> He planted that doubt in her head.<eos> That little nagging sensation you got to have to be strong to resist.<eos> You can't kill an idea, can you?<eos> Not once it's made a home... there.
It's a simple question, brosephine.<eos> Broseph... Yeah, yeah. Of course, everyone does.<eos> Ah.<eos> - Homo.<eos> - Say what?<eos> What?<eos> You really think you're having better sex than your parents?<eos> You think that your father loved your mother's beautiful pussy any less because she had more hair down there?<eos> Don't be talking about my mom's pussy. What?<eos> I said it was beautiful, man.
And all of you will submit to him. Cool?<eos> You said 'submit' instead of 'stand by'.<eos> What is 'stand by'? - Total support.<eos> So what's 'submit'?<eos> - Total surrender.<eos> So I was right.<eos> To break this syndicate, the government started auctioning on the internet.<eos> So the bids became faceless and the bidders didn't fear the syndicate.<eos> The Auction's done. - When?<eos> The bastards did it on the internet.
What the fuck am I talk-<eos> - What the fuck are you talkin' about?<eos> - l'm talkin' about the fact that you're always fuckin' late,man.<eos> - Oh,all right.<eos> That's some real passive-aggressive shit,right?<eos> You think your time is more valuable than my time,don't you? - Actually-<eos> - Actually,I don't. - l sense that shit,man.<eos> I don't.<eos> But-- but in a larger sense,my time will always be my time.<eos> So it will always mean more to me personally.
Charlie'Il understand. And if he doesn't,fuck him and his bald head.<eos> - We do have a great life.<eos> - We do.<eos> - We're so lucky.<eos> - Totally.<eos> Which is exactly why we should do it. Yeah. What?<eos> You're in a really exciting place right now.<eos> I mean,most people don't even get to where you are.<eos> It's like... the American dream or some shit.<eos> We should just ride the wave and see where it takes us.
Look at that, huh?<eos> She'll crack your ribs.<eos> Found my phone.<eos> My bad.<eos> All right, smile, Bobby.<eos> Ooh, my boss at SPD will love that one.<eos> He'll love that one.<eos> I got a gun, man!<eos> What?<eos> What? Forgot it in my car.
There would have been blood everywhere.<eos> Linden, turn off your flashlight and get the hell out of there.<eos> Re you doing?<eos> It's a key card.<eos> There was someone else in here that night.<eos> Besides Ames, besides Nicole.<eos> A key card.<eos> The mayor.<eos> Damn it, Linden, turn off your flashlight!<eos> It's off.
I'm just trying, though it may sound pompous, to teach him literature.<eos> And thus, a bit about life.<eos> Literature teaches us nothing about life. Is that so?<eos> The nutcase who killed John Lennon carried a book,<eos> The Catcher in the Rye<eos> What did literature teach him? Nothing.<eos> Obviously your art exhibits teach us much more.<eos> My art exhibits are the same.<eos> Art in general teaches us nothing.<eos> It awakens our senses to beauty. Wine?
You're right.<eos> He's gifted. But this version is even more snarky and disdainful.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yes.<eos> He's manipulating you. He's the one teaching you a lesson.<eos> You know Dostoyevsky's secret?<eos> His genius? Turning normal... I mean pathetic, wretched human beings into unforgettable characters.<eos> But if you'd rather do caricature... You said look close.<eos> I write what I see.<eos> If all you can see is ugliness, fine. But transpose it, transform it.
It's not a dream Zane!<eos> And if you touch Allison, you're a dead man.<eos> I'm talking to Zane!<eos> That jackass!<eos> He's... trouble.<eos> If... if you're at my place, then you're in my body.<eos> Yep.<eos> You went a little nuts with the hair trimmer, don't you think?<eos> I believe in manscaping.<eos> You should try it, sheriff Sasquatch. This is disgusting.
Crap.<eos> It's okay. I'm probing my own brain, Allie.<eos> It's so not okay.<eos> Allison, do you want me to disengage the gloves?<eos> No, leaving the probe there could cause permanent damage.<eos> We're gonna have to maneuver it out the way it came in.<eos> But we don't know what we're doing. I'm gonna guide you through it, okay?<eos> Grace, if you could set up the haptic telepresence readout on the main monitor there, that would be fantastic.<eos> Jack, it's like a video game, okay?<eos> Now use your hands to pull out the probe the same way it went in.
Well, what did he do?<eos> Yeah, well, we'll get to the brother in a second. That's really a very serious police matter.<eos> What we are interested in in the moment is Becky and this theft.<eos> And what is the theft?<eos> Well, I have a customer here with me that says her purse was taken.<eos> Ye...<eos> Well, you know, I was out there the whole time, and, you know, I didn't see anyone complain about a purse being stolen.<eos> Yeah, no, I'm sorry. You're right. Excuse me.<eos> Not her purse. Money from her purse.<eos> She says that Becky... It was on the counter, the purse, and Becky stuck her hand in and snatched it out.
We had three Starks to trade.<eos> You chopped one's head off and let another escape.<eos> Father will be furious.<eos> It must be odd for you to be the disappointing child.<eos> My lord, may the old gods watch over your brother and all our Northern sons.<eos> The walls of my holdfast will not stand the winter.<eos> The stones were last mortared in the time of King Aerys, and I'm afraid the masons today are not fit to carry their fathers' hammers.<eos> When I was a boy, I remember seeing them put up a new tower at Torrhen's Square in a summer.<eos> Men worked back then.<eos> Today, my holdfast looks like it was built by drunk children.
A large neo-Renaissance fireplace.<eos> Notice the 2 lionesses, which are unusual in this country.<eos> We generally have stags, does and game on our hearths.<eos> This is more exotic. But there's a reason: remember that La Païva was a courtesan, and hierarchically, a lioness is a confirmed courtesan who chaperones young courtesans.<eos> Conversely, beginners are called lorettes. The name is from Our Lady of Lorette, where the beginners would meet.<eos> Still in the Fontainebleau style, there's another evocation on the ceiling of assertive but feared femininity:<eos> the goddess Diane the huntress, with a stag, befitting the tradition.<eos> In this room, the marquise received her favoured guests, like Théophile Gautier and the Goncourt brothers, and cultivated her literary circle, exclusively male, of course.<eos> Now we see the mansion's rear façade.<eos> It's decorated in the same style as the main façade:
Thank you.<eos> Look, um.<eos> I've got these college pamphlets and I was thinking maybe you could take a look at them.<eos> And we could talk about how to get you a tour to visit them.<eos> You know? Maybe one weekend?<eos> That sound exciting?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Ok.<eos> We don't have to return to Mexico to be reminded of what poverty looks like.<eos> It's just a few blocks away from us.
Yet one but flatters us,<eos> As well appeareth by the cause you come, Namely, to appeal each other of high treason.<eos> Cousin of Hereford, What dost thou object Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?<eos> First - heaven be the record to my speech! In the devotion of a subject's love,<eos> And free from other misbegotten hate, Come I appellant to this princely presence.<eos> My body shall make good upon this earth, Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.<eos> Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,<eos> Too good to be so, and too bad to live,<eos> Since the more fair and crystal is the sky, The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.<eos> First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me From giving reins and spurs to my free speech, Which else would post until it had returned
By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly That bids me be of comfort any more.<eos> Go to Flint Castle. There I'll pine away. A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.<eos> My lord, one word.<eos> He does me double wrong That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.<eos> Discharge my followers.<eos> Let them hence away From Richard's night To Bolingbroke's fair day.<eos> What, will not this castle yield?<eos> The castle royally is manned, my lord, against thy entrance.<eos> Royally?<eos> Why? It contains no king.

The shadow of your sorrow hath destroyed The shadow of your face.<eos> Say that again.<eos> The shadow of my sorrow!<eos> Let's see<eos> It is very true, my grief lies all within;<eos> And these external manners of laments Are merely shadows to the unseen grief That swells with silence in the tortured soul;<eos> There lies the substance<eos> And I thank thee, king, For thy great bounty, That not only givest<eos> I'll beg one boon, And then be gone and trouble you no more.<eos> Shall I obtain it?
And so I am, then crushing penury Persuades me I was better when a king;<eos> Then am I kinged again and by and by Think that I am unkinged by Bolingbroke,<eos> And straight am nothing:<eos> But whate'er I be, Nor I nor any man that but man is With nothing shall be pleased,<eos> Music do I hear?<eos> Keep time<eos> How sour sweet music is, When time is broke and no proportion kept!<eos> So is it in the music of men's lives.<eos> I wasted time, And now doth time waste me.<eos> This music mads me; let it sound no more;

You're so sweet to me, Charlie.<eos> What can I say, you, uh, summon the sweetness in me.<eos> As well as some other stuff.<eos> Yes, I can tell.<eos> - Well, guess what.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't work for Stu and Marcy any more.<eos> I know.<eos> You told me.<eos> So, this whole thing isn't quite as inappropriate as it once was.
Some things are more powerful than even you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't let this destroy all the good in you.<eos> Just... because we can't be together doesn't mean I won't love you.<eos> Just because we can't be together doesn't mean I won't love you.<eos> I hope Chuck's gonna be okay.<eos> Well, I'd be mad, too, if I was left with no explanation.<eos> I promise I'll be more sensitive in our breakup.<eos> Hey, why don't we, um, discuss our options while we raid Dorota's candy stash?<eos> We can't end our fake relationship the night it started, anyway.
Blair drinks.<eos> This game is kicking my ass.<eos> Shake that. Drink, drink, drink, drink.<eos> No!<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, get it!<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Serena's column.<eos> I gotta hand it to her.<eos> It's great.
No!<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh, get it!<eos> What's so funny?<eos> Serena's column.<eos> I gotta hand it to her.<eos> It's great.<eos> And I'm not the only one that thinks so.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> The whole city's reading it.
Yeah, that's fine by me.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Trapped under the weight of a false accusation, I've done a lot of thinking about the kind of girl I want to be from now on.<eos> I'd like to be the kind... Who does what she says she's going to do.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mr. Bass, welcome.<eos> Right on time.<eos> I have no interest in niceties.<eos> Just tell me what you know.<eos> I know what is in Blair Waldorf's heart, and if you don't want this wedding to happen, together, we can make sure it doesn't.
I told Estee we'd stop by, but there's no way I can bring a royal minder to my ex's apartment.<eos> Looks like you'll have to wear a school uniform and play Cupid in my place.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> This is very bad plan.<eos> Damn!<eos> Nate's party has been moved a suite at The Empire.<eos> So?<eos> So he lives with Chuck.<eos> I doubt Blair is gonna risk running into her ex with a royal minder in tow.<eos> When I drop my bomb, the person it would hurt the most won't be there.
It is.<eos> Okay. You go back to bed.<eos> I'll call you when the sun's up.<eos> That's like 10 minutes from now.<eos> 10 minutes, I'll call you back.<eos> You better not.<eos> I love you, Nathan Scott.<eos> I love you, too, angel. Sweet dreams.<eos> People say hell is endless.<eos> They say it's our worst nightmare, the face of our darkness.

Well, is there anything I can do?<eos> Oh, she's just beautiful, Haley.<eos> Those big eyes.<eos> Her daddy's gonna be busy protecting the castle.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> Well, well.<eos> The old gray mare.<eos> She ain't what she used to be.<eos> Imagine that...<eos> Robert Theodore Davis in a church, and it's still standing.
I'm kissing my boyfriend.<eos> That's a great answer.<eos> The only thing better than waking up with you is ending the night with you.<eos> Yeah, there's your little bear.<eos> Let's take a look.<eos> Oh, you got your bear?<eos> Did you get your bear.<eos> People say hell is endless.<eos> Oh, it's so exciting.<eos> They say it's our worst nightmare.
Come on, bring it!<eos> You can do better than that!<eos> That's all you got?<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> We could have been champions!<eos> Give me the pitch pipe, you bitch!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Give it to me!
Everyone out!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Andrei?<eos> Harker, just go!<eos> Something's blocking the door!<eos> Anytime, Harker!<eos> It's stuck!
No, there's no time.<eos> There's not long till sundown.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Johnny, no.<eos> Wait, what are you talking about?<eos> He wants to go back to Nikolai's nightclub.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> That crypt is one of the largest in Bucharest.<eos> It could be connected to a dozen more, for all we know.
Go ahead, Celeste.<eos> Uh, we got another problem.<eos> This is bigger than you or me, Detective.<eos> Much, much bigger.<eos> Kat!<eos> Katya!<eos> John, we have to go.<eos> Yeah.<eos> When the main power came back on, so did the transmitter relay.<eos> It's sending the bats back downtown.
Do you know what I do with it?<eos> Nothing!<eos> Nothing, because I'm responsible.<eos> What will you do in Denmark?<eos> I'll marry a Dane I don't know. It will cost me 5000 Euros.<eos> If you don't mind, I'd like to relax now.<eos> A white marriage?<eos> Congratulations!<eos> I won't tell anyone.<eos> Marriage is no longer what it used to be.
Yes...<eos> Crap...<eos> Here we go again.<eos> This is crazy!<eos> We thought you'd like it.<eos> It did make me feel better.<eos> No, it's the wine and the champagne... And you're all so nice...<eos> It's...<eos> Even if the story isn't true...<eos> It's true.

Go.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It's gonna kill us.<eos> It's gonna fucking kill us all.<eos> Chris!<eos> - Won't be seeing him again.<eos> - What are we gonna do?<eos> - I just wanna get out of here.<eos> - We can't because the shutters are down.<eos> My unit's the best bet. It locks from the inside. In case...
Tomatoes.<eos> She's a keeper.<eos> Frank!<eos> Karen!<eos> Breakfast!<eos> I moved it. Hey!<eos> Good morning.<eos> I, uh, I can't find my watch.<eos> I have looked everywhere.<eos> It's on your wrist.
Suddenly they realise there's one pile of cash between two deliveries, and the numbers don't add up.<eos> They're a case light.<eos> It's a mess.<eos> They can't go back to the client, cos they can't prove who screwed up.<eos> So they do the only thing they can do.<eos> Absorb the loss, and keep it as quiet as possible.<eos> And the missing case?<eos> Wherever we want it to be.<eos> We move it around.<eos> Keep it hidden.
You'll be doing me a favour.<eos> So, I've got some great news.<eos> I got clearance for the post.<eos> What's that?<eos> The head of security job.<eos> They're going to let me create it.<eos> Pay band G.<eos> Ah, that's great!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Still got to formally advertise it,
Burt, finally we work Mr Galloway quarter?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - I expected.<eos> Do you realize that you have taught The final task yet?<eos> Yes.<eos> I am here.<eos> - Further customize it a little.<eos> - Of course.<eos> To write is to rewrite, Mr Duffy teacher.<eos> If you do not have it on your desk Tomorrow, you little.
Sit down. Lean over.<eos> Turn around... with... your back turned... yes...<eos> No, not this.<eos> I can't get it...<eos> Is it my fault?<eos> Of course not.<eos> What must the sculpture be like?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What will its name be?<eos> What will it look like?
But above all,the Sforzas.<eos> Their betrayal of our papacy shall be avenged.<eos> By who?<eos> This headless cock?<eos> Will you stop this discord!<eos> We are family!<eos> We are one!<eos> And we will only triumph as one!<eos> For we have a second task.<eos> It is called renewal.
Let Rome be full of joy!<eos> Interesting.<eos> Thank you,Madam.<eos> But your animal lacks physical concreteness.<eos> That creature is more cow than bull,surely.<eos> Pardon me?<eos> You have,how should I put it?<eos> Desexed the creature.<eos> It is a bull,surely,Madam.<eos> It looks like a bull,it stands like a bull.
You are a cleric, not a soldier.<eos> Then, yes.<eos> I have a secret.<eos> The whole of Rome is whispering.<eos> Of our dark son.<eos> So let us instruct you in the art of vengeance.<eos> Do I need lessons?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Vengeance should never be seen as that.<eos> It should always be unexpected.

Do I need lessons?<eos> Perhaps.<eos> Vengeance should never be seen as that.<eos> It should always be unexpected.<eos> And it should rarely be public.<eos> You learnt this from the Lord?<eos> We know little of war, but much of vengeance.<eos> And the one salient point is this: Vengeance is patient.<eos> It can wait a lifetime if necessary.<eos> Because it never dies.
I appreciate the informality of your welcome.<eos> What is the news from Florence?<eos> Ah,officially,I am here to open the shutters of the Villa Medici for my master,Piero de Medici.<eos> Stones have been thrown at his house in Florence.<eos> Large stones.<eos> He believes he will be safer here in Rome.<eos> Not without our protection.<eos> The Medici have made many enemies; that cannot be contested.<eos> What of the Medici bank?<eos> Is it a sinking ship?
I would make a gift of gold to my father.<eos> Does your father not have gold enough of his own?<eos> No,this is Medici gold.<eos> My father holds no affection for the Medici.<eos> He brands them thieves and liars.<eos> All bankers are thieves and liars,Eminence.<eos> I would rather trust a beggar in the street.<eos> Listen.<eos> A shipment of gold hidden in alum ore is to travel from Florence to Castelfiorentino.<eos> It shall be ours.
Yalla.<eos> Almost there now.<eos> Come.<eos> Harrek.<eos> Salama Alaykum<eos> Breathe in slow-<eos> Here you will find nothing but friends.<eos> What is it they're smoking?<eos> It is opium.<eos> When you cut the poppy, it cries.
I married one of your choosing to be free to love you.<eos> But you were not the pope's daughter!<eos> Rodrigo,she will love whom she chooses.<eos> She is a Borgia.<eos> I hear the Pallavicini boys have gone.<eos> Yes,because you would marry a pauper with a paint brush.<eos> I would have married Calvino Pallavicini as you bid,dear father.<eos> But if I had followed my heart, I doubt I would have married either of them.<eos> Oh,so, the future of this family is in thrall to your heart?<eos> If it is, it needs mending.
You put daggers in their hearts.<eos> You want them to go on their knees and kiss your feet for reuniting them?<eos> It's a crime to want us to be as we were?<eos> You need to give it time, Niklaus.<eos> I've had a thousand years on the other side to be angry and to heal.<eos> I'm here to make sure this family does the same.<eos> I just don't understand.<eos> I killed you and still you forgive me.<eos> It's been my dream for a thousand years that this family could be as one.<eos> Forgiveness is not a chore. It's a gift.
Think of it as a peace offering.<eos> Fine.<eos> More for me.<eos> We called you here because I need help with a spell.<eos> Esther created a vampire that can't be killed.<eos> I want to desiccate him like you did to mikael.<eos> Bonnie...<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Your magic comes from the earth.<eos> It's pure.
Soon as we get the stake, hand over the coffin, get out.<eos> Alaric's got the police looking...<eos> - ...for Klaus' car.<eos> - Will do.<eos> Gotta go.<eos> The Original sister's here.<eos> It's about time, sexy Bex...<eos> - Where is Klaus?<eos> - How did you find me?<eos> Oh, you'd be amazed how competent law enforcement is... when it's not corrupted by vampires.
Matt, look out!<eos> Dad?<eos> We're gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> You're not gonna fight back?<eos> You're kind of invincible, Ric.<eos> Don't call me that.<eos> We're not friends.<eos> We were.<eos> Our friendship was part of the problem.<eos> It's what kept me weak.
Someone said they saw AnnaBeth coming out of your office.<eos> I made her tell me why.<eos> All I know is, no one has gotten, you know since the pact.<eos> I need to find another non-curse reason.<eos> Like, is there anything that you all have in common?<eos> - We like pink.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> And God. We like God.<eos> I just saw the lemonade.<eos> It's supposed to be dyed pink, but it's red.
I never realized how funny you were, AB.<eos> Thanks for calling me the other night.<eos> I'm really glad you did.<eos> Oh, you surprised me too. You were so brave with that whole Belle initiation.<eos> You helped me with my fertility situation even though you didn't have to.<eos> And this is seriously the best night I've had in ages.<eos> The movie, the wine, no coasters.<eos> And this pizza is incredible.<eos> It's frozen from the Dixie Stop.<eos> It tastes like cardboard and spray cheese.
Sam, it's Jody Mills.<eos> I wake you?<eos> The sheriff?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Uh, I mean, uh --<eos> Listen, I got something that smells like you boys.<eos> A body turned up in Canton, Ohio.<eos> Local P.D.'s trying to bury the story and the body.<eos> Okay, um, so, uh, what's up with the body?<eos> Well, when it went missing, it was a perfectly normal grad student named Charles Durbin.

Hey, Untouchable!<eos> Dean!<eos> Hey!<eos> No!<eos> You! Destroyed everything!<eos> Hey, Chronos? !<eos> Was that the best you got?<eos> You want to know your future?<eos> I know your future.<eos> It's covered in thick black ooze.
Yeah, but great benefits package.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah. - 10% co-pay on all drugs.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Oh, but just generic, right?<eos> No, no, name brands are cool. Huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... What's our boy here weigh?<eos> A buck 90.<eos> Thrown against a wall so hard it buckled.
Hey. Stop cheating.<eos> You heard him.<eos> Knock it off.<eos> [IN UNISON] Jackass.<eos> Tyler, soup's on.<eos> TYLER:<eos> But, Mom, I don't want...<eos> WOMAN:<eos> Eat it.<eos> - But it sucks.
Japanese booze monster.<eos> I guess that would explain why you got to be drunk to see it. Very poetic.<eos> Creepy. Sam: Okay.<eos> So, a Shojo is said to roam where there's lots of alcohol.<eos> There's lore saying that, back in the old day, if you were plastered enough, you could see one skulking around the breweries in Japan.<eos> Yeah, but why is this one shredding brewers' kids?<eos> Apparently, you can harness the will of a Shojo with the right spell box.<eos> Then you basically have an attack dog that you can sic on whatever sort of personal revenge mission you want.<eos> So Dale nabs one to punish his pals.<eos> Send the bottle, sooner or later it's popped open.
You really stepped in it, kid.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> All I know is, this is -- it's for me.<eos> I'm supposed to keep it.<eos> Good luck.<eos> But you don't know what it is?<eos> Open it.<eos> You know, we weren't sure at first which monkeys were gonna make it.<eos> No offense, but I was backing the Neanderthals because their poetry was...just amazing.<eos> It's in perfect tune with the spheres.
So this is a nice couch.<eos> And also, I've been practicing my baby voice.<eos> "That won't fit, mister!"<eos> Not really for us.<eos> We really try to stay away from the pedo thing.<eos> You do really sound like a baby, though, so congrats on that.<eos> May I?<eos> The stripper pole?<eos> Sure, go for a spin.<eos> Has it been used today?
Hey, who's ready to put some of my famous bean dip in their mouths while watching the first cut of our phone sex commercial?<eos> I am!<eos> lam!<eos> Ooh-ooh! Hey, is Lauren back yet?<eos> From her power play interview?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> I have to say, I think what you guys are doing is so weird and Single White Female-y, but then again, I'm stroking Zelda like I'm a Bond villain.<eos> So, who am I to talk about weird?<eos> Did you get the DVD?<eos> Yes, it's already in the player.
What else have you got? Nothing.<eos> It stinks.<eos> Stink of shit.<eos> Scratch all your skin off, until you are only a heap of blood and bones.<eos> I don't care any more.<eos> You won't find a better one<eos> The drum called us to battle<eos> He marched by my side With the same pace and stride<eos> A bullet came flying<eos> Was it meant for you or me?
Thank you.<eos> Now get the hell away from me and leave me alone.<eos> You want to be left alone?<eos> A blogger posted a story about you today... just a couple sentences, nothing major, but someone out there is going to follow up and want you to answer some questions.<eos> Do you know what you're going to say, exactly what you're going to say, to every question, every time someone calls?<eos> Because if you don't, there's gonna be more questions from more reporters.<eos> You're going to say or do the wrong thing. You'll get flustered.<eos> You'll get upset, and you'll say something that will bring out the dogs, and what started out as two sentences on a blog nobody reads is going to turn into a full-blown tabloid scandal, and the tabloids are gonna feel like a walk in the park<eos> once the networks pick up the story, and they will, because this story has a scent.<eos> It smells like papers sold. It smells like ratings.
I have an individual membership.<eos> - Zoidberg, get lost.<eos> - I am lost.<eos> So long.<eos> Stop the end-of-the-world sex.<eos> We might survive after all.<eos> All right, Amy, what's so important that you interrupted my embalming?<eos> I translated more Martian symbols.<eos> There's a way off this planet.<eos> That underground pyramid isn't a pyramid... it's a rocket ship!
Yes, the robot with the megaphone jumping up and down.<eos> I have a question for Senator c. Zaxxar Travers.<eos> Tell me, Zaxxar... Were you even born on earth?<eos> Because the earth constitution clearly states that only people born on earth can be president.<eos> Isn't that right, Justice Ruth Dader Ginsburg?<eos> You Ruth Bader believe it!<eos> But-but...<eos> I... Of course I was born on earth.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Then we voters demand you release your earth certificate so I can then claim it's a fake.
Aw, yeah.<eos> Second place!<eos> Release the giant sloth!<eos> Do something!<eos> Fear not, Leela. They may not have technology, like us, but we have something Technology.<eos> Behold our latest weapon, a revolutionary fleet of unmanned drones.<eos> With men in them.<eos> Then how are they unmanned?<eos> The men are just for ballast. I control all the drones from this single unit.<eos> Foolproof and durable, it's designed to withstand even the weight of a modern-day elephant foot.
Then how are we going to get in, by bending the bars of this exhaust grate?<eos> That's not a bad idea, Fry. Yeah, wh-what?<eos> We're looking for something that fits in here.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I should have paid more attention in kindergarten.<eos> What's this chair-looking gizmo?<eos> Welcome to Momcorp.<eos> Did you find everything you were burgling for?<eos> No. I came for a free will unit, and you're going to give it to me.<eos> If it exists.
I tried to look after him. Anna, you don't have to do this. You don't have to do what these people tell you to do.<eos> I'm not.<eos> It's just me.<eos> Can we have a couple of coffees, please?<eos> We're all sinners.<eos> We all need to make atonement for our own sins and for the sins of other people.<eos> There is so much that's wrong and we've moved away from the spiritual side of things entirely in this country.<eos> You can't force religion on people, Anna.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's not part of society.
There is an archive in the basement.<eos> It goes back to the KGB days. He used to say it was a record of every atrocity committed in Latvia.<eos> He used to tease me there was a file... about me.<eos> About you?<eos> I was in the freedom movement before the revolution.<eos> I was arrested a few times.<eos> If we ever used to have an argument, he would say,<eos> "It's all going in the file."<eos> It's there.<eos> It's in my file.
- What do you mean?<eos> It's Radio Rebel's first show on Slam FM.<eos> Do you realize how epic that is?<eos> I mean, she was popular before, but now it's like the whole world will be listening, including us.<eos> - I have plans.<eos> - What plans?<eos> - Family plans.<eos> - You are the worst liar.<eos> You sound just like you did when you said you liked that haircut I got at the mall.<eos> - It wasn't that bad.
Good job!<eos> - You people at Lincoln Bay High killed it with the red yesterday.<eos> I noticed one of you wearing these red specs that were the epitome of cool, but can we talk about what's not cool for a second.<eos> Now the school keeps confiscating our stuff.<eos> I mean, I've lost 2 sets of headphones and an mp3 player just this term alone.<eos> Although, I did notice that some of us seem to be exempt from this little... stuff snatching epidemic.<eos> Funny how that works, huh?<eos> Guys it's not just our playlists and players we're being deprived of you know?<eos> Music is the soundtrack to our lives.<eos> It's, it's where we've been and where we're going and everywhere in between.
A marvellous device invented by a thoroughly modern woman called Marie Stopes.<eos> Family planning.<eos> Oh! I could do with a maid.<eos> Though you'll probably want your old position back once this fuss has blown over and Mrs Andrews is back to her old self.<eos> No, not for all the tea in China.<eos> Even without Mr Andrews, there's still the electric iron to worry about.<eos> And the vacuum cleaner, and the new washing machine.<eos> - Don't they save you labour?<eos> - Yes, but at what cost, Miss? My priest says it's unnatural putting electricity through wires.<eos> Sooner or later, it'll come in contact with the molten centre of the earth and will blow up the whole world.
It's wood-burning and completely carbon-neutral.<eos> Old school.<eos> Like it. I wish I could, but I really should get back to the office.<eos> So I'll see you later?<eos> Hope so.<eos> Give her some time.<eos> We don't know what they went through in there.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Bunny therapy has been rigorously tested.<eos> It's proven beneficial in 64% of trauma cases.
Well, I'm not waiting to find out.<eos> Allie?<eos> Allie, what's happening?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm okay.<eos> It's on the move.<eos> I'm coming to get you.<eos> No, no, no, I'm fine.<eos> Just... I'll call Andy, he'll give me a ride to the smart house.<eos> You just need to stop this thing before it gets out of hand.
So, you comin' to the Double Cross for supper tonight?<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Atta boy.<eos> So, what do you think of Alice?<eos> She's pretty swell, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, no, she's... She's real swell.<eos> Yeah. Yeah.<eos> Alice Gordon?<eos> And from the sound of that, I would say that that is a peacemaker.<eos> Well, if you know this weapon then, uh, I'm guessing you have some understanding of the mischief it could cause with a man's features.
Stop doing that!<eos> Sorry, Jo came in.<eos> Henry needs us.<eos> You didn't tell her what we're doing, did you?<eos> No.<eos> And you have no idea what it's costing me.<eos> Come on.<eos> Henry got me security access, but I don't see the antenna tower.<eos> About five minutes away.<eos> It's 200 meters high with a big flashing light on it.
Well, we just need to stay one step ahead of the purge and Shaw.<eos> All right.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> I got to tell you, I sort of like bad Allison.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - All right. I'll go look for signs of Holly.<eos> Jo, we got to buy Holly some time.<eos> Jo, you mind telling me why you released Dr. Fargo?<eos> You have to stop the purge.<eos> It's affecting delicate systems.
I think he should really move on.<eos> Tingy!<eos> Tingy!<eos> Oh, my gosh, honey, you found your blanket!<eos> This is great, but how did it end up in the...<eos> - Garbage?<eos> - Frank?<eos> Yeah?<eos> You didn't.<eos> I didn't... know... that it meant that much to him anymore.
- So selfish!<eos> Listen, midgets, the only reason you're here is 'cause I was forced to invite you.<eos> So stay out of my eye-line!<eos> ¿ Comprende?<eos> She's into drama.<eos> She's like Rodrick in a dress!<eos> Is your brother's band all set up?<eos> I'm really looking forward to their performance.<eos> It was your grandmother's.<eos> So it's, like, used?
I put Toby in that hole so no one would kidnap him.<eos> - That's smart.<eos> - Parenting skills.<eos> I don't know, uh, if you've been working out... - ...your body's looking good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's these waves.<eos> It tightens everything up in the core.<eos> - Oh, nice, man.<eos> You see me fucking dominate that Wave, Powers?<eos> - Straight owning it, Shane.
I'm not trying to look like a bitch in front of Shane.<eos> He's my best friend. He's not someone I say things to.<eos> Ah, okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You know, Kenny, back in high school, I used to watch you walk through the halls.<eos> And I'd say, "There goes the coolest, cockiest kid in the world."<eos> But you're no longer a kid anymore, Kenny.<eos> You're a man.<eos> And I guess all that coolness and cockiness has, uh, transformed.<eos> But it's transformed into something far more powerful.
Is that horse yours too?<eos> - Yes, that's Earl.<eos> Chickens!<eos> Is he bad-tempered?<eos> - No, he's very sweet-natured.<eos> J.D. Crowe and The New South.<eos> Then the Tony Rice Unit.<eos> Manzanita is definitely my favourite CD ever.<eos> He used to have a fantastic voice.<eos> But he lost it.
Unless you believe in a God whose only reason for being Is the authorship of a relatively small book of rules About the weight and behavior of particles,<eos> Then we have to acknowledge That those rules could have been anything whatsoever.<eos> Now, what is the implication of what I just said? Yeah?<eos> It's almost like everything that happened<eos> Happened so we could know it happened.<eos> A-plus.<eos> And that idea is called the anthropic principle, That everything happened just so that we could know it happened,<eos> But there's a problem with the anthropic principle.<eos> Ashley... What could be wrong with this idea?<eos> It assumes we're the end.

But make yourself at home. Okay.<eos> Hello, Dr. Marten.<eos> Oh! You scared me.<eos> Hi, computer.<eos> What can I assist you with?<eos> That is a very good question.<eos> Actually, I do not know yet.<eos> I would be happy to present some research possibilities that conform to your areas of specialty.<eos> Also, you have one message in your inbox.<eos> Oh, well, play it.
Yeah, well that's what I thought.<eos> We're talking about Holly? Yes.<eos> She was printing a body blank in the neural networking lab.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But when I pressed her about it, she basically kicked me out of the lab.<eos> Okay, well, I'll see what I can find out.<eos> Major. I thought you weren't transferring the evidence till next week.<eos> No choice.<eos> You've got an out-of-control dust cloud floating around. It could damage the magnetic media even before it damages us.
I need to talk to you. It's important.<eos> Okay.<eos> While I was doing some research for Jo, I found something.<eos> What is that?<eos> Did the dust cause some kind of video malfunction?<eos> That's what I thought at first.<eos> But here it is again, slowed by a factor of 40.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> This message was buried in a DOC-TRAM file on my lab computer.<eos> It was addressed to Holly. Holly?
Well, I'll keep digging then.<eos> Maybe I can find a source code.<eos> Hey, Fargo.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Ooh, you smell, a lot.<eos> Yes. Methane Abatement lab.<eos> Smelly and a complete waste of time, thank you very much.<eos> So, update! The entire Eureka Smart Car system went down 10 minutes ago. As did our digital links to the outside world.<eos> Well, the good news is, the cloud is stabilizing.<eos> It's only affecting equipment so far. Oh!
It's someone's house.<eos> You know, half the time you can hear someone showering.<eos> I mean, you never see them, but you can hear the shower going.<eos> Really? That seems weird.<eos> Yeah, and is it normal that Miss Emily tied us all to the sink while she went out to return a birthday present?<eos> No, that's not normal at all.<eos> You know, Stewie, maybe I should come by tomorrow and check things out.<eos> That teacher sounds really irresponsible.<eos> She is. Adults are stupid.<eos> The world would be so much better if it were run by babies.
Peter, it's 4:00 in the morning.<eos> Come to bed!<eos> "Marital concerns continue to bedevil me."<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I wasn't planning on spending all night there.<eos> Look, how about if I take you to the park, huh?<eos> Come on.<eos> You like the park, right?<eos> We're about to pass the turnoff.<eos> Here it comes.
It's a party bus.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> Whoa, Jess, you really did all this for me?<eos> Okay, so... over here is kosher yogurt and honey.<eos> - Kosher yoge?<eos> - We got some condoms over here... small, medium, large,<eos> - whatever your preference. - Well, I would use...<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> And the R-rated section in the back with the stripper pole.<eos> It's normally used for stability, but tonight it's going to be used for $50 worth of seminudity.
- Oh, Cliff.<eos> Look what I found under a pile of depositions.<eos> I'm quitting!<eos> What?<eos> Nick convinced me that I can't waste my life doing your stapling any more.<eos> I never said anything like that, Julia.<eos> Not doing it any more.<eos> I'm not working all night on Valentine's Day.<eos> I'm just gonna get in my car, and I'm just gonna drive until I see the sun.<eos> 'Cause it's got to be shining somewhere.
- Yeah.<eos> - Right?<eos> You did all the work wrong, though.<eos> Yeah, I know I did.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> No, no, no, do what you got to do.<eos> Hi, Ming.<eos> Yeah, I got your text.<eos> And yeah, it was wrong just like every single other text you've sent me tonight.
Yes, yes!<eos> - Shit, Tony.<eos> Police.<eos> Whoa, Officer Markovich on the scene.<eos> Sorry about that, guys.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, wait, wait!<eos> You okay?<eos> How do you like my party so far?<eos> I'm kind of digging it, you know, it's got a certain energy.
She doesn't have any money.<eos> It was those evil Jesus witches!<eos> They took 'em. I know it!<eos> We should call the social worker, see if she can get the cops looking.<eos> If she shows up, call us right away.<eos> Perfect. I'm solo today, and we've got a full house for day care.<eos> I'll help you, honey.<eos> Can we talk about these gifts?<eos> You think I'm trying to buy their affection?<eos> Well, it's certainly for sale.
What's the problem if she's amenable?<eos> She said she'd do it?<eos> She said we couldn't afford it.<eos> She has a husband in Vietnam and a baby at home.<eos> And the work will be good enough to win on its own.<eos> - Plus, it's not a guarantee.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> It's a guarantee we won't get it if we don't.<eos> You have some nerve to even ask her.<eos> That's right. And you should be thanking me because we've come too far and are too close to turning this place into what it should be.
Yes, I do.<eos> I'm all right.<eos> And thank you.<eos> So you have a nice night.<eos> And I'm gonna go prepare.<eos> - Say good night to your friend. - Good luck tomorrow.<eos> You must get tired of hearing what a beautiful thing this car is.<eos> But I've met a lot of beautiful women in my life.<eos> And despite their protestations, they never tire of hearing it.<eos> But when deep beauty is encountered, it arouses deep emotions because it creates a desire, because it is, by nature, unattainable.
Didn't you hear about the sniper at the University of Texas today?<eos> Aren't you going to Ohio State?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Just two weeks after those nurses in Chicago--<eos> They don't want me out there by myself.<eos> Don't let them scare you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Things seem so random all of a sudden.<eos> And time feels like it's speeding up.<eos> It does, doesn't it?
Nothing, I just...<eos> - Honey, they don't want to talk about that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You know, if he wasn't a writer, we never would have met.<eos> - I didn't know that.<eos> - I work in publishing.<eos> My boss was rejecting him and I thought it was all he could handle.<eos> What was the story? - Forget it.<eos> - No, we want to know.<eos> It's called "The Punishment Of X4."
I'm really sorry about that. Please!<eos> This is a process.<eos> I just want to be a part of this place.<eos> I think it's on the way up.<eos> I got the job.<eos> You don't say...<eos> I can't stay that long...<eos> I have to go back and redo the Heinz speech.<eos> What?<eos> It's purple and silver.
Some things are possibly true.<eos> Some are necessarily true.<eos> Some used to be true.<eos> Some will be true.<eos> Some are true on this planet, but not necessarily others.<eos> So there's no good and bad because the truth is relative?<eos> Even if the truth is what you would call relative, good and bad are not relative.<eos> Your mistake is that you're assuming That because something is true that it's good.<eos> Professor's got you there.<eos> I think the truth is good because it's always real on any planet.
I just know for a fact that you did not fall in love.<eos> So what was wrong again?<eos> You don't like me.<eos> I did.<eos> I really did.<eos> - Is it morning?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry I always say it, but you are so beautiful.<eos> Last night was beautiful.<eos> It was, wasn't it?
No, that's not what that is.<eos> Well... Goodnight.<eos> They'll be gone on Sunday.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Lock that and get Dawn to hold my calls so you can have five.<eos> No, pervert.<eos> This is about work.<eos> I think it is, anyway.<eos> I think I have an idea.<eos> It might be really good.
Well... Goodnight.<eos> They'll be gone on Sunday.<eos> Do you have a minute?<eos> Lock that and get Dawn to hold my calls so you can have five.<eos> No, pervert.<eos> This is about work.<eos> I think it is, anyway.<eos> I think I have an idea.<eos> It might be really good.<eos> But it might be terrible.
I can't talk to you there and I don't want to wait.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I could meet you early if I come back.<eos> 6:00?<eos> 7:00. I'll see you there.<eos> She couldn't have been struck by lightning a week ago?<eos> You think that's her idea?<eos> What happened?<eos> Boss's wife had an idea.<eos> - Is it any good?
Well, it's been my experience that when a man insists on a meal, he has something important to say.<eos> It's usually a proposal.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, that's you.<eos> Men don't take the time to end things.<eos> They ignore you until you insist on a declaration of hate.<eos> Someone dumped you?<eos> Peggy, I'm just like everybody else.<eos> If he's going to end it, which I doubt, you'll know what to do.<eos> If he's going to propose, you'd better have your answer prepared, especially if it's no.
Congratulations!<eos> There's a point when you go from going home on the 5:25 to the 7:05.<eos> I didn't want to play cards anyway.<eos> I was supposed to talk to Dunphy, but he's sick again.<eos> You know, the other top salesman in my department, he reads all day long and I'm out here on the train hustling people.<eos> I'm really having a lean month.<eos> Okay, Howard, I knew this day would come.<eos> Look, I already have life insurance.<eos> It came with my junior partnership.<eos> And it's six times my annual salary, and after two years, it covers suicide.
Uh, let me see.<eos> Okay, got it.<eos> This is a photo of the buildings that are there now, and these are the buildings that Cobb could see in 1963.<eos> How's Lucy?<eos> She's stable.<eos> But the doctors say there's no telling the extent of the damage.<eos> What do you got?<eos> This is what Cobb saw from his cell every day.<eos> He even made a scope and studied the view.<eos> Just imagined it over and over.
I don't know if you even know how to love<eos> Bethesda..<eos> I don't want you to leave<eos> Then give me a reason to stay<eos> You really want to know what I do?<eos> Yes<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes<eos> You won't be needing that.<eos> The story, is it worth it?
Okay, can we go?<eos> - What you got?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Where did you know the owner from?<eos> What do you care?<eos> I'm done.<eos> Can you ask the boy to come here?<eos> Can you come over here, for five minutes?<eos> There was a watch in the bathroom.<eos> It's no longer there.
We can't think like that!<eos> The Chancellor's concerns must be ours!<eos> I understand.<eos> Now hurry up!<eos> Ji Ben, are you bothered that I'm doing your job?<eos> Chancellor, I'm shocked that you'd ask.<eos> Your hands are much more sensitive than mine thanks to your condition, so I'm more than willing to leave this to you.<eos> To see an old affliction become a cure, and your tender care for her, how can I not be moved?<eos> Ji Ben, let me see your tongue.<eos> It's swollen with nonsense.
Somewhere over here.<eos> I know it. Where are you, camera?<eos> I know you're here somewhere.<eos> There you go.<eos> Oh, come on, man.<eos> Oh, you have got to be kidding me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Look at my camera.<eos> Now don't ignore me.<eos> It's broken, and it's my last ND.6 filter.
Can you make it from here?<eos> It's the Morcegos, isn't it?<eos> Are they out here?<eos> According to Emmet's journal, some native tribes used the dried seeds of Cegos trees on blowdarts to blind animals so that they're easier to hunt.<eos> So how do we cure it?<eos> Emmet always said that everything in the Amazon has a counter.<eos> For every yin, there's a yang, and it's how the jungle maintains harmony.<eos> So it says here that there's this plant.<eos> It's a bulb.<eos> It grows under the Sentido tree.
Smart.<eos> More than I can say for this lot.<eos> Get these prisoners to work.<eos> Bring the girl.<eos> I need a new cupbearer.<eos> My lord.<eos> Your visits are too few, cousin.<eos> Her Grace, the Queen Regent, commands you to release Grand Maester Pycelle.<eos> -Here's your warrant.<eos> -So it is.
Does it?<eos> He has neither crown nor gold nor favor with the gods.<eos> He has a sword, the power of life and death.<eos> But if it's swordsmen who rule, why do we pretend kings hold all the power?<eos> When Ned Stark lost his head, who was truly responsible?<eos> Joffrey?<eos> The executioner?<eos> Or something else?<eos> I've decided I don't like riddles.<eos> Power resides where men believe it resides.
So then, all those hours of training, all those sacrifices, for what?<eos> So you can destroy everything you always dreamed of?<eos> Susan Hunter... maintains her world record of 512 strokes a minute!<eos> Rose Pamphyle, with 506 strokes a minute!<eos> It's incredible!<eos> We'll never let you near her, you two bit insurer.<eos> You can't give up.<eos> Not now.<eos> What do you intend to do, with this old machine?<eos> It'll slow you down even more.
Looks like someone forgot a "d" at the end of that word.<eos> Guess we just answered who is in Blair's heart. Question is, is there room for two?<eos> Dan?<eos> Hello, it's me! Do you want to come with me to the Shepherds' divorce party tonight?<eos> I should've known that marriage was doomed when Serena banged my boyfriend at the reception.<eos> You saw "Gossip Girl." You wanna reimburse me for my new phone?<eos> 'Cause I'm assuming it's you who took the old one.<eos> I swear, it was just a fleeting thought that I jotted down the day before our hotel room incident.<eos> And drunk elevator sex changed all that.<eos> I would have edited it out of my biography had it not already been posted for posterity.
Well, that was definitely not what I expected to happen tonight.<eos> Not that it... it was bad.<eos> It wasn't.<eos> Oh, don't sound so surprised.<eos> We were always good together.<eos> Yeah, we were, weren't we?<eos> Here.<eos> That's weird.<eos> Your camera's on.<eos> Uh, no, no, it's not.

NOAH:<eos> Whew.<eos> I'm not doing underwear.<eos> That's fine, right?<eos> [NOAH EXHALES SHARPLY]<eos> Close the door.<eos> Marty, I was in the process of closing it as you're telling me to.<eos> If you'd waited half a second the door would have already been closed.<eos> See? There. Look.<eos> - It's closed, Marty.
He's tried to address every single one of their concerns.<eos> He hired Mr. Folkin, an accredited wood inspector. Found absolutely no fault with the lumber and stamped it as such on 30 June.<eos> He enlisted Jeff LeBlanc, a certified engineer, to redraw the joists and truss specs.<eos> And Mr. Morrison's already added the reinforcements to comply with the Commission's recommendations.<eos> These are the photos of those improvements.<eos> Additionally, Mr. Raymond Debley - you'll recognize that name, Mr. Daigle - one of the most successful and respected builders in New Brunswick inspected the house on 10 July and those are his findings.<eos> As you'll read, it's quite a glowing report of Mr. Morrison's construction.<eos> Is that all, Mr. Fulton?<eos> Yeah...<eos> Except, sorry, uh... You know, it's worth remembering that the National Building code is not a set of rules, it's a set of standards.
Look.<eos> It's Qhorin Half hand.<eos> Aye, we'll live another day.<eos> Hurrah.<eos> Take care, my lord.<eos> I remember reading an old sailors' proverb,<eos> "Piss on wildfire and your cock burns off."<eos> Oh, I have not conducted this experiment.<eos> It could well be true.<eos> The substance burns so hot, it melts wood, stone, even steel, and, of course, flesh.

It's how you gotta be.<eos> You can't care about anyone or anything.<eos> Moment they see a soft spot, they got you by the short hairs.<eos> You want to be my protege, it's lesson number one.<eos> Well, I've learned it, Mr. Sweeney.<eos> Committed it to memory.<eos> Fake a bellyache, Sweeney.<eos> Your cell's being tossed.<eos> Tiller?<eos> Where is it?

20%...<eos> I get my box back. 50.<eos> 30.<eos> 50.<eos> And you should be overjoyed I'm letting you keep anything at all.<eos> You can always crown another rat to take over your operation.<eos> 50%.<eos> Now give me my box.<eos> I told you, I don't have it.<eos> Where is it?
That wasn't your voice, Dr. Gilmore?<eos> I was obeying that voice to join a war to help humanity start over.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Are you really Joe Shimamura?<eos> In the initial stages of the plan, the Defense Department was sympathetic to Samuel Capital's goals and worked in secret to start an unmanned war within America by manufacturing an unseen enemy.<eos> But ever since the bombings in America, our plan has been growing beyond its original scope.<eos> Still, the government has been giving their tacit approval because they've benefited from it.<eos> However, now this "His Voice" thing is starting to affect our own soldiers.<eos> What the hell is His Voice?<eos> Is it part of Samuel Capital's scheme, too?
If it's a good home you're looking for, it's not with me.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey, it's me.<eos> I need you to come outside right away.<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Don't say anything in front of the kids, but no, it's not.<eos> He doesn't want the kids.<eos> And you don't want to tell them?<eos> I can't, because all I'll be telling them is that the false hope I gave them is exactly that.<eos> The truth can be painful, Emma, but it can also be cathartic.
- And are all your dresses pink? - I do have another, in eau de nil.<eos> I bet you look a picture in that too. Nurse Lee!<eos> Uniforms.<eos> Standard pale blue. Two. - I found some in the airing cupboard.<eos> That's what we used to say at school.<eos> I could never bear all that fussing and flapping under dressing capes.<eos> I've always been a longshanks.<eos> Even as a child in India, I was always taller than my brothers.<eos> Poor old Mater, she used to be in tears, but my ayah just sewed flounces at the bottom of my frocks.<eos> It would look a bit rum round the hem of a nurse's outfit.
I think it was stupid.<eos> I disagree. It wasn't stupid.<eos> It was an impassioned choice, a sacrifice.<eos> My father always told me there is nothing worth laying your life down for.<eos> I disagree.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about!<eos> What is life without freedom?<eos> You're still alive.<eos> Is freedom worth dying for?<eos> No, it is not!
Now cut me loose, chief, will you?<eos> Who was your meeting with, Mr. Green?<eos> I had no meeting.<eos> My meeting's with you.<eos> It's our understanding you were scheduled to meet with a member of the press, unfriendly to our cause.<eos> Yeah, your cause...<eos> That's what you call it?<eos> It is my duty to protect my country, Mr. Green.<eos> Okay, let me tell you something about your understanding.<eos> It's based on a misunderstanding because I didn't meet with any reporter.
And he is only a pretender.<eos> Your brother's turn will come.<eos> Then you can lick his blood off Hearteater, too.<eos> Some of those boys will never come back.<eos> Joffrey will.<eos> The worst ones always live. Shh.<eos> Come, My Lady.<eos> - Where's our fleet?<eos> - On the way.<eos> Why isn't it here now?
- I will help you, Khaleesi.<eos> - How?<eos> I will take you to the House of the Undying where I have put them.<eos> You have my dragons?<eos> When I learned you were coming to our city, I made an arrangement with the King of Qarth.<eos> He procured them for me.<eos> - But there is no King of Qarth.<eos> - There is now.<eos> That was the other half of the arrangement.<eos> You would keep your gates and your minds closed to everything outside your walls, but Qarth cannot remain the greatest city that ever was if it refuses to change.
And it's like they have this... their lips are, like, in the TV.<eos> Jack and Grady's lips are in the TV.<eos> And these masks are formed by the windows.<eos> And ifs like Danny's envisioning this. Danny's envisioning... you know, envisioning the pact between Grady and jack.<eos> Like, he goes into... he sneaks into the bedroom, like, right through Jack's head, right in between them.<eos> And just like that scene is... that's the scene where Danny is testing his father, like, "Do you really, you know!"...<eos> "Do you like this place? You're not gonna hurt us, are you?"<eos> Like, Danny kind of knows that his dad has lost it.<eos> The last shot is 1921, and the first shot is of the road.<eos> Ullman mentions that it was finished in 1921.
Walther .32.<eos> We ran the serial number, registered to the judge.<eos> He purchased it in 1995, had a license to carry it.<eos> We find any casings?<eos> One.<eos> Under the chair.<eos> Well, at least he got off one shot.<eos> You find the bullet?<eos> Nothing in the walls or the ceiling.<eos> Windows are intact, so unless it went out the door...
- Professional.<eos> Could've been done by any engraver, anytime, anywhere.<eos> Oh, this is tragic.<eos> What?<eos> Some jerk put glue in the movement.<eos> This watch is destroyed.<eos> I wanna weep.<eos> - Why would somebody do that?<eos> - To stop it from working.<eos> Maybe they wanted to stop it on a specific time and date.
Or the judge.<eos> What about Mary, the name on the watch?<eos> Maybe march 11th connects all three of them together somehow.<eos> Maybe all four of them, killer included.<eos> But march 11th of what year?<eos> Maybe we're looking at some kind of zodiac killer here.<eos> Hey, I got something, actually.<eos> Turns out the watch was first purchased in 1933 by a Steven Armstrong...<eos> He gave it to his wife as a wedding present. She... 1933?<eos> Who owns it now?

That's the lighthouse and the ocean.<eos> I was looking at this picture...<eos> Looking at it for a while last night.<eos> For a long while.<eos> And found myself staring at this barn.<eos> The Wood's chipping away and the paint's flaking off there.<eos> Probably from all the salt water in the air.<eos> But it reminded me of my grandfather's barn.<eos> That barn was the bane of my existence.<eos> It was immaculate.
Yeah.<eos> Honey, I don't understand.<eos> Me sinto quente.<eos> What's he saying?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I tried to learn when we got married, but I just--<eos> it's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> His body temperature is rising.<eos> It's above normal.

Gimme that.<eos> As he did so, the Grand Chef?<eos> Thousand leaves, chocolate, vanilla and candy... Ganache and bitter orange.<eos> And you liked it?<eos> Hmm ..<eos> And you?<eos> I do not know, I think...<eos> Associate vanilla with bitter orange does not work.<eos> Not work because... When chewing a vanilla bean is already rough...<eos> It would also be bitter.
The main house is surrounded by a 3.50-meter-thick wall .<eos> Two approaches, both of which are guarded.<eos> No phone lines, no internet.<eos> The waste is incinerated.<eos> The children are taught at home.<eos> How many children?<eos> 13, may 14th<eos> This is a goddamn madrasa.<eos> There are at least seven armed adult men in the complex.<eos> The roof of the main building looks as if it as a platform could be used for air defense devices of all kinds.
- Get him inside.<eos> - No, no!<eos> It's thinner rations.<eos> You'd be wise to conserve your strength. No!<eos> No!<eos> This conversation's four matches long, son.<eos> Phillumeny.<eos> Word describes the collecting of match-related items such as matchbox labels and matchboxes.<eos> This matchbox is a Swedish safety match from the Jonkoping match factory.<eos> It was manufactured in 1858.
- It's gonna be perfect, Frank.<eos> - I'm glad you like them.<eos> - I love them.<eos> - Why did you want them to be faceless?<eos> Oh, I have a little idea for the show.<eos> You'll see.<eos> Okay, I'm starving. Are you hungry?<eos> You wanna grab some lunch with me?<eos> It's my third exhibition since I've graduated from art center. But it's my first with this gallery.<eos> If it's successful they'll give me a show in their other galleries in New York.
It looks something like a bite mark.<eos> Literally sucking the victim dry.<eos> Are we looking at a revenge killing?<eos> - Victim's never been married, so we ruled out ex-wives.<eos> Current girlfriend's alibi checks out.<eos> Could be an ex.<eos> He was a bit of a player.<eos> And the only thing missing was his Rolex.<eos> We got the serial number from the insurance company.<eos> - Put it on a hotlist.
And... I also got your dad something very nice.<eos> Something he's really gonna like.<eos> What is it?<eos> This is amazing.<eos> Thank you, honey.<eos> Ew, you guys are gross. I have homework.<eos> - Take your dishes. - I know.<eos> I like your watch, dad.<eos> This is too nice to wear everyday.<eos> It's for special occasions.
We just got a hit on the Rolex watch.<eos> - Where?<eos> - Washington middle school.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Principal just called.<eos> He's one of our seventh graders.<eos> Took it home and showed it to his mother.<eos> She asked him where he got it, and he said he traded it for his Mountain bike.<eos> She was very upset, called the school, brought it down here, and as soon as I looked at it, I realized it was a very expensive watch.<eos> I wanted to make sure it wasn't stolen, so I called the police before I did anything else, and here you are.
Me, too, but... We're going to have to.<eos> We're just going to have to forget each other.<eos> So... you're the one.<eos> I don't know what you're-- enough.<eos> I know everything.<eos> You poisoned his heart, now his marriage.<eos> And with that, the entire kingdom, all because of your feelings.<eos> I wish feelings could be helped, but they can't.<eos> Of course they can.<eos> Love is a disease, and like all diseases, it can be vanquished in one of two ways-- a cure or death.
You got yourself an ally.<eos> We won't get fooled again.<eos> It is done.<eos> You are free, my love.<eos> We are free to be together at last.<eos> D-did you not hear me?<eos> Our days of imprisonment are over.<eos> You haven't heard the news.<eos> The palace guards found the snake.<eos> They know it's from your country.
Sounds like a complicated life.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I just couldn't decide.<eos> These are both for the same woman?<eos> Well, they're both so "us."<eos> I see.<eos> Well, you're fortunate you have someone that loves you.<eos> I really am.<eos> Love, it's like a delicate flame.<eos> And once it's gone, it's gone forever.
You could've had happiness if you just believed that someone could want you.<eos> But you couldn't take the chance.<eos> That's a lie.<eos> You are a coward, Rumplestiltskin.<eos> And no matter how thick you make your skin, that doesn't change.<eos> I'm not a coward, dearie.<eos> It's quite simple, really.<eos> My power means more to me than you.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You can't give up so easily.<eos> Have you ever been in love?<eos> Yes.<eos> Once.<eos> Then you're lucky.<eos> Because what I'm coming to understand is that I haven't.<eos> What they have is real.<eos> It's true.<eos> My marriage to David, it just was like an illusion.<eos> I don't know how it happened, but it was never real.
It's in his heart.<eos> You're in love.<eos> Oh, that's impossible.<eos> Dwarves can't fall in love.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know love, and... - You're in it. - Ah.<eos> What's it like?<eos> It's the most wonderful and amazing thing in the world.<eos> Love is hope.<eos> It fuels our dreams.
Proud of you.<eos> What was that?<eos> You heard me.<eos> David, it's going to be okay.<eos> Really?<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I honestly can't say anything about my actions any more.<eos> There has to be an explanation.<eos> You're right.<eos> But the problem is, I don't think it's a good one.
How? Did you read about it, perchance, in a book?<eos> How is that any less real than any other book?<eos> History books are based on history.<eos> And story books are based on what?<eos> Imagination? Where does that come from?<eos> It has to come from somewhere.<eos> You know what the issue is with this world?<eos> Everyone wants a magical solution for their problem, and everyone refuses to believe in magic.<eos> Now get it to work.<eos> Here's the thing, Jefferson. This is it.
She believes that.<eos> Daniel,<eos> I know better.<eos> Regina, tell her.<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> What can she do? Have you not seen her magic?<eos> The real question is, "What can't she do?"<eos> Who cares about magic?<eos> True love is the most powerful magic of all.<eos> It can overcome anything.
I need you to be certain.<eos> You can never speak of this.<eos> And above all, you mustn't tell my mother.<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I promise.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Grasping at straws.<eos> Still trying to find a way to prove your friend has been framed?<eos> Every time I go down a path I think leads somewhere, it ends up being a dead end.
The eagle is in the nest. And the package is secure.<eos> Henry, I left the code book at home.<eos> She's getting in the shower and the keys are under the mat.<eos> Don't touch a thing.<eos> Hey.<eos> We got her.<eos> Careful, sweetheart.<eos> A flower is a delicate thing.<eos> Be gentle.<eos> You want it to grow and not pluck it before its time.
Why should I?<eos> How do I know you're not lying about this?<eos> About everything?<eos> I'm not a liar.<eos> That is exactly what a liar would say.<eos> Having a bad day?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to see you while I can.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Simply that the trial starts tomorrow, and it won't be a long one.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Mother, why have you done this?<eos> Because this is your happy ending.<eos> What?<eos> You have to trust me, Regina.<eos> I know best.<eos> Love is weakness, Regina.<eos> It feels real now.
Mother, why have you done this?<eos> Because this is your happy ending.<eos> What?<eos> You have to trust me, Regina.<eos> I know best.<eos> Love is weakness, Regina.<eos> It feels real now.<eos> At the start, it always does.<eos> But it's an illusion.<eos> It fades. And then you're left with nothing.
However, I'm not marrying Daniel.<eos> This dress is for your father.<eos> But I thought you were in love.<eos> So did I.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> Daniel has run away.<eos> What I had with Daniel wasn't real.<eos> It was an infatuation.<eos> See, that's the thing about love.<eos> It can come in the most unexpected places.
Ah!<eos> Careful, this is all I have left of it.<eos> What do you know of true love?<eos> Well, not so much as you, perhaps, but not so little as you might think.<eos> You?<eos> You loved someone?<eos> It was a brief flicker of light amidst an ocean of darkness.<eos> What happened?<eos> She died.<eos> That's the thing about true love, dearie, it can slip through your fingers.

The only magic powerful enough to break any curse.<eos> It must be protected at all costs.
Return my ring to me.<eos> Of course, you're in a bit of a rush.<eos> How rude of me.<eos> With this, Prince Charming, you will find her.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Something's missing.<eos> Now you're ready for your big moment.<eos> Why do you want us together?<eos> What do you get out of it?<eos> I'm a fan of true love, dearie. And more importantly, what it creates.
Uh, made a deal with Fiona.<eos> She'll blow her end, and I'll be back home chilling in a week.<eos> I'm gonna give the baby up for adoption.<eos> Sometimes I wonder if getting high makes it easier for me to keep up with you or more difficult.<eos> I thought I was in love with Jody;<eos> I'm not. I thought it would be cool to have a baby and love it, but no, I suck at it.<eos> I thought about aborting it, but I'm this far along, and even though I don't want it, other people probably do.<eos> So I figure why not suck it up a few more months, vag it out and sell it?<eos> "Vag it out"?<eos> Well, the truth hurts, but it's still the truth.
All right, listen. That is bullshit.<eos> I can't... I can't hear anything.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Hello, this is Lucas.<eos> Why do you never call me?<eos> Sorry... what?<eos> Why do you never call me?<eos> Because I don't have your number.<eos> Look on your phone. It is on your display, right?<eos> Yes, it is.
- Yeah.<eos> But at Briarcliff, I hear you are the true star.<eos> Oh, no. Not me.<eos> The monsignor, Timothy Howard.<eos> He's the real visionary.<eos> Sit down. You're making me nervous.<eos> You know what this place was just two years ago?<eos> - A hellhole.<eos> - And I'm told the bakery was your idea.<eos> It was, but it was based on his philosophy.

I demand you give me access to your laboratory.<eos> When the monsignor brought me out of retirement to run Briarcliff's medical unit, we made a gentleman's agreement.<eos> Curious, since only one of you is a gentleman.<eos> Please look at me when I speak to you.<eos> I'm not one of your charges, Sister, quaking in my boots.<eos> Do you have any idea what this is?<eos> It's a plant.<eos> A little Elena.<eos> This particular strain of Alstroemeria has never existed before.<eos> It was created by bombarding the plant with gamma rays.
Your gun.<eos> I thought you always kept that thing loaded.<eos> Not always.<eos> You never cease to amaze and... Terrify me, maestro.<eos> I'm so sorry, ash.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Wow, that was fun.<eos> Well, we sure know how to pick 'em, hmm?<eos> Duress impacts relationships in one of two ways.<eos> It either tears people apart... binding them tightly in a common objective.
- How was school?<eos> - Hmmm... normal.<eos> Madam... it seems your kids have developed a bond, one tighter than usual in siblings of that age.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It might be best if they go to different schools, have different activities, do things separately.<eos> Excessive dependence on one another can be harmful to certain processes that occur at that age.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I was-- I'm looking for Sarita's blanket.<eos> She was cold last night.<eos> Do you know where it is?
She's in more danger than you know, Chuck.<eos> It's over.<eos> I win.<eos> General, what have we got here?<eos> There is a bomb under my chair.<eos> I can't stand up.<eos> Morgan, get the Chinese delegation out of here. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - Mom, pull up the blueprints to the hall; we need to evacuate.<eos> Wait, guys, it looks like a sonic trigger, probably tied to the performance.<eos> When the music stops, it goes. Exactly.

Exactly.<eos> Get everybody out of here.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> We disrupt the performance, it'll blow up.
Well, get me more time, Casey, okay?<eos> I need Quinn to stop this bomb and I need those glasses for Sarah.<eos> Go, go.<eos> I'm ready for extraction.<eos> - We're on our way, sir.<eos> - Three minutes.<eos> Morgan.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We gotta keep the music going.<eos> We can't let it stop.
I got a plan.<eos> You're not going to like it, but I got a plan.<eos> Quinn!<eos> Sarah!<eos> W-W-W-Wait, wait.<eos> Don't kill him.<eos> We need him to disarm the bomb.<eos> The bomb?<eos> It can't be stopped.<eos> And it's wired to explode when the music ends.
Walker.<eos> Colonel.<eos> So, Irene Demova...<eos> I, um... I'm not really sure what it meant.<eos> Or maybe it's a fresh start, a new beginning.<eos> I need some time to think.<eos> To be alone.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know, Morgan had this idea.<eos> It's nutty, really.
Sometimes you're funny, Gallagher.<eos> Hell, who am I kidding?<eos> Don't you want to die knowing someone loved you.<eos> You don't love me.<eos> You're kind of growing on me.<eos> What is this about, Frank?<eos> You trying to get my pension?<eos> You have a pension?<eos> I told you.<eos> And I may be dead way before I can collect it.
Do you wanna stay here?<eos> - It's where the heart is.<eos> - Left side.<eos> My advice:<eos> No one trades an MVP.<eos> Make myself valuable. Untradeable.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know what?<eos> The world out there is a scary place.<eos> Maybe it needs to get even scarier.
- The object is to be scared, not scarred.<eos> Maybe Lip and Ian have something.<eos> You are not gonna be happy.<eos> We gotta work tomorrow night.<eos> - I can't.<eos> Deb's party's tomorrow night.<eos> - Ivan rented the place for a party.<eos> You're the one who made me have this stupid party.<eos> If you flake it's gonna suck.<eos> - No, it won't.

Yeah. -You know the rules.<eos> Be good.<eos> -Hey, lily.<eos> -l love you, too.<eos> Same goes for you, too. I own a gun.<eos> -l promise.<eos> -You own a gun?<eos> -That's right. lt's a shotgun.<eos> -Where's the gun?<eos> Where is it?
That's good.<eos> You need that.<eos> And special fork.<eos> You know, we have forks here, Robbie.<eos> Careful.<eos> is this 1 00 years old, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is a very expensive fork, too.<eos> What does it do that's so special?<eos> It tells the future.
It wasn't a blind feel.<eos> I knew what I was doing.<eos> I traced it with my fingers.<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - It was the posterior segmental artery.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> You never got a visual.<eos> I-I followed the tracheal bifurcation.<eos> It came directly off the main pulmonary artery.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
FINCH: November 2002.<eos> This isn't the first item chronologically, but it's the one that triggered a harder look. INGRAM:<eos> A gas station receipt? FINCH: Eighteen of them.<eos> From a Shell station just outside Towson, Maryland.<eos> Kurzweil stopped there every third Thursday of every even month, even if he'd filled up the day before.<eos> On three of his 18 visits, this SUV was present two hours before.<eos> - A dead-drop.<eos> - The SUV was registered to the wife of a Turkish oil executive that paid for plane tickets used by an Iranian suspect in the bombing of a Jewish community center in Buenos Aires in 1994.<eos> The thinnest thread connects Kurzweil and his contact and the machine could see it.<eos> It knew. And it was right.

Which has been wonderful.<eos> But I never really imagined that I would get a place with somebody until I was married.<eos> My parents were actually... Pretty traditional.<eos> And keeping those traditions alive, I... I feel like I'm honouring them in a small way.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> But don't get me wrong.<eos> Of course, one doesn't often consider the role of inspiration in the work of nonfiction writing.<eos> In my admittedly biased opinion, that is an oversight.<eos> It is very much a factor of my work.

A child?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I was just trying to kill a little time.<eos> Where is she?<eos> She's on the right.<eos> How you do that?<eos> The hype.<eos> You pick up two cards between your fingers like so, but when you throw down, it appears that you throw the bottom card, when in fact, you throw the top card.<eos> Like that.<eos> See how that looked like it was the bottom card?
She never cried.<eos> My sister would have let him rip her to pieces before she would let him believe he could make her shed a tear.<eos> This was not idle gossip.<eos> This was the mayor of Cloisterham talking.<eos> Don't try to make me laugh, I'm not in the mood.<eos> The difference between us is that I believe the two men were equally at fault. And I do not. But why not, Ma?<eos> Because I don't.<eos> Though, of course, I am open to discussion. That's exactly what you're not.<eos> I had planned to suggest to you that we jointly hush the whole thing up to save the reputations of all concerned.<eos> Now you've discussed it with the mayor, which is to say the entire town...
I need to find my brother and mother.<eos> And my sister.<eos> I need to find her, too.<eos> Then we must part.<eos> A man has duties as well.<eos> - Here.<eos> - What is it?<eos> A coin of great value.<eos> Could it buy a horse?<eos> It is not meant for the buying of horses.

You are the moon of my life.<eos> That is all I know and all I need to know.<eos> And if this is a dream I will kill the man who tries to wake me.<eos> Until the sun rises in the west and sets in the east, until the rivers run dry and the mountains blow in the wind like leaves.<eos> They miss their mother.<eos> They want to be with you.<eos> Do you want to be with them?<eos> You will be.<eos> When your dragons were born, our magic was born again.<eos> It is strongest in their presence.
Do you agree?<eos> Master Fan!<eos> Xialu , you're running too?<eos> is the entire village leaving?<eos> Everyone.<eos> Let's go together.<eos> We'll look after each other.<eos> Let's go.<eos> We can take care of each other. Let's go.<eos> The drought can't be that bad if it's making the Fan's poor too.
Kill it.<eos> Cook it.<eos> Stop, stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> The crackers and the donkey are yours.<eos> You can't eat the camera.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> OK<eos> Shuanzhu, stop.<eos> Give it to him .
There are rumours Hitler's been making overtures to the Russians.<eos> That's why they were weakened last time, because they were fighting on two fronts, the Eastern and the Western.<eos> It's possible. So the other representative's a lady's maid? Full of airs and graces, no doubt.<eos> They always think they're better than the rest of us.<eos> What's Lady Malcolm like?<eos> She strikes me as a woman of indomitable spirit.<eos> Battle-axe. Oh, she didn't inherit her mother's looks, that's for sure.<eos> Lillie Langtry was such a beauty. You'll be pleased to hear that they've secured the services of Percy Chandler and his dance orchestra.<eos> Don't worry, I'll teach you some steps. And I'll be needing to look at your tunic later, Johnny.<eos> Whoever wore it at the Dramatic Society was a bit more Friar Tuck than Robin Hood.
Why don't they just murder the entire population?<eos> Then you wouldn't hear a squeak out of any of them!<eos> Is there any way to shut him up?<eos> If I knew how to control him, he wouldn't be here in the first place.<eos> Are you interested in Irish politics, Lord Merton?<eos> Well, I was only just saying that I thought...<eos> He's interested in Irish repression!<eos> Like all of you!<eos> Look, old chap. Of course this stuff matters a great deal to you...<eos> Yes, it does matter, this stuff.
I'm very grateful to you for keeping Mr Branson up to the mark.<eos> We both are, aren't we?<eos> We certainly are.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> This is a proud day, Mrs Hughes.<eos> I don't know if I'm proud, but I'm very glad you're happy, Mr Carson.<eos> - You're next, darling. You'll see.<eos> - Will I?<eos> It's so encouraging to see the future unfurl.<eos> As long as you remember it will bear no resemblance to the past.
"This is the way the world ends.<eos> This is the way the world ends"...<eos> "Not with a bang"...<eos> "Not with a bang"...<eos> Bella will not be parted from her work in progress under any circumstances.<eos> Well, there are certain things that one must hold on to.<eos> But don't you think occasionally there's an argument for letting go, dear?<eos> Don't be fooled by such phony modernity, Ginger.<eos> Letting go. Please.<eos> But surely even a poetess... should be able to relax enough to enjoy her soup... especially if it's been made by Mark.
It's always before midnight and it's always after midnight.<eos> ***.<eos> It's 24 hours.<eos> Parking of vehicles only authorized or you can't park it?<eos> A dog or a carrot?<eos> Or is it like "Parking the vehicles only authorised".<eos> Vehicles...<eos> And then this is a green thing...<eos> But you can't tell...<eos> And it's...the line is straight across, it's not even..
Yeah, just like you said.<eos> This way.<eos> How about the boat?<eos> Ready to go.<eos> Now, look, we need you all to just calm down.<eos> See, we-we-we all want the same thing.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> We want those damn things dead.<eos> And you want to-- to make the town safe.<eos> You swore up and down it was safe. But now we hear there's 1 of them 40 foot long.
A lot of people think you can't assign a number grade to something as subjective as a poem...<eos> - ...but you can. - Huh.<eos> Don't be so hard on yourself.<eos> We can't all be Dalia Royce right out of the gate.<eos> I have been teaching poetry for two and a quarter years now and I have never seen anyone quite like her before.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She's unique.<eos> She's able to make small revelations seem complex.<eos> Her voice has a sort of detached opacity.<eos> Oh, is that what it has?
I will redeem all this on Percy's head and, in the closing of some glorious day, be bold to tell you that I am your son.<eos> And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights, that this same child of honour and renown, this gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight, and your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.<eos> Then will I make this northern youth exchange his glorious deeds for my indignities.<eos> This, in the name of God, I promise here. And I will die a hundred thousand deaths ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.<eos> A hundred thousand rebels die in this.<eos> Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust... ..herein.<eos> Lord Mortimer and cousin Glendower, will you sit down?<eos> And Uncle Worcester.<eos> Plague upon it, I have forgot the map.<eos> No, here it is.
What is that honour?<eos> 'Air.<eos> A trim reckoning.<eos> 'Who hath it? He that died o'Wednesday.<eos> Doth he feel it?<eos> No.<eos> 'Doth he hear it?<eos> No. "Tis insensible, then.<eos> Yea, to the dead.<eos> 'But will it not live with the living?
Acting that argument but now my death Changes the mood.<eos> For what in me was purchased Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort.<eos> Yet, though thou standest more sure than I could do Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green.<eos> And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends, Have but their stings and teeth newly taken out, By whose fell working I was first advanced<eos> Therefore, my Harry, Be it thy course to busy giddy minds With foreign quarrels.<eos> May waste the memory of the former times. Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father.<eos> Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John.<eos> More would I... but my lungs are wasted so...<eos> That strength of speech is utterly denied me.<eos> How I came by this crown O God forgive And grant it may with thee in true peace live.
How might a prince of my great hopes forget So great indignities you laid upon me?<eos> I then did use the person of your father.<eos> The image of his power lay then on me.<eos> Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours,<eos> Be now the father and propose a son, Hear your own dignity so much profaned, See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,<eos> Behold yourself so by a son disdained And then imagine me taking your part And in your power soft silencing your son.<eos> You're right, Justice, and you weigh this well.<eos> Therefore still bear the balance and the sword.<eos> The tide of blood in me Hath proudly flowed in vanity till now.<eos> Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea Where it shall mingle with the state of floods And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
I think we should discuss this with the patient and her mom.<eos> Why?<eos> We discussed it right here.<eos> Go tell 'em she needs a cerebral angiogram to locate the aneurysm, then surgery to repair.<eos> Brain surgery?<eos> When?<eos> We booked the O.R. for an hour from now.<eos> And Dr. House is sure that's what she has?<eos> He's confident in the diagnosis.<eos> It's consistent with all of her symptoms.
She'd rather remember her like she is now.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> You got the ending you wanted.<eos> 'Cause I was only looking to solve the case, not their lives.<eos> Now, I don't care if the people who work for me are screwed up.<eos> In fact, I even encourage it.<eos> But absolution?<eos> You do that on your own time.<eos> Or not at all.<eos> 'Cause... Clearly, you suck at it.
Yeah, Foreman's clearly wrong.<eos> You're clearly not grasping at straws 'cause you're clearly not emotionally involved.<eos> I know you want to believe that this is something we can cure.<eos> It's not.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How soon will they know if it's cancer?<eos> Within hours.<eos> And if it is?<eos> There's always chemo.<eos> You say that like it's not gonna work.
That's the kind of lapse that could take you out of the running for team leader.<eos> I feel surprisingly okay with that.<eos> It comes with a 50 buck-a-week raise.<eos> I'm in.<eos> You don't want to do that.<eos> You might need your dignity later in life.<eos> You didn't.<eos> And she could be on her way to living the dream unless the rest of you nut up and give her...<eos> This spiritual overhaul.<eos> Did it come after a physical overhaul?
We live in the real...<eos> I was wondering if maybe we overlooked a symptom, or something.<eos> Makes perfect sense if you're the patient, and pantywaist is the symptom.<eos> Adams and I both thought the patient could have celiac, but only she was willing to go out on a limb and run the test.<eos> I gave up.<eos> Now you're in here watching a motivational speech.<eos> Even your attempt to get your balls back lacks balls.<eos> World, the business world.<eos> If you're not a winner, you're a loser.<eos> His voice, it's lower than it is now.
Lateral view looks good.<eos> If you have such a negative opinion of the army, why did you enlist?<eos> I needed to find out what really happened to my dad.<eos> There were two redacted pages in his service record.<eos> Going into intelligence was the quickest way to up my security clearance.<eos> Then why would you leak that video?<eos> Part of my job was to grab a cup of tea with the locals.<eos> The face time is supposed to make them more likely to trust us with sensitive information, but they became my friends.<eos> If there was another attack, civilian casualties, and I had done nothing...<eos> Your spleen, it's enlarged.
My mom would freak.<eos> It would be the ultimate sign of disrespect.<eos> Okay.<eos> And maybe you consider not bitching about it?<eos> Not everyone's lucky enough to have your independence.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> When you lose your family, you'll have it too.<eos> He doesn't have sarcoid.<eos> Look at that. That's his spleen.<eos> I know. But he's gotten it supersized.
Okay, yeah.<eos> This is interesting.<eos> We'll get back to the patient in a second.<eos> Your issue is the same as Wilson's, except... you're haunted by the pitter-patter of tiny skanks.<eos> You don't feel guilty about getting Park thrown out of her home.<eos> You feel guilty about all the women that you've screwed over.<eos> My mother needs 1,000 bucks for snow tires.<eos> Park's a friend.<eos> Popo's fun.<eos> Paralysis has gone from his face to his arms, meaning it's descending, which is the hallmark of botulism.
- Mazel tov.<eos> Great relationships often start with snap decisions aimed at proving me wrong.<eos> Air bubble in the doll could mean the silicone is degrading.<eos> - If he inhaled some particles...<eos> - Silicone deposition.<eos> That could work.<eos> Start him on plasmapheresis.<eos> Now, turning to Adams, my theory is tripartite.<eos> Wanna hear my thesis?<eos> It's kind of interesting.
So, let me get this straight.<eos> I'm being dumped by a hooker who's worried about my feelings.<eos> - You're married.<eos> - Half your clients are married.<eos> And you're a hooker.<eos> My other guys sneak around. But you'll take me into the bedroom while your wife's in the next room.<eos> That's just mean.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> The marriage, it's a sham.<eos> The only real thing about it is the Green Card she's gonna get at the end of it.
Cytology showed nothing.<eos> CHASE: An amoebic infection would cause fever and meningitis.<eos> - But not liver failure.<eos> - It could if he had a clot. TAUB: How would amoebas get past his cribriform plate?<eos> He went swimming in a frozen lake in New Jersey?<eos> Adams said his ex-girlfriend was a yoga instructor.<eos> Maybe he sprained his chakras.<eos> Yoga nuts are way more likely to be into alternative medicine.<eos> He had this weird little teapot in his house.<eos> What was it like?
He probably would've ditched me, too.<eos> I can live without Kyle.<eos> Sno Ball?<eos> Guess this isn't heaven.<eos> We found out who screwed up.<eos> You.<eos> It was your industrial strength antibacterial soap.<eos> The additional triclosan does two things well.<eos> Kills MRSA, and makes your thyroid look stupid.<eos> It thinks the triclosan is a real hormone and closes up shop.
They said you were going through a rough time.<eos> Orson, I've made such a mess of my life.<eos> Don't worry, dear.<eos> The one thing you and I were always good at was cleaning things up.<eos> Yes, love can bring out the best in us...<eos> The confidence to move on...<eos> The courage to tell the truth...<eos> The strength to keep hoping...<eos> But sometimes what surprises us most isn't what love brings out...<eos> But who it brings back.

Mama?<eos> For the animals that didn't have a dad to put them in a boat the end of the world already happened.<eos> Winston!<eos> Yo, Winston!<eos> They're all down below, trying to breathe through water.<eos> Yo, Edison, you in here?<eos> Someday, when I'm gone, you gonna be the last man in the Bathtub.<eos> You're gonna have to learn how to feed yourself.<eos> Now stick your hand in this water.<eos> Stick it in there.
United in our mission to bring every...<eos> They were never recorded as evidence.<eos> No matter how big or small.<eos> Our dedication to this task knows no boundaries.<eos> With the brutal death two nights ago of Sam Bertram, a successful jeweler and business owner here in our city for over 35 years, that line has been crossed, and I for one will not rest until we bring justice to every last citizen<eos> who has ever had the misfortune of being terrorized in their streets and in their businesses and in their homes it ends here, and it ends now.<eos> Thank you. Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Captain Kolt, is this speech intended to launch a political career?<eos> Well, it's intended to be a warning to anyone who plans on breaking the law in our city.
Oh.<eos> You all right?<eos> Should we rest?<eos> No, I have to keep going.<eos> There's no telling what Lavon told George already.<eos> Well, why would he be saying anything?<eos> I mean, why would he kiss you out of nowhere, if it was over like you said. It makes no sense.<eos> I don't know. He just did.<eos> The door was closed.<eos> Yeah, how did it open again?

- Lemonade.<eos> - Hi, Daddy.<eos> - You are looking so much brighter.<eos> - Therapy is working.<eos> - He forgave you?<eos> - Well, not yet.<eos> But he agreed to do the bluebell Battle with me.<eos> Oh, well, that is great.<eos> - But the wedding...?<eos> - Well, I mean, technically it's still off. But all tomorrow, we will be working in close quarters under extreme conditions, and we will connect again.
Come on!<eos> Get in here, get in here!<eos> You gotta do something.<eos> - You gotta do something. - I don't know what the hell to do.<eos> You gotta do something.<eos> Please, make it stop.<eos> Just...<eos> I can't even think. Just be...<eos> That song...<eos> It's stuck in my head!
Okay.<eos> Okay, Lincoln, okay.<eos> O...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> One day, I would meet a child who was strong enough.<eos> I would know the one when I saw him, and when I did, I should give him this.<eos> Dad gave me this symbol 'cause he thought I was special, and I wasn't even there when he needed me.<eos> I wasn't gonna pick it up... When he called.<eos> I saw his number.<eos> I had that thing in my stomach I get when it'd come up.
- Your advance.<eos> Your signing bonus.<eos> And a little extra for a moisture-rich mani.<eos> Those hands are gonna be cradling delicate crystals on the regular.<eos> Maybe I'd have some wheels even sooner than I thought now that I'd taken matters into my own hands.<eos> Splurge on the paraffin treatment.<eos> Get up all in those little cracks.<eos> Thanks for seeing me on such short notice.<eos> My door is always open.<eos> - Except when it's closed.

- When in Rome, am I right?<eos> - No.<eos> Look, there it is.<eos> Anyone can advertise on Craigslist, is that right?<eos> Any crazy person can post an ad, luring unsuspecting innocents into their lair?<eos> - This doesn't look like a lair.<eos> - Good lairs never do.<eos> On the outside, they look regular.<eos> That's how a good lair lures you.<eos> - If it doesn't lure, it's not a lair.
FINCH: You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
And I will have equal vengeance.<eos> You can not do this!<eos> My child --<eos> Sura and I often spoke of children.<eos> Of the family we would have, now forever denied me.<eos> As I now deny Glaber of his.<eos> The child is yours.<eos> You lie.<eos> Would that my tongue made false noise.<eos> Yet it sounds bitter truth.
And I of importance to him, being prized daughter of my clan, my child heir to its lineage and fortune --<eos> Save vaunted words for grander ear.<eos> I cannot free you.<eos> We would both be absent fucking head before three steps could be taken.<eos> I do not ask such a thing.<eos> Only that you carry message, imparting where Spartacus holds me.<eos> You do not have to live this way.<eos> All that was taken from you can yet be restored, with but simple command from my husband.<eos> The sum of my loss is no small thing.<eos> He can see it paid.
What news of Ilithyia did labors bring?<eos> You have the praetor's ear.<eos> Did he not already fill yours?<eos> His attentions toward young Seppia prevent me from breaking words.<eos> Ah, the freshness of youth.<eos> Is it a wonder he favors the caress of her tongue to the sound of yours?<eos> Her bloom will wither, when Ilithyia returns.<eos> You place great stock upon uncertain future.<eos> You have not found path to Gannicus?<eos> Sadly it remains obscured.
In the streets of Neapolis, frequented for trading.<eos> The city is afire with news of your defeat.<eos> The only survivors to be executed at Varinius' fucking games.<eos> Survivors?<eos> Give names.<eos> I know only that three stand for the sands .... and one by word marked as the Undefeated Gaul.<eos> Crixus?<eos> He yet lives?<eos> Only to see sun break dawn once more.<eos> The games come to an end when it sets.
He gave seed the night you maneuvered me into laying with him.<eos> Ilithyia --<eos> I no longer lay blame at your feet.<eos> It was my hands that forced you to seek vengeance.<eos> My choices that have cast me adrift.<eos> Clinging to a woman I once hated.<eos> And a child I unreasonably grow to love.<eos> To feel such hope and such joy blossoming within you...<eos> That's the rarest of all flowers.<eos> Regardless of why it blooms.
Oenomaus.<eos> I thought you for the afterlife.<eos> As I you.<eos> Yet we did not escaped deep wounds.<eos> A thing to be visited upon the Romans a thousand fold.<eos> Now that Oenomaus stands with us once again.<eos> He was a fool to be gone so long from your de.<eos> Such things are of the past.<eos> Let us turn thought towards future.<eos> And what joys it may hold.
Who stands forth as your voice?<eos> Ocvius Tarsus.<eos> I stand for them.<eos> Your benefactor has been ripped from this world by the villain Spartacus.<eos> Towards his end, I conscript you and your men into the army of Gaius Claudius Glaber.<eos> Recite the Sacramentum, and commit loyalty.<eos> I, Octavius Tarsus, swear by Jupiter Optimus Maximus, that I shall uphold and defend the Republic.<eos> I swear to have her enemies as my enemies and her friends as my friends.<eos> You've taken to your old color.<eos> I fear it no longer suits me.
Like attacking the arena with a handful of men?<eos> I once thought you reckless fool.<eos> Now I see bold strategy is the only reason you're not already dead.<eos> I have been but fortunate, to have-- seized opportunity the Romans would consider mad.<eos> There stand none left to us now, absent wings to fly from cliff.<eos> The day comes when we must face Glaber and his army in open battle.<eos> If I am to die, at least I shall die among brothers.<eos> We share a bond.<eos> Forged not upon the sands, but upon grander stage of battle.<eos> And when it ends, I will gain Batiatus's ludus and villa as reward for loyal service.
And would... travel a greater distance still.<eos> You wish to return to Rome.<eos> With my husband beside me.<eos> The rebels become desperate.<eos> A few more weeks from starvation --<eos> A few more weeks and your heir will be born in a house tainted with blood and shit.<eos> End Spartacus's life.<eos> And let us return home to ours.<eos> He holds the higher ground.<eos> It cannot be taken yet without severe loss of men.

I swear it to you,<eos> Praetor!<eos> I would test such vaunted words.<eos> And the depths of your loyalty.<eos> Spartacus!<eos> There's movement upon the path.<eos> Take position!<eos> Asher!<eos> I come bearing message from Glaber!<eos> Speak it.
Enough for four men.<eos> Agron.<eos> Crixus.<eos> Gannicus.<eos> I would have you by my side.<eos> Crixus...<eos> We will be reunited soon.<eos> In this life, or the next.<eos> I know fear wells within your breast.<eos> And it does so with great cause.
When the job's done, you'll get your cut.<eos> Just like the rest of us.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Welcome.<eos> I am Major Rigosso.<eos> We are thrilled to have you here.<eos> Please allow me the pleasure of explaining the mission.<eos> These elevators will take us beneath the surface of the planet below.<eos> Waiting there is a sub tram which is carrying very precious cargo.<eos> Your mission is to protect the tram as it makes its way to the final destination.

Roger, roger.<eos> The army of the dead, her reinforcements.<eos> The undead will clear us a path right to Grievous.<eos> Ventress has her army now.<eos> Good.<eos> Now I can deal with Count Dooku.<eos> We found it, Mother.<eos> Here is the orb you requested.<eos> Well done.<eos> Ah, here it is.
It's hot out here.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> "Thanks"?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Where's my three bucks?<eos> Well, at least it wasn't a total loss.<eos> Now we know where their base is.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, where is it?
No... no, no, no. Don't do it!<eos> Can't hear you.<eos> Please!<eos> Please, no!<eos> Hey, after the war, do you wanna come over and play video games? Shut up.<eos> We've got a problem.<eos> What?<eos> - There's no flag.<eos> So, why would anybody come into this base?<eos> It's deserted.
Dan.<eos> How y'all doing?<eos> What you want, girlfriend fucker?<eos> That's right, girlfriend fucker.<eos> Just want to talk to my friend.<eos> Well... you don't have any friends at this table.<eos> Oh, come on, Bubba.<eos> We got too much history between us. History, huh?<eos> You know what they say about history?<eos> - They say it's always repeating itself.
I'm throwing you a lifeline here.<eos> Please take it.<eos> Like I said, I can't.<eos> You know where to find me if you change your mind.<eos> God damn, Sook, what the fuck was that?<eos> You're gonna get us both locked up.<eos> How fucking stupid can you be? I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> The sun will be going down soon.<eos> We should be there for Tara when it does.
Let's take five and get our bearing.<eos> I'm going to take one.<eos> A number one.<eos> Do you take a number one or do you leave a number one ?<eos> Sounds like a personal decision.<eos> I'll leave it.<eos> Looks like we're coming up on some hostile territory.<eos> No, really ?<eos> I thought this would be a great place for a summer home.<eos> There's no indication of this road on the map but its clear they used it for transport at one point.
Oh, I'm sure you do.<eos> How about we talk about this militia camp ?<eos> Like why you even think it's there to begin with ? And why you think bin Laden might be there ?<eos> I took this off of a guy that obviously can't read anymore.<eos> - No question that this is Intel on the militia camp.<eos> But who's there is anyone's guess. Even we're guessing.<eos> You guys do that a lot.<eos> But you're trying, which is all anyone can ask.<eos> Look, the road that we're on was not on my map. Okay-<eos> - It's not on any maps.
Those nurses are styling.<eos> Trying to save up some money, so I can move out of my mom's.<eos> Somebody's gonna rip those hoops right out.<eos> Mm-mmm. Check it.<eos> "Wanted, roommate."<eos> Gonna hang these up around the hospital today, see if I can find somebody to go splitsies with me on a phat pad.<eos> You need a roommate, Gloria? No.<eos> Beautiful morning, huh? So pretty, yes.<eos> Gloria, how's the recertification coming?<eos> It's coming, Dr. Cruz.
I'm always good at school.<eos> I'm quiet and I get good grades.<eos> And I'm always the one that gets treated bad.<eos> So how can I believe in God?<eos> Hey, good morning. How are you? Good morning.<eos> Great, thank you.<eos> Have a wonderful time.<eos> - Hey, Marty, how are you doing? - I'm fine.<eos> [ Man ] The Biblical virtue of perseverance... Is very, very rare today.<eos> It runs counter to most people's mind-sets.
So how can I believe in God?<eos> Hey, good morning. How are you?

Is very, very rare today.<eos> It runs counter to most people's mind-sets.<eos> Perseverance takes a long-term perspective, [ Clicking ] Rather than focusing on the immediate present.<eos> - Perseverance is patient. - [ Clicking Continues ]<eos> It keeps waiting, it keeps trusting, it keeps believing, Even when things take longer than expected.
I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> No, it's all right.<eos> Hey, we're meeting that nurse on monday... 3:00 P.M. - John...<eos> - Brizia Mun... is it Brizia or Britzia?<eos> You do remember what our lawyer told us, right? Whatever.<eos> I can't wait to shake that woman's hand.<eos> If that nurse is lying and we sign on to a false document, we could go to jail.<eos> Sweetie, I looked over the affidavit.<eos> It looks very credible to me.
I hope I'm not interrupting. I won't take up your time, but I bring good news and I wanted to deliver it personally.<eos> Well, I can always use more of that.<eos> Sit down. Thank you.<eos> Thank you, thank you. Um, Monsignor Ferraro's medical investigation is completed.<eos> And, while it's not official-- the Vatican moves like Midtown traffic-- he's confident the miracle will be confirmed.<eos> And how's that work?<eos> Well, the doctors involved in the case were clear in their confirmation:<eos> the boy's tumor disappeared and they can't explain why.<eos> So... it's a miracle?<eos> We believe it was. You know, I had a cinnamon bun this morning
She was right. Maybe her or God can help us again.<eos> I hope he doesn't bring his attorney.<eos> So, this is where God spoke to you, huh?<eos> Right over here? Yeah, I was on a run and I had stopped to rest.<eos> This city's really beautiful, if you take the time to look at it.<eos> And I was looking up at the trees.<eos> And that's when you heard the voice?<eos> As clear as I am hearing yours right now, yeah.<eos> Okay, well, what exactly did this voice say to you?<eos> It said that my mother was dead.
And that's when you heard the voice?<eos> As clear as I am hearing yours right now, yeah.<eos> Okay, well, what exactly did this voice say to you?<eos> It said that my mother was dead.<eos> That Charles killed her.<eos> Right.<eos> I knew that it was true.<eos> I started to cry. Okay, did the voice say anything else to you?<eos> - Anything at all?<eos> - No. It hasn't said anything to you since?
They're for you and Miss Aurora.<eos> We've already had dinner.<eos> They'll go to waste.<eos> I've kept lots.<eos> Thank you, Miss Pilar.<eos> How I decided to travel the world:<eos> I was born in York in 1632 to a good family.<eos> After becoming a rich man, my father retired from business and settled down in this town.<eos> He had married my mother...<eos> It is thought to be a hideout of the Moors of the Moors and Romans.
Only then can the Fuhrer negotiate with the British and Americans from a strong position.<eos> Gentlemen, here is our new Chief of Staff, General Speidel.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> This is Countess La Rochefoucauld, this castle was her uncle's.<eos> Bonjour.<eos> - Comtesse.<eos> Bonjour. Her German is excellent.<eos> She translates for us.<eos> Is that your famous ancestor, the author?<eos> "Youth is a state of continuous intoxication, it is the fever of the mind."
MacLaren's is a rip-off!<eos> You'd all be better off coming upstairs to my place for a beer.<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> You serious?<eos> Ted, do you remember a couple years ago, we had the best idea of all time?<eos> We should buy a bar.<eos> Of course!<eos> We could buy a bar!<eos> The name of our bar? Puzzles.<eos> People will be like, "Why is it called Puzzles?"
He told me he loves me, he's sorry, and I'm the only girl for him.<eos> You know, since we'll here, and we're all horny...<eos> I don't know what went wrong.<eos> Well, proposing the three-way was bad, starting without us was worse, finishing in the hallway was the nail in the coffin. No!<eos> Stop drinking!<eos> I gotta get you back on air!<eos> But I'm single and ready to mingle!<eos> Hello, there.<eos> Oh, the Twitter-verse blowing up about a new apartment-themed bar called Puzzles.<eos> Why is it called Puzzles?
It's okay.<eos> Uh, I'm...<eos> I'm Jane, the new resident manager.<eos> John Barlow.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I cut my hand.<eos> W-wash that with soap.<eos> Babe, he cut his hand.<eos> It happens.<eos> It was covered in blood, Henry.
Alex, "from the bar".<eos> No.<eos> In there.<eos> Did that just look a little bit gay to you?<eos> Did it?<eos> OK, if you say so.<eos> D'you wanna tell me what we're doing here?<eos> This guy, Alex, "from the bar", he's got a date with a friend of mine and we're finding out if he's gay.<eos> Why?<eos> So I can completely destroy his relationship with Jess before it's even started.
No.<eos> Dude, no, I'm not feeling it.<eos> It's like I'm fucking numb.<eos> It's like I'm paralysed from me cock down over here.<eos> Ssh!<eos> Listen, oi, you know me, usually I'd be all over that.<eos> This used to be me favourite bit.<eos> Look at 'em all, stretching out their fannies, all nice and wide with their big, swollen milky tits.<eos> You know, their vaginae, they have an expiry date, mate.<eos> You've got to get one last taste of that fruit before it goes off.
I was surprised when I heard you left the Argus to start Woman's Choice.<eos> I thought newspaper journalism was more your style?<eos> But how many women read the newspapers?<eos> If I have to run 100 new recipes and dress patterns for just one article on women's health or education that may change a life, then I'm happy.<eos> No wonder my father didn't stand a chance against you.<eos> He was wrong, I was right.<eos> One clever, grubby little girl gets to stay at school and look what you end up with.<eos> Sad truth is, though, most of our readers are waiting with bated breath for the next instalment of the Blue Fairies.<eos> Which hasn't been written?<eos> It has, but it's now off limits in Marcella's office.
Obviously her blue period.<eos> Blue seems to have been her colour till the bitter end.<eos> I would have guessed a thrombosis if I didn't suspect somebody had it in for her.<eos> I think that classifies as touching something.<eos> Would you like me to slip on some gloves?<eos> No.<eos> Just the desk drawer...<eos> Goodbye, Miss Fisher.<eos> If you happen to find that story...<eos> It may be relevant to the case.
I told him I'd, uh, I'd have to think about it.<eos> £500 don't seem like a lot for a hanging offence.<eos> You thought you could get the price up?<eos> I was stalling him.<eos> He said he had a valuable piece of art to sell, and if I helped him move it on, I'd get a piece of the pie.<eos> I said I'd get back to him if I was interested.<eos> How?<eos> He gave me the card, uh, for some hotel he was staying at.<eos> He said he'd be there for the rest of the week.<eos> Here it is.
I woke her up, then told her I'd go and fetch some help.<eos> But when I came back, she was gone.<eos> I thought she must have come to or maybe she'd just come back.<eos> So I waited all night.<eos> But I don't know how she ended up in the water, I swear.<eos> Are you going to lock me up?<eos> That's enough for now.<eos> Why don't you go and wait with the others, Rose?<eos> We'll see if the autopsy confirms a head injury consistent with her story.<eos> I just hope it doesn't confirm it as the cause of death.
This is what my life has become?<eos> Time to start prying one monkey off my back.<eos> Got a package here addressed to Miami Metro forensics.<eos> Oh, yeah, I'll take it.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I think I drunk-ordered from the Hustler store and that never turns out well.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> "Dear Mr. Greene, when I bought the Ice Truck Killer's hand...<eos> I assumed it would be in mint condition, not with lines over its palm.
Oh, God.<eos> There will never be an app for this.<eos> That was before we started dating.<eos> You're wearing the shift I gave you for your birthday, asshole.<eos> It was a hooker.<eos> It's not cheating if you pay for it.<eos> Oh, my God, you are a pig.<eos> If I catch anything from you, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> How did you get that disc?<eos> It was mailed to me anonymously, probably by your hooker.
Mini Ellis Grey.<eos> No. I'm still on the fence about it because there are a lot of specialties out there...<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> It's in your genes, Grey.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> Oh, uh, Karen and Marcy, I'd like you to meet Dr. Bailey and Dr. Grey.<eos> They'll be performing the liver transplant with me today.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> This I.V. really hurts.<eos> You think it could be infected?
Oh, uh, Karen and Marcy, I'd like you to meet Dr. Bailey and Dr. Grey.<eos> They'll be performing the liver transplant with me today.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> This I.V. really hurts.<eos> You think it could be infected?<eos> I mean, I'm already missing my family vacation for this.<eos> I'd-I'd hate to die of staph.<eos> You're not gonna die, Marcy.<eos> I am the one in liver failure.<eos> It doesn't look infected.
That's all anyone ever says...<eos> It's in my blood, it's my legacy.<eos> That's why I don't want to do it.<eos> I don't want to be like my mother.<eos> Meredith, look at everything you did today...<eos> This party for your daughter, what you did for me in that O.R.<eos> You don't have to ever worry about being anything like your mother.<eos> I knew her, and you're nothing like your mother.<eos> You have a gift.<eos> Don't waste it.
Oh my... that face, do you think maybe I could get a photo for my album at home?<eos> Maybe from her baptism or first communion.<eos> I'm assuming that you're catholic.<eos> I am.<eos> Regina's "recovering."<eos> - I don't go to church anymore. - Oh.<eos> I only go to church under protest so I'm pretty godless too grandma.<eos> Hey, can you put on headphones if you're going to string** your guitar<eos> I'm trying to create important art over here.<eos> So important that it stays in your garage all day?
Can I ask you a question?<eos> Yes.<eos> Ηow did you get hooked up with a guy like Pryce?<eos> I mean, him, I get.<eos> Ηe's out here on some Boy's Own adventure. Τhinks he's Allan bloody Quartermain.<eos> But you, you seem smart, serious.<eos> Τhis isn't just a holiday for you.<eos> I came here for my own research.<eos> What kind of research?<eos> Τhis time in our history, the Second World War, it's very complex.
Τhey gave us injections, told us it would keep us young, keep us strong.<eos> But it was just another experiment, another failure.<eos> What's it all for?<eos> What were they trying to do here?<eos> Τhey were trying to make human weapons, impossible soldiers.<eos> And this is what they got?<eos> What's he saying?<eos> Ηe says that they were not the last of the experiments.<eos> Τhey perfected the formula.<eos> Gave it to their best.
Foothill Ranch.<eos> - Dan, you got an address?<eos> - Just Old Mill Road.<eos> Did you get that?<eos> Old Mill Road.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll find it, and I'll call you when I get there.<eos> - I'm already out that way to pick up Brent.<eos> - Hey, you're gonna need backup<eos> Go ahead and call it in, but I'm closer, and I'm not leaving her out there alone.
- Stop talking.<eos> Thank you<eos> Here we are Ah.. another portrait<eos> Self portait<eos> Leopold Leopoldovic was as prolific artist<eos> This magnificent and extensive library ..<eos> Don't tell me ..<eos> Leopold Leopoldovic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - It's very impressive.
Everything okay with Sam?<eos> It won't be if Bill calls.<eos> I think she's bluffing.<eos> You can tell from that grainy overhead camera?<eos> You must be hell at the table.<eos> You should try me sometime.<eos> You're on.<eos> All right, now I just have to get rid of the delay in the alerts.<eos> If that anomaly recurs, we have to get back there fast.<eos> If it doesn't open again, we could just start a permanent sanctuary for stray dinosaurs.
It's a hypothesis, Mac.<eos> Even if we prove it's wrong, it's still information.<eos> I should've said no.<eos> I shouldn't have brought Sam into this.<eos> [Chuckles] Last time I checked, you don't give work assignments and Sam is pretty kickass.<eos> I'm sure she can handle herself. [Scanner beeps an alert]<eos> Oh, my God, the anomaly, it opened. Toby!<eos> Dammit!<eos> Closed again.<eos> Well, maybe it will come back, and we can send that creature home after all.
Don't do this, Mac.<eos> Mac! Evan, I found something.<eos> Where?<eos> Look, right there.<eos> On the edge.<eos> It's coming out of the vent that leads to the roof.<eos> How did it get there from the loading bay? It didn't.<eos> The markings are different.<eos> Shit.<eos> A second one must have come through the anomaly when it reopened.
I need more.<eos> The McDermott file doesn't connect the dots.<eos> It's not me.<eos> It's Wendy.<eos> Give me more, and we'll tear it up.<eos> The rider evidence that can hurt Alicia?<eos> We'll tear it up.<eos> You got to smile.<eos> I got to smile?<eos> Yes, 'cause the grand jury will perceive your attitude as hostile if it's... hostile.
The jury needs to know she has an incentive to protect him.<eos> You asked me what I thought about their relationship, and I told you... in confidence.<eos> If you're not comfortable, Mr. Agos, you are free to step out.<eos> - Mrs. - Florrick, one more time. While working at his firm, at any time, have you and Will Gardner engaged in a sexual relationship?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is this sexual relationship still active?<eos> No.<eos> When did this relationship begin?<eos> In the spring.<eos> And when did it end?
Thank you.<eos> The witness has not been excused!<eos> You are out of control.<eos> Mrs. Florrick, if you do not sit back down,<eos> I will have you held in contempt. Fine.<eos> Arrest me.<eos> Mrs. Florrick? Hi.<eos> You zipped out of there.<eos> I didn't get a chance to do a postmortem.<eos> The transcript of the hearing... it'll be released to the public?

Hi.<eos> You zipped out of there.<eos> I didn't get a chance to do a postmortem.<eos> The transcript of the hearing... it'll be released to the public?<eos> Only if Mr. Gardner's indicted.<eos> Otherwise, it stays sealed.
And right now, I don't.<eos> Oh!<eos> Wow!<eos> What was that?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> It's a kid.<eos> A harnessed kid.<eos> She's unconscious, but she seems to be coming to.<eos> Aside from that, I think her harness might be internally damaged.<eos> It isn't glowing.
You're not condoning the attack, are you, General?<eos> I'm saying what happened happened.<eos> End of story.<eos> I'm canceling the mission.<eos> You can't do that!<eos> Those are my orders.<eos> Dad.<eos> We have to go on this mission.<eos> This is about more than the rebels, more than the Overlord.<eos> This weapon will wipe out everything if it's finished.
This ain't no coach tour.<eos> Really, Cap?<eos> I thought we were going to see the Grand Canyon.<eos> Hey!<eos> Bro, you got steel-plated cojones showing up here after putting a hole in my arm.<eos> I'm sorry about that, Lyle.<eos> I truly am.<eos> Clemons was gonna kill you.<eos> What happened to your uniform, soldier boy?<eos> Threw it in the incinerator.
You are being watched...<eos> The government has a secret system--<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know, because I built it. I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
Saw you play the trumpet.<eos> I'm guessing you pawned that too.<eos> - You any good?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> My brother wanted me to go to music school...<eos> Instead of getting mixed up with the thugs.<eos> And here you are, mixed up with the thugs.<eos> So you tracked down that Brick kid.<eos> You think that's what your brother would have wanted you to do?<eos> Saw him wearing that hat like it was some type of scalp.
$50,000 of your life up in smoke.<eos> Andre's gonna believe me.<eos> Let's find out.<eos> What?<eos> No!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Where's the murder weapon?<eos> Chimney...<eos> Top of my grandma's building.<eos> It better be.
A Scout is trustworthy, loyal.<eos> A Scout is helpful, friendly, courteous.<eos> A Scout is kind, obedient, pure of thought and deed.<eos> How could we let it get this far?<eos> Brace up, Jess. Not here.<eos> We stole, Harry. We stole.<eos> Apart from the laws of God, has a greater doctrine ever been forged?<eos> Now, while we enjoy breakfast, Troop 14 from Laurel, Maryland, will serenade us with a campfire favorite.<eos> Jess isn't feeling well. He got a bad sausage.<eos> They undercook it, it tends to spoil.
Didn't you notice anything?<eos> The painting.<eos> The man lying there is Aris Kindt.<eos> He's just been hanged for theft.<eos> It's Doctor Tulp giving the anatomy lesson.<eos> They should have cut open the abdomen first.<eos> But they dissected the left hand instead.<eos> There's a mistake.<eos> The hand is wrong.<eos> It's the opposite one.

He said he'd offered you an appointment.<eos> If I need a piano tuner, I'll get one myself.<eos> That's right.<eos> If you need someone, find them yourself.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I won't help.<eos> -I don't want help.<eos> And the broken Socket?<eos> What's that?<eos> Found someone for it?
I wouldn't.<eos> Well, not that I.... Buy into that stuff.<eos> You're creeped out by it, but you don't believe in it.<eos> How exactly does that work?<eos> Well, I think....<eos> You grow up with an idea and it kind of becomes engrained in you.<eos> I bet if you go on this tour with me.... You wouldn't be freaked out.<eos> Look at you. You're freaked out.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's gonna be fun.
With what?<eos> They took everything we have.<eos> Okay, well, maybe your dad will get lucky and he'll get a jury that'll sympathize with him.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How many people do you know sympathize with illegal immigrants?<eos> Hey...<eos> Just take a look at the pictures, all right?<eos> They found the gun in the Ortiz apartment.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sending it to the lab now.
And always with your Wagner!<eos> The writings of this people are just as dangerous as his music.<eos> Wide you know what is your love for art really?<eos> Weakn ss.<eos> Nothing but weakness.<eos> No<eos> (Exciting music)<eos> (dramatic music)<eos> (Ludwig) What for a perfect script.<eos> (Lutz) Some say it is the mirror of the soul.
Due to the absence of majesty.<eos> This must just imagine it!<eos> I ask you a King is not bio Under a typewriter ...<eos> In the hands of his ministers.<eos> - Yes, yes, yes, you're right, Mr. Lutz.<eos> Still, he is a very fatal influence under .<eos> In short, if Majesty continue to stay away from Munich, then threatens our country in the gegenwrtigen unstable situation ... An absolute disaster.<eos> Majesty know his duties.<eos> Your tongue is pointed, Mr. Lutz.<eos> Take care take care not to violate it.
(Man out of the crowd) Who wants to lead the music of Wagner?<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - It is not about Wagner.<eos> You want to force me to mobilize the army .<eos> All the courtiers are DAFR.<eos> Ludw g.<eos> You are a Grail Knight.<eos> You'll have the power to prevent war and Wagner ...<eos> This world does not understand us.<eos> It assesses all wrong.
Can you take a sandwich in the kitchen?<eos> Are we then football.<eos> This lady is so gone.<eos> Go away.<eos> Why did you have a loaded gun at you.<eos> Did you want to shoot someone?<eos> Why did you do it?<eos> You're a loaded gun at a party.<eos> - For God's sake ...<eos> That old witch took it off and I have not seen.
Oh, jeez, I think she's trying to get herself sucked into the filter.<eos> What'd you say to her?<eos> I didn't say anything!<eos> Wait a second.<eos> Jay, look.<eos> See?<eos> She was not trying to kill herself.<eos> She was just trying to get to the squeaky wiener!<eos> That must be why she's been jumping in.<eos> It must have been there all the time.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
This guy's gonna go boom.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Okay.<eos> What do we got?<eos> There's a long and deep laceration in the right lobe of the liver.<eos> Put in a retractor so I can see the spleen.<eos> Deaver.<eos> What does it look like?<eos> It's mush.<eos> It's not salvageable.
Well, we're gonna go ahead with the surgery. Thank you.<eos> Okay, uh, with all due respect, he's got a lot of issues tied up in that arm.<eos> Let me ask you something, man.<eos> Do you think being a doctor automatically makes you smarter than the patient?<eos> Depends who you're talking to. Oh, you're talking to me.<eos> Look, this kid wants his arm off.<eos> I don't think he's entirely wrong.<eos> As surgeons, we deal in absolutes, in certainty.<eos> We make a choice.<eos> We believe it's right.
Oregon.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Hello, Mr. Beaver. In future episodes, we'll answer some burning questions:<eos> What's the only non-rectangular flag?<eos> What animal appears most often on flags?<eos> What animal appears second most often on flags?<eos> And more. Sweet!<eos> Why are you waving a white flag?<eos> I'm surrendering... to fun.<eos> Now, today's episode of Fun with Flags is not fun, but it is important.
Talk to me.<eos> Just speak with me!<eos> The sea gives and the sea accepts, like the tides.<eos> But the sea still had a Another gift for Varvakis.<eos> The most important and most important of his life.<eos> More important than caviar?<eos> Yes.<eos> And even more precious.<eos> Gentlemen, the concession here is for the global trade in caviar.<eos> From now on it is yours and local fishermen.
OK then;<eos> I'm eating out with my ex-husband but the caretaker will stay with Mina.<eos> I can do that.<eos> You can?<eos> Cop, pianist and baby-sitter?<eos> You're not a common man, Mr Almeida.<eos> I even surprise myself sometimes.<eos> The VIP treatment is still on.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You ask for an ADN test on the sly and think I won't hear about it?
It's here.<eos> The message she left me...<eos> What did she apologize for?<eos> What did it mean?<eos> Elena is dedicated to you, she must have felt abandoned or on her own.<eos> She would never hurt me.<eos> Never.<eos> Eric.<eos> I have the DNA results for the car park gun.<eos> It doesn't match Roxana Orlac or her sister, but it is a woman's.
If he wasn't all jacked up on V, I'd kill him right now.<eos> But as it is, he practically killed me.<eos> The only way to beat him is to play by his rules.<eos> If he's on the same blood that Rikki's on, it's some seriously inferior shit.<eos> I got some of the best shit available I keep for special occasions just like this one.<eos> Lots of folks wanted to kill me over the years.<eos> I do what I have to to stay alive.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I have an idea.<eos> Will it work?
Just one?<eos> You got a golf game? You know what, people?<eos> I keep saying it.<eos> If you're not innovating, be generating.<eos> Cardio?<eos> Yang is doing a solo thoracic aortic aneurysm, oh, uh, and also, I'll be checking in on my kid with the artificial lung who is waiting for a transplant.<eos> Uh, yeah, can I just say for the record that he's my patient, and I don't agree with this method of treatment?<eos> The fda has not approved an artificial lung on children.<eos> Well, I got emergency approval.<eos> It buys the kid more time, it keeps him from being sedated and ventilated,
By experiences.<eos> As of late, I find my perception is blinded by only one thing:<eos> Revenge.<eos> Things aren't what they seem.<eos> I can promise you, Victoria Grayson had nothing to do with my arrest.<eos> If anything, she's another victim.<eos> The father of her child is in prison, and she's being forced to raise our baby with the man I believe put me here.<eos> Mom?<eos> - Did you see the invitation?<eos> - Mm-hmm. It's gorgeous.
- They just came in.<eos> - Hey, wish me luck.<eos> Mrs. G. Thanks for joining us.<eos> Thank you for having me, Declan.<eos> It's like the beginning of a joke.<eos> Two Graysons walk into a bar...<eos> Well, perhaps we should have a drink before I hear the punch line.<eos> Do you have a wine list?<eos> We do.<eos> It's two wines long.
Sweetheart, that's not a good idea.<eos> It's very important to your father that the evening go without a hitch.<eos> Dad can hardly force a smile long enough to take a picture with me.<eos> He'll behave.<eos> I spoke to him.<eos> It's open.<eos> Ah...<eos> It's Victoria's pet bird.<eos> She wanted to me to pick up your list of invites for Fire Ice.<eos> Oh, well, unfortunately, it's incomplete.
Well... lucky for you, you got the captain of the geek squad in your back pocket.<eos> That's not what I'm saying, Nolan.<eos> You've been a really good friend.<eos> Probably one of my only.<eos> Can I ask you something, friend to friend?<eos> Shoot.<eos> Why do you want to watch this?<eos> I mean, if Amanda already admitted that she set the fire, what does it matter?<eos> Because the reality can't be any worse than my imagination.<eos> What if it is?
How do you know that?<eos> Because he was just here.<eos> - He nearly broke the door down.<eos> - Amanda, listen to me...<eos> No, I'm done listening to you.<eos> I'm gonna start listening to Jack now.<eos> I'm going after him.<eos> - Amanda...<eos> - Modern technology...<eos> It's gonna be the death of us all.
So when Cam came and organized my kitchen, I felt insecure and lashed out.<eos> In a way, I'm no better than Manny's crazy friend Danielle.<eos> Please, can we just focus on the cooking?<eos> Daddy, we forgot to give you this.<eos> It's like our jackets.<eos> I love it.<eos> I guess I've always been a little sensitive about Lily not having a mother, and Gloria's so good at it.<eos> I got jealous.<eos> Maybe I should tell Manny this story.<eos> It might help him with that train wreck Danielle.
If you read my Tweet, you wouldn't have to ask.<eos> Ha, ha.<eos> Well, I'd rather ask.<eos> When I don't see you, I worry about you, Dallas.<eos> I mean, I think about you.<eos> I know this must be kind of a rough time.<eos> - Rough time?<eos> - You know.<eos> With the divorce.<eos> - I heard it was finalized.
Yeah, I forgot...<eos> Why?<eos> Something about ethical standards.<eos> A necrophiliac on the teaching staff was deemed to be inappropriate.<eos> The photo just above the table that's Edith.<eos> When I married her I knew she had cancer.<eos> She'd just finished chemo.<eos> That's not her hair.<eos> She's wearing a wig.<eos> It looked good on her.

We know whose fault that is, don't we?<eos> Your wife's on the phone.<eos> She wants to talk to you...<eos> You recognize these?<eos> - The gamekeeper's antlers.<eos> - Why'd you take aim at these?<eos> - He shot my dog. - It was running loose in the woods.<eos> Why don't you give me the gun?<eos> How'd you get it anyway?<eos> It belonged to old Mr. Lisner.
Put that over there.<eos> Perfect.<eos> Have fun at the party tonight.<eos> I hear there's gonna be fireworks.<eos> New gun?<eos> That was fast.<eos> So you're determined to turn this party into a funeral?<eos> I'm determined to be prepared for anything.<eos> You of all people should know how unpredictable Tyler can be.<eos> Well, then just cancel it, Ems.
- You're just glad to be rid of her?<eos> We've been searching for hours.<eos> And I've been at home with our youngest daughter, who's asleep.<eos> Now what? We're just sitting here?<eos> I fear it may be the authorities that has taken her.<eos> There's no trace of any bombs and this tunnel leads nowhere, it's a service duct.<eos> Thanks, you keep telling me.<eos> Just bring in that fuck, Ove Holm.<eos> A silver hard drive.<eos> Niska cannot have left with it. It has to be here.
You have the money!<eos> First, I want to see her!<eos> - How does he know it's a she?<eos> - No idea. - What?<eos> We meet halfway!<eos> And bring the money!<eos> Okay, easy, easy.<eos> There.<eos> She has the mark.<eos> It's wrong.
- What makes you so special?<eos> Well... My mother gave birth to me.<eos> I have a history, I have emotions.<eos> I'm aware of my existance, and that I will die one day.<eos> I ask for ketchup, instead of lingonberry jam for the meatballs.<eos> I'm embarrassed about my knees.<eos> There...<eos> My name is Mimi.<eos> I was born of David.<eos> I don't know who I want to be in this world, it's new to me.
I'll get your receipt.<eos> Um, do you know where this last box of clothes came from?<eos> I don't.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> No.<eos> I was just curious.<eos> Em, call me.<eos> I'm still at the church, and I just found...<eos> I thought that you and Spencer got rid of all of your clothes... the gray jacket from that night?<eos> It just came out of a donation box.
Hi, Paige.<eos> Hi.<eos> What's up?<eos> We'll talk later.<eos> You know, I'm leaving.<eos> I shouldn't really be back here anyway.<eos> It's a no-friend zone.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> Laurel's equipment.<eos> She said it was back here.
You don't want to get too close when that happens.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> It's an observation.<eos> Mrs. Montgomery?<eos> Can I talk to you?<eos> Of course.<eos> I wanted to ask you about the makeup test.<eos> I saw my grade, and I think there's something wrong.<eos> I don't think it's...<eos> Well, are you sure it's accurate?
Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Spencer, you were right.<eos> I'm withdrawing the reward.<eos> The truth always comes out, Jason.<eos> Meet me in the parking lot in 15 minutes.<eos> We know that somewhere between being with us and getting to Alison's grave, you were with Jenna.<eos> We just have to find out what happened that night.<eos> My boss volunteered the bank staff to help out at a rummage sale at the church.<eos> Em, I just found the gray jacket from that night.<eos> It just came out of a donation box.
We're going to replace Garrett's note with a fake note that we wrote.<eos> I know that part.<eos> I came up with it, remember?<eos> I was wondering why you were asking me that.<eos> But we still need a place to lead "A."<eos> Rosewood church, by the organ in the main sanctuary, tonight.<eos> How did you come up with that?<eos> I have been living there since my mom signed me up to sort through spandex shorts and granny panties.<eos> But won't the church be locked? That's the point.<eos> It's deserted at night.
We talk on TV, on the radio...<eos> We look everywhere.<eos> She would call the police every day.<eos> One day they even we drove out of the station.<eos> She swore a lot.<eos> It was a scene.<eos> Then we started fighting for any little thing.<eos> Sabine could not bear to see me up all night. When she caught me drinking I left.<eos> I moved to this house.<eos> It's too big for me.
- Thank you.<eos> - Its passage.<eos> - Have a good trip.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Juliette.<eos> Constance.<eos> Write your address, I send the money later.<eos> Please.<eos> Prefer well.<eos> There it is.
Come here and watch. So you'll learn.<eos> Old model.<eos> He has many corrupted files.<eos> - Oh? - Then we'll repair them, like this.<eos> Here's the ID-connection. Someone owns him.<eos> Hello?<eos> Odi.<eos> - Where is Lennart?<eos> - We deactivate the ID-connection.<eos> - Why not just erase it?
Diego.<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> I can't talk.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Nice hat.<eos> You a baseball fan?<eos> No.<eos> I just found it.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system...<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know, because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
- Paul!<eos> I'm the squad leader and not you. Lower your gun. And we'll put an end to all this.<eos> Shut up and put your gun on the ground!<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Freeze!<eos> - Stop fucking around, Paul!<eos> Freeze!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Put your gun on the ground.<eos> Kick it away!
You never lied to anyone else here?<eos> Jessica, the other partners, me?<eos> - Not since you've been back.<eos> - Really?<eos> When did Jessica assign you this case?<eos> You lied to me.<eos> But I didn't come to the bathroom and cry about it.<eos> No, you sent my associate to go crying to the other side.<eos> So he got us a final number.<eos> He got a number, but it's not going to be final.
I can't stop.<eos> I don't want to stop.<eos> Uh, we should really figure out a way to get at this equipment fund.<eos> It's going to be a long night.<eos> That's okay.<eos> I don't really have much of a social life.<eos> Me either.<eos> Barbaric.<eos> Norma, the Scofield subpoena is missing an entire class of subcontracts.<eos> Please amend it to include anything after 2010.
You covered for me with him earlier, so I threw you a bone.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> Where's this coming from?<eos> I'll tell you where it's coming from.<eos> You were right.<eos> Actions have impact.<eos> So you want to remember the marijuana and tennis thing?<eos> Well, I'm gonna remember things too.<eos> How's your budding bro-mance with Louis?<eos> Evidently, it's over.
I never saw this thing in my life.<eos> That document never came into this office, or you would have seen it.<eos> A lot of people are gonna think I buried that document.<eos> How can you bury what doesn't exist?<eos> You think that I don't know that there's a power struggle going on between Jessica and Hardman?<eos> This guy gets one whiff of what we've been hiding from Hardman-- I know, we can't trust him.<eos> Louis, is there anything you want to tell me?<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> That memo doesn't hurt me.<eos> It helps me.

What do you think?<eos> Well, you shouldn't have shot him!<eos> He wasn't chomping on your leg.<eos> Ah, police are gonna be all over this thing now.<eos> - We're going back.<eos> - What?<eos> We left a fortune in there.<eos> Cops don't know what we're after and they'll be done going over the place by now.<eos> Give me the needle.<eos> Give it to me.
I'm just trying to...<eos> Understand how... How this works.<eos> It's, um...<eos> It's a little complicated.<eos> Yeah, I can see that.<eos> Just find the men who killed my brother.<eos> - Oh, my gosh, you scared me.<eos> - Sorry. - What are you doing?<eos> - Oh, the door.<eos> When I was here before, I noticed that it needed work, and well, Nick is so busy and I thought maybe I'd come over and help out a little bit.
- Their plot.<eos> To concentrate the world's wealth and power and influence into private hands, to undermine the power of governments without arousing the ire of the people.<eos> Over the years, these conspirators evolved into five major multinational corporations.<eos> It took them five centuries, but they've finally succeeded.<eos> Even if all this is true, I don't see what it has to do with me.<eos> They've spent so much time trying to find you.<eos> You obviously pose some kind of a threat.<eos> I don't see how.<eos> Then you have no idea why they've tried to kill you?<eos> I had been hoping that you might be what I've been looking for all these years-- a way to expose them for what they are, a plague on civilization bent on destroying it to enrich themselves.
Your name is on the envelope... with 15 grams of Amphetamine in it.<eos> Breaking in to a guy's apartment... who imported 4 kilos of cocaine.<eos> We've run off from the police... runned over a guy and transferred 380.000 to Glenn's account.<eos> - I paid him in cash.<eos> - You put your name on the envelope.<eos> Chicken wings.<eos> That's where the money is.<eos> Put a sock in it.<eos> - How's your hand doing?<eos> - It's really pounding.
Over by an old line we don't use any more.<eos> It's an old, uh, mining spur.<eos> You see where he came from or went?<eos> No.<eos> He was just walking down the tracks.<eos> I got it.<eos> It's a map from 1945 showing all the old rail lines.<eos> This is the old rail station right there.<eos> This is the spur line he was talking about.<eos> It goes right up into the hills.
Ma'am, I'm afraid that's all we can do until something else happens.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, maybe we'll get lucky, and something else will happen.<eos> Honey, there's fresh coffee.<eos> You want me to put some in a travel mug?<eos> Okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> 30 days with the rehab hippies, and you've already forgotten how to tie a tie?<eos> I've just been thinking.<eos> I've worn a tie every day for 25 years, and I've always hated the way it feels around my neck.
Jia San involved in countless cases and escaped us every time.<eos> And despite the importance of this case, you gambled its success on three men.<eos> Finding Jia San was hard enough as is.<eos> If the Divine Constabulary hadn't ruined Brother Leng's plan, he would have caught Jia San.<eos> Give me your badge.<eos> Lord, this... This is the coin cast that was stolen.<eos> Put it back.<eos> My Lord, look again, it's...<eos> I've looked very carefully, and this is the coin cast we lost.<eos> But it's damaged, we can't use it.
It's a kind of necromancy from the west.<eos> You use potion and a needle to control the dead.<eos> If you sprinkle soulreaper orchid seeds on your opponent, the scent will make the avatar soldier attack until your opponent is dead.<eos> The scent?<eos> It's a shame Brother Leng isn't here, with his sense of smell.<eos> If we can't find the scent, let's look for the needle.<eos> Usually, these needles are inserted in a skull.<eos> Han Long turned to dust because you knocked the needle loose.<eos> Iron Hands, is soulreaper orchid easy to find?<eos> It's very rare.
What are you two doing?<eos> Department Six on official duty, out of the way.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> We're looking for a flower.<eos> I smelled it in the counterfeiting workshop.<eos> So Department Six is trying to steal our case again?<eos> Knock it off!<eos> Brother Leng is trying to solve the case for you.<eos> We're looking for a type of herb too, called soulreaper orchid.<eos> We think it was used to control Han Long. Then let's search the place!
Do we have a deal?<eos> Sir, posted online too.<eos> God damn it.<eos> Gentlemen, I wanted to present this redevelopment plan in person because of its tremendous scope.<eos> With all due respect, it's just not practical to move that quickly.<eos> Natural selection.<eos> We adapt or we die.<eos> Hired some out-of-state contractor who's supposed to do it all on the cheap.<eos> No one man is bigger than the machine.<eos> It corrects itself.
The flag, the letters, the infirmary -- a-are they making it up as they go along?<eos> The infirmary.<eos> Why do I know that?<eos> Where is it?<eos> Uh, all in good time. We made a deal -- the letters for the infirmary.<eos> The storage unit used to be an infirmary.<eos> I wonder why that's so important.<eos> Well, hopefully, we'll find out. If you won't hold up your end, I'll be going.<eos> Uh, t-the infirmary is downtown.<eos> I-it's now a facility known as Hester's Storage.
The child thrived...<eos> And one day, they reunited...<eos> And they all lived happily ever after.<eos> It's a really great story.<eos> That's all it is, Neal -- just a story...<eos> An 8-year-old tells himself to hide the fact that his parents didn't want him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know how hard it is to lose faith in your family.<eos> I pored over Woodhull's crime-scene photos yesterday when I finally noticed something.<eos> The tie around his neck -- it was loosened.
The coordinates are 61 centimeters by 99.<eos> You have three minutes to impress me.<eos> Good?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Missed 'em. They must be on their way to the flag.<eos> If they find it, Mozzie's a dead man.<eos> We don't have the coordinates. You think Mozzie left a clue?<eos> I know he did.<eos> It's just a matter of where.<eos> It's locked. Oh!
She's a personal shopper for the wealthiest of New York's wealthy.<eos> We think she's moved from personal shopping to personal thieving. It's smart angle.<eos> She doesn't need a fence because she already knows the buyers.<eos> Sounds like you got a crush.<eos> She's been linked to a couple of art heists in the past, but nothing ever sticks.<eos> We think she usually works alone, but today she had an accomplice.<eos> Looks like a hardened criminal to me.<eos> She paid him $20 to count to 20 and touch the art.<eos> She sees Neal Caffrey, art thief, wonders if her heist has gotten a little crowded. And she calls an audible.<eos> She's going to assume either you found the black box and disarmed it or the authorities did.
You should see the look in his eyes, El.<eos> I'm not looking to close this case.<eos> I just want to find a way to contact this Sam guy.<eos> Neal's in a unique position. He could reach out to him.<eos> He may be the only person that Sam could trust.<eos> Well... You'll figure it out.<eos> You always do.<eos> The crime-scene report is in a database on the 22nd floor.<eos> Now, somewhere in that file, there has to be a way to reach Sam.<eos> Hopefully it can tell us who killed Ellen and why. The security is good.

The security is good.<eos> I'm already looking for the blueprints for that building.<eos> I can't go in there with my anklet on. I shouldn't even be this close.<eos> But the suit's taken it off many times before.
This is my call.<eos> Alex could be here any minute, all right?<eos> We're supposed to be in this together.<eos> We are, Moz.<eos> Concierge dropped this off in my room.<eos> You know, a different girl might take offense that you marked this "return to sender."<eos> Well, a different guy might take offense that you got him arrested. I'd say we're even.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Not even close.<eos> Last time you gave me this flower, it represented our search for the music box.
Then let's go rob a museum.<eos> Hi.<eos> Um, I'm looking for the curator, miss Graham?<eos> She's right over here.<eos> Uh, I'm Parker Graham.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Yeah, we're here for gallery 2b.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> It's down the hall, second floor.<eos> Is it prepared?
Defense rested an hour ago.<eos> They obliterated Peter's testimony.<eos> Without hard proof the benzene existed, there is no way I can get a guilty verdict.<eos> What if we can get you that proof? What are you talking about?<eos> Shepard never destroyed Delancy's vial of benzene.<eos> She's holding it over his head.<eos> Why?<eos> The evidence against Mozzie, the pictures of you and Sara -- She holds on to everything.<eos> It's the only way she can control her client.<eos> Which means the vial is only good to her if it's well-preserved, complete with Delancy's fingerprints.
Really?<eos> A plant?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Any idea what you're looking for?<eos> Just a plant.<eos> Something planty.<eos> You're the expert.<eos> Well, why don't you tell me about your place?<eos> So I can get a better idea.<eos> It's a one bedroom on the water, lots of sunlight.
Or your right ear.<eos> What would you do if I broke up with you right now?<eos> We just moved into this overpriced apartment.<eos> - It would be strange timing, wouldn't it?<eos> - What would you do?<eos> - That's a stupid question Jessica.<eos> - What would you do?<eos> I might be glad to have some peace.<eos> I've waited for four years till you had lived long enough in your "all male flat share".<eos> I hunted for this place for the two of us so that our relationship could be as good as it used to be.
Go to the university.<eos> We need more, Walter, it's a big campus.<eos> What else can you see, dear?<eos> More brick buildings.<eos> Nothing specific.<eos> - Fan out.<eos> Non-lethal force only.<eos> - Agent Bates, with me.<eos> He's looking at his watch.<eos> No, it's a timer and it's counting down.
But we didn't stop anything.<eos> It's starting.<eos> Seismic activity in Tulsa, Vancouver, Florence, Bogota.<eos> The news are saying increased solar activity has caused fluctuations in the Earth's magnetic field.<eos> They're baffled by so many quakes happening at exactly the same time.<eos> How does David Robert Jones convince 27 Cortexiphan kids to help him destroy the world?<eos> I doubt that was the sales pitch.<eos> The tech in that watch isn't from here.<eos> Meaning our side.<eos> So it's safe to assume that Jones is the one that gave it to him.
Man, actually.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> Smart, noble, kind.<eos> All the things I would have wished for him.<eos> Would you excuse me for a moment?<eos> Overload at 15 percent.<eos> I know what you're afraid of.<eos> It occurs to me, so I'm sure it occurs to you too that if the machine stops working, Peter may disappear.<eos> I believe it may have brought him here.<eos> There's no reason it can't take him away.
The day you were infected, that was intentional.<eos> - You never had a daughter.<eos> - I hate kids.<eos> Now let's see how concerned you are about him.<eos> They can operate at hyper-attenuated time.<eos> To us, it almost looks like magic.<eos> It's not though.<eos> It's just tech that essentially lets them move very, very fast.<eos> Now, this gun is an invention of Dr. Bell's.<eos> It shoots faster.
Can you sit down?<eos> - I cannot.<eos> - Huh?<eos> It is impossible right now.<eos> We are in the warehouse.<eos> Hurry.<eos> EMTs are on the way.<eos> September, what is this thing?<eos> I am surprised they knew of this methodology.<eos> It is beyond them.
Ten<eos> Eleven is negative and five positive<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Well, that means there's a surplus of negative energy here<eos> And where is it from?<eos> The negative energy?<eos> Yes, the negative one Can we develop that a bit?<eos> The negative energy is concentrated in places where scenes with an excess of negative energy occurred in the past<eos> And Death<eos> It's actually separation of the energy from the substance from body After this separation it stays imprisoned on the place of this separation.
I'd say there are grounds for doubt.<eos> So, your car or mine?<eos> Neither.<eos> You had your chance.<eos> Mr Gaskin made it abundantly clear he doesn't want you anywhere near his factory.<eos> Which means you'll have to leave the investigating to the police.<eos> If you'll just look, I'll explain.<eos> It's not like you to be squeamish.<eos> See, there's blood all over the machine, all over the floor, all over these cartons. But there's none on the safety guard.<eos> Which means it was replaced afterwards.
And you must be Mr Butler!<eos> Pleased to meet you, Miss Fisher.<eos> Sorry. I forgot to telephone ahead about my extra guests.<eos> We've all been somewhat distracted by Eunice's mother's murder.<eos> A murder, miss?<eos> I do hope they chloroformed her first, but hanging's never pleasant. Keep your eye on this one.<eos> She's a stowaway, a thief and probably needs delousing.<eos> I expect the police will come looking for her, but you can just refer them to me.<eos> Oh, and while I remember, careful with the hand luggage.<eos> My pistol's in there somewhere, and it may still be loaded.
Leila?<eos> Curiouser and curiouser, said Alice.<eos> Alice who, Miss? I think we can assume we have the right Mrs Mobbs.<eos> Don't often get the chance to meet Leila's friends from the theatre.<eos> Don't know why Bart would put on Ruddigore again?<eos> You think it's cursed?<eos> No, just not very good.<eos> It's not exactly HMS Pinafore, is it?<eos> You were an actress?<eos> Oh, I flirted with the stage. It didn't return my affections.
Let's move onto the topic of Mr Leonard Stevens.<eos> You recall him - large, boorish, dead.<eos> Let's call a spade a spade.<eos> You wanna know if I killed him.<eos> Did you?<eos> Well, sure I did, and I'd do it again.<eos> Low-down dog deserved it.<eos> What did you do with the weapon?<eos> Smuggled it out in my garter.<eos> Honey, it was so far up my thigh, I would have slugged you if you even tried.
I think we're done here, aren't we?<eos> He lied to us about his target.<eos> So she's alive after all, huh?<eos> - What target?<eos> - Before your time.<eos> - What is he doing here?<eos> - I'm showing him the ropes.<eos> Michael has proven to be a top-notch operative so I'm putting him in charge of agent operations.<eos> Do you have a sidearm? - Yeah.<eos> - Give it to me.
Did you know that Schwiniak still plays?<eos> Times have changed, but he hasn't stopped.<eos> He just plays for another team.<eos> You know which one?<eos> What do I care?<eos> - Stubborn idiot, okay then...<eos> - Stop it, please.<eos> Shut your trap, don't ask me for nothing and listen, when I speak to you.<eos> I'm scared...<eos> Schwiniak's got a new team, guess what it's called.
Just tell me he's wrong.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Daniel, they're ready for you.<eos> So, Daniel, 48 hours ago, you were in jail facing a murder one charge.<eos> Now you're a free man.<eos> How you doing?<eos> A lot better than I was 48 hours ago.<eos> Just for the record, did you murder Tyler Barrol?<eos> Tyler threatened my whole family.<eos> We struggled for control of the gun, it went off, and...
- He with an evil man.<eos> Made him drink goat blood.<eos> That's what started all this mess to begin with.<eos> - Don Bartolo.<eos> - That's a bad man.<eos> That's a bad man.<eos> Mama, how do you know all this?<eos> I ain't got no fucking clue, baby.<eos> Electricity just runs through me.<eos> It always have.
You're not trying to win the Nobel.<eos> Okay. Thanks, Eli.<eos> Do you really get nostalgic about our time together?<eos> Good night, Eli.<eos> Here's your problem.<eos> To win, you need to prove two things:<eos> One, that my client knowingly sold the software to Syria-- a high bar in itself-- and two, that he knew that the software would be used to capture and kill protesters.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> You-you got the invoice in your hand?<eos> It was, uh, routed through, uh, Dubai.
We cannot talk any more.<eos> Do not call again.<eos> At least four people have been killed after army troops stormed the town of Talkalakh in western Syria.<eos> According to residents, the town is under lockdown with government security... ♪ And here to read the future ♪<eos> Burning the midnight oil even on your last day?<eos> I thought I could squeeze out one last billable hour.<eos> Any idea what you're gonna do?<eos> Maybe write a rock opera?<eos> There hasn't been a decent one since The Wall.<eos> I'm sure it'll be great.
Homie!<eos> We're here to find answers to your problem.<eos> We know there's a marriage in trouble, and it has something to do with fish.<eos> Oh, lighten up, Marge.<eos> I take you to the Disneyland of me, and you just want to go to the lost and found.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> We're staying in this dream forever.<eos> Wheeee! I'm in me!<eos> Oh, I love the down part!<eos> Here it comes! Whoo-hoo!
Yeah. I mean, the airlines confirmed they changed planes in London and arrived here in Boston.<eos> What do you think happened?<eos> We bring over a lot of young women here, detective, to make sure they have a chance at the American dream.<eos> Unfortunately, some do use Samaritan girl as a way to skirt immigration.<eos> Frankie's responding to a 911 call at Seth's coffee house.<eos> We should get over there.<eos> Thank you for your time.<eos> No problem.<eos> Oh, come on. You know you want some cake.<eos> It's delicious.
She saved you. She saved all of us.<eos> I... well...<eos> Uh, then why are we still here?<eos> That, my friend, is an excellent question.<eos> And what was that smoke?<eos> Who did this?<eos> - And what was that smoke?<eos> - And why?<eos> And what was that smoke?<eos> It's here.
My darling Belle.<eos> You have to tell me what happened to you.<eos> I was abducted.<eos> Regina.<eos> She locked me away into her curse, and I've been in the asylum ever since.<eos> For 28 years.<eos> All these years, you've been here, alive.<eos> Is... is that... is that why you did this?<eos> Why you wanted magic, for revenge?<eos> No, no, but it might come in handy.
Who am I speaking with?<eos> It is Peter who is calling from Denmark.<eos> - Hello, Peter.<eos> - Hey, Omar.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Fine, thanks.<eos> And you?<eos> Fine, thanks.<eos> Omar, I've talked with the board. I have a number for you.<eos> Yes, just come with it, please.
What's the other pile?<eos> Trash.<eos> You put Lamby in the trash?<eos> Lamby smells like pee.<eos> And Harrison hasn't slept with Lamby in more than a year.<eos> It used to be he couldn't go to sleep without it.<eos> Aw, I remember.<eos> Keep?<eos> Nah.<eos> Yeah, a lot of kids sleep with security blankets when they're little, but once they start socializing, you know, learning how to be part of a group, they don't need it.
Sure.<eos> I understand.<eos> You know, I like that Juliette.<eos> I hope we can finish that dinner sometime.<eos> Me too.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Bye.<eos> There's an eating disorder called pica.<eos> It usually involves consuming non-edible substances.
I'll never understand you people.<eos> You can't win.<eos> The world would be a much safer place if you'd just stop trying to fight them.<eos> What's Manfretti doing in Building 4?<eos> That's not his sector.<eos> Manfretti, come in. Over.<eos> Manfretti?<eos> Answer it.<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> Now answer it.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system, a machine that spies on you ever hour of every day.<eos> I know, because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
- I dusted twice.<eos> None on the tub, none on the body.<eos> Only other ones we found were the vic's and an Adam Saunders.<eos> We think he was having a relationship with the victim.<eos> His prints are all over the home and murder weapon.<eos> You mean the champagne bottle?<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Here.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Is there any chance, if Saunders was having a relationship with the vic, that he could have handled the champagne bottle, say, days ago, then had it planted?
Can you tell me your name? Boss! I need a trace on that call.<eos> A lad just rang on the incident number. Sounded like someone's kicking the shit out of him then the line went dead.<eos> Hello, is that the duty officer?<eos> We've just had a call on the public line about the Darren Rigby murder.<eos> I need to know where the number's come from and if it's a landline I need the location.<eos> - What did he say? - Nothing, he didn't have time.<eos> He said he knew something.<eos> He said it isn't just Nadia, it isn't Nadia's fault.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's a TK on the Hollingwood Estate, corner of Beech Avenue and Abercrombie.
Will, I just wanted to ask, um...<eos> I think they're putting the editor on next.<eos> You think it's an easy objection?<eos> Tyler v. Hasserbach.<eos> It's a cinch.<eos> Okay, thanks, bye.<eos> So, you edit this stuff together?<eos> - The film?<eos> - Yes, uh, with the director.<eos> We place the music where it is, and we also manipulate the images.
I believe in stem cells.<eos> That is our future.<eos> Good!<eos> Boos?<eos> Really?<eos> How gauche.<eos> - He's weird with you. - Ladies and gentlemen...<eos> Yep.<eos> ...My company has been mismanaged.<eos> It has seen seen its value drop by 30%...
- Excuse me,<eos> Your Honor, that is still unproven.<eos> Yes, but what is proven is that the DNA tying these girls to the body was bogus.<eos> - Again, Your Honor, an assertion.<eos> - Yes, but it's not looking good for you, is it, Mr. Agos?<eos> This is the fifth case I've had through here due to the malfeasance of the Illinois Crime Lab, and I've overturned all of them.<eos> But those four cases were built only on DNA.<eos> Here, there was physical evidence.<eos> The shoe prints of all three of these women - were found in the vicinity of the body.<eos> - 'Cause it was on a trail - that they used every day.
- Which is why the state's attorney's office should share in our anger at this injustice.<eos> They should be agitating for the immediate release of these women, not fighting against it. Okay.<eos> Thank you, everyone.<eos> You can sit down now.<eos> Given the egregious nature of these crime lab infractions, I have no choice other than to vacate these convictions.<eos> Your Honor, we would move for an immediate release.<eos> Mr. Agos, do you intend to proceed on the original charges?<eos> We do, Your Honor.<eos> And we would oppose bail.<eos> It was denied in the original trial, and we see no compelling reason for it to be granted now.
Did you introduce judges to bookies at your Wednesday night basketball...<eos> Objection, relevance.<eos> Isn't Judge Wynter relevant?<eos> The man who awarded you $25 million?<eos> Isn't he one of the judges you introduced to bookies? Objection.<eos> And weren't you confronted about this at the grand jury?<eos> Excuse me, Ms. Nyholm, you have referenced proceedings that resulted in a sealed transcript.<eos> Yes, but Mr. Gardner can answer to his own testimony.<eos> This question requires your knowledge of the grand jury investigation.<eos> No, it merely requires Mr. Gardner's knowledge of the grand jury investigation.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system--<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
The police are gonna be here in five minutes.<eos> I'm not gonna torture him because your fingerprints are on the weapon that killed Claudia.<eos> - Nicola, what did you do?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Did you hire the men that took Leila? Did you?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Call them.<eos> - I can't.<eos> The number doesn't work anymore.<eos> - Where'd you get it?
Can I quote you?<eos> - No.<eos> I want to remain anonymous.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> I didn't expect to find anything good on the Costa del Sol.<eos> Good.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> It's a profession, but I wouldn't do it the rest of my life.<eos> Photography is an art.<eos> It is more real than journalism. Newspapers retell other people's experiences.
For the moment, at least.<eos> But if you could, would you?<eos> I'll admit there was an attachment.<eos> But it was the disease.<eos> Now that I'm renewed, I see her role clearly.<eos> You know, I'm concerned that you're pushing too hard too fast.<eos> No.<eos> But what about you?<eos> With all that's gone on, we haven't even had the opportunity to talk about your treatment.<eos> You seem confident it was effective.
Timing could have been better.<eos> We barely made it one news cycle before the budget crisis became a bigger headline.<eos> True, but it's all of one piece... fall of the status quo, ascendency of new leadership.<eos> What can I do for you, Mr. Zajac?<eos> Double down.<eos> Help me further separate myself from Tom Kane by providing your full power of your field operations.<eos> Got to love a man with confidence.<eos> If he gets wind of this...<eos> In a few days, he's a nonissue.<eos> City goes broke, it'll be up for grabs.
As you can imagine, he's quite busy.<eos> And I do play a role.<eos> It's quite clear how much political power you have, Meredith.<eos> Mac.<eos> A fella could get used to this.<eos> Mac, this is John Vacarro. John, Mac Cullen.<eos> So, what's for lunch?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I'm not much of a gambler myself, but the track has proven to be a solid investment.<eos> People seem to enjoy it. Bought it several years ago.
And what did you do to the man who murdered your spouse?<eos> Nothing you wouldn't have done.<eos> Nothing I wouldn't do a thousand times over again.<eos> - Did it help?<eos> - She's still dead.<eos> I can see that Viktor meant a great deal to you but he was a killer and he got what he deserved.<eos> My wife was innocent.<eos> And if she weren't, you'd feel the same.<eos> That's how love is.<eos> It's a powerful weapon.

Love defies reason.<eos> Nothing defies reason.<eos> Logically, Viktor and I shouldn't have been together.<eos> I mean, aside from the obvious social stigma Viktor was impulsive, foolhardy even.<eos> Always out to prove something.<eos> I suppose the heart knows something that we just don't know.<eos> Or maybe the heart is just wrong.<eos> Oh, I doubt that.<eos> Love can be inconvenient, perhaps inappropriate.<eos> It can be dangerous.
Oh, you sound like Hannah.<eos> Maybe she's right.<eos> Maybe the Dark Passenger is just a feeling.<eos> - It can't be.<eos> - Why?<eos> Because if there's no Dark Passenger, then I'm responsible for everything I've done.<eos> It sure is simpler to just pin all the blame on something else, isn't it, Dexter?<eos> It's much scarier to think that the Dark Passenger is no more real than I am.<eos> - This is where the cabin used to be.<eos> - Yeah before it got blown to smithereens.
You're family.<eos> You need to recuse yourself.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Angel.<eos> - I'm on it.<eos> Just so we're clear then...<eos> Your official statement is that you went fishing last night and then went straight home to be with your son.<eos> I didn't kill Hector Estrada.<eos> No.<eos> You didn't cut his body into pieces and put it into bags, take it on your boat, and then throw it into the ocean?
Whoever did this-- was making a fucking point.<eos> This is our third vic.<eos> Any suspects?<eos> Walter Munro.<eos> Fucker's crazy.<eos> Thinks he's some kind of philosopher or some shit.<eos> Always scribbling his fucked up thoughts in his journals.<eos> Hmm, the victims are all prostitutes.<eos> The wounds suggest the same weapon.<eos> It is consistent with a single killer.
I'll be there.<eos> 1,500 ccs, supercharged...<eos> Shit!<eos> Seward Memorial Hospital, now!<eos> She's having some sort of seizure.<eos> She seems stable.<eos> We're bringing her into Seward Memorial emergency right now.<eos> We'd better contact her next of kin.<eos> Hang on, sweetheart.<eos> Go ahead and get her an MRI, make sure it's with contrast.
Debra... we've known each other a long time.<eos> Is there something you wanna get off your chest?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think you've been under a lot of stress.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think I'm not the only one who made a mistake trying to protect someone they care about.<eos> Is there anything else, Captain?<eos> Not for now.<eos> But this is just the start of a much larger conversation.<eos> Count on it.
LaGuerta's house.<eos> What is it you're hoping to find, Dexter?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Not this.<eos> Warrants.<eos> With a judge's signature... allowing LaGuerta to track the GPS on my phone and Debra's the night the church burned down.<eos> Once this warrant goes through, LaGuerta will have a timeline for the night I killed Travis Marshall.<eos> She'll know that Debra went to the church, then the gas station.<eos> And then back to the church...<eos> Proving that we both were at the church when it burned down, and proving that Deb was my accomplice.
No.<eos> So shut the fuck up.<eos> Nadia's in Vegas. Vegas?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She moved there to work.<eos> Got a job in one of the casinos.<eos> - When?<eos> - Couple days ago.<eos> She left you a note.<eos> It's in my locker.
Can't we work out our issues?<eos> I think we can.<eos> It's because I love Dexter that I'm willing to do whatever it takes to protect him from you.<eos> I'm not gonna give up until your murdering ass is behind bars for good.<eos> That's how we're gonna work out our issues.<eos> But, hey... thanks for stopping by.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - You got a dead one.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, it's gonna have to stay dead.
Los, Bart, tell some games!<eos> I told you that you shalt behave in my district!<eos> You are here just for a visit.<eos> And such as Kotzbrocken we need you here!<eos> Way there, I'm going!<eos> Have you gone mad?<eos> Jeez, who is still alive.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - The fat sausage I'm floored!<eos> Are you got rid of it?
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system--<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
When can you spare me an hour, Detective?<eos> I've got something to show you.<eos> Can I give you a hand with that?<eos> - Oh, thank you.<eos> - There you are.<eos> I'm taking a look at this third apartment, Finch.<eos> Look for anything that might point to which Hester it belongs to.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> We need to find out where the threat's coming from.<eos> Don't know which Hester it belongs to, but I got an idea what they're mixed up in. I'm standing in the middle of an MDMA lab.
"Trust your instincts," the boss says.<eos> I'll get a plane back tomorrow from Dallas.<eos> See you later.<eos> [Spanish accent] Move away from the door.<eos> What do you want'?<eos> Where's the map'?<eos> [Exhales deeply] Under the sideboard.<eos> Get it.<eos> And the money.<eos> Take it out.
Let me have a look.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Here they are!<eos> The beautiful Amanas Caves. The birth place of the Trolls.<eos> Did Trolls live here?<eos> They're long gone.<eos> These caves have been empty ever since the Snow Queen spread her cold ambition and ruled the world.<eos> Her existence alone influenced two great kings from the Troll brotherhood making them turn against each other.<eos> Their desire for power was so great that it consumed their hearts and led to a merciless war like never seen before. Leaving no winners to speak of.
It's not just the money.<eos> He wants you back.<eos> - Where is he? - Home.<eos> He sent me here to...<eos> Don't, Bill.<eos> - It's a phone.<eos> I'm just getting you...<eos> - You pull it out, and I'll shoot your hand off.<eos> Get down on your knees.<eos> And keep your hand where it is.
I have lingerie and flavored body paint... oh, there is a God.<eos> Okay, ready?<eos> On my count. One, two... Three.<eos> Again.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Lexie, run it down for me.<eos> My legs and my pelvis are crushed.<eos> And I can't f-feel my other arm, so I'm not sure it's even there anymore.<eos> And, uh, my chest feels like it's gonna explode, so it's probably a massive... hemothorax.
There's a transmitter in the plane that lets out a squawk that should lead 'em right to us.<eos> Did you find Derek?<eos> Uh, not yet.<eos> Uh, Jerry, uh, do you, uh, have any tape?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> In the bulkhead.<eos> In the cabinet to your left.<eos> There's a flare gun in there, too.<eos> Yes.<eos> You hear a chopper, you fire it straight up.
Hey!<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Eating.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You have a dinner tonight.<eos> The... the biggest dinner of your lives.<eos> Here's the thing, I can't eat duck.<eos> I had a duck on the farm.<eos> It lived in the house.
I don't see it.<eos> Help!<eos> Get the flare gun!<eos> The flare gun!<eos> In the bag!<eos> In the bag!<eos> Oh, God, shoot it!<eos> We're down here!<eos> Come back!<eos> Why isn't it working?
The flare gun!<eos> In the bag!<eos> In the bag!<eos> Oh, God, shoot it!<eos> We're down here!<eos> Come back!<eos> Why isn't it working?<eos> Shoot it again!<eos> Shoot it again!<eos> Give it to me.
I had them followed.<eos> They've been meeting in secret.<eos> I think Biau double-crossed us.<eos> His loyalties are still with the authority.<eos> Deal with the problem.<eos> And find what belongs to us, Paul.<eos> Nothing is more important.<eos> A change of plan.<eos> I have decided to bring forward the initiation ceremony.<eos> It will be tomorrow.
Come on, Maura, think.<eos> There's got to be a way to get those texts back.<eos> I told you... there isn't.<eos> Would you like some quinoa, kale, and yam?<eos> Sure, when I'm a contestant on "survivor."<eos> Oh, thank goodness. Look, Frankie brought us some mad dog 20/20 to go with our yams.<eos> [ Breathless ] I found it.<eos> You found the gun!<eos> Yeah.<eos> It was in a storm drain a block and a half north.
Jane! Okay, I'm gonna walk away from here, and no one will ever find you.<eos> I did it!<eos> Yeah, I-I killed Antonio.<eos> You locked him in that box and you left him to die. I did.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.<eos> Please.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> You must have kept a trophy.<eos> Where is it?
There's a little dog right here on his shirt. Not a cute dog.<eos> Like, you know... a snarling dog.<eos> Like a bulldog or a wolf? Wolf!<eos> Grape Street Lobos wear black shirts with a wolf on 'em.<eos> Thank you, Miss Bean. Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah, so it's kind of thin, but my guys'll check out the Lobos, and we'll let you know.<eos> Well, we can check 'em out for you, if you'd like.<eos> CBI gang unit has a really good database. That's okay, girls.<eos> Thanks, but we don't even know if it's the same gun as yours.<eos> It probably isn't. Yeah, okay, Rupe.
- I just never got caught.<eos> - Ahh. Touche.<eos> It has come... to my... attention that Mr. Jane here performed an act of vandalism into the second floor boy's restroom.<eos> A vicious, personal attack on me.<eos> It's true.<eos> Sir, on behalf of the CBI, I apologize.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> I'm sorry for the senseless act of graffiti.<eos> Very well.<eos> I will send a bill to CBI which will cover the cost of cleaning, and I would ask that as we move forward with this investigation, it is conducted without Mr. Jane on site.
Oh, you look like you're coming from a wedding.<eos> Was it a nice one?
It all started when the bride asked to see me...<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay, don't sugarcoat it, Mosby.<eos> Just give it to me straight, okay?<eos> How bad is Barney freaking out right now?<eos> Oh, he's fine.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> He's totally fine.<eos> I have a better tie at home!<eos> It's cornflower blue!

Will it be quick and final or slow and, well, without end?<eos> If someone had the good sense to kill my brain or will I come back as one of them?<eos> Do you think they remember anything?<eos> The person they once were?<eos> I don't think about it.<eos> Milton believes there might be a trace of the person they were still trapped inside.<eos> Like an echo.<eos> Surely it must have crossed your mind.<eos> At one time, yeah.<eos> Right before it tried to bite me.
There are walkers outside.<eos> - I'll call the cops!<eos> - I am a cop.<eos> Now I need you to lower the gun.<eos> Don't do anything rash.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Let's just... let's just take this nice and slow, okay? Look at me.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> Show me your badge. All right.<eos> It's in my pocket.

I didn't call first.<eos> I thought you'd be back.<eos> I was expecting you.<eos> I even prepared two glasses.<eos> I'm no good at reading the future. They've been here for a month.<eos> Mind if I talk to you?<eos> My problem is since the last time, I want you to talk.<eos> Still come from the future?<eos> To the future.<eos> What's it like?
I want to file for emancipation.<eos> So you're telling me you don't have it?<eos> I don't, but I'm sure it'll turn up.<eos> You sure?<eos> Your job was to keep track of that one thing.<eos> Nice work.<eos> It's a birthday card for Norma.<eos> She won't even tell us how old she is.<eos> Her birthday is today.<eos> When do you think it's going to turn up?
It betrays me.<eos> Betrays you?<eos> If I had told you the truth--<eos> You don't keep things from me!<eos> You keep things from me all the time!<eos> That's because I'm your boss.<eos> Well, maybe you shouldn't be my boss anymore.<eos> I did what I thought I had to do for you, and if you can't... just fire me.<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> That memo doesn't hurt me. It helps me.
Let me explain something to you.<eos> That memo doesn't hurt me. It helps me.<eos> If I had buried it, we wouldn't have it.<eos> But you found it, so that's a good thing.<eos> What?<eos> Wh-what'd you do?<eos> Oh, what did you do?<eos> Allison had that freaking camera, and I was-- she implied that we were--<eos> What did you do?<eos> It's gone.
There's just something I'd like to say, if that's all right.<eos> We've been through some hard times. And I want Uncle Nucky to know we're grateful for all that he's done for us.<eos> We're grateful to have him back at our table after so long.<eos> We're grateful to meet Margaret at last, who is so lovely, and we welcome her and Teddy and Emily to our family.<eos> What I love about spring, how everything starts growing again<eos> when it's all been so gray.<eos> And for this to be the day that all of us...<eos> Look at me now.<eos> Beautiful words.<eos> Eat your soup before it gets cold.
You're taking me to her, right?<eos> This isn't about Katya.<eos> But it couldn't wait any longer.<eos> Who did this?<eos> - It must've been MI-6.<eos> - Why Oleg?<eos> He wasn't the target.<eos> At least that's what the story was going to be.<eos> Correction.<eos> What it's still going to be.
So, Stuart...<eos> You got quiet all of a sudden.<eos> Well, there's not much to say, is there?<eos> It always amazes me what people keep to themselves, don't you think?<eos> I was supposed to die, wasn't I?<eos> That guy I was following, he was no courier...<eos> Stuart, I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You damn well know!<eos> So does control. She's Gogol.<eos> Just because the mission failed doesn't mean it was compromised.
So he got through to them.<eos> All right, trigger the chip.<eos> Isolating frequency.<eos> What happened?<eos> They must have gone underground.<eos> Stephen, flush 'em to the surface.<eos> The chip can't be triggered down here.<eos> So Ryan told you everything.<eos> I figured my message was a long shot.<eos> It got heard.
== sync, corrected by elderman ==<eos> ♪<eos> Checking in, sir?<eos> No, just visiting.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Bianca, it's Jimmy.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> What's with the gun?<eos> I got some trust issues right now.<eos> Well, give it to me or I'm out of here.
Okay, are they bigger than a bread box?<eos> Come on, Melanie, help us here.<eos> Detective... in the safe in the closet there is a Walther PPK that I am licensed to carry in 48 states, including this one.<eos> I will not leave this hotel without that gun in my purse for the rest of my stay.<eos> Wow, case closed.<eos> Oh, Frank.<eos> I'm not trying to be cavalier... but I am not going to give up my source.<eos> How about stalkers, threatening mail?<eos> My producer keeps a file on all the cranks and the, the creeps.<eos> It's up to date and he will give you all of that.
It's kind of complicated.<eos> There's a man here.<eos> He's like a civil rights activist, slash... I don't know...<eos> Freedom fighter.<eos> With a bullet wound.<eos> Yeah, I'll be right there.<eos> - How is your day?<eos> - Where are you?<eos> I'm enjoying your city.<eos> It's really quite nice.

It's a boot.<eos> I bought a boot.<eos> You bought... one boot?<eos> Yep. 'Cause I'm frugal.<eos> One day I'll buy the other one.<eos> That's all you bought?<eos> Because I got a call from the bank.<eos> Seems somebody was going crazy with your credit card.<eos> Huh.<eos> Maybe it was stolen.
I think mostly 'cause she sees me as her friend.<eos> So you thought you'd exploit that... invite a lonely widow to dinner, pretend she's your friend, just to make money off of her.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Gaby, can't I just take my plate upstairs?<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> You're exhausted? I had to watch a 20 minute iPhone video of her cat taking a nap in a laundry basket just to sell her a coat.<eos> Now get out there, lose your top button, and look pretty.<eos> Doris, I can't get over how lovely that jacket looks on you.<eos> Isn't it lovely, Carlos?<eos> Yeah, it's great.
Whole side of the family is fuckin' yammerers.<eos> Tell me about these waves.<eos> - Well, actually...<eos> - He don't know shit.<eos> Worked on my uncle's fishing boat when he was a kid, so he thinks he knows...<eos> Say what you're gonna say.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's just sometimes when the wind shifts, waves crash into each other from different directions.<eos> And when they do, they make giant waves.<eos> It's easy to lose cargo if it's not strapped down.
Tell me everything you know about O'Banion's operation.<eos> Jess!<eos> You're awake at an unsettled hour.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The Attorney General was detained by the burdens of state.<eos> Nonetheless, he expressed concern regarding your well-being and...<eos> You're holding a gun. Yes.<eos> Yes, indeed, I am.<eos> I routinely carry a firearm in the course of my manifold duties.<eos> "But why is it unsheathed," you may well ask, "in the confines of the Park Wardman Hotel?" Well, now...
This was why I didn't let you go.<eos> I am your father.<eos> If I can't protect you, stay behind you what kind of father am I?<eos> You are my first-born.<eos> Maybe that's why we are holding us so dear.<eos> You used to fall on your knees, you know?<eos> Then you came with the ointment and wanted me to apply it.<eos> And after I applied it I had to blow for minutes.<eos> One night you were in the garden with your mother and saw a falling star.<eos> You started to cry saying that it would fall on me.
She was always here.<eos> I was scared of my dad, I couldn't tell you.<eos> I found this paper in her hands the other day.<eos> She wrote it to you but forget to send it.<eos> My love my one and only.<eos> I wanted to write you before my mind leaves me again.<eos> I feel better today.<eos> Or I think that I do.<eos> The swing door we met with you the billiard saloon the stories you told me, your look, your smell, your anger I remember everything.<eos> Speaking of your anger don't lose it, that's the only thing that makes you strong.
Everybody, listen up.<eos> NSA intercepted a phone call between Vaziri and Tehran overnight.<eos> Vaziri told Tehran that an NCIS agent confirmed Cherokee's identity.<eos> The CIA is demanding Callen's immediate arrest.<eos> Are we going to comply?<eos> Since when do we work for the CIA?<eos> No way we're doing this.<eos> Look, we don't have a say in this.<eos> The call came directly from SECNAV<eos> You want to help Callen, you want to help us, get Atley's file, make sure it gets into the right hands.
Upstairs.<eos> Who?<eos> David.<eos> David?<eos> Can you tell me what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I didn't do anything.<eos> Nothing.<eos> What happened to your nose, mate?<eos> It started bleeding, like it always does.
No, save it for dessert. Idiot.<eos> Uh, ah... More red wine, beauty-swan?<eos> She drinks a lot.<eos> Is it okay if I go pee, sugar lamb? No!<eos> You just went three hours ago.<eos> You're right, baby bear!<eos> Yes, so Barney's whipped; it doesn't mean that Quinn is a con artist.<eos> Well, maybe we could've gotten a better read on her if two people hadn't gone off topic.<eos> By the way, Quinn, your apartment is amazing.<eos> Oh, yeah, it's beautiful.
I've seen your purse. I can only imagine your taxes.<eos> Can you let go of the purse?<eos> It's just a messy bag.<eos> It's not like I lost your child in the outback.<eos> It's symptomatic.<eos> Here, look at my purse.<eos> You know what, never mind.<eos> It's too late for a purse smackdown.<eos> But for the record, even if you win now, my purse will kick your purse's ass.<eos> Later, after it spent two weeks learning your purse's schedule.
But I love you.<eos> And you love sports.<eos> So I've started to really get into it.<eos> Really?<eos> What's your favorite basketball team?<eos> The Turtles.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> It's nothing.<eos> You said the trial was going well.<eos> It was.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system--<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
These gentlemen meet once a month at the Covenant Club in Brooklyn.<eos> There are no cameras allowed inside the private meeting room, and no cell phones.<eos> Not gonna be easy to spy on these guys.<eos> Not even for you, Finch.<eos> That sounds like a challenge, Mr. Reese.<eos> The club recently installed a new fire alarm system.<eos> In case of emergency, fire fighters could communicate with anyone trapped inside through a sound system.<eos> But any speaker can be converted to a crude microphone by reversing polarity.<eos> Those idiots from the Department of Homeland Security, they can't even take a bribe right.<eos> That shipment was half of what it was supposed to be.
This is supposed to be our weekend!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> Last night, she said,<eos> "Why don't we go out for brunch tomorrow and then maybe the Arboretum." And I said, "Well, no,<eos> "I promised the guys I was going to play a video game with them all weekend."<eos> And she said, "That sounds like fun.<eos> Can I come, too?" And then I didn't answer for a second, and then she said, "Well, do you not want me to come?"<eos> And then I bought her a new laptop and the game, and she's parking the car right now.<eos> Is the whip sound app contextually appropriate here?<eos> Uh, it is, but I think you might've waited too long for it to be funny.
Let's divide up the loot.<eos> Ooh, look at this pretty purple robe I just got.<eos> You should put on yours and then we'll match.<eos> But I worked hard to get this armor.<eos> Sorry, I just thought it'd be nice if people knew we were a couple.<eos> Fine, I'll change.<eos> I don't think I want to play a game.<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> They're playing one across the hall-- we should, too.<eos> Okay, we are gonna take turns bouncing a quarter off the table, and if it goes into this cup, the other person has to drink.
It's the first birthday party for the son of a socialite.<eos> 60 cupcakes with buttercream frosting. Up top.<eos> Buttercream?<eos> This is not the response I was expecting from my business partner.<eos> I was expecting wooo! Awesome job! Thumbs up, buddy.<eos> Why?<eos> Is your business partner on a show of Nicklodeon?<eos> Look I don't do buttercream.<eos> Buttercream is a bitch.<eos> If it doesn't stay refrigerated, it falls apart as fast as a two-celebrity marriage.
There can't be a gap.<eos> Why is there a gap?<eos> Because people need reasonably price basics.<eos> I'm gonna hop across and help the rest of you over.<eos> Hey miss, you are next.<eos> I put the line on, just grab it.<eos> You know how many times I heard that from a guy in the tunnel?<eos> Hey, just take these.<eos> Careful, sir, it's buttercream!<eos> I'm throwing you my purse. Here it comes.
In October 2008 SoundCloud launched their product after being in private beta for more than a year.<eos> When we decided to open the site for the public, we thought, well we are in Berlin, so the right way to do that is at a club, so we actually threw a launch party at a club that our friends<eos> have called Picnic.<eos> We actually launched at twelve o'clock at night at the club, like, we had Sean, our chief architect was sitting upstairs in a small room with a laptop deploying the site and we were like, Eric and I were behind the DJ desk<eos> launching the site on the dance floor and we were just like okay, it's going to crash, it's going to crash, but it survived it survived the whole night and the morning after, I was a bit<eos> tired but, first thing, when we woke up, were just like, is the site online and it was online.<eos> We started seeing, we had sign-ups through the night and from there on we were open and full on.<eos> Alexander drew attention to his company in a creative way. It involved a leather jacket and some spray-paint.<eos> Every time I was doing a talk at a conference I made sure that I had some point in the talk were I could turn around so that people could see this jacket, the back of it.<eos> It's good, like, there was pictures of this jacket, all over the web and people were talking about it because it looked kind of cool and I know so many investors that remember that jacket so that was actually a good thing for us to, you know, to get the
So robbery interviewed a guy named Marco Vinstrolli.<eos> His van got a parking ticket around the corner the night that Angelica's bracelet was stolen.<eos> Now they found nothing to connect him, but... Look familiar?<eos> That's our guy.<eos> The storage manager said that he rented Marco a unit on the same floor the day before the auction.<eos> So I-I reviewed their surveillance tapes.<eos> This is from 6:00 A.M. yesterday morning.<eos> Five hours before the auction.<eos> He broke into my storage unit.<eos> Well, it's... it was Wendell's at the time, but now it's mine.
Kirby.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> Your live-in butler caused a car accident and then fled the scene.<eos> Because he did, two people lost their lives.<eos> And those people were Wendell's parents.<eos> That is...<eos> Absolutely ridiculous.<eos> You can't prove any of it.<eos> Your D.N.A. was on the prosthetic eye that Wendell stole.<eos> And it's a match to the D.N.A. found on the shell casing in Wendy's hotel room.
Let's tilt her sideways first.<eos> I cannot believe you can smell decomp in bronze.<eos> Well, it's a heavy particulate odor detectable by some animals for miles.<eos> Looks like the Venus de Milo.<eos> I've been to the Louvre, Dr. Snob.<eos> No! Oh!<eos> It's not bronze. It's plaster.<eos> She's very cool.<eos> A dead woman masquerading as a statue is cool?<eos> No, the body ... it's cold, and it's exhibiting signs of delayed decomposition.
What you gonna do about it?" [ laughs ]<eos> Did, uh, Cruella have any regulars?<eos> Oh, child, she was lucky to make enough just to feed that fix of hers.<eos> Got a name ... Rachel Dugan, 54 years old.<eos> You sure you can't remember the last time you saw her?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I saw her 'bout three months ago.<eos> I remember because I had just bought this wig here.<eos> Ooh, it's kind of shedding.<eos> But, uh, how you like it?
I never thought I'd say this, But I want to get with that goat girl.<eos> Really?<eos> She bailed on me To go to some pretentious hipster bar with no sign? That's right.<eos> Use that anger.<eos> And you know they're selling $15 cocktails served in mason jars.<eos> And sure, they'll be delicious, But will that justify the terrible service?<eos> I mean, maybe, If they're making their own juices and simple syrups.<eos> Kinda losing the anger here.<eos> But they probably aren't!<eos> And it's back!
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system--<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything...
- You know that, right?<eos> - I'd rather do a good show for 100 people than a bad one for a million, if that's what you're saying.<eos> What is it you're talking to me about right now?<eos> I've come here to produce a news broadcast that more closely resembles the one we did before you got popular by not bothering anyone, Leno.<eos> I think Jay and I would rather be employed if it's all the same to you.<eos> It's not all the same to me, you punk.<eos> I've come here to take your IQ and your talent and put it to some patriotic fucking use.<eos> And where does it say that a good news show can't be popular?<eos> - Nielsen ratings.<eos> - We're going to do a good news show and make it popular at the same time.
- We are trying to gather information... - Sir, please. Please!<eos> ...as quickly as possible.<eos> It isn't easy while we're being hounded.<eos> - Let's just take a breath.<eos> - I'm breathing fine.<eos> Zoneseal 2000.<eos> Your company was hired to provide Zoneseal 2000 and SCR-100, a synthetic, cement-like substance meant to seal off the well, yes or no?<eos> - Yes, we were, but now you're saying...<eos> - That's all I was saying.<eos> Now I'm asking if your company did tests on the substance before installing it at the base of Deepwater Horizon.
- Yup, I'll pick it up tomorrow.<eos> Well, how will you get the P76 back?<eos> I'll get Burkey!<eos> Or someone to take me down there. I could always take you, love.<eos> It's all good, Nancy.<eos> It's all good.<eos> So they can stitch 'em back on, yeah? Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Bob Clay up on Jacaranda Crest he chopped his hand off, digging fence posts about ten years ago.<eos> Brave little bugger walked about 20 clicks before anyone found him.<eos> But you know what? They located his hand, they put it in a Esky, choppered him off to the city.
Say the wrong thing, and you're pulling double shifts or worse.<eos> I know this sounds petty, but there's something off here.<eos> You mean like how they've assigned an experienced combat surgeon to pediatrics?<eos> I'm not saying it isn't important.<eos> With the 2nd Mass, I was doing vital medicine, saving lives.<eos> Suddenly, I'm back to passing out aspirin now?<eos> Taking temperatures?<eos> It's almost as if they really believe the aliens have disappeared.<eos> I used to ache for that sense of complacency.<eos> Now it almost scares me.
I think he would be proud of you.<eos> Levkin's a good choice.<eos> Definitely better than the last one.<eos> We'll leave first thing in the morning.<eos> Put as much distance between us and Gogol as we can.<eos> And go where?<eos> It's not just Gogol hunting us, and we're seriously outgunned.<eos> Perhaps.<eos> But while I was out, I managed to retrieve a very powerful weapon.<eos> Is it decrypted?
I remembered something...<eos> About that night.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's all you remember?<eos> I found out online that some people forget things because they don't want to remember.<eos> And if this is selective, then anything can trigger it... sights, smells, sounds.<eos> So the car that you saw, it just looked like the car from that night, or it was the car?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I started to talk towards it because I wanted to look inside, but... I got a text.<eos> And the person that sent it to me knows I don't remember what happened.
Big Brother help me<eos> We can't let you bring disaster upon the whole village<eos> Brother-in-law your hat<eos> Chen-style kung fu can't be taught to outsiders<eos> That's why only the Chen's may practice it<eos> I am not interested<eos> You can go a few rounds with them if you like<eos> This bell has been here for over a century<eos> We call it the Bronze Bell<eos> It's meant for practicing kung fu but I've never seen them use it
- I'm in.<eos> I'll see you on Monday.<eos> - Are you still gonna worry about the ratings? - Yes.<eos> - Still gonna worry about being popular?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> About being loved by strangers?<eos> Are you gonna keep asking me questions that all mean the same thing?<eos> Till I get the right answer.<eos> I'm in.<eos> There it is.
Know how much I worried!<eos> Why didn't you take your phone!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you<eos> I have a favor.<eos> Plant me a tree.<eos> Where's the sweater?<eos> I wanna wear it today.<eos> Can a pine tree live by the water?<eos> It'll live.
Well, look. You had the pack in your pocket of your jacket, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - And your jacket was in your locker, so maybe the cigarette just fell out of the pocket and wound up in the locker, and now it's all burned up.<eos> - It's gone.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I don't know that, you know?<eos> I can't ever know for sure.<eos> Well, look, did you check your house?<eos> Did you-<eos> - Maybe it's somewhere in your house.
Mr. White?<eos> The methylamine keeps flowing, no matter what.<eos> We are not ramping down.<eos> We're just getting started.<eos> Nothing stops this train.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Hey, yo, Mr. White.<eos> Hold up.<eos> I just wanted to say I liked your idea.<eos> You know, it's pretty, uh...
Do you want a coffee or something?<eos> Not just now.<eos> I think this would play better if you ordered something.<eos> I think this will play just fine, and I'm not thirsty.<eos> So let's take a look at the list.<eos> Lydia, you've come all this way.<eos> - You do have the list?<eos> - Yes, I have it.<eos> Good.<eos> It's just not written down.
Those were the ones.<eos> You can play around with it and take them in and out...<eos> Not enough hours in the day, right?<eos> - Not enough hours...<eos> - My hairstylist told me to take prenatal vitamins.<eos> For your hair?<eos> He said they work, so I figure why not?<eos> Oh, uh, Flynn, could you put some more sunscreen on Holly?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Is it over there?
What is this place?<eos> Welcome to special projects.<eos> Mac's going to be our new field operative.<eos> What?<eos> What about Drake?<eos> We need someone full time.<eos> That anomaly in the park, it opened again last night.<eos> That's three times in a week.<eos> Mm-hmm, but here's the weird part...<eos> It keeps on appearing in slightly different locations.
Was there a fire?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did I put it out?<eos> That's not- Answer the question.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm getting an award for it.<eos> If they gave awards for starting fires, I'd be getting one of those too.<eos> I know you have a conscience, Luke.<eos> Do you see this flag?<eos> It stands for justice.
- One last thing.<eos> - Anything.<eos> - And I need the truth.<eos> - You bet.<eos> Did Mom really leave you or did you trade her to that guy in Tampa for a belt sander?<eos> No, actually, it was a leaf blower.<eos> Don't get too hard on yourself.<eos> Your dad fooled us both.<eos> I think it's really sweet that you're getting him his own place out here.<eos> Yeah, it's in a really nice area.
Truth be told, we can do a lot better.<eos> This isn't about Norma.<eos> Pray tell. How can your your newest junior partner be of service to thee?<eos> Pray tell?<eos> You can pray tell me how the hell you got the nerve to stand in front of my face after what you did.<eos> I couldn't help it.<eos> All those late nights.<eos> Your fibers are so tantalizing.<eos> What?<eos> I fell asleep on your couch, just once, because it's so damn soft.
I gave you a job to do, and you promptly asked for a seat at the table.<eos> You want to sit with the grown-ups?<eos> Do your job like a man.<eos> Ouch.<eos> What?<eos> You need me to remove Jessica's foot from your ass?<eos> You heard all that?<eos> Intercom was on.<eos> Couldn't help myself.<eos> Has it ever been on before?

Thanks, Rachel.<eos> I'll be out in five, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Donna.<eos> Donna.<eos> Donna!<eos> I'm sorry, but apparently Paul Porter doesn't believe in technology.<eos> Look, I need the employment survey.<eos> Yeah, I'm working on it.<eos> It's not done?
You planned this whole thing from the beginning, didn't you?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You got Hanson that job at justice.<eos> It was a loss for us, but a gain for justice, don't you think?<eos> And making Louis Litt a senior partner behind my back.<eos> Is that all part of the new Daniel Hardman era of transparency?<eos> It's within my rights according to the bylaws you wrote.<eos> Ah, yes, and how much did buying his vote cost you?<eos> Cost me?<eos> It was earned years ago.
Are you thinking about moving?<eos> Uh, no, actually I was looking into getting a place in Manhattan for my lunch lady.<eos> - You'd really do that for her?<eos> - I am doing it.<eos> It doesn't even come close to paying her back for everything she's done for me.<eos> That's, um... that's really amazing, Mike.<eos> You wanna know what's amazing?<eos> - What?<eos> - This place.<eos> Right here, check it out.
Forget the source.<eos> We need to figure out how Solis passed those tests.<eos> How are we supposed to do that?<eos> Not us, you.<eos> I'm like Zielinski, you're like Solis.<eos> - An all-star.<eos> - A cheater.<eos> You're not gonna tell the bar association that I deserve an asterisk, are you?<eos> You just gave me a good idea.<eos> I hope it doesn't involve you telling the bar association that I deserve an asterisk.
To dinner?<eos> - I was just gonna wear pajamas.<eos> - To Walter's stock auction.<eos> - I think I rather be grounded.<eos> - No, it's important that you come.<eos> Important to whom?<eos> To me.<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> When you were 4 years old, you came home one day with a cat.<eos> It was a stray, it was filthy and it was mean.

your mind games. {\3cH202020}it's not working.<eos> very careful if I were you.<eos> {\3cH202020}Or what?<eos> {\3cH202020}Are you gonna hit me again?<eos> {\3cH202020}Does that make you feel tough?<eos> {\3cH202020}Beating up an 18-year-old kid?<eos> {\3cH202020}What's that say about you?<eos> Rob.<eos> You think that maybe you could {\3cH202020}keep your music down at night?<eos> {\3cH202020}It-- it keeps my son awake.
Those are but a few of the reactions to the return of the Batman.<eos> Tonight, we'll examine his impact on our society.<eos> From Metropolis, managing editor of The Daily Planet, Lana Lang.<eos> And from Gotham City, popular psychologist and author of the best-seller, Hey, I'm Okay, Dr. Bartholomew Wolper.<eos> Dr. Wolper, you've claimed the Batman is responsible for inciting the crimes he fights.<eos> Yet, crime in Gotham has dropped steadily since his return.<eos> - Explain.<eos> - I'm glad you asked that, Ted.<eos> Picture the public psyche as a vast, moist, membrane.<eos> Batman has struck this membrane a vicious blow, and it has recoiled.
You done everything you could.<eos> For a moment, I felt... relief that he might not live.<eos> You yourself would be free... from your debt to the railroad.<eos> He ain't dead yet.<eos> I should... telegraph his... wife. She should know.<eos> He needs a more qualified surgeon, ma'am, not some battlefield sawbones like me.<eos> If I'd run across him like this in the war, I'd have moved on to the next man.<eos> You best do everything in your power to keep him alive.<eos> He needs to be opened up, Cullen.<eos> That bullet ripped up his insides. It's lodged against his spine.
I ain't never figured you for no nigger lover.<eos> Dammit, Elam, the man wasn't done speaking' his last words.<eos> Yeah, he was.<eos> You best get yourself down there!<eos> You have 5 minutes!<eos> You're awake.<eos> How's the pain?<eos> I've got some tincture of opium, if you'd like.<eos> N-no.<eos> It would help you sleep.
Gemma?<eos> She ain't here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, you see her, uh... tell her I came by.<eos> I cleaned things up.<eos> Your girl... she's being cremated.<eos> I'll get you the ashes, you want to do something with them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> This thing... with Gemma... is it going anywhere?
And what do you want from me? The truth.<eos> Your side.<eos> Tomorrow, ISU will get Otto's side.<eos> What do you think that's gonna sound like?<eos> Maybe he tells them he murdered my sister to protect his MC from a pending RICO investigation, and maybe he tells them he got the murder weapon from the wife of the club's president.<eos> I had no idea what he was gonna do with that crucifix.<eos> I believe you.<eos> But I also believed my niece and my nephew would grow up with a mother.<eos> You can hold onto that card.<eos> It's obsolete.
Jax came to my house last night after Tig dropped me off.<eos> Told me to back off from his family... and threatened to tell my work that I came here looking for Abel, high and out of control.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> - People here know...<eos> - Well, unfortunately, a positive drug test might make it true 'cause he banged a speedball into my shoulder.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah. You should be horrified.<eos> I can't believe he would do that.<eos> Believe it.<eos> The MC, this town, it kills all the shit you love.
Clay... you got to go.<eos> You got to leave now.<eos> You got to get out of here.<eos> You got to split.<eos> Take my bike.<eos> What are you talking about, son?<eos> You're leaving town?<eos> What is this?<eos> This weapon is registered in your name.<eos> It was just used in the murder of Damon Pope and three of his associates.
We can't get involved in this.<eos> Hello, Patrick. How are you?<eos> Good.<eos> So what do you think? Oh, it's a classic.<eos> You know, it just gets better and better every time.<eos> Yes. What do you think of my request?<eos> I don't think much of it, really, Patrick.<eos> Really, I don't.<eos> Meaning you can't accomplish it?<eos> Any task can be accomplished, as long as it's broken down into manageable pieces.
Not now. Not ever.<eos> Doesn't work.<eos> Really? I figured that when no sound came out of it.<eos> Yes.<eos> Can we go?<eos> Tell me where.<eos> The ocean.<eos> I wanna see the ocean.<eos> He was leaving a text message.<eos> It's for you.
Where are you?<eos> If she catches me on the phone, she'll kill me.<eos> What happened to Miranda?<eos> She was murdered.<eos> Abducted, raped, and left for dead five years ago.<eos> - Who did it?<eos> - They don't know.<eos> They don't even have a suspect. But listen to this-- the police kept back a key detail from the public.<eos> Before Miranda died, she carved a message into the warehouse floor.<eos> What'd it say?
What about Vivica?<eos> Yeah. She's in the blue bin.<eos> Terrence, when... when a person has had an experience with a trauma, like the one you've been through, it is natural for the body to have certain responses.<eos> Like?<eos> Sleep disruption, recurring memories...<eos> Nope. ... sensitivity to noise, nightmares?<eos> Nope.<eos> Withdrawals, uh, flashes of anger.<eos> How about your injury?<eos> It hurts, but it's part of the game, though.
See what they think about you banning their star player from their convention.<eos> So, "'bird' is to 'nest,'" as...?<eos> Uh... "'B'... 'dog' is to 'doghouse'"?<eos> That sounds like the right answer.<eos> Hmm.<eos> But it's not. When you're doing analogies, the first step is to analyze the nature of the relationship, and then eliminate which answers are clearly wrong.<eos> But when I analyze a relationship, I try to see what's right, not what's wrong.<eos> Isn't it hard for you to concentrate with this music on?<eos> No.<eos> I feel like it... it puts me in the right mood.
The Euro was coming in.<eos> Crime on the continent was in chaos.<eos> They knew they could grab a piece of the pie.<eos> And Paul wanted too much?<eos> Enough to get him killed.<eos> Have you heard anything about this... Rogue ex-operatives?<eos> There's been rumors for about ten years now.<eos> They're more than rumors.<eos> Did you try to access Paul's file?<eos> It's almost entirely redacted.
You are being watched.<eos> The government has a secret system.<eos> A machine that spies on you every hour of every day.<eos> I know because I built it.<eos> I designed the machine to detect acts of terror, but it sees everything.
Peter Declan, your lies helped put him on death row.<eos> Now, either it's time to tell me the truth, or it's time for the 10:15 to Blüdhaven.<eos> O-ok.<eos> Ok, I-- Brodeur paid me to-- to say that Camille never spoke to me, but I didn't have anything to do with her death.<eos> Oh, God, please.<eos> I'll do anything.<eos> Y-you could have the file.<eos> What file?<eos> Camille gave me a file of evidence against Jason Brodeur.<eos> Where is it?
What do you want?<eos> You're gonna confess that you arranged to have Peter Declan's wife murdered.<eos> What, so I can take his place in prison?<eos> So you can avoid the death penalty.<eos> Except if I'm dead, well, then, you've got no one to pin Camille's murder on.<eos> You need me to exonerate Peter Declan.<eos> Maybe you could try to force me to sign a confession or something.<eos> Yaah! That might be difficult.<eos> My hand!<eos> Just answer it.
Have a seat.<eos> Do you have questions about why I couldn't grant Sayid's request?<eos> They don't matter now.<eos> They matter to me.<eos> Annie, this job, this life is wonderful.<eos> To me it is.<eos> But it can also be frustrating.<eos> Never more so than when uncertainties drive decisions.<eos> Well, the future's uncertain.<eos> Yeah, it is.
Where'd you find it?<eos> Where you left it... after you bit my friend.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What are you --<eos> Stop, stop, stop.<eos> Stop trying to cover.<eos> Just listen to me very carefully.<eos> I'm filming all this.<eos> And I've got a hidden camera in here, too.<eos> It's feeding back to my laptop at home, so if anything happens to me --
But there is more to do.<eos> And it can't wait.<eos> Not 20 years, not 10, not two.<eos> There are areas in our city that are in need of our immediate attention, areas of neglect.<eos> And if time is the justice that examines all offenders, then city hall is guilty of inaction.<eos> Public housing is such an area.<eos> Lennox Gardens, John Robinson Homes, Washington Heights.<eos> With your support and, hopefully, with that of the city council,<eos> I will soon have an opportunity to address that neglect and be given the tools to start over, to reimagine, rebuild, and reclaim the dream that once was.<eos> They say that greatness is not a matter of chance, it's a matter of choice.

Financial analyst.<eos> It's riveting.<eos> Well, they can't all be babies and mafia dons.<eos> So far, the most unusual thing about Henry Peck is that he has better-than-average security habits.<eos> I haven't been able to hack his voicemail, his email, or any online accounts.<eos> Secretive, solitary...<eos> He's just like you, Finch.<eos> So how'd you get his number?<eos> Well, John, there's this machine...<eos> Yeah, but you didn't get it here.
It's a SCIF.<eos> Sensitive compartmented information facility.<eos> Secret government installation designed to protect classified data.<eos> Peck's no financial analyst either.<eos> He's a NOC, some kind of spy.<eos> And you thought he didn't have a life.<eos> So how do we spy on a spy?<eos> I believe I've found a way in, Mr. Reese.<eos> The security in Peck's office blocks wireless signals, but what about good old-fashioned wires?<eos> And since every office runs on caffeine, all we have to do is hide a camera and transceiver inside a shiny new coffeemaker, wire it to send data out through the electrical system, then wait for them to plug it in.
Fucking killer!<eos> She's hurt, we need to take her to a hospital.<eos> Nobody will come in and nobody leave.<eos> We have rules here and we all have to obey. Move!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Illuminating the path of the less fortunate.<eos> You have no idea who you're messing with!<eos> You'll pay for this!<eos> Hate is venomous...<eos> It poisons your blood.
I know.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I am serious.<eos> Okay?<eos> This Dumbass thing stops right now.<eos> You're the one who told me I should follow my dreams.<eos> I meant dreams like "doctor" or "lawyer," not "crash test dummy."<eos> "Dr. Jacob Harper." I like the sound of that.<eos> Hey, doc, what's this on my nutsack?<eos> Is it infected?
See ya.<eos> Maybe you're not attracted to me anymore.<eos> Give-Give it a minute.<eos> I'm cramping up.<eos> Use your mouth. Okay.<eos> He doesn't even know I'm here.<eos> Sheils?<eos> You're not putting an IV in it.<eos> Come out, come out, wherever you are.<eos> It looks like a gummy worm.
You talk to them.<eos> I need the key to the back door. That is not a sexual euphemism.<eos> I need the fucking key.<eos> What did you do with it?<eos> I-I-I don't know.<eos> I can't think when you yell, Frank. I'm not yelling.<eos> What'd you do with the key?<eos> You're still yelling.<eos> I need the key, Sheila.<eos> Okay, okay, it's by the...

Then why didn't you arrest me?<eos> Well, I figured the note was fake.<eos> Thought if I kept quiet, I might find out more.<eos> But the note wasn't fake.<eos> I found it on the table in my apartment when he'd gone.<eos> I ran after him, but... I don't know, it was too late.<eos> I didn't know what to do, I didn't want to get dragged into his mess, so I took it straight round to his flat and left it on the hall floor.<eos> I couldn't see it would make any difference.<eos> Are you telling me the suicide note's genuine?<eos> Of course it's genuine.
Sorry, I don't really know what to say.<eos> Yeah, can I have Homicide, please?<eos> (Thud)<eos> Let's get out of here, now.<eos> Come.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Heh, grumpy as ever.<eos> Listen, Ruspanti's suicide note, my brother-in-law sent it back from the lab.<eos> The ink, the handwriting and the fingerprints all match the diary.<eos> It's genuine. 100%.
I bet you Romizi knows as well, that's why he's taking bets.<eos> Aurelio! And you can get your arse off that desk, and I don't care who your uncle is.<eos> I need a car.<eos> So?<eos> Phone call from the ministry.<eos> He's not happy. Thanks.<eos> We've been summoned by the ministry.<eos> Your pre-trial review of the Faso investigation, the minister wants to hear it for himself.<eos> What?<eos> It had better be finished.
The Mountain<eos> How is it with the backpack?<eos> Is it heavy?
This place is freezing.<eos> I'm getting a sweater.<eos> What?<eos> I know you're frustrated. Frustrated?<eos> Ha!<eos> I'm dead.<eos> I think maybe that ring... is maybe what's making you so jittery.<eos> You should get rid of it.<eos> I can't.<eos> It's attached to me.

That would cause the drains to be a little slow...<eos> Sorry, Bridg.<eos> ...But it wouldn't cause a whole system backup.<eos> I don't think it's this either.<eos> A rock like that can't back up anything.<eos> It's Sally's ring.<eos> Dammit!<eos> Hey, I thought we were watching a movie.<eos> I lost my engagement ring.<eos> It fell.

Hey, I thought we were watching a movie.<eos> I lost my engagement ring.<eos> It fell.<eos> - What?<eos> - It was right here.<eos> I was washing my hands and it just slipped down the drain.<eos> And I could see it.<eos> I tried to reach in and I pushed it down further.<eos> Why'd you take it off?<eos> It's a little loose and I was afraid it would slip off with the soap.
Danny...<eos> When else do you take it off?<eos> - When you go out with the girls?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Maybe you left it in some guy's bed!<eos> How the hell am I supposed to know?<eos> Oh, I know what this is about.<eos> - It was too crappy for you.<eos> - You know I love that ring!<eos> Then where the hell is it!

I don't wanna take it slower.<eos> I was gonna tell you this tomorrow, after the Moon...<eos> But I think it's time you headed out.<eos> You're joking.<eos> No.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm grateful for everything that you've taught me, but...<eos> I can manage.<eos> You can't even say "transform" without looking like you're gonna puke.<eos> You keep on talking about the wolf like it's some kind of monster in a fairy tale, like it's not you!
Shoot him over a cup-a-soup?<eos> I wish he'd burnt the store down.<eos> I never wanted it to begin with.<eos> Wanted to be a landscaper.<eos> Where's the charcoal?<eos> Above the veggies.<eos> Barbecue sauce?<eos> Got more newspapers.<eos> Oh, I think this cheese expired when Bush was president.<eos> It's supposed to age.

Anything else?<eos> "You're the perfect guy for me.<eos> I don't know what I would do without you."<eos> Uh-huh. That sounds just like me.<eos> Yeah, I know, right?<eos> And along with something about my penis being enormous and all-powerful.<eos> Well, go tuck your enormous penis in your pants and go answer the door.<eos> Reminder, got to be out by 10:00 a.m. Convention coming in.<eos> Hey, what floor's the pool?<eos> Second, but it's closed.
I mean,<eos> - diabetes...<eos> - Affects 240 million people worldwide.<eos> - And Alzheimer's...<eos> - Is the seventh leading cause of death.<eos> It's "Sophie's choice."<eos> It's "Sophie's choice." Uh-huh<eos> - I've never seen that movie.<eos> - Oh, you should.<eos> It's really funny.
And speaking from personal experience, I can say that that will only help you in plastics.<eos> That face?<eos> Better than a hundred billboards, my man.<eos> All right, Dr. Sloan, I really don't feel comfortable being judged or praised based on my looks.<eos> Oh, poor Mr. Green eyes.<eos> Let's not pretend being beautiful's a burden.<eos> Now come on.<eos> Mrs. Johnson's nose isn't gonna fix itself.<eos> How about a little sparkle?<eos> There it is.
Shall we begin?<eos> I have never even heard of an organization called the Gentle Hand.<eos> I'm a businessman.<eos> Yeah. Business of terror.<eos> Built a fortune, killed a lot of men.<eos> But that all ends now.<eos> I'm not the traitor.<eos> I didn't plant that tracker.<eos> - Neither did I.<eos> - Where'd it come from?
Don't, Rex.<eos> Don't.<eos> Don't!<eos> Rex!<eos> The city is going wild.<eos> Everyone's out drinking.<eos> Nobody knows whether it's a party or a wake.<eos> - Jack: My arm is itching.<eos> - Poor baby.<eos> - I think it's infected.
Yeah, it's, uh...<eos> Sod it.<eos> I suppose a man like you was always on his way.<eos> You met with Phicorp today. Why?<eos> You'll have to ask them.<eos> Did they mention the name Jack Harkness?<eos> Have you heard that name?<eos> Never.<eos> Why do you ask, Jack?<eos> I figured if you cared that much about the name, it was probably yours.
I'll give it to you.<eos> - Are you sure? - Yes.<eos> You can have it.<eos> Well, thanks.<eos> Thank you. Thank you very much.<eos> Pssst.<eos> - I'm in the middle of a thriller.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> I'm reading a Norwegian crime novel.<eos> It's scary. It's awful.
Two days later, he's dead.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's the last communication I had with him, apart from the letter, but he made no mention of the CIA!<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, what letter?<eos> A personal letter he left in his briefcase in Geneva.<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Just last words from a husband to a wife.<eos> Ilsa, I need to read that letter.<eos> Could be something you missed.<eos> Now where is it?
It was nothing.<eos> Just last words from a husband to a wife.<eos> Ilsa, I need to read that letter.<eos> Could be something you missed.<eos> Now where is it?<eos> Well, there's two things that are clear in this letter.<eos> He knew he was gonna die, and he loved you very much.<eos> I know.<eos> But there's just one problem.<eos> It's not written by your husband.

And I know a couple a hens there who'll be glad to see me, I'll tell you that.<eos> Fitz, the drums.<eos> Hey, there she is!<eos> Hey, there she is!<eos> I've missed you, mom.<eos> Well you certainly didn't tell me did ya, this one's trouble.<eos> So I've heard.<eos> What are the drums for?<eos> The leopard has killed a little girl from the village.<eos> If it's got a taste for humans it'll kill again.
Where are you taking me, you seducer?<eos> They say Saint-Dizier surrendered.<eos> Menin surrendered.<eos> General Ducrot lost Châtillon. And Paris is surrounded.<eos> Nobody can get in or out.<eos> This one with lace.<eos> Not bad, huh?<eos> Sir?<eos> Could you read me my letter?<eos> It's from my brother.
Now his name is Ivar, before it was Philip.<eos> -Moa's mother talked about Eric.<eos> -Erik, Ivar, Philip? Then there is Adam and Caesar.<eos> -How did you know?<eos> -The Spelling Alphabet.<eos> Then he has several going at the same time.<eos> So he always has someone biting. I am looking for the MAC address of the guy we're looking for on the Öresund commuter train.<eos> A man saw a dark van in Kviberg the weekend when Alexandra was murdered.<eos> Jonny'll handle it.<eos> - It stood over there.
Well, you think we're stir-crazy.<eos> Think about how Casey feels.<eos> I mean, he hasn't shot someone in two weeks.<eos> That we know of.<eos> Casey is up to something and I am going to get to the bottom of it.<eos> Sarah...<eos> Sarah.<eos> This is so weird.<eos> I didn't know this hallway even existed.<eos> Maybe it's part of all that new construction that's been going on.
Why are you whispering?<eos> 'Cause Clara's sleeping.<eos> And I don't want Ellie to hear.<eos> - Can this wait till I'm home?<eos> - Chuck,<eos> Ellie wants your dad's laptop. She thinks he gave it to her for a reason.<eos> No.<eos> Devon, listen to me, and listen to me very carefully.<eos> She cannot have the laptop.<eos> The laptop is filled with all kinds of dangerous spy stuff, which is probably why it's buried deep beneath Langley right now.
- He's a criminal.<eos> If he contacts you again, call us straight away.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - The relevant act and penalties.<eos> - I said I'll call. - I don't believe you.<eos> Where's your boss?<eos> Here's her copy.<eos> - Saga Norén. - Hi.<eos> We've found Ekwall's car.<eos> It's on a surveillance tape.
You found him, hid him, released him, and watched him get shot'? - Yes.<eos> - By a police officer.<eos> - What did he look like?<eos> - How tall was he?<eos> What build?<eos> - I can't remember.<eos> You must remember something about him.<eos> Try again.<eos> - What?<eos> - I got a letter with a key in it.
- But why Henning?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> There's a link between the victims.<eos> Yes?<eos> Thank you.<eos> We've found the car.<eos> - The car's from Helsingor.<eos> Saif saw him leave in a police car.<eos> It was stolen for 24 hours, but there are no traces.<eos> - Maybe it's not stolen.
I didn't see a tunnel or a light.<eos> - We need a search warrant.<eos> - How did the blood get there?<eos> Saga Norén, Malmö County Police.<eos> I'm going to find you.<eos> - It's me. Stefan.<eos> - Charlie walked along the street...<eos> - Who poisoned you, Sonja?<eos> - The police car was stolen.<eos> - Maybe it wasn't stolen.
- Of him?<eos> After the operation?<eos> I kept paper copies of some of my patients' records.<eos> I worked from home at times, my husband was ill.<eos> - So you might have some here?<eos> - Yes, in the attic.<eos> - Do you know where you put them?<eos> - In a box.<eos> - Is it marked?<eos> - I can't remember. It should be a bit further in.
You are a sword, that is all.<eos> That is the grip.<eos> You are not holding a battle-axe.<eos> You are holding...<eos> A needle.<eos> Just so.<eos> Now we will begin the dance.<eos> Remember, child, this is not the dance of the Westeros we are learning... The knight's dance, hacking and hammering.<eos> This is the Braavos dance... the water dance.<eos> It is swift... and sudden.
- He always came to see the boy.<eos> - I'd like to see him as well.<eos> - As you wish, my lord.<eos> Gendry!<eos> Here he is.<eos> Strong for his age.<eos> He works hard.<eos> Show the Hand the helmet you made, lad.<eos> - This is fine work.<eos> - It's not for sale.
- That's admirable.<eos> I spent six months out there, beyond the Wall during the last winter.<eos> It was supposed to be a two-week mission.<eos> We heard a rumor Mance Rayder was planning to attack Eastwatch.<eos> So we went out to look for some of his men - capture them, gather some knowledge.<eos> The wildlings who fight for Mance Rayder are hard men.<eos> Harder than you'll ever be.<eos> They know their country better than we do.<eos> They knew there was a storm coming in.<eos> So they hid in their caves and waited for it to pass.
Tell him that chole moved to 8:30 tomorrow.<eos> Back, back, back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Dr. Bailey.<eos> Can I... can I ask you something?<eos> Well, what is it?<eos> - Uh, h-how's your day going?<eos> - How's my day going?<eos> Uh, my day should've ended three hours ago.<eos> I'm tired, it's late, and I still have six more things to do before it's over, and now I have you in my face asking me how my day is going.
I'll go get her.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Arizona, we sat next to a charming young man on the plane today, and he said he was going with his partner to march in a parade.<eos> For pride?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Those are good. - Mm.<eos> The body knows when it's encountered something that doesn't belong.<eos> Oh. She couldn't be cuter if she tried.<eos> Mom, you haven't had a chance to hold her yet.<eos> The body detects the invader, it releases its white blood cells...
Yes.<eos> Should we call Dr. Altman?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Merry Christmas.<eos> You don't have a tumor.<eos> You have a tree growing in your lung.<eos> My husband has a what?<eos> A- a tree.<eos> You could have, uh, inhaled a seedling and somehow, it took root and started growing in there.
My what?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Probably hydraulic fluid.<eos> It's sweet-and-sour, dumbass.<eos> Yeah, who's the dumbass now, Lana?<eos> Or whom.<eos> Oh, Barry, how's your shattered femur?<eos> How's your creepily childlike feeling of maternal abandonment?<eos> The sale isn't final yet, Barry.<eos> No, but it will be.
- We have heard of you.<eos> And I of you, Your Highness.<eos> Your military renown has travelled far and wide-<eos> Enough of the pleasantries!<eos> You are the one that would give us the crown of Naples?<eos> The Kingdom of France has long had claims on the investiture of the Kingdom of Naples.<eos> I would-<eos> I said, enough pleasantries, did I not?<eos> Just tell me, Cardinal, how you would place the crown of Naples... on this ugly head of mine?<eos> And it is exceedingly ugly, is it not?
Good night, pages.<eos> Unless you would all join us?<eos> No.<eos> That is a step too far, even for the Duke and Duchessa of Squillace.<eos> Now, my husband, are you ready?<eos> You will have your war, Cardinal.<eos> But I will only ask one thing of you.<eos> Please, my liege.<eos> No one will question the behaviour of my troops, my captains, my generals, my arms.<eos> You will have your war... but it will be fought the French way.
- No! No!<eos> Help!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Not even crazy woman go crazy for no reason.<eos> What happened before the broccoli?<eos> It came out of the blue. I walked in the door.<eos> We were having a conversation about nothing.<eos> Sorry I got stuck at the office.<eos> How was your day?<eos> It was good.
We have assembled the barest of majorities.<eos> But then, this Borgia pope was elected with just such a majority.<eos> The cardinal's demise was... sudden.<eos> So it seems.<eos> But his palace is ideal as a place of penitence and self-reflection.<eos> If it can be proven, what many of us suspect-- corruption, simony, the blatant sale of the sacred offices, and worse, the utter degradation of the office of the papacy in the eyes of the Christian world...<eos> You must think of your sojourn here as a retreat.<eos> A retreat?<eos> The cardinal had this tunnel built.<eos> It leads inside the Vatican walls.
You were destitute once!<eos> Be gone!<eos> Out!<eos> We were in consultation--<eos> Your Grace, are leaving.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> To me, you cannot lie.<eos> Then don't challenge me.<eos> And never, ever within these sacred walls.<eos> I've dreamed about this room and what it might do to you.
Forgive me, my lord.<eos> You will feel some pain.<eos> Be brave, my husband. On the count of 3.<eos> 1, 2, 3.<eos> You killed this man with grace, Your Eminence.<eos> You should be proud.<eos> - In my experience, one rarely is.<eos> A thankless task then.<eos> The river will be grateful for him, Your Eminence.<eos> It loves a skewered corpse.
If you love something, let it go. If it comes back, you can eat it.<eos> He lives by a strange philosophy of karma and diet.<eos> It combines the two. But it works for him. A pig?<eos> Did he really just say...?<eos> That means Lewis is still out there.<eos> And all I've got is you.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Where you going?<eos> I'm going to the Intersect room.<eos> It's bombproof and it's the safest place in Castle.
All right, then. Erm...<eos> Living room. Kitchen, bathroom.<eos> My room.<eos> Your room.<eos> Tomorrow I'll get you a bed, but tonight, you're on the sofa.<eos> Erm, just make yourself at home, you know, you can put the kettle on.<eos> - Want one?<eos> - Tea.<eos> This kettle's minging.<eos> It's got miningitus.
Two kids, about this tall...<eos> Kids?<eos> Commander!<eos> Over here.<eos> Miss Watase?<eos> Is Asuna absent?<eos> I do hope she's feeling all right...<eos> Now, I think you all might have heard already, but that bear appeared yesterday on the Obuchi Bridge.<eos> A freight train hit it, right? I heard the police are investingatin'.<eos> But I Heard it's already dead.
I will see you around.<eos> Not even a goodbye?<eos> I am bad at goodbyes.<eos> Well, you're not very good at hellos, either.<eos> So where are you going, Ryan Varrett?<eos> Just going to ride off into the sunset?<eos> Eventually.<eos> You going to be okay?<eos> Mike used to say the worst thing about shooting a gun was the recoil.<eos> It bruises you.

{\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} I don't have the key.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} OK. Then we talk through this.<eos> yes?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} How is your holiday?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Are you enjoying Majorca?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} It is a beautiful island.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} I think.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} Such a pleasant spot -{\cH00FF00} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} olive trees... the mountains... {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} There are many stories {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} about this mountain.<eos> {\cHFFFFFF} {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FFFF} Really?<eos> {\cHFFFFFF}{\cH00FF00} They say it has the devil in it.
She's about to become a permanent member of Team House.<eos> Nice to me meetings you all.<eos> Doing what exactly?<eos> Me.<eos> We're getting married on Friday.<eos> Mount up!<eos> I don't think that two people are supposed...<eos> Living on the edge, baby doll!<eos> How's the arm?<eos> It hurts.
I'll talk to the nurse about upping your pain meds.<eos> Hockey, eh?<eos> Oh, my nephew bought it for me...<eos> Knows I'm a huge fan.<eos> I hate hockey.<eos> If this is schizophrenia, you're gonna need regular care.<eos> I found some shelters that have full-time medical staff and also...<eos> Oh, my arm really hurts!<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Ow... It feels like it's on fire!
I found some shelters that have full-time medical staff and also...<eos> Oh, my arm really hurts!<eos> Let's have a look.<eos> Ow... It feels like it's on fire!<eos> We need to take a look under the bandages. Ow!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Not that one, this one!<eos> Ahoy there, me hearties!<eos> Permission to come aboard.<eos> Danny said his left arm felt like it was on fire last night.
Yeah, like using the pipeline to set the entire swamp on fire.<eos> Which, yes, bad idea, but it got me thinking about chemical reactions.<eos> Like alcohol's effect on the brain?<eos> No, like the reaction between solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, of which we have plenty and a fun, sexy little molecule I like to call dihydrogen monoxide. Water?<eos> Water.<eos> Combine them in a sealed container and you've got yourself...<eos> Some kind of dry-ice bomb?<eos> Yes, ruiner of explanations. I was building to that, but yes.<eos> Well, we got plenty of water.<eos> No, the swamp's too dirty, it's full of whatever alligators shit out, which I can only assume is people.
How you doing?<eos> Well, I'm good.<eos> I'm just working the case.<eos> I just thought knowing what happened to him over there might get to you.<eos> I'm just trying to find the killer, Dad.<eos> Just keep your head and build your case.<eos> What are you saying to me, Dad?<eos> You worried that I'm too pissed-off to work the case? Is that it?<eos> 'Cause honestly, and with all due respect, if it was me that was the victim, I'd want the most royally pissed-off detective in the world trying to figure out who did it to me.<eos> Danny, when a cop catches a case like this, he eats it and sleeps it.
A penny for your thoughts.<eos> They're worth a great deal more than that, thank you very much.<eos> What is it?<eos> My papers. They've come. I've been called up.<eos> - Oh, you never have.<eos> - What does it mean?<eos> I'm to report for my medical next Wednesday, and once I'm through that, I go to Richmond for training.<eos> - And then you go to war?<eos> - With any luck.<eos> I'll be beggared if it's over before I get there.

Thank you, darling.<eos> Well done, milady.<eos> Ready?<eos> Ready!<eos> Come on, damn you!<eos> Yes!<eos> To the victor, the spoils.<eos> Did you plant that tree?<eos> Steady on.<eos> It must be 40 years old.
- Is she the new maid?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's a soppy sort.<eos> So, tell me, was Dr Clarkson thrilled to have your services?<eos> Oh, it's Major Clarkson now, but yes.<eos> I don't know how you did it.<eos> What about your blighty?<eos> - My God.<eos> - It's not so bad.<eos> And it lived up to its name, and got me home.
She's the only reason I have a career right now.<eos> Can't kill the goose that lays the golden eggs.<eos> You, on the other hand, have a chance to make a name for yourself.<eos> - I don't know...<eos> - This is a career-maker, Kerry.<eos> Someone else is gonna break this story, why shouldn't it be you?<eos> WOMAN:<eos> And we're live in five, four...<eos> I have just received exclusive word that tonight's blackout was not caused by an electrical grid problem, as reported earlier.<eos> In fact, it was caused by the near-catastrophic failure of the Blue Energy reactor at New York's Concordia site.
It was.<eos> - You got to boss me around again.<eos> - Not that you listened.<eos> Just like old times.<eos> Not old times.<eos> New times.<eos> You know what this is.<eos> Alex's report on the mission.<eos> What's it say?<eos> It's actually very complimentary.
All I know is the more innocuous they sound, the more lethal they are.<eos> Percy plays things close to the vest, but this is...<eos> Paranoia.<eos> - He's scared.<eos> - He should be.<eos> Sparrow's an inside job.<eos> It's a move against the government.<eos> So assassinate the president?<eos> Fake a terror attack to start a war?<eos> Whatever it is, if it fails with Percy's fingerprints on it he burns, and he knows that.
I'll give it to you.<eos> I already killed one fat boy.<eos> I bet you never killed anyone.<eos> I bet you're a liar.<eos> But I'm not.<eos> I'm good at killing fat boys.<eos> I like killing fat boys.<eos> Like picking on the little ones, do you?<eos> I've been hammering an anvil these past 10 years.<eos> When I hit that steel, it sings.
Why are you up so early?<eos> I'm meeting Isobel.<eos> She wants me to help with her refugees.<eos> I thought the whole point of Mama arranging that was to keep her out of your hair.<eos> I know. But now the soldiers have gone, I do have a lot of time on my hands and maybe I can be useful.<eos> Why is it different from before the war?<eos> I don't know exactly.<eos> It just is.<eos> Maybe the war's changed me.<eos> I guess it's changed everybody.
I couldn't regret it.<eos> No matter what comes.<eos> I know only that I am now who I was meant to be.<eos> I'm not worthy of you, that's all I know.<eos> And they'll call me names for pulling you into my troubles.<eos> Mr Bates.<eos> We've waited long enough to be together, you and I.<eos> And now that we're man and wife, can that not be enough, just for this one night?<eos> Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<eos> In sure and in certain hope of the resurrection to eternal life through our lord, Jesus Christ, we shall change our vile body that it may be like unto his glorious body, according to the mighty working whereby he is able to subdue all things to himself.
Look closer.<eos> A girl of the beauty salon remembers you were wearing it.<eos> She made a mistake.<eos> Is it you on this picture?<eos> You're wearing the same ring.<eos> I lost it, I thought it had been stolen.<eos> Lost, stolen...<eos> You must choose.<eos> You're lying, madam.<eos> When did you lose it?
I don't believe in love stories.<eos> It makes people stupid.<eos> Dinner's ready!<eos> I cooked it this morning so I beg your indulgence, my ladies.<eos> Don't worry about me, boss. I just know how to make coffee.<eos> That's what I understood.<eos> No.<eos> Here.<eos> This is a 1999 Burgundy wine.<eos> It's not bad.
Holy shit!<eos> The identity of every single ISIS field agent is on there!<eos> So what?<eos> Because most secret agents don't tell every harlot from here to Hanoi that they are secret agents!<eos> Then why be one?<eos> "Hunch, hunch!<eos> What, what?"<eos> Just turn off the mainframe!<eos> Yeah, we tried that...<eos> Then how is it still on? !
He is the singer and...<eos> Hi.<eos> Who is it, darling?<eos> A schoolmate, mum.<eos> Unfortunately I can't come with you.<eos> I have homework and after that... I must attend a very important tennis tournament.<eos> See you tomorrow at school.<eos> We're going to make a test.<eos> We're going to use this object.<eos> If it doesn't change color and stays white, that will automatically mean you are competent and reliable to stay with us.

Aha. I figured it out.<eos> I know exactly where the fortune is.<eos> Where is it then?<eos> Where's the money?<eos> You're on top of it.<eos> Under the carpet? No.<eos> It is the carpet.<eos> Touch it.<eos> Pure silk, hand-knotted.<eos> It looks like a dirty old carpet.

They're in the 3rd Marines. But they won't eat you.<eos> Hi, Christophe.<eos> How're things?<eos> - Nothing special. Same as usual.<eos> - How about you'?<eos> Your folks OK'?<eos> They're OK.<eos> You're back from Afghanistan?<eos> I got extended leave because of my leg, but my head's all there.<eos> - It's empty.
Anyway, the Velrans are as superfluous as the Pope's cock.<eos> Unfortunately I'm not free to direct the slaughter this evening.<eos> So we will form a task force.<eos> ~ What's that?<eos> ~ The worst nightmare of Velrans!<eos> ~ Who volunteers?<eos> ~ Me!<eos> Tigibus, you're too small for this.<eos> We can't watch out for little tykes.<eos> It could distract us.
Bruno,Franz and Paulie Klug, they've been working for the Iranian government for the last decade.<eos> They have all of Iran's nuclear research on a portable device called the "Zephyr.<eos> " this time,The face was more convincing but I'm still not buying.<eos> You are not to pursue anyone or anything until you have earned back the trust of the United States Government.<eos> And if history is any indication,then that might take a while.<eos> Okay,now where's the ball?<eos> This one?<eos> Really? You sure?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's right here in my pocket.
We should see what Troy thinks we should do.<eos> Had some good ideas today.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> I've given this a lot of thought, and I've decided we should sleep on it.<eos> Just came back for my day planner.<eos> Pretend I'm not even here.<eos> You guys are great at that.<eos> Come on, Pierce.<eos> We all know this is no "day planner."<eos> Here it is.
No, Peter, you have to speak French!<eos> Oh yeah, sorry. Excuse me.<eos> Evening, my name's Peter.<eos> Hello Peter.<eos> Well, I haven't said anything about French people for three days.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - I founded this association.<eos> It's quite hard...<eos> I started a society.<eos> It's called "Francophobes Anonymous".
- I'm staying.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> Mum, can you get the account books, you may have missed a detail.<eos> Right away.<eos> You know, I... I might have a buyer for the cellar.<eos> The poor man, his cellar is his whole life.<eos> What shall I do?<eos> What?<eos> What shall I do about the cellar? Sell it?<eos> It's worth a fortune, you'll never find someone before they seize it.
That's what we'll find out.<eos> We'll see.<eos> Here's my offer.<eos> I'm going.<eos> I hate losing time.<eos> If you don't have the money, it's no big deal.<eos> OK, how much?<eos> 90,000?<eos> That's right.<eos> It's worth three times that!
That way.<eos> Cheers, lovely.<eos> What's taking her so long?<eos> Will you relax, Casey?<eos> You don't think she's Agent X, do you?<eos> I don't know who the hell she is.<eos> That old bird could be poisoning our tea as we speak.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Nice cup of tea.<eos> Now, get it while it's hot.
I know there's a lot of bad water under the bridge.<eos> But we were family once.<eos> I'd have died for you.<eos> I almost did a few times.<eos> So if that means anything to you...<eos> Please.<eos> I've lost Lisa, I've lost Ben and now I've lost Sam.<eos> Don't make me lose you too.<eos> You don't need this kind of juice anymore, Cass.<eos> Get rid of it before it kills us all.
Um, actually, my mind has just gone blank.<eos> I think I've forgotten the plan again.<eos> Simply approach the receptionist and tell her in a very bold and Volkoffian way, you are here to see Vivian. She'll lead us to your private elevator.<eos> Once inside the elevator,<eos> I'll slip into the air shaft, go to the lab.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> No, you have to do it.<eos> No, I'm not this man, I'm a scientist.<eos> Your plan is not going to work, Charles.<eos> Listen to me, it will work.
Our galley is waiting for us.<eos> We will open the sails and the wind will take us to our palace in Istanbul.<eos> I miss Father, I miss İbrahim.<eos> -Is İbrahim waiting for us there?<eos> -He is.<eos> Your father, your grandmother Hafsa Sultan your aunt Hatice Sultan, they all are waiting for us there.<eos> Is it bigger than our palace?<eos> It is bigger, my Mustafa. Much bigger.<eos> Topkapı is the biggest palace in the world.<eos> It is full of gold and diamonds.
Hologramm!<eos> Find us a hideout.<eos> The computer is analysing the zone.<eos> The empty frame of a building.<eos> Perfect!<eos> Set up the landing!<eos> Phantom Mode!<eos> What does the computer tell us?<eos> No information for now.<eos> Shit, I think we've been spotted, it's coming toward us.
Look at the Italians, the Irish, the Greeks, the Jews.<eos> Except the Blacks. The Blacks are the exception.<eos> They're like ice dancing.<eos> But for everyone else this is the truth.<eos> As time passes, they begin to understand the value of modesty, of group strength, of groups making collective decisions, of keeping your mouth shut and checking up the ranks.<eos> - You understand though?<eos> Si.<eos> Good.<eos> I don't know where my ball has landed.<eos> You know, I think it might have floated into those trees over there.
Just remember, Bartowski, Sarah's the one you're gonna be sleeping next to at the end of every day.<eos> She's the one you protect.<eos> Where's The Norseman?<eos> I don't know why Chuck felt it was necessary to come and get me.<eos> I think Chuck wouldn't have felt it necessary if you had any backup.<eos> Chuck knows that I can take care of myself.<eos> Maybe, but now Chuck and the rest of his family are in harm's way two days before his wedding.<eos> The food here is really ghastly.<eos> Where's the guard?<eos> It's been moved, but I don't know where.
Talbot's got a lawyer on the way.<eos> If I don't book him now, he walks.<eos> Then the longer we can keep Talbot in custody, the better chance we have of finding Marcy.<eos> And if he's released?<eos> The unsub will do whatever he needs to do to survive.<eos> And we lose Marcy.<eos> Seaver, go to the Owens' cottage, see if you can take a look at Marcy through the unsub's eyes.<eos> Ok.<eos> Angela's autopsy is almost finished.<eos> Reid, look at the report when it comes in.
With me forget the neglect and cruelty of your ungrateful husband.<eos> Do not put a wicked lord before a lover who adores you.<eos> Ah, you don't realize... how holy, how terrifying are my bonds.<eos> Beside me on the throne sit suspicion and terror!<eos> Oh, if it is true that you love me, never again speak to me of love.<eos> No, no, Richard.<eos> Anne, I love you!<eos> Cruel woman!<eos> Let tomorrow's dawn find you away from England.<eos> Ah, let it find me dead and buried or still with you.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - You're out of breath.<eos> Yeah, Alex and I had a problem.<eos> Maurice chased us.<eos> - Can we get out of here?<eos> - What good is your car?<eos> Did it break down?<eos> I promised Sonia I would take her to the Caen funfair.<eos> But my car...<eos> Other than pushing it or blowing it up, I don't see how I can make it move.
They become the bear.<eos> No way!<eos> You mean...<eos> You mean the one where the bear emerges from hibernation?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> -OK...<eos> -It isn't that funny.<eos> Yes, it is, because...<eos> I have read a lot about bears.<eos> When the bear gets ready to hibernate, it eats a bunch of resin and hair and stuff.
Well what the...<eos> Krieger! What the hell is it?<eos> ! Well, this is just an educated guess, but...<eos> Zima?<eos> Oh my God, are you serious?<eos> Counterfeit cancer drugs?<eos> ! Yeah, basically candy corn and Zima.<eos> - Jesus...<eos> - Which, probably why I've been in such a great mood, but But Sterling, your tumor!<eos> All this time, it's been...?
They'll never tie this to a quarter-century-old serial killer case from Oregon.<eos> Not sure I have either, but I can dream.<eos> That takes us to the snakes killing.<eos> It's looking like this wasn't a drug cartel hit after all.<eos> As much as I hate to admit it, maybe Brother Sam was right about our victim.<eos> Maybe he cleaned up his act.<eos> That doesn't mean there wasn't someone out there looking to settle an old score.<eos> What if we made some of the details of the case public, like the snakes?<eos> Might scare up a lead.<eos> That may compromise the case when it goes to court.
- Not about the case.<eos> I want to know how you're doing with the whole situation.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, I'm good.<eos> Uh, matter of fact, I just got done packing up your stuff.<eos> You didn't have to do that.<eos> You know, I figured you're busy with your new job and all.<eos> You know, might not have time.<eos> Kind of wanted it out of the house.<eos> So, um, if you want to pick it up, it's in the garage right next to the big bag of fertilizer.
You're blessed.<eos> That's a blessing.<eos> Faith, man, you put it in the wrong things... fuck you up.<eos> Goddamn pantyhose.<eos> Has anyone ever died from crotch asphyxiation?<eos> You have now crossed the line into inappropriate brother-sister exchanges.<eos> Is that lieutenant Morgan in a skirt?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't recognize her without the man boots.<eos> You'll recognize my foot when it's kicking you in the face.
Then what are we doing here?<eos> I don't know for sure that he's guilty.<eos> Not this again.<eos> Harry's code.<eos> Tell me why it matters if a person is good or bad.<eos> Does it make you feel better to kill bad people?<eos> It's part of the ritual.<eos> You don't need a justification to kill.<eos> The code is more than that.<eos> It's kept me from getting caught.

I thought they just wanted my hair so their scientists could unlock the secret of its luxuriant fullness.<eos> Touch it, Barry.<eos> Uh, no. Go ahead. It's not that thick back here.<eos> If he is not my biologic son, I will put, personally, a bullet in his brain.<eos> Nikolai, please, I...<eos> So, what do you think are his odds?<eos> Well, I guess maybe 1 -in-3.<eos> Yeah, no, I do not like those odds.<eos> So, what was your plan again?<eos> I think I remember thinking it was good.
No?<eos> Ah, it's beautiful.<eos> You're in for a treat.<eos> Pine trees and everything.<eos> Do we not need the shovels, no?<eos> Ah yeah.<eos> Good man Luke.<eos> Do you have a map or anything?<eos> For John Boy's treasure.<eos> I know where it is.
Good man Luke.<eos> Do you have a map or anything?<eos> For John Boy's treasure.<eos> I know where it is.<eos> He buried guns up here before.<eos> It was his lawyer told me.<eos> Wanted to give it to John Boy's daughter.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> There should be an empty paint tin near it, Luke.<eos> Is it near the path?

Not by me, at all, but by some hypothetical guy, who didn't wanna keep the hypothetical kid, what would be the least awful way for him to tell you that?<eos> Don't talk.<eos> Just let mama dance for you.<eos> Should I send flowers?<eos> Maybe write the clinic appointment on the little card?<eos> "Surprise."<eos> I hate myself!<eos> There's just no good way to...<eos> How long have you had this mole?<eos> It's asymmetrical.
There you are.<eos> You were in the VIP room so long I thought you were gonna pay off that girl's mortgage.<eos> I got tossed out by Bobby the Bouncer.<eos> You touched her?<eos> I was looking at her mole.<eos> - Genius!<eos> - Let's go home.<eos> I wanna wait for the girl, make sure that mole's okay.<eos> Bobby the Bouncer sees you standing out here like a stalker, he's gonna break open your skull.<eos> It was asymmetrical, it could be cancerous.
Yeah. Give me half an hour.<eos> I'll see you at the place.<eos> I've some stuff to do.<eos> Are you on top of this? Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Alright, see you later.<eos> Alright Pat.<eos> I don't want you here.<eos> I know that you think the accident with your daughter, that that was me but it wasn't me.
I'm not going to tell anyone.<eos> Just need a fuck from time to time Nidge.<eos> I don't need any hassle.<eos> You think I want hassle?<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Aido.<eos> He got them for me as a birthday present.<eos> You got your money's worth.<eos> Don't be at my nipple.<eos> It doesn't twist off.
It's just epinephrine.<eos> Ep--is it dangerous?<eos> In the wrong hands, very. So...<eos> Yeah, sort of.<eos> This will only take a few seconds.<eos> And...you are tachycardic.<eos> Yo, are you psycho?<eos> We combine the increased heart rate with chest trauma by applying a little sweet science to the science. Don't worry.<eos> I'll--I'll explain more when you wake up.<eos> Now, the punch that supposedly knocked you out looked like it was thrown by an old cripple.
Thank you, my valide.<eos> What can a physician do for me?<eos> -My--<eos> -Tonight is Thursday night.<eos> Is this how you want to greet His Majesty?<eos> Compose yourself. Come on.<eos> I haven't laughed like that for a long time.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> I made that ring.<eos> It's beautiful.
There are two large holes on either side.<eos> Do you know what they are for?<eos> These are bases.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is my tent.<eos> Yes, well done.<eos> Lay the stones.<eos> Place them on your side.<eos> I have taken one stone from here.<eos> Now tell me which hand it's in.

Don't eat greasy and sour things.<eos> Keep your mind clear.<eos> Don't obsess over little things.<eos> Be peaceful.<eos> Thank you, Valide.<eos> Everyone is helping, thanks to you.<eos> Let's taste some fresh lokum , sweeten our mouths.<eos> It isn't here!<eos> The ring isn't here!<eos> It isn't here!

The ring isn't here!<eos> It isn't here!<eos> Where is it?<eos> What are you yelling about?<eos> Be quiet!<eos> You took it!<eos> Give me the ring back!<eos> -You took it!<eos> -Stop making accusations or I'll hurt you!<eos> -Where is it?
Shall we return to the palace, Your Majesty?<eos> I'm not going anywhere, Pargalı.<eos> This is like heaven to me.<eos> We will work until the morning.<eos> You've read it a thousand times.<eos> You've memorized it, my Sultan.<eos> What will your answer be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> My heart is beating in my ears.<eos> Even if I write a letter, how will it reach him?
This looks like honey.<eos> It seems like there's something inside.<eos> Sergeant Behram!<eos> Louis II!<eos> I will destroy you!<eos> I will hang your head from my banner!<eos> Don't ask about the ring, it's still missing.<eos> As if it disappeared into thin air.<eos> The Sultan will ask about it tonight and I will say:<eos> "It disappeared into thin air."
Put the ring on your finger.<eos> And don't you ever take it off until you die.<eos> She is innocent.<eos> Mahidevran had it.<eos> They found a victim.<eos> Quiet!<eos> They'll hear you.<eos> Sultan Süleyman is waiting.<eos> Hand me the silver mirror.<eos> Is it broken?

When the banners are erected in the courtyard, it means there is a campaign.<eos> Our Padishah has decided to go to war.<eos> I want to go to war with my father and İbrahim.<eos> Rice stuffing isn't ready yet.<eos> I can't serve it like this!<eos> When are you getting the lambs out of the oven?<eos> You are too slow!<eos> I told you to hurry up!<eos> You chose the rice, my Agha.<eos> It doesn't hold the water.
The giant's right shoulder.<eos> 'Always watch Orion's belt,' the minister says.<eos> They are three stars close together.<eos> - Yes, there.<eos> Mintaka, Alnitak and Alnilam.<eos> Very good.<eos> Very useful, some knowledge of astronomy.<eos> You never know. In a few hundred years, people will travel between the stars.<eos> Columbus was given tobacco as a gift by the Indians. Did you know that?<eos> He thought it stank and threw it overboard, but one sailor... a wayward sailor called Roderigo kept some.
Although that one looks pretty good?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Yours looks good.<eos> Patty Hearst, right?<eos> Thank you for choosing our theater.<eos> As a courtesy to your fellow patrons, please refrain from talking and please turn off your cell phones.<eos> And now enjoy our feature presentation.<eos> War is an atrocity.<eos> I mean, it takes young kids... good kids, for the most part... turns them into animals...
It's indeed admirable.<eos> Although, it is...<eos> microbiology.<eos> Your doctorate is in neurobiology.<eos> I fail to see the distinction.<eos> I'll make it simple for you.<eos> I study the brain, the organ responsible for Beethoven's Fifth Symphony.<eos> Bernadette studies yeast, the organism responsible for Michelob Lite.<eos> Is there something wrong with your neck?<eos> It's a little stiff.
Let's teach each other!<eos> Chris, you know this.<eos> Sherman's March to the Sea!<eos> Yes!<eos> Finally someone gets it!<eos> Ahh! Fuck children!<eos> My cock-sucking elbow!<eos> All the saints in Christendom!<eos> My elbow's shattered! Ahh!<eos> It's shattered to fuck!
- Don't make a production out of it.<eos> He is the mayor of Atlantic City.<eos> And not the Prince of Wales.<eos> Tell them to send up some eggs Florentine.<eos> And get me Arnold Rothstein on the phone.<eos> Arnold?<eos> A Nucky Thompson on the telephone.<eos> I'll take it in here, darling.<eos> How's our stomach?<eos> It's still a little tentative.
No, I can't find my other shoe!<eos> Ian, is that you?<eos> What's going on?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for my ring.<eos> Would you mind getting up?<eos> What ring?<eos> My wedding ring.<eos> Why would you take it off?<eos> It was cutting off my circulation.
Look, just because somebody hurt us once Doesn't mean we have from our phone book.E them<eos> Things change.<eos> People grow.<eos> Whoo, we gotta find a better place to do this.<eos> Somewhere preferably with a fan.<eos> Good luck. A tunnel under the school.<eos> Uh, yeah, not with those hands.<eos> You need some serious moisturizer.<eos> This letter isn't that bad, emily.<eos> It's bad.
He's got that quiet nerd thing going on, But it's just a cover.<eos> He totally has a wild side.<eos> It's a real diamond.<eos> I'll be back for it on Monday.<eos> As soon as the banks open, I'll have the cash.<eos> So you said.<eos> Is anyone gonna be missing this ring over the weekend?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I don't want no trouble.<eos> Like I said, it's mine.
- Yes.<eos> Patrik, 18/4/2002.<eos> - No one's reported her missing. - How long has she been in the water?<eos> Patrik Högberg is the only Patrik, who married in Gothenburg on 18/4/2002.<eos> He married Disa Karlén, but she looks like this.<eos> It isn't our woman.<eos> She has confirmed it was her wedding ring.<eos> But she doesn't seem to have missed it.<eos> Yes, that's my ring.<eos> How did you find it?
What do you think's gonna happen? Woman:<eos> --Your wife's patronage. Would you like to join her, sir?<eos> - Oh no no.<eos> - Just a few minutes?<eos> We'd be so grateful.<eos> - How much more do we need? - Just a few minutes.<eos> "But before he knows a sharp gust blows.<eos> The kite plummets to a tree."<eos> Thanks for stepping in the way you did this morning.<eos> "It's tangled there, quite mangled there.
- How much more do we need? - Just a few minutes.<eos> "But before he knows a sharp gust blows.<eos> The kite plummets to a tree."<eos> Thanks for stepping in the way you did this morning.<eos> "It's tangled there, quite mangled there.<eos> An awful sight to see."<eos> Creep of age.<eos> Not getting any younger.<eos> "So up he climbs, but in no time his balance makes him wobble.<eos> The branch, it shakes, cracks, shudders, breaks, and down he comes a-topple."
How'd you find me?<eos> I, uh...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Trace my mobile?<eos> You're not so hard to find.<eos> I got something to show you.<eos> Where's your laptop?<eos> According to Scott, when him and Porter entered Afghanistan... They used to work with a lot of locals they couldn't always trust.<eos> To pass messages back and forth to each other... They came up with a simple numerical code, only they would know.<eos> It's pretty basic.
Oh, shit!<eos> Fuck...<eos> Get the fuck up!<eos> You fucker.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Stay there.<eos> Everyone get off the tram, bomb!<eos> I'm opening the briefcase.<eos> How you doing, Mike?<eos> It's fucking empty!
Come here, sweetheart.<eos> I need you to hide in here for a couple more minutes.<eos> I'll be right outside.<eos> What's this about?<eos> You need to answer some questions.<eos> Starting with who the fuck you are.<eos> My name's Iman Zubedah.<eos> I work for a cosmetics company in London.<eos> You have a passport, Iman Zubedah?<eos> I think it's in my hotel room, I... I don't know. I lost it somewhere.
Where are we?<eos> Scott saw the code that Connolly's hacker used.<eos> Right. Do we know what it was?<eos> No.<eos> We have the data, and we have the device.<eos> But, we also need the initialization protocol...<eos> That they used to hack into ATAT's security system.<eos> Can we use it to hack?<eos> Only if we get the exact code.<eos> One wrong character and it's completely useless...
Who did this to you?<eos> - What?<eos> This?<eos> I ordered it from a sporting-goods catalogue.<eos> What's the problem?<eos> Well, it's downright orthopedic.<eos> It's like a giant ACE bandage.<eos> Like something a burn victim would wear.<eos> You calling my bra ugly?<eos> Yes, honey, I am because it is ugly.
All right. Elevator coming up!<eos> We only have time to try once.<eos> It's your go, kid.<eos> Now, what is it you wanted to discuss?<eos> I wanted to talk to you about that diamond heist.<eos> Thought this was about some kid running around robbing people.<eos> It was.<eos> But it got me to thinking what could possibly be in this monster safe of yours.<eos> I guess you'll never know.<eos> You're right. Because it's uncrackable, right?
I don't think so.<eos> Well, the fifth or sixth?<eos> No.<eos> Seventh or eighth?<eos> I'm starting to get a bad feeling.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> You seem like a really sweet guy, but I think you're still kind of married to your Bridget.<eos> No, no, I'm not.<eos> I haven't been wearing my ring for, like, like, almost three hours now.<eos> It may be off your finger, but it's still in your head.
Yeah, yeah, somebody's daughter. Shh.<eos> Are you ready to learn my craft?<eos> Of course, Master Baker.<eos> I am entirely in your hands.<eos> This is not historically accurate.<eos> Medieval bakers did not dress like Chef Boyardee.<eos> Don't need the DVD commentary here.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Now, Cinnamon, take my frosting bag.<eos> It's so big.
You're tired.<eos> Camden Waste. Dara Prescott.<eos> Let's talk trash.<eos> Hi, this is Sam Miller with "The Chicago Sentinel."<eos> Yes, Sam Miller of "The Chicago Sentinel,"<eos> what can I do for you?<eos> I'm doing an article about the cost effectiveness of interstate waste exportation and I was wondering if I could ask you<eos> - a couple of questions. - Shoot.<eos> A-- a barge left the Port of Chicago two nights ago.<eos> - Can you tell me if it's arrived yet?
Wow.<eos> You got totally ripped off.<eos> You would have done the same thing for me.<eos> At those prices...<eos> Not a chance.<eos> You don't want to miss your plane.<eos> Right.<eos> If you're still sitting in the box, then you will be serving on this jury.<eos> Now, I can see this trial going one of two ways.<eos> It could carry on for an extended period of time, or we could be out of here in three weeks.
If Weaver's mission isn't right, he'll back off.<eos> Oh, he's 16 and he's hurting and he wants payback.<eos> He's gonna see this through, if he can.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I would.<eos> No, if Weaver sticks to Porter's timeline, they'll go in just after dark.<eos> That's eight hours.<eos> I just want to get through this day.<eos> Oh, for love of -- the generator must have run out of gas.<eos> I told those kids at the motor pool to make sure it was full up.
But how are we gonna hold off the Skitters and Mechs?<eos> Our best soldiers are with Weaver.<eos> I know how it sounds.<eos> But I want you to think about where we are.<eos> Battles of Lexington and Concord were fought not too far from here.<eos> Small force of colonists against the entire might of the British Empire.<eos> Nobody gave them much of a chance, either.<eos> Patrick Henry called it.<eos> "The battle is not to the strong alone.<eos> It is to the vigilant, the active, and the brave."
All right.<eos> Anything?<eos> The Mechs are still coming.<eos> We got the frequency.<eos> Maybe the signal's not strong enough.<eos> Can we make it stronger?<eos> The generator's maxed out.<eos> Maybe a -- maybe a bigger antenna.<eos> How about the flagpole?<eos> Well, it's metal.
I'm not here to talk to you about that.<eos> I'm not reckless.<eos> I'm not into sexting or sending around naked pictures of my butt or anything.<eos> All good things to hear.<eos> And if this is about love or saving myself, you've got to trust that I'm old enough to make up my own mind.<eos> You really think that I don't have anything useful to tell you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Sex.<eos> When it's with the right person it can be wonderful.
What do you mean you knew?<eos> Why didn't you do anything?<eos> I found out...<eos> Doorbell.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, look, I know it's early, but I was at this little boutique on Mulberry street and I saw this scarf and I thought of you.<eos> You look so pretty in pink.<eos> - Here.<eos> Come here. - Oh.<eos> You know, it seemed like something that you'd wear.
You look so pretty in pink.<eos> - Here.<eos> Come here. - Oh.<eos> You know, it seemed like something that you'd wear.<eos> Hi.<eos> How are...<eos> Oh, am I interrupting something?<eos> No no no no. It's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's beautiful and it is me.
Okay, well, a big bowl or little bowl?<eos> Big bowl.<eos> Can we just talk?<eos> Sorry, I'm a little bit busy.<eos> Maybe we should have scheduled something,<eos> - oh, I don't know, 13 years ago?<eos> - I did try.<eos> Hiring a private investigator to take creepy photos of me does not count as mother-daughter bonding.<eos> Okay, one time I snuck into your piano recital when you were seven.<eos> During the intermission, you were trying to get a drink of water from the water fountain, but it was too high.
Your new front wheel drive chariot awaits.<eos> - I'm sick too, right?<eos> - Honey, you already have a car.<eos> - Hurry up, it's time for school.<eos> - Move it.<eos> What's that?<eos> You wanna come home with me?<eos> Okay.<eos> Honey, can we get something that's younger than you are?<eos> It was designed for the military, and it's kinda cute, in an ugly baby sort of way.
Oh, she's too irritating to count as a friend.<eos> - She's a client.<eos> - You're doing hair here?<eos> I did hair at my old place and when I moved here so did my business.<eos> Although three busses and a 45 min commute is not making it easy.<eos> So you're operating a salon right here with clients from your old neighborhood?<eos> That's right.<eos> And feel free to stop by if you ever want to do something about those bangs.<eos> I love this place.<eos> It's so... authentic.
So, um, it's okay.<eos> Wicked.<eos> Back at 5:00.<eos> Have you been working out?<eos> Oh, you noticed, huh?<eos> Nice.<eos> Yeah, I think the steroids are giving me acne.<eos> Hold that thought.<eos> On the up side, I've lost about an inch on my dick.<eos> So now it's straight.
No, she's not.<eos> She's been rehabilitated.<eos> Shut the fuck up and get your naked ass in the kitchen.<eos> Now grab the blender.<eos> That's right.<eos> Put in some yogurt and frozen fruit and some apple juice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now stick your dick in it and mix it up.<eos> You feel them fruit chunks crashing all up against your balls?<eos> Now get your cock in that hole right in the middle there where it su--
They want you on their team.<eos> Honey, it's fantastic!<eos> Congratulations!<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Danielle.<eos> Well, does she know you're crushing on her?<eos> - Who's Lucas?<eos> - Oh, my friend over there.<eos> - I'm starting a new job.<eos> - Who's it for?
Is this some kind of a joke?<eos> I-I brought in a ring.<eos> Not according to the ticket.<eos> You gave me that ticket 48 hours ago.<eos> Lot of people come through here in that time.<eos> I need that ring back today, so I need you to get back down there behind that counter and find it.<eos> Or what?<eos> You... want to call the police, talk to them about it?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> I can't believe that it's gone.
No. I-it's not that.<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> It'll be great.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you have your passport?<eos> It's- it's not mine.<eos> It's Ian's.<eos> I need it for the insurance claim on my ring.<eos> it still hasn't turned up?
Hi, Ezra Fitz. Nice to meet you.<eos> Good to see you, Elliott.<eos> Hey.<eos> Come in.<eos> Sorry I'm late.<eos> Uh, no, it's fine.<eos> Thanks.<eos> - A hockey stick?<eos> - Part of one.<eos> It was snapped off at the handle, and the blade was splintered, like somebody used it to hit something hard.
That's okay.<eos> Morgan's got it now, and he's doing surprisingly well, so...<eos> Chuck, what's wrong?<eos> The Intersect opened me up to big dreams.<eos> But in order for those dreams to become a reality, I need this business to succeed, and...<eos> You think the company doesn't work if you don't have the Intersect?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Chuck, I don't think that Dad wanted you to have the Intersect forever.<eos> And besides, you don't need it.<eos> The computer didn't make you a hero, it just gave you an opportunity to become one.
But I will.<eos> You realize that's libelous.<eos> Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.<eos> But after it runs, you and I both know it won't much matter.<eos> We're done here.<eos> I don't take to extortion.<eos> I'm not going to be bullied by an ambulance chaser, no matter how nice the suit.<eos> It is nice, isn't it?<eos> Italian.<eos> And it fits.
So, you think you'll look like a boy scout by putting dying people on the stand and tearing them apart.<eos> You're going to look like an asshole.<eos> For every one they claim has a side effect, we have 600 who don't.<eos> And if I need to look like an asshole to convince the jury that hundreds are more important than the one, I'm not going to lose a minute's sleep over it.<eos> Uh, I have court in... In the morning.<eos> Oh, I'm...<eos> I'm not clear. Was this a conversation with my Managing Partner or my client's ex-wife?<eos> You need to settle this case, Harvey.<eos> Which I will do if you stay out of it. As you promised.<eos> Make it go away.
You enjoy watching the Yankees destroy a little league team?<eos> David and Goliath happens to be one of my favorite stories.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll bite.<eos> What's in the bag?<eos> Hey, hey. What are you doing? Oh.<eos> Do you recognize this carpet?<eos> Make him get that out of here.<eos> This is your own carpet, Mr. Karinski.<eos> It's from Frank Carvello's apartment.
Penelope! What did I tell you about consorting with the help?<eos> You're dismissed.<eos> What?<eos> It's not my fault she tripped.<eos> Hey. Uh, you leaving already?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I was hoping we could talk more about the movie.<eos> What movie?<eos> It's dead.
By the way, I'm goin' fishing' this weekend.<eos> What? ! Why the hell am I just hearing about this now?<eos> Mike.<eos> Mike.<eos> Get up and go fishin'.<eos> Honey, not now.<eos> Get up.<eos> What? Get out of here and go fishin'.<eos> Oh, right, fishin'. Honey, I put a brochure in your tackle box from a reception hall near lake Geneva.<eos> I thought maybe you could check it out when you go up there.
Whenever you're trying to pass something off as a joke but it's actually profoundly true, you use that voice.<eos> I wish the Spice Girls would get back together. They were awesome.<eos> The worst.<eos> That was me.<eos> I totally cut one.<eos> That guy.<eos> Birthday present from my dad.<eos> All I really want is for him to tell me that he loves me. Just kidding.<eos> This pen's enough.<eos> It's not enough.
Fear not, for I can ease your mind, but it's gonna cost you something in return.<eos> No.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> What do you want?<eos> The name of your unborn child?<eos> - Absolutely not!<eos> - Deal!<eos> What do you know?<eos> The Queen has created a powerful curse.<eos> And it's coming.
I got faith.<eos> You will save me as I did you.<eos> What is it?<eos> Baby.<eos> She's coming.<eos> Wake up.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Look!<eos> The curse!<eos> It's here!
There's a receipt for a website. Whosyourmommaorg.<eos> It's expensive.<eos> He has a credit card?<eos> He's 10.<eos> Well, he used one.<eos> Let's pull up a transaction record.<eos> "Mary Margaret Blanchard." Who's Mary Margaret Blanchard?<eos> Henry's teacher.<eos> As we build our bird houses, remember, what you're making is a home, not a cage.<eos> A bird is free and will do what it will.
Hope.<eos> Believing in even the possibility of a happy ending is a very powerful thing.<eos> You know where he is, don't you?<eos> You might want to check his castle.<eos> I can't have this baby now!<eos> Doc, do something.<eos> It's gonna be okay.<eos> The wardrobe's almost finished.<eos> Just hold on.<eos> It's ready.
-Vince?<eos> -Rachel.<eos> Hi. -How are you?<eos> -Well, not as good as you obviously.<eos> -What's this about?<eos> -l'm getting married.<eos> -Shut up.<eos> -Really.<eos> This ring is pretty amazing.<eos> is it big enough?
-Rachel.<eos> Hi. -How are you?<eos> -Well, not as good as you obviously.<eos> -What's this about?<eos> -l'm getting married.<eos> -Shut up.<eos> -Really.<eos> This ring is pretty amazing.<eos> is it big enough?<eos> I wanna make sure it makes a statement.
'Cause like it or not, this baby is Eric's, too.<eos> What baby?<eos> (STUTTERS) Um.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> I gotta call my fucking daughter!<eos> -Whoops. -He didn't know, did he?<eos> -Nope.<eos> Chase, here's the ring from the window.<eos> It's 6.45 karats and costs $1 .4 million.

-No. -l could. -(LAUGHS)<eos> -l got you your own plane.<eos> -What are you talking about?<eos> What did you do?<eos> All I could.<eos> The rest is up to you.<eos> You got a plane that'll take you anywhere in the world.<eos> -What happens next...<eos> -Whatever it is,<eos> -don't tell us shit unless it's resolved.
- Help...<eos> - Hey.<eos> Are you listening to us?<eos> No.<eos> Well, you heard that, didn't you?<eos> You're gonna piss off the gods.<eos> I don't give a shit about the gods.<eos> Someone stealing our guns is a hiccup?<eos> Are you shitting me?<eos> They took the truck, thinking it was full of booze.
They made you kiss him.<eos> - What? - You were terrified, couldn't go there for three Christmases without becoming hysterical.<eos> I didn't think you'd be here this early.<eos> Why I came.<eos> I'm surprised you'd come at all.<eos> I'm here for Mother.<eos> And for Susan.<eos> They're all together now.<eos> Heaven?<eos> Even if it existed, do you actually think that son of a bitch would be there?
You telling me to go out and murder some clan boys?<eos> You're smarter than that.<eos> You have power, Chalky, economic power.<eos> In your house, you said your people were behind you.<eos> Thousands of black folks that make the city run, something like that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then do it, call a strike.<eos> In the middle of tourist season?<eos> It would shut the city down.<eos> It would cost a bloody fortune, and you hold all the cards.
Vince: What's your best memory of our relationship?<eos> - Um, what's this movie rated?<eos> - Cute.<eos> No, but we did have lots of nonsexual fun too, didn't we?<eos> Tons.<eos> I guess that's why I agreed to do this.<eos> Is he really going to show this movie to Sophia?<eos> Drama: I have to admit, even I find it to be a little creepy.<eos> Turtle: It's classier than it seems.
What are you doing?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Uh, can we talk for a second?<eos> - About?<eos> - About Galecki.<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> Okay well, he just booked a big movie.<eos> I don't care.<eos> It's based on a huge huge trilogy.
- Our blood, sweat and tears.<eos> - But no money?<eos> Not a dime.<eos> And we split all profits 50-50.<eos> - Well, that's-<eos> - So do we like?<eos> - We love.<eos> - What can you do on the price?<eos> You haven't even asked what the price is yet.<eos> I'm sure I need it reduced.
- What about the janitors' closet?<eos> No, man, I'm telling you, there's no printer.<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, the loading dock?<eos> How come we keep meeting in here?<eos> The copier's broken.<eos> No.<eos> The copier.<eos> Hey, does anybody actually know what's wrong with the copier?<eos> It's not working!
All right.<eos> It is disgraceful.<eos> This heartwarming... soulful beast... will never see... the light of day.<eos> I thank you from the bottom of my heart... friends.<eos> The hell's wrong with him?<eos> You erased the film off of his...<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, man, I uploaded a nasty virus into Gunter's digital-editing bay.<eos> It zapped every gigabyte of film he shot of us, except that.
Mozzie, what?<eos> It's the one man who wants Neal dead.<eos> Hey, Mozzie, what's going on?<eos> Keller's been posing as an Interpol agent.<eos> He met with Sara.<eos> What? She had no idea who he was.<eos> Is she okay?<eos> Yes, but she did give up the I.P. address.<eos> No. I reset the feed.<eos> Is it secure?
Your arrogance.<eos> Your greed.<eos> You're trapped.<eos> Nobody's coming, Neal.<eos> But what I can't understand is why you would sit on the treasure for so long.<eos> I mean, it seems to me you either sell it, you turn it in, or you run, right?<eos> Or the feds are on their way and I don't have it.<eos> You don't deserve it.<eos> You don't even have what it takes to hold on to it.<eos> You're not the only one who knows where it is.
- Managing Bill Forbes.<eos> Apparently he's impervious to compulsion.<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> But he threatened to out me.<eos> Don't get me started on the irony of that.<eos> What did you do to him?<eos> How do you know the compulsion doesn't work?<eos> That's not the most important piece of information I mentioned, Elena. - What does he want?<eos> - He wants to control the council.<eos> - Says it's been compromised. - It has!
He's at the Lockwoods.<eos> And he wants your body delivered to his doorstep.<eos> I'm afraid he's in for a colossal disappointment.<eos> Well, he's certainly not going to come here.<eos> I hope your plan didn't depend on that.<eos> Didn't depend on that.<eos> But you do have a plan.<eos> Right?<eos> Oh, yeah. We got a plan, right?<eos> It just doesn't involve you.
Here you go.<eos> Are you sure? I feel like an idiot.<eos> Oh, please. You're giving me all this vital knowledge.<eos> It's the least I can do.<eos> Okay, in that case, let me tell you how I got revenge for that little marker incident. Oh.<eos> You're here... still.<eos> Hey, what's that smell?<eos> Potpourri.<eos> I bought a few things.<eos> I mean, this place is nice, but it needed a woman's touch.
Can I speak to you for a moment?<eos> Later.<eos> Hey.<eos> I saw you race by my building.<eos> I didn't even realize you were coming to campus today.<eos> Oh, I had to.<eos> If I don't finish this thing, it doesn't get fired till next Friday.<eos> And here I was hoping you'd be at the Potter's wheel so I could wrap my arms around you and hum unchained melody.<eos> I've seen that movie.<eos> It ends sadly.
What were you looking for?<eos> I wasn't looking for anything.<eos> Well, then you went through an awful lot of trouble to get yourself in trouble.<eos> Mike, what is going on?<eos> - I said I don't wanna talk about it!<eos> - And I said we have to!<eos> So once again we're back on your schedule?<eos> Should I hurry up and talk fast before you move out again?<eos> What is this place?<eos> It belongs to Spencer's family.
Diablo fuge.<eos> Diablo fuge.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, Nick, help me, please!<eos> She's not possessed. Let her go.<eos> Possessed?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The demon's gone?<eos> From Melissa, but it needs a host.
Diablo fuge.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Stop!<eos> Oh, Nick, help me, please!<eos> She's not possessed. Let her go.<eos> Possessed?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The demon's gone?<eos> From Melissa, but it needs a host.<eos> It's in someone else. Someone in this room.
Good morning.<eos> Baking some things for Nick's wake tomorrow.<eos> Grandma, there was a guy in Nick's yard last night.<eos> It must have been his older brother Jake.<eos> I didn't even know Nick had a brother.<eos> Jake left town a couple years ago.<eos> He was a troubled young man back then.<eos> And now he's lost his brother.<eos> We bound that circle with no clue what we were doing, a-and look what's happened.<eos> Maybe it's for the best that it's broken now.
I have to.<eos> No, you don't. We are all bound together, and I know that's not something that you ever wanted, and, trust me, neither did I.<eos> But it's not something that you can run from.<eos> If you really knew me, you wouldn't want me to stay.<eos> I don't think that we have a choice. The bad is coming.<eos> They're here.<eos> It's what killed your brother and our parents and almost you tonight.<eos> We can't do this without you.<eos> We are not strong enough.<eos> And if we don't try, then Nick's death is gonna seem a lot more senseless than it already does.
Hello?<eos> It's from Crowley.<eos> Well, who feels like hog-tying death tonight?<eos> Old age is overrated anyhow.<eos> Well, we got most of this stuff, but we're gonna have to make a run for a few things.<eos> Like?<eos> Like "An act of God, crystallized forever."<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Thinking it means an actual crystal.<eos> See, lightning strikes sand at the right angle, it crystallizes into the perfect shape of itself.
Hello!<eos> First time at Good Graces?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, we're 100% locally sourced, biodynamic, and you get a free affirmation with every order.<eos> Think I'll source a taco joint.<eos> Just coffee, black, extra shot.<eos> You always wear a suit to get your palm read?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not surprised you caught this one.<eos> It's on every morning zoo in America.
No, I'd never do that to you.<eos> Promise.<eos> - I'm not stupid.<eos> - But you are special.<eos> I am?<eos> Hey, I wasn't thrilled to see your new hubby was Sam freaking Winchester.<eos> If he knew I was here talking to you, I mean, he'd probably...<eos> - Gank your ass.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I'm very protective of my ass. It's one of my best features.
I will get it.<eos> Shane's not involved.<eos> Well, he's asked about Pouncy House.<eos> It's my older son, Silas.<eos> What's his connection with them?<eos> He's just sleeping with some girl, Emma.<eos> She's the boss.<eos> Shane just blindly just follows his older brother.<eos> You asking for help?<eos> A call comes in, Alex takes a code, the code goes into the brain, where it becomes a sale.
- Oh, you think?<eos> - Why do we need a bear?<eos> - For protection. - Ohh!<eos> My face!<eos> See if you can keep her from destroying the place until I get there.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> She seems so sane and accountable.<eos> You keep it in a cage.<eos> It guards the drugs.

Then you could walk off with it.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> Put those on.<eos> You'd get 25% commission on all sales, which is 15% more than Pouncy forks over.<eos> In addition to your old routes, you're covering<eos> Morningside Heights west of the park, which is on another map.<eos> And that's Alex.<eos> He controls the brain.<eos> A call comes in, Alex takes a code, the code goes into the brain, where it becomes a human, an address, and then a sale.<eos> You get a new client, you give it to Alex, it goes in the brain.
I'm sorry, son.<eos> Aaron! Aaron!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Aaron! Aaron!<eos> Good boy, good boy.<eos> I know you're scared, but you need to let go of the organism. No...<eos> It's my friend.<eos> No.<eos> I'll be alone.<eos> I know you've come to believe that it's your friend, but it's not real.
Jolene Waite. I'm with the S.E.C. I don't like her.<eos> Any chance I could buy an eighth?<eos> I'm gonna need to smoke up.<eos> You got it.<eos> Who is that?<eos> That's my stepson.<eos> Tell him his dad wants to talk to him.<eos> I have cancer.<eos> What?<eos> It's in my pancreas.
Troubled by a past transgression and then pointing her elegant finger at your guy for poisoning children and then covering it up.<eos> That ball doesn't bounce.<eos> Look, I have no interest in shaming him out of office.<eos> I'd like to offer him a way to leave with a little dignity during this difficult time.<eos> If...?<eos> If he promises not to run again.<eos> To free it up for whom? You?<eos> No.<eos> I don't need to try that suit on.<eos> I know a bad fit by looking at it.
- Quid pro quo.<eos> - Are you gonna be around long enough for quid pro quo?<eos> The art of political survival-- One day at a time.<eos> You make it through one, then the next.<eos> String enough days together, people forget. They move on to newer matters.<eos> I need a breather--<eos> Just a little-<eos> - Through the gubernatorial primary.<eos> Well, there's a tower-- My tower.<eos> I've been operating a radio station from it. It has recently and quite suddenly been designated a Chicago landmark.
What happened to the goddamn deal?<eos> - I'll look into it. - What the fuck is going on around here?<eos> What about the old man's nurse?<eos> - We've got a lead. - Find her, Stoney, for God's sake.<eos> Mrs. Kane.<eos> Thank you for meeting me.<eos> I don't have long.<eos> I have only one question.<eos> Are you prepared for the wrath of my husband?<eos> Because it'll be unlike any you've ever felt before.
- What?<eos> I love a man in uniform.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> - I'm a friend.<eos> - I didn't ask to see you.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I know you were framed, Tony.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> Switch this with the one you have on now.<eos> It belongs to someone who's scheduled for release today.

I spent a lot of money on this.
That woman you brought here?<eos> I don't like what she or this book is doing to you.<eos> Thankfully, both are no longer an issue.<eos> What?<eos> Hey, how about that?<eos> Guess those rusty old innards finally straightened themselves out, huh?<eos> Yes.<eos> How about that, indeed.<eos> Did you know the honey crisp tree is the most vigorous and hardy of all apple trees?<eos> It can survive temperatures as low as 40 below and keep growing.

Weren't you about the same age when you were to be married before she ruined it all?<eos> Yes, you were.<eos> Yes, it was about the same age you were when that Sleeping Beauty got the best of you, my dear Maleficent.<eos> I soldiered on.<eos> As you will, too.<eos> Hopefully.<eos> Enough games.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> I need my curse back.<eos> It's not yours any more.
I don't want to talk to you.<eos> Miss Swan, if she knew you were here...<eos> To hell with her.<eos> Henry, there is one simple reason I stayed here.<eos> You.<eos> I wanted to get to know you.<eos> You think I'm crazy.<eos> No, I think the curse is crazy.<eos> And it is.<eos> But that doesn't mean that it isn't true.
You've been served.<eos> The cab driver who hit Ray named me as a witness in a civil suit.<eos> I need to pay Travis Bickle a visit.<eos> Harvey, if you let me go talk to Joy, I know I can fix this.<eos> No.<eos> You don't send a puppy to clean up its own mess.<eos> Optimally, you don't even have a puppy.<eos> Ross. Rumor has it you talked a client out of $200 million.<eos> The deal's not off the table, all right?<eos> It's just a speed bump.
For instance, I used to have to stand here and listen to this.<eos> But now, I'm thinking, "No."<eos> Hey, look at that. I'm getting pretty good at this "no" thing.<eos> It was bad enough when we weren't even trying to have sex, but to try and fail?<eos> Do you think it might have something to do with the stress Carlos is under?<eos> We're all under stress.<eos> You know what's stressful, is not having sex for 39 and a half days.<eos> You're sounding a little callous.<eos> I don't mean to. It's just, sex is important to us.<eos> Even in our toughest times, it's what always held us together.
- We're gonna be late!<eos> - Ready!<eos> On the count of three.<eos> One, two...<eos> Wait!<eos> Is there anything that we need to be prepared for?<eos> - Like what?<eos> - Deformity.<eos> I've heard that sometimes an arm can shrink up to a tenth of its size.<eos> It'll still function, it'll probably look normal in a year.
You look like you're having about as much fun as I am. I'm a little stressed.<eos> It's my anniversary.<eos> Well, it makes sense. A year's a long time.<eos> It's only been three months.<eos> People are watching.<eos> - What people? - Okay.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I had to take a leak. Oh.<eos> Well, come check this out.<eos> Lissa's dad got an electric eel, and when you tap the glass, it gets super pissed, and shocks the crap out of the angel fish.
But she said no.<eos> No, mom would never do that.<eos> This place is our family's heritage.<eos> Danny could get financing some other place.<eos> He's good at that stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right.<eos> Uh, one more quick question.<eos> What happened to the rug that was here, right?<eos> I mean, there it is in the picture.

Get up!<eos> Turn around.<eos> Now!<eos> Look, dumbasses.<eos> Do you know why you're losing?<eos> Do you know why you keep running?<eos> Let me tell you.<eos> That's because you don't know why you're fighting.<eos> This war will end in a week.<eos> When it does, we'll need you.
Each and every time.<eos> Now you're going for captain?<eos> Should I salute you?<eos> The war killed Sung-sik.<eos> That's bullshit, asshole!<eos> Excuse me?<eos> My arm will grow back when I grow up, right?<eos> I said no.<eos> It won't, will it?<eos> It will grow back, and I'll be normal again, right?
She's in the kitchen.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> That's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Burke?<eos> I'm Detective Sheppard.<eos> I'm very sorry for your loss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've dreaded this day for so long, and, well, here it is.
Are you sure?<eos> Of course!<eos> You're kind to say so<eos> Thanks for bringing me to the premiere<eos> During the movie, I saw people standing up<eos> I thought they were going to the washroom<eos> But they didn't come back<eos> They left because the movie isn't good<eos> They didn't want to meet the director afterwards<eos> It's not good?
What happened?<eos> It's done.<eos> How's he?<eos> All patched up.<eos> You guys need anything?<eos> We're good.<eos> I didn't know the drugs were gonna be part of the guns.<eos> Was that Clay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> The deal we had to make was... it was complicated.
I thought you weren't the jewelry type.<eos> What's that around your neck?<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Careful!<eos> It's a weapon.<eos> What, dust?<eos> What kind of weapon is dust?<eos> Fairy dust.<eos> I thought that was a good thing.<eos> When it comes from a good fairy.
Sheila's constant invitations to dinner every single morning.<eos> I'm running out of creative ways to say no.<eos> Have you tried running her over with your car?<eos> That's creative.<eos> [FAUCET SQUEAKING]<eos> And the hose is off.<eos> She's coming.<eos> She's coming.<eos> - My backpack.<eos> It's upstairs.
- ...before the announcement.<eos> - Cool.<eos> And still no one reads The Chatswin Chronicle.<eos> "Chronicle" is not even a word.<eos> It is a word.<eos> "Chronicle" sounds like something on the side of a boat.<eos> - You mean "barnacle"?<eos> - Maybe we should change the name.<eos> - It's obviously confusing some people.<eos> - Yeah, and also it's boring.
Louis, I do not respond to threats.<eos> I make them.<eos> So, if you ever want to be senior partner, you call your cousin.<eos> Now.<eos> All right.<eos> I don't need to see the results.<eos> I saw their faces.<eos> They did it.<eos> What happened to the letter?<eos> They made it seem like it didn't matter.
Hey.<eos> Almost done back there?<eos> I'm coming.<eos> Help me.<eos> Somebody, please.<eos> ♪<eos> You have a briefing on the new Impact Zone deployment, the Borough Presidents' meeting, and then your train leaves for Washington.<eos> I have printed out your remarks for the Senate hearing on gun violence.<eos> Did the report come in on the shooting out in Rockaway last night?<eos> It'll be here for you to review on the train to D.C.
Thad Castle is leaving the diner.<eos> I'm leaving now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was perfect, guys.<eos> And that's what the bastard gets for stealing my tips.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, what's going on?<eos> Your brother says he's retired from vagazzling.<eos> I have a three-headed dragon down there.<eos> It requires serious maintenance.
Yes, Uncle Lester...<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> You're scaring her.<eos> No.<eos> Okay? And what are you doing?<eos> Are you trying to kill yourself?<eos> I'm just taking off the exhaust pipe, trying to squeeze a few more horses out of the beast.<eos> Ever hear of carbon monoxide, hmm, guys?<eos> Can't leave your engine running.<eos> No, he has to leave the engine running or he can't start it up again.
Wasting all your capital on boob jobs, huh?<eos> It's a cleft lip.<eos> I'm changing a kid's life today.<eos> Look at Kepner, she's fixing a bum knee.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Way to shoot for the stars, kid.<eos> Okay, guys.<eos> Uh, you also start teaching skills labs today.<eos> I made up a schedule for the month.<eos> It's up on the board in my office.
I don't know.<eos> I thought you were teaching my skills lab.<eos> I am.<eos> I just left them to practice whipstitches.<eos> Alex...<eos> Stop.<eos> Turn out the lights.<eos> Close the door.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Injected fluorescein dye... it makes any viable part of the bowel glow.
Nobody knows.<eos> They're a secret organization dedicated to killing us.<eos> You mean Grimms?<eos> There are more like us?<eos> Yes, but I don't have contact with them.<eos> What about the things I've been seeing?<eos> How many more of those are there?<eos> There are more in the books than I've ever seen.<eos> You must not let the trailer be found.<eos> They don't know it exists.
What was it about, anyway?<eos> I'm not really supposed to talk about it, Jess.<eos> Not even a little?<eos> I can't.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How's your tea?<eos> Good.<eos> Yorkshire Gold.<eos> Your favorite.<eos> It's perfect.
(CROWD MURMURING ANGRILY)<eos> We refuse to support the coronation of another Mon Cala king.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Ambassador?<eos> It is my opinion the Quarren have no further business here.<eos> (CROWD SPEAKING LOUDLY)<eos> Come on, Captain Ackbar, we have to contact Master Yoda.<eos> Your father was my trusted friend.<eos> I am sorry for your loss.<eos> This civil war, is it inevitable?
Dad's got black toilets.<eos> You wanna see them?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I've seen enough.<eos> Okay.<eos> So when I multiply these fractions...<eos> Okay, sweetie, I love you.<eos> - Oh, that's different.<eos> What does this mean to you?<eos> Loneliness, isolation, not long ago, this tree was lush and green, but now it's, uh, lost its leaves, and winter's ahead.

She said Karl's never been the same.<eos> It's weird, huh?<eos> You know, luck.<eos> Winning that ticket was bad for Karl, but great for me.<eos> I went to Rome last week.<eos> I flew there on a private jet.<eos> That must have cost a couple of bucks.<eos> It cost a hell of a lot more than my lion, that's for sure.<eos> Why would you buy a lion?<eos> It's the king of the jungle.
- You should be cashing in on this too.<eos> GEORGE:<eos> I'm an architect.<eos> Frightened people rarely add bonus rooms.<eos> Mm, but what about panic rooms?<eos> "Inside Celebrity Panic Rooms." Seriously?<eos> - You have a subscription to this?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Check out Bono's safe room.<eos> It doubles as a recording studio.

I told you we would.<eos> I was so afraid.<eos> I was so afraid that we'd fail, that... I'd have to go back to that life, that... That terrible life.<eos> As long as I'm alive, you will never go back to that life.<eos> Now... how is our little Alexandra?<eos> Alexandra?<eos> Did I not mention that I picked out a name?<eos> A name?<eos> That's more like a prison sentence.<eos> Well, I like it. Mm.
You've been restored to full duty.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Heard you need a little backup.<eos> Oh.<eos> Look who got out of the penalty box again.<eos> Yep. Except now, it's official.<eos> I kind of liked you<eos> - in the office, you know. - Oh, you like my coffee, huh?<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> It's always nice and hot.
- Push us, come on.<eos> Push us. Push us.<eos> Come on, you know you want to.<eos> No, I don't!<eos> Gah!<eos> Okay, let's just think.<eos> If we're all seeing the same bizarre things, something must be overlaying a holographic environment.<eos> Vincent's using a holographic projector on main street for something...<eos> It may have malfunctioned.<eos> It must be interacting with the photon generator.
Exactly.<eos> Sorry if we ruined your Christmas. No, added some excitement is all.<eos> You really love this time of year, don't you?<eos> Maybe a little too much.<eos> I know what you mean.<eos> Sometimes I get so preoccupied making sure everything's perfect, I forget the best part of the holidays is having the people we love together in one place.<eos> I think I'm guilty of that, too.<eos> What...is...<eos> Giant snow ninja.<eos> And it's heading for Eureka.
We used to call this routine "The Routine."<eos> That's very creative.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Chuck has quite a reputation as a hacker, you know?<eos> They used to call him "The Piranha."<eos> Swordfish, right?<eos> The movie is based on him.<eos> He doesn't like to talk about it 'cause he doesn't think it was a A-plus film.<eos> Why?<eos> I thought it was pretty good.
Now these monsters are petrified 'cause I can take their tech away at any moment.<eos> That sounds like a good plan.<eos> I know.<eos> All right, I'll see you in the yard.<eos> Please let me go. This is a mistake.<eos> Look, um, I promise you we're not gonna hurt you.<eos> We just need to wait for the chip to... you know, complete its journey, and then you can go free.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world.<eos> It could wipe out everything.
Well, you shoot him.<eos> Cut his ties.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Got a horse outside waiting for you.<eos> Any of y'all thinking about coming after me best get fitted for a shroud and a box.<eos> Just climb on the sumbitch and hang on.<eos> Sure is a stupid-looking spud muncher, ain't he?<eos> Some respect for the dead, Mr. Bolan.<eos> In the end, when all is said and done, all we really own is our death.<eos> It is given us the moment we is born, and we carry that burden the best we can.
No, he's here, but he's remotely controlling a teen girl at the dance who's about to get sex-pummeled by your son.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> It's a lot like Avatar.<eos> Like what?<eos> Avatar.<eos> It's a movie?<eos> Okay, okay, so there's this guy in a wheelchair, and he goes to this alien planet to join a program...<eos> So you pick a dragon and get to keep it forever?<eos> No, it picks you.
Come over for dinner.<eos> I'm married, but most people get divorced these days.<eos> Come on.<eos> Ooh, yeah, here we are.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Klaus, I just had the luckiest day.<eos> My hair was perfect, we had French bread pizza at lunch, and the old black janitor said to me, and I quote,<eos> "You lookin' fly.<eos> Go get it now."<eos> Hard to believe the day turned out so great, considering it started with me accidentally putting on Hayley's panties.
Unemployed?<eos> !<eos> Why don't you call the cops like you did on Christmas?<eos> !<eos> I-I-I didn't call them!<eos> They were called!<eos> Oh, now you're calling me a liar in front of this cat?<eos> !<eos> I got another cat.<eos> Aw, that yellow lab looks like it's dying.
Hey, how much money you make?<eos> You'd think enough for a shirt, right?<eos> So I'm having this housewarming thing tonight, and I'd love it if you came by.<eos> Anything beats what goes on at my house Friday nights.<eos> Hey, Lois, what's going on here?<eos> Oh, it's my book club, Peter.<eos> Come join us.<eos> Oh, okay!<eos> All right, let's see, new novel, new novel, new novel.<eos> What's it about?

Just don't tickle me in my lower abdomen. I'm super ticklish there.<eos> Lower abdomen.<eos> You're gonna wish you never said that.<eos> This might be totally off the wall, but are you doing anything Thursday night?<eos> You probably have plans, anyway. You know what...<eos> Forget it, forget it, forget it.<eos> Nervous.<eos> You know, Ryan, most people take one look at me and just assume that I have plans, so I never get asked out.<eos> But I-I frequently don't have plans, so yes, I would love to do something with you on Thursday night. Yes!<eos> Oh, my God, right now would be the worst time for you to tickle my lower abdomen, because it's so exposed 'cause I'm cheering.
What the hell is going on up there?<eos> Well, I'm sorry you all feel the way you do.<eos> But I walked away from an illegal war of aggression being fought 6,000 miles away from our shores.<eos> Better there than here where all my stuff is.<eos> So, what, you figured you'd just let 'em get away with 9/11?<eos> Mr. Griffin, Iraq had nothing to do with 9/11.<eos> And the war we started in Iraq has killed a half a million of their people, which is like 200 9/11's.<eos> So, I guess those moments of silence we had at those sporting events meant nothing to you.<eos> I'm just saying this war is wrong.<eos> Son, your job isn't to decide whether it's right or wrong.
Jack and Emily sitting in a tree. Really?<eos> Kinda.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> It worked.<eos> You smiled.<eos> Are you always in a good mood?<eos> Yeah, when I, uh, when I see you.<eos> Your ring's pretty girlie, don't you think? Uh, this?<eos> Yeah. Uh...<eos> This was my mother's, and I'm gonna go see how much it's worth.
It's about time.<eos> That's funny. That's what I was thinking on the way over here.<eos> Hi.<eos> These are from Sammy, as a way of saying thank you for bringing him home last week...<eos> Twice.<eos> Well, that's very nice of Sammy, but... Oh.<eos> You're in the middle of something.<eos> Yes, I am in the middle of something, and that happens to be an exceptionally good bottle of Pinot.<eos> Do you drink wine?<eos> Well, when it's exceptional, sure. Cheers.
Only now mine's my guardian.<eos> So what happened to your mom?<eos> She left.<eos> When I was, like, 2.<eos> I don't even remember her.<eos> Jack does, but he doesn't talk about her.<eos> I don't know, maybe that's what kept me from hocking her ring.<eos> Like some stupid part of me thinks she's gonna come back for it.<eos> Can I see it?<eos> Well, if it matters, you wouldn't have gotten much for it.

It's priceless to you, and that's so much more important.
Great.<eos> We're good to go then.<eos> You sound jazzed.<eos> Better than last night, anyway.<eos> I was weaned on inter-agency noncooperation.<eos> Nothing makes me happier than seeing the FBI stand around with their dicks in their hands, watching us work.<eos> Lovely.<eos> They're ready to trace the call.<eos> If it's even him.<eos> It will be.
But silent.<eos> Being a dutiful son, I did precisely as they asked.<eos> Happily?<eos> What do you think?<eos> I was a kid.<eos> I just wanted to play ball, I wanted to be in the pageant.<eos> I'd gladly say their prayers, sing the songs.<eos> I just wanted to not be alone.<eos> Man, I hated this place.<eos> It was the reason I was different... strange... isolated.
This is such good news.<eos> No, we're a little on edge because Lily has been acting out, like she doesn't want a sibling-<eos> Yeah, because Mitchell taught her to hate sharing.<eos> And, or, because Cam wears her like a fanny pack.<eos> Oh, stop blaming each other.<eos> No kid wants a sibling.<eos> I mean, Claire hated you so much, she stuck you in a dryer when you were two.<eos> You put me in the dryer? I did.<eos> But it wasn't 'cause I hated you.<eos> My friend Marcie said that it wouldn't run with a kid inside it, and I knew it would.
I was out celebrating with Fallon.<eos> Yes, congratulations.<eos> A stroke of luck.<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> Really?<eos> What's that?<eos> The mistrial...<eos> I had nothing to do with Neary's suicide, Margaret.<eos> I believe you.<eos> Look, I'd be lying if I said it didn't benefit me.
Ugh, but it made me feel so good though.<eos> I'd wake up.<eos> I was like having sex with this girl for like 11 minutes in my dream.<eos> It's time to invite Blackwell to play.<eos> Yeah, have you seen Alex and the guys?<eos> They are in no shape to play football.<eos> They'll play.<eos> God told me so.<eos> I can picture this joint already.<eos> It's gonna be like a huge zeppelin.
I'm going to go to Keller.<eos> I think I've found something.<eos> Mr. Reese?<eos> I told you I'd handle it.<eos> I've got them both.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> You never did tell me your name.<eos> John.<eos> My name's John.<eos> Of course it is. So, John...
Mr. Keller, sorry I'm late.<eos> Sorry I started without you, Mr. Partridge, But when you're as old as I am, you can't waste a minute.<eos> What's your poison?<eos> What are we doing here?<eos> You want your report, right? He's right over there.<eos> You want me to go get it or you?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I don't think you emailed that report to anybody at all.<eos> In fact, I think it's been right here all along.
Correct.<eos> I need Kochenko dead.<eos> As it turns out, so do you... he's the face of Zetrov.<eos> If he were eliminated, his boss would be forced to make more public appearances.<eos> Kochenko's boss is Sergei Semak.<eos> You'd be one step closer. All you have to do is end Kochenko's life.<eos> Something tells me...<eos> "Defy your masters and stand up."<eos> That is Ramon's call to arms, he claims... learned in his early days as a basque separatist.<eos> But residents here are asking themselves, can his call ever be heard when the only sound it makes is misery and chaos?
He was devastated when his favorite girl went rogue.<eos> - You got religion.<eos> - You sold out.<eos> My fight hasn't changed.<eos> In the past two days, I've kept a Russian company from getting too much power in this hemisphere.<eos> Oh, you really are Percy's bitch, aren't you?<eos> Thanks to you, I didn't really have a choice.<eos> In fact, Percy made it for me.<eos> This key opens more than just those handcuffs.<eos> It opens the door to a whole new life.
All I can see are those little white dots you see when you close your eyes.<eos> Let's try this again.<eos> You took the train? Hey.<eos> I would've picked you up, man.<eos> No problem.<eos> How are ya?<eos> Good... in my new ride.<eos> Ooh, nice.<eos> You like it?<eos> It's yours.
IN LOVE<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello, love.<eos> How are you?<eos> ETA:<eos> AN END TO VIOLENCE?<eos> Bixente!<eos> So, then.<eos> - Did you like my article?<eos> - It was very faithful.
Your relationship with Bixente Arrosteguy was clearly somewhat privileged.<eos> How did you know him?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You seem well-informed.<eos> You didn't appear anywhere in the file, until today.<eos> Miss Gorrigan, it's possible, even probable, that ETA assassinated Arrosteguy themselves.<eos> For reasons you can easily imagine.<eos> - Because of my article?<eos> - No, no.<eos> It came out this morning.
We've got a lot of things.<eos> Bosiger is looking for you.<eos> Aw, a rabbit.<eos> Can I give it a leaf<eos> - Get lost!<eos> Why are you so mean to me?<eos> Go away!<eos> It's so cute!<eos> Where did you get it?<eos> Does it have a name?
Yes.<eos> Yes, very much so.<eos> Hey, where are you guys going?<eos> !<eos> Tennis house-- huge bash.<eos> Seriously?<eos> You're just gonna let them go?<eos> Stop them!<eos> If you love a butterfly, you'll let it fly.<eos> And it'll fly as far as it can fly until it can't fly anymore.
You ready for a little bit of trivia?<eos> Royal blue and chrome bumpers. Collectors call that model right there the most desirable mg ever made.<eos> - Impressed?<eos> Of course, yes, I remember her.<eos> She came in...<eos> I'd say it was after 11:00. I was in the kitchen pulling up some biscuits for breakfast and I heard the bell ring, so I went and got the door.<eos> Oh, excuse me a minute.<eos> I've got your bill right here.<eos> Hope everything was to your liking. Oh, Billy, we just love this place.<eos> It's so magical.
Hey I'm Chuck. Here are a few things that might need to know or maybe you just forgot.<eos> - Why'd you bring us here?<eos> - I need you to do a job for me.<eos> We've been tracking a computer super virus named the "Omen."<eos> Bring it back to me, Mr. Casey goes free.<eos> The virus is too dangerous to be released into the world!<eos> It could wipe out everything.
You mean all the computers.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Sarah, it's the Omen virus.<eos> It's affecting our entire system.<eos> It's not just our system.<eos> That is the Internet. That is everybody.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This is all my fault.<eos> I let it out, and now the code is digging in.<eos> It's... it's hiding in every networked computer in the world-- just waiting.
Quickly...<eos> Ah, a toilet!<eos> Oh no...!<eos> TOILET<eos> What a dump!<eos> I dont want to use this toilet!<eos> I can't stand it...<eos> It feels so different from usual.<eos> My belly...<eos> It's moving.
A nice and fresh Nekurogedoro.<eos> Try swallowing it.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's in my stomach now.<eos> As soon as the new one is in, the old one has to come out.<eos> And we have a medicine for that.<eos> Get ready, Sachi.<eos> Here we go.<eos> It's so hot, father.<eos> My belly feels like it's burning.
Pull yourself together and be a man!<eos> My stomach hurts, but I'm going to make it. Promise!<eos> I will smash your heads in!<eos> Take this and that!<eos> You pig!<eos> From the ass? !<eos> I can't believe it!<eos> That ass is loaded!<eos> Fuck you, you ass monsters!<eos> It's stuck!
Never...<eos> As long as I'm still human... Kill me...<eos> Hurry...<eos> Hurry up...<eos> Aya...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I couldn't save you.<eos> You were the one, who saved me.<eos> My body...<eos> It's burning...
You would rather die, am I right?<eos> Alright.<eos> This can't be...<eos> Let's go!<eos> No...<eos> Don't...<eos> No!<eos> This is the end.<eos> The tentacle in your body will expand and kill you.<eos> It's out!
Yeah, or religious freedom.<eos> - Or political dissent.<eos> - Please don't.<eos> The only thing he treats worse than the people is you.<eos> You know if I could change any of that I would.<eos> What if you could?<eos> Change that?<eos> Jonathan, we really are going to be late.<eos> My name is not Jonathan.<eos> It's Michael.
Sore knee, but Medical's cleared me.<eos> Get prepped on Cold Shadow.<eos> I read the ConOps on that mission.<eos> They're doing a good thing.<eos> - Good for them.<eos> - So it doesn't matter if they're right?<eos> - I don't believe in Division.<eos> - What do you believe in'! What're you looking for, my moral compass?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - It points to Sergei Semak.
Gordon Ramsay!<eos> You (bleep) it up, big blue, didn't you?<eos> Why did you invite Homer?<eos> He stole your bloody thunder.<eos> You're not as fun as him, and you never will be.<eos> Darling, darling, crying's not fun.<eos> Homer's fun.<eos> Now, get out of my dream.<eos> It's my dream.<eos> Not anymore it's not.
Don't worry.<eos> I told them I got attacked by some chola on Melrose who wanted my Chanel.<eos> Couldn't tell them I went to your house to score coke, could I?<eos> I had to file a fake police report and everything. How deep are the cuts?<eos> Deep.<eos> God, and I-I can't stop thinking about that mouth.<eos> It was a mask.<eos> He was purposely trying to terrorize you.<eos> That hat doesn't look like you.<eos> It serves a purpose.
Cam, what's this scribbled on the Vanity Fair about an adoption agency?<eos> Oh, yeah, they called to say they wanted to reschedule our home visit.<eos> When?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> This is kind of important.<eos> Well, when does it say?<eos> Uh, who knows? It disappears into Jennifer Aniston's hair.<eos> You gotta get a better system.<eos> There is nothing wrong with my system.<eos> Ask me anything about any upcoming event, and I can tell you when and where it is.
I've been thinking that maybe that I should-<eos> Alex has been Skyping with her boyfriend since you left.<eos> That's so not true!<eos> Thank you, really.<eos> Thank all of you so much for your help.<eos> Really?<eos> Sometimes those things need to warm up, like a car.<eos> Phil, don't even!<eos> I have been out there trying to do something good for our community ... because, let me tell you, change doesn't just happen.<eos> It is forged by empowered women ... like me and Norma Rae and the lady from The Blind Side.
Well, did your day get any better?<eos> Yes, if you count the fried chicken sandwich I got in the cafeteria.<eos> Any interesting cases tomorrow?<eos> Meredith.<eos> No work talk.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Why didn't you tell Derek about Mary's tumor?<eos> I-I-I did.<eos> He said it was inoperable.
I...<eos> Not until you read my research.<eos> Dr. Bailey!<eos> Read my research.<eos> Hey, that kinda works.<eos> Okay, I've cleared out the tumor on the right side of the brain, but look.<eos> See all those vessels blocking the way now?<eos> It's like a line of defense.<eos> That's why the tumor's so smart.<eos> It grows on both sides of the brain so we'll be too scared to cross over.
Thanks, Will.<eos> It's all good, Mr. Burton.<eos> You're the best teacher I've got.<eos> Charlie...<eos> Can you make it to the service stairs?<eos> I'll try, but the painkiller sort of wore off.<eos> Why don't you just use the old entrance?<eos> They closed it down a few years ago.<eos> - The stairs got all rotted.<eos> - Where is it?
Sir, if I may address your accusation, I followed your orders.<eos> Even in the face of a plan, that was, in my opinion, severely flawed.<eos> A plan that cost us men.<eos> Not clones! Men!<eos> As sure as it is my duty to remain loyal to your command, I also have another duty. To protect those men.<eos> You have a spark of tenacity, Captain.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> I know that I don't command like the Jedi you're used to serving, certainly not like General Skywalker, but I have my way.<eos> It may be difficult, but these are difficult times.<eos> And it's proven effective.
Avoid them the other way!<eos> Artoo, do something!<eos> Get us out of here!<eos> They're right behind us!<eos> We've been hit! Ah!<eos> Right on target!<eos> Well done, Artoo.<eos> (ALARMS RINGING)<eos> Oh, no!<eos> The reactor was hit, it's shutting down.
The human body is designed to compensate for lose<eos> It does,so it no longer needs the things that can't have.
Who wants in on it?<eos> Hello!<eos> That's more like it.<eos> Uh,Mark Sloan,plastics.<eos> Isn't penile reconstruction the standard approach in cases like these?<eos> Why a-a transplant?<eos> Well,I can answer your question with a question.<eos> Do you like your penis?<eos> Yes.<eos> It does the job.

They didn't know that to look for. Excactly,because she should've been with us.<eos> And she's not,and that's my fault.<eos> And I may never sleep another night again because of that, But if there's a prayer of us getting her back, we have to just do our I's and cross our T's, not mess with the rules.<eos> Arizona is a great surgeon.<eos> Please don't make it worse.<eos> What is your plan on fixing this?<eos> It's just kinked.<eos> Once I get in there,and I remove the adhesions. And I fix the obstruction,the shunt will be fine.<eos> If it's not?<eos> What if it's disconnected or broken?
CLONE:<eos> Incoming!<eos> Incoming!<eos> Get down, get down!<eos> If you could capture that airbase, it will sever the capital's supply lines allowing the rest of our forces to move in.<eos> I'll see to it that the airbase is placed under our control.<eos> Remember, General Krell, the entire invasion depends on your battalion.<eos> Captain Rex, have those coordinates mapped and all troops ready to move out immediately!<eos> Yes, General!<eos> There's a base there, all right, and it's heavily guarded.
I can name four or five different times...<eos> No, no, no, I-I know, I know, it's just,<eos> I'm worried that we won't be prepared if something goes wrong, but if you're here in Castle, I guess we'll be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kind of a bummer about the timing, though. I was supposed to have game night with Ellie and Awesome.<eos> Alex said she was gonna come by, too, and... I still don't know where her and I stand.<eos> Wait, wait, why do you have to cancel?<eos> You don't have to cancel game night. Have game night in Castle.<eos> Ellie and Awesome have wanted to check it out more anyway.<eos> Ever since that last mission, they keep asking me tactical questions and using the term "ghost op" as if they know what it means.
I'm in.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Yeah, I changed my mind, too.<eos> You can't come.<eos> Everybody else, we're moving out.<eos> That's harsh.<eos> You know what else is harsh?<eos> Ultraviolet light.<eos> I fell asleep in the tanning bed this week and I think I got a sunburn on my cheek.<eos> It's so sensitive.

Ladies and gentlemen, the ham.<eos> It looks lovely.
I hope I haven't upset you, speaking my mind so directly.<eos> Just a pinch of the sea salt... a tiny squeeze of lemon if you like... although I prefer without.<eos> And, ma'am, I've left the pancreas uncooked.<eos> They say it's the tenderest organ of them all, especially when eaten raw.<eos> Uh, no, I don't think so, Moira.<eos> Think of the baby.<eos> I don't think I can do this.<eos> Have you been doing the exercises we talked about? Looking in the bathroom mirror at home?<eos> Yeah, but I cheated.<eos> I used my toaster. It has a very reflective surface.
There are a lot of minority men in this city who would like nothing more than to ravage me on this counter top.<eos> Get out.<eos> Put the gun down, Marcy.<eos> I don't like guns.<eos> I hope you're permitted for that, as I will be mentioning it in my lawsuit.<eos> What you're doing is in direct violation of The Americans with Disabilities Act.<eos> And this is the library.<eos> Oh... that's... that's quite a fireplace.<eos> I'm very interested in that fireplace.<eos> Does it work?
Since when?<eos> Do not screw up selling this house.<eos> Hello.<eos> Moira is it?<eos> How did I know you'd be back?<eos> I haven't been able to get this house out of my mind.<eos> Mrs. Harmon is out.<eos> But I'd be happy to show you whatever you want to see.<eos> As you can see, this room belongs to a sad, depressed teenager.<eos> But it has real potential.
It's extremely rare.<eos> Maybe one in a million.<eos> Your wife must have had intercourse with two different men during the same ovulation cycle, within a 48-hour period.<eos> Where is she?<eos> Little slut.<eos> Who?<eos> Violet.<eos> She's been catting around with my dog walker.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> The girl's taste in men is hardly refined, but I doubt it runs to rough trade.
Yeah, the engine looks clean.<eos> What's he asking for it?<eos> $8,000.<eos> That's a good price.<eos> And look at this back seat.<eos> It's practically a hide-a-bed.<eos> Oh yeah, you put in a toilet and a hot plate and it's an efficiency apartment.<eos> What kind of gas mileage does it get?<eos> Only about six Miles to the gallon.<eos> But it's got a 30-gallon tank.
Do I get to keep the car?<eos> Just so you know, I already deposited the check.<eos> I'll deal with you later. Shame on you for taking advantage of this candy-sneaking bonehead.<eos> All right, if we're just going to resort to childish name-calling,<eos> I'm out of here.<eos> And I don't care what you say, that car completes me.<eos> I can't believe he bought that car from you behind my back.<eos> In his defense, $7,800 is a great deal for that classic automobile.<eos> $7,800?<eos> He told me $7,250. Boy, every time he opens his mouth, a lie falls out of it, huh?
I'm gonna need to see that.<eos> Doesn't the school have a cell phone? Mm-mmm.<eos> Goes against their policy, remember?<eos> So is playing favorites.<eos> You know, a man like Massey sets rules but is the first to break them.<eos> He's been left alone to run these kids' lives and nobody questions him.<eos> Oh, man, that sounds so sad and scary when you put it like that.<eos> His policies are a combination of many other philosophies.<eos> I'm not sure where his actual leadership lies.<eos> Only that it does... Lie, that is.
It's hearsay.<eos> - We can't cross-examine a corpse.<eos> - Really, Mr. Roda?<eos> I'm sorry, Your Honor.<eos> Inelegantly put.<eos> But I can't cross-examine the deceased.<eos> Your Honor, Rule 212 expressly permits the use of a recorded deposition when a witness dies.<eos> But only if the court, in its discretion, determines it won't do a substantial injustice, such as in the case of perjury.<eos> Which is why, in the current matter, I would direct the court's attention to Mr. Ritter's suicide note.<eos> It consists of two lines.
- Yes, next week. Uncle Klaus!<eos> - The weather is not so nice, it can rain and...<eos> My weather station forecasts dry weather for the whole week.<eos> All right then.<eos> Did you disjoint your back?<eos> I shake my breakfast into the right intestine.<eos> It's the thing you have to do before a journey.<eos> - Hooray!<eos> Now we have to follow them closely.<eos> When your socks get wet, then it is best to dry them over a fire, and when you've got a pebble in your shoe then stand on your head for a while, and it will fall out.
I'll take my backpack.<eos> It was fascinating.<eos> Thank you...<eos> Matilda!<eos> See you.<eos> Tralla-lalla laa...<eos> Excuse me, I am looking for a backpack.<eos> Young man, you're not in a hikers' club.<eos> But there was a backpack here, I saw it.<eos> - Was, and now it's gone.
- I'm Lotte, uncle Klaus sent me to see you.<eos> Come, let's fly together!<eos> - But I can't.<eos> Dream world is lovely!<eos> In the dream world you can do anything that you want.<eos> I love flying, that's why I'm sleeping all the time!<eos> We're looking for the red stone that you found on your journey.<eos> I gave it to penguins!<eos> This stone was very troublesome.<eos> It started to glow every time when the moon was in the sky at night. I couldn't fly any more!
Or maybe you say to yourself,<eos> "I feel so guilty about what I did."<eos> I-I-I don't...<eos> I mean, who... who is that?<eos> The guy in your painting.<eos> The one in the grave.<eos> No.<eos> Uh, uh, no. That came from my imagination.<eos> Bull.<eos> It's him.
Hey, Steph.<eos> Um, just out of curiosity, were you really gonna sleep with me or were you setting me up again?<eos> I was really gonna sleep with you.<eos> Then I was gonna tell everyone that you have a small dick to mess with your head for the game.<eos> Loser.<eos> That's what I thought.<eos> Be seeing you.<eos> Hey, I'll see you on the field?<eos> Does a whale shit in the ocean?<eos> Not if it's at seaworld.
What are you wearing?<eos> Well, you know, it's Comic Con.<eos> I'm Lion-O from ThunderCats.<eos> Wow, you must have gotten so laid.<eos> No.<eos> But Jessica Alba did rub my furry belly.<eos> Want to see a comic I draw?<eos> You're kidding.<eos> You have your own book?<eos> Yeah. It's kinda based on my life.
IMDb.<eos> See you soon, man.<eos> That was tragic.<eos> The students here mean well, they really do.<eos> But what Greendale has always needed is a miracle.<eos> This is it.<eos> This is how I get to put Greendale on the map.<eos> You know, I thought this commercial was going to be okay.<eos> Well, guess what?<eos> It just officially became great.
Why would he choose himself as the champion?<eos> Because he's Arthur.<eos> He'll always risk his own life before those of his men.<eos> Trust me, it's no trick, Arthur WILL fight.<eos> It's as if you were pleased, Morgana.<eos> Whatever else he is, Arthur is a great warrior.<eos> YOU have as much to lose as I if he wins.<eos> You desire the throne of Camelot, do you not?<eos> I don't deny it.<eos> It's rightfully mine after all.
I can tell.<eos> I know you think that we have this connection, but maybe... It's because I happened to be the person who saved your life?<eos> So... why don't we leave it at that?<eos> Next time, make sure I'm really dead.<eos> Well done.<eos> "Well done"?<eos> There's an understatement.<eos> You see what my son did to that brute?<eos> He just killed the unkillable.<eos> Ahh, a valiant feat, for sure, but it is still just a man.
My price for that was a pittance.<eos> But now that she's gone, well, I assume that conceiving another heir... is out of the question, - ... let alone a dragon slayer.<eos> - Then let's do another deal.<eos> Bring him back.<eos> I need my son to do this.<eos> I'll give you anything.<eos> - Anything?<eos> - What do you want?<eos> There's a magic wand I desire.<eos> It belongs to a certain fairy godmother who's patron to your family.
You mean, "go to bed" go to bed, or... - ...go to bed?<eos> - Whatever you want.<eos> Why don't we just... sit and talk some more?<eos> This... isn't right.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Didn't see that coming, did you?<eos> Mother, how was the market?<eos> It was... interesting.
I can't have everything.<eos> Oh, my boy.<eos> My sweet, sweet boy.<eos> - Give this to your wife-to-be.<eos> - No, mother.<eos> I don't love her.<eos> I don't even know her.<eos> That... I can't take this.<eos> Just because you don't know her, doesn't mean you won't grow to love her.<eos> True love follows this ring wherever it goes, my son.
What's going on?<eos> What's really going on?<eos> It's my heart, Emma.<eos> I need to find it.<eos> Okay.<eos> So how are you gonna do that?<eos> I just need to follow the wolf.<eos> What? What wolf?<eos> From my dreams.<eos> It's gonna help me find my heart.
You're 16. Plenty of time to make money.<eos> Wanting to build a connection with your dad and pass on some of the joy that he gave you, that's not stupid at all.<eos> I got it.<eos> Is, uh, is this because of the medication?<eos> Is it normal?<eos> It's not normal, and it's not Sjogren's.<eos> T.I.A., thickened pericardium, and now he's bleeding from his nose and mouth.<eos> "Her"?<eos> Surely this bundle of fun has an actual name.<eos> It's Sophie.
The moon keeps Earth steady.<eos> Its gravitational pull prevents the planet from wobbling, saving us from wild climate swings.<eos> And the collision that formed the moon leaves Earth tilted on its axis, giving the planet a key ingredient to life, seasons.<eos> Having seasons is very, very important for the evolution of life on the Earth, and having some stability in the tilt of those axes, that's very, very important also for maintaining life on the Earth.<eos> The moon's gravity also begins to slow Earth's rotation, which will eventually lengthen our days from six hours to 24.<eos> 4.4 billion years ago. It's too hot on Earth for liquid water to exist, but there's water vapor, steam in the atmosphere.<eos> The trick is how to get it out of the sky.<eos> Onto any world where you hope to have life, a little rain must fall.<eos> For millions of years as the planet cools, rain pours down, forming puddles, lakes, and eventually our oceans.<eos> By 3.8 billion years ago, our planet has a moon and permanent oceans, but it hardly resembles the place we now call home.
Like our infant universe, the first life is small, simple, and full of possibilities.<eos> The secret of how it explodes into all of the incredible forms we see today, including us, goes back to the beginning of time.<eos> As we've seen, all the energy that will ever exist was created in the Big Bang.<eos> All creatures need to grab their share of this energy to survive.<eos> The more we harness, the more efficiently we use it, the more complex we can become.<eos> And almost all of our share of the Big Bang's energy is beamed to us by the sun.<eos> Two and a half billion years ago, some very special bacteria figure out how to consume the sun's energy to live.<eos> In doing this, they also create the most important waste product in the history of the world,<eos> oxygen.<eos> Soon, oxygen will remake our world, but first, it has another important job to do.
Soon, oxygen will remake our world, but first, it has another important job to do.<eos> Earth's ancient seas are full of iron particles, and everyone knows what happens when oxygen meets iron.<eos> Here I'm a little bacterium.<eos> I've produced this oxygen molecule, and here's a big piece of iron and clump, I rust it.<eos> The rusted iron collects on the sea floor.<eos> Billions of years later, these huge deposits will be raised up to become major sources of the world's iron and steel.<eos> It was these iron deposits that later on drove the industrial Revolution.<eos> In this way, the Brooklyn Bridge and the other early landmarks of the industrial Age are a direct link to some of the first life forms on Earth.<eos> Once there's no more iron left in the sea to rust, these ancient bacteria have a mission to complete.<eos> They create so much oxygen that it fills the oceans and escapes into the atmosphere.
The old Fertile Crescent grains like wheat begin to feed the Americas.<eos> New foods mean more calories, more energy.<eos> Within three centuries of Columbus' voyage, the population of the world will more than double to 900 million.<eos> But the unequal hands dealt to the two hemispheres now play out in a deadly climax.<eos> European conquistadors, inheritors of the agriculture and animals of the Fertile Crescent and the trade spread along the vast networks of the old world, come bearing guns, riding horses, and carrying infectious diseases.<eos> The result, slaughter.<eos> In the years following Columbus' first voyage, 95% of the native population in the Americas will die from European guns and germs.<eos> Once the hemispheres are connected, nothing can ever be the same.<eos> Take the incredible story of sugar.<eos> Chemically, it's the only source of fuel for our brains, a substance we are programmed to crave.
Oh, no, no, you don't have to.<eos> No, I kind of think I have to.<eos> Once, Cam and his friends tried to slingshot a pumpkin across a football field.<eos> Three seconds.<eos> That's all he needs to tell that story.<eos> So the fog was rolling in over the mountains like an ominous blanket as we readied the giant slingshot.<eos> You know, Lorna, the pastor's daughter, she was nervous because like I said, it was after curfew.<eos> She was a goody two-shoe.<eos> Only pastor's daughter I ever met that was.<eos> So we finally launch the pumpkin, and it sails through the air, goalpost to goalpost...
He sure did.<eos> Where did that come from?<eos> Right?<eos> But you're you.<eos> Why aren't we gajillionaires?<eos> Why don't you do what Phil would do?<eos> Phil, why didn't you just put the extra leaves in the table?<eos> Trying to have some fun, be creative.<eos> One long table, honey.<eos> If it was good enough for the last supper, it's good enough for us.
- Aah! My back!<eos> - Dad!<eos> No, Jay, that's not quite it.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I've gotta pick up that truck.<eos> I'd be happy to get the truck.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> It's a pretty big truck.<eos> Oh. Is it--is it bigger than the combine I've been driving since I was 12 years old?
Oh, my God.<eos> Mitchell cozies up to mom, I go running to daddy.<eos> I'm the one who's turning Gloria into mom, which is really disturbing since we're the same age.<eos> You're older.<eos> Oh. Oh, that's where we're gonna chime in?<eos> Will you hurry up?<eos> I'm saving my strength because if we don't find this helicopter, I'm walking to Canada.<eos> Hope you like taxes.<eos> Hey! That's our helicopter!<eos> Is it, now?
You're older.<eos> Oh. Oh, that's where we're gonna chime in?<eos> Will you hurry up?<eos> I'm saving my strength because if we don't find this helicopter, I'm walking to Canada.<eos> Hope you like taxes.<eos> Hey! That's our helicopter!<eos> Is it, now?<eos> I'm sure you have the proper documentation for that.<eos> Just give it back.<eos> It's ours.
Some people have nothing.<eos> And all this it's obscene.<eos> Fine, stand up for the oppressed. But stop this posturing.<eos> Believe me, this world will crumble.<eos> It can't go on like this.<eos> What would you have instead?<eos> You shouldn't laugh. It's no laughing matter.<eos> But there's no need for you to take it all as a tragedy.<eos> This place is unbelievable.<eos> It brings back so many memories.
Dr. Yang.<eos> We just started the bronchoscopy.<eos> Looking forward to seeing your work.<eos> Hopefully I'll learn a thing or two.<eos> It's an honor, sir.<eos> Uh, 35-year-old male, endobronchial carcinoid tumor, presented with active hemoptysis.<eos> He's been given two liters L.R. and a unit of packed cells.<eos> Okay.<eos> So we'll resect with the c-o-2 laser.<eos> Is it ready to go?
- Get out.<eos> - Alex...<eos> Go.<eos> There's no reason for both of us to get killed.<eos> Well, I'm not safer in the middle of the damn road.<eos> I'm telling you to get out of the damn rig.<eos> Alex, if you want to go, you go.<eos> We're not gonna fix your guilt by me letting you die in an ambulance so that I c...<eos> Is it possible the bone was intact when they closed, and then...<eos> And what, it just fell apart in the last couple of days?
What would you do?<eos> All right,the best way into that bunker unnoticed is through an old ventilation shaft.<eos> Cross the dining room to a staircase that's in the rear of the kitchen.<eos> Proceed to your next checkpoint.<eos> You'll find a ventilation shaft in the main boiler room.<eos> Connects up to the hotel's air conditioning system.<eos> Damn it.<eos> It's a long way down,though.<eos> 200 feet underground.<eos> The hotel uses the room as kind of a junk drawer,but it's perfect.
I'm sorry for the trouble.<eos> I can take it from here.<eos> Sorry for the misunderstanding.<eos> What'd you steal?<eos> Spare me the drama, Charlotte.<eos> When I left the other day, I grabbed my purse, forgot my wallet.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Cut the crap and give me your prescription pad.<eos> I know that's what you came here for.<eos> It's mine.
Tell me the reason my father went to jail.<eos> He laundered money for a terrorist group that blew up flight 197.<eos> So... how bad is it, when people find out who you really are?<eos> Uncomfortable if you're lucky.<eos> Some of the nut jobs make a bigger deal out of it than the regular people.<eos> But the worst is when you meet someone who knew someone who died because of what he did.<eos> How is it that you grew up with a dad like that, and never knew who he really was?<eos> You're not having second thoughts, are you?<eos> Only if that check bounces.<eos> It won't.
I don't think Carl's really looking for anything serious right now.<eos> He's still kind of sowing his wild oats.<eos> Well, if he keeps carrying on the way he is,<eos> I'm going to be sewing him into his bedsheets and beating him with a bag of oranges. You know what? I'll keep my eyes open.<eos> All right, if the two of you can wrap up the chitchat, then maybe I won't be late for work.<eos> If I killed him, you'd give me a head start, wouldn't you?<eos> Man, I really appreciate you driving today.<eos> Happy to do it.<eos> Is this the farthest the seat goes back?<eos> The problem ain't how far it goes back; It's how far you go forward.
You can say that again, we're all gonna die.<eos> The universe is being destroyed.<eos> What?<eos> The universe...<eos> It began with a big bang.<eos> That created everything!<eos> But the question is:<eos> Nothingness!<eos> And now the void is dissolving our universe!<eos> Because it doesn't like it anymore... or it saw something ugly out there.
And again, deepest sympathies for your loss, Congressman.<eos> Appreciate it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The police, sir.<eos> Detectives Olson and Fiasco.<eos> Fusco.<eos> Why-- why are you here?<eos> I already talked to one of your people about Jamie's accident.<eos> We have further questions about the accident, sir.<eos> It may relate to another case.
Look. I have a surprise for you.<eos> Samira? Here you are.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Is the stove on? - No.<eos> - Karin? - Help!<eos> Wait here.<eos> Are you Harald Ullven?<eos> He's coming now.<eos> C-38 picked up a man 20 minutes ago.<eos> I need to know where it was going.
- Mm, gosh, I think...<eos> - I'll make a roast, and we can discuss you and Mikey having a church wedding.<eos> We weren't planning on church wedding.<eos> And I wasn't planning on serving goulash while wearing a wire.<eos> But if you want to dance, you got to pay the Fiddler.<eos> I want to dance.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Hey.<eos> I think Jim's back down to his fighting weight.<eos> He just took a dump so big I thought it was another dog.
Bread used to hold the prominent spot on the pyramid.<eos> Now it is classified - as grains.<eos> - So what do we do?<eos> Combine our lobbying interests.<eos> It's not going to help.<eos> It's all about vegetables these days.<eos> What food holds the most sway over Congress?<eos> What food receives $3.5 billion a year in food subsidies?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Corn has always been classified as a vegetable, but it's just as much a grain.
You are her boss.<eos> He is the state's attorney.<eos> Even if it weren't wrong, it's not smart.<eos> Stop sleeping with his wife.<eos> Do you understand me?<eos> You, gentlemen, are a grain, you are not a vegetable.<eos> In fact, other vegetables gain more by being associated with you than you with them.<eos> That is why you were left with MyPlate.<eos> Where is corn?<eos> It is subsumed in "Vegetables."
I can respect that.<eos> I'd like to exchange a tat ring. I've never heard of a tat ring.<eos> Thomas aristotle thomas?<eos> World-famous designer?<eos> Yeah, talk down to me. That'll make the price better.<eos> All right, I'll weight it.<eos> What's that smell? Is someone making soup in the back?<eos> None of your business.<eos> I will give you $275.<eos> It's worth $2,500.
I had no idea those menthol slim 100s were yours.<eos> I just thought so many butts on the ground. Outside the store was gross, so I said something.<eos> Well, that one comment from the great Caroline Channing. About those butts fired my little butt.<eos> You'd be happy to know that I quite smoking. After you got me fired.<eos> Couldn't afford it.<eos> I also couldn't afford my gym membership.<eos> Which is why my fired little butt got massive, Why no one wanted to date me, and why I spent gay pride alone.<eos> Fortunately, I wound up working here.<eos> Yeah, it all worked out. Your butt looks tight.<eos> It's halfway there.
Juan Carlos just locked down our Irish-cartel gun meet.<eos> We got a member inside who may have flipped.<eos> Otto Delaney.<eos> Does Otto know about us?<eos> I'm not sure who he was talking to, but he never sold out your club. You sure?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'll see you at 3:00.<eos> Yeah, we're a go.<eos> In the last 16 months, this case has taken 98,000 man-hours in four different countries.<eos> Recently, it claimed the life of our colleague, FBI Agent Ronald Worski.
This is about business.<eos> Business? What about ethics and integrity?<eos> Well,he promised to resolve the situation with nolan discreetly.<eos> And you believed him?<eos> Daniel?<eos> Charlotte.<eos> Daddy,I can't live with her anymore.<eos> It's okay.<eos> this seat taken?<eos> it's for you.
Listen, you'd better get dressed.<eos> Carl and Christina are gonna be here in a few minutes.<eos> I'm still expecting calls from a couple of bakeries.<eos> I bumped up the cake tasting.<eos> I actually drew up a little chart with elimination brackets like they do with the final four.<eos> Red velvet and mocha chip are the top two seeds.<eos> Hey, remember, don't overthink it.<eos> You'll just make everybody crazy.<eos> - This wine is delicious. - It ought to be.<eos> It cost $35.
Any particular occasion?<eos> Let's just say last Christmas was on the sad side.<eos> This should balance things out.<eos> This is a lot nicer.<eos> That's how things should be.<eos> - That's what it is.<eos> - Yes, but always.<eos> - It could be like this forever.<eos> - You think so?<eos> As long as we take care of this moment, it'll always be there.
Look at me.<eos> I'm flat as a board.<eos> "Flatbread", they used to call me in school.<eos> I was the last to develop.<eos> You don't need large breasts to be pretty.<eos> That's a stupid ideal.<eos> You're really pretty as you are.<eos> My last boyfriend did the pencil test on me.<eos> You know when you try to make a pencil stick under the breast?<eos> It rolled right off, as if it was a desk.
I'll beckon my friend... so bad and big.<eos> The Gruffalo's child unclenched her fist.<eos> The Big Bad Mouse?<eos> So he does exist?<eos> Mmm.<eos> The Mouse hopped into the hazel tree.<eos> He beckoned, then said...<eos> Just wait and see.<eos> Out came the moon.<eos> It was bright and round.
No!<eos> What an idiot!<eos> He's a wonderful idiot.<eos> At Chasseloup-Laubat College yesterday, Gen. de Lattre,<eos> France's High Commissioner to Indochina, spoke confidently to Vietnamese students.<eos> Be a man!<eos> If you're a communist, join the Viet Minh.<eos> There are men there who fight hard for a bad cause.<eos> But if you're a patriot, fight for your country. This war is your war.<eos> It no longer involves France, except within the boundaries of its commitments to Vietnam and the part it should take in defending the free world.
Leave me a message, and I'll call you back...<eos> If you're very, very good.<eos> Jo!<eos> "Driving home...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Shut off the phone. So...<eos> "Driving home, I thought of an old saying about...<eos> "How one person can never really truly know another.<eos> "It's easy to give that idea lip service,<eos> "but it's a jolt as horrible and unexpected

So...<eos> "Driving home, I thought of an old saying about...<eos> "How one person can never really truly know another.<eos> "It's easy to give that idea lip service,<eos> "but it's a jolt as horrible and unexpected<eos> "as severe air turbulence...<eos> "On a previously calm airline flight to discover it's a literal fact in one's own life."
This movie has been made to celebrate the virtue of Lord Buddha's teachings.<eos> It is also dedicated to M.R. Kukrit Pramoj, Akira Kurosawa, and Rynosuke Akutagawa.
Partyhat?<eos> Want a partyhat?<eos> Got a cigarette? Got a cigarette?<eos> Alright, line up everyone!<eos> Stop that!<eos> It's here, four fourths.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I've told you before not to start until the hand drops!<eos> It drops, you start!
Thanks very much.<eos> You're my best friend.<eos> You're my only friend, Margeir.<eos> Won't you put a candle on it?<eos> Of course.<eos> Blow it out!<eos> Make a wish!<eos> What should I wish for?<eos> Whatever you want!<eos> If your wish comes from the heart, it'll come true!
I don't know about this.<eos> Come on, hurry up.<eos> Valide Sultan is hosting a feast tonight.<eos> She expects you to be there.<eos> Who is this feast for?<eos> Gülşah, bring my best kaftans.<eos> I have to be beautiful for tonight.<eos> Please, read the letter again.<eos> Enough.<eos> It came out beautifully, okay?
She told me she is pregnant.<eos> It's a lie.<eos> She is lying.<eos> She can't be.<eos> My padishah our treasure has arrived.<eos> It's going to be a loud night.<eos> Look how joyful he is.<eos> As if we are going to play matrak .<eos> War is a game too, Pargalı.<eos> Like any game, it has its own rules.
You are the one who should pull himself together.<eos> It's Sultan Süleyman's son who wants to eat quail.<eos> Hurry up, the Valide Sultan wants to see you.<eos> Move.<eos> Sümbül Agha, don't forget about the quails.<eos> We are hungry.<eos> Allah give me patience.<eos> My sultan, the messenger is waiting for the letter.<eos> I should take it to him.<eos> It will reach İbrahim for sure, right, Gülfem?
-I changed my mind. Find someone else. -I have too.<eos> I'm not playing.<eos> Find someone else, Matrakçı.<eos> Come on. Is there no one who will play matrak with me?<eos> I won't take too much of your money.<eos> Neither the light of the sun nor the shining night stars ease my bleeding heart.<eos> How many times has the crescent moon become the full moon. But you are still not here.<eos> The marble balcony is cold.<eos> It is dark.<eos> It waits for its master, alone.
Bring me the head of the man who did this!<eos> Pargalı.<eos> Pargalı, stay with me.<eos> Pargalı, stay with me.<eos> Stay with me, Pargalı.<eos> Find a physician!<eos> Pargalı, stay with me.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Your Majesty, the dagger needs to be removed.<eos> What if it is poisoned?
You can tell me if something happens.<eos> Stand tall.<eos> Don't show your fear.<eos> Or they will come down on you.<eos> You can't show weakness in this palace.<eos> The weak lose.<eos> Nigar Kalfa.<eos> Bring my new caftan from the tailor.<eos> His Majesty is coming tonight.<eos> Make sure it is ready.
Dream of our happy family.<eos> The concierge gathered everyone and asked how it was done.<eos> How could Hasibe have committed such treachery?<eos> I cannot understand, my Sultan.<eos> He questioned Gülşah too.<eos> What would Gülşah know of it?<eos> Whatever, Daye.<eos> Do whatever İbrahim says.<eos> Assist him.<eos> This disaster must be resolved before people hear of it.
Your soul is still a child.<eos> Me or work?<eos> Now it is time to work.<eos> The evening is time for you.<eos> The ambassadors have arrived and are waiting.<eos> I am ready, Pargalı.<eos> Get well soon.<eos> Do you know who poisoned me?<eos> That matter is closed.<eos> It's closed, is it?
If anything happens to you...<eos> Allah forbid.<eos> How is the baby?<eos> He is well.<eos> He is kicking me like he's beating a drum.<eos> That's good.<eos> Look.<eos> I brought a lucky charm for you.<eos> Carry this inside your dress.<eos> It will protect you from the evil eye.
He is well.<eos> He is kicking me like he's beating a drum.<eos> That's good.<eos> Look.<eos> I brought a lucky charm for you.<eos> Carry this inside your dress.<eos> It will protect you from the evil eye.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will carry this all the time.<eos> So it will protect my son.
I am here to discuss a joyous event, my lion.<eos> Do you have time?<eos> Make way!<eos> Master Arem Sultan Hatice wants to see your handiwork.<eos> My sultan.<eos> Please come in.<eos> Master Arem is the most talented master jeweller and mirror maker in the palace.<eos> I want this mirror.<eos> What do you think, Sultan Hatice?<eos> It is beautiful.

Do you know what happened?<eos> It was bad.<eos> Her face was horrific.<eos> Tell me everything you know, right now!<eos> She received a fur.<eos> She was so happy.<eos> She wrapped herself in it and slept.<eos> What fur?<eos> Where did it come from?<eos> Here it is.
What is returning?<eos> Where does one return to?<eos> What is the place that one returns to?<eos> Is there any return?<eos> Is it possible?<eos> Returning is not a skill it is a necessity, İbrahim.<eos> You are beautiful, my Sultan.<eos> You dazzle my eyes.<eos> Is the table ready?<eos> It is ready.
Yes.<eos> Love this car.<eos> Did he give it to you?<eos> I Wish.<eos> Fast.<eos> You want a little bet?<eos> A bet about what?<eos> That you scream before I do.<eos> That I scream before you do, in relation to what?<eos> Well, how fast does it go?
What do you want for it?<eos> I'll throw it in with the bike if you do me a favor.<eos> What's the favor?<eos> I want you to come to the bathroom with me.<eos> He's your man.<eos> -$50, right? - Yeah.<eos> He wants me to look at his dick.<eos> I flatly refused.<eos> What does he want you to look at it for?<eos> Says there's something wrong with it.
No.<eos> Well, maybe, sort of. Um...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I need details!<eos> And go slowly!<eos> - Is he totally gorgeous?<eos> - Totally.<eos> Does he have a nice rotund belly?<eos> Well, let's call it sturdy.
Because I'm the one who killed her!<eos> I'm the one who killed her, but at least I know I did it.<eos> And that guy has no idea!<eos> He is wandering around blaming everybody else.<eos> All I want is for somebody to let him know that what he did was wrong.<eos> And if they don't fire him, and all you want is the money, and the police won't do anything, then how is he gonna know he's wrong?<eos> You can't take the deal, Abigail!<eos> It wasn't to get you any money, it was because we wanted to get him fired!<eos> Well, it may not matter to you, but where I come from, $350,000 is an awful lot of money and to my mind is a positive result of all this tragedy and not just negative.<eos> Not just getting someone fired for one mistake, no matter how bad it was.
Because, it's like you go down one.<eos> Hey, Mr. Kovaks.<eos> Mr. Shaw, I see you met Mr. Dev'Reaux.<eos> This guy owns his own island with jet skis.<eos> How cool is that?<eos> He's our probationary elevator operator.<eos> He's still very early in the interview process.<eos> Why don't we finish the job interview right now, Josh?<eos> Suppose I ask you to pick me up a cheeseburger, Enrique, what would you say?<eos> How do you like it cooked?
- Of course it is.<eos> That was great.<eos> I hope we find this place soon.<eos> I can't see out of this...<eos> For smurf's sake.<eos> I thought that's why we left Clumsy behind.<eos> Oh, it smells like butter in here.<eos> Where do you suppose this magic bookstore could be?<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - There it is.
- Figures.<eos> We have to find a way in. Come on.<eos> I'm gettin' too old for this.<eos> - Brainy.<eos> - Gutsy.<eos> All right, everybody.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Wow.<eos> This place looks creepy to me.<eos> It's not creepy, it's different.
Please.<eos> I know place where you can make radio call. Please.<eos> Radio?<eos> Yes.<eos> I lived near here before war.<eos> Tell me something, Kolya, how come she's your ex?<eos> What kind of a question is that?<eos> Because now she live on wrong side of border.<eos> Where's this place, kid?<eos> It is very near.
I will arrange everything.<eos> I will deliver the message.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Remo returns.<eos> What does it say?<eos> "The Shaipur Outpost at midday."<eos> "Come alone."<eos> It's hers.<eos> You're bold, Northerner.<eos> I admire courage, even when it's foolish.
Your death shall herald a new age of Acheron.<eos> The spirits I raise will melt flesh from the bones of kings.<eos> And my wife will make me a god, and we will cast all rivals into oceans of blood.<eos> Please.<eos> I beg you one last time.<eos> Do not do this. Let us turn back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Did you know I met your Barbarian when he was a boy?<eos> That I took this sword from him?<eos> I'm told Cimmerian steel is sharper and harder than any other, that when it cuts, the pain is close to pleasure.
And I have given it to you upon the altar... to make atonement for your souls.<eos> How dare you come back to this holy place?<eos> A man who would defy the Church, for his own selfish crusade!<eos> Look inside the burning train just behind these cities walls... you'll find hundreds more like it. - And their queen was not among them.<eos> - Lies!<eos> This man is a charlatan.<eos> A risk to the security of the cities.<eos> There is no vampire menace!<eos> - The war is over, Priest! - No.<eos> It's just beginning.
Khaleesi!<eos> Stannis Baratheon is coming for us.<eos> Sooner rather than later.<eos> Tyrion and Cersei have a lot in common.<eos> And I think that's why they're at such odds with each other.<eos> They are going to attack us.<eos> We need to be ready.<eos> The king is taking personal charge of siege preparations.<eos> If the wind holds, we'll reach King's Landing in a day.<eos> Will it hold?
I need to know, where I am, what is the location and condition of my crew.<eos> Does anybody know, that I am stateside?<eos> You're obligated to give me... - this information!<eos> - Start with the bomb!<eos> Where is it, what does it look like. - What kind of explosive,<eos> - Right... - how is it detonated.<eos> Right.<eos> Find the bomb and you'll find the bomber.<eos> Find the bomb... Wait no, how...!<eos> I took your advice. It was good advice. Thank you.
Get to know them, narrow the suspect pool.<eos> Look for ones who seem... quiet or withdrawn, who seem nervous.<eos> As always, you'll have 8 minutes.<eos> 8 minutes, and I blow up again?<eos> Yes.<eos> I need you to discipline yourself on this next pass.<eos> Perform only the task that we assign you.<eos> Everything else is irrelevant.<eos> Charge the drivers.<eos> I took your advice... It was very good advice.
Captain, I can not imagine what you must be feeling right now, but if are to prevent a second attack, we need to send you back immediately.<eos> And Captain, you cannot deviate from the mission... while inside the Source Code.<eos> Even to investigate your... hmm...<eos> Even to investigate what happened to you.<eos> There's only one continuum on this end and it can not be unsettled.<eos> Well, you know, I did unsettle it.<eos> I called you from the train.<eos> Just before the explosion, at 7:46 this morning they paged you with a call...<eos> You may have made that call from the train, but I would never receive it here.<eos> It's a different reality, Captain. If the call even went through it would be received by a different me entirely.
So, what you wanna do today?<eos> I think we should stay here for a while.<eos> This feels like exactly where we're supposed to be, doesn't it?<eos> - Good Morning, Jeff.<eos> - Good Morning, Captain<eos> "Lilly awoke in an evening dress and an opera cloak".<eos> "In her hand were 5 playing cards".<eos> "At some point today, you re gonna hear about a failed terrorist attack... on a commuter train near Chicago".<eos> You and I kept that bomb from going off.<eos> An attempted bombing on a CCR train outside Chicago... but it was foiled, and the suspect was found on board... and he's named Derek Frost.
And Heathcliff, too.<eos> - In books, they're crying all the time.<eos> - I can do it.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> It's terribly important, but...<eos> We're too exposed.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Where are we going?<eos> Only to the most wonderful place on earth.<eos> It's Neverland and Oz and... Treasure Island all wrapped into one.
You've got a little friend.<eos> Look!<eos> - Oh, hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> Monsieur Claude is dead.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> What happened to him?<eos> They found his corpse in the Seine.<eos> It's been down there for many months, it seems.
I'm, like, shaking.<eos> I've never seen Madame Gorski clap like that before.<eos> Well, get over it.<eos> It's nearly lights out.<eos> She's not easily impressed.<eos> She wasn't impressed.<eos> All that gyrating and moaning.<eos> The dance should be more than just titillation.<eos> Mine's personal.<eos> It says who I am.
Wonderful!<eos> But you think we might find another way to North Africa that doesn't take us through that Wall of Death?<eos> We can't turn back.<eos> Not now.<eos> No, Captain!<eos> Those are surgical spirits for medicinal purposes only.<eos> Quite right, laddie, quite right.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> The fuel tank!<eos> It's almost empty!
Don't speak to me like that.<eos> I will speak to you any way I please, Tony.<eos> We both know you're lucky I'm here.<eos> I have the battery.<eos> I'm on a schedule.<eos> The world is full of bad guys and people are calling.<eos> I understand.<eos> What's your price?<eos> I have a figure in mind.<eos> What's it worth to you?
Because it's getting crazy. It's out of control now.<eos> I'm hearing it from all ends.<eos> Our world is all bullshit.<eos> Some TV bubblehead, he gets up there like he knows something.<eos> He sells fear, panic.<eos> And morons, they love it.<eos> They want it to end because it sells.<eos> There's no limits anymore.<eos> Muriel knows how to walk this thing.<eos> It's her damn dog.
I know who you are.<eos> Murderer of innocent travelers on the road.<eos> You are gonna be held to account for the things you've done, do you know that?<eos> Do you?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm gonna grab my things and I'm gonna walk out of here.<eos> -All right.<eos> -All right, brother?<eos> "Cursed be the ground for our sake.<eos> "Both thorns and thistles it shall bring forth for us.
They saw it all!<eos> The wild eyes!<eos> The holy yells!<eos> They bade farewell!<eos> They jumped off the roof!<eos> Waving!<eos> Carrying flowers!<eos> Down to the river!<eos> Into the street!<eos> It is my opinion that if it has any literary value, it's negligible.
Don't forget I heard you in action with Miss Mueller.<eos> Mrs. Mueller.<eos> Listen, if I say something that offends you, please just smile and walk away...<eos> ... becauseI wouldhatetogetslapped in front of all your guests.<eos> Maybe you shouldn't say it.<eos> I wanna see you again.<eos> Are you flirting with my wife now?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> How's your arm?<eos> It's already healed.
So we go now. Go home.<eos> We make a run for it.<eos> - We get you out of here. - Don't rush.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The portal's gonna close.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> The moment Flynn is on the Grid, Clu will stop at nothing to obtain his disk.<eos> My disk is everything, Sam.<eos> It's the master key.
The game has changed, son of Flynn!<eos> I met your friend.<eos> He's fantastic!<eos> Behold!<eos> The son of our maker!<eos> Let's split, man.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!<eos> A little help here maybe?<eos> Your disk.<eos> Dad, it's gone.
- What's she doing?<eos> - Removing herself from the equation.<eos> Tron.<eos> He's alive.<eos> - We can't just let her go.<eos> - No, Sam, there's another way.<eos> Well done, sir.<eos> I've never seen anything like it.<eos> Humbly, sir, I know you have greater designs than any of us understand.<eos> What does it do?
More!<eos> Fool!<eos> He's got me!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Goddamn it, get me out of here!<eos> Fuck!<eos> Dude, fuck this shit.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I'm fucking over it.<eos> - It got you good right here.
He's got one thumb.<eos> How's he gonna hit the trigger?<eos> He's gonna have no thumbs after this.<eos> You ever get scared in these moments?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Push it!<eos> Push it the other way!<eos> Jarppi, cut out!<eos> Yeah, but you got to push!<eos> There it goes, there it goes!
I saw it.<eos> - That's fucking gross.<eos> - Dude, that was fucking mingin'.<eos> Let's get out the dart gun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Luckily, we had it handy.<eos> - Do you want to practice?<eos> - Let's get a balloon.<eos> - Does it need to go down lower?
That was so amazing!<eos> I think it's time for a Wee Man's Chronic Taco replay.<eos> Redemption is made!<eos> I'm Preston Lacy, and this is the Apple of My Ass.<eos> - Want me to put it in, P?<eos> - Put her in.<eos> Help me out, O.<eos> - What about the apple?<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Is it in there pretty good?
It's still in there!<eos> Get back down there!<eos> Get back down.<eos> It's still in.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> Oh, no!<eos> - Can I move this?<eos> - Still have an apple in your ass?<eos> Got it out.
Your Majesty, dinner is safe to eat.<eos> Everything is transient follow Heaven's Mandate.<eos> Welcome, Chaplain.<eos> Everyone, on your knees!<eos> Yes, Your Majesty.<eos> The astronomical phenomena have been chaotic.<eos> An evil availed of my spiritual sabbatical to disturb the royal soil against nature.<eos> Would the Chaplain please enlighten me?<eos> The evil has been committing crimes as Venus has left the Palace for 8 years.<eos> It's being locked up and has not returned.
Kids' room.<eos> If you like you can be in here.<eos> The rent is paid for the next few months.<eos> Fuck...<eos> Are you...<eos> Are you OK?<eos> I didn't know you did massage customers in the middle of the night.<eos> You scared me.<eos> You should see the sky.<eos> It's full of stars.
- Hey, Daddy.<eos> - Hey, beautiful.<eos> - What are you smiling at?<eos> - A man called today from Chicago. Fred Munder?<eos> He said he was impressed with your resume, wanted you to give him a call.<eos> His phone number's over there.<eos> That's where he's based.<eos> The guy's a headhunter.<eos> I just thought the job was in Boston.<eos> It is in Boston.
He was just a baby.<eos> My baby.<eos> When you do that come back.<eos> Come back then!<eos> Mr. President, my name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist.<eos> My name is Khan and I'm not a terrorist.<eos> Mandira, I felt a stab of pain in my chest when I left you.<eos> I thought it was chest congestion.<eos> But no amount of ginger juice could make the pain go away.<eos> It's still there.
Whoa.<eos> Check that out.<eos> Isthatcheese?<eos> Stop!<eos> Good God, man!<eos> You almost got the Cheese Touch.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The Cheese Touch.<eos> Nobody knows when or how, but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.<eos> Nobody knew who it belonged to.
Stop!<eos> Good God, man!<eos> You almost got the Cheese Touch.<eos> - The what?<eos> - The Cheese Touch.<eos> Nobody knows when or how, but one day that cheese mysteriously appeared on the blacktop.<eos> Nobody knew who it belonged to.<eos> Nobody touched it.<eos> Nobody threw it away.<eos> And so there it sat, growing more foul and powerful by the day.
And so the cheese sits, patiently waiting for its next victim.<eos> This is a terrible place.<eos> - No doors?<eos> - None.<eos> I'm not pooping until I'm in high school.<eos> The cafeteria, possibly the cruelest place on Earth.<eos> But I was about to make some kid's day by sitting next to him.<eos> That seat's saved.<eos> For who?<eos> It's saved.
I should be at the top of the food chain by now.<eos> Something's got to change, fast.<eos> My mom told me to just be myself and people would like me.<eos> That would be good advice if you were somebody else.<eos> Hey, little brother.<eos> Was your first day as crappy as I said it would be?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> - It was actually better than I...
When it happens, you don't think. It's afterwards, when you have time.<eos> I don't feel happy about avoiding death.<eos> I do.<eos> You're here with us and have so much still to do.<eos> Yeah? Like what?<eos> A new shop in Tokyo, a new house...<eos> No one cares. Especially not me.<eos> You nearly died. Asking questions is normal.<eos> Why the accident?<eos> What does it mean?
Marcus.<eos> Come on.<eos> Come up here where I can see you.<eos> Good boy.<eos> There's a good boy, Marcus.<eos> That's right. I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> That's lovely.<eos> Now, Marcus, you've lost someone recently. Was it someone very close to you?<eos> He's telling me his name.<eos> It's Joe, or Jack.
Ok, what is it?<eos> Why are you crying?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I'm pretty sure it doesn't happen that fast.<eos> I know it... it's hard to explain.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> Who's the father?<eos> I don't know I mean, I know who it is, I just don't know his name exactly.<eos> It's a donor of a sperm bank.
- He's not one of them?<eos> - He's not one of them.<eos> - He's not one of them, Billy.<eos> - He's got a fucking foreskin, mate!<eos> I got done by the Nation of Islam!<eos> - And even if he was one of them...<eos> - And even if he was, what?<eos> What, you go down there, Bill, and pick up the first black boy you saw?<eos> Example, you said. Even if it wasn't him, which it is him.<eos> Well, it fucking is now.
Have you had a lot of problems with swelling?<eos> Oh yeah. It's mostly worse on the left foot.<eos> OK.<eos> You're at more risk of getting skin breakdown where you'll get ulcers and stuff that can get infected just like diabetes so...<eos> You are 429 pounds, which gives you a body mass index, and that's your weight versus your height, and ideally we like that less than 25.<eos> You're at 58, which is in the extreme obesity, or morbid obesity.<eos> You know, you're almost off the scales for, a few more pounds and I wouldn't have been able to measure you on this type of scale.<eos> And what's the prognosis if Phil does nothing about anything and just keeps going the way he's going?<eos> What do you think he has the unpleasant things to look forward to?<eos> If he doesn't lose weight and keeps going, he'll get diabetes, your blood pressure will continue to rise, which will require numerous medications to keep it under control.
- Can I have your attention?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Do you or do you not possess a specialised weapon?<eos> - I do not.<eos> I do not. - You do not?<eos> Well, it depends on how you define the word "weapon."<eos> - The Iron Man weapon.<eos> - My device does not fit that description. Well...<eos> How would you describe it?<eos> I would describe it by defining it as what it is, Senator.

- I'm all right.<eos> - Looking gorgeous.<eos> - Please, this is tough.<eos> - Can I ask you... Is this the first time...<eos> - Fromage.<eos> - Say, "Brie." ...that you guys have seen each other?<eos> God, that's so awful.<eos> Listen, is it the first time you've seen each other since the Senate?<eos> Since he got his contract revoked...<eos> - Actually, it's on hold. ...when you were attempting to...
GU-NAM: When I was 11, rabies went around.<eos> A fertile dog brings in the real dough.<eos> GU-NAM: My dog caught rabies and it bit its mom to death then killed anything it could bite.

We need that to get back in time?<eos> Well, you're back here.<eos> I mean, I can tell you've all been to Kodiak Valley before.<eos> - I haven't. - Maybe not her, but I know that you were here.<eos> You know what's going on here, don't you, old man?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Your tub is on the fritz.<eos> It'd behoove you to fix it.<eos> What?<eos> It's working.

You are beautiful, little page!<eos> Beautiful!<eos> Let's have some Champagne.<eos> I wanted to dance the slow ones.<eos> What are you called?<eos> Gigola.<eos> Interesting!<eos> My name's Odette.<eos> - Do you like my name?<eos> - I don't have to like it.
Hello?<eos> What?<eos> Joe.<eos> Frank Moses is not a retired analyst who's never worked in the field.<eos> This guy has a history.<eos> That's a file number.<eos> You need to visit the back room.<eos> You're going to meet the Records Keeper.<eos> I didn't even know this place existed.<eos> It doesn't.
Hey!<eos> You're really a firecracker!<eos> What?<eos> Why's that?<eos> You are the cracker.<eos> (Quietly:) How's your tooth doing?<eos> It's just pissed that I took such bad care of it for all these years.<eos> Hm!<eos> ...<eos> And it wasn't too happy about the Asprin?

- All right.<eos> What?<eos> Shit.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Remember you mentioned that there are other superheroes?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, do you think they can help us?<eos> Hot chocolate, extra marshmallows.<eos> Man, that looks even cooler than it did in the picture.<eos> Child, you know, that's because in the picture, it didn't have Gatling guns.
I'm on the one-a-day Fruity Pebbles plan.<eos> Women our age shouldn't joke about vitamins.<eos> Women who are not our age shouldn't say "women our age."<eos> -Yeah.<eos> -Well, one day very soon you will thank me.<eos> I am leading the way through the menopause maze.<eos> With my vitamins, my melatonin sleep patches, my bioidentical estrogen cream progesterone cream, a touch of testosterone--<eos> -She's the hormone whisperer.<eos> -I am.<eos> I've tricked my body into thinking it's younger.
- I've gotta run to the gift shop.<eos> - Get them at the airport.<eos> How tacky.<eos> No, we have time.<eos> The plane doesn't leave till 6.<eos> Not chancing it.<eos> It's a miracle I got these seats rebooked.<eos> If anything goes wrong, we're flying back 13 and a half hours in coach.<eos> Buy them some crap at the airport.<eos> It's not here.
Hey, tell me, what are you doing here in Rome?<eos> Auditioning.<eos> I'm an actress.<eos> A Russian film actress.<eos> Are you a good one, a very famous one, or just married to a mafioso?<eos> - I'm single.<eos> - So, you must be a very good one.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Show me your Arabian palace.<eos> It's not mine.
They was laughing.<eos> Cut off another finger.<eos> blood dripped off the table through the cracks onto me.<eos> And I hollered out, "We're down here."<eos> When they looked down, Matthew grabbed the hatchet, swung it at that Yankee, and damn near chopped his head clean off.<eos> The other one run for the door.<eos> Matthew buried it in his back.<eos> I won't rest until I see her dead.<eos> You will witness her death.<eos> But it will be by my hand.
-I lost my ship and my crew.<eos> I would like to know why.<eos> -You're a soldier. We both are.<eos> We follow orders.<eos> Without questions.<eos> Tell me what you know otherwise, I go alone.<eos> Disobeying orders is treason, soldier.<eos> Punishable by death.<eos> All right. This thing is the last of it's kind.<eos> We destroyed it's home world, and somehow it's figured a way to return the favour.
Look likes it's just you and me again.<eos> I'm sorry about Commander Karza but if I must say I'm pleased that it was you who survived.<eos> Well, that makes two of us.<eos> Keep a trace on the prisoner.<eos> 200 micro-clicks on your current location.<eos> Continuing in south- eastern direction.<eos> On the move again.<eos> I hope you rot in the bellies of twelve gods, sir.<eos> Prisoner has stopped moving.<eos> It's been moving at a steady pace for hours.
Shyann was sick, some sort of stomach cancer eating her up slowly and gradually taking its time.<eos> Now the way I always heard it<eos> Shyann had a nurse named Lena a beautiful Cajun woman who would come by to tend to her.<eos> And over the long months of Shyann's passing,<eos> Thomas and Lena got closer.<eos> Too close.<eos> Call Thomas Crowley a cheat, call him an infidel, but given the circumstances, the entire situation was nothing but sad and tragic.<eos> With his wife as good as dead for so many years, it was only a matter of time until the pain and suffering of his own emotions needed to be addressed.<eos> It took almost a year of Thomas and Lena carrying on in secret before the day came when Shyann finally found peace from her suffering.<eos> But the moment was not so much a release as it was a nightmare.
Right, kinda like how you let me win at air hockey and at pool?<eos> I was sick.<eos> You're adorable.<eos> Fucking mosquitoes!<eos> Hey, man. I got some spray if you want.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sweet. Thanks. Do you believe the whole ghost story about this place?<eos> I believe there was a story, but I believe there's a ghost that can actually hurt somebody.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, I've been thinking if a ghost takes on physical presence and manifests itself, then what's to stop it from going after somebody?
It was my dear brandy who suffered.<eos> Another innocent victim of unprovoked aggression.<eos> I can not do this.<eos> Here are old, please.<eos> I thought the military did not take things.<eos> We take things for old fools like you.<eos> The want or not.<eos> If you put it, it would be rude not to accept.<eos> Well, go to the bathroom.<eos> Remember old fool if it loses again I will not look, okay?
All right!<eos> All right!<eos> All right!<eos> I've got it!<eos> I've got it!<eos> I've got it!<eos> - He's gonna kill us both! What?<eos> - I've got the flash drive.<eos> - Thought so.<eos> - Where is it?

- He's gonna kill us both! What?<eos> - I've got the flash drive.<eos> - Thought so.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> It's in the park.<eos> - The park?<eos> - Could you be more specific?<eos> The Central Park.<eos> Okay, this is what's gonna happen.<eos> We're all gonna take a little field trip to the Central Park, and you're gonna show us exactly where it is.
- Good, good, good.<eos> Why?<eos> - It's for your penis.<eos> It's intravenous penis medicine, and you're very shy, so we have to get<eos> - to the nearest hospital.<eos> - What's wrong with my penis?<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Move it, man. Okay.<eos> Where is it?
- Claire...<eos> - ...that needs to be done by a nurse...<eos> Just... It's not...<eos> - ...a registered nurse,<eos> - because there's a two-step process...<eos> - My penis is fine.<eos> - My penis is fine!<eos> - ...with a numbing cream.<eos> - And there can be a lot of blood.<eos> - Show him where it is!
What's your problem?<eos> You wanna know what my problem is?<eos> No.<eos> That was a rhetorical question.<eos> I don't wanna know anything from you.<eos> We are not friends anymore.<eos> We are officially over.<eos> Oh, rats.<eos> I want my Juicy sweatshirt back.<eos> It was too loose around your chest anyway.
Go, Woodchucks!<eos> And here you all are waiting outside the bedroom door for me to kiss Todd listening to me pretend to have sex with Brandon paying me to lie for you and calling me every name in the book.<eos> You know, it was just like Hester in The Scarlet Letter.<eos> Except that's the one thing the movies don't tell you:<eos> How shitty it feels to be an outcast.<eos> Warranted or not.<eos> How did you know I love this song?<eos> I guessed.<eos> I see you've been watching my live webcast.<eos> It's still going on, you know.
-Don't worry.<eos> It's just for her sake.<eos> I'm just gonna take care of this then I'm off to Belgrade.<eos> We'll taste this booze and I'll tell you.<eos> Once I had a friend.<eos> A great friend.<eos> We were ten years old.<eos> And he...we were waiting for the elevator.<eos> And I...<eos> We went in to the elevator and it got stuck.

I am Captain McLintoch, and this is the Edinburgh Militia.<eos> Your reputation precedes you, Captain McLintoch.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Your preposterous war on grave robbery was a model of incompetence.<eos> It has come to my attention, sir, that earlier on today, you publicly dissected a corpse.<eos> Well, if this is him then your information is correct.<eos> Pull yourself together, Private.<eos> How did you obtain this body?<eos> Patterson?<eos> I believe it was dumped in the alley behind this building.
Princess, you mustn't.<eos> Father!<eos> He's burning!<eos> You have served me with great honor.<eos> We need access to a great deal of water.<eos> Do something!<eos> ♪ Oh, Lilliput, great kingdom...<eos> I do not wanna do this.<eos> You have a plan?<eos> I have a plan, but you're not gonna like it.
I'm talking Pulitzer.<eos> "Slide to unlock."<eos> What are you guys doing?<eos> Is that my phone?<eos> Man, it takes a lickin'.<eos> No signal, but I got 12 messages.<eos> Mr. Popularity.<eos> Hey, Gulliver.<eos> It's me. It's Darcy.<eos> You know, I just realized why I felt like your writing came straight... out of Frommer's. Because it does!
- No... you prepare for war!<eos> I got to do one more thing, real quick.<eos> Kings, kings, come on!<eos> Guys, what is it with you... and the executions... and the gallows and the stocks and the war?<eos> Seriously, war?<eos> Why do war?<eos> What is it good for?<eos> ♪ Absolutely naught!<eos> ♪ War!<eos> ♪ Yeah...

Water.<eos> Let it be so.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're not divine, old man.<eos> In one thing you are correct... my reach on the book exceeds its grasp.<eos> We made it.<eos> The water rushes.<eos> This way.<eos> Lysanor: Why is this river not on any map?<eos> Enchanted it is, hidden from the paths of man.

Your confidence belies the truth of the situation.<eos> Excalibur, your challenges.<eos> Sir Galahad raised you to be queen.<eos> Thanks for the news, messenger.<eos> Here's mine to you... you shall be dead by the end of this day, knight.<eos> The truth?<eos> The truth is I have the book, the princess, the sword and you under the spell of Ambrosius.<eos> You're entirely powerless against me.<eos> That's true... the Circle of Ambrosius is a mighty powerful spell.<eos> It nullifies the magic of the first one who crosses it.
-How's my little Cynthia?<eos> -Oh, Duncan.<eos> Oh, look at you.<eos> I'm just trying to hold it all together.<eos> He was a good husband and a great father to two healthy, strong boys.<eos> Why they have decided not to have children of their own<eos> -is beyond me.<eos> -Cynthia.<eos> Can I get you some coffee?<eos> Coffee may do many things, Michelle, but it does not bring back the dead.
And sometimes I'd say, "Dad, you wanna go out?" And he'd go...<eos> He's alive.<eos> There's something alive in there.<eos> -No, there's not...<eos> -You have to tell, someone's moving...<eos> The coffin's moving. I'm sorry.<eos> -There's somebody in there.<eos> -No, Oscar, sit.<eos> Please.<eos> It's moving. I just saw it move.
- Wanna tighten up.<eos> - I get you, I get you.<eos> If you're so worried about your appearance, are you gonna do something about your veiny, white skin?<eos> Mm.<eos> Right now you look like an actor in a kabuki troupe.<eos> - You're really want to talk about appearances.<eos> No offense, but with the moustache...<eos> - What?<eos> You don't like it?<eos> - It's disgusting.
He was a douchebag.<eos> I never let him forget it.<eos> Dan didn't die up here just for you... and I to give up and die too.<eos> Help me up.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh God!<eos> Oh shit.<eos> - Shit, just hold on.<eos> - Oh my God. - The chair is gonna fall.<eos> - No it's not. No it's not.
What's with him?<eos> He's in shock.<eos> - Is everything fine?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I want to discuss the plan.<eos> - I'm coming!<eos> Hassan, summarize the situation for me.<eos> Besides the loss of our brother, who was killed by infidels... the operation is a success.<eos> The key is in their hands.<eos> It will soon open the doors of...
Miss Lucy.<eos> I think it must be.<eos> We haven't had a new guardian for ages.<eos> Arthur!<eos> Arthur!<eos> Catch it, Tommy.<eos> Why didn't Tommy get the ball?<eos> Excuse me, Miss Lucy?<eos> Why didn't Tommy get the ball?<eos> When it bounced over the fence, it couldn't have been far from him.
- Yeah?<eos> Did you blow up any kuffars?<eos> What?<eos> At the wedding?<eos> Do you want to hear what happened to Simba or not?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Right, so...<eos> Simba and Pumbaa were out on their own, when all of a sudden they saw this this big evil bird, this big bird, that Scar had sent out to look for them.<eos> This big, evil vulture, coming right at them.<eos> "There it is," said Simba.

Well, it looks like Zoe's telling you some tall tales, then, I guess.<eos> He is funny.<eos> You were right.<eos> Hey, you Mick, you've got a lot of fucking nerve showing up here. Oh, come on.<eos> Thanks for inviting me.<eos> I will take out your fucking front two teeth if you keep this up.<eos> - Isn't he something? - What's with the little mustache?<eos> What?<eos> I forgot I even had it, actually.<eos> Do you like it?
With what?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have to try something.<eos> Ivy, we need to rest for a second.<eos> There's gonna be plenty of time to sit around and feel sorry for ourselves later.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Allison, I think.<eos> She hasn't said a word since we found her.<eos> How do you know her name if she hasn't--<eos> It's on a pendant around her neck.
Wake up.<eos> You were having a nightmare.<eos> You know, it's quite common to have strange dreams during times of- -pregnancy?<eos> I mmense stress?<eos> I've had the standard diagnosis before.<eos> It's bullshit.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> What if I told you I'd seen this place in a dream?<eos> Yeah, well, like I said-- No.<eos> Before I got here, before I knew it existed.
But wherever we go, that whatever we do,<eos> we are responsible.<eos> Responsibility for themselves and for others.<eos> But the one who takes responsibility, assumes all the burdens<eos> and guilt.<eos> And with fear comes guilt.<eos> If the fear becomes a powerful, comes to salvation.<eos> Neither Charles nor Felix at the wake have not appeared.<eos> For Charles Nanga Parbat will remain the top, predetermined his whole life.<eos> But it is superfluous mountain.
No.<eos> They're trying to discredit me because I changed my position about the negotiations.<eos> It is not only me. Many have changed. And there is a real fracture inside the PLO because of it.<eos> I didn't give anybody any names. - I know.<eos> - The Israelis are looking for me.<eos> I didn't believe them anyway.<eos> They are meeting every day both here in Jerusalem and in Oslo, talking about the partition.<eos> I really believe this time it could work.<eos> How can you say that?<eos> Miral, this road is too bloody. It has no exit.
That corporation that hired us, they won't accept failure.<eos> We won't last two days.<eos> Cobb?<eos> Looks like I'm gonna have to do this a little more simply.<eos> Tell us what you know!<eos> Tell us what you know, now!<eos> [LAUGHING]<eos> SAITO:<eos> I've always hated this carpet.<eos> It's stained and frayed in such distinctive ways.
-What do you want from us?<eos> -Inception.<eos> -Is it possible?<eos> -Of course not.<eos> If you can steal an idea from someone's mind why can't you plant one there instead?<eos> Okay, here's me planting an idea in your head.<eos> I say, "Don't think about elephants." What are you thinking about?<eos> Elephants.<eos> Right.<eos> But it's not your idea, because you know I gave it to you.
You still working with that stick in the mud?<eos> He is good at what he does, right?<eos> Oh, he's the best, but he has no imagination.<eos> Not like you.<eos> Listen, if you're gonna perform inception, you need imagination.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Have you done it before?<eos> We tried it.<eos> Uh, we got the idea in place, but it didn't take.<eos> -You didn't plant it deep enough?

EAMES:<eos> The vu/tures are circling.<eos> And the sicker Maurice Fischer becomes, the more povven'u/ Peter Browning becomes.<eos> I've had ample opportunity to observe Browning end adopt his physical presence, study his mennerisms, and so on and so forth.<eos> So now in the first layer of the dream, I can impersonate Browning.<eos> And suggest concepts to Fischer's conscious mind.<eos> Then, when we take him a level deeper his own projection of Browning should feed that right back to him.<eos> So he gives himself the idea.<eos> Precisely.<eos> That's the only way it will stick.

- 10.40.<eos> And yours?<eos> - 11.05.<eos> Where's your coat?<eos> Shit!<eos> Hello, excuse me, I've lost my coat.<eos> Where's lost and found please?<eos> First corridor on the left.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> is it gone?
I've been using it as a bookmark.<eos> That's him.<eos> My best friend's son is called Elias.<eos> It was so difficult to find a name for him.<eos> Giving a child a name seems hard.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you think a man or a woman stole my coat?<eos> No idea.<eos> Perhaps it's hanging in an office somewhere.

Well, great.<eos> (Funky Music)<eos> (Confused voices.)<eos> Well, well, well, the Teufelspickles with their soccer-Barbie.<eos> Steal away, Mark.<eos> Hua!<eos> Give it back!<eos> You want the ball?<eos> How was it:<eos> If we take it off you and keep it for five minutes, it belongs to us.

We'll rap later.<eos> - Let him know who run things, Matthew.<eos> - Yeah, Big M.<eos> Move, guys.<eos> Back.<eos> You know how to get off your head?<eos> So, what's your next move?<eos> You still filing that writ?<eos> Yeah, just need to get it signed.<eos> Got it right here in front of me.

Over here.<eos> Fang Da.<eos> Mom, I want out.<eos> I don't want to stay here<eos> Be good.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> Mom's here.<eos> We'll get you out soon.<eos> My arm hurts.<eos> It's killing me.
Fang Da,<eos> Hurry and eat breakfast. Give me the towel.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> Go on in.<eos> Hurry and eat.<eos> When you finish, put your arm on.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> It hurts too much. You still need to wear it.<eos> Young men need to look decent.<eos> Also... It was very expensive.
It's not right.<eos> Officer...<eos> You're an army officer,<eos> I'm disabled.<eos> Please help me.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yes. Though I'm missing an arm, my legs are fine.<eos> I bike over here every day.<eos> What happened to your arm?<eos> It was crushed in the 1976 Tangshan earthquake.
Hurry, everyone!<eos> Quick!<eos> I'm dying of hunger!<eos> Nobody around.<eos> Looks like this is another village torched by the Cai army.<eos> We're all very tired.<eos> Clean this place up a bit. I think we can spend the night here.<eos> Master, look. It seems that the Cai troops have us trapped in this valley.<eos> Master, I've found a small mountain path.<eos> It's very narrow, but I think it may lead down the mountain.
Of course none of them is a Jew!<eos> Comments on the Jewish question don't belong to the film reviews, but to the politics section!<eos> And there, this film is a marvelous occasion, of course.<eos> The tenor should be like:<eos> At least since the start of the war, the Jews are our officially declared enemies!<eos> And such have always been detained, 828 01:15:33,549 -- 01:15:37,064 to prevent sabotage and espionage.<eos> And that's just how the enemies treat us Germans.<eos> And who, my dear friends, does pity us?<eos> The Fuehrer... already predicted it in January '39 .<eos> If the Jews provoke war one more time, it will end with their annihilation!
I got you an ice cream.<eos> That's so nice. Thank you.<eos> And I paid for it over there.<eos> Thank you.<eos> See you.<eos> See you.<eos> And earlier that day, I had made a cherry cake.<eos> And I used... I didn't know until afterwards, I used a new product.<eos> I never made it again, that Fluffo.<eos> I served the cake, and then... It stuck to the roof of their mouth.
I'm on the...<eos> Wait outside.<eos> Wait outside.<eos> Did you come here so I can break your fucking neck?<eos> What?<eos> I got the money.<eos> What money?<eos> You said if I got $1,800, then I could have the car back.<eos> Are you kidding? I said even if you had $1,800, I still couldn't sell it to you.<eos> It's not here anymore, anyway.
- T.J.! No!<eos> Fuck both of you motherfuckers!<eos> You okay?<eos> T.J.?<eos> - Where's my car?<eos> - What the fuck!<eos> - Where's the fucking car?<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Make me ask one more time, your fucking toe's coming off. Where is it?<eos> It's gone to the wrecker's!
- Where's the fucking car?<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> Make me ask one more time, your fucking toe's coming off. Where is it?<eos> It's gone to the wrecker's!<eos> Fuck!<eos> It's gone to the fucking wrecking yard, fool!<eos> That's fucking bullshit.<eos> Why would I be lying?<eos> Because you're a fucking asshole!<eos> Now, tell me where it is!

A kingbolt?<eos> You were armed and he advanced upon you with nothing more than a kingbolt?<eos> From a wagon tongue?<eos> I've seen men badly tore up with nothing bigger than a kingbolt.<eos> - I defended myself.<eos> - Returning to the other encounter, with Aaron Wharton and his two remaining sons.<eos> You sprang from cover with your revolver in hand.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Loaded and cocked?<eos> If it ain't loaded and cocked, it don't shoot.
There is a posse of officers up there who will force you to go.<eos> That is interesting news.<eos> How many is up there?<eos> Right around 50. And they're all well-armed and they mean business.<eos> What I want you to do now is come on across the creek and walk in front of me up that hill.<eos> I think I will oblige the officers to come after me.<eos> Well, if you refuse to go, I will have to shoot you.<eos> Well, then, you had better cock your piece.<eos> All the way back.<eos> - Till it locks.
I'm sorry.<eos> You okay?<eos> What?<eos> Always be the summoner, never the summoned.<eos> Don't do it, Bannen.<eos> You're breaking the rule.<eos> Excuse me, sir, ever heard of a crosswalk?<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Can I see some ID?<eos> It wouldn't happen to be in any of those three wallets, would it?
Yeah, good evening...<eos> I'm your sister in law!<eos> Glasses, contacts, surgery, new technologies...nothing, eh?<eos> You already have two glasses in your hands.<eos> Please help yourself.<eos> Stefania, do you know Brunetti's joke about the cop who couldn't find the shift?<eos> - We're still laughing.<eos> - No, what about it?<eos> - Raffaele.<eos> - But I must warn the ladies... - ...it's a bit vulgar.
Honey, what the hell is this?<eos> Honey, wake up...<eos> Thrust the sword and rip open the hell. Rise to Heaven.<eos> Thrust the sword and rip open the hell. Rise to Heaven.<eos> Thrust the sword and rip open the hell. Rise to Heaven.<eos> Sweetie.<eos> Come. Take a look for me.<eos> Is there a thorn in my finger?<eos> Let me have a look.<eos> Ouch! Here it is.
You mean for the department?<eos> Yeah. Are you going?<eos> I guess we have to. Are you?<eos> That's my name.<eos> I usually teach 209, but Newbery had an emergency so I'm filling in for him.<eos> Can anybody tell me what chapter you guys are working on?<eos> I...<eos> We watched a video last time, ma'am.<eos> Is that so?<eos> Yes, ma'am. Was it relevant to the course in any way?
Follow me, please.<eos> Sean, thanks for coming.<eos> Hey, how was your drive?<eos> Just fine.<eos> Good. Let me know if there's anything you need while in San Diego, anything at all.<eos> Thanks.<eos> He was a beggar at the airport when we met him, and now, he practically runs the entire center when I'm on the road, which is about<eos> 10 months out of the year. Well, I'm glad you were in town.<eos> I've been wanting to see your operation since we talked in Miami.<eos> Well, here it is, in all its glamour.
sir.<eos> The link is nothing more an idea.<eos> Then we need something to make the contact physical.<eos> Something...<eos> - so simple.<eos> - So small and shining.<eos> The tiny burning.<eos> Small enough to follow the link.<eos> And if this were on Earth.<eos> The sound... it's coming from above.
Look, I am not your punishment.<eos> But if you refuse to cooperate, I have no choice but to isolate you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Goodyear, get him out of here.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Hurry up, Max. I don't have all day.<eos> What's the rush, Miss Biggs?<eos> So, what is it today, Max?<eos> Is it about your HIV test?<eos> Don't worry, it's negative, you can stop spreading those rumors.
Was it all in my head, or is there really a God who can breathe life into me and make me feel his presence?<eos> So this is actually what encouraged me to write the book.<eos> And honestly it completely changed the way that I look at life...<eos> Assume that there was a Higher Power, that It created the universe, until God set a bush on fire...<eos> And maybe I did. ...and said, "Oh, by the way, you were right. "<eos> You know, and... I think - I think I'm ready to get out.<eos> Next up here is Gerald from southwest Detroit.<eos> - Welcome, Gerald.<eos> - I just want to say, I got this book and they say that when you experience a spiritual truth, that it comes to you through sound.<eos> If you let this sound go through you, it changes you, you know?

To the people I love the most.<eos> I've been a poor father.<eos> Been trying so hard to find myself that I forgot myself.<eos> I forgot who I am,<eos> Which is a husband and a father. And, yes, I have not been the muslim I should have been.<eos> But who here has?<eos> Who here has, except for arshad al-masri?<eos> And what is your name, solly?<eos> My name is Mahmud nasir.<eos> And for once, yes, for a very short period, It was solly shimshileewitz.
Are you all right? Are you afraid?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> But I'm more afraid you'll give up. You're the only hope for our family.<eos> I'm waiting for you to come to your senses.<eos> You always seek a worthy opponent. Yuan... and yourself.<eos> You're not an invalid.<eos> You never accept defeat.<eos> Try some.<eos> Now I understand why your wine is so special. Why?<eos> Because it contains your essence.
Soon my strength will return. And I will rescue our son.<eos> Great levitating skill!<eos> I've never met a skilled master like you.<eos> Please take me as your disciple.<eos> For revenge? - How do you know?<eos> Your eyes revealed everything!<eos> To be our disciple you must first defeat the God of Wushu.<eos> The God of Wushu? How can I defeat him?<eos> Your right arm was damaged.<eos> Now it's healed but you've lost your confidence, right?
Most of my friends have gone.<eos> Hit you hard when Gordon died, didn't it?<eos> And his wife.<eos> Is she gone?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, yeah, they're both gone now.<eos> Funnily enough, I was thinking about him on the way down.<eos> I looked out the windows when we were in Lincolnshire,<eos> I saw this fucking tree.<eos> It rem...

- Where...?<eos> - ln the shed behind the station<eos> Go ahead, I'm coming<eos> - Shall I come along?<eos> - No, I'll be back soon<eos> You finish your filthy job, then we'll have breakfast together<eos> Madam, this is a large area<eos> Two men cover it<eos> There's one of the workers<eos> This is my last letter l don't know whether it will reach you
Okay, stop.<eos> Okay, hold it steady. This astronaut crew was chosen to ferry the telescope to space.<eos> Hello, hello, hello.<eos> They launched from the Kennedy Space Center aboard the shuttle Discovery.<eos> T-minus 10, go for main engine start.<eos> We are go for main engine start.<eos> T-minus six, five, four... three, two, one.<eos> And liftoff.<eos> With the sea and clouds of Earth reflecting on its door... the great silver bird was released to soar in orbit 320 miles above us.<eos> Soon it would be sending images back to us.
Hubble was launched once again.<eos> In the next 10 years, three more astronaut crews... would repair and enhance Hubble's vision even further... transporting us to places we could only have dreamed about.<eos> In a stream of staggering images... Hubble revealed the powerful prolonged aurora on Saturn.<eos> The haunting gaze of a dying star, the Helix Nebula.<eos> The awesome Eagle Nebula, known as the pillars of creation... a birthplace of stars.<eos> And the Mice... a pair of galaxies twisted and torn by their gravitational dance.<eos> Hubble captured imagery so complex... we can actually travel through it.<eos> This is real star travel.<eos> The bright star passing by is Sirius.<eos> It's one of the nearest to Earth, a mere 50 trillion miles away.
There are amazing things happening inside these clouds.<eos> As we look through Hubble's eye... we're getting to see them as never before.<eos> We're descending into a gargantuan canyon of clouds.<eos> It's 90 trillion miles across.<eos> It's a star nursery.<eos> The biggest of the young stars are right in the center of the nursery.<eos> Their energy creates unbelievably strong winds... howling down this vast canyon at five million miles an hour.<eos> The winds have blasted out a huge bowl-shaped cavity... in the side of the cloud facing the Earth... giving Hubble and us... a window on the secret life of the stars inside.<eos> The biggest star here is surrounded by a flock of baby stars... each nested in its own cocoon.<eos> The wind from the giant star is blowing so hard against these little ones... it creates shock waves on their near sides, and long tails behind.
It was a night pass.<eos> It was dark out... which added to the trauma.<eos> It seemed kind of cold and lonely out there.<eos> I couldn't wake up out of this nightmare that was occurring.<eos> After hours of failed attempts... the flight controllers finally tell them, "Just break it off."<eos> Think we're gonna be able to get this, Drew?<eos> I think once he busts off the handrail... the rest is gonna go smooth as silk.<eos> Okay, Mass.<eos> MASSl M I NO: Here we go.<eos> MASSl M I NO: It's off!
- Do you have nude pictures of her?<eos> - No.<eos> Will you buy some?<eos> Oh, how funny. Bricklayer, look at him.<eos> He looks like Rune.<eos> - He has the same hairstyle.<eos> - He damn has.<eos> Is the carpet done properly clean?<eos> Is it cleaned properly?<eos> So clean, that you could put a baby on it?
- Do we know each other?<eos> I saw you photographing your mom in the hospital.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> My name's Fabio.<eos> Alice.<eos> Little Red Riding Hood, Little Red Riding Hood...<eos> Never trust a stranger who approaches you with kindness.<eos> Beauty does not accompany wisdom.<eos> The wolf takes on the strangest forms of life.<eos> But never, never will it reveal its real intent.
It's all going to change.<eos> You're a gift. And everyone will know it soon.<eos> Powering down.<eos> What are you talking about? It's been working great in the demos for Defense.<eos> Yeah. This chip... Beyond expectations.<eos> ...in this chassis works great.<eos> But take it out, put it in any of the other bodies, and it's a moron.<eos> What? Is that true?<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> Put this chip in any other body, and it doesn't innovate, doesn't anticipate.
Yeah. This chip... Beyond expectations.<eos> ...in this chassis works great.<eos> But take it out, put it in any of the other bodies, and it's a moron.<eos> What? Is that true?<eos> Yes, it's true.<eos> Put this chip in any other body, and it doesn't innovate, doesn't anticipate.<eos> All the bodies are identical, but the MCP only works in this one.<eos> That can't be.<eos> The bodies are functionally isomorphic.<eos> It can't know which one it's in.
She just said that there'd be a new family waiting for us on Gemenon.<eos> A new family?<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's the last thing I heard her say.<eos> A new family.<eos> So the problem with the MCP is that it's only gonna work in this one body. I...<eos> And I think... I think the MCP is diffusing some of its control to the peripheral subunits of this... Of this particular model.<eos> So, we've made exactly one soldier?<eos> Yeah, but it's a really good one.<eos> Well, I'm glad you like it, but our contract is for 100,000 robots, Philomon.
I don't wanna think...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to think.<eos> I just feel awful and angry and numb, and...<eos> Angry at who?<eos> Everybody and everything.<eos> Myself and the world.<eos> Her, the robot.<eos> The robot didn't do anything.<eos> No, it didn't.
Leo?<eos> This needs to stay between us, OK?<eos> Of course.<eos> You know, I always thought you had a little crush on me in high school.<eos> Your crush on Leo didn't do you much good, either.<eos> No thanks to you.<eos> What a confused and frustrated little triangle that was.<eos> You've got your ring on the wrong hand.<eos> Is that some kind of code?<eos> No... I just broke this finger. It won't fit anymore.
- Yeah!<eos> Just fine. David invited me over.<eos> Will you pause it please? !<eos> He called and we got to talking.<eos> Did you know that his cousin is a lawyer?<eos> No, I didn't know that.<eos> - Yeah, he works in contracts, I thought maybe he can help him out with his 'gum' situation.<eos> I was talking to his cousin, he said that...<eos> ZZZZZZZ....<eos> He said that he thinks he can get me out of the contract or at least renegotiate so that they have to pay me for as long as it's running.
Do you hear me?<eos> Oda!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> They are gone!<eos> They are gone!<eos> They are gone! They are all gone!<eos> To the front. All to the front.<eos> Oh remember!<eos> Death is like a seed so rare hidden in you and your daily toiling, like hazelnut and bright apple star, as velvet plum enfolds it until morning.<eos> Oh remember, there's no escape route, it lives in you as in the sweet fruit.
Yeah...<eos> Mr. Bauer?<eos> Fine.<eos> We're on our way.<eos> Mr. Hastings.<eos> Yes?<eos> I may have a lead on that insider.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I just picked up an unauthorized access in one of the secure databases at the UN.<eos> How do you know it's unauthorized?
Isn't there?<eos> That's why I'm so angry about our lives.<eos> I believe in him, I do!<eos> In the fact that he was a beautiful human being.<eos> I'm sorry. I'll stop now.<eos> Oh, dear.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hi.<eos> I really enjoyed your speech.<eos> It was great.
You know?<eos> No idea.<eos> And I don't care.<eos> Well, you should.<eos> We all... We all should.<eos> Why didn't we go with everyone else?<eos> - Because...<eos> - Why?<eos> Like, when you shut down a movie projector, it doesn't just stop on a dime.<eos> It winds down.
I don't know.<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> It's just a big mystery.<eos> Maybe it's a message from the local Indians or...<eos> Or a word or...<eos> Or just a last word.<eos> Nobody knows for sure.<eos> But maybe it's...<eos> Maybe it's a warning.<eos> A warning, like an error warning your computer gives you right before it crashes.
Conscientious, intelligent, precise. Precious.<eos> We make a good team.<eos> I'm pleased.<eos> I'm pleased, too.<eos> Your scarf's gorgeous.<eos> It's yours.<eos> No, Christine. I can't accept it.<eos> Of course you can.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> It's perfect on you.

It was exactly the same.<eos> If we find it, it'll be intact.<eos> Might I make a request?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Would you allow my client to go with your officers to look for the scarf herself?<eos> Granted.<eos> I give you 3 hours.<eos> But that's the last request!<eos> The scarf means freedom.<eos> It can't have just vanished.
When Washington was, it was all over for America.<eos> His government chased away our best leaders.<eos> All hope was gone.<eos> We were now alone. Me and Mister.<eos> We traveled through a lost land. Small pieces of ci ilizations survived.<eos> Cities that lie behind fences and weapons, for the night to come.<eos> The epidemic is spreading rapidly across the southern states.<eos> They await the Redeemer, but it never came.<eos> Death came for him instead.<eos> And it had teeth.
Hurry up, we will miss the bus.<eos> - We're on holiday!<eos> - I'll wait for you at the front desk.<eos> - Fuck.<eos> - Hurry up.<eos> Yesterday, you promised we would go see the dunes together.<eos> - Relax. promised, promised ....<eos> You promised not to get fat!<eos> Promises ... - The bus is already gone?<eos> - Sometimes it leaves early, sometimes late That's the way here.
Awake?<eos> Audrey, why did you tie me up?<eos> Where're you rushing to?<eos> Audrey, loosen me!<eos> Loosen me!<eos> Why did you tie me up? Audrey, loosen me!<eos> Weren't you paralyzed?<eos> Now you can even drive?<eos> That's excellent!<eos> Take the jewelry. It worth a lot
I've... never met a man who can handle what I do and...<eos> I'm not sure you'll be able to cope, so...<eos> Right.<eos> You know, that's a bad idea.<eos> I'll just go.<eos> Belle, wait!<eos> Don't just walk away.<eos> Belle!<eos> My name's not Belle.<eos> - What is it, then?
I've slept with 1,036 men.<eos> No, I can't top that.<eos> Sometimes I enjoy it.<eos> We're not talking about a life sentence here, just... seeing where it goes.<eos> Yeah, but why would you want to see me when there's all that baggage?<eos> Because I don't see baggage, or a problem.<eos> You're smart and funny.<eos> A bit crazy.<eos> Would you please tell me your real name?<eos> It's Hannah.
I... can't imagine how you must be feeling. But if you'll give me a chance to explain--<eos> Damn it! Don't hurt him!<eos> You take me back!<eos> You take me back right now, you hear!<eos> ? I can't take you back.<eos> The island isn't done with you yet.<eos> What is Desmond doing here?<eos> It will be easier for me to show you than to tell you, Mr. Kwon.<eos> Charles, that--that--that test isn't scheduled till tomorrow.<eos> I know when it's scheduled.
But instead of killing you, I saved your life.<eos> And now I wanna save them, too.<eos> So will you help me?<eos> You feel like we're runnin' in circles?<eos> Back in these cages...<eos> Except last time, the gun was to my head.<eos> He wouldn't have killed me, james.<eos> That cave I told you about, Where all the names are written?<eos> Your name was there, too,<eos> But it was crossed out.
I was doin' just fine<eos> Till you dragged my ass to this damn rock.<eos> No, you weren't.<eos> None of you were.<eos> I didn't pluck any of you out of a happy existence.<eos> You were all flawed.<eos> I chose you because you were like me.<eos> You were all alone.<eos> You were all looking for something That you couldn't find out there.<eos> I chose you because you needed this place As much as it needed you.
Ohh!<eos> Aah.<eos> I'll be seein' ya.<eos> You're not gonna go after him?<eos> I don't need to.<eos> When you said you were gonna destroy the island, I thought you were speaking figuratively.<eos> Because I said I'd leave you in charge once I was gone?<eos> I'm sorry if I left out the part about the island being on the bottom of the ocean.<eos> That being said, you're welcome to join me on my boat.<eos> Because once we get Desmond to do what we need him to do, I'm gonna sail away from this godforsaken place and watch it sink.
- What was what?<eos> Linus, can you hear me?<eos> Come in.<eos> I found Alpert.<eos> Linus?<eos> Damn it.<eos> You okay?<eos> What... what... what happened?<eos> You thought it'd be a good idea to talk to the black smoke.<eos> It responded by throwing you into the damn jungle.
Okay.<eos> Okay, let's do it.<eos> All right.<eos> I'll see you on the other side.<eos> Hey, doctor, back at L.A.X... when we met at baggage claim, you mentioned that they had lost your father.<eos> Did he ever turn up?<eos> As a matter of fact, I got a phone call this morning.<eos> - They, uh... they found the coffin.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> Actually, it might be here already.
Then who are you?<eos> My name is Jacob.<eos> I'm the one who brought your ship to this island.<eos> You brought it here?<eos> Why?<eos> Think of this wine as what you keep calling "hell."<eos> There's many other names for it, too.<eos> "Malevolence."<eos> "Evil." "Darkness."<eos> And here it is, swirling around in the bottle, unable to get out, because if it did, it would spread.
What do you say we go somewhere for a stiff whisky?<eos> Non, non, non.<eos> Non, non, non.<eos> Non, mon cher. We must return to the bedroom of Ellis.<eos> Ellis?<eos> Oh, why?<eos> The stain of ink?<eos> Now you remember perhaps, hah?<eos> Just a stain on the skirting board, Poirot.<eos> But how does it come to be there?
Oh, why?<eos> The stain of ink?<eos> Now you remember perhaps, hah?<eos> Just a stain on the skirting board, Poirot.<eos> But how does it come to be there?<eos> No, something, it is amiss.<eos> - Yes, by God, you're right.<eos> He didn't drop his ink bottle. There'd be more ink. He dropped his fountain pen.<eos> He must have been writing, or the top wouldn't have been off.<eos> Perhaps he laid it on the mantel shelf and it rolled?
You are here because of my grandfather.<eos> He built this ludus.<eos> He believed that no man was without worth.<eos> That even the most vile among us could rise to honor and glory. who in turn passed them on to me. like my forefathers.<eos> A trainer of gladiators.<eos> I see things in men that they themselves have lost.<eos> A small spark.<eos> An ember.<eos> tinder.<eos> Until it ignites in the arena.
That's good.<eos> Good.<eos> How long have you served Domina?<eos> All my life.<eos> I was born in this ludus.<eos> And recently come to blossom.<eos> I barely noticed till I, I saw you at the games with Domina three moons past,<eos> I fought arnoch of tarquinii.<eos> Did you enjoy my victory?<eos> I was pleased. When it ended.
Your gaul is of a fine cut, is he not?<eos> None finer in all the republic.<eos> Such a man.<eos> I tremble to see him again at the arena...<eos> As do we all.<eos> The Thracian yet lives?<eos> For now.<eos> Is there nothing more of interest to see?<eos> Well my husband will shortly announce his primus, and there's is ample wine...<eos> I fear it already beckons my sleep.
You kept your word.<eos> The fault lies with the men who took her life. And with Claudius Glaber, who condemned her to slavery.<eos> There is nothing to be done to change what has passed.<eos> We must look towards the future.<eos> You are the bringer of rain. The slayer of death.<eos> Together we will etch the name Spartacus to the pillars of history.<eos> Spartacus.<eos> That is not what she called me.<eos> That is not my name.<eos> It is now.
Yeah, obviously.<eos> We got to go out the backyard.<eos> The backyard won't work. There's a-a wall.<eos> We'll be trapped.<eos> I vote the backyard.<eos> I told you. We're trapped.<eos> Want to head back?<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Otherwise, step on my hands. We have to go around and get my car.<eos> If they find it, they'll know I was here.
One step at a time, fi.<eos> Lynch is meeting with a thief.<eos> Good news is he's never seen the guy.<eos> I know somebody else he's never seen.<eos> You'll know bolo when you see him?<eos> Yeah, I figured if he's pimping thieves, He must be a fence, so I called barry.<eos> He knew him, Gave me a description of the guy and his car.<eos> And there it is.<eos> Got the cooperation juice ready?<eos> Yeah, it's ready.
It seemed that life had finally found its peace.<eos> [ENGLISH SDH]<eos> FEMALE NARRATOR:<eos> Peace settled on the galaxy.<eos> But it would be a fleeting peace.<eos> For the great sacrifice was in vain.<eos> The end of one war did not signal an end to all wars.<eos> It is a great irony that the nature of war... always reveals the true nature of those who fight.<eos> And from their earliest days, humanity began to fight... war after war.<eos> It swarmed over the earth and there was no ending in sight.
Si-fung, let's go inside the woodshed.<eos> Cut.<eos> Who's laughing?<eos> - I'm sorry. - Sorry.<eos> You again?<eos> Stop messing around.<eos> Let's do it again.<eos> It's him.<eos> I'm romancing her and you're laughing.<eos> Your look not only makes me laugh. It makes me want to puke.
Don't laugh.<eos> Look over here, 1 , 2, 3.<eos> Tigers.<eos> Brats.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Let me buy you a drink.<eos> No thanks, I'm playing dominoes.<eos> Next time, drop by my place.<eos> - Alright.<eos> The second day of the Chinese New Year was always rowdy for us, because it was also Auntie Ngan's birthday.
Thanks a lot.<eos> Hey, Tara.<eos> Mind if I sit?<eos> Well, no. I guess not.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Looks like Sam had one too many.<eos> I never saw him this way.<eos> If you're hungry, you can eat my rings.<eos> I didn't touch them.<eos> My stomach ain't what it was, you know?
You're about to get deader, dead-ass motherfucker.<eos> Cooter.<eos> -Back off.<eos> -Cooter?<eos> -Seriously?<eos> -Call me that again.<eos> I fucking dare you.<eos> Coot can be a little sensitive about his name and the evisceration of his friends.<eos> For future reference, Coot, I'm not a fan of improvisation.<eos> When I give you an order, I expect it to be followed exactly.
Well, her lover, Bill Compton, is...<eos> Was a constituent of mine.<eos> I'd keep an eye on that because I knew she was of interest to my queen.<eos> So no personal attachments?<eos> I do not get attached to humans.<eos> Still, you have to admit, she is quite delectable.<eos> My tastes lie elsewhere.<eos> Lorena thinks you killed one of my werewolves.<eos> I killed a werewolf.<eos> I was not aware it belonged to you.
It might be over between me and Bill, but what we had was real.<eos> And I can't just flip a switch and turn my heart off.<eos> You... ? You know what you sound like?<eos> One of those sad country songs about dumb bitches, who let their men cheat and beat on them all for the sake of true love.<eos> Let me tell you something.<eos> At the end of those songs, the dumb bitches always end up dead.<eos> Did you just call me a dumb bitch?<eos> I'm sorry, but if you go back to that vampire, that's what you are.<eos> What I can do in my brain, it's every bit as deadly as Bill's fangs.<eos> I know what it's like to be afraid of my own body, to not be sure what it's gonna do next.
I feel like there is a being inside this machine, Something alive and vital...<eos> And special.<eos> And it's not our imagination. Look at thtest resul.<eos> There is a brilliant mind in here.<eos> So in terms of practical applications...<eos> Are you seriously asking me about the practical applications Of creating another race that will walk beside us?<eos> Do you not understand the enormity of this creation?<eos> It's more than a machine.<eos> This cylon will become a tireless worker... Who won't need to be paid.<eos> It won't retire or get sick.

Who won't need to be paid.<eos> It won't retire or get sick.<eos> He won't have rights, Or objections, or complaints.<eos> It will do anything and everything we ask of it Without question.
Well, let me know, dear.<eos> You know, if you were to program a robot using a generative model like something in nature, it could benefit from a modulatory input. Yeah.<eos> Like living in the real world.<eos> And those inputs would be different every time.<eos> I mean, each robot would be unique and uncopyable.<eos> That's not really my point.<eos> See, my point is that a robot could benefit from being in the real world.<eos> You know, let it out, explore, get it out of the lab.<eos> Uncopyable.<eos> Because it's analog.
So say we all.<eos> Now it would be great if you guys weren't here.<eos> You too, Keon<eos> Lacy, stay.<eos> Come over here.<eos> I got something I want to show you.<eos> This big enough to hold whatever you're hoping to ship to Gemenon?<eos> Yeah. That'll work.<eos> Look at the tag.<eos> It's a green tag.
I bet you wonder what I really look like, don't you?<eos> Nope.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I like you no matter what, because I love your brain.<eos> You are such a liar.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> You're the smartest person I know, and that's... that's, like, the most beautiful thing.<eos> Remember what you were saying about generative processes?<eos> Genius. It helped me a lot at work.<eos> Yeah, I just meant that if your robot could learn more if it was exposed to more environments.
And here is where it all began.<eos> The Holoband and the MCP?<eos> Uh, no, but, actually, this is where<eos> I first integrated the chip with the chassis and the U-87 became active.<eos> Remarkable.<eos> I guess you could almost say this is the birthplace of artificial life.<eos> Almost.<eos> And that life continues to mature.<eos> We've made remarkable strides with the prototype.<eos> It exceeds the contract's specs in every performance category.
Oh, just saying Tamara's father left when she was a girl and--<eos> That is 1 0-pence psychology.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> "My Buff Orpingtons." "Oh, the written word."<eos> What a fucking freak.<eos> It's a shame the ring doesn't fit.<eos> Why didn't you bring one of mine along when you bought it?<eos> I didn't know you then, did I?<eos> So when did you buy it?<eos> Was it for someone else?
I want a new life with you.<eos> It's a nice dog, Mom.<eos> Well, I don't like having dog hair and slobber all over the place.<eos> But I said yes.<eos> No dogs, no way, and that's final.<eos> You loser, I hate you!<eos> You want to ruin my life!<eos> Live the dream, Jody.<eos> Well, it all runs very smoothly.<eos> I start a book in the summer and publish it the following spring.
Thunderheads<eos> Began moving in the area at 04:00 hours<eos> Lightning...<eos> What if it hits the tower<eos> And detonates the bomb?<eos> Rain is probably ruining<eos> The electrical connections<eos> General, weather forecasters<eos> Have opposed this test for months<eos> It was set within a window
Kill him.<eos> Chuck?<eos> I know kung fu.<eos> Agent Carmichael.<eos> Call me "Charles."<eos> You have something that belongs to my boss, Yuri. The case.<eos> I would like for you to give it to me.<eos> Please?<eos> You show up with no gun and "Please?"<eos> And what, I quiver in fear? Chuck, we've got a lock on the case. It's in the room with you.
It means they will shoot first and ask questions later.<eos> It's funny - You never really know a car Until you drive it through a wall.<eos> This little baby did good.<eos> Hey, keep it out front here, will you?<eos> Just got a quick errand.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> Well, our bomber says it's over here.<eos> That guy does not mess around.<eos> Right up against a load-Bearing wall.<eos> Liquid nitrogen isn't available at the corner store, But it is a standard part of a bomb-Maker's workshop.
La rambla is in barcelona.<eos> You sure you need another drink? Perhaps not.<eos> But that's never stopped me before.<eos> I am going to have to see your passport, though.<eos> Right now.<eos> Sam: crap. My passport?<eos> I don't have it on me.<eos> You need to know my age, you can just ask.<eos> I wouldn't dream of it.<eos> But wherever it is, It had better be stamped "barajas airport, madrid, 2006,"
Sam Axe did.<eos> That's not even the point.<eos> We shouldn't be giving this stuff to Gilroy.<eos> - Is this your card?<eos> - Oh, for God's sake, man. It's the three of clubs.<eos> - Okay, that's not Fi... 'cause she went out for food, like, five minutes ago.<eos> Hey. - Gotta hand it to you, kid.<eos> I had my doubts.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Well, your plan. It worked.
Wicked.<eos> Epic.<eos> Something like no one has ever seen before.<eos> The track will run the length of Terminal Island along some of the narrowest and most harrowing paths that the racing world has to offer.<eos> The best part of it, everything that we need is right in our own backyard.<eos> We're gonna modify each vehicle, adding reinforced steel plating, bulletproof glass, and roll cages to at least give the drivers a fighting chance.<eos> We'll take everything that made Death Match a hit, combine it with everything we have at our disposal.<eos> Such as?<eos> Heavy fucking artillery.<eos> Every car will hold as many guns and as much ammunition as it can.
I don't recall his name.<eos> Frequented the billiard parlors downtown.<eos> He made a comfortable living wagering whether he could swallow certain objects, billiard balls being a specialty.<eos> He'd pick a ball, take it down his gullet to here, then regurgitate it back up.<eos> And one evening I decided to challenge this man to a wager.<eos> Ten thousand in cash for him to do the trick with a billiard ball of my choosing.<eos> Now, he knew I'd seen him do this a dozen times, so I can only surmise that he thought I was stupid.<eos> We laid down the cash and I handed him the cue ball.<eos> He swallowed it down.<eos> It lodged in his throat, and he choked to death on the spot.
Then why does he not grant me audience?<eos> What secrets did Aulus reveal in dying breath, that so inflamed?<eos> That his hand robbed Sura of life.<eos> By command of Batiatus.<eos> You plan vengeance!<eos> You cannot do this!<eos> Spartacus...<eos> That is not what she called me!<eos> Never again will I hear her whisper my true name.<eos> Or taste the joy of it on her lips.
It's not lymphoma.<eos> What happened?<eos> Wilson annexed the Sudetenland.<eos> No abnormal T cells or B cells.<eos> It's not lymphoma.<eos> Liver biopsy only revealed nonspecific inflammation.<eos> Kind of like the time you took your mom's birth control pills on a dare and ended up with swollen nipples.<eos> - That never happened.<eos> - Right. And your nickname all the way up through high school wasn't Erica.<eos> It wasn't.
Let's not get into it right now.<eos> We need to get you through surgery.<eos> I don't wanna go in there knowing that you'll stick with me 'cause that's what good guys do, - But once I'm better, you'll be gone.<eos> - Let's not get into it now.<eos> It hurts.<eos> - Is it her heart?<eos> - No, it's here.<eos> Get her inside.<eos> Your appendix burst, we had to remove it.<eos> And the biopsy confirms it was full of abnormal cells consistent with lymphoma.
It's a mouthful, but probably not as tricky as your title.<eos> - Is Abby gonna be all right?<eos> - Do you travel a lot?<eos> I have a food-import business.<eos> Why? Where'd you go?<eos> All over, France, Italy, the Mediterranean.<eos> Why? I think you exposed her to a parasite.<eos> - I thought the scans didn't show any.<eos> - Because she doesn't have any.<eos> - But you just said. - It's cool. My theory is that her body was able to kill off the parasite, but what it couldn't do was get rid of the shell, which doesn't show up on the scans.
Based on the fact that you were late, and you didn't notice the pictures in the outer office.<eos> Those aren't symptoms.<eos> They are to me.<eos> And here's another one.<eos> You took the case.<eos> Hmm? No negotiating, no bargaining.<eos> No clinic hours changed hands.<eos> Were you looking for something to distract you from the fact that your best friend just threw you out?<eos> Case was interesting.<eos> It's not organic.

No.<eos> It's only just begun.<eos> Behold, the glorious champion of Capua.<eos> A heavy heart weighs a man's sword.<eos> The loss of a brother is heartfelt by every gladiator.<eos> We honor him not with tears, but with blood spilled in the arena.<eos> Spoken as a true champion.<eos> The games against Pompeii approach.<eos> Years I have been robbed of the primus by Solonius and his bribes.<eos> Finally it is secured by our Dominus.
But this year he falls out of favor.<eos> This year the house of Batiatus secures the honor!<eos> Spartacus,<eos> Bringer of rain, to face Pericles,<eos> Titan of Pompeii!<eos> It is to be sine missione?<eos> No quarter given, no mercy shown.<eos> And the purse?<eos> To be on a footing with the match itself.<eos> I would see it paid to Varro's wife.
It fills my heart with joy, to see you so alive.<eos> And would have you remain so.<eos> Naevia...<eos> The primus is a fight to the death, Crixus.<eos> You have been absent the arena many months.<eos> If Pericles were...<eos> Shh. He will not.<eos> How can you be certain?<eos> Because I will never leave your side.<eos> Death itself will tremble if it tries to part us.
Last rites? That means you were -<eos> A priest.<eos> Yes.<eos> Jesuit, actually.<eos> That explains a lot.<eos> Not why you shot him...<eos> Father joe.<eos> Same scenario as janet.<eos> I got a fortune, same as all of you.<eos> It said, "kill your neighbor, and you'll go free."
Till the wideout fumbles.<eos> Ball flips into the air, right into my hands.<eos> Everybody's grabbing at me, clawing me, But I make it into the end zone and hear this crunch.<eos> My knee was gone.<eos> But I didn't even care.<eos> I didn't even feel it.<eos> In the locker room, The team awarded me the game ball.<eos> Billy "lard ass" blackham got the game ball.<eos> Oh, man, I thought I'd lost it.<eos> Now here it is...
This is a woman in her late 20s.<eos> No, it's, uh - it's not janet.<eos> If only you had any idea Of the plans in store for you, janet cooper.<eos> If only...<eos> Kat: It's another woman.<eos> She's in her 40s.<eos> Mark, look at this.<eos> The right hand over here. Renbe:<eos> Where's her right thumb?<eos> It's been severed.
Orson, that takes over an hour to prepare.<eos> Well, I would do it myself, but...<eos> And we're out of vanilla beans, you might have to run to the store.<eos> The act itself is quite simple.<eos> You strip away the outer layer and reveal what's underneath.<eos> Of course, sometimes the results can be quite surprising.<eos> If you strip away the veneer of happy domesticity, you may find grief.<eos> If you strip away that facade of wealth, you may find self-loathing.<eos> If you strip away the veil of helplessness, you may find cruelty.<eos> Yes, stripping can be a dangerous pastime, but for a lucky few, it can also be a lot of fun.
Did you stab yourself?<eos> I have to get to Mike!<eos> ...and a confrontation.<eos> I don't know how you feel, Lynette, because you never talk about it.<eos> We lost a kid.<eos> How can saying this out loud be helpful?<eos> If you want to throw a successful dinner party, there are certain rules that must be followed.<eos> If the good silver is used, it must be polished.<eos> If music is played, the volume should be low.<eos> If the guests bring wine, it must be served.
You've threatened my family for the last time.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I know exactly what scares you, gabriel.<eos> And it's being alone with your immortality.<eos> What did you do to me?<eos> I have trapped you inside your twisted mind.<eos> You're gonna be alone, sylar- very much alone-<eos> In this nightmare that will last forever.<eos> And the best part about it is that when I leave here, You're not gonna remember what I did.<eos> And you're gonna live every empty day like it's real.
Lucky for her, the guy wasn't exactly William Tell.<eos> No.<eos> This guy makes William Tell look like a summer camp archery coach.<eos> We're not dealing with some random shot here.<eos> That's a target designed to take down your enemy without killing them.<eos> Shooter's not an amateur. This guy's a crack marksman.<eos> Not many people in the world could hit that shot.<eos> Where's this arrow?<eos> The police are running tests on it.<eos> It's pretty low tech compared to your titanium missiles.
- Shit!<eos> - Hi, Cass, it's Shannon.<eos> Hello, Shannon, how are you?<eos> - How's it going in New York?<eos> - Yeah, it's great.<eos> - Look, Shannon, i've got to go...<eos> - Did you see a note anywhere?<eos> A note?<eos> No, sorry.<eos> - Okay, but it's quite important.
I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Not with that, I hope.<eos> Jas, I'm gonna go see Jo.<eos> Don't you fucking dare!<eos> Stop!<eos> You fucking dare.<eos> I'm warning you.<eos> My head. Perfect.<eos> Struggle and I'll snap it off.<eos> For fuck's sake, it's bleeding.
Tee's in charge.<eos> Terence.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, hey.<eos> So, what's your name, sweetness?<eos> Sweetness? Wow.<eos> Does that... Does that work for you ever?<eos> Yeah, you'd be surprised.<eos> Okay, well my name is not sweetness, I can assure you that.<eos> It is Joanne.
What maid?<eos> This woman in black. She is your maid?<eos> Yes! Louisa! She's my maid!<eos> She looks worried. Why?<eos> Her eyes, for God's sake!<eos> Look at them! - What about them?<eos> Full of worry!<eos> Charles Faulque.<eos> Nobody can see cancer.<eos> It's invisible.
- He doesn't give a damn about it!<eos> Say you didn't want the other girls to infect you.<eos> How am I supposed to get out?<eos> Meet me here at sundown.<eos> I'll help you get back in.<eos> A quarantine...<eos> I can't believe the lord wouldn't let us use the chapel.<eos> He should've been eaten by the werewolf!<eos> Him and his sons!<eos> With any luck, it'll return and rip them to shreds.
I'd like you to meet Father Brind'amour, in the flesh.<eos> How lucky!<eos> The most famous Jesuit in New France.<eos> I didn't realize word of my exploits had reached this far.<eos> He made a vow of humility, I take it.<eos> Gentlemen, lady, let's have a seat.<eos> You're taking liberties now?<eos> Is everything to your liking, Father?<eos> His cassock seems to like it.<eos> There's nothing it hasn't tried.
What do I do? Just, just play it cool.<eos> Let her come to you.<eos> Is this what cool people do?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just, you know, kinda...<eos> Put out the vibe.<eos> Make a move, walker.<eos> We're wasting time. Excuse me.<eos> Is this seat taken?<eos> Help him out, chuck. Uh..<eos> No, it's not. It's not taken.
Where does rhaskos stand?<eos> The same.<eos> Our numbers are yet shallow.<eos> We must gain Crixus' support and see them rise.<eos> The fucking mad mans still under lock and key.<eos> How will you turn him to cause if you cannot break words with him?<eos> Being champion yet affords privilege.<eos> A way shall present itself.<eos> Answer!<eos> It best "present" fucking soon.
I will see the Gate opened.<eos> But I would have exchange...<eos> This is my price.<eos> To feel you inside me.<eos> To know pale shadow of the love that you felt for her...<eos> I would not have wagered the Gaul such a challenge to Spartacus!<eos> You underestimate the man, aemilia.<eos> Crixus was once champion, was he not?<eos> The match is but newly born.<eos> Much may yet happen as it matures.
Do you really think that I would've pulled the trigger if I didn't know there was a bearing wall six feet away?<eos> If I didn't know that homemade fuse was gonna have at least a three-second delay?<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> I'm going to see Peale's got a referral for us.<eos> I can come.<eos> Ha ha.<eos> No. No, you can't.<eos> No.<eos> See, you can't 'cause the shop's closed.<eos> And it stays closed until you recover.
Ha ha.<eos> No. No, you can't.<eos> No.<eos> See, you can't 'cause the shop's closed.<eos> And it stays closed until you recover.<eos> No discussion.<eos> Thanks for worrying.<eos> But there's nothing to worry about.<eos> It was about a week ago.<eos> I get in the car to go to work and it won't start.
There's a name for the kind of train this just turned into.<eos> How did this happen?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> I'll explain after we get everybody off the train.<eos> We're going 220 miles per hour.<eos> No one is gonna get off of this train.<eos> Run brake assist.<eos> There's a supplemental braking system in the rear car.<eos> It's too weak to slow the entire train at this speed.<eos> But if we separate the car, we can slow it down before it hits the curve.
I'm allyson's supervisor.<eos> I will take part in any meeting with doyle regarding--<eos> He doesn't like you.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You're excused.<eos> This office has been full of leaks For as long as you've been here.<eos> He sees it as evidence of a character defect.<eos> Even if I agree to the demands,<eos> The immunity deal will never hold up.<eos> Sure, it will.
Maybe we should just turn around and keep running until we can find a safer option.<eos> There are gonna be cops all over town gunning for you.<eos> How far do you want to run?<eos> What's the plan?<eos> Please tell me it doesn't involve driving the ambulance right through the front doors of the building.<eos> You ever try that?<eos> Trust me, it's not something you want to do twice.<eos> Put guerrero on.<eos> Ambulance reported stolen.<eos> It's headed your way.

You're clear to fire.
Then get other types of prepared food.<eos> - Yes.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> What does the sign on the door state?<eos> Closed.<eos> Closed means closed, not open.<eos> I know that.<eos> I'm not stupid you know.<eos> Could I borrow the car?<eos> It's at the mechanic's.
Are we going to barbecue?<eos> -Yes, why did you think we were here?<eos> You know, Sally, I had no idea.<eos> You don't notice what's happening around you, do you?<eos> Why don't we barbecue on the veranda?<eos> Senior hates crowds.<eos> He's got social phobia.<eos> You can't use this grill.<eos> Why not?<eos> - Because it's broken.
Happy?<eos> Am I happy? I think so. I think...<eos> Especially when I'm at work.<eos> When I work, I hear these voices. Whose?<eos> The voices of angels?<eos> Are you some kind of saint?<eos> No, voices from the stone.<eos> When I carve it, it tells me where to cut it.<eos> - The stone speaks to you?<eos> - No, not the stone, but what it wants to be.
I would know it if he were dead.<eos> He can't be dead.<eos> I don't allow him to be dead.<eos> I dreamed this would happen and I didn't stop it.<eos> - Why?<eos> It makes no bloody sense.<eos> - It doesn't have to make sense.<eos> - This is part of God's plan, and we have...<eos> - God's plan?<eos> If God has a plan, it's not working out very well, is it?
Good to know.<eos> All right, well, uh, make yourselves comfortable.<eos> I trust I shan't be seeing either of you two again this evening.<eos> The vault is scheduled to open at precisely 8:00.<eos> The unveiling must go off without a hitch.<eos> No more bugs, no more crashes, no more...<eos> No problem.<eos> Problems.<eos> The mask is in this vault.<eos> It opens at 8:00.
Borders go all the way up.<eos> Those stars... are they Belgian?<eos> Of course they are.<eos> But Dad, the earth turns.<eos> So those stars there go to France and become French.<eos> No. Stars travel abroad but they don't like it there.<eos> So they turn around the earth all day and return to Belgium at night, to sleep.<eos> What?<eos> I'm putting the moon inside.<eos> So it can sleep at home.
Yes, yes!<eos> - Pretty daring.<eos> Will you explain the comic and the comic terms to her?<eos> Of course.<eos> - What does SPQR mean?<eos> Senate and People of Rome.<eos> Never heard of it?<eos> - No.<eos> I have look for your black sweater.<eos> Where is it?
- I don't know.<eos> You forgot your snack.<eos> I'm 35, and you still bring me snacks?<eos> Wait, take a little mozzarella.<eos> And a piece of macaroni omelet.<eos> In case you get hungry...<eos> Am I leaving on a trip?<eos> - You have a tape worm.<eos> - When I was a kid!<eos> Besides, if it eats the omelet, the ham and the bread, it's no little tape worm, it's a tape python!
Or already on Benjamin's birthday when we had that horrible argument?<eos> Was that actually about this?<eos> What?<eos> Benjamin's birthday?<eos> And why did you rented a room?<eos> Why not you just go to a hotel?<eos> How did you find that room anyway?<eos> All these preparations before you could even start.<eos> I was lying in bed... and suddenly I saw this hairy arm.<eos> It was lying on my stomach.
They were going to cut a train line through the mountains.<eos> But Jimmy found a sacred burial site.<eos> Bill tried to stop him, but Jimmy went public.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I've written everything down... exactly as I remembered.<eos> Shane?<eos> Hey<eos> How's your day?<eos> It was great.
"Eventually, Jesus grew old.<eos> "He could no longer walk far<eos> "and he could no longer preach in a loud voice.<eos> "One day he announced to his apostles that he was departing.<eos> "The three disciples prayed with him, "gave him water, bathed and fed him.<eos> "After gasping for breath for several days,<eos> "one morning, just as dawn came,<eos> "Jesus passed away."<eos> You rewrote Jesus' death?<eos> It was far too violent.
You look great.<eos> Oliver.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Once you make the call, you have less than an hour before two men come and place the body into a bag.<eos> They charge $1,485 for a cremation and deliver the remains in a small, metal container the size of a jar of peanut butter.<eos> You will need to get a death certificate.<eos> You will need to make copies and send them to cancel every credit card, phone account, utility, gym membership, every insurance policy, mortgage, to settle their taxes.<eos> You will have all their mail forwarded to your address.<eos> You will write their obituary.<eos> You run it with a photo in the paper for $2 a word.
- I didn't!<eos> What a bitch!<eos> - Language, Frances!<eos> At least Olga was genuinely fond of Aunt Louise. Unlike you!<eos> You were always snapping at her.<eos> She thought you were a snivelling little mummy's boy -<eos> Ohildren!<eos> - I'll fetch the port.<eos> - Madame.<eos> Not entirely sure where it's got to, now we no longer have a man about the house.
That this codicil is now shown to be a lie.<eos> So was it in desperation, that she came to you, Madame Drake?<eos> I know it!<eos> I know it in my bones!<eos> You did away with her.<eos> With my poor mistress - and with your husband before that!<eos> You're absolutely raving, girl!<eos> For goodness' sake get a hold of yourself!<eos> You do not deserve to live in this beautiful place!<eos> It is mine! It is mine...
[SIREN WAILS]<eos> Oh, yeah, I got a peek inside lockup. Pemberton's glow stick is MIA.<eos> CHLOE:<eos> Oliver, we have to track it down.<eos> Call you back.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Miss Whitmore?<eos> Do I know you?<eos> If I had to take a guess, I'd say that golden rod doesn't belong to you.<eos> Well, it belongs to me now.
It's ridiculous.<eos> I quote, "Savior/sentient power."<eos> Do you believe in fate, Lois?<eos> Only the kind you make happen.<eos> [GRUNTING]<eos> I was already transferred to three different prisons before I got here today.<eos> Haven't eaten, haven't slept, and I'm burning up, damn it!<eos> I wanna speak to her now!<eos> [GRUNTS]<eos> The helmet, it...

It screwed me up.
She got sick.<eos> I'm retracing her steps.<eos> Was there anything in that chocolate you sold her?<eos> Uh, yeah, fat.<eos> I ate two boxes and gained three pounds.<eos> Okay. Thanks.<eos> Fairy dust.<eos> That was... That was cute.<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> Yeah, I don't know what it is but it comes from some quarry in Smallville.
You know I haven't told anyone your secret.<eos> Only to sell me out to Zod and the others.<eos> No.<eos> So that you could lead them.<eos> You've seen the future, Tess.<eos> You know what happens.<eos> [TESS GRUNTS]<eos> Which is why you have to join the Kandorians and defeat Zod so he doesn't take your powers away.<eos> He doesn't take them, Tess.<eos> Your tower does when it goes online.
Could we get that table by the window? That's our favourite spot.<eos> Oh, I'm really sorry. That table's reserved. Oh, really!<eos> I didn't know that you could reserve tables.<eos> Well, you can now.<eos> We're under new management.<eos> Chester... is it?<eos> Well, this is Nola Devlin.<eos> She edits Belinda Apple's column which I'm sure everyone in America has read.<eos> It's just that, you know, the first saturday of every month we sit at that table.<eos> And this saturday it's reserved.
Yeah.<eos> What am I thinking right now?<eos> You're thinking that you don't wanna tell me all your secrets 'cause it'll make you seem vulnerable.<eos> You're right.<eos> Never talk about my personal life.<eos> All right. I'm gonna do something for you here, okay?<eos> I'm gonna tell you one embarasing thing about me so that we can be equally vulnerable.<eos> That's only fair.<eos> I'm a criminal.<eos> I downloaded a movie ilegally off the Internet before it came out on DVD.
Hey, mom, phil's leaving.<eos> Without a hug?<eos> Wow.<eos> Goodbye, fully articulating, five-function robot<eos> With the ability to -- goodbye.<eos> Brittany, hurry, honey.<eos> Phil's leaving.<eos> Ow. You're fine.<eos> How's your ankle?<eos> It's cold.
It really was the most beautiful butterfly.<eos> I'll believe that when I see it.<eos> Walter, I understand what you're saying about the moth and the man transforming in the same way, but I just don't understand how that could be possible.<eos> It's likely that both developed the ability in response to the same experimental stimulus.<eos> Slide.<eos> You mean the military testing.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Well, why would the military be testing a butterfly?<eos> A butterfly has two stages of life.<eos> It's one of the few creatures with a demonstrated ability to abruptly change its body structure.
- It'll calm him down.<eos> - I didn't think I'd be this nervous.<eos> Happens to everyone, even me.<eos> And look how I turned out.<eos> Lynn... Who is that man?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Must be from Shelley's side.<eos> Just breathe, man.<eos> No, where's your inhaler?<eos> - Where is it?

I know, I heard it too.<eos> Shall I get the door?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> In fact, it would be my preference If you could be someplace else all together. Oh...<eos> Where?<eos> Chicago?<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi. Come on in.<eos> I know a great place.<eos> It's just a couple blocks away.
- He's with me.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't know what happened to these people, Agent Dunham.<eos> My first guess is collective heart failure.<eos> These people died from a heart attack at the same time?<eos> Perhaps it was sympathetic, contagious. Like yawning.<eos> Come on, Walter, you really believe that?<eos> Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights would be out in this car?<eos> No. There should be battery backup.<eos> Unless it wasn't serviced properly.
Excuse me, I'm Dr. Walter Bishop.<eos> Is this the car?<eos> Must be the car.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Here's the initial report.<eos> Think these people died from a heart attack at the same time?<eos> Perhaps it was sympathetic, contagious.<eos> Walter, does your theory suggest why all the lights would be out in this car?<eos> No. There should be battery backup.<eos> Unless it wasn't serviced properly.
I'll name him Ariel.<eos> And I'll love him dearly.<eos> And the two of us will be very happy together.<eos> Very far away from here.<eos> My butt hurts.<eos> Don't be a crybaby.<eos> You know, I'm going to be an actor.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> About a year ago, I was in a commercial.<eos> It was never on TV, but they paid me and everything.
We were hoping we could come here and appeal to you so that nothing happens to him.<eos> Scott Seaver is the reason I'm in here.<eos> Scott Seaver worked for you for two years.<eos> - He had no beef with you.<eos> - Why are you talking in an accent?<eos> - I'm speaking this man's language.<eos> - The man's language is English, Shawn.<eos> What's your point?<eos> I have a point.<eos> It's this:
- You know those are backwards? - What?<eos> That makes all the difference in the world.<eos> - You're looking too low, Shawn.<eos> - No, I'm not. That window was 20 feet off the ground.<eos> The coroner's report said that the exit and entry wounds were the same height.<eos> That means the bullet traveled relatively straight.<eos> Sometimes I have to help my partner with the police aspect.<eos> - But you're not compensating.<eos> - I most certainly am.<eos> But you're looking at the forest like it was five years ago.
- She had Thornburg?<eos> - It's a possibility.<eos> If she had your watch, she may also have had your cooler.<eos> Donny, breathe.<eos> Stop.<eos> Breathe in.<eos> Breathe out.<eos> In, out.<eos> Here, chew this gum.<eos> It's delicious.
Don't be Nic Cage's accent from Con Air.<eos> - We've bathed together before.<eos> - When we were three.<eos> It's essentially the same thing.<eos> It's just impolite to pee.<eos> That feels great, by the way.<eos> Dude, I'm freezing.<eos> Give me your damn sweatshirt.<eos> Ffine.<eos> You're lucky I had it in the car.

Where are you?<eos> Did either of you see when this guy Stu fell out of the boat?<eos> There was so much water pummeling our face we couldn't see anything.<eos> - Mostly consisting of Gus's tears.<eos> - You can't prove that.<eos> The truth is, I found it pretty exhilarating.<eos> The only thing I can compare it to is I found out you could have brownies.<eos> Except in this case, a human being is missing.<eos> - That part was not cool.<eos> - Damn right it's not.
That's true.<eos> But our stories are our own, huh?<eos> We've all got our cross to bear.<eos> Remember your grandfather, my pop? Not well.<eos> He was no picnic.<eos> Was a preacher when I was a boy.<eos> A real old-time religion man.<eos> His God was the lord of war and thunder.<eos> That house was nothing but fear.<eos> And I rebelled, as boys do, chose a path I knew would aggravate, and it did, which is why you barely saw him.
I disobeyed.<eos> You really shouldn't have come.<eos> - You have to stop it.<eos> - Stop what?<eos> 1973?<eos> - Mom?<eos> - John Winchester.<eos> My parents are Mary and John Winchester and I am your grandson.<eos> Mary gets killed by a yellow-eyed demon in 1983.<eos> If we don't catch this thing now and kill it, and it gets away, then Mary dies.
Sunday, April 27, 2003.<eos> This marks 24 hours... of being stuck in Blue John Canyon.<eos> My name is Aron Ralston.<eos> My parents are ...<eos> Donna and Larry Ralston.<eos> From Englewood Colorado.<eos> Whoever finds this, can keep the recorder ... but please get in touch with my parents and give them this tape.<eos> I would appreciate it.<eos> I was descending Blue John yesterday ... when this chalkstone came loose ... and rolled onto my arm.<eos> Now it's stuck.

- I chose this.<eos> Doug is in New York.<eos> So it'll be a quiet weekend.<eos> I chose all of this.<eos> - Call me.<eos> This rock ...<eos> This rock has been waiting for me my entire life.<eos> I hate this rock!<eos> It's entire life.<eos> Ever since it was a bit of meteorite.

Shut up! He'll hear you.<eos> Poor guy, he's crazy about her.<eos> Is your husband here?<eos> No, he's in Mexico.<eos> To his health!<eos> They were going to meet in France.<eos> But it never happened.<eos> And you, are you married?<eos> The truth is that between politics and the war I haven't had much time and now with this face I'll be out of luck.<eos> Well, that beard suits you nicely. It covers up the scar.
****<eos> Are you okay?<eos> To take a cab to school tomorrow.<eos> I'm going to give you money.<eos> Uh,yes,I'll give you money,and we will work out this whole ride thing eventually.<eos> Baze said he'd take me.<eos> Yeah.Baze says a lot of things.<eos> Oh,my God.Where's my engagement ring?<eos> What?<eos> It was right here,and now...

Give what back?<eos> Seriously,I don't have time for this.<eos> The meter's running,and I can't miss school again.<eos> Just give me the ring.<eos> What... what ring? What's wrong?<eos> He freaking stole it!<eos> Cate's ring.<eos> Screw you.I didn't take your damn ring.<eos> Oh,really?<eos> Because I saw you with it,and now it's gone.
Good night.<eos> - Michel? - Monsieur. Another bottle of mineral water, s'il vous plait.<eos> Bien sur.<eos> And, Michel, is everything all right?<eos> - It's Mrs. Hubbard.<eos> She's a fantasist.<eos> She - - She thinks men are after her.<eos> Blind men, if you ask me.<eos> And Michel?<eos> The train, it does not move.
My word of honor.<eos> I did not question your honor.<eos> I am afraid, Poirot, neither of us can be of use to you in this sad investigation.<eos> Non, monsieur.<eos> I spent two years in Washington at a posting to the embassy.<eos> You were there five years ago, I see.<eos> Yes.<eos> So this spot of grease is the result of an official who was careless, eh?<eos> Why does she have to write her name?<eos> S'il vous plait, as it appears in the passport.
This should be the same color.<eos> It's too vibrant.<eos> Not at all.<eos> It suits you.<eos> Don't just wear blue like everyone else.<eos> OK, if you like it.<eos> Wei can make one for me.<eos> She has a sewing machine.<eos> Do you want to see that hawthorn with me?<eos> There are no flowers now. And it's far away.
That's my song.<eos> I know you liked the song, baby, but Bob sent some other songs over that were much better, much more appropriate for you.<eos> I liked them a lot.<eos> This song, it was too, I don't know what.<eos> It was just too...<eos> Too what?<eos> Too good?<eos> Too young?<eos> What?<eos> It wasn't right for you.
Tell her how much you love her music, Travis.<eos> Are you going to play a song for me?<eos> What?<eos> Am I going to play a song for you?<eos> No, you don't have to.<eos> Oh, yes, I am.<eos> I am.<eos> That's why I brought my guys.<eos> Come on in, guys.<eos> There's just one little thing which is, I wrote this new song, and I'm not sure if it's any good, so I was...
No, you don't have to.<eos> Oh, yes, I am.<eos> I am.<eos> That's why I brought my guys.<eos> Come on in, guys.<eos> There's just one little thing which is, I wrote this new song, and I'm not sure if it's any good, so I was...<eos> Thanks.<eos> I was hoping that I could play it for you and you tell me what you think, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's called Travis.

MALE ANNOUNCER:<eos> Good evening, Dallas.<eos> Welcome to the Kelly Canter Encore Tour.<eos> (AUDIENCE CHEERING) Now, to start things off, let's hear it for the man you fell in love with back in nashville,<eos> Beau Hutton!<eos> (AUDIENCE CHEERING)<eos> I'd like to dedicate this first song to Kelly Canter.<eos> She's the reason I'm here.<eos> She's a true talent.<eos> This one's not on the set list, but that doesn't mean it isn't pretty.
This one's for you, Kelly.<eos> (SINGING HIDE ME BABE)<eos> (KNOCKING ON DOOR)<eos> Pretty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You got a pen and paper?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I've been thinking of some things that I want to tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Don't ever wear satin on stage 'cause it wrinkles like anything, and your sweat will show right through it,
No, that--that's not--<eos> Then why do I have to chaperone the ultrasound? Because there's something wrong with the baby.<eos> (lexie) see right there on the left thigh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> On his other ankle, too.<eos> It's a boy? I hadn't gotten that far.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> Congratulations. Uh, there's a lot of swelling on the right foot.<eos> It's--it's very constricted.
How ironic to meet again only to find we're on opposing sides.<eos> The needs of your people are all that matter.<eos> They couldn't be in better hands with you to guide their future.<eos> Kind words indeed from a mindful and committed Jedi.<eos> -And yet...<eos> -What?<eos> -I'm still not sure about the beard.<eos> -Why?<eos> What's wrong with it?<eos> It hides too much of your handsome face.
I need your help.<eos> Have you seen this woman?<eos> Nice disguise.<eos> Seeing you all right is...<eos> Well, it's a relief.<eos> You should turn yourself in.<eos> We've both sworn a loyalty to the Republic.<eos> Believe me, neither one of us is breaking our oath.<eos> And this will prove it.<eos> I need to get it into the proper hands.
We really like each other.<eos> Plus, she is very happy with the new voice on the translator.<eos> The guys just need a little time to tweak it.<eos> - It's close, it's close.<eos> Ohh, it's so close.<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I need you to design me a perfect bagel.<eos> Perfect but somehow evil?<eos> Like halfway down your throat, it triples in size or tells you the end to "Rocky IV"?
This is for the world championship... of the world.<eos> I did it!<eos> I beat you!<eos> Ha!<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> Seriously, what is up with Ted and Phil?<eos> I have to get that bagel.<eos> It's going in my trophy case.<eos> Also, I have to get a trophy case.<eos> Wow, it's way back there.
Yeah, that's how they get your money.<eos> You don't think your son's handsome?<eos> Sure he is.<eos> I mean, with you for a mother.<eos> Let's go find the other people.<eos> Nobody's supposed to make way.<eos> It's hard to believe he was ever this little.<eos> Three years is a long time.<eos> You don't like the vacuum sweeper?<eos> It just makes such a racket.

- It's lunchtime.<eos> - No.<eos> Tommy, come on. Mama's waiting.<eos> - Be a good boy.<eos> - Here.<eos> We'll visit another time, okay?<eos> I got to do it now.<eos> Our best to Angela.<eos> Check his wrist.<eos> - It's faint.
What are you guys doing here?<eos> I told you, Tasha and I had a surprise for you tonight.<eos> Oh... I-I, um... completely forgot.<eos> We thought you could use cheering up.<eos> I got us tickets to a drive-in movie theater in Newburg; they're showing Shaun of the Dead.<eos> Gavin even managed to get a car.<eos> I can't go.<eos> Why not?<eos> Um... because I-I'm not feeling that great.<eos> Yeah, there's something going around school, and I have the worst headache, and-and-and... My throat, feels like it's on fire. Lux!
I'll, uh, I'll do what I can to get to Lenny, all right?<eos> All right, guys.<eos> Do I need to post a chaperone, or can you ladies chat with some civility?<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> Good luck.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's my statement exonerating you for the murder of Edmond Hayes.<eos> And Polly's death has been ruled self-defense, so you're cleared of the homicides.<eos> Of course, there's still the fleeing custody charge, but with your recent medical flare-up, I got it remanded to house arrest.<eos> You'll wear an ankle bracelet for six months and if you behave, you'll have it off in three.
Everyone's fine.<eos> Who's that?<eos> He's someone for Amelia, Nate.<eos> Yeah, he's giving her a ride home.<eos> This is what I need.<eos> Most of this stuff's in the garage.<eos> I'll send Tara out for the rest.<eos> Okay.<eos> How's the drain in that slop sink?<eos> I think it's fine.
And when's that?<eos> What's he doing?<eos> Get down!<eos> Get down!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Girls okay?<eos> Yeah, Casey picked 'em up at the back of the rectory.<eos> Any idea who the shooter was?<eos> Had to have been Jimmy.<eos> No, it wasn't.
- She sometimes gets headaches.<eos> - It's a hell of a headache.<eos> Yeah. I figured we could go to the party and you could maybe sell those instead.<eos> Or...<eos> We could skip the party.<eos> And do what?<eos> Rufus?<eos> No, miss Lily. It's me.<eos> Is that Rufus' scarf?<eos> It was turned in, lost and found.
Historians agree that it sank in a storm while being towed out to sea.<eos> But conspiracy theorists believe it was on a secret mission.<eos> Either way it remains missing to this day.<eos> How do you know all this stuff?<eos> I have a photographic memory, and they sell these in the gift shop.<eos> Only my replica is made of pot metad lacks secret mechanisms.<eos> Find out what FS means and you could be onto something huge.<eos> You mean the sub?<eos> I meant he million dollars of army payroll the sub was rumored to be carrying.<eos> If by some fluke this key is real it could unlock a fortune in gold.
I wasn't pulling her out of a burning building/ automobile/what have you.<eos> I wasn't seeing her on the worst day of her life.<eos> She's just a nice girl, likes to read.<eos> She thinks I'm funny.<eos> Anyway, the rescue's time-sensitive with a highly technical extraction.<eos> Winston, don't do this.<eos> Don't belittle this.<eos> There is a delicate life/work balance here that needs to be respected.<eos> And here's the kicker about this particular rescue.<eos> It involves a break-in at the headquarters of Sentronics.
- 10-4. - We have your position via GPS. - Aw, man.<eos> - Sending units Lima and Bravo.<eos> - 10-4. Thanks.<eos> Don't call for backup to help us clear an empty trailer.<eos> Wh... why would you do that?<eos> Shit.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Whoa whoa whoa. Hold on.<eos> We don't know shit about what's going on inside that place.<eos> Jimmy, it's probably empty.
He'll be able to walk? - Then he'll be perfect.<eos> - Well, that's what you said last time.<eos> That was my fault, Sloan.<eos> - I shoulda let her finish the surgery the first time.<eos> - Now that is an apology. What is that?<eos> What is that thing right there?<eos> - Is that something growing out of his head? - That is a penis.<eos> Sloan, you're gonna make yourself crazy trying to read the ultrasound.<eos> Has her blood pressure always been this high?<eos> Yeah, it's been going up.
It's about being a person.<eos> It's about being a normal woman, for once.<eos> It's not my fault you're not a man.<eos> So don't tell me I'm not a woman.<eos> I literally...<eos> I am full of hatred right now.<eos> Oh, join the freakin' club. W...<eos> Do you know how ridiculous it is that you would take me aside...<eos> There's the heartbeat.<eos> And it's strong.
I have walked this world for nearly six centuries.<eos> As you know i achieve this by bathing in the rejuvenating waters of the Lazarus Pit.<eos> Along with its healing abilities it has long been rumored that it is capable of an even greater feat to raise the dead.<eos> Procuring the remains of your partner was not difficult.<eos> You had come to Bosnia under the guise of Bruce Wayne and you chose to depart as such.<eos> You even concocted the cover story that young Jason had died in a bombing in Sarajevo.<eos> This made it easy for me.<eos> All it took was a few payoffs to replace his body.<eos> i felt confident that you would not perform an autopsy even if you had, we still would have bought enough time.<eos> But my plan well, detective, it had unfortunate results.
"describe your..."<eos> Well, you get the idea.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I sure do.<eos> Remember that ring?<eos> I took it off the first girl we ever did together.<eos> You loved it so much.<eos> Kept asking what happened to it.<eos> I lied.<eos> Said it probably fell off her finger When I was fighting to get her in the van.
You might want to mention that to the people you work for.<eos> You used me.<eos> Oh, I did what I had to do.<eos> How can you do that? How can you just sit there, so smug, so calm?<eos> We're going to get Your girlfriend.<eos> We are not going to let her leave town.<eos> Sure you will.<eos> What can you do?<eos> That basement?<eos> It's clean now.
But I don't want any more money, now, Chad.<eos> I'll give you those tapes. No one will ever know better.<eos> You're right about that much.<eos> Stop.<eos> You can't just kill me.<eos> Think it through, Chad.<eos> They'll catch you.<eos> You don't have some poor sick girl to pin it on this time.<eos> Actually, I do.<eos> But this time her name isn't Summer it's Keelin.
And...<eos> Pinata!<eos> And now the thermostat's broken, and we were wondering if you would tell the company so they'll fix it.<eos> We're worried if we report it, the coany will retaliate, like when I broke the flywheel and they canceled my gym membership.<eos> I mean, you remember how ripped I was gettin'.<eos> Guys, you broke the thermostat.<eos> Just take the high road and report it.<eos> And, Phil, they canceled your gym membership because no matter what class you were in, you did jazzercise.<eos> But I don't want to take the high road.<eos> It's high.
Oh, come on.<eos> That was hilarious.<eos> I hate Pete.<eos> We need to crush that wanker, teach him not to mess with us anymore.<eos> I'm sick of this war.<eos> It just hurts both our teams.<eos> We need to change tactics, figure out a way to get along with Pete... you know, take the high road.<eos> I don't take the high road, Ted.<eos> The high road leads to pansy town.<eos> Or maybe it ads to a more effective way of handling an adversary... ville.
It was just a small driving incident.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - There you go.<eos> Quinn's told me a lot about you.<eos> All good, I hope.<eos> Mm.<eos> You make her very, very happy.<eos> You know that worried look she gets?<eos> It's gone.
You can do this, and you need to do this.<eos> Your work, baby, is important, and it's good, and you need to believe in that.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Are you scared?<eos> I think... that knowing that your dad is there helps.<eos> Is he, though?<eos> I mean...<eos> Does that place even exist?<eos> Of course it does.
Now!<eos> Hit shore, hit shore!<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Welcome to Guadalcanal.<eos> Man: Move it up the beach, Marines.<eos> Ah, now I've got you, you son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, now what do I do?<eos> I think the islanders use a machete or a rock.<eos> Try using your head, Chuckler.<eos> It's big and rocklike.
They couldn't control the fire so they scuttled her.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> Yeah, well, she went down with half the battalion's ammo, most of our grub and medical supplies and all our ass-wipe.<eos> Let's dig in, Marines!<eos> Start digging' in.<eos> - Here.<eos> - Hey, Phillips.<eos> Want some?<eos> It's Jap wine left behind.<eos> It's made out of donkey piss but it's not bad.
All right, that's it. Hey, finish it.<eos> "So I'll leave you knowing that like the poem says,<eos> 'You're a better man than I am, Gunga Din. '<eos> Your humble and obedient servant, Eugene Sledge. "<eos> So your friend wants to be a Marine?<eos> Yeah, but his father won't let him.<eos> He's got a heart murmur.<eos> Ah, a murmuring heart.<eos> Hey, when's your birthday, Sid?<eos> It was a couple weeks ago.
- The japs surrendered. - Man:<eos> What?<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - The war is over.<eos> Man #2: Did you hear that?<eos> Definite.<eos> On the radio.<eos> - Man #3: The war's over!<eos> - The war's over.<eos> It's over.

The McCulloch boosted my .<eos> It only adds four p.S.I., snaf.<eos> You get better torque.<eos> You know that.<eos> Yeah, well, you run that thing for a while and it'll get noisy.<eos> So?<eos> - How you doin', boys?<eos> - Skipper.<eos> Gunny made some coffee if anyone wants some.<eos> It's actually pretty good.
Just gettíng to the poínt where l can sleep through the níght agaín.<eos> Good, good.<eos> You gotta get your rest.<eos> - Keller.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Five minutes.<eos> - Okay, that's great.<eos> That is the Mayflower signature right there.<eos> That glass has been through so much.<eos> You can see the care that went into making it.
She sounds good, your mum.<eos> I'll keep it for later.<eos> This wall is solid and the crack doesn't go all the way through it.<eos> So here's a thing, where's the draught coming from?<eos> Wibbly-wobbly, timey-wimey. You know what the crack is?<eos> What?<eos> It's a crack.<eos> I'll tell you something funny.<eos> If you knocked this wall down, the crack would stay put, cos the crack isn't in the wall.<eos> - Where is it, then?
Prisoner Zero has escaped.<eos> That's what I heard.<eos> What does it mean?<eos> Prisoner zero has escaped.<eos> It means that, on the other side of this wall, there's a prison and they've lost a prisoner.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> - What?<eos> - You need a better wall.<eos> The only way to close the breach is to open it all the way.<eos> The forces will invert and it'll snap itself shut.
I lost it.<eos> How can you have lost it?<eos> Stay away from that door!<eos> Do not touch that door!<eos> Listen to me!<eos> Do not open that...<eos> Why does no-one ever listen to me?<eos> Do I have a face that nobody listens to?<eos> Again...?<eos> My screwdriver, where is it?
Do I have a face that nobody listens to?<eos> Again...?<eos> My screwdriver, where is it?<eos> Silver thing, blue at the end.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> There stopped you seeing the room. What makes you think you could see it?<eos> Now. Please, just get out!<eos> - Silver, blue at the end?<eos> - My screwdriver, yeah.<eos> It's here.
Silver thing, blue at the end.<eos> There's nothing here.<eos> There stopped you seeing the room. What makes you think you could see it?<eos> Now. Please, just get out!<eos> - Silver, blue at the end?<eos> - My screwdriver, yeah.<eos> It's here.<eos> Must have rolled under the door.<eos> Yeah. Must have.<eos> And then it must have jumped up on the table...
Dying?<eos> We picked up a trace.<eos> One of the Progenitor devices.<eos> Progenitor?<eos> What's that when it's at home?<eos> It is our past. And our future.<eos> That's deep.<eos> That is deep for a Dalek.<eos> - What does it mean, though?<eos> - It contains pure Dalek DNA, thousands were created, all were lost, save one.
I get it!<eos> I get it this is rich!<eos> The Progenitor wouldn't recognize you, would it?<eos> It saw you as impure, the DNA is unrecognizable as Dalek.<eos> - A solution was devised.<eos> - Yes, yes. Me.<eos> My testimony.<eos> You set a trap, you knew that the Progenitor would recognize me.<eos> The Daleks' greatest enemy!<eos> It would accept my word.
Okay, you are so crazy.<eos> That song totally rules.<eos> Dad, you're crazy.<eos> Crazy right.<eos> Hey, honey. Hi.<eos> Hey, mom.<eos> No, seriously, dad.<eos> It's lame.<eos> Seriously, luke.<eos> It's not.
We'll talk about it when he gets home. Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> But I am telling him that every time he looks at porn,<eos> God kills a puppy.<eos> Maybe I should be the one to talk to him.<eos> I am a very lucky woman.<eos> I have a wonderful family, a beautiful home.<eos> There's nothing that I would change.<eos> I hate the dog butler.<eos> I keep forgetting it's there, And every time it happens, it scares me all over again.
Sten hanged himself last night. Mrs Duner found his body this morning.<eos> Kurt Wallander.<eos> He said you were his last hope.<eos> Where were you?<eos> HE BREATHES HEAVILY<eos> ENGINE TURNS OVER<eos> ENGINE TURNS OVER IGNITION FIRES<eos> Gustaf Torstensson's car.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Is this exactly how it was brought in?
HE BREATHES HEAVILY<eos> ENGINE TURNS OVER<eos> ENGINE TURNS OVER IGNITION FIRES<eos> Gustaf Torstensson's car.<eos> Mm-hm.<eos> Is this exactly how it was brought in?<eos> MUSICAL RING TONE PLAYS<eos> Hello?<eos> It arrived some weeks ago.<eos> I said Sten should take it to the police.
As you were.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Crew, make fast the topping lift.<eos> I'll get the rope.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Damn, he's ghost riding the jib.<eos> Hang on!<eos> That hat's gone.<eos> Lost at sea. I might be able to reach it!<eos> It landed on that Hyundai.
Excuse me.<eos> My God.<eos> When I saw the nurse's chart said "Hiro Nakamura," I couldn't believe it.<eos> It's been an awful long time, Hiro, ever since the Burnt Toast Diner,<eos> 65 years ago.<eos> We have to focus.<eos> We have to think of something.<eos> {\*Dad, }You have a plan.<eos> I know you have a plan.<eos> - What is it?
But look, you have nothing to be embarrassed or ashamed of.<eos> I mean, I don't... I don't know why you would lie.<eos> Well, why do you?<eos> About dating Ryan?<eos> The whole event down there is a lie.<eos> Your whole persona.<eos> Okay, I know that right now this seems like a really big deal.<eos> And I am not saying that it isn't, but that letter, that letter was sweet.<eos> And anyone who reads it would see that.<eos> It's not sweet.
I mean, I don't...

I'll tell you when we're on the ground.<eos> What's he waiting for?<eos> What? The second guy.<eos> His buddy's been chained up Ever since we opened the cockpit.<eos> All that confusion, He had every opportunity to help his friend. Why didn't he?<eos> We got about five minutes until the storm hits.<eos> We should move.<eos> I'm about to do the craziest thing<eos> I've ever done in my life with you, And I don't even know your name.<eos> I think we both know it isn't martin gill.
A lot.<eos> I don't want to be taken away.<eos> But I can't help feeling the way that I feel either.<eos> Hi, I'm sorry to just show up here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Well, I know how upset you've been with me about Tasha.<eos> And I know that I couldn't help her, but I thought maybe I could help you.<eos> I know that you need a job and I've got one for you. Are you serious?<eos> It's at the station.<eos> And it's yours iu want it.
When would you like me to do that?<eos> Immediately.<eos> Children can see it.<eos> There are now 117 pins here.<eos> Each one marks a location in this city where alcohol is being warehoused, distilled, or sold.<eos> They operate with impunity, and I do not possess the resources to shut even 10% of them.<eos> I understand.<eos> Then you'll also understand that every one of these pins taken together amounts to nothing.<eos> Here on the south shore of Brigantine and here in the back bays of the inlet, boats unload liquor sailed down from Canada, up from the Caribbean, across the Atlantic.<eos> It is watered down, mixed with poisons, and sold illicitly by a growing class of criminals for whom murder is a means of doing business.
That's the one.<eos> Leo's safe house.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Well, let's see what we can see.<eos> Got something.<eos> In the jacket on the bed.<eos> A receipt from the day before leo disappeared.<eos> Cafe central.<eos> I know this place.<eos> It's three blocks from here.
Oh, god.<eos> Denjuro, you are definitely not my friend.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Huh?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Have you been up all night?<eos> 'Cause it looks like you've killed an entire forest, and your breath smells like something dead.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> Um, the application for the Tisch writing program is due in, uh, in... in two days, so I just... I need to bear down and finish my 1-act.<eos> Is this the same 1-act that you were 95% done with last week, - but didn't want to show me until it was 100% done?
What do you, uh... what do you say we play outside before it gets too dark?<eos> What do you say?<eos> What was that, Mr. Teefers?<eos> You think that sounds like a lot of fun?<eos> He's not there.<eos> He's not?<eos> Well, then, where is he?<eos> Did you hear anything at work about our voting district changing?<eos> No, why?<eos> I got an e-mail from the city that says it moved.
- Gone Norman Bates?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I wasn't the only one out here.<eos> There was a face, like a phantom.<eos> What did it look like?<eos> Black, white and weird all over.<eos> And since this is where my memory hits a roadblock I'm guessing that spirit started driving this dune buggy.<eos> I must have been possessed.<eos> Well, you obviously aren't now.<eos> If that spirit is responsible for this murder, we need to find it before it kills again.
W-what?<eos> When I asked you guys to take care of him, I didn't mean mafia-style.<eos> How am I going to explain this to the guy downstairs<eos> With, like, three guns and a taser?<eos> Don't stress. Gabe will be fine.<eos> The storm drain probably empties out Into a beautiful lake somewhere.<eos> Oh, yeah, totally, with ponies and rainbows, yeah.<eos> We have to find him; this is gabe we're talking about.<eos> He gets scared putting on a hoodie.<eos> Wow, it does have a heart.
About what?<eos> About paradise.<eos> What about it?<eos> I wanna know what the angels are telling you.<eos> Everything.<eos> - Well...<eos> - And you can skip the rainbows.<eos> There's gonna be a prizefight and it's gonna get bad.<eos> But after we win, and we will... the planet gets handed over to the chosen.<eos> And it's finally peaceful.
"And she shall come, bearing false prophecy."<eos> This creature has the power to take a human's form, read minds.<eos> Revelation calls her the Whore of Babylon.<eos> - That's catchy.<eos> - The real Leah was killed months ago.<eos> - What about the demons?<eos> - They're under her control.<eos> - And the Enochian exorcism?<eos> - Fake.<eos> It actually means, "You breed with the mouth of a goat."
- Of course not.<eos> The Whore can only be killed by a true servant of heaven. - Servant, like...?<eos> - Not you.<eos> Or me. Sam, of course, is an abomination.<eos> We'll have to find someone else.<eos> The angels, I don't know why they've chosen us.<eos> But they have.<eos> And today, today they told me the most important thing yet.<eos> Tonight, at midnight...<eos> I'm sorry. It's just that we knew this day would come and it's here.
I get it.<eos> So you know Sam and I would never let anything happen to Bobby.<eos> - He's like a father to us.<eos> - I understand.<eos> And he's lucky to have you, Dean.<eos> But you're not the only one.<eos> Is that so?<eos> I remember everything, you know.<eos> When I died.<eos> That demon taking over my body. The things it made me do.
Thank her.<eos> If it was up to me, you'd be in San Quentin wearing lipstick and a mop wig.<eos> Okay, Mom, I gotta go.<eos> No, I love you.<eos> What?<eos> No, you're not bothering me.<eos> I'm happy to take care of it.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just bought my mom a new computer, and it's opened up quite a can of worms.
He drank this tea. Now he can walk fine and his piss is as clear as water.<eos> Jaai!<eos> Tell Buapan she's not needed tonight.<eos> Okay, but shall I come back?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> My kidney still needs you.<eos> I can't get by without him.<eos> He tried to talk to me but I don't understand the Isaan dialect.<eos> Not Isaan, Tong.<eos> It's Lao, remember?
Now. keep your eyes shut and keep moving!<eos> It's never going to work.<eos> What else have you got?<eos> River. tell me!<eos> What's that?<eos> The Angels. running from the fire.<eos> They came here to feed on the time energy. now it's going to feed on them.<eos> Amy. listen to me.<eos> I'm sending a bit of software to your communicator.<eos> It's a proximity detector. it'll beep if there's something in your way.
Maybe this dream isn't even about Robin.<eos> Maybe it's about how I've been so hurt by men that women are the only safe option left.<eos> Why are you even thinking about relationships at all, with men or women?<eos> You're still fragile.<eos> Now, when you're stronger, then we can talk about who you might be attracted to.<eos> But I'm not attracted to her.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> Women my age don't just wake up one day with a whole new sexual identity.<eos> This dream has got to mean something else.<eos> Well, what it tells me, clearly, is that you are being distracted from your recovery.
- Â¶ To-mah-to Â¶<eos> Â¶ Let's call the whole thing off.... icially on!<eos> Â¶ And toast Valerie and Dave Â¶<eos> Â¶ Togasaki-Rothman! Â¶<eos> You guys will be the hit of cousin Valerie's wedding reception!<eos> Can I just ask, who the hell says po-tah-to?<eos> Songwriters who are stuck.<eos> Homie, I'm still a little nervous about performing in front of all those people.<eos> Don't worry, sweetie.<eos> With me at your side, our toast will do just what it's supposed to:
It's nothing.<eos> One of them must've bumped a car...<eos> You sure?<eos> Happened once before.<eos> Went off a few minutes.<eos> Get the light, Dwayne.<eos> It's the blue one, down the street.<eos> Same one as last time.<eos> I think we're ok.<eos> That noise... Will it bring more of them?
You hungry?<eos> - Your mother is full of thoughts.<eos> - In English we say "thoughtful."<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Hey, you're not wearing your ring.<eos> Gee, I hope there's not a problem.<eos> I am all day thinking about this ring.<eos> I do not want it.<eos> But Preston said you loved it.<eos> I do, but it is too precious.
I do, but it is too precious.<eos> This ring has been in your family for generations, and for you to give it to woman you don't know, it feels wrong.<eos> Save it for Penny.<eos> Wow. What a classy thing to do.<eos> Thank you, Irina.<eos> You can buy me another ring.<eos> You sure?<eos> Nana's ring is worth a lot more than anything I can afford.<eos> Yes, Preston.<eos> I know exactly how much it is worth, but I want your mother to know I am full of thoughts, too.
Real cute, Papa and Mama.<eos> Food for the school.<eos> Birthday cake.<eos> Cut it out!<eos> You don't have the right to ba a Hilko, you were far too happy!<eos> Suffer and fight against the hatred that permeates you!<eos> All your good days are over!<eos> Die!<eos> The wind,<eos> I can feel it blowing.
She sent us ahead to do some preliminary tests.<eos> Helps weed out the nut jobs.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It's a Trifield meter.<eos> Measures DC fields and the natural electromagnetic environment.<eos> Yeah, sometimes old wiring can leak into the atmosphere.<eos> It causes hallucinations, changes in energy.<eos> It's a little more important than that, but whatever.<eos> The tech stuff's not really relevant to you guys anyway.<eos> It's all very relevant, actually.
It's not long.<eos> Long way from Saturnyne, aren't you...<eos> Sister of the Water?<eos> No, let me guess.<eos> The owner of the psychic paper.<eos> Then I take it you're a refugee, like me?<eos> I'll make you a deal.<eos> An answer for an answer.<eos> You're using a perception filter.<eos> It doesn't change your features, but manipulates the brainwaves of the person looking at you.
- No, no. Get back to the TARDIS.<eos> - You can't stop her on your own.<eos> We don't discuss this!<eos> I tell you to do something, Amy, and you do it.<eos> Huh?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What is going on?<eos> The sky, it's like it's boiling.
Yeah.<eos> - You just need a break.<eos> - Can Adam do it ? - Yes.<eos> - Thank you, Adam.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Adam can do it !<eos> - Seriously, I wanna know what you've got going on down here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Looks like you guys had a big day, huh ?<eos> - Oh, it was colossal.
He'll be okay.<eos> You lie. What?<eos> I'm Colombian.<eos> I know a fake crime scene when I see one.<eos> I was hanging up the new poster and it fell on top of him.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You have to tell him. No.<eos> I've been through this before.<eos> When Mitchell was nine, I was supposed to take care of his bird.<eos> It got out and flew into a fan.
It's like ring around the neck.<eos> Oh, my god, and his behavioral aide is gonna be here. At 10:00, and we both need. To be on the same page with all this stuff.<eos> I have a thousand questions that I want to ask her,<eos> And you know what else? I forgot to tell you that haddie has a biology test, You know, and she has not even studied for it.<eos> - Uh...<eos> - Not once.<eos> Really getting me mad. She doesn't even, like,<eos> Care about it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey. Hey, we just had morning sex.<eos> Like, free, bonus, Unadulterated, like, pre-kid morning sex.<eos> Uh-huh. It was nice.

- What's his name?<eos> - Jabbar.<eos> Jabb... jabbar?<eos> - Yeah, jabbar.<eos> - Jabbar. - Jabbar.<eos> - What kind of name is jabbar?<eos> What the hell kind of name is zeek?<eos> It doesn't matter... the name doesn't matter.<eos> What's his last name?<eos> Is it braverman?
- Jabbar.<eos> Jabb... jabbar?<eos> - Yeah, jabbar.<eos> - Jabbar. - Jabbar.<eos> - What kind of name is jabbar?<eos> What the hell kind of name is zeek?<eos> It doesn't matter... the name doesn't matter.<eos> What's his last name?<eos> Is it braverman?<eos> It better be braverman.
I have faith in you.<eos> I wish you did.<eos> The passing of a loved one is a terrible thing, a tragedy that leaves us bereft. Our lives and our world that much smaller.<eos> But what if I told you there was a way to ease this heartache thanks to a breakthrough technology from Graystone Industries?<eos> Johnny, Tessa! Daddy!<eos> Imagine never having to say goodbye to your loved ones again.<eos> Imagine a future without loss brought to you today.<eos> Grace by Graystone.<eos> Because some memories should live forever.<eos> We're still negotiating for the rights to the song, but that's how the finished spot would look when it airs.

Back home.<eos> This is home now.<eos> This is where your family is.<eos> Your obsession with the old world is a distraction.<eos> It ends here.<eos> Guatrau.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> Mighty God, creator and destroyer, whose love binds us in an eternal embrace.<eos> Today, we ask you to welcome a new life to your bosom, as we welcome it to ours.<eos> To nurture and protect this seedling, so that it may grow roots in the most stony of soils and bear lush fruit.
What did you do?<eos> In case you sent your Wizard to find a Listener, I ordered my Mord-Sith to track him.<eos> Once Zedd's found a Listener, Garen will kill them both.<eos> Apparently, I've sealed my own fate, as well as the fate of the world.<eos> Oh, Renn.<eos> Enjoy youth while it lasts.<eos> Before you know it, time sneaks up on you and you have aches in places you didn't even know you had places.<eos> Do an old man a favor.<eos> Pass me that long branch over there.<eos> It'll make a nice walking stick.
You really have grown soft since you started serving the Seeker, haven't you?<eos> It's my fault, I suppose.<eos> I left your training to underlings.<eos> But someone as valuable as you deserves my personal attention.<eos> This time, I won't make the same mistake.<eos> We're right back where we started.<eos> There's no getting through these cliffs.<eos> If we can't go through... we'll go over.<eos> Where's Cara?<eos> Whatever your plan is, it will fail.
You're Zeddicus the Wizard.<eos> That's right.<eos> The Seeker told me to find you.<eos> I can't even sense where the portal is.<eos> Whatever magic allowed you to pass through this rock is beyond my powers.<eos> If you can't get in, what about the spell of taking?<eos> It doesn't work on living things.<eos> I can't use it to get you out of the valley.<eos> No, but you once used it to take the Sword and compass from me.<eos> It might work on the Stone of Tears.
We may have to accept the fact that the Cara we know is gone forever.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> There has to be a way of undoing whatever it was Rahl did to her.<eos> There is one way, but the results are unpredictable.<eos> It's a spell I learned years ago in the Wizard's Keep, but I've never dared use it.<eos> It's called the Spell of Undoing.<eos> According to the ancient texts, it can erase even the most pernicious forms of dark magic.<eos> Do it.<eos> Richard, this spell hasn't been invoked in ages, and for very good reason.<eos> It could undo the magic Darken Rahl inflicted on Cara, but it could also affect her in ways I couldn't even begin to predict.
On your knees, all of you.<eos> Yes, My Lord.<eos> Richard, you've done it.<eos> Why would the absence of one Mord-Sith make such a difference?<eos> Cara was Darken Rahl's most able and trusted Sister of the Agiel.<eos> Maybe without her to lead the attack, they couldn't find us in time.<eos> That would have given you the extra moments you needed to acquire the Power of Orden.<eos> So then what happened with this Cara?<eos> The spell I cast may have killed her or erased her from existence itself.<eos> If this spell was as powerful as it seems, maybe it didn't kill her.
Richard, are you all right?<eos> I'm blind.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> I'll be all right.<eos> Give me the Stone of Tears.<eos> Declan-- You can't get it to the Pillars if you can't see where you're going.<eos> I'll take it there for you.<eos> You're very brave.<eos> But I can't let you take the stone.<eos> You've seen how dangerous it is for anyone who has it.
Kill each other.<eos> Mistress!<eos> Be very careful. If she sees us, she'll confess us.<eos> Not if we finish off Nicci first.<eos> I will save you, mistress.<eos> It's too late.<eos> Then I will avenge you.<eos> Forget revenge.<eos> Bring me the stone.<eos> If its magic is powerful enough to grant eternal life, it may revive me even after I'm dead.
Kahlan, we made it!<eos> Declan, what's happening?<eos> Richard, the Mother Confessor, she's being attacked, by women in red robes.<eos> Sisters of The Dark.<eos> Here.<eos> Take the stone.<eos> Go to the Pillars.<eos> Fast.<eos> Don't worry, Richard.<eos> I'll take it where it needs to go.
You and me get to put our cop hats back on.<eos> You're gonna make me cry.<eos> Oh, please, let me out of here!<eos> We should've known about that damn security camera!<eos> We were seen!<eos> Now the cops are gonna be all over this thing!<eos> Did you take the van back to the store?<eos> I'm not taking the chance of driving it around.<eos> I left it a couple blocks from here.<eos> What if the manager notices it's gone?
How much is this trophy?<eos> Eight bucks.<eos> I give you three.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> I trained a whole year for that trophy.<eos> How about five?<eos> Now it's not for sale. You happy?
Well, I was born into it,<eos> Just like everybody else who grew up around here.<eos> Very cool, very cool.<eos> Okay, um, so what are we drinking?<eos> Compliments of the man at the end of the bar.<eos> He says, "bottoms up to the happy couple."<eos> Hey.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> - So you know that guy?<eos> - It's my dad.
He and I grew up together.<eos> He used to be like a little brother to me.<eos> He used to go out with Denise way back when.<eos> So who's gonna step up?<eos> Who's gonna show Golden Arm<eos> - the night of his life?<eos> - I am, coach!<eos> That was a rhetorical question, Thad, but I appreciate your fire.<eos> Hey, so I think it's awesome you want to show Golden Arm a good time, but, you know, I got this whole plan.<eos> - And it's probably better.
I love you.<eos> Oh, Sarah, it feels so good to finally hear you say that.<eos> Sarah, look outside, quick.<eos> Finally. I'm so hungry.<eos> Isn't it great we found a place that delivers Zamibian food?<eos> Zamibian food?<eos> Hello, Chuck.<eos> Oh, what?<eos> Did you have another bad dream?<eos> It was, it was about Beethoven... and Zamibia...
What are you doing?<eos> What are you looking at over there?<eos> Let's go. We got to go. We're gonna be late for school.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> Listen to me, Champ...<eos> I can't continue this investigation into the police department from the inside.<eos> I don't trust the people I work with.<eos> So I'm gonna have to do this on my own.<eos> It's all about the key.<eos> I just don't know what it's for.
And the Sisters made me read The Hail Mary For at least two hours each time<eos> Here we are, my old home<eos> In those days, these walls were made of wood and iron<eos> Water leaked in during rainy seasons<eos> My dad fixed them all These are cements walls now<eos> Look how solid they are<eos> We didn't have beds at that time<eos> There is a shed up there<eos> Dad made it<eos> That was decades ago and it's still sturdy
- The big deal is<eos> - You broke the truce.<eos> - What truce?<eos> Since the beginning, football ruled B.M.S.<eos> We got the glory, we got the fame and we got the broads.<eos> But in the early '80s a new sport came to campus...<eos> A sport called lacrosse.<eos> The lacrosse players weren't as talented as the football players, but what they lacked in athletic ability, they made up for with their good looks awesome hair and their daddy's money.<eos> In 1982, the campus proved too small for both squads and a war erupted.<eos> No one knows the true origins of the war, but whatever the origins, the war was long and it was brutal.
No shit...<eos> She was there.<eos> Ladies, this...<eos> Is our power.<eos> And under no circumstances do you give up that power until we are married and signed up for half his shit.<eos> Yeah, that's me.<eos> I was so innocent back then.<eos> So I know this was a long time ago, but do you know how the war ended?<eos> Of course.<eos> It was ended by me.
Hey, maybe he should wear sneakers.<eos> It'll be wild, like he's too cool to care.<eos> Or I could just help him keep looking.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Okay. Lynette, help me look for Preston's shoe...<eos> Lynette?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I need your help.<eos> Preston can't find his shoe.<eos> - I put it in the oven.
It can be revenge, but it's definitely a sacrifice.<eos> A wheat ear is in fact a fertility symbol.<eos> It insures a successful pregnancy.<eos> Who can head into the well belong to?<eos> There is certainly no doubt it is considerably older.<eos> There is a scar on the temple, a rectangular surgical scar.<eos> - Not really healed.<eos> - Do you remember Henry Månson, Disa's father?<eos> I don't know how familiar you are with Odin, but according to legend he put Mimir's severed head in a well -<eos> - To consult it.
Call and check where he is.<eos> Disa is it you?<eos> It's Ek.<eos> Two minutes.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> - Two minutes.<eos> - Listen to me.<eos> We have Mimir's head.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - It was in your well.
We have Mimir's head.<eos> - You're lying.<eos> - It was in your well.<eos> With a scar. - Show me the head.<eos> - We want to trade it for Thomas.<eos> We want to trade Thomas for Mimir's head.<eos> - If you have it, show it to me.<eos> - We can't wait any longer, Wern.<eos> Give me two minutes.<eos> You'll see it immediately.
- Oh, sort of part man, part robot.<eos> The organic part must have died off years ago, now the robot part is looking for, well... fresh meat.<eos> - What, us?<eos> - Yeah, it's just like being an organ donor, except you're alive and sort of... screaming.<eos> I need to get behind it, could you draw its fire?<eos> Like you did?<eos> You'll be fine if you're quick, it's only got one arm, literally.<eos> Come here!<eos> Doctor?<eos> Scrambled its circuits, but stay where you are. It could be bluffing.
She can hear me!<eos> But if she can hear me...<eos> Good luck, everyone. Behave.<eos> Do not let that girl open her eyes.<eos> Amy, later!<eos> River, going to need your computer.<eos> Amy, you need to start trusting me. - It's never been more important.<eos> - But you don't always tell me the truth.<eos> If I always told you the truth, I wouldn't need you to trust me.<eos> Doctor, the crack in my wall... how can it be here?
Okay, that's a lot of money. The wise thing to do is invest it in something practical.<eos> Like a jet ski.<eos> Why do you want a jet ski?<eos> All the wealthy and beautiful people in movies ride Jet Skis.<eos> That can't just be a coincidence.<eos> We can't sell it.<eos> We have to keep it and love it and polish it, and only take it out occasionally when we go to the park and reenact our favorite scenes from the movies.<eos> It's sad how great that sounds.<eos> Guys, it's stolen.<eos> It should go back to Peter Jackson.
Wait, just to clarify.<eos> When you get to three, do we stand up or do we pee?<eos> We stand up.<eos> Excellent choice.<eos> Three.<eos> Something tells me this was a bad day to wear suede shoes.<eos> I've done it!<eos> I've won!<eos> The ring is mine!<eos> It's mine!
I've done it!<eos> I've won!<eos> The ring is mine!<eos> It's mine!<eos> We're going to clean it up and make it pretty.<eos> My own.<eos> My love.<eos> My precious.<eos> Where's the ring?<eos> It's in a FedEx box on its way back to where it came from.
Give me!<eos> Give me!<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Give me the ring! It's mine!<eos> Ugh, gotta go back to dating dumb guys from the gym.<eos> Just give me the ring!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> Give me the ring!<eos> I said give it to me!<eos> It's mine!
But surely in a smaller house, where less is expected of you.<eos> It's not likely.<eos> I mean to help until you find something.<eos> I couldn't take your money, my lord.<eos> I can take wages for a job done.<eos> Very good, my lord.<eos> I'll go at once.<eos> There's no need to rush out into the night.<eos> Take the London train tomorrow.<eos> It leaves at 9:00.
Oliver? Oliver?<eos> No.<eos> Zod.<eos> - Change of plans, Agent Campbell.<eos> STUART:<eos> Change of plans?<eos> We just made contact with Mercer's tracker.<eos> I don't care about Mercer or Watchtower.<eos> We decrypted the data. We found the aliens.<eos> Checkmate is going to stop this war before it gets started.
I mean, a lot of good people are going to die.<eos> OLAF: Nothing good comes without sacrifice.<eos> They're martyrs.<eos> It's an honor.<eos> Is it?<eos> Because they're not actually going to Heaven, their scanned avatars are.<eos> And with the push of a button, I could transfer them all right now.<eos> The death of the original, it's...<eos> It's just showmanship.<eos> It's... It's totally irrelevant.

Yeah.<eos> You heard about Shannon and Tamara, right?<eos> I wish them a safe journey.<eos> Listen, Fiddy, I'm sorry about how the score went down.<eos> You know, when you got convicted, a lot of us took it hard, especially Yoseef.<eos> That's big of you to say.<eos> Anyway, excited to be working alongside the famous Adama boys.<eos> You going to be around for a while?<eos> (SPEAKING TAURONESE)<eos> A joke's a lot funnier when it's a joke, Fiddy.
Go! Come on!<eos> I'll get rid of that.<eos> You can't destroy all the shirts.<eos> These Avenging Angels are everywhere.<eos> Sarno makes jokes about them.<eos> Sooner or later, Joseph is going to notice.<eos> What do you want to do, Evelyn?<eos> You want to give up?<eos> No. I want you to take Graystone up on his offer.<eos> I want you to go into the game, find the Tamara avatar and kill it!
Can you prove it?<eos> Yes.<eos> The night of the fundraiser.<eos> Addison rode home in my limo.<eos> You can ask my driver.<eos> Governor Brooks, Michelle wasn't driving the car that was involved in the hit and run.<eos> She took the fall for someone else.<eos> Well, it wasn't Addison, and it certainly wasn't me.<eos> Addison's suicide note was written by a woman.<eos> It was a fake.
Yeah, it's looking good.<eos> Shut up and take your clothes off.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You probably have a bit of a headache.<eos> And I'm sure your throat is pretty sore from all the screaming you did last night.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You've turned into a really beautiful young woman.<eos> And watching you grow up has been one of the great joys in my life.<eos> Can we talk about this neck?<eos> I mean, how long and slender it is?
I don't feel that way about you anymore.<eos> Or right now. I'm-I'm sorry.<eos> But I really...<eos> Really, really want to be friends, huh?<eos> d I'm serious about that.<eos> I like having you back in my life, and...<eos> I want it to stay that way.<eos> It will.<eos> How's the burger?<eos> It's not bad. You want a bite?
You know, it's funny, I never thought you'd like hiking.<eos> Well, I am full of surprises.<eos> Come on, guys, let's geing. Let's do it.<eos> Sorry this isn't really your thing.<eos> I just thought, u know, getting outside, a little physical activity, help you guys, I don't know, get out of your heads, whatever.<eos> No, I totally agree.<eos> I mean, it's already working.<eos> He fist-bumped me.<eos> So what exactly is a seitan burger?<eos> It's like a burger, except instead of the burger part, it has seitan.
I'm gonna hate this movie.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> It's got subtitles.
I wonder if she's slept with him yet.<eos> Oh, don't go there, Charlie.<eos> Don't punish yourself.<eos> Well, if she hasn't already, I'll bet you she does tonight.<eos> Okay, punish yourself.<eos> I mean, what kind of man's gonna sit through a three-hour gay French flick unless he figures he's got a good shot at getting laid afterwards?<eos> You didn't even give that movie a chance.<eos> I'll bet you right now he's driving her back to his place.<eos> They're talking about the movie.<eos> He'll make up some crap about how it made him cry.
Last night was good, right?<eos> It was great, but it doesn't solve our problems.<eos> Sure solved mine.<eos> It's not that I don't love you, but I'm still not sure that we have a future together.<eos> Chelsea, you're really freaking me out here.<eos> I've got to go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Wait.<eos> Oh, I found your mustache.<eos> Where was it?

No biometrics, no lock.<eos> The only way is to get buzzed through by a guard Stationed in the security room.<eos> Let me worry about that.<eos> Grand.<eos> Once I'm through, there's a long stretch of hallway Monitored by a closed-circuit camera.<eos> When I make it down the hallway, I can get into the vault room.<eos> Which safe is it, exactly?<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> And when I find the safe, all I have to do is crack it.<eos> It's high-security and torch-resistant.
- Did you like that?<eos> - Mm-hmm!<eos> I liked it so much, I was thinking We might wanna catch another 40 winks.<eos> - I thought you had a gig.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> What about 10 winks?<eos> - Mm.<eos> - Go on, get outta here.<eos> Mwah. Where's the tux?<eos> - I hung it on the closet door.
That's out of our control.<eos> Now the councilman went the extra mile To make sure you got what you needed.<eos> A trailer?<eos> Y'all want me to put my gang In one fema trailer?<eos> Get the hell out this bar.<eos> Chief...<eos> Have it your way, chief.<eos> I'd have took the trailer.<eos> Then I'd have kicked his ass to the curb, me.<eos> I'd have took it if it came with cable. -
Bed rest is starting to make me crazy.<eos> Well, maybe I can tell you that after I do the exam. Okay.<eos> You're really young, aren't you?<eos> How long since you got out of med school?<eos> I'm not a doctor.<eos> I'm a midwife.<eos> Is she really unavailable?<eos> Can we call her?<eos> Okay. Yeah. Just explain to her that you have to check her cervix.<eos> If it's dilated, send her to the hospital.
Okay, you all ready to play nice?<eos> Always, your honor.<eos> Your honor, since I'm representing myself, I'd like to request that my shackles be removed while I'm in court.<eos> This is only an evidentiary hearing, your honor.<eos> There's no jury to prejudice.<eos> When we go to trial, we can revisit the request, Ms. Taffet.<eos> First witness.<eos> Burn marks were found on the victims that were consistent with injuries one would sustain from a three-million volt stun gun.<eos> The stun gun was found in the suspect's storage locker.<eos> It matches the stun gun that was used in the attack on me, as well as...
You know I'm doing that semester in Hong Kong.<eos> And I told you, if you want to go to Hong Kong with me, You're gonna have to practice!<eos> Yeah, this time it wasn't in my head.<eos> This time I actually did it.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> What did you do?<eos> ! What? Nothing.<eos> I never tried an overhand before.<eos> It got away from me. Oh, my God.
Maybe I knew it wouldn't work out forever.<eos> A woman grows.<eos> Maybe I'll wake up one of these days and see Mischa in a completely new light.<eos> Maybe it'll be over soon.<eos> Tell your mistress that if I see her here again, I'll bite.<eos> There's nothing going on between us.<eos> Excuse me. Check, please.<eos> He can do what he wants, but not right in front of me!<eos> Go, or you'll be late.<eos> The truck's on its way. It'll be in Berlin in an hour.
What you did, what I did, doesn't matter.<eos> What did you do? Doesn't matter.<eos> Charlie, no secrets.<eos> Please, can't I just have one?<eos> Whatever it is, it doesn't matter.<eos> We were separated.<eos> All right, here goes.<eos> I was having pizza with Alan and Jake the other day.<eos> By the way, Jake got a new haircut.<eos> It's just fabulous.
Man, she would just bang on the floor and yell at it. Even gave it a name.<eos> It was Scrabble.<eos> Yeah, that was it.<eos> You know, "Scrabble, just knock it off:"<eos> She got like that toward the... end.<eos> Got obsessive about stuff. Just got mad about stuff.<eos> We didn't know what was up.<eos> It wasn't like her to be that way.<eos> But it turned out that the cancer had spread to her brain and that was why.<eos> It metastasised.
Where the hell is he?<eos> I've been to my oncologist, Jesse just last week.<eos> I'm still in remission.<eos> I'm healthy.<eos> Okay, so good.<eos> Great.<eos> Well no end in sight.<eos> That's great.<eos> Well I missed it.<eos> There was some perfect moment and it passed me right by.
- Actually, your plan's treatment program covers four sessions a week. Actually, she asked the doctor.<eos> Plan-wise, four sessions a week is fairly typical.<eos> And the therapists in your network are mostly fine.<eos> Mostly fine?<eos> Okay.<eos> There's a ringing endorsement.<eos> Look, if Hank had more physical therapy, with better therapists, wouldn't it be more likely he would walk?<eos> It's very hard to say, Marie.<eos> Is the health plan's way medically justifiable?<eos> Sure. Is it absolutely optimal?
I don't know what to say.<eos> This is all so fast.<eos> Did you ever think of the number of things that had to happen for me to get to know you?<eos> But everything happened, and it got me here. What does that mean?<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Yes !<eos> Yes !<eos> You have a ring?<eos> How long have you been thinking about this?<eos> It's been in my family...

I feel like the tin man.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> How are you, Freddy?<eos> Couldn't be better.<eos> I was just talking about you.<eos> Freddy here just ran in from the yard With a $2-million account in his mouth.<eos> - Pond's cold cream.<eos> - Well, that explains why you look so good.<eos> A little early for that, isn't it, don? Very funny.<eos> The pedigree of this account is that it was boosted.

Listen, I'm already high, But this is easier than finding a beer.<eos> If you'd like?<eos> I'd love it.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> I have a boyfriend.<eos> He doesn't own your vagina.<eos> No, but he's renting it.<eos> This film is more interesting than I thought.<eos> It's rhythmic.
I'm sorry.<eos> Do you understand I'm in worse trouble than you are? I just wanted to look pretty.<eos> Come on.<eos> We're gonna try and fix this, okay?<eos> You're not impressed.<eos> My hair smells like I've been frying chicken.<eos> stop it.<eos> This place is very expensive.<eos> That's not it.<eos> It's just not very intimate.
Boys will be boys.<eos> Of course, but I'm going to call in other books.<eos> There's too much to do.<eos> I Know the joke.<eos> -This guy's balls are so big...<eos> -Are we done?<eos> Sure.<eos> Can you tell Ray Charles to come in here and clean this up?<eos> And as soon as you get to Hollywood you find out that that myth is...<eos> Well, it has some truth to it.
I think I killed it.<eos> I'll run this specimen over to the lab.<eos> It's delicious.<eos> You're a haircut, you know that?<eos> You need three ingredients for a cocktail.<eos> Vodka and Mountain Dew is an emergency.<eos> Don wants our freelance art director Joey Baird put on full time for the next three weeks.<eos> None of my business, I suppose.<eos> I really think this vending machine is a troublemaker.<eos> I think it's been a great success.
Ain't nobody gonna stop us.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> - Raylan?<eos> - I think I know where Cooper's money is.<eos> Come on, baby.<eos> We're gonna get that money, I'm gonna buy you anything you want.<eos> Shit.<eos> Got to ask.<eos> Why the hat?<eos> Honestly, I tried it on one time, and it fit.
Previously on Fringe:<eos> In Jacksonville, there was a height chart with names.<eos> Other kids from Walter and Bell's Coretexiphan trials.<eos> I made a list.<eos> Nick Lane and James Heath.<eos> They were both part of Walter's tests.<eos> Of all the children that Walter and I prepared, you were the strongest.<eos> A storm is coming, and when it is over, I fear there will be little left of our world.
I should try to accept it with as good a grace as I could muster.<eos> Would you?<eos> - Oh. Oh, good evening, Taylor.<eos> - Good evening, my lady.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll say good night, Mr Carson.<eos> Look at that scratch.<eos> I'll have to get that sorted out when they're up in London.<eos> - You can hardly see it.<eos> - Well, I'll know it's there.
We've been on a train since dawn and we had to change in a shed.<eos> You don't look dishevelled to me.<eos> Lynch, you don't have to stay with me.<eos> But His Lordship asked me to.<eos> It's a waste of your day.<eos> Help Mr Napier's man get their things back to the house.<eos> His Lordship said - Don't worry, I'll look after her.<eos> We'll make it our business to keep her from harm, I promise.<eos> I hope the day is living up to your expectations.<eos> It's exceeding them in every way.
A heart attack, I suppose, or a stroke or...<eos> He was alive and suddenly, he cried out, and then he was dead.<eos> But why was he here at all?<eos> Did he force himself on you?<eos> Well...we can talk about that later.<eos> Now...we must decide what to do for the best.<eos> There's only one thing we can do.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> It's not possible.<eos> If you don't, we will figure in a scandal of such magnitude, it will never be forgotten until long after we're both dead.
But we're not.<eos> Don't you see that? We're not in control of anything at all.<eos> Edith, go and tell Mary to come back at once and apologise to her grandmother.<eos> No, leave her alone.<eos> She's had a shock.<eos> We all have.<eos> Just let her rest.<eos> Oh, just the ticket.<eos> Nanny always said sweet tea was the thing for frayed nerves.<eos> Though why it has to be sweet, I couldn't tell you.
You haven't asked anything yet.<eos> But you know what it is? When I do.<eos> I'm going to stop here at the pub until I hear from you.<eos> Oh, and take your time.<eos> I'd rather wait a week for the right answer, then... get a wrong one in a hurry.<eos> Think about it carefully.<eos> I will.<eos> I promise you that.<eos> To break the entail, we'd need a private bill in Parliament?<eos> Even then, it would only be passed if the estate were in danger, which it's not.
You mustn't give up.<eos> We'll get there.<eos> Forgive me, my lady, but, well, you don't get it.<eos> You're brought up to think it's all within your grasp, that if you want something enough, it will come to you.<eos> But we're not like that.<eos> We don't think our dreams are bound to come true because...<eos> Because they almost never do.<eos> Then that's why we must stick together.<eos> Your dream is my dream now.<eos> And I'll make it come true.
Okay, Mitchell, I'm gonna teach you a couple of basic Brazilian jiu-jitsu moves.<eos> Now, just- just attack me. I'm sorry<eos> - What?<eos> Take any deep-seated anger you may have, get a running start and come at me.<eos> Dad, I don't have any deep-seated anger.<eos> Remember that Halloween when I wouldn't let you go as Olivia Newton-John? [Yells]<eos> You see what I did?<eos> I used your momentum against you.<eos> I learned this choke from the Gracie brothers.<eos> It's called the lion killer- mata leão.
Guys?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Oh, it's a miracle.<eos> FRED:<eos> What happened to you last night, Velma?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I couldn't sleep, so I went for a walk by the lake.<eos> But then that fog rolled in and...<eos> Well, I must have gotten lost.<eos> I sat down to wait until it lifted and I must have fallen asleep.
Cool.<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, can I get a chai latte, please?<eos> Thanks.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Shouldn't you be sharing shopping tips with Lady Gaga right now?<eos> I left the party early.<eos> I'm just writing a song.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Oh. What's it about?
Suspect Zero was wearing a ring, and Frost had this one in his possession.<eos> It's a Q.E.D. - What?<eos> - A quantum entanglement device.<eos> My God.<eos> It exists.<eos> This is what we were discussing in our flash-forwards.<eos> English, gentlemen. English, please.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's start with the basics, all right?<eos> Theoretically, Frost and his pals ramped up our linear accelerator to such extreme energies that it sent shock waves through the consciousness field and jolted all of humanity's awareness to a different place in space-time... the flash-forward.
They'll use you in ways you can't imagine.<eos> You'll know things, but you won't be able to tell anyone.<eos> You'll be in constant danger.<eos> You'll betray your friends, and there may come a time when they ask you to do something which goes against everything you believe in and care about.<eos> And you're gonna have to do it to win their trust and stay on the inside.<eos> Do you think you're capable of doing what you have to do?<eos> So they have the ring. It's been on Mark's board since Utah.<eos> Well, you're gonna have to get it back.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> It's in a well-fortified vault in the basement of the FBI, for God sakes.
Do you want to get Shilo back or not?<eos> - Yes, I want to get Shilo back.<eos> - All right!<eos> Then do exactly as I say.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Wait wait wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> O captain, my captain.<eos> Does the red rabbit run faster than the gazelle?<eos> Indeed it does.
Jeff, where were you last night?<eos> - At a bar.<eos> - Called it!<eos> - Who can confirm that?<eos> - Your mama.<eos> - What?<eos> ! - Well, I'm--<eos> Uhh! What the hell, annie?<eos> Her name's not annie.<eos> It's psycho.
[JEREMY GASPS]<eos> You got a problem with blood, Anna?<eos> The coroner's office has officially ruled Vicki Donovan's death a drug overdose.<eos> - You don't think it was an overdose.<eos> Is there something you're not telling me?<eos> Take my wrist. You need blood.<eos> I have this hunger inside of me that I've never... I've never felt before in my entire life.<eos> I don't want you to see me like this. I don't want you to know that this side of me exists.<eos> Nice car.<eos> Well, it was a waste to leave it sitting in the garage.
I'm about to screech at my husband.<eos> You might want to stand back.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I have a better idea.<eos> There you are!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, Mr. Scavo.<eos> - How was the flight?<eos> - Horrible.<eos> It was delayed, there was turbulence, they ran out of food.
Because I stole his cell phone to see who he was talking to, and he called your house, like, 100 times.<eos> - Well, he hasn't been talking to me.<eos> - Really?<eos> Well, the next time he's not talking to you, you might want to give him the name of your divorce lawyer.<eos> I'm so glad you guys were free tonight.<eos> We've been wanting to do this for such a long...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - My earring!<eos> It's missing!
- Really?<eos> Well, the next time he's not talking to you, you might want to give him the name of your divorce lawyer.<eos> I'm so glad you guys were free tonight.<eos> We've been wanting to do this for such a long...<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - My earring!<eos> It's missing!<eos> Damn it, I just got them today!<eos> I'm sure it's somewhere.

We've had our problems.<eos> - Just neighbor stuff.<eos> Well, I tried to crush her son with his car.<eos> - One of her favorite stories.<eos> - And then she attacked me with a bat.<eos> She's Italian.<eos> That's love.<eos> Now, come on.<eos> You know, Angie once told me that a goodbye doesn't mean anything<eos> - if it doesn't last 10 minutes. - Really?
How could one tell?<eos> Who to believe?<eos> What track to follow?<eos> Rose is death, she said to herself.<eos> Rose is death.<eos> The Flower Girl Gang Theory<eos> Reserved for books out of use.<eos> The gang grew roses in the basements of the abandoned great library.<eos> Just a few drops of blood could poison the flowers, making their petals go black.<eos> When the smell of those roses spread through the streets it wrought havoc.
You still live in your tent? Sometimes.<eos> I'm used to it out there, you know? It's comfortable.<eos> So, Ray,<eos> I've decided from now on - I'm not gonna take my commission.<eos> - Thank you-- what?<eos> Since when are you in this business for free?<eos> Since my work stopped being respected.<eos> I'm not saying I'm gonna do it for free forever Just till you see that I'm a better pimp than Lenore.<eos> And if that day never comes?<eos> Oh, it'll come, Ray. I'm sure of that fact.
You're... Not.<eos> Your father was supposed to fix that step.<eos> Mom, you're obsessing over the tiniest little thing.<eos> So you do see it. Yeah.<eos> What is the big deal about this one picture?<eos> Honey, you know what?<eos> I don't expect you to understand. But all right.<eos> When you're a mom, everything goes by so quickly.<eos> In a minute, Luke's gonna be shaving, And Alex is gonna be off at college, And -- and you're gonna be You're gonna be doing something great.<eos> Just want to freeze this moment as it is right now.
Your Zillo Beast will be no match for them.<eos> Maybe true.<eos> But our way is already proven.<eos> Your way?<eos> Open the valve!<eos> (COMMANDING)<eos> (ZILLO BEAST ROARING)<eos> (CHEERING)<eos> Our fuel is deadly to the beast.<eos> It killed them in the past. It will kill this one now.
I've done everything you've asked me to do around here.<eos> I fixed the step, didn't I?<eos> Look how solid it is.<eos> I'm like Shirley Temple and that black guy.<eos> Bill "Bojangles" Robinson.<eos> Bill "Bojangles" Robinson!<eos> I said it first.<eos> So this is the problem.<eos> Uh, faucet just keeps leaking.<eos> Yeah, it's a cracked washer, if I know my washers. And it's, uh, been leaking a little water.
Oh, just double-checking these straps.<eos> This is an extra.<eos> These babies saved your life.<eos> That's why this cabinet barely moved.<eos> It fell all the way to the couch. Mm-mmm.<eos> - It almost killed me.<eos> - No, it didn't.<eos> This cabinet barely moved.<eos> That's just perspective playing tricks on your mind.<eos> Like, if I hold up my thumb, it looks bigger than your head. - No, it doesn't.

- Oh! It's Save-zilla.<eos> He's knocking down prices on everything from bibs to cribs.<eos> Half off on playpens.<eos> High chairs are low chairs.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me. - Cut. What's the problem?<eos> Don't you think this commercial just might be the teeniest bit racist?<eos> I mean, "Save-zilla"?<eos> It's not racist. It's satire.
Honey, do you need me to move the car?<eos> I'm alright oh no!<eos> iron cross<eos> Phil...<eos> You okay?<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> I am okay.<eos> Honey, why do we keep this car?<eos> It's a classic!
Honey, do you need me to move the car?<eos> I'm alright oh no!<eos> iron cross<eos> Phil...<eos> You okay?<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> I am okay.<eos> Honey, why do we keep this car?<eos> It's a classic!<eos> No, it just sits here.
Phil...<eos> You okay?<eos> Yes. I am.<eos> I am okay.<eos> Honey, why do we keep this car?<eos> It's a classic!<eos> No, it just sits here.<eos> And the seatbelts don't work.<eos> The doors stick.<eos> It leaks fluids.
I'm gloria pritchett from next door.<eos> Larry paulson.<eos> Yeah, I've seen you. Mm.<eos> Lucky guy.<eos> Wait a minute, then tell me.<eos> Your dog doesn't stop barking.<eos> All morning, all night.<eos> He wakes my son up, and he needs his sleep.<eos> It's not my dog.<eos> It's my soon-to-be ex-wife's.
You're like jimmy buffett tickets<eos> To these hybrid-driving, straight white folks.<eos> I hear that, girl.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Where the hell is the dog?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's our neighbor.<eos> The dog is gone.<eos> Maybe it ran away.
To these hybrid-driving, straight white folks.<eos> I hear that, girl.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm coming!<eos> Where the hell is the dog?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's our neighbor.<eos> The dog is gone.<eos> Maybe it ran away.<eos> It was chained to a tree.
Where the hell is the dog?<eos> Who is it?<eos> It's our neighbor.<eos> The dog is gone.<eos> Maybe it ran away.<eos> It was chained to a tree.<eos> Maybe your wife took it.<eos> According to my credit card, my wife is in europe, Searching for the world's most expensive hotel.<eos> Then what do you want from us?<eos> You come over complaining about the dog And the next day it's gone?
Get off of her.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> All right.<eos> Go, go, go.<eos> The hell's a Shifter want with a baby, anyway?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - And how the hell did it find us?<eos> Who designed this thing, NASA?<eos> It could have been following me this whole time.
I thought they were just freaks of nature, like, X-Men style.<eos> You learn something new every day, huh?<eos> I've never seen a baby monster before.<eos> Yeah. Of course, it's not really a monster.<eos> I mean, it's still just a baby.<eos> It's not its fault its dad's a Shifter.<eos> Right, but it's a Shifter too.<eos> Still doesn't change the fact that we've gotta... We gotta look after this thing.<eos> But what are we gonna do with it? We can't drop it off at an orphanage.<eos> They might get upset when it turns Asian.
Oh, because if you heard him, then you knew the Alpha was out there.<eos> - If you knew the Alpha was out there... then you knew he might come after the baby... in which case, you were using the baby as bait.<eos> So was that the plan...<eos> - to use the baby as bait?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> Dean, I just thought Samuel's was the safest place.<eos> Right. Of course.<eos> No, I didn't catch it.<eos> It killed three of my people.<eos> I shot it full of elephant tranquilizer and it chuckled.
I'm for that, but come on.<eos> -There's gotta be another way.<eos> -There is no other way.<eos> -You're gonna torture a kid.<eos> -I can't care about that, Dean.<eos> I don't have the luxury.<eos> [screaming]<eos> He'll rest now.<eos> Did you get a name?<eos> What is it?
Hey, have you seen Drag Me To Hell? - Trying to avoid it.<eos> - But it's fantastic.<eos> Saturday, 7:00, my house.<eos> I'll fix you dinner, and I'll whip up a batch of my white chocolate popcorn... and we'll watch it.<eos> Deal?<eos> That sounds super, Marcy, but, uh...<eos> Okay, no worries.<eos> Um, hey, one other thing.<eos> Uh, my woodchipper, it's a piece of crap, you know?<eos> It just broke down on me, and I hear that you're quite handy.
I don't know what that's gonna get me.<eos> All right, well, then behind Door Number 2, Bob.<eos> Crowley had a son.<eos> Did he, now?<eos> Name of Gavin.<eos> Moved across the pond after his parents bit it. Captained a trading ship that went down in Massachusetts in 1723.<eos> Cousteau wannabes found the wreck 30 years ago.<eos> They fish out his bones?<eos> No. No. They did find his signet ring, though.<eos> It's part of the Treasures from the Deep exhibit... at the maritime museum in Andover.
The whole family's just waiting for your next big breakdown.<eos> We're like hostages.<eos> Why don't you just go ahead and kill yourself already?<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> We tested him.<eos> Salt, silver, everything.<eos> He threw me to that vamp.<eos> I'm telling you, it's not my brother.<eos> Then, he's something we ain't seen before.<eos> Or it's freaking Lucifer.
Yes, he is, 'cause I'm gonna ask him to because you won't do it.<eos> Okay, just hold on a second.<eos> For what, huh?<eos> ! Look at me!<eos> - We can figure this out!<eos> - How? !<eos> Why aren't you freaked out?<eos> - Of course I am!<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause I can hear your heartbeat, and it's pretty damn steady.
- Whoa, is that the laser?<eos> It's bitchen.<eos> Yes.<eos> In 1917 when Albert Einstein established the theoretic foundation for the laser in his paper Zur Quantentheorie der Strahlung his fondest hope was that the resultant device be "bitchen. "<eos> Well, mission accomplished.<eos> Let me explain what we're doing here.<eos> In 1969, the astronauts on Apollo 11 positioned reflectors on the moon. We're gonna shoot a laser off one of them and let the light bounce back into this photomultiplier.<eos> Oh, that's very cool.<eos> One question:<eos> How can you be sure it won't blow up?
- That's a great question, Zack.<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> - Sheldon, play nice.<eos> - It's not a great question.<eos> How could somebody possibly think we're going to blow up the moon?<eos> That's a great question.<eos> Don't worry about the moon.<eos> We set our laser to stun.<eos> Smart.<eos> We'll see the beam when it leaves. It won't be strong enough when it comes back... - ... to be seen by the naked eye.
Look at you... Tap dancing on my porch where the neighbors can see.<eos> Hi, Mr. Heck.<eos> Just keeping my thighs hot while Sue grabs my colander.<eos> I have no idea what that means, but why don't you wait inside?<eos> (pants) Okay.<eos> Sue, Brad's in the living room.<eos> (Carly laughs) (Sue squeals) Okay!<eos> (grunts) What are you doing?<eos> Oh, nothin'. I was just lookin' for a button.<eos> Oh! There it is.
We're down to two front loaders, and that's just not-<eos> Congratulations,dad.<eos> Your plan's working, 'cause I can't wait to go back to school.<eos> If I had to work at that place every day, i'd pack a lunch box full of poison.<eos> If you had to work there every day, I might need to share.<eos> I'm serious. That place is lame.<eos> Hey.<eos> Watch it.<eos> That quarry is filled with hardworking people trying to provide for their families.<eos> It puts a roof over your head and clothes on your back.
Well, it's no picnic for me, either.<eos> Sometimes I just wanna - Aah!<eos> It's flooding the car!<eos> Give me that sheet of dinner rolls!<eos> Hey, Dad.<eos> Why do you still have the sleeping bag?<eos> They didn't want it.<eos> They don't realize how terrific this sleeping bag is.<eos> If they can't appreciate this sleeping bag... To hell with 'em.<eos> It's really not that great.
It's my girlfriend.<eos> Wow!<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Bob, that's great.<eos> Ohh. So is this someone you've actually...<eos> You know, met?<eos> Of course.<eos> She's a librarian at the public library.<eos> I would never have the strength to approach her if I hadn't been listening to this motivational podcast.<eos> It has given me the confidence to just deal with people differently.
Well, that's just terrifying.<eos> You know, you're eating butter, by the way.<eos> Well, it looks so funny, but at least it smells g... ow!<eos> My foot! Oh, it burned my foot.<eos> Oh, honey, this pie is gonna kill you.<eos> Here. Oh.<eos> For my foot?<eos> No, no. For dessert.<eos> Let's just go back to my old tradition.<eos> As long as you heat it up at home, it's homemade.
It's gonna work.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> Don't draw attention.<eos> Oh man.<eos> It's just a cloudburst.<eos> We get 'em all the time.<eos> It'll pass real quick.<eos> The smell's washing off.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> - Is it washing off?
I can't believe it.<eos> Don't draw attention.<eos> Oh man.<eos> It's just a cloudburst.<eos> We get 'em all the time.<eos> It'll pass real quick.<eos> The smell's washing off.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> - Is it washing off?<eos> - No, it's not.
Do you think we can manage that?<eos> Do you think we can manage that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What I did was not on a whim.<eos> Your brother does not work and play well with others.<eos> It's not Rick's fault.<eos> I had the key.<eos> - I dropped it.<eos> - You couldn't pick it up?<eos> Well, I dropped it in a drain.
You see anybody else here stepping up - to save your brother's cracker ass?<eos> - Why you?<eos> You wouldn't even begin to understand.<eos> - You don't speak my language.<eos> - That's four.<eos> It's not just four.<eos> You're putting every single one of us at risk.<eos> Just know that, Rick.<eos> Come on, you saw that walker. It was here.<eos> It was in camp.
If there's any... government left, any structure at all, they'd protect the C.D.C. at all costs, wouldn't they?<eos> - Shelter, protection...<eos> - Okay, Rick, you want those things, all right?<eos> I do too, okay?<eos> Now if they exist, they're at the army base. Fort Benning.<eos> - That's 100 miles in the opposite direction.<eos> - That is right.<eos> But it's away from the hot zone.<eos> Now listen to me.<eos> If that place is operational, it'll be heavily armed.
That's why, when she goes away to Europe next month, I'm gonna start my renovations.<eos> Mom's going to Europe?<eos> What, she didn't tell you?<eos> Yeah, she's going on a spa week in Switzerland.<eos> You know, at first she was actually hesitant to leave us here alone.<eos> But I promised her that we'd be fine.<eos> So it's just gonna be you and me alone, for a week.<eos> I can hardly wait.<eos> So, how was your day?<eos> Uh, it was fine.
Sorry.<eos> It was worse for his wife and kid.<eos> I take care of her now.<eos> Sorry, I didn't mean to bring us down.<eos> You were saying something about a woman you left behind? Oh, I didn't leave her behind;<eos> it was her decision to stay.<eos> Well, maybe you didn't really love her. No, I...<eos> I do love her.<eos> I do. So, is this the cave entrance?<eos> This is it.
That's a fact.<eos> I can't tell if you're joking.<eos> I hope you are.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hodgins and that Dr. Amazing?<eos> Uh, Angela means Science Dude.<eos> They ran an analysis on the contents of the victim's beard.<eos> The beard?<eos> Why the beard?<eos> It was full of stuff.
Oh. Given the angle of the jaw and the wear to the teeth, the victim is a male in his late 20s.<eos> Male, late 20s.<eos> Okay, what's that?<eos> It's a probe.<eos> These appear to be the only remains incased here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Where's the back of his skull?<eos> Whoa, okay. So, what you're saying is, there could be, you know, male parts all just embedded here in this big slab of concrete?<eos> There's the impression of the rest of the skull.<eos> When the concrete set, the bone was still there, but somehow it disappeared in the meantime.
What twirls and is good for hitting on the head?<eos> Very thin cardboard on asphalt?<eos> So he left ballet to become a spinning-on- his-head dancer.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Initial analysis of the powdered bone dust revealed traces of blastomyces dermatitidis.<eos> It's a fascinating fungus that quite literally eats bone.<eos> So that's what happened to the rest of his skeleton?<eos> A fungus ate it?<eos> Where'd the fungus come from?<eos> It must have been introduced to the bone before he died. Ouch.
You're fine.<eos> It's your skeleton that's falling apart.<eos> The compression fracture to your T3 alone should have incapacitated you years ago.<eos> Then, there's the fracture to your sternum from when that obese girl shot you.<eos> Fractures to your metatarsals from when you were tortured.<eos> Rib pitting from when you foolishly tried to act as a human shield. Rib pitting?<eos> And that's before we even get to your compromised ligaments, both intertransverse and interior longitudinal.<eos> How do you have room in your brain to remember all that?<eos> I care about you, Booth.<eos> And the more abuse a body takes, the sooner it degenerates. That's it?
Yeah, it is.<eos> Look, I don't just do the horny broad cruises.<eos> I do gourmet parties once a month.<eos> Your point is?<eos> Last week's dinner, there was a bunch of this, uh, you know, illegal Italian cheese.<eos> I took one of them. Oh.<eos> I see. No, I don't.<eos> What does Italian cheese have to do with maggots?<eos> There's a traditional Sardinian sheep milk cheese called casu marzu.<eos> It is riddled with live insect larvae.
Now, Molony, he's strong.<eos> We know that from the bone attachments.<eos> But Claire, she's got rage on her side.<eos> And I shove him overboard.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We thought this through.<eos> Molony-- he tries to climb back onboard, scraping himself on the barnacles.<eos> But Claire-- she grabs the boat hook.<eos> And stabs him with it, straight through the mouth. Uh-huh.<eos> The hook tore through his palate, into the frontal lobe, fracturing his front teeth as it was removed.
You are not really here.<eos> So what's the story, morning glory?<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> The victim.<eos> Does she remind you of anyone?<eos> Sweetie, when you describe people in generalities, like age and size, it fits a lot of people.<eos> Your dolphin ring.<eos> So what?<eos> It's not mine.<eos> It's the victim's.
Cause of death?<eos> Yes. Deep enough to suggest a fatal blow.<eos> Severe nightstick fracture to the left ulna, suggesting the victim raised her arms in a defensive posture.<eos> She was beaten to death.<eos> Fits the neighborhood.<eos> I removed this from the remains last night.<eos> I noted it in the evidence log, but I forgot to hand it over.<eos> It's not like you, to forget things.<eos> The ring is unlikely to be probative evidence in a murder charge.<eos> Well, it might help us with identification.
Chance those are, uh, magnesium scraps?<eos> Yeah, we use, uh, cast magnesium discs in the wheels.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just got a thing for magnesium, that's all.<eos> FBI Agent Booth.<eos> May I help you?<eos> Yeah. Are you missing a truck, Jesse?<eos> Well, we found a burnt truck registered to your company's name, with a dead body in the driver's seat, with a bullet in his chest.<eos> Was the truck hauling magnesium?<eos> And if it was?
Excuse me.<eos> I'm Detective Ryan.<eos> We'd like a word with Mr. McCardle.<eos> You can't have one.<eos> He just got out of heart surgery. What for?<eos> Congenital valve defect.<eos> Would that cause excessive sweating, by any chance?<eos> Among other more serious symptoms.<eos> He's been in dire need of surgery for over a year.<eos> So why get it now?
So, Clark, did you come here for a reason?<eos> Pressing story, maybe?<eos> Actual...<eos> Yeah, I'm on a really tight, uh, deadline.<eos> Whoops.<eos> Look at that? I dropped my pen.<eos> I'm just gonna look for it.<eos> [CHUCKLES]<eos> Normally, I wouldn't deal with these dust bunnies but it's kind of my favorite pen.<eos> Not seeing it.
Why are you still alive?<eos> He told me to give you a message.<eos> He said that you'd come save me and that when you did it was finally time for the two of you to face off.<eos> He's in Lawson's Field.<eos> What?<eos> [GRUNTING]<eos> "And would that I might endure his agony, as well as mine."<eos> The Scarlet Letter.<eos> Of course, the letter is a mark of shame.<eos> At least it was when I found Clark tied to that post 10 years ago.
I know now that I have it within me to kill.<eos> I failed.<eos> We're all confronted with trials, son.<eos> But the true measure of a man is how he chooses to react in the face of those trials.<eos> You never had that problem.<eos> Come on, son. I am so far away from perfect.<eos> I could never keep my own anger in check.<eos> I let it all build up inside me till it made my own heart give out.<eos> It was my fury, Clark, that drove me to wanna kill another man.<eos> But instead it killed me.
Lois, there's gotta be a part of you that knows that I'm telling the truth.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Clark Kent, and I promise, Lois, I will never let this happen to us.<eos> I can't live in a world where you don't love me.<eos> [WHOOSH]<eos> CLARK:<eos> Oliver.<eos> So Clark Luthor is the mysterious Ultraman of Metropolis.<eos> That name sucks, by the way.<eos> Did it look good on paper?
The secret stays with me.<eos> Okay, well, I guess I have to trust you.<eos> I don't know whats gotten into you lately.<eos> Three weeks ago you were a small-time radio host now the whole city's listening.<eos> I need you to take me further.<eos> I wanna be on every television, in every paper, on every computer screen.<eos> I want to touch every soul.<eos> The whole world?<eos> Exactly how do you propose to do that?<eos> If I can plant an idea, a seed of doubt within people it will grow until it devours their faith in each other and in these heroes.
Wait a minute.<eos> Oh, no. Kryptonite again.<eos> Look, I...<eos> Blue?<eos> Red?<eos> Not green.<eos> Please tell me it's not black, that was a disaster.<eos> Look, I just...<eos> I need the Legion ring.<eos> - Lois, do you know where it is?
Marge? Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> I don't trust that guy.<eos> I bet he killed everyone on that boat himself.<eos> That's crazy talk.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You've both been so kind to me, I baked you this pie.<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> Why do piemakers get all the girls?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> It was poisoned! No it wasn't!
I'll give you socks!<eos> Thanks, kid.<eos> Now you better head home.<eos> I'm sure in the 25 years of Earth time you've been gone, your parents have gotten worried.<eos> Kids never change.<eos> Always dumb as potatoes.<eos> Pull over!<eos> Hey kid, you ever wanted a train for Christmas?<eos> This one's yours.<eos> Why can't they leave a poor tree in the woods where it belongs?
What?<eos> You don't want a Christmas tree?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Next you won't want a Christmas ham.<eos> Don't worry about that.<eos> I love meat and I always will.<eos> That is some sweet pig meat.<eos> But as for Christmas trees, I used to love them, until last year...<eos> This tree reminds me of your father.<eos> It's round in the middle, thinning on top, and your hands get sticky when you touch it.
Comfortable, okay.<eos> I'm putting you and Tom on point.<eos> Let me know if there's anything you need.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kelly, I'm gonna need your help with this.<eos> Yeah, no problem.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey.<eos> How's your arm?<eos> It's healing up nicely.
You want to fight with someone, fight with me.<eos> I've got a few things I'd like to fight with you about.<eos> Ow!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> My arm's broken! I'm sorry.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I'm so s... I didn't think it would hurt.<eos> It's in a c... you didn't think my arm's broken?<eos> All right.<eos> It's in a cast! Because it...
Ow!<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> My arm's broken! I'm sorry.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I'm so s... I didn't think it would hurt.<eos> It's in a c... you didn't think my arm's broken?<eos> All right.<eos> It's in a cast! Because it...<eos> I didn't know!<eos> Because it's broken.
And Leela junior.<eos> And they'll have kids of their own.<eos> Yuck! Is that really what happened in the Bible?<eos> It's a sick and twisted book of holiness, all right.<eos> Then we'll write our own Bible.<eos> With less Sodom and more Gomorrah.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> I shall become the mother of a new world, trapped here, under this tree.<eos> The tree of knowledge.<eos> Look, it even has apples!
Thanks, Lily.<eos> That felt fantastic.<eos> To Ted Mosby...<eos> homeowner, friend, and if he can rent it out, slumlord.<eos> There's one last thing I've got to do.<eos> And my friends didn't see me for the next 72 hours.<eos> He was our ride.<eos> Ted, what are you doing here?<eos> I never got to give you your toast.<eos> I was selfish and I freaked out and I'm so sorry, so... here it is.
Perfect.<eos> A number of years ago<eos> We were close to acquiring something of great value something that once belonged to your former employer.<eos> What you want, is errand boys?<eos> No.<eos> Not at all.<eos> People that worked with former clients of his.<eos> Disgruntled former clients.<eos> We'd like to make sure we obtain this item before he does.<eos> We believe you know where it is.
5 minutes with Katherine Walters.<eos> Wish I could help you.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.<eos> So you think I know something about Katherine Walters' death?<eos> I'm quite certain of it.<eos> How's that?<eos> Because we're the people who hired you to kill her.<eos> So you hired the hit on Katherine.<eos> Who are you?<eos> The item we're looking for The last time anyone saw it Was the day Katherine Walters died.
Row 16 north stacks.<eos> On my way to the stacks now.<eos> Hurry.<eos> Row 16. I think it's just up ahead.<eos> Should be back to the boat in about 10.<eos> Be careful.<eos> We found the container.<eos> And what was in it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It was empty.
- You need me to meet you there?<eos> - I don't need anything but a haircut.<eos> - All right, I'll see you there.<eos> - I knew you still cared.<eos> - Later.<eos> Mrs. Ari:<eos> Thank you for coming with me. My baby wants me to look at a chandelier, then a chandelier I will look at.<eos> Even if it means driving 90 minutes into the deep part of the Valley.<eos> I know you couldn't care less, but this is spectacular.<eos> It's Murano glass and it was originally owned by Sophia Loren.
Deeks was her partner.<eos> I didn't envy him, either.<eos> She could be difficult.<eos> Four months they worked on this case.<eos> You know what they had at the end of four months?<eos> They had nothing. And nobody could figure out why.<eos> Did she tell you that when she briefed you?<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> This case was stone-cold dead yesterday morning.<eos> It wasn't going anywhere.
Sorry about that.<eos> Did that hurt?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bastard. Sebastian...<eos> Renner. And you have Mr. Renner's key?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And your name?<eos> In case anyone's interested, I'm not ready.<eos> My name?<eos> It needs to be on record.
No, no.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll, uh...<eos> Plan B. Okay.<eos> What's plan B?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> What, plan "B" is to put me out of my misery?<eos> They're laser triggers.<eos> If the collector is receiving light at the right frequency, it's not going to register the beam has been broken.
- Hetty's a re-gifter.<eos> - Hetty's a re-gifter. - Ha, ha.<eos> Oh, are you kidding me?<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> That is awesome.<eos> Scarf.<eos> Do you know this?<eos> My favorite color. What?<eos> I gave that to Hetty a year ago.<eos> - It would look better on me.
I like to think of it as Nell's "Secret Santa."<eos> A black mark.<eos> This is L.A.P.D.'s photos of the crime scene, same wall.<eos> No mark.<eos> Pull up the photo of the body positions.<eos> This is where Mancuso fell after he was shot.<eos> - Head height.<eos> - Coroner confirms his hair was dyed.<eos> - Which explains the mark.<eos> - But not what made it go away.
Is there a way you can stay on this?<eos> It's no longer our jurisdiction.<eos> I lost my wife.<eos> I can't lose my child. Please.<eos> I understand.<eos> But there's nothing... We'll see what we can do.<eos> You want to tell me what that was all about? Sam, talk to me.<eos> Why did you tell him that? Because that's what I'm going to do.<eos> I want to stay on the abduction case.<eos> It doesn't fall within our purview, Mr. Hanna.
I'm telling you, this is connected to those two.<eos> We show them that there's a glove that's been left behind.<eos> I don't know if it was them or a partner.<eos> Whoever did it's gonna get scared and go back and get it.<eos> And we stake out the park.<eos> It's a long shot.<eos> We're gonna need that video fast.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> You see that little sucker right there?<eos> It's a glove that got left in the dirt, and it is filled with DNA.
I don't need a chair.<eos> Sander Lee Design.<eos> This is it through here.<eos> How much did you give him?<eos> The usual.<eos> He must have had a reaction.<eos> Pulse is weak.<eos> Federal agents.<eos> Go quickly.<eos> He's got a pulse but it's thready.
Uh, this is my mom, Ella.<eos> Oh, Mr. Fitz.<eos> The new English teacher.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a pleasure to meet you, Mrs. Montgomery.<eos> Oh, please, call me Ella.<eos> We're a very informal family.<eos> Are you going to see the movie?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> It's one of my favorites.
Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, that's the only Latin I remember.<eos> Can I help with anything?<eos> What, with your extensive knowledge of the language?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know, I didn't grow up in a family like yours, so I don't know that kind of pressure, but I can imagine it could be unbearable at times.<eos> Well, you're not exactly a slouch, Mr. Oxford.<eos> I mean, that drive had to come from somewhere.<eos> Yeah. It came from me.
And now the kung pao chicken.<eos> Wow. Smooth.<eos> And finally, my moo shu pork.<eos> Whoo-hoo!<eos> Oh, there you have it, gentlemen.<eos> Our entire dinner unpacked by robot.<eos> And it only took 28 minutes.<eos> Impressive, but we must be cautious.<eos> Why? Today, it's a Chinese food retrieval robot.<eos> Tomorrow, it travels back in time and tries to kill Sarah Connor.
That's what I love about science-- there's no one right answer.<eos> So... you and Zack again, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, me and Zack again.<eos> Were we here earlier?<eos> Okay, we should, we should go. Ah, not yet.<eos> I want to talk science with the science dudes.<eos> Oh, and the science dudes want to talk science with you.<eos> What do you want to talk about-- rocks, dinosaurs, our friend the beaver?<eos> You know, I saw this great thing on the Discovery Channel.<eos> Turns out that if you kill a starfish, it'll just come back to life. Was the starfish wearing boxer shorts?
I did.<eos> Very well.<eos> Would you be interested in knowing that Mr. Wolowitz once snuck onto my World of Warcraft account and changed the name of a certain level-80 warlock from Sheldor to Smeldor?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> "Is there anything else?"<eos> Where would you like to start?<eos> He refuses to pay fines when he's overdue with books I lend him.<eos> He crashed the Mars Rover while attempting to impress a woman.<eos> He recommended that I go see the third Matrix movie because it was, and I quote, "just as good as the first one."
Oh. Sheldon, you can't fix this with gifts.<eos> Nevertheless, I've hurt you, and whether you forgive me or not, I want you to have this.<eos> You're giving me a couch cushion?<eos> No.<eos> The cushion is merely symbolic. I'm giving you my spot on the couch.<eos> But you love that spot.<eos> No.<eos> I love my mother. My feelings for my spot are much greater.<eos> It is the singular location in space around which revolves my entire universe.<eos> And now it's yours.
What is that?<eos> Raiders of the Lost Ark with 21 additional seconds.<eos> If I can't see it, no one else can see it.<eos> Sheldon, this is crazy.<eos> No. Crazy was leaving the projection booth unattended.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You are over-tired. You're not thinking right.<eos> Put the movie back before we get into trouble.<eos> Trouble is my middle name, Leonard.<eos> Actually, it's Lee, but I prefer Trouble.
Me?<eos> No, I'm one of the good Germans.<eos> He's joking.<eos> I met a very nice Jewish woman at the market, and she'd just came back from Israel, and she loved it.<eos> Yeah, the important thing is that Peter has supported Israel for a very long time, haven't you?<eos> And the gay agenda.<eos> What about the flotillas?<eos> What do you mean, the flotillas?<eos> Israel's unprovoked attack on the flotillas supplying aid to Gaza.<eos> It wasn't unprovoked.
Two dollars.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> The price of the filing.<eos> Lawyers.<eos> I don't get lawyers.<eos> They seem to always want to trick people.<eos> Tamara's a reporter.<eos> The Sporting News.<eos> We sit and wait for a bus.<eos> Here it comes.
Seriously, "Hedgehog"?<eos> The winner of the Nobel Peace Prize wants to play "Hedgehog"?<eos> It's a hotel room.<eos> He's away from home. It's an oasis from life.<eos> This is a man who spent two years in Butembo to see firsthand how women were treated.<eos> And he likes video games.<eos> Great men like video games.<eos> - You think she's lying? - There is a wealth of detail of her entering the room and the massage itself.<eos> But when she talks about the assault, it becomes variable.<eos> The massage table is by the door, then it's in the bedroom.
So which is it?<eos> That was Kalinda.<eos> She found lipstick on a champagne glass.<eos> You drank champagne?<eos> When I was in the bedroom, he shoved it at me and I thought if I just pretended to drink, he would be fine and let me go.<eos> - Was he holding you?<eos> - No. But he was in the doorway.<eos> You know, he was blocking it.<eos> And you said your massage table was in the living room and the bedroom.<eos> Do you remember which it was actually?
(whispers): You're the man.<eos> (whispers): I am the man.<eos> Ms. Scott-Carr.<eos> We should probably talk.<eos> About what, ma'am?<eos> Your ambitions.<eos> I need you.<eos> To beat Childs, I need you as my campaign manager.<eos> Maybe you haven't noticed, but I'm working for a campaign.<eos> Yes, and I probably should wait until it's officially over, but I need somebody now.
We got a lead on the clerk.<eos> We struck out on Frank Gephart.<eos> What do you know, Cary?<eos> Okay, first of all, I'm here for this, and nothing else.<eos> Understood.<eos> What can you tell us about your old friend, this clerk?<eos> Jason read a New Yorker article about the execution of Cameron Todd Willingham, and it moved him.<eos> He wrote a paper about flawed science in government cases, or something like that.<eos> Now, The Harvard Review never printed it.<eos> It's probably sitting in a drawer somewhere.
Mr. Tsutsui...<eos> He's not breathing!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Drink this.<eos> Get a grip.<eos> No, don't drink it!<eos> Shamoto, shut the hell up!<eos> Where's the ambulance?<eos> It's so late, it's strange!<eos> It'll be here any minute.
Where's the ambulance?<eos> It's so late, it's strange!<eos> It'll be here any minute.<eos> I can't even hear the siren.<eos> Did you really call?<eos> It's taking too long!<eos> What have you done?<eos> You've done something!<eos> I'll call them.<eos> It'll be here soon!
None of them?<eos> Well, you know.<eos> Sit down, sit down, come on.<eos> But "The fall guy" remake could be awesome!<eos> We get Minka Kelly for the Heather Thomas part...<eos> It's not gonna happen.<eos> Jesus.<eos> So now what?<eos> Well, you got eight weeks left on your deal.<eos> We have to find something before it runs out.
Many here are very excited to see the gifts you have to present yet there are others who reasonably wish to observe certain protocol.<eos> You understand, of course.<eos> May I ask what camp you're in, Mr. Chima?<eos> I'm sure the Secretary General remains objective.<eos> Thank you for your understanding.<eos> REPORTER 2:<eos> REPORTER 3:<eos> You must have known there would be opposition.<eos> I welcome opposition.<eos> It can only strengthen one's agenda.
Oh, she's good.<eos> Thanks for asking. You know, why don't we, uh, do this out in public?<eos> So, either of you guys know a<eos> Tony Bianco?<eos> Part-time golf pro. Well, he was missing for most of the week, but he turned up today without a face in a lifeguard station.<eos> Right near where your truck got towed.<eos> Wow, that's, uh, that's a coincidence.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, the dog had to pee, so we had to pull over somewhere.<eos> Then why was the pooch in the truck when it got towed?
Come on.<eos> I mean, the moment they ask what I did this summer, it's all gonna fall apart.<eos> Saying that I... I was on house arrest for a hit-and-run doesn't exactly scream "qualified candidate."<eos> Well, your records are sealed.<eos> They don't need to know.<eos> Look, give yourself a break.<eos> You paid your dues.<eos> Now you deserve a chance.<eos> So, you'll write that recommendation letter?<eos> It's already written.
There's nothing different about me.<eos> I'm just the same as I was before.<eos> Before what?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> Let's go upstairs.<eos> And tell your guys they can come, too.<eos> 7:59.<eos> Made it home under the wire.<eos> Whoa.<eos> This place looks like it was hit with an earthquake.
I'm supposed to go and help Harper open a file I sent her.<eos> She's gonna be lost.<eos> Oh, by all means, give her a call.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I could, but, um, it's really complicated, so I should probably be there to show her, you know.<eos> You want to leave?<eos> No, I don't want to, but you know Harper.<eos> I mean, she's kind of psycho.<eos> But, um, I'm really bummed 'cause I am loving your movie.<eos> It's... It's really awesome.
Walter?<eos> Walter!<eos> Walter.<eos> Walter, look at me.<eos> Hey, Walter?<eos> Walter!<eos> Hey.<eos> Son?<eos> The stegosaurus, Peter.<eos> It has two brains.
Walter, I know that you're angry right now, and I get it.<eos> I cannot make heads or tails of this code. It's immense.<eos> It's not even just one code.<eos> The... the numbers are a code.<eos> The time between the numbers is a code.<eos> Yes, sir?<eos> Okay, I will make sure that he gets it.<eos> That was Agent broyles.<eos> There was another radio tower break-in.<eos> It was unmanned, so nobody was hurt, But they found another cube...
Call me if you find anything.<eos> My dad says I need to forget about what happened.<eos> Yeah?<eos> But it's hard to forget, isn't it?<eos> You know, I can imagine what it must have been like for you... How scared you must have been, how much you... you would have wanted to get back to your family and to your friends.<eos> - I have nightmares about it sometimes.<eos> Really?<eos> Could you tell me about them?<eos> I always remember the smell first.<eos> It's musty, like our attic.
- Jenny Humphrey was just...<eos> - Don't say her name!<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - You're safe.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What's your name?<eos> - Henry.<eos> Henry prince.<eos> You had the dream again.<eos> I hoped it wouldn't follow us from Prague.
How long can that last? Exactly.<eos> So you just keep your focus on not getting raped or killed.<eos> It's a minimum security prison.<eos> And you are hot.<eos> Even white collar criminals get lonely.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We'll get it done.<eos> I promise.<eos> Better watch out, kids.<eos> Trouble's moving in, and it's looking to make the Upper East Side its bitch.
I'm sorry.<eos> There's no one named Sharp in this building... or Juliet for that matter, at least not in the eight years I've worked here.<eos> Good morning, Upper East Siders.<eos> This is your wake-up call.<eos> Serena.<eos> What are you doing on campus so early?<eos> Watching you climb out of a brownstone vestibule with Chuck following like the Bass that ate the canary.<eos> And no denials.<eos> Your skirt's on backwards.<eos> No, it isn't.
- Wait. Why?<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't explain.<eos> All of you need to get home now.<eos> Please.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> LOCKWOOD:<eos> Here.<eos> Take my car.<eos> It's out back.
And he really wants to meet you.<eos> The youngest Gilbert.<eos> This is an intriguing surprise.<eos> - I'm here for the moonstone. - Yeah, yeah, the moonstone.<eos> It's very popular today.<eos> Just give it to me.<eos> Naive little Gilbert.<eos> If you want it, you're gonna have to come here and get it.<eos> I kind of figured you'd say that.<eos> Come on, where is it?
- So it protects me from compulsion?<eos> - Vervain is toxic to vampires.<eos> You mean, like, poison?<eos> Yeah. It's very poisonous.<eos> It'll keep them out of your head.<eos> But why vervain?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's certain natural herbs and roots and other elements that are harmful to vampires.<eos> - Like a stake through the heart?<eos> - Right, but it has to be wood.
You're not gonna trigger the curse.<eos> Your dad didn't know about this. Neither did I until it happened.<eos> - How does it get triggered?<eos> - Ignorance is bliss, trust me.<eos> You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret and expect me not to ask questions?<eos> I can't say anything more.<eos> Sorry, Tyler.<eos> It's just better for you if I don't.<eos> You ever find that moonstone?<eos> Do you know where it is?
- Ignorance is bliss, trust me.<eos> You blow back into town with some supernatural family secret and expect me not to ask questions?<eos> I can't say anything more.<eos> Sorry, Tyler.<eos> It's just better for you if I don't.<eos> You ever find that moonstone?<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> - What's so special about it?<eos> - I told you.<eos> It was my mom's. It's sentimental.
Yeah.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> What did George get in return for giving you your freedom?<eos> [SCOFFS]<eos> Something he wanted desperately.<eos> So you sent 26 of your friends to their death just to fake your own?<eos> No, you were running from something.<eos> What was it?<eos> Everyone has a past, Stefan.<eos> Mine needed to stay far, far away. But thanks to you, my plan nearly failed before it even began.
I really think that I got to her.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Because let's not forget. I already killed you once.<eos> I can easily do it again.<eos> - How's that barbecue? - Not great.<eos> - You still pissed?<eos> - You still keeping secrets?<eos> - Then I'm still pissed.<eos> Hey, you know, I was thinking about that stone you're looking for.<eos> I might know a couple places it could be.
On every full moon, I lose control.<eos> If I don't sedate myself and chain myself down I'll kill anything in my path.<eos> You have to be careful.<eos> All it takes is an accident, a car wreck.<eos> Any death at your hands and you'll have a lifetime of this.<eos> You don't want it, Tyler, trust me.<eos> All right, where's the moonstone?<eos> Deal's a deal. I answered your questions.<eos> Um...<eos> Yeah, I'm not sure, but I'm guessing it's in here.
My dad, he was very kooky about his hiding spots but I've figured most of them out over the years.<eos> [TYLER SIGHS]<eos> It's all yours.<eos> You gonna tell me what's so important about this rock?<eos> I told you, it's just something I want.<eos> Sentimental value.<eos> TYLER:<eos> Yeah, I'm not really buying that.<eos> - Why do you really want it?<eos> - Do you know where it is or not?
[TYLER SIGHS]<eos> It's all yours.<eos> You gonna tell me what's so important about this rock?<eos> I told you, it's just something I want.<eos> Sentimental value.<eos> TYLER:<eos> Yeah, I'm not really buying that.<eos> - Why do you really want it?<eos> - Do you know where it is or not?<eos> No, I figured it'd be in here, man.
[KNOCKING ON DOOR]<eos> - I need to talk to you.<eos> - And when I need to talk to you...<eos> Tyler has to kill someone to activate his curse.<eos> He's not a werewolf yet.<eos> Wow, fascinating. Not enough.<eos> But Mason Lockwood is, and he's looking for a moonstone a special rock connected to the werewolf legend.<eos> That's why he's here.<eos> A moonstone?<eos> - And I know where it is.
- Hey, I want a shot.<eos> - Me too.<eos> And then we have to dance.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You know, usually, it's me corrupting you.<eos> I like this.<eos> Okay. Let's go party.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Thought this room could work.<eos> - It's perfect.
But why me?<eos> Because you're a Petrova doppelganger.<eos> - You're the key to breaking the curse.<eos> - Curse?<eos> - The Sun and the Moon curse?<eos> - You do know your history.<eos> What do you mean, I'm the key?<eos> The moonstone is what breaks the curse. No.<eos> The moonstone is what binds the curse.<eos> - Sacrifice is what breaks it.
So granted.<eos> [ROSE MOANS]<eos> - You...<eos> - Don't, Rose.<eos> Now that you're free.<eos> [CRIES]<eos> - Come.<eos> - No, what about the moonstone?<eos> What do you know about the moonstone?<eos> I know that you need it. And I know where it is.
- Don't, Rose.<eos> Now that you're free.<eos> [CRIES]<eos> - Come.<eos> - No, what about the moonstone?<eos> What do you know about the moonstone?<eos> I know that you need it. And I know where it is.<eos> - Yes?<eos> - I can help you get it.<eos> - Tell me where it is.
What -- what are you doing?<eos> I don't care if you burn me or electrocute me or whatever it is you're thinking!<eos> Relax, Nick.<eos> I just want to borrow your toaster.<eos> Floor safes are virtually impenetrable as long as they're in the floor.<eos> If you don't have a jackhammer to pry one out, you need to get creative.<eos> Homemade shape charges will do the trick, but if you want to avoid turning a standoff into a full-scale breach, you'd better have a way to muffle the blast.<eos> Hey, Mikey.<eos> Our buddy Nick has some top-of-the-line clubs... Titanium.<eos> Once a floor safe is out of the floor, it offers about as much protection as a piggy bank.
Maybe Lisa can help ease her fears.<eos> Explain the Live Aboard to her.<eos> Tell her how wonderful it is to live on a ship.<eos> I'll stop by later.<eos> [PHONE rings]<eos> Yeah.<eos> Joshua contacted us from the mother ship.<eos> The V's sent some kind of soldier after Ryan and Val.<eos> -What kind of soldier?<eos> -I don't know, but it sounds bad.
I opened my best bottle of wine for you<eos> Last night, and you left a sip.<eos> I would never.<eos> This is your lipstick.<eos> wino fight.<eos> That was my glass.<eos> I accidentally wore colored lip balm yesterday.<eos> It's barely colored, and it makes my eyes pop.
Which one do you want him to go to?<eos> It doesn't really matter what I want.<eos> It's his choice. The weather is so good in california.<eos> Yeah, it also has earthquakes and, uh, race riots,<eos> So, you know, everybody just calm down.<eos> And there it is. travis, help! I'm hurt!<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I'm not falling for that again.<eos> I'm serious this time.<eos> I've twisted my ankle. It might be broken.
Yeah, but you're dumb enough to bring a porn star.<eos> I told you.<eos> Stan Lee totally knew who you were.<eos> I know.<eos> I saw the moment when he placed me... he turned beet red.<eos> - All right, so what did he say?<eos> - They'd like you for the movie, but they've seen a lot of fuck-ups in this town and they're concerned, Vince.<eos> E, the truth is I had a Vicodin this morning, which I wouldn't have had if I knew I'd be drinking.<eos> - Why'd you take a Vicodin?<eos> - My back... it's been hurting since the accident.
- The NFL peeps are calling.<eos> - I'll call 'em from the road.<eos> Is Howard Stern really gonna host "Jeopardy"?<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I'm gonna go see Lizzie.<eos> I think I found a chink in her armor.<eos> I don't think you should talk to her, Ari.<eos> I think that you know what I think about your thoughts, Babs.<eos> Love the delivery truck, Turtle.<eos> - It gets the job done.
Yeah well, now you got the studio insecure.<eos> No, I talked to Dana.<eos> She's fine.<eos> - I spoke to her also.<eos> - And?<eos> She is fine.<eos> But Randall quit.<eos> Come on.<eos> Well, he's a fucking asshole for telling them that.<eos> Look, E, I will deliver on this movie and it will be great.
But you must have a comms room.<eos> Even the Volos must want to communicate somewhere.<eos> Sure. Through here.<eos> Flooded.<eos> What?<eos> During the rescue, we took on water.<eos> From where?<eos> Everywhere, from here to bridge - everything, everybody.<eos> Is the nuclear core safe?<eos> It should be, but there were problems with corrosion of outer shell.
Beastslayer 949 is Alec Mosca.<eos> He lives 15 miles away.<eos> Cho and Rigsby are on their way.<eos> Splendid.<eos> Did Noah have any other hiding places? Maybe.<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I feel like I don't know anything anymore.<eos> I mean, how many secrets did he keep?<eos> Why put all this junk in a safe? Well, it's not all junk.
Security car disabled.<eos> Copy that.Okay.We're good to go.<eos> If you're cutting through a high-powered electric fence, You need more than rubber gloves And a pair of thick-soled shoes.<eos> Covering a fence with spray-on insulation And using a set of fiberglass-handled bolt cutters Will keep you from lighting up like a Christmas tree.<eos> Hold on there, Chuck.<eos> All right, you're clear.<eos> A shape charge large enough to go through a wall Is also large enough to let everyone for several miles<eos> Know what you're doing. A smaller charge can be just as useful And a lot less noisy.<eos> A hydraulic spreader puts out enough pressure To rip a door off a humvee.<eos> Placed correctly, it will make short work Of reinforced concrete.
She might be right. Mike.<eos> Where there's smoke...<eos> Jacob?<eos> ! Water!<eos> Please don't leave me here!<eos> Shut up, all right?<eos> ! I'm coming!<eos> There's your water.<eos> Happy? Alcohol was used as an energy source and a weapon long before anyone had any idea what gunpowder was.<eos> It doesn't contain enough energy to qualify as a top-grade explosive, but in most situations, it's a lot easier to find a bottle of vodka than a brick of C-4.
Wait...what?<eos> The temple finished vaporizing her.<eos> This is mom's energon pod.<eos> And that's her vapor in those little bubbles.<eos> I'm sure that thing was free, right?<eos> Energon doesn't grow on trees, Jeff.<eos> It's harvested by super bees in a buddhist meteor crater.<eos> Which is at the foot of mount sky mall In the sharper image valley?<eos> Sorry, I overslept.<eos> The sidewalk is more comfortable than it looks.
All right, it's not on the floor,<eos> - so whoever accidentally took...<eos> - Not accidentally!<eos> Accidents don't just happen over and over and over again, okay?<eos> This isn't budget daycare.<eos> Okay, whoever insidiously and with great malice aforethought abducted Annie's pen, confess, repent, and relinquish so we can leave.<eos> Maybe nobody took it.<eos> Sometimes I think I lost something really important to me, and it turns out I already ate it.<eos> I didn't eat my pen, Troy.<eos> I know I brought it, and now it's gone.
We all know what we're really thinking.<eos> If... and I mean if... the culprit is among us, statistically speaking, it's Troy.<eos> Yes, we were all just thinking that in 1856.<eos> 1856.<eos> What if a ghost took the pen?<eos> - Please forgive him. - For what?<eos> For stealing the pen, dummy.<eos> Why would I take her pen?<eos> I don't even like having my own.<eos> It's probably under one of Pierce's casts.
And I hope whoever stole that pen enjoys it in hell!<eos> - Nice try, Stephen Fry. - "Stephen Fry."<eos> We all have an agreement.<eos> Nobody leaves till we find it.<eos> - Get off.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We are gonna find this pen!<eos> We are gonna find that pen! - Oh!<eos> - And if we can't find it, our children will find it!<eos> Is it over here in these books? This pen?
Can we just forget it?<eos> It's a pen!<eos> It's a pen now?<eos> Really?<eos> It's not a principle anymore now it's a pen?<eos> Why the change of heart?<eos> You're not seriously accusing me.<eos> We searched my bag!<eos> Which is exactly the last place you'd put it if you found it halfway through all this.<eos> In fact, assuming that one of us does have the pen, who among us has the most incentive to make sure it never sees the light of day? - You want to go there?
I mean, sure, Marshall and I like to pretend, but the reality is scary.<eos> Why don't you say something to him?<eos> What's the point?<eos> He's from Minnesota.<eos> His high school mascot was a hug.<eos> - Hey, guys.<eos> - Hey, how'd the date with Royce go?<eos> It was interesting.<eos> We went to see that new movie, The Wedding Bride. Oh!<eos> How was it?
How was it?<eos> Not that I care.<eos> I mean, it's a chick flick.<eos> This one will probably drag me to it, like the 7:10 show tomorrow night, or 9:40 because I have that meeting, but I can probably get out of it, so let's try for the 7:10.<eos> - What's that movie about, anyway?<eos> - That's the interesting part.<eos> Hey, bonehead! I'm Jed Mosley.<eos> I'm the most powerful and corrupt architect in New York. I...<eos> That's gonna leave a mark!<eos> It's about me.
This one will probably drag me to it, like the 7:10 show tomorrow night, or 9:40 because I have that meeting, but I can probably get out of it, so let's try for the 7:10.<eos> - What's that movie about, anyway?<eos> - That's the interesting part.<eos> Hey, bonehead! I'm Jed Mosley.<eos> I'm the most powerful and corrupt architect in New York. I...<eos> That's gonna leave a mark!<eos> It's about me.<eos> - The Wedding Bride is about you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, are you sure it's about you?
I'm the most powerful and corrupt architect in New York. I...<eos> That's gonna leave a mark!<eos> It's about me.<eos> - The Wedding Bride is about you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, are you sure it's about you?<eos> Because when I saw Spaceballs<eos> - for the first time, I could've sworn...<eos> - This movie is about me, Marshall.<eos> - It was written by Tony Grafanello.
I'm crying.<eos> I know it's all fake, but didn't those seem like real characters?<eos> It was just so real.<eos> Hey, how come you said "oh, no" when the movie started?<eos> That's when I realized everyone has baggage, including me.<eos> Oh, uh, no reason.<eos> Ted, I think you need to tell Royce the story of what happened with you and Stella.<eos> It's gonna come out eventually. Why?<eos> Why does it even have to?<eos> Well, for starters, it's now the fifth highest-grossing movie of all time.
I know.<eos> I was just so upset that...<eos> How do you know that's his catchphrase? - You said it was his catchphrase.<eos> - They dragged me to it.<eos> I didn't wanna go.<eos> - I wanted to see A vatar again.<eos> - All right, that's it. I'm just gonna move to some country where no one's seen The Wedding Bride.<eos> Good luck, Ted.<eos> That movie is worldwide.<eos> It's huge.
But even when I'm away from here, I'm always thinking about the company, you know?<eos> I am always thinking.<eos> For example?<eos> Well, you know, this morning when I was driving to work, I had this idea.<eos> Okay, now, it might be a terrible idea, but I was thinking about how...<eos> You know how kids are always losing their shoes?<eos> Well, they are.<eos> It's a universal thing.<eos> I was thinking about a kid shoe with a clicker.<eos> Kid loses his shoe, you push the clicker, it beeps, you find it, whether it's, you know, under the bed, it's in the closet, in the garage.
No, we don't need that. Hey, come on.<eos> I know what I'm doing here.<eos> Shut it off!<eos> Shut it off, Joel!<eos> Come on, man!<eos> Great idea.<eos> Damn it!<eos> Come on!<eos> All we got is good pressure!<eos> Where is it?
Whatevs.<eos> Once, while you were asleep, I kissed you on the forehead 'cause I wanted you to have nice dreams.<eos> I was awake. Oh, els like the game should be over.<eos> Come on!<eos> Don't you guys want to get inside each other?<eos> That's what she said.<eos> Oh ho ho! Bing-bing-bing-bing- bing-bing-bing!<eos> So lame.<eos> Why won't that joke ever go away?<eos> We should steal it from them so they know how annoying it is.
Get it away from the wnd.<eos> Push anoth .3 of etomidate.<eos> That's what I'm doing.<eos> Up the sux infusion. (man) there.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> Were you falling asleep?<eos> Back off.<eos> The guy's a drunk.<eos> He's going through the anesthesia<eos> Like it's iced tea. So then...
What?<eos> - Come back tomorrow.<eos> And bring your id.<eos> Josch!<eos> Don't do anything stupid!<eos> I'll call the police!<eos> - I don't care!<eos> Give me my dog.<eos> - I can't do that.<eos> I don't even know if it belongs to you!
René.<eos> There are thousands of Renés.<eos> What does he look like?<eos> - He wears a baggy jacket, jeans, sneakers.<eos> Blond hair, he's about twenty.<eos> - Where can I find him? Nobody's getting through.<eos> Go around the outside...<eos> Take your time, take your time.<eos> Can you ask the young lady about my coffee?<eos> Where is it? When will it get here?
Dannic, listen to me.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> If you had listened to me from the beginning, We wouldn't be in this position.<eos> Take his weapon.<eos> There can only be one commander, And Kiva's dead.<eos> Any objections?<eos> What do we know about the planet?<eos> Not much.<eos> Presumably, it has breathable atmosphere, Other than that...
Nothing you can say would do that.<eos> I already got a foot bath.<eos> Ship's pretty much sailed on that one. I broke a commandment.<eos> Oh!<eos> Okay... Which one?<eos> I stole something.<eos> I stole an inspirational fridge magnet.<eos> A what?<eos> A magnet, for the fridge, to hold papers and stuff.<eos> I just loved it so much, and dad wouldn't buy it for me, And now I just feel terrible, And I never thought I would be the kind of person
The almond crop is our fastest growing, most profitable export crop here in California.<eos> Every February, just around Valentine's Day, has become the single greatest pollination event in the world.<eos> Bees from the entire country, as far away as New England and Wisconsin and Minnesota and Florida get on trucks in the middle of the winter and three quarters of all bees in America come to California to perform this absolutely critical act,<eos> where they have to be woken up, strengthened with high fructose corn syrup.<eos> I mean if there's anything more viscerally offensive, it's the idea of feeding the creators of honey high fructose corn syrup.<eos> When we feed the corn syrup we hope that there's enough natural<eos> nectar and honey on the hive to supplement whatever feed they get out of the syrup.<eos> In Europe and America they are using a thing called oxytetracycline or tetramycine in the sugar.<eos> The bees consume the sugar and then transfer it up in the honey.<eos> Now, you eat that honey. You eat that honey. It's got oxytetracycline or tetramycine in it.
Two or three years ago there were not enough bees in America to pollinate the whole crop so the USDA gave permission to import bees from Australia.<eos> Now, as it happened, Australian bees harbor certain viruses that are unfamiliar to American bees.<eos> Israeli Acute Paralysis Virus is one of those.<eos> We brought that in to pollinate the almonds. That's where all the bees of America mixed.<eos> We've created this great Bee Bordello as one beekeeper put it.<eos> We constantly intermix from all over the country, so if they've got something in one part of the country like tracheal mite and we don't have it in our part of the country, we certainly will have it<eos> because the migratory nature of beekeeping spreads all these pests at a very rapid rate!<eos> We don't have a single event that causes the bees to go way downhill. It's a little bit here and a little bit there.<eos> These semi-load trips I believe cause huge stress on them.<eos> Once the hive starts getting stressed to a certain point then it can no longer cope with many of these other things and that extra stress is just enough to put it over the edge.
This is the first issue.<eos> In Europe bees are completely dependent on human care and on human help.<eos> Without this care many, many bee colonies will die and only very few will survive without the help of the beekeepers and all human beings.<eos> In former times the coal miners had special birds in the coalmines and when the canary birds stopped singing and stayed silent it was time for the coal miners to leave the mountain.<eos> What most people think of when they think of a pollinator is they think of the honeybee and the honey bee is by far the most important agricultural pollinator we have. But what a lot of people don't realize is no. 1 - we have about 4,000 species of other bees.<eos> Everything from large bumblebees, thousands of species of bees that are everything from little bees, they look like flies, to bright green-- florescent almost green to striped in different colors.<eos> Bees of all varieties across the world.<eos> Beyond bees, flies and beetles are very, very important pollinators.<eos> The beauty of the seed is out of one you can get millions.<eos> The beauty of the pollinator is it turns that one into the million and that's an economics of sharing.
Yeah, the Tauron thing was a mistake.<eos> Helping our people is more important than money.<eos> The older generation, they don't always get that.<eos> He's a stubborn old nothos. I know.<eos> But we can make it right.<eos> Send some cash and robots back home, everybody cools off.<eos> Unless, of course, you decide to make a bad situation worse.<eos> Times are tough.<eos> A war would destroy this family.<eos> It would destroy your father. Undoubtedly.
To lead us into Paradise is a privilege.<eos> It's a privilege that I'm having to deny myself because God has chosen a different path for me.<eos> I'm gonna use a regular Holoband and I'll be there to greet you when you arrive.<eos> Go with God.<eos> I will.<eos> Proudly.<eos> And He will be my light.<eos> God is powerful, Clarice.<eos> His light shines on everything.<eos> It shines on you.
To homecoming?<eos> Uh... I didn't think that was your scene.<eos> I have a scene?<eos> I didn't think listening to the Smiths alone in my room was a scene.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I think what you mean is that you don't want to go with me.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> It's just...<eos> I would've thought you think homecoming was lame.<eos> It is pretty lame, but...
You know what I mean.<eos> I think what you mean is that you don't want to go with me.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> It's just...<eos> I would've thought you think homecoming was lame.<eos> It is pretty lame, but...<eos> You're not.<eos> Okay.<eos> So... I'll pick you up at 9:00.<eos> Sure... but it starts at 8:00.
They're rotating his unit out of Afghanistan.<eos> My dad's coming home.<eos> God, Jenna the jerk is looking at us.<eos> It's a very second-string crowd she's with.<eos> Why doesn't she just take her "D"-list gang and go home instead of sitting here and creeping me out?<eos> - Jenna's here. Where's Toby?<eos> - Out in the woods, sacrificing squirrels.<eos> Don't you ever get tired of shooting at the low-hanging fruit?<eos> Don't ruin a perfect day, Spencer.<eos> It is perfect.
Yeah, I found that out before I went to Spencer's last night.<eos> I didn't see you this morning, so I thought it'd be kind of weird to text you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That would've been weird.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Still, I'd rather hear it from you than from him.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> We've both moved on.<eos> Try the broccoli.<eos> It's delicious.
He was a good person.<eos> May the Lord have mercy on him.<eos> Amen.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello.<eos> Come in.<eos> Make room for Bekzat.<eos> Please accept my condolences.<eos> Be strong.<eos> Death is what it is.
You're not the first.<eos> I'll just say one thing.<eos> Listen carefully.<eos> Pepito.<eos> Pepito!<eos> Fetch the ball!<eos> Pepito!<eos> The fucking ball!<eos> This dog must have a trauma.<eos> Like my aunt's dog, it thinks it's a rabbit.
- Right.<eos> - Why not apologize over the phone?<eos> You're so unromantic!<eos> She's due at 8:00, but she's always 10 minutes early.<eos> OK.<eos> OK.<eos> - Yes?<eos> Babi, supper's getting cold.<eos> Mom's looking all over for a ring her mother gave her.<eos> It's been missing since your friends were here.
And I put a lot of work into this one.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> Now I got to tell Lily the fifth doppelganger is a fake.<eos> So? What does she care?<eos> Lily decided that once we spotted your doppelganger, we'd start trying to have kids.<eos> Kids?<eos> !<eos> The rule is: no kids until you're at least 45!<eos> Do you ever read my blog?<eos> ! It's gotten a lot better.
And yet, the first thing you did was turn the autopilot system back on.<eos> Until I can be sure I know how to use each function, I wouldn't want to stop accidentally in range of another binary pulsar, would I?<eos> Good plan.<eos> You see, right now, I'm trying to understand why Destiny stops at some planets and not others.<eos> Maybe they're just rest stops, designed to let people get out, stretch their legs, smell the roses,<eos> But in the grand scheme of Destiny's greater mission...<eos> Not very important.<eos> Certainly environments can change significantly through the years, become dangerous, even.<eos> But that would mean Destiny's got some kind of real-time subspace link to the gates, and look here, this planet we're approaching, different classification entirely...<eos> Not merely locked out, but it seems to be non-functional.
She won't be asking to come by every week.<eos> Anyway... I owe you one.<eos> You owe wray. She's the one who made it happen.<eos> [rush, over radio]: Colonel young, come in.<eos> Yeah, go ahead.<eos> I think I have a solution to chloe's condition.<eos> Well, let's hear it.<eos> The neural interface.<eos> The chair?<eos> I believe it can cure her.
Welcome home, son.<eos> Stargate Universe 2x05 Cloverdale Original Air Date on October 26, 2010<eos> Okay, he's out again.<eos> Guys, we can move him.<eos> You'll be able to help him once we're back on the ship, right?<eos> We can't risk taking him aboard. It's too dangerous.<eos> What?<eos> Rush is right.<eos> You saw how quickly the organism spreads on contact.<eos> It could take over the whole ship.
President Clinton will be back out on the campaign trail next week -<eos> I've got... requests for you from CNN, CNBC...<eos> Jerry Springer, Geraldo Rivera and Montel Williams.<eos> The London Times and Le Monde are sending in to interview you... and Sixty Minutes and Dateline both want you, but only if you don't do the other one.<eos> And I just got the call last night... the National Press Association Journalist of the Year... is Mr. Gary Webb.<eos> Congratulations. Gary.<eos> On, baby!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Life's beautiful.<eos> It's checking out Richard.
You see a simple servant,<eos> That's all.<eos> A worm anyone can tread on.<eos> That's what I needed to hear.<eos> But this servant, this worm implores you, Do not--<eos> Ah- -do not seek explanations,<eos> For all that's in this firmament Is revealed to you-- It's a miracle.<eos> Let others say that you live in darkness,<eos> I say to seek to know all of God's work as heresy,<eos> So let go of the false light of knowledge. It does not serve our God.
Here, take this.<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> She's trying to kill me!<eos> Hold the witch!<eos> She's the spawn of Satan!<eos> Nastusya, my love-- Nastusya!<eos> Holy Father, It wasn't Nastusya, I sweat it wasn't!<eos> I saw it with my own eyes, standing there,<eos> I saw the monster with seven horns!<eos> It wasn't her.
I killed her!<eos> It'd be best if I just disappear.<eos> Petrus, what are you talking about, "disappear"?<eos> Khoma Brut disappeared, you're disappeared. I don't understand!<eos> Gone in a second,<eos> Without even a trace!<eos> No, no, no. Where's the body?<eos> Where's the grave, huh?<eos> There isn't.<eos> There isn't. It doesn't exist! Listen to me, stop.
I was sure Nastusya would think I was the one who attacked Pannochka.<eos> In gratitude for saving her, She fed that monster for over a year,<eos> And I've been praying for Pannochka's soul ever since.<eos> Only the first three nights were terrible.<eos> When the third night was over, I was paralyzed from fear, From what I had endured in the church.<eos> It was then at daybreak That he came.<eos> I've heard enough about Viy. No.<eos> He's more terrifying.<eos> Who?<eos> Who was it?
New product's afraid.<eos> 2.3 seconds behind.<eos> Great.<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> He has a gun!<eos> Drop your gun!<eos> Drop your gun!<eos> Drop the weapon.<eos> Let the kid go!<eos> Oh, well, it's worried that the kid's gonna get hurt.
Rumor has it he is in the building preparing to come out...<eos> Alex, we're gonna upload the entire DPD database into your brain.<eos> That means you'll have instantaneous access to criminal records plus an archive of CCTV footage from 2011 to the present.<eos> All right.<eos> Hit me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Kim, it's all yours.<eos> Archive footage uploading successfully.<eos> Your system draws connections automatically.<eos> It will link perpetrators to their crimes and give you their exact locations whenever available.
I don't know what you're doing tearing down that mountain, God knows where, and for what?<eos> Why can't you ever do anything sensible?<eos> I'm doing quite well, thank you.<eos> - Will there be anything else?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> That woman you're slavering over is practically an aborigine, you know.<eos> Raised on a timber camp.<eos> A timber camp?<eos> Yes, I thought you'd like that.<eos> Unfortunately, it burned down and killed her whole family.
You send every ship that we have to the northern coast of Euboea.<eos> I will go and seek the help of the great Spartans.<eos> [CROWD murmuring]<eos> ARTEMISlA: Still no word from the messenger you sent to Sparta.<eos> King Leonidas may have been insulted by your generous offer.<eos> Perhaps I need to march into Sparta myself and burn it to the ground.<eos> Remember when a king is loved as I am much can be accomplished.<eos> They would be fools to resist my divine power.<eos> Athens is attempting to assemble a coalition.<eos> It'll be nothing more than a patchwork of ships.
Well, actually, maybe at them, but this whole damn thing.<eos> Why me?<eos> Why the fuck me?<eos> - I didn't do anything wrong!<eos> - Ev, you still have time left.<eos> Make the most of it.<eos> Why waste it looking for someone who may not even exist?<eos> He does exist.<eos> There is a window here.<eos> It won't be open long, and then it will close and Banir will have gotten away with it.
Fuck. 24.<eos> 17.<eos> 10.<eos> Three.<eos> Are you... you warm enough?<eos> I asked you to tell me if you were going out.<eos> I got anxious, kept walking.<eos> But the thing was I... I-I... I couldn't remember the name of the hotel.<eos> You left your wallet.<eos> It's just three blocks over.
I see you sniffing around the newsroom for the big stories.<eos> But it's also okay to just give people something a little lighter.<eos> A little...<eos> Little froth.<eos> - Froth?<eos> - You know, how, when you get a coffee, it's just, like, coffee, then they put a little froth on it. It's kind of nice.<eos> Vern, that's foam.<eos> Yes, foam, froth, you get the point.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's nice, it tastes good, it's candy.
Well, they don't look like turtles because they are turtles.<eos> They're over six feet tall and they speak English.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I was awake all night, please look, I was awake all night googling all of the thwarted crimes over the past three months, and this symbol appeared at every single one.<eos> Look!<eos> Every single one of them.<eos> This one, look.<eos> Here, here, here, here, here.<eos> And it's an ancient Japanese symbol that means "family."<eos> Wait, it's on my laptop.
Not unlike the Foot Clan and what they'd like to do to our city.<eos> Then one day, a hero arose.<eos> A great alchemist discovered the antidote to the warlord's poison.<eos> The cure-all for his evil.<eos> Your father and I were trying to recreate that cure-all.<eos> We developed a mutagen capable of stimulating self-repair on a cellular level.<eos> What were you going to do with it?<eos> Imagine New York City, being victim to a chemical attack.<eos> This mutagen would be able to reverse its effects.<eos> It would save the city, it would save the people.
Want some of this?<eos> I'm like a ghost!<eos> I'm over here, now I'm over here, bra.<eos> Like a shadow!<eos> I'm a flame shadow fire dragon!<eos> Their gift was also their passion.<eos> They lived, breathed and dreamed all things martial arts.<eos> Then, they were ready.<eos> The katana, most noble of all the blades.<eos> It is the weapon of a leader.
And that is where my company comes in.<eos> I'm going to save everyone with the antidote that is made from the mutagen that is oozing through your blood.<eos> The government will then send Sacks Industry a blank check and I'm going to be rich.<eos> Like, stupid rich.<eos> Shredder will force this city to live under our rule.<eos> We will be gods.<eos> Yeah, I've thought about...<eos> I've thought about doing, not becoming a ninja, but I was doing a bunch of yoga for like, 10 days at one point, and I pulled a hamstring.<eos> - There's the gate right there.<eos> - There it is.
On his short list was also dog crap, car alarms... indecipherable parking signs, double baby strollers... ass-crack fashion, men's cologne... bubble gum, bicycles, hamsters... garbage trucks, neighbors, metal hangers, TV remotes... greeting cards, flip-flops, fliers for cheap haircuts, fat people... pigeons, The Weather Channel, smell of urine, new mothers... credit card offers, blocked phone numbers... big umbrellas, F train, J.F.K., B.Q.E....<eos> A.T.M. service fees, 99 Cent Stores, radio personalities... networking, Starbucks, the Knicks... the Knicks, the Knicks... and God.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I ask you, what the hell?<eos> That was a red light you ran!<eos> Can't you tell red from green?<eos> You took the test, right, when you got your driver's license?<eos> Remember that? Multiple choice, number two pencil, dirty walls?<eos> And what does red mean? Does it mean "go"?<eos> Does it mean slam into my car, is that what it means?
Better than the normal Mia.<eos> You know, with the hair and the makeup and the clothing.<eos> Mia, I don't give a shit about your clothes.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> The you you are now is the same you I was in love with yesterday.<eos> The same you I'll be in love with tomorrow.<eos> Can we go somewhere?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is this place?<eos> It's an old boatworks shed.
Just think of it like we're playing music together.<eos> Adam, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> All right, well, take your jacket off.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> So we have four strings.<eos> We have the C string and G,<eos> D and A.<eos> And if I were to play glissando, it'd feel like this.
Where you'll be auditioning for Juilliard.<eos> That's the ceiling.<eos> I put it up there.<eos> It's intense.<eos> I figured, you know, if you look at it every night it wouldn't seem so scary when you get there.<eos> What do you want, Adam?<eos> Mia, I'm sorry.<eos> - I know, I suck.<eos> - No, no.<eos> You can't just disappear from my life like that and pop back into it whenever you feel like it.
We're playing together.<eos> I really hate you all.<eos> All right, Mia.<eos> Gotta play for us, Mia.<eos> I've always thought of the cello as a solo instrument.<eos> It's probably why it's always made me so comfortable.<eos> Just me and my cello.<eos> But that night, sitting around the bonfire, jamming with Adam and everyone else, I realized I was wrong.<eos> The cello isn't a solo instrument.<eos> It's part of something bigger.
I need your help.<eos> Babe, it's me. Can you give me...<eos> Where's my money?<eos> Where's my money?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Me and my brother's money.<eos> Are you an idiot, you fucking cunt?<eos> And he died getting it.<eos> So, you can understand me wanting it back.<eos> Now, where is it?
Please.<eos> Where's the money?<eos> So, that's how you want to play.<eos> It's fine with me.<eos> I didn't want to go this far.<eos> Please...<eos> Please, stop.<eos> Please.<eos> Where's my money? Please.<eos> Where's is it?
You know, they're coming, Sam.<eos> Whether you want to believe it or not.<eos> In case you forgot, let me remind you, we're the FBI.<eos> We don't investigate tourists who overstay their visas.<eos> You assume whoever comes here is a saint.<eos> Remember the Irish?<eos> They put every convicted criminal they had on a boat to Ellis Island.<eos> There's guys in Flushing right now, illegal aliens, and they're building empires.<eos> And just like the Jews and the Irish or the Italians before them, you and everybody else doesn't think that there's an immigration problem.<eos> And there is, and it's about to become a crime problem.
That wasn't calling for backup.<eos> That was a high-pitched scream, and you pushed my sister in the way.<eos> I pushed your sister out of harm's way.<eos> You shined the light at us.<eos> It's different strokes for different folks.<eos> Put the ice pack in his mouth.<eos> No, on his head.<eos> Don't put the ice pack on my head, babe.<eos> I'm sensitive to extreme measures of cold and you know that.<eos> Put it on your head, because you just got knocked out by yourself.
- Shoot the gun.<eos> - Okay.<eos> All right.<eos> Ready?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Damn it!<eos> I pinched it.<eos> I pinched the inside of my hand.<eos> I don't think the sight on the gun is quite calibrated.<eos> The way I was shooting, it looks a little...
Denzel, Training Day.<eos> You might want to step back a little bit.<eos> This thing got a little kick to it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Freeze!<eos> You better stop before I put a hole in your back!<eos> Oh, you think it's a game?<eos> Oh, it's on now!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> Got a little bit of kick to it.
And only at the hands of godless creatures that have no souls.<eos> You do not want those.<eos> They are blunt and crude, and far too heavy to wield.<eos> Adam, you have strength and speed and stamina far beyond that of any human.<eos> Take sides in a war that you are already a part of.<eos> I do not care how many demons it descended.<eos> You should've let me destroy it.<eos> I am not blind to the risks.<eos> The fact is, Adam is alive, and all life is sacred.<eos> - It is not human born.
I returned to the place I had left so long ago.<eos> The human world had changed in the time I had been gone.<eos> But some things had not changed.<eos> If the demons could find me in the wilderness, it was only a matter of time before they found me here.<eos> Which is why I had to find them first.<eos> Naberius, where is he?<eos> Police!<eos> Put down your weapon!<eos> Good evening, Mr. Wessex.<eos> Where does life begin and where does it end?
Your actions led directly to his death.<eos> I'll be more careful next time.<eos> There will not be a next time.<eos> You will remain here until the Queen decides what to do with you.<eos> You cannot keep me here, Leonore.<eos> I can hardly risk unleashing you on the streets of this city.<eos> My life is my own.<eos> You will not take it from me.<eos> Your life was not granted to you by the grace of God!<eos> It was fabricated in a laboratory!
Electric eels, that's where he got his power from.<eos> You know, it's actually a fish...<eos> Six electric eels generating 500 volts each.<eos> That's 3,000 volts. That's enough to kill an elephant.<eos> How long did he hold the current for?<eos> Three bursts of five seconds each.<eos> That's 15,000 joules.<eos> Makes you wonder how long that thing lasted.<eos> Think of it, all that energy coursing through its veins powering its heart, lungs, nervous system.<eos> Well, if it survived that at birth, what would it take to kill it?
Sit down, please.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Please, it's all right, you can sit down.<eos> We can't stay here long.<eos> Okay, hold still, please.<eos> Demons will be looking for us everywhere.<eos> We have to get to Leonore, the Gargoyle Queen.<eos> She's the only one who can help us now.<eos> You saw that thing.<eos> You saw what it was.
Hi, buddy!<eos> I'm your friendly neighborhood police officer!<eos> -Would you like a glass of water?<eos> -Yeah. Yeah, actually.<eos> Too bad.<eos> Security cameras picked up this.<eos> Unh!<eos> You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece.<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> Then why is it permanently stuck to your back?
Security cameras picked up this.<eos> Unh!<eos> You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece.<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> Then why is it permanently stuck to your back?<eos> [YELLS]<eos> Get it off me!<eos> Get it off me!<eos> Aah!<eos> It won't come off!
Unh!<eos> You were found at the construction site convulsing with a strange piece.<eos> That's disgusting!<eos> Then why is it permanently stuck to your back?<eos> [YELLS]<eos> Get it off me!<eos> Get it off me!<eos> Aah!<eos> It won't come off!<eos> It's chasing me!
I can't make any sense of it.<eos> Taco Tuesday.<eos> I knew that was suspicious.<eos> There's no time to lose.<eos> We must find Vitruvius and get to the Office Tower before it's too late.<eos> Okay.<eos> Heh.<eos> How scary can someone's office be?<eos> [THUNDER CRASHES AND WOLF HOWLS]<eos> President Business, we're trying to locate the fugitive but his face is so generic it matches every other face in our database.
The box for this one said ages 8 to 14.<eos> That's a suggestion.<eos> They have to put that on there.<eos> FINN:<eos> You can't expect me to be able to resist playing with all this.<eos> You have your stuff over near the Christmas decorations.<eos> All those bricks, you can build anything you want.<eos> [SIGHS]<eos> Finn, we're gonna play a little game.<eos> It's called:
Enough!<eos> Do something!<eos> They're just frogs.<eos> Back away, back away.<eos> Unclean. No, no, no.<eos> Don't drink.<eos> Unclean.<eos> The Nile, as we know, carries a certain amount of clay.<eos> This year there's much more of it than usual... drifting in on the currents, settling on the riverbeds... and kicked up by the wild thrashing of the crocodiles.<eos> This thrashing not only... dramatically changed the color of the water, but it fouled it... to the point of killing the fish.
For the children, for us. My love.<eos> GOD WITH US!<eos> Stop, this is finished.<eos> Leave.<eos> (2%, fig t)<eos> My days draw to an end, my son.<eos> - No, father!<eos> - They do... child.<eos> That is the nature of life.<eos> All that is left for me is to ensure my Kingdom receives the leader it deserves. Which is why I have chosen you to sucseed me.
You mind?<eos> Hold them.<eos> No! Stop it.<eos> Give it back to me!<eos> - The seal is mine!<eos> - Cut these throats.<eos> No<eos> NC)<eos> The sword... is mine.<eos> It belongs to me.
- Yeah.<eos> What brings you to town other than scaring the shit out of me at a bookstore?<eos> Yeah, that was my sole purpose.<eos> No, I...<eos> There's a writer's retreat.<eos> You know, I'm writing this one-man show.<eos> Well, it doesn't surprise me at all.<eos> You were always a great writer.<eos> Οh, well, I had a... I had a good teacher.<eos> It's a little cove off the Pawai Bay on the Kona Coast, off the Big Island.
- I have a meeting.<eos> You have a meeting?<eos> With who?<eos> With Kevin Clancy from high school.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cool.<eos> Can I come?<eos> No.<eos> I think he wanted to make it kind of like a one-on-one kind of meeting.
It's not because I don't care or because I don't respect you or because I don't love you.<eos> It's because I'm a big pussy.<eos> That's it.<eos> I'm just a huge, pathetic pussy.<eos> I could never be you.<eos> You can crash on the couch, if you want.<eos> Did you, by chance, read my script?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And?<eos> It's great.
Thus did the young thief who had hoped to steal a jewel... Maleficent! ...steal something far more precious.<eos> After all these weeks, look who came back.<eos> I thought it worth the risk.<eos> So, what do you do for fun?<eos> Stefan and Maleficent became the most unlikely of friends.<eos> And for a time it seemed as if, in them at least, the old hatred between men and fairies had been forgotten.<eos> As it will, friendship slowly turned into something else.<eos> And on her 16th birthday, Stefan gave Maleficent a gift.<eos> He told her it was true love's kiss.<eos> But it was not to be.
It'll be fun.<eos> So you'll think about it?<eos> Doug wanted to open the door and talk to Ethan, but what could he say?<eos> I mean, I know a thing or two about working out.<eos> And there's absolutely nothing fun about weekend bike rides at all.<eos> Come on, honey!<eos> Let's take this hill!<eos> Fucking misery.<eos> Soon after Ethan was born, Kara discovered road cycling was perfect for shedding baby weight, and Doug was on board.<eos> He saw cycling as a chance for them to do something as a young family, and for a moment, it was fun.
That would kill him stone cold.<eos> - I was joking.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> I know.<eos> - That was a joke.<eos> I know.<eos> I know, baby. I was joking, too.<eos> It's just, you know, his heart is a problem.<eos> You know, it has been for years, and you know, those...
Well, these are both fairly aggressive stool softeners.<eos> Either one should do the job.<eos> Thanks a lot.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you Douglas Varney?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And you're the owner of this establishment?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then how come it's called "Bishop's"?
Do I know you?<eos> Jack Roberts.<eos> I just moved in a few months back.<eos> I live over on Donneybrook.<eos> - I'm Doug Varney.<eos> Yeah. Good to meet you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - That big place on the cul-de-sac, right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, it's too big if you ask me, but that's what my wife wanted.
- Absolutely.<eos> Let me put it this way.<eos> First class.<eos> Business class.<eos> Economy.<eos> You.<eos> Bring it.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> If you look at this plane, you'll notice it's quite old.<eos> That means it's never crashed before.
You and Aggie, you seemed so solid, what happened with that?<eos> Uh...<eos> Hey, Agnes and I always knew you'd wind up here when the dust settled.<eos> Yup, all this. This was my calling, wasn't it?<eos> Well, the dust, as you put it never really settled.<eos> There's been progress, though, right?<eos> I mean, foreign aid.<eos> Every time I blink there's another fundraiser.<eos> There's a big difference between being here and being here to be photographed being here.<eos> The money doesn't always make it to where it's needed most.

And the Omega has the ability to control time.<eos> Whenever an Alpha is killed an automatic response is triggered.<eos> The Omega starts the day over again.<eos> But you see, this time, it can remember what' going to happen just like you do.<eos> It knows exactly what we're gonna do before we're gonna do it.<eos> - An enemy that knows the future can't lose. - It can't lose.<eos> But if that' true, how did you win at Verdun?<eos> We were allowed to win.<eos> This thing wants us to believe we can win.<eos> It wants us to throw everything we have into the invasion.
You'll start to see that.<eos> You'll even see where it is.<eos> And you had these visions?<eos> Yes.<eos> But eventually you saw it. I mean, you actually saw it.<eos> Right?<eos> Never in the flesh.<eos> So this is all just some theory.<eos> You don't know if this thing even exists.<eos> The visions showed me it was at Verdun.
Must be a thousand mimics between us and the pyramid.<eos> What we gonna do? Walk up to the front door?<eos> - lf we stay here, we die.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> We'll never get through.<eos> We could.<eos> In that.<eos> That ship will never fly.<eos> Doesn't need to fly.<eos> It just needs to get us across there with speed.
Oh.<eos> Wow.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> OK.<eos> - Where is it?<eos> - What?<eos> - The thing.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Seriously, Greg, where is it?
I'm on my way out!<eos> - No, wait, you've got to help me, - (ELEVATOR DINGS) there's been an accident!<eos> Christ, what?<eos> No, no, no, sorry, no, that's what I meant.<eos> Everything's fine. Jesus, you scared me!<eos> I mean, there was an accident, um, with the thingy with Greg, you know?<eos> - Well, that happens, Rosie!<eos> - No, no, Alex. Something that I need to figure out right now, Alex.<eos> I need to get rid of it.<eos> It got lost and I can't find it and I don't know what to do.
Can we just talk about this later?<eos> ROSIE: No, Alex, please!<eos> OK, you need to be really clear and really precise!<eos> OK!<eos> The condom came off inside my vagina and at present I'm unable to locate it!<eos> That's way more information than I needed.<eos> Hi. I'm Dick.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> OK.<eos> Is it, um, front bottom or back?
You are our first guest.<eos> Have we met before?<eos> The condom came off inside my vagina and at present I'm unable to locate it!<eos> (ELEVATOR DINGS)<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Ruby, would you please see our guest upstairs to his room?<eos> Of course.<eos> And free champagne!<eos> All right, follow me and then...<eos> Yeah, a brand new bed, and... It's massive and you get to see the sea.

So, the doctors call the shots?<eos> Yes, and they've brought their own army along for the ride.<eos> I think you've already made their acquaintance.<eos> What's the status?<eos> 28 knots.<eos> Northeast wind has sprung up.<eos> We'll soon head into a low pressure system.<eos> Alright.<eos> Minimum speed ahead.<eos> With luck, it'll pass by us.
I see her.<eos> She's going to the dining room.<eos> Go.Go!<eos> She's in the corridor to the dining room.<eos> Hurry!<eos> √Ångela, no.<eos> Over here.<eos> It's me, Nick.<eos> Pick up the radio.<eos> Now take it already.

Why?<eos> I wanted to know what was in there.<eos> When I met you, you came straight from the lab, right?<eos> You released the monkey.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> And why would I have done that?<eos> You saved me from the building.<eos> We were alone for almost a minute.<eos> If this thing was inside of me ...<eos> It leaves its host when it finds a better one.
Ransom.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Dieffenbachstreet, Dieffenbachstreet.<eos> Dieffenbachstreet, Dieffenbachstreet, right or left?<eos> Left or right, right, left.<eos> Right or left or right?<eos> Right, left, right, left.<eos> The red cloth?<eos> The red cloth?<eos> There it is.
Your stupid colleagues are dealing with the crime scene taken not very accurate everywhere in the living room are bloodstains.<eos> But nothing on the carpet, which was probably replaced.<eos> Spring cleaning, my ass!<eos> Someone is trying to cover up something.<eos> You really should eat and prefer to make your work less Donuts!<eos> Here, the carpet was also replaced.<eos> The tracks lead from the bedroom.<eos> The first bloodstains are located opposite the bedroom door, Mills.<eos> Perhaps the blood of the old lady.<eos> Anyway, if so, it comes from the bathroom.
I have some research.<eos> According to legend, heal wounds by werewolves faster than normal people.<eos> What if she was bitten before they killed him?<eos> Then, the wound would have really very quickly transformed into a scar.<eos> And one more thing: werewolves have heightened senses.<eos> The little one is almost crazy when I rang.<eos> Evidence that they, too, is a werewolf.<eos> Or that I am well on the way to the nuthouse.<eos> The laboratory is looking straight into the cross found.<eos> Is it made of silver, amplifies the the evidence yet.
You idiot're not one of us!<eos> Although I have bitten you.<eos> It is inherited from the mother.<eos> But my wounds heal quickly.<eos> - This is the blood.<eos> I've already been drinking blood, it never had that effect.<eos> Did not my mother or my grandmother.<eos> We are special.<eos> Our blood heals wounds.<eos> And it's addictive, is not it?
So, Becky, I'm having a birthday party tomorrow night.<eos> It was only gonna be guys, but I can...<eos> Oh, thanks, but I'm going to Philip Parker's party tomorrow night.<eos> I think everyone is.<eos> He has a frozen yogurt machine and a trampoline.<eos> So do we!<eos> We have a frozen yogurt machine and a trampoline.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> - Well, yeah... My lab book!<eos> Put it out!
I need drugs.<eos> Real drugs.<eos> The nurse will only give me baby aspirin.<eos> What happened to Trevor?<eos> Emily, we're not gonna pump you full of medicine.<eos> You're not a cyclist. I'm not asking for steroids. I need cough syrup, something.<eos> Wait, Dad! How was your interview?<eos> It was not a good fit.<eos> But, you know? We'll see what happens.<eos> It was fine.
I'll be able to still do carpool and see the kids all the time.<eos> Wow, I am so happy for you.<eos> What about you?<eos> What about your call? How did it go?<eos> Dick Van Dyke's reading went viral.<eos> 500,000 hits today.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Nina says the book is gonna be huge.<eos> That is fantastic, sweetie!<eos> Yeah... it's great!
- Around?<eos> How about letting your mother know you weren't coming home?<eos> - Oh, Mum, relax!<eos> - Do you know what time it is?<eos> You out there, alone in the dark.<eos> It's always dark for me!<eos> There's no need for all this fuss!<eos> - Leo, why didn't you answer your phone?<eos> - Sorry, Mum.<eos> It was in my backpack!
Family and work.<eos> And what's left, Frankie?<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Not now.<eos> Why?<eos> So we can have a drink?<eos> Go around one more time?<eos> I'm sorry, sweetheart.<eos> I gotta get off the merry-go-round.<eos> It's no fun anymore.
It was the fucking money.<eos> Amen.<eos> 'Cause some of us are getting paid, and the rest of us are just getting dead.<eos> Oh, bullshit!<eos> Keep your hands where we can see them.<eos> This has been fun, but I'm out of here.<eos> I see any of your fucking faces and I'll kill you!<eos> Ammo's cheap.<eos> My life ain't!<eos> It's over.
You deserve each other!<eos> I warned you.<eos> We fucked up.<eos> We fucked up, didn't we?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Can we talk?<eos> We stole the money.<eos> It was Breacher's idea.<eos> We thought it would make him happy.<eos> It was $10 million in cash.
Drop the weapon, Lizzy!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Breach.<eos> You killed my team.<eos> Why, Lizzy?<eos> Why?<eos> Because they stole my money!<eos> They fucking robbed me! After everything I put up with!<eos> It was my money and they took it, and I couldn't find it!
Hey, Breach.<eos> You killed my team.<eos> Why, Lizzy?<eos> Why?<eos> Because they stole my money!<eos> They fucking robbed me! After everything I put up with!<eos> It was my money and they took it, and I couldn't find it!<eos> I said, "Fuck them."<eos> I took the money.<eos> I took it.
Freedom has been under attack in every generation and our generation is no different.<eos> Who better to ask about the subject of freedom than you, John?<eos> You've been hailed as God's ambassador by the world's foremost dictatorships,<eos> Sudan, North Korea and Iran.<eos> But there are those who claim that your ministry is intolerant, that it's condescending to people of other faith.
I didn't hurt anybody.<eos> I know you didn't, John.<eos> Come with me.<eos> The victim is 16-year-old Mellita Evans, a runaway, who was tragically found dead early this morning.<eos> The suspect in the alleged rape and murder of the young girl:<eos> John Luther, renowned evangelist and CEO...<eos> Did I do this to myself?<eos> It was just a matter of time, John.<eos> You're just a pawn in a much bigger game.<eos> It's about a powerful political movement based upon deceit.
Thanks.<eos> I want to state for the record that I find the very origins of this meeting extremely distasteful.<eos> We should first hear the situation from John's perspective.<eos> Look.<eos> Let's just cut to the chase.<eos> We all hope he didn't do this.<eos> I for one believe the best.<eos> But we have to take into consideration not just our interests but the needs of the millions of people that have supported this ministry for years.<eos> We have a shared responsibility and, unfortunately, John Luther is the reason that we're having this meeting right now.<eos> Now, I believe he probably didn't do it.
I believe in happy endings.<eos> And it's the only thing that's ever made sense to me.
May I call you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, thanks for making my play better.<eos> So long, Josh.<eos> That Loretta girl gave a fair reading...<eos> Isabella gave a brilliant one.<eos> You have to make a decision today.<eos> Yeah. I don't understand what the problem is.<eos> It's not a problem.
Come on, Seth.<eos> You know we were both too far down other roads for us to get serious.<eos> You were.<eos> I would've switched direction in a second.<eos> I know. You've switched a bunch of since then.<eos> -It was different with you.<eos> -Come on... I'm still ready, del.<eos> This is it, Mr. Gilbert.<eos> -What are you promoting this time? -My new cologne.<eos> Don't tell me what it's called.
If it had been up to the Baronet, she'd still be at home in his loving embrace.<eos> In fact, not a week goes by that I don't receive a letter from him threatening me and demanding I declare her cured so she might be remanded into his custody.<eos> So, you refuse?<eos> For her own safety.<eos> Come, Doctor.<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> We have much to see before dinner.<eos> May I just say that your playing is sublime.<eos> Your playing is sublime.<eos> It's quite sublime.
So, in order to make weight, I put heavy objects in my pockets to make me heavier.<eos> Pacquiao, very impressive young fighter.<eos> At the beginning, he had no finesse.<eos> He threw punches from way out, from the left and from the right.<eos> He'd just go... He'd just go forward, attacking without any rhyme or reason, or style, or finesse.<eos> Pacquiao with a good combination.<eos> A little bit of trouble there.<eos> And look at Manny Pacquiao trying to psych out Armando Rocil.<eos> But in any case, Manny had a passion for boxing.<eos> He saw it as a way of improving the quality of life for his family.
Everybody's in a ceasefire.<eos> That's how it is when Manny fights.<eos> It's bigger than boxing.<eos> It's bigger than being a prize fighter.<eos> His journey now is about fighting and winning for a people.<eos> Every time he goes out there, he's winning for them.<eos> Huge burden, but he accepts it.<eos> Most of these people here, they were so ashamed of who we were as a race.<eos> Manny Pacquiao helped us to reclaim our true identity.<eos> The issue is not Margarito's eye at this moment, it's his brain.
You can have so many things going on in your life.<eos> But when your relationship is affected...<eos> We can't go without Jinkee.<eos> You're not there.<eos> Manny who is used to having such the same routine...<eos> Jinkee gets down on the week before the fight.<eos> Her not being there in the hotel room with him, not being in the same bed with him...<eos> That's Manny's Kryptonite.<eos> Most people look at boxing as a physical competition.<eos> But it's mostly a mental battle.
I'm the real estate agent handling the...<eos> Listen to me, whatever you do... don'ttouchthatcostume.<eos> Stay away from it!<eos> Are you still at the house?<eos> I'll be over... as soon as I can.<eos> But don't touch the costume, please!<eos> I'm wearing it.<eos> Hello?<eos> That's uh... That's fine.<eos> Uh... Be careful! It's old, and fragile.

Karlsson<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> I just wanna talk to you.<eos> I don't know what happened between you and my husband, but I just want him back.<eos> "Where is he?"<eos> I don't know. He, uh...<eos> The police are looking for him.<eos> "Only I can help"<eos> Because this suit..<eos> It does things to people doesn't it?
He's the Keeper of the Runners.<eos> Every morning, when those doors open, they run the maze... mapping it, memorizing it, trying to find a way out.<eos> How long have they been looking?<eos> Three years.<eos> And they haven't found anything?<eos> It's a lot easier said than done.<eos> Listen.<eos> Hear that?<eos> It's the maze, changing.<eos> It changes every night.
The cops said they'd drop charges if we put you in the scene which they already knew you were.<eos> - I'm, like, so sorry, Larry.<eos> - Call me Doc.<eos> It's cool, Jade.<eos> - That copper?<eos> - Mm, Bigfoot?<eos> He's a warped sheet of plastic.<eos> So was it Bigfoot who put me on the Buenos Noches Express or did he subcontract it?<eos> I missed all that, man.<eos> Last thing I remember was eating Bambi's pussy and Puck Beaverton's tattoo, like, it was pulsating.
- Bye now.<eos> I wish you could see these waves.<eos> It's one more of these places a voice from somewhere else tells you you have to be.<eos> Remember that day with the Ouija board?<eos> I miss those days and I miss you.<eos> Nothing was supposed to happen this way, Doc.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You don't remember the Ouija board, do you, Doc?<eos> It had been one of those prolonged times of no dope.<eos> You think it knows where we can score?
So, the first step in the war on terrorism is to declare war on...<eos> - Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> - What?<eos> - Can I say something I'm ashamed of? - Yeah.<eos> It's not generous. - And I probably don't really mean it.<eos> - Okay. Go.<eos> - I think Jamie's great.<eos> - Just say it!<eos> I can't fucking believe his idiotic Facebook idea paid off!<eos> It's so fucking stupid!
- Please? Will you go back inside?<eos> - What the... It's not really about making anything.<eos> At least Jamie makes something.<eos> Do not compare what I do with him.<eos> Why not?<eos> When you felt a part of it, you loved it.<eos> And you use your movie as an excuse not to do anything.<eos> We don't go on vacations, we don't make decisions, we don't have kids.<eos> - I want a kid.<eos> - But you want it now that it's impossible.
Everyone.<eos> How's it going?<eos> Good, good.<eos> Uh...<eos> So, do you want to tell us a little bit about your approach with this cover?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd love a little explanation.<eos> Um...<eos> It...<eos> It is what it is.
First of all, I think your dick looks like a snowman's nose.<eos> Can you stop?<eos> Second of all,<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> I thought you worked tonight?<eos> She might come by the hospital.<eos> No.<eos> Mikey, I love your thinking on this, man.<eos> The work-date combination.<eos> It's very impressive.
She might come by the hospital.<eos> No.<eos> Mikey, I love your thinking on this, man.<eos> The work-date combination.<eos> It's very impressive.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'm just thinking on my toes.<eos> He knows shit, man.<eos> It's casual.<eos> It's innovative.
♪ I've been taken with a new emotion ♪<eos> Cheers!<eos> No. I got to hand it to you, man.<eos> I'm impressed by the way you hung in there.<eos> I should have left.<eos> I definitely should have left.<eos> I guess I'm a sucker for abuse.<eos> You must be.<eos> You know the hardest part about this costume?<eos> It was seeing this thing next to my actual dick.
It's a holiday.<eos> Hi.<eos> Oh, the turkey looks beautiful!<eos> And you got the red I like.<eos> I made everything just how you like it.<eos> I know you did.<eos> Mmm.<eos> This red is so smooth.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It feels a little off balance to me.
Mmm.<eos> This red is so smooth.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It feels a little off balance to me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Like something doesn't belong.<eos> Maybe it needs to breathe a little.<eos> It has, like, a chocolate undertone.
You're pretty disgusting, too.<eos> You're gross.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> What the...<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you post a funny video on Ellie's wall?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, you did, because I'm looking at it right now, Jason!<eos> What is it, funny cute?<eos> Or is it just funny?
You're gross.<eos> I'm a killer.<eos> What the...<eos> Did you...<eos> Did you post a funny video on Ellie's wall?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, you did, because I'm looking at it right now, Jason!<eos> What is it, funny cute?<eos> Or is it just funny?<eos> It is funny cute!
You will understand, soon enough.<eos> Anyway, come on. I have to lock up.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> You don't fucking start again!<eos> What is it?<eos> What is this?<eos> It's cold.<eos> You want me to eat this cold? You want me to eat it?<eos> You want me to fucking eat this cold? This...<eos> Leave the fucking thing. We're gonna fucking eat. I'll eat it.
She wants to go to travelling to London, you know?<eos> Ah, London's OK.<eos> - It's not how you remember it, Tony.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I've spent me whole life in London.<eos> It's a fantastic city.<eos> Perhaps I am... just an old man, talking.<eos> - But if you want to use the phone...<eos> - Yes, the phone!<eos> Where is it?
You need this?<eos> There it is, yeah.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> Should I walk you out?<eos> No, we both know what happened the last time you did that.<eos> That kind of makes me wanna walk you out even more, though.<eos> Great.<eos> Thanks!<eos> I can't believe I slept with him on the first date.<eos> It wasn't even your date. It was mine.
- I can't let you see them. - Come on.<eos> She got nice titties?<eos> Yo, stop being weird.<eos> Seriously.<eos> She got nice titties.<eos> I knew it, man.<eos> Let me see the phone.<eos> - Danny, you're freaking me out.<eos> - Bernie, let me see your phone.<eos> It's my phone!
(KNOCK ON DOOR)<eos> PEARLY:<eos> Enter!<eos> The fire at St. Paddy's is set for Sunday Mass.<eos> That's not what matters to me.<eos> - We got the word out to - everyone: 500 for his head.<eos> - And the horse?<eos> - The same.<eos> Seems like a lot for a horse.<eos> Well, that's because it's not a horse.
What makes these most precious... it's the way they accept the light.<eos> Peter Lake is human.<eos> But that horse...<eos> That horse might leave a trail.<eos> And Yahtzee!<eos> (CHUCKLES)<eos> Grand Central Station.<eos> Let's go and kill him.<eos> And while we're at it, let's try and grab that horse.<eos> You just said it was a dog.
Like locks.<eos> ISAAC:<eos> Aah!<eos> Just need to feel for the connection.<eos> That pipe's too hot, avoid it, avoid it.<eos> (ISAAC GRUNTS)<eos> This one's blocked.<eos> Means the problem's before it.<eos> (PETER GRUNTS)<eos> It's stuck.
Did I get sick and pass out again?<eos> Yes, Abby.<eos> But you're better now.<eos> (LAUGHS)<eos> BEVERLY:<eos> Why would so many things conspire to save one little girl's life?<eos> But what if it wasn't just Abby?<eos> What if she is no more or less special than any of us?<eos> What if we are all unique... and the universe loves us all equally?<eos> So much so that it bends over backwards across the centuries... for each and every one of us.
You're still free to choose.<eos> But you don't really want that.<eos> Beatrice...<eos> I want you to choose who you truly are... and where you truly belong.<eos> Not on a whim.<eos> Not because you wish you were someone you're not... but because you honestly know yourself.<eos> I want you to choose wisely.<eos> And I know you will.<eos> The faction system is a living being... composed of cells, all of you.<eos> And the only way it can survive and thrive... is for each of you to claim your rightful place.
No, it doesn't work like that.<eos> Even if they wanted to, their faction wouldn't allow it.<eos> Even if my parents would take me back...<eos> I wouldn't belong there anymore.<eos> This is getting depressing.<eos> You know what we should do? Get tattoos.<eos> Did you know they had a tattoo of your face?<eos> Like it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where would you get it?
No!<eos> Four?<eos> Four fears?<eos> Four then, four now.<eos> I keep going in there, but I don't think you ever lose them.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Sure.<eos> What's your tattoo?<eos> You wanna see it?<eos> It's amazing.
- She'll want to see him first.<eos> About damn time.<eos> Lacerated spinal column, cracked sternum, shattered collarbone, perforated liver, and one hell of a headache.<eos> Don't forget your collapsed lung.<eos> Let's not forget that.<eos> Otherwise, I'm good.<eos> They cut you open. Your heart stopped.<eos> Tetrodotoxin B.<eos> Slows the pulse to one beat a minute.<eos> Banner developed it for stress.
You're the architect.<eos> - Vincent Stevens.<eos> - We should talk sometime, Mr. Stevens.<eos> Sure.<eos> What do you got in mind, Mr. Fry?<eos> We have a new waterfront project.<eos> It's massive.<eos> It's cutting-edge.<eos> It might be right up your alley.<eos> Of course, it's all preliminary, and we have to keep it under wraps.
Get off!<eos> -I told you.<eos> I am running a bit late.<eos> It's over, Spider.<eos> Really?<eos> !<eos> I know we all think that we're immortal.<eos> We're supposed to feel that way.<eos> We're graduating.<eos> But, like our brief four years in high school what makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever.
-I told you.<eos> I am running a bit late.<eos> It's over, Spider.<eos> Really?<eos> !<eos> I know we all think that we're immortal.<eos> We're supposed to feel that way.<eos> We're graduating.<eos> But, like our brief four years in high school what makes life valuable is that it doesn't last forever.<eos> What makes it precious is that it ends.
How much?<eos> Hey, you're that spider guy.<eos> I'm Spider-Man.<eos> This Spider-Man.... He's not the police, he's not a fireman.<eos> What gives him the right to get involved in other people's business?<eos> Peter, honey?<eos> Can I come in?<eos> No!<eos> Peter, the final starts at 9, honey.<eos> You said you would take my car into the shop because it keeps dying, remember?
It's 14 years of research, and nothing to show for it.<eos> Except maybe this.<eos> Spider-Man.<eos> What about him?<eos> He was bitten by one of those things, and it worked.<eos> I don't know how and I don't know why but he can do everything else a spider can including self-heal.<eos> I need to find him.<eos> I need his blood.<eos> You need Spider-Man's blood?<eos> It'll save my life.
Yeah.<eos> I wanna help you, Mr. Osborn. I really, really do.<eos> I can't give you my blood.<eos> Not right now.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> If our blood is incompatible, you could die.<eos> I'm already dying.<eos> Your blood can't make me die more.<eos> But it could do something worse.
And I quote...<eos> "To Homo Neanderthalensis... his mutant cousin, Homo Sapiens..."<eos> "was an aberration.<eos> The arrival of the mutated human species, Homo Sapiens... was followed by the immediate extinction of their less evolved kin."<eos> Now, we are the Neanderthal.<eos> Speak for yourself, Dr. Trask.<eos> You know, when you sent our soldiers to Vietnam... without the weapons they needed to win the war... you underestimated your enemy.<eos> You do that with this enemy... and it won't be some border skirmish halfway around the world.<eos> This time, the war will be for our streets... our cities, our homes... and by the time you see the need for my program... it will be too late... and you will have lost two wars in one lifetime.<eos> We are sorry, Dr. Trask... but your Sentinel Program... it ain't gonna fly.
No, I'm full.<eos> Just dump it in the ocean.<eos> You know, we're all in the same boat, here.<eos> Actually, we're not.<eos> And perhaps you could express a little more concern... over the fact that you stole and destroyed... a $19 million vehicle!<eos> Bill me!<eos> Corporal?<eos> Corporal!<eos> We're picking up a signal, sir.<eos> It's five klicks southwest... but it stopped at that remote island.
But don't think of it as a game.<eos> Think of it as a real life experience.<eos> You are a cop, put in real life...<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Shut that shit off.<eos> Okay.<eos> Spare me the corny gimmicks.<eos> What's the game about?<eos> Um, it's called "Patrolman."
Where are you going?<eos> Hey, man!<eos> Congrats!<eos> Oh, it's Justin!<eos> Hey!<eos> Ryan said you were a big time video game designer now.<eos> I wouldn't say big time... but I definitely work on games.<eos> Come on!<eos> He said you just got done selling some huge game!<eos> What's it called?
Yeah, ese.<eos> Now, a few weeks ago... I pitched you a game and you didn't listen.<eos> That really hurt my feelings.<eos> You were there.<eos> So were you.<eos> Now, I'm going to pitch my game again and you're going to hear me out... or I'm going to beat the shit out of everyone in this room.<eos> And I've fought women before.<eos> I didn't win... but I'm down to redeem myself.<eos> What if we made a game so visceral... that it made you feel like you were in real life danger?<eos> To feel like it's about to go down?
The rest of us do it out of fear, because if you don't, Taiko will kill you or worse.<eos> Taiko has forced me to do so many things so vile, human trafficking, sex slavery.<eos> Gang rape.<eos> Talk to God.<eos> I'm not interested in your confession.<eos> Wait.<eos> Don't leave the video for him to see.<eos> Don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> Destroy it.
- Oh, my God. - We have to do something.<eos> We need 25 grand to pay off Howard. Hell no!<eos> Fuck Howard!<eos> I have another idea. Okay.<eos> You said it was on YouPorn, right?<eos> We're gonna be on it.<eos> Jesus Christ. I know, honey.<eos> We're not. Relax, okay?<eos> The Internet is not a free-floating thing.<eos> It's on a server somewhere.
I'm pretty sure the feeling is mutual, if that helps at all.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too. No.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Like, not in the way that we say it to each other all the time.<eos> I mean, I really love you.<eos> And I'm also really sorry about the video, if I hadn't said that already.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You hadn't.<eos> In a way, though, I'm also really glad that it happened.
My name is Principal Rodriguez and I would like to welcome everyone to our fourth-grade graduation ceremony.<eos> First up, I'd like to introduce our video yearbook maestro,<eos> - Clive Hargrove.<eos> This is a video I made showing the amazing year we had.<eos> Taking pictures and videos is really important because it reminds us what's really important<eos> and all the amazing times we had.<eos> So now I present to you our fourth-grade video yearbook.<eos> You erased the video off of our computer, right?<eos> Right, Jay?<eos> Is it Video 1 or Movie 1?
You erased the video off of our computer, right?<eos> Right, Jay?<eos> Is it Video 1 or Movie 1?<eos> Video 1, I think.<eos> - I love you.<eos> Call 911. - Okay.<eos> - It's Video 1.<eos> - No, wait, it's Movie 1.<eos> It's not Movie 1.<eos> - Wait, is it the most recent one? - Yeah, the most recent one.
You know how long it is since we ate meat?<eos> Since we even saw an animal?<eos> Easy.<eos> Please.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Justice.<eos> Why did they kill it?<eos> They eat them.<eos> Why?<eos> They think it makes them stronger.
How am I supposed to be a man?<eos> I said help your brother.<eos> You want me to stay a child!<eos> No!<eos> I'm asking you to be a man and do what needs to be done.<eos> Ham!<eos> Ham!<eos> What are you doing, Noah?<eos> The wickedness is not just in them.<eos> It's in all of us.
Outside, just the waters of chaos again.<eos> You are angry.<eos> You judge me.<eos> Let me tell you a story.<eos> The first story my father told me, and the first story that I told each of you.<eos> In the beginning, there was nothing.<eos> Nothing but the silence of an infinite darkness.<eos> But the breath of The Creator fluttered against the face of the void, whispering, "Let there be light."<eos> And light was.<eos> And it was good.
I will not fail You.<eos> I will not fail You.<eos> It shall be done.<eos> It shall be done.<eos> Father?<eos> The rains have stopped.<eos> The Creator smiles on our child.<eos> The rains have stopped because of your child, yes, but He does not smile.<eos> If your child is a boy, he will replace Japheth, last man.<eos> If it is a girl, who could mature into a mother, she must die.
The child is not being punished.<eos> We are all being punished.<eos> All of us.<eos> It's not something I want to do.<eos> It's something I have to do.<eos> It is painful, but it is just.<eos> Just?<eos> How?<eos> How is this just?<eos> It's a baby, Noah.
It makes reference to a Mr. Lipizzaner, as in the Spanish horses which are born black but gradually turn white.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is a process I'm guessing your bank is familiar with?<eos> The letter contains a number.<eos> Does it fit?<eos> Does it fit what?<eos> Is the number an account reference in use at this bank?<eos> I'm afraid my bank doesn't broadcast the manner in which it does its business.<eos> I'm sure that suits your clients very well.<eos> But if this number does pertain to an account held at this bank, it would have been established quite some time ago.
We know you've been watching him for months, and we know you're under pressure to get results.<eos> And we know that the man moves money through a network of Muslim charities and every time he does, some of it goes missing.<eos> Dr. Faisal Abdullah is everything we want him to be and a little bit more.<eos> He's tolerant, enlightened, engaged with the West.<eos> But every good man has a little bit of bad, doesn't he?<eos> And in Abdullah's case, that little bit<eos> just might kill you.<eos> You know all that, how come he's still walking the streets of Hamburg and not rotting in some cell in Guantanamo?<eos> Because we think, we don't know.<eos> The money leaves and we don't know where it goes.
You let Mohr off the leash?<eos> He doesn't need me to give him a reason to piss you off.<eos> You've lost Karpov, haven't you?<eos> I need the lawyer to move freely.<eos> I don't have that kind of influence, Gunther.<eos> We both know you have all the influence you choose to have.<eos> Look, if you want me to help you on your way, you've got to tell me.<eos> Tell me which way you're heading.<eos> Last month a cargo ship left Cyprus.<eos> It was carrying 1,000 tons of donated grain bound for Djibouti.

- Thanks.<eos> Dr. Abdullah, may I introduce your benefactor, Issa Karpov, and his lawyer, Miss Richter.<eos> I wish to speak with Issa alone.<eos> Of course.<eos> Miss Richter?<eos> Please tell me, why you have decided to make this generous gift?<eos> Are you under duress?<eos> No.<eos> Look at me.<eos> It is unclean money, sir.

Michael.<eos> Welcome to Berlin.<eos> Everyone got my report?<eos> Yes.<eos> You need to concentrate on Burgdorf, Ministry of the Interior.<eos> The final decision will be his.<eos> I'm going to need passports for Karpov and the Turks.<eos> We don't do passports.<eos> He gave the lawyer his word.<eos> I did, and this time I want it to mean something.

UM,' a F-16?<eos> (TV) F-16 jets were dispatched, to see what is going on<eos> But there were no Detected signs of life.<eos> -(Talking mess of journalists) -(Journalist),excuse me Sir.<eos> Could it be that someone survived!<eos> has?<eos> (Spokesman) At the present time We find this extremely unlikely.<eos> We are in our thoughts and prayers for the families of those affected.<eos> The aircraft flies well since five hours without crew on autopilot.<eos> Sooner or later it will not fuel more have and crash somewhere.
Spectacular, isn't it?<eos> It was here, on the Acropolis hill, that some believe Theseus's father, King Aegeus, looked out to sea, waiting for his son to return.<eos> See, Theseus had promised his father that if he defeated the Minotaur, he'd hoist a white sail on his ship as a tribute but he was so excited to get back home he forgot and he flew the same black sail that he set out with.<eos> Well, thinking his son was dead, the heartbroken king flung himself onto the rocks below, another victim of the cruel tricks gods play on men.<eos> Well, I hope you ladies brought your handkerchiefs, 'cause the next thing you're about to see has been known to make some weep at first sight.<eos> Follow me.<eos> Completed in 438 BC, the Parthenon.<eos> From the Greek word "parthenes", meaning "virgins".<eos> "The ancient Greeks were masters of deception.<eos> "Even though the base of the Parthenon appears straight to the naked eye, "it is, in fact, completely crooked.
There you go.<eos> A steal.<eos> You must be doing pretty well, though, if you're staying at the Grand.<eos> Honey, look at this.<eos> It's beautiful, isn't it?<eos> Sure is.<eos> Actually, you know what? This is a Cretan design.<eos> You see how the snakes come together and never end?<eos> That represents immortality.<eos> People wear it as a protection charm.
No, no, no.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I think you should.<eos> Come on.<eos> No, we've got the baby, so...<eos> We've got the baby. We can't.<eos> Come on.<eos> Just real quick.<eos> You have the baby monitor right there.<eos> We do, it's working.
You are the king of lies.<eos> And while I don't believe anyone... let alone the bastard son of Shen can bring me harm, legend claims that the one thing that can stop me is the weapon on your back in the chosen one's hands.<eos> So you see, both must be destroyed.<eos> It's over, Nariko.<eos> Your family, your clan, your home all gone!<eos> Nothing left to fight for.<eos> So let us be done with it.<eos> Drop the sword.<eos> Yes.<eos> Now put it down... and back away.
You see, you lose.<eos> Our task is to deliver this sword to our brother.<eos> Maybe Kai was wrong.<eos> What Nariko did protected Kai.<eos> Sword stopped that horrid fish lady.<eos> Maybe sword isn't bad.<eos> Kai, I felt its power flowing through me.<eos> But as it did, I could feel the sword tearing my soul apart.<eos> The sword will kill the bearer. It's only a matter of time.<eos> It's too powerful.
Well, they started it.<eos> Nariko make more blood than Kai.<eos> We're close.<eos> You know what's strange?<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He's in there.<eos> Nariko!<eos> Sword is bad.<eos> Very bad.<eos> It wants to kill Nariko.
Our journey has ended.<eos> There's no turning back.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> Either move aside or die.<eos> I don't care which.<eos> Hello, Nariko.<eos> Kyo?<eos> It doesn't have to end this way.<eos> All he wants is the sword.<eos> Give it to him.
You will not fail.<eos> Have I ever?<eos> Xandarians.<eos> What a bunch of losers.<eos> All of them in a big hurry to get from something stupid, to nothing at all.<eos> Pathetic.<eos> Look at this guy!<eos> Can you believe they call us criminals, when he's assaulting us with that haircut?<eos> What is this thing?<eos> Look how it thinks it's so cool.
Yondu is gonna be here in two seconds.<eos> He expects to hear this big plan of ours.<eos> I need your help.<eos> I look around at us. You know what I see?<eos> Losers.<eos> I mean, like, folks who have lost stuff.<eos> And we have. Man, we have. All of us.<eos> Our homes, our families,<eos> normal lives.<eos> And, usually, life takes more than it gives.

Do you have any idea how easy this was?<eos> You're right, I failed.<eos> You've made your point.<eos> No, Bill, you failed miserably!<eos> Three thousand people died that day, including my father!<eos> So I joined up 'cause I wanted to go fight the cowards that did it.<eos> But I just ended up fighting in a war that I still don't understand and came home to a country where nothing had changed.<eos> Until now.<eos> Security is this country's biggest lie.<eos> In our homes, in our cities, in our planes, no one's safe, and one day somebody worse than me is gonna expose that lie, and the last thing our children will see is our failure as it destroys them.
You can't change the world with words, Bill, unless you write those words in the evening news with blood.<eos> We gotta go.<eos> You're military.<eos> These are the people you fought to protect.<eos> I swore to protect my country, and that's what I'm doing.<eos> - You believe that?<eos> - I do.<eos> I also believe we'll be $150 million richer.<eos> You'll never get that money. It's in an account in my name.<eos> It's in a trust in your name.
Yes, Captain.<eos> I told you, he's been protecting someone for years.<eos> Then let's find out who the girl is.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, you're okay.<eos> You're okay.<eos> It's just withdrawals.<eos> The man who shot them...<eos> I saw his face.<eos> It was burned.
- What is he saying, Elliot?<eos> I'm saying your mother never wore a seat belt.<eos> Michael, wait in the other room.<eos> - Elliot?<eos> - Just wait in the other room.<eos> For real?<eos> OK.<eos> That game ruined me.<eos> I had everything before and nothing after.<eos> It poisoned me. Every cell from that day to this.
- Seems to have been a burglary.<eos> - Oh?<eos> What of?<eos> Well, that's just it.<eos> Nothing missing, really.<eos> What's he doing in Manchester?<eos> Something with machines.<eos> (exhales)<eos> The project at the NPL.<eos> I checked but he won't say what it's on.
- Who are you?<eos> - Alan Turing.<eos> - Ah, Turing.<eos> The mathematician.<eos> - Correct.<eos> However could I have guessed?<eos> You didn't.<eos> You just read it on that piece of paper.<eos> King's College, Cambridge.<eos> Now it says here you were a bit of a prodigy in the Maths Department.
Oh, Enigma isn't difficult.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> The Americans, the Russians, the French, the Germans.<eos> Everyone thinks Enigma is unbreakable.<eos> Good.<eos> Let me try, then we'll know for sure, won't we?<eos> (Denniston) Welcome to Enigma.<eos> The details of every surprise attack, every secret convoy, and every U-boat in the bloody Atlantic go into that thing<eos> and out comes gibberish.<eos> It's beautiful.
It's beautiful.<eos> (Denniston) It's the crooked hand of death itself.<eos> Our Wrens intercept thousands of radio messages a day.<eos> And to the lovely young ladies of the Women's Royal Navy, they're nonsense.<eos> It's only when you feed them back into Enigma that they make any sense.<eos> But we have an Enigma machine.<eos> Yes, Polish Intelligence smuggled it out of Berlin.<eos> (John) So what's the problem?<eos> Just put the intercepted messages back into the Enigma and...<eos> Look, it's not that simple.
- Uh, Hugh, hello.<eos> - Didn't know you drank.<eos> He doesn't, really.<eos> He just sort of sips at the foam.<eos> I'll let you into a little secret, Miss...<eos> - Clarke.<eos> - Miss Clarke.<eos> - Please.<eos> - Foam's my favourite part, too.<eos> - Is it really?
It's all right.<eos> Oh, well... (chuckles)<eos> That's a much nicer ring than the one I... I made you.<eos> Yes.<eos> His name's Jock.<eos> He's an army man, if you can believe it.<eos> - We work together. - (chuckling tearfully)<eos> (sobbing)<eos> Why don't we do a crossword puzzle?<eos> It'll only take us five minutes.
This is the draw for the Super Lottery for $ 34 million.<eos> The first number is 44 The following is 2, 38.<eos> 24, 21 and 54.<eos> Rays!<eos> I was so close, had the correct but in a different order numbers.<eos> Heaven my stomach is me You killing me bring my medicine?<eos> I'm getting ready a bowl of oats, I composed the stomach.<eos> What do you do?<eos> I prepare lunch for my husband.<eos> It's not enough.
- Forget the package.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> You should get up.<eos> Calm down.<eos> - Would we send.<eos> - Do Not!<eos> Do Not!<eos> We can not.<eos> The culmination of my life is in this package.<eos> It is valuable to ship.

Dr. if that made me laugh.<eos> PhD wash dishes perhaps, is not it?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> You say Lloyd, this type thinks we're doctors.<eos> We are not inside it.<eos> Act intelligently.<eos> And he will not find out.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey waiter, the costs a beer?<eos> - It's free.

Don't personalize this, Camila.<eos> Sometimes we have to harm one in order to save millions.<eos> The sample's in the ready position, doctor.<eos> Good morning, Mr Porter. It's time for your 8:30.<eos> Jorge, prepare for another extraction. Mark it 0713.<eos> Bridget, I'll need a full work up on the genome and the basic protein.<eos> Don't you get up, Mr Porter.<eos> Don't you move. It's my blood you want, right?<eos> You want it?<eos> Take it!
How is that possible?<eos> Dr Edwards, please.<eos> Penny, the girl on our boat.<eos> We need to get you to her now. - Excuse me?<eos> Didn't you respond to our stress call?<eos> I wouldn't lower that gun. - You don't move.<eos> He lured you here under false pretenses, he's gonna take your boat and he's gonna leave you behind.<eos> - That's ridiculous.<eos> - No. Every one of these hazmat suits is equipped with a small high power radio system in the right sleeve.<eos> It's radio, it doesn't have enough power to reach the mainland.
What can they do for us in the ER anyway?<eos> Dr Edwards has been working on a virus site. - A what?<eos> Virus killer.<eos> If we can make it to the CDC facility in time, they might be able to bind it.<eos> You don't look so good, relax..<eos> Breathe..<eos> Breathe, where's your boat?<eos> It's waiting for us on the beach just over there.<eos> Wait, wait, we can't go in there.<eos> It's contaminated. It's conta..
Oh, yeah.<eos> Mom.<eos> What?<eos> What? You... you packed a bag?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> No one is going anywhere. I am.<eos> I'm just not taking this asshole with me.<eos> Hey, you're not exactly my first choice for a traveling companion, either, but at this exact moment, you're the best bet I have to get out of this stupid house.<eos> Mom! I'm sorry, Deborah, but it is a stupid house, and I hate it.
Yeah?<eos> Look at this thing!<eos> My God.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Yeah, it's, um... Yeah.<eos> It's... it's cool.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I like it.<eos> "Okay"?<eos> It's majestic.
I've been looking all over creation for you.<eos> Quite a show you two put on.<eos> I didn't start anything.<eos> Well, you sure finished it, though, didn't you?<eos> Just stand there while she said shitty things to me?<eos> It's not fair.<eos> What the hell does fair have to do with it?<eos> I got a big news flash for you, Tammy.<eos> Life isn't fair. You're gonna have to scrape and claw for everything you want, just like the rest of us.<eos> You know, for years, you've been bellyachin' and complainin' about how your life sucks, but you haven't done one single thing to make it better.
I folded your clothes.<eos> I'm so glad you're home.<eos> Thanks for letting me stay here.<eos> Oh, yeah. Mm.<eos> You look good.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Prison agree with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Think it kind of did.
(ENGINE STUTTERS)<eos> Come on.<eos> (ENGINE REVS)<eos> That's my girl.<eos> Dad, it's getting worse out there.<eos> (MAN SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY ON SCREEN)<eos> Still no signal.<eos> KAITLYN:<eos> My phone.<eos> It's not working.
Leave a message.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad!<eos> Please help us!<eos> The building fell down on top of us, and there's water pouring in and I don't know how long we've got!<eos> Dad!<eos> Aah.<eos> Oh, Shit!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I'm sorry. It's dead.
A handful ofAutobots were given sanctuary afterjoint-combat operations were abolished.<eos> Fewer than a dozen Decepticons are still on the run thanks to our CIA unit,<eos> "Cemetery Wind."<eos> Hurry, Iet's get it to my house, guys.<eos> As for the alien technology, our objective remains to keep it in American control.<eos> Hi.<eos> My name is Timothy.<eos> This is my crew.<eos> We found this alien ball turret in Chicago.<eos> We just found it in the rubble and it's all working...

What do you think?<eos> Why don't you look at all of this?<eos> This could be yours. What about this land?<eos> purple people Eater's back and she looks hungry.<eos> Isn't this incredible?<eos> -I knew you would Iike it.<eos> -Hey, you!<eos> Hey.<eos> I own this house!<eos> It's not for sale!
Tran...<eos> -Evacuate!<eos> -Wait! Guys!<eos> Dad, are you out of your mind?<eos> You need to get that thing out of here.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> I've been in there working all night. I'm fine.<eos> You know what? That's not a truck, okay?<eos> You're right.<eos> It's an alien killing machine.
The present is past.<eos> The future is now.<eos> Why can't I get in touch with you?<eos> Don't you realise what the Arctic find means?<eos> You know that story we were all told as children about a giant asteroid that struck the Earth millions of years ago and wiped out the dinosaurs?<eos> -vaguely.<eos> -We were wrong.<eos> This metal caused the great extinction.<eos> How and why, I can't yet say.<eos> But carbon dating puts it at 65 million years B.C.
And now GaIvatron is after that Seed.<eos> Look. I know you have a conscience because you're an inventor, Iike me.<eos> Do not let Galvatron anywhere near that Seed.<eos> I control GaIvatron.<eos> I created him.<eos> Deep down, I know you know.<eos> Your prototype's been controlling you.<eos> How fast can that thing get us halfway around the world?<eos> Very.<eos> It's a spaceship.
Right now I have two unpublished novels and I'm working on a third that I'm really excited about.<eos> It's called pizza to go.<eos> Um, I'm pretty happy with what I've got so far.<eos> But it's only a hundred pages long right now.<eos> I haven't written in two weeks.<eos> Hannah keeps teasing me about my writers block.<eos> I think about her a lot. She's all I think about.<eos> I really want to ask her out.<eos> My latest project is called sleeping on the moon.<eos> It is about pain and rejection.

Absolutely.<eos> This is William's decision.<eos> Just read it.<eos> Just read it. And tell me if you can figure out the word.<eos> And then tell me if you think it's better or worse.<eos> One goddamn word.<eos> Anyone?<eos> Flawed?<eos> Close.<eos> Oh, I got it.

And let me tell ya something else.<eos> The back page is in Chinese.<eos> Yes, it's Chinese.<eos> I know Chinese when I see it, ok?<eos> A Chinese assault rifle almost cost me an eye at hamburger hill so I know Chinese when I see it, alright mister?<eos> This is good, Henry.<eos> This is so good.<eos> Yeah, you think so?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> Do you think it's ready for the group?
Can we just, like, turn these off for a second?<eos> Why? What's wrong?<eos> I just...<eos> I have never read the great gatsby.<eos> Henry, I didn't go to college, ok?<eos> I mean, I've heard of Hemingway and twain, somewhere, but I don't have the smarts and the education that you do.<eos> I haven't read all these incredible novels.<eos> My stories, they just come from my heart.<eos> So tell me about this book.<eos> Gatsby is about social position. It's about the American dream. How um...
How much do you need William?<eos> Five thousand.<eos> Ok.<eos> Poodles.<eos> Thanks for, uh, everything.<eos> Today is a big day in my life.<eos> Com.<eos> Now all books, your fiction, your nonfiction, they're all ranked by sales.<eos> Obviously everybody wants to be number one.<eos> But they say that a book is selling well on Amazon if it's in the top five thousand.

Did you see what he had in his hands?<eos> Oi, what do the red crosses mean?<eos> I think it means they're dead, Nate.<eos> Smythe's wife and kid.<eos> Nate, Morse Code Martin was right.<eos> He's alive, I knew it.<eos> I bloody knew it.<eos> Region 632-7560.<eos> 632-7560...<eos> Nate, your implant, it's flashing.
He will be examined.<eos> We must capture him alive, Zone Chief Smythe.<eos> - Can't you just lock him out? - To reconfigure the system would entail taking each and every robot offline.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> But you can track his mother, though.<eos> Let me know where she is and I'll...<eos> The boy's mother is not a priority.<eos> But if we have her, we'll have him, can't you see?<eos> A sky ship carrying 4,096 deep scanners is en route.<eos> It will arrive in 15 hours and 42 minutes approximately.

This one here says the line's frozen.<eos> Yes, we these reverse mortgages, you can only borrow a percentage of the equity you have in the house.<eos> That's call the loan to value.<eos> But, now, since you've been getting monthly payments from us for the last... eight years, you've reached the cash out limit.<eos> That's that loan to value thing I just mentioned.<eos> - The house it worth...<eos> - It WAS worth... whatever it WAS worth.<eos> I need that money.<eos> I'm sorry, Mr. McKenna, there really nothing I can do...<eos> - It is what it is.

Havana, sweetheart, I've... I don't know if you've read the trades, but um... They unannounced that Damien went with Azita.<eos> I mean I can't say it's a complete surprise but uh... I'm very angry at the way it was handled.<eos> I mean it...it... it just makes me look foolish.<eos> But that's my problem not yours.<eos> I'm so sorry, honey!<eos> I have calls into Damien. And I hate to be leaving this on your phone, I...<eos> I... I just didn't want you to hear it from someone else.<eos> As you know I mean I strongly think there's no love lost on this project.<eos> Those were always my feelings.<eos> I know and I respect the reasons why it was so important to you, but I...
Thought I'd see if I can find you.<eos> Is it supposed to be a burn?<eos> No, I don't think so.<eos> I think uh it's a birthmark or something.<eos> We're half an hour away.<eos> Go back to make-up and get some color on that thing.<eos> They did have a cover... for the pool but... The motor was in the shop for repair.<eos> He didn't swim?<eos> The father heard the phone...<eos> And he thought it was Azita so he went inside for like
And my holes are my holes better?<eos> You wanna fuck my holes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got to go.<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Don't get out, just climb over.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> I took the bus.<eos> What's wrong with the car?<eos> It broke.
All right, I'll meet you outside.<eos> OK, see ya.<eos> Why are we really here, Ethan?<eos> I wanted to see you.<eos> And our daughter, you want to see her too?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I started a college fund.<eos> Why the sudden interest?<eos> It's not sudden, Tina.
Gosh, did you have to get the biggest bike there?<eos> It's not the biggest bike, Zooey, it's a girl's bike.<eos> Right, you picked it 'cause it had the big bow on it.<eos> No. I can explain the big bow, I got it.<eos> Get on.<eos> There's too many people.<eos> Look, can we go somewhere private?<eos> - Gosh. - There's not too many people.<eos> But it's purple.<eos> It is purple.
You didn't hurt him?<eos> No, you keep that, that's yours now.<eos> My God. This is not the first time for you, after all.<eos> Actually, it is.<eos> What about your daughter?<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> I was working far away, in Africa to be precise. You were doing good?<eos> I don't even remember.<eos> The baby is coming!<eos> It is a girl.
Are you Catholic, lieutenant?<eos> I am tonight.<eos> Dear Father.<eos> Weep you might when you hear of my many adventures with these fine men.<eos> It would remind you of our treasure hunts when I was a boy.<eos> But rather than a whistle or a top, our prizes are Rembrandts and Rubens.<eos> It feels odd that in a place with so much death, I've never felt more alive.<eos> My thoughts soar with the tales these streets could tell of the Madonna's long journey to Paris and her triumphant return with the fall of Napoleon.<eos> You can see her porcelain hand gently holding the small boy as if to guard him from a fate she knew would come.<eos> I know in a time of war my endeavor must seem small, and perhaps it is.
It's a message from home.<eos> We may have to confiscate a phonograph.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ Till the petals fall ♪ - Doc!<eos> - Sir. - Over here.<eos> - We found him on the side of the road.<eos> He took one in the chest.<eos> His leg's bleeding.<eos> We put a tourniquet on it.<eos> Let's get this shirt off and see how bad it is.
Hundreds of paintings.<eos> And you believe these paintings are in the mines?<eos> No.<eos> No, not these.<eos> This is all I have, James.<eos> This is my life.<eos> I understand.<eos> This is every piece of art that came through the Jeu de Paume.<eos> Now, I have kept train manifests, receipts, letters for every single piece.<eos> Who it belonged to, who took it, where they took it.
-[WHISPERING] What are you doing?<eos> -Shh.<eos> Shh.<eos> But on the day we rise, we will see with clarity and understand the mystery of his ways.<eos> Let us pray.<eos> WAYNE:<eos> There are three types of people in this world.<eos> Sheep, wolves and sheepdogs.<eos> Now, some people prefer to believe that evil doesn't exist in the world.<eos> And if it ever darkened their doorstep, they wouldn't know how to protect themselves.
[GUNSHOT]<eos> I'm better when it's breathing.<eos> TAYA:<eos> Oh, my God. Chris.<eos> -What's wrong?<eos> -No!<eos> MAN [ON TV]:<eos> Here 's the tape.<eos> You see the ﬁrst plane coming in from what looks like the east side.<eos> And it goes into the building with the flames and the smoke billowing out the other side of the tower.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you were dead.<eos> I'm not. I'm right here.<eos> -You all right?<eos> —Yeah.<eos> You're the most beautiful thing I've ever seen.<eos> I have an alien growing inside me.<eos> And there's a strange man in my bedroom.<eos> It's our bedroom.
Babe, I do it for you.<eos> I do it to protect you.<eos> —No, you don't.<eos> —Yes, I do.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Your family is here.<eos> Your children have no father.<eos> —Yeah, well, I have to serve my country.<eos> -Such fucking bullshit!<eos> No, it's not.
There's a dead giant in our backyard!<eos> There is?<eos> You know there is!<eos> You could have been crushed!<eos> But, Mother, look!<eos> The most beautiful harp!<eos> You've stolen too much!<eos> You could have been killed climbing down that plant!<eos> We buried her under some leaves!<eos> Here, here, it's here!
What brings you into the woods?<eos> The royal quarters have been destroyed.<eos> No! The kingdom is under attack.<eos> What is the royal family going to do?<eos> How should I know?<eos> I don't make policy, I just carry it out.<eos> I think it best we just go back to the village. We'll take the girl with us.<eos> Come with us, you're going to be fine.<eos> It's a giant!<eos> It's a giant woman!
A part of a satellite?<eos> All right, all right, um, Munch, film me while I'm... - while I'm touching this thing.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, absolutely.<eos> Let me try it.<eos> It's dusty.<eos> It's a piece of crap.<eos> What?<eos> Forget about it.<eos> Just turn off the camera.<eos> Well, it's not a national treasure, but it could be used for something.
It's a bomb; that's what you're supposed to do.<eos> That's not what you do with a bomb!<eos> Are you insane? !<eos> What was that?<eos> It's not my phone.<eos> It's the thing, whatever that is.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - It's that. That's what just made that noise.<eos> I, uh...<eos> It, like, imitated my ring-tone.
It, like, imitated my ring-tone.<eos> This is what made our phones barf?<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> All right, so, a couple of seconds ago, our phones went crazy. Bananas, insane.<eos> I don't know what to call it.<eos> You see that?<eos> It's a new map, but on my phone this time.<eos> All right, him, or...<eos> Dude, Munch's phone got all weird hieroglyphics and, ugh, I don't even know what that is.<eos> Alex's phone, it just turned on by itself and started filming.

That is weird.<eos> It's showing us where we are.
Wait, wait, be careful.<eos> Your phone just got a new map. What?<eos> - Wait, why is it opening?<eos> Hold on, hold on.<eos> Did you see that just now?<eos> What is that? - Whoa! What is that?<eos> - What is that?<eos> - What is that? - Oh, my...<eos> Dude, move, you're blocking my shot.<eos> It-It's moving.
How are you feeling?<eos> Yeah, not bad.<eos> Bit smoked.<eos> Right.<eos> Last night, who did that?<eos> And why did they target me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it someone trying to get to you through me?<eos> Is it something to do with this terrorist thing you talked about?<eos> I don't know, I can't see the pattern. It's too nebulous.
Sure thing.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You have groupies?<eos> Why don't I get groupies? Excuse me.<eos> Dr. Waters, would you like to do a run-through?<eos> - Yes. I'll see you backstage.<eos> - All right.<eos> ...Important distinction.<eos> This created brain is self-sustaining.<eos> And it's capable of emotional expressivity... and of self-awareness.
Okay.<eos> I'll get dressed.<eos> Take a look.<eos> That's gotta weigh 800 pounds.<eos> Welcome.<eos> We're glad you're here.<eos> What are all these people doing here?<eos> RIFT posted a video of Martin online.<eos> It went viral.<eos> You mean you let it go viral.
What about your marriage?<eos> The oaths you took?<eos> Listen.<eos> She's happier now that she's seeing him.<eos> A lot more settled down, a lot calmer.<eos> And I'm not under surveillance any more. I can just reel in whatever time I like.<eos> So everybody's happy.<eos> Where's the harm in that?<eos> Shall I cut you a side of beef to take home?<eos> It's freshly slaughtered.
They wanna know where the last one is. The one they never found.<eos> The one I connected up.<eos> Why can't you tell them, Freddie?<eos> Give the family some kind of peace.<eos> I wanted to, Father, but for the life of me I cannot remember where I put it.<eos> I know it was in the woods somewhere.<eos> Where did I leave my keys? No!<eos> I wasn't in my right mind.<eos> You know, LSD.<eos> It was like a... fairytale.
He begrudgingly gave me a ride.<eos> Where are you headed?<eos> Just down the beach.<eos> Can I come along?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> Maybe later.<eos> That's fine.<eos> You know, I don't wanna keep you.<eos> Did you finish your book?<eos> Yes, I did. I don't know how good it is.

They say that's the easy way out.<eos> Nothing easy about it, I wouldn't have thought.<eos> I'm in a bad way, Father.<eos> No, I'm not putting you on.<eos> The truth is, I've been in a bad way for a long time.<eos> Not wanting to do anything. Feeling of nothing being worthwhile.<eos> A sense of disassociation.<eos> Detachment.<eos> I had a wife and kids they meant nothing to me.<eos> I have money, it means nothing to me.
I don't want to hear another word of this superstitious nonsense uttered in this house again.<eos> If any of you are too frightened, well, you can leave.<eos> I am too frightened.<eos> We should go back to Oxford.<eos> Salvage what's left of the term.<eos> What about Jane?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We gave her a break, now we need one.<eos> Have you seen this sigil before?<eos> Does it mean anything to you?
They're just girls having fun in Vegas.<eos> It's really not a big deal.<eos> They probably got no dad in their life, low self-esteem. It's very sad, actually.<eos> By the way, Bennett, that fanny-pack really screams "Vegas Weekend."<eos> Yeah, Tish got it for me.<eos> It's safer to keep your money in the front in Vegas.<eos> - Plus, she gave me a bonus.<eos> - Bet she did.<eos> And I can get to the money if I need to.<eos> It's right in the front.
It's right in the front.<eos> I can't wait to get to the room.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, good, there's gonna be like an hour between check-in and separation.<eos> - For what?<eos> - We're trying to have a baby, ASAP.<eos> I waited nine years to get married, so we're, you know.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> I'm so happy for you!<eos> - I hope for your sake it's a boy.
You won't be needing this.<eos> Another one.<eos> Put the tea over to the left.<eos> Girls are gonna love this.<eos> - Ladies.<eos> - Hey!<eos> Sonia!<eos> You came already.<eos> - My God, your outfit is so cute. - Thank you!<eos> But it is not complete without
The promotion is for $4,000 discount a night.<eos> Normally, the Constantine is $44,000 a night, but with your special promotion, you are getting an amazing savings.<eos> Plus, you're getting 40,000 gold points.<eos> I don't give a damn about them gold points.<eos> You know what, Marcel?<eos> - Actually, you know what I just realized? - What?<eos> - That room is too much.<eos> It's too big.<eos> - Too big?<eos> 'Cause it's too big for one person.

You score by understanding that you can't move forward until you both let go of the past.<eos> You hear that, Gail?<eos> Let the shit go!<eos> Michael?<eos> I am looking for my son.<eos> He's down at the concierge, still looking for venues.<eos> You know, Candace, maybe this is for the best.<eos> Sometimes we have to read the signs in our lives.<eos> Now if you really loved my son you'd go back there, finish packing and set him free.<eos> I am ending this conversation right now, Miss Loretta, because if I say another word, we will both regret it.
Jessica, it's your mother.<eos> Rose... your grandmother just passed away.<eos> The funeral is next weekend.<eos> I would appreciate it if you came.<eos> Dear Jessica, I hope this modest endeavour helps you find peace in your dreams.<eos> In this chapter we will approach the healing power of dreams.<eos> The idea behind the treatment, is for sleeping patients to fight and destroy the subconscious evil, that gnaws at them, in a perfectly lucid state of mind.<eos> During the exploration of dreams, we encounter many symbolic patterns.<eos> You see... the horse is one of them.<eos> Carl Jung sees it as one of archetypes of the Mother.
- What story?<eos> Nothing to be proud of.<eos> When she was a... teenage girl... Catelyn wasn't a Virgin Mary... if you see what I mean.<eos> But her behavior was nothing but a reaction... a form of... rebellion.<eos> Rebellion against what?<eos> She had to live by her father's rules.<eos> Drastic rules.<eos> He was a powerful man comming from an even more powerful family.<eos> And Catelyn was forced... to respect... his legacy.<eos> It was harsh... and sad.
I thought you were smarter than that.<eos> That's my brother's.<eos> That's right.<eos> I look forward to seeing you in class.<eos> Unbelievable!<eos> That's what I'm talking about. All right, geniuses, let's feed those hungry brains. Back to the café!<eos> Dinner is on me!<eos> Yes! Nothing is better than free food!<eos> - Aunt cass?<eos> - Unless it's moldy.
I am contacting them now.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> I... don't do that. Your friends have been contacted.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Now, what are you doing?<eos> Other treatments include compassion and physical reassurance.<eos> I'm okay. Really.<eos> You will be all right.<eos> I am sorry about the fire.<eos> It's okay. It was an accident.
The Russians don't even know the sub's there, the Georgians know, but not its exact location, and Agora can't go in till the dispute's settled.<eos> I mean, they're tied up in paperwork and fucking politics.<eos> Meanwhile that submarine is just sitting on the seabed, full of gold.<eos> What is it you want from me?<eos> I need a submarine.<eos> Blackie here has contacts in Sevastopol, but it will cost.<eos> 180,000. And men.<eos> I need men.<eos> Half British, half Russian.<eos> It's a Russian sub, so they'll need Russians.
That's it.<eos> There you go.<eos> Fraser.<eos> Keep pushing it.<eos> Fraser, it's the ridge.<eos> We're heading right for that drop.<eos> - Fraser, we need to stop.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Robinson, get rid of the gold.<eos> Can you keep it coming, Fraser?
Come on, harder, harder. Come on.<eos> We're almost there.<eos> Just get it over this bit, we'll be fine.<eos> We'll be fine.<eos> - We're not gonna make it, Fraser.<eos> - Just pull it, Peters.<eos> Pull it.<eos> You lazy bastard.<eos> It's going. The gold.<eos> The gold, it's going.
Thank you.<eos> Ah, Manolo.<eos> Always giving away stuff for free.<eos> Right, dad?<eos> Joaquin's father, captain mondragon... Had passed away fighting the fearsome bandit... Known as chakal.<eos> Who's in there?<eos> Young sir, may I please have some of your bread?<eos> I'm so hungry.<eos> This bread is for my father.<eos> And it's delicious.
Okay, my turn!<eos> One, two, one, two, tres, cuatro!<eos> That girl is way out of your league, bro.<eos> Hey, let's eat!<eos> I love you too much to live without you loving me back<eos> I love you too much heaven's my witness and this is a fact<eos> I know I belong when I sing this song there's love above love and it's ours 'cause I love you too much<eos> I live for your touch<eos> I whisper your name night after night<eos> I love you too much there's only one feeling and I know it's right
They'll help me find Maria!<eos> Can you take me to them?<eos> I would love nothing more than to reunite a young couple.<eos> Just hold on!<eos> I've been down here for years... Awaiting my beloved honey bunny.<eos> Hi, honey!<eos> Too soon!<eos> Go!<eos> The land of the remembered was vibrant and joyous!<eos> Everything was like the land above... But it was more colorful... It was more beautiful, it was more festive!
Thank you.<eos> That's kind. Are you remembering to eat?<eos> Well, a lot of cold cuts.<eos> I'm gonna fix you up my world-famous chicken Frito pie.<eos> That's very kind and very unnecessary.<eos> You have to keep your strength.<eos> Would you... say, "Chicken Frito pie!"<eos> You know what?<eos> Would you delete that picture for me?<eos> - It's a nice photo.
Let me tell you what Amy told me.<eos> She dumped you, you completely unraveled.<eos> You stalked her, you threatened her... and you attempted suicide in her bed and were institutionalized.<eos> Your wife is missing, and you came all this way to tell me this?<eos> I thought there might be another side to this story.<eos> Mr. Collings.<eos> The missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne. She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.<eos> You're reading that diary again?<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> It interests me.
Mr. Collings.<eos> The missing persons case of Amy Elliott Dunne. She is the beautiful blonde inspiration for the Amazing Amy kids' book series.<eos> You're reading that diary again?<eos> You know how it ends.<eos> It interests me.<eos> Hey, Rhonda.<eos> "He's gonna kill me. " The end.<eos> Why did he go to his dad's house to burn it?<eos> It's private. There's no one there.<eos> Why didn't he make sure it actually burned?
You saved them.<eos> Knowing you were out there... was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years.<eos> Let's go to the police. You can explain everything.<eos> No, I can't turn up now.<eos> I'd be a pariah.<eos> Everyone would hate me.<eos> Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?<eos> He should go to prison for what he's done.<eos> I'm setting you up at my lake house.<eos> It's utterly secluded.
But I don't care about that anymore.<eos> I just want to find my wife.<eos> - I'm just trying to get clear...<eos> - Let me be clear. Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy.<eos> I'm not a good guy.<eos> I was a bad husband to a great wife.<eos> I broke the vow that I made to her.<eos> Those are pretty words, Nick.<eos> But what does that really mean to you?<eos> It basically means that I was a con artist.
Shave me.<eos> Sodomize me.<eos> There were cameras everywhere.<eos> Please find this.<eos> Please find the tapes.<eos> She slit his throat with a box cutter.<eos> How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter... if he had her tied up the whole time?<eos> Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe?<eos> Amy, we found your diary.<eos> It contains many concerning allegations of mental and physical abuse.
- Tax-free?<eos> - Can she do that?<eos> Who's Gustave H?<eos> I'm afraid that's me, darling.<eos> That fucking faggot!<eos> He's a concierge.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I've come to pay my respects to a great woman whom I loved.<eos> - This man is an intruder in my home!<eos> - It's not yours yet, Dmitri.
I miss you deeply as I write from the confines of my regrettable and preposterous incarceration.<eos> Until I walk amongst you again as a free man, the Grand Budapest remains in your hands, as does its impeccable reputation.<eos> Keep it spotless and glorify it.<eos> Take extra special care of every little-bitty bit of it as if I were watching over you like a hawk with a horse whip in its talons, because I am.<eos> Should I discover a lapse of any variety during my absence,<eos> I promise, swift and merciless justice will descend upon you.<eos> A great and noble house has been placed under your protection.<eos> Tell Zero if you see any funny business.<eos> "Your devoted Monsieur Gustave."<eos> Then there's a poem, but we might want to start on the soup since it's 46 stanzas.
I believe that there are different levels of evil in the world.<eos> No rituals, no magic.<eos> It already dwells in all of us... that's it, that's the battle.
I met a little girl.<eos> I followed her out to the woods.<eos> A little girl?<eos> Why don't I like where this is going?<eos> Listen to me!<eos> I watched her die.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You tell me, was it this little girl?<eos> - No.<eos> - Who was it, Mrs. Brodie?
Why would she be scared of me?<eos> - Of what then?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Do I look nuts to you?<eos> What is it you're hiding, Mrs. Brodie?<eos> I can't do this.<eos> I-I-I'm sorry.<eos> Look at you. Look at you. All scrubbed and garnished, but you still ain't clean.<eos> No, no, no, you can't dig up the truth if you want to play the game.<eos> It's all lies.
You ever see anything like this?<eos> No.<eos> "Against the spirits of wickedness in high places."<eos> Touch my body. Taste it. "You will not surely die."<eos> Father Callahan?<eos> Father Callahan.<eos> What do you make of that?<eos> I believe that there are different levels of evil in the world.<eos> No rituals, no magic.<eos> It already dwells in all of us. That's it. That's the battle.
Dude, I am so sorry for being a homophone.<eos> Are we gonna talk about how weird you were today with Dickson?<eos> Look, I don't think the tattoo means what you think it means.<eos> I mean, for all we know, a lot of people could have that tattoo.<eos> This tattoo?<eos> This absurdly specific tattoo?<eos> Name one other person who has this.<eos> For starters, Zook has it.<eos> Zook has the tattoo?<eos> I think it's pretty popular.
Enough!<eos> Okay, that's all.<eos> Over and out.<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this.<eos> O'Hara, get Spencer in here right away.<eos> What are you guys doing down here?<eos> Lassie, relax.<eos> We have been requested by the assailant for a face-to-facer, okay?<eos> My face, Gus' face.<eos> We'd invite your face, but it wasn't requested.
What if Woody would have died, just now, because of that?<eos> Do I look like I'm playing?<eos> And Jules got me those sneaks.<eos> I'm gonna get in trouble.<eos> And I don't think Rocco is as re-assimilated as he pretends to be.<eos> Matter of fact... I think he's our killer.<eos> Tighten it up.<eos> Yeah, you can go on upstairs.<eos> My room is the first room upstairs on the left.<eos> It's the only one available.
- Yeah. - Make some room here. - Right.<eos> - Just calm down, kids.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Ma'am, keep your panties on. - Nina!<eos> - Nina. - Mr. Stevens.<eos> Brian Savage, Channel 9, 'Eyewitness News'.<eos> Mr Stevens, is it true the melee here tonight is the result of crime family rivalries?<eos> I'm Tina Johnson, investigative reporter with Channel 5 news.<eos> Mr Stevens, I would love to get an exclusive interview.<eos> I promise I will make it extremely worth your while.
You fucking Oompa-Loompa.<eos> You stole my story!<eos> Now there's going to be a quid pro quo.<eos> - That's live.<eos> - Everybody freeze!<eos> This is pretty.<eos> We're gonna need some backup.<eos> I'm gonna trust you with this. This is a Timex there.<eos> I'm gluten-free, so I can't...<eos> I can't have any bread unless it's, like, a rice flour.
Go ahead. Help yourselves.<eos> We'll take our most precious things with us.<eos> Put that down or I'll scratch your eyes out!<eos> Papakins! Do something!<eos> They took it all! Our jewels, our beds, too!<eos> It's the end, I want to die.<eos> Clotilde, please stop saying "Papakins" in front of these men.<eos> And you, Anne, stop talking of death.<eos> Oh, my heart!<eos> It's stopped beating.
Ignore what? A little bit of action? before a slow death in the country?<eos> It's better to keep a low profile.<eos> Don't you think?<eos> Belle?<eos> There, mother.<eos> We're starting a new life.<eos> And I'm ready now.<eos> Would she have liked a life in the country?<eos> She'd have loved it.<eos> Me, too. I'll love it.
It was your grandfather's.<eos> It was mine.<eos> And it was gonna be Chris', and now it's yours.<eos> Oh, it's too much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, I think pre-med at Brown earns it.<eos> Not to mention your internship with Dr. Fitzgerald.<eos> Internship?<eos> You never mentioned that.<eos> It's not a big deal, that's why.
Thank you.<eos> Well, I think pre-med at Brown earns it.<eos> Not to mention your internship with Dr. Fitzgerald.<eos> Internship?<eos> You never mentioned that.<eos> It's not a big deal, that's why.<eos> Very big deal.<eos> I mean, she'll be leaving and spending, I don't know, most of...<eos> Um, I, uh, had to declare my major, too.<eos> It's not as fancy as Jade's, but I had to major in something, so...
You will be when it creeps into your room at night.<eos> That's enough.<eos> You will be when it eats your insides!<eos> I've decided you're not having your birthday with Ruby this week.<eos> No cake, no games.<eos> That's the end of it.<eos> Samuel!<eos> Ladies and gentlemen! Mum and Dad!<eos> Life is not always as it seems.<eos> It can be a wondrous thing! But if can also be very treacherous.
How many six-year-old boys do you know, Robbie, who still believe in monsters?<eos> I hate you!<eos> She won't let me have a birthday party, and she won't let me have a dad!<eos> Don"r eat it.<eos> The Babadook did it, Mum.<eos> Go and watch a DVD, and I'll make something else.<eos> The Babadook did it!<eos> Just go and watch a DVD, Samuel.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, girls and boys, welcome to The Great Martin's DVD School of Magic.<eos> Life is not always as it seems.

- What's so funny?<eos> - No, it's not a trick, it's a gimmick. A gimmick we don't need.<eos> That day you lost me. Was it just a trick?<eos> Or maybe gimmick's a better word.<eos> One black, one white.<eos> I made him promise he'll never skate with anyone else.<eos> We were so good we didn't need anything like that to get attention.<eos> The promise was made.<eos> Was that promise kept?<eos> Nicole, just tell me what it was like.
This shall pass, Madame.<eos> You'll come to like it here.<eos> I imagined that this would be the happiest time in my life, but the calm here in which we live is not what I dreamt of.<eos> One after another, the days come, always the same, bringing nothing.<eos> Is this the will of God?<eos> Is my future just a dark corridor with a bolted door at the end?<eos> Always in a book, dear.<eos> You'll strain your eyes.<eos> This book is fascinating.<eos> It's about the Orient. Their manner of dress, the rituals, even their medicine.

No. yöu're the bird.<eos> - No, yöu're the bird.<eos> - yöu're the bird!<eos> We get it. yöu're both "the bird."<eos> Now, can we stop yakking and start partying?<eos> Wow!<eos> I remember this song.<eos> How could yöu forget?<eos> It's in our blood, baby.<eos> It's who we are.
Besides, our whole family couldn't possibly fit in yöur bachelor pad.<eos> Real estate must be pretty cheap around here.<eos> Wow.<eos> This is incredible.<eos> This old nest?<eos> It's just something I put together last minute.<eos> With my own two wings, of course.<eos> And my strength.<eos> And my brawn.<eos> Dad, it's huge!

yöu have to go with me!<eos> I will not put my family in danger again.<eos> Blu is my family, and I'm not leaving him behind.<eos> yöu don't have to.<eos> Are yöu okay?<eos> Look, Eduardo, I might not be the birdliest bird in the flock... but, for once, that's actually a good thing.<eos> yöu know the jungle... I know humans.<eos> And I know that, together, we can stop them.<eos> We can't let them take our home.<eos> Sure, it's hot and loud and filled with creepy bugs... but it's ours.
Don't be offended, gentlemen.<eos> Well, boys.<eos> What did he say?<eos> That the bathroom's upstairs.<eos> You smell that?<eos> Not that. The wood, it's centuries old.<eos> I love it.<eos> It makes me a little dizzy.<eos> You like the house at least...<eos> Sure, it's like a fairy tale.
This is better. It's Colombian. It has sunshine.<eos> No, I don't...<eos> It has sunshine!<eos> No, I don't want any.<eos> You're not worried about people smoking joints in a house full of guns?<eos> Can you imagine every Spaniard with a rifle?<eos> They keep their uniforms and rifles until they're 50.<eos> Their military service lasts a lifetime.<eos> - When are we going to your town?<eos> - It's near here, but...
No, I want you to tell him how not to make babies.<eos> It must be easy to buy condoms here.<eos> Of course it is...<eos> I have no idea, actually.<eos> I imagine... you can, but it might be hard.<eos> It's a very religious country. You know what religious countries are like.<eos> Why's he shouting? The beaches and restaurants are full and nobody had to emigrate.<eos> They all have their own car, television, refrigerator...<eos> Fine, they finance them, but they didn't have to emigrate.<eos> The Spanish miracle, they call it.
It must be easy to buy condoms here.<eos> Of course it is...<eos> I have no idea, actually.<eos> I imagine... you can, but it might be hard.<eos> It's a very religious country.

The beaches and restaurants are full and nobody had to emigrate.<eos> They all have their own car, television, refrigerator...<eos> Fine, they finance them, but they didn't have to emigrate.<eos> The Spanish miracle, they call it.<eos> And it really must be one.
They took it off her, put it in an orphanage.<eos> And you know what it's like to grow up in a place like that.<eos> Why did you call a consultant?<eos> Why didn't you telephone for the ambulance yourself?<eos> God love you.<eos> I called Dr. Mal because Chrissie wanted him.<eos> Sure she used to work up at the house too.<eos> Or do you not remember that either?<eos> What happened to the child?<eos> A little girl it was.
He told me that... he could get me into my grandmother's house for nothing and that I shouldn't be paying someone else's mortgage, and he didn't explain it to me, and I never understood it.<eos> And then a couple years later, the rates change entirely, and I... he didn't explain. Can I just... can I just cut across you for a moment, there?<eos> Listen, I am all ears, but you're gonna have to talk up a little bit, 'cause I am very deaf.<eos> This happens to be my good ear, but all I heard then was...<eos> So, just... whatever it was you just said, please, just a little louder. I can't quite hear it.<eos> I don't think I ever should have qualified for that loan, and Carl talked me into that loan.<eos> Can I ask your name?<eos> - Billy.<eos> - Okay, Billy.<eos> We are in the middle of a very tight fiscal knot, and it's squeezing, and you are right in the middle of it.
Cool water<eos> Old Dan and I with throats burned dry And souls that cry for water<eos> Cool, clear<eos> Water<eos> Keep on moving, Dan Don't you listen to him, Dan<eos> He's a devil, not a man<eos> He spreads the burning sand with water<eos> Dan, can you see that big green tree<eos> Where the water's running free<eos> And it's waiting there for me and you?

I'll know in an hour.<eos> Hey, thanks for dropping it off.<eos> And thank Ingram for me, please.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> First American car to win De Leon?<eos> Definitely.<eos> You don't even have an invite.<eos> Monarch is gonna want this car in the race.<eos> Nobody knows where the race is until you get the invite, so exactly where would you be driving off to?<eos> Well, on the low, we know it's in California, we just don't know where.
I got Dino Brewster, who just painted a huge bull's-eye on their ass. Man.<eos> Christmas came early, wing nuts.<eos> The thing you gotta understand is, racing is an art.<eos> Douchebag is out here, he wants to talk to you.<eos> Racing with passion...<eos> Dude, that's high art.<eos> Man, I can feel love and vengeance and smell motor oil all swirling together out there.<eos> We got supernatural Mustangs, we got personal vendettas.<eos> I have no idea where this is going.<eos> I just know I like it. I like it a lot!
I'd like to ask you a few more questions.<eos> If you'd step out to my cruiser, shouldn't take but a minute.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop right there!<eos> Tobey? He's following me.<eos> I know.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm upstairs. I'm in a room.<eos> All right, is there a window?<eos> It's on the second floor.
It's creepy, almost.<eos> Why would you think that?<eos> Well, it's just I think she seems like a lonely, jealous, and manipulative person.<eos> You know, I walked into the bridge the other night and...<eos> God, you wouldn't believe what she was doing.<eos> - What did she do?<eos> - Well...<eos> She stole some food.<eos> Yeah, I think she's got some real issues with food and...<eos> Gosh, I wasn't gonna... say anything, but actually, it was your special sundae.

You got something you wanna say, say it. I am ready to hear it.<eos> Ted, settle down.<eos> It's okay.<eos> She has a secret too.<eos> - Don't.<eos> - Misty.<eos> Why don't you tell everyone your secret.<eos> Look, let's not...<eos> Please, let's not play this game anymore.<eos> - It's not funny.
I do.<eos> I do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hey. Give me another one of these.<eos> This one's full of static.<eos> I also got that surveillance video you requested.<eos> Great. Set it up.<eos> Sign it outwith Smith.
Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Jen!<eos> Okay?<eos> I got a guy who beats his wife's face in, in front of their kid, and the next day he's back home.<eos> All right.<eos> I got a lady who throws her kid into a ravine.<eos> You want another one?<eos> Last week, an alleyway off Buck Street, first call of the night,<eos> I pull a baby out of the bottom of a dumpster.<eos> I'm giving it mouth-to-mouth.<eos> It's already dead.
Like a line in a poem.<eos> Thanks.<eos> It's your turn.<eos> Tell me one about me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Come on, slowpoke!<eos> No, I, um...<eos> I remember this one time... I think it was the spring because it was really muddy.<eos> I was running past your house, and I saw you in your bedroom window.<eos> Uh, at least I think it was your bedroom.
Can I have a Diet Coke and a packet of Scampi Fries, please?<eos> Well, you could if I wasn't closing.<eos> All right, Ron?<eos> Garrett.<eos> Well, what the hell happened to you?<eos> You look like shit. Charming.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> You got a customer complaints department here at, er, El Corazón?<eos> Oh, hang on, I'll get a form for you.<eos> There it is.
You made an inlay.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Nobody makes inlays anymore.<eos> Yeah, it's just a silly, little touch I thought you'd like.<eos> That's really... That's really nice.<eos> Now I feel like I have to get you something.<eos> That would be so cute.<eos> That's really nice. Thank you.<eos> - How was your bubble bath?<eos> - Was it rejuvenating?
Well, I love questions.<eos> So you like Latin music, huh?<eos> - The mix tape.<eos> - Oh, right, the mix, yes.<eos> Oh, I am a Latino boy big time, I am, music wise.<eos> Thanks for listening to that. It was a real labour of love for me.<eos> That track at the end of side one, oh...<eos> Oh, shoot, that's the...<eos> That's my favourite track.<eos> - Isn't it just so er... tracky?

Cameron's broken his arm.<eos> Duffy's been shot in the leg.<eos> After injury payments, we will net just under $8 per man.<eos> $8?<eos> The crew will not be happy.<eos> When are they ever?<eos> When their end is a hell of a lot richer than $8.<eos> Here, take a look.<eos> Captain's log.<eos> It's all there.
Within the week.<eos> Failing that... I'd kill you meself.<eos> Bruce... we're good for the money.<eos> Well, we will be.<eos> I just need a little bit more time.<eos> How much time?<eos> Couple of months.<eos> - You're taking the piss.<eos> Where's this money coming from in a few months?<eos> I can't tell you, but it is real, okay?
None of us do.<eos> Everyone in the world is suffering from multiple personalities.<eos> No one knows what their real face looks like anymore.<eos> - It's all fake.<eos> - I have to get out of here. No.<eos> And go where?<eos> Out there with the mundanes?<eos> They're all fakes, Suki. They're all photocopies.<eos> Sinclair tried to make you one of them by killing the best part of you.<eos> But he started something his machine can't stop 'cause it works for us now.
I'm not going back to the tower.<eos> You don't have anywhere else to go.<eos> - Who's Veronica Orr?<eos> - That is a confidential file, Suki.<eos> This is patient number 99. I heard you on the phone.<eos> - You lost her.<eos> - I didn't lose her.<eos> Give me the file.<eos> What, she was on the machine too?<eos> It was a different kind of machine. It didn't work.
I'm coming back for you, boy.<eos> I did this to you.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> Leave her alone.<eos> God made me this way, Hogan.<eos> I'm sure he knew what he was doing.<eos> They say you find out who you really are on the way down.<eos> But I've already seen it.<eos> The Scribbler's machine shows you everything.<eos> It wakes up parts of the brain that we never use.
Now breathe deeply.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Tired.<eos> That's natural.<eos> A caesarean can be difficult.<eos> You pulled through fine.<eos> A caesarean?<eos> doctor, is my baby okay?<eos> Your baby's fine.<eos> Is it a boy or a girl?
Now my information is that he's gonna try and kill you.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yeah. So what's his deal?<eos> Why does he want to have a clean slate now?<eos> Turn around.<eos> You should turn around just now.<eos> Chechnya.<eos> This ugly, dirty, little godforsaken country.<eos> Oil, however, lots of it.<eos> Filthy Chechen terrorists didn't want to give it to us.
I wouldn't give this up for the world!<eos> Malice is too caught up in her witches and demons to notice.<eos> I guess... One more time.<eos> One more time, huh?<eos> Do you give a fuck?<eos> God!<eos> Does she have to bring this Ouija board everywhere?<eos> Fuck!<eos> Malice!<eos> It's not what it looks like!
We're your friends, Skylar.<eos> Trust us.<eos> I just need time to get to know the fairy I'm about to induce my husband into.<eos> Fuck off bitch!<eos> You have, haven't you?<eos> Oh, so in love!<eos> And it broke your heart too...<eos> Even now, I can see your pain.<eos> The look on your face when you walked in on him, your love, sleeping with another.<eos> The way your heart sunk to depths you had only read about as it turned into stone,.
- Three.<eos> - From the devil himself. - (CHUCKLES)<eos> Then our enemies must beware.<eos> Come.<eos> Uncle.<eos> I'm glad you've come.<eos> Though we could have wished for better circumstances.<eos> I'm no stranger to your circumstances anymore.<eos> It will take more than a few mountain men to bring this house down.<eos> It's been in my family for three generations.
- Aren't we all?<eos> I'm sorry about before. My welcome was...<eos> Don't apologize for speaking your mind.<eos> What happened to you, Guy?<eos> Our happy young cousin, what has turned him so bitter?<eos> MARY: Something you got from a whore?<eos> Frenchman.<eos> It must have stung for a while.<eos> Not as much as the one I gave him.<eos> If you want a beer, it's in the keep.
Did you see his office?<eos> It's like he was never here, like that movie "The Vanishing."<eos> - I never saw it. - Someone vanishes.<eos> So, why'd they dump him?<eos> Was it 'cause of last night?<eos> I really can't say.<eos> That fight was insane.<eos> Have you seen the video?<eos> There's a video?<eos> It's on YouTube.
And then he leans over to me, and he just starts pouring the wine over my head.<eos> And I look down and I realize I'm-- I'm a little baby, and he's giving me a tubby.<eos> And there's something weird about the water. I put my hand in it and reach up, and it's just covered in blood.<eos> It's just a weird dream.<eos> I got to stop thinking about this guy.<eos> Just heard the doorbell ring while I was in the bathroom, and the delivery guy left this on my doorstep.<eos> There's no return address, so I have a good idea who it's from.<eos> - Hey.<eos> So, um, just to clear the air, I do want to apologize for that last video I sent you.<eos> It was a little manipulative and a bit of an emotional response and, um, I'm sorry about that.
I mean, besides that my family practically spoon fed me which is incredibly specialized, I don't know a thing about music.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - How did it go with your wife?<eos> - Very well.<eos> No, I'm kidding, it was horrible.<eos> You know... she's not the type to wear her heart on her sleeve. I think she was expecting it.. Did you tell her about me?<eos> No, I said, you know, I'd be going off on my own to write my book and wouldn't be back.<eos> - Then she must be suspecting something.<eos> - She has no idea you and I know each other.<eos> - Well, she will once it hits the tabloids.
Are we going the right way?<eos> I mean, I don't mind waking up at the crack of dawn, but not to get lost in the mountains and miss The Snake.<eos> Well, we're basically here, you happy?<eos> What makes you think we're here?<eos> I've got a map! You want me to show you?<eos> Come here.<eos> This is the bend we just went around, 10 minutes ago, and just around there is the view of the valley.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Pain in the ass! Jesus Christ!<eos> I don't know why you're so dead-set on making this play say the opposite of what it was meant to say.
Maybe because I'm working with her, but... as I was reading it, I... I kept thinking about Jo-Ann.<eos> Yeah, well, personally, I never think about Jo-Ann Ellis.<eos> You're wrong, she's smart, and talented.<eos> She's modern, just like your character.<eos> My character isn't modern, not in that way, anyway<eos> She's... outside of time.<eos> "Outside of time."<eos> I don't understand, it's too abstract for me, sorry.<eos> I don't like this era.<eos> - You're wrong, it's yours.
Sleep!<eos> And practice tomorrow at 9 sharp!<eos> Stubid!<eos> Mohini don't feel bad about Charlie's...<eos> Every girl wants to be loved, respected and treated well.<eos> It's nobody's childhood dream to be a dancer in a bar someday!<eos> If it wasn't for my family problems.. ...I too would have gone to an English school...<eos> But fate had other plans.<eos> Fate is a bloody fickle thing!<eos> It can change sides anytime.
Shite!<eos> You don't look around before you start talking do you?<eos> You heard what we are doing here..<eos> ...you don't want to know why we are doing it?<eos> Please, please give me a chance.<eos> And then I told Mohini dad's entire story.<eos> Tammy, Jag and their friendship,<eos> And Charan Grover their enmity.<eos> I lost everything in one day.. ...and learnt that fate is a fickle mistress,<eos> It can change sides anytime!
Very good. Keep the oxygen pipes ready..<eos> We are good to go.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have to make do with what I have, It's a floatation device!<eos> What's going on?<eos> It all looks fine.<eos> What the hell!<eos> It's a video loop.<eos> The water's rising, Charlie!<eos> It's rising... It's rising!
"We are risen, you'll never top us."<eos> "When we come together" "Fate is just a formality."<eos> How dare you?<eos> Leave me!<eos> The Winner of WDC by the Highest margin of votes is Team India!<eos> - Did I not tell you.. ...that there are just 2 kinds of people in the world.<eos> Winners and Losers.<eos> Our lives today, gave us losers this Saccharine moment, where we have won the hearts of the world and emerged victorious!<eos> And fate fate is a beautiful thing,<eos> and if you back your dreams with an iron resolve, it will change sides for you.
Here. Tow to.<eos> Oh.<eos> No, no.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> This is "Tattoo."<eos> I said, "tow to" as in "tow your car."<eos> This is a funny language miscommunication.<eos> I can't get out here because I don't have my money.<eos> It's in my purse, which is in my car.
There's two sides. Is this the side?<eos> You're on the wrong side. Oh. Okay, okay, great.<eos> $1 .50.<eos> You, blondie.<eos> Uh...<eos> Yes. Yes. $1 .50.<eos> Such a good, round number.<eos> Where's your money? Oh.<eos> It's... You know what? You can just keep going.<eos> It's here somewhere.
In fact, our men aren't even allowed to hear a woman sing.<eos> It's just bus fare.<eos> That's really all I need.<eos> No one will know. There's no one here.<eos> Okay. Look, of all the prohibitions, I Iove the female voice mixing in the wind.<eos> The lilt. The sweetness.<eos> Now, I know I cannot touch.<eos> But cannot my ears touch?<eos> A small price of $1 .50 would eagerly be paid for such a delight.<eos> Forbidden, though it is.
My Luke was 3 when we moved here.<eos> And how many years ago is that?<eos> - Thirty-two.<eos> - Our children will love it here, Oren.<eos> We will love your home for you.<eos> We're nearly done here.<eos> You will always be welcomed back.<eos> The next song has a very special meaning to me.<eos> When I was 17 and... I love this song.<eos> It was playin9... when I realized I was in love first time in my life.
So I notice the crying has got back into the act.<eos> Well at least I almost got through the song.<eos> I thought you were going to leave without saying goodbye.<eos> Well, I did try, but it didn't feel right.<eos> - How human you're becoming, Oren.<eos> - Not as human as you might think.<eos> I had no problem with the not saying good-bye part. You know, but a few miles outside of town... I discovered that I had a big problem with the leaving part.<eos> - Why might that be?<eos> - I think you got some idea.<eos> If it's what I think it is, you're gonna have to say it.
- You hear me? - Sit down, everyone sit.<eos> Now our Captain's right.<eos> As hard as it may be... we all need to stay calm.<eos> No, no, I've lost everything I've ever worked for.<eos> - We're on fire.<eos> - Where?<eos> The wing. This side.<eos> Is the wing on fire or is the spray on fire?<eos> The spray. It's big.<eos> We're flying in front ofit. It'll burn off.
I can't get it.<eos> I'm going up!<eos> I can't get the shot!<eos> Mac, I can't get the shot.<eos> Come on, motherfucker, lock!<eos> Mac!<eos> What the fucking shit?<eos> Strap it up.<eos> I had never been more scared in my entire life When we brought that thing back to the base.<eos> Think it knows where North is?
What the fucking shit?<eos> Strap it up.<eos> I had never been more scared in my entire life When we brought that thing back to the base.<eos> Think it knows where North is?<eos> Bet your ass it does. Can't we wake it up<eos> And make it tell us?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> I told you not to go off this base!<eos> This is my responsibility<eos> It was chasing Saleem, and we had to go after him.
Oh, shit, I'm sorry.<eos> - I forgot I had this in there.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - It's... listen.<eos> - Oh, my God!<eos> Overwhelming force. If it works for the U.S. Army, it's going to fucking work for us.<eos> Now please, I need your help because I have no idea how to use this thing.<eos> Don't bring it in here.<eos> You're better with mechanics than me.<eos> - I think I fucking broke it. - You turn it to the left.
Should've stayed in a hotel.<eos> Watch it!<eos> It's Grandma's favorite lamp.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Not Grandma's favorite lamp.<eos> Yeah, see?<eos> Now you got the haints angry.<eos> That's just the house settling.<eos> The house has been here for 150 years.<eos> Don't you think it's already settled?
Get the smell of pirates off me.<eos> That was what I was thinking. You said it, Ro.<eos> Here, please, take this back to Pixie Hollow.<eos> Zarina, we didn't just come for the dust.<eos> Ro?<eos> There's something you should know.<eos> It's about your hair.<eos> First, I lose my talent, then I become a mother. I do-si-doed in a stinky shoe, and now, my hair?<eos> Hang on, guys!<eos> Hey! There it is.
In fact, people call me the Cat Whisperer.<eos> Hi there, kitty.<eos> Spanky here will escort Princess Flufferina to the spa.<eos> Bye, Alfalfa.<eos> Bye.<eos> Come on, Romeo, time to make some moolah.<eos> How's the grooming going, Mary Ann?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Pretty good.<eos> It took a while because he kept trying to hide in his shell, but look at that smile now.
- Uh, structurally.<eos> - Structurally.<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah. Structurally.<eos> Did you like that part where she looks in the mirror and she sees herself as an old woman?<eos> Honestly, I found that a little heavy-handed.<eos> (CLICKS TONGUE) So did I. Which is why I didn't write it.<eos> You didn't read my screenplay, did you?<eos> No. But I didn't read anyone's screenplay, don't take it personally.<eos> It's entirely personal.
- Please, call me Keith.<eos> Sorry, my youngest was throwing up all night.<eos> - Oh, had she been drinking? - (LAUGHS)<eos> She's nine.<eos> But maybe, I'm a really permissive mother.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Well, by thanking me for reading your script.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You want to test me?<eos> It is called Local Girl, and it is about a perky Binghamton lass called Peggy, who dreams big dreams about being a dancer and is attracted to the wrong boys and her father is a police officer and her mother is a beautician and opera singer.

So, what did you think?<eos> I think that your characters are quite interesting, but that it's a little randomly structured.
(♪ FUNKY MUSIC ON STEREO) (HOLLY SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)<eos> (GIRLS LAUGHING)<eos> - Yes, hello, Ellen.<eos> - Hey. - Got the outline.<eos> Looks good.<eos> - Excellent.<eos> I think even an agent of your calibre should be able to sell it.<eos> And, I have a script I'd like you to take a look at by a young man in my class.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> It's called Veronica, Out of Time and it's about a kick-ass girl who gets sucked into a time machine and has to fight her way back through various periods of history.
Back from New York, where if you don't know already.<eos> Clem has just sold his first script to Hollywood.<eos> (ALL MURMURING HAPPILY)<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Your writing's brilliant.<eos> I would also like to say that today we will be taking a look at some new and truly exciting pages from Karen Gabney.<eos> With regard to my premature departure from our last class, uh...<eos> I'm sorry. The truth is, um... Somewhat complicated.<eos> Well it's my third act, I suppose, and I will let you see it when I have finished my teacher script. And I will want your complete and honest opinions.<eos> Though I will vastly prefer the people who love it. (ALL LAUGH)
Hello?<eos> Hello? No, I don't-I don't know where we are.<eos> Can you send-can you track this phone or something?<eos> Is there some way that you can do that? Hello?<eos> What happened?<eos> Oh, what just happened?<eos> Corey?<eos> Shit.<eos> - Shit!<eos> - It's not turning?
You notice how that camera gets to be jumping when them things is around?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That happens again, you gimme a holler.<eos> OK.<eos> OK.<eos> Now get your ass out my seat.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm trying to figure out how this damn radio works.<eos> Sean says it doesn't work.
Don't be such a child!<eos> Sorry, Mal.<eos> -Dr. Quirke, can I have a second?<eos> -What is it?<eos> Deirdre Hunt's toxicology is exactly the same as the Millican case.<eos> No puncture wounds, but there was still small amounts of tablets dissolved in the stomach.<eos> Same compound as we found in Geraldine Millican?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> -No heroin?<eos> -No, there was heroin all right. Not exactly the same compound but so similar it must be...
But now another woman has died with the same stuff in her system.<eos> You have to tell the police whatever it is that you know.<eos> A few months ago, I received a photograph through the post.<eos> A photograph?<eos> A photograph... ..of my wife.<eos> -And what kind of photograph?<eos> -Come on, Dr. Quirke, don't make me spell it out for you.<eos> Blackmail?<eos> I have a position in this city.<eos> I couldn't allow that photograph to reach the newspapers, not that they could print such a thing, but they could be very clear what sort of a photograph it was.
-I was going to do it. Sure no-one tells me anything.<eos> And tell someone to clean up in here.<eos> Phoebe!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They always start late on opening nights.<eos> There's Jimmy.<eos> Ahoy my hearties!<eos> Looking good. Isabel looks so beautiful.<eos> Sure that picture's ten years old.<eos> What are you talking about it, it's for this show!
I'm not checking up on you!<eos> Do you not think I might just like seeing you from time to time?<eos> Not really, no.<eos> I was going to ask you to come to the Society of Corpus Christi dinner with me.<eos> No, listen, there's no mass or prayers or anything.<eos> It's a charity bash.<eos> Few dances, few speeches, we'll have a laugh.<eos> Sarah and I went every year.<eos> I just... ..don't want to go on my own.<eos> It's usually crawling with spinsters and widows.
This is me.<eos> Why don't you come in?<eos> You can take off your coat, you know.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> Just what?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maybe we're a little drunker than I thought.<eos> Well, I better... I better get going.<eos> I don't want to give you the wrong idea.<eos> Why don't we both... get the wrong idea and... ..see where it leads us?
in which he says the following:<eos> "Because there is a law such as gravity, the universe can and will create itself from nothing."<eos> And to be honest, I didn't know how to refute that.<eos> I mean, after all, Hawking is clearly a genius.<eos> But, Professor John Lennox, who teaches mathematics and philosophy has demonstrated that there are not one, even two, but three errors of logic contained in that one simple sentence, and it all boils down to circular reasoning.<eos> Hawking is basically saying that the universe exists because the universe needed to exist, and because the universe needed to exist, it therefore created itself.<eos> It's like this.<eos> If I say to you that I can prove that Spam is the best-tasting food that's ever existed because in all of history, no food has ever tasted better, you'd probably look at me strange and say I haven't proven anything.<eos> And you'd be right, all I've done is restate my original claim.<eos> But when Hawking claims that the universe created itself because it needed to create itself, and then offers that as an explanation as to how and why it was created, we don't immediately recognize that he's doing the same thing.
So, after all your talk, you're saying that it all comes down to choice: believe or don't believe.<eos> That's right, that's all there is.<eos> That's all there's ever been.<eos> The only difference between your position and my position is that you take away their choice.<eos> You demand that they choose the box marked, "I don't believe."<eos> (Professor Radisson) Yes, because I want to free them.<eos> Because religion is like a-- it's like a mind virus that parents have passed on down to their children, and Christianity is the worst virus of all.<eos> It slowly creeps into our lives when we're weak or sick or helpless.<eos> So, religion is like a disease? (Professor Radisson) Yes.<eos> Yes, it infects everything. It's the enemy of reason.
The creams, the waxes, the lotions.<eos> I don't have the money.<eos> Fucking Foy!<eos> Hey, Albert, maybe we should just go to church.<eos> It'll make you feel a lot better.<eos> Church is not gonna...<eos> Oh, hey, look!<eos> It's the ice!<eos> Why is it so big?<eos> So it doesn't melt.
Please.<eos> The tunnelling larvae of Xestobium rufovillosum are a severe pest in both buildings and in the timber trade.<eos> Their trail of devastation isn't as patterned as species from the Scolytidae family.<eos> Their galleries and tunnels deep within the wood are distinctive to each species.<eos> Xestobium rufovillosum favours oak, whether living or felled.<eos> 'Although seldom seen, its presence is often felt 'by the sinister tapping sound it makes 'to attract a mate during the spring.'<eos> Wait! Wait!<eos> Now, my love.<eos> A small birthday treat for you.<eos> All I can say is I hope you like it as much as I do.
Call 911, now, right now! Do it!<eos> I gotta warn Kylie.<eos> (phone buzzing)<eos> Shit!<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> - (dispatcher): 911, what'syouremergency?<eos> - Hi, um, I don't really know how to explain...<eos> So I'm on this website called Girlhouse.<eos> - "Girlhouse"?<eos> - It's a pornographic website.
Always!<eos> An Imperial Affliction.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm so glad that you liked it.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> But the ending.<eos> I know. It is rather abrupt.<eos> "Rather abrupt"?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's evil!
Get away from her, you bitch!<eos> Look at this, Hazel.<eos> This is so crazy.<eos> Look at the stained glass.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> Oh, I'm gonna check us in.<eos> We better get you dressed... because you have reservations for two tonight, - for dinner at Oranjee. - Oh.<eos> And it says, "Enjoy.<eos> Mr. Peter Van Houten."<eos> So, I looked it up and it sounds amazing.
Think of all the beauty in everything around you... and be happy.<eos> I fell in love with him the way you fall asleep.<eos> Slowly, and then all at once.<eos> it just sort of ends right above where the knee would be... and tapers off.<eos> What?<eos> My leg.<eos> You know, just so you're prepared.<eos> Gus... get over yourself.<eos> Wait.<eos> I can't, it's stuck.
Dad, what's going on?<eos> I'm sort of set up to track your phone.<eos> You're sort of set up to track my phone? You track my phone?<eos> Yeah, I'm your dad.<eos> I'm looking out for you.<eos> No.<eos> No. Hold up.<eos> "Spying on" is not the same thing as just looking out for someone.<eos> You'll get it back, I promise.<eos> But right now, it's going on the monkey's back.
It needs moonlight... otherwise we shall all be dead by sunrise.<eos> Hurry!<eos> If the tablet dies... nothing can bring it back!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> The tablet.<eos> Wait, listen to me.<eos> That thing is dying.<eos> If it doesn't get moonlight... everything ends, like, for real.<eos> King Arthur wasted years searching for the Holy Grail.<eos> To think it was a tablet all along.
Family's thinking "What in the hell?"<eos> and your boys talking up here keep lathering the tale.<eos> You know, sounds like one hell of a fight between you two.<eos> Who knows what to believe?<eos> If I'd set to do something to Ernest Holm, it wouldn't amount to concussion, and that's the god damned "talk talk" as you put it.<eos> Now what do you want?<eos> Water.<eos> And what in the hell are you going to do with that?<eos> The land is sick.<eos> No it's not.
The water line to St. Walstan.<eos> I'll see what I can do.<eos> Pray for rain.<eos> That shit'll put me out of business.<eos> Blue skies, dry breeze. Out of the dusty earth.<eos> The things that we have complained about for their brutal consistency can now be seen as good graces and fair working conditions.<eos> In a few moments, this tributary will distribute its life sustaining gifts on this small piece of land.<eos> I raise these scissors in thanks to the state water works. Who thankfully reversed their decision to run an irriduct to st. Walstan.<eos> It's been a long time since we've seen such an act of peace and brotherhood around here. For this, we are sincerely grateful.<eos> Let us say a prayer. That this piece of land, small as it may be, can be more than a symbol.

It's so beautiful.<eos> It's almost a shame to harvest it.<eos> What'd your father say about all this?<eos> Probably wouldn't say anything.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But he'd probably be thinking you're alright.<eos> Really?<eos> Flem, you ride on back. I'll see you when we're through.<eos> Why are you talking about my land?<eos> It's not your land, boy.

I'll see you when we're through.<eos> Why are you talking about my land?<eos> It's not your land, boy.<eos> My wife, my land.<eos> Not her land neither. It belongs to the bank.
Sorry about that doctor. Just a local boy. Very passionate about the history of these plots.<eos> Flem?<eos> Hey, let me help you.<eos> What?<eos> I said let me help.<eos> - Don't worry. I got it.<eos> Where are you taking the machine?<eos> I need to go to the mountains.<eos> Come on. I found somebody to tell us what it's worth.<eos> Flem and Mary are going to sell their baby when it's born.
Flem and Mary are going to sell their baby when it's born.<eos> They need our help to find out what they can get for it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wrap the baby in a blanket and hurry back.<eos> He keeps changing his mind, but he said yes.<eos> It's too late for second thoughts.<eos> I've already got a buyer lined up.<eos> Send him out here.<eos> Why'd they give you that money?<eos> I thought we were just here to find out what it was worth.
Did you have fun?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Come on.<eos> Are you sure you can drive?<eos> - Move in.<eos> I love you.<eos> - And I love you.<eos> Do you have my lighter?<eos> - Oh, here.<eos> Do you know where it is?
As there are no comments, we'll sign now.<eos> Ms Portal, your initials at the bottom of each page, please.<eos> If I'd known that signature would turn my life upside down, would I have signed?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> There. We'll manage.<eos> Thanks.<eos> But did I have any choice?<eos> This house means so much to me.<eos> It represents my family, my roots.
Who wants a taste?<eos> We can get the money.<eos> I can sell the house.<eos> The house?<eos> I'm not leaving here.<eos> I'm so attached to this place.<eos> You know that.<eos> That's why you want to sell?<eos> Makes sense.<eos> Know what it costs?
- Yes.<eos> - So what do we do?<eos> No idea.<eos> Call the police, the undertaker.<eos> You see them as intruders, but they're family.<eos> But they're dead!<eos> Corpses, in our home!<eos> No, it isn't our home.<eos> But they're at home.<eos> It's their house.
Help yourself.<eos> Here in Oran, does not feel both events.<eos> It is central Algiers, it will bomb, shootings.<eos> - And his son?<eos> - I'm happy with it.<eos> He said he will present his collection at Maison Prome.<eos> But not surprised he was hired by Dior. He always wanted that.<eos> With such a stylish mom.<eos> Do you like my dress?<eos> Yes, it's beautiful.
Santa, how will your business?<eos> They are closed.<eos> I closed it, I'm not so good at business.<eos> I'm at the beach, for me is enough.<eos> - Do you miss Algeria?<eos> - I do.<eos> I have not yet thanked you for the car.<eos> - What car?<eos> - The one you gave me.<eos> It's a Fiat.

What could you possibly want me for?<eos> This is the most valuable piece of technology this country has ever created.<eos> I want you to protect it for us.<eos> You can't be serious.<eos> You think protecting the president is more important than this?<eos> Respectfully, ma'am, it is more important.<eos> Funny.<eos> He didn't think so.<eos> Didn't work with the last one.<eos> It won't work now.
Gabriel.<eos> I'm so glad you're here.<eos> Now I know we're gonna find him. What was in the safe?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Nothing. Just dad's laptop.<eos> The computer was in the safe?<eos> Yeah. He was real paranoid about his memoirs.<eos> He's been dictating them for months.<eos> He said it was easier to talk to a cat, so I made the recorder voice-activated, even had it auto-upload to his laptop.<eos> That's why it was sending out the signal Gabriel picked up.

You don't have that chip.<eos> I will shortly.<eos> What am I doing in a safe house? I'm pulling you out.<eos> You're what? !<eos> In the last 24 hours, you almost got yourself killed twice.<eos> That's the job.<eos> The F-35's the most expensive airplane ever built.<eos> The first thing they did was throw it in a war zone.<eos> This thing in my head may be valuable, but you don't want it sitting in a hangar.<eos> I also don't want it getting lost in some dangle-op gone wrong.
Oh, my boy, they told me you were dead.<eos> Glad to see you're still ticking, too, doc.<eos> Doctor, you know what you must do now.<eos> Refuse, and I will dig the chip out of his dead skull myself.<eos> You call this a sterile field?<eos> I don't think they're worried about infection.<eos> All right, be careful.<eos> You don't have to hurt him.<eos> I'm gonna be giving you some midazolam.<eos> It will relax you before the anesthesia.
Do it, Norman.<eos> Do it, Norman.<eos> Do your job.<eos> Come on, Norman.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Is this supposed to make a man out of me?<eos> Is this supposed to make a man out of me?<eos> 'Cause my conscience is...<eos> Sit down.<eos> It's clean.
Simon, have you always been as unhappy as you are now?<eos> I thought it was Joseph, but it's Simon...<eos> Have you always been as unhappy as you are now?<eos> Eeeee!<eos> Is that it?<eos> Is that the end of the game?<eos> - Boo!<eos> - What the fuck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> It was just a game.
- Oh, Mickey!<eos> Sorry, I just wanted to show Granddad the badger in the revolving doors and the nun with two heads.<eos> Nobody wants to see a nun with two heads. - I do.<eos> - That computer's not for kids.<eos> All the terminals are connected.<eos> It's a... - Synergised system.<eos> - That's right.<eos> You know, the whole house is virtually wireless.<eos> It's, well, more than an iCloud, it's... iFog?<eos> It's an intelligent house.
- Cos it can fit through a hole.<eos> It's intelligent in a way...<eos> - Can it draw a leopard?<eos> - What?<eos> And can it do cartwheels?<eos> If this house is more intelligent than you...<eos> - Mickey.<eos> - This system cost a lot of money.<eos> Well, it doesn't always mean it's intelligent if...<eos> - It cost loads of money.
- What?<eos> And can it do cartwheels?<eos> If this house is more intelligent than you...<eos> - Mickey.<eos> - This system cost a lot of money.<eos> Well, it doesn't always mean it's intelligent if...<eos> - It cost loads of money.<eos> - Yeah. You're not explaining it at all well.<eos> I think we should take you to the headmaster of your place - because...<eos> - It's an intelligent house, OK?
Granddad's Viking brooch.<eos> We put it on the raft.<eos> All Vikings went to Valhalla with their treasure.<eos> You morons!<eos> Well, that's just rude.<eos> You, stupid, stupid little...<eos> - Whoa, whoa, enough!<eos> - They've destroyed a family heirloom.<eos> - Dad found it.<eos> - It's worth £15,000.
Well, that's Meryl Streep.<eos> What?<eos> You think she's too what?<eos> I think she's too much of what a man thinks a woman is, what he wants her to be.<eos> Well, if she loves him, does it make her a whore?<eos> Was Anna Karenina a whore because she gave her heart, her life to Vronsky?<eos> "Anna Karenina"-- you heard of this book?<eos> Yeah, I heard of it. I never had the pleasure.<eos> Is that how you see me, what I am to you?<eos> A whore? No, it's a movie, Nina.
[ Gasps ] Why didn't you stay with your brother?<eos> I just wanted to get my face painted.<eos> Guys! Come on.<eos> It's getting late.<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Are you guys okay?<eos> - Yeah, yeah. Just-- just been looking for you, that's all.<eos> There's nothing in the operational report, just routine surveillance, but there's an address in Virginia two hours south of the naval base and these sketches.<eos> Looks like a propeller, machine tool, something.<eos> Well, whatever it is, Emmett and Leanne were in a hell of a hurry to get it.
How dare you steal our dough?<eos> - Shut up.<eos> - No way. Piss off!<eos> Get in!<eos> Yvon...<eos> I saw some maniac tear off.<eos> What happened?<eos> I'II get the water.<eos> Sir...<eos> Pour it over his head.
Are you a Jehovah's Witness?<eos> No.<eos> Sorry, they usually come about now.<eos> Hello, I'm Sandra.<eos> I work with Julien at Solwal.<eos> Could I have a word with him?<eos> He's not here. He's at the café opposite the church.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> He's in the café but it's packed.
What about Chris and the others?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They'll be done before you know it.<eos> Haven't got time for this.<eos> REPORTER (VOICEOVER): Detective, come on.<eos> It seems to be quite obvious that with every minute those hostages are in there, including Miss Holden, and with the SAS seemingly involved, isn't it true that you've lost control of the situation?<eos> Listen, I can categorically assure you we have everything under control.<eos> How's our home movie doing?<eos> It's just completed.<eos> Well, let's get it into the hands it needs to be in.

Perhaps you'll slip and fall and that knee of yours will finally give out.<eos> Perhaps-- perhaps.<eos> Perhaps no one will say anything.<eos> Of course, they respect you too much for that.<eos> But the moment the Urca looms close and the first shot is fired in anger, you know exactly what every last man in that crew will be thinking.<eos> Christ Almighty, I wish we had a captain 30 years younger.<eos> What did we spend on stores?<eos> Too much, sir.<eos> We're bleeding money.<eos> Just tell me how much it was.
My father doesn't know about this.<eos> I see.<eos> But you have my word these terms shall be honored.<eos> Perhaps it would be wise to revisit our terms to account for this added risk.<eos> - No one's revisiting shit.<eos> - We had a fucking deal.<eos> I've heard enough.<eos> The terms are fine.<eos> Her word's good enough for me.<eos> And it's good enough for you, too.
It looks like she just gave us a ship.<eos> A ship with no captain.<eos> Billy.<eos> Is my watch up?<eos> So, what now?<eos> You here to threaten me?<eos> What the captain wants to accomplish here, our survival hangs in the balance.<eos> And I need to know we're all pulling in the same direction.<eos> I've got a right to think what I think.<eos> Well, then say it.
No, no!<eos> Please, please, please, please.<eos> Where's Claire?<eos> Pressure's dropping. He's bleeding out!<eos> No pressure!<eos> We're losing her!<eos> Mike... how's Claire?<eos> _<eos> A new book hits stands this week.<eos> It's called "The Havenport Tragedy, The True Story Of Joe Carroll And His Blood Cult"
by author Carrie Cook.<eos> This week, marks the anniversary of Joe Carroll's death, and Carrie Cook is actually gonna be joining us later to talk about his murderous cult that left a trail of blood and mayhem across the East Coast and rocked the nation.<eos> Some scary stuff. Can you believe it's been a year? Stay with--<eos> When I got here, I'd made so many wrong turns, felt empty, dead inside.<eos> You guys brought me back to life.<eos> You showed me that my past is exactly that.<eos> I have a life today.<eos> Is it better?<eos> Sometimes.<eos> It's different, and then there are moments when I get little glimpses of hope.
- Ooh. And everything looks really good.<eos> Honeymoon baby.<eos> The pill is about 99 percent effective, but, occasionally, this happens.<eos> Okay.<eos> - She winked at me.<eos> - I saw that.<eos> Because I got good sperm.<eos> - This is what you started.<eos> - What?<eos> It's good, strong sperm.
Hey, that's not the house.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> And the grand finale, your room.<eos> Formerly known as your mother's office.<eos> But now we are converting.<eos> - Thank you for giving up your office.<eos> - Jeez.<eos> - Watch it, there.<eos> I study on the couch all the time, anyway, so it's not a big deal.<eos> It's a pretty good room, though.
It's gonna look way better.<eos> You're doing a great job. I'm very proud of you.<eos> - Well, here's the crib. - Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Oh, wow.<eos> That looks really good.<eos> Yeah, we got it at the antique place and then I brought it home... and sanded it down and refinished it and stuff.<eos> Made it baby-safe.<eos> - I know you're big on baby safety.<eos> - Yeah, it looks great.
- Let's go crazy.<eos> - Yeah, let's go nuts. Ooh!<eos> Do you want to practice a little diapering?<eos> Get a little wrap around this guy?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - You don't want to do that?<eos> He's not even in a box. He's clearly dirty.<eos> Yeah, where'd this baby come from?<eos> I don't know you, baby.<eos> You bent him over, looked at his ass to see where it came from.
Excuse me.<eos> Is she gonna be back anytime soon?<eos> She filled me in, and I've studied your file.<eos> Well, will she be back by the time we deliver?<eos> Yeah, can we talk to her?<eos> I don't think she's gonna be able to come back.<eos> Let's talk about your symptoms.<eos> Okay.<eos> The baby looks healthy.<eos> But it's turned around.

- Sorry.<eos> I think that's the nicest procession I've ever seen.<eos> Boys and girls, we are so proud of you.<eos> And we are so happy... to have you here this morning on this big important day in your lives.<eos> Newest members of our church to gather round for the Liturgy of the Eucharist.<eos> We are here to celebrate with you today your first Holy Communion.<eos> Also, the first time... you receive our Lord Jesus Christ into your souls.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Uh, this sacrament...<eos> It is a sacrament...
You'll pay 500, then sell it for 300.<eos> I'll catch you a young, sturdy one.<eos> He'll be your friend for life.<eos> Isn't that perfect?<eos> - The colour?<eos> - You can choose. There's a choice.<eos> Just let me check its hooves to make sure it's sturdy.<eos> Two years ago, I caught a horse.<eos> I entered it in the Jockey Club endurance race.<eos> It won the 80km event.

But if you defend yourself, you may not die.<eos> Isn't that worth it?<eos> Trust me, it isn't.<eos> Let's drop it.<eos> I feel depressed already.<eos> What do you think, Nihal?<eos> To be honest... I don't quite grasp it.<eos> Where does this need come from?<eos> Why do you feel like this?<eos> It's not a need, just an idea.
Really? What are you writing?<eos> My experiences.<eos> Like a travel journal?<eos> There are travel notes as well.<eos> Let's call them essays.<eos> Soon to be published as a book. Really?<eos> That's good.<eos> I'm writing a book, too.<eos> Really?<eos> It will be a serious, thick book.
And I am proud to say I never did any soap operas.<eos> Despite some very attractive offers.<eos> I remember something Omar Sharif told me.<eos> When we met, he learned I was an actor. He gave me this look and said,<eos> "Acting is all about honesty."<eos> It really is.<eos> Awesome.<eos> - By the way, we got a horse.<eos> - Really? Can I ride it now?<eos> Not yet. It has to settle in a few days.
- Thanks.<eos> I was expecting Levent.<eos> So I thought it was him.<eos> But with Levent, you never know whether he'll come.<eos> We meet every Saturday afternoon. To go hunting the morning after.<eos> You know. Two bachelors. We lean on each other like walking sticks.<eos> Suavi, can I stretch my leg out?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> - I got cramp.<eos> Put it up higher. That's it.
- Go ahead.<eos> - I got cramp.<eos> Put it up higher. That's it.<eos> How nice.<eos> Nice and warm.<eos> Comfy couches.<eos> You must be cold.<eos> Wait, I've got just the thing.<eos> One sip of this, and the cold will disappear.<eos> Let's see if you like it.
- Yeah.<eos> It is there, your shirt, too.<eos> - Look. I tell you buttons.<eos> - Well then, is that one, there.<eos> You do not know to look, eh?<eos> - Where's the gift of Julien?<eos> I laugh more. Where is he?<eos> - Maw not. I know.<eos> - He was there.<eos> - But what is it?
- There's no cross on Johnny.<eos> - Johnny does not interest me.<eos> There are clothes, An English fabric jacket, two coats, A light summer jacket and another padded one.<eos> Business is with Mrs. Winter.<eos> Beautiful stuffs.<eos> Size 38, will it go?<eos> When are you going to Palestine?<eos> I do not know yet.<eos> Here is the bathroom, Fully equipped.<eos> And it works.
She's hacked another ship into our mission, this ship.<eos> We are here because Kaida wanted to go home early.<eos> That does not matter now.<eos> - - I think it does.<eos> - - We need to get back to the shuttle.<eos> I talked to him.<eos> Who?<eos> I reached an agreement with the security system.<eos> It's gonna release the shuttle to me.<eos> It's not gonna let you go.
What are you doing?<eos> My code shuts down the security processes, so we can destroy the Bioware.<eos> - Are you uploading the tag?<eos> - - Plus some code of my own.<eos> It's not a flatline.<eos> But she'll be rogue and she'll have teeth!<eos> There's only one of her.<eos> This thing has demons running throughout the system.<eos> 7 control processors. The key is the Bioware!<eos> - - If we don't get to that, it will keep respawning.
yöu should only wear this.<eos> VERONICA:<eos> Neither have I.<eos> That one.<eos> LOGAN:<eos> Really?<eos> Not what I was expecting.<eos> Not the big house.<eos> It's Unit B according to county tax records.<eos> My guess is, it's the garage apartment out back.
I had to use one of the old bugs that uses FM signals.<eos> Bandwidth at the end of the dial no one uses, 88.6.<eos> As in "88.6 Rock Hard Rock?"<eos> Tell me yöu're joking.<eos> - Neptune's new classic rock station.<eos> - All right. Probably okay.<eos> The bug only transmits a hundred yards or so.<eos> I should be able to get away with it.<eos> Was Carrie's tablet one of the big ones or the little ones?<eos> No, it was a little white one.
Yum-yum.<eos> He was unaware of her age. He met her only once before the letters began.<eos> When he discovered the truth, he stopped immediately.<eos> Those are the facts.<eos> Facts are for history books.<eos> I work in news.<eos> Your hand is sweating.<eos> Always, I'm afraid.<eos> I have a condition.<eos> It's disgusting.
God, no. One of his rivals.<eos> He was spitting.<eos> Sherlock Holmes, you are a back-stabbing, heartless, manipulative bastard.<eos> And you, as it turns out, are a grasping, opportunistic, publicity-hungry, tabloid whore.<eos> So, we're good then?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Where's the cottage?<eos> Sussex Downs.<eos> Nice.<eos> It's gorgeous.
It was Mycroft.<eos> I have, by the way, a job offer I should like you to decline.<eos> I decline your kind offer.<eos> I shall pass on your regrets.<eos> What was it? MI6.<eos> They want to place you back into Eastern Europe.<eos> An undercover assignment that would prove fatal to you in,<eos> I think, about six months.<eos> Then why don't you want me to take it?<eos> It's tempting, but on balance, you have more utility closer to home. Utility!
Don't fire!<eos> Do not fire on Sherlock Holmes!<eos> Do not fire!<eos> Oh Christ, Sherlock!<eos> Give my love to Mary.<eos> Tell her she's safe now.<eos> Oh, Sherlock.<eos> What have you done?<eos> As my colleague is fond of remarking, this country sometimes needs a blunt instrument.<eos> Equally, it sometimes needs a dagger, a scalpel wielded with precision and without remorse.
Play nice with others?<eos> May... Maybe. Yeah.<eos> Can you take a note without getting defensive?<eos> Possibly.<eos> Can you work with actors without fucking them<eos> - or punching them?<eos> - Oh, so you have read my work.<eos> Yeah, I've read your work.<eos> I like your work.<eos> It actually reminds me of some of the shit I used to write.
Pain in the arse this year!<eos> What is this?<eos> It's for the mice.<eos> What did I say?<eos> Don't use this stuff! Never, Gemma. Never!<eos> But it's the chemist in Rouen...<eos> The chemist is an idiot!<eos> It's nasty stuff!<eos> I can't stand them anymore!<eos> What it does is awful!
This is the greatest moment in gay history!<eos> ...are probably shocked by what you're saying right now.<eos> I'm more shocked that people haven't figured it out yet.<eos> I mean, it's kind of like I've been playing gay peekaboo.<eos> Gay peekaboo.<eos> Yeah. But, um...<eos> Shit.<eos> Camera one.<eos> Camera one. - This interview is over.<eos> - Shut it off.
Dave Skylark never backs down from a jerk-off.<eos> In three days, you will fly from New York to Beijing, where you will transfer to a commercial airline that takes you directly to Pyongyang.<eos> I'm sorry, this is completely unrelated, but, um, what happened to your glasses?<eos> Oh, I... I got LASIK.<eos> Between the time I saw you and now?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Now, our intelligence suggests that you will be taken here, to Kim Jong-un's personal compound.<eos> So, preceding the interview, you are going to shake Kim's hand, administering a fatal dose of poison with this, a transdermal time-delayed ricin strip.<eos> When you shake his hand, the poison will be absorbed into his skin, where it metabolizes for a 12-hour period.
- It's very offensive, 'cause basically if you think about what you're saying to me, you're saying because I'm a girl, and because I'm attractive, my only use for this agency would be to manipulate men.<eos> I think it's offensive, too.<eos> And that's exactly what I said to Aaron.<eos> I said that bitch is blind as a bat.<eos> Can we please move on?<eos> We have a dictator to kill.<eos> When handling the ricin strip, operate with extreme caution.<eos> Even momentary flesh contact with the exposed strip is fatal.<eos> The poison will lay dormant for 12 hours.<eos> After it passes the blood-brain barrier, your heart rate would shoot up to 160.
People been seeing me around for about a week.<eos> Guy I used to run with, he wants to meet me tonight.<eos> Now, if I can get him alone, we snatch him up, work him over, maybe get to Ledoux. - Okay.<eos> Great.<eos> - All right.<eos> Listen...<eos> Phone's fully charged. And remember, it's real simple.<eos> Green answers. Red hangs up.<eos> - I'm the only one that's gonna be calling.<eos> - All right. - Keep it charged. - Yeah.
Don't move.<eos> Get in the tub.<eos> That's it.<eos> You lay down.<eos> Don't you move.<eos> Get me outta here!<eos> Shut your fucking mouth!<eos> Right there. No, no, no.<eos> Ginger, no! Don't touch it.<eos> It's in there.
I promised Wolzogen and Körner to write, within five years, two classical tragedies and half a dozen long poems, if you can find me a rich patron.<eos> Years later Caroline will remember how hot it was that November day when Schiller read the first draft of her novel.<eos> Make the sentences shorter.<eos> This relative clause is redundant.<eos> Why not put the foster-father's tale in direct speech? From here.<eos> I'd have to put it all in direct speech. No, don't use consistent concepts. Do it differently every time.<eos> Literature can cope with inconsistencies.<eos> And don't adopt this fateful female tone every time you want to generate tension.<eos> In the scene by the fireplace the reader gets all the dark forebodings he needs to expect the next installment eagerly.<eos> "A big illuminated house showed me the way in the dark night. It lay in solitude, surrounded by only few outbuildings. 'This is where you will see your mother,.
Charitable organizations. Education initiatives.<eos> Thank you. We're very proud of our ministries.<eos> I don't do as much preaching as I used to, but the Legacy programs are more my focus now.<eos> The things like the State Policeman's Charity.<eos> What did you want to talk about, son?<eos> The Wellspring program. Mid-'80s through the early '90s, you remember that?<eos> Well, of course I remember.<eos> I'm trying to locate old personnel, faculty, but I'm having a little bit of trouble acquiring names.<eos> Well, the program was shut down ofﬂcially, you know, maybe 10 years ago.<eos> I never had much ground contact with it, but it involved a number of private schools, enterprises, you understand, that would adopt our standard of curriculum, and in return receive tuition reimbursement for underprivileged students.
Wellspring program, Austin Farrar?<eos> Dead women and children.<eos> Terrible.<eos> That's terrible.<eos> How's that? What you're working on?<eos> Oh, I can't say anything about it at this point, Reverend.<eos> I'd like to set you up with a clerk.<eos> You can look at, uh, whatever information we still have from Wellspring.<eos> Why did the Wellspring program shutdown, Reverend?<eos> It couldn't sustain its costs.
- This shrink is great.<eos> Doesn't talk much, but I'm making giant leaps forward.<eos> Yeah, you compare our sons-in-law to rats and you think you're better.<eos> Not rats, field mice! They're cute!<eos> They're still rats.<eos> I'm fed up with this nonsense!<eos> And stop spitting on those photos!<eos> Say, I read your proposal; Bio Mitzvah. Actually, I like it!<eos> - Really, Chao?<eos> - Yeah. Think it has potential?
It's quite unique, as you'll see.<eos> It also fires a shotgun cartridge for use in messy close-range situations.<eos> - How do they feel?<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Now do your very best impersonation... of a German aristocrat's formal greeting.<eos> No, Eggsy.<eos> That is sick.<eos> In the old days, they had a phone in the heel as well.<eos> How do I get it back in?<eos> Well, it's coated in one of the fastest acting neurotoxins known to man... so very carefully.
Arthur, Harry's dead.<eos> Galahad is dead.<eos> Hence, we have just drunk a toast to him.<eos> Well, then you know what that psycho's doing.<eos> How many people around the world have got those SIM cards?<eos> Valentine can send his signal to any of them, all of them.<eos> If they all go homicidal at the same time then...<eos> Indeed, and thanks to Galahad's recordings... we have Valentine's confession.<eos> The intelligence has been passed on to the relevant authorities.<eos> Our work is complete... and a most distinguished legacy for our fallen friend, it is, too.
This is different.<eos> Powerful fucking people.<eos> Dirty cops are dirty cops.<eos> You want to protect them?<eos> I have a pension and a family. I understand, but...<eos> Don't contact me again.<eos> (TYPING)<eos> FRANCIS: Where is your cell?<eos> Here.<eos> It's not recording.
Have you spoken to him yet?<eos> Not yet.<eos> I want to do the tests first.<eos> We can do those anytime this week.<eos> CLAIRE: I'll have my office call yours.<eos> I almost forgot.<eos> I've been doing some research on the Internet...<eos> Be careful of the Internet.<eos> Well, I was looking into common issues associated with post 40-pregnancies. And this drug came up, but there wasn't much on it.<eos> It's Cruvenae...

That is... unless you can shed some light... on where Daddy might be holed up.<eos> If you were to aid in my investigation, I might find a way to make those charges disappear.<eos> If I knew where he was, don't you think I would tell you?<eos> After everything I heard in there, I have no idea... what you would or wouldn't do.<eos> You're a bastard.<eos> I'd lawyer up, then.<eos> Good luck in court.<eos> Gordon.<eos> How's the leg?<eos> It's getting there.
Any idea who the shooter was?<eos> Can't help you there.<eos> This fake guard, you catch any security video... of him loading the truck this morning?<eos> The server went down this morning. So did our backup.<eos> Some kind of virus.<eos> We lost the last 24 hours of footage.<eos> And the missing cash, any way to trace that?<eos> Serial numbers? Markers?<eos> It's unbanked cash from the tables.<eos> Yesterday it was in someone's pocket.
I don't want a wife.<eos> I don't want children.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Supper would be nice.<eos> For 40 years I've tried to teach you.<eos> If you haven't learned by now, you never will.<eos> Go.<eos> If serving as a glorified bodyguard is the sum of your ambition, go serve.<eos> I suppose you want the sword back.<eos> Keep it.
How many Dornishmen does it take to fuck a goat?<eos> Please don't.<eos> Seems to me the smart place to meet travelers is in a tavern.<eos> That way, one party is late, the other party can drink some ale inside.<eos> This is the Prince of Dorne we're waiting for, not one of your sellsword friends.<eos> If he's so damned important, how come they sent you to meet him?<eos> There's bad blood between the Martells of Dorne and the Lannisters of Casterly Rock.<eos> Has been for years.<eos> And just in case the Martells of Dorne are looking to spill some Lannister blood,<eos> - it may as well be yours, eh?
I commanded the City Watch of King's Landing, boy.<eos> And now you're here.<eos> You must not have been very good at your job.<eos> How dare you? !<eos> There's a band of wildlings south of the Wall already led by Tormund Giantsbane.<eos> I killed their warg and three others.<eos> They shot me full of arrows.<eos> Their orders are to attack Castle Black from the south when Mance hits it from the north.<eos> The signal for the attack will be a bonfire.<eos> Mance said it would be the greatest fire the North has ever seen.
I'm sorry.<eos> I should have remembered.<eos> I can't accept your apology.<eos> I may be a fool, but I'm a living fool, thanks to you.<eos> Anyone would have done the same.<eos> But only you did.<eos> I can never repay you.<eos> You gave me my life.<eos> But this, this is worth more than my life.<eos> It belonged to my mother and her mother before her.
Otherwise he will kill you.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - My name is not important.<eos> It is to me.<eos> Sorry, I'm sorry.<eos> I cleanse you.<eos> - I'll get something to clean it.<eos> - Salt is best for red wine.<eos> - We think alike.<eos> - In fact it is.
Or do you want to not drive?<eos> I'm not sure that I am driving.<eos> Oh, Norman, not here again.<eos> Norman, Miss Watson passed away four months ago.<eos> No, she was murdered.<eos> I never got the chance to say good-bye.<eos> When is this gonna end?<eos> What?<eos> This endless moping around about Miss Watson!<eos> Yes, it was horrible and it was sad, but it's not like she was your friend or a girlfriend or a relative.
Yes, I just called you a dick, because that's what you are!<eos> I'm stuck here now because I can't sell my property because of your stupid bypass!<eos> I'm underwater!<eos> No one told me that before I bought it.<eos> Maybe you should talk about that at a city council meeting.<eos> Or maybe you should talk about the fact that your fancy town is run on drug money.<eos> Maybe that would be worth talking about as opposed to crazy house moms whining about whether or not their kids have read about ax murderers and whores.<eos> Welcome to the world, ladies!<eos> There are ax murderers and whores stuffed under every rug, so your kids better read up on it and get educated, because that's what life is!<eos> It's a cesspool you claw and scratch and fight to swim out of, but you never get to the top!
I believe in this place.<eos> If there's anyone who can do what's necessary to make it something better, it's you.<eos> Once we have the money, Flint dies.<eos> - No argument.<eos> - Not from me.<eos> Mr. Rackham, a word.<eos> Sit.<eos> Won't you tell me what you think of our little production?<eos> The theme is "Evenings in Paris."<eos> I'll give you three guesses whose idea it was.
So I bought the boys a round with the pesos, traded the pocket watch for a bit of tail, and spent two weeks that winter in New York trying to deliver that fucking letter to his sister.<eos> Looked high and low.<eos> Never found her.<eos> So on the way home, I waited till we were in open water and I could see no land in any direction, and I dropped it over the side.<eos> Returned to the sea.<eos> There are no legacies in this life, are there?<eos> No monuments.<eos> No history.<eos> Just the water.<eos> It pays us and then it claims us.
Might I enquire why not?<eos> Because France is a nation of liars and cheats.<eos> I appreciate a melodrama as much as the next man, but an explanation might help clarify things.<eos> Five years ago, a troop of Musketeers was sent to Savoy, to depose the Duke and put his infant son in his place.<eos> By the grace of God, that plan was thwarted.<eos> But the same night, Cluzet, Savoy's Chancellor, disappeared.<eos> We now know he was abducted by French agents, and is in prison here in Paris.<eos> There is, of course, not a word of truth in this absurd fabrication.<eos> Would you make peace with a nation that so outrageously meddles in the affairs of an independent state?<eos> Well, I suppose not, if it were true.
I'm Benji.<eos> He's making a documentary about my search for the stone.<eos> Ah. Of course.<eos> Do yourself a favor. Stay far away from this one.<eos> I just need to ask you one favor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Just one favor.<eos> Benji, did she mention to you, the last time we were together<eos> I literally wound up in a Turkish prison?<eos> George, it was not a prison. It was more of a jail.
Scarlett!<eos> Scarlett!<eos> Barriére d'Enfer.<eos> This is the spot I was talking about.<eos> This is where the buildings collapsed into the ground.<eos> Hundreds of people fell to their death right here.<eos> Yes.<eos> And when they sent people to fix it, 50 more disappeared.<eos> How the hell did they get a piano down here?<eos> Maybe it fell when one of the houses collapsed.
George.<eos> It's not gonna work.<eos> Why is he haunting you?<eos> When Danny got his leg pinned I promised him I'd be back with help.<eos> But I got lost along the way.<eos> My brother drowned waiting for me to save him.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Zed.<eos> I have a child I've never seen.<eos> I know it's mine, but I deny it.
Your vertebrae?<eos> Can you do the séance if someone in the room is a non-believer?<eos> And when you contact the spirits, will we be able to see the souls?<eos> And how are they different from ghosts?<eos> Or are they ghosts?<eos> I should think souls are quite different.<eos> - Have you ever heard of ectoplasm?<eos> - Ectoplasm? Now, isn't that a milky substance rather like yogurt?<eos> You are a joker, aren't you?<eos> So, you're saying it might look like yogurt, but it will be Mrs. Catledge's former husband.
How can you know that I've just come back from a spa in Italy?<eos> However she knows, it's not through mystical vibrations, I can assure you.<eos> He's always been so militantly scientific, even at six years old.<eos> One of the most kind and gentle local priests said that Stanley was the only child in the neighborhood destined for Hell.<eos> And why do you still trek to Italy, to pay good money to bathe in plain spring water that is not a drop more medicinal than the water that flows from your own tub?<eos> I'm not going to get into that debate with you, Stanley. It brings out the beast in you.<eos> And I see you still buy this stupid nostrum.<eos> It's a health mixture.<eos> Sulfur, molasses and barley extract.<eos> It's disgusting and is of no proven value.
Body heat, it's...<eos> My aunt used to bring me here as a boy.<eos> The roof opens up.<eos> Really?<eos> You can see the universe.<eos> It's menacing.<eos> Can you open it?<eos> I hardly think that's the brightest idea at the moment.<eos> - We just ran away from that.<eos> It's still up there.
And when Sophie excused herself at my aunt's to make a telephone call, she called you and you fed her information about my aunt.<eos> At first, I couldn't believe you would betray me like that.<eos> But, as you know, I am a misanthrope.<eos> And that people do unconscionable things does not run counter to my normal view of humanity.<eos> As boys, we both chose magic as our calling.<eos> We both practiced day and night, I as much as you.<eos> My skill was the equal of yours, and yet, you emerged onto the world stage as the great artist.<eos> But it wasn't fair.<eos> Life's not fair, Howard.<eos> In fact, as a general rule, as I've often said, it's pretty nasty.
Now, dinner is complete.<eos> Live from the CBS broadcast center in Los Angeles.<eos> This is CBS2 News at 6:00 a.m.<eos> Coverage you can count on.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> Thanks for joining us.<eos> I'm Pat Harvey.<eos> Hope your day's getting off to a good start. I'm Kent Shocknek.<eos> An unclaimed Mega Millions ticket sold at a 7-Eleven in South San Diego is worth a whopping $266 million.<eos> - The question is, is it yours?
- Yeah. I grew up all around here.<eos> - Can you start tonight?<eos> - Doing what?<eos> I run a successful TV news business.<eos> We film breaking stories. Maybe you saw my item this morning of a fatal carjacking.<eos> No. I don't have a TV, but that sounds cool.<eos> Do you have a cellphone?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Does it have GPS?<eos> - Yes, it does.
Mics. Dissolve. Cue.<eos> Hello, everybody. This is KWLA with breaking news.<eos> Over the last half-hour or so, we've now received word of an apparent home invasion triple homicide in the Granada Hills area of the San Fernando Valley.<eos> Now, at present, the number of those dead...<eos> - ...have not been confirmed yet by the police but KWLA has obtained exclusive footage from inside the crime scene in which at least three bodies can be observed.<eos> Now, we're going to show you segments of that footage throughout the rest of this broadcast, but also throughout the day.<eos> Ben, Lisa, I have a tape. When you're ready, throw to it.<eos> I'll follow you.<eos> Again, we're about to show you exclusive KWLA video from inside the actual crime scene.<eos> - It's graphic. Repeat it.
No!<eos> Take it off me right now!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I really have no choice.<eos> The sooner you go in, the sooner you'll be back out!<eos> I can't believe you did this to me.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Your word isn't worth shit!<eos> It's worth 500 bucks, up front.
Two neurons, you're moving, and with movement, interesting things begin to happen.<eos> Animal life on Earth goes back millions of years.<eos> Yet most species only use 3 to 5% of its cerebral capacity.<eos> But it isn't until we reached human beings at the top of the animal chain that we finally see a species use more of its cerebral capacity.<eos> 10% may not seem like much, but it's a lot if you look at all we've done with it.<eos> Now let's discuss a special case.<eos> The only living being that uses its brain better than us.<eos> The dolphin.<eos> It is estimated that this incredible animal uses up to 20% of its cerebral capacity.<eos> In particular, this allows it to have an echolocation system that is more efficient than any sonar invented by mankind.
It's a little rudimentary, but you're on the right track.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Professor, my cells are reproducing at a phenomenal speed.<eos> Several million per second.<eos> I'm having trouble precisely evaluating the time of my death, but I doubt I'll last more than 24 hours.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> What I'm saying is that your theory is not a theory.<eos> I absorbed a large quantity of synthetic C.P.H.4. that will allow me to use 100% of my cerebral capacity.<eos> Right now, I'm at 28%, and what you wrote is true.<eos> Once the brain reaches 20%, it opens up and expands the rest.
Got a light?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Hi there.<eos> Goalie, what are you doing here?<eos> Were you waiting for me?<eos> You gotta help me, Balsiger.<eos> Hey, I'm already late.<eos> Lunch will be ready in five minutes.<eos> - I gotta eat. Can't we postpone this?<eos> - No, it's urgent.
That's good.<eos> Oh, look at that.<eos> Oh, yeah. My masterpiece, baby.<eos> - That's beautiful.<eos> You could have just bought this at the store. I think they sold it there.<eos> - You sure that's your son, man? - I don't know. You'd better get a paternity test.<eos> - Oh, that looks incred...<eos> - Can I have some?<eos> Oh, Martin.<eos> - Please, just gimme some. - It's not from the store.
- It was just a fender bender.<eos> - Shut the fuck up, Charlie.<eos> - What? - Shut the fuck up.<eos> Oh, Levon.<eos> Hey, it's Uncle Charlie, remember?<eos> - It's great to see you... again.<eos> - What is wrong with this thing?<eos> Will you get a load of that?<eos> Hank?<eos> I think it's working.
Don't worry.<eos> He's made this shot a hundred times.<eos> He's drunk.<eos> He's never made it sober.<eos> Five, four, three, two, one!<eos> How about we try it blindfold?<eos> Take him!<eos> Musketeers.<eos> Always good for a little street theatre.<eos> It's not what it looks like.
Yes. Why carve him up?<eos> This is science.<eos> We can learn a great deal from a fresh cadaver.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> The pistol was close.<eos> Conjecture.<eos> Based on extensive experience on the battlefield.<eos> Hardly a clinical observation.<eos> Well, killing is not an exact science, Monsieur, but a messy business.<eos> And, as soldiers, it is our business.
All these are for houses inside the Court of Miracles.<eos> All bought for a pittance within the last few months, hundreds of them.<eos> But no rents have been collected in the Court for decades.<eos> Why buy something that's worthless?<eos> The land these houses occupy covers most of the Court.<eos> The paper value is immense, if there was a way to make them pay.<eos> A business mind like yours is wasted in the Musketeers, Captain Treville.<eos> You're right.<eos> If the Court wasn't there, that land would be worth a king's ransom.<eos> Who knows when it might prove a wise investment?
I am he.<eos> Then I want to ask it's still possible to buy a pavilion.<eos> I think there may be one or two left.<eos> -How are they priced?<eos> -They're priced at 15.<eos> -Fifteen million?<eos> -That's in American dollars, sir.<eos> -Of course it is.<eos> Well, plus running costs.<eos> You own it, we rent it out for you in the weeks you're not using it.
-Does it bother you?<eos> For a start, we own a large chunk of the island.<eos> We have the best beaches on Turks and Caicos.<eos> -Who are "we"?<eos> -I'm talking about our investors...<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> My friend wanted me to ask who those investors were.<eos> -Well, it's a very good question.<eos> -You don't know who owns the hotel?<eos> I know who owned it yesterday, but I don't know who owns it today.
I don't want to spend the rest of my life in Witness Protection.<eos> I promise you it won't come to that.<eos> Are all your promises made so easily?<eos> Yeah, well, I have an idea.<eos> I have an idea how we might all get out of this thing alive.<eos> -But there's a problem.<eos> -What's the problem?<eos> You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> You're good at this.<eos> Yeah, it's a simple game.
-I see you.<eos> No, you have got to be kidding me!<eos> I'm happy to show you this, but bear in mind, it's confidential.<eos> The Bridge is a charitable foundation.<eos> We will file, but we haven't filed yet.<eos> We're not in that position.<eos> I see.<eos> Any reason for that?<eos> Money's always happiest when it migrates.<eos> There it is marching across the page.
I don't think the Prime Minister has any urgent plans to stand down.<eos> If that's who you're talking about.<eos> Ah, but it's not me going to decide, is it? Or you, Mr Rogers.<eos> No, that's the one last decision that still lies with the British electorate.<eos> If you're going to make allegations against Alec Beasley, then I suggest you make them privately.<eos> Why?<eos> Are you recording this?<eos> No.<eos> Are you?<eos> Last time I saw my recorder, I swear to God, it was sitting in an ice-box. Where's yours?
The man you told me about.<eos> The man you loved.<eos> Forgive me, Stirling.<eos> You'll find me in our room.<eos> We need to get out.<eos> We need to get out of this.<eos> It's strange, isn't it?<eos> People want the world to change, but they don't think about providing the means to do it.<eos> Money flows, that's what it does. Who cares where it comes from?<eos> The question is... Where it goes.
Goon.<eos> What you were saying about the murder.<eos> Have you heard of The Bridge?<eos> The Prime Minister's plan to continue statesmanship beyond his formal period of elected office?<eos> Yes, I've heard of it.<eos> It was one of the donors to that project who was killed.<eos> - Do we know who by?<eos> - And we've had some questions recently about the project's financing.<eos> - It's financing? - Yes.<eos> How it's financed?
Yes, of course I will.<eos> And he must call immediately before you get here.<eos> Promise me.<eos> Don't worry, we're on the way.<eos> See you soon.<eos> OK, we are in business, it's good.<eos> I think we've got 'em.<eos> Where are they?<eos> We've got a signal.<eos> I'll know more in a minute, but it seems to be Kent.
Two kinds of people will approach you.<eos> First the government agents. And second those who aren't government agents.<eos> They'll both ask you about me.<eos> When you don't tell them anything.. They'll say that they're taking you to a 'safe' place.<eos> Why are you stressing on "safe"?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> There will be a gun hidden in the car.. Which they'll use to transport you.<eos> Gun?<eos> If it's a Skoda, it'll be under the left seat.<eos> And if it's a Toyota, then it'll be under the right.
"Ah, there was a little empty space in my heart."<eos> "You came and acquired it without rent."<eos> "I couldn't say anything, how is this helplessness."<eos> "Thus silently came an uninvited guest."<eos> "Ah, in my heart..."<eos> "What all will you make me do in dreams.?"<eos> "How many colors should I change for no reason?"<eos> "My poor, foolish heart flutters in the skies like a balloon." "Gently you called. Wherever you go, it follows."<eos> "it just went with eyes closed." "Slowly, following you."<eos> "Little by little it pulls you. Whether you look or not."
Come in my clear.<eos> Come.<eos> You have a lovely home.<eos> How long have you been living here?<eos> In this house?<eos> Can't remember.<eos> Pankaj? Must be 40 years, right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> For as long as we've been married.<eos> It's beautiful.
Go to hell!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Hey, Mark?<eos> Yes hon?<eos> I'm almost ready.<eos> Hey, is my jewelry box in there?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Got it.
Oh, I love dogs.<eos> You have good day, sir.<eos> All right, come on, then.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> You need to go?<eos> Yo, Aurelio!<eos> I want a new VIN number and some clean papers.<eos> Where'd you get that car?<eos> Is it here?<eos> It was.
Ask me again if he makes it through the night.<eos> Who else did we lose?<eos> Murphy and Mbege, both named John.<eos> Neither was injured during landing.<eos> I concur. Something else killed these two.<eos> One second, they were fine, - and the next, bang.<eos> - Then it isn't radiation.<eos> Come on, Abby.<eos> Wishful thinking isn't good science.<eos> It's not wishful thinking.
! If we don't operate soon, he'll die.<eos> We'll wait till it's dark.<eos> What's the matter with you?<eos> Don't you care about Porthos?<eos> I know somewhere... nearby.<eos> Why didn't you mention it before?<eos> Remi! Come and see, quickly!<eos> Bring him in here.<eos> I tell you something. If this place is for sale, I might be interested.<eos> It's not.
Your credibility?<eos> I am not gonna ask a third time.<eos> Stop! Stop!<eos> We will help you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I will help you.<eos> Why are you looking for Yates?<eos> I need to know what he's doing, or else I can't begin to find him.<eos> Two weeks ago I intercepted intel framing an assassination attempt on President Heller.<eos> It's supposed to take place in London here today.
All the evidence is here to alert the authorities.<eos> They can decrypt the data. Okay, good.<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no!<eos> What's happening?<eos> Yates embedded a self-destruct program. It's erasing itself.<eos> Can you save it?<eos> Chloe, save it!<eos> Couldn't do it.<eos> It was erasing my hard drive.
You need to get away from that vehicle!<eos> Somethings taken control of my drone!<eos> No!<eos> The answer has to be on my flight key, okay?<eos> I've been setup.<eos> I swear to God!<eos> Nobody move!<eos> Jack, what are you doing?<eos> Two weeks ago I intercepted intel framing an assassination attempt on President Heller.<eos> It's supposed to take place in London here today.
The U. S. claimed they were targeting my husband, who they called a terrorist.<eos> I demand justice from the man responsible for this slaughter,<eos> President James Heller.<eos> Unless President Heller surrenders himself to me in three hours at a place of my choosing, thousands of people in London will die in his stead.<eos> We've confirmed that Margot Al-Harazi has six U.S. drones under her control.<eos> We believe they're headed for London.<eos> So I was right.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Possible hit on the Al-Harazi tape.<eos> The back-trace program was being bounced from proxy to proxy, but it suddenly spat out an IP address.
Remember that, okay?<eos> I love you, Simone.<eos> I promise.<eos> All right?<eos> I promise I will get you through this, okay?<eos> Gear up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> A possible hit on the Al-Harazi tape.<eos> Any update?<eos> The back-trace program was being bounced from proxy to proxy, but it suddenly spat out an IP address.
Coming up now.<eos> You should be leading this mission, not Navarro.<eos> He's gonna take the credit when you're the one who figured out what was going on.<eos> It's not right.<eos> Give me a second.<eos> Agent Morgan?<eos> Have you seen the Al-Harazi tape?<eos> Of course.<eos> Everyone's seen it.<eos> It's all over the Internet.
It's got to come out.<eos> This is gonna hurt, sir.<eos> - I'm sorry, sir.<eos> You've done enough damage as a federal agent, Jack.<eos> Thank God you didn't become a surgeon.<eos> Did you remember to tell your staff that you wanted to remain undisturbed? Yeah.<eos> In the office,<eos> - hard at work all evening.<eos> - Good.<eos> If an agent wants to check for a signal, that'll confirm it.
We're going to save lives, Chloe. Millions of them.<eos> How?<eos> We're going to break into the world's arsenals, and exploit the vulnerability in their firewalls.<eos> We're going to share that information with every nation on Earth.<eos> How effective could a country's weapons systems be if its adversaries could take control of them?<eos> Not very.<eos> Right, so, one stroke and technological warfare is obsolete.<eos> Adrian, the override is locked up at CIA.<eos> How do you expect to get it out of there?<eos> It's out already.
Audrey.<eos> Your father was a...<eos> Was a courageous man and a dear friend.<eos> To sacrifice himself in such a way, it was an act of bravery that my nation will never forget.<eos> Thank you, Prime Minister.<eos> Well, let's just hope Al-Harazi keeps her word.<eos> News is still coming in about an explosion at Wembley Stadium just moments ago.<eos> Eyewitnesses at the scene are reporting that they saw a missile hitting the stadium, echoing events at St. Edward's Hospital earlier today.<eos> Why would Al-Harazi fire a missile into an empty football stadium?<eos> Because it wasn't empty.
Remember that<eos> No!<eos> How long do they have?<eos> About 30 seconds.<eos> They're not gonna make it out in time.<eos> I got Margot Al-Harazi in custody and the override device.<eos> What now?<eos> The missile's launched. What?<eos> You can divert it, Jack.<eos> It's laser-guided.
What do you know about that?<eos> Just bring it to me.<eos> No, all of the drones have already been grounded.<eos> That device is completely useless.<eos> What do you want with it?<eos> Again, best you don't know.<eos> Just...<eos> Bring it to me.<eos> And I'll make sure you have everything you asked for.<eos> Look, that thing's gonna be on lockdown as soon as it arrives here.
Adrian Cross is dead.<eos> What about Chloe?<eos> Don't know.<eos> The override device is missing.<eos> Whoever has it was smart enough to take off the tracker.<eos> Jack, this phone is still recording.<eos> You're trying my patience, Ms. O'Brian.<eos> Do not cause any more trouble than you're worth.<eos> Get going.<eos> Play it again. Play it again.
What was it?<eos> I wanted a pancake house.<eos> I love my mom's pancakes.<eos> After school, when I smelled the batter... I was happy-<eos> Pancakes are good.<eos> But it wasn't serious.<eos> Who cares what's serious?<eos> If you like them, make them.<eos> Sure, but life isn't that simple.<eos> It should be.
I don't know if Frankie's told you, but I don't have any cash or nothing like that.<eos> - Look, man, who does?<eos> - No, we don't want your money, man.<eos> I'm putting together a team of people that I can trust.<eos> We have a meeting tonight.<eos> Give us a lift, I'll tell you more.<eos> - You want me to drive? - Yeah.<eos> I thought you gave my bro a ride here.<eos> Oh, yeah, we drove.<eos> We got a car, but it's small.
Ned?<eos> Ned who? Who's Ned?<eos> Come on, Bud.<eos> We're friends, right?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I've been writing a poem about you even.<eos> So you have to tell me where Ned's gone.<eos> But this poem, you see, requires a certain creatural detail.<eos> The currency of lived experience, so to speak.<eos> What's it about, this poem?
I have a similar experience, but in this case, I don't really see... 50 on top of the 62 the boy owes.<eos> So you're offering me a bribe?<eos> Not a bribe, a token.<eos> I'd give you more if I had it.<eos> 50,000, you go back, you tell them he's dead.<eos> You and me... we both get to live another day in the sun.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - That's the 13 to go with the 49, make up the 62 you owe.<eos> Wait, you're giving me your money?<eos> No, I'm giving it to Quentin, and this.
- Where's mine?<eos> Hey, Job.<eos> How was New York?<eos> I see you got your ass kicked again while I was gone.<eos> It's starting to be a thing.<eos> Every man needs a hobby.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Probably not.<eos> How'd it go?<eos> How'd it go?
I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.<eos> One day his boss cheats him out of some wages, so he takes the guy to court.<eos> The judge says, "Boy, don't bite the hand that feeds you."<eos> - Pops gets fired.<eos> - That's some judge.<eos> Couple years later he buys his first car.<eos> It gets stolen.
Maybe not as extreme as him, but it's always something.<eos> A look, a comment.<eos> Something.<eos> You know, you get real good at burying it and hiding it behind a smile.<eos> This, I couldn't let it go.<eos> I didn't want to.<eos> I've been following His teachings for years.<eos> Been turning the other cheek.<eos> The thing about it is if I could go back, I'd do the same thing to those pieces of shit again.<eos> I'd do the same thing again and again, even though I know it's a sin.
With potatoes and pie for dessert.<eos> It's funny... some guys, they just inhaled it.<eos> I mean, it had been so long since...<eos> Other guys, they took it back to their tables and sat, looked at it, just started crying.<eos> I get it.<eos> Then there was these other guys who took the steak and threw it against the fucking wall.<eos> Like telling the place to go fuck itself, you know?<eos> Sean, get back here.<eos> - I got it!<eos> - Give it back!
Your inability to control yourself has completely derailed our scheme.<eos> Not if I regain possession of the resonator.<eos> One demonstration, and the Order Draco will be rendered bankrupt, as planned.<eos> Yes, Renfield told me.<eos> Another bloodbath.<eos> Calling it a strategy does not make it any less a compulsion.<eos> Professor, you wouldn't happen to know anything about the disappearance of Browning's two children?<eos> - What is it to you?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Only that it places undue scrutiny on our activities by the authorities, and if our plan should fail as a result, I'll hold you solely responsible.
___<eos> Sir, Dr. Van Helsing is here to administer your infusion.<eos> Show him to the cellar.<eos> I'll join him there.<eos> I am very much looking forward to seeing the financial pages tomorrow.<eos> I suspect a precipitous drop in the price of oil.<eos> Yes.<eos> I expect so.<eos> He's just being testy because I was right about direct engagement.<eos> It wouldn't have been necessary, had you adhered to the plan.
Well, find me one and tell me where it is.<eos> Holy relic, through your blood show me where the vampires are hiding.<eos> Ruma, 95 Lower Street.<eos> Huntsmen, come on!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Two flairs.<eos> Take this down to Lady Jayne.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Message for you, sir.<eos> - What is it?
Where are my children?<eos> Do not worry.<eos> You will be reunited soon enough.<eos> Move.<eos> Move!<eos> Right there.<eos> That's far enough.<eos> Keep perfectly still, Mr. Browning, or I will shoot you.<eos> - I brought your money.<eos> It's all there.
Guns.<eos> That's more like it.<eos> I thought you loved me.<eos> I lied.<eos> Sorry, Jayne.<eos> I've grown immune to all your toys.<eos> I know what's inside you.<eos> The darkness.<eos> I live in the darkness...<eos> But I yearn for the light, even though it burns.
'Cause, you know, his... his wrist will recover.<eos> It's not career-ending.<eos> I'm talking about the murder.<eos> And the daggone killer is getting away with it!<eos> Are you saying Micah's the killer?<eos> 'Cause that would make no sense.<eos> I mean, what motive would he have to kill Henry?<eos> He's young, he's good-looking, he's playing professional baseball.<eos> His life's perfect.<eos> Look, it's not all puppies and sunshine, you know.
You must have been so jealous of him.<eos> I read this article about Micah, and I... I couldn't believe it.<eos> Oh, my God. I...<eos> I had a twin brother all this time?<eos> I... I tried to contact him, but he didn't respond.<eos> I figured 'cause he was busy, but I couldn't just let that go.<eos> I mean, this amazing baseball prospect might be my twin.<eos> So, I... I... I thought, if he could just meet me, you know?<eos> I mean, he bragged about this condo he bought on Facebook in Florida, so I... I hopped on a bus, and I... I tracked him down.<eos> O... our first meet happened just like I said, only it happened in Florida, not Chicago.
So, I... I... I thought, if he could just meet me, you know?<eos> I mean, he bragged about this condo he bought on Facebook in Florida, so I... I hopped on a bus, and I... I tracked him down.<eos> O... our first meet happened just like I said, only it happened in Florida, not Chicago.<eos> But we really did end up hanging out all night.<eos> When did you decide that you were gonna try to become him?<eos> Switching places was Micah's crazy idea.<eos> We woke up the next morning really hung over.<eos> Micah felt worse than me, and he had a game to play.<eos> So, he decided to let me fulfill my dream of playing in the pros.<eos> I mean, he figured it was just for one minor-league game. Hmm.
One, you were running a news blog while working in office.<eos> - It was gossip-tainment.<eos> - Two, you posted a photo which roused the suspicions of the press.<eos> It has been forwarded to every hack in DC.<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> And I deleted it.<eos> Which made it even worse!<eos> The fact is that your post has made it impossible to sit on the POTUS's secret any longer, so as a direct result of your actions, the President of the United States is bringing forward the announcement to today that he is not running for re-election.<eos> We'll alert the networks there's gonna be a live announcement.<eos> Don't interrupt any major sporting event unless it's golf.
What?<eos> He didn't used to be paralyzed, he used to be my best friend.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> But I haven't spoken to him in a while, but he is still paralyzed, so thank goodness.<eos> That doesn't go away.<eos> Sorry, I guess.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Your shirt, that kind of reminds me of him.<eos> Eye of the Tiger fan.<eos> It kind of reminds me of Rocky III. Bestmovieof alltime.
I run a fair and clean business... and we follow every standard industry practice.<eos> And I will fight to my last breath to prove that.<eos> But don't think for a moment... that I'm gonna let this mess interfere with our plans to grow.<eos> And we need to know that you're standing with us.<eos> Yes.<eos> What is it about this property that makes you feel it's so integral... that you can't put it off until after all these legal matters are settled?<eos> That's a very good question.<eos> This property gives us many things.<eos> First, access to the river... so I can bring in my fuel directly from any provider in the world... straight to my tanks.<eos> Second, it has over 10 million gallons of storage capacity... so I can buy in the summers when the price is low... and sell to my customers and, more importantly, my competitors... when the price is high.
- For about an hour, I thought they had burned down all of Nassau.<eos> But it's been handled.<eos> As of last night, I've instituted a new trading system and the street has embraced it.<eos> A consortium with myself at its head, Captains Naft and Lawrence as a means of shipping, and Mr. Frasier as its corporate seal.<eos> Hmm. All this since yesterday?<eos> I will address the situation with Mrs. Barlow immediately.<eos> You have my word.<eos> Captain, one more thing.<eos> The consortium wasn't founded easily.<eos> It required the assistance of a few other parties.
- Idelle!<eos> Downstairs.<eos> - Customer.<eos> All I'm saying is get in while the getting's good.<eos> Jesus!<eos> The fuck did they do to you?<eos> Postelection initiation, I'm told.<eos> All done in good fun.<eos> At least...<eos> I think it was all done in good fun.
To put ourselves through all this when the outcome's so uncertain.<eos> The outcome is only uncertain for those who disbelieve.<eos> I believe in this place.<eos> And I believe if there's anyone who can do what's necessary to make it something better, it's you.<eos> Oi, where are you going?<eos> Eyes on Randall at all times-- wasn't that the deal?<eos> Randall, you are a fucking puzzle.<eos> Part of me thinks you must be the luckiest halfwit in the colonies, the way this all played out.<eos> But part of me suspects there's something else going on here.<eos> I'm forced to wonder if you didn't orchestrate this whole little drama knowing it would corner me into securing your return to the crew.
I need to make a call to Fo Shan.<eos> Sure!<eos> - It won't take long.<eos> - Fill out the form. But Sir...<eos> Ask someone to buy you a phone card,<eos> Don't play me, Sir.<eos> Give it to your welfare officer and get in line.<eos> You can make the call in front of the welfare officer.<eos> Just one call, Sir.<eos> Everyone says it's urgent.
Free?<eos> There was a code, but it's ruined now.<eos> It is no more.<eos> Thank you.<eos> That was what I needed to know.<eos> - He tried to fucking kill me!<eos> - There is no armed Hubot.<eos> - Are you calling me a liar?<eos> - No, but you can be caught up in the game.<eos> - It may feel like the real thing.
- Do not joke like that.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> - No one will know that you are a Hubot.<eos> - Shhh... Do not say that. - What you just said.<eos> - Hubot? Yeah.<eos> - Do not say "Hubot"?<eos> - We do not use those words.<eos> - I do not see myself that way.<eos> - Neither do I, but it is just a word.
Hans Engman.<eos> We can not remove the virus, but perhaps encapsulate it.<eos> Do you go into the operating system?<eos> No.<eos> We have to do it manually.<eos> Manually?<eos> What?<eos> Are you going to cut into Mimi?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But it will get rid of it?
Beatrice: In the end, your eyes will focus and hold on to a final image.<eos> See how it slowly fades away and disappears.
Really good.<eos> - Did you fight at the Twins?<eos> - Call that a fight?<eos> Slaughtering livestock more like.<eos> The Red Wedding they're calling it.<eos> Walder Frey committed sacrilege that day.<eos> He shared bread and salt with the Starks.<eos> He offered them guest right.<eos> Guest right don't mean much anymore.<eos> It means something to me.
They all think I'm lying.<eos> About what?<eos> Killing the white walker.<eos> You're not lying.<eos> I'll never forget the way it screamed.<eos> But you're the only one that saw it.<eos> And they all think you're just a-- A what?<eos> Well, a wildling.<eos> My father hated that word.<eos> It's not a very nice word, I suppose.
Killing the white walker.<eos> You're not lying.<eos> I'll never forget the way it screamed.<eos> But you're the only one that saw it.<eos> And they all think you're just a-- A what?<eos> Well, a wildling.<eos> My father hated that word.<eos> It's not a very nice word, I suppose.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It makes me sound a bit dangerous, doesn't it?
You're your father's daughter, no mistake.<eos> Bloody relentless, the both of you.<eos> It's a new one today.<eos> Lots of tricky words.<eos> But I think you can manage.<eos> You'll never read well if you move your lips.<eos> That's how children do it.<eos> "The Life and Adventures of Elyo Grivas First Sword of Braavos."<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> I like this one. It's full of sword fights and pirates.
No, of course not!<eos> That wasn't my fault!<eos> Everything in life is interconnected, like a spider's web.<eos> It's no one's fault.<eos> Free yourself from the restraints surrounding you.<eos> Cut and eliminate the source of your inner torment.<eos> After two years of training patiently, Dochi became infamous, whose name sent chills down the nobles' spines.<eos> In Joseon society, all body hair had to be groomed, a custom of their forefathers.<eos> The act of cutting off a topknot, a symbol of masculinity, Challenged the fundamental social values of society.<eos> But for him, it was nothing but a fun new hobby.
Didn't we establish a no-talking rule?<eos> People are getting killed all over the city.<eos> Why did you stop for us?<eos> I saw you.<eos> You were putting up a hell of a fight.<eos> You reminded me of someone.<eos> Who?<eos> Look, purging, no matter what the reason, is wrong.<eos> Killing doesn't help anything.<eos> It doesn't heal someone.
What's the equation?<eos> That is the question.<eos> And a very good question.<eos> I'm not quite sure yet.<eos> But I intend to find out.<eos> Then why didn't you stay at Oxford?<eos> Because my finals exams were such a shambles, that the examiners, they summoned me in for a viva,<eos> - and they told me that if I got a second...<eos> - What's a viva?<eos> Oh, it's a sort of mildly terrifying face-to-face thingy.
It's on the back, I had a little accident.<eos> I could only do nine.<eos> Good Lord.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Bravo.<eos> Nine?<eos> Come in.<eos> Stephen, take a seat.<eos> I wanted to talk to you about your subject.<eos> We're all rather concerned as to what it's going to be.
He'll be fine.<eos> Sorry.<eos> - No problem.<eos> Allowing us to predict that some particles can, in fact, escape a black hole.<eos> So, black holes are not, in fact, black at all, but glow with heat radiation.<eos> The steady emission of heat energy causes the black holes to lose mass<eos> and eventually they disappear in a spectacular explosion.<eos> It's very, very simple, in the way that a body loses heat.<eos> - Second law of thermodynamics. - Right, it's thermodynamics.<eos> If we can imagine that a black hole is, indeed, losing particles and over time, will diminish in size, it will evaporate, it will...
So...<eos> First a star vanishes into a black hole.<eos> And then the black hole itself<eos> vanishes.<eos> Gone, nothing.<eos> - From nothing to nothing!<eos> - You owe me another beer.<eos> I have just shown you that our friend has proven that time, indeed, has a beginning.<eos> Not only that, how the universe was born, and...<eos> - How it will end.
There is already a restaurant.<eos> Just across the street.<eos> 100 feet.<eos> We measured.<eos> That is why the people moved back to Paris.<eos> They couldn't make it pay.<eos> Papa, the restaurant across the street has a Michelin star?<eos> I know, I saw it. Twinkle, twinkle.<eos> So what?<eos> Papa, it is the best restaurant for 50 miles in any direction.
Hey, Mukhtar, look, I'm cooking paneer!<eos> Oi!<eos> So sorry I'm late.<eos> Les chanterelles.<eos> I wish to take advantage because they are perfect at the moment, because of the heavy rain last night.<eos> With a little cream then?<eos> Yes, but smoke the cream first, please.<eos> Now, last night, we served this.<eos> Miserable, overcooked asparagus.<eos> In this restaurant, the cuisine is not an old, tired marriage, it is a passionate affair of the heart.
Thank you.<eos> Marguerite, I'm glad that our brakes failed here.<eos> Maybe brakes break for a reason.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What am I going to do?<eos> You should just go.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Go.<eos> Hassan, you have reached the very highest level of cuisine.<eos> Up here, cooking is no longer an art. It's a science.
Come in, Dusty. Come in, Dusty.<eos> Propwash Junction to Dusty.<eos> Hey, Skip.<eos> What's up?<eos> Did the gearbox come in?<eos> What?<eos> So...<eos> Dust...<eos> Sparky, I'll tell him.<eos> It was the wrong one.
You're welcome!<eos> - What?<eos> - Because you're fixed!<eos> Wait.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, that was the hardest thing I've ever done.<eos> You've got yourself a custom-made epicyclic, concentric reduction gearbox.<eos> A new gearbox?<eos> No.<eos> It's better than new.
- He's the final hurdle.<eos> - Cutting it pretty close, Frank.<eos> Well, this is...<eos> this is historic.<eos> The Republicans have wanted entitlement reform since Johnson.<eos> Curtis will come around.<eos> In the meantime, we should get the new retirement ages<eos> - into his speech.<eos> - I would stay away from specifics.<eos> - I mean, even if it passes, the House--
I'll be here.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on.<eos> OK.<eos> Delete.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> - Can't find my phone.<eos> It's weird, I had it a minute ago.<eos> - Here it is.
Raymond told me this was your idea, to pursue this compromise.<eos> - I suggested it as an option.<eos> - No, he said you bullied him into it.<eos> That he thought it was a mistake.<eos> If he felt so strongly, he should've have advised you otherwise.<eos> Raymond's not a politician.<eos> He relies on our political expertise as much as we rely on his business acumen.<eos> Maybe we shouldn't point fingers until there's a problem.<eos> - You wouldn't call this a problem?<eos> - Not if it's solved before it becomes one.
Will there be a next time?<eos> Assuredly.<eos> Thank you for your time, Inspector.<eos> When I have information to share with you, I promise I shall.<eos> I'll tell you one thing though, and you can take it to heart, if you don't change your tactics, you'll never stop him.<eos> You see, you're hunting for a man;<eos> you need to start hunting for a beast.<eos> Would you remove your corset, Miss Croft?<eos> There's blood.<eos> Is it consumption?
Earth to earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.<eos> Your firstborn has returned Father.<eos> Did you think I wouldn't find you?<eos> Did you imagine that I was dead?<eos> That I could die?<eos> You know better Frankenstein.<eos> I would seek you even unto the maelstrom of the blackest tempest of the darkest night.<eos> Stand and face me!<eos> Look upon this face anew.<eos> Is it not well made?
We are steam engines and turbines.<eos> Were you really so naive to imagine that we'd see eternity in a daffodil?<eos> Who is the child, Frankenstein thee or me?<eos> You ran from me once. Never again.<eos> We are the Janus mask.<eos> Inseparable.<eos> How could you do that?<eos> That?<eos> That?<eos> Aborting your child before it could know pain?
The denigration of one's art.<eos> You know Shakespeare, yes?<eos> Some.<eos> The Immortal.<eos> That was my stock in trade when there was a value placed upon the ineffable and the exalted.<eos> When this city aspired to Jerusalem.<eos> Do you need work?<eos> Yes.<eos> Your visage creates challenges?<eos> It is a horror.
I hold out dignity.<eos> I would pay for a private asylum in the country.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> We'll stay at home.<eos> She will need opiates before long for the pain.<eos> She will cease being who she is.<eos> Then I'll love who she becomes.<eos> Berth 17 is ahead.<eos> Why this ship?<eos> It came from Cairo four months ago and has been in quarantine since... for what they're vaguely describing as "typhus or an unknown foreign disease."
- I don't believe so.<eos> - Nor to many others.<eos> Aside from a small percentage of the reading public with a taste in a certain kind of literature.<eos> - A penny dreadful?<eos> - One in particular.<eos> As literature, it is uninspiring.<eos> But as folklore from the Balkans popularised it is not without merit.<eos> Mr. Rymer missed the facts, but he caught the truth.<eos> There is, on this earth, a creature that exceeds what is commonly known as the limits of life and death.<eos> This creature feeds on the blood of the living and can have transformative effects on those upon which it preys.
For the dead travel fast.<eos> It's not her.<eos> She must be here somewhere.<eos> Why have you told me this?<eos> Because you would have come to the same place without me.<eos> - And then?<eos> - You would have pursued it.<eos> And that I would have had to prevent.<eos> If I had a son I would wish him a long and easy life.<eos> I think your life will not be easy, but it should be long.
Would you be good enough to prepare another slide for us?<eos> You have steady hands.<eos> Oh, to be young again.<eos> You have the steadiest hands I've ever seen, Professor Van Helsing.<eos> A steady heart, perhaps.<eos> We will stain the sample, yes?<eos> My God.<eos> What's happening?<eos> There is no real name for the interdiction.<eos> Immodestly, I confess I invented the solution that makes it visible to us, so I named it after my late wife.
Far as we want.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> And what would we do when we got there?<eos> Everything.<eos> I think we should go in and go as far out as we can see.<eos> No, we shouldn't.<eos> Will you always be afraid, Mina mine?<eos> Were ever two families closer than ours?<eos> I don't remember a day that gate between our homes was closed.<eos> Until the day it closed forever.
Would you like to see something interesting?<eos> No.<eos> My Mina?<eos> Your Mina.<eos> Although you'll be relieved to know she only worked with the most pacific of animals.<eos> This is her squirrel.<eos> Which are yours?<eos> Not the docile ones.<eos> That doesn't surprise me.<eos> I've always felt you have to name a thing before it comes to life, like a witch's spell.
Everyone likes oranges, I reckon.<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Reading again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Thank you for the book.<eos> Paradise Lost.<eos> That was sweet.<eos> Are you reading it?<eos> Well, it's awfully long.
You don't have to hide your face from me.<eos> I'll see you later, then.<eos> May I speak with you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You have not been honest with me.<eos> What do you want, Vanessa?<eos> It's gone.<eos> What?<eos> The photograph of Mina and Peter.<eos> Yes, it is.
Nothing I would say would come as a surprise.<eos> So you simply want the satisfaction of hearing me say it.<eos> Very well.<eos> I would sacrifice you to save my daughter.<eos> I would choose her over you.<eos> I might even hope I get the chance.<eos> But until then, you are invaluable to me.<eos> Your connection to Mina is my lifeline, so I must keep you alive.<eos> I put the photograph in the drawer because I couldn't bear it.<eos> It broke my heart.
I have no fear.<eos> But I must.<eos> Between us there's a rare connection, I won't deny it.<eos> But that very intimacy released something... unhealthy in me, something I cannot allow.<eos> You will not be able to deny it.<eos> I'm sorry, I will.<eos> Poor Dorian.<eos> You've never known this feeling before, have you?<eos> I don't know what I'm feeling.<eos> It's rejection.
That might stimulate a psychological break or dissociation which...<eos> Did you bring your weapons?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Come.<eos> My God.<eos> Mr. Chandler.<eos> Forgive me. I am not myself.<eos> My dear Miss Ives.<eos> Can I help you in any way?<eos> You have no idea how I fight this thing, but it is... adamantine.
Though you do wake up and get feisty every now and then.<eos> I can only imagine.<eos> Is there water?<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> It gets pretty rough sometimes.<eos> Our friend, the doctor, thinks we might have to restrain you to keep you from hurting yourself.<eos> He would, wouldn't he?<eos> You don't know what it's like having this thing inside me.<eos> Always... scratching.<eos> That's an awful word, but that's what it feels like.
Sir Malcolm is inquiring about the noise.<eos> We're in trouble with Dad.<eos> This is good.<eos> I picked up the rudiments of cooking on the trail back home.<eos> Always thought myself a dab hand at the spices.<eos> In America, yes?<eos> New Mexico Territory mostly.<eos> But all over really.<eos> California, all the way to the Pacific.<eos> When I first saw the ocean, I thought it must be a lake.
Shelley saved yours.<eos> I think about her all the time. - She might still be out there.<eos> - She died alone.<eos> And when Letha died, and I needed you, you tucked your dick between your legs and ran away like the little fucking bitch you are.<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Roman, please...<eos> Get out of my house.<eos> Today, I said goodbye to Letha and her baby.<eos> The baby I never got to hold.<eos> It's been hard these weeks, to accept the fact that they're both gone.
He's... busy with other matters.<eos> Thanks for the flowers.<eos> Hey, you!<eos> Well, it was worth a try.<eos> He's a fucking prick.<eos> You want something to eat?<eos> No, I'm not hungry.<eos> Can I borrow the car again?<eos> Please.<eos> It's on the street.
I suppose you blame me too, huh?<eos> Hello, Jack.<eos> You need to take better care of this dog.<eos> I feel horrible.<eos> I got all the dogs chipped, but at least they're not running away to anywhere I can't find 'em.<eos> He's just looking for Will.<eos> Hmm? Yeah.<eos> Isn't that why you're here?<eos> Listen, uh I understand why you felt you had to file that report.<eos> You questioned my judgment when it needed to be questioned.
It didn't sound that way when you were comparing us to the tea party.<eos> I was being unfair.<eos> You're not a reactionary.<eos> You're a progressive.<eos> - I see where this is going.<eos> - How do you mean?<eos> When you've been in the wasteland as long as I have, you become immune to flattery.<eos> I know you think I'm fundamentally deceptive, but I am capable of a genuine compliment.<eos> Then I will take it as one, but it won't soften my resolve.<eos> If it did, you wouldn't deserve the compliment in the first place.
Have them bring up the bridge instead.<eos> - Let's see if Feng is bluffing.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> We must learn from Longstreet.<eos> He rode too high in the saddle.<eos> If a bullet comes my way tomorrow, it will not be an accident, and I must be quick to duck.<eos> Gentlemen, thank you for coming.<eos> Is the vice president attending?<eos> No, he's not. He's out of town.<eos> I've just decided to use his office because it's a bit bigger than mine.
I saw the price you paid.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Come back and see us again, please. - Okay.<eos> Why do you keep saying that?<eos> "The price you paid."<eos> - What does that even?<eos> - Fuck if I know.<eos> A director I worked with used it once.<eos> I thought it sounded good, so I incorporated it into my patter.
It sounds kind of devious, actually.<eos> I know, right?<eos> So all I have to do is break up with "Old Balls."<eos> - Oh, unpleasant.<eos> - But necessary.<eos> - I have a confession to make.<eos> - Oh, what's that?<eos> Before the meeting, I went on RedTube and watched your masturbation video.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> I've been trying to get them to take it down, but apparently it still gets a lot of hits.

Well... cards on the table.<eos> I'm not in the market for anything serious, so if you're okay with that...<eos> I just got out of a serious relationship, so I'm not really in the market, either.<eos> Then drinks it is.<eos> [Elevator bell dings]<eos> Hey, Uncle Bobby.<eos> I see you're admiring our new artwork.<eos> I actually picked this bad boy up in Tulum. Figured it'd look great in the office.<eos> But if you don't like it here, we can always move it to Southfork.<eos> I think it's perfect here.
I swear it on the lives of my children.<eos> But technically you are still married?<eos> Yes.<eos> In the eyes of the church.<eos> But in the eyes of God, no.<eos> I have a lot of respect for Lucia.<eos> She's the mother of my children.<eos> But my heart is not with her anymore.<eos> In many ways... it never was.<eos> It was always with you.
they would dig an enormous bloody pit and wreak the whole lot in with a few handful still alive no names. horses. mules,<eos> and the men all turned into fertilizer this is the first war anyone has given a damn<eos> my boys, should be buried at home beside their mother<eos> go home Mr Connor<eos> the Brits, go away!<eos> did you have buildings like this where you come from?<eos> but he didn't give up, he kept on fighting for 3 days<eos> he gave me 20 para, and bought me this<eos> I told you my son has work to do here Mr Connor he's 10, what would you expect him to say?<eos> give the money back, now but, mom return it now

missed away. straight arm.<eos> Englishers, always with rules!<eos> give me this sergeant<eos> get ready<eos> the Greeks .. than I thought they terrorize the people and burn the towns<eos> we used to be one country now we're constantly at war<eos> pull the shades up<eos> take cover!<eos> Joshua, pick up a gun!<eos> Anzac bey, don't invade a country if you don't know where it is
Which do you like better?<eos> This one?<eos> Or this one?<eos> The red one.<eos> The red one.<eos> Don't I look too serious?<eos> No, I think it's fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Besides, prison's not that bad.<eos> It just has bad reputation.
What?<eos> That's our country.<eos> Everyone wants these guys to get what they deserve, but no one is willing to lift a finger.<eos> Be proud, kid.<eos> For once in your miserable life, you're doing something worthwhile.<eos> —I'm not doing anything. —You're not?<eos> You stay here arguing instead of taking the food away from him.<eos> Relax.<eos> You have nothing to worry about.<eos> If there's an investigation, I'll say I used rat poison in the kitchen because we were infested, which is true, by the way, and some of it, accidentally fell into a pot.
In all of this shit, I forgot that you hate me.<eos> But you're talking to me.<eos> So does this mean you don't hate me anymore?<eos> It means that I'm not holding grudges today.<eos> I'm happy to see you.<eos> No touching!<eos> Ooh, Alex, get that!<eos> - What?<eos> - Get that bug!<eos> Oh, it's a slow one and it's a big one.
And should you ever come back, we'll give you the blue room with a sea view.<eos> So you're leaving, it's final?<eos> - It's a real shame.<eos> - Sure is. Once pigheaded, always pigheaded?<eos> - It was good to see you.<eos> - I hope things improve.<eos> What's that?<eos> The weather!<eos> Sure, it'll clear up soon.<eos> Won't it? Yes, it'll clear up.
They were banned years ago!<eos> Battosai's passed Odawara.<eos> He'll come through the village.<eos> Probably.<eos> Let's arrange a welcome.<eos> Could I have my sword back?<eos> How?<eos> It's of no use to anyone but me.<eos> Yeah, sure!<eos> If you're still keeping it now that swords are illegal, that means it's valuable.
Still being paid.<eos> Well, they had Christmas without you.<eos> The Super Bowl.<eos> Pretty soon it's gonna be Easter.<eos> You know, I've been there.<eos> You don't want to be damaged goods.<eos> I tried to get a hold of you.<eos> Why? I spoke to Clara.<eos> Thank you for solving that problem.<eos> I bailed it out, but I think it's irreparable.
Okay, that makes sense.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys need to work this out.<eos> And, Hannah, you got to come over and see Marnie's new shitbox.<eos> Mom.<eos> I'm, like, unrelentingly itchy.<eos> Is that a road trip thing?<eos> What do you have the rocking chair for?<eos> Uh, I wasn't hungry, so I bought a souvenir.<eos> It's a rustic souvenir.

Well, they probably weren't thinking about your book, Hannah, and I pretty much can't believe you are either. You knew someone.<eos> Like, really knew him.<eos> He came to your birthday party, et cetera.<eos> He wasn't invited to my birthday party.<eos> What?<eos> I think Adam's feeling is that you're callous and disconnected.<eos> Are you feeling anything?<eos> Yes.<eos> Beyond wondering when your book is gonna hit the stands?<eos> It's an e-book, Adam.

Hey, Marn.<eos> What's up? I was just showing Herm your, uh, music.<eos> You were showing him my music fail?<eos> - Is that what you guys were doing?<eos> - I think it's great.<eos> You actually have a better understanding of that song than Edie Brickell did.<eos> - Oh, fuck you, Hermie.<eos> - Hey, come on.<eos> Why would you show him this video, Ray?<eos> Because it's a bold and pioneering form of self-expression.
I am ready for this day to be over.<eos> - Exhausting, isn't it?<eos> - Family.<eos> How are the in-laws? I love his father.<eos> Henry is a doll.<eos> I can tell that she's not the warmest person in the world.<eos> Chris has had a hard time with her. How so?<eos> Yeah, she seems a little crazy.<eos> - And what about that dress?<eos> - I know. It's awful, isn't it?
I'm merely a passenger on this ride.<eos> Still looking out for yourself, I see.<eos> I believe they call it "looking out for number one." And yes indeed, I am.<eos> Something you should be thinking about doing, too.<eos> All I'm thinking about is snapping your neck.<eos> Mm. I like that.<eos> The ones that try to fight back are the most fun.<eos> Hmm. Well, then you're gonna have a blast with me.<eos> I believe Daniel Santos made you an offer.<eos> It still stands.
These are rash, these ones.<eos> But Mr. LeBlanc knows better. Don't you?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You make a public scene, and it won't take long until the cops grab you and bring you back to wherever it is that you came from.<eos> I'm an expert at keeping a low profile.<eos> - Really?<eos> Remember... low profile.<eos> You bitch.<eos> Tell me about the poison.<eos> It won't do you any good.
You can't go anywhere.<eos> - The fuck I can't.<eos> - Please just get back in the bed!<eos> - I need some help in here! - Get the fuck off me!<eos> Hey, sorry to keep you waiting.<eos> It's all right.<eos> I just got here.<eos> Hey, Laura, can I get a cup of coffee?<eos> A few days ago, that building blew up.<eos> Word is it was an ecstasy lab.
Another night, another drunk bigot to emasculate.<eos> You almost made it through the whole song.<eos> You're getting better.<eos> - Fuck you. - You, too.<eos> So this is her?<eos> Job, Ana.<eos> Ana, Job.<eos> Hello.<eos> Honey, you're much too hot to be shopping retail.<eos> That dress means well, but it's cut all wrong.
Do you regret your choices?<eos> I mean you are a respected professional.<eos> You made it.<eos> Fulfilling your dreams require lots of hard choices.<eos> Pain over a break up will fade, but you need to ask whether putting him before yourself is something that you'll regret.<eos> Did you find anyone who wears a size 25 clown shoe?<eos> No, but I did find skin cells under the victim's fingernails.<eos> Looks like enough to give us a DNA profile of his attacker.<eos> Hmm. What about the beige powdery stuff?<eos> We ran it through the gas spectrometer. It's paint.
I'm a police officer, and I'm gonna take you home, okay?<eos> Okay, get him out of here.<eos> [GROANING]<eos> Contact wound.<eos> Put the gun right to his own head.<eos> Saved us a whole lot of trouble.<eos> [POLICE SIREN WAILS]<eos> KORSAK:<eos> Looks like he was doing construction.<eos> Probably planned to sell the family home once it cleared probate.
LEWIS:<eos> Why were you in the woods?<eos> And we...<eos> Wha... He said it again. "We."<eos> There's no way that kid was out there by himself.<eos> And then it got dark.<eos> And I saw a face.<eos> And I got scared.<eos> And the face saw me.<eos> And it was the clown.
If I ran this town, none of this shit would be happening.<eos> I would have thrown you out with the trash.<eos> Sookie Stackhouse, you shameful slut.<eos> You killed Jim sure as if you'd stabbed him in the heart.<eos> Where'd they take them? - Holly and Arlene, which way'd they go?<eos> - They went south.<eos> Alcide went after them, and Sam did too.<eos> Miss Daniels, you need to drink my blood.<eos> - I ain't drinking vampire blood. - No.<eos> But you're hurt and it will heal you, I promise.
Previously on "Dallas"...<eos> The doctor told us you'd been drinking for a while.<eos> - You're right. I need help.<eos> - For your well-being, you're gonna be staying with us at Southfork.<eos> You're fired.<eos> - I'll figure out a way to...<eos> - No!<eos> We're done with you. What's the real reason my father wanted you to seduce John Ross?<eos> He wanted me to get his DNA onto a dress.<eos> Was it this dress?
It was me, Bobby.<eos> I wanted it kept quiet. With all due respect, Sue Ellen, you are not my wife.<eos> We're supposed to be partners, Annie.<eos> You swore you wouldn't keep things from me again.<eos> I... I don't know why I... maybe I was ashamed.<eos> What is it that's so hardwired in you that you keep the most important events in your life secret from your husband?<eos> Southfork is my home!<eos> I was born in this house, and I will protect it and every person in it with my life!<eos> Sending that video was not malicious, Ann.<eos> It was cruel.
Heather, they found him.<eos> Mesquite rodeo. We're heading there now.<eos> Well, well, well, I was just thinking about you.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> I spoke to Candace.<eos> She told you about the dress, then?<eos> What my father was going to do to you.<eos> I got her to give it to me.<eos> I got rid of it for you, John Ross.<eos> You threw it away?
And you made it possible. I couldn't have done it without you.<eos> [laughs] [cellphone beeps]<eos> Huh. Long day at the office, John Ross?<eos> Did you find anything I could use against Elena?<eos> Her record's cleaner than Mother Teresa.<eos> She got a C-Minus in astronomy sophomore year at U.T.<eos> and that is about as dirty as it gets.<eos> But my day wasn't all wasted.<eos> That video of you and Emma,<eos> It was Nicolas Treviño.
Explain it to me.<eos> Who do you think sent this to Meereen?<eos> Who profits?<eos> This is the work of Tywin Lannister.<eos> He wants to divide us.<eos> If we're fighting each other, we're not fighting him.<eos> The pardon was signed the year we met.<eos> Why were you pardoned?<eos> Unless you're saying this document was forged.<eos> It is not forged. Why, then?
I'm afraid to leave.<eos> You shouldn't be.<eos> The Lord of the Vale belongs in the Eyrie, Mother said.<eos> It's not safe outside.<eos> It wasn't safe for her inside.<eos> People die at their dinner tables. They die in their beds. They die squatting over their chamber pots.<eos> Everybody dies sooner or later.<eos> Don't worry about your death.<eos> Worry about your life.<eos> Take charge of your life for as long as it lasts.
Welcome back, Lord Baelish.<eos> Uncle Petyr!<eos> My lord.<eos> Oh.<eos> I have brought you a gift.<eos> Lord Baelish.<eos> - My lady.<eos> - Look what Uncle Petyr brought me.<eos> A beautiful gift for a beautiful boy.<eos> It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance, Lady Arryn.
Loose!<eos> ( screams )<eos> Down!<eos> ( screaming )<eos> ( laughs )<eos> ( screaming ) No!<eos> No!<eos> To the gate.<eos> Come on, let's move.<eos> It's gonna open.
They'll flay you.<eos> They'll make it last days.<eos> You're right.<eos> It's a bad plan.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> They held the gate.<eos> Get some brothers down here to help you.<eos> We need to burn the bodies.<eos> Raise the outer gate.<eos> Then lower it again as soon as I'm out.
Morning.<eos> I like your sword.<eos> Are we getting close to the Bloody Gate?<eos> About 10 more miles.<eos> Did you hear that, Podrick?<eos> Only 10 more miles to the Bloody Gate.<eos> Are you a knight? No.<eos> But you know how to use that sword?<eos> I do.<eos> Does it have a name?
I wouldn't need a cabin.<eos> Please.<eos> I could work scrubbing the floors...<eos> I'm not going north, child.<eos> I'm going home.<eos> - Where's home?<eos> - The Free City of Braavos.<eos> Wait. I have something else.<eos> - More silver won't make a difference.<eos> - It's not silver.
Each side asks for the outrageous and they meet somewhere in the middle.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> Just give him everything. If he agrees to be castrated.<eos> He'll let you stay in the house if you buy him out.<eos> I can't possibly afford that.<eos> Or split 50-50 if you sell.<eos> I have to move out?<eos> I am that house.<eos> It's like asking me to move out of me.<eos> - Maybe it's too big now.
Sorry.<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm lost.<eos> Wendy, how do you know if you put in enough salt and pepper when you're making a stew?<eos> - You taste it. - Right.<eos> So what do you do when you lose track of which way the car is pointing when you parallel park?<eos> You taste it?<eos> You just let the car move back a tiny bit and see which way it goes.
- Tantric Yoga.<eos> - I do Ambien.<eos> I knew you'd be clever.<eos> I love your reviews.<eos> By the end, I always feel like I've read the book.<eos> Well, that accounts for the drop in sales.<eos> I read a lot of e-books. Download 'em all the time.<eos> I like to hold the book in my hand.<eos> Well, me too.<eos> It has to be the right book, though.
We need to prepare.<eos> According to Sophie Deveraux, as Davina self-destructs, she'll cycle through 4 stages that represent the 4 elements that bound together the harvest.<eos> - The earthquake? - Yes.<eos> Earth stage comes first.<eos> Then comes wind, and since each stage is more intense than the last, Let's just say you'll blow the roof off this place.<eos> The after the wind is water.<eos> Rain, flood.<eos> How bad?<eos> Quite bad actually, but that's not the worst of it.<eos> The last stage is fire, and since it's the last...

How then would the film be finished?<eos> Oh, Claudio.<eos> I wasn't really scared.<eos> Honey, I'm in our home.<eos> Can't hear you, I'm shaving my legs.<eos> I'm sorry, it's a little... Late.<eos> That's what time it is.<eos> You lost track of time again, editing that crap. It is my work.<eos> I must do it, no matter how long it takes.<eos> It's filth.
I can tell you a thing or two about Rey.<eos> He was an up and coming editor before I met him.<eos> Before he almost killed his assistant, Giuseppe.<eos> Mr. Ciso, I think I found the film you wanted.<eos> Mr. Ciso...<eos> Mr. Ciso.<eos> Have you heard of Plato's cave, Inspector?<eos> I think I've seen it, yeah.<eos> It's not a film.<eos> Though it should be.
Yeah.<eos> He knew what I wanted before I did.<eos> Excuse me, Wizard!<eos> I must have a word with you about the editor and your so-called superstition.<eos> I need a little help with the Latin here but...<eos> Tenebras Quam Luciem Tuam Movendi est Vita?<eos> You fool, you mustn't say these words!<eos> It's just a bit of fire, what's the big deal? No.<eos> You shouldn't have brought this book here.<eos> It must be destroyed, like the others. Wizard, come now.
Get a hold of yourself.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> Now I've got him.<eos> Oh, no you don't.<eos> Hold it right there, Editor.<eos> Thought you got away from me, did you?<eos> To bring forth. Summoning demons.<eos> A bunch of bullshit some priest told me.<eos> I read your book.<eos> It's all so stupid it makes me want to shoot you.
- or a different time.<eos> - The same day.<eos> Hey, Marcy, hey.<eos> You remember Krull, right?<eos> 'Ello, missus.<eos> What the fuck is he doing here?<eos> Um, why are you being so rude to a guest in our home?<eos> Um, because the last time this guest was in our home, he asked me to give him suction.<eos> Ah, okay.<eos> Well, ahem... it wasn't exactly our home at that time, if you recall.
You're acting like a brat.<eos> Stop it.<eos> You're bringing a lot of negative energy into my new home.<eos> Oh, this is not a home.<eos> This is a refugee camp.<eos> Seriously, what are you doing here?<eos> You don't know what a cool Brooklyn loft looks like.<eos> I just don't understand why you left your old apartment.<eos> The neighborhood was so much better.<eos> It got too expensive.
He's not the one I'm worried about.<eos> His vitals are all over the place.<eos> He... probably won't make it through the night.<eos> Peter.<eos> I'm going to ask you some questions.<eos> If you can't speak, try to nod yes or no.<eos> - Do you have a T1 link here?<eos> That's too bad.<eos> It's gonna take forever to upload this data back to Atlanta.<eos> We don't have a T1 because it's obsolete.

Open the bag.<eos> What the hell?<eos> That won't happen again; you have my word.<eos> No, Sarah, it's OK.<eos> I've been around some nasty hot agents, but I've never seen anything like that.<eos> - No one has seen anything like this.<eos> - You still thinking retrovirus?<eos> Looks more like some kind of hemorrhagic fever.<eos> Blood loss is consistent with Ebola or Marburg, but... this kind of tissue degradation...<eos> This thing doesn't kill, it annihilates.
We've followed her here from the Palace.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> That's just Philippe's mother!<eos> Are you certain that's the woman who came to visit your husband?<eos> Yes!<eos> Constance is in there on her own.<eos> Marie, Her Majesty fell ill on her journey to Fontainebleau, and I was afraid she would lose the child.<eos> And the court officials?<eos> Rushing to make it in time for the birth.<eos> But when the child was born, it was deformed.
In fact, she was quite adamant on the matter.<eos> What do you say, Cardinal?<eos> The Queen's mercy is a lesson to us all.<eos> Provided the Count himself has no complaints to make?<eos> I am... content simply to return home with my beloved daughter Charlotte.<eos> I hope never to hear another word of this matter again.<eos> My own sentiments entirely.<eos> Er... the Queen would like to rest in private. We will celebrate later.<eos> I'm convinced this baby will be born strong and healthy... like his father.<eos> It will be a boy.
Two weeks ago, an invisible dome crashed down on Chester's Mill, cutting us off from the rest of the world.<eos> Why the dome is here or what mysteries lie ahead, we still don't know.<eos> Every day it tests our limits, bringing out the best and the worst in us.<eos> Some say we'll be stuck here forever, but we will never stop fighting to find a way out.<eos> Chester's Mill sentences Dale Barbara to death.<eos> The egg... it's doing something.
Heard you kids helped out over at the fire tower today.<eos> I wanted to, uh, I wanted to thank you for pitching in.<eos> It was Ms. Pine's idea.<eos> Whatever works.<eos> I also heard you lost your house.<eos> I wanted to let you know that my home is your home.<eos> It might get a little cozy, but, uh...<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Come live with you?<eos> Well, at least it's a, uh, it's a roof over your heads.
- Do I have to explain in Armenian?<eos> Do you want to find your son's murderer or not?<eos> Don't waste your time then.<eos> You've wasted enough time already.<eos> What if another family is tied up somewhere?<eos> Have you thought about that? What are you saying?<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> The alginate is ready.<eos> - He has to answer first.<eos> It has to go in now, it hardens immediately.
- Christ.<eos> Oh God.<eos> That's all piss.<eos> They're clothes.<eos> Bloody hell, the disgusting bastard!<eos> Patient fixated on delusion that he is a new variety.<eos> The new stage in the evolution that no longer has man's weaknesses.<eos> He sees his impotence as an attack by female hormones to prevent evolution.<eos> Prolactins are female toxin.<eos> It's heavy, falls to the ground.

Damn it, you scared me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I still have a key.<eos> So I have a proposal for you.<eos> A business proposal.<eos> I want to buy KD.<eos> Whitney is selling it, and I was talking to Bay, and she's right, I have tons of ideas, and I know that I could take it to the next level.<eos> You're always saying that the money is ours.<eos> And I finally feel that way.<eos> That it is ours.
Drink this.<eos> - Okay.<eos> And down.<eos> Watch it. Be careful.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Why are there sticks here?<eos> Those are field hockey sticks.<eos> - What's field hockey?<eos> - It's a sport at Carlton that you're joining.
Santos is going to pay dearly for this.<eos> Sorry, I'll just...<eos> You going to answer that?<eos> Hello?<eos> Why don't you ask him yourself?<eos> Go ahead.<eos> How did you like my gift? You sick bastard.<eos> Why did you kill Dennis Stillwell?<eos> Technically it wasn't me.<eos> But you've got to admit, it's an attention grabber.
Here you go.<eos> Hibiscus tea?<eos> Yeah, it's good for you.<eos> It's strong.<eos> It's too much?<eos> - We've got some chamomile.<eos> - No, this is good.<eos> It'll replace my Cabernet cravings for the next six months.<eos> Yeah, and our little girl will come out with a taste for the finer things.<eos> So you think it's a girl?
I want to live like you.<eos> And I want you to live, period.<eos> Think about it.<eos> We could have it all.<eos> - You could be Alpha.<eos> - You really think I care about that?<eos> You could settle do...<eos> We could settle down.<eos> The house on the hill don't mean nothing if you're not in it.<eos> No, it's too dangerous.
What're you doing?<eos> I'm disabling all the CCTV surveillance in this place.<eos> I can't be spotted.<eos> I also have to keep tabs on other me.<eos> I can do that by tracking his cell phone.<eos> Oh and get the suit.<eos> Ooh, what happened to your face?<eos> Huh?<eos> Your uh, your face.<eos> What, is it bad?
How many times I gotta tell ya?<eos> You can't just take the sheets off of one bed and stick 'em on another.<eos> It's "unsanitory."<eos> I shake 'em out first.<eos> You don't have the sense God gave a clam, do ya?<eos> Go shovel the walk.<eos> - I need a room.<eos> - Just you?<eos> - Pardon?<eos> - Is it just for you, the room?
It's a red tide, Lester, this life of ours.<eos> The shit they make us eat... day after day, the boss, the wife, et cetera, wearing us down.<eos> If you don't stand up to it, let 'em know you're still an ape deep down where it counts, you're just gonna get washed away.<eos> Phone call, Chief.<eos> It's the wife.<eos> - Hey, hon.<eos> - White.<eos> - White what?<eos> - I decided we're gonna paint the nursery white.<eos> - It's already white.
These woods are full of them.<eos> Something poisonous.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> A spider bit me?<eos> Yes, well, I'm so sorry.<eos> Where's my phone?<eos> - Phone?<eos> - I gotta make a call.<eos> Well, I'm afraid the doctor stepped on it and broke it.<eos> I'm afraid it lies in pieces.
The spider bit you.<eos> I want to talk to this guy.<eos> Where's the doctor? I want to talk to him.<eos> Well, uh, the doctor's making his rounds.<eos> Rounds?<eos> What rounds?<eos> We're in the middle of nowhere!<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. No, we're not.<eos> No, we're not, Mr. Bryton.<eos> I've been to the middle of nowhere, and it is a ghastly place.
Well... you know... I was thinking... the melancholy of losing a limb... must be akin to mourning a close friend... that you too often took for granted.<eos> There was no spider, was there?<eos> Yes, there was.<eos> A brown recluse.<eos> Colloquially called the, uh, hobo spider.<eos> That's interesting.<eos> You saw it?<eos> Yes.<eos> You saw the spider?<eos> - I just wish that I'd spied the little creature... before it so viciously attacked you.
So he's in it, you're in yours, and you have to have one of them walrus fights.<eos> Where you slam each other-<eos> And we start saying, "Is man indeed a walrus at heart?"<eos> You ultimately get him and-<eos> But then what has to happen at the end is... once he makes that switch, he can't go back.<eos> Like the clinic for the criminally insane or something like that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> And you see, like, his buddy-<eos> He's got something wrapped in a newspaper, and then he opens it-<eos> It's a fish.
You ready to work?<eos> I'm gonna go check on inventory.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Oh, thank God.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Did you bring the beer?<eos> - Coronas, right?<eos> No!<eos> No, no, no, dark beer.<eos> It's supposed to be dark beer.
It's only a matter of time before I start using Peter's police helmet as a coal scuttle.<eos> If you need help, please ask.<eos> We seem to have a surfeit of olive oil, at least.<eos> One feels one should be able to manage. You do!<eos> Besides, you promised all volunteers would be fed and watered. I'm in it purely for the cakes.<eos> You checking up on me or something?<eos> I only saw you this morning.<eos> I should have given you our delivery pack.<eos> It's important it's kept clean, dry and close at hand.<eos> Shall I take it through to the bedroom?
- It's one of her nicer days.<eos> Well!<eos> So where you taking me to dinner?<eos> I get off at 7.<eos> Meet me at the café across the street.<eos> Okay.<eos> You'll think of something.<eos> See you tonight then.<eos> What is this Magic Fabric?<eos> Well, it's a scarf, a kerchief, a bandana, a scrunchie, a bandeau and a headband.
Is there another dermatologist in your office?<eos> Fine, thank you.<eos> Everything okay? How about a cocktail?<eos> Good morning.<eos> Brigitte.<eos> What a surprise.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - I'm okay.<eos> I forgot my cell phone.<eos> I know, it's in my jacket.
They're all locked up because they're insane. Ha.<eos> Can you at least try to be helpful, please?<eos> For half my childhood, I was locked in a freezer. So, being helpful is kind of a new thing for me.<eos> Hey, dude, are you still milking that?<eos> - Yeah, maybe I am still milking that.<eos> - Hi. Hi, sorry.<eos> I couldn't help overhearing what you guys were talking about.<eos> And I think I actually might know what you're talking about.<eos> There's a Tibetan word for it.<eos> It's called "Bardo."

Accused of espionage in the service the League of Free Worlds.<eos> Get it.<eos> A traitor.<eos> In addition, you?<eos> Job Raizman.<eos> You die the first.<eos> It is a tongue of fire.<eos> - What?<eos> - This is the name of this creature.<eos> It feels the vibrations and attack.
You've got to get out of here!<eos> Gruff!<eos> Nyx.<eos> Snodgrass.<eos> No, Gruff!<eos> Wrong way!<eos> We have to go!<eos> Okay.<eos> New game, Gruff.<eos> It's called Chase the Fairy!
it can wait. I'll come back.<eos> Fawn, I'm glad you're here.<eos> So am I.<eos> Nyx has discovered a dangerous animal in Pixie Hollow.<eos> We could really use your expertise.<eos> I am on the verge of perspiring over here.<eos> Do you see the signal?<eos> I had my first direct sighting earlier today.<eos> This is no ordinary predator we're talking about.<eos> It's bigger and faster than anything we've ever seen.
The artist had a vivid imagination.<eos> This way, please.<eos> And this will be your room, Mr. Thornton.<eos> And just like the rest of the house, it has been appointed with priceless heirlooms.<eos> Uh, the rug. Ah!<eos> Why, the quilt on the bed.<eos> Lovely.<eos> And even my wrap.<eos> Hand-knitted by my great great grandmother in the traditional O'Malley family weave, handed down from generation to generation.<eos> And this is why I ask all of my guests to treat my home as if it were their very own.
So you can laugh at me again?<eos> I didn't laugh before.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam! GRACE:<eos> Well, now, what's all the noise about?<eos> Sam's gone.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.<eos> What have you done with my shawl?<eos> I hung it in the bathroom.<eos> Well, it's not there.
I didn't laugh before.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam! GRACE:<eos> Well, now, what's all the noise about?<eos> Sam's gone.<eos> Oh, I'm sure he's around here somewhere.<eos> What have you done with my shawl?<eos> I hung it in the bathroom.<eos> Well, it's not there.<eos> Of course it is, Mom, I put it there when I got home last night...
My men pulled it out of the ground!<eos> Your men pulled it out of O'Malley ground.<eos> And according to the original town document, which I just happen to have at the museum, as long as there's an O'Malley, it belongs to him.<eos> We'll see about that!<eos> Simon, call my lawyers.<eos> Shut up, Howard.<eos> You're wrong, Mom.<eos> This stuff doesn't belong to me.<eos> What do you mean, Sam?<eos> It belongs to the whole town.
I'll be OK.<eos> No, I'll wait for you.<eos> Oh, it's you.<eos> We're having tea.<eos> Come in.<eos> It won't take long.<eos> "I'm Alice, I have a fashion diploma.<eos> "I am self-taught.<eos> I work with crochet and wool.<eos> "My life depends on this." A bit much, isn't it?
It's fashion that interests me.<eos> But that's different.<eos> It's useful.<eos> So is art, but...<eos> It's interesting, but it has no direct use.<eos> It opens minds.<eos> On the contrary, it's vital.<eos> Fashion can be art, too.<eos> No. I don't agree.<eos> However nice a dress is, it's still a costume.

I've been away a lot, but I had to.<eos> After the exhibition it'll be OK.<eos> - And you've got your diploma.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You smell nice.<eos> Harold made me a perfume.<eos> Harold made you a perfume?<eos> Linked to Queen Mathilde.<eos> It wasn't really for me.<eos> It suits you.
And then if you're not too busy after school, maybe you could come by and give me your physics notes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Mr. Fitz?<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Please come in.<eos> And close the door.<eos> Where's my book?<eos> Okay, it was right here.
You all right?<eos> Never better.<eos> When you put a tail on somebody, you shouldn't trust it to an amateur.<eos> I'm not as used to walking the streets as Mona is.<eos> Come over here and say that.<eos> Mona, how about fixing our guests a drink?<eos> My own juice blend.<eos> Made me what I am today.<eos> I thought you only drank board shorts ale.<eos> When I can get it.
I'm afraid of being alone.<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Me, too.<eos> What if people find out?<eos> Then they will be insanely jealous of me.<eos> Of me.<eos> Of us.<eos> All-night answering service?<eos> Yes, it is.
She already has the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> In the book?<eos> Where in the book?<eos> Look at the pages.<eos> Don't look at the book, look at the pages.<eos> That's the same thing.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> We were supposed to find it. But why give the book back after going to all that trouble to steal it?<eos> Because now it's a trojan horse.
Well, ezra didn't try to kill alison.<eos> His whole book is trying to piece together who did it.<eos> How is he gonna do that When the police can't even figure it out?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He has a theory though.<eos> And?<eos> What is it?<eos> He thinks that one of us did it.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> Well, now we know it's a work of fiction.
She's having a family crisis.<eos> Yeah, I heard she flipped out in fitz's class today.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's been under a lot of stress at home, But she'll be okay.<eos> So can you slot me in?<eos> Yeah, my parents are going out tonight, So why don't I call you After aria's and we make dinner?<eos> Great.<eos> Do you always carry that much cash around?<eos> Oh, um... It's a late birthday present from my grandma.<eos> I need to deposit it.<eos> It's on the list.
And I kind of expected it would be Aria.<eos> He should have told her about the book a long time ago.<eos> When did you find out?<eos> Around the time I bought Jenna's car.<eos> But I didn't want to help him with his tattle-tale, I wanted to stop him.<eos> Or at least, stop the parts that included me, some of the stuff I did, I could still go to jail for.<eos> So we made a deal.<eos> I would answer questions about my exploits, and he'd edit out anything I did that was less than legal.<eos> Did you read the book?<eos> Do you know what it says about Alison?
I didn't want to drag Mike into my mess, so I let him go.<eos> You went through all that and got nothing?<eos> Not nothing.<eos> It's murky, but it's big.<eos> Remember, after the lodge burned down,<eos> I told you all that someone stole the game from me when I was in Radley?<eos> We all thought it was CeCe. I never found out.<eos> But whoever it is, Ezra thinks he knows.<eos> This is a copy of my manuscript.<eos> Thanks, but I think I'll wait till it's in the clearance bin.
Don t pull this trick again.<eos> Are we clear?<eos> Are we clear?<eos> We re clear.<eos> Has your daddy s car ever broken down?<eos> Once.<eos> He was so angry he kept kicking it.<eos> - And then what happened?<eos> - We took it to the shop.<eos> It turned out to be the engine.

Well, blood is a lot like an engine, you see. It s made up of different things.
No.<eos> Who cares?<eos> Let's go.<eos> I danced my first pow-wow with your mom.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> My grandmother made me a new blanket with long, red fringe, and Maria taught me the blanket dance, and we did it.<eos> I think you'd already left.<eos> Probably.<eos> Anyways, it was my first and my last pow-wow.
- Do appreciate your time.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Sorry I couldn't be more help.<eos> You had a lot of pills in that stash, you know.<eos> Yeah, I got somethin' in the works.<eos> For what?<eos> I'll tell you when it's time.<eos> You need me to go to another dorm this weekend?<eos> Nah.<eos> If it's another pharmacy or whatever, I can help out.
I know... probably save it, anyway.<eos> Yeah, for what?<eos> I don't know... a house or somethin'.<eos> Another round?<eos> Yeah, keep 'em comin', hun?<eos> A house, huh?<eos> You mean, meth?<eos> Me and my girl wanna get our own place.<eos> We're gonna have a kid soon.<eos> It's supposed to be born on Christmas.
Are you gonna rape and murder us?<eos> Keep it in your pants, Scissorhands.<eos> Me next!<eos> Me next!<eos> If you don't mind, I prefer it in a chocolate factory.<eos> That's brutal.<eos> Now that's what I call a deep throat.<eos> That means a dozen gone in the first eight hours, Stephen A, and I think I smell an alliance forming.<eos> What the fuck do you mean, an alliance?<eos> If it's supposed to be every man for himself, they ain't gonna create no fucking alliance.
And that's what I thought about Michael and Michelle Roland.<eos> But they discovered my plans.<eos> So, Roland created a ring and a magic spell that could fight off my ghosts and keep me trapped here in this cemetery.<eos> So, I decided to make them more like us, ghosts.<eos> That way, they could never interfere with my plans again.<eos> The two little Rolands got away and as long as they were free, I couldn't get the parents to tell me where they hid the ring!<eos> When Max Doyle's family moved into the Roland house my cat Mauler was stuck there, lost without me, his master.<eos> And to top it off, that snotty little Max recovered the ring and now uses it to protect those kids!<eos> That brat, Max, foiled my plans before, but this time I know his secret.<eos> It's that ring he wears on his right hand.
Get it down!<eos> I got it.<eos> Let's get out of here and check this stuff out at my house.<eos> Yes!<eos> Hey, Max.<eos> Cammy?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was just...<eos> I wanted to check out your haunted house.<eos> But you couldn't wait till it was open?
I got it.<eos> Let's get out of here and check this stuff out at my house.<eos> Yes!<eos> Hey, Max.<eos> Cammy?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I was just...<eos> I wanted to check out your haunted house.<eos> But you couldn't wait till it was open?<eos> It's scarier this way.
Can't wait for our haunted house date.<eos> Hmm? Hey, Max!<eos> Look what we got!<eos> The Nocturnal and Dawn of Angels.<eos> Is that awesome?<eos> Yeah, it is!<eos> And you're the first guy we want to play with.<eos> Yeah, you are!<eos> Uh, guys?<eos> It's full HD.
It's just my neck.<eos> You okay?<eos> That was so cool, but are you okay, Max?<eos> Is Max okay?<eos> He just dropped from the ceiling and used me like an airbag and you want to know if Max is okay?<eos> I just had to get up the rope to pass, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> So?<eos> Then I'm way more than okay.<eos> Once this class picture goes into the yearbook, it's gonna haunt you forever, all right?
So, Max, how'd you do on the dreaded rope test?<eos> Well, guess you could say it ended with a big bang.<eos> But I passed.<eos> There you go;<eos> Atta boy!<eos> Proud of you!<eos> Aren't you proud of your brother, Colin?<eos> I don't know if I'd say "proud."<eos> And Colin, how was the photo shoot?<eos> Did everyone enjoy it?
Why do I taste syrup?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That's a lot of syrup.<eos> through any of that, Mom.<eos> Sorry. No.<eos> That was great.<eos> But that was great.<eos> I was going with it.<eos> This time I know his secret.<eos> It's that ring...
One Racer.<eos> Come in.<eos> Over.<eos> Works perfect.<eos> Let's get this garbage out of here.<eos> So?<eos> Think she's ready?<eos> I'm telling you, I've gone over every inch of this baby.<eos> This car is tight.<eos> It's gonna blow the doors off everybody.
I can't climb a cliff.<eos> I can't do this alone, Mike.<eos> You're not.<eos> You're not.<eos> How can this be happening?<eos> This weekend totally sucks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I suck.<eos> I promise, first thing that we'll do when we get home is we'll put my phone in the microwave.<eos> It'll explode like fireworks while we make love on the kitchen floor.
He's crazy about you.<eos> - In the summer of '94? - June 12th.<eos> Næstved precincts.<eos> Expect nothing exact.<eos> We keep most things like a museum.<eos> - Tape?<eos> - Do you want to borrow a tape recorder?<eos> Who gave you that dress?<eos> Rikke Hartmann gave it to me.<eos> It is an Elise Gug.

- It looks like ... - Thelma.<eos> There is our link between Ditlev and Alberg.<eos> - Have we got his mobile phone?<eos> - No.<eos> - Kimmie.<eos> - Track the mobile.<eos> Let me see it again.<eos> Yes?<eos> All right.<eos> It's moving north of Copenhagen. What is it?
Should we send a car?<eos> No. It is only a tenant.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> - How many fucking rooms does he have? - Did you look here?<eos> - No.<eos> - There must be a bedroom.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - Do you speak French?<eos> Nihla, is Ulrik sleeping in here with you?<eos> He comes every night, but it is not his bedroom.
Bedazzled locker, dancing bears on parade.<eos> But with arrival day coming, I thought it might be in bad taste.<eos> After the carnival, he won't even look at me.<eos> What did you do?<eos> Nothing I can't think of.<eos> You've been in school a week, and you already have boy problems?<eos> High school is phenomenal.<eos> The tenth anniversary of arrival day is in two days.<eos> Families of the fallen, as well as human and Atrian students who are part of this integration program, are all invited to attend the commemoration, which will be held at the base of the Atrian ship.<eos> Awesome. Like, no one's been allowed near the ship since it crashed.
The video was supposed to be of Atrians telling their arrival day stories.<eos> I'd like to share mine.<eos> That Red Hawk said that humans don't want us here.<eos> Well, I know that's not true.<eos> Because on arrival day, I met a human girl who saved my life.<eos> I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for her.<eos> But if I met her today, we couldn't walk down the street together without causing harm to one or both of us.<eos> That's the reality of our world.<eos> The integration program isn't perfect.<eos> But it has shown me that there are more humans out there like that girl than there are Red Hawks.
If you take off your wristbands, you're not just killing them.<eos> You're killing us!<eos> We're stronger than you think.<eos> Don't listen to her.<eos> She's one of the privileged.<eos> If they come down, she'll have it good.<eos> How many of you can say the same?<eos> We can take care of ourselves.<eos> That wristband on your arm?<eos> It makes you a prisoner.
Wait for pressurization.<eos> Sorry, boys.<eos> Places to go.<eos> Did anyone notice there's no damage to "B" dock?<eos> "B" dock's restricted.<eos> You know that. What, are they gonna float me for looking?<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> An Exodus ship was launched.<eos> You're not curious about that?<eos> It was not launched.

WELLS:<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I've known Clarke her whole life better than you ever will, so, I'll decide when to let it go.<eos> Yeah, I can tell you guys are close.<eos> (BANGING)<eos> What is it?<eos> - It's an automobile.<eos> - CLARKE:<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> This thing's been here 100 years. All right? It can wait.
Can your present-day robots do this?<eos> Uh, no, no, they cannot.<eos> Not sure why they'd want to-- gorbid.<eos> Now, why are you here?<eos> What is your mission, uh, so to speak?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Man, this guy doesn't ask permission-- he just goes right in you.<eos> Eh... aha!<eos> Bender's mission protocol is definitely intact.<eos> It just requires a delicate procedure known as "unplug and re-plug."
- I have ways.<eos> This really gonna be in the paper?<eos> Well, at least in Boston, yeah.<eos> Don't see why anybody would care.<eos> Well, it's a personal interest story.<eos> Vice President of the United States comes here, of all places.<eos> - You mean this shithole?<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's not the Taj Mahal.
The vice president is on the line.<eos> Mr. Vice President.<eos> Normally, I would ignore your call, but I am in a good mood today.<eos> - Not even you could ruin it.<eos> - Are you funneling money to the Republicans?<eos> What on earth are you talking about?<eos> About 20 million in GOP Super PACs.<eos> You know I never make political contributions.<eos> That's the fastest way to upset my investors.<eos> I know the money is coming from a casino in Missouri, and I know it's coming from Feng.
And then you'd have a share of the profits if we're successful.<eos> - What would the shares be?<eos> - I tell you what.<eos> Let me draw up papers, you look them over, you show them to your lawyer.<eos> - I don't have a lawyer.<eos> - You should get one.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're being cheated.<eos> You're skeptical.<eos> Look...<eos> Money usually don't come through that door, unless it's looking for a plate of ribs.
- He did what?<eos> - All of them, aparently.<eos> I just managed to get him back into his cell.<eos> - Oh, boole for you.<eos> - Yes, but, the way he's acting... and.. Beswick, sir.<eos> I... that guy in cell six, I don't know...<eos> Don't you worry, Constable.<eos> I'll be with you very soon.<eos> The dark of the last night does not fall.<eos> It rises up.
- Delirium?<eos> - Uh, no.<eos> I mean, he's in and out of it, but, uh, I don't know, it's hard to say.<eos> He just...<eos> He's stuck back there.<eos> Are these the viral load comparisons?<eos> They were declining after the SODRA infusions took hold, but now...<eos> This looks like the virus is coming back - with a vengeance.<eos> You knew we were taking a chance. - I'm sorry.<eos> - But it was working.
I share your hope, Madame.<eos> To the King, musketeers.<eos> I'll see you later, Mademoiselle.<eos> Come, your Eminence.<eos> I'm late, I know.<eos> Our prey escaped, but I didn't want to give up.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> 3 hours of hunting for nothing.<eos> That beast was clever.<eos> Maybe it knew we were coming.
The king and the cardinal suspect me of treason.<eos> They threaten to take away my child.<eos> Calm down, your Highness.<eos> No one will talk. We all took an oath.<eos> Oaths are worth little in prison.<eos> You must help me, Father.<eos> - What can I do?<eos> - Here.<eos> Take this document.<eos> Get it into the cardinal's hands.
Now, you want to hunt?<eos> Let's hunt.<eos> I'll be right here.<eos> So, what do you call this decor, anyway?<eos> Rustic obsessive?<eos> Paranoid deco?<eos> Here we go.<eos> Looks like my dad was working with another hunter when he nabbed Abaddon's pet.<eos> I guess the "T" didn't stand for terrible father.<eos> It stood for --
Sam?<eos> Sam?<eos> ! Keep going.<eos> Why?<eos> We -- we -- we have to find Gadreel.<eos> No.<eos> Why must the Winchesters run toward death?<eos> No, don't.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Sam, when I was human, I died, and that showed me that life is precious, and it must be protected at all costs, even a life as... as pig-headed as a Winchester's.
Why?<eos> Because you never give up on family -- ever.<eos> Where's your brother now, then?<eos> I don't know what kind of game you're playing here, and I don't really care.<eos> Just give me the damn blade.<eos> Sorry, Dean.<eos> I have nothing to hand over.<eos> What?<eos> I no longer have the blade.<eos> It's gone.
How?<eos> The spell brought us here to you, so it has to be here.<eos> Your spell brought you to the source of the Blade's power.<eos> Me.<eos> Really? Now?<eos> It's the bloody mark of Cain.<eos> From Lucifer himself.<eos> The mark and the blade work together.<eos> Without the mark, the blade is useless.<eos> It's just an old bone.
Well, I'll stay as long as I can. Aren't you a peach?<eos> I've tried.<eos> I've tried, Colette, to see myself as you did.<eos> But I know who I am --<eos> Seen what I am.<eos> I know you watch over me still.<eos> But I need you to look away now.<eos> What the hell, man?<eos> You in or out? I'm getting head spins.<eos> I can give you the mark, Dean, if it's what you truly want.
You're not the only one who's ever dated someone bendy.<eos> Hey, you have any oatmeal?<eos> Yeah, I wish.<eos> No, but we have, something that's tofu over there.<eos> I... what is that?<eos> It's a pancake.<eos> It's tofu.<eos> I feel like a baby asking this, but...<eos> Will the treatment hurt? Not at all.<eos> The only drawback of cupping is, it leaves a suction mark.

It's just so relaxing in here. It's the aromatherapy.<eos> The lavender really packs a punch.<eos> Geez. That's wa-a-a-rm.<eos> Flojo.<eos> You got time to lean, you got time to clean?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> What do we get to eat?<eos> Same as the clients.<eos> They expect us to eat this rabbit food?<eos> It's not rabbit food.

I've got people coming.<eos> Why don't you get Frank to help?<eos> So...hi.<eos> -It's Scotty, right? -Yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> Where do you want me?<eos> Why don't you grab that chair?<eos> Right up there, yeah.<eos> What is this thing?<eos> It's a piece of shit is what it is.
- Du buffet?<eos> -Yeah.<eos> "Debuffit"?<eos> Well, while we're on the subject of fine art, do you guys wanna see my new tattoo?<eos> - Yes.<eos> -Yes, yes.<eos> My first vote is yes.<eos> I haven't shown it to anyone, but I designed it myself.<eos> Okay.<eos> And it's Dolly Parton's signature.
It's Mary on the other side.<eos> Oh wow. Yeah, I didn't know it was religiousy when... yeah, it's cool.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Cheers.<eos> Two more beers.<eos> - I'm gonna get you drunk tonight.<eos> - Oh yeah? Yeah, it's gonna happen.<eos> Cheers.<eos> I love this song.<eos> I don't know... I don't know who it is, but I love that beat.
The thing I realized... is that you didn't deserve any of that time, not a single fucking minute.<eos> And I'm just pissed that I didn't get that before.<eos> Can we not do this here?<eos> - My clients are...<eos> - I'm sorry. It won't take long.<eos> I really don't have anything else to say, except I want my 8,000 back with 10 years of interest.<eos> - Excuse me? - And what I paid for the peppermint fucking tea<eos> - and the protein box.<eos> - Are you fucking with me?<eos> No, I'm not fucking with you. I gave you that money... and it was a lot of money to me back then.
Fuck!<eos> Look at this thing.<eos> It's huge!
I'm excited for you.<eos> It's about fucking time.<eos> It's what you've always wanted.<eos> - Yeah. -Right?<eos> Tell me how much you love chicken.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I fucking love chicken.<eos> - Right?<eos> -It's the queen of meats.<eos> It is the queen of meats.
That's so professional.<eos> Well, some people are good with numbers, they become accountants.<eos> I'm useless with numbers but very good at sex.<eos> You just-- You put it out there.<eos> You got no qualms about telling strangers?<eos> This is what I do.<eos> If I was embarrassed about it, I wouldn't do it.<eos> TAJ: it's a hard fucking sell, Dom.<eos> Does anyone even know what Portuguese chicken is?<eos> - It's a Peri-Peri.
-Hello.<eos> So can we-- Can we talk for a sec?<eos> Uh, can I get you a beer?<eos> You can buy me lunch.<eos> You got any cash on you?<eos> - What?<eos> -Please.<eos> He is-- Where would you like to go?<eos> You know, I've always loved to cook, and my dad was an amazing cook and actually had a restaurant.<eos> It was in this gnarly, old gas station off the I-5, but it was the best Peri-Peri chicken you've ever had.
You know this is God's punishment, right?<eos> - AGUSTIN:<eos> For what? - For hiring a hooker.<eos> AGUSTIN: You know, if God exists, I hope she has better things to do than give people the explosive shits.<eos> Can you-- Can you give me like-- like a Coke or something?<eos> My stomach is very unhappy right now.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll meet you out there.<eos> So tell me about this project.<eos> Is it about rentboys?

I was a fat kid, remember? That's right.<eos> Oh, and there was a song, too.<eos> There's a song?<eos> Mm-hm. It's educational.<eos> Will you sing it to me?<eos> Please?<eos> Yeah... (SINGS IN SPANISH)<eos> I can't believe I remember that.<eos> How does it go?<eos> What does it say?
Oh, no, come on.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - What is it? I didn't turn my wheels. - Fuck.<eos> -Oh, God.<eos> - I can pay for half of it.<eos> -No, no.<eos> Don't be silly. I borrowed the car from Dom.<eos> Fifty-eight fucking dollars!<eos> Jesus!<eos> DOM: Okay, so here it is, on the corner.
We're on an island in the middle of the sea, of course there's no signal.<eos> And I thought you said you were only using it to take pictures?<eos> Well I guess I lied, didn't I Luce?<eos> Hey, Bob, are there any interesting stories you could tell me about the island?<eos> Something that's not written in tourist books.<eos> I'm writing an article about Rose.<eos> You're a writer?<eos> That's very cool.<eos> This place was built it in the mid 19th century;<eos> it's been through two wars and it's still standing.
Boban, get away from her!<eos> Alex...<eos> Lucy!<eos> Kelly!<eos> No, no...<eos> Move!<eos> What the hell was that thing?<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> Are you okay? I'll be fine.<eos> It's just that song.
Got it.<eos> Doc said I should be able to interpolate the two sources of data and...<eos> Whoa. What is it?<eos> It's pretty cool.<eos> Except there's no room to hide anything in there.<eos> Hang on. The...<eos> All the pieces are the same color.<eos> Would make it hard to play chess.<eos> This chess set isn't hiding a bomb.<eos> It is the bomb.
From where?<eos> Where are you, Gabriel?<eos> Mumbai.<eos> His name is Ibrahim Al-Munin.<eos> He's a lashkar-e-Tayyiba operative.<eos> He was part of the attacks at the Taj Mahal hotel in 2008.<eos> And now he's here with Malik.<eos> And my wife.<eos> - We can't see her face.<eos> We don't know it's Amelia.
Pull them up yourself.<eos> You know what it's like to lose the person you love.<eos> If you don't help us try to stop this... what are we gonna say to the next Laura and Jenny Hindes?<eos> Okay, it took some digging, but an alternate spelling of Ibrahim's name turned up in the title of a closed senate intel briefing.<eos> - I can't, but Gabriel can.<eos> Means we're on the right track.<eos> - Can you decrypt the files?<eos> Let me take a look.<eos> Ibrahim was married to a medical student in Pakistan.<eos> She was working at a local hospital when it was attacked by a PMF strike team.
Well, only you know that.<eos> Well, what are we going to do then?<eos> If I knew exactly what had happened, I could help you one way or another.<eos> You don't have a witness.<eos> I am trying to figure out how to defend you.<eos> -The man broke into my apartment.<eos> -That's the problem.<eos> Officially, this is not a residential building.<eos> Even the electricity is hooked illegally.<eos> It doesn't have a permit or anything.
- And fit Häschen.<eos> And if he does not get it?<eos> So we explain to him again that it is Salvatore Conte's rules, not mine.<eos> - Donna Imma, excuse me.<eos> - Ciro. I would hear Don Pietro if I can go.<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I say it.<eos> - Good evening.<eos> Listen, Ciro. Like this couch?<eos> Jeez. It is very nice.
- Good choice.<eos> It was not very expensive.<eos> Is it fine that way?<eos> - Thank you. Goodbye.<eos> See you, signora.<eos> - See you.<eos> Should we try the wonder?<eos> Yes, let's try it.<eos> - Is not that a little harsh?<eos> - It's a little stiff, yes.
And, Kent?<eos> You said something about video games?<eos> Yeah, my son's pretty into them.<eos> They're very dangerous.<eos> It doesn't matter what you read, how many studies claim that they're harmless,<eos> I can show you better studies that claim the contrary.<eos> Well, he's on the computer a lot.<eos> Guild Wars, I think?<eos> That's one of the worst ones.<eos> A couple in China played Guild Wars so much they neglected their baby and it died of dehydration.

No, that's all it is, is time!<eos> And I've put in months of my life and I...<eos> - I'm invested now, okay?<eos> - Not anymore, you're not.<eos> - Because I canceled it.<eos> - You mean, you deleted the application?<eos> - Okay, I'll reinstall it.<eos> Thanks, Dad. - No, you won't.<eos> I called my credit card company and told them to delete your account.<eos> So, it's gone.
"Our imagined self-importance,<eos> "the delusion that we have some privileged position in the Universe<eos> "are challenged by this point of pale light.<eos> "Our planet is a lonely speck in the great enveloping cosmic dark.<eos> "In all this vastness, there is no hint<eos> "that help will come from elsewhere to save us from ourselves.<eos> "Like it or not, for the moment, the Earth is where we make our stand.<eos> "There is perhaps no better demonstration of the folly of human conceits<eos> "than this distant image of our tiny world.<eos> "It underscores our responsibility to deal more kindly with one another
- Mom, it's Genny.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - The "celebration" went well.<eos> - When are you coming home?<eos> I'm in the jungle among with the animals.<eos> They are worse than gypsies.<eos> Really?<eos> Did they like the "gift"?<eos> - They didn't receive it yet.<eos> - It's a gift from a "Thousand and One Night" story.
Whatever was behind her... was really there.<eos> Okay, well, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> I mean, how could something be both real and fake at the same time?<eos> Well, a girl is dead, and that's about as real as it gets.<eos> All right, so, the last thing she did was she took a photo on her phone.<eos> How did that photo end up online?<eos> No clue.<eos> It was originally posted to a Thinman fan forum, but the IP address was blocked.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. This thing has fans?<eos> Of course it does.
You know, blogging was fun, but--<eos> But, let me guess, you wanted something more.<eos> You realize what you two jackasses are doing doesn't make you Thinman.<eos> It makes you copycat killers.<eos> It makes me Thinman.<eos> And you're not telling anyone I'm not 'cause you'll be too dead to talk.<eos> Show time.<eos> You two are lucky ducks.<eos> You're the stars of our best video yet.<eos> And when it goes viral everyone will know Thinman's real.
Now play dead.<eos> Henry!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> We did it.<eos> We stopped the demons.<eos> Abaddon.<eos> Did you ever see exactly what she was doing down there?<eos> No, but whatever it was she was doing at St. Bonaventure, it seems to be happening again.<eos> The convent's name was St. Bonaventure? Yes.<eos> Where is it?

There's more where this came from.<eos> More?<eos> My men brought in a runaway last night. There's no ID on her, nothing on her, actually, except for a bus ticket out of Nebraska.<eos> Total Jane Doe. She won't even give me her name.<eos> Girl's basically feral.<eos> She's got zero manners, didn't even thank me for saving her.<eos> Anyhow, this thing went to plenty of trouble to get at her.<eos> And to hear him tell it, the others will want her at least as bad as he did.<eos> - Sounds like a nest. - Yeah.<eos> I'm guessing that's not half as cute and cozy as it sounds.
- It's about Sal.<eos> - What about Sal?<eos> Our brother's dead.<eos> I know what I saw.<eos> And you're sure?<eos> I mean... sure?<eos> 'Cause, what you're tellin' me, about this faceless whatever-it-is?<eos> ENNIS:<eos> That thing had claws.<eos> Look, maybe you got confused. You know, maybe it was some banger with a knife.
Can we talk?<eos> - About what?<eos> Last night.<eos> This thing you think killed Tamara, what'd it look like?<eos> Thing?<eos> You said it was "some banger with a knife."<eos> Chasing down every lead, kid.<eos> (SCREEN DOOR CLOSES)<eos> (DOOR CLOSES)<eos> Like I told you, it didn't have much of a face.
Those don't go in that pile.<eos> You gotta keep it separate, or you're gonna get it confused<eos> - with the other ones, and you...<eos> - Jin!<eos> - I told you...<eos> - Jin.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What you got so far on the video?<eos> [Sighs] Okay.<eos> It was recorded last night.

Trust me.<eos> It may take some time but it's probably for the best.<eos> You said they were liquid cash.<eos> They were AAA and from Finland.<eos> Wait Gennaro.<eos> I think there has been a misunderstanding.<eos> My husband says we need money.<eos> I don't think Don Pietro is fully aware of market developments.<eos> My husband decides.<eos> If my husband wants it, my husband gets it.
But this is Jeremenkos variant of it.<eos> I am part of the system.<eos> If I disappear, it means that we were not in agreement.<eos> Those who sent you, know that you may not return.<eos> You are not particularly important to them Ciro.<eos> Half the chances are better than no chance.<eos> - Fifty fifty.<eos> - Do it.<eos> Look into the light.<eos> When it is turned on, you shoot.
I can't concentrate.<eos> Don't worry, I understand.<eos> Have you called David?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe you could go see him. Help him with his daughter.<eos> I'm scared... of seeing Lucie.<eos> She reminds me so much of Laura.<eos> Dinner was great, thanks.<eos> You hardly ate a thing.<eos> But it was delicious.
Have a good day.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Me, Claire.<eos> Come in.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> - Wearing Laura's perfume? - Yes.<eos> And Laura's dress?<eos> Yes, I let it out.<eos> Like it?
I agreed to go out discreetly.<eos> Not with a 6 foot 4 tranny drawing looks.<eos> What do we do?<eos> Couldn't you just wear pants?<eos> My first time out, I want my legs to breathe.<eos> Where's the other dress?<eos> - Which one?<eos> - The one you let out.<eos> - It's in the hamper.<eos> - Get it. - It's wrinkled!
- So, what next?<eos> - And I get my $95,000?<eos> - By the end of the week.<eos> Just have to wire it from our main account into the LLC, cut a cashier's check for you.<eos> I want to show you this.<eos> It's a mockup of the bottle design.<eos> And we already started on the concept layouts for the Silver Spring location.<eos> - Why's that linoleum peeling up?<eos> - To make it seem real.<eos> Well, I wanted it to look nicer than this.

It's cold.<eos> Never before has me someone regarded like you<eos> No one else will ever me watch like you<eos> A feeling that does not die<eos> Because it's all I've left<eos> Thinks another of you Is the sun bigger<eos> And warms you more<eos> And it beats, it beats hard,<eos> The heart<eos> And maybe it begins like this
Let it off!<eos> That's all?<eos> You stay here until I come back.<eos> Got it?<eos> - Fuck you.<eos> - Got it?<eos> Happy Birthday, big Brother!<eos> Thank You.<eos> Welcome to our hotel.<eos> What it may be?
- And what?<eos> - Nothing. I'm kind of excited.<eos> That's normal.<eos> And what will you sing?<eos> An Italian song from the 60s, "Tutt'al più".<eos> - From Patty Pravo.<eos> - How do you know her?<eos> - It's a long story.<eos> - Why do you need the phone?<eos> - It's for my brother.
- That is everything we could learn From the particle accelerator.<eos> It's a whole new way of looking at physics.<eos> It will literally change the way That we think about everything.<eos> - You got to get yourself a girlfriend.<eos> - Hey, leave him alone. He's working.<eos> - Hi, dad.<eos> Your test thingy is done.<eos> - Yeah. I think the mardon brothers are hiding on a farm.<eos> The fecal matter I found on the street, it was cow manure, Which contained traces of oxytetracycline.<eos> It's an antibiotic.
Fill 'er up?<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> You're awake.<eos> Why didn't s.T.A.R. Labs call us?<eos> - I just woke up.<eos> - Should you even be on your feet?<eos> - Iris, I-I'm okay.<eos> - I watched you die, barry.<eos> You kept dying. Your heart kept stopping.<eos> - It's still beating.
- Do you think that your guns can stop god?<eos> - Why in the hell would god need to rob banks?<eos> - You're right.<eos> I've been thinking too small.<eos> - Barry! Barry! This thing's getting closer.<eos> Wind speeds are 200 miles-per-hour and increasing.<eos> Barry, can you hear me?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Loud and clear.<eos> - If it keeps up, this could become an f-5 tornado.
Used to run things down here for Marcel.<eos> Thought you'd like to see what I found before Klaus did.<eos> Not a day out of the garden, and you're already proving yourself useful.<eos> We made a deal, and if it screws things or your brother, I'm all for it, though, to be honest, this stuff makes my skin crawl.<eos> I've never seen anything like this.<eos> I have, a long time ago.<eos> Somebody is copycatting a very dangerous witch.<eos> They draw their power from sacrifice.<eos> I just don't understand why someone would leave it here for us to find...<eos> Unless they wanted it to be found.
A magnifying glass, a pipe perhaps?<eos> You have a theory that you'd like to share with us, Niklaus?<eos> Back in the day, the witches wanted to send a threat, they'd just kill a chicken and leave it on your doorstep.<eos> It's rather a large and ominous chicken, wouldn't you say?<eos> Papa Tunde defeated Rebekah with ease, almost got the two of us as well.<eos> If he was supposed to be their prize fighter, why leave him for dead in our front yard?<eos> Well, don't you all look cheery.<eos> Listen to this...<eos> A girl literally exploded from a grave today as Sabine was giving her tour of the city of the dead.<eos> It was Monique Deveraux.
Oh I know.<eos> What I didn't know is what a colossal nerd you are.<eos> Hey, Lukas.<eos> Any luck with the phone?<eos> No, I still haven't been able to ping its location.<eos> You know, whoever has it must have turned it off after they left the swim meet.<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. I just...<eos> I still can't believe my father was talking to someone on a Trag phone.<eos> I was hoping my first night in town would give me the chance to find out who it was.
- How out of hand?<eos> Cops!<eos> - Come on, man, let's go! - Come on, move!<eos> Move!<eos> Foot it!<eos> Come on!<eos> Gray, come on!<eos> Good evening, Officer.<eos> The signal echoed back last night, and then again this morning.<eos> Where's it coming from?
Eric, what's going on?<eos> He never made it back to the movie last night, and he wasn't in class this morning.<eos> All right, come on...<eos> Grayson got arrested.<eos> Arrested? For what?<eos> What did you... what did you do?<eos> If you want to know more, you're gonna have to talk to him.<eos> I gotta go.<eos> The phone should be in here.<eos> It's got tech, just like your dad's phone.
They called me.<eos> They want me.<eos> Let me go first, check it out, and you can call whoever you want.<eos> Damn it, Ryan!<eos> What's going on?<eos> It's an empty brownstone.<eos> We have a signal?<eos> Signal is still there.<eos> You're on top of it.<eos> I think it's on top of me.
Why should the sea air only be for the rich?<eos> It's weird seeing you here.<eos> Can I let you into a secret, comrade?<eos> I bought this place with you in mind.<eos> Who knows why I'm telling you now!<eos> The couch folds out? Of course.<eos> Look...<eos> Careful not to trap your fingers.<eos> This way, your own room each.<eos> It's a good mattress.
That was just a maneuver Designed to save our marriage.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> You're a monster.<eos> And yet I seem so nice in my films.<eos> [ grunts ] To recap, If you see rosie again, even one more time,<eos> Got it...<eos> [as rosie] mr. Spence?<eos> Opal, I was hoping we could talk.<eos> Did you know I'm writing a book?<eos> It's about what I went through to get my son out of jail.
Scrapbooking...<eos> But you don't do articles on scrapbooking.<eos> No.<eos> Right...<eos> But it's a good idea.<eos> Could you handle it?<eos> Me?<eos> - I'm going to cry.<eos> - Don't.<eos> It does me good.
You'll no longer be their mother but their wealthy mother.<eos> They'll want a share.<eos> They'll talk about bequests, ways to avoid death duties...<eos> A husband?<eos> Yes.<eos> With a lowly job...<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He'll stop work to handle your fortune.<eos> The fortune you share.<eos> It'll be his as much as yours since he loves you.
I daren't tell anyone.<eos> Humility. That's good.<eos> I'm afraid of changing.<eos> Integrity.<eos> Very good.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> What does the Bible teach us?<eos> There's no harm in being rich but it's wrong to love money.<eos> I don't love it.<eos> It freaks me out!

The blog brings them to the shop to give people a place where they can meet.<eos> You realize what these women expect of you?<eos> I mean...<eos> Excuse me...<eos> Jocelyne, extra thin laces?<eos> Just there.<eos> I mean... you haven't just answered a demand, you've created a need now.<eos> I'm not Mother Teresa just because I started a blog.<eos> I like my simple life.<eos> I wish everyone had one like it. As a minimum.
Quit sobbing, it's your kid.<eos> It's your kid.<eos> Morning!<eos> How are you, darling?<eos> Fine.<eos> What?<eos> Soy milk, that's what.<eos> It'll bring this world down, this soy.<eos> And Styrofoam, of course.<eos> Do they know what's good about it?
Your body and all that in this space. It's fluid, it breathes.<eos> It reminds me of a wave. Yes, a great big wave.<eos> Makes me want to surf again.<eos> I own a gallery. I have 3 paintings in this show.<eos> Hear that?<eos> Hear that music?<eos> It's barely perceptible, but it's the music of life.<eos> And I love life.<eos> What about you?<eos> It's wild, isn't it?
It's your wedding, too.<eos> What've you been doing?<eos> What'd I do all day? Wrong question. I got a contract, so there.<eos> That means I'll do it tomorrow.<eos> But I have to justify myself, 'coz I'm a loser who doesn't deliver.<eos> Give your list to P-A. - He'll deliver.<eos> - What's he got to do with it?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I saw his smutty poem on Facebook.<eos> It's so lousy I was gonna show you.
In August 2011 a tournament featuring the popular online strategy game Dota 2 was held in Cologne, Germany.<eos> It offered the largest prize pool to date attracting professional players from all over the world.
If I'm going to win this tournament my first thought would be... I will call my ex-girlfriend.<eos> Things got real bad between us and... but right now, for me, if I'm going to win this tournament, my first thought would be, yeah, I would call her.<eos> I would tell her about it and... I would want to share this moment with her... yeah.<eos> This tournament is going to be a moment in every gamer's life.<eos> Everything that you've been doing has been building up and is going to happen over one week.<eos> And then it's not one week anymore.<eos> It's one game.<eos> And then it's not that one game. it's that one moment in the game.<eos> And then that one moment in the game is where it's going to finish.<eos> And how's it going to finish?
Every player in the team is strong.<eos> You don't recognize China players as a player.<eos> You just recognize them as a whole team.<eos> You just fear the whole team.<eos> The Chinese teams that have come to this competition are scaring the shit out of everyone else.<eos> We had two of the top Chinese teams in our group.<eos> Online Kingdom has not been regarded as one of the favorites to win it.<eos> In fact, they were considered bottom four or just bottom eight for sure.<eos> This is our first time on LAN together.<eos> The team together has only been around for around 4-5 months so it's a relatively new team, and Pajkatt, our newest addition, playing Carry for us, he's only been on the team for three weeks now actually.
It's going to make my time playing this game all worth it.<eos> Didn't think smoking would do me any good.<eos> When did you start smoking?<eos> Two years back.<eos> Two years back.<eos> Bad move.<eos> That seems to coincide with when you and your ex-girlfriend broke up.<eos> On bad terms...<eos> Seems like she's moved on already.<eos> Back then when she was playing the game it felt like we had something we shared.
It's very hard to get yourself out there.<eos> I mean, back then, I was kind of like a fan boy of him.<eos> You know, watching his games and what-not.<eos> And he gave me a shot to play at a high level.<eos> I wouldn't be here today if it wasn't for Fear.<eos> I can guarantee you that.<eos> ONLINE KINGDOM VS MUFC<eos> ELIMINATION MATCH Going into the match, we were all thinking,<eos> MUFC didn't do so well earlier, but...<eos> If we lost that game, we wouldn't win anything so... it was a high risk game.
There's four heroes standing right next to each other.<eos> The timing is wrong!<eos> There's communication problems because we're an international team.<eos> So I think full-nationality teams have an advantage over most teams.<eos> Almost there!<eos> Big try!<eos> Fear's in trouble though.<eos> He's shackled and Lacoste is in.<eos> He casts his ulti as well.<eos> And it just fell apart from there.
This document, the findings of your Commission, as to the instantaneous disappearance of 2% of the world's population, some 140 million souls, your conclusion as to what happened to them, why them, and where they've gone, is... and I'm paraphrasing here...<eos> "I don't know"?<eos> Sir, I am a scientist, and I was asked to look at data.<eos> In fact, I was asked to identify patterns that weren't immediately obvious and address related events like the Chef Anomaly and the Brandenburg Carousel that were, and still are, considered miracles.<eos> But they are simply statistical hiccups that we can't explain because, sir, in my opinion, miracles do not exist.<eos> Miracles do not exist?<eos> Scientifically speaking, no, sir.<eos> Doctor, pardon my tone, but who are you, sir, to tell the American people that millions of mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters disappeared, gone, in an instant, and that's not a miracle?<eos> What in God's name do you call it?<eos> I don't know, but if you are implying it was a miracle, I am fairly certain, sir, that God sat this one out.
- It's just a lot of work, Chief.<eos> - Dennis, from now on, just say, "I am sorry, Chief.<eos> As of now, I do not know shit." Fine.<eos> I don't know shit.<eos> Now, I got an hour before the meeting, so I'm gonna head over to Animal Control and...<eos> Whoa, whoa, Chief.<eos> You don't have an hour.<eos> - That meeting was rescheduled.<eos> - No!<eos> It starts in 5 minutes.
You know what, Mr. Garvey?<eos> Um, Jill and I have been discussing her whole... attitude thing lately.<eos> - You have?<eos> - Yeah, and, um, we both think that, you know, she's been under a lot of stress and it might actually do her some good to just, you know, come out tonight and have a good time.<eos> Where is this good time happening?<eos> This guy's house,<eos> Jay Dorfman.<eos> - Dorfman?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's, you know, just a small get-together thing, and his parents will totally be there.
It's fucking infested here.<eos> Catfish eat up all the diversity.<eos> Soon there'll be nothing else left.<eos> Son-of-a-bitch catfish.<eos> Want some help?<eos> You want some help?<eos> I didn't bust it.<eos> Of course you didn't bust it.<eos> It's like if I did this.<eos> You have to visualize your target as if it were 12 inches behind itself.
Hey, honey, there you are.<eos> You had us all really worried.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> I'm here to get you there, okay?<eos> Here's what we're gonna do.<eos> Okay, Natalia?<eos> You and me, we're gonna play a little game first, okay?<eos> I don't want to play a game.<eos> Okay.<eos> It's a fun game.
How cool are we right now?<eos> Is that what you want for her... our life, our ridiculous fucking story?<eos> No, Karen, I see no reason to denigrate our beautiful story.<eos> And I have every reason in the world to be mad about the most recent turn of events here.<eos> - Where is that gonna get you?<eos> - I don't know!<eos> It just feels pretty fucking good right now... that's all.<eos> Okay, well, stay angry, then, because you know what?<eos> You're way too fucking old to be dragged kicking and screaming into doing the right thing.<eos> How do you know it's the right thing?
That's sweet... like a bride on her wedding day, huh?<eos> - Like that?<eos> Is that what you mean?<eos> - Charlie.<eos> Maybe I got something going on today too.<eos> Yeah, maybe I'm gonna get fucked today. - Whoo-hoo!<eos> - Will you stop whoo-hooing?<eos> And I told you, I don't want to know about it.<eos> And you better not fuck anyone in my house.<eos> It was my house first, you know.
I just want to make a few friends.<eos> Hey, dude, where the hell have you been?<eos> The police are leaving.<eos> Why are they leaving?<eos> The police?<eos> They must have cleared the building and grounds, which means he's not here.<eos> Who? What are you guys...<eos> He has to be here.<eos> That sound... The buzzing I've been hearing?<eos> It's getting louder.
Happy Mother's Day?<eos> Could it happen again?<eos> I think your Mums are safe for now, thanks to you boys.<eos> But the demon will be back, more powerful than before.<eos> Thanks for that.<eos> I definitely won't be having any nightmares now.<eos> Anyone seen my diary?<eos> You mean your Book of Shadows?<eos> - Interesting reading.<eos> - Give it back.
No.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You're standing on my shirt.<eos> Yo, Zombie.<eos> - You're on my shirt. - Sorry.<eos> - Look what you did.<eos> - I said I was sorry.<eos> - You ripped my shirt.<eos> - Take it easy, Luke.<eos> It's just a shirt;
Your daughter hears things, she sees things, and...<eos> then she closes her heart.<eos> And that's how your book ends?<eos> One big, happy family?<eos> Your kid giving you a "father of the year" coffee mug?<eos> I think it's time for you, Agent Hurst, to go into the hole.<eos> You said I could see my kid.<eos> There you go.<eos> - Where's the money now?<eos> - It's moving.
So let's get that phone.<eos> I'm gonna pick that up.<eos> You want to shoot a federal officer, go ahead.<eos> But do me a favor, aim for this side.<eos> I'm still tender over here.<eos> Do not touch that phone!<eos> Hand over the phone now!<eos> Hand it over!<eos> Step away!<eos> What was it?
Look at that face.<eos> You know what I was just saying to Alan yesterday?<eos> Well, after Kincaid had his "mini stroke" and said he couldn't do the party.<eos> I said, "do you know what I miss?<eos> I miss tasting Harry."<eos> Aww.<eos> That's... that's always nice to hear, isn't it?<eos> Is it, though?<eos> Let's just chat real quick about the event.<eos> So, it's a charity dinner for lupus.
The language-immersion program in his international hotels should've been patented, like, years ago.<eos> I've also made a list of his legal issues.<eos> Let's not be negative.<eos> No, no.<eos> Not negative... just prepared.<eos> And these bullet points are my solutions.<eos> You so want to kiss me right now.<eos> Well, I'm glad you liked it.<eos> I loved it.<eos> But it wasn't as romantic as your hotel Cala d'Or in Majorca.
But you love her, Sam, don't you?<eos> Just like your father did.<eos> Patient clearly experiencing fear... Avoidance...<eos> Not quite ready to face herself.<eos> I said don't turn around.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Get out!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> That house belonged to my mother.<eos> It's stunning.
I'm fine.<eos> I killed my son.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> How could I live with that?<eos> That's my punishment.<eos> This.<eos> I asked them for a day out so... I could see his grave.<eos> They said no.<eos> I just want to see his grave.<eos> It's beautiful.
Big and little.<eos> Absecon inlet to great egg harbor.<eos> Anything else is bad for business.<eos> Here... Is sand. There is a broom.<eos> And this... Is one dollar.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Welcome to Atlantic City!<eos> We got umbrellas, blankets...<eos> You saw what he did with the ear?<eos> Is it still in his pocket?
She was right behind me.<eos> - I didn't see her. - We have to go back!<eos> It's too late.<eos> What exactly are we looking for?<eos> Anything salvageable of Doreen's research.<eos> Any clue as to what she might have discovered before she...<eos> Why else would anyone kill her?<eos> The transgenics lab.<eos> - What about it? - That lab where they found the monkey.<eos> It was totally cleaned out before she had a chance to gather any samples. - She didn't tell you?
Her husband just left her.<eos> Could she stay with us a while?<eos> Of course.<eos> - Family is sacred, my love.<eos> - Thank you, Marguerite.<eos> How are you, Gloria?<eos> Did you have a nice day?<eos> There's champagne left. Help yourself.<eos> Then I'll show you to your room.<eos> Here it is.

Y-O-U space<eos> W-R-O-T-E.<eos> Very good. "Crawfish."<eos> C-R-A- Vv. F-I-S-H.<eos> Very good.<eos> I have a present for you.<eos> I made it for you.<eos> Say thank you.<eos> Say thank you.<eos> It's ugly-

We keep having the same conversation.<eos> It can't be an accident.<eos> Okay. I'm gonna show you something.<eos> CNN tried to get a hold of this. We 86'ed it out of respect to the family.<eos> The footage?<eos> It's not easy to watch.<eos> I want to see it.<eos> She tripped or jumped.<eos> (QUIETLY) She didn't jump.<eos> Here it is, frame by frame.
I could approach Webb, but I don't have enough to offer him.<eos> He'd never drop out. Too much pride.<eos> I'm not sure what to do.<eos> This is my file on Ted.<eos> An illegitimate daughter.<eos> The nanny, of course.<eos> Her name is Emily Rodriguez, 19, cerebral palsy.<eos> I know about Emily.<eos> Well, then why are we having this conversation?<eos> It's complicated.
I've known Ted since I was born.<eos> He and my father were very close.<eos> Yeah, I'm aware.<eos> He's always looked out for me.<eos> He got me into West Point.<eos> He funded my first race.<eos> I like Ted.<eos> He's always been a team player.<eos> It's unfortunate he has this secret.<eos> It was a mistake, one he's always regretted.
I had an etching right there of the Capitol before it was finished.<eos> Took 85 years to complete it.<eos> How long did it take to complete the bridge?<eos> Uh, about four years.<eos> It opened a few months after FDR's second inaugural.<eos> There was a man who got things done.<eos> Strong beliefs. And he stuck to them.<eos> But compromised when he had to.<eos> I assume you're here to talk about Claire's bill.<eos> It's not a pet project.

- What's going on?<eos> - Boomer, out. - Come on, move it.<eos> Move it.<eos> - Hey, hey... Hey, hey, careful.<eos> Just made my bed.<eos> What are they looking for?<eos> - What do you reckon?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Shit, the phone!<eos> - It's under me mattress, Franky.
- Yeah, we're looking after her.<eos> I haven't forgotten about you, Doreen, we'll catch up soon.<eos> Right.<eos> Okay.<eos> I think she might like you, Dor.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Franky, you've got to move that phone.<eos> - I nearly got sprung. - What'd you do with it?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Well, make sure it stays that way.
We have only one request:<eos> you have to restore our company.<eos> There are thousands of good, innocent people out of jobs, and this has nothing to do with them.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Collateral damage.<eos> Look... here's the truth.<eos> This war, it's a thing of the past.<eos> Sometimes I feel like I'm trying to rid the State Department of Communists.<eos> This document is signed by every director in this room.<eos> It calls for a 100-year truce.
I don't want to do this!<eos> You will do as you are tasked.<eos> It is your soul's purpose, because I own it.<eos> Who is this man?<eos> What is this place?<eos> Congratulations, Madame Delphine LaLaurie.<eos> You have been granted your sweet release from the world of the mortal.<eos> And as punishment for your crimes of murder, torture, passion, fashion and being an all-around no-good miserable bitch, you... will spend all of eternity here... in my home.<eos> It is my home.<eos> No... it's mine.
For fear the kids will mess it up, he's forbidden us from coming here, and he keeps it locked.<eos> Republican soldiers from Nantes have taken towns from us.<eos> Their commanding general wears trousers made from tanned Catholic skin.<eos> The windows by my bedroom are blocked.<eos> No one lives there?<eos> Father keeps furniture in those rooms.<eos> Do you know about the rooms next to mine?<eos> Mr de Saint-Hilaire's mad brother was shut up there till he died.<eos> That was years ago.<eos> Now it's a storeroom.

I could be the leader.<eos> We'd beat the Republicans and reinstall the king.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> Where have you been living?<eos> In my wife's absence, I have my headquarters on her estate, where my son lives.<eos> You're more beautiful now than ever.<eos> That's just the candlelight.<eos> I remember every inch.<eos> In the small of your back there's a beauty spot.<eos> You didn't like it, when you saw it in the mirror.
He's always been unreliable. He blows with the wind.<eos> Colonel Jocelyn will be here and the search will begin.<eos> M. de Saint-Hilaire has a boat.<eos> He's leaving for Holland.<eos> A boat could pick up some passengers.<eos> It'd be easy.<eos> And they won't need the summer house.<eos> Henri-Charles wants the passage destroyed.<eos> The wood's dry.<eos> It'll burn easily.
Yes, Doctor? Lukas's lungs are badly burned from the toxic substance he inhaled, and his airways are swollen.<eos> He isn't responding to treatment.<eos> We are running a few more tests, but if we can't get the swelling down soon, he won't be able to breathe air into his lungs.<eos> I'm very sorry.<eos> We're doing everything we can.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Vega's always been reckless, but this is extreme, even for her.<eos> And you planted this. Drake can be trusted.<eos> How can this leaf wipe out an entire race?<eos> It's not the leaf, Roman.
What are you doing?<eos> Is this where you've been the whole time? Uh...<eos> Yeah, I... I hate hospitals.<eos> So I, I got you a new fan belt, new spark plugs.<eos> What you really need is... new everything.<eos> Emery's right, you need a new car. Shh.<eos> Don't listen to him, Bruce.<eos> He doesn't know what he's talking about.<eos> This car has character.<eos> If by character you mean rust... yeah, it has a ton. Cute.
You can ask your questions when it's your turn.<eos> Anyone can be shocked when they get a letter.<eos> After all he could be a tax collector.<eos> He's a good boss, very respectful with his employees, he works a lot, often late into the night.<eos> Normally pick-ups are at the front, but he loaded at the back.<eos> I'm in charge of packages to be picked up by car.<eos> Did he stay for a long time'?<eos> A long time...<eos> I don't know exactly but several minutes for sure.<eos> Julien's cellphone, was it on or off'?
Really?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You must have hated it, that your mother was a shaman.<eos> It used to bother me.<eos> As a shaman, I'm on the threshold between the gods and humans.<eos> So for me, dying is not at all frightening.<eos> Because I know... the place where the gods are.<eos> I'm not afraid.<eos> Your mother's life... is already and always will be intertwined with your life.<eos> It's no longer my life alone. It's always intertwined with your life.

But anyway,<eos> Kaito,<eos> you... and I... are father and son.<eos> That'll never change.<eos> Yeah, that's true.<eos> It is.<eos> Hey, our food's getting cold.<eos> How is it?<eos> It's heavily seasoned.<eos> It's pub food.

And what did he do, he slapped my butt!<eos> Well, Kaito's a Tokyo boy.<eos> He just has no guts.<eos> I offer to teach him to surf, but he never comes by.<eos> Maybe he can't swim.<eos> He swims in a pool.<eos> He doesn't like the sea.<eos> The sea...<eos> What did he say?<eos> - It's sticky.

He was discarded in a tributary over 400 miles away from anything that feeds into the dam where the first victims were found.<eos> Like dandelion seeds, casting bodies in every direction but his own.<eos> Very poetic.<eos> The buffeting in the current causes so many post-mortem injuries, it's impossible to tell them from the ones they got, uh, when they were alive.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Doctor, join me over here.<eos> There may be trace evidence - preserved in the craquelure.<eos> - What?<eos> Craquelure.<eos> It's French for the cracks that appear on an oil painting as it dries and it becomes rigid with age.
As a trophy.<eos> He must have had a friend.<eos> You're not alone, you know?<eos> In The Resurrection, Piero della Francesca placed himself in the fresco.<eos> Nothing flattering - he depicted himself as a simple guard asleep at his post.<eos> Your placement should be much more meaningful.<eos> It's not finished.<eos> I'm finishing it for you.<eos> We'll finish it together.<eos> When your great eye looked to the heavens, what did it see?
- About Will Graham?<eos> No. We could not.<eos> He practically takes selfies with his victims.<eos> The evidence we found was immediate and almost presentational.<eos> May as well have been gift-wrapped.<eos> That's what Will said about Cassie Boyle when we found her in that field.<eos> "Field kabuki."<eos> There was no evidence before Will was apprehended and there hasn't been any since.<eos> He ate a girl's ear!<eos> It was in his stomach.
Would've liked to have been wrong.<eos> Occam's broom.<eos> You intentionally ignored facts that refute your argument - hoping nobody'd notice.<eos> - You noticed. Mm-hmm.<eos> I wanted to dispel your doubts once and for all.<eos> My doubts about what?<eos> Me.<eos> I want you to believe in the best of me, just as I believe in the best of you.<eos> This crime offered us both reasonable doubt.<eos> It offered us a distraction.
Dare I say, I've never seen yours before.<eos> I'm Dr. Hannibal Lecter.<eos> I was Will Graham's psychiatrist.<eos> Well, he's not a very good advertisement for your abilities, Dr. Lecter.<eos> That remains to be seen.<eos> I bet you're a devil at the bridge table.<eos> - It's a pleasure to make your acquaintance.<eos> - The pleasure's mine.<eos> But now I know your name. Of course, I am aware of you by reputation, and I see why Chilton both reveres you and resents you.<eos> Esteem in psychiatric circles still eludes him, yet it clings to you like soap to a baby's eyes.
One navy blue sweater, one pair of men's dress pants in charcoal gray, one black and red pea coat,<eos> one black leather billfold containing $443, various credit cards, one set of car keys.<eos> I need to speak to Will Graham.<eos> I don't care what you need.<eos> One Montblanc fountain pen in silver and black.<eos> Does it have to be you?<eos> It seems like one final indignity.<eos> Not like you to hide an achievement.<eos> The achievement is not mine.<eos> Whose is it?
There's no eating here.<eos> We're gonna find everything.<eos> The viscera's exposed, the belly's laid bare, but there's no sign of rutting or gnawing, Jack.<eos> A rabid animal attacks victims at random and doesn't eat any part of them.<eos> Found the same wound patterns on a series of livestock mutilations in the area.<eos> Evisceration, dismemberment, yet everything accounted for. Livestock mutilations...<eos> That was practice? He's going to kill again.<eos> And he's gonna get better at it.<eos> And he's urbanizing his animal, moving it closer to the city...<eos> Adapting it for bigger prey.
Hello again.<eos> Come closer.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> Can you see you?<eos> Clearer and clearer.<eos> You forced me to kill you.<eos> I didn't force you to enjoy it.<eos> You made me a monument.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> The monument is not to me, it's to you.
Its braising...<eos> Notes of citrus.<eos> My palate isn't as refined as yours.<eos> Apart from humane considerations, it's more flavorful for animals to be stress-free prior to slaughter.<eos> This animal tastes frightened.<eos> What does "frightened" taste like?<eos> It's acidic.<eos> The meat is bitter about being dead.<eos> This meat is not pork.<eos> It's long pig.
A peculiar trophy.<eos> Why did he burn her?<eos> How many people has Freddie Lounds burned in her career?<eos> Whoever did this was not striking out against Miss Lounds's exploitative brand of journalism.<eos> This is something else.<eos> This is something sacred.<eos> Freddie Lounds had to burn.<eos> She was fuel.<eos> Fire destroys and it creates.<eos> It is mythical.
Hannibal's good enough for you.<eos> You should be afraid.<eos> I want you to have something.<eos> Whoever you are afraid of don't be afraid to use it.<eos> It takes 9mm rounds.<eos> Buy a box... find a range...<eos> Practice.<eos> Please.<eos> I would like to tell you about camp.<eos> It was a wonderful childhood experience that keeps coming back to me.
When men become fathers, they undergo biochemical changes that affect the way they think.<eos> You said the same thing happens when men become killers.<eos> Fathers can be killers.<eos> What sort of father would you be?<eos> I would be a good father.<eos> How quickly we form attachments something that does not yet exist.<eos> I'm not attached.<eos> I'm only... anticipating attachment.<eos> We have a deep-seated need to interact with our children.<eos> It helps us discover who we are.
Papa would take me out of school for weeks at a time while he conducted my, my... my real education in livestock, slaughterhouses.<eos> I need to share this wealth with a little Verger.<eos> - "A little Verger." - Don't you want an heir,<eos> Margot?<eos> I want a baby Verger, my own baby.<eos> I have viable sperm.<eos> I think I'd have a son. It'd be your heir too.<eos> Auntie Margot...<eos> I think a child may be what we need to bring us closer together.<eos> Maybe it is.
Why don't you wait outside while I talk to your dad?<eos> Wait with Miss Lucy.<eos> Hey, wait.<eos> It's fine.<eos> Let me get this out of your eyes. I don't know how you can see. I can't see.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Duh.<eos> Don't worry, the rolling of the eyes and the attitude doesn't last for long.<eos> Ten, fifteen years, maybe.<eos> It's just an act.
Finn!<eos> I knew you couldn't be dead.<eos> You're bleeding.<eos> I don't care.<eos> How did you get here?<eos> You know that big scrap hold, the one on K deck?<eos> You built that from scrap?<eos> I kind of rebuilt it.<eos> Please. Like that's hard.<eos> It just needed a couple parts and some love.
Looking for him why?<eos> He shot Chancellor Jaha.<eos> That's why you took the wristbands.<eos> Needed everyone to think we're dead.<eos> And all that "whatever the hell we want"?<eos> You just care about saving your own skin. Hey!<eos> Shooter!<eos> Where's my radio?<eos> - Get out of my way.<eos> - Where is it?
Two men, mid-20s, both unconscious.<eos> Hold on that one.<eos> I know him.<eos> He was our liaison.<eos> We had a problem with operation Lennox.<eos> They're dead, Francis.<eos> Who's dead? Men... women... Children... most of our guys.<eos> It just got out of hand.<eos> That massacre video you need...<eos> It's locked inside a CIA vault.
- What about you? What you got?<eos> Uh, Ella is five, and Zacky is six, and I'm married... to a guy.<eos> - His name's Len.<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> - He's great.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hey, I saw the profile on you about your interior, um, decorator...<eos> - Yeah, designer, actually. - Sorry, designer. - But that's okay.<eos> - Really, that photo - was amazing.<eos> - You know, it's good. It pays the alimony and the child support.
I'm sorry.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You're not gonna believe me, but I need you to remember what I'm saying.<eos> OK?<eos> This thing it's gonna follow you.<eos> Somebody gave it to me and I passed it to you back in the car.<eos> It could look like someone you know or it could be a stranger in a crowd.<eos> Whatever helps it get close to you.

Yes, but it does smell pleasantly like breakfast.<eos> So, the wire corrodes inside the artery every time.<eos> Perhaps it's too much current.<eos> Right, or maybe the wrong sort of wire.<eos> Maybe copper is wrong and tin is right.<eos> But how do we know?<eos> Here.<eos> It says here to "couper en dessous du ventricule. "<eos> We know that ventricule is ventricle and couper means to cut.<eos> Right, but it also means to nick, to slice, to disconnect or to break.
- Good morning, miss.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> It seems someone called the Marquesa de Salobreña is coming in for the opening of the season.<eos> "Salobreña," dear.<eos> The squiggly mark, it makes a noise.<eos> So much young European royalty in New York these days.<eos> They call our money new. But it certainly does attract a crowd.
No, you can't.<eos> A little more suction there, Bertie.<eos> Very good.<eos> Dr. Chickering will now cauterize the anterior wall.<eos> Well, it seems the old girl's not out to pasture yet.<eos> Might explode, but at least it won't electrocute you.<eos> Perhaps it's not too late for a career in the law.<eos> You've got a much better chance of survival than this fellow.<eos> I've located the aneurysm.<eos> It makes the aorta look like it has a balloon on top.
We've coordinated with NYPD and state police.<eos> All eyes are on train stations, buses, airports.<eos> There is no way she's leaving this island.<eos> We need to go back to her apartment.<eos> We made copies of everything there.<eos> But we only had time for a quick search.<eos> We looked in the bag she dropped.<eos> Nothing in it but a burner phone and some cash.<eos> - Where are we on the cab?<eos> - We got the license number, but it was already found.
Am I gonna live?<eos> _<eos> _<eos> No way.<eos> I want to feel every second of it.<eos> Never been shot before. Ugh.<eos> You've been grazed.<eos> It counts.<eos> There's a hole in my shoulder.<eos> It's an official Ryan Hardy gunshot wound.
Why didn't you tell us Joe was alive?<eos> Because I told him not to.<eos> Now I guess it's a moot point.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> ...but what we do know-- just to recap-- is that 5 cult members were killed today and a sixth was captured and taken into custody.<eos> I'd say that date with my brother just saved your life.<eos> You're gonna stage this to make it look like the Reverend killed me and then split, but nobody's gonna believe that.<eos> Oh, when they dig around, I think they'll realize that the Reverend isn't quite as godly as he appeared to be.<eos> Where's my bloody knife?<eos> Sweetie, it's right there.
You bring me so much joy.<eos> Emma.<eos> Hi.<eos> Why are you hiding back here? Come!<eos> We are so privileged to have you with us.<eos> I'm sure you're a little overwhelmed, but this is my family, and you're so welcome.<eos> You're so welcome here.<eos> You're pretty.<eos> Your house is pretty.<eos> It's so big.
Hey.<eos> Take care of this one.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here.<eos> Leave me a message, and I'll call you back.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I found the car.<eos> It's parked outside Grand Central Station.
I'm good.<eos> I'm worried, man.<eos> My last chance.<eos> Just let me help you.<eos> Have a good night, Mike.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's up?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I traced the license plate.<eos> It was stolen.
Great.<eos> Awesome that's just awesome.<eos> Now there's grease all over your face.<eos> Well, you've got all that engine stuff on you, and I clearly have to change.<eos> I saw a hotel, like, a couple streets down that way.<eos> Do you think we should get a room so that we can shower while we're waiting for the car?<eos> I should probably stay here in case they finish early, but you can go.<eos> Give them your phone number.<eos> I assume that your phone does receive incoming calls, right?<eos> Or is it from the Han Dynasty just like your car?
It's not the same virus.<eos> What is it?<eos> Dr. Creepenstein was working on the next phase of his virus.<eos> When Nadia was sick, he was experimenting on her blood... and he figured out a way to extract werewolf venom from her blood and put it into the virus. Wait.<eos> What do you mean werewolf venom?<eos> That means it's fatal.<eos> Oh, my God. Hello.<eos> You don't think I would just drop this on you without a silver lining.<eos> There's an antidote.<eos> It just requires you to come meet me.
Even if Mystic Falls is gone, we're gonna find a way to save ourselves, all right?<eos> There.<eos> Dead doppelganger.<eos> Stopped the spell.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> No, no.<eos> What the hell happened?<eos> Maria was the only one who was willing to help us who knew that spell.<eos> The great beyond happened, and it's gonna keep happening, so we need to find a way out of here and fast.
So, you read tea leaves, then?<eos> Like my grandmother taught me.<eos> And her grandmother before that.<eos> Drink up your cup.<eos> Let's see what we've got there.<eos> Well, am I going to meet a tall, dark stranger and take a trip across the sea?<eos> Could be.<eos> Or could not.<eos> Everything in it is contradictory.<eos> There's a curved leaf, which indicates a journey, but it's crossed by a broken one, which means staying put.
That's the spirit.<eos> Bertie.<eos> I'll be back to finish the chart, Nurse.<eos> Has everyone gone completely mad today?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> First I had to push my way past an angry mob to get into the building, and then I had to push my way past Edwards in the theater.<eos> Well, you weren't in yet, so Thackery needed an extra pair of hands.<eos> It's more than that. He was treating him like some old school chum.<eos> And that contraption...<eos> It's ingenious, I know.
It may seem quiet, but we have no idea how safe the streets are.<eos> Well, we can load the gurneys in the ambulance, but I ain't got the strength to pull 'em back alone.<eos> So you got to keep pushing.<eos> - I'll help you.<eos> - I'll come, too.<eos> I want to check on the condition of things.<eos> I'm sure my office is a shambles.<eos> Then I'll see Nurse Elkins gets home safely and I'll meet you there.<eos> What about my bike?<eos> Well, if it hasn't already become a victim of the riot, it certainly won't at this point.
Man, you don't do that unless you're making a point.<eos> Was she a rat?<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> Maura, what is that?<eos> Move her sleeve.<eos> Well, that's odd.<eos> It looks like a Q.R. code. - Yeah.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm trying to open it with an app.<eos> - It's a tattoo. Oh, it looks similar to a matrix bar code, which can be read by an imaging device.
Let's go back to "plan X."<eos> What we do for a living would make anybody paranoid.<eos> Natalie thought that we should have a plan just in case we needed to disappear.<eos> - Plan X.<eos> Um, could we see your tattoo?<eos> Natalie did that.<eos> She had one, too.<eos> Frankie.<eos> No, I tried.<eos> It doesn't open.
And that's when you learned she'd found the other women you'd raped.<eos> They're just as afraid as I am.<eos> But I cannot, in good conscience, go on with my life and allow him to rape another woman.<eos> You framed her and you killed her, you piece of crap.<eos> Clay, please.<eos> The fact that I had sex with Natalie does not mean that I killed her.<eos> No. No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.<eos> Please track this GPS signal.<eos> It's Christopher.
Spasibo.<eos> One last drink?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why not?<eos> Is it okay if I have a moment alone with Joe?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sure you two have a lot of catching up to do.<eos> Sweetie, you know what?<eos> I'm so happy you got rid of that ugly pink.<eos> It's lovely.
Is that bleach?<eos> I got to clean up.<eos> I'm gonna make you as comfortable as possible.<eos> When your husband gets here, he can release you.<eos> Don't lie to me.<eos> Please. This is not about you, Bella.<eos> You came into my home.<eos> You made it about me.<eos> _<eos> It is the only house.
Who are you guys?<eos> We're police.<eos> We heard you wanted to see us.<eos> Put down the shotgun.<eos> No, you guys aren't cops.<eos> We don't sleep in uniform.<eos> Put that down.<eos> - Wanna see my badge?<eos> I'll show you my badge and you put down the shotgun.<eos> It's not loaded.
...including Lora del Rio and other towns.<eos> The situation is becoming very serious.<eos> Similar incidents are taking place as they had in recent years in the Andalusian countryside.<eos> Damn!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> These are Joaquin Varela's blood test results. Quini.<eos> His blood type doesn't match the one we're looking for.<eos> I remind you this is a democracy.<eos> Next time you want to arrest someone, you ask me first.<eos> This country isn't what it was.
He knows more than what was in the well.<eos> But there's a price.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Withdraw the Civil Guard from the Point.<eos> Okay or not?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Tell them, Fermin.<eos> I saw the man who threw the bag in the well.<eos> - What did he look like?<eos> - I didn't see his face, it was too dark.
Can you come to my office for a minute?<eos> I'd like to run something by you.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> I'm really sorry I missed that last meeting when you called Lee Berman a dick.<eos> Yeah, well, uh, I'm a little embarrassed about all that now.<eos> Don't be.<eos> He was, God rest his soul.<eos> What's weird is the way you ended up taking his place on the council.<eos> Life is funny, huh?<eos> Yeah, I guess it is.
I'm Jonah Ryan.<eos> Wow. "Bitches." All right, we're gonna have dinner soon.<eos> And then I taped The Great Escape for later.<eos> - Oh. 17?<eos> - 17.<eos> So wrap it up soon.<eos> So, you're probably bumming you can't be out on that boat in Baltimore Harbor with the Veep, huh?<eos> - Honeymoon. - Yeah.<eos> Is she going to her campaign headquarters in Maryland after?<eos> Yeah, but it's not a campaign office.

- Philippe Duchamp.<eos> What was he saying about you having a cure?<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> There is no cure.<eos> Adding growth factor so the cells will build a critical mass for the genome sequencing.<eos> And we stick it in the incubator and wait.<eos> - So, do the thing I've been doing for the last hour.<eos> Is that supposed to happen?<eos> So, then you said you're growning the virus?<eos> - It wasn't supposed to grow like that.

She must feel horrible.<eos> It's like her fucking head's gonna spin around.<eos> Amy, what the fuck is happening?<eos> Is Mike on crank?<eos> That's actually the least of my worries right now.<eos> Your mom has gone quiet.<eos> I see you found it, the Room of Regret.<eos> - I'm fucked, Ben. I'm fucked.<eos> - Well, there's a remedy.<eos> It's an ancient technique that's been plied by loveable losers since way back.
Also, he speaks of you with... what is a rare degree, for him at least, of respect.<eos> You see, you challenge him to see himself and others in a new light!<eos> -(GROANS) -(GASPS)<eos> A wonderful skill that I shall be counting on very shortly.<eos> You see, Niklaus will be weak as he recovers.<eos> So watch over him and feed him if you would.<eos> But slowly, please, and from your wrist.<eos> Don't you guys have bags of blood in storage?<eos> We do, but your blood is laced with vervain.<eos> So it will burn him. He'll ingest it slower.
Gwendolyn, I just don't want you to trust him over your own feelings, okay?<eos> The Diamond, so cold...<eos> The Ruby, so bright...<eos> A lion stalks her.<eos> Deep below...<eos> The green eyes... Aunt Maddy!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The heart of the Ruby...<eos> A Lion strikes it down with his paw. – What?<eos> - It shatters...
The green eyes... Aunt Maddy!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> The heart of the Ruby...<eos> A Lion strikes it down with his paw. – What?<eos> - It shatters...<eos> Into hundreds of tiny pieces.<eos> But these are not splinters, but drops of blood.<eos> – What does it mean?<eos> - My dear child, Guard your heart.<eos> It is in danger.
I'm gonna be honest, I forgot about you.<eos> After the farm, we were always moving.<eos> But something happened.<eos> Something good.<eos> Finally.<eos> We found a prison.<eos> Daddy thinks that we can make it into a home.<eos> He says we can grow crops in the field, find pigs and chickens, stop running, stop scavenging.<eos> Lori's baby is just about due.<eos> She'll need a safe place when it comes.
How'd you find us?<eos> Where were you?<eos> How'd you--<eos> Stay here, girls.<eos> Stay on the tracks.<eos> That was my mistake.<eos> But the woods have more cover.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> There's a place up the tracks.<eos> It's safe.
Who doesn't?<eos> You... love taco.<eos> Shut up, dick.<eos> [Both panting] A lot of eye contact there on that one, buddy.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> It's okay. You were focused, and it paid off.<eos> - I was, wasn't I?<eos> - Mm-hmm. I think that my focus has improved since I got into tennis.<eos> - You're playing tennis?<eos> - Nah, just watching it. But if you don't really concentrate, it gets super boring.
Sure.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Can you get all of us...<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> One, two, three. - Yeah.<eos> Damn. Those some fast junkies.<eos> Guess you got to be more careful what you wish for,<eos> - huh, Brian? - You kidding me? I'm gonna have this memory forever.<eos> But you ain't gonna have that picture.<eos> It's all backed up right here.
Dinasour Island<eos> (Teacher) Today, we will be covering the last and most interesting class of rock.<eos> Metamorphic rock is a very special sort of rock.<eos> It's formed under the same conditions as igneous rock... but... with some very significant differences.
[Kate cries]<eos> No.<eos> Kate.<eos> I am...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Come on.<eos> I'll... I'll take you home.<eos> I'll take you back to the treehouse.<eos> What?<eos> The jar, it--it's gone.
I have to get the diary.<eos> What?<eos> I have to go back.<eos> There's no time. You'll never make it.<eos> I have to try.<eos> I can't go home without it.<eos> No one will ever believe me.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> The diary is a record of everything here.<eos> It's my only proof.
Nein, motherfucker. Nein.<eos> This job is bullshit.<eos> No. 'Tis a rewarding puzzle.<eos> Ain't no puzzle.<eos> Makes electrical look good.<eos> I can't believe I let that old bitch talk me into this.<eos> I wouldn't speak ill of Miss Parker's methods.<eos> She wouldn't tolerate such words.<eos> Hey. Now, Watson got the right... to express her discomfort for her new job.<eos> Just because cleaning quiets your discombobulation... doesn't mean it does so for everyone.
Fraud, embezzling.<eos> They filed plans for a gym that supposedly broke ground two years ago.<eos> We're talking 6,000 square feet.<eos> Hard to hide, right?<eos> But when you look on Google Earth, no new structures.<eos> - Holy shit.<eos> - Yeah, man.<eos> I just need someone in there who can help corroborate and maybe, you know, sniff around for me.<eos> Well, uh... you know, I'm, uh... I'm pretty deep into, uh... journalism with the prison story.<eos> Um, you know, and it's not just Piper.
Oh, my God!<eos> I found your fuck book?<eos> Right. So what if it is?<eos> Oh, you fuckin' junkie.<eos> - All right.<eos> - No, I get this.<eos> Better pussy than smack.<eos> Right?<eos> It's not an addiction.<eos> It's a collection, all right?
But only if I'm on my back or if I have a cold.<eos> So, just tell me to roll over, and I totally will.<eos> - Morning, Officer Bell.<eos> - O'Neill.<eos> Wow. I didn't expect the bunks to feel so dorm-y.<eos> It kind of reminds me of camp, you know?<eos> Except without the gimp bracelets and the archery and kind of sad.<eos> What a bunch of vultures.<eos> Wait, did you just steal that book?<eos> It's mine.
What are you doing in my office?<eos> You told me to find a hobby, and that's exactly what we need.<eos> Especially the old ladies.<eos> The rest of the women here have work.<eos> There's no programs for those who've been put out to pasture.<eos> What do you suggest?<eos> Aquarobics?<eos> - I hear gardening is very therapeutic.<eos> - It is.<eos> It lowers stress, helps with depression.
That old shed we use on grounds crew, it used to be a greenhouse, no?<eos> Wouldn't be so hard to clean it out, bring it to life.<eos> Let the old codgers tinker around.<eos> There's even a place to put your little plants, besides your office window.<eos> From the look of them, they're not getting the sun they need.<eos> What do you get out of it?<eos> I get to boss people around again.<eos> Even if it is a bunch of fossils.<eos> Fig would never go for a new program.<eos> It wouldn't cost much.
This is not appropriate.<eos> What is not appropriate?<eos> I am an adult who is in prison!<eos> I can handle things.<eos> You have to tell me what it is.<eos> Did Daddy lose his job?<eos> - Did your house burn down?<eos> - No.<eos> Did my house burn down?<eos> - No, darling, it isn't property.
Well, this is Jeremy.<eos> He's running for Plumber of the Prison, where we work.<eos> There's a CO trained in plumbing.<eos> His name is Kanarick.<eos> He's been here already.<eos> And?<eos> To be honest, this isn't gonna get unclogged.<eos> You're gonna have to remove the whole exit pipe.<eos> How much is that gonna cost?<eos> Okay, it's embedded in the concrete, so I gotta get a jackhammer, I gotta get my pipe fitting crews in here.
I just write numbers.<eos> She got five points.<eos> You, zilcho.<eos> All right, it's been three days.<eos> I mean, unless she's cloning herself, that seems highly unlikely.<eos> It's just a game, Nichols.<eos> Yeah, but it's not a game unless it's being played fairly.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Nichols, you got a new fragrance?<eos> Oh, yeah, it's desperation.
You should stay away from her.<eos> You think I can't handle myself?<eos> I will say this.<eos> She's got some sick, like, tattoos, like her ink.<eos> Have you seen it?<eos> That's how they get you.<eos> Being cool, doing cool things, and before you know it, you're part of their agenda.<eos> What?<eos> You know, you should read this book.<eos> It's called The End of Men.
What if we was...<eos> What if we was drownin' in the middle of the ocean, and you could only save one of us?<eos> Why can't I save both of you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Because you can't.<eos> 'Cause there's not enough room in the boat.<eos> It's, like, the world's tiniest boat or some shit?<eos> Yes, okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> It's like a little raft for kiddies and shit, all right?
You feel me?<eos> Miss Diaz, we just need verbal confirmation that Officer Mendez forced himself on you.<eos> Can you provide that?<eos> Didn't you see it?<eos> This is for our paperwork.<eos> Joe, I think Miss Diaz would be more comfortable if you weren't in the room.<eos> Look, there are laws in place which criminalize sex between prisoners and prison staff.<eos> Which means that employees who engage in sexual misconduct cannot claim consent as a defense.<eos> So, officially it's a rape, yes, and we're all gonna call it that.<eos> But I need to know, girl-to-girl... was it consensual?
It's not.<eos> It's not fine.<eos> You needed me and I wasn't there.<eos> I've been a really bad friend.<eos> Like, the worst.<eos> You don't deserve that.<eos> You don't deserve any of this.<eos> - How is mommy life?<eos> - Hard.<eos> It's so much harder than anyone tells you.
Now, it's like Serbo-Croatia up in here.<eos> You have a close relationship with Reznikov, correct?<eos> Don't call her that.<eos> Her name's Red, all right?<eos> Nicknames don't suit our official purpose.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, well, treating her like she's not a person doesn't suit me.<eos> Hey, look, just do your job and find the asshole who did it, okay?<eos> All right, you'd know this by now if you were any good at your job.<eos> It was Vee.
Like I said, SIS thinks they have their gal.<eos> You know she didn't do it.<eos> I'm trying to do the right thing here, Healy.<eos> Help me.<eos> I... I don't know anything.<eos> You'd let the crazy one take the hit for the real evil?<eos> Where's your fight, Healy?<eos> You used to care.<eos> Where was your conscience when they were in here the first time?<eos> It was buried under her mistrust for the system... but she's trying to do right.
Case is still open.<eos> Shit.<eos> You should call Cheryl.<eos> Yeah, you should call Cheryl.<eos> "Honey, I'm gonna be home late."<eos> Jesus.<eos> Come in.<eos> Welcome, John!<eos> You like my new office?<eos> Yeah, it's, uh... it's very nice.
I need you to help men retrieve a certain item.<eos> This is the item.<eos> You know it, yes?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> Do you know what you're messing with here?<eos> Won't be cheap.<eos> This is not a problem.<eos> You do know that thing could kill hundreds of people?<eos> No, Mr. Turner.<eos> It will kill thousands.
What I see is that you have tested positive for opiates.<eos> I see that you have been lying to me, and I see that you have been stealing from me!<eos> I can explain that.<eos> Every person that stands where you're standing now says the same thing.<eos> Dad...<eos> The DUI, the paranoia about Blood, you're looking like hell.<eos> You got a problem, Laurel.<eos> No.<eos> It's addiction.<eos> No! It runs in the family.
The League of Assassins is still after me, Ollie, and staying in town would put my whole family at risk.<eos> I only came because Laurel's in trouble.<eos> Well, she's still in trouble, Sara.<eos> Your entire family needs you.<eos> So do I.<eos> Do me a favor and dig up a copy of Laurel's bloodwork from the hospital, please.<eos> Sure.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> I just want to make sure of something.<eos> It's for you.
I caught a plate.<eos> The car's a rental.<eos> Address is in the Glades.<eos> Sara.<eos> Call your father.<eos> Sebastian, I am so sorry.<eos> I have a bad habit of standing you up.<eos> Look, I know you have to pull your support for my campaign.<eos> Blood is thicker than politics.<eos> And it should be.
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> You took the poison.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I can't go back.<eos> I can't take the killing anymore.<eos> It needs to end.
With invading Soviet troops in parts of the country, world indignation at the apparent Soviet takeover is coming to a head.<eos> Cold War passions were running very, very hot.<eos> And then, the United States happened to be hosting the Olympic Games at Lake Placid.<eos> They had this Cold War political flavor to it.<eos> The David versus Goliath match up featuring a US team comprised of inexperienced college players going up against a veteran Soviet team widely regarded as the best hockey team in the world.<eos> The United States had lost an exhibition game to the Soviets, 10-3, a couple weeks before the Olympics.<eos> That showed the difference in skill level between the two teams.<eos> The excitement, the tension building.<eos> The Olympic Center filling to capacity.<eos> In a political or nationalistic sense, I'm sure this game is being viewed with varying perspectives, but it is a hockey game.
If he loses that leg, I'll compensate you by shooting all three of you in the fucking face.<eos> How's his pulse?<eos> Weak, but steady.<eos> Vacuum.<eos> Christ, the bullet is lodged in the tunica.<eos> It's the only reason he hasn't already bled to death.<eos> Do you really think we'll be able to save this leg?<eos> I'm not even sure we can save the man. Tourniquet.<eos> We need to take the leg off now.<eos> It's already showing signs of necrosis.
But I'll have you know, I'm a man what makes his own fate.<eos> There's nothing stopping Tom Cleary from following the smart money, as you call it, anywhere it may lead, and that includes uptown.<eos> You, my friend, aren't following anything smart. Not until you acquire some fine manners and learn to drive a motorized car. And dress presentably.<eos> Barring all that, we're stuck with each other.<eos> - Sláinte.<eos> - Sláinte.<eos> Saddle of lamb à la Colbert.<eos> Astonishing.<eos> I had the great pleasure to sample this very dish only last week.<eos> I believe it is Charles' specialty.
I think the curators have duly learned their lessons.<eos> Why is there no cocaine?<eos> Because of the war in the Philippines.<eos> The guerillas have started attacking our cargo ships.<eos> Some have been sunk, many have been not able to pass.<eos> There are shortages of all sorts from chestnuts from Malay, teakwood from Siam,<eos> - I'm not interested in chestnuts or Siamese teakwood.<eos> We're a hospital.<eos> We need cocaine to exist.<eos> Well, then our existence is in doubt because we used the last of it yesterday.
One upright cabinet, $2.10.<eos> One long cabinet, $5.40.<eos> One medium-length cabinet, $2.20... And the list goes on and on.<eos> What about the drugs?<eos> Drugs.<eos> We're out of cocaine.<eos> We're aware, Doctor.<eos> It's a vital anesthetic. Our patients need it. Barrow?<eos> Short of launching a ship and stopping the attacks, there's little we can do.<eos> There must be some supplies of it in the city. I mean, it's your product.
Short of launching a ship and stopping the attacks, there's little we can do.<eos> There must be some supplies of it in the city. I mean, it's your product.<eos> You're only too happy to sell it to us.<eos> Now we can't even get a lick of it.<eos> There's just none to be had.<eos> Someone must have some.<eos> We supply all the hospitals, so I assure you, they're all out or critically low.<eos> We can't make the drug without the leaves, and we don't have the leaves.<eos> We haven't made or shipped a bottle in weeks.<eos> So there are no stores of it? - No supplies of any kind?
The stone we are seeking may be nowhere near our first cut.<eos> We might believe there is esophageal trouble, but until we lay the patient open and invade him, well, we have no idea if we are correct.<eos> The pain and suffering caused by our indiscriminate scalpels is great indeed.<eos> And I have endeavored to change that, with this.<eos> This is the Illuminating Intrascope.<eos> Now, you may wonder why I didn't name my invention after myself, as so many other surgeons do.<eos> But the reality is that anything named after a Zinberg will always be at the end of the book.<eos> With this device, I can make a small incision, place the Intrascope into the wound, turn on its built-in light source, and actually see inside the human body.<eos> If the patient is sufficiently relaxed with opium, the Intrascope can be placed down a patient's throat to observe the esophagus or larynx.<eos> Through an incision, it could be placed near a broken bone or in the urinary tract.
You have been steered to the right place.<eos> Thank you.<eos> As our reputation has grown, we've begun to specialize in treating cocaine madness.<eos> The withdrawal of the drug from your system will be the hardest part.<eos> Well, from the looks of you, you've done enough damage to yourself already.<eos> We here at Cromartie Hospital believe that the pain of detoxification is counterproductive to restoring your health.<eos> So we have developed a series of treatments designed to ease your suffering.<eos> Including a miraculous medication that can virtually eliminate the misery of withdrawal.<eos> And don't worry.<eos> It's from Bayer, the aspirin company.
Well, I've actually been waiting for you to call.<eos> I've been thinking about what we talked about at the valet stand, and I have some ideas.<eos> You do?<eos> Ideas... great.<eos> Um, when can we get together?<eos> Can I meet you somewhere?<eos> Well, how about you come down to my boat?<eos> Boat?<eos> Okay.<eos> It's at the Deep Cove Yacht Club.
Why?<eos> Well, there's someone that I met, and every time I'm with him, that's pretty much all I'm thinking about, so it seems in the realm of possibility that it could happen and, I mean, because of my medical situation,<eos> And I don't have a mother to ask or a close girlfriend, and I can't exactly ask my dad.<eos> I-I tried googling it, but what I read just scared me.<eos> I hope you don't mind that I asked you.<eos> I mean, you don't have to answer if you don't want to.<eos> It might be inappropriate. I don't...<eos> If you have feelings for him and he's a good person, then...<eos> The first time you have sex should be lovely.<eos> - It should?

What did you hope for, boy?<eos> You'd come here and play a man's game?<eos> I can tell you what time we'll be along the coast.<eos> I'll put the barrels over the side.<eos> We'll split it 50/50.<eos> Can't say no to that, eh, Joss?<eos> Ain't up to you, old man.<eos> Now, get out!<eos> Cakey's knocked his ale over.<eos> Needs it cleaning up.
-In bed.<eos> -Can anybody vouch for that?<eos> My wife died last year.<eos> No woman could ever replace her.<eos> So who was driving your BMW with Jaff Kitson in the passenger seat?<eos> Jaff Kitson?<eos> Your financial adviser for the last five years.<eos> -Not my car.<eos> -Really?<eos> It's got your number plate.
- Yetta.<eos> A beautiful name.<eos> Yetta, my name is Miss Robertson.<eos> I'm from the social welfare office of the hospital.<eos> I need your help right now to explain something to your mother.<eos> All right?<eos> Please tell your mother that the doctor says her disease has made her very sick.<eos> She will not get better.<eos> She will only get worse.<eos> But the hospital will do all it can to make her as comfortable as possible.
Wait for me there.<eos> You're late?<eos> Three weeks late.<eos> - Could it be Phillip's? - No.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> Algie, do you want to keep the child?<eos> Yes.<eos> Stop and think about it a little.<eos> I don't need to think about it.<eos> It's our child, Cornelia.
What can I do for you today?<eos> It's more a question of what I can do for you.<eos> I have agreed to accept your offer to endorse Thackery's Rejuvenating Liniment.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> I think you mean Peter's Rejuvenating Liniment.<eos> Perhaps you're acquainted with Dr. Peter of Cornell Medical.<eos> He's a fine doctor. Natural-born salesman, too.<eos> Can't you peddle two of them?<eos> That ship has sailed, Doc.<eos> In fact, it might be the only ship that's sailed around here lately.
I'm sorry.<eos> It was a bad idea.<eos> You should have talked to Finn.<eos> Maybe you can reconsider?<eos> Mum, we've discussed this a thousand times.<eos> But it's still too soon.<eos> For me or for you?<eos> Hannes, when your dad was in the condition you are in now, he... He still had over a year left.<eos> And how was that year?<eos> Was it worth it?

We'll call... We'll be in touch.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> That was the other doctor.<eos> He has an appointment for you tomorrow.<eos> Kiki, when we were all sitting together earlier on, it was all fine all of a sudden.<eos> For the first time.<eos> My life...<eos> My life wasn't too long perhaps.<eos> But it was pretty good.
You know, you've read crime novels.<eos> Y-you want to communicate with someone but not be seen with them, then you put a message in a newspaper, and you leave it in a public place.<eos> You think Whitaker was a spy.<eos> No. I think he found a spy.<eos> He saw someone leave this paper, and he intercepted the drop.<eos> We need to find out when and where he found this newspaper.<eos> Espionage is a big leap from doodles in some old newspaper.<eos> Remember -- it's still perfectly possible that Whitaker killed himself.<eos> The company Whitaker worked for did some top-secret stuff.<eos> His apartment looked like it was decorated by an 8-year-old.
Tassled loafers? Oh, wait.<eos> Hold on. Back up.<eos> You said you already solved the case.<eos> Are you gonna tell us how?<eos> Oh, ask him, and he won't tell you.<eos> Pretend you're not interested, and he might.<eos> I'm not even gonna try.<eos> Uh, I-I'm sorry.<eos> Y-you said, uh, "date," and then the subject changed.<eos> Yeah, okay. It's not exactly a date date.
Uh, I-I'm sorry.<eos> Y-you said, uh, "date," and then the subject changed.<eos> Yeah, okay. It's not exactly a date date.<eos> It's a business thing.<eos> He is flying in on a private jet from Chicago.<eos> Wow, that's very impressive.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm gonna find out tonight.<eos> So, how's life in San Francisco?<eos> Oh, it's good.
Hello?<eos> ! Is anybody out here?<eos> ! Anybody out here?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you have a phone?<eos> I just -- Well, look, were you in an accident?<eos> I-I just need a phone.<eos> Please, do you have a phone?<eos> Okay, okay, okay.<eos> Okay, here. Here it is.
We're gonna need some art for the gaff, and then a good false blow-off.<eos> I don't know what any of that means.<eos> You'll get used to it.<eos> But if you want art, I got art.<eos> Good.<eos> I always feel a little bit like Aladdin right here.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now we're having fun.<eos> Where does all this stuff come from?<eos> It's stolen.
Really?<eos> Yeah, try a little less Joan Crawford and a little more Barbara Stanwyck.<eos> I don't even know what that means.<eos> Look, I can't walk, and you're giving me acting tips?<eos> Just stay upright.<eos> Keep smiling.<eos> I can't breathe in this dress.<eos> Can you pass the rice, please?<eos> Where did the house come from?<eos> Mm, it's a drug forfeiture, on loan from the D.E.A.
All right, fellas, what's the situation?<eos> Well, Pulaski left a sliding door open before he left, and this guy came through it.<eos> We got a name?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Oh, I keep finding strangers in my bedroom.<eos> Guess it was a good party.<eos> You all right, Teresa?<eos> I am now that you're here.<eos> He wants to know about the painting.<eos> It's a fake.

I promise.<eos> Good.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> I brought you this.<eos> Is this from the FBI handbook?<eos> Some good cop/bad cop thing?<eos> No, it's just a pillow and a blanket.<eos> Do you have any idea what you're doing to my husband?<eos> You're asking him to relive a very painful chapter in his life.<eos> I think it was more painful for Sarah.
Officer Green! Forestry Service!<eos> Thank you so much for coming!<eos> This way!<eos> Two hikers found her around 9:00 this morning.<eos> Any identification?<eos> Nah.<eos> She's a Jane Doe.<eos> But we did find this cellphone about 10 feet from her body.<eos> Must have fallen out of her pocket.<eos> It's pretty beat-up.
We had a problem.<eos> In years past, people would go to a house about 20 miles away from the camp when they...wanted that kind of thing.<eos> But there was drunkenness, accidents, arrests.<eos> Not a healthy situation in the age of the camera phone.<eos> So Kilgallen came up with the idea of moving the enterprise onto our grounds as a way of avoiding the difficulties.<eos> And it worked.<eos> We've had no problems since then.<eos> Except a murder.<eos> Yes. Obviously.<eos> So, it was Kilgallen's operation? Yeah.
It's too damaged.<eos> They can repair it, but it'll take weeks.<eos> No need.<eos> We can identify the killer today. How?<eos> I'm gonna do a routine onstage with four objects that I will say I got from the club's lost and found.<eos> One of those will be this phone.<eos> When the killer sees it, he will identify it as Madison's.<eos> And think that there's evidence on it.<eos> Well, he doesn't know that the FBI has it.<eos> He's gonna think it's in the lost and found.
Terrific.<eos> Beautiful.<eos> I know you can hear me... And see me...<eos> 'Cause you've got a camera in here.<eos> You did it so you can blackmail one of Madison's clients.<eos> It's how you also knew that you needed to clean that golf cart before the tech got here.<eos> We only talked about it in this room, so we know you heard.<eos> It's how you also knew not to take the phone.<eos> But I still got it.<eos> And it still has evidence that will implicate you.
I can strip and reassemble this weapon - in well under two minutes.<eos> - Mr. Reddington, please.<eos> Once I have it reassembled, I'm gonna reload the mag, and if at that time, your task remains incomplete, I'm gonna empty that mag into your head.<eos> That's really messed up.<eos> Don't look so stricken.<eos> The first shot will kill you.<eos> Wait. Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!<eos> I did it.<eos> It's done. Look.<eos> It's untraceable, like you asked.
It's from Mr. Reddington.<eos> It's evidence.<eos> Reddington reached out to you?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Uh, we had a chat -- at gunpoint, actually.<eos> Long story long, he identified the leak.<eos> Who the hell is Newton Phillips?<eos> Newton.<eos> So... it's finished?
Anyway, I've also included a couple of my favorite Richard Pryor records.<eos> I want to try and inject a little levity into the proceedings.<eos> I mean, Julian looks so crabby all the time.<eos> House arrest can be grueling.<eos> Didn't you spend, like, four months - in Phonthong?<eos> - Seven.<eos> How did you survive?<eos> Naps. Occasional calisthenics.<eos> So, the defense fund-- where do we stand?<eos> Well, we've put together an amazing team, - but it's expensive.
- Yes, I-I do.<eos> I do. She's my sister.<eos> She has-- she hasn't been well.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I want you two to stay right there.<eos> Officer?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm in love with his little nose.<eos> Yeah, that's a cute one.<eos> Oh, it's his face, and I'm in love with him.
There's nothing more profound and of lasting consequence than the decision to have a child.<eos> The exploitation and perversion of that decision is the stock and trade of a truly evil organization-- the Cyprus Adoption Agency.<eos> Adoption?<eos> You want me to believe this is a coincidence?<eos> Tom and I are adopting a baby, and you serve up an adoption agency?<eos> Life is full of lovely little ironies.<eos> The Cyprus Agency offers a promise of something very special-- perfection.<eos> Their clients are ordering from an unlimited genetic menu, the characteristics of the child they want to bring home.<eos> But the evil is not in what the agency offers.<eos> It's in how they get it done.
You talk too much.<eos> I didn't know anything about the safe deposit box until I saw the will.<eos> I've had all the necessary paperwork certified-- the trust and... the death certificate.<eos> The paperwork is in order.<eos> But to access your husband's box, you will need the key.<eos> Is there anything else?<eos> No. Thank you.<eos> I'm terribly sorry for your loss, Mrs. Reddington.<eos> The box in Istanbul.<eos> - Hmm? - It's been cleared out.
We wouldn't even be here if it weren't for that troublemaker.<eos> Always an agenda with him.<eos> Cultural attaché.<eos> Culture my ass.<eos> The things I do for this one.<eos> Gallivanting around the globe for your little assignations with you-know-hmm-hmm, carrying her furs and bikinis as if I wouldn't rather be back in Dutchess County with my shelties.<eos> Hey, don't take anything for granted!<eos> Everything you have was bought and paid for by your boyfriend!<eos> Do you have any idea whose horn this tramp is blowing?<eos> Let's just say it starts with Bashar and ends with Assad, gassing you faster than a sunni.
I want you to tell me where she's been.<eos> Cities, safe houses, aliases.<eos> She's already faked her death to elude me. Now she's back.<eos> I want you to tell me everything you can about where she's been, what she's been up to.<eos> I mean, I thought this was a teacher conference, not a book burning.<eos> There's nothing wrong with a little editing.<eos> They're children.<eos> Kids shouldn't be reading "Lolita."<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, th-the heart goes where it wants to go.
Reunion with some old friends.<eos> Welcome to the United States, Mr. Itami.<eos> Hello, Agent Maguire.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> You will.<eos> Mako Tanida, former clan boss of the Azuma-Dojin, based out of osaka.<eos> By the time our task force caught up, he controlled a large part of the heroin trade traveling along the silk road.<eos> After Tanida's arrest, we thought his empire would collapse.<eos> It didn't.

Pleased to meet you.<eos> The Skeleton Key is the culmination of five years of RD into state-of-the-art cyber warfare.<eos> It's designed to deliver a knockout blow to enemy infrastructure in wartime.<eos> No cruise missiles or boots on the ground.<eos> Defense grids, weapons systems, and communications-- the Skeleton Key can cut through the world's most secure networks with the push of a button.<eos> So, you're saying our suspect is now in possession of this device?<eos> A prototype for the control module.<eos> We just finished it last week.<eos> In fact, our whole operation was about to be relocated to a cybercom ops center in Colorado for field testing.<eos> Before it went missing.
The information alone would be worth millions.<eos> May also be how he learned about the Skeleton Key in the first place.<eos> As if that is not enough, he's also hacked himself access to pay-porn sites and a pile of "Mythcrash" gift cards, which is harder than it sounds.<eos> He even breached the Social Security Administration to raise benefit payments for someone.<eos> Who?<eos> As you can see, Ms. Lee, your payments went up by $1,200 in September.<eos> Says who?<eos> Social Security Administration.<eos> You're saying you didn't notice the extra money?<eos> It's direct-deposited into my account.
And Dee Torres, she had late-stage cervical cancer, less than a month to live.<eos> The Undertaker recruits the terminally ill as assassins?<eos> Yes. And both killers had additional problems.<eos> Dementia, mental instability.<eos> Conditions that made it possible to explain away the events.<eos> They also had motives.<eos> Their families are now suddenly free from financial hardship.<eos> The cabbie received an inheritance, and Dee Torres, her brother is now getting around-the-clock care, thanks to payments from an anonymous foundation in Oregon.<eos> I don't give a damn where the money's going.<eos> I wanna know where it's coming from.
Vlad, it was a mistake.<eos> I can easily blame it on the hashish and the grappa, but the truth is...<eos> May I speak freely?<eos> You're better off without her.<eos> She's fickle.<eos> I'm sorry, but this business with the fingerprint, it's important.<eos> Do you still have that little villa in Dubrovnik?<eos> I do.<eos> A weekend there with Fadila.<eos> She would love it.
Federal agent.<eos> Please call our 24-hour hotline at 212...<eos> That's far enough.<eos> Take a seat just there.<eos> We must be quite careful now.<eos> My wife...<eos> Yes.<eos> You did your very best to try and save her.<eos> It was heroic, in fact.<eos> This business of mine... it's an art, not a science.
The risk is too great.<eos> The influenza pandemic in 1918 killed 50 million people.<eos> If this strain went airborne, it would wipe out that number in the first month.<eos> If it went airborne.<eos> So you're saying you think it didn't?<eos> Correct.<eos> We've checked everyone in the bank.<eos> Incredibly, nobody else is infected.<eos> It looks like this virus was intentionally mutated to contain itself in the original host.<eos> It doesn't spread.
Anyone working with Cullen is doing so in isolation, illegally, and for no good purpose.<eos> You realize if you leave, the task force ends.<eos> Everyone's lives go back to normal, except yours.<eos> This doctor friend of yours-- tell me about him.<eos> He was the lead research scientist on infectious diseases at USAMRIID and the foremost expert on the Cullen virus.<eos> "Was." Now he's a criminal.<eos> No, the work he's done has been criminalized, which is why he left USAMRIID.<eos> But if anybody knows anything about black-market viruses, it's Dr. Bruce Sanders.<eos> This is a copy of Tom's code book.<eos> It was used to pass information between Tom and his superiors.

To kill Reddington?<eos> It still seems like a bit of a reach.<eos> Reddington was right about one thing.<eos> Whatever this organization, Berlin, is planning,<eos> Blankenship was vital to it.<eos> And with him gone, Berlin's gonna need a replacement.<eos> _<eos> Mr. Klein, you are dying.<eos> I have infected you with the Cullen virus.<eos> It is the single deadliest pathogen in existence.
Oops!<eos> But I'm-- no, I'm- - I'm-- I'm fine, really.<eos> Full recovery.<eos> Doctor, we've come to you on pressing business.<eos> What can you tell us about the Cullen virus?<eos> Oh, spooky.<eos> Spooky stuff.<eos> Bad news.<eos> You've researched it?<eos> Well, it was recently used as a weapon to target a man named Paul Blankenship.
How are you gonna help them?<eos> I'm the only one that has what they want what they need.<eos> Hey, kids.<eos> So, they're gonna carry out my instructions or die trying, no matter what you do.<eos> That's how blackmail works, sweetheart.<eos> I've got to hand it to you.<eos> It's a pretty sharp play.<eos> Infecting people with a fatal virus that only you have the antidote for and then telling them they can't have that antidote unless they do exactly as you ask.<eos> Such a smart plan... that I borrowed it.<eos> Now, I'm no doctor, so I don't know how fast this virus of yours takes to set in, but I know it will kill you, soon.
I have no allegiance to Reddington.<eos> He killed my father.<eos> But this man we're hunting-- Berlin-- he's somehow in the center of all this, and my only objective is finding him.<eos> Reddington can help us.<eos> You have a visitor.<eos> Hello, Ray.<eos> I got to tell you, Ray, this concerns me.<eos> I'm in the intelligence business.<eos> That means knowing things.<eos> We tried to trace where that plane originated, where it was headed-- hell, even who it belongs to.
A culo you could eat the real scarpino.<eos> - Look, I'm sorry, but my answer is no.<eos> Okay.<eos> You should know though, that if I hadn't taken about 20 of your goiter analgesics, drank a half a bottle of cough syrup, and popped about 15 of those sugar cubes, I would be utterly heartbroken right now.<eos> Good day, sir.<eos> "Even though he was gone,<eos> "I could feel him around me, inside me.<eos> A gentle breeze wafted through the bedroom and caressed my creamy white immaculate thighs.<eos> I thought about closing the window, but when I looked over,<eos> I saw that it was already closed."
Sorry about our butts touching.<eos> Okay, we'll go into the vents.<eos> - They'll never find us there.<eos> - I say we take a stand here.<eos> I mean, someone's got to win sometime.<eos> Not if we never kill each other.<eos> Then we can play forever.<eos> Right.<eos> Wait. Abed, the floor can't be lava forever. The game's got to end.<eos> It's not a game for me, Troy.
Yeah. I do know Shirley.<eos> Oh!<eos> We should be having brownies.<eos> I'm going to help Shirley.<eos> Not a bad idea for you, Britta. She could make you a Two again.<eos> Screw your Twos, and screw MeowMeowBeenz.<eos> I know that's your One talking.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Registering for MeowMeowBeenz.<eos> I'm gonna become a Five and expose this thing for the sham it is.
You're one of the angriest, most vindictive...<eos> You're the angry one, because the rules got changed on you, Winger.<eos> You can't just be cool and be in charge now.<eos> No, you have to gossip and give out food<eos> - and make people feel guilty.<eos> - Okay, yeah.<eos> I bust my ass making a world full of selfish idiots - remember my name!<eos> - Fine.<eos> Call it hard work, but don't tell me the system measures who's nice.<eos> Actually, it kind of does.
I mean, it just feels like forever since we talked.<eos> Your idea, what'd you call it?<eos> - Phone truce. - Phone truce.<eos> Right.<eos> Are you really okay?<eos> 'Cause I've been wondering how you've been handling the whole...<eos> Wow, you smell incredibly sexy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - A new perfume? - Uh-huh.<eos> It's nice.
But Ron was under your command.<eos> He was transferred before I could do anything except file a restricted complaint. Went nowhere.<eos> What was the name of the specialist?<eos> - Frankie Gonzales.<eos> - Do you know where she is?<eos> As far as I know, she's in South Carolina.<eos> Do you remember the date this attack on Gonzales happened?<eos> Never forget it.<eos> November 11, 2010.<eos> It's a date.
Why is she pregnant and I'm the one who's sick?<eos> We have much to celebrate. And know that you and your friends are welcome in our kingdom.<eos> If you need anything, we're at your service.<eos> Thank you, but all we need is horses.<eos> We have our own kingdom, our own castle.<eos> Our castle was destroyed in the curse.<eos> Well-played, Your Majesty. You laid waste to everything.<eos> Not everything.<eos> Her castle still stands.<eos> Of course it does.
If... if what you're saying is true I'd have to give up my life here.<eos> It's all based on lies.<eos> It's real... and it's pretty good.<eos> I have Henry, a job, a guy I love.<eos> Perhaps there's a man that you love in the life that you've lost.<eos> Regardless, if you want to find the truth, drink up.<eos> Do you really want to live a life of lies?<eos> You know this isn't right.<eos> Trust your gut, Swan.<eos> - It will tell you what to do.
What changed overnight?<eos> Someone from my past showed up.<eos> Henry's father?<eos> Another ex?<eos> It's nothing like that.<eos> H... he's more like a ghost.<eos> Okay, so that's how I'm supposed to sleep at night?<eos> You're trading me in for a ghost?<eos> It kills me to have to make this choice at all, to leave us behind... my whole life.<eos> Emma, if you love this life, then keep it.
Yes, that's exactly what it is.<eos> Okay. You're acting like that's normal.<eos> Actually, it is.<eos> But not here.<eos> There's only one land that has creatures like that.<eos> I've read about it.<eos> Oz.<eos> Oz?<eos> That's a real place? The Bookworm's right.<eos> It's quite real.
No, what I mean is, how did you know to come back?<eos> I gave you and Henry a new life, new memories.<eos> Hook found me, gave me a potion that made me remember.<eos> There wasn't enough for Henry. Oh.<eos> Well, how convenient.<eos> Look, I didn't cast this curse, if that's what you're thinking.<eos> The thought did cross my mind.<eos> Why would I do this?<eos> Why would I erase an entire year of my life?<eos> Maybe it was a bad year for you.
A hero would come back.<eos> He would say that.<eos> Are you sure you don't want to meet him?<eos> We can just tell him you're an old friend, like Mary Margaret and David.<eos> It would be too hard.<eos> I can't imagi...<eos> We got 'em.<eos> You sure whoever's in there can't escape?<eos> I sealed the room with a blood lock.<eos> It can keep you out or it can keep you in.
She's real, too?<eos> Says the daughter of Snow White and Prince Charming.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> It's not like we're in Kansas.<eos> Why would the Wicked Witch of the West want to come to Storybrooke?<eos> Hungry?<eos> You never should have brought me back.<eos> Eat up.<eos> We've got work to do.<eos> ♪ You feed the madness, and it feeds on you ♪

You sound just like my kid.<eos> He's always having a go at me to dress up better.<eos> You know, if I feel comfortable in the way I dress... then I am much happier, and I have a better time.<eos> How old is Michael these days?<eos> He's about to turn 34.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> Oh, I'm just about ready here.<eos> Just gotta come down there and finish my beer.<eos> I noticed you bought beer.<eos> Yeah, I went to the supermarket, tried to save a couple nickels... but hell, it's almost as expensive in the supermarket... as it is downstairs in the bar.
- You want me to tell the whole thing?<eos> - Yeah, go for it.<eos> The story's about these two travelers.<eos> And they're out on a moor and they're starting to get lost.<eos> They don't know which way the village is.<eos> They keep going over hill after hill.<eos> Keep thinking it'll be, you know, after the next one, but it isn't.<eos> So just as they're getting worried they might have to sleep out on the moor... they come to this beautiful old house.<eos> Creepy old house?<eos> Yeah, yeah, it was pretty creepy.
- Can't really see how deep it is...<eos> - ...out there in the middle.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You think this thing will make it through that deep water or not?<eos> Well, it's built for it, man.<eos> - I think.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> How about if we wade out in the middle and see how deep it is?
- I got you.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> That was perfect.<eos> - All right, you like that, huh?<eos> - You're not getting it.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Hey, you think this picture's gonna...<eos> When we go to Paris, this picture's gonna be in a prominent place in the Louvre?<eos> Okay?<eos> Or you think it's gonna be in a fold-out on Playgirl magazine, baby?
Omar. _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Rahim ruined my life by putting that video online.<eos> Your life's not ruined.<eos> Yeah, it is.
I got a little hot.<eos> Yes.<eos> You did.<eos> Come to think of it, it is getting a little warm in here.<eos> Mr. Gillis.<eos> Mike Ross.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> You should know I'm only doing this as a courtesy to Jonathan Sidwell, but I'll tell you right now, the answer is no.<eos> Good. Why good?<eos> Because a yes is always so much better when it starts as a no.
I'd expect nothing less.<eos> Oh, uh, just one more thing.<eos> I haven't been formally given this assignment yet, so I have no conflict.<eos> But in one more week, I will, which means this offer will be gone.<eos> Is that a threat? I would never threaten someone that I want to be in business with, Jessica.<eos> It's just the truth.<eos> I like him.<eos> How did it go with Harvey?<eos> It didn't.<eos> What do you mean "it didn't"?
It comes from here.<eos> It's that damn food.<eos> Software I discovered that you could make music at school.<eos> Nerds as I got together and made a demo.<eos> A programmer made super advanced stuff on the screen. So he left a square rotating.<eos> Then there was anyone in music.<eos> Then you had a demo.<eos> Computer Whiz music, demo music, which is the amateur version of techno and trance.<eos> The better I became, and the computers were, however how it began to sound.<eos> You can look it up. It is very fast and quite amateurish.
Ax and I talk with Steve if we have time for.<eos> If he does not understand, then we have a big problem.<eos> There is the prodigal son.<eos> - I did not think it would take so long.<eos> That was a bad idea.<eos> - The tattoo?<eos> You knew that three months ago, al- We are here to work.<eos> Yeah, but still.<eos> - It's worthless.<eos> It was not a great idea.
Maybe not all of it.<eos> THE CHAMBERMAID LYNN<eos> Hi mum!<eos> Hello, Lynn!<eos> Nice to hear from you!<eos> Thanks for cleaning.<eos> I wanted to call earlier.<eos> I had to turn in my mobile.<eos> But you have it back?<eos> Yes, but it's always turned off.
With windmills on it, I crocheted it myself.<eos> Nice.<eos> How's your heart?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> The doc said I don't need the bypass right now.<eos> Did you know that bypass is spelled with a Y?<eos> I always thought it was German, you know with 'Bei'.<eos> But it's a Y, it's English.<eos> Mama? You know what the best part about cleaning is?<eos> That it always gets dirty again.
There's a lot of expenses, taking care of whores. Yeah? Who told you that?<eos> The fella you bought from?<eos> What's his name? Beard?<eos> Bird? - Boyd. - Boyd.<eos> Boyd Crowder.<eos> - How much you pay him?<eos> $250,000. $250,000?<eos> God damn, Dewey!<eos> You got ripped off!<eos> Look, right here in the classifieds, there's a fully equipped and liquor-licensed restaurant in Corbin going for a buck 25, and it has kerb appeal!
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You look miles away.<eos> Seven thousand.<eos> You wanna know about my job?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well...<eos> Yesterday, I was flying over a house in South Waziristan.<eos> It was night when I started watching but they couldn't see me even if it was day.<eos> It was the house of a Taliban commander.
[reporter 1] ...a longstanding source... [reporter 2] Underwood will speak before the committee today regarding the allegations... [reporter 3] While little is being released to the public, the vice president's statement...<eos> The vice president just entered the Department of Justice.<eos> We're here with Ayla Sayyad, whose Wall Street Telegraph article catalyzed the investigation.<eos> Ayla.<eos> The issue at stake is whether the White House was in any way involved.<eos> Was foreign money traded for political favors?<eos> Did it influence diplomatic relations?

I recognized it from the quote on the back.<eos> - Was there a message?<eos> - No, just the watch.<eos> - Let's find Doug.<eos> - Right away, sir.<eos> Forgive the plastic.<eos> Luc Tuymans.<eos> He's the real thing.<eos> Well, I'll take your word.<eos> It's not mine.
You're okay.<eos> What happened?<eos> There were a bunch of walkers out here and he got his hands around Judith's neck.<eos> No, he's dead.<eos> I...<eos> I had to.<eos> So I did.<eos> I could.<eos> I don't know if the fire is still burning.<eos> It is.
(Voice on radio.) You should be able to see my location.<eos> (Electronic chirping.) Coming through.<eos> (Electronic chirping.) Analyzing.<eos> (Electronic chirping.) Joining.<eos> but it's not all there.<eos> Your vitals... (Voice on radio.) They were never that good...<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What's broken ?<eos> (Voice on radio.) - My leg.<eos> - How bad is it ?
If we reduce the consumption of meat, dairy and eggs. we can allow mono-crop fields with genetically modified corn and soybeans to reverse back to forest and back to the habitat of animals.<eos> When someone says "we can't grow food for humans on land on which we cultivate feed for animals,"<eos> this is someone [..] the number one crop out of California.<eos> The truth is that if we can grow corn to feed an animal, we can grow corn to feed a human.<eos> Best Selling Food Author "In Defense of Food"<eos> You encourage people to eat less meat, for less resources and the toll on the environment.<eos> - And on the animals.<eos> - And on the animals.<eos> And the workers in the system.<eos> It's a brutal system at every level.
Of course.<eos> Shut the door behind you, please.<eos> How are you?<eos> Sanne, Tristan admitted that Sofus is dead.<eos> It's not him.<eos> Tristan said you held the dead baby for hours and said: "What have I done?"<eos> What did you do, Sanne?<eos> How did Sofus die?<eos> - How, Sanne?<eos> - It's not him.
Yes, true, but if some stranger in a bar challenged you to a showdown, even if you knew that you were gonna get your ass kicked...<eos> I'd fight him anyway. Okay, fine.<eos> Then that's-that's what I have to do.<eos> Look, Joel, have you ever even thrown a punch?<eos> No.<eos> But you're gonna teach me how.<eos> How do you...?<eos> Crickett? Have I told you how beautiful that color is on you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Do you know what it reminds me of?
Yeah, all right, thank you, thank you.<eos> Oh, there he is!<eos> Ha. The man that brought me back to life.<eos> Wow, you, uh, you really...<eos> You really went all out here. Yeah. Um...<eos> But we should talk, because, um, see, Zoe's mom...<eos> Well, it's the least I could do.<eos> I mean, truth is, this is exactly the kick in the pants I needed.<eos> You know, I mean, this time yesterday, my house felt like a tomb, but today, look around.<eos> It is filled with joy, Joel.
Of course.<eos> That means so much to me.<eos> That's so special, thank you.<eos> I love a good wedding.<eos> To the bride and groom.<eos> - Come on, you guys.<eos> - You'll get your turn.<eos> I want him to show us how he does it.<eos> Just wait till the song's over.<eos> It's over.
And as you know, reality can often be not very pretty.<eos> And I assure you, whatever magic we do in the show did not kill those women.<eos> We're gonna need a list of all your employees.<eos> Of course, yes, yes.<eos> My records are in my trailer.<eos> Would you like to follow me?<eos> Max, did...<eos> - How long you been doing this?<eos> - Ever since I was a kid.<eos> I ran away from home when I was 13, even though it wasn't much of a home to run away from.
I have a message for you.<eos> The Clairvoyant told me to say, "Hello."<eos> - Ian Quinn.<eos> - You found him?<eos> No.<eos> But we think we know how we can.<eos> Skye tracked down an invoice from one of his shell companies.<eos> He made a big purchase recently.<eos> $10 million big.<eos> - Any idea what it is?

We've been made!<eos> Oh, bloody hell!<eos> Jemma!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> She's okay.<eos> Okay, hold her up.<eos> There we go.<eos> I think this is some form of dendrotoxin.<eos> The same stuff that's in the Night-Night gun?<eos> Yeah, but it's clearly evolved.
