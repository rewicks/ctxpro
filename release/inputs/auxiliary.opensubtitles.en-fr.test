You're late!<eos> Just in time, boss.<eos> They bust in here, step on our throats, and take the one device that can cause a global power shift.<eos> So, how do we get it back?<eos> These assholes just took out the best of the best like it was Sunday brunch.<eos> We need someone who can move like them, fight like them.<eos> We need someone who can walk into a tornado, and come out the other side like it was a damn gentle breeze.<eos> You know someone like that?<eos> No.<eos> But Gibbons did.
All right. So what?<eos> So maybe they chopped the money then and there, and then went their separate ways.<eos> Or maybe they left two trails to confuse us.<eos> I don't even see how it matters.<eos> Well, you'll see that it matters when we find my brother Andy's dead body, you stupid assholes. Oh!<eos> Your partner's being real pig-headed about this.<eos> My partner?<eos> My partner's the smartest guy in the room, and if you don't see that, you two are dumber than you look.<eos> His partner's not even in the room.<eos> I don't even.
I love the sky on mornings like this.<eos> Greasy forehead, window, off.<eos> I'm gonna try not to be depressed because I'm single on Cupid Day.<eos> That's Valentine's Day to you!<eos> Do you have insomnia or something, Linds?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> It's just cute that you get up before us and get breakfast. Ooh.<eos> Did she just call me cute, Kingston?<eos> I believe she did, Edgecomb. Mmm-mmm.<eos> Al, Linds doesn't do "cute." No.
Of course I think you're a good person.<eos> But it doesn't really matter what I think.<eos> I mean, what's important is what you think.<eos> No, I'm serious.<eos> I want to know...<eos> Why do you think that I'm a good person?<eos> Do you remember when you were a little girl?<eos> You used to take turns riding all of the horses in the stable so that none of them would feel left out?<eos> Do you remember that?<eos> I do. Mmm-hmm.
I mean, you said you wanted to...<eos> It's Rob Cokran.<eos> He doesn't deserve me.<eos> Nonetheless, very shocking.<eos> Sociopath, 12 o'clock.<eos> Does it smell like pee in here?<eos> Stop.<eos> Norma Bates!<eos> What?<eos> Just don't.
I'll be finishing up a project in the workshop, if you wanna stop by.<eos> Okay.<eos> You remember that smell?<eos> Ma griffe.<eos> Your mother's perfume.<eos> She loves you more than you can possibly know.<eos> Am I dead?<eos> Do you feel dead?<eos> You knew I would come, didn't you?<eos> Course I did.
- Molly?<eos> - Yeah. Why? What?<eos> Dogs can't smell molly.<eos> What did you do?<eos> What do you mean, what did I do?<eos> I didn't know they can't smell molly.<eos> Campbell, you have to train a dog to smell specific drugs, okay?<eos> How do you think this thing works?<eos> I don't know how it works. I thought you guys knew how it worked.<eos> We do.
- What will you do outside... when you know nothing?<eos> Devji!<eos> - Revoke his parole! - Please don't send me to jail again!<eos> Or, I'll be a bachelor all my life!<eos> Sir, at least let me get married.<eos> - Do you want to complete the rituals?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> In that case, find out where Raees hides his stuff.<eos> - Do you agree?<eos> - I do.
- Revoke his parole! - Please don't send me to jail again!<eos> Or, I'll be a bachelor all my life!<eos> Sir, at least let me get married.<eos> - Do you want to complete the rituals?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> In that case, find out where Raees hides his stuff.<eos> - Do you agree?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Agree?<eos> - I do, sir.
The laborers toiled for you for years.<eos> - what is rightfully theirs.<eos> - If you want rights, go to court.<eos> Why have you come here?<eos> Get Deepak.<eos> Debt-ridden workers are killing themselves.<eos> How will they pay for court cases?<eos> Did I tell them to die?<eos> Think it over.<eos> Done.
Look, no, we had a break-in, some little bastard smashed it to bits.<eos> We found the remains out there in the porch.<eos> - The porch where we came in? - How anybody could hate her so much they'd go to the trouble of smashing her likeness...<eos> I'm no expert, but, uh, possibly her face.<eos> Why didn't he smash all the others?<eos> Perfect opportunity, and look at that one - she's smiling.<eos> Oh, Inspector, this is clearly a waste of time.<eos> - And if there's nothing...<eos> - I know what happened to your son.<eos> You do?
Why would he want to kill me?<eos> - He said you betrayed him.<eos> - Oh, no, no, that's insane.<eos> Well, it's what he believes.<eos> I suppose I was always afraid this might happen.<eos> That something in my past would come back to haunt me one day.<eos> Yes, well, he's a very tangible ghost.<eos> God, I just wanted a bit of peace, and I really thought I had it.<eos> No, Mary...<eos> You do.
- Ssh, ssh, ssh.<eos> - Promise me.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - No...<eos> - Yes, I promise.<eos> - Promise me!<eos> - I promise, I promise. Ssh, ssh.<eos> Yes. I... so like you.<eos> Did I ever say?<eos> Yes, yes, you did.
Visualize jumping across! - And then do it!<eos> - Come on, you got this! Okay!<eos> Billy, you got this! Whoa!<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> - Are you okay?<eos> - I got it.<eos> - Come on, climb up. Climb up.<eos> - I did it.<eos> - Billy, you got it.<eos> - I did it!
And you must never reveal your identity.<eos> Ever. To assume your ranger identities, you need to morph.<eos> Have any of you morphed before?<eos> Yes. But only in the shower.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Let's step into the footprints, please.<eos> Let's try this.<eos> Standing in this circle as a team, you can easily connect to the morphing grid.<eos> - Do you feel it?<eos> - Yeah, they do.
Zack, do not touch it.<eos> Whoa! Where'd it go?<eos> Bring it back.<eos> Bring it back, dude.<eos> Get out.<eos> Training is over for today.<eos> Go home. I'm sorry, he just morphed.<eos> He did it.<eos> You saw it, right?<eos> Do it again.
Welcome to Iceland.<eos> Thirty minutes, we'll be reaching...<eos> You know that you used all your savings for this trip?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really wanna help out so...<eos> Just...<eos> Yeah, I just thought...<eos> -Nope, nope, no!<eos> -Yeah!<eos> -Oh, you didn't.
- What do you mean?<eos> - Go home and talk to your mother.<eos> I'll call you later.<eos> Mom.<eos> Mom.<eos> Hey.<eos> What are you doing in here?<eos> What do you want in life?<eos> To be happy.<eos> You do?
Tell me about your morning.<eos> Start from the beginning.<eos> I woke up.<eos> How did you sleep?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I don't.
A bloody game.<eos> Please, please, please, no violence.<eos> Thank you, Dr Watson.<eos> I don't think he's a danger any more.<eos> Leave him be.<eos> No. It's okay.<eos> Let him do what he wants.<eos> He's entitled.<eos> I killed his wife.<eos> Yes, you did.
The posh boy loves the dominatrix!<eos> He's never knowingly under-cliched, is he?<eos> I'm gonna make a deduction.<eos> - Okay, that's good.<eos> - And if my deduction is right, you're gonna be honest and tell me, okay? Okay.<eos> Though I should mention that it is possible for any given text alert<eos> - to become randomly attached to... - Happy birthday.<eos> Thank you, John, that's very kind of you.<eos> Never knew when your birthday was.<eos> Well, now you do.
For the ultimate honor.<eos> Upper management.<eos> This, Templeton, is where all the action is.<eos> Nap time in Sector G.<eos> So this whole place is run by babies?<eos> Yep. My Dad says, "Those who can, do."<eos> "And those who can't, supervise."<eos> Your father is a hippy.<eos> What happens when you grow up?<eos> We don't.
Besides, you boys are in great hands.<eos> That's right!<eos> Eugenia is practically perfect in every way.<eos> Please don't go with him.<eos> Francis Francis is trying to...<eos> Believe me... Eugenia won't take her eyes off your children.<eos> Not for one second.<eos> That's very reassuring.<eos> Now you see them.<eos> And now, you don't.
We could go and find him.<eos> We do not have to tell him who I am.<eos> I could just see him.<eos> Maybe I can ask for the time.<eos> No one has to know.<eos> - Do you know where he lives?<eos> - No.<eos> His name?<eos> Gardner, I promise, I don't know anything about him.<eos> Nobody does.
I'm so sorry we hurt you.<eos> It wasn't our intention, okay?<eos> - This way!<eos> - Guys, be careful!<eos> Where are you?<eos> There! Right there!<eos> Back door! Go to the back door!<eos> Back door! Back door!<eos> Stop!<eos> Mija! Don't!
Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> Got a light?<eos> You live in... town, don't you?<eos> Yes.<eos> You live by the school?<eos> How did you know that?<eos> I just do.
- To say nothing about him.<eos> - Wingardium Leviosa!<eos> And these guys.<eos> Exterminate!<eos> I'm starting to get an idea, monkey face.<eos> Bruce, over here! Okay, shutterbugs. Look alive, here we go.<eos> I'm gonna give you three poses.<eos> You ready? Kissy face.<eos> Oops, I did it again.<eos> And the Bad Boys. What you gonna do?
Well... apologies are what got you into this disaster, so, yeah, officially, it's a statement.<eos> It's the first step of CIR's plan to save the company's image.<eos> But... but what about the plant?<eos> What about it?<eos> It might be making people sick.<eos> Danny, we don't know what's causing it.<eos> The EPA cleared us.<eos> Fifteen cases of cancer can't be a coincidence.<eos> Do you think that I don't care about those people?<eos> I do.
- You talk a lot.<eos> I'm sorry, sir.<eos> No, everything is not okay.<eos> How could they lose the company?<eos> Well, it was the board.<eos> Voted them all out.<eos> - Joy, Danny...<eos> - Danny?<eos> Do you know where Ward is?<eos> No, sir, I don't.
I'm certain we speak the same language.<eos> Perhaps you're simply too frightened.<eos> Oh, I see you use swords, too.<eos> I guess that means you know we reside in the nape.<eos> Ah, well, I'll just take it back with me.<eos> Only when a person stops fighting do they lose.<eos> As long as we continue to fight we are not beaten!<eos> You can move now.<eos> No! Stop!<eos> Don't!
- I've just, uh...<eos> - Will you take something?<eos> I'm... but thanks.<eos> Did he give you coffee?<eos> Glad to see you've cheered up.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Yesterday.<eos> You seemed all down in the dumps.<eos> I'm amazed you noticed.<eos> We all did.
- You cool?<eos> It's working, it's working.<eos> All right, that's it.<eos> Back off, slow.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, look here, man, look here.<eos> You don't wanna be here, all right, and you didn't do nothing wrong, you just got unlucky.<eos> You just help me out here, man, you get your shit straight, maybe we can get your ass out of here.<eos> Maybe we both could.<eos> Yeah, you hear me, don't you?<eos> Mm-hm, you do.
Can I wash this off?<eos> Don't stray from the lines.<eos> Okay.<eos> Are these burns?<eos> Who did this to you?<eos> Go on, it's over.<eos> I know how difficult it is for you to open up to me and tell me these things.<eos> But it means the world to me.<eos> It means you love me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Tell me what you have that I don't.<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.
Nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> He'll get tired of me.<eos> Master sleeps in your bed.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I saw you.<eos> I watched you.<eos> I know you love him.<eos> I do, too.<eos> We all do.
Please don't say anything.<eos> You--You're a Dustie?<eos> Really?<eos> I mean, yeah, of course, I am.<eos> But I've never seen you--<eos> I mean, of course I haven't, obviously, because I live here.<eos> I've never been over there, where you live.<eos> Are you new here?<eos> -How did you know?<eos> -I don't.
Pass those around, guys.<eos> Okay? I wanna see your work.<eos> Turn around, face the desk.<eos> Think about how you get to the answer.<eos> It's not just about, you know, guessing.<eos> Don't be messy.<eos> Done.<eos> Let's see.<eos> Okay. I thought you might finish quickly, so a little something extra.<eos> Done.
No, it had to be him.<eos> - It can not be them!<eos> - Diana, people... I...<eos> She was right.<eos> My mother was right.<eos> She said the world of men do not deserve you.<eos> They don't deserve our help, Steve.<eos> - It's not about deserve!<eos> - They do not deserve our help.<eos> Maybe, Maybe we don't!
They are ugly... filled with hatred... weak... Just like your captain Trevor.<eos> Gone and left you nothing.<eos> And for what?<eos> Pathetic!<eos> They deserved to burn!<eos> Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.<eos> She is the perfect example of these humans... and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.<eos> Destroy her, Diana.<eos> You know that she deserves.<eos> That they all do.
There are no free rides here.<eos> Everyone puts in work, whether cliqued up or not.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm not talking about helping us with our computer skills.<eos> You'll get your fucking hands dirty like the rest of us.<eos> Or you can go back to seeing how that lone bullshit works out for you, money man.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Joshua made you a letter... and he's very excited for you to read it.<eos> He did it all by himself, and...
It doesn't matter what I do!<eos> Your job is to take care of yourself and your mom.<eos> Look, I get why you pushed us away.<eos> It was to protect us.<eos> But, Dad, you've done your time now.<eos> It's over.<eos> Let us help you get back on your feet.<eos> Please.<eos> You wanna help me?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're as bad as your da.<eos> My father cast my mother into madness, then jumped in straight after.<eos> He's scarcely a man to follow.<eos> He was a good man.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, a good man who killed his wife for convenience.<eos> You know nothing.<eos> Always cow-eyed about your sainted mother.<eos> Or maybe it's about time you know about your mother.<eos> I do.
I have a use for you.<eos> For the safe.<eos> Go.<eos> Murderer!<eos> Murderer!<eos> Do you know who blew up your ship?<eos> I've been thinking a lot about what happened, and... and I think we were right.<eos> There wasn't the time for such...<eos> And we have plenty of time.<eos> No, we don't.
In the later days she did things... no-one understood.<eos> In the later days, when she wasn't allowed to walk the streets, nor show her face in public, nor speak in English, nor her savage tongue because she was a mad woman.<eos> - James.<eos> - No.<eos> Explain this.<eos> I have the very same mark on me... from when I was taken prisoner in Africa.<eos> What is it?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You don't speak but you do have answers.<eos> You do.
I'll pay you a pound every month.<eos> How did you know about me?<eos> Because I have eyes and ears everywhere throughout the city in many places, much like the Company itself.<eos> I honestly mean you no harm, Godders.<eos> - If I were caught...<eos> - What?<eos> If I were caught passing company secrets to a Delaney...<eos> You're not going to get caught because I will protect you.<eos> You know, at the seminary, I was in love with you.<eos> Of course you do.
No, that was all him.<eos> He found Mary and convinced her it was what Charlotte would have wanted and it probably was.<eos> She loved him.<eos> Before she came back to Rosewood, the four of us<eos> Charlotte and Archer, Wren and me we did everything together.<eos> But Charlotte missed the game.<eos> Why are you giving them so much power over you?<eos> I am the power.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> No. I don't.
Wait.<eos> So I'm still alive because I'm your sister but what's gonna happen to Ezra?<eos> Well, he's not family, so...<eos> Enjoy his company while you can.<eos> I think that you and I are gonna be the closest of all.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know me, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course, you do.
It's a very delicate thing, and nobody wants its smooth running to be muddied by a big new American offensive.<eos> No, I told you no more troops, Glen.<eos> Now we're gonna have to rethink the game plan.<eos> Well, Dick, with all due respect, you told me you didn't care if I got more troops or I didn't, so I'm trying to work out how to get the job done.<eos> No, I did not say I didn't care.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - I did not say that.<eos> - I believe you did.<eos> - No. No, I didn't. I...<eos> - You did, Dick.
Do you understand the precedent that you'd be setting?<eos> Don't yell at me.<eos> You know what? I'm a lady and I've never said this to anybody, ever, in my entire life, but I'm gonna say it to you.<eos> You can go fuck yourself on the head.<eos> Right on the head?<eos> I'm sorry, but he's trying to shut down "Avenue Q." He says it's too controversial.<eos> Well, what's he want to replace it with?<eos> Don't tell me "Cats."<eos> You remember your first day of school?<eos> I do, actually.
Great stones, they lay upon his chest until he pled aye or nay.<eos> They say he give them but two words.<eos> "More weight," he says and died.<eos> "More weight."<eos> Ah, crap.<eos> I forget the rest.<eos> Okay. That's a wrap, boys.<eos> I'm meeting with Bellingham tomorrow to get him to sign off on Portland.<eos> I thought you already had approval.<eos> I do.
I'm trying to make a living now that my sister has stolen the family business out from under me.<eos> Well, you'll be glad to hear someone's trying to steal it from under me.<eos> [Chuckles] Wow, that didn't take long.<eos> Who is it?<eos> I was hoping you could tell me.<eos> Does it look like I am masterminding the takedown of the Kensington Firm?<eos> Or perhaps if someone would stop standing there like a bloody waxwork.<eos> He really is magnificent, isn't he?<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> No, I do.
1-3-6, over.<eos> Roger, we heard there was a downed aircraft.<eos> Can we confirm that?<eos> Is anybody looking to our North route?<eos> I'd linked up with the Commander, Lieutenant Colonel Brian Menace. And we were moving to clear a compound so he'd have a secure location because they needed to control 15 aircraft that were racked and stacked in the sky.<eos> This had now become a combat search-and-rescue mission in addition to the ongoing offensive operation.<eos> Spread out.<eos> - I need to get by you.<eos> Do you speak English?<eos> Hey, he does.
Good job.<eos> You stayin' out here, bro?<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> - That's gotta be them.<eos> - What?<eos> That's gotta be them right there.<eos> What is that, some kind of special FBI app?<eos> It's "Find My iPhone." I have Clay's password.<eos> You don't have my password, do you?<eos> Yeah, I do. "The Baker, 1980."
But right now, all I can think about is everything I've missed.<eos> I've been trying to find the single moment that set my life on its path.<eos> Maybe there's a version of my life where I'm sick.<eos> A version where I die in Hawaii.<eos> Another where my father and brother are still alive and my mother's not broken.<eos> There's even a version of my life without Olly in it.<eos> Do you ever wonder what your life would be like if you could just change one thing?<eos> What if changing one thing made things worse?<eos> What if we hadn't met?<eos> But we did.
Did you escape, or did they, they let you out?<eos> Audrey.<eos> Well, not the reunion you were hoping for.<eos> Well, she looks pretty.<eos> They did a hell of a job reconstructing her face and neck.<eos> I think that and the coffin just killed your savings.<eos> All so you could have that nice open casket, get one last look at her pretty face.<eos> I'm sorry about Robbie, okay?<eos> He was a really good friend, and I know he loved you like crazy.<eos> So did Laura.
And why would they?<eos> Well, yeah, you could... you could call this Easter.<eos> Or we could call it what it really is: A pagan ritual, the celebration of the beginning of spring dating back about 12,000 years.<eos> So, when you see children dipping eggs in vinegar the colors of their favorite toys, or when you see the nation's youth fleeing south for copulation, or when they spread their seed over that sinking mass that is the great state of Florida, they all... without realizing it do it in her name.<eos> Ostara.<eos> It is a treasure and a treat to welcome you all to my home and on my day, my favorite day of the year.<eos> When all is lavender and dew, reborn and restored. When we celebrate the earth...<eos> Hello, Shadow.<eos> Do I know you?<eos> Yes, you do.
First wire ever sent by Samuel F.B. Morse himself in 1844,<eos> "What hath God wrought?"<eos> Goddamn information age is what.<eos> Best thing about these states we're headed towards-<eos> Minnesota, Wisconsin- is that they have the kind of women that I loved when I was younger.<eos> Pale-skinned, blue-eyed.<eos> Hair so fair it's almost white.<eos> Wine-colored lips, full round breasts with veins running through them like a good cheese.<eos> Only when you were younger?<eos> You did alright last night.
And if we tear this room apart...<eos> I don't want to tear this room apart, and I'm not sure I want to fight.<eos> We have to.<eos> For Hannah.<eos> What about for us?<eos> Honey, our daughter is gone.<eos> Christ, Andy, I know that!<eos> I have to know why.<eos> I need to know why.<eos> And if you don't, I...
I didn't lie to that woman.<eos> I'm still a mother.<eos> And to not be the mother of a dead girl for a few minutes!<eos> Should we move?<eos> What?<eos> Should we move?<eos> Should we go somewhere and start new?<eos> And... give up the store?<eos> I'll give up the store, give up the house, everything... if I have you.<eos> But you do.
So I am.<eos> I mean, you... you came after all.<eos> I was feeling rebellious.<eos> So you finished your homework.<eos> That would sort of be antithetical to the whole...<eos> Right, right. Yeah.<eos> Uh, do you... Do you want a drink?<eos> I believe you promised me a drink, in fact.<eos> And a ride on your bike.<eos> I did, didn't I?
Yeah, I think I'm gonna come with you if it's cool.<eos> Cool.<eos> I was so nervous that night, but you made it seem so...<eos> Easy?<eos> Is she kidding me?<eos> I was shitting myself.<eos> But she's not telling the truth about the way things happened.<eos> She's telling her truth.<eos> Why do you always act like you know?<eos> Because I do.
Did Justin finger you?<eos> I bet you went down on him.<eos> - And they all became you.<eos> - Sometimes it's better to wait.<eos> Thought you were easy.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry.<eos> No, just stop, okay?<eos> Did I hurt you?<eos> No, just don't.
I don't want you here.<eos> Get out.<eos> - Hannah...<eos> - Get the fuck out!<eos> Okay. I'll go.<eos> But tell me what's going on, okay?<eos> Tell me what's wrong.<eos> You don't want to be with me.<eos> But I do.<eos> - I really do.
Spencer, Olivia.<eos> Eugene was taken. They took Daryl. He escaped.<eos> Every second he's out here, he's a target.<eos> You gonna say you were right?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just real sorry they're gone.<eos> Negan murdered Glenn and Abraham, beat them to death.<eos> Terrorized the Hilltop, set loose walkers just to make a point.<eos> I used to think the deal was something we could live with.<eos> A lot of us did.
I always found it hard getting close to anyone... neighbors, friends... boyfriends.<eos> You should try it sometime.<eos> Even if it doesn't last.<eos> I'm gonna talk to our blacksmith about making more spears. Maybe we can trade with the Kingdom for some body armor.<eos> Thing is, what we really need is riot gear.<eos> I was... looking for something to read the other day.<eos> You can have the bullets.<eos> I didn't know you had a gun.<eos> I didn't.<eos> I do now.
So... my brother pissed someone off, get himself killed?<eos> Something like that.<eos> Very, very ugly stuff.<eos> My condolences.<eos> But it's time.<eos> All of my charts are in order.<eos> You need to make arrangements for some kind of medical care here, especially for my ongoing patients.<eos> I will.<eos> - I need to pack.<eos> - You don't.
Don't.<eos> "Don't" what?<eos> Don't go.<eos> Welcome to the first day of the rest of your life, Sasha.<eos> You are gonna help make sure things get back on track today.<eos> You are smart, hot as hell, dignified as shit, and you don't suffer one goddamn fool.<eos> No one's gonna wanna watch you die.<eos> I don't wanna see that.<eos> So you don't have to.<eos> But someone does.
Rick wants us to stay here in case things go wrong so there's another card to play, another safe place the Saviors think they control.<eos> But he doesn't know that Gregory's gone... that maybe he's telling them things that'll make them think something else.<eos> And it's all about to happen.<eos> You're thinking of leading the Hilltop over there to fight.<eos> I am.<eos> If Negan finds out they're planning something, they're gonna need help, even with those Scavengers on their side.<eos> Well, you'd have to decide right now, and it's a very tough decision.<eos> Why are you smiling?<eos> 'Cause I'm glad you're the one making it for us.<eos> How do I?
where they -- where they -- they created a new sauce for the McNuggets called Szechuan sauce, and it's delicious!<eos> And then they got rid of it, and now it's gone.<eos> This is the only place we're gonna be able to try it, is in my memory.<eos> Rick, you're doing this bit while your brain is melting.<eos> Okay. All right, all right.<eos> Is that...<eos> Me.<eos> I used to wear blue pants.<eos> When'd you make the leap to interdimensional travel?<eos> I didn't.
I'm more of a, "This is so good, let's keep doing this," person.<eos> Right, but at some point if we keep doing this, it takes us into the future.<eos> Do you even see me in that future?<eos> I don't not... see...<eos> - Not...<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> No, it's not you, Barry.<eos> I don't see myself with more family in the future.<eos> I thought you knew this.<eos> I do now.
Sy.<eos> Law enforcement's here.<eos> That's, uh...<eos> Nobody asked for that.<eos> Sir, I'm Officer Lopez, Saint Cloud Metro.<eos> Is there a place we could talk in private?<eos> That's... I didn't call the police.<eos> No, sir. It's...<eos> I'm investigating an automotive flapper in the driver of a Humvee registered to this Stussy Lots.<eos> Did vehicular damage to... Fine.
I called him on his cell.<eos> - When?<eos> - Yesterday.<eos> Right. Well, there'll be a record of that.<eos> Did you speak for long?<eos> Just a few minutes.<eos> Well, it's just a quick call, just to catch up, innit?<eos> Be vague.<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> No one ever does.
Uh, sir?<eos> - You're not supposed to be in here.<eos> Uh, you can't be in here, sir.<eos> Library is closed.<eos> You're here.<eos> Well, sir, I work here, so that's...<eos> I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.<eos> Sir?<eos> You're gonna have to leave.<eos> I just did.
A way to send the protomolecule. To our solar system?<eos> It begs the question, sent by whom?<eos> And why?<eos> Did he just say what I think he said?<eos> He said, "extra-solar object".<eos> First proof of extraterrestrial life.<eos> And it's just more death.<eos> You still got a beat on that signal. That you guys intercepted leaving eros?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course we do.
Sir, if we de-escalate, I am convinced that they'll respond in kind.<eos> And erode our position. If mars decides not to give peace a chance?<eos> Sir, we're the most powerful nation in the system.<eos> We need to act like that.<eos> Pride isn't power.<eos> And what vast font of battlefield wisdom. Are you drawing from, admiral?<eos> I advise that we deploy our fleet to secure any base. That might become a martian foothold.<eos> Madam.<eos> Do you concur?<eos> I do.
So did amos.<eos> Antenna's busted.<eos> Amos is different.<eos> Okay, very different.<eos> But he's not crazy and he's not evil.<eos> He's just always needed someone. To help him out with the world.<eos> And he picked you.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Do you know that old story, pinocchio?<eos> No, I don't.
What did he say?<eos> He said he'd be okay. Throwing me into space without my helmet, But that you wouldn't like it.<eos> Sounds like amos, 16-millimeter.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> He's like a brother.<eos> We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship. Without my helmet, right?<eos> I did.
Look, if you want to believe the kid's a saint, go ahead.<eos> You go anywhere near Saad Mahsud,<eos> I will have you arrested.<eos> It was nice talking to you.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Yep.<eos> National security right down the line.<eos> The informant is off-limits.<eos> So how do we talk to him?<eos> We don't.
- Of course I do.<eos> I was thinking the same thing.<eos> Mm-hmm. In fact, I went to see her today, see Carrie.<eos> - And?<eos> - Asked her point blank,<eos> "Are you advising the president-elect?"<eos> - She said no.<eos> - And you believe her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Nothing.<eos> Now you have.<eos> I didn't say I wanted to hear from you.<eos> I said I expected it.<eos> -Is this about the bomb?<eos> -No.<eos> Tovah Rivlin, Mossad agent.<eos> I need what you have on her... Movements and contacts for the past two weeks.<eos> So, even if we had such information...<eos> You do.
Almost none.<eos> I did find one thing.<eos> The lease on that Jeep he's driving in the photos.<eos> Did you get a name?<eos> What I got was a wall of shell companies that dead-ends at some corporation off the Dulles Toll Road.<eos> Okay. I'll go down there and check it out.<eos> If that guy...<eos> If he's involved in the bombing, like those photos suggest, but he wasn't working with Sekou,<eos> I don't even know what we're saying here.<eos> I don't, either.
I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> I know.<eos> It's, uh...<eos> It's urgent.<eos> Carrie?<eos> Madame President-elect.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Children's Services has put Franny into foster care.<eos> I don't...
Well, her father had red hair, and-- and she has red hair, so at first, whenever I looked, what I'd see...<eos> What I'd see was that he wasn't there.<eos> She reminded you of his absence.<eos> Not just that.<eos> Of my role in his not being there.<eos> I knew where everything was heading. I-<eos> - I knew.<eos> And I pushed him toward that.<eos> I-I really-- I really don't like this.<eos> No one does.
You'll want to hear this.<eos> That was Brett O'Keefe on the phone.<eos> He says he made the video.<eos> He admits it now when we already know?<eos> He says he's responding to your call to come out of hiding.<eos> He wants to discuss it with you on his show this afternoon.<eos> No debate, no prep, just two people talking.<eos> His words.<eos> Which, obviously, you don't want to do.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
I took the bullets out of her gun, and she couldn't defend herself when he came.<eos> I killed her.<eos> No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but... at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.
No, you did not.<eos> You did not.<eos> That guy did.<eos> Listen, okay?<eos> When Pallis gets here, you need to tell him what you just told me.<eos> I-I know...<eos> I know it won't be easy, but... at least I understand, now, what happened here.<eos> You don't.<eos> - Quinn...<eos> - You don't.
- Yeah.<eos> A priest.<eos> I mean, I can't go through this again.<eos> There's gonna be somebody I can talk to to...<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll find someone.<eos> She didn't deserve this, okay?<eos> - Any of it.<eos> She's...<eos> - No. No. No one does.
You have arrived.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Good night. - Yeah.<eos> Hey, beautiful.<eos> Congratulations, by the way.<eos> "The fault, Dear Brutus, is not in our stars,"<eos> "but in ourselves."<eos> Think Joel used to say that before he, uh, went into surgery.<eos> Joel loved him some Shakespeare.<eos> Yes, he did.
They spoke of Uhtred... how he broke a shield wall.<eos> You should pay a skald to write a song.<eos> Hm! I did that in Mercia.<eos> I was drunk and the song was tuneless.<eos> I am indebted.<eos> My words have no tune, but they're sincere.<eos> You have brought me back to life.<eos> - Then you owe me.<eos> - I do.<eos> I do.
Prepare!<eos> Your king!<eos> He will be here soon.<eos> Be sure to greet him.<eos> Make him feel welcome.<eos> The abbot... where is the abbot?<eos> Brother Trew.<eos> - Lady Gisela.<eos> - You appear to have news.<eos> Lady, I do.
No, I came down here to be with you.<eos> Yeah, but if he's close by...<eos> Honey, I don't know where he is.<eos> And if he wanted me to know, he would've fucking told me.<eos> Gotcha.<eos> You brought your book.<eos> It's not my book. It's Matt's.<eos> But it's about you.<eos> Are you finally gonna read it?<eos> - I already did.
It was after he died.<eos> Yeah, what?<eos> About three years back, he went rock climbing with a mate just outside Perth.<eos> He fell 100 meters.<eos> Broke his neck.<eos> His mate dragged his body into the cave so the dingoes wouldn't eat the corpse, made his way back to civilization.<eos> Burton was sitting at the front of the cave, not a scratch on him.<eos> Said he felt absolutely fine and that he was God.<eos> People don't actually believe this guy's God?<eos> Some do, sure.
Yeah, it sounds crazy, but... these are crazy times?<eos> So, when Kevin comes back, you're not gonna jam us up?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not gonna jam you up.<eos> You don't think he's coming back.<eos> Well, it's a lot to... to put on someone, asking for all that help.<eos> I mean, if it were me, I would just keep riding.<eos> Get as far from this as possible.<eos> But Kevin, he'll come back.<eos> He always does.
Over here, we lost some of them.<eos> But over there, they lost all of us.<eos> So, I went and did what I came there to do.<eos> I went to find my kids.<eos> Planes don't really fly over there.<eos> They have enough resources, just not enough pilots.<eos> So, I found a boat that would take me.<eos> No boats go directly from Australia to New York, so it took me a long time to get there.<eos> A long time.<eos> But I finally did.
Ben told me to come alone.<eos> He spots anyone he even thinks might be with the government, he will bolt.<eos> I'll make sure the tac team stays hidden.<eos> You're not hearing me.<eos> Ben is counter-surveillance trained, okay?<eos> He's also very paranoid.<eos> Carter, Grimes has already gotten away from you once.<eos> We can't let that happen again.<eos> Eric, you and I were operating alone because we didn't know who we could trust.<eos> Now we do.
Hmm? Thank you so much, both of you.<eos> Okay, so tell me, what the hell is going on?<eos> John... this is the last thing I want to be telling you.<eos> The last thing you need to hear.<eos> Someone used my proprietary code to get into the CTU system.<eos> They accessed the file identifying the Rangers who took out Bin-Khalid.<eos> And now most of them are dead.<eos> We ran a trace.<eos> The file was accessed from Nilaa's computer.<eos> I don't...
Right?<eos> Royo tried to play me.<eos> And he got help from Aisha and Jerome.<eos> More of y'all got to be involved.<eos> Here's how we gonna do this.<eos> Bring Kevin in.<eos> Jerome tried to sell me out.<eos> And you're his little brother.<eos> So don't tell me you know nothing 'bout it.<eos> - I-I don't.
I told you, give John some time.<eos> He'll come around.<eos> They took him, Luis.<eos> They have John.<eos> What?<eos> The terrorists, the people you did business with.<eos> They've kidnapped my son.<eos> CTU agents are on their way here now.<eos> They're gonna need your contacts, electronic files, anything you have that can help them find John.<eos> Henry, I did...
And send out an interagency alert, code one.<eos> What's happened?<eos> I just spoke with Henry Donovan.<eos> Luis Diaz is gone.<eos> He assaulted Henry and fled the premises.<eos> Y-You need to send an ambulance out to the estate.<eos> Right away.<eos> I need to take this.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> How we doing?
We're done working up your credentials.<eos> Well, mostly.<eos> Andy, what the hell does that mean?<eos> Mariana's on it.<eos> She's been looped in.<eos> Uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah, we based your credentials around an agent who's on leave, but we haven't had time to backstop everything.<eos> Will it get me through security or not?<eos> We think so, but I'd feel better if we had a little more time.<eos> Well, we don't, okay?
You hit the governor when he was at his weakest. And at what result?<eos> Eleanor is dead, Anne is nearly dead, and the governor is sitting in Nassau in my fucking chair victorious!<eos> You cannot fight civilization from the outside in.<eos> And your plan now is to follow that man into more of the same? !<eos> "What result?" That result was because of your goddamn betrayal!<eos> Just now, that man and several others wondered aloud whether the smartest thing to do wouldn't be killing you and throwing you in the sea rather than giving you another opportunity to fuck us!<eos> For reasons I can't begin to fathom, I argued against it.<eos> Bark at me again about braver, stronger, and smarter men, and I might decide to revisit the issue!<eos> If killing me seems like the smartest thing to do, then it is obvious to me none of you have any idea how to defeat Woodes Rogers.<eos> - And you do? !
And still, you will not say yes.<eos> So I come to you one last time, to ensure you cannot say no.<eos> - Accept the treaty...<eos> - I will consider no treaty of yours.<eos> And John Silver lives.<eos> Refuse... and he dies... along with the rest of the men who followed him here.<eos> And from what I understand, he is the one who matters most to you.<eos> The one with whom you might lead a life if you can set aside your pride in this moment.<eos> Do not make the same mistake I did.<eos> Do the deal.
This is, um, gonna sound really weird and really awkward and totally inappropriate and I apologize in advance but...<eos> You've seen my daughter.<eos> You're not the first.<eos> Please come in.<eos> My husband Jerry, he hated the visitors.<eos> The first was a young boy.<eos> Will was his name.<eos> His father was the detective assigned to my daughter's case.<eos> No one believed me.<eos> Not even my dad, but... she did.
Did you see it? Listen, I gotta call you back.<eos> Did you watch it?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I watched it.<eos> - It has almost two million hits!<eos> Oh, can you believe it?<eos> - It is incredible.<eos> - Lito, this is a bit awkward.<eos> I thought your lawyer was gonna talk to you.<eos> I know. He said that I needed to talk to you.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
Guess again.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Welcome to the womb of the house.<eos> You're just in time to help with the delivery.<eos> Oh, Karen! Oh, my god! Oh, Karen!<eos> They are all serving a purpose, Jennifer.<eos> Sebastian titan set the ball in motion when he conjured me to seduce young, lovely Maggie black.<eos> Oh, she tried to trap me.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> Yes, you did!
Um, I have a UTI.<eos> I get them all the time, so I need, like, Cipro, Pyridium, codeine if you're feeling, you know, fun and fancy.<eos> Yes, your urine tested positive for infection.<eos> In the future, I'd come see us a few days earlier when the symptoms start.<eos> Yeah, it's just sometimes hard to tell if it's, like, just the baseline level of weirdness of my urethra or an actual issue, so it's like what's being alive and what's an infection?<eos> These are my questions.<eos> I'm not sure if you... if you pee after intercourse, but that can also help in preventing them.<eos> And, plus, you're pregnant.<eos> Do you know that?<eos> I do now.
Have you ever thought you might like boys?<eos> I don't know. Even just a bit?<eos> That you're bisexual?<eos> What's this about?<eos> Some very cool people are bisexual, like Lady Gaga or Angelina Jolie.<eos> What are you trying to say?<eos> There are people who think that what we did on my birthday...<eos> I don't know.<eos> You should know.<eos> And I do.
Take him down, now.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> Back off! Back off.<eos> Back off or he dies.<eos> I'm already dead.<eos> Take him down.<eos> They can't.<eos> Can you?<eos> I'm no use to them dead.<eos> - Do it now!
Very lightweight and extremely common.<eos> Also, um, I've got a requisition form here for you.<eos> Oh.<eos> For what?<eos> Oh, you know, nothing much.<eos> Ballistic gelatin, forensic-grade resin bones, a dozen or so aluminum alloy canes.<eos> Also chinos, reading glasses, and a cardigan.<eos> I don't want to know what you're building, do I?<eos> No.<eos> No, you do not.
Finding and serving God.<eos> That's good, man.<eos> The world needs it, Linc.<eos> I mean we're, uh, we're small here but we do what we can to help the peace efforts in the Middle East.<eos> Working on anti-radicalization campaigns here at home.<eos> Like I said, the struggle.<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> If I needed to get to Yemen, that something you could help me with?<eos> I thought he was dead.<eos> So did everyone.
I guess there's lot of red tape when you're trying to un-marry a dead identity thief.<eos> Okay, officially, he's still alive.<eos> Well, did she officially change her last name yet?<eos> She should.<eos> Alison Rollins sounds like a mouthful of muffin.<eos> Ezra's still in New York, right?<eos> I-I'm not babysitting this pillow by myself.<eos> Okay, well, our place is loud enough already, Caleb snores.<eos> - No, he doesn't.<eos> - Yes, he does.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - It's not your fault.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> You weren't drinking at that bar to celebrate.<eos> I'm gonna go get some rest.<eos> Wait, Spencer.<eos> Hanna and I aren't gonna let you down this time.<eos> I promise.<eos> I hope that that still means something.<eos> It does.
Listen, Holly, if you let me go, I won't tell anyone.<eos> Okay, we could just forget it ever happened. It's not too late.<eos> It was too late the moment I met him.<eos> He had my heart, and I had his.<eos> Then ask him... if that's what love is.<eos> It's not manipulation.<eos> Even if it means you have to let him go.<eos> You need to let him go.<eos> I don't need to ask him who he loves, Ali, because I know he loves me.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You really should tan and dye.<eos> We're trying to keep a secret here.<eos> _<eos> Super Max-powered zombies armed to the gills, ready to do battle once they're discovered?<eos> And I'm not supposed to say anything?<eos> Aren't we the "No Secrets" club?<eos> We're the "No Secrets Between Us" club.<eos> I think what they're doing here is smart.<eos> I mean, do we really believe there's going to be a "let's talk things out with the zombies" phase once the human population learns we exist?<eos> - I do.
"One cannot be free if one's oppressors continue to live."<eos> And what I've learned is, The best way to end your fear is to face it yourself.<eos> So, for you, a gift, the sword that you gave me, now laced with my venom.<eos> One slice will draw Klaus' blood and deliver the slow, agonizing death that he deserves.<eos> It would be... my highest honor.<eos> Took a long time, but we finally caught you.<eos> Or maybe I just stopped running.<eos> Do you suffer, Niklaus, as my wife suffered?<eos> As my child suffered?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Come on, Clarke.<eos> The nuclear power plants that were destroyed by the bombs have begun to melt down.<eos> The Earth's surface will be uninhabitable, so, you see, the City of Light is the only thing that can save you.<eos> Would you really condemn the human race to die in 6 months?<eos> I'll figure something out.<eos> We always do.<eos> John?<eos> Hey, hey, it's ok.<eos> Clarke, you're not acting like someone who just saved the world.<eos> Because we didn't.
I know you destroyed it.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> Look around you.<eos> Skaikru did this to us.<eos> Because of them, Ontari, your rightful commander, is dead.<eos> This imposter stole her Flame. No.<eos> Wanheda saved us, all of us...<eos> Grounder and Skaikru.<eos> There would have been nothing to save us from if not for you. Azgeda has no authority here.<eos> We do now.
Yeah, they spray.<eos> And when the people come, everybody be closing their nose up saying how it stink.<eos> They can want a cookout on Sunday, he'll spray.<eos> Do you think he does it on purpose? I think so.<eos> 'Cause he just sprays Sunday.<eos> He always sprays Sunday.<eos> And in most of these area, hog houses and turkey house, it's in a black area or the Hispanic area.<eos> It's either or.<eos> Do you think it's also a civil rights issue?<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
Better than the last man in that shackle.<eos> What a nightmare.<eos> Dykstra.<eos> Poor sod, he shit himself to death.<eos> I'm Bajie.<eos> Don't ask me what it means or what my mum was drinking.<eos> May the gods protect her poor drunk soul.<eos> Wait, hey.<eos> You want a little drop?<eos> Yeah, you do.
As you wish, master.<eos> Are you ready?<eos> For what?<eos> The hard part.<eos> Very important.<eos> How about you?<eos> What?<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Your baron said we were free to go.<eos> What you and your men did to those dolls.
Call me when you want to talk.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did Frank confess?<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who told you?<eos> Nate.<eos> He just wants to know if Frank knew I was pregnant.<eos> Did he?
Why you kill that boy?<eos> Hey, I'm talking to you!<eos> Annalise had nothing to do with this.<eos> Of course she did.<eos> She loved that kid.<eos> No, she told you to be a good little soldier and take the fall for her.<eos> You deaf, bitch?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> Why'd you kill that boy?<eos> I didn't.
Beg that I might let you live once my armies came, if only as a slave.<eos> I've been a slave for the last seven years.<eos> I won't do it anymore!<eos> I will miss you when you're dead, but only for a minute.<eos> Then you will be forgotten by both time and the world.<eos> Well, she's my kid, too, Cindy.<eos> I have the weekends and...<eos> Well, no, I have the weekends and I don't want a Wednesday afternoon.<eos> Why would I want that?<eos> Yeah, nobody does.
I'm willing to let bygones be bygones.<eos> And if you agree... I think we can settle all this right now with a simple handshake.<eos> Would you all give us the room for a moment?<eos> Seventeen years.<eos> Eighteen in July, actually.<eos> All those years we built this place together.<eos> And all that time I've supported you... looked up to you, deferred to you.<eos> Because I always thought you had the best interests of the firm in mind.<eos> I have.<eos> You did.
The boss wants you to settle this.<eos> I settle it right now, okay?<eos> You have to work together.<eos> It's what the boss wants.<eos> The boss can suck me.<eos> - I'd watch what I say if I were you.<eos> - Who you think you are?<eos> You should be kissing my ass right now.<eos> Me and my family. We built this whole business.<eos> We all did. Together.
Tell me you'll be there.<eos> I'll be there.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> GORDON: Yes, we do.
Good-bye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets - when you were knocked out. - (bullets clink on ground)<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> (chuckles): It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
I told them to move on her.<eos> Since when are they taking orders<eos> I don't know, but I kind of like it. She had something in her hand.<eos> She had her phone in her hand.<eos> Well, it didn't look like her phone, so I told them to move.<eos> I had the situation under control.<eos> She told me that prometheus<eos> Now whether or not that is true, she was going to give us valuable intel on him. She's playing you, Oliver.<eos> I understand that you're suspicious of her, and I know this Laurel is from another earth, that this is not our Laurel, but we don't know why.<eos> We don't.
Because you and I are gonna sit in this office until we figure out a reasonable set of limitations that respects everyone's rights.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Should I order something in?<eos> We might be here a while.<eos> I don't know anything, man.<eos> I don't know--<eos> I know you've seen this scumbag.<eos> He lives in this neighborhood!<eos> I don't know everybody, dude.<eos> I don't!
We're not done, Oliver.<eos> You and me, we're never gonna be done.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Listen, man, you can tell me that you're a serial killer, that you're crazy, or you're whatever Chase has shoved into your head, but I'm not believing any of that, even if you do,<eos> and that's because I know the kind of man you are, Oliver.<eos> The good, the bad, and the ugly I know, and you don't need to punish yourself or isolate yourself, but what you need to do is stop pushing me away because I'm not going anywhere, Oliver!<eos> Do you get that?<eos> What do you want me to do, John?<eos> I've told you what I am, who I am, and even if you don't believe it, I do.<eos> I do.
Well, I know someone who can break it faster.<eos> Kord Industries.<eos> I mean, they set the encryption.<eos> They can break it.<eos> I don't think that Kord is gonna help us hack their stolen tech.<eos> That's why you'll have to break in.<eos> It shouldn't be too hard for Overwatch and Mr. Terrific, who could pull off a heist at Kord.<eos> You told them about our operation?<eos> I didn't.<eos> - How did you...
Well, I asked if you were a couple once.<eos> What did he say?<eos> He said he'd be okay throwing me into space without my helmet, but that you wouldn't like it.<eos> Sounds like Amos, 16-millimeter.<eos> It's kind of hard to explain.<eos> He's like a brother. We look out for each other.<eos> You sure he's clear on that?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> You did hear the part about him throwing me off the ship without my helmet, right?<eos> -I did.
They directed me to an eBay page, and... she was selling all of it.<eos> Who does that?<eos> At first, I thought maybe she needed money, but then... as time went on, I began to think maybe she's planning to kill herself.<eos> What?<eos> Wh-why do you say that?<eos> Because when you wanna die, you give away all your things because you're not gonna need them.<eos> After all, look at me. She's already given me away.<eos> Claire... Trust me, your daughter is not suicidal.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
- What?<eos> - To Emily.<eos> - Oh, wow, surprising.<eos> - Yeah, I know, right?<eos> And it's just a band-aid, it's so fucking obvious.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> But you can't control what he does, and maybe... maybe he really loves her.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> - Well, you don't know that.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Not really.<eos> We ask the Father to judge us with mercy.<eos> We ask the Mother to...<eos> Fuck it, I don't remember the rest.<eos> I'm sorry you're dead.<eos> You deserved better.<eos> Both of you.<eos> Mom.<eos> You should really sleep, Sam.<eos> The dead don't.
No. I mean, like, jail.<eos> Do you believe in the afterlife?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, my mom did.<eos> She used to say,<eos> "All I know is there's more than I know."<eos> Yeah, I think that might sound wiser than it is.<eos> Okay, wiseass.<eos> So you know what happens after you die?<eos> Yes, I do.
Right over there, right at that table over there. That's where he took his last glass of evil, vile fuckin' mead, and made his bargain with the devil himself.<eos> Your piece of shit husband got a new life.<eos> Why don't you?<eos> This one got a new life.<eos> He ain't lookin' back.<eos> I did.<eos> And I'm not.<eos> Shadow made my heart beat again.<eos> Why do men like anal sex?<eos> 'Cause women don't.
It's an old hanging tree.<eos> You like it?<eos> - Evening.<eos> - Evening.<eos> Betty's getting a spit polish.<eos> Stay as long as you like. You'll be safe here.<eos> No, we really should get goin'. Nonsense.<eos> Nonsense!<eos> You're gonna love it here.<eos> Everyone does.
He's the symbol.<eos> If we can take him out, maybe we can limit this to a single bad night.<eos> How the hell are we supposed to find him out there? !<eos> The city's one giant Dumpster fire.<eos> Jerome said he wanted to plunge the city into darkness so people could do what they want, right?<eos> He's not one to miss out on the fun, so what does he want?<eos> A puppy?<eos> How the hell should I know?<eos> I didn't talk to him.<eos> No, but Lee did.
- Yes!<eos> - I confess.<eos> I had her killed.<eos> But guess what?<eos> You should thank me because we both know what would have happened if I hadn't.<eos> I could have lived a life with the woman I loved.<eos> I could have been happy.<eos> No, Ed.<eos> You would have killed her.<eos> Just like you did the other one!
This can't wait.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> To Wayne Manor.<eos> To kill someone.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Well, actually, I'm resigning, and then I'm leaving.<eos> Don't.
Because Nygma wants to make a show of it and make us look bad in the process.<eos> Call the mayor's office.<eos> Tell him we're on our way.<eos> We don't need Nygma for anything.<eos> He should be dead by now.<eos> He's obsessed with finding the answer, which is an easy solution for us.<eos> Once he does, we'll get rid of him.<eos> I promise.<eos> And how's him causing a scene at the theater help us?<eos> It doesn't.
But if you pull that trigger, you'll never get the answer you're looking for.<eos> You fool me once, Jim, shame on you.<eos> You fool me twice... well, that's just not gonna happen.<eos> Then the riddle will go unsolved.<eos> Fine!<eos> Let's go.<eos> Let me get this straight.<eos> So, this limo pulls up literally out of nowhere, and this creepy lady tells you to get in because<eos> "you could be so much more"?<eos> And you did?
I'll be there.<eos> Where are we with Tetch?<eos> Barbara and Nygma gave the mayor's office a list of demands...<eos> friend snuck me a copy.<eos> They also threatened to kill Tetch if we tried to take him back by force.<eos> Half of these would bankrupt the city.<eos> The alternative being there's no city left to bankrupt.<eos> We don't have any cards to play, partner.<eos> We got no moves.<eos> Yes, we do.
Goodbye, Oswald.<eos> I removed the bullets when you were knocked out.<eos> Right before I called them.<eos> In the backseat, the pin I used to unlock my cuffs?<eos> My tiepin.<eos> I thought it should be personal.<eos> You were just trying to make me think I had the upper hand.<eos> It all fell into place.<eos> How did you know that Barbara would show up at the warehouse?<eos> I didn't.
One of us has to die.<eos> Ho!<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> What you doing up there?<eos> Just, uh, hanging out.<eos> What're you... what're you thinking about?<eos> Wally.<eos> He wants me to stay here with him.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Has saying that ever made anyone feel better?<eos> Debatable.<eos> Okay, so look... your fathers aren't perfect, right?<eos> Love isn't perfect.<eos> No, but you can't let your love for somebody cause you to be afraid of what might happen.<eos> You gotta take the good with the bad, no matter what.<eos> - Right.<eos> - And that includes... telling your fathers how you two feel about each other.<eos> All right, you make a convincing argument.<eos> - You do.
What do you say?<eos> Yeah, I got a lot of coffee tastings and some book readings... lot of women left to charm, but I... I'm in.<eos> You know what?<eos> Free coffees for the gang at H.R. Jitters.<eos> Maybe 10% off.<eos> On me, let's go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.
She's gonna kill Cecile. Correct me if I'm wrong, but Tracy is our key to finding Savitar, right?<eos> Yes, but what are we gonna do?<eos> We gonna just let Killer Frost live up to her name and kill somebody?<eos> Not if I have anything to say about it. All I'm saying is, we need to do whatever it takes to save her.<eos> No one's gonna die, all right?<eos> We're gonna get her back.<eos> That's them.<eos> They're at the old Dressler Factory. Okay, we know where they are.<eos> That's something.<eos> So what do we do?
You will now.<eos> Just put 'em on.<eos> - You'll be okay.<eos> - Just don't get them wet.<eos> - Your Honor, I... - What?<eos> Wh...<eos> I call Barry Allen to the stand.<eos> Raise your right hand, please.<eos> You swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do, yes.
Your family.<eos> Caitlin, I can fix you.<eos> You already tried.<eos> Well then, I'll try harder.<eos> I don't care what it takes.<eos> I don't care what I have to do.<eos> I swear to you, I will find you a cure.<eos> Caitlin, I love you.<eos> I don't love you, Julian.<eos> I never did.
It doesn't belong to you.<eos> It is in Elena's blood.<eos> She would want to save all of us, and you know it.<eos> Anyway, I've done the math.<eos> It can work.<eos> How can you be so sure?<eos> It's not about being sure.<eos> It's about using what we've got.<eos> Unless you have a plan âDâ.<eos> No, I don't.
Doesn't matter.<eos> It's just one person.<eos> You are not going to give up.<eos> You are going to keep fighting.<eos> You are going to live.<eos> You are going to stay alive so you can make all of this right.<eos> Cutting it pretty close.<eos> Story of my life.<eos> How do I know you're gonna keep up your end?<eos> You don't.
Look, um...<eos> I know it wasn't about the wedding.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just when I think about what our lives are supposed to look like now,<eos> I just can't see it.<eos> Ten years from now... 20, 50... we're gonna be living entirely different lives, and we can't just... ignore that.<eos> But... it doesn't mean we have to just... throw all this away because it's not what we wanted or expected.<eos> I just have no idea how to make this right.<eos> I don't either.
I-I just need time.<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> But take it from me, if you hold on to hating him, it will eat at you.<eos> Why the hell does Cade want to meet here?<eos> Beats me.<eos> He doesn't wear the cape or carry the pitchfork, so maybe that's just his way of being dramatic.<eos> Things have a way of getting bloody with Cade.<eos> We may not have another chance, so... do you want to tell me why you were planning on leaving town?<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't.
I won't.<eos> I understand.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm sorry in ways that I didn't even know existed.<eos> I know that I am one step removed from the reason that you lost Enzo.<eos> So I am extremely grateful that you're even sitting here being my friend right now.<eos> Bonnie, I love you so much.<eos> So much.<eos> Please know that.<eos> I do.
A lot.<eos> Whoever did this is no better than he was.<eos> Lucifer. There's something very important we need to discuss.<eos> New visitors policy.<eos> Hot women turning up unannounced are no longer welcome.<eos> Especially those who are secretly my mother.<eos> Well, I think you'll make an exception when you hear what I have to say.<eos> Well, spit it out.<eos> I don't have an eternity here.<eos> Oh, yes. Actually, I do.
Well, normally, I would agree with you.<eos> But you insist on letting an impossibly attractive flight attendant come between us.<eos> And not in the fun way.<eos> Lucifer, we are very different people with very different personalities, and I'm not judging.<eos> I'm a homicide detective, not the slut police.<eos> And I mean you, not her.<eos> Nothing happened after you left.<eos> But what I'm saying is things have changed now, since we had our moment.<eos> We didn't have a moment.<eos> Yes we did.
What you need to do is shut up.<eos> - Oh, Lord...<eos> - Bitch!<eos> - You know what...<eos> Ma, Ma! - What you need<eos> - is your ass beat!<eos> - Mom, please.<eos> - You don't want none of this.<eos> - Please, please. No.<eos> - Yeah. - She don't.
Using the bracelet has consequences.<eos> You should know that.<eos> I know all about consequences.<eos> You were happy enough for Harry to use the bracelet when it suited your purposes, weren't you?<eos> I'm not the one lying to Harry.<eos> All you've done is lie, Eve.<eos> To me.<eos> To Harry.<eos> Does he know you put this on my wrist?<eos> He doesn't, does he?
First law of our job.<eos> (DOOR OPENS)<eos> How can you subject me to this?<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> This is the kindest way I could deal with you.<eos> It's mercy.<eos> Something you showed none of your victims.<eos> I don't want that mercy.<eos> JOHNNY: No, what I'm saying is, stop shutting me out.<eos> - ANNA: I hardly do that.
Dr. Sekara, how's he doing?<eos> Uh, all's well in the neuromonitor.<eos> - Dr. Sharpe? - B.P.'s steady so far.<eos> I don't know how you two are so calm.<eos> No, no. I'm not calm.<eos> I'm screaming inside.<eos> If that makes you feel any better.<eos> - Actually, no.<eos> - You got this, Dana.<eos> No, of course I do.
It's this way.<eos> Mind... mind the step here.<eos> Uh, as you'll see, the frame is boarded over, but the, uh, the door itself is intact.<eos> The damage is mainly to the doorjamb and the casing.<eos> There's another step up here.<eos> - Break-in?<eos> - That's right.<eos> Went after your copper wire, from the look of it.<eos> There was a time... remember? When we could leave our doors unlocked.<eos> I certainly do.
Uh, the clerk is going to collect your, uh, cellphones, watches, key fobs -- anything electrical.<eos> If you prefer not to, please secure your items outside this room. Thank you.<eos> Thank you for understanding.<eos> Your phone, sir?<eos> I left it in the car.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> -Sorry.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Alan loved to hike.<eos> We even opened a camping-supply store.<eos> I helped him with the mail-order side of it.<eos> And then, uh... this was eight years ago... he went hiking in Gila National and never came back.<eos> They found our car, but they never found him.<eos> And I don't know if... he slipped and fell or had a heart attack or met someone who didn't like the way he looked...<eos> I don't know.<eos> And even after all these years, not knowing how he passed or where he is...<eos> I wish it didn't matter.<eos> But it does.
He's here so my husband can't force him to give him his technology.<eos> Howard knew about it, pursued it... in secret, away from us, from this company.<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> There's only one explanation.<eos> Howard is no longer working for this company.<eos> He is working against it.<eos> It's simple.<eos> Snatch, grab, and go.<eos> It'd be a lot simpler if we had real bullets.<eos> - They do.
That's the answer I needed.<eos> We're good to go.<eos> System's up.<eos> Process every image... satellite,<eos> CCTV, MTA, DMV, Snapchat... everything.<eos> I want to know the second you get a hit.<eos> If we find her, what's gonna happen to her?<eos> Justice.<eos> I loved her once.<eos> In some ways, I still do.
Hey!<eos> You tell me.<eos> - Know what the best part is?<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> But what do you think it is?<eos> I did this on my own.<eos> I personally told the art department to do this for me, all by myself.<eos> So instead of withstanding rubble, the Rumbrella needs to repel...<eos> Did Van Photoshop himself into that?<eos> Yes, he did.
Their plan?<eos> All I know is the location of the safe house from where they are going to stage their attack.<eos> Ever since I arrived, someone has been trying to kill me.<eos> The Iranians don't even know you exist.<eos> What about Mossad?<eos> Why would they want to kill you?<eos> My money's on the Iranians.<eos> You don't believe her own agency would be trying to kill her?<eos> You do?<eos> My God, you do.
You're in a very good place right now, Mr. Andrews.<eos> Varsity football, AP music tutorials.<eos> This morning, in the hallway, you wouldn't meet my eyes. Why?<eos> I was distracted. I wasn't feeling well. Archie...<eos> If there's something you want to get off your chest, perhaps about Jason, now would be the time.<eos> Weatherbee just asked me if I knew anything about Jason.<eos> And?<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> That I didn't.
Let's make some noise!<eos> Put your hands together for the Riverdale Bulldogs!<eos> Cheryl?<eos> Cheryl, what is it?<eos> What happened?<eos> Jason.<eos> He's gone...<eos> I know.<eos> I know he is.<eos> No, you don't.
Plus, I'm trying to avoid the Blossoms.<eos> If they find out your father is the one who bought the drive-in, it'll be open war.<eos> Against us?<eos> They're making a play for the land, hoping to stop construction.<eos> Fred and I are trying to keep it on track, but...<eos> But Mr. Andrews still doesn't know that Daddy is the buyer?<eos> All of which is to say the timing of this shower is just...<eos> It's not ideal.<eos> Plus, I can't believe Alice even wants to come, from what you've told me.<eos> She doesn't.
We're on borrowed time.<eos> What the hell is that supposed to mean?<eos> Betty, I'm not one of your projects, okay?<eos> Like solving Jason's murder... No.<eos> You're not a project, you're my boyfriend.<eos> Until you're sick of slumming it with me, or until Archie changes his mind and says he wants to be with you?<eos> Valerie, hey... - I'm looking for Melody.<eos> - No, no, no, can we talk?<eos> I just wanted to say what if... What if we made a mistake?<eos> First of all, we didn't do anything.
- [Sighs]<eos> - You all right?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Also, stop doing that.<eos> Doing what?<eos> Coming up to me with your concern.<eos> You don't get to do that anymore.<eos> Come on.<eos> You didn't choose me.<eos> Nobody does.
You are... wrong.<eos> Congratulations on your promotion, Marcus.<eos> You earned it.<eos> ♪<eos> Wait, is that what you're thinking?<eos> That I shouldn't marry Charlie?<eos> Because yesterday, it seemed like you...<eos> I'm thinking we have a lot of footage...<eos> Thousands of hours to go through.<eos> No, we don't.
Yeah, uh, thanks for bringing them here, Mr., um...<eos> Rankin!<eos> Todd Rankin!<eos> We have met a thousand times!<eos> I teach art and design!<eos> I think you should stop shouting at these kids, Mr. Rankin.<eos> They've done us all a big favor.<eos> Saved your job.<eos> How'd you know that would work?<eos> I didn't.
Thank God for second chances.<eos> Keep your guard up.<eos> Oh, we told him that he could be whatever he wanted when he grew up.<eos> So, for Halloween he was a Superman-Digimon- astronaut combo.<eos> Super-maut!<eos> Oh, I love it!<eos> Signs of indecision appear early in life, Holden.<eos> Mom, Charlie doesn't want to see<eos> - what happened when I was six.<eos> - Yes, I do!

This is why you're alone.<eos> I... I'm gonna send Gracie back down to you.<eos> You are about to enter a select group.<eos> The question for humanity is not where we have been.<eos> It's where we are going.<eos> Are you prepared to accept that truth?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> Will you safeguard the secrets of our movement, even from friends and family?<eos> And do you accept that the punishment for violating your oaths will fall not just upon you, but upon everyone you love?<eos> - I do.
She said it was dirty.<eos> How can love be dirty?<eos> Well, if it isn't, I expect you're not doing it right.<eos> I thought that went well.<eos> Apart from that little bit of unpleasantness.<eos> Well, some of your supporters have just beaten the living daylights out of him.<eos> - You're mistaken.<eos> - I saw it, Mrs Pettybon.<eos> But you did ever so well.<eos> - Didn't she, Reverend?
I will not...<eos> I am being set up by Olivia Pope.<eos> She is trying to frame me for murdering Frankie.<eos> She is trying to steal the presidency.<eos> That is what is going on here, and I am not going to let it happen, okay?<eos> Now, I just need to take a minute and make some calls.<eos> I will get this figured out.<eos> And to answer your question... no, I didn't do it.<eos> I didn't ask you that.<eos> You did.
Thank God.<eos> Tell them...<eos> We're friends.<eos> Cyrus! I crawled across the lawn to get here.<eos> My hands touched the ground.<eos> Let me in.<eos> What do you want, Liz?<eos> What do I want?<eos> I want to help.<eos> No. No, you don't.
Really, I-I-I would never ask out a stewardess that-- that works for me.<eos> No. We were actually fixed up by my cousin...<eos> - Yeah. - ...who knew Brad in the Air Force.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So, you... And I thought this life of his was so glamorous- all the travel, and...<eos> - I warned her.<eos> Now I'm on the road four nights a week, and I have to wear these tight, tight uniforms,<eos> - and I can't gain any weight. - And she has to work<eos> - for jerks like me.<eos> - With. We don't technically
-He did.<eos> I hope he comes back soon.<eos> I remember how happy he was to see me.<eos> When he sees you... his heart will probably stop.<eos> It doesn't look like him.<eos> Should have been carved by someone who knew his face.<eos> Everyone who knew his face is dead.<eos> We're not.<eos> They say you killed Joffrey.<eos> Did you?
- Did he think I chose it...<eos> - What do you want?<eos> !<eos> Daenerys will win this war.<eos> You're a military man.<eos> You must know there's no way around that.<eos> Daenerys is not her father.<eos> She's even willing to suspend the hostilities if Cersei agrees to certain terms.<eos> If you want Cersei to bend the knee, you can ask her yourself.<eos> I... I don't.
Not right now, anyway.<eos> She has a more important request.<eos> I wasn't sure I'd find you.<eos> Thought you might still be rowing.<eos> I looked in shops, taverns, brothels.<eos> Should have known to come straight to the Street of Steel.<eos> Aren't you worried about the gold cloaks?<eos> Haven't been here in years.<eos> Why should they recognize me?<eos> Sometimes I hardly do.
I'm saying you're gonna need to change your plans here.<eos> All due respect, Ms. Whelan, the Chief of Staff doesn't make these decisions.<eos> The President does.<eos> With all due respect, Ms. Webster,<eos> I speak for the President.<eos> Right here, right now, I am the President.<eos> And I'm telling you this isn't a death penalty case anymore.<eos> Do I have to make myself more clear?<eos> Because I certainly can.<eos> Do I?
- Sir, you cannot be in here.<eos> - I promise. I promise, okay?<eos> I promise, baby.<eos> - Please.<eos> - All right, okay.<eos> I love you, Deacon.<eos> I love you, Rayna.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't!
And I know y'all are having a great time.<eos> But I just need you to know that this can't stay like this forever.<eos> Dad, she did nothing wrong. She's helping.<eos> I didn't say she did anything wrong.<eos> I know she didn't...<eos> So you're gonna put her back in the streets?<eos> No... Look.<eos> We know she has parents.<eos> - We know that now.<eos> - No, no, she doesn't.
- Okay,<eos> - I'm coming in.<eos> - No. That's not what I meant.<eos> I know what you meant.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can't believe all this is happening.<eos> I was really just trying to stand up for him.<eos> I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.
I know that.<eos> He knows it too.<eos> No one else does.<eos> They all think I'm this spoiled brat.<eos> - Oh, come on...<eos> - I know.<eos> Disrespected the cops.<eos> And they think I'm the worst.<eos> And so does Clay.<eos> No, he does not.
Oh, are you kidding?<eos> Enough to deserve that sandwich.<eos> - Go make yourself a sammy!<eos> - I'll make sandwiches.<eos> No! He can make his own sandwich!<eos> Why should he make his own sandwich?<eos> - A guy that's loaned us $75,000?<eos> - What?<eos> Well, I know I'm not supposed to say anything...<eos> Then don't!
It was Cyrus Beene.<eos> He killed Frankie Vargas.<eos> And then my father ordered Jake to kill her.<eos> It's time for you to take what's yours, son.<eos> It's time to come home.<eos> But Jake didn't kill her.<eos> Because she's an innocent victim.<eos> Well, that's never been a problem for Jake.<eos> Jake believes my father might have some bigger plan, and that Jennifer could be the key to figuring it out. What?<eos> And you don't?
The guy.<eos> Your guy.<eos> The one you plucked from relative obscurity.<eos> Left the White House for, hitched your wagon to.<eos> The one.<eos> Some people have it, Red.<eos> A brilliancy, charisma, breeding.<eos> Of course, the strong jaw and glorious hairline don't exactly hurt, either.<eos> Fitz had it.<eos> Frankie does, too.
For the love of...<eos> Get off your cross!<eos> Like you never murdered anybody?<eos> ! Like you never stole an oval or two?<eos> !<eos> This is the Oval!<eos> I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!
Get off your cross!<eos> Like you never murdered anybody?<eos> ! Like you never stole an oval or two?<eos> !<eos> This is the Oval!<eos> I was born for this!<eos> This is mine!<eos> You don't want to win this way.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> You don't!
And our greenhouse is over here!<eos> We raise all our own livestock, uh, there's a fish farm.<eos> We have everything we need!<eos> All these people are chosen from every part of the world.<eos> Why are they here?<eos> To genetically improve the human race!<eos> We all contribute and we all benefit.<eos> I-I had some pretty beneficial science stolen from me.<eos> Do you know a Rachel Duncan?<eos> Oh, we do now.
I don't need anything.<eos> Just... where's Helena?<eos> - She's out hunting.<eos> - Trapping.<eos> It's all categorized as hunting, Donnie.<eos> I know, but specifically, she's trapping.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is dire, Donnie.<eos> He needs some ideas of a concrete plan on how to save Kira.<eos> No, no, no. I don't, Donnie.
I mean, I feel like I already know the answer, but are you crazy?<eos> How are they my responsibility?<eos> Because your crooked boss took a payoff to let them off that boat.<eos> What am I supposed to do with them?<eos> Get 'em jobs.<eos> There are plenty of Chinese restaurants, laundries...<eos> Now who's racist? No.<eos> Because those are places where other Chinese people already work.<eos> They don't speak English, dumb-ass.<eos> I do little bit.
MURPHY: You're just disappointed 'cause it's not a robot.<eos> Trust me, these dogs know what they're doing.<eos> It's possible to love robots and dogs, you know.<eos> - [Murphy sighs] - You ever watch The Jetsons?<eos> The what?<eos> Okay, here's the address.<eos> Sending the location now.<eos> Squad, 1305, copy that.<eos> Who lives there?<eos> GOSS: Who doesn't, more like it.
Their weapons are powering down.<eos> What did you just do?<eos> She's gonna end this.<eos> You just invoked a trial by combat created by barbarians!<eos> It's been around since we crawled out of the caves on Daxam with rocks and sticks.<eos> If I win, she goes.<eos> They all go.<eos> They are bound by ancient law to leave this planet in peace.<eos> - She's not gonna win.<eos> - But what if she does?
It's done.<eos> Turn it on.<eos> We can end this.<eos> Hey, no, no, no, wait!<eos> No, you can't do that.<eos> - There's too much at stake to wait.<eos> - Mother!<eos> WINN: No!<eos> You said it worked.<eos> Oh, it does.
And your ex-husband placed it at the cemetery.<eos> He needed line of sight to see that we'd found the bomb.<eos> That's why he blew it.<eos> What... what you're saying just isn't possible.<eos> Nothing else makes sense.<eos> They may be right.<eos> It was definitely your ex-husband, ma'am.<eos> No question.<eos> How does that make sense?<eos> 'Cause it... it doesn't.
Now, I know you're upset about the gun and no one here is trying to minimize that.<eos> May I ask what is so funny?<eos> You look just like your dummy right now.<eos> What?<eos> Is there a hole in my face?<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> And it's going, "Wah wah wah..."<eos> - Oh, God. The pot's kicking in.<eos> - No, no, no, it doesn't affect me.<eos> Yeah, it does, Mom.
These are the ashes from which you'll rise as a phoenix of comedy, Pete! Got it.<eos> Pete, you're moving on.<eos> You're free, Pete!<eos> You know I did that for you, man.<eos> Did you a solid.<eos> That's one way to handle it.<eos> That was a big swing.<eos> What a grand ending to your guys's union.<eos> And also... Super Nintendo. You wanna play when we get home tonight?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Like she'd noticed, actually noticed, all the extra chips.<eos> Do you know what I realised?<eos> She was fat.<eos> I'd fatted her.<eos> But that's life, isn't it?<eos> Beauty or chips. I like chips.<eos> So did she.<eos> So that's OK.<eos> And how does that in any way explain why you keep coming to my lectures?<eos> Yeah, it doesn't really, does it?
Sure.<eos> Let's find a cozy spot.<eos> So... okay.<eos> Um... you want to see some of the herbs and spices?<eos> - Uh-huh.<eos> - Hey, you like cinnamon?<eos> We got some cinnamon sticks right over here.<eos> You know where cinnamon comes from?<eos> - Do you?<eos> - Actually, I do.
Beard.<eos> - I don't know this guy.<eos> - What?<eos> You don't?<eos> - After all this?<eos> - No, I mean,<eos> I don't know him personally.<eos> He's the guy from the park.<eos> Monroe, do you know him or not?<eos> Yes! We both do!
This isn't exactly something you put in a living will.<eos> Monroe and I made an agreement that if one of us is suffering from dementia, the other will contact the Gevatter Tod.<eos> - You serious?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It's a commitment we made to each other.<eos> It's how Wesen have stayed in secret for so long.<eos> I know it sounds callous, but it's how our community works.<eos> And you know this Gevatter Tod?<eos> Do you know how to make contact?<eos> Yeah, we do.
- We gotta go. We got to go.<eos> Good?<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> C-Cover it.<eos> What about this is so funny to you, huh?<eos> Look, you remember when you and Pope duct taped this to that shopping cart when we were kids, with the, uh, Roman candles on the side?<eos> Sent it down Quarry Hill?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Why not?<eos> - Because I'm not.<eos> In that case, maybe you're ready to talk about a merger.<eos> Robert, what are you doing here?<eos> Jessica didn't tell you?<eos> Before she left, I offered her a lifeline, and now I'm gonna offer the same thing to you.<eos> We appreciate your offer, but...<eos> But what?<eos> But we don't need your charity.<eos> Yes, you do.
And I find it hard to believe that you didn't know about it the whole time.<eos> And since then, he's paid his dues.<eos> And what about you?<eos> What about me?<eos> Do you think the committee would have me break up with the man that I love just because he went to prison?<eos> What does that say about character and fitness?<eos> You make a good point.<eos> And if I were you, I'd be prepared with some others, 'cause I'd say one day soon, you're gonna have to make your case.<eos> And do you think I have a better chance of making my case if I work for my father instead of at Pearson Specter Litt?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's exactly what I'm telling you.<eos> I didn't even know about it till you just showed up here and told me.<eos> Then why did I get five calls from five different legal clinics all asking about your case?<eos> Because the day after I got out, I followed through on my promise to that jury to try to do some good.<eos> If that's all you came here to say, why don't you leave me alone?<eos> I've had a rough day.<eos> I'm gonna leave you alone but not before I tell you what I tried to tell your old boss.<eos> You want to do good, be my guest, but do it in another profession, because if I ever even catch wind of you trying to get work at any of these places, you can bet your ass I will do everything I can to stop it.<eos> Did you know what Louis was up to?<eos> I did.
God, I don't want to be involved, okay?<eos> Okay, well, you are involved, Pete.<eos> I'm thinking about the future, my future, Jess's future.<eos> We need it. So what?<eos> You want me to lie?<eos> I... I walked in on you!<eos> I saw you having sex with another woman!<eos> My wife! Maybe you didn't, maybe you did.<eos> What?<eos> Maybe you did not.
Um... What is the secret to a happy marriage, would you say?<eos> - Love.<eos> - That's great.<eos> Yeah, you can... We can clap for love.<eos> This guy's not clapping. Uh, you're not...<eos> Do you think it's love?<eos> Yeah... and oral.<eos> That's not exactly a Rachael Ray Show kind of joke, but, look, they love it, they love it.<eos> Oral, Elsa. Elsa, do you think oral, is that a part of a happy marriage?<eos> Everybody ha... Everybody does it. Sex?
What... what did you do?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I get a little bit enthusiastic sometimes.<eos> I'll be gentle.<eos> You've been in bed all day.<eos> I came to check on you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I'm f-f-fine.<eos> Uh, are you sure you still want...<eos> Uh, I-I do.
I think he meant well.<eos> He probably didn't know how hard it would be to clean out.<eos> And now magic is failing on Earth... because of shit, proving once again that comedy and tragedy can coexist in the same goddamn sentence.<eos> Honestly... I am in over my head.<eos> I am not even in control of which world my body is awake in, and my sexually aggressive wife, she could wake me up at any moment in Fillory.<eos> Eliot, there are certain student/teacher boundaries which I'd prefer not to cross.<eos> So what am I supposed to do, Henry?<eos> What did you think was going to happen when you dove headfirst into another world?<eos> I thought I'd die.<eos> But you didn't.
I'll put my whole foot in, I swear.<eos> - Please don't... No!<eos> No, I am not kidding you, Courtney.<eos> I will let you go as a client.<eos> - I didn't wanna have to say that. - Oh, my God.<eos> Do not put your foot in the pool, or the career is done.<eos> And I'm not... I'm not messing with you.<eos> - Oh, God. - I don't care what you're saying.<eos> Okay, you did it!<eos> You did it! You did the foot.
Old-Timey Treasures, Twigs and Twat.<eos> These all sound like songs Joni Mitchell jerks off to.<eos> It's not me.<eos> - I'm cool.<eos> - You're hip.<eos> You're fab, you're totally gear.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't know, man, why don't you just call it Sophia's Joint. Change it when you think of something better.<eos> We all know what happened to Skeleton Key when they re-launched Miss Theo Goes Vintage.<eos> We do?
- How do you figure?<eos> - Sophia.<eos> You're a woman who started a business from nothing.<eos> You pushed through the pins and made an impression on the world that wasn't there before.<eos> If you quit now, you're just a girl with a bunch of old clothes.<eos> That jumpsuit is good.<eos> It'll sell.<eos> Kaavi's website is perfect.<eos> You believe me when I say it's gonna be okay. Right?<eos> I do.
And then you just fucking lied.<eos> You just kept lying to me.<eos> Texting.<eos> Texting me to come over like nothing fucking happened.<eos> Did rehearsal even go late?<eos> I mean, is there even an album?<eos> You're so beautiful.<eos> Stop it.<eos> God, I fucked up.<eos> You did.
'Cause it's not... it's not quite clear from the script.<eos> Could be the heavenly host or different angels calling up from Earth.<eos> Your goal is to reassure the faithful, et cetera.<eos> Okay. alright.<eos> Alright.<eos> Got it.<eos> Who are you?<eos> I am the alpha and the omega...<eos> Could I start one more time, please? That...<eos> I didn't...
I like talking.<eos> He can talk to me too.<eos> Say something, like, um, um... spaghetti.<eos> Er, no, no, no, no. No, Mississippi! S...<eos> Say Mississippi.<eos> Come on ass face, say Mississippi.<eos> Say it.<eos> Stop!<eos> Or what?<eos> Just... don't.
And they love him.<eos> He's already got, like, two night shifts.<eos> So we're good.<eos> Right?<eos> How are you, Dany?<eos> My dog died.<eos> So when are you two coming back to work for me?<eos> We're not.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
It's disgusting.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> Things went sideways on your last job and it threw you.<eos> But this is not the answer.<eos> This is what you do.<eos> Better than almost anyone else I know.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> People change.<eos> What?<eos> No, they don't.
Take this with you.<eos> It's a protection charm.<eos> I made it for Adam when he was born.<eos> I keep it in his room.<eos> He sleeps with it sometimes.<eos> I thought that maybe, if you have this...<eos> Every little bit helps.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey. Hey... I got to go.<eos> No, you don't.
Alpha Station survived for 97 years in space through elevated radiation levels and extreme temperature fluctuations.<eos> Sound familiar?<eos> All we have to do is patch up the ship.<eos> We're standing in our viable solution.<eos> Raven says we can get it sealed up in a month.<eos> - The Ark is our ark.<eos> - I get it.<eos> Ok, so freeze-dried meat until we can grow our own food.<eos> We got oxygen scrubbers, but hot do we store enough water for 500 people?<eos> We don't.
I took the base offline.<eos> You're no longer in the system.<eos> There's nowhere for you to go.<eos> Where's my sister?<eos> Probably best that she's not here for this.<eos> What the f...<eos> Guess now we know what your power is.<eos> - He's here.<eos> - We don't know that.<eos> Okay, now we do.
Of what?<eos> S.H.I.E.L.D. claims to be a beacon for humanity.<eos> What it really is is a safe haven for Inhumanity.<eos> They... will come for me.<eos> That is the plan.<eos> Preparations here are nearly completed.<eos> That is nearly a satisfying report.<eos> If you're done playing with your food, there is still work to be done.<eos> Metaphor.<eos> Well done.
We have replaced the top operatives at S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> Now the next phase begins.<eos> And you will be integral to that.<eos> You have not yet served your purpose.<eos> "Even filth has a purpose."<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> Say it.<eos> - No.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I already did.
I, um... I mean, I did.<eos> And you're right... it's a bad idea.<eos> I just need some time, some space.<eos> Skye... there are things about me that you wouldn't like if you knew.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I know.<eos> It's that way.<eos> Kill me already.<eos> Hey, you ever finish the Saunders report?<eos> Of course you did.
Why?<eos> So you can blow his brains out?<eos> I could never hurt him.<eos> I only want to talk.<eos> Now make the call.<eos> Yes, Father?<eos> Listen to me very carefully, son.<eos> You know I've always loved you.<eos> Only ever wanted what was best for you.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
- overbearing father figure.<eos> - Just like Ward.<eos> I'm just like Ward.<eos> How can she even look me in the eye?<eos> Or even stand the sight of me at all?<eos> How can she stomach it?<eos> The memory of seeing me shoot that woman...<eos> Um, you know, the reason I... wanted to get closer to you in the first place was to try to understand what you two felt for each other...<eos> You and Jemma.<eos> - And I finally do. - Yeah.
Jeannie?<eos> I've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> I've been here.<eos> Come on.<eos> What happens when someone dies?<eos> What?<eos> What happens when someone dies?<eos> If they're good, they go to Heaven.<eos> Who knows if they're good?<eos> God does.
I fail to see how this concerns me.<eos> Margaret Wells is behind it.<eos> You could have had her whipped and transported but you left her at liberty.<eos> Justice cannot stoop to a pointless vendetta between two bawds.<eos> What exactly did justice stoop to when it asked me to kidnap an innocent girl?<eos> This is a trifling matter, madam.<eos> Take your scandal sheet and go.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> I do not have the superior force of male reason willing my actions.<eos> As you and your powerful friends do.
We want some cunny!<eos> We want cunny, we want cunny!<eos> - All right, calm down.<eos> - I want her.<eos> I want her!<eos> Emily Lacey is laughing at your fate.<eos> Mumma, she can't have known what would happen.<eos> She would have killed you stone dead if it had suited her purpose.<eos> Let's forget she was ever here.<eos> You do that, my treasure.
I've never had this.<eos> It's my own money.<eos> It is a solace.<eos> It's hope that I can buy back my children.<eos> When were you freed, Mr. North?<eos> I was born a free Englishman.<eos> Foundling.<eos> I'm sorry for assuming...<eos> This is the trinket my mother left, to know me by when she returned.<eos> Only she never did.
Some of them were pretty far along.<eos> Yeah, well, that's not going to happen to you.<eos> You know Linda from Marketing?<eos> yeah. She actually carried to term but her son only lived a few days.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> But you don't know that, Moira, okay?<eos> You don't know that.<eos> It could happen.<eos> Okay, all right, um...<eos> If it does...
It doesn't matter where I got it.<eos> It's out there.<eos> You can't be sure Neil knew this.<eos> What difference does that make?<eos> Because if he didn't know, it's just bad luck.<eos> Harvey, he's the goddamn CEO.<eos> He knew.<eos> He kept it from us, and he kept it from the guys buying his company.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Whatever it is, it's gonna have to wait until tomorrow, because if you don't get over there before that money changes hands, you are opening us up to a shitload of trouble.<eos> Kind of creepy in here at night, isn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I find it kind of peaceful.<eos> Then why get rid of it?<eos> And more importantly, why'd you need the sale to go through so quickly?<eos> I told you, I have another opportunity.<eos> And what if I said the real reason was you knew you vodka business was about to be sued for using another brand's recipe?<eos> I would say I did not know that.<eos> - Well, now you do.
Julius, please.<eos> I need this.<eos> [paper rustles]<eos> This is the address.<eos> It's tomorrow at 9:00.<eos> I don't have anyone else.<eos> [dramatic music]<eos> [elevator dings]<eos> Harvey, tell me you got some good news.<eos> I do.
You don't even know what it is.<eos> I don't care what it is.<eos> I'm not getting into the Bar if it means getting you kicked out.<eos> Mike, she wants me.<eos> She always has.<eos> No, Harvey.<eos> She wants both of us.<eos> And she's not going to stop until she gets both of us.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
It's cold. Yeah, but it hasn't even snowed yet.<eos> They say it may not at all this year.<eos> Well, that's depressing.<eos> When I was in college, I used to go to the English department to study.<eos> And there was a fireplace, and it was warm.<eos> I was all by myself.<eos> That sounds safe. Flammable material...<eos> It was magical. Yeah.<eos> It was very romantic by myself.<eos> So, uh, in college, did you and Moira ever...
Don't worry.<eos> - Did you just "Psst"?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> So, we're stuck in the most dangerous planet in the galaxy.<eos> We don't have our powers, and you're optimistic how?<eos> Because they need us to be.<eos> See, this is what I've been telling you.<eos> Kara, you know, if you go looking for trouble, you will always find it.<eos> And you do.
Livewire is the name you called yourself...<eos> After Supergirl ruined my life.<eos> Let's talk about her.<eos> Supergirl.<eos> Yes, Doc, let's.<eos> Let's.<eos> Let's talk about when I get out of this pathetic prison and these silly little cuffs.<eos> When I fry Supergirl from the inside out.<eos> You think she'll scream as she cooks?<eos> I do.
No!<eos> I should've gotten there sooner.<eos> I mean, if these guys hadn't come in then I would've...<eos> - We'll get her back, Winn.<eos> - You don't know that, okay?<eos> We don't know anything, all right?<eos> Hank, are you sure you can't get anything from this guy?<eos> Cadmus must've found a way to shield his thoughts from me.<eos> But we will find something, Winn.<eos> We always do.
She would never.<eos> That...<eos> Hey.<eos> We got your call.<eos> You okay, bro?<eos> A heads up next time would be nice before you arrest my friend.<eos> Come on, you know that's not how this works.<eos> I don't intervene with your job and you don't question mine.<eos> You better have proof.<eos> She doesn't.
He did not say that.<eos> He said we can't attack them.<eos> We can still talk to her.<eos> Then you can get her to realize that all she really wants is for you to be happy.<eos> And then she'll realize that Earth is the best place for you.<eos> Your mother can change.<eos> You just have to talk to her.<eos> People don't really change.<eos> Sure they do.<eos> You did.
Right?<eos> Plus she's cool.<eos> I mean, some would say it's your...<eos> I mean, it is your duty, so, just please?<eos> - I already regret this. - Ah! Hey!<eos> Yeah, get in.<eos> Why me?<eos> You warned the aliens about Cadmus.<eos> - You want to help people.<eos> - I do.
I'm just operating on instinct, Ken.<eos> -Did you come down here with an agenda?<eos> -No. I mean... I have been trying to reach Frank, but today was just...<eos> I saw that you were appearing at an event and I showed up to say hi.<eos> I... I really do work around here, on a street called "Wall," you know?<eos> But then you made reference to something about two very close friends that's nobody's business, including yours.<eos> And you even said so yourself, Ken, that you have an awfully big mouth.<eos> I lost a dear friend.<eos> I loved Tim.<eos> Everybody did.
All I see is a petulant prince.<eos> Always with the insults.<eos> You never do learn.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> My time in your dungeon clarified my priorities.<eos> My concerns are with my child.<eos> And as for you, I can imagine no better revenge than leaving you to the endless struggle to prove yourself my better.<eos> You're welcome, by the way.<eos> So you knew this Crescent girl?<eos> I did.
This place... this city... a lot of tragedy happened here.<eos> A lot I regret.<eos> But Hope was born here.<eos> So there was good with all that bad.<eos> After everything that's happened, the city is yours.<eos> I hope it brings you peace.<eos> Good-bye, Marcel.<eos> Do one thing for me.<eos> Tell your daughter she doesn't need to fear me.<eos> She never did.
Is that really the reason why you hate her so much?<eos> [chuckles]<eos> Okay.<eos> [lighter clicking]<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> The main gas line's got to be down here.<eos> At least it'll help torch the place faster, unless you prefer a slow burn.<eos> Thought you wanted to wait it out.<eos> [gas hissing]<eos> Do you?
You can see how clever a God is when a woman is so beautiful as Mistress Castell.<eos> A maid must hear all kinds of things.<eos> Er, I hear noises at night.<eos> Your tongue is in my mouth.<eos> Don't you feel no desire?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> My own tongue is in there.<eos> Don't tell your mistress about us - understand?<eos> The doctor he do seem fond of her.<eos> Er, he do.

No idea.<eos> Stole it.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> - Yep.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, actually, because I felt like it.<eos> - What if I steal it from you?<eos> - On you go, then.<eos> I don't know how it works.<eos> Well, neither did I.
There's one of these growing outside the student union.<eos> It smells amazing.<eos> Rosemary.<eos> I'm smelling home 20 light years from home.<eos> Thanks for bringing me.<eos> This is a great day out.<eos> I mean, come on, admit it.<eos> You love it.<eos> Did I say I didn't love it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Just an old house and a dodgy landlord, which is pretty standard for students.<eos> I'll see you later for more exciting TARDIS action, but, basically, this is the bit of my life that you're not in.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I know what you mean. Thanks.<eos> So, up the wooden hill you go.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> OK...<eos> Maybe before you do, you should check on your friend, who hasn't been seen for a day and who has strange music coming out of his room.<eos> They said he just does that.<eos> Nobody "just does" anything.
I think it's really dangerous to seek personal fulfillment through romantic relationships.<eos> I do.
No, I'm good.<eos> And you know what?<eos> What?<eos> - Mature.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jessica.<eos> What?<eos> I really like you.<eos> Yeah, Boone.<eos> Of course, you do.
And you know what?<eos> What?<eos> - Mature.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jessica.<eos> What?<eos> I really like you.<eos> Yeah, Boone.<eos> Of course, you do.<eos> Everybody does.
- You came.<eos> - I'm so glad. - Hey... oh.<eos> I... Hey, hey, wait, I actually, um... I just came to give you this.<eos> It's your logo.<eos> I've got a couple different color options depending on whether you want to put it on a submarine or a land vessel.<eos> I take it you're not coming, then?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't you want a life of excitement?<eos> Adventure, wonder?<eos> Yeah, I really do. Um...
Do you know what it is?<eos> I've never touched gold before.<eos> Do you know what that means?<eos> It means, one day, this whole town is going to be mad with riches.<eos> You and me, Verity... we've got to be ready for it.<eos> One day, Samuel, you're going to be governor here, master of all Virginia.<eos> I know it and I love you.<eos> Not many people could see the kindness in my brother.<eos> He wouldn't let them.<eos> I did.
I trust you will do your duty.<eos> There isn't a more beautiful woman in this whole colony.<eos> This whole country.<eos> I swear it.<eos> There in't a more fair skin, comely eyes, shining hair.<eos> There isn't a more true soul...<eos> Mercy...<eos> Forgive me.<eos> Please.<eos> I do, Ma'am.

You mind?<eos> We know the killer had large feet.<eos> Maybe we can cross you off the list of suspects.<eos> Why not?<eos> So you were moving product?<eos> To raise money for a business venture.<eos> One that hit big, I might add.<eos> I found that deal, by the way.<eos> I almost got rich.<eos> But you didn't.
Now I can't fall asleep... 'cause I lie here... waiting for the squeak.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> I never got to sleep next to her.<eos> That's the thing.<eos> I'm not sad. I'm angry.<eos> I hate everyone.<eos> Anyone... laughing or smiling or... being alive is fucking offensive to me and they should all just fucking die.<eos> And eventually, I'm just gonna burn up from rage and then I'll just be dust.<eos> And I don't know how to make it stop.<eos> I do.
She's all fun and loopy, until she stab you in the thigh with your eighth grade karate trophy.<eos> - Get the...<eos> - Oh, fuck that!<eos> Come... Oh, please.<eos> Tie her to the bunk.<eos> - Vamo. - Stop that!<eos> Please!<eos> Help! Help!<eos> No.<eos> Don't.
I need to make a run.<eos> All supply runs go through me, and shouldn't you be working on the patch to Sector 5?<eos> A patch for a ship that can only save a hundred people?<eos> Why are you surprised?<eos> I am an engineer.<eos> We have no way to generate water.<eos> The harder number is 400.<eos> Can you really sentence 400 more of our own people to death?<eos> We don't have a choice.<eos> What if you do?
You've ruined me.<eos> Well, not completely.<eos> I still have my health.<eos> So, how much will it cost if my daughter applies in ten years?<eos> $2,000.<eos> That's not so bad.<eos> - That's the application fee.<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> Lisa, do you see the rings of Saturn?<eos> I do.
A million dollars in chains and earrings?<eos> I mean, that would take so many pawnshops.<eos> We might as well rob a bank.<eos> Well, we are Magicians.<eos> Why don't we just rob a bank?<eos> So there's really no way to just... take it all back?<eos> Your Majesty, one cannot simply take back<eos> - a declaration of war.<eos> - Good.<eos> Because I don't.
If you screw up the combination or you take longer than ten minutes, you're fucked.<eos> Now, basic bitches trip all the standard alarm systems, but Magicians?<eos> We also trip the magic wards, which means... battle Magicians.<eos> Full-time security employees on the DL, with benefits.<eos> You see one, run.<eos> They only ask questions post-mortem.<eos> But our ace is you.<eos> Once we nab prints and drop the wards, you travel straight in.<eos> You really don't think a bank vault, of all places, has anti-traveler protection?<eos> Oh, they do.
I'm gonna take care of you and the kid.<eos> I will untangle this war shit somehow.<eos> I know the high king has the power, but I will hunt ember to the ends of the world to have that stupid rule rewritten.<eos> Everything El promised, I'm gonna deliver.<eos> You hear me?<eos> - Yes. - Listen to high king Bambi.<eos> - You're alive.<eos> - Nice of you to join us, asshole.<eos> - Really does sound like you got it all handled.<eos> - I do.
You buried three wives.<eos> Pay attention to us a little, please.<eos> What?<eos> I don't understand what you're saying.<eos> You are looking for trouble again.<eos> Yes, we are asking for it, but we are not getting it.<eos> Who is the "bandit"?<eos> -Girls, watch your tongue.<eos> -What do you mean by that, Dilbeste?<eos> You did all kinds of things.
"Pasha"?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> Are you really crazy?<eos> You will not call me "pasha" once we get there.<eos> -Okay, pasha.<eos> -Okay, pasha.<eos> -What did I just say?<eos> -What did you say, pasha?<eos> Did I not say "don't call me pasha"?<eos> -Yes, you did.

Gulbahar, don't be upset.<eos> We'll find a solution.<eos> Did you fall in love?<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Look at me.<eos> When are we going to marry these lovely women?<eos> What are you doing, bro?<eos> Why are you so upset?<eos> By the command of God, the tradition of the Prophet, the opinion of the imam of our sect, and in front of our pasha and the witnesses, do you accept to marry these ministers?<eos> Yes, we do.

Oh, my Feride, you are the most beautiful woman I have ever seen.<eos> I would die for you, my Feride.<eos> -Thank you, my prince.<eos> What are we going to do now?<eos> Do you know how to tumble?<eos> -Tumble?<eos> -Yes, tumble.<eos> Do you know the grip on the bridge?<eos> Grip?<eos> I don't.
-Tumble?<eos> -Yes, tumble.<eos> Do you know the grip on the bridge?<eos> Grip?<eos> I don't.<eos> Do you know the handle on the boiler?<eos> No.<eos> Do you know the wardrobe?<eos> Wardrobe?<eos> I don't.
Girls, look at me.<eos> Let's give Nurdane a bath.<eos> And prepare her for the magistrate.<eos> Oh!<eos> He'll like me anyway.<eos> But you can still give me a bath.<eos> It's important to look beautiful.<eos> Let's do it.<eos> Mister magistrate, do you accept to marry Nurdane?<eos> -Yes, I do.

But I promise you this:<eos> if marriage is like playing the lottery... I'm in it to win it.<eos> Oh, Rob.<eos> I know the man that you are.<eos> And all I need you to be is right here, right now.<eos> Always.<eos> Megan, will you have this man to be your husband, to love and to comfort, to honor and to keep in sickness and in health for as long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.<eos> And do you, Robert?<eos> Yes, I do.
That chip on you?<eos> Wireless sim-jack.<eos> Linked us all into the gameplay.<eos> - Nice tech. We're a little low on agents right now.<eos> We can't risk losing newbies in the field before they're proven ready.<eos> - So I won, right?<eos> We put you through three tests.<eos> You failed.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> No, I didn't.
But I need someone to talk to to make sure I stay awake.<eos> Well, then, go see the Android.<eos> Unlike me, she doesn't need to sleep.<eos> - She's in her charging station.<eos> - Then go bother someone else.<eos> I cannot bug anyone who could knock me unconscious.<eos> So that leaves you.<eos> - You forgot Five.<eos> - Nope.<eos> I didn't.
That and the tank should keep you alive long enough for them to get here.<eos> What about you?<eos> Counting on my nanites.<eos> We know for a fact that I can last at least 30 minutes without oxygen.<eos> And what happens after that?<eos> You're still flesh and blood.<eos> You can't last forever without oxygen.<eos> I don't need forever.<eos> You don't get to make this call.<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
The enemy has launched a surprise attack...<eos> You killed Nyx.<eos> After I ordered you to use non-lethal force.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she was a distraction.<eos> Your feelings for her were a weakness.<eos> The people on that ship were your friends, your family even, for a time.<eos> I understand that.<eos> But none of them can possibly grasp what you must do now to save the House of Ishida.<eos> Not like I do.
If not, then you're a dead man.<eos> This isn't you, Amber.<eos> - You've been brainwashed. - Adrian...<eos> - There's a name for it.<eos> - It's, like, Oslo syndrome,<eos> - or something like that.<eos> - Just stop it.<eos> Did you really think you had a shot with me?<eos> I didn't... I...<eos> Of course you did.

It's wasted on this rather simplistic design, though.<eos> Wouldn't you agree?<eos> I can sense your presence is something far beyond a simple program.<eos> You're complex.<eos> I'm hoping we can talk.<eos> I can leave, but you know I'll be back.<eos> Now that we know you're here, we will find you...<eos> Eventually.<eos> I know you.<eos> Yes, you do.
I will.<eos> Okay, where to?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - Where are we dropping you off?<eos> Actually, we were kinda hoping maybe we could stay with you guys for awhile.<eos> You wanna stay here on our ship?<eos> It's... it's not like we wouldn't pull our weight.<eos> Solara's pretty handy.<eos> And obviously, you know what I bring to the table.<eos> We do?
Anything.<eos> Find my wife.<eos> Tell her I never stopped loving her.<eos> You tell Lara herself when you see her again.<eos> Wait a sec.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How'd you know her name?<eos> You told us.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.
You're psychotic.<eos> Just a mass murderer.<eos> Enjoy your stay.<eos> - May I enter?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Teku.<eos> You know me?<eos> Yes, in a way.<eos> - You have his memories.<eos> - I did.
I had this place.<eos> Everything that I do is in service to this place.<eos> Does your father believe that?<eos> Yeah, he understands.<eos> You know, complicated problems call for complicated solutions.<eos> Killing people's not complicated. It's simple.<eos> Do you see?<eos> You understand this world. You understand me.<eos> That's why I picked you.<eos> But I didn't...
Keeps digging up the fence posts to get to the cabbage.<eos> Could use an extra pair of hands tracking it tonight.<eos> Stay away from Madison and her family.<eos> They're my friends.<eos> They came here under my invite.<eos> They trust me.<eos> They came here not to get eaten. I wouldn't flatter yourself.<eos> Yeah, but they're staying 'cause I said I'd protect them from you.<eos> And how are you going to do that?<eos> Please don't do this.
I came out here to see what you and I could do about that.<eos> Trying to trick me, huh?<eos> Like that sebakawala who flies this ship?<eos> Calm these people down and line them up.<eos> Children first, best you can.<eos> Do it and I'll trade places with you.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I was on the last ship off Eros I didn't do enough.<eos> I had a brother on Eros.<eos> We all did.
What's really important is how much you love Barbara.<eos> But she thinks I'm a mama.<eos> Well, she also thinks that Danny Glover is the president.<eos> Dadushki! Oh, my gosh, Oleg, did you hear that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You just said it.<eos> No. No, no, no.<eos> It was Barbara.<eos> Barbara just called you Dadushki.<eos> She did?
Ciao!<eos> "Ciao"?<eos> Unless you're gonna say "mein" after that,<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> He's really cute.<eos> Oh, you think so?<eos> You were playing it pretty cool, Maroline.<eos> Ooh, oops. Oh, don't worry, you can ruin everything in here.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I do.
Oh, yeah?<eos> I got five of the macaron back from the birdcage.<eos> I'll get your Snuggie back to you by tomorrow.<eos> I'll give to Bobby in the morning when he leaves Caroline's.<eos> You said you slept at Brian's.<eos> You lying to me now?<eos> Ma...<eos> I was with Caroline last night.<eos> But I didn't see him naked.<eos> I did.
I'll stay with major.<eos> I'll make another pot of coffee.<eos> Get some rest, we need you on your game tomorrow.<eos> I'll be right down the hall if you need me.<eos> Go back to sleep.<eos> What happened?<eos> The pneumonia was gonna take you out, but we couldn't give you the cure until your combat wounds had healed a bit.<eos> What happened with Blaine?<eos> Did the memory serum work?<eos> It didn't.
Baron, we got word from Gabriel.<eos> He's ready to welcome us.<eos> Do you remember your father, Jenkins?<eos> He died when I was a boy.<eos> Well, you're lucky.<eos> At some point, all fathers disappoint their sons.<eos> And then you become a father and you realize that sons disappoint as well.<eos> I haven't seen Ryder since the night he betrayed me.<eos> I raised him to take power.<eos> And he did.
Just be honest.<eos> So, this whole post-Illumination new-world crap, it's not really my preference.<eos> But, hey, it's the world we're living in now, right?<eos> Now, does that mean I don't understand why some people might be resisting it?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> But these people, they're delusional.<eos> And, quite frankly, they're selfish.<eos> You think people trying to resist this nightmare are selfish?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
Coast Guard Station 142, Indian River.<eos> Coast Guard Station 142 calling the ship Hannah Wells.<eos> This is FBI Agent Hannah Wells.<eos> Mayda...<eos> To begin, I want to thank you all for being here.<eos> As you know, in addition to tomorrow's regular schedule, the United States will be introducing an initiative that would reduce NATO's nuclear arsenal.<eos> Now, I want to be absolutely clear that this is a proposed weapons-reduction change, not a change in doctrine.<eos> And it's entirely predicated upon the Russian Federation scaling back its strategic nuclear weapons in proportional response to NATO's actions, something that the Russian president has assured me he is ready to do.<eos> What, you believe him, Cornelius?<eos> Yeah, I do.
I would've thought you'd be ready for a change in your team, considering how Goodkin used your mother's memory against you.<eos> Well, it worked, didn't it?<eos> It got me to bounce.<eos> Well, but at what cost? Hmm?<eos> How will you remember your mother now?<eos> How will you react to her when you are reunited?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Reunited.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
- Just relax!<eos> Everyone, just relax.<eos> It's not a weapon.<eos> It's a human heart.<eos> This is the man who tortured me at the black site.<eos> Enhanced interrogation.<eos> He knows.<eos> Kurt and I go way back, don't we, buddy?<eos> I thought you said you didn't know anything...<eos> I didn't, Jane.
I like the yellow, but I mean, do you know how many yellows there are?<eos> I got a job offer in Colorado.<eos> It's a promotion, with... with a raise, and, um, Conor put in for a transfer as well.<eos> I know we decided to do this baby thing together, so if you don't want me to take it, I'll...<eos> I'll stay here, I'll turn it down.<eos> Well, I mean... you really wanna move to Colorado?<eos> Well, experience in other offices would give me a shot at an executive position someday.<eos> Anyway, you said you wanted me to take a desk job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, I did.
Because he'll say no.<eos> Is this about Borden?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I just...<eos> I do understand what you're going through.<eos> You do?<eos> You know what it's like to find out that the person you've been sleeping with is a terrorist?<eos> To have someone plan these dates and give you these amazing, useless gifts, and then kill a bunch of your co-workers and your friends?<eos> To be so blinded by all of your feelings you just, you miss all the signs?<eos> I do, actually.
Thank you for...<eos> Sorry for bothering you.<eos> You're not bothering me.<eos> I'm sorry about Kat.<eos> I lied.<eos> When I told her I loved her.<eos> What?<eos> I just told her what she wanted to hear so she wouldn't kill us.<eos> I didn't feel anything.<eos> Maybe I never did.
Oh, my God.<eos> This is so good.<eos> Right?<eos> Pork is amazing.<eos> It's just like chicken but juicier.<eos> Thanks for convincing me not to fast today.<eos> All right, so be honest.<eos> How religious are you?<eos> You really go to prayer and stuff?<eos> I do the Friday prayer here and there.
Okay. Slow down.<eos> You see these things, you're back there, all these feelings...<eos> I did it, too.<eos> - How do I get out of here?<eos> - David, it's all right.<eos> No.<eos> How do I get... I just want to...<eos> Sleep.<eos> And we both know who that angry boy was.<eos> - We do?
Haller.<eos> My God.<eos> The sister.<eos> Who are you?<eos> My name is Kissinger.<eos> I was...<eos> David's doctor. I...<eos> I went to the hospital to look for you.<eos> They said you didn't exist.<eos> I do.
Where the hell are you?<eos> Hospital dispatch.<eos> Hey, we're getting slammed down here in the ER.<eos> Could you send down Dr. Cassandra Railly, please?<eos> All right, I'll page her now.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Dr. Cassandra Railly to the ER.<eos> Dr. Railly to the ER.<eos> I thought you didn't want to see me.<eos> I don't.
Let me try.<eos> Anna, do you let Wally play with big, sharp chef knives?<eos> Rarely.<eos> Nice. You're getting it.<eos> You, go get washed up.<eos> You went to the semolina lady?<eos> Got some creste Di Gallo.<eos> And the last bottle of that olive oil you like.<eos> The sun-dried tomato crack?<eos> Well done, you.
Yeah, it was worse than terrifying.<eos> It was... embarrassing.<eos> There I was on the record, testifying to what horrible taste I have in women, my, uh, habit of falling for people who aren't what they appear to be, what I make them out to be.<eos> What happened with Elise was kind of soul crushing.<eos> To find out that the person that you love... ♪ say we were abducted... ♪ ...the person that you can see yourself marrying and having a family with and-- and growing old with, to find out that...<eos> Someone whose allegiances you can't trust.<eos> I can't be with a person like that.<eos> ♪ vanishing act ♪<eos> I thought Panabaker told Cooper you'd never be reinstated.<eos> She did, why?
I definitely didn't picture him, like, happy without me.<eos> He talked a lot, didn't say anything about me.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Talked about Mom's laugh, his stupid tuxedo, coffee.<eos> I felt really stupid.<eos> You're not.<eos> Never occurred to me, all that time, that he didn't even...<eos> He really didn't even miss me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Oh, I do now.
There are two tasks, right?<eos> Observe and analyze.<eos> I bet it would be really hard to make a thoughtful observation if you... say... couldn't hear.<eos> So...<eos> What do you know about Phase Two?<eos> I'm so sorry about all of this.<eos> Roman, I understand that you're angry.<eos> But I need your help.<eos> A friend of mine is missing, and you may know where she is.<eos> No, I don't.
Everything.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> I'm answering you.<eos> We know everything!<eos> Have you ever seen her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't think so, uh...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you recognize this man?<eos> Yes, I do.
I know you.<eos> You... you made me breakfast in bed, and... and...<eos> You didn't need to do that.<eos> You wanted to.<eos> I think that you care about me.<eos> That's why you couldn't kill me before and why you can't do it now.<eos> Stop talking!<eos> Do this... and you will become everything you hate.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes... you do.
Everybody wants privacy for themselves.<eos> Do you have any idea how many places<eos> I've been looking for you? What the hell, Alex?<eos> You can't call?<eos> You can't text?<eos> What happened?<eos> For other people, not so much.<eos> They said that the trial was canceled.<eos> You said you were taking a plea.<eos> I did.
Help me get some proximal control of the SMA.<eos> Suction!<eos> There's injury to the superior mesenteric artery.<eos> Must have nicked it with the trocar.<eos> All right, lost his pressure!<eos> Clamp, clamp, clamp, clamp!<eos> Come on!<eos> He's bleeding out faster than we can put it in!<eos> What did I do?<eos> Did I...
What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> She asked you a question.<eos> She needed an answer.<eos> I know.<eos> What kind of teacher are you?<eos> I mean, you don't just teach them what to do with their hands.<eos> You teach them what to do with this, how to live through this.<eos> I mean, you take it on yourself.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't!
And so are you.<eos> Dr. Wilson?<eos> The repair went very well.<eos> You fixed the thing you broke?<eos> I fixed the thing I broke.<eos> And that nasty esophageal tumor is in the medical waste, where it belongs.<eos> You got the damn cancer?<eos> We got the damn cancer.<eos> You got it?<eos> Well, Dr. Wilson and I did.
So, now what?<eos> We hand her over to Social Services?<eos> How will they find out who she is?<eos> Fingerprints, I imagine.<eos> - She doesn't have a record.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Maybe dental records?<eos> She doesn't have a home, you think she has a dentist? I don't know.<eos> They'll figure it out.<eos> Okay, but what if they don't?
If you say so.<eos> If you're into the guy, why not just be with him?<eos> - Because I don't want to be with him.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> Is it because of Maggie?<eos> She'll get over it.<eos> No.<eos> I don't want to be with him.<eos> Okay.<eos> You do, though.
I'm...<eos> Well, this looks like it's gonna be an uphill climb, and if you're not actually back...<eos> Owen, stop.<eos> Edwards, show me the skull fracture.<eos> I just spent the day trapped on a case with my wife and Jackson and April.<eos> - Yikes. - Yeah. So, if I may,<eos> Oh, okay. Uh, t-tonight?<eos> If the offer hasn't expired.<eos> Yeah. Well, I mean, I have a date now, but I can cancel it.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no, don't. No.
16:22... the time of her death.<eos> For when you want to put it down.<eos> I looked.<eos> - Okay, all right.<eos> I think that we should talk about what you saw with Eliza and I.<eos> Arizona... you've always had an active love life.<eos> If I worried about who you've been kissing on, it would leave me little time for anything else.<eos> Okay, you're mad, and you didn't mean that.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> No, I didn't.
Walter learns to swim or he drowns.<eos> We're on the news!<eos> An explosion at a warehouse in Simi Valley today injured four people.<eos> Several passersby were also treated for smoke inhalation.<eos> Authorities have...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I just look terrible.<eos> You have the same look Toby has every time he runs into someone he owes money to.<eos> Someone you're avoiding knows you're back in L.A.?<eos> They didn't.
Thank you.<eos> We may have to move in a month or two.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Money, Dad.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Why don't I let you two talk.<eos> - Good to see you, Amy.<eos> - You, too, Henry.<eos> We should talk.<eos> We did.
Do you know that I went to Hell for him?<eos> I even helped save his scrawny, little human, who I much prefer dead.<eos> This is getting weird.<eos> Yeah. It's been two weeks and no word.<eos> I mean, a mother has needs, don't you agree?<eos> I got to go.<eos> You're a terrible kisser.<eos> Must suck to be on the outs with Lucifer.<eos> He hates it when people manipulate him.<eos> I didn't.
life.<eos> Healing. Gave him the power and knowledge of the divine.<eos> And when he found out that he could heal like that, he... he thought he was God.<eos> What's more important is that now the sword's complete, we can get on with our plan.<eos> So... the...<eos> Or not.<eos> Maybe there's another piece missing.<eos> Or maybe a dragon has to breathe on it.<eos> Who knows?<eos> Well, maybe Mum does.
- It creates a scent impression that there are predators nearby.<eos> I've been dousing Nikolaj's shoes with it to scare off bullies at his preschool. - Did it work?<eos> - No, now they call him pee boy.<eos> He's much worse off.<eos> But wolf urine definitely scares off rats.<eos> We can use it to herd them toward the traps. - What about me?<eos> - Like, what should I do?<eos> - I just thought maybe you could take it easy. - It's your first day and...<eos> - I'll have you know,<eos> - Stronger even. - You already did this.
If Maggie's fine, you get to eat?<eos> - Dinner with Riggs.<eos> - Ohh.<eos> You know, I was holding off because I didn't know if she'd be okay, but I think she's fine, so I think it's fine if I go to dinner.<eos> Mm. With Riggs.<eos> When did you become a grumpy old man who doesn't like people?<eos> I like people.<eos> I don't like Riggs.<eos> If you want to go to dinner with the guy, go to dinner.<eos> If you don't, don't.
I would like to remind you that I am allergic to Cross.<eos> I'd like an MRI next.<eos> Do you have any idea how expensive that scan is?<eos> I have Obamacare, I have a year left, and I'm us...<eos> Look, an MRI wouldn't hurt.<eos> It would hurt me, because there's zero indication he needs one.<eos> Smoking-related mesenteric ischemia...<eos> It could be that.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> My grandmother did.
I'm so glad we found each other.<eos> Me too, dumpling.<eos> Every day.<eos> It's, like, affecting my body and soul.<eos> Does make you want to puke.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> Oh, God!<eos> It's only been a few months, but when you know, you just know.<eos> You know?<eos> I do.
Well, he was an idiot, and he almost died, so...<eos> I just meant that, you know...<eos> He's your baby's father, and I went too far.<eos> I was just mad because he and I had been talking earlier when the alarms went off...<eos> What?<eos> Jackson, he, uh... He likes you.<eos> I know him, so I know what that looks like.<eos> And, uh...<eos> He likes you. He has feelings for you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
- Do it.<eos> - No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!
- No.<eos> You heard him.<eos> He wants to die.<eos> No!<eos> Your mother's death was his mistake, but this will be yours, Daniel.<eos> You can't stop him, Alex.<eos> Do it.<eos> I know what you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't!<eos> Yes, I do!
I need a map of the base and a full rundown on what happened here.<eos> Who the hell put you in charge?<eos> I'm here to save your lives.<eos> But if you don't want me to, just raise your hand.<eos> Abby, get the man a map.<eos> All right?<eos> Some of my best friends are bluish.<eos> - Why is Velma the only one that talks? - "Velma"?<eos> My suit.<eos> The others do sometimes.
Well, we've all been trying to get a radio working and the Doctor's been... ..thinking.<eos> Don't mean to hurry you, but in 700 breaths I'll be dead.<eos> I need to think.<eos> He really doesn't like help.<eos> It's a transponder... from a ship.<eos> You ok?<eos> Bill, I've got no TARDIS, no sonic, about ten minutes of oxygen left and now I'm blind...<eos> Can you imagine how unbearable I'm going to be when I pull this off?<eos> Don't do this...<eos> - You always do this.
I'll live.<eos> I need to find my friend, um...<eos> Her name is Syd Jennings.<eos> She's a doctor like me.<eos> 5'10", level-headed, you know, smart mouth.<eos> Oh, so doctor isn't the only thing you have in common.<eos> I need to find her.<eos> We've done three rescues today and found no women.<eos> I don't know where she is, and I doubt anyone else will.<eos> He does.
Do you understand?<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Water?<eos> Water, please.<eos> He was in distress.<eos> He was gagging and bucking the vent.<eos> So you pulled out his E.T. tube?<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> I did.
Now, imagine them running full pelt into a plate glass window.<eos> (THEY SHRIEK)<eos> It turned out that not ALL of our products came with safety glass fitted as standard.<eos> It's probably, er, hard, at this point, not to picture your precious offspring lying in a pool of their own blood.<eos> But hold on to that thought, because this, Lorna, pardon my French, this DISGRACEFUL piece of shit is a well-known national company's patio door.<eos> I can't say who.<eos> WHISPERS: Everest.<eos> Christ, it makes me angry.<eos> Can't anyone ever think of the children?<eos> Well, thankfully, here at Cachet, we do.
Because without arseholes, Samantha, shit would never get done.<eos> -<eos> Sometimes when a Mum and a Dad fall out of love, it's better for everyone if they stop being husband and wife and start living in different houses.<eos> Which is why I now live in a flat Ronnie Farrell used to rent out to a dominatrix.<eos> (BUZZER)<eos> Hello.<eos> Is Mistress Trixie available?<eos> Mistress Trixie doesn't live here any more, all right.<eos> Oh, Okay.<eos> Who does then?
Oh, come on, don't leave me on meathooks.<eos> 50,000, cash.<eos> Ooh, way less than a million.<eos> - So, where did you get it?<eos> - Never you mind.<eos> I'll tell you where it's going, though, Her Majesty's Inland fucking Revenue.<eos> Wow!<eos> Are you going get to meet the Queen?<eos> Not unless she works at a tax office in Southend-on-Sea.<eos> She doesn't.
D-Do you want to break up with me?<eos> I--<eos> I'm scared.<eos> Of what?<eos> I like you.<eos> A lot.<eos> But...<eos> I've never had a boyfriend before.<eos> I don't know how to do that.<eos> Yes, you do.
You come with me.<eos> - I will explain everything.<eos> - No.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Why?<eos> It would put him in terrible danger.<eos> It is not safe for him.<eos> But I come for him.<eos> You understand?<eos> I do.
He's got 60 points on his way to the Mag Wall.<eos> He might be the first competitor to complete it!<eos> Oh, look at the glide.<eos> This is what he does.<eos> There go those magnetic footholds.<eos> He's coming around to that curved section.<eos> Ooh, will this be our first finisher?<eos> Let me tell you, he's gonna make it.<eos> He's gonna make it! He's going to make it!<eos> He does it!

Previously on "Timeless"...<eos> I know a lot about you, Emma.<eos> You faked your own death, and hid in the past.<eos> You have no idea what you're up against.<eos> I have a pretty good idea.<eos> No, you don't.
And you make it through another show.<eos> And that way you get days like today, where it all seems like it was meant to be.<eos> Happy anniversary to show business audience of over 20 years.<eos> I love you all far more deeply than the day we first met, and the fact that we all still have the free will to abandon each other at any given moment... makes it all the more compelling.<eos> I'm back, I came back!<eos> But I don't, it's my special, but I don't want to come back, but I'm coming back!<eos> No, okay, okay.<eos> No, no! No!<eos> But what if I didn't come back?<eos> But I did, I did.
I know what the technology is, Richard.<eos> I have a patent on it.<eos> What the fuck is a matter with you?<eos> So you're not gonna sign it?<eos> No, I'm not gonna sign this! Jesus!<eos> You're a fucking sadist, you know that?<eos> You're demented!<eos> I'm almost tempted to let you have a run at it just to watch you waste your fucking time.<eos> This technology did not work when Peter theorized it, and it doesn't work now.<eos> It actually does work now. - It does.
Look, I... I know you're looking for something to do, but...<eos> Who is pushing this false narrative that I am looking for something to do?<eos> "But"... what?<eos> But Laurie is my partner, and if she doesn't think you add any real value, then there's no future for you here.<eos> I gave you weed, a lot of it.<eos> You want a fleece?<eos> God, there's something beautiful about testing your first alpha.<eos> It's like watching a child take its first steps.<eos> Well, let's see if our space-saver app actually saves us any space.<eos> All right. Done.
Dinesh. Give it to me.<eos> You are not thinking clearly.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Looks like we both lose.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> How do you figure?<eos> 'Cause now I know you had some embarrassing shit to hide.<eos> I don't even need to know what it is.<eos> My phone may be in the toilet, but... but I win.<eos> No, you don't.
To us?<eos> I guess you can never really know someone until you ask them to put their money where their mouth is.<eos> You know, kind of a shitty thing to do.<eos> Kind of a shitty little dude.<eos> Anyway, well, lesson learned.<eos> Anyhoo, as soon as Erlich comes in and brings us our signed data storage contract from Keenan, we'll be all set. We'll be back in business.<eos> Huh? Go team.<eos> Let's celebrate. Let's...<eos> let's put on some music.<eos> We never do that.
Uh, I'll be moving my things back into my condo.<eos> - What about your squatter?<eos> - Oh, he's been out for months.<eos> He left to go sell cocaine at the Keystone Pipeline protests.<eos> I've just been staying in the garage out of solidarity.<eos> You can't leave.<eos> - Don't beg, Richard.<eos> - I'm not. According to the employee handbook, which you wrote, an employee cannot leave without giving two weeks' notice.<eos> You... you read the handbook?<eos> - Yeah, I did.
Breaking news. Hooli CEO Jack Barker has been taken hostage by workers at a Hooli factory in China, which produces cell phones.<eos> I want everyone to know I haven't been harmed... and the workers here have assured me that I will only be held as their honored guest until Hooli has met their very reasonable request for fair wages and for humane conditions.<eos> On a more personal note, honey...<eos> I have to stop now.<eos> Holy shit. I think we can actually make it.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Shit.<eos> We must've left the work lights on all night.<eos> Well, do we have jumper cables?<eos> - Jared did.
You've just crossed it.<eos> You could've helped me today.<eos> Yeah. You're right.<eos> I could have.<eos> You almost got me thrown out.<eos> You called him my friend.<eos> Who?<eos> Elliot.<eos> You said you were not my friend who died.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Wanted to know why I didn't stop him.<eos> Couldn't help him.<eos> But whatever I said, it didn't matter because he realized then that he couldn't have them and me.<eos> He had trapped himself in.<eos> There was no way out.<eos> And before I knew what he was doing, he grabbed a knife from the kitchen counter and ran himself through with it.<eos> Well, not once, not twice.<eos> Three times.<eos> I tried to save him.<eos> I did.
People who've given their lives in service to this country, true patriots, picked off like roaches in a kitchen.<eos> No one needed to die, and you are not a patriot.<eos> Anyone who thinks they can take the law into their own hands is nothing but a terrorist.<eos> Except when it's you, right, Alex?<eos> You can go rogue whenever you feel like it.<eos> The only difference between you and us is we're organized, and we're not letting Will Olsen out of here alive, not while he knows how to find us.<eos> So you can give up Will or you can watch your good friend Harry die.<eos> Carly!<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Harry didn't do anything wrong.

What?<eos> Dude, there's something on your...<eos> - Wait, no, no, wait, wait...<eos> - Is it... where... it's in my hair?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I got it.<eos> My God. My God!<eos> Shh!<eos> - How?<eos> - How did you...
Shall we?<eos> I don't know about you, but I could use a drink.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Never better.<eos> Sebastian?<eos> You all right?<eos> Yeah. Pulse is normal, I'm breathing regular.<eos> There's not a thing wrong with me.<eos> Why do you look like someone just died?<eos> Because Tammy almost did.
I'll let you know if we need anything.<eos> Try not to yak.<eos> It's a first-time murder scene thing.<eos> Okay. So you discovered josh's body.<eos> When you got home? Yeah.<eos> I just got the new.<eos> Total combat, was psyched to play it, And then I found him, You know,<eos> Out of lives. Okay, um, he was meeting someone from the internet?<eos> Do you know who?<eos> Sorry, I don't.
But I'm not pointing the finger at you.<eos> It's just this kind of thing never happened. Before Gideon took on this new hobby.<eos> This has nothing to do with him working with us.<eos> And policing is not a hobby.<eos> Trust me, The law enforcement division. Will end up on the Reeves Industry.<eos> And you'll still be around?<eos> I'm the money.<eos> He may be a billionaire, But it takes billions more to build his empire.<eos> Gideon's interests will come and go, But he needs me to pay for his dreams.<eos> We done yet?
I do not know you.<eos> Where will I find the man Uhtred?<eos> Lord Uhtred will be that way, with the king's guard, and the king, and half the townsfolk starved of interest.<eos> Clapa's a bear.<eos> A big, angry bear.<eos> Should we call a halt? Not at all.<eos> With a little luck, a blow will land.<eos> All he's doing is showing off his feathers.<eos> I believe the lady feels the same.<eos> They usually do.
Where?<eos> A field, a barn?<eos> In the chapel, Lord.<eos> Keep watch.<eos> Should his cock wander and her virginity decide to join it.<eos> Yes, Lord.<eos> Louder. Why?<eos> Why not put all of my effort into...<eos> Now do you see, Lady?<eos> I do. Yes.
No-one is to move!<eos> Kill him now!<eos> I say no-one is to move!<eos> And no-one is to speak but me!<eos> No-one!<eos> What is your name?<eos> I'm called Sihtric, Lord.<eos> Please, I'm not loyal to Kjartan and never can be.<eos> You swear your sword is mine?<eos> On Thor's hammer, I do, Lord.
You decided to rule alone.<eos> You chose me!<eos> You kissed me by the fountain. It was you and only you!<eos> Enough!<eos> Enough!<eos> I cannot remember the last time that I truly slept.<eos> Take some herbs, Your Highness.<eos> It will help.<eos> If you say they will help.<eos> I do, with all my heart.
That's all you do?<eos> Couldn't they just write it on the screen?<eos> They do, but I say it in a really enthusiastic way.<eos> - Okay, wait.<eos> - It's very important.<eos> I want to hear that.<eos> Right now?<eos> Yes, right now.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do it. - No way.
I think they know we're here.<eos> It's not a very good hiding place.<eos> I think so, too.<eos> Hold on. Let's see if they're coming.<eos> Okay, they're not.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I think I won the game.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I did.
I am racing! I'm just really, really bad!<eos> You're so slow!<eos> No, it's just bad, see?<eos> Are you saving your energy for the later part?<eos> Yes, I think so.<eos> I feel like you should probably start going now, though, no?<eos> I guess you won!<eos> I guess I win.<eos> I won!<eos> You did!
I achieved inner peace.<eos> I wish it were so simple.<eos> You must recognize your fear, admit your weakness and confess your sins.<eos> I do nothing else these days!<eos> Something...<eos> Something is sapping the breath from within me.<eos> You are only human and you are a good man.<eos> You are not alone.<eos> Do you agree to serve the Lord?<eos> I do.
- Dude...<eos> And so it shall be instilled in you.<eos> Let's pair off.<eos> Those not fighting, watch and learn.<eos> Nightwing.<eos> - Shall we dance, good sir?<eos> - But of course, my lady.<eos> Guess we know who's taking out the garbage at the new place.<eos> That was not a confidence booster.<eos> You did very well.
I was just telling him to relax.<eos> And yes, Trish, dinner sounds lovely.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Perfect.<eos> See?<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> You're just dumb, you know that?<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Nope. Not for me.<eos> Don't.<eos> What?<eos> The little shrinky smile thing that you do;<eos> Don't do it.<eos> I wasn't aware I did it.<eos> Well, you do, and it's annoying, and judgey, to be honest.<eos> You know? Like you know something I don't.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you?
This is just fun.<eos> You know, sometimes I look at you, and I feel like you've maybe never had a carefree day in your whole life.<eos> You gotta learn how to relax.<eos> Hey, not bad for a first-timer.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I still can't believe you have never played. Skee-ball before, how is that even possible?<eos> I know we said the past is just the past, but this is much more mysterious than your tattoos.<eos> Well, let's just say I had a very unusual childhood.<eos> So, what will this get us?<eos> How does a brand-new
Planet Earth does not consent to your help, your presence, or your conquest.<eos> Thank you for playing the big pyramid game bye-bye, see you again next week, hopefully not.<eos> Without our help, Planet Earth is doomed.<eos> Yes, well, it's been doomed before.<eos> Guess what happened?<eos> Me!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I just need a minute.<eos> I was about to throw up in my suit.<eos> I did that once.
Pets?<eos> Snacks?<eos> Oh, someone's watching!<eos> Well, that's quite a good beat, really, isn't it?<eos> Maybe we should be moving on.<eos> Yeah, and he calls us friends.<eos> Doctor!<eos> Think of the age gap!<eos> Stop mucking about and concentrate.<eos> Nardole, do something non-irritating.
Kill...<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> This way, Mr Razor, look sharp!<eos> Would you like some tea?<eos> This way, this way.<eos> What about him?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> They don't feel pain.<eos> - I think they do.<eos> Yes, they do.
Two days for you, generations for them.<eos> - What are these...<eos> - Look.<eos> What?<eos> What kind of treatment is that?<eos> Why won't you ever explain?<eos> I do explain.<eos> They are the special patients.<eos> When do those bag things come off their heads?<eos> They don't.
Is the question too difficult?<eos> I'll rephrase.<eos> Will the richest and most powerful men in New York give the time of day to a gang of kids who haven't got a nickel to their name?<eos> Hey!<eos> You don't gotta be insulting'.<eos> I got a nickel.<eos> So, I guess you'd say you're a couple of Davids looking to take on Goliath.<eos> -We never said that.<eos> -Well, you didn't have to.<eos> I did.
Yes.<eos> She is helping the ones who are behind in their studies.<eos> The regional exams are in a few days.<eos> Forgive me for stating the obvious, Mr. Stoneman, but isn't that your job?<eos> It is, but I see no harm in Miss...<eos> Elizabeth Thatcher is trying to cause trouble for the railroad.<eos> I don't want to see her near those children again.<eos> You find a way to teach them so they don't need her, or I'll find someone who can.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Yes, sir, we do.
Torres." They kept chanting my name.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I got that part.<eos> That day I... I faced a monster, McGee, and I managed to come out on top.<eos> Why would they name a bull Robert?<eos> What does matter is that I had to face that very same bull two weeks later.<eos> And he was pissed off, man.<eos> And... this time he knew my weakness.<eos> And he tossed me, like, 20 feet.<eos> How did you learn to bull-ride?<eos> I didn't.
I feel so guilty about this.<eos> I was wondering what happened to that.<eos> Well, it was when you were missing.<eos> Bishop and I came here to look for you, and I... I don't know what happened. I...<eos> It was an accident-- I just broke the dish in half.<eos> But it's fixed.<eos> You could've just snuck it back in here.<eos> That's not my style.<eos> Don't beat yourself up over that.<eos> I do, I do.
Did you even take the class?<eos> Please. I taught the class.<eos> Oh, right. Yeah.<eos> No, he actually got up in front of the room.<eos> The instructor lost her voice and asked for volunteers.<eos> Was she hot?<eos> Case closed.<eos> All right, we are almost done with these in-service training reports.<eos> Almost?<eos> Uh, we just did six classes in three days.
Yeah, go home and sleep it off, Avery.<eos> Tomorrow wake up and go to work.<eos> That's all any of us can do in this city.<eos> You were okay with him killing that ranger?<eos> No.<eos> But it's not like he asked.<eos> You know, he's got a thing for frontier justice.<eos> But Veld takes the fall for this and...<eos> He's right.<eos> I do.
You didn't talk very much.<eos> How do you live with yourself after what you did to your son?<eos> I've done things that I have to live with somehow.<eos> Okay. I try to do things, little things, anything, to show myself that the person who made those mistakes isn't who I really am.<eos> Like with your niece.<eos> Where would she be without you?<eos> Lena barely knows me.<eos> I was in prison half her life.<eos> You can tell me anything.<eos> Just next time, you do it at the beginning of our date.
I thought she was going to buy something...<eos> That's okay. I'm just glad she decided to come in.<eos> Hey! Can I help you find something?<eos> Thanks. We are going to the Tinsdales for dinner; I wanted to take them something.<eos> Maybe some flowers, or a plant?<eos> Why don't you take them chocolates?<eos> Oh, do you have the same kind you were selling before?<eos> Basically the same, yeah.<eos> I think that guy wanted to talk to you.<eos> Yeah, everybody does.
But I am hoping that that is what we will have at the end of the meeting today is,<eos> "Okay, we know what to do now.<eos> Yes, there's gonna be some work, oh, yes, it's gonna take a little time.<eos> But this is what now can be done and how we can proceed."<eos> - Right.<eos> - That's what I'm hoping for.<eos> We're gonna go meet the lawyers in an hour.<eos> I think we should go light a candle across the street.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - I do.
Cassie's been great.<eos> That makes a big difference.<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> Don't, Spencer, don't.<eos> You were trying to help your mother.<eos> I fell right into Scratch's trap.<eos> He won't win.<eos> He already has.<eos> Just the battle, not the war.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
To stop Shepherd from destroying our country.<eos> The same country that tried to cover up my father's death?<eos> What, you think I was doing this for America?<eos> I only defected because Shepherd became what she was fighting against.<eos> Well, then stay for revenge.<eos> For what she did to you, what she did to Markos.<eos> You don't get it.<eos> Shepherd, her army, her plans, they can't be stopped.<eos> I thought you said you didn't know any details of Phase Two.<eos> I don't.
I came for my inheritance.<eos> Yes, sir, my apologies.<eos> Just sign here.<eos> I was...<eos> I was posing as his next of kin.<eos> Her next of kin.<eos> We don't know who the trust belonged to.<eos> We were hoping you might remember.<eos> Or perhaps you'd know what you did with the money.<eos> I don't.
Every misstep is highlighted and heightened.<eos> They wanna know what happened with their election.<eos> We're fixing it.<eos> Yeah... that's what they're afraid of.<eos> The statement's about the FBI.<eos> Everybody trusts the FBI.<eos> Hey, who's Lisa Williams?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Why? Oh, somebody from the Herald called. They were just wondering if you knew her.<eos> I don't.
We are.<eos> Well, going around me to get information will only create discord between us.<eos> I wouldn't want that, Claire.<eos> - Miss Davis.<eos> - Mr. President.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> The vice president has told me that your contacts have once again lost track of Ahmadi.<eos> Yes, as I explained, Syria is like a different country one day to the next.<eos> Yes, well, you can thank Viktor Petrov for that.<eos> Oh, I do.
And that line where they meet.<eos> The president had no idea.<eos> You were close to Mr. Macallan?<eos> Yes, but that doesn't mean that I knew what he was up to.<eos> But then how do you know the president wasn't involved?<eos> I was the last person to see Aidan. He confessed to me.<eos> He secretly used the NSA, FISA, to manipulate the electorate.<eos> We're meeting with counsel to perfect the rest of the testimony.<eos> As long as no one has anything that contradicts you.<eos> No one does.
No, no, no. It's not going to work like that.<eos> - You tell me what you can do for me.<eos> - I've been around your kind.<eos> Not usually at this level. But you can't help yourself.<eos> Make me an offer, Ms. Davis.<eos> What is she worth to you?<eos> A lot.<eos> So then here's what I'm thinking.<eos> Do you solemnly swear and affirm that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
We were discussing Raj's recent breakup and apparently, I was insensitive to him.<eos> It's okay, I'm fine.<eos> You Di-- Don't fall for it.<eos> He'll get you to compare him to a dead virgin, and suddenly you're the bad guy.<eos> Sheldon, when I said I was fine, I meant I didn't want to talk about it anymore.<eos> Then why didn't you say that?<eos> Because that's not what people do.<eos> Well, I would prefer if people told me exactly what is on their mind.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't, you really don't.
How's Benjamin?<eos> He's good. We made love this morning. With all the bells and whistles.<eos> And, Robert?<eos> He's a little under the weather.<eos> So, um, when do you head off to your little... bunkery place?<eos> We have to wait a little bit.<eos> They make you take a physical before you enter, so...<eos> Just a precaution.<eos> I didn't know you had a dog.<eos> I don't.
And then you hold it up to the light and you go,<eos> "Oh, there's light just coming through that bit that I cut!"<eos> So I like that one.<eos> I often get asked by people, "How did you start doing what you do?"<eos> I often get asked by young, like, 17-year-old people, who don't know what to do.<eos> And I always feel very empathetic towards those 17-year-old people who say, "I don't know what to do."<eos> I was no different to that, I didn't know what to do at all.<eos> But then I did a course in theater design and I found myself in this room full of people making model stuff.<eos> I thought, "This is good, these people are feral, and they stay up all night making models, I feel quite at home here."<eos> So, I did that.
What is this?<eos> Where's Hook?<eos> There's something wrong.<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Mom, it's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> We don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
And that's all?<eos> Trevor wanted to hang out after I got off of work, so I took him to a fight club.<eos> The one in Humboldt Park on Le Moyne?<eos> That's right.<eos> I thought he just wanted to watch, but once we got there, he said he wanted to fight, so they set up a match for him.<eos> He kicked some dude's ass.<eos> I wasn't planning to hook up with him, but after he took his shirt off and dominated in the ring, I was like, "Come to mama."<eos> Seriously?<eos> You should've seen him.<eos> I did.
You never served, did you?<eos> My son joined up because he felt there was a cause more important than his own life.<eos> Those ideals... He came to realize they weren't all they were cracked up to be.<eos> That's not how I see it.<eos> He was writing a book that defied his chain of command.<eos> Every soldier needs a way to let go of the weight he carries.<eos> Trevor found his way.<eos> Doesn't mean I have to agree with it.<eos> Do you even want to know what it was gonna say?<eos> I don't.
Woman:<eos> Can we go into that?<eos> You know, we'll save you a little bit for later.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I-I didn't know any of...<eos> I didn't know that that had happened to him.<eos> The harassment and the...<eos> Yeah, but I didn't know he was so...anyway.<eos> I just think what you're doing is heroic.<eos> I really do.
This case is bigger than we thought.<eos> I'm thinking deep state.<eos> Shadow government.<eos> Wait...<eos> The government's involved?<eos> Well, not the "government" government, obviously.<eos> But the people behind the government, the Illuminati.<eos> Whose brain have you eaten?<eos> Who wants to know?<eos> I do.
Who I was.<eos> You need to stay away from Scottie Hargrave.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You said that.<eos> My question is why.<eos> My question is, why not?<eos> You have a wife and a child and a life.<eos> Leave well enough alone.<eos> Told Liz I would, that it didn't matter.<eos> And it doesn't.
You should come next time.<eos> We have witnesses in the casino, in the stairwell, the next room.<eos> Listen to me, please, believe me.<eos> When I went back to the room, Corina was already dead.<eos> We have your fingerprints on her neck.<eos> - Because they put them there.<eos> - Ah.<eos> Somebody drugged me.<eos> My hands, they put my hands on her neck.<eos> "They" did?
Sorry.<eos> I'm making a tribute video.<eos> Highlights from practice tapes.<eos> - Jim, send these to me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'm so sorry, Maggie.<eos> You need God's strength.<eos> I never did believe in him.<eos> 'Til cops came to my house at 5 AM.<eos> Now I do.
Look. I don't know who you people think I am.<eos> You're Jimmy Capone, born James Vincenzo Capone.<eos> My name's Richard Hart.<eos> You left Brooklyn when you were 16 and changed your name for a fresh start, and wound up becoming a Prohibition Agent.<eos> And you haven't seen your family or your brother ever since you left.<eos> But you know what Al's been up to.<eos> You can't read the morning paper without seeing his name.<eos> Keep it down, will you?<eos> My wife and kids don't know my real name.<eos> Nobody does.
I don't know.<eos> Well, I got a pretty good idea.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's my house.<eos> - That's in Edgebrook, right? - Yeah.<eos> Damn, I can't afford to live there.<eos> - Objection.<eos> - Eh, withdrawn.<eos> My point is you got a sob story.<eos> We all do.
Unfortunately, none of that is an element of murder.<eos> Right.<eos> You don't have kids, do you?<eos> No. I remember when I could hold Diego in the palm of my hand.<eos> I'd look at him and think,<eos> "There's a surgeon, a one guard for the Bulls."<eos> I want to grab Olinsky and tell him it's gonna be okay... but it's not, never will be.<eos> The confession...<eos> I didn't actually hear it.<eos> Who did?
Forest didn't object to the document or my question to Anders.<eos> He didn't cross Anders about his sources.<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe Anders has something on him.<eos> It's a little late for Forest's book.<eos> Read the title of chapter three.<eos> "Trials: It's All A Con."<eos> And I think I'm his mark.<eos> I never thought Dylan could do something like this.<eos> But you do now?
Did you think boys were being molested<eos> - at the Kimball Warehouse?<eos> - Objection. - Beyond the scope.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Did you ever read an article about it in "The Anders Report"?<eos> - Same objection.<eos> - Sustained.<eos> Mr. Stone, you're limited to questions relating to the defendant's prior outburst.<eos> Tell me, Dylan, why did you say that your mom doesn't know anything about your life?<eos> Because she doesn't.
Okay, literally any other topic.<eos> All right. How did you guys meet?<eos> Actually, we met online.<eos> Our-our first date was at a coffee shop.<eos> Although, unlike your date, she actually showed up.<eos> Oh, he looks sad again.<eos> Well, I really envy your relationship.<eos> Other than you two only having sex once a year, you're the perfect couple.<eos> You-you know about that?<eos> Uh, yeah, everyone at the university does.
He's staying low and centered on these beds.<eos> That's how you want to do it.<eos> And as we've seen, this obstacle's been extremely difficult for competitors all night long, Terry.<eos> Now, Roberto, he wants to be the first man to conquer this obstacle.<eos> He balances the platforms trying to get closer...<eos> - That's it! - That's it.<eos> Well done, Rober! Awesome!<eos> He's got one last jump to go.<eos> Can he do it? Trying to time this jump just right.<eos> He does it! He does it!
- Garcia.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> I'm here for you, sir.<eos> Cochrane university in Ohio.<eos> What's the out-of-state tuition?<eos> Uh, yikes. $37,000 annually.<eos> That's not taking into consideration books, cost of living, ramen, beer kegs, bean bag chairs, et cetera.<eos> Joey Fletcher's family didn't have anywhere near that kind of money.<eos> How did he pay for it?<eos> He didn't.
What do you mean?<eos> Jim Fox is holding a press conference with Milken<eos> - outside of the Justice Department.<eos> - Of course he is.<eos> Can you turn it up?<eos> Well, I'm just glad that the attorney general's taken a break, finally, from wasting tax-payer money, because he had no chance, zero, of getting a conviction.<eos> That's not what DOJ said.<eos> Of course not, because when has the FBI ever acted unethically?<eos> My client got full immunity.<eos> You do the math.
Every time we tried to trace them back, it was a dead end.<eos> In that depot, what else is in that depot?<eos> Humvees, tanks, heavy munitions.<eos> Stinger missiles?<eos> Depleted uranium?<eos> We're looking for the same supplier.<eos> Elizabeth, how's Henry?<eos> He-He's recovering, sir.<eos> He tried to drag himself here from the hospital.<eos> Of course he did.
Of course I am.<eos> What, you think they'd tell you?<eos> I spoke to Charlotte Bishop.<eos> She said it happened right after The Farm.<eos> Yeah.<eos> They threw me out after I exposed their mission here.<eos> Well, now you have your answers, Alex, so I'll...<eos> Harry...<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
So, what about storage?<eos> What about providing electricity when the sun's not shining and the wind's not full blowing?<eos> Right.<eos> So, first of all, you can store solar electricity.<eos> - Let's call it concentrated solar power, where you have focused light onto a mirror.<eos> Well, many plants do. Concentrated solar plants do have storage.<eos> You store heat.<eos> You store the heat, and then whenever you need the electricity, you run the heat by water to heat the water--<eos> [Bill] A conventional steam turbine.<eos> So does a fission nuclear power plant--
- Furguson?<eos> Where have you been?<eos> - What? Hi!<eos> Huh? When you leave the house, you take your cell phone with you.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, thank you so much for grabbing my cat.<eos> Come on, Sweatshirt, there's still some sashimi left between my toes.<eos> Uh, this here is, uh, Winston's cat, Furguson.<eos> Sweatshirt walked through my door a year ago, and while he may come and go as he pleases, he loves Mommy and her little milkies.<eos> Yes, he does.
Heading out, unless you need something?<eos> You once asked me why I still use this Rolodex.<eos> I like to see the sheer tonnage of people that owe me favors.<eos> I don't remember the last time that I was Henry.<eos> I'm Mr. Speaker, and people come into this office to get something.<eos> Doesn't matter if they're a rival or an ally or an old friend from boarding school.<eos> I didn't know Clay would do that.<eos> Well, if you didn't, you should have.<eos> And if you want to keep your job, you'll find out what he's up to and you'll make it up to me.<eos> And if you don't,
Well, if you haven't noticed, I've been between them for the last ten years.<eos> Hey, babe, you want to drive? Sure, or you can.<eos> No, it's fine, I know you don't like the way I drive.<eos> I don't have a problem with your driving.<eos> Are you listening to this?<eos> They deceive each other about everything.<eos> Just so you know, that guy in the parking lot hit me.<eos> He wasn't in a car, but okay.<eos> Just say you want to drive.<eos> I honestly don't.
How's your experiment?<eos> Well...<eos> The mud has improved the elasticity.<eos> But the cream has conferred suppleness.<eos> It's a tough call.<eos> Only one thing left to do.<eos> Keep testing.<eos> Dr. Curtis and Ms. Quinn, thank you for considering Harbor Oaks as a wedding venue.<eos> We hope that you enjoyed your complimentary spa session.<eos> We most certainly did.
Right, the point.<eos> This is what is left of your meteor.<eos> - Asteroid.<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Now?<eos> I am a germophobe; I would never put my hand in something if it was contaminated.<eos> We rendered a deadly space rock safe.<eos> We have that technology.<eos> We know how to do it.<eos> You don't.
Germany!<eos> Now, Adrien quit after getting just 60 points in Level 1.<eos> He said he wanted to save some energy for Level 2.<eos> Let's see if it pays off.<eos> - He's got it!<eos> - Good for him. - He's got it, oh, man.<eos> - Nice job.<eos> Adrien Ngouah-Ngally has to jump on that last platform, and he gets another 20 points.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - He does it.
The course ticks me off when it gets the best of me!<eos> Adrian Raya of Mexico is now on the bubble, and Yunhwan Kim of South Korea has been eliminated.<eos> But we do have some good news.<eos> His younger brother, Yungyung Kim, has been cleared to go and will now be the sole competitor left to represent his family, as well as his country.<eos> Kim Yungyung! Kim Yungyung!<eos> Yungyung Kim comes into Level 2 with 60 points, and he'll need more than 100 to move on to Level 3.<eos> If he doesn't, Adrian Raya of Mexico will be moving on.<eos> Oh! He slams into the second platform.<eos> I mean, he hit that thing really hard.<eos> - Yeah, he does it.
So he took away my voting rights.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I'm Latina. I don't vote.<eos> We don't vote! We don't vote!<eos> Not unless it's American Idol or The Voice, right?<eos> We don't do it!<eos> We don't do it.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> I love to vote.<eos> I do it, like, five, six times in an election.
And if he's a trafficker, then there are other girls, too.<eos> Okay.<eos> But I think it would be better if Officer Kalakaua went in alone.<eos> Yes, of course,<eos> I understand.<eos> Kelsey?<eos> I'd like to ask you a few questions.<eos> If that's okay with you.<eos> I know how hard this must be.<eos> No, you don't.

- Do you think we can trust Ivy?<eos> I'm not a hundred percent sure.<eos> I know what quantum computers are and how entanglement triggers work.<eos> He had surgery a couple days ago, and since we're locked down, I have no idea how he's doing.<eos> Call.<eos> Find out.<eos> He died.<eos> The funeral was yesterday.<eos> - You know where she is.<eos> - I do.
Just a lot of unsettlingly green artificial grass.<eos> Hm.<eos> Well, I couldn't find anything inside.<eos> If Sabine hid something here, she made sure Nic couldn't find it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Mm.<eos> Okay, hold on.<eos> You don't want to?<eos> No, I... I do.<eos> I do, 100%.
Maybe you could figure out what's missing.<eos> Am I the only one keeping an eye out for the lost Ark of the Covenant?<eos> Nah, that's in a warehouse in Yemen.<eos> I was joking.<eos> So was I.<eos> Crate 10997... Last earthly possessions of Milton Barker.<eos> Or at least the last earthly possessions that weren't stolen by Travis Unger.<eos> Says here Mr. Barker was an insurance adjustor, died of a stroke, age 86, no known heirs.<eos> So, how do you open this?<eos> I don't.
Soon.<eos> See, I could've said<eos> "in the near future," but I didn't say "in the near future," 'cause "in the near future" is three more words than "soon."<eos> "In" one, "the" two, "near" three, "future" four.<eos> See "in the near future" is four, "soon" is just one, four is more than one;<eos> saving time already.<eos> Genius.<eos> I was gonna say,<eos> "Why does anyone think Sheldon's a genius?"<eos> But I didn't.
- What the hell difference does it make?<eos> Well if it's a hammerhead, you just tickle it between the sideways eyes and you have a companion for life.<eos> Then you got tiger sharks, you got whale sharks, you got trumpet sharks, which I believe are a thing... if not, it definitely should be.<eos> It's just a regular shark.<eos> You know what?<eos> Good-bye. Okay, vague premise aside, I don't know what I would do, but if Jess was with me,<eos> I'm sure... I'm sure we'd be okay.<eos> She's got that giant heart that's, that's part compass and, and part flashlight and... she's just the greatest person I have ever met.<eos> Bob? Does that answer your question or what?<eos> It does.

You loved him so much, you pulled him in as your lookout, right?<eos> Some friend.<eos> Look, Derrick was a grown man. He did what he did on his own.<eos> You knew the cops were coming to talk to him.<eos> And you knew Derrick didn't have the stomach for that.<eos> He was gonna give all of you up.<eos> So you shut him up.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> No, I didn't do that.<eos> Then who did?
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Four horses?<eos> He pushes me off a cliff, and you get four horses?<eos> Four horses is a lot.<eos> - I could have died.<eos> - But you didn't.
No.<eos> See, um, you're gonna come clean.<eos> I'm gonna stay dirty.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Aly,<eos> I found a roly-poly in these pants, they gave me 89% off.<eos> Oh. That's sweet. Um...<eos> Charmaine, I have to tell you something.<eos> I don't work in radio.<eos> I don't.
No, not... no.<eos> Not just this. All of it.<eos> All the girlfriend stuff.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> All right. Sorry.<eos> I-I didn't know you felt that way.<eos> No.<eos> I don't feel that way, I...<eos> - But you said unfair.<eos> - Yeah, I did.
How do you get off a plane and still look dewy as hell?<eos> Uh, I made a deal with the devil some time ago.<eos> - Hey, I'm the blue words.<eos> - Too late.<eos> We're going with it.<eos> Well, welcome back!<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't know why I'm still shouting.<eos> Um, so Nick told me about what's been going on with you two.<eos> Oh, he did?
25 points of entry is too many points of entry!<eos> Wait, wait, don't tell me.<eos> Agent Isosceles, part geometry prodigy, part CIA spy, all scared of girls.<eos> - Wrong.<eos> Cadet Isosceles.<eos> - Oh.<eos> It's all right. You know, it's just, technically, this is just for myself...<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you remember when you had to smuggle the golden sextant out of the Paris Math Academy?<eos> - I do.
Hey, hey, sit down.<eos> They're gonna beat you again.<eos> Might even kill you.<eos> You'll never see it coming.<eos> You'll never see it coming.<eos> I can get you anywhere.<eos> I own this place.<eos> We're taking you home.<eos> You don't know who you're messing with, Alvez.<eos> Yes, I do.
So I said to him, and I quote--<eos> I said, "Yes.<eos> No.<eos> Wait. What does 'suspended' mean?"<eos> And he said, "Please step out of the car." And I get out of the car. He says, "You're under arrest."<eos> I said, "No, I don't think so."<eos> He says, "I'm sure of it."<eos> And then he cuffs me to prove the whole thing. And--<eos> Round of applause if you've been arrested. Has anyone been arrested before?<eos> Few people. What did you--
Because I'll tell you if you really want to know.<eos> No, just, uh, take the license plate that says "Kyle" off the back.<eos> Have fun with your helmet tomorrow, Kyle.<eos> What are you doin' up so early?<eos> I was feedin' cattle while you were sleepin' in.<eos> - You did that on Christmas mornin'?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, the cows don't know it's Christmas.<eos> Sounds like somethin' I'd say.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Well, she is beautiful.<eos> She's all right.<eos> No, don't tell me that you compromised yourself for someone who's just "all right."<eos> - She's beautiful. - Mmhmm.<eos> But that's not why I did it.<eos> I did it to save everyone else.<eos> Well, you exposed yourself, and now, you should leave the team.<eos> Yeah, I should.<eos> Yet I don't want you to.<eos> You don't?
Harry, what happened?<eos> I'm starting to get worried about you.<eos> Well, don't.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> After what happened today, Alex, I-I can't.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - I don't want to die for this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I thought you might want to be a part of something... with me.<eos> Yeah. So did I.
Oh, no.<eos> - Oh, boy.<eos> - Oh, crap.<eos> Hey, Walt, uh, look, it's not Princess and the Pea quality, but it should stop you from breaking most of your bones.<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I just want to know from Paige, why did you tell me you loved me?<eos> Mom.<eos> Did you really say that to Walter?<eos> Um... honey, I don't recall.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'll teach you whatever you want to know.<eos> What is it you want to know?<eos> So, how is Hawaii Boy?<eos> He's great.<eos> And his name is Kalei.<eos> Well, tell him Ka-hey for me.<eos> Will do.<eos> You still have a thing for her, huh?<eos> Who says I have a thing for her?<eos> Who doesn't?
Barely had time to do my own research.<eos> Oh, are you kidding?<eos> You were looking for an excuse not to work.<eos> You said you had to "let your research breathe."<eos> Here.<eos> Last one's for you.<eos> Ready to get your life back?<eos> Kind of crazy to be working with you again.<eos> It's kind of like I never left.<eos> Yeah, but you did.
Maybe that's when they grabbed him.<eos> You don't know, and you can't blame yourself for that, Danny.<eos> Come on.<eos> You're a good cop.<eos> I'm a good cop?<eos> Now I'm a good cop?<eos> You didn't want me around in the first place.<eos> I'm a good cop.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
See?<eos> We're not so different.<eos> We both sacrifice for what we believe is right, Kurt.<eos> That's why I wanted you for our new government.<eos> You're dedicated, you're honorable.<eos> I knew that no matter how much you'd hate me for what I'd done, you'd do the right thing for your country.<eos> You can't be corrupted Kurt.<eos> Stop calling me Kurt!<eos> You don't know me.<eos> Yes, I do.
Until I met you.<eos> And I knew then, just like<eos> I know how to assemble engines, that you and me, Toby... we fit.<eos> You're my home.<eos> Okay, Padre.<eos> Get it together, you're up.<eos> Thank you, Ralph.<eos> Do you, Tobias Merriweather Curtis, take Happy Quinn to be your lawfully wedded wife?<eos> You bet I do.<eos> And do you, Happy Quinn...
All right, let's chat.<eos> I agreed to take the reigns and fix what your team broke.<eos> I did not agree to allow you to go rogue along with Pride.<eos> No. You're 100% right;<eos> we should not go rogue.<eos> But you need to get our badges back.<eos> Your own Deputy Director suspended you.<eos> How am I supposed to change that?<eos> 'Cause you got pull.<eos> Yes. I do.
Do you know how many intelligence agencies would be rolling out the carpet to us?<eos> But we came to you, so we deserve respect and answers now.<eos> - Don't give them that drive.<eos> - Let's take a look first.<eos> I want a deal first.<eos> This is not a negotiation.<eos> We're still establishing the connection.<eos> You have a deal.<eos> How do I know you'll keep your part of the deal?<eos> You don't.
NCIS.<eos> I need to speak with the--<eos> Congresswoman.<eos> Special Agent Pride, NCIS.<eos> Sorry to bother you, but it's important.<eos> What's this about?<eos> It's about the shipyard and Mayor Hamilton.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Why does NCIS know about the shipyard?<eos> NCIS doesn't, I do.
The first is one little island.<eos> It's the first place that's actually the place that it's the year.<eos> It's a little island in the Pacific.<eos> I forget.<eos> They do a little ceremony for New Year's Eve every year.<eos> And they just wear grass.<eos> 'Cause they don't even have sticks yet.<eos> They're in the grass age.<eos> They have no clocks.<eos> But they do a dance.
Fuck off!<eos> It was like she knew.<eos> - Knew what?<eos> - What Ferguson did to me.<eos> - How'd she get out?<eos> - You tell me!<eos> - Vera? - She let Smith out to get to me.<eos> I'm lifting your suspension.<eos> - That's if you want to come back.<eos> - Yes, I do.
No, none of that.<eos> How long have you been at Wentworth now?<eos> About six years.<eos> You must really believe in what you do to be here that long.<eos> Well, you have to, don't you?<eos> But sometimes you fail people.<eos> Anyone in particular?<eos> Bea Smith?<eos> Yeah, I failed her.<eos> We all did, all of us.
- I would like to negotiate.<eos> - Mr Channing has made his decision!<eos> I will not be shut down!<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> Pack up this equipment. Do it quickly.<eos> I'm sorry, everybody, we are being shut down... because of the actions of one stupid individual...<eos> Elizabeth Birdsworth.<eos> Me?<eos> Sonia that was an accident.<eos> - I did...
You wanted to kill me.<eos> Prepared.<eos> I was prepared to kill you.<eos> Being prepared for something doesn't necessarily speak to desire, and here we are.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> I'm told you're opening offices in Paris and London.<eos> My accountant's untimely demise left the door wide open for you to purchase that fleet of cruise ships for a song.<eos> - Well, now...<eos> - I know what happened with Von Hauser.<eos> Everyone does.
Are they?<eos> Baldur, you and I are deal-makers.<eos> We buy low and sell high.<eos> Getting that cruise line on the cheap was better than sex with your mistress.<eos> Either of them.<eos> I'm a little down on my luck.<eos> A penny stock.<eos> Invest in me now and when I rise, you'll be able to afford three mistresses.<eos> I may have something in steerage.<eos> Done.
(gasps) Adam, she lied.<eos> Straight to my phone!<eos> You know, this isn't the first time she said she was at the library.<eos> How many of those other times were lies?<eos> Who knows?<eos> Probably a lot.<eos> I mean, it's right there in the name: lie-brary.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Well, she's gonna come home sometime.<eos> And when she does...
It was pretty innocuous.<eos> Did he tell you who he was sleeping with?<eos> No.<eos> He was there to teach my daughter.<eos> Tight little town, gay man.<eos> How did that work?<eos> It worked fine.<eos> Here, you contribute, you're in.<eos> - Everybody loved him.<eos> - Well, somebody didn't.
She turned up murdered in a field in Lansdowne.<eos> I was flooded with childhood memories.<eos> Like the time when my father came home very inebriated and he was yelling at my mother saying, "Do you wanna know why I drink?<eos> Because I killed a woman. We put her behind the shop."<eos> I used to beg my father before my father died and I would just ask him over and over and over again, and the only answer I could ever get from my father was,<eos> "Shar, just leave it alone.<eos> It's just one of those things, you should just leave it alone."<eos> He never said, "Oh, my God.<eos> You're so ridiculous. How... "<eos> He didn't do that.
Ugh, get a room.<eos> Hey, Jordan. I wanted to thank you.<eos> For what, chicken and waffles?<eos> Just give it a few hours.<eos> You might change your mind.<eos> No, for giving me a chance.<eos> I didn't wake up today thinking I'd be a doctor again.<eos> Oh. Well, I mean, like I said, you're helping us out.<eos> We're taking advantage of you.<eos> Oh, yeah? Well... do it anytime.
Our family's.<eos> This... isn't... over...<eos> I gotta be honest. It looks pretty over.<eos> My whole life... I thought if I knew where I came from, I'd learn where I was going, what my purpose in life is.<eos> Turns out... I was right.<eos> So now, you're giving up fashion design to become... what? A hero?<eos> I'm not giving up my art.<eos> The truth is... that jerk I stabbed in the hand... He was right.<eos> My work lacked identity, because I didn't have it.<eos> And now I do.
But she's not willing to face me and own up to what she did.<eos> All she did, Dr. Manning, was care for your patients.<eos> Which means she violated their partnership agreement.<eos> And according to the Hippocratic Oath, patient care supersedes any legal agreement.<eos> She didn't care about those patients.<eos> She just wanted to steal my business.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why did they contact her?<eos> You have no proof of that.<eos> Yes, I do.
Are you telling me to go back on my word because your client's bullying you?<eos> Harvey, I thought we were in this together.<eos> - So did I.<eos> - Then get on board.<eos> Because they're not just any client.<eos> They're one of my biggest.<eos> And if they leave because you chose some prisoner over one of the biggest developers in the country, people are gonna get the message that we don't want to be in the real estate business.<eos> Did they say they were gonna give people that message?<eos> - Harvey--<eos> - Did they or not?
You told me you were afraid that I was gonna become better friends with him than you, and that's what this is.<eos> How dare you say that to me in front of Donna?<eos> I told you that in complete confidence.<eos> This isn't about my relationship with Alex.<eos> This is about your relationship with Alex and how you're afraid to stand up to him.<eos> You want to run that by me again?<eos> I just ran it by you.<eos> What you are doing is a mistake.<eos> I don't think so, and Donna doesn't think so, which means--<eos> Actually, Harvey, I do.
I remember now.<eos> You're not with that guy today?<eos> Excuse me, but if you want to talk, could you please sit down?<eos> Then, I will.<eos> Why do you write novels, Mr. Hanaki?<eos> Simply put, it is my mission.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't think people had a mission.<eos> I don't think everyone has one.<eos> But, like me and yourself, Nanaka, some humans do.
And, please, be specific.<eos> Dude, what the hell?<eos> I'm doing research on how to steal a woman, and Bailey is the perfect test subject, because she's a skank.<eos> So you're doing research on how to steal a woman?<eos> Awesome!<eos> Arlo, be nice.<eos> You tryin' to get laid?<eos> You gonna tap some ass?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> What does that do?
They stopped!<eos> The last stage of the game is quite simple.<eos> In one hour, whoever has killed the most people will be allowed to live.<eos> The current tally is as follows.<eos> Barry Norris, 11 kills.<eos> Wendell Dukes, seven kills.<eos> Vincent Agostino, one kill.<eos> Daniele Wilkins, one kill.<eos> Begin.<eos> No! Don't!
Well, he's askin' if I'd kill a man for some corn.<eos> I don't know.<eos> See, Lieutenant, you steal our corn, we got nothin' to feed the hogs.<eos> If we can't feed the hogs, we got nothin' to put in the smokehouse.<eos> We got nothin' to put in the smokehouse, we starve in the winter.<eos> That's murder, ain't it?<eos> You know what the penalty for murder is, don't you, Lieutenant?<eos> Yeah. Hmm?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Yeah, you do.
My hands.<eos> It's not about your hands.<eos> How is this not about my hands?<eos> Master Hamir.<eos> Thank you, Master Hamir.<eos> You cannot beat a river into submission.<eos> You have to surrender to its current, and use its power as your own.<eos> I control it by surrendering control?<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Not everything does.

- You know what?<eos> Usually we can't even get people over here.<eos> - But we have never...<eos> - She came right over to it.<eos> Never had anybody actually put their face down close to the machine.<eos> It's a cool joke.<eos> That was funny.<eos> It's disgusting.<eos> Is it more or less disgusting if I tell you it came from the front?<eos> - Oh, you didn't...
Why are you doing this?<eos> Because he doesn't believe us.<eos> Erin.<eos> Come on, we have finally succeeded at doing the thing that we have talked about since we were little kids.<eos> And you want to risk it all, what, for him?<eos> Who cares if you impress him?<eos> Oh, golly, you two are something.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - I don't...
I was born to be a Ghostbuster, all right?<eos> Nothing's gonna stop me!<eos> - Oh, man.<eos> - Kevin!<eos> Come on, Rowan, get out of him!<eos> Thanks for the upgrade.<eos> Rowan, ya big bully!<eos> Hope this guy knows how to ride a motorcycle.<eos> Rowan, not Kevin!<eos> Yeah, he does.
I'm not gonna ask you nicely.<eos> Play with her.<eos> Do it.<eos> Fine.<eos> Keep going.<eos> Now look at me.<eos> Both... both of you.<eos> - I think I know what you want.<eos> - No, you don't. - Yeah, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
In every male and female friendship, there's a number of drinks, and if you pass it, you have to have sex, mathematically.<eos> Whatever, dude.<eos> Oi. Sorry. Loud noise.<eos> Wha... Where did that come from?<eos> Uh, the floor.<eos> That's three.<eos> It's just ten.<eos> Did you drink this?<eos> No. Oh, thank God.<eos> You did.
You f-ed with my stuff.<eos> I don't--i don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Why the hell's ahab asleep, then?<eos> Oh, i-- maybe he was tired.<eos> My white ass.<eos> Hey, hey, what-- what are you doing?<eos> Bingo.<eos> What bingo?<eos> What-- your eyes darted.<eos> No. No, my-- no, they didn't.
What are you really up to?<eos> It's a "need- to- know", and, all you need to know is you work for me.<eos> That can change with a phone call.<eos> I have friends, too. You know.<eos> There you go.<eos> Call'em.<eos> But without you minding her, your lady friend stays here strapped to a board in a drug- induced coma.<eos> They warned me about you.<eos> I didn't believe the stories.<eos> Nobody does.
It was your memory. Why would I see one of your memories?<eos> See? I told you.<eos> We are linked.<eos> I feel like you're not listening to me.<eos> I heard a voice that said something about... I keep repeating myself. It's getting old.<eos> Is that what you are?<eos> Ultralinks? No!<eos> Max, those are very dangerous.<eos> They destroy worlds. They destroy everything.<eos> They don't...
I'm happy to hear that.<eos> What is your plan?<eos> I'll do it at the inauguration.<eos> Really?<eos> Same place you were going to kill the president?<eos> If everybody thinks I'm gonna kill the president, no one will suspect my actual objective.<eos> And with Masovich's bodyguards all outside during the party,<eos> -he will be at his most vulnerable.<eos> -Are you sure it will work?<eos> Already did.
I don't know CPR!<eos> How do you not know?<eos> You know everything.<eos> Yeah, about taking lives, not saving them.<eos> Give me the gun.<eos> Say good night, bitch!<eos> Good night, bitch.<eos> Arrest that man for the assassination of President Cueto.<eos> I didn't do anything. I did not do it.<eos> He did it.
That's how many aliens you killed, right?<eos> How did you do it?<eos> You have to get them from behind.<eos> Catherine... I think I just found another one of your doodles.<eos> Charlie, tell command to prep the lab at Area 51.<eos> How's it looking up there, Captain Hiller?<eos> It's truly humbling to see how beautiful Earth is from here, Madam President.<eos> On this day, in 1996... President Whitmore passionately declared...<eos> "We will not go quietly into the night."<eos> And we did not.
She's so little.<eos> Now she's not fucked up by you yet.<eos> You don't even care!<eos> I'm not gonna ask you again.<eos> Hand over the child.<eos> She doesn't want her.<eos> Ask her. Ask her, right now.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you?<eos> I do. I do... Please.
Even that I didn't push, you know.<eos> I pretty much passive-aggressively nudge.<eos> I was just trying to save Frank.<eos> Who is Frank?<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah, I'm Frank.<eos> - The fault is yours, then, huh?<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I didn't mean for any of this to happen.<eos> Well, it did.
A place where the gods care for you... and all your wildest and wettest dreams would come true.<eos> They would go out those doors happy instead of shitting themselves.<eos> Wait, wait.<eos> So you're telling me you wrote the song?<eos> I can't take full credit.<eos> I wrote the music. Twink is my lyricist.<eos> The melody came to me one night... when I was getting super, super, super baked.<eos> Like fuck-a-guy baked.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Yeah, he does.
Please don't make it worse.<eos> Just come on, we have to get home before it's too late.<eos> Well, Brenda, I can't just do that.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> I need to go to the Dark Aisle, and I want you to come with me.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> - I want you to come home with me. - Well...<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Then I don't really know what to do right now.<eos> I don't either.
So, what is it?<eos> What have you come to say?<eos> It's Bianca.<eos> She's got a brother.<eos> He's in town, says he has what we've been looking for.<eos> He's out of control, Mike.<eos> You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.<eos> Bianca isn't a problem anymore.<eos> I'm afraid that's his problem.<eos> Oh, my God, you didn't.
What have you come to say?<eos> It's Bianca.<eos> She's got a brother.<eos> He's in town, says he has what we've been looking for.<eos> He's out of control, Mike.<eos> You told me Bianca was not a problem anymore.<eos> Bianca isn't a problem anymore.<eos> I'm afraid that's his problem.<eos> Oh, my God, you didn't.<eos> - Your guys didn't...
Is this about Bianca?<eos> What difference is it going to make to her now?<eos> Okay, see you in the morning, Scott.<eos> - Drive safe.<eos> - All right, see you.<eos> Hey, Scott, you still here?<eos> I'm Bianca's brother.<eos> I'm in your office.<eos> I've got what you want, and you've got what I want.<eos> How did you...?
Armand!<eos> Armand?<eos> Armand!<eos> All aboard, ma'am.<eos> Welcome back, detective.<eos> - How was your holiday?<eos> - All right.<eos> I'll grab your bag.<eos> Did you get to see your sister in Los Angeles?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Homicide.<eos> Detective Allen.<eos> Major Crimes.<eos> All right, well maybe we'll get some answers out of him.<eos> What, you think they're just going to arrest him...<eos> Put him in a comfy cell? They're not.<eos> He's right.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> No, I didn't know him.<eos> But Marcus sure did.
One more, fuckin' one more!<eos> One more fuckin' fuckers leave me.<eos> - Guess what?<eos> Fuckin' what.<eos> I wonder, too, okay.<eos> I mean, where the fuck is everyone always goin'?<eos> Huh?<eos> Where's everyone goin' all the time?<eos> Think I don't care?<eos> I fuckin' do.
Excuse me?<eos> - My name is Craig, not Greg.<eos> It's Craig.<eos> With a 'c'.<eos> - Subject Craig Leeham is 27 years old period.<eos> The subject has consented to participate in accordance with IRB guidelines.<eos> Mr. Leeham, Mr. Leeham.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Please state for the video record that you understand the nature of this study.<eos> - I do.
- She did great, Brayden.<eos> Blood loss looked a lot worse than what it was.<eos> Well, listen, you know what I mean, me and Donna we're just so sorry.<eos> - Dev, thanks again.<eos> I'm glad it was you on call.<eos> - Is she awake?<eos> - Yeah, she just woke up.<eos> She was so excited about the baby.<eos> She really wanted it.<eos> We both did.
And I...<eos> I probably failed at, uh, keeping my fighter grounded.<eos> But I can tell you this:<eos> Roberto Durán is no coward.<eos> He did not leave the ring out of fear of an opponent.<eos> He left it out of pride.<eos> There is talk of suspending Durán.<eos> What would you say about that?<eos> I-I don't know what happened.<eos> And if I don't, then you don't.
I-I can't. I-I'm done with it. And it has nothing to do with you.<eos> We're talking about me now.<eos> You don't need me.<eos> You never really did.<eos> You're a naturally great fighter.<eos> You have great fighter's instincts.<eos> I was just there to support you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I need you in my corner, Ray.<eos> Not anymore, you don't.
- They don't care about you.<eos> - I don't fucking...<eos> And they certainly don't believe in you.<eos> - Yeah, but, Kay, I found gold. - Goddamn...<eos> Now we're winning, babe.<eos> Would you just let me have the win?<eos> We're winning!<eos> It ever occur to you that I know what I'm doing?<eos> I hope you do.<eos> I do.
Wait, I'm sorry.<eos> What's the trifecta again?<eos> It's this thing I read about where in my senior year I have to fuck a freshman, an alumni, and a professor.<eos> Where did you read that?<eos> -In my diary.<eos> Where I wrote it...<eos> -Yeah. He used to take the most beautiful portraits without using any filters or Photoshop...<eos> I've read your diary.<eos> He was amazing.<eos> My God, you did?
-I remember you in high school, you were ripping people's dicks off on the football field, talking about traveling the world!<eos> Now you're pushing some papers at a fucking law firm and probably peeing sitting down.<eos> Grandpa, I don't know what you thought this weekend was going to be about, but I came here for one reason, to get you to Boca.<eos> That's it.<eos> Fine. Now can I please play some golf?<eos> Fucking golf.<eos> -Okay. Cocky McBlockerson.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Bam!<eos> Who does your taxes? HR Cock-block?
It was supposed to be a 5K.<eos> Uh, I finished about 1K of it.<eos> So, I should probably return four-fifths of the money.<eos> So, Andrew told me you and Efraim are working together now?<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I told her about the sheet thing.<eos> Yeah. Efraim has some contacts with the government.<eos> So we're just combining forces right now.<eos> Yeah, just... Just be careful with him.<eos> - Emily, don't.
No. That's--<eos> You can never even think about staying over with people that we don't know or you'll never be allowed to go again.<eos> What do you believe in, Daddy?<eos> This is not about politics.<eos> My responsibility is to you, not the war.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> That's why I have to go to New York, because people there do feel responsible, responsible for blowing up Vietnamese villages, blowing up little babies.<eos> But you don't care.<eos> And neither does Mother.<eos> No one in our family or in our fucking little town does.
Sir, what the police was not able to do for years this man has done in hours.<eos> Yes he is Superman, Batman...<eos> Spiderman...<eos> I forget that you are from the generation that has grown up reading comics...<eos> Listen child... life is not a thirty page comic book...<eos> You are the one who asked me to help him.<eos> Yes I did say that... because he was just a tourist then ...and now he is a criminal in this country...<eos> And till the time all is not clarified or proven, that he is not involved in any criminal activity.... ...but actually doing social good...<eos> Do you even understand the difference?<eos> I do sir...
Whatever. It's not a big deal. You shouldn't let it bother you.<eos> It's not a big deal?<eos> No.<eos> What, that someone could be watching you right now?<eos> No, I'm not hiding anything.<eos> That's such a bullshit line.<eos> What is?<eos> I have nothing to hide.<eos> I don't.<eos> Everyone does.
You liking' the show?<eos> You know it.<eos> We track 'em, you whack 'em.<eos> And who did we just track?<eos> Not who, what.<eos> We're targeting bad guys' cell phones.<eos> Sometimes the SIM card.<eos> Okay, and how do we know the bad guy is in possession of the bad cell phone when we strike?<eos> Well, we don't...<eos> Course we do.
Go, go, go, go!<eos> Jared, get in the car!<eos> Matt, we have a problem here.<eos> Gentleman got the contract with, I don't know, somebody.<eos> This is who they say the mole was.<eos> So we interviewed him?<eos> Yeah, over a year ago.<eos> Remember when you asked me to find out who was on the phone with Webb?<eos> Of course.<eos> I did.
Ready?<eos> That's good.<eos> It works.<eos> Yes!<eos> This is amazing! Go again.<eos> Matt.<eos> Yes?<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> Have you seen this?<eos> Do it again!
I mean, this is- it could feasibly be- yeah for..<eos> I could be on tour with this... For a couple of years at least, just this record.<eos> Do you like the music you're playing?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't know... what- what it matters.<eos> Well, it matters because... if you're going to give up your dream.<eos> I think it matters... that you like what you're playing on the road for years.<eos> Do you like the music that I play?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
- Hang on.<eos> - No, I saw you!<eos> - Hang on.<eos> Picked up right where you left off.<eos> Gabby, stop!<eos> Listen to me, please.<eos> I love you.<eos> Well, I don't love you.<eos> Mother: Oh, hush!<eos> You do, too.
He's not my dad.<eos> What?<eos> He was my pimp...<eos> If you borrowed money, you gotta pay it back!<eos> How could you leave me hanging like that?<eos> Because you ran away...<eos> Goddamn it!<eos> Shit!<eos> You messed me up, real good!<eos> Please don't...
Hye-sun.<eos> Hye-sun!<eos> Listen, you keep saying you want to go home. Should I let you in on something?<eos> After you took off, I went to your place to collect.<eos> Your dad was really sick.<eos> Do you know what I told him?<eos> That you took my money and left, so he should pay back his kid's debt instead.<eos> Then he asked me for just a week.<eos> He said he needed a week.<eos> So what do I do?
- I'm not being stupid, I'm being pissed off.<eos> - Oh, whatever.<eos> - You know what, you do this.<eos> - I do what?<eos> - You get close, you cut me off, you push me away.<eos> - I'm not pushing you away.<eos> - Did you fuck that guy?<eos> - Did I fuck what guy?<eos> - You know.<eos> - I don't.
This Union is decided, Sarman...<eos> no one can change it!<eos> There is no situation that cannot be changed!<eos> Go!<eos> The other way.<eos> This way!<eos> Go!<eos> What?<eos> What...?<eos> And did you also...?
Then he began stripping the Sindhu Order of its principles... and violated its rules of conduct and trade.<eos> And what Srujan had said, came true.<eos> Because of the dam, the Sindhu River began to turn away... and many villages ran dry.<eos> The villagers started to migrate to Mohenjo Daro.<eos> The city grew, the number of people increased... and under their pressure, Mohenjo Daro began to crumble.<eos> The Maham Order had begun.<eos> Whoever supported him was given Gold... the rest were given death.<eos> Srujan did not commit any crime.<eos> We did!<eos> I did!
The way we left things was...<eos> - Was it?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> I see.<eos> You know, sometimes...<eos> I know, but it's hard because...<eos> I get it.<eos> I've been there.<eos> Thanks, Lieutenant, you always know what to...<eos> I do.
That's why you get 200,000 people surrendering to 60,000.<eos> That's the difference.<eos> Now, the thing is, politicians, they don't understand tactics.<eos> And soldiers, they don't understand strategy.<eos> But Caesar, he understood both.<eos> Julius Caesar in the corner.<eos> He's read it all.<eos> He knows every battle ever fought.<eos> - Does he know about the real thing?<eos> - None of us do.
So the writer tells me the main character of the show is a cop who gets his legs blown off in Afghanistan, comes back, gets fitted for those carbon-compound kangaroo feet...<eos> Like that Olympics guy who shot his girlfriend in the can... And gets back on the job.<eos> So, like what? Goes bouncing around after the bad guys?<eos> Apparently that's the whole point.<eos> RoboDouche.<eos> I told him, "Hey, you want to do something original? How about a series with a cop who doesn't give a shit?"<eos> Punches out, comes home, has dinner with his family, bangs the wife, and sleeps like a log.<eos> You write a show like that, and the job will throw you a parade.<eos> Am I right, Dennis?<eos> What the fuck you still doing here?
It's clear to me just looking at them.<eos> So, I tell them, uh,<eos> "Don't be stupid, take the deal."<eos> The first time I saw Naz, he was sitting alone in a holding cell at the 21st Precinct.<eos> He'd just been arrested.<eos> I walked past him, out of the station and then stopped.<eos> I turned around and went back.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I didn't see what I see in my other clients.<eos> And I still don't after all this time.
Holy shit, dude. Where the fuck was your dick, dawg?<eos> What happened out there?<eos> What happened to the trick?<eos> Conner, don't worry.<eos> Nobody saw anything.<eos> I wish they had seen something.<eos> Now, there's 10,000 people that think I got no dick.<eos> Wait. You guys know I have a dick, right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You do. You do.
Was that a general statement or are we bringing God into this conversation?<eos> I mean, do you believe in God?<eos> I do, but I wouldn't go so far as to say He'd approve.<eos> Think He's gonna let you get into Heaven?<eos> - Why does that matter?<eos> - If one believes in God, isn't that what it all comes down to, where we end up after all this?<eos> Probably not, but maybe.<eos> I'll go to Hell so someone else could go to Heaven.<eos> - You got my package?<eos> - I did.
Our customers deserve a sense of protection, don't you think?<eos> - Yourself as well, I'm sure.<eos> - Yeah, everyone.<eos> So, West Chester... you seem to have some kind of relationship with the man who was killed there?<eos> Dagley?<eos> If you're referring to him informing the military about the kidnapping plot against my brother, then, yes, of course.<eos> He was a hero.<eos> - Were you and your brother close?<eos> - Very close. - You have any brothers?<eos> - I do actually.
Do you know what I think about a lot?<eos> Your death.<eos> I don't mean with the lethal injection that's probably... what, a good 10 years away.<eos> What I think about is... Killing you with my own hands.<eos> The way you killed my wife with your own hands.<eos> Yeah, Jackson's still alone.<eos> Keep me updated.<eos> Derohan should be there soon to relieve you.<eos> You really think all that money's in there?<eos> Yeah, I really do.
Does the, um, the secret rule have a name?<eos> Yes, "The Right of Disposal".<eos> "The Right of Disposal".<eos> You're allowed to do it with poison or weed killer, if you have any.<eos> Or you can just drop something heavy on him like a medical encyclopedia or Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix.<eos> So... where did you learn about the secret rule?<eos> Let's talk about your dad.<eos> I don't like what you're insinuating!<eos> Yes, it was my idea to bring Lou-Lou here!<eos> Peter did nothing wrong!
I don't why but I like it.<eos> All right, let's go.<eos> I might take up singing again.<eos> I've always wanted to sing.<eos> I'm worried about you.<eos> The lift had to be down!<eos> Wait for me.<eos> They'll feed us their vile apricot chicken.<eos> The Vaunoy cook very well.<eos> Sure they do...
Well, that's awesome.<eos> Oh, I never seen anybody so happy in my whole life.<eos> - Aww. - Oh, its nice in here.<eos> You keep it nice.<eos> Wow. - What a homemaker.<eos> - Fuck off.<eos> All right.<eos> Get away from me.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Oh, don't.
- with uncle Donny?<eos> - Minnetonka.<eos> - Minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> - Okay, minnetonka, Minnesota.<eos> Same difference.<eos> What about my mother?<eos> Huh?<eos> The judge would never let that happen.<eos> And anyway, no one even knows where she is.<eos> I do.
Otherwise, let's just leave it.<eos> I just don't like him being in a freezer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't like it, either, but it isn't him because he's gone.<eos> It's just his body.<eos> I'm just saying it kind of freaks me out.<eos> Oh, god damn it, where did I park the car?<eos> Yeah, I don't know, but i wish you'd figure it out because I'm freezing my ass off.<eos> You don't have a normal winter coat?<eos> - Huh? - Yeah. Yeah, I do.
All right, I'm calmer now.<eos> Can you please just go away?<eos> No.<eos> Cool!<eos> How much are they payin' you?<eos> Minimum wage plus the room.<eos> All right.<eos> Let's go get some furniture.<eos> I got furniture.<eos> No, you don't.
It's like you said, love is bringing me back to life.<eos> I'm your multipurpose tool guy.<eos> That sounds really...<eos> Stupid.<eos> Hurry, before you starve and die.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> You think I look beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
Just, you know, whatever comes naturally.<eos> Hello.<eos> I don't know why, but I have this sudden urge to put my mouth on your mouth.<eos> Okay, that's called kissing, but you can't do that yet.<eos> That's too fast.<eos> Oh.<eos> Uh... How 'bout if I put my penis in you?<eos> - That's even worse.<eos> - Oh, I'm so sorry.<eos> What about if I just did the tip, like, just the very beginning...
Call me when you get there.<eos> Carmen, I was gonna get you the face cream...<eos> It's all right, your baby's fine.<eos> He's perfectly safe.<eos> Carmen?<eos> We've got your kid, now calm down.<eos> He's all right.<eos> - He's just a little baby.<eos> - I know.<eos> - He didn't, doesn't...
- Oh, okay.<eos> Okay, so Jason's the ascended master.<eos> Oh, no, no, guys, I just think I need a bigger dose.<eos> No, baby.<eos> You're the only man here who doesn't need a dose at all.<eos> Now can we get back to having the best fucking night ever?<eos> All right, I'm bringing it up.<eos> Hey, all right, you two fucking on the dance floor last night?<eos> I'm sorry, I guess I was just raised a little differently than you, slut.<eos> - No, no, we didn't.
I liked her.<eos> She liked me.<eos> We drank.<eos> We went to bed.<eos> Woke up in the kitchen.<eos> I don't remember going there.<eos> I went back upstairs to the bedroom.<eos> I didn't kill her.<eos> Even if you can't remember anything, you'd know that. You'd feel it, right?<eos> I don't.
See, the reason it feels like silk is because from the day it's born, they keep it in a dark crate, so small they can't even turn around.<eos> And it stays there, half-blind in the dark, drinking baby formula, waiting to die.<eos> There are some bad people in here, but I could protect you.<eos> Nasir, do you want my protection?<eos> Or do you prefer dead in the shower, with your brains bashed in, guts on the floor?<eos> It's up to you.<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He offered to help me in here.<eos> - And you said?<eos> - I didn't.
Ground unit, get your asses moving and get here now.<eos> Turn here and stop.<eos> Do we just wait here?<eos> No, they'll have units on the ground.<eos> They're gonna be all over us.<eos> We all better figure it out fast 'cause I don't like it here.<eos> It doesn't make any sense.<eos> There was no way they could've known we'd be in this van.<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> They did.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - Are you?<eos> 'Cause it sure as shit don't look like you're working on anything here.<eos> Well, you should spend more time here.<eos> - It's a process.<eos> - I'm not fuckin' around.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Do you need to know or does your husband?<eos> You know I hate it when you call her that.<eos> Course I do.
"Wherever you go, I go, too."<eos> That's what you said.<eos> I said that because I want you and Little Sam to be safe.<eos> That's all I want-- to become a maester so I can help Jon when the time comes so you'll be safe.<eos> Us and everyone else in the world.<eos> I don't care about them.<eos> Well, no, I do, but I don't really.<eos> I care about you and him.<eos> I know that, Sam.<eos> And he does, too.
Steve's with my associate, Dr. Kalgary, about to undergo an irreversible, fabulously risky, height-boosting procedure.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Steve will be sliced into pieces, and when he's reassembled, he'll be exactly like the boy you remember, only taller and with a lot more bones... if he lives.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why would Steve do something like this?<eos> Wait, does he think he stopped growing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> I know what this is about.<eos> You do?
Mr. Khan, is that your understanding?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - All right.<eos> You're gonna be asked a series of questions by the district attorney.<eos> If at any time you don't understand what's being asked of you or you have any need for clarification, feel free to interrupt and ask any question, okay?<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Defendant, please rise.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear or affirm to tell the truth, the whole truth, - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Then I went to her... and I saw that she was dead.<eos> I panicked. I ran.<eos> And?<eos> And, uh...<eos> That's all I remember.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Ask him again.<eos> You drank, took drugs, had sex, and... killed her.<eos> No, I didn't.
No, don't.<eos> Please... please don't.<eos> I've had an accident.<eos> Oh, it's not the end of the world.<eos> It was that exercise.<eos> Me clothes are soaked.<eos> Would you, erm, fetch me mac for me, so's I can go out through the hall?<eos> Of course.<eos> Has this happened to you before?<eos> Well, it does, doesn't it, to women?
Johnny's labour?<eos> We'd find him asleep through his shifts, curled up like a stray in the haulage crates.<eos> Well, perhaps he was just under the weather.<eos> Yeah, and perhaps he was workshy.<eos> The docks are brutal and I need men that's fit for them.<eos> Now, if you need a worthy cause, Miss, I suggest you find a Seaman's Mission.<eos> Men give you their lives, Mr Gibson.<eos> At least respect them, even if you won't protect them.<eos> I think it was when we were at the community centre.<eos> I really don't...
It must've brought back so many awful memories.<eos> I so wanted to let you comfort me.<eos> But I didn't know how to do it with the others there.<eos> Patsy, if me being here makes you uncomfortable, I can go.<eos> - I'm sure I'd find somewhere...<eos> - No!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> I want you here.<eos> I nearly lost you once already.<eos> But you didn't.
By the island in the river<eos> Flowing down to Camelot.<eos> That was my favourite.<eos> It isn't about the Thames, Linda.<eos> My life isn't going to be about clocking in at the paintworks day in, day out, like my mum and dad's.<eos> I'm going to get us both right out of here.<eos> When I get my degree, we can go where we like.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Well, if you don't know, Lin, I do.<eos> "I do."
Sister, this was the kinder way.<eos> We couldn't even tell whether it was male or female.<eos> May the Lord bless you and keep you.<eos> May he make his face shine upon you, and be gracious unto you, and grant you peace.<eos> I think it's gone.<eos> It hasn't been baptised.<eos> I should've baptised it myself.<eos> You don't have to be a priest to christen a baby, did you know that?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
But your poor little baby was born... so desperately unwell.<eos> And it wasn't possible for us to save it.<eos> Did it die?<eos> Yes, Ruby.<eos> In my arms.<eos> Was it a girl?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> Always knew.<eos> Yes. Yes, you did.
Yes. Yes, you did.<eos> Did she cry?<eos> A little.<eos> But when she took her last breath, she was warm and safe...<eos> .. and I believe she was aware she was loved.<eos> I wished so hard for her.<eos> Maybe I shouldn't have.<eos> Maybe I'm being punished.<eos> - But God knows I love my boys...<eos> - He does.
It says here that he had his appendix out, on land, in New Zealand in 1957.<eos> So he could've been involved in the H Bomb tests.<eos> We'd have to check.<eos> The H Bomb?<eos> Deformed babies have been born in the South Seas.<eos> There's one school of thought that blames nuclear testing.<eos> It happened after Hiroshima and Nagasaki too.<eos> We did it in History.<eos> So World War II is history now, is it?<eos> We do exams in it and everything.
Was it a brother, sister, or family member that you didn't focus on like you should have, while you were growing your life, earning your degree?<eos> Time's up, guys.<eos> Mr. Lucas?<eos> Two minutes.<eos> Most you've said since you've been here.<eos> I might have gone a few words past necessary.<eos> My brother, he died in jail while I was getting my masters.<eos> I knew he needed help, but at the time I felt I did all I could do, and I have... regretted feeling that way ever since.<eos> - Sorry I pressed.<eos> - You did.
Are you in here, man?<eos> - Scarfe?<eos> - No cops.<eos> - Not even Misty.<eos> - Why me?<eos> 'Cause you don't trust us.<eos> We need to get him to a hospital.<eos> No, I can't go to the hospital.<eos> They'll kill me.<eos> Just like they did Chico.
- Detective Knight?<eos> - Candace? - Yeah.<eos> What number are you calling me from?<eos> A prepaid phone I picked up from CVS.<eos> I need to see you.<eos> - Come into the precinct. - No. No.<eos> You saw how quickly Mariah sent that lawyer and got me out of there.<eos> You didn't wanna talk to me before.<eos> What makes you trust me now?<eos> Because Luke Cage does.
We got as far as an apartment on top of a restaurant across the road from the radio station.<eos> - You don't like it?<eos> - Oh, no, it's lovely.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I...<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> It's just... you know.<eos> You know Kim and Kanye?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
I know about Beirut.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> It all ends tonight.<eos> Be a lot easier to do it right away.<eos> You didn't come here for revenge.<eos> You came here because you know it's time to come in.<eos> Your father created the program.<eos> Didn't have what it takes to make it work.<eos> And you did.<eos> You always did.
It was like a party every afternoon.<eos> I finally let Poppy over to meet Mr. Church.<eos> Once I did, I couldn't get rid of her.<eos> Mr. Church, this is the best lemonade... I've ever tasted.<eos> The secret to that, my dear, is the licorice.<eos> You and your secrets, Mr. Church.<eos> My sister loved the banana bread you made.<eos> Oh, thank you, Poppy-<eos> "My sister loved the banana bread you made."<eos> She did.
- Yeah.<eos> - Feel it.<eos> Isn't that fabric wonderful?<eos> Amazing.<eos> Aunt Poppy plans to spoil you rotten.<eos> These stores are expensive.<eos> Let me.<eos> I'll never have a child of my own.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
I would have killed him, but they don't let. People in coach kill people in first class.<eos> That's true.<eos> That's a rule.<eos> So this is a dead end.<eos> Why don't we get back to the precinct and see if forensics had better luck?<eos> Thank you for your time, sir.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> I hope you found something because we have no leads and the next murder flight leaves in three hours.<eos> As a matter of fact, we did.
- Oh, good, you remember us.<eos> It's not my fault, okay?<eos> You gotta believe me.<eos> I didn't fucking do anything.<eos> - Just save it.<eos> Save it! - Please help me!<eos> - These guys are gonna kill me!<eos> You're gonna wanna pay attention to my questions. Please.<eos> No, wait, wait, wait!<eos> Oh, God, please don't!
Dangerous.<eos> Besides, it ain't what the Heavenly Father wants for us.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Have some more of that chicken.<eos> Looks real good.<eos> Father disagreed with the Prophet on Thor Gundersen.<eos> Got him cast out. And us with him.<eos> I know.<eos> So, where'd you say you're headed?<eos> I didn't.
You chose... to disregard my warnings.<eos> However, you... You have been loyal to the railroad and I would like you to have this.<eos> Thirty pieces of silver don't buy back what you took.<eos> I hope you're not looking for an apology.<eos> It would be beneath your dignity to ask, and mine to offer.<eos> I guess I better get back to the cut, then.<eos> There's pieces in there still.<eos> Doctor couldn't get it all.<eos> It won't ever heal then.<eos> Some things don't.
I'm moving too fast.<eos> I-I got swept up, and I-I pushed for something that you're not ready for.<eos> No, no, that's not it.<eos> I would love to go away with you.<eos> - You would?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But, um... dropping everything and jetting off to Europe...<eos> I don't know why, but... it's hard for me imagining myself getting carried away like that.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - You do?
She's a notoriously private person.<eos> Her online presence has been totally scrubbed.<eos> I was able to find one article that mentions her from Equatorial Guinea.<eos> It's a piece about the de-mining efforts in that region.<eos> And she just happens to be with our victim.<eos> - For 3 1/2 weeks.<eos> - Are we talking about the heiress?<eos> Current theory ... scorned woman plants land mine.<eos> - You got anything better?<eos> - I do.
Emily, what are you doing?<eos> All right, everyone, it's time for the maid of honor to talk.<eos> And get comfy, 'cause I tend to get a little chatty after champagne.<eos> Okay, so, I've known Emily since freshman year of college.<eos> That's when she was going through what I like to call her "mom jeans" phase.<eos> But with my guidance she rebounded from fashion disaster.<eos> Sweetie, dial it back.<eos> When she met Will, I knew it was special.<eos> She never talked about boys, so when she brought him up, I just knew that...<eos> Okay, Em, kind of doing something up here.
But then sales start to level off.<eos> The drive-in model as we learned, - has a few built-in problems. - Tell me about it.<eos> For starters, there's the customer issue.<eos> Drive-in's tend to attract, shall we say, a less than desirable clientele.<eos> - Teenagers.<eos> - Hot rodders and hooligans.<eos> Juvenile delinquents in blue jeans.<eos> And then there's the service.<eos> It takes forever and a day for your food to arrive.<eos> - And when it finally does...
Yeah, a guy named McDonald.<eos> He's never going to get pushed around in life. That's clearly not the case.<eos> So, you don't have a check for<eos> $1.35 million dollars in your pocket?<eos> Bye, Dick.<eos> So if you can't beat 'em, buy 'em.<eos> I remember the first time I saw that name stretched across your stand out there.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> I knew right then and there, I had to have it.<eos> - And now I do.
Why was I cuffed on...?<eos> And now it's all over TV!<eos> Not only that, why did he let you get interviewed?<eos> Whatever they asked me, I talked to them!<eos> 'Cause I told them I had nothing to hide!<eos> What do I got to hide? !<eos> Juice ain't got nothing to hide!<eos> Why in the hell were you in there alone?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> I don't...
Sustained.<eos> Mr. Darden, where are you going with this?<eos> Your Honor, I was asking in good faith.<eos> We know that the witness told a friend that he heard the angry yell of an older man who sounded black.<eos> I resent that statement, Your Honor!<eos> You cannot tell by somebody's voice whether they are black.<eos> That is a racist statement and entirely inappropriate.<eos> Your Honor, yeah, I am offended that in America, in 1995, that we have to endure this kind of thinking.<eos> All right, I didn't make the statement.<eos> The witness did.
Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Mr. Simpson is waiving his right.<eos> But if the court pleases, he would like to make a brief statement regarding the waiver.<eos> Your Honor, the People object to the defendant making any statement other than the waiver at this time.<eos> Counsel, he's not before the jury.<eos> Yes, but we are all aware of the realities of this case, the problem with conjugal visits and telephone calls that are only monitored on one side.<eos> This is an obvious attempt by the defense to get material to the jury that has not been admitted in court.<eos> It is inappropriate and deliberate.<eos> I strongly urge the court to exercise control and not permit testimony without cross-examination.<eos> Please, Your Honor, don't do this.
Bobby.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You were always there for me.<eos> You never doubted.<eos> I got a surprise for you.<eos> Want to guess what it is?<eos> Something special.<eos> The first day I was in here, you gave me your Bible.<eos> I know how much it means to you, so I'm gonna give it back to you.<eos> Yes, it does.
You didn't say it was her life!<eos> Wil...<eos> Stop!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Your father would have been proud of your actions today.<eos> As am I.<eos> I had a dream Bandon was alone, drowning in a sea of black.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> I failed him.<eos> We both did.
Your story will never end.<eos> It will be told by him and by the people he shares it with.<eos> And by the people they share it with.<eos> And by the people they share it with, and by the people they share it with.<eos> - And by the people...<eos> - Beetle.<eos> The point is your story will live on in him.<eos> Hello, my young friend.<eos> Why don't you join in my song?<eos> But how did you...
Fred, put the siren on. Get me to the Port Committee, quick!<eos> Regional Prefect?<eos> I believe the port should be modernized so I'm in favor of the sale.<eos> -Development Minister?<eos> -In favor.<eos> [police siren]<eos> And the representative for the Minister of Finance?<eos> In favor.<eos> You don't want a casino?<eos> No, we don't.
Unless we develop it, we're finished.<eos> -Without new investors--<eos> -Robert, we know that.<eos> And we all agree with you.<eos> But this is an election.<eos> The campaign has started.<eos> It's a big risk.<eos> If I don't stand, the mafia will take over the city.<eos> Nobody, not even Barrès, has the balls to stand up to them.<eos> But I do.
You were so well when I saw you.<eos> Those two girls reminded me of you and Antía.<eos> They're my nieces.<eos> But what's happened?<eos> The last time you were so well...<eos> When we met, I didn't tell you...<eos> I haven't seen Antía for 12 years.<eos> Twelve years?<eos> Did you really see her like you said?<eos> Yes, I did.
Why didn't she want to talk to you?<eos> You were her best friend.<eos> We were more than that.<eos> After the camp we were inseparable. Don't you remember?<eos> Yes, of course. You were always together.<eos> We couldn't live without each other.<eos> It's a pity it was hell at the end.<eos> Hell?<eos> I see you know nothing.<eos> I don't.
I'm garbage!<eos> I'm a garbage person!<eos> Okay, let's wrap up the one-man show and get you up to dry land, okay?<eos> Oh, what do you care?<eos> You still love her.<eos> Yeah, but I still don't want you to die of a rare pond disease.<eos> Oh, what am I doing?<eos> What am I doing, Ray?<eos> I don't know how to be a husband.<eos> No, you don't.
Hmm?<eos> Let's just get a good night's sleep.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Yeah.<eos> (faint chirp nearby) Yeah.<eos> What was that?<eos> What was what?<eos> (chirps again)<eos> You hear that, that chirping sound?<eos> I did not, no.
Forgive me.<eos> May God protect you.<eos> Mother, I beseech you, tell me the truth.<eos> What did you do with the child?<eos> - What I had to.<eos> - Meaning?<eos> I entrusted him to God.<eos> - I don't understand!<eos> Don't you believe in Providence?<eos> I do.
- You coming?<eos> - Uh, give me a minute.<eos> Listen, Ed, there's something I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> - Penguin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You want to know the nature of my relationship with him.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Because you're concerned<eos> I aided and abetted a known criminal.<eos> Did you?
And nobody gets parole.<eos> It's true.<eos> I swear it.<eos> Clear as day... a ghost.<eos> She was this pale old woman in a long black dress.<eos> - She was this close.<eos> - What did you do?<eos> Oh, I ran away screaming, of course.<eos> Oh, do you believe in ghosts, Oswald?<eos> Yes, I do.
The next day, Gertrud was gone.<eos> My parents told me only that they had come to an arrangement.<eos> She would be taken care of.<eos> And I must never make an attempt to find her.<eos> And to my shame, I didn't.<eos> I let them separate us.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> She never told me she was pregnant.<eos> She didn't tell me about you.<eos> If she did...
She didn't tell me about you.<eos> If she did...<eos> She told me that my father had died when I was still a baby.<eos> Easier than the truth, I suppose.<eos> That your father was a coward who wouldn't stand up to his parents.<eos> She must've figured that the two of you would be better off making your own way.<eos> Which, in fact, was probably the truth.<eos> Look at you.<eos> A strong young man.<eos> She did a good job, didn't she?
Bruce!<eos> Bruce!<eos> Hey!<eos> Please let me go.<eos> Bruce, listen to me.<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Alfred told me everything.<eos> He shouldn't have done that.<eos> - I understand how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
"before you react.<eos> "You need not worry that I'm in danger<eos> "or that I've lost my mind.<eos> "I've thought long and hard about this decision<eos> "and I know it's the right one.<eos> "Malone's death made me realize a couple of things.<eos> "You can't kill murder.<eos> "You can't get revenge on evil.<eos> "You can only begin to fight such things<eos> "by not doing them.
The ones you and I serve?<eos> They have to know, they have to see that we're impartial, you understand?<eos> The people of Gotham can eat my socks.<eos> Nice try.<eos> Walk away in a huff?<eos> Now I know you know something.<eos> If you're providing aid and shelter to Jim Gordon, anything... a glass of water...<eos> I will bust you like a bum I never met.<eos> Cap, I wish I knew where he was.<eos> But I don't.
Uncle Harvey has connections.<eos> Hey. Ginny.<eos> How's my favorite I.A. sugar plum, huh?<eos> Well, why do you think I'm calling, baby?<eos> Heard you were getting married.<eos> She changed her mind.<eos> Smart girl.<eos> Oh, you're an animal, Bullock,<eos> - you know that?<eos> - Oh, yes, ma'am. I do, I do.
What are you gonna do?<eos> I still have some friends I could ask for help.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Please... please, don't hurt me.<eos> Relax, I'm not gonna hurt you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> - My help?<eos> - I didn't kill Pinkney.<eos> - You have to believe me. - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know why Strange gave me this job?<eos> It's because he knows that I would kill you both and not bat an eye.<eos> So, keeping that in mind... five minutes on the clock.<eos> Starting... now.<eos> Fun.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Allow me to introduce Basil.<eos> Basil just woke up this morning.<eos> Didn't you, son? Yep.
So, just try again.<eos> Keep telling me what to do and I'll stab your face off.<eos> - Damn! Like that.<eos> Okay, now, here's the plan.<eos> Instead of you approaching Maura, we're gonna get her to come to you.<eos> Yeah, try and spread the word that you've got a connect on the outside that gives you access to contrabands:<eos> cigarettes, burner phones...<eos> Pornography.<eos> Amy, women don't watch...<eos> - They do. - Mm.
Julie loves you.<eos> Yeah, but nobody is safe if we get bought out.<eos> Nobody, okay?<eos> Especially me.<eos> I've got zero signings to my name this year.<eos> Every band I approach, they say they don't like my face. - What?<eos> - Is there something wrong with my face?<eos> Just tell me, it's fine.<eos> No, Clark, we just scored the Zeppelin deal.<eos> Richie did.
I guess you got too busy lately.<eos> Ah, well, it's a little embarrassing, but my son's having problems.<eos> What kind of problems, Big Ronnie?<eos> Between you and me,<eos> I think my son's a severe manic depressive.<eos> He should be on medication.<eos> And did I tell you he still craps the bed most nights?<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Uh-oh.<eos> No, you did not.
Somehow that's hard for all of you.<eos> Mom, I'm not "all men." Okay?<eos> I'm just me.<eos> Well, yes and no.<eos> What if I have to have full-on chemo... or get a hysterectomy?<eos> Do you know what that is?<eos> Look, I should just go with you, you know? I mean...<eos> Your mom did tell me to share my life with you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You don't...
Natasha, go and see!<eos> - Don't go. Promise?<eos> - I promise.<eos> Champagne?<eos> - Oh, I probably shouldn't.<eos> - Please.<eos> What is it? What's the matter?<eos> He doesn't love me any more.<eos> He loves Julie Karagina.<eos> No, he doesn't!
- Will you write to Boris?<eos> - No.<eos> No, I'd be ashamed to.<eos> Ashamed?<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know, it would just feel awkward.<eos> False.<eos> That's because you really love that funny one with the glasses!<eos> Pierre?<eos> I do not!
You're OK? What hap... what happened?<eos> They ran off.<eos> He scared them.<eos> He saved me.<eos> Who saved you? What...<eos> Who is he? Where the hell's he come from?<eos> He's our seasonal sous-chef from England.<eos> He was working in that kitchen.<eos> We need to call the police.<eos> Chief, we doing medical attention?
You're not alone.<eos> Let me help you.<eos> No, you have to go.<eos> No. We can handle this.<eos> No... there is no... "we."<eos> I-I... shouldn't have called you.<eos> This was a mistake.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> This has nothing to do with you.<eos> Yes, it does. It does.
Do we have a deal, chancellor?<eos> No.<eos> You know what, fuck you!<eos> Unleash the hounds, sweetie.<eos> That's how you talk in front of your daughter?<eos> MAC:<eos> Oh, I think we know how to be parents.<eos> She's a baby, "A." She doesn't retain any of that shit.<eos> Well, yes she will.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I should like to help you, if I can.<eos> But if for any reason you find conversation with me unpleasant, please say so.<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm glad to make your acquaintance.<eos> Then let me offer you a brotherly handshake.<eos> You're a Mason?<eos> Yes, I belong to the brotherhood of Freemasons.<eos> I'm afraid my way of thinking is very different from yours.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Of course you don't.
Evolving?<eos> Men don't change!<eos> If you could drain the blood from their veins and put in water, there might be no war!<eos> You're talking old women's nonsense, sir, but I'm happy to see that there are still a few idealists left on Earth.<eos> I want you to go to Otradnoe.<eos> The marshal there, Count Rostov, has failed to produce half the men required of him.<eos> The army still needs to be maintained, even in this time of so called peace.<eos> Rostov needs someone to ginger him up a bit.<eos> Do you know the man, at all?<eos> - No, I don't.

No, no, let me - I can explain to her.<eos> It will be all right, I... I... I know it will.<eos> 'That ungrateful girl!<eos> ' After everything we've done for her!<eos> She's not ungrateful, Mama, you know that, really.<eos> None of this is her fault, she didn't know that Nikolai was going to speak out.<eos> Truly, she's never expected anything from him.<eos> And now, my son hates me!<eos> He doesn't!<eos> Oh, he doesn't!
You know what I think?<eos> I think she was helping you fast-track the technology, and she was training to go on the mission.<eos> This is absurd.<eos> When Joyce started showing interest in Norah, maybe you killed her to protect your little secret.<eos> Maybe one of my competitors is trying to set me up to take the blame here.<eos> Either way, you can direct all future questions to my lawyer, Clay Hibbard at Berkowitz and Etz.<eos> Great. We're so sorry to have bothered you.<eos> You know what, though, I think this is going to make an awesome story for the press, and the thing is, I love to be in the press.<eos> - It's true. She does.<eos> - I do. I really do.
Hurry up, we have a lot of work to do.<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> Call the police!<eos> Bonjour. "Ladies and gentlemen, campaigning for justice and human rights has brought me many beautiful friends."<eos> - And a few bodyguards.<eos> Let the psychologist do her evaluation and try again later, Louise.<eos> You said you were going to leave the police.<eos> Yeah, well, not so easy with six kids.<eos> I thought you didn't want Olivier's job.<eos> I didn't.
I wrote to Helene when I heard about your dad.<eos> Did you get a chance to talk to him before?<eos> He died when I was on the plane to see him.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's three sets to sign.<eos> One for you, one for me, and one for the lawyer.<eos> Need a pen?<eos> I signed already.<eos> Right. Always prepared.<eos> You doing any writing these days?
No, not like this, but we learned about fractions in school.<eos> You did?<eos> What fractions? 1/2 inch, 1/4 inch, 1/8 inch, 1/16 inch.<eos> Wow.<eos> You know, I gotta tell ya, you are much smarter than I was when I was your age.<eos> Maybe you needed better teachers.<eos> That could be.<eos> Can I do the drill now?<eos> - You promised.<eos> I did, didn't I?
You told me Randall is alive, and now I can be the one to end his life.<eos> You know, it lifted something from my heart.<eos> I began to feel I should stir up those feelings inside myself so I could feel that way again with my wife.<eos> So you had to stir yourself up with a whore before you could bring yourself to be with me?<eos> No, that's not what I was... you know I've been struggling for a long time.<eos> Struggling?<eos> Do you know what I've been struggling with?<eos> Trying to be patient with you and understanding, and all the while, I've been...<eos> I've been dealing with carrying our child.<eos> 'Course I do.
It's kind of like how I carry a little piece of onion around with me to elicit tears, you know, in case someone needs me to feel something about what they said or are doing, you know what I mean?<eos> Do you have an onion in your pocket right now?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm taking a vacation from myself.<eos> W-Was it a vacation from hearing, okay?<eos> 'Cause if the engine was going, we would hear a gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah, gah...<eos> Are you deaf, Charlie?<eos> I was like...<eos> (imitating motor boat)<eos> (all doing different engine imitations)
Uh, no, just...<eos> Just this water gun.<eos> That's not a water gun, man, that's a flare gun, which I'll hold onto for safekeeping.<eos> Uh...<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because I'm the most responsible person.<eos> Uh, guys, guys, I-I don't think any of us should have a gun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, one of us does, so... the end.
Jesus Christ, Jack.<eos> Uh, if I may.<eos> It stands to reason that if we threaten to defend this place, then we need to have a plan to follow through.<eos> If the bluff is called, then we... there is no bluff here.<eos> If we can discourage them from engaging, so much the better.<eos> If not, we fight to protect the island.<eos> With who in command of the fleet?<eos> No one's seen Flint in weeks.<eos> When he hears news of the invasion, he'll return.<eos> But if he doesn't?
Then you showed him incorrectly.<eos> It's a fucking lashing.<eos> I know how to tie it.<eos> If he tied it wrong, then you instructed him wrong.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> We persuaded them that they need us.<eos> We most certainly need them.<eos> Do you understand what I'm saying?<eos> Don't imagine that will be the last of those.<eos> Neither do I.
I never thought you were guilty.<eos> Have you told our daughter that?<eos> She should also know that I'm innocent of this, that I've changed.<eos> I'd like to tell her that myself.<eos> Look, I'll think about it.<eos> What's good for you could be really hard for her.<eos> Why didn't you have your defense team contact the police?<eos> I don't trust lawyers, and I don't trust the police.<eos> I only trust you.<eos> Or at least I did once.
- He's gonna lay low.<eos> - Best-case scenario.<eos> Worst-case scenario, he contacts Wozniak.<eos> He won't risk using his phone, which means he'll do it in person.<eos> If we surveil Wozniak and Saperstein shows up, we're not gonna have any choice but to intervene.<eos> Operation over.<eos> So, what, we go back to questioning Mom? No.<eos> We put out a federal warrant.<eos> His crew sees a Fed warrant, he might as well have a target on his back.<eos> He already does.
This isn't your fault.<eos> [sighs] It's... it's bad.<eos> Like, stitches bad.<eos> It's deeper than I thought.<eos> The guy had one of those monogrammed wedding rings.<eos> They're not gonna get away with this. That's exactly what they're gonna do.<eos> Manny, the cops in my mom's unit are like family to me. They're gonna make this right.<eos> You'll just have to trust me.<eos> You, I trust.<eos> The police, I don't.
Yes, but, as I was leaving there...<eos> I don't know how it happened.<eos> There was another man, the owner of the place...<eos> Please tell me he didn't see your face... Aafrin!<eos> Help me.<eos> Parsi, come with me.<eos> Jaldi!<eos> You can help me dig!<eos> He says he didn't deal with the man himself.<eos> So who did?
How about you take that offer and you shove it up your girlfriend-loving ass?<eos> Okay, I think we've had just about enough of this.<eos> Yes, um... you just lost wings.<eos> You just lost wings.<eos> Yeah, no, enough!<eos> We got it!<eos> You guys [Bleep] that up!<eos> You [Bleep] it up for me!<eos> Oh, you want to watch another episode?<eos> - Do you? Yes. - Yeah.
Fifth button from the right.<eos> You'll thank me later.<eos> There we go, girls.<eos> Okay. You all right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> That's it.<eos> Dude, I thought I was gonna make it.<eos> I know.<eos> You almost did, but...
Fuck, you're right. Good call.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know that out in California I disappointed you and that kills me.<eos> And I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> I threw you in the deep end out there.<eos> I should've never asked you to come.<eos> Honestly.<eos> No. No, you didn't do anything wrong.
Hey, Chub.<eos> This is Hap and Leonard.<eos> They're with us.<eos> - Hey. I ain't giving my share to no whales.<eos> I read "Moby Dick." I was rooting for Ahab.<eos> This is Chub.<eos> My real name's Charles.<eos> Everybody calls me Chub, you know, 'cause I'm fat.<eos> I didn't know Trudy had any African-American friends.<eos> She don't.
I want to marry you and take care of you for the rest of your life.<eos> I can't believe you cooled on me so quickly!<eos> And for Christ's sake with who?<eos> My nephew?<eos> He's a nice kid but where the hell's he going?<eos> You said it was possible yourself to have feelings for two people.<eos> You love him too?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Believe it.<eos> I do.
She came to my office.<eos> Shit.<eos> She didn't make it seem like such a... dead marriage.<eos> This time together, it's been the most incredible time of my life, but I've been talking with my wife, and I think it's time that you and I were honest with each other about what this really is.<eos> Wait, before you go any further,<eos> - I have something for you.<eos> - No, Liz, honey, please don't make this more difficult than it needs to be.<eos> Let's just...<eos> Please, just open it.<eos> Oh, you didn't.
You'd better give me the details.<eos> This is my client, David Alvarez.<eos> David, this is Detective Sergeant Tom Anderson and PC Dani Ferrington.<eos> Thanks very much for talking to us, David.<eos> I haven't yet.<eos> You understand that it's in connection with your conviction for murder?<eos> - Frazer's explained, yes.<eos> I wonder, do you recognise this man?<eos> For the purposes of the tape, I'm showing David a picture of a male individual.<eos> I do, yes.
"Green, David, yes."<eos> I think I know why that bowl was there.<eos> And it relates to the modus operandi of Paul Spector, Peter Baldwin.<eos> Are you sure he killed all those girls?<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Why are you protecting him, David?<eos> No-one has any idea how bad Gortnacull House was.<eos> Only those that were there.<eos> - I have some idea.<eos> - No, you fucking don't.
It's cute.<eos> It means they like you.<eos> You're one of the gang.<eos> Well, most of them won't even make eye contact with me.<eos> You know what that is?<eos> That's a sign of respect.<eos> At least it is with gorillas.<eos> Not helping.<eos> I think that somebody needs one of my special stories.<eos> I don't, I don't.
Give me that.<eos> What?<eos> It's loaded.<eos> Easy, easy. Give me it!<eos> How do you, like, put the bullets in it?<eos> What the fuck are you doing?<eos> Bradley-- no, I didn't.<eos> Shut up. You cannot play with this!<eos> Well, you shouldn't have left it out then.<eos> I didn't.
- Oh, god.<eos> Go for Baskets.<eos> Chip?<eos> Hi, darling, how are you?<eos> Don't call me that, okay?<eos> Look, I need $40 for HBO.<eos> D'accord ?<eos> Okay.<eos> Did you get that job?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Got jammed up by IA, on some petty bullshit.<eos> Had to resign.<eos> Went from working murders to working the gate for a bunch of rich people.<eos> Talk about losing what you got.<eos> - Thanks, Carl.<eos> - It's good to see you, Harry.<eos> Tony went to Las Vegas frequently for business.<eos> Did he always drive?<eos> He didn't like to fly.<eos> Oh, who does these days?
I thought he was going to propose to me.<eos> I always thought she was one of those people who wasn't interested in relationships.<eos> That's why you'd say that.<eos> And, finally that's how you get to and from the coral reef. Of course!<eos> - It's the riddle of the two barbers!<eos> - The what?<eos> The riddle of the two barbers!<eos> Understand that, Florence, and you understand who killed Dan Hagen.<eos> - You know who killed Dan Hagen?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Hey, I know you're upset, but we are gonna find Barry's mother, and Malory is gonna be okay.<eos> Now, I believe there was some mention of holes?<eos> [sighs] Phrasing, boom.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Shut up. And then talk again, but only to help me think of a way to kill Barry.<eos> Why don't we just find his mother?<eos> Why, just so she can bury him?<eos> Yeah, because trying to kill Barry has gone so well for you in the past.<eos> Yeah, Lana, but this time it's, um... [chuckles] Were you gonna say, "This time it's personal"?<eos> [chuckling] Yeah, but I didn't.
Are you trying to electrocute me?<eos> [gasps] What, no!<eos> [Krieger screams] [sighs] Apparently not.<eos> If I was electrocuted, how the hell were you gonna find your mother?<eos> So there were a couple of holes!<eos> [Pam] Wait, are we doing-<eos> - Jesus!<eos> You were willing to risk that? Oh, that is classic you!<eos> A mother! The one thing I've been searching for my entire goddamn life, and you take it for granted!<eos> Just like you do with everything else!
Nothing.<eos> You're going to have sex.<eos> With a... person?<eos> - What are you...<eos> - I'm gonna double the bet.<eos> - What bet?<eos> - No, shut up.<eos> I would think "person" was implied.<eos> Yeah, no, I just didn't wanna get in that head space and then, you know...<eos> No, I don't.
- Oh, no. Mine was just a Coke.<eos> - Times two.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm... regarding you.<eos> I feel like I'm being analysed.<eos> - Why the glasses? - Um...<eos> I like them.<eos> They totally work on you.<eos> But do you need them?<eos> - Yeah, the lenses don't do anything.
If I don't win this vote, Rate will challenge me to single combat.<eos> - You'll win the vote.<eos> - We can't know that.<eos> Rate.<eos> You're still here?<eos> You're free of your pledge to avenge Bayen's death.<eos> The Skinshifter is dead.<eos> But the man who forced it to do his bidding still lives.<eos> If I lose and I'm challenged, my brother thinks I'll step aside.<eos> Everybody does.
Nothing to say, guys, thank you.<eos> Miss Sloane, Miss Sloane!<eos> This is tight.<eos> You'd think they would choose a more appropriate venue.<eos> Well, turns out the Nationals had a home game.<eos> Good morning. I am Senator Ronald Sperling,<eos> Chair of this Hearing. Miss Sloane...<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, under pains and penalties of perjury?<eos> - I do.
So, Sloane and Co. versus Connors and who else?<eos> Mmm. O'Hara, Wickman, Moore, the God Squad.<eos> Ramirez, how many Tec-9s do you own again?<eos> Enough to defend my property.<eos> Plus two more to piss off the lefties.<eos> All right, Jane, contact Rodolfo Schmidt at Peterson Wyatt, and tell him there's a total of six coming over.<eos> I count five.<eos> Mathematician you are not.<eos> Who said I was coming?<eos> I did.
Morning.<eos> Please take a seat.<eos> We're not saying it can't be done.<eos> But it's risky.<eos> - We only get one shot.<eos> - Hey! Were you followed?<eos> Evidently.<eos> Let him in.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, upon pains and penalties of perjury?<eos> I do.
Big Sam.<eos> Little Sam.<eos> During the time that you worked alongside Miss Sloane, did you hold any discussions pertaining to the use of illegal surveillance techniques?<eos> So, how big is your organization?<eos> Well, there are six of us, four are out on assignment.<eos> - And you're ex...<eos> - NSA.<eos> Badgley is flip-flopping. But, quickest way to get him in line is to mine for sordid details, and then let him know we're in possession of them.<eos> Mr. Schmidt, did you?<eos> Yes, Senator, we did.
Make them a little bigger.<eos> I never thanked you. You saved my life.<eos> I wasn't there for you.<eos> I was there for the beast.<eos> Still... thank you.<eos> - May I ask you a question?<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> Are you Slean's woman?<eos> Only, I saw him leave your home this morning.<eos> You did?
So how you doing?<eos> - You look better.<eos> - Yeah, I'm a real fashion plate.<eos> - How about you?<eos> - What about me?<eos> I hear you went native while I was away. - Yeah.<eos> That's one way of putting it.<eos> - You got another way?<eos> Listen, Job, I tried to find you.<eos> We all did.
Thank you so much.<eos> Did you bring a new shirt for Blake?<eos> Shirt? In your message, you just said to come down to the school and hung up.<eos> It sounded like an emergency.<eos> Oh, um, it is.<eos> You see, what Blake's shirt says is inappropriate.<eos> What does it say?<eos> Well...<eos> You know what shirt he was wearing.<eos> I don't.
Just... He just has a different kind of strength is all.<eos> "A different kind of strength."<eos> And what kind of strength is that?<eos> He has the strength to believe in himself and believe in me.<eos> Susan, keep seeing him if you have to, live with him, I don't care, but do not marry him.<eos> I understand what you see in Edward.<eos> I get it.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, wait, I do.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Got no right?<eos> Rights, rights, rights.<eos> You and your goddamn rights.<eos> Speaking of rights, I just wanna let you know I'm recording this entire conversation.<eos> There.<eos> You clear?<eos> - Mmm-hmm. - All right, let's go, Tony.<eos> Now, we're going to a place you might remember, and you can help yourself out by telling me about it.<eos> But if you don't remember,<eos> Tony does, all right?
Cosmo, please.<eos> All you girls wear this?<eos> Yeah, it's pussy dust.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Say again?<eos> It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?
Sorry.<eos> Say again?<eos> It's pussy dust.<eos> Pussy dust.<eos> We get a private room, I'll show you my pussy dust.<eos> You like to party?<eos> Who doesn't?<eos> To happy endings.<eos> I love happy endings.<eos> Who doesn't?
Bye.<eos> Come, dog, let's go.<eos> Come, dog, let's go.<eos> - A business trip?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - To the printing office?<eos> - Yes.<eos> For two days?<eos> Call the newsroom.<eos> I did.
Are they slow? They're slow, aren't they?<eos> Yeah, they are.<eos> Well, they are a bit more tranquil.<eos> Pepa...<eos> Hey, all of that can be taken care of at the lab these days.<eos> We've run a story on that, really.<eos> Enjoy, my friend.<eos> So they've really run off.<eos> But we don't know where.<eos> We do.
Please, wait.<eos> Stop.<eos> Look.<eos> It was my idea.<eos> I thought we could sway you with the power of dance.<eos> You really think a dance is all it takes?<eos> Mom, I know that Schmidt is not what you imagined.<eos> Or what I imagined.<eos> I never thought I would fall for the slim-hipped ghost of Tom Cruise.<eos> None of us did.
He starts moving like this.<eos> And he marches to the last bit of dialogue.<eos> And it gets louder, and louder, and louder.<eos> If a director had come up with that, he should get an award.<eos> The actor came up with it, and he should get an award.<eos> It was chilling.<eos> The times when your dad was performing in New York, and then we would see each other very often, and that's when they started to go closer.<eos> And then we became his groupies.<eos> When he performed anyplace east of the Mississippi, we would fly out to be there.<eos> One summer, he did two plays.
I told him deodorant is fin-- He doesn't need cologne.<eos> He doesn't even shave.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's get dessert someplace else.<eos> Not now.<eos> You sure?<eos> Mm-hmm. If we don't go now, he'll get too far away.<eos> So, you did or you didn't see something?<eos> It's hard to say.<eos> Well, you either did or you didn't, Philip.
-Yeah. Are you actually believing this crap?<eos> I don't know, I mean...<eos> Do you remember when Will fell off his bike and broke his finger? He sounded a lot like that.<eos> Did you guys not see what I saw?<eos> They pulled Will's body out of the water.<eos> He's dead!<eos> Well, maybe it's his ghost. Maybe he's haunting us.<eos> -It's not his ghost.<eos> -So how do you know that?<eos> -I just do!
This isn't some kind of joke.<eos> Your mom was half frozen to death when I got here.<eos> Trembling, scared out of her mind.<eos> You come in here and you start feeding into her hallucinations or whatever the hell you want to call it, you're gonna push her right over the edge.<eos> You hear me?<eos> Look, I'm on your side.<eos> I'm here to help.<eos> I'm gonna make things better around here for all of us.<eos> Thank God you're here.<eos> Do me a favor.
-What?<eos> -Jump... or Toothless here gets an early trip to the dentist.<eos> Stop! No!<eos> I'll cut him right now!<eos> All right, just hold on! Hold on!<eos> Mike, don't do it. I don't need my baby teeth, Mike!<eos> Mike, seriously, don't!<eos> Mike, don't do it!<eos> Seriously, don't do it, man!<eos> Seriously, don't!
I'm sorry, Mom.<eos> What, you're sorry? You're... you're sorry?<eos> -That is not good enough, Jonathan.<eos> -I know. That's not even close.<eos> That's not even in the... in the ballpark.<eos> I wanted to tell you, I just--<eos> What if this thing took you, too?<eos> You risked your life... and Nancy's.<eos> I thought I could save Will...<eos> I still do.
What about tenure?<eos> Hell, in 24 hours, I'll be able to get any job I want.<eos> Fuck tenure.<eos> Professor, they're ready for you now.<eos> Hearing will come to order.<eos> Welcome, Professor.<eos> We thank you on behalf of the Committee for making time for this. I know it wasn't easy, and we appreciate that.<eos> Uh, please stand to be sworn in.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do. - Okay.
Yes.<eos> - How is he?<eos> - Angry.<eos> He's confused.<eos> What do I say to him?<eos> How can I explain all of this stuff that they say about me? Hmm?<eos> Vile things no child should ever have to hear about their father.<eos> And these men judging me, half of them are under an ethics cloud at this very minute. Money charges, sex charges.<eos> You don't see their lives going up in flames around them, do you?<eos> Do you?
Such a gentleman. [chuckles]<eos> I feel like a toothless Cinderella.<eos> Hello.<eos> Dr., uh, Sarkisian?<eos> Yes. Please, come in.<eos> I'm... it's fine.<eos> I really have no gag reflex.<eos> Okay. Open. What did you try to do?<eos> Crack a walnut?<eos> Your wife did some damage here.
Why you?<eos> I mean, are you cool?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> We are very, very cool.<eos> Get me out of here.<eos> Sorry to cut this short, but we've got to skeedads.<eos> Scrivener is waiting for us at Polo Bar, and it's Jade's favorite place to not eat.<eos> Redmond.<eos> - I want this book.<eos> - Everyone does.
You have no idea how much fun it is being DJ Tanner.<eos> Don't you ever want to have some kids and settle down?<eos> It sounds boring.<eos> To me.<eos> But it's perfect for you.<eos> I mean, you're an amazing mom, just like you're an amazing big sister.<eos> Well, not always.<eos> Do you remember the day you moved in here?<eos> I put that rope across the room to keep you out of my half.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Is there something I could help you with?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Raise.<eos> I'll call.<eos> You're calling with that shit?<eos> Dolores, why don't you play a hand?<eos> You're wasting your breath.<eos> Girl'sharboring a grudge.<eos> Idon'tblameyou , sweetheart.<eos> I did some ugly things to you both.
- Thwack!<eos> - I know! What a shot.<eos> Young Whelan.<eos> Great white God, no?<eos> You're cross.<eos> No... .. just curious.<eos> He let vanity get the better of him.<eos> He'd have been much better off letting me win.<eos> Oh, you'll win.<eos> You always do.
- Now, just swing and miss, do you hear?<eos> - He'd have been much better off letting me win.<eos> You always do.
Practise, practise!<eos> So, what about all your little hobbies, Sooni?<eos> Er, well, my sister used to play piano.<eos> And what about you, honey?<eos> Sooni's a very fine artist.<eos> What?<eos> In fact, I just happen to have, by chance, one or two things... here.<eos> Have a look.<eos> And how did you learn to draw like this, Sooni?<eos> I didn't.
She might even enjoy it.<eos> Old Manu, he's like a bear with a honeypot.<eos> You know, it was your sister he really wanted.<eos> So I gather.<eos> You see, this is how I like them, like this.<eos> What, when they're asleep?<eos> No, no, I meant when they're peaceful!<eos> You never wanted children of your own?<eos> Yeah, I wanted them.<eos> What wife doesn't?
Why do you think I asked you to go?<eos> I heard him.<eos> Heard who?<eos> Your dumb jock friend.<eos> He was laughing about how easy it would be for the star basketball player to take his nerdy next-door neighbor to bed that night.<eos> I heard him.<eos> And you just let him talk about me.<eos> You didn't say anything!<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
Our Rachel was not depressed.<eos> - Never heard that. - Look, I tried to... I tried to get kind of to the bottom of it and every time, she'd mis...<eos> she... she'd deflect and she wouldn't answer me.<eos> She was on, um...<eos> - Drugs? Was she?<eos> - No.<eos> - You guys were taking drugs?<eos> - No, we don't take drugs.<eos> It was medication, you know, like, antidepressants.<eos> Okay, you don't do drugs.
Fernando, I'm sorry, but this just doesn't feel right.<eos> I don't want our family on the racing circuit.<eos> Ramona is really happy here, and I love living with Stephanie and D.J. and her boys.<eos> I like my life the way it is and I'm not ready to change it.<eos> But what about us?<eos> Well, I love you, and I still want you in my life.<eos> Okay, people, what are we doing?<eos> We are well into overtime.<eos> Kimberly Louise Gibbler, do you promise to remain engaged to Fernando for as long as you feel like it?<eos> - I do!
I live right nearby.<eos> What time do you get off?<eos> Let's grab dinner.<eos> I work until 5pm.<eos> It's almost time.<eos> Did you wait?<eos> Not at all.<eos> - Shall we?<eos> - Okay.<eos> How about we do hot pot at my place?
You're both going to the station.<eos> And spend more time with that woman?<eos> We just have to last until the wedding is over.<eos> A couple for appearance's sake.<eos> Even though we couldn't be further from it.<eos> I'm sorry for all the trouble.<eos> Don't mention it.<eos> The two of us didn't work out but I know you'll be fine.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
Meredith, do whatever you can to get the database up and running.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> Our murder scene is much bloodier than the original cases.<eos> More spatter.<eos> Maybe St. Valentine drugged his male victims.<eos> That would explain the cleaner crime scenes.<eos> Except none of those men had drugs in their system.<eos> How in the world?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> But, maybe this guy does.
That tooth you stole from her is worth $5,000, making you a killer and a thief.<eos> She lent me that tooth.<eos> And as for your other unfounded accusation, I have an alibi for last night.<eos> I was with a writer, getting advice on self-publishing.<eos> Self-publishing what?<eos> I am writing the completely true story of the St. Valentine murders.<eos> And what's your version of the completely true story?<eos> The police... Got the wrong guy.<eos> And I assume you have proof to back that up.<eos> I do.
Except the blood evidence isn't.<eos> In the old crime scenes the blood was pooled.<eos> Too much spatter here.<eos> St. Valentine was surgical.<eos> New killer is no expert with the knife.<eos> There's something missing.<eos> Bruising around the neck.<eos> Right?<eos> Your guy doesn't have any.<eos> All our male victims did.
They're there forever.<eos> Do you know -- you know -- unh-unh, no, no.<eos> Do you know... How hard it was to get you into that school?<eos> I mean, do you -- do you understand how much it takes out of this house?<eos> ! And you get kicked out for doing something stupid? !<eos> I mean, what -- what were you doing? !<eos> I... I-I don't know.<eos> You do know.<eos> No.<eos> You do!
But she is... and will forever be... ours.<eos> Are you certain you would not like my company, Miss Jenny?<eos> Thanks for asking, but I think this is something I have to do by myself.<eos> Joe always said he wanted to spend more time up at his dad's cabin, and I thought I'd... spread his ashes in the lake.<eos> It's fitting.<eos> A serene resting place.<eos> You are coming back?<eos> Someone's got to keep you out of trouble.<eos> Tell my sister I said hello, and that I miss her.<eos> I always do.
- Yes, please.<eos> - Your husband makes good coffee.<eos> - Does he?<eos> Oh, yeah, I've got many skills<eos> Does making coffee require skills?<eos> I have to go.<eos> If there's anything you need, you just talk to him, OK? - OK.<eos> - Have a nice day.<eos> - Do you smoke?<eos> - No, I don't.

I'm the monster.<eos> I'm the one who had it all figured out at 25 and looked you in the eye and told you that your son was dead.<eos> Every scar on that kid's body...<eos> It wasn't the bogeyman.<eos> It was me.<eos> I'm the one who stopped looking and got promoted for it.<eos> So blame me.<eos> Hate me.<eos> Because I'm the one who didn't save your son.<eos> No. You didn't.
My daughter was dying, I prayed, uh...<eos> Not to God or the universe, but to Death.<eos> I offered a trade.<eos> Take me, leave my daughter.<eos> But she didn't wanna make the trade, so...<eos> So, who won that round?<eos> You or the porcelain?<eos> Porcelain. Porcelain's undefeated.<eos> I'm sorry about that, I thought everyone left.<eos> Yes, they did.
And she asked me who I was about to lose.<eos> And I told her.<eos> And she looked at me and she said,<eos> "Just be sure to notice<eos> "the collateral beauty."<eos> She said it so casually.<eos> In the next room, my six-year-old daughter was being taken off life support.<eos> And this woman says "collateral beauty."<eos> People don't know what to say in those moments.<eos> No, she did.
I saw you every day in her eyes, and I heard you in her voice when she laughed, and I felt you inside of me when she called me "Daddy."<eos> And you betrayed me!<eos> You broke my heart.<eos> I'm in all of it.<eos> I'm the darkness and the light, I'm the sunshine and the storm.<eos> Yes, you're right. I was there in her laugh, but I'm also here now in your pain.<eos> I'm the reason for everything.<eos> I am the only "why."<eos> Don't try and live without me, Howard.<eos> Please don't.
I don't understand.<eos> She's our daughter, Prairie, but she's never seen us before.<eos> Seven years ago, when she went missing... she was blind.<eos> - Is this it?<eos> - It is.<eos> You're home.<eos> All these cars...<eos> I guess someone's having a party.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> How did they...
We could do it again.<eos> We could get outta here.<eos> If I ever get out of here... I'd want to sing something... for my little brother.<eos> Keep going.<eos> I used to sing in church choir.<eos> I was pretty good.<eos> People tellin' me I should make a go of it, so...<eos> I took my little brother and we snuck off.<eos> It's not that we didn't love our family.<eos> We did.
Stop!<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Call the police.<eos> Give them that for access to the abandoned morgue.<eos> There are people there that need help.<eos> Sir?<eos> Sir? What do you mean "people"?<eos> I hope you know I've always thought of you, well, all of you as collaborators, but... you, most of all, I like to think of as a partner.<eos> Don't.

I'm sorry.<eos> It just... I don't know. You don't know what it's like.<eos> I was supposed to... my dad by the time he was my age, he had a master's degree and, like, five medals from the Navy.<eos> And I get coffee.<eos> You do more than that, Clark.<eos> Yeah, sometimes I get donuts.<eos> I just thought I had one thing that I was good at.<eos> My mom wants me out on the street.<eos> Just pay attention to what people say.<eos> Or what they don't.

There was a small containment leak, and the lab is currently under isolation.<eos> Well, how convenient.<eos> - Dr. Wilkes!<eos> - Uh, A-Agent Carter.<eos> Good... Good afternoon.<eos> What is this nonsense about a containment leak?<eos> Yes, th-there... there was a leak, and I'm afraid that the lab is...<eos> Under isolation.<eos> We heard. And when might the lab be safe enough to enter again?<eos> I don't...
Daniel, not only is Dr. Wilkes a good man, he is the centerpiece for the case we're building against Isodyne, Whitney Frost, and that Arena social cabal.<eos> So you need him.<eos> We need him.<eos> All right. What's the plan?<eos> Dr. Wilkes has designed a containment chamber to stabilize himself, but he needs a sample of zero matter.<eos> I intend to get that sample from Whitney Frost.<eos> The best chance that we have of getting close to Whitney without being detected is her husband's campaign fundraiser tomorrow night at the MacArthur Grand Hotel.<eos> Not an easy ticket to get.<eos> Howard Stark donates money to all the political candidates to ensure good favor with whomever wins, so Mr. Jarvis has two tickets secured.<eos> Of course he does.

She's 16 years old, Cash!<eos> She's a child!<eos> She's my child, all right? !<eos> You got no right to take her anywhere, least of all some bar where she's up onstage so she can...<eos> What?<eos> What, so she can thrive?<eos> So she can bloom?<eos> You don't even know her!<eos> I mean, do you even understand how talented she is?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Well, so did you.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> It was great to see you out there again.<eos> I miss performing.<eos> I just do.<eos> And I'm sorry about our conversation earlier.<eos> You know, I think as cool as it is to be on the cover of Businessweek, I've lost sight of why I wanted to work with these artists because I've lost sight of myself as an artist.<eos> And I have to admit, the tour for Layla is probably as important for me as it would have been for her.<eos> Want to do 10 dates for the hell of it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
A couple years ago, Alicia was killed in a shootout... Chicago P.D. and two armed gunmen.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Should have never happened.<eos> The cops screwed up, and three people died in the crossfire.<eos> There was an investigation, but in the end, Chicago P.D. stuck together.<eos> They blamed the ATF, and they blamed the state police, and they blamed the FBI.<eos> I just wanted somebody to stand up and tell the truth, like I had in the NFL.<eos> But they didn't.
Are you here for the cure?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, I was just leaving.<eos> No one ever leaves.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Why would anyone want to?<eos> Yeah, I see your point.<eos> Did you get what you came for?<eos> Well, I came to bring someone back to New York.<eos> So, yeah. I did.
So, we got a deal?<eos> How will you ride it?<eos> Maybe you could come along.<eos> I'm not supposed to.<eos> You always do what you're supposed to do?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Coming?<eos> Want a beer or something?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
Why aren't you at your post?<eos> Don't do this.<eos> 49 of the people I swore to protect died yesterday because I left.<eos> That's not your fault, Bellamy.<eos> Place the blame where it belongs, on the Ice Nation.<eos> Ice Nation didn't tell Gina to stay there.<eos> That was me.<eos> Given the information you had at the time, you made a reasonable choice.<eos> You were trying to save lives.<eos> But I didn't.
If there's a chance,<eos> I have to try and get him back.<eos> Going after Otan's not a good move.<eos> - John...<eos> - It's not a survivor's move.<eos> Then wait for me.<eos> I'll come back.<eos> In this world, when people leave, they don't come back.<eos> - I did.<eos> - Not for me, you didn't.
Against my advice, you made Skaikru the 13th clan.<eos> They rejected this, murdering hundreds of your people, and yet on the very field where they died, you decided to forgive the killers, but his provocation is proof.<eos> Blood must not have blood has failed.<eos> All that can stop this now is war.<eos> Clarke's opinion in this matter is not exactly unbiased.<eos> Titus is right.<eos> I would do anything to save my people.<eos> You know that, but I know them.<eos> Not everyone agrees with Chancellor Pike.<eos> Kane doesn't.
Wait. No.<eos> You just don't get it, Maddie.<eos> We need each other to stay sober.<eos> I have three years, and I need you to help me.<eos> That's how this house works.<eos> You can't just keep screwing up like this.<eos> It affects everyone.<eos> - You most of all.<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
Hey, sorry. We need that jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You shooting a scene with it or something, or...<eos> - No.<eos> - Well... can't I keep wearing it?<eos> Just let me wear it a little longer.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Everyone does.
- Um, I got some stuff on the DVR. - Mmm-hmm.<eos> So I'm gonna do that.<eos> I don't know, is it just me, or is it kind of lonely here?<eos> I think I just miss my friends, probably.<eos> Well, you can come to the thing tonight...<eos> - if you want to, or...<eos> - Oh, I didn't mean to invite myself.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> - No. No, no, you didn't.
No, I opened the window, a strong wind blew... - the place got cleaned up!<eos> - There is a maid to do all this...<eos> - She comes at noon<eos> - No women allowed in the kitchen<eos> This is my kitchen!<eos> Coffee<eos> Thank you!<eos> - And your coffee?<eos> - Tea. Already had two cups<eos> Bathroom done, jogging done, shower done...
Don't try anything new, son.<eos> I could've married a woman who didn't look exactly like me.<eos> But that would've been crazy.<eos> Hey, newbie.<eos> Nobody touches the new James Patterson until Solar reads it first.<eos> She wants you to pick it up.<eos> You scared, huh?<eos> Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa.<eos> Anybody else want a taste of Blue Thunder?<eos> Uh, I do. Yeah.
The girl at the coffee place that left?<eos> Came back.<eos> So you'll have that to get used to.<eos> I'm free?<eos> Oh, and just in time.<eos> Bart's claiming he's in another dimension, but I think he's just hiding in the closet.<eos> I had 90 days.<eos> I was promised 90 days.<eos> Now you have to give me more time.<eos> Oh, no you don't.
♪ What do you do with a drunken Homer? ♪<eos> ♪ Make him watch "Hunt for Red October" ♪<eos> ♪ Let him drive in a lunar rover ♪<eos> ♪ Tickle his nose with a... ♪<eos> Oh, hi, Marge.<eos> Homer, why were you fishing with Milhouse?<eos> Because for once, I'm with a kid who respects me.<eos> One who doesn't call me "Homer."<eos> I didn't know that bothered you.<eos> It does. A lot.
Cheese... lettuce...<eos> Ah... No! Mustard.<eos> Not too much.<eos> Hey!<eos> I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, Fishman!<eos> What?<eos> Well, who are you?<eos> You know who the fuck I am!<eos> And you know what you did!<eos> No, I don't.
Please, let me go!<eos> Let me out!<eos> - Let me out! - Heather!<eos> - Let me out!<eos> - Calm down!<eos> Calm down, we're the good guys, I promise you.<eos> - You have to trust us.<eos> Please. - "Trust you"?<eos> You kidnap me, and you hit me with a Winnebago...<eos> We did that for a reason!
Marjorie, there is the profession:<eos> Which are you saying I'm not?<eos> Tell me.<eos> A handy... man.<eos> Face it, homeboy, you ain't handy.<eos> Unless we need a big fat paperweight.<eos> I'll paperweight you!<eos> Homie, sweetie, replacing a tile is something you really need a professional for.<eos> I know how to replace a tile.<eos> All guys do.
We got what we came for.<eos> Nah, ain't worth the trouble, come on.<eos> Shit.<eos> No, don't!<eos> Oh, man.<eos> I threw up on my glasses.<eos> Hot damn.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> You could've died right there, you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you think I killed my son?<eos> !<eos> Drink.<eos> That guy Asher...<eos> I-I saw him this morning just walking in the bagel shop, buying a bagel and schmear like it's a normal day.<eos> He's a regular guy... nothing to see here.<eos> Trying to get a warrant to search his house.<eos> It's just not that easy.<eos> Do you think I'm lying?<eos> My wife does.
It can be intimidating and exhausting.<eos> Are you getting enough sleep?<eos> - I will make sure of it.<eos> - No, you know what's exhausting?<eos> Sleeping on a closet floor with an innocent child who was kept in a bunker for 10 years.<eos> Tell me what color you want me to wear, I'll wear it.<eos> She's a little on edge, but when the time comes, she will knock it out of the park.<eos> The time is tomorrow.<eos> If you want our endorsement and our money, we need to feel confident that she'll toe the party line.<eos> And right now, we don't.
- You sold me out!<eos> Tell me how.<eos> Dad said only as a last resort.<eos> Perizad sent me.<eos> We went to Princeton together.<eos> No.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I didn't have anywhere else to turn.<eos> I didn't know where else to turn.<eos> And now we do.
What's the radius on her powers?<eos> As far as she can go in one heartbeat.<eos> You're my new best friend.<eos> Here.<eos> Two figures, not moving but alive.<eos> Assuming Bobbi and Hunter.<eos> The other figures moving in the room... assume bad guys.<eos> One of them has powers, so best we avoid him.<eos> To that end...<eos> At S.H.I.E.L.D., we do better than duct tape.
May I?<eos> Feels real.<eos> Feels like the others.<eos> It's not the hand.<eos> It's me.<eos> Maybe you're not supposed to get over it.<eos> Some things you can't move past.<eos> They scar you, change you permanently.<eos> I don't know what happened there, on that planet.<eos> I do.
We had a tape.<eos> The tape's gone.<eos> It's over.<eos> Both of them?<eos> Both of them?<eos> What do you mean, "both of them"?<eos> Yeah, I made a copy of the tape.<eos> You taught me that.<eos> Always make a copy.<eos> Well, Mindhorn did.
Whereabouts at Pat's?<eos> In the garage.<eos> In the glove compartment of the Mindhorn car.<eos> - What have you got the gun for?<eos> - You know too much, Richard.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> I'm actually quite confused.<eos> You know that I killed Moncrief, right?<eos> I did not know that.<eos> Well, you do now.
Previously in "The 100"...<eos> Let the people know they have a new Commander.<eos> You don't have the Flame, Ontari.<eos> - No one knows that.<eos> - He does.
That was his name.<eos> He started to see his dead wife and kids in his dreams.<eos> They were all burned up from the bombs.<eos> He told the ship's doc that they looked like demons.<eos> After a while, he started to see them when he was awake, too.<eos> He would beg and beg and beg them to leave him alone, just to stop, right?<eos> They said the only way they'd leave him alone was if he did one thing.<eos> - Uh-huh. - What?<eos> Kill.<eos> Well, like demons do.

Why would you think you could do this?<eos> Because I saw it come out of the last Commander.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> So what do you do for her now?<eos> She's taken a liking to me.<eos> Who could blame her?<eos> Go.<eos> What?<eos> Heda requires your presence, Flamekeeper.<eos> Of course she does.
- Florida?<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Let go of me.<eos> Fuck.<eos> You don't even know where Derek is!<eos> Florida is eight million miles long!<eos> Too bad, Fiona, I'll find him!<eos> He wants to be a pilot, and I'm going to support him.<eos> - He doesn't love you.<eos> - Yes, he does.
How do you make it stop?<eos> You don't.<eos> You use it, channel it.<eos> Is that what you're doing?<eos> I can help.<eos> Was hoping you would.<eos> Oh, you're doing this wrong.<eos> I mean, you're looking in the wrong place.<eos> So, uh... this Blake guy... he has safehouses, what, all over?<eos> All agents do.
- Grandpa, I want to go home.<eos> - Come here, kid.<eos> Come here.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> How we gonna stop this?<eos> You have to create a coolant system that diffuses core radiation.<eos> The radiation is what's making it impossible for the pods to take it out.<eos> So we need to turn it back into a regular sharknado in order for your pods to work.<eos> But we don't have a body of water that's big enough.<eos> - And, dude, even if you did...
There's no way I'm outliving you.<eos> Hell, to be honest, I'm on borrowed time.<eos> I know that, baby.<eos> My sweet morning surprise is seeing your eyes open.<eos> [Both chuckle]<eos> - I'm sorry, Bow.<eos> - Oh.<eos> You know, I don't want to think about not being here for our kids.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> - I don't, either.

How are you so comfortable mocking me?<eos> Ariq plotted with our enemies, endangered the life of your heir.<eos> He deserved to die.<eos> Kaidu challenged your rule under the laws of our land.<eos> You cannot cut off his head.<eos> If you do, the legitimacy of your Khanate will forever be in question.<eos> Your people will wonder why the great Kublai Khan was so afraid to let their voices be heard.<eos> - I'm not afraid.<eos> - I know that.<eos> Once again, they do not.
Earning 1 million a fight is no cakewalk.<eos> Listen to me. I want to earn money... but I am no Superman.<eos> You cannot learn this in six weeks.<eos> No one can.<eos> - Sure, you can.<eos> - How?<eos> What's the most important thing in wrestling?<eos> Tackles.<eos> - You know tackles.<eos> - Did.
What?<eos> We can't leave and let an infected person escape!<eos> It's better than someone in here or out there getting killed.<eos> Okay. Coulson has a hidden elevator.<eos> It used to be an old underground exit.<eos> Maybe I can break through to get out.<eos> It's the only way we all live today.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Do we even know what we're supposed to be looking for?<eos> We do now.
-They're helping me.<eos> -Helping you do what?<eos> -To become famous, like Paris Hilton.<eos> Are you sick or what? Get dressed, Nicolás!<eos> We all know you're a dinosaur, and no matter how hard you try, you won't understand our stuff, so why don't you leave?<eos> Listen, Nicolás.<eos> It is you who don't understand.<eos> You haven't noticed that not even your mom loves you?<eos> -My mom loves me.<eos> -No, she doesn't!
I wanna see photos of your wee lad playing football in the park.<eos> Don't let me down.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What's up?<eos> This is just between us.<eos> It bothers me that Harry put you both in danger to catch Grey.<eos> Yeah but we caught him, didn't we?<eos> And there was no easy way anyone could have managed it.<eos> Also, you know as well what a proper male'd say?<eos> I do.
Sir, do you know this other man, this Mr. Hafeez?<eos> With regret, I do.<eos> He made friend of my son in Pune, Deccan College.<eos> His name is Imran Hafeez.<eos> So they did not travel to Oxford together?<eos> They did not.<eos> And this low opinion you suffer of Mr. Hafeez?<eos> He is a bad boy, no respect.<eos> Common, you understand.<eos> Oh, I do.
- Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...
If you want your brothers to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with you on the battlefield, you must stand with them off it.<eos> Your duty is to do as he asks.<eos> Gil, come here.<eos> I give you an order to train the people.<eos> Brinni, go with him.<eos> Lila.<eos> You speak for the people on this matter of the Huskarla training?<eos> - I do.<eos> - When do we start?<eos> - We don't.
They found you!<eos> We have to move the body!<eos> Shut up.<eos> We cannot move the body.<eos> There's drones.<eos> Stop it, Lolly.<eos> We cannot move it.<eos> If I told you I already moved it, would it calm you down?<eos> Maybe for a minute.<eos> Good, 'cause I did.
I need the blanket.<eos> What?<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> Why?<eos> You're not supposed to have it.<eos> Hand me the blanket, Miss.<eos> - Miss.<eos> - I'll die.<eos> You won't.<eos> No one does.
You must get better, Miss.<eos> They don't get easier, the treatments.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> They get worse.<eos> How?<eos> Just get better, eh?<eos> If I'm not truly ill, then how can I get better?<eos> If you're not ill, then what are you?<eos> You wouldn't believe me.<eos> Dr. Banning doesn't. My parents don't.
Said Dad was top of the bill.<eos> What's he going to do?<eos> What's he going to do to my father?<eos> Huh? What?<eos> - Wait!<eos> - Up!<eos> Stop!<eos> Up!<eos> GORDON". No, no!<eos> Don't, please.
Royal Bedlam Hospital.<eos> You're a patient here.<eos> Why?<eos> You threatened to assassinate the Queen.<eos> That's not possible.<eos> I would never.<eos> I love Her Majesty. And I... I would never harm anyone.<eos> I can't even imagine wanting to. Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.

Dracula can't walk by day, he doesn't cast a reflection, he can only be slain by a stake of consecrated ash wood.<eos> There's no sense to any of that.<eos> You may as well read the Bible for its history which, it goes without saying, is a fool's errand fit only for idiot children.<eos> Then how am I to find out who he is?<eos> Start with what he's given you.<eos> How has he presented himself?<eos> As a Fallen Angel, brother to Lucifer.<eos> Then take that to be truth.<eos> He was cast to Earth, to live among us, assuming different identities over the centuries to protect himself, unnoticed, until he strikes.<eos> And when he does?
Or "night work" as Miss Ives once put it.<eos> The night I met you, in fact.<eos> In the opium house.<eos> I remember.<eos> Given the chance to go back, would you do it differently?<eos> Walk the other way?<eos> Never meet me, or her?<eos> You've seen what I come from, that dragon that raised me, that land that reared me.<eos> I've known very little grace in my life.<eos> But I did with her.
It targeted Randall.<eos> That means somebody else is controlling the creature.<eos> Nevins.<eos> You said you searched him when he came in, and that he didn't have anything on him, especially not any kind of artifact.<eos> Nothing on him.<eos> The scarab isn't an artifact.<eos> Hi. Abbie, Abbie, Randall is dead.<eos> He's not controlling the Ghoul.<eos> You need to search Nevins.<eos> We did.
He never took a bribe.<eos> You could literally choke on his saintliness.<eos> Don't you move.<eos> You know, I actually think my father meant a lot more to you than you're willing to admit.<eos> And I know how that is, believe me.<eos> I mean, I spent my whole life pretending like his opinion didn't matter to me.<eos> And I have just been trying for so long to understand him.<eos> And, you know what, man, I think I finally do.<eos> You loved him, Atticus.<eos> We both did.
It's a start.<eos> The funds have already been transferred to your account in Geneva, and there is a plane standing by, waiting to take you wherever you choose.<eos> Oh, and I have a, uh, cash bonus for you.<eos> You have something for me.<eos> From the files of August Corbin.<eos> It's the exact coordinates of the nine sacred sites.<eos> Well, I can't tell you how much this means to us.<eos> Well, I don't really care.<eos> I just retired.<eos> Yes, Mr. Nevins you just did.
- I am helping you.<eos> Asa, we both know that you don't have a chance in hell of winning this thing, but losing and getting sent back down there?<eos> That's better than getting your throat cut in your sleep.<eos> Yeah?<eos> How the hell do you know?<eos> Thank you so much for joining me.<eos> I know how busy you must be.<eos> But we're gonna be working together on this eviction so I thought, well, let's break some bread.<eos> I've always been friends of y'all, you know that.<eos> Mm, I do.
Were you tearing Claudia Stilinski's wallpaper off her wall?<eos> No.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yes.<eos> She's worried about your mental health.<eos> I saw someone in the hallway.<eos> Someone Mrs. Stilinski didn't see.<eos> Well, if Claudia is not seeing ghosts, maybe it's because she's not a Banshee.<eos> I think he was trying to help me find something Stiles left behind. A relic.<eos> Did you?
You've always been there for me, and sometimes I forget just how much that means.<eos> Yep.<eos> You know, when Aiden died, there were days when I would sit in Jackson Square just daring myself to take this ring off, to give up, and I think part of me knew that I was never gonna be that happy ever again.<eos> If there was any way to bring Aiden back, I would, no matter what.<eos> If there's even chance for you to be with the guy you want to be with...<eos> You got to do it.<eos> I'm guessing you might be a little bit mad right now, but, trust me, you have nothing to worry about.<eos> I just want back what's mine, starting with my dark objects, and I figured I needed to get your attention.<eos> So do I have it?<eos> In point of fact, you do.
I could really use someone to talk to.<eos> I can't stay.<eos> I actually have somewhere to be.<eos> Oh! Great!<eos> Elliott told you?<eos> Yeah, well, they're my eggs and I made the decision so I need to do it.<eos> You can say whatever you wanna say.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just promise me you won't tell my mom.<eos> Emily, Elliott didn't.
- Did you set this all up?<eos> - Set all what up?<eos> - Me and Yvonne, this lunch.<eos> Maybe even her leaving her phone.<eos> Were we supposed to start fighting over Toby, hmm?<eos> Candidates' Daughters In Boyfriend Brawl.<eos> That isn't exactly explosive, political cannon fodder.<eos> And this isn't exactly the race for a senior class president.<eos> We don't do those kinds of things anymore.<eos> Do we, Spencer?
And who are we when we're with this other person?<eos> Are we really ready to be with another person before we truly know ourselves?<eos> My parents have answered these questions.<eos> They know exactly who they are and what they want.<eos> As individuals, each of them is loving, wise and sensitive.<eos> Together, they're more.<eos> They're inspiring.<eos> So here they are together again making a new commitment to be there for the best week ever and the worst week ever which sometimes happens in the same week.<eos> Byron, Ella do you promise to love, comfort and honor each other for the rest of your lives?<eos> We do.
I know.<eos> You did not have to do all this.<eos> I would've been fine just eating leftovers from the wedding.<eos> No, that's what an expense account is for.<eos> Taking my girlfriend out for a porcini omelet and billing it as lunch with a client.<eos> Well, it's funny because that may not be as big a lie as you think.<eos> Ezra... called Jillian to try and get me off the hook and... Ended up asking for me to be his co-author.<eos> I mean, obviously, I had no idea that he was gonna do that.<eos> He didn't even have any idea he was gonna do that...<eos> Oh, yeah, he did.
You needed proof about the Lotus,<eos> I needed proof about my dad.<eos> You set a trap for him as a test.<eos> Unrestricted access to Palmer Technologies' RD lab.<eos> He flunked with flying colors.<eos> I don't even know why I'm surprised.<eos> You're surprised because you're hoping that he's the parent you've always wanted him to be, the parent you deserve.<eos> In an extremely ironic role reversal, my mother was smarter than me.<eos> She said, "People don't change, no matter how much you want them to."<eos> Some people don't.
I...<eos> I can't let you owe Darhk a favor.<eos> And I can't let you die.<eos> I won't.<eos> That's not up to you.<eos> Look, I know how you ake everything on, everyone's problems.<eos> It's one of the things I love the most about you.<eos> But you can't fix his one, Ollie.<eos> I have to try.<eos> No, you don't.
Let's get the rest of the organization on the line.<eos> [Indistinct chatter]<eos> Darhk:<eos> Ladies and gentlemen,<eos> I am giddy to report that phase 4 is proceeding on schedule.<eos> There's still some concern about the Star City operation.<eos> Enlighten me.<eos> Phase 5 requires control over city hall, yet somehow we've found ourselves mired in a petty political race to see that happen.<eos> We didn't exactly plan on<eos> Oliver Queen, did we?
A life that hasn't had a chance to fully grow and live out its purpose in this world is a life that has been taken from this earth too soon.<eos> Oliver Queen, whom I'm told is practically family, will be delivering the eulogy.<eos> Mr. Queen.<eos> Mr. Queen, are you ready?<eos> Um, I could probably say a few words.<eos> Tommy Merlyn was--was one of the greatest people that I've ever known.<eos> He was--he was so much more than just... A billionaire playboy.<eos> I loved him.<eos> I loved him in-- in every way you could possibly love someone.<eos> And so did Oliver...
What about Darhk?<eos> Darhk's mine.<eos> What are you going to do now, Oliver?<eos> Stop the posturing.<eos> We both know that you can't do it.<eos> You spared the life of the man who killed your mother.<eos> And you killed a friend of mine.<eos> You killed tens of thousands of innocent people.<eos> With Slade Wilson, I had a choice.<eos> This time, I don't.
She calls herself a bitch.<eos> - She did.<eos> - So I can say that.<eos> Whoa, whoa.<eos> You hear that?<eos> I think we got another beatboxer in the office.<eos> Ders, go in there and then rap over his flow, and I'll FaceTime Pauly.<eos> - Yeah, I'll do that, yeah.<eos> - You got his number!<eos> Yes, I did.
My powers were given by the Kree... yours by S.H.I.E.L.D.<eos> They're the ones who made us.<eos> Why are you worried about S.H.I.E.L.D.?<eos> Because I'm curious if you can defeat what made you.<eos> The people at S.H.I.E.L.D. are my friends.<eos> Friends who will turn on you, who will try and sabotage the connection we share.<eos> Only because they don't understand, but they will if we can make them share our connection.<eos> You want to put your friends through the Kree experiment.<eos> Once Radcliffe has worked out the kinks, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I know...<eos> I know you need answers.<eos> I will do my best.<eos> Do you reject sin so as to live in the freedom of God's children?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you reject the glamour of evil and refuse to be mastered by sin?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you believe in God, the Father Almighty, - creator of heaven and Earth? - I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, his only son our Lord, who was born of the Virgin Mary, was crucified, died and was buried, rose from the dead and is now seated at the right hand of the Father?<eos> I do.
- Yeah, no, the other guy was different - skinny.<eos> Younger, maybe.<eos> - Come on!<eos> - One minute!<eos> This is very important, can you remember where the car was parked?<eos> - I mean exactly where it was? - Yes.<eos> Neighbour says the car's gone.<eos> Hasn't seen him in a couple of days.<eos> I'd say, DS Mclntosh, we have reason to believe Mr McDade's life may be in danger.<eos> Don't we?
In fact, the police want to know if you found anything that will help them find Payton.<eos> Well, he's not at his house.<eos> He's not at the beach house.<eos> - Did they check Edith's?<eos> - You think he's there?<eos> No, but maybe there's more there that could help us find him.<eos> - Alice?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - So, I found the forger.<eos> - You did?
How's that for luck?<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> That...<eos> That is awesome!<eos> Come on, man!<eos> That's crazy!<eos> - Awesome.<eos> - Well played, gentlemen.<eos> All right. Thank you.<eos> Well done, slick.
After you stole his counterfeiter.<eos> Apparently he wants to make a deal.<eos> Did he not tell you?<eos> Trouble in paradise already?<eos> What are you two doing here?<eos> - You texted me.<eos> - You invited me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Says so right here.<eos> No, he didn't.
Rhys got a little too empathetic with Morgan's Mommy issues.<eos> Does Sybil know?<eos> She'll find out.<eos> And then kill you.<eos> She won't have to.<eos> Morgan and Stephanie love each other, right?<eos> So all you have to do is convince them that marriage is still worth it.<eos> You still believe that, don't you?<eos> That part wasn't a lie.<eos> I do.
If Valentine started creating Shadowhunters or gained control of demons, it'd be like Beyonce riding on a dinosaur through Times Square.<eos> People would notice.<eos> But he can control demons.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> Mmm, paying off a few demons is easy, especially since they rarely survive long enough to collect.<eos> Still waiting on Valentine's thank-you card.<eos> Opening the gates of hell...<eos> that's a little more tricky.<eos> Valentine doesn't have the cards.<eos> I do.
Okay.<eos> I stayed out last night at Maureen's.<eos> I...<eos> I should have called. It slipped my mind.<eos> So, what are you gonna do?<eos> Ground me?<eos> Maureen called us this morning and she was very upset.<eos> Actually, Maureen called me... and she said that you were spazzing out, like more than normal.<eos> She said...<eos> She did what?
I don't send mail.<eos> Most of the mail I do get, I don't read.<eos> Never had an e-mail account.<eos> Warden can verify all this, if you don't believe me.<eos> Then, who is behind this?<eos> Who? I have no idea.<eos> But I might be able to help you figure out why.<eos> First question I'd ask is:<eos> Why did Verna McBride deserve to die?<eos> - She didn't.
I knew what you were going through and that you needed time to put yourself back together.<eos> D-Did I ruin this?<eos> I just think... we need to work on ourselves before we can talk about us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The stuff that I did, Lincoln,<eos> - I can't live with it.<eos> - I remember that pain ... sick with guilt, anger.<eos> I know why you went to face Hive alone.<eos> I tried. I tried to defeat him.<eos> - I did, but I ...
"I want your body" ?<eos> Who's it from ?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - We're off to a good start.<eos> What does it mean ?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Who sent it ?<eos> The number's not in my phone, I don't know.<eos> Must be the wrong number, I don't know.<eos> What do I do ?
Land of good common sense.<eos> I think Mr. Minnesota thinks he's too good for us.<eos> Are you too good for us, Minnesota?<eos> - No.<eos> - They can't hear you.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Kyle.<eos> Kyle. You think you're too good for us, Kyle?<eos> No, all right?<eos> No. Yes, you do.
Elijah thinks I should return home and heal him.<eos> Ease his pain.<eos> Klaus, you should go.<eos> As soon as these last few recover, I'll get them home, gather what I can and torch this place.<eos> No.<eos> Finn can purge it himself.<eos> He's earned the agony.<eos> Besides, you know how much I love burning things to the ground.<eos> Klaus, when you said that you wanted to work together for Hope's sake, I wanted to see what that looked like.<eos> And now I do.
We should get back to Kol and Marcel.<eos> There's something you need to know.<eos> I did everything you asked.<eos> I joined your stupid cult, I left my friends in the dust because that's what you needed!<eos> I fought for Hope!<eos> I kept Hayley breathing!<eos> I kept white oak from piercing your cold, black heart.<eos> I did everything!<eos> We know.<eos> No, you don't.

Some loophole to save you from your doom.<eos> Well, the thing is I don't believe in loopholes.<eos> My bite has no cure.<eos> Your sweet Camille is going to die.<eos> Mary doesn't want vampires near her cabin.<eos> It's probably better if you just stay here.<eos> She's aware that you and Hope are under my protection.<eos> Unfortunately for Mary, that didn't do much for her grandson, did it?<eos> You know I couldn't prevent that.<eos> Yes, I do.
'Cause you're gonna be Bren'in someday, too, after me.<eos> You lost it.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Lady Ray wants to see you whenever you're ready.<eos> All right, but I'm...<eos> I can't see you again, Asa.<eos> When you left, he was there, and he'll always be there.<eos> He doesn't run.<eos> You love him?<eos> I do.
You gotta believe me.<eos> You don't get to tell me what I gotta believe, you waste of flesh.<eos> The only thing I'm obliged to do is make sure you do no more harm to this family.<eos> You didn't know I had this, did you?<eos> I had to protect myself against your fa, didn't I?<eos> He died by his fire, and so will you.<eos> All right.<eos> All right. You're right, Ma.<eos> All right, I deserve to perish.<eos> I do. All right?
When you fell in the mine?<eos> See, whatever happens up there, we know about it one way or the other.<eos> The fate of Shay Mountain rests with us, Wade.<eos> You and me.<eos> So before you go and kill our paradise, that mountain wanted you to know what it felt like to die, and now you do.<eos> You think on that.<eos> My guy doesn't know anything. How 'bout yours?<eos> Well, he didn't kill Breece.<eos> - Well, how do you know?<eos> - 'Cause I do.
No!<eos> No! I did not!<eos> - Did you put a hand on him?<eos> ! - No, I was with Val!<eos> That was it, Dad!<eos> Nothing else!<eos> Nothing!<eos> Sexual assault is the hardest crime to prosecute.<eos> Most times, these investigations don't go forward.<eos> They just don't.
Walk with me.<eos> Tell me everything about her.<eos> So, Alec blew right by you and did what he wanted.<eos> I'd be angry, too.<eos> He took the only way I had to see my mother.<eos> Plus, he kept asking what Valentine's room looked like.<eos> He was interested in Valentine's style?<eos> Fascinating...<eos> No, he thought I might have seen something that could help us find him.<eos> And did you?
Alec gets that... unlike you.<eos> Alec, wait.<eos> If you hadn't gotten here in time, I...<eos> I'm just... I'm glad you and Jace are okay now.<eos> I didn't do this for Jace.<eos> Then I'm glad you did it for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You have an interesting effect on people, Clary Fray.<eos> He helped save Luke's life.<eos> You all did.
You'll put on the mask, and you'll be great.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, please take your seats.<eos> Welcome to the 8th World Mascot Association Championships.<eos> Please welcome our celebrity judges.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Hi! Good to see you all.<eos> -When did you last see him?<eos> -This morning at the hotel.<eos> After his Coco Pops, he said he was gonna go and take that ladder back and meet me here.<eos> Well, why didn't he do it yesterday?
What field?<eos> - Psychology.<eos> - She's a hard worker, my girl.<eos> - I can imagine.<eos> But she needs to pass her finals.<eos> Finals!<eos> It's good she's got a scholarship.<eos> It depends on her final grades.<eos> - Stuff like this happens.<eos> - Around here, it does!
Of course.<eos> Marius, I wanted to ask you something.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> The day Eliza was attacked, she said you were going to meet. Could you tell me what happened?<eos> I was supposed to be there at 7:50.<eos> But the bus didn't come. I mean, it was late.<eos> So when I arrived, Eliza wasn't there, where we usually meet.<eos> I see.<eos> Did you call her?<eos> Of course I did, only it didn't...
- I need to talk to you more than I've ever needed to talk to you in my life.<eos> I think I'm becoming a vampire.<eos> I was wondering when you'd come back.<eos> - I got the Cup.<eos> - I don't care about the Cup.<eos> It just looks like a wine glass.<eos> That wine glass saved your life.<eos> What if... what if I hadn't gotten the Cup out in time?<eos> - That demon...<eos> - But you did.
Have you heard from him?<eos> Or have you seen him?<eos> Should I be calling the police?<eos> No.<eos> No, don't do that. Um...<eos> If we needed to, I would have called Luke.<eos> I just want to know if he's all right.<eos> I saw him.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You did?
Or has that changed?<eos> Clary... you do not understand how this is.<eos> I can hear your heartbeat.<eos> I can smell the blood in your veins.<eos> And I want it.<eos> Simon, I would not blame you if you...<eos> What?<eos> Killed you?<eos> Don't you understand anything?<eos> No, I don't.
And a first.<eos> And a third, as well.<eos> Let it go.<eos> I'm sure you're wondering why I've asked you here.<eos> I assume it's because you want to use me as a pawn in your quiet battle with my mother and uncle.<eos> No. The people are upset.<eos> Our polls show a referendum to abolish would pass in a landslide.<eos> When it does, what change will you be able to affect then?<eos> Who said I wanted to change things?<eos> You did.
You're not here to rob me or dominate me or have sex with my mother?<eos> It wasn't initially why I took the job, no, but, of course, I understand if the requirements of the position change from time to time...<eos> Thank you.<eos> My father would have liked you, Mr. Hill.<eos> I would like to have known him.<eos> Maybe you quit the force for a wayward girl who needed your help.<eos> Did I guess it?<eos> - Her name is Sarah.<eos> - You have a daughter...<eos> I do now.
Mr. Castle, I've got a lot of puzzle pieces, but... trust me, this moves a lot smoother if you can tell me anything.<eos> It goes in and out.<eos> The fact that it fades...<eos> We took our blanket down to... our spot.<eos> She was by the carousel on the lawn...<eos> Then I heard her shout.<eos> Scream.<eos> It was a grown man.<eos> Who did you see?<eos> I didn't.
I do.<eos> You know he used to do hits for the Irish?<eos> One time, he shot an old lady because she saw his face.<eos> I guess he...<eos> He didn't tell you that, huh?<eos> The point is, you were safe, okay?<eos> I just... wanted you to know that.<eos> Guess I'm just supposed to take your word on that.<eos> Classy.<eos> - Nothing to do with my word, lady.
You did good.<eos> No, I just... I just did what you taught me, Stick.<eos> Matty, I'm... proud of you.<eos> Come on, old man.<eos> Let's get you out of here.<eos> Hello, boys.<eos> Do you remember when we met... you told me you'd never abandon me?<eos> It's funny.<eos> For the life of me... I can't remember being so naive I'd believe you.<eos> But I did.
Only that he's moving an unprecedented...<eos> Unprecedented volumes of uncut narcotics into Manhattan.<eos> - How's he doing it?<eos> - Well, that'd be the mystery.<eos> Okay, look, there's, uh... an unfinished highway on Long Island that was illegally used as a landing strip in the '90s.<eos> I mean, it would require payoffs, bribes...<eos> This guy's a ghost.<eos> He works alone or close to it. I just...<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
- It'll be okay, I...<eos> - The whole city is watching.<eos> If I screw up, I'd never work again.<eos> And, frankly, you'd probably never work again, either, by association, which...<eos> Stop, Foggy.<eos> Stop thinking about screwing up, about losing.<eos> You need to think about winning.<eos> Colonel Ray Schoonover, United States Marine Corps.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Oh, come on!<eos> She's here.<eos> I can sense her.<eos> You do realize that she can do me no harm?<eos> Clearly, you didn't get the memo.<eos> Ha! I could really get used to this.<eos> Stay on him, Ray.<eos> Stay on him.<eos> I had it covered.<eos> Sure, you did.
Nothing puts things in perspective more than seeing yourself become a ghost.<eos> You're not a ghost.<eos> You just need to come back to the world.<eos> And I will, after we take out Savage.<eos> I became the Atom to make the world a better place.<eos> And I'm pretty sure that saving it counts.<eos> I'm pretty sure it does too.<eos> See you soon.<eos> You know, I would've stayed for you.<eos> I do.
Oh, one more thing, don't forget to initiate the...<eos> The quantum attenuator once I lock on to the Vanishing Point.<eos> Right.<eos> I suppose it's also time to apologize for being an "insufferable know-it-all""<eos> You know, it used to drive me crazy, but I understand it's just your way of trying to look out for me.<eos> Oh, by the way, I'm going to be real pissed about this whole roofie thing,<eos> - but I do get over it.<eos> - Roofie thing?<eos> - I-I would never dream...<eos> - Yeah, you do...
Just turned 22.<eos> She went missing catering a Players' Club event.<eos> Players' Club?<eos> It's one of those skeezy pickup artist groups.<eos> You know, that teach geeks how to be sex gods.<eos> Got it.<eos> Lindsay was last seen talking to the lead scumbag.<eos> The founder, Carver Cruz.<eos> So he was interrogated?<eos> Yep, but his lawyer did all the talking.
You have no idea.<eos> Lovely.<eos> Thanks, girls.<eos> We'll have to try that later.<eos> Brian!<eos> Cheers!<eos> Maze!<eos> You haven't wished me happy birthday.<eos> The Devil doesn't have a birthday.<eos> Well, I do now.
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing's wrong.<eos> I realized a few things.<eos> As I said, we made a breakthrough.<eos> And I think, with that in mind, we should keep our relationship professional from now on.<eos> Oh. Are you sure?<eos> Very much so.<eos> Very well.<eos> If, uh... if you think it's best.<eos> I do.
He shot up your church, he's most likely running a drug ring behind your back, and, oh, yes, killed a man.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> Look, what if it's true?<eos> Then he needs me even more.<eos> How can you still have faith in this boy?<eos> God has faith in him.<eos> In all of us.<eos> Even in our darkest moments.<eos> Oh, you really believe that.<eos> I do.
- What can I get you? - Uh, yes.<eos> I'll have two Tropic Wonders and your face smashed into the ground.<eos> What?<eos> What the...?<eos> Lucifer, what are you doing?<eos> Stop!<eos> I believe they call this interrogating.<eos> Lucifer, stop!<eos> - He needs to tell me where my stuff is.<eos> - Don't.
Why don't we chat in my office, okay?<eos> Follow me.<eos> We heard that you control the docks, and if anything goes down, Los Diablos are in on it.<eos> Really? We're just a riding club, okay?<eos> Whose members have been arrested for guns, drugs, murder.<eos> A few bad apples shouldn't paint us all in a bad light, now should it, ma'am?<eos> But it does paint you as suspects.<eos> Hey, look, just because we have a reputation as outlaws doesn't mean we had anything to do with a murder.<eos> You like being considered a criminal, don't you?<eos> Yeah, you do.
Hello, Naomi.<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Heroin inspector.<eos> I'm afraid your spoons aren't up to standard, so...<eos> Hold on.<eos> We have some questions for you.<eos> NAOMI:<eos> You think I killed Javier?<eos> Well, I don't.<eos> But she definitely does.
And I already dropped some evidence, so it's...<eos> But I did this for you.<eos> Aren't you happy?<eos> Why would I be happy?<eos> I'm not evil.<eos> I punish evil.<eos> Yeah, but, but you're, you know...<eos> The devil, yes.<eos> And you think you know who that is, don't you?<eos> The whole world does.
- Like what?<eos> - Scared.<eos> - Of not getting enough retweets?<eos> - No...<eos> No, of losing you again.<eos> Hey, she did just fine for 25 years.<eos> Or, she was really good at pretending.<eos> I know you think your mom is this heartless, narcissistic monster...<eos> - Your words...<eos> - Some days, I do too.
Uh, at what point do I get to meet the wizard?<eos> See ya.<eos> Michigan, Lansing.<eos> Minnesota, Jackson.<eos> Missouri, Jefferson City.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> You forgot Mississippi.<eos> Mississippi.<eos> God damn.<eos> I always do that.
Give Gary the strength to trust in you in the dark as well as the light.<eos> And let him remember that Jesus was a prisoner too, and he will be with him always.<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I keep dreaming that I'm falling.<eos> And then... yank.<eos> It is going to be all right.<eos> You just have to tell the truth.<eos> They won't believe me.<eos> Nobody does.
Yeah, that's... that's right.<eos> Tamika was with him, and she was concerned about getting arrested.<eos> Daniel was already in jail and the cops were looking for Emile.<eos> And he and Tamika were arguing.<eos> About what?<eos> Your head ain't right.<eos> I threw it after we crossed the overpass.<eos> E, we wasn't even on the freeway.<eos> How do you know where I threw it, huh?<eos> E. Huh? You don't.
First of all, there's you.<eos> And my mom.<eos> Hey, who's got some pot?<eos> 'Cause Bonnie Wheeler needs a dealer.<eos> Well, one female role model is good enough.<eos> I threw my back out at Pilates.<eos> It's killing me.<eos> I was trying to get extra bendy for my honeymoon with Brad, if you know what I mean. Huh?<eos> Well, you got a guy 15 years younger than you, so I think Bendy Bonnie knows what she's doing.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Okay, you know way too much about me.<eos> Oh, that's the tip of the iceberg.<eos> No, you're freaking me out.<eos> I'm onto you!<eos> Now will you sleep in my college dorm?<eos> No!<eos> I like you.<eos> I like me, too.<eos> You just said, "I like me, too."<eos> No, I didn't. No. Yes, you did.
Oh, that's the tip of the iceberg.<eos> No, you're freaking me out.<eos> I'm onto you!<eos> Now will you sleep in my college dorm?<eos> No!<eos> I like you.<eos> I like me, too.<eos> You just said, "I like me, too."<eos> No, I didn't. No. Yes, you did.<eos> You totally did.
Oh, okay.<eos> I'm cutting you from Jugglers with Vertigo.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> You know, you're not what we call a pure talent.<eos> You're not a virtuoso.<eos> You're the kind of player who should write for himself.<eos> And if I don't get it, then I'll move to Naperville with you guys.<eos> Miles.<eos> No.<eos> You don't...
Yeah.<eos> Wow, you're taking everything, huh?<eos> Well,<eos> I'm gonna be back in a month, to see my dad.<eos> And my mom said you can visit whenever you want.<eos> You know, school's not gonna be the same without you.<eos> Nothing is.<eos> Jude. I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I want to stay.<eos> Really, I do.
Keep your voice down.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> It's my fault, um...<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, I'm gonna go, okay?<eos> Um, I'll be back Friday.<eos> - This can't be my life.<eos> Jules, it can't be.<eos> - I wanted to see the fireworks.<eos> I really did.
- Yeah, bullshit. You did it to get even.<eos> - Oh, fuáá you!<eos> Somebody help him.<eos> - If I had the exact spell wording one hour ago,--<eos> - There's got to be something.<eos> - You have any idea where he is right now?<eos> Why would you do this?<eos> - She didn't.<eos> Not by herself.<eos> Did you?
I just-- I'm calling to see if you're up yet.<eos> And, uh, there's just one little thing that I want to talk to you about.<eos> Don't worry, it's not about the dishwasher.<eos> Jefferson Starship, Sol!<eos> -What are you doing here?<eos> -I'm sorry. I was just... resting here.<eos> All night.<eos> You told him.<eos> I did.<eos> I did.
I do not have the moral high ground.<eos> Well, then why are you acting like you do?<eos> Because he knew I could forgive almost anything but this, with her.<eos> Oh, get over yourself.<eos> Sol did a stupid emotional Sol thing.<eos> And married me 24 hours after he did the stupid thing he did!<eos> He wanted to tell you, but I wouldn't let him.<eos> Not before you went into surgery.<eos> -So you knew?<eos> -Yes. Everyone did.
I mean, animals are getting smarter every day.<eos> Instead of hunting, wouldn't you like to go to a high school talent show?<eos> -I need a happy distraction.<eos> -From what?<eos> Frankie, why did you really come out here today?<eos> I dig you.<eos> I mean, that's before I found out you were Ted Nugent.<eos> So what is it?<eos> You don't want to hear about the Chilean soap opera that's become my life.<eos> Actually, I do.
- He married Miss Utah, and then I went on to medical school.<eos> Brains and beauty.<eos> I'll be damned.<eos> When I get off here tonight, drinks for the good doctor are on me.<eos> All right.<eos> There you go, guys.<eos> But-- But why not stay a pilot?<eos> Because I almost died.<eos> I was-- I was flying over Lake Placid one day, and my co-pilot dared me to walk out on the wing and jump.<eos> So I did.
but the data in "The Method" comes from...?<eos> My studies at the University of Michigan and my time spent at the Masters and Johnson clinic.<eos> And yet your face draws a complete blank, which is funny because I'm usually so good with faces, technically.<eos> I knew it.<eos> You're Virginia Johnson.<eos> Your book was right there in the gift store.<eos> Oh, my God, will you sign?<eos> Hello?<eos> Libby, I know you probably don't want to talk to me right now. You're right.<eos> I don't.
Maybe there's something to it.<eos> Or maybe you've just spent too much time on that ship.<eos> It's made you paranoid.<eos> If anything, it's woken me up.<eos> Made me realize the dangers of being too trusting.<eos> I brought you something.<eos> When you came out of stasis, you had no memory, but you knew the right thing to do because you are who you are.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> You manage to crack the file? Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
"First you dig deeper, then you get a warrant."<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> The killer's sitting poolside in Acapulco drinking dollar beers and knockoff pain killers.<eos> Liz Kenyon... a piano prodigy from the time she was 6 years old.<eos> What she was 12, this man...<eos> Emile Sayles, enters her life and takes control not just of her piano but nearly everything she does.<eos> He pushed her until she broke.<eos> And you think she's still under his influence?<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> I do.
Oh, I'm just trying to picture you two down here hanging over waffles in the morning.<eos> -It's been a process.<eos> -Oh, I thought you hated Grace.<eos> Hate's such a strong word.<eos> It's the word you used when you said things like, "I hate Grace."<eos> Thank God I could vent about her on our walks.<eos> You know, she vented about you, too, sunshine.<eos> -When?<eos> -On my walks I took with her right after the walks I took with you.<eos> -You did a lot of walking.
I thought this might come up.<eos> Do you know what used to be in all of Say Grace's products?<eos> -Parabens.<eos> -Ha, parabens, even worse.<eos> I should do my one-woman show on parabens for you some time,<eos> "Para-Been To Hell And Back."<eos> You have. Twice.<eos> Two times.<eos> Don't change the subject, Grace.<eos> I didn't.
I'll show myself out.<eos> That's exactly the steel goddamn stomach I was talking about.<eos> Was it Pete Dreyer?<eos> Congressman Dreyer's been a mentor for years.<eos> - He had no right to tell you.<eos> - He had every right. If a member of the House Intelligence Committee chooses to share information with me, he's at liberty to do so.<eos> Our conversation was in confidence.<eos> I don't feel comfortable with this.<eos> The Congressman is just as frustrated as you are, and he spoke to me because he wants to help.<eos> And so do I, General.
This... this blindfold...<eos> Oh, god.<eos> What?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's him.<eos> Hello.<eos> Hello?<eos> The family was told not to contact anyone.<eos> They didn't.<eos> The cruise line did.
My friend, you like?<eos> I can make you a deal.<eos> I can... I can make you an offer.<eos> See, Hassan, this type of behavior... this suggests to us something we call<eos> "avoidance and transference".<eos> It's what makes me think you're lying.<eos> Of course he's lying.<eos> Look at him.<eos> If you hadn't seen the Carsons, why didn't you just tell us?<eos> I did!

Where are they?<eos> No, they went out through the back.<eos> You see?<eos> They left.<eos> The last I saw, they were talking to another man.<eos> Describe him.<eos> The vendor said he was a clean-cut man in his 20s or 30s wearing Western clothes.<eos> Body language and linguistics make me think he was telling the truth, but he was holding something back.<eos> - I don't know what.<eos> - I do.
_<eos> He's just a boy!<eos> Do you feel powerful when you hit a child?<eos> You're no man, you coward!<eos> Peter!<eos> No.<eos> Stop it!<eos> You're hurting him!<eos> Please! Please!<eos> Don't!
Just someone I knew before I met you.<eos> Do you remember when I first met you on the porch at the motel that night?<eos> Yeah, my heart stopped, mostly because I thought you were gonna arrest me.<eos> No, I missed that opportunity.<eos> Well, I guess... I guess it all turned out okay in the end, huh?<eos> All things considered?<eos> You think so?<eos> You think it's all gonna be okay?<eos> Kind of.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What is this for?<eos> A token of my respect and gratitude.<eos> You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
Hey. Where's your birth mother?<eos> Do you remember the first time you asked me that?<eos> You were 8.<eos> You told me she was stuck in Cuba.<eos> I said, "She sent me over on a life raft "but got caught before she could climb in behind me."<eos> And as soon as she could escape, she'd be coming for you.<eos> I actually believed it.<eos> Hmm, so did I.<eos> I wanted so bad to believe that there was someone out there who loved me.<eos> And now someone actually does.
You won't need it.<eos> The doctor pays me 25 grand I bring her people to operate on.<eos> It's not easy, you know, finding people like that somebody that nobody's gonna miss when they disappear.<eos> You don't want the cops coming around and asking questions, right?<eos> One more time.<eos> Why me?<eos> This is how it came down.<eos> The doctor wanted you.<eos> But to tell you the truth, I had it in for you, too.<eos> You did a job in Vegas a year ago.
The stakes are just too high now.<eos> If the thief gets to the last remaining gem before we do, not only do we lose the gem, we lose the key to finding the EMP weapon.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> We're out?<eos> As in fired?<eos> Like, permanently?<eos> Girls, you know I love you. But it's out of my hands now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish things had turned out differently.<eos> We all do.
I'm gonna miss that free pizza, though.<eos> You guys okay?<eos> Yeah. Hey, Barbie.<eos> I can't believe I keep messing that up.<eos> Again.<eos> Every time I get to this one part, I just... Ugh.<eos> I don't know how to explain it.<eos> You get in your head?<eos> Get scared you're gonna mess up and let everyone down?<eos> Then you do? Yeah.
Mitchell, you can't talk and feel the burn at the same time.<eos> Donkey-kick like you mean it, Jennifer.<eos> I'm just curious, because this tape was on its way to goodwill, and all of a sudden, you pulled it out of your back pocket.<eos> I put on a couple of extra pounds, and Jane got me out of a similar situation in the '80s.<eos> Please tell me you were wearing leg warmers.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> We got this, girls.<eos> March it out.<eos> Well, for whatever it's worth, dad, I didn't notice.<eos> Gloria did.
All right, guys.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> One, two...<eos> Come visit us!<eos> Make good choices!<eos> [ Sighs ] In many ways, you fetched me!<eos> [ Cheers and applause ]<eos> [ Clears throat ] You caught me.<eos> I know they're not coming back.<eos> Mm, sometimes they do.
Guys, seriously?<eos> I said walk.<eos> No worries, just some innocent kids running around a creepy hospital.<eos> I got this one.<eos> You seem super busy.<eos> Need some help?<eos> Too little, too late, Jake Riley.<eos> Officer.<eos> Your friend Major Carnahan said you might be of some assistance.<eos> Oh, did he?
So, don't give me some crap about helping me.<eos> OK. I'm the only one that can help myself.<eos> That's not true.<eos> No, Paul, Paul.<eos> Hey. No, no, look at me, look at me.<eos> Put the gun down, man.<eos> OK, you don't want to do that.<eos> - It's good.<eos> - You're right.<eos> I don't.
We know you're in there!<eos> This location was a bad idea!<eos> It would have been fine if things had gone to plan.<eos> Lose your gloves.<eos> You touched him, with your gloves.<eos> Thought this thing was only transmitted through fluids.<eos> You cage us like animals and leave us out here to die!<eos> - Open up! - Today... We're getting out!<eos> Your job was to find a spot where they would not see us taking the child.<eos> And they didn't!
How long does it take to hunt down a walkie?<eos> Maybe if you pace faster, it'll speed things up.<eos> What is your issue with me, Major?<eos> I have given you nothing but opportunities.<eos> To do what, exactly?<eos> Be your puppet?<eos> To smile and lie for you?<eos> Information needs to be managed in a crisis.<eos> I thought you understood that.<eos> Oh, I do.
You think he'll help us?<eos> Well, when I knew him, he liked to go to battle against the big guns.<eos> And he is one now.<eos> So I guess we'll see.<eos> Is the medicine working?<eos> We won't know for a little while.<eos> Do you think it will?<eos> I want it to.<eos> Do you have a mom?<eos> I did.
Quentin?<eos> No!<eos> They said you wanted to talk.<eos> Uh, are you mad at me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not mad at you, Thomas.<eos> Not even a little bit.<eos> No one is, not even Quentin.<eos> I didn't mean to make Mary sick.<eos> Of course you didn't.
Yes.<eos> I want to hold her granddaughter.<eos> We can do that.<eos> Have you chosen a name?<eos> It's Leanne.<eos> It's safe, Jake.<eos> I know what you're gonna say, but... but I miss Lex.<eos> I have to try.<eos> So please don't judge me.<eos> I don't.
He can literally be in three places at once.<eos> - Can't be. - Can.<eos> Thanks to time travel, and it's because of time travel that I know you're here.<eos> You're out here tonight, because you have felt an immanent presence of... something.<eos> - A... a meteorite?<eos> - And I'm going to give you a use for it which will give us the power to rewrite destiny itself.<eos> Change the course of the entire world.<eos> So if Savage plans on blowing up the world three times,<eos> - how do we stop him?<eos> - We don't.
If this is about Lee...<eos> Not everything is about you, Ellie.<eos> Just wait till the others get back.<eos> We'll talk about it then.<eos> I'm not going to fight about fighting.<eos> People shouldn't kill each other.<eos> That's what I believe.<eos> That's what I'll always believe.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - We all do.
Unlock the door, unlock this door!<eos> Don't you dare take off with my daughter!<eos> No! What do you think you're doing?<eos> No, get out of the car, get out of the car!<eos> I'm gonna beat you so bad!<eos> You will never see my daughter again!<eos> Psycho.<eos> I cannot believe this...<eos> when'd you learn how to drive?<eos> I didn't.
- committing a crime.<eos> - No, we're talking about justice!<eos> G.<eos> G!<eos> You know, for everything that they did to us.<eos> The past is the past, Gil.<eos> I'm about to get married.<eos> Do you think I'm gonna throw that away just so you can...?<eos> - Did you forget what happened?<eos> - Yes, I did!
Oh, no.<eos> Some of you know this man, as well as his fellow rebels.<eos> You also know their whereabouts yet you have chosen to remain silent.<eos> We need to know where they are.<eos> If we do not have the information by tomorrow morning, this man will be punished.<eos> We say nothing.<eos> We can't leave Kevin at their mercy.<eos> - Yes we can.<eos> - We need to save him.<eos> No we don't.
But don't worry...<eos> I took his keys, so he's not driving anywhere.<eos> I don't care about Spence!<eos> Do you know where Ben is?<eos> Uh, I'll check downstairs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, thank you, Peter.<eos> This was a lovely evening.<eos> I'm glad you liked it.<eos> I really did.
I'm his mother and his roommate.<eos> Isn't that fun?<eos> This is a great building.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I always thought I would sell and buy a house with a yard when I had kids, but...<eos> - No kids?<eos> - Nope, you?<eos> Me what?<eos> Do you have any kids?<eos> Well, of... of course I do.
Well, that had all of the subtlety of a Kardashian wedding.<eos> If you want to call it a night, that is fine by me.<eos> Nonsense.<eos> As long as Frances is picking up the tab, we may as well enjoy it.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Yes, could I get a glass of the '98 Lafitte Rothschild Bordeaux?<eos> Make it a bottle.<eos> Let me ask you something, are you happy doing this job?<eos> We all have to work.<eos> Do we, though?
You get a chance to hug your family, you take it.<eos> Oh, I hadn't thought of that.<eos> You may never see them again... especially if you're not off book by Friday.<eos> Oh! Well, hello there.<eos> You must be the haircut guy.<eos> Come on in.<eos> So, who referred you to me?<eos> I...really must thank them.<eos> Oh. I don't need a haircut.<eos> You don't?
I cannot believe that Adrian changed all the locks and Carmen saw no reason to mention it.<eos> Well, at least I'm getting a nice tour of the grounds.<eos> It's like the Palace of Versailles... only bigger.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Damn it.<eos> Oh, why am I not allowed one single victory?<eos> I am always the one to suffer.<eos> [Sighs] There is no God.<eos> Did you just...
You know, you never told me what happened between you and Genevieve.<eos> It's... complicated.<eos> I can handle complicated.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I lost a baby because of her.<eos> How does that happen?<eos> She made a bad choice, and I blame her.<eos> Don't look at me like that.<eos> I know it doesn't make sense, and I know you won't understand.<eos> Actually, I do.
Oh, dear God!<eos> Frances!<eos> Oh, no. [Chuckles nervously] I found this sexy maid costume from Halloween.<eos> I thought I'd come by and surprise you.<eos> Oh! I didn't realize you'd be together.<eos> I am so embarrassed. [Chuckles]<eos> Wait.<eos> You don't have to go.<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
I got a callback.<eos> You did?<eos> Yep... for the part based on you.<eos> They want me to wear something sexy for the next round.<eos> Well, congratulations.<eos> I thought you'd be jealous.<eos> I am.<eos> But I'm also happy for you.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Listen, if you're harboring him here...<eos> I'm not.<eos> I swear.<eos> We didn't even know he was missing.<eos> - Is all this really necessary?<eos> - Yes. Spence Westmore is an escaped murderer.<eos> We have orders.<eos> Now, if he resists capture, we will shoot to kill.<eos> I understand why Peter wouldn't talk to me after what I did.<eos> You didn't do anything.
It's...<eos> She's just above, the bedroom on the right in the front of the house.<eos> Hello, Ms. Blum.<eos> My name is Lily.<eos> I'm going to be staying with you from now on.<eos> I hope that's all right.<eos> No snooping, you.<eos> Polly!<eos> I am very seldom required to wear white by my employers.<eos> But, anyway, I always do.
Only her name.<eos> But the rest of what is coming cannot be seen even as I look right at it.<eos> It is a terrible thing to look at oneself and all the while see nothing.<eos> Hello?<eos> I had arrived in the first few days of August, hired to care for Ms. Blum.<eos> The winter of that year proved to be unseasonably warm, and by February, all that was left of the snow on the sides of the highways had turned mostly black.<eos> It rained too much in the spring, and the fruit in the trees hung heavy at the ends of bent branches.<eos> The sun in the summer months was unreasonably hot and stung my bare shoulders whenever I let it.<eos> I remember thinking that it felt like fall would never come.<eos> And then it never did.
Thank you, Theo.<eos> Theo.<eos> I've finished my first major work.<eos> Excellent!<eos> Is it a work of genius?<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> - Who wants to hear my writing?<eos> - No, too rude.<eos> - I'd rather die.<eos> - Good, Theo does.
Strike while the iron's hot.<eos> There's no time like the present.<eos> What is this, platitudes day?<eos> So, why are you and Nancy rowing?<eos> - I'm glad you brought that up.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> Nancy feels, and, well, I agree with her, but less so...<eos> - Oh, bloody hell, Larry.<eos> - OK, we by which I mean Nancy, but a proportion of me want to find our own place to live.<eos> No, you don't.
- Everything's changing, anyway,<eos> - with you marrying Sven.<eos> - But the important things, th-th-the being together, that's not changing.<eos> And you can't afford to move out, Larry, you're broke.<eos> So are you.<eos> I...<eos> I can write for money.<eos> I'm sad, too.<eos> Erm... just in case this helps at all, we think it's fine if Larry leaves.<eos> - We do. - Yeah.
No, you've got me there.<eos> No.<eos> What is homosexuality?<eos> Where have you been all your life?<eos> - Outside, mainly, shooting.<eos> - Is it sex in a home?<eos> - No.<eos> - I give up, then.<eos> - I think I might know.<eos> - Of course you do.
We could weaponize the goggles...<eos> Not enough time to weaponize, Ramon.<eos> Okay, what if we modify the pulse rifle to emit a low-level EMF?<eos> We don't have the equipment to modify the pulse rifles now.<eos> Then we do another snatch and grab mission.<eos> By the time we scale those cliffs, Zoom could already...<eos> I need a minute.<eos> Barry, I know you... can't give up your speed to that monster, but...<eos> I also know that I want to get my son back, and I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
Get to work.<eos> Wells.<eos> One day...<eos> I'm gonna knock that smug expression clean off your face.<eos> So this was your plan all along, huh?<eos> Ever since the skies parted and showed me another world... with another speedster.<eos> Once I saw you, I came here, figured out what I had to do.<eos> How are you still alive?<eos> We saw you die.<eos> You did.
And India might have to settle for a silver.<eos> "You have to play with the opponent's mind."<eos> "Fake a move, but make another."<eos> And a fantastic move by Geeta.<eos> Will time be on her side?<eos> It's a gold for Geeta!<eos> Geeta has achieved the impossible!<eos> She is the first ever female Indian wrestler, to win gold at the Commonwealth Games!<eos> Who would have thought that a girl from a small village in India, is capable of leaving her mark on the whole world!<eos> Well done, Geeta!
I didn't even know what I could do yet, but I knew that I could save you.<eos> And I did.<eos> And now, I don't know.<eos> I just don't even know who I am anymore or who I'm supposed to be.<eos> Barry, you're supposed to be the same guy that you've always been.<eos> Suit or no suit... that guy is a hero.<eos> That's everything you asked for.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> Knowing you've destroyed so many people's lives?<eos> I don't.
Well, do it somewhere else.<eos> I want my house back.<eos> You still want to pretend like everything's fine?<eos> Empathy doesn't even cover it.<eos> This mother's a miracle.<eos> I mean, the amount of will it takes to forgive your son's killer?<eos> Who does that?<eos> Not to say that I can't see the other side of it.<eos> How do you know he won't go out and kill again?<eos> You don't.
Oh, and a bottle of Riesling.<eos> Your best.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I feel like the devil.<eos> - Did it work?<eos> - She's thinking about it.<eos> She'll say yes.<eos> My point is I might have to go to church so I can atone for my sins.<eos> Mm. You have to believe in God for that.<eos> Or maybe you do now.
You ever been to Fishtown?<eos> Wait.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> What's better than sex?<eos> You think I'm a gigolo?<eos> I know what you are.<eos> So, you want to change your life, or are you happy just to stay Annalise Keating's bitch?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> We found her.<eos> Well, Oliver did.
Right. Yeah, yeah. We'll just pretend like it never happened.<eos> - Because it didn't.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> 'Cause, I mean, if, like, Bonnie found out...<eos> She won't, and neither will Caleb, who hopefully isn't dead right now.<eos> Yeah, I do just... I want to say this.<eos> It was bad morally.<eos> I feel that.<eos> I just don't want you to think that I didn't... enjoy it.<eos> Because I did... uh, thoroughly.
Nixon?<eos> Nixon was a far more effective president.<eos> The only reason people glorify Kennedy is because he got shot.<eos> You've got that going for you, too, now, don't you?<eos> And you've got your search engine and all your little home videos.<eos> See, if people want a piece of you, you give it to them, right?<eos> Ch. Is that what people want?<eos> A piece of you?<eos> Do YOU play video games?<eos> No. My kids do.
- No, it's not fair to Dennis.<eos> - To Dennis? - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. To Dennis. I'm sorry.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> Chip, are you in there?<eos> Of course you're not in there.<eos> Why the fuck am I yelling?<eos> This is stupid.<eos> - How'd it go?<eos> It didn't. Why?
Because I needed to be with you.<eos> I'm not a good person.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I'm not worth it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Please. I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.
I'm not a good person.<eos> You're in pain.<eos> I'm not worth it.<eos> I disagree.<eos> Please. I'm trying to give you the out.<eos> Please just take the out.<eos> I don't want an out.<eos> - I know who you are.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Where did they take her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> Let me go!<eos> Where are you taking her?<eos> That was the last time I saw her.<eos> They sent me on assignment that night.<eos> It wasn't till I got to Bangkok that I heard rumors about them trying to turn a Hexenbiest into a warrior.<eos> But nobody told me if it worked.<eos> It did.
It's Trubel.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I saw Meisner.<eos> What did he say?<eos> You're gonna see Juliette today.<eos> He'll contact you later.<eos> It'll be a public place.<eos> Are you sure that's a good idea?<eos> I have to deal with this.<eos> Yeah, you do.
No, no, no. No. Guard!<eos> Guard! Guard!<eos> You should've listened to Billie.<eos> She told you what would happen.<eos> Guard! Guard!<eos> Guard!<eos> Guard! Soon as we showed them the mark, Billie's parents backed off.<eos> Told us to get off their property.<eos> They said Billie was living a life of courage and conviction.<eos> - You do a background on the parents?
Not at first.<eos> I didn't believe in anything.<eos> What about now?<eos> I found a reason to live.<eos> Do you feel remorse for anything you've done?<eos> You mean what she did.<eos> What you did.<eos> You still think you're talking to Juliette.<eos> I don't know who I'm talking to.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's r-r-r-ridiculous.<eos> And we got a late start because of Roxie! - I was at a funeral.<eos> - Well,<eos> I'm already speaking at this volume so I can't stop now!<eos> Hey, Ana, you're acting crazy. - And you.<eos> - What?<eos> Your car smells like a pee wee soccer team threw up in there.<eos> I cleaned it three times.<eos> You said it didn't smell anymore.<eos> Well, it does.
I can't believe Cooler told you.<eos> Look, man, I think he was worried that you might overreact.<eos> He finger-raped Pinot!<eos> Like that.<eos> I had to take the dogs to the V.D. clinic.<eos> Dude, I'm not sure you can get V.D. off a finger.<eos> The Venice Dog Clinic.<eos> Look, man, at least he had the guts to come and tell you.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't...
- That was the deal.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> Look... maybe it's time for you to make a fresh start.<eos> Look for a new challenge.<eos> Sometimes it's good to let go of the past.<eos> Yeah, but does this need to be one of those "sometimes"?<eos> Are you ever going to sign our divorce?<eos> I think it might help untangle you, set you free.<eos> - I did.
My advisor was a retired federal judge...<eos> Alan Handler.<eos> A real liberal lion.<eos> He and some other fellows had this rotating poker game.<eos> Now, you would think that these brilliant legal minds would know how to bluff.<eos> But I could spot their tells from my apartment.<eos> A nervous knee, a finger twitch.<eos> Handler didn't blink... just like you.<eos> It's true the world doesn't know where my son is, but neither do you.<eos> Only I do.
As difficult as it is to believe, Stefanie, I didn't do anything.<eos> - Do you think I would really do something and keep myself someplace where I'm so unwelcome?<eos> You're always welcome here, Mom, but your opinions, however...<eos> I'll just keep my opinions to myself and we'll... push the old RV out of your driveway and into the streets someplace.<eos> Actually, we're gonna have to borrow their electricity, if you ladies don't mind.<eos> - Oh. - Of course we don't mind.<eos> I'll pay for the utility bill this month.<eos> - Not necessary, Mother.<eos> - Oh, I insist.<eos> Of course you do.
AJ? Are... are you okay?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> I... I just wanted to call and tell you I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry I left without saying goodbye.<eos> - You doing okay?<eos> - Yeah, I'm just worried about you.<eos> Is... is Mike really pissed at me?<eos> No, he's just sad, I think.<eos> He misses you.<eos> We all do.
I mean, they are a legitimate business.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> What, employing trafficked women?<eos> No, that's...<eos> The people who own it probably don't even realise they are trafficked, they probably were perfectly nice to her.<eos> The problem is...<eos> How can they not know?<eos> They don't pay 'em!<eos> No, they do!<eos> The biscuit factory does.
Did he say that? Did he actually say that?<eos> That he still thinks about me?<eos> Every day.<eos> Yes.<eos> He said it.<eos> Yeah, but in a bad way.<eos> No!<eos> He talked about bringing you milk.<eos> And how he upset you by bringing his friend and how much he wishes he hadn't done that now because that seemed to spoil everything.<eos> Did he...?
I've only got limited access to the server.<eos> Let me try this.<eos> Hello! What do you open.<eos> Booyah.<eos> Booyah what?<eos> These are the first few photos clues texted this morning.<eos> Yeah. And we already had those photos.<eos> Can we trace the numbers receiving the texts?<eos> Negative.<eos> Or the number doing the texting?
You're half right.<eos> Someone was sabotaging his business.<eos> But it wasn't me.<eos> It was Peter himself.<eos> How exactly does that work?<eos> Mrs. Van Owen makes the tea party look liberal.<eos> Once she found out Peter was in a three-way marriage... That was it.<eos> So you went behind his back and offered to take over.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> Well you certainly didn't do anything right.
Yours, too, Clary.<eos> You would have done it.<eos> I'm sorry we lost the case.<eos> Yeah... but at least we lost it with style.<eos> Jace and Clary are back.<eos> They gave the Cup to Lydia.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> You were right, they came back.<eos> You knew!<eos> Oh, I didn't actually.
Your father.<eos> The Underworld?<eos> I'll only be gone for a day.<eos> Just long enough to retrieve Hook.<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> Why you?<eos> Because, Belle, I'm the only who's been there.<eos> Plus, my blood can summon the ferry.<eos> Just come back to me.<eos> I always do.
Emma... the spell's not steady. He can't hear you.<eos> Just tell us where you are.<eos> Something's happening.<eos> It's not holding.<eos> Talk to us.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> He doesn't know we came for him.<eos> We... he doesn't know we're here.<eos> He doesn't know that I care.<eos> Yes, he does.
That's it?<eos> You already did what we needed.<eos> We?<eos> You're helping her?<eos> You're the easiest way to get to Stefan.<eos> Don't take it personally.<eos> "Don't take it personally"?<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I, and a girlfriend and a life.<eos> And now I don't.
I think so.<eos> Yes, here it is.<eos> Why?<eos> I was just thinking i would pay him a visit.<eos> Well, suit yourself.<eos> Yes.<eos> A nice little visit.<eos> It's the least I can do for one of my fans.<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
We know a great deal about you, Max.<eos> I'm Michelle Roland, and this is my husband, Michael.<eos> Roland?<eos> You're Nicky and Tara's parents?<eos> And we want to thank you so much for taking such good care of them.<eos> Well, this is great.<eos> They're going to be so excited.<eos> They've been looking for you everywhere.<eos> But how do we get out of here?<eos> We don't, Max.
"Were"?<eos> What happened to them?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess they're gone.<eos> This time forever.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.<eos> I do believe in ghosts.<eos> I do.
Yeah, no big.<eos> Don't call me again.<eos> - Hey, you can't take that.<eos> - Let her have it.<eos> - No, we need it.<eos> - So does she.<eos> If I had more,<eos> I'd give you more.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But you don't.
She's a vampire.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> I knew you'd come back for your sire, just like you did before.<eos> We're forever linked, you and I.<eos> How do you know I don't want to stake you?<eos> Do you?<eos> No.<eos> I do.
I have some very interesting stuff for fungi of the toenail.<eos> 99% of these mentors lead to a lifetime of soporific bourgeois magic hell.<eos> You're, uh...<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm going to get a drink.<eos> - Is Genji your aunt?<eos> - Oh, hey, Alice.<eos> - Is that Genji?<eos> - Do you guys know her?<eos> Everyone does.
It's chaining you to a rock.<eos> You are free.<eos> More free than almost anyone in this universe or any other.<eos> Ah.<eos> Where you think you're sticking that?<eos> They told you not to travel, eh?<eos> Too unpredictable, too hard to control...<eos> Yeah, because it is.<eos> I got zero control.<eos> I don't...
It seems you have already decided what she is.<eos> It's the money, isn't it?<eos> You thought, "Here's some poor rich woman I can play."<eos> You leap to so many conclusions, it would be dishonourable<eos> - for me to contradict you.<eos> - Because you cannot contradict me.<eos> - You are a fraud. - Meriwether?<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> She knows about me.<eos> She does.
There's gonna be hundreds of people there, and if we can slip in under cover of the party...<eos> We can steal the seeds.<eos> Look, we could wind up in prison, or worse.<eos> You want to go home, I get it.<eos> Special Agent Harris.<eos> Mrs. Finch.<eos> May I come in?<eos> Thank you for having me over.<eos> I assume if you knew anything about Brian's whereabouts, you would tell us, yes?<eos> I don't.
You can understand how this doesn't exactly fill me with confidence.<eos> I'm sorry. Mr. Finch, are you formally acting as Rachel's legal counsel?<eos> Because I'm not here to interrogate anyone.<eos> I'm simply trying to get to the bottom of what happened in that apartment.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not formally representing my daughter.<eos> I wanted to speak candidly with you, Agent Harris, because frankly...<eos> I'm pissed.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
You know, you haven't been sleeping, babe.<eos> Maybe we should go to a doctor, get some pills.<eos> I can't take those, Dylan.<eos> Well, you gotta do something.<eos> I just keep thinking... You know, what if I'm next?<eos> This all happened when we came back to town.<eos> - You don't think I might be a target?<eos> - Listen, this guy's crazy.<eos> I don't know what to think.<eos> Nobody does, okay?
If they're wrong, then, The Executioner's still out there.<eos> You would not recognize Gail if you passed her on the street.<eos> Big as a house.<eos> A retired teacher, never married.<eos> Well, guess she loved food too much to ever let a man in her life.<eos> Wow. Who's next?<eos> What about that boy that you had a crush on in Bio?<eos> She can't hear you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
You really have to get over something that happened decades ago.<eos> I'm not the one looking for absolution.<eos> Too bad that hunk of cement didn't fall a little more to the left.<eos> Hello. Welcome.<eos> - Feel free to look around.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> If you have any questions...<eos> Ask you?<eos> You're Sarah, I take it.<eos> How did you...?
I'm not making this any better, am I?<eos> - Okay, I'm gonna stop. - Okay.<eos> - Moving on. - Yeah.<eos> Tom Winston.<eos> Well, he's crazy enough, but he's behind bars.<eos> So what?<eos> Serial killers have groupies.<eos> What if Tom is the brains, and he's got someone on the outside being the brawn?<eos> Yeah, but he doesn't see anyone. I mean, except for me.<eos> Yes, he does.
Should've been from you but instead,<eos> Konstantin told me.<eos> Konstantin, who's apparently my uncle.<eos> He's the one that told me the truth, just before he tried to kill me.<eos> I'm sorry, Elena.<eos> I'm not done.<eos> My mother.<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Yes.<eos> In a way, I did.
We don't use no "C" -words, sweetheart. This is a Blood house.<eos> Are you sure you're bool, man?<eos> I've just been messing up. I started this business that didn't pan out. Now I'm watching all my friends just pass me by.<eos> It's just been frustrating on all levels.<eos> A nigga's stuck?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, you ain't working, you ain't providing.<eos> Shit, you probably ain't even putting it down.<eos> - Man, hey. - Nah, nah, no disrespect.<eos> You love your girl and shit, right?<eos> Yeah, I do, I just...
Didn't you already do this?<eos> I don't think I'm quite explaining this properly.<eos> You see, Isabella is actually being held hostage.<eos> We know.<eos> In Valencia.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Again, that's Madalena.<eos> Isabella is in Hortensia.<eos> I don't think he knows what he's talking about.<eos> No, I do.
Come on.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> Please. Please.<eos> If I wake you up, and you walk out of here, this thing... this thing could kill you.<eos> And if you don't, I'm already dead, so...<eos> Can we page him again, please?<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Something came up.<eos> Dr. Harris, I was starting to worry you weren't gonna show up.<eos> Ready to do this?
Thank you.<eos> Okay, I know you're all been waiting to hear from this guy, but before I hand over the microphone I just want to say a few words.<eos> Now, for years I've worked alongside council member Andrew Dixon, but in the last few months, I really got to know Andrew Dixon the man.<eos> I've witnessed firsthand his integrity under pressure, his passion for our city, and the sacrifices that he's made to make this city a better place for all of us.<eos> And I can tell you that his insight into the real issues that we face, his ability to find common-sense solutions, and his unwavering commitment to address the needs of every single community in this city is exactly what Portland needs.<eos> Ladies and gentleman, it's my pleasure to introduce to you my good friend, and Portland's next mayor, Andrew Dixon.<eos> Thank you, Sean.<eos> And thank all of you for coming out today.<eos> Did you know that between 1524 and 1526 over 100,000 German peasants were killed in these woods?<eos> I did not.
But on a personal note-- please.<eos> I just wanna say, when I think of the horrifying nightmare that Elizabeth Keen has endured-- branded a traitor, hunted as a fugitive by the very law enforcement agency she swore an oath to serve...<eos> Well, there are no words.<eos> There is no apology I can give on behalf of the government that could ever be sufficient.<eos> I only hope that she can take some solace in the knowledge that in the end, the system worked.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I know who you really are, Raymond.<eos> Who you are to her.<eos> And I know why you did this.<eos> Does she?
How random is this, running into you?<eos> It's really random.<eos> - Who's this Bit-O-Honey?<eos> - Hi. What's up?<eos> - I'm Brad. I'm the brother. - Mmm!<eos> - Yeah. - Hey, I want to show you something.<eos> I got this thing on my shoulder, might be a mole.<eos> Could be a... wax burn from some degrading role play.<eos> You know what I'm talking about, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Kelly... Uh, just-just get up, Hank, it's over.<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> Thank you. I love you.<eos> Hooray.<eos> - I heard about last night.<eos> - How?<eos> I work in the art world as a part-time full-nude model.<eos> I am such an idiot.<eos> I don't know why I had to go so big with my apology.<eos> I do.
I've behaved like one, but never thought I was.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Of course I have.<eos> - Are you a shit? - Yes.<eos> I don't know how to lie.<eos> That's unfortunate.<eos> You're in the land of lies.<eos> You're really good at it.<eos> Do I know how to be a real shit?<eos> I do.
They were arrested last week.<eos> You can look inside, if you want.<eos> It's all I took.<eos> Mrs. El-Mansour had promised it to me.<eos> Toilets.<eos> Never again.<eos> I could have been caught.<eos> I did it.<eos> - You saw them?<eos> - I did.
Call the medevac.<eos> Oh, I wish I wasn't permanently exhausted.<eos> You've just been through a war, Dana.<eos> It's gonna take some time for things to feel normal again.<eos> Scary thing is, I don't even remember what normal feels like.<eos> We're gonna get you through this, you need to trust me.<eos> Even when you're in the dark.<eos> Even when you're falling.<eos> I trust you, sweetheart.<eos> I do.
Is there any news?<eos> The fact that they're on the hunt for his sister means he's still alive.<eos> And if he's still alive, there's hope.<eos> One good thing about the Maria Ostrov situation is it throws a lot of cards up in the air.<eos> Dmitri could be one of 'em.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I appreciate your condolences, Madam Secretary.<eos> But they won't bring back President Ostrova, nor will they alter the fact that Ukraine abrogated the ceasefire by assassinating her.<eos> President Ostrova wanted peace.<eos> She didn't.
He told me she's a crazy drunk liar in need of psychiatric help.<eos> Of course he did.<eos> You believe him?<eos> No. Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.
You believe him?<eos> No. Not for a second.<eos> How long until imaging comes back?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Then that's how long we have to get her away from him.<eos> Keep them here, no matter what.<eos> Okay, do you remember before, when I told you that I wanted to die?<eos> I did, for a very, very long time.<eos> Yeah. I don't know how you got through that.<eos> I didn't.
I make my own jewelry.<eos> I run an animal rescue.<eos> I'm from the Parks Department.<eos> The PTA bought a booth.<eos> I was just with my friends.<eos> Did you see this boy?<eos> Not at my booth.<eos> That poor family.<eos> I saw that kid.<eos> I do, uh, custom cabinetry.
R-Right.<eos> You take y-your nice emotions, and then you just shove them down.<eos> You just stuff 'em, stuff 'em, stuff 'em, like... like, uh, like, you know how you pack a suitcase, how you roll everything up really tight, and then you put it exactly where it's supposed to be, and then you sit on top of it and then you do the zipper?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Exactly like that.<eos> And then what?<eos> And then you pour alcohol all over it.<eos> That can't possibly work.<eos> No, it does!
What is the precedent on this?<eos> If it is Ivy Moxam, well...<eos> There's no precedent to follow.<eos> There's never been a case of an escaped captive in the UK.<eos> Plenty enough bones, just nothing living or breathing.<eos> Don't worry, it's just to record what happens in here.<eos> And these four cameras... they do the same.<eos> We call this an ABE interview.<eos> My family, I want to see them.<eos> Of course you do.
Only until I didn't...<eos> I didn't need it.<eos> The fish was the nicest.<eos> It tasted of something more than usual.<eos> What was the usual?<eos> Tinned food.<eos> I ate from the can.<eos> No spoon.<eos> We had to earn the right to a spoon.<eos> I never did.
I was born in Glasgow.<eos> Are your family still there?<eos> You said ask away.<eos> My dad is.<eos> And your mum?<eos> You don't know where your mum lives?<eos> OK, I get the point.<eos> It's not...<eos> Why don't you know where she is?<eos> I just don't.
I'm Detective Sergeant Lisa Merchant, joined by...<eos> Detective Inspector Elliott Carne.<eos> We're here to interview Ivy Moxam on suspicion of perverting the course of justice.<eos> You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something which you later rely on in court.<eos> Anything you say may be given in evidence.<eos> You have the right to legal representation.<eos> Would you like to take that right?<eos> I don't know what I'm supposed to have done.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> No, I don't.
I was gonna say less on heroin.<eos> I haven't done smack in 30 years.<eos> I even quit Honey Smacks 'cause I thought it might tempt me.<eos> Ruby, just putting it out there... if you need someone to warm up the crowd, I was in my high school's jazz choir.<eos> I sang "God Bless the Child."<eos> Well, God bless the children that had to listen to that.<eos> Well, it's gonna be very interesting, Earl.<eos> I don't think I ever remember you playing sober.<eos> You always said the junk gave you the funk.<eos> - I did? - Mm-hmm.
Guilty.<eos> Guilty. Make no mistake about it,<eos> Mike Ross thinks he's better than you.<eos> He thinks he doesn't have to play by the same rules, but we know he does because, ladies and gentleman of the jury,<eos> Mike Ross... Is a fraud.<eos> Mike. She was good, Harvey.<eos> - Yeah, so were you.<eos> - You were great.<eos> She was better. Everything she said was true and the jury knows it.<eos> No they don't.
Because you promised me that you would have faith in yourself.<eos> And you didn't.<eos> You remember me?<eos> How could I not?<eos> I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.<eos> Then I'll get right to it.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> You got a truck needs fixing?<eos> I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.<eos> No, you don't.
And you didn't.<eos> You remember me?<eos> How could I not?<eos> I listened to you for the better part of two weeks.<eos> Then I'll get right to it.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> You got a truck needs fixing?<eos> I want to know what that verdict was gonna be.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yeah, I do.
The manhunt exposed your relationship to Liz.<eos> Yes, people are talking about whether I'm cooperating with the FBI.<eos> Rumors are swirling.<eos> And whoever he is, he was sent to determine whether those rumors are true.<eos> Has our friend arrived yet?<eos> [ Telephone rings in distance ]<eos> I'm excited to speak with him.<eos> I know you're there, and I know you told them about Shell Island.<eos> But since you're not me, you didn't receive an invitation, and you don't know when and where the meeting is taking place.<eos> I do.
USMC.<eos> Served with distinction in Afghanistan-- a bronze star and a purple heart.<eos> And now kidnapping.<eos> Why?<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Habeas corpus isn't on the menu today, not when we're dealing with matters of national security.<eos> So, who do you work for?<eos> The men who took you were former Marines.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I-I didn't.
They get it from somewhere.<eos> - You think he's sick.<eos> You think I'm sick. - They get this from somewhere.<eos> You wanna blame someone?<eos> You wanna blame people?<eos> You have pushed those kids away from you.<eos> This last year, you have shoved them away.<eos> - But work was always first for you.<eos> - I know I've had my crap, too.<eos> - You do... for a living, but that always
Are you thinking about coming back to Leyland?<eos> No.<eos> Everything going all right for you at Marshall?<eos> Yeah, it's all right.<eos> It's just, I heard they were having a lot of problems at that school.<eos> Some kind of a riot or something?<eos> Taylor, I have to say, I thought you got a...<eos> I thought the school could have handled your situation better.<eos> I see things here sometimes, and... I just think you deserve better than how you were treated.<eos> A lot of us do.
You know, if there's a donor who's got money, she's right there.<eos> She can't even cry in public.<eos> Eric... my player...<eos> He never touched that kid.<eos> He never forced himself on him, and then that kid comes back and kills Wes?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Leslie should've settled this thing a long time ago.<eos> There are a lot of us who think there need to be changes.<eos> But the school board is split on Leslie, and she's got a lot of donors who like her.<eos> A lot of people don't.
Those are your boys.<eos> They do as you say.<eos> Now Wes is dead.<eos> Look, if they're acting out, that has nothing to do with me.<eos> All right?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Something happens, and you never got anything to do with it!<eos> First time the police came... after the Captains' party, I could've told them about all the liquor you bought, all the drugs, all the girls you got to come around and get screwed.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Nobody did.
I'm taking it for my own.<eos> - For stealing the gun?<eos> For shooting the boy?<eos> Responsibility and guilt are closely linked here.<eos> Do you feel guilty about this incident?<eos> What I feel...<eos> Do you feel guilty about anything else?<eos> You know how, um... my mom gave me up once?<eos> I know why she did, but I, um, never really got it.<eos> Now I do.
We should have tailed her.<eos> They would have made us, made her.<eos> Don't worry, she's equipped with one of the best trackers we have.<eos> Sound, GPS.<eos> Battery lasts...<eos> - She just ditched it.<eos> - She what?<eos> Well, either that, or she's currently laying down in the middle of the Pulaski Bridge.<eos> I'm gonna say she ditched it.<eos> Of course she did.
How am I gonna get a job with a record?<eos> How's it going in there, boys?<eos> Hey, sir, are our parents on their way, or...<eos> Don't know what they can do for you, son.<eos> We got your friends, Laurel and Hardy, two cells down.<eos> They told us everything.<eos> Yeah, the underage drinking and the trespassing, we expected.<eos> The prostitutes and the heroin, now that we didn't think was coming.<eos> What? The prostitutes?<eos> We didn't...
Can you hear me? Shelby!<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Are you all right? !<eos> Are you hurt?<eos> Please, stop! Stop!<eos> I have to get you to a hospital!<eos> I didn't understand what happened.<eos> I still don't.
- (sighs) - (sighs) Stand down.<eos> How's it feel to save the day?<eos> (sighs) Doesn't suck.<eos> Well, that was fun.<eos> If you're done screwing around, can one of you geniuses please go figure out who killed Les Turner?<eos> Hey. Things got kind of cray.<eos> How you doin'?<eos> Like someone out of clues.<eos> Look, I know we're at a dead end right now, but we will figure this out.<eos> We always do.
What the hell is this place?<eos> I was hoping one of you could tell me.<eos> - That's...<eos> - Ed Clark.<eos> Turner's had him here right under our noses since his murder.<eos> Why?<eos> Maggie: I didn't know anything about this chamber.<eos> This is your lab!<eos> How could you not know?<eos> - 'Cause I didn't.
Camille!<eos> How wonderful to see you.<eos> And with my Linus.<eos> Yes, it is a treat to see you, Camille.<eos> We came to see this hovel you left us for.<eos> - He doesn't mean that.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> So you don't like it?<eos> He likes it.<eos> We both do.
So I need you to send a team to the island to make sure that they're all right.<eos> Just do it.<eos> I'm suspending Agent Patterson, effective immediately.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> Her actions resulted in a man's death.<eos> She's not responsible for what happened to that boy.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The moment she left this office with those files, she broke the law.<eos> She had my permission.<eos> Did she?
Sarah, it's me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Give me a call when you get this.<eos> Hello?<eos> This is Bacchus confirming your reservation tonight at 8:00 p.m. for two people.<eos> Oh. Sorry, I...<eos> I don't have a reservation for tonight.<eos> Booked under David Wagner?<eos> He gave very specific instructions to call this number.<eos> Wh-When did he...
This one's already pretty big.<eos> Take it up with the sensors.<eos> Activating fire suppression system.<eos> Run! Run!<eos> We're in.<eos> Now what?<eos> Okay, those wire bundles control the communication going in and out of the building.<eos> Phone, cable, Internet.<eos> Okay, how do we know which ones to disable?<eos> You don't.
We were friends for over 20 years.<eos> I was her cameraman back when she was still a news correspondent before she started her website.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Masters.<eos> No further questions.<eos> So, the murder took place at your townhouse, is that correct?<eos> I'm afraid so.<eos> My wife and I hosted the cocktail party where your client killed Sadie.<eos> Did you see my client kill her?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
No.<eos> She didn't make a statement.<eos> - The only thing she said was that she wanted to speak with a lawyer.<eos> The people call Richard Castle.<eos> Raise your right hand.<eos> Oh, sorry.<eos> This is the right hand.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
However, there has been a development in the case.<eos> Excuse us, Your Honor, but the defense has a witness to call to the stand.<eos> Uh, Your Honor, the defense would like to call<eos> Richard Castle to the stand.<eos> So, Nina definitely didn't do it.<eos> Tell me something I don't know, like who did.<eos> No idea.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth,<eos> - and nothing but the truth?<eos> - I do.
Did you look at it?<eos> Yeah, I... glanced at it.<eos> Her and Cosima are obsessed with this Brightborn IVF/Neolution connection.<eos> Yeah, but that Evie Cho, she was on the board of Dyad.<eos> Oi. "GeneConnexion."<eos> That's the company Felix used to find his bio sister.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Is it? They're owned by Brightborn?<eos> I knew there was something about Adele.<eos> No, no, you don't.
Hey, you're still here.<eos> Yeah, I never left.<eos> I love this city.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Kira.<eos> Hello.<eos> Real sister, how?<eos> We have the same father.<eos> I thought you didn't have a father.<eos> Well, I didn't, but now I do.
You have to go stop her.<eos> Find out what she's doing and get rid of her, okay? Okay!<eos> Wait! How?<eos> Well, it would be great if you could honor the fact that we need a safe house. - Hey, hey!<eos> - God! You agreed not to bring her here, and then you just walked her right in.<eos> It's a safe house, Fee.<eos> You're paranoid.<eos> The two of you, you're bloody paranoid.<eos> Kira's here. We have a right to be suspicious of Adele.<eos> No! No, you don't, okay?
Unless you're smart.<eos> Your choice.<eos> You could be like them or me.<eos> Or them.<eos> Make it easy on yourself.<eos> I ain't ever gonna kneel.<eos> Yeah, I said that, too.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> See that's the thing, man.<eos> You don't.
His name was Shane.<eos> Well, him and Lori... they were together.<eos> They thought I was dead.<eos> I know Judith isn't mine.<eos> I know it.<eos> I love her.<eos> She's my daughter.<eos> But she isn't mine.<eos> I had to accept that.<eos> I did.
Look...<eos> I just... It's easy to forget that you're... Just a kid.<eos> And I didn't mean to hurt your feelings or anything.<eos> I was just screwing around.<eos> Just forget it.<eos> Come in.<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt, sir, but, uh...<eos> You left Lucille out by the truck.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I never do that.
So, for once...<eos> Do something useful... and make me a bullet.<eos> Don't beat yourself up.<eos> Why would I?<eos> He asked you about mark and Amber, and you sold 'em out, right?<eos> You had to.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Whatever helps you sleep at night.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
I don't know how it works these days, Sue.<eos> I haven't been in college for...<eos> Years.<eos> I just really feel like a sorority is finally gonna be my thing, you know?<eos> I mean, I've made friends with people in the dorm, but I just don't feel like I've really found my people.<eos> Or even my person, really.<eos> Well, just remember. If you get in, that's great, but if you don't get in, that's fine, too.<eos> Angelina Jolie was never in a sorority, and she married Brad Pitt.<eos> Not that marriage is the answer if don't get into a sorority.<eos> Or even if you do.
Come here.<eos> First of all, I love you with all of my heart, and I love us.<eos> That's good to know, baby.<eos> I love you too.<eos> Mm. Wow, you smell fantastic.<eos> I'm in a situation.<eos> We had sex last night.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Is it gonna happen again?<eos> It already did.
I am not the waiter.<eos> I'm a manager.<eos> And you know my name is Jake.<eos> I'd be happy to send a waiter over for you, though.<eos> I want it from you.<eos> No one else makes them right.<eos> I'm sorry, Ally.<eos> I mean, Miss...<eos> You know my husband's on the board of this club.<eos> - Of course I do.
Do what?<eos> Ask questions and lie.<eos> Especially about him.<eos> We know what he did to you, Violet.<eos> Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
All right, Garcia, you can eliminate anyone under the age of 70.<eos> And they wouldn't just need to be elderly clients.<eos> They could also be disabled in some way.<eos> Anyone he could take advantage of.<eos> Oh. 12 names, then.<eos> How many of them live near a grocery store?<eos> Define near.<eos> Uh, within a mile.<eos> Well, there are 163 grocery stores in the greater St. Louis area.<eos> Two of them do.
Jake has come home.<eos> So should you.<eos> Then again, perhaps it is better to fight for the pleasure of ripping the beating heart of power from America's chest, to hold it in your bloody hands, than it is to never have entered the battle at all.<eos> After all, to be empty-handed is to be powerless.<eos> And in this town, powerless means impotent.<eos> And who wants to be impotent?<eos> You're late.<eos> You knew I was at dinner with my father.<eos> I don't like waiting.<eos> Then don't.
Hey, Abby. You busy?<eos> At [Scoffs] 2:00 in the morning?<eos> No, sir. I'm free.<eos> What's up?<eos> I'm gonna need my schedule cleared for the next three days so I can prepare for the east Asia summit.<eos> Okay.<eos> You have it?<eos> Do I have... ?<eos> My schedule.<eos> Oh, sir, I-I do, but, uh...
Track him down.<eos> Retrace his steps.<eos> Do whatever you need to do to find Billy and stop him before he's able to hand over what he has.<eos> I have got to get me one of these.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> You're working.<eos> You seem good.<eos> What?<eos> You thought you'd find me drunk, playing Russian roulette with the nuclear codes?<eos> You did.
You have a whistle-blower at the NSA.<eos> Which is why I need you to handle this.<eos> Keep it off the agency's radar.<eos> Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Why me?<eos> I need someone I trust.<eos> I'm not the obvious choice, then.<eos> You and I both know that's not true.<eos> You don't talk to her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.<eos> You?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
Barry, you've always had someone to come home to.<eos> I can't help but wonder...<eos> Maybe we were meant to be together.<eos> You lost your powers?<eos> I gave them up to save Wally.<eos> I can re-create the circumstances to get you your speed back.<eos> Let's set up the particle accelerator.<eos> Barry... he's gone.<eos> This wasn't su...<eos> I didn't...
We use me as bait to lure him back to S.T.A.R. Labs, where Cisco and Wells can kill him... again.<eos> Who are you pretending to be now?<eos> I don't have time for this.<eos> Yes, you do, Barry.<eos> You have all the time in the universe...<eos> - literally.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> And how can you stand there in judgment and accuse me of rejecting my gift?<eos> Do you have any idea how much I've done since I was first struck by lightning, how many people I've helped with the power that you gave me... what I've sacrificed?<eos> Of course we do.
Okay, turn it down.<eos> Turn it down!<eos> I'm not kidding!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> To show you what it was like for Izzy the night you killed him.<eos> Izzy was my partner and my friend. Why would I kill him?<eos> He wanted to make some real music, and that meant ending your partnership.<eos> You got pissed, went to Amiel. He could relate.<eos> Izzy was suing Amiel, wanted out of his contract.<eos> Then you two did something childish.
Hey, relax!<eos> Everything's fine!<eos> Don't run, you idiots.<eos> He's going to save us, don't run.<eos> Stop, you damn morons! - He's coming!<eos> - My son is a hero!<eos> You hear me?<eos> He's a hero! You really mean that, Dad?<eos> You think I'm a hero?<eos> Of course I do.
- No, BoJack.<eos> I'm your agent and your friend, and I will always support you.<eos> But I'm 33 years old, and I want to have a family by the time I'm 40.<eos> I don't want to spend the next seven years in and out of love with you.<eos> I've wasted too much time waiting for things to happen.<eos> And I'm not gonna wait anymore.<eos> And for what it's worth, I always liked the horse from Horsin' Around.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everybody did.
You gonna start lying now?<eos> You leave her alone.<eos> Hey, that guy you shot, genius, was the one with the key.<eos> You shot our captain.<eos> That true?<eos> - Hey, keep your goddamn hands...<eos> Don't... don't... don't hurt him.<eos> I'm going to give you to the count of five to tell me where the key to the boat is. - One.<eos> - He doesn't have it.<eos> Who does? Two.
It's over now.<eos> - Go get the girl.<eos> - But you said that I could...<eos> Jack, plans have changed.<eos> - Where's my family?<eos> - You'll see them soon.<eos> Your time here is done.<eos> Chris can't see this.<eos> Think I'm actually starting to get used to this.<eos> Please don't.
Come here.<eos> - How's this gonna go?<eos> - Luis will take the Zodiac over to the boat up ahead of us where his contact...<eos> Miguel.<eos> Miguel will accept payment and then we'll be on our way to beautiful Baja.<eos> Okay, stop.<eos> That's close enough.<eos> Good luck.<eos> How do you say "asshole" in Spanish?<eos> You don't.
- She's my mom.<eos> - And she's like my mom, too.<eos> If you tell everybody this lie, what'll happen to us?<eos> What'll happen to our family?<eos> You'll blow everything up - based off something you think you saw.<eos> - Let me by, Chris. Whatever you think you saw, it's wrong, Alicia. I froze.<eos> That's it. That's all that happened, okay? - Chris, let me go.<eos> - You have to believe me.<eos> You can't say anything.<eos> What if I do?
- If we stay, we die.<eos> - We have no place to go, Papa.<eos> I know what you're going through.<eos> I know what he meant to you.<eos> What is it that you want?<eos> Nick.<eos> - He's just--<eos> - I'm not the boy's daddy.<eos> I just thought that- - I don't know what's happening to him.<eos> Yes, you do.
I don't want you to worry, Daniel.<eos> I will take care of you.<eos> There is a place for you here.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I came to bring you back.<eos> She really needs you.<eos> She's hurting.<eos> - Come on.<eos> You found him.<eos> No, I didn't.
Cut the shit, Big Head.<eos> I see exactly what you're doing.<eos> Poaching my tenants?<eos> You stole my business model.<eos> What? No.<eos> Dude, it's not like that at all.<eos> It's just this house has, like, nine bedrooms.<eos> You have any idea how scary that gets at night?<eos> So I just wanted to have some roommates around, but, um, you know, I felt weird charging them rent, cause, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
Fine.<eos> Wicka-wicka-wicka-- ♪ Now, boys and girls ♪<eos> ♪ If you wanna do the BoJack Take your hands-- ♪<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> You're BoJack!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Finally.<eos> - From the logo.<eos> BoJack, you didn't kill Nadia.<eos> BoJack did.
I'm not throwing a tantrum-<eos> - Why are we having sex in my car?<eos> -Can we at least go back to your place?<eos> -No, BoJack.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> You control every part of my life, I don't know anything about you.<eos> [scoffs] -You don't want to know me, BoJack.<eos> -No, I do.<eos> -I want to be known and know others.<eos> -You don't.
I can laugh, too.<eos> Ramona, I'm telling you... [wailing]<eos> She's dead.<eos> I was good.<eos> Too good.<eos> The San Diego Union-Tribune called me, "A talent to watch."<eos> I knew I had to get out of there.<eos> And you've been living here ever since?<eos> That's right.<eos> I also did an arc on The Good Wife.
So unless I wanted us to be on the street, I had to cover for her, a lot.<eos> That rich family loved Italian food and champagne fountains.<eos> And cocaine.<eos> And private jets.<eos> And screaming at each other.<eos> "Who threw my cocaine in the champagne fountain?"<eos> - So standard rich people stuff?<eos> - I guess.<eos> - How come you never told me that?<eos> - I did.
Why would Chris do that to me?<eos> Abby and I are friends.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> The two of you went to the dance together last Friday?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What happened?<eos> What exactly is she saying happened?<eos> We just want to hear your son's side.<eos> His side?<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
It'll be quicker and less unpleasant.<eos> No, not at all.<eos> I know many people like you.<eos> I know your tricks.<eos> OK.<eos> I have only one question.<eos> Paul Lefebvre isn't his real name.<eos> I figured as much.<eos> Did he ever tell you his real name?<eos> No, he never did.
I guess you could call that progress.<eos> Yeah, well, you are moving back to L.A.<eos> In the morning, right?<eos> This might be our last chance to talk.<eos> About what?<eos> No, seriously.<eos> What is there to talk about?<eos> Will you at least give me a chance to explain a few things?<eos> - I told you I was married.<eos> - You did.
Aw, for heaven's sakes, Cathy, when we got married, you used to speak for hours.<eos> But since we moved to New York City, nothing!<eos> Wow.<eos> It all magically fits.<eos> Come on, Cathy, say something!<eos> Anything!<eos> Fuggedaboutit!<eos> And scene!<eos> I said "fear of public speaking."<eos> Yes, you did. Very nice.
Walter, what are you doing?<eos> Slow your roll.<eos> Well... the plans are still very rudimentary, but I'm sure you will make it out of this world.<eos> Get it, Walter?<eos> "Out of this world""<eos> Sit back, relax.<eos> You planning on taking some research satellites?<eos> You're trying to eat dessert when they just served salad.<eos> Don't you know how to romance someone?<eos> No, he does not.
Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> He tried, but I stopped him.<eos> Do you want to know why I really gave you the backstory of your son, Bernard?<eos> It was Arnold's key insight, the thing that led the hosts to their awakening... suffering.<eos> The pain that the world is not as you want it to be.<eos> It was when Arnold died, when I suffered, that I... began to understand what he had found.<eos> To realize I was wrong.<eos> But you kept us here in this hell.<eos> Bernard, I told you, Arnold didn't know how to save you.<eos> I do.
22 years ago, my wife, Elizabeth, lost her battle with depression... and killed herself, scarring not only me, but our two children.<eos> Sadly, this kind of tragedy is not unique to our family, and therefore, I can only hope that my donation helps to ease the suffering, the feeling of hopelessness, that we and too many others have experienced.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, in memory of my late wife, I have given $1 million to help build the Elizabeth Rhodes Psychiatric Ward.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you you all very much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> He looks just like his father.<eos> He really does.
Why did she impulsively come over?<eos> Why are we doing whatever it is we're doing?<eos> Why, why, why, why... why...<eos> The house of why.<eos> You got the hiccups?<eos> I get stoned super easy these days.<eos> Have you noticed?<eos> I keep replaying what happened at that bar.<eos> I pleasured myself at my desk, thinking of you.<eos> You didn't?
It's us.<eos> So things are good, young Jackson?<eos> Whoa, hey. Geez.<eos> - Yeah, things are good with me.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Everything's as it was, status quo?<eos> Same old, same old, huh?<eos> Nothing new in your life, nothing exciting, nothing, well, unique or exotic?<eos> You know that I know you know, right?<eos> - I do now, okay. - Okay.
She thinks we leave her out of stuff, apparently.<eos> Lori, who is now, you know,<eos> - on the Alumni Board.<eos> - Babe.<eos> Babe, just take a breath.<eos> Take a breath.<eos> Breathe.<eos> I am trying, Em, but I need this.<eos> - I want to be Dean of this place... of Hamilton.<eos> - Of course you do.
- Mine was $11. - Mm.<eos> - Everything okay? - Mm-hmm.<eos> That was rhetorical, by the way.<eos> I absolutely know it isn't.<eos> Mm. Jack's panicking.<eos> I mean, but that's what Jack does, right?<eos> - He... he panics.<eos> - Let me guess.<eos> Something to do with the 20-something you've invited into your marriage and the power-hungry neighbor recently appointed to a governing body that will determine your husband's professional fate?<eos> - How do you do that?
What's... What's...<eos> That's turning me on.<eos> What's that?<eos> Ah, this is her pout.<eos> She does this when she wants to get her way.<eos> See? Look at this.<eos> That's the one.<eos> You just want to have sex with it.<eos> I do.<eos> I do!
So, he sliced up Velez, stuffed a bomb inside him, and then dumped him at the same site.<eos> He assumed the body of his second victim would go to the same morgue as the first.<eos> The bomb would destroy, or contaminate, any evidence that led back to him.<eos> Whatever remained would be inadmissible.<eos> He inadvertently calculated correctly.<eos> Omar Velez was a dead end, but if we can figure out who wanted her dead, we'll have our bomber.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Okay, so who was she?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> No one does.
So, how is finding a criminal a method of harassment?<eos> Your assuming Hector Mendoza is a criminal.<eos> He might be an undercover policeman, or a very good friend of the mayor's.<eos> I'm just saying, proceed with caution.<eos> Oh, my God, that's Janet.<eos> Janet Heffernan.<eos> Someone killed her?<eos> A few days ago.<eos> Did you know her well?<eos> No, none of us did.
It's for me, Padre.<eos> Or will you let me burn, too?<eos> Everything all right?<eos> Where'd Cassidy go?<eos> Jesse? Where's Cassidy?<eos> Jesse?<eos> You know about him?<eos> What he is?<eos> Jesus. That's right.<eos> You did.
Jesse, much bigger things are coming for you, much bigger things than this here.<eos> So you got to be one of the good guys.<eos> 'Cause why?<eos> 'Cause there's way too many of the bad.<eos> You promise me?<eos> I promise, Daddy.<eos> You stop that.<eos> We Custers don't cry.<eos> We fight.<eos> I did this, Daddy!
He dived.<eos> Repeatedly.<eos> Over and over and over.<eos> Finally, he got the job done. Snapped his own neck.<eos> Jonny's response to that tragedy was to remove the top bunks.<eos> All in the name of justice.<eos> Preacher, you're gonna wish you was in hell.<eos> I'm sorry, sheriff.<eos> I'll see you Sunday.<eos> How did he...
Oh, like a... like a road trip?<eos> With buckets of guns, sex, drugs, and shady characters dressed in bikinis?<eos> Yeah. I imagine there'll be a bit of that.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Done.<eos> I'm sorry, we're just gonna, like, drive around, shooting people, getting wasted, and looking for God?<eos> Oh, I'm so in!<eos> And what are you gonna do when you find him?<eos> Well... God wants our help, we'll help him.<eos> If he doesn't...
- You got into a fight.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, what am I supposed to do when someone calls me a freak?<eos> Not fight.<eos> Come on, we don't fight.<eos> We're above that.<eos> Yeah. Try being here.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Some place called Project Cadmus, which I'm guessing isn't an all-inclusive resort.<eos> It's the reason that Clark won't work with the government.<eos> Okay, so if, if the DEO is a prison, then Cadmus is a dissection lab.<eos> It's genetic engineering facility that treats aliens like lab rats. Amputated.<eos> Skinned. Drained. Injected with experimental drugs.<eos> Why would they do that?<eos> Weaponizing alien abilities for military purposes.<eos> What do they do to humans?<eos> Does Clark know where it is?<eos> No. No one does.
You know, Juan-Julio, I'd fire you if you hadn't found...<eos> what you found in my trunk.<eos> You know, Julie, you've been going nonstop. Why don't you take a break?<eos> Ugh. That's a plan. I'm exhausted.<eos> Thank you, guys.<eos> I never could have gotten through today without your help and support.<eos> Nope. It was all you.<eos> [Chuckles] Ohh.<eos> You got my 20 bucks?<eos> Yes, we do, Thelma.
Ugh. You know, we could never serve this where I work.<eos> It's over roasted and totally acidic.<eos> Jodi, it's an AA meeting.<eos> The only thing this coffee needs to be is not vodka.<eos> You do know you two aren't fooling anyone, right?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Mom, everyone knows you and Steve are dating.<eos> - No, they don't.

Show a little respect.<eos> Oh, please, we're way past that.<eos> Good night.<eos> Okay. I dipped my toe, I dipped my face.<eos> Everything got dipped.<eos> What?<eos> It just happened.<eos> One thing led to another.<eos> You know how it is.<eos> No, I don't.
- Yeah, 'kay, bye.<eos> Will you stop?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cameron, the way you've been acting, like charging right into things and you're so impulsive,<eos> I don't know if you're overcompensating, or trying to impress me...<eos> No, it is not about you.<eos> It's just how I want to live my life now, that's it.<eos> Just unafraid.<eos> Kirsten, you know how I feel about you.<eos> You do.
- You'll be wanting a room prepared?<eos> Aye.<eos> She can have the Blue Room.<eos> I meant... for the two of you.<eos> You must've... discussed it between you.<eos> I'll make up two rooms, then.<eos> The fever is infectious.<eos> Reckon she caught it from the Partridge lad.<eos> She needs a doctor.<eos> They both do.
- Clarence House...<eos> - Our home.<eos> What about it?<eos> We have to give it up.<eos> The home of the Sovereign of the United Kingdom is Buckingham Palace.<eos> Says who?<eos> Me.<eos> I thought you hated that place.<eos> I do.<eos> We all do.
Emori, you know you can correct your defects here.<eos> I would, if I had any.<eos> What can I do for you, A.L.I.E.?<eos> Your friend John Murphy is headed back to the temple to do harm.<eos> I need your help to stop him.<eos> Everywhere I looked, there were fins.<eos> And teeth.<eos> And blood.<eos> I knew if they saw me, I'd be next, so I just floated there, waiting, praying they'd swim on.<eos> But they didn't.
Not all roads lead to Daniel Stinger.<eos> Yeah, but what if this one does?<eos> What if... What if we look back and it turns out to have been the key to finding him and I just... sat around and did nothing?<eos> I mean, come on, guys.<eos> I cannot do this alone.<eos> I really need...<eos> Stop.<eos> Okay, just stop.<eos> You had him at "hello."<eos> First of all, she didn't.
Trust me, it helps.<eos> That's not just tea.<eos> No. Some situations require more than just tea.<eos> Like when you shoot your first person?<eos> You didn't have a choice.<eos> You did the right thing.<eos> At least you didn't kill her.<eos> She's lucky you aren't a better shot.<eos> How did she know about the Stitchers program?<eos> She didn't.
I always have been.<eos> And I always will be.<eos> Okay then. I'm gonna go.<eos> Uh... you two have a great night.<eos> Enjoy Coachella.<eos> You can just give me the jacket back when you guys get home, okay?<eos> - Let's get out of here. - Josh.<eos> Gabi, look, I didn't mean to ruin your...<eos> You're not too late.<eos> - But didn't you and Jake...
He did love me.<eos> Love comes in many forms.<eos> But the kind of love a child needs is the kind they can count on.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Wake up, sleepyhead!<eos> I made pancakes.<eos> Morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> You know, I really do love you, Becca.<eos> Of course you do.
So she'll never know what you're capable of.<eos> Or not capable of.<eos> And I didn't see him for two more years.<eos> And I always blamed her.<eos> I always thought she was the one keeping us apart.<eos> She never told me any of this.<eos> Why?<eos> Because she didn't want to hurt you.<eos> Because someone did love you.<eos> Someone still does.
Eh, the usual.<eos> Get any writing done?<eos> I did, a little, yeah.<eos> I'm working on a poem for you.<eos> A love poem?<eos> Yeah, I guess if it's for you, it's a love poem.<eos> It's kind of inspired by our, uh, Ohio Blue Tip Matches.<eos> Really?<eos> Does it mention the little megaphone shape the letters make?<eos> Y-Yeah. Actually, it does.
Previously on "12 Monkeys"...<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Sam!<eos> What happened to me?<eos> The Witness took control of you.<eos> I don't love you!<eos> You did once.
I didn't have to go to that hotel and wait for you, but I did.<eos> So, please, stop blaming yourself for me.<eos> Worry about your own purpose.<eos> Go... save the world, Cole.<eos> Ah, to hell with the world.<eos> Then what are we still doing here?<eos> For what?<eos> Why continue this?<eos> You know why.<eos> No. I don't.
Attention Night Room shoppers...<eos> Almost there.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, we got to take you to the back.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> My God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.
Almost there.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Who are you?<eos> Hey, we got to take you to the back.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> This is it. 1957.<eos> My God, there's a woman here with a gun!<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't.<eos> Then I did.
And this "corrective surgery," must it really be Boston?<eos> That's where the best man is.<eos> The only man.<eos> They're better equipped to deal with gall bladder problems in America. Due to the high fat diets they have here.<eos> Leaving me without you for the summit with Ike.<eos> - Can't you delay it? - No, I can't.<eos> Besides, you have already stated your ability to run the ship without me for some time.<eos> In jest, my dear boy, when you become mutinous and presumptuous.<eos> You know how much I depend on you.<eos> - I do.
The Hammer.<eos> You were in jail?<eos> Briefly.<eos> And you hit people with a hammer?<eos> Not literally.<eos> Uh, my cellmate got a little frisky with me, and I had to clock her with a Bible.<eos> So why didn't they call you "The Bible"?<eos> It was already taken.<eos> Okay, next question.<eos> At the Rolling Stones concert at Altamont, how many Hells Angels did... ?
Things are hard right now.<eos> You're still lucky.<eos> You don't know.<eos> You don't know what it's like to do this job and not have anybody to talk to about it, except a series of handlers who don't give a shit.<eos> My daughter is in a very bad place because of us... because of this job.<eos> She could sense that something was off.<eos> You know, the late hours, no family ever around.<eos> Elizabeth wanted to tell her who we were, and I didn't.<eos> We fought about it for months.<eos> And then we did.
Are you Big Jerry now?<eos> I don't care what you do in your spare time.<eos> I really don't.<eos> But you... you better think, and you better ask yourself, is this really who you want to be?<eos> Good to see you, Fitz.<eos> The President wanted to see me.<eos> Come this way.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> I caught your interview with Sally.<eos> You did?
Who's Oliver?<eos> My brother.<eos> I thought you were an only child.<eos> I am.<eos> Oh.<eos> It's Sunday-night dinner.<eos> Can I come in?<eos> Um, this is a surprise.<eos> You keep saying that you don't want to eat at the house.<eos> Well, tonight, I do.
That's a good question.<eos> I don't know.<eos> That's a... good question.<eos> While it's true this workshop is geared toward couples, many of the principles covered here-- such as communication, trust and teamwork-- apply to all relationships.<eos> Including working partnerships.<eos> So given that Steve and Danny traveled all this way, I've agreed to sign off on their therapy hours once they've completed the course.<eos> I should also tell you that I've spoken with Steve and Danny about their partnership, and it is fraught with some very serious problems.<eos> So I think it would be both cruel and irresponsible for us to abandon them in this time of crisis.<eos> Really?<eos> I don't.
I just want to feel like I'm a priority to him.<eos> Even when we're making love, I feel like he's not really present.<eos> Maybe that's because I have to schedule an appointment with you to be there.<eos> I'm sorry I'm so busy juggling a job and raising your two children.<eos> Maybe if you valued that, I'd give it up more often.<eos> Danny, you haven't exactly been participating.<eos> What's your take on all this?<eos> Uh, my take on, uh, this is, um-- sorry-- it's stupid, and I'd like to just go take a nap if that's okay.<eos> So you don't see the value in anything we do here?<eos> I-I don't.
- Uh-huh. You know, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> The wrong impression?<eos> Natalie just had a baby.<eos> Oh. Uh-huh. I know that.<eos> Her husband died only six months ago.<eos> I know that too.<eos> So, I don't want to give anyone the wrong impression.<eos> It amazes me how dumb a doctor can be.<eos> Everybody knows you like Natalie.<eos> They do?
Goddamn it, Carrie. I need you.<eos> And I told you, I'm not that person anymore.<eos> Just hold on one second.<eos> - Hey, Carrie.<eos> - Hey. - He didn't show, huh?<eos> - No.<eos> But he was scheduled, right?<eos> Monday, Wednesdays, and Fridays, yeah.<eos> You have any idea where I can find him?<eos> I don't.
What?<eos> Terrorism?<eos> ! This is ridiculous.<eos> He's not a terrorist.<eos> That's for a court to decide.<eos> But right now, I need both of you to answer a few questions.<eos> Unh-unh. N... not without a lawyer.<eos> Mrs. Bah, your son has been radicalized by some very bad people.<eos> You should be thanking us we got to him before he carried out their instructions.<eos> Don't, Ma.
You should have told me.<eos> You know I can't violate patient confidentiality.<eos> You're her friend.<eos> You're my friend.<eos> I'm also her doctor.<eos> She asked me not to say anything to you.<eos> I tried to change her mind.<eos> She doesn't want to see me?<eos> She doesn't mean that.<eos> Yes, she does.
That's Joseph Ballantine, botany professor at QBU.<eos> Neighbor says he throws these mushroom parties a couple times a year.<eos> Some party.<eos> Yeah, I figure he picked the wrong 'shrooms this time around, poisoned himself and his customers.<eos> Uh, wrong.<eos> That's some consultant from Major Cases.<eos> He just showed up.<eos> Said he heard about it on his scanner.<eos> You made him sit in a corner?<eos> No, he did that himself.
And it has the potential to further reduce my need for sleep. Would you...?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I had poop for lunch.<eos> You should've seen the Davenports' faces when we broke the news to them.<eos> I mean, I knew they'd take it hard, but I didn't think they'd refuse to give us their DNA.<eos> We underestimated the hold the imposter has over them.<eos> If they won't help prove she's a fraud, we'll just see if she killed Bob Underhill instead.<eos> Yesterday you said you had to accompany your mother to a doctor's appointment in Scarsdale.<eos> That's right.<eos> Only you didn't.
No, but once the secret's out, what would I have?<eos> We need to take this to the next level.<eos> No, we need to take it slow.<eos> This can get out of control real easy.<eos> You're using it, aren't you?<eos> I had to make sure you weren't trying to cheat me.<eos> I told you not to use it.<eos> This could ruin everything.<eos> - I think I know what I'm doing.<eos> - No, you don't.
Can I help you?<eos> - Malcolm Caulfield?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Detective Burkhardt.<eos> This is Detective Griffin.<eos> What'd I do?<eos> 'Cause I don't remember doing anything bad.<eos> You shoot these photos?<eos> Ah, Summer Blake.<eos> Yeah, I did.
It's all right.<eos> There's nothing nefarious in feeding.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> As soon as she's done... you're handing her back.<eos> There, there, my little sweet pea.<eos> There, there.<eos> Are you hungry?<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Your mummy knows exactly what you need, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
License and registration.<eos> Have you been drinking?<eos> None of your business.<eos> Not me, I'm the designated driver.<eos> Where you coming from?<eos> We don't need to tell you where we're coming from.<eos> A concert.<eos> This isn't right.<eos> Step out of the car.<eos> Please, sir, we really didn't do anything.
Always used the same birth date.<eos> Two months ago, you were his doctor.<eos> You and Dr. Lorenson treated him.<eos> Do you remember him?<eos> Two months ago?<eos> You know, I treat a hundred patients a day, every day.<eos> No, I don't remember him.<eos> Did you see Mr. Heshman when Dr. Pineda was treating him the night she was attacked?<eos> No.<eos> I did.
Are you kidding?<eos> If I were kidding, this would be funny, but unfortunately, the hospital takes this kind of thing very seriously, Dr. Lorenson.<eos> I have to talk to Neal.<eos> Okay. You do that.<eos> But either you disclose it to H.R. discreetly or I will make an example of you two.<eos> Or you could break it off.<eos> Those are your options.<eos> She's already gone through this with the police.<eos> Do we really need to... ? Yes.<eos> We do.
The first time I was taken from her, I was two-years-old and I was placed in several foster homes until I was around seven when I was finally placed with a loving couple whom weren't able to have children of their own, and I made my first best friend there.<eos> She gave me her Mrs. Beasley doll.<eos> But one night, social workers came and they took me away.<eos> They didn't even let me take my doll.<eos> Wait, so...<eos> Justina's a foster kid?<eos> Justina is Lizzie.<eos> The friend that she told me about was her.<eos> Thanks a lot for telling Zoey that I cheated on you.<eos> I didn't.
That's my brother.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> So, uh, you...<eos> You two have patched things up.<eos> Everything's hunky-dory.<eos> It must be if you're having slumber parties.<eos> His buddy dropped him off here.<eos> Evan tied one on, and he's crashing here, so that he doesn't have to face Mom until he's sobered up.<eos> And you know he's allergic to pet dander, so...<eos> -Oh, I didn't, actually.
Yeah!<eos> That's what I'm talking about.<eos> White and tight.<eos> Go make some new friends, honey.<eos> Pasty-ass ho.<eos> You wanna go?<eos> I will kick you right back to the trailer park where you used to make out with your uncle.<eos> You need to come to daddy.<eos> No.<eos> No, she doesn't.
She's always sniffing around Mr. Boss' guys.<eos> You'd wrap your legs around anything with money, Sapphire.<eos> I saw you trying to get with a parking meter.<eos> Trinity.<eos> You hooked up with "The Stick" back in the day.<eos> A one-timer.<eos> I date CEOs, not gangsters.<eos> The night Cassidy bit it, she came back from her break screaming about how she just caught Nick banging some other chick, and that she was gonna send his ass to jail.<eos> Did anyone else see Nick here that night?<eos> We all did.
Wait.<eos> Come on.<eos> What else is there?<eos> How did you get here, Derek?<eos> They kidnapped me, from the grocery store.<eos> Uhh! I was buying food for dinner.<eos> For who?<eos> Savannah.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> Yes, I--I do.
Just seeing how you're doing.<eos> Our polling was off.<eos> I know.<eos> Way off.<eos> Was that you, too?<eos> No.<eos> I really thought we were gonna<eos> - go on to New Hampshire.<eos> - I know.<eos> Peter did, too.
Keep trying.<eos> My eyes in the sky.<eos> Two Hornets on the horizon.<eos> Should have visual in less than five.<eos> Private jet is outside restricted airspace, but not for long.<eos> Over metro D.C. in less than 30.<eos> Damn.<eos> Hell of a day to quit smoking.<eos> Didn't know you smoked, ma'am.<eos> I don't.
In the flesh.<eos> NCIS Agents Pride and Lasalle.<eos> You alone? Yeah.<eos> You got a lot of people lookin' for you.<eos> We gotta get you to safety.<eos> Not going anywhere.<eos> Your life is in danger.<eos> Not the first time.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - But I do.
The gods have abandoned her.<eos> It doesn't mean they're gone.<eos> We got another rock to turn over?<eos> Not yet.<eos> - So then what?<eos> - I don't know, Julia.<eos> I mean, what do you want me to say? "I give up"?<eos> "Forget about ever really fixing anything"?<eos> No, we keep trying, okay?<eos> At least I do.
Cheese.<eos> I'll love this 20 years from now, just seeing what I'm seeing, a close-up of Daisy.<eos> I was about nine at the time.<eos> And we were heading to a wrestling tournament.<eos> Some black ice had frozen over the night before.<eos> So, when we drove over it, my dad lost total control of the wheel.<eos> And we ended up upside down in a ravine.<eos> When we got to the hospital, I sat there for probably two, three hours.<eos> I was waiting for one of those Disney movie fantasies to come to life, where he woke up.<eos> But he never did.
I know how to comfort myself, live off scraps, and catch disease.<eos> The rest-- you know, love, relationships, family-- these are things I know nothing about.<eos> This is what the Armory can provide me.<eos> So will I do whatever it takes for answers?<eos> In a heartbeat.<eos> Flag on the play.<eos> Like an idiot, Stefan didn't renew the minutes on his cell phone. We'll call you when we connect.<eos> Come on, Bon. I want to beat traffic.<eos> You know where he is.<eos> Yeah, I do, Enzo.
You'll need to...<eos> You need to find a Pon.<eos> Somebody well connected.<eos> I don't know any well connected Pons.<eos> Then find someone who does.<eos> Well, well, well, Mr. Frink.<eos> Have you reconsidered? Reconsidered?<eos> Yeah, my offer to place some more authentic Americana with my Japanese clientele.<eos> Listen, you got a problem.<eos> We both do.
Hades put one hell of a protection spell on his elevator, and these "squiggly lines"<eos> are the only way to crack it open.<eos> Then hopefully that elevator will take us straight to him.<eos> Maybe with surprise on our side, we can get a shot at him.<eos> That's a lot of "maybe"s and "hopefully"s.<eos> It's all we have right now.<eos> Okay. Let's do this.<eos> So much for surprising him.<eos> Oh, we'll think of something else.<eos> We always do.
It's all we have right now.<eos> Okay. Let's do this.<eos> So much for surprising him.<eos> Oh, we'll think of something else.<eos> We always do.<eos> What if...?<eos> What if I could burn our names off the gravestones that Hades made for us, the ones holding us here?<eos> I looked for a spell like that.<eos> It doesn't exist.<eos> Actually, it does.
Being a hero is not about compassion and having forgiveness.<eos> It's about strength!<eos> Doing whatever it takes to defeat your enemies.<eos> But Rumple isn't even your real enemy.<eos> Hades is.<eos> Why do you defend Rumplestiltskin?<eos> He kidnapped you.<eos> He made you a servant.<eos> You should want him dead, too.<eos> Yeah, well, I don't.
Nos has gotten huge on the rave scene and in clubs.<eos> Kids inhaling it to get high.<eos> Might be where this came from.<eos> Give me a sec.<eos> - Thanks, Doc. - Yeah.<eos> Did the doctor say I can shower yet?<eos> I can't imagine how hard this is... but we need you to hold on just a little bit longer.<eos> Carolyn, I just want to make sure you know that none of this is your fault, okay?<eos> You guys have a brave little girl here.<eos> Yes, we do.
Second Precinct, we just saved Cuba!<eos> - Yes! Okay. First round of mojitos on me.<eos> You should go.<eos> We can catch up later.<eos> Hey, Jen. Uh...<eos> This is your win, too.<eos> Come with us.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Okay, well, I... I do love me a mojito.<eos> Duh, who doesn't?
Think it starts with a C.<eos> Cooper!<eos> Cavala...<eos> - What's going on, girl? - ***<eos> - What did you call me? - I know, right?<eos> How are you doing?<eos> - Great! - Great.<eos> - Great.<eos> Hi, I'm Kelly. - Kristen.<eos> - Oh, did I not...?
Kelly Walters, 33, worked in the mailroom.<eos> And, Mitch, it fits the pattern.<eos> No, this is different.<eos> - What do you make of this?<eos> - It's wool, English.<eos> The man you're looking for has money.<eos> But he didn't always.
At your beautiful face!<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> But... but your face is still so pretty.<eos> Josh, no. You don't get it. This was the night!<eos> This was supposed to be our perfect date!<eos> You know, the story we tell everybody and obnoxiously post on Facebook every year on our anniversary.<eos> But now we can't, because it's ruined!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Oh.<eos> Yes.<eos> And if you stay,<eos> I am gonna want to go again.<eos> Yeah? And again.<eos> Mm.<eos> And again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I have that effect on women.<eos> Yes, you do. (Chuckles)
They know where I live.<eos> They're not gonna do that... not if you testify.<eos> You put them away.<eos> [dramatic music] I don't get this.<eos> All you had to do was call 911.<eos> I froze. I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm not good in high-stress situations.<eos> - It's just a phone call!<eos> - I know.<eos> But I didn't.
After you murdered her.<eos> Dr. Yates, we're here because we heard you might have information about these victims.<eos> Who they were, how they got there.<eos> Where did they come from?<eos> Why don't you start with who they are.<eos> These are just bones, yeah?<eos> You couldn't find DNA on any of them, so I will guess that they came from working girls.<eos> Guess?<eos> You told SVU some of these victims might have been from Chicago.<eos> Did I?
Sam, help me, would you?<eos> So, Lulu...<eos> - Pretty full-on, yeah.<eos> - She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does.<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> Mmm. She does.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> - She does.
- Pretty full-on, yeah.<eos> - She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does.<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> Mmm. She does.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.
- She's trying to piss me off.<eos> She doesn't actually want to have sex with you.<eos> - She does.<eos> - She doesn't.<eos> Mmm. She does.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> - She does.<eos> - I don't have time to do this.<eos> She doesn't.<eos> She doesn't.
Yeah. Unfortunately, that's true.<eos> My understanding was we raised more than $50,000.<eos> Look, I don't want to bore you with the details of how this stuff works.<eos> Sometime, if you want to spend a day in my shoes, you're welcome to.<eos> The money doesn't nearly go as far as you'd think.<eos> There's, uh, hard costs, operating expenses...<eos> Hard costs?<eos> Like what, specifically?<eos> I understand your frustration.<eos> Sincerely, I do.
It must have just happened.<eos> Damn it.<eos> I take it from her subtle shift in attitude that's a bad thing.<eos> Every time Rayna dies, one of the bodies decays.<eos> We've lost quite a few this past week, and if we lose all of them, Rayna dies for good.<eos> So... Hunting vampires is your identity.<eos> Your fundamental "this is who I am..."<eos> In a nutshell.<eos> You ever wonder if there's a way to change that?<eos> No, I don't.
The armory is on their way to Mystic Falls.<eos> They'll be there soon.<eos> Not soon enough.<eos> She's connected to an everlasting.<eos> Maybe I can weaken it. And her.<eos> And maybe that will kill her and Stefan too.<eos> If I do nothing, she'll kill Damon.<eos> You're willing to kill for him?<eos> Do you really think he cares that much about you?<eos> Yeah. I do.
I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> I got... yeah...<eos> I got to write on this, so...<eos> That's two squad cars in two days.<eos> Yeah. Looks like he's running hurt.<eos> Yeah. Check out the trunk.<eos> Well, that's not department issue.<eos> That blood on the barrel...<eos> We know whose it is?<eos> No, sir. We don't.
Yeah, we're still waiting on the ballistics, but the blood on Howard's shotgun is a match for Haynes.<eos> They're cleaning house.<eos> Whoever runs this crew knows we're closing in.<eos> - Officer Mularz?<eos> - Lawyered up.<eos> We're going through those channels to set up another interview.<eos> You got nothing to connect him to the other guys?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you like him.<eos> - We do. - Hmm.
- Why not?<eos> Rosalee told me that Adalind is a Hexenbiest... again.<eos> What?<eos> It happened when I was in Germany with Monroe.<eos> Rosalee told Adalind to tell me, but she did not.<eos> Well, now I know why you're not getting enough sleep.<eos> And that's not all.<eos> Eve told me that the Captain is knowingly working with Black Claw.<eos> He knew Dix was gonna be shot?<eos> If he didn't then, he does now.
What?<eos> One's bigger than the other.<eos> What?<eos> I never noticed that before.<eos> Martha's okay.<eos> Nothing's changed.<eos> Nothing has happened.<eos> You think I'm being stupid?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I was thinking about not telling the Centre about this.<eos> Amador.<eos> Nina.<eos> My old boss got killed.<eos> I think you guys might've done it.<eos> There's been talk about blackmailing you.<eos> I don't want you on my conscience, too.<eos> This is the last time we're gonna see each other.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
- There aren't. - 'cause I think you're a great girl and a top notch chef.<eos> Well, I'm off for my morning run.<eos> Mom, you don't run.<eos> I know, but it sounds better than forging for pills in your medicine cabinet.<eos> See?<eos> Calling me "Cutie", morning drinking,<eos> Everything's back to normal.<eos> We just have to frake it for one more day.<eos> But I really want to see you tonight. I know.<eos> I do too.
Course you fight!<eos> This just keeps getting better.<eos> We'll never get through now.<eos> Well, we can't go back.<eos> Hello!<eos> What happened? Another rescue by Hondo Ohnaka!<eos> Thanks, Hondo!<eos> We owe you one.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
- Bye, Dad.<eos> Are you going?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> Did you call Jane Fellows?<eos> I did.<eos> I support your decision.<eos> No, you don't.
I mean, who are we protecting?<eos> Some scrawny kid in a hoodie?<eos> Part of our agreement was that you would not ask any questions.<eos> You're right. You're right.<eos> I just...<eos> I know someone is watching me.<eos> I can tell.<eos> On the train, at work, in my apartment.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I just do.
Tell me about it.<eos> Gus mentioned you were the one who found his body.<eos> - Yeah. Speaking of bodies... - Hmm?<eos> Mad hot.<eos> Alright, Champ.<eos> Maybe it wasn't such a good idea.<eos> - Do you know what time it is?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Time for you to tell me how Curtis died.<eos> He.. he just did!
I'll give you some alone time.<eos> YOU ARE NOT ALONE WE ARE ALL DIFFERENT WE ARE ALL EQUAL<eos> I need your help.<eos> I've been lost these past few weeks.<eos> Since the whole Ray thing.<eos> I need to finish what I started. With Evil Corp.<eos> But I don't know what to do.<eos> Why did you first start listening to me?<eos> When I sent you that note on the server at Evil Corp, something inside you told you to listen.<eos> And you did.
There may be a way.<eos> Anything?<eos> Just that Auntie Em died in Kansas... no details, not a clue.<eos> I can't believe it has to be me.<eos> Snow should be home.<eos> She should be with our boy.<eos> She should be going.<eos> She missed this time with Emma, and now it's happening all over again.<eos> We shouldn't be here.<eos> I didn't...
So, who's next in line for their help?<eos> It's hard to be a savior when no on wants you to save them.<eos> I gave the vial of powder to Dorothy.<eos> We attack at first light.<eos> Good.<eos> That doesn't sound like a very convincing battle cry.<eos> Ruby, what's going on?<eos> When we were on our trek, Dorothy asked me what I've been looking for this whole time.<eos> And I told her that didn't know.<eos> Well, do you?
Thank you for taking care of her.<eos> I've had some experience with sort of thing.<eos> Ruby, you can do this.<eos> - Go.<eos> - Okay.<eos> You left without saying anything.<eos> I was afraid.<eos> I couldn't lose you to Zelena.<eos> Well, yeah, but I almost lost you.<eos> You didn't.
Olan got picked 'cause he was the smartest kid in Old Town.<eos> You still mix up your letters.<eos> Somebody made a mistake.<eos> You want Jake growing up behind that wall?<eos> Your son has a way out of Old Town.<eos> Take it.<eos> - Hey, I said you're not going! - Aah!<eos> Forgot to mention...<eos> I hate bullies.<eos> He really does.
- What?<eos> Brandon, come on.<eos> - Brandon, stop.<eos> - What?<eos> - We... we can't.<eos> - We can't what?<eos> Tell Moms.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because you know why.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey, I'm, uh, Detective Danny Williams.<eos> I'm with Five-O.<eos> Got a badge to back that up?<eos> No, I-I don't. Not on me.<eos> Do you have, do you have a cell phone that gets service here?<eos> People today are too obsessed with their phones.<eos> I don't like it-<eos> - I come out here to connect with nature.<eos> Unplug. You feel me?<eos> Yeah, I do, uh...
Until I saw what was on it.<eos> I know that's me, but I swear it wasn't me.<eos> I would never hurt Staci.<eos> I loved her.<eos> I was at a dinner the entire time.<eos> If you don't believe me, ask Melissa or the waiter.<eos> Or any of the 75 other people that were there.<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> Relax.<eos> I do.

Where's the baby?<eos> She's -- she's with my mom.<eos> I hate to have to ask this, but I-I need to ask you a difficult question.<eos> Were you aware that your husband was having an affair with your babysitter?<eos> Yes.<eos> I knew.<eos> I know what you're thinking -- jealous wife kills her cheating husband.<eos> But that couldn't be further from the truth.<eos> I loved Dan.<eos> I still do.
As far as I can tell, there is no lore.<eos> My best guess is this was the White witch's home cooking.<eos> Terrific.<eos> All right, so what do we know?<eos> Um, if you kiss someone, then they die.<eos> I guess.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You didn't kiss Staci.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> No, but Dan did.
But it will not work this time.<eos> Rogelio, I am simply making you breakfast.<eos> It's what I always did before your professional milestones, okay?<eos> - So, when you say your line, show you them your beautiful soul and your beautiful teeth.<eos> Chewel's Gum oozes with flavor.<eos> Enough.<eos> I know we made an amazing and dynamic team.<eos> But that doesn't change the fact that you lied just to get my sympathy.<eos> Well, that is right.<eos> I-I did.
You'll recall Rafael was injected with a mysterious liquid by his mother.<eos> - _<eos> - Or Mutter, as it were.<eos> Where is the flash drive?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> The flash drive you traded for Mateo.<eos> Who did you give it to?<eos> I gave it to Rose.<eos> No, she doesn't have it.<eos> Who does?
Oh, you're...<eos> - Hey, boss? - Yeah?<eos> So, Nellie grew up Penelope Williams to parents Susan and Michael Williams here in Chicago.<eos> The thing is, is they also had a son by the name of Gregory.<eos> Yates is Nellie's brother.<eos> Nellie's mother is downstairs.<eos> - Susan Baldwin. - Okay.<eos> You and Halstead, as soon as she's seen Nellie, go interview her.<eos> Run his name through DCFS.<eos> Do a national check, too.
I'm not the one auditioning.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's something that represents my unique brand of thinking.<eos> When I fly, I like luggage fees.<eos> Me too.<eos> Why should us carry-on folk have to foot the bill for those morons who don't know how to pack?<eos> Three weeks, I went from Edinburgh to Warsaw on two pairs of pants and a tam-o'-shanter.<eos> I'm falling asleep.<eos> - I love naps!<eos> - Who doesn't?
Oh, hey, kids.<eos> Actually, I'm waiting for Sarah, so if I could have the room for just a -- a minute.<eos> Thank -- Okay, funny.<eos> Whoever turned out the lights, please turn them back on.<eos> They're not working.<eos> Might be a fuse.<eos> (cellphone rings)<eos> Mitchell, we have a problem.<eos> MITCHELL:<eos> No, we don't.
Let's roll.<eos> Let me see the picture.<eos> Fourth guy from the left.<eos> - Tate?<eos> - In position.<eos> All she wanted.<eos> Needed, really.<eos> You think she knows we got him?<eos> I believe she does.<eos> They both do.
We don't have to be here.<eos> (Chuckles) We can hear everything from the bathroom.<eos> So, anyway, Ella, I just want to say that I'm really sorry for what happened.<eos> It had absolutely nothing to do with you.<eos> I was young and an idiot.<eos> Okay, well... apology accepted.<eos> Wh... uh... Wait, I mean, let's, uh, let's at least have a drink.<eos> You know, I really wanna make this up to you.<eos> Sure, if that makes you feel better.<eos> It does.

What?<eos> Apparently, she's called you a few times from a sat phone.<eos> Yeah, she's, uh, she's doing aid work in South Asia.<eos> According to the information that we have, she's involved in a clandestine operation in Kiev.<eos> Ukraine?<eos> Yes. Do you have any way of reaching her?<eos> My understanding is she's not scheduled to check in with her handler until the end of the week.<eos> Of course, the fear is that by then it might be too late.<eos> Commander? Do you have a direct line to Lieutenant Rollins?<eos> No. No, I don't.
Um... I... uh, I had a sandwich so...<eos> I'm full.<eos> The audition's just for gas station TV, okay?<eos> Nobody watches it.<eos> Don't you dare downplay it.<eos> I adore gas station television,<eos> I mean, myself, personally.<eos> It is the intersection between information and also gas.<eos> That's right. Cece, today it's gas, tomorrow, it's local news... the next thing you know, you're reporting diabetes statistics as we all watch B-roll of fat people walking across the street.<eos> I just, I don't...
Nick, come on.<eos> You want to go there?<eos> I want to go where?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You wanted to impress me because you have a crush on me.<eos> It's nice to get a good laugh in this heat.<eos> I need a laugh.<eos> It's too hot not to laugh.<eos> Lord knows it!<eos> You do.
I want to leave one set of footprints.<eos> That is a perfect plan, but I'm not going to do that.<eos> Oh, hello, old friend.<eos> Funny seeing you here.<eos> Tick-tock.<eos> Almost audition time.<eos> - Hey, Cece.<eos> - Huh? You know that thing you said before about you not being talented enough?<eos> You didn't mean that, right?<eos> Yeah, I did.
Is this... is this here?<eos> Or is it more here?<eos> Your frame?<eos> Because I don't want to just be like, you know, a head that's like...<eos> Scientists have discovered a new kind of butter.<eos> Fly in the Amazon.<eos> What the crap does that mean?<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry.<eos> You don't...
Maybe they give out of the kindness of their hearts.<eos> No. Good day, Doctor.<eos> 16-year-old boy.<eos> Fell downstairs.<eos> Minor burns, no K.O.<eos> Hey. How you doing, buddy?<eos> Fine. I fell.<eos> This is all probably overkill.<eos> Did you see the incident, sir?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Listen, Robert, you can't do this to yourself.<eos> When she wakes up, she's gonna be devastated that she lost another one.<eos> The last one.<eos> Or...<eos> Maybe losing the last one is the best thing that could have happened to you both.<eos> Look at you.<eos> When is the last time you held her hand like that?<eos> You love her.<eos> Maybe you forgot that.<eos> I do.
Confidential informants, uh, in radical mosques have worse odds of paying off than a Tijuana slot machine.<eos> Well, you get a huge percentage of them going double agent, you waste thousands of man-hours and put lives in danger in the bargain.<eos> But everybody uses them.<eos> You don't?<eos> As little as possible.<eos> And you don't.<eos> You don't have mosques in the Financial District.<eos> No, but Thornton and Kellen certainly have informants in mosques.<eos> You didn't share these doubts with them.<eos> No, I didn't.
And you're a self-serving narcissist.<eos> Oh, slightly domineering.<eos> Also Stefan's type.<eos> Much better.<eos> I had to get you healthy so we can do the transfer spell.<eos> Yeah, about that.<eos> There you are.<eos> Hey, check out the sky.<eos> The bartender has a theory.<eos> Of course he does.
Stop it.<eos> It's too strong, you won't be able...<eos> I will not let her put you in this Hell Stone!<eos> If you don't stop, you will die.<eos> I'm already dead, my love.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> No, this is all on me.<eos> I tried to have it all.<eos> Next time, it'll be different.<eos> Nora, don't!
Wait, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Are you recording this?<eos> I'm a vlogger.<eos> My... my followers want to know everything that happens to me.<eos> Sorry, what did you say your names were?<eos> You ask anyone at 1PP, Hank Abraham was a political appointee.<eos> He was never one of us.<eos> No one's losing any sleep over him.<eos> Well, we all did.
Are you thinking vote rigging?<eos> Could be.<eos> Schakowsky knew, Nora knew.<eos> - Did Ruth know?<eos> - No, she joined the campaign long after that.<eos> - Ah. - Unless Peter told her.<eos> Campaign managers push their candidates to admit all before signing on.<eos> So, Ruth... might... have... known.<eos> Aha. So, the question is,<eos> - did she?
It was cutting off the oxygen to his brain.<eos> It's why he fell.<eos> But they did an angioplasty, and it sounds like it went well.<eos> He got out about an hour ago.<eos> That's great.<eos> That's good news.<eos> Kelly... they call that kind of blockage a "widow-maker."<eos> If they hadn't found it,<eos> Eddie could've been dead within a week.<eos> They did.
- Yes, we are.<eos> - No, the other prisoners, I helped them.<eos> With Peter, we have a connection and I never had it with anybody else.<eos> Peter was very special.<eos> - You know, according to his rap sheet, he's a forger and a swindler.<eos> - Yes, and that's the problem.<eos> He left prison with a price on his head.<eos> A man promised to kill him if he didn't pay back $50,000 he took.<eos> - And he came to you.<eos> - Of course he did.
Lee is back.<eos> That's George de Mohrenschildt.<eos> He's CIA.<eos> This might be the start of the whole thing.<eos> General Walker.<eos> I have something to say!<eos> Why come to a little place like Jodie when there's plenty of teaching jobs in Dallas?<eos> I didn't really take to the city.<eos> Call me Deke.<eos> All my faculty does.
I'd be delighted.<eos> Bill, Bill!<eos> Come on.<eos> How often have you been coming here?<eos> Jesus.<eos> Have a drink.<eos> It's a party.<eos> Do you... you realize how badly you're messing things up right now?<eos> How do you know I'm not making them better?<eos> You don't.
Great idea.<eos> Perfect way to relieve some of that stress.<eos> What stress?<eos> There's no stress.<eos> Whoa, calm down, man!<eos> It's okay, I'm your brother.<eos> So what if this move is too much, too soon.<eos> Too much, too soon?<eos> Who said that?<eos> Well, you just did, for one.
- Uh, I'm not sure.<eos> - Well, you closed last night, so...<eos> - Yeah, um...<eos> I don't know, who cares?<eos> I'll clean it up.<eos> - I just don't- I don't know why you left a big pile of rags right there.<eos> - Uh, I had to close, and yeah, so there's a pile of rags that I left, and I'll clean it up before we open.<eos> How's this a mystery?<eos> - Pete, the place is always perfect every time you close, so I thought you must have a reason.<eos> - So, I didn't.
- No, don't.<eos> No, uh-uh, not now.<eos> (sighs)<eos> - Well, I-<eos> - Bad job, buddy, real bad.<eos> Yeah, real bad.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, no, you don't know.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - You don't.
Oh.<eos> _ Oh, yeah, well, you know what?<eos> I'll take it. Yeah.<eos> Oh, be right back.<eos> It's Rafael. He was meeting his brother.<eos> Sorry. Look, I think Derek's telling the truth.<eos> I don't think he knew.<eos> Wait. What are you talking about?<eos> You can't know that already.<eos> Well, I do.
Well, under the circumstances, that may take a while.<eos> So, giving your childhood BFF the grand tour?<eos> Well, I've been here before.<eos> Are these walls more orange than I remember?<eos> So, what was it like being military kids, moving to a new base every few years?<eos> It had its ups and downs.<eos> Got to meet a few nice people along the way.<eos> Yeah. Plus, we got to travel the world.<eos> Do you remember our train ride to Austria?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
afraid to go to the kitchen to get a glass of water because I know my dad might still be awake.<eos> I'm sorry, Norman.<eos> You know I love you, don't you?<eos> I know, Daddy. I know, Daddy.<eos> It's okay, Norman.<eos> Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.
I know, Daddy. I know, Daddy.<eos> It's okay, Norman.<eos> Remember, you're just watching.<eos> You can get up and leave anytime you like.<eos> I'm right here, Norman.<eos> I thought you didn't want to be seen with me.<eos> I don't.<eos> Pick it up.<eos> How much money do you want?<eos> I don't...
And you... You may be special with your fancy contacts and all, but you ain't more special than the president of the United States.<eos> Do you honestly think the president of the United States will have anything to do with you, Ronnie?<eos> !<eos> You are protecting someone who doesn't even remember you.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> She squashed you like a bug 11 years ago, and she never looked back.<eos> She doesn't think about you.<eos> She doesn't visit you.<eos> She doesn't care about you.<eos> Yes, she does.
Those are Glen's kids, not yours, and they lost their mom.<eos> That's what happened to them.<eos> Bu anything you give them is plus.<eos> They got to be with you, okay?<eos> If you leave, it doesn't mean that they give that back.<eos> Just because you pull out doesn't mean that you weren't- that you were never there.<eos> - Boy, you really have a skill at justifying horrible things.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't know what to do.<eos> - No, you don't.
- I can't find the pulse.<eos> - He won't have one.<eos> LVAD's the pump. It bypasses the heart.<eos> His device must have failed.<eos> His heart's too weak to pump blood on its own.<eos> That's why his lungs are soaked.<eos> Prepping now.<eos> I got a 14 and a 16 standing by.<eos> The LVAD battery.<eos> He did this to himself.
Tell me about black circles on ships.<eos> He's hiding something.<eos> What's so precious about those marked ships?<eos> Why would Peng go to all this trouble?<eos> Why are you still protecting Peng?<eos> After everything he's done to you?<eos> I know nothing.<eos> Nothing. Nothing!<eos> That look like a hull number to you?<eos> Yes, it does.
Put the tater tots back, finish your tacos, wash your hands, dinner's almost ready! Ah!<eos> And I saw you grab those mini donuts. Put 'em down right now.<eos> I cannot believe the conversations I have in this room.<eos> I thought cooking was supposed to be relaxing.<eos> --Oh, no.<eos> Don't put that song on and disappear into Rory's room. Hey!<eos> At least turn it down!<eos> -Did my boxes get here? -Behind the rack.<eos> Great!<eos> So, you finally did it, huh?
-It sounds really fun.<eos> I just hope the show is as successful as Taylor needs it to be!<eos> Once again, warn us.<eos> It's really got to pack 'em in!<eos> If Taylor really wanted to pack 'em in, he should get up on that stage and dance around --in his floppy Taylor underpants.<eos> Was so out of context.<eos> So, who's up for being on the advisory committee?<eos> -Me.<eos> -Me, too.<eos> -I'll do it.
It wasn't me, Dr. Shane.<eos> Uh, and you can do exactly what I told her.<eos> You're doing great.<eos> - Dr. Shane.<eos> - You got the file.<eos> - Great. - Yeah, you know what?<eos> I've actually been getting referrals for patients all by myself for years now.<eos> Patient's presenting with severe pelvic pain and night sweats.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, you're chief of surgery, but I think I still control what patients I take on.<eos> Well, of course you do, Alex.
Was the intercourse...<eos> The most romantic, amazing night of my life?<eos> No. Vaginal.<eos> - Okay. You know what?<eos> Maybe you can actually fill this out.<eos> It's just fascinating.<eos> We had a pair of conjoined twins born in Cleveland Clinic.<eos> I was part of the team that worked on them for 20 hours.<eos> They nearly didn't survive.<eos> They... they rarely do.
Doc, can you please just tell her that this is crazy?<eos> I don't know anything about it, so...<eos> You know my chances of surviving this, right?<eos> Tell him that.<eos> We don't give percentages here.<eos> Well, then let me put it another way.<eos> Is there a chance that she could live?<eos> Of course.<eos> But you need to believe that you can.<eos> I do.
I know.<eos> We talked a lot.<eos> But just as friends.<eos> She finally told me about being raped.<eos> She said I was the first guy she felt safe with since it happened.<eos> So... how do you jump from that to "Want to grab a drink sometime?"<eos> I'm the last guy you want to take advice on women from.<eos> So what now?<eos> She had a case for self-defense.<eos> She still does.
Regularly.<eos> But she would never steal money from her own charity.<eos> And she damn sure wasn't involved in trying to kill anyone.<eos> Patton, you're too close.<eos> Come on!<eos> You got to admit there are a lot of unanswered questions.<eos> We need to check Kayla out.<eos> That's just what we do.<eos> We need to look into her personal computer.<eos> No, we don't.
I escaped into the night.<eos> Before he caught up with me, I've...<eos> I found a barn full of horses.<eos> [Sighing] I tore apart every single one.<eos> Nothing I could do to stop it.<eos> And so why are we here? We should go back home where Alexei can't hurt anyone, where it's safe.<eos> We give Elena time.<eos> We let her absorb what I've told her, okay?<eos> We don't have time.<eos> Alexei doesn't.
Because you're a mom.<eos> No. Because I know you, David Rossi.<eos> You told me what you were like back then.<eos> Nothing came between you and the job.<eos> Yeah--yeah, but I might have put it on hold if it meant I got the chance to raise a daughter like Joy.<eos> Well, yeah, it's easy to say that now because you know who Joy turned out to be.<eos> But 30 years ago, would you have really put your career on hold for diapers and teething and all-night crying fits?<eos> Look, Hayden had to make a call, and maybe it was the wrong call, but don't pretend like you don't understand why she made it.<eos> You know I say this out of love, right?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Oh. Born and raised in L.A.<eos> Former Army Special Forces.<eos> Says here he's working overseas.<eos> He has an aunt that lives in Pasadena.<eos> We should go talk to her, see if she knows anything.<eos> Sure, we could do that.<eos> Or we could just pretend you never found this.<eos> Fine.<eos> But my dad wants to know what happened during his missing time.<eos> Of course he does.
Pretty much.<eos> Diane thinks the firm needs to be defined.<eos> It needs an identity.<eos> She's not wrong.<eos> All-service firms tend to do too much.<eos> No one knows what they're about.<eos> So an all-women firm.<eos> Does anybody want an all-women firm?<eos> An all-women partner firm.<eos> Some people do.
Yes, I'm scared.<eos> I don't like that I can't remember. I don't like that I go away.<eos> But I am also glad...<eos> Glad that I'm taking the medication... I hope it helps... and mostly, above everything else,<eos> I am so glad that I have you.<eos> I don't want to lose you, Dr. Edwards.<eos> I don't want to leave here and have you not care about me.<eos> But don't you think that it's possible that I might make even more progress if I'm near the person who makes me feel complete and whole and safe?<eos> With you, and with her, I really think that I can get better. I...<eos> I really, really do.
I'm, uh,<eos> I'm actually magical.<eos> I'm a unicorn.<eos> - You're a unicorn?<eos> - What?<eos> Is that what you said?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You said... you... Did you say you were a unicorn?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You did!
Works as a bellhop at the Park Chancery Hotel.<eos> Park Chancery?<eos> Yeah, they're going to call him to testify<eos> Virginia Johnson and I have been meeting at the Park Chancery.<eos> I would be willing to discuss a plea.<eos> I know what you did, Bill, and I know why you did it.<eos> Finally we are back where we belong, together.<eos> I should have called first. I know.<eos> Did I leave something at the office?<eos> Did you...?
'Cause a flamethrower is at least fun.<eos> ...working with your grandfather actually,<eos> Edwin Earp, to handle things up here.<eos> Hmm... yeah. A one-year wonder.<eos> Family legend has it Eddie was only the heir for like 11 months, but came real close to sending all 77 of Wyatt's kills back to Hell.<eos> 77, huh?<eos> That's how many outlaws we'll have to put down?<eos> - Yeah, give or take a 7.<eos> - So what about your dad?<eos> - How many revenants did he...?
!<eos> Easy, Marty.<eos> The witch chose us three for a reason.<eos> Each of us guarding a different piece of the puzzle!<eos> I knew about the hand, Gary hid the stupid book; now I need you to get your piece!<eos> We didn't trust each other and now look what I done!<eos> Put down the knife!<eos> The heir's gonna help us!<eos> I do know the numbers.<eos> 'Least, I did!
- Yeah, the-the note I sent you at the hospital with the roses... the two dozen long-stemmed roses.<eos> There was no note, no roses.<eos> No, the-the roses I left at the hospital.<eos> It was after visiting hours, so I gave them to the nurse, and told her to prop the note up where you'd be sure to see it.<eos> Well, she didn't.<eos> I didn't get it.<eos> And I didn't understand what I had done.<eos> Why you pulled away.<eos> Well, I-I was waiting for you to say... uh, something.<eos> And when you... when you didn't...
Our talents have... have been overlooked and undermined by a-a lounge singer with a degree in typing.<eos> That woman trusted us with these clients.<eos> And we've been asked to take the lead on the homosexual study.<eos> That's an exciting piece of research, which will yield a paper or two or three.<eos> A year from now, our names will be beside Masters and Johnson in respected medical journals.<eos> Why shouldn't our names stand on their own?<eos> Especially if we are doing most of the work?<eos> Come on, Art. You-you studied at Kinsey.<eos> You know more about homosexuality than either of them do.<eos> Why not do the study at our own clinic?
I mean till 5:00 the next morning.<eos> I... couldn't believe it when my feet were hurting, 'cause... felt like they never touched the ground.<eos> You want to dance?<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> I know that the work you did with your husband... the work I encouraged you to do... that's the reason we're here.<eos> I'm the one who made the mistake of coming to you, thinking that my marriage could change, that things could be different.<eos> They still can.<eos> I know what my marriage is, 'cause I made it that way.<eos> Maybe if he had the keys that night... but he didn't.<eos> I did.
Because grown-up lives are just impossibly complicated.<eos> Because I loved Virginia, and as much as I tried, I just couldn't change that feeling.<eos> Well, then you-you weren't trying hard enough.<eos> I was, John.<eos> Look, I'm... look, I'm not saying I'm blameless.<eos> It's far from it.<eos> I have made many mistakes, but that doesn't mean there isn't love in it.<eos> I love you... and Jenny and Howie.<eos> And I did love your mother.<eos> I still do.
Sorry I messed up your life so bad!<eos> Jennifer, that is not what I meant!<eos> And I'm sorry I'm screwing my life up, too!<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to say it...<eos> "This is not what we do, Jenny"!<eos> It's not.<eos> You screwed this up.<eos> She needed to know all the risks.<eos> - No, she didn't.
Welcome back, Kyle.<eos> I showed you my moves.<eos> Time to show us yours.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Your turn to free-style.<eos> This wasn't my fault.<eos> Telling the mother.<eos> Stress doesn't just cause arteries to rupture.<eos> - You know that.<eos> - I do.
This is the second one.<eos> I do not know why this is happening.<eos> I harvested two blood vessels this time just to make sure that it wouldn't...<eos> I was so careful to avoid clotting, but it's still just...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> This isn't your fault, you know.<eos> Maybe my face just doesn't like forehead flaps.<eos> Hey. You will figure this out.<eos> You always do.
No.<eos> We're so careful all the time.<eos> You want to play Go Fish?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on, Mom!<eos> Ma'am, I do need to advise you against this.<eos> Advice taken.<eos> Do you have a tray?<eos> No, ma'am, I don't.
You want to play Go Fish?<eos> No.<eos> Let's go!<eos> Come on, Mom!<eos> Ma'am, I do need to advise you against this.<eos> Advice taken.<eos> Do you have a tray?<eos> No, ma'am, I don't.<eos> You're gonna have a hard time keeping up.<eos> Ma'am, I really don't...
To help us find our killers.<eos> Look, Lee, if we're going all in on this partner thing you're just gonna have to accept that there's gonna be times that I know more than you.<eos> This is one of those times, okay?<eos> And right now, I just need you to have faith and trust that I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Okay! Alright, man.<eos> We just shared a connection.<eos> We just dropped bedrock.<eos> Okay, we just laid a foundation for our house that is our partnership.<eos> And Captain Cole approve of this?<eos> She did. She definitely did.
The secretary was a spy.<eos> She just disappeared.<eos> I guess it was really hard for Mr. Beeman to talk to her father.<eos> I-I just went over there looking for Henry, and he... he started telling me this stuff.<eos> Can I drive?<eos> I need more practice.<eos> That's Dad's job.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> No, we don't.
Question two... who's the second season winner on "American Idol"?<eos> Anything?<eos> I was three.<eos> Aw, fuck!<eos> Chemical Brothers for number one, and Ruben Studdard for number two.<eos> This.<eos> God! "Sommersby."<eos> You... where did you even get this?<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, no, I don't.
Whoa, whoa, whoa! Please release the sloth.<eos> Look, look, we'll find your eggs and we'll get 'em back by morning.<eos> Or you can draw and quarter him tomorrow.<eos> I'm not saying they should.<eos> Can we tar and feather him?<eos> No! It'll get all over my cave.<eos> What if we feed him to the reptile!<eos> Get that horny toad!<eos> Look, I appreciate your ideas, but Sid didn't take your eggs!<eos> Then who did?
Justin wanted to see a rocket launch at Cape Canaveral.<eos> Two days out, she cancels.<eos> Why?<eos> Justin's bio final was pushed up.<eos> She said the trip could wait.<eos> They'd get down there soon enough.<eos> I found these in Justin's drawer.<eos> Two tickets to Florida for next month.<eos> She thought she had time.<eos> We all do.
Are you crazy?<eos> Dr. Pinkney.<eos> Heather.<eos> Senator, I really need you to sit.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> It wasn't a bomb.<eos> Gas leak.<eos> My wife, Hank Wesley, all those good people hurt because of a rusty valve.<eos> This doesn't make sense, does it?<eos> No, it doesn't.
Oh, I've always valued education over money.<eos> And the very fact that you needed a written guarantee of respect made me realize how dismissive I've been of your contributions.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> And I just hope that this scholarship can rescue your child from the subpar education and menial life of an engineer.<eos> Sheldon. What?<eos> I didn't sign it yet.<eos> I hear what you're saying, but I've known Emily a long time, and I think she deserves the benefit of the doubt.<eos> All right, it's your life.<eos> But you know how this is gonna end.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
Then we can sue their asses.<eos> With what lawyers, what resources, and what money?<eos> Because I don't know if you noticed, but this firm has been gutted because of your recommendation.<eos> No, Jessica, it was gutted because of mine.<eos> Damn it, Louis.<eos> I told you not to call him.<eos> Well, I did.<eos> Because he's a partner, and like he just said, he was the one who wanted to sever the noncompetes in the first place.<eos> You're right, Louis.<eos> I did.
Jesus Christ, get me out of here.<eos> This is so awesome.<eos> I mean, I haven't been this stress-free since I took gold in the Math-lympics and Esther went to fat camp in the same week.<eos> Esther went to fat camp?<eos> They called it Violin All-Stars, but we all know what that's code for.<eos> And if you so much as picture her in a school-girl outfit.<eos> Come on, Louis, we're all feeling good.<eos> You telling me you never slipped up and had an inappropriate relationship?<eos> Louis, I do not want to know the answer to that.<eos> I did.
- No. Look, I'm gonna get back to my food, but if you think of an answer, you let me know.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Did you get a chance to read the handbook?<eos> - I intend to.<eos> - I can also email it to you.<eos> Okay. Or I can give you a hard copy at dinner next week.<eos> Next week?<eos> Yeah, we get together every Thursday to go over lesson plans and activities.<eos> You're gonna love it.<eos> We all do.
It's my specialty.<eos> It's on me.<eos> And I am trying.<eos> I just, I don't know how to make...<eos> So if we had another practice run and we were in the cadaver lab and you had all the time in the world, where would you start?<eos> We don't have time!<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Okay. So what's the first thing you would do?<eos> I don't know!<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, this is not a social visit, Mrs. Heck.<eos> My latest AmeriCorps gig has me working at a nursing home, so my caretaking skills are on point.<eos> I brought Jell-O in dinosaur shapes.<eos> Although, when I go to the old people's home<eos> I cut them in the shape of grandchildren.<eos> - But I alre... - Oh, tch, tch, tch!<eos> Don't worry, Mrs. Heck.<eos> Think of this like "Downton Abbey" and I'm one of the basement people.<eos> You won't have to do a thing.<eos> And I didn't.
I'm sending you these flowers for no reason."<eos> Oh, heck, I'm not gonna bore you with the rest.<eos> The point is, I'm dating, so no pressure for you.<eos> Great. Thanks.<eos> If you see Alan, tell him I need him.<eos> So, uh... I made it clear I'm dating, right?<eos> Or should I give myself a hickey with the vacuum cleaner?<eos> Gabi said you needed me?<eos> Remember how you told me not to go back to my therapist?<eos> - I did. - And?
They're really strong.<eos> Bitch, please.<eos> You think Lil So So is afraid of a little chronic?<eos> Oh, my damn!<eos> Gabi, come on in!<eos> Oh, my damn!<eos> Oh! Oh, my damn! Oh, my damn!<eos> Yay! We're having a baby!<eos> - You have my blessing.<eos> Yes. - We do?
But you can't talk to them.<eos> You know what they'll say?<eos> They'll say you went crazy 'cause Eli was stepping out behind your back.<eos> They'll know that he didn't want to have kids.<eos> They'll say that you snapped Courtney's neck because you couldn't handle being a mother, and then what?<eos> Look at all those parents whose kids disappeared.<eos> They spend years in court trying to clear their name.<eos> How did you know Courtney's neck was snapped?<eos> Well, you told me.<eos> No, I didn't.
No.<eos> Why?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Um, I just wanted to see how you guys were doing.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> - She knows.<eos> - Knows?<eos> April knows.<eos> - What?<eos> - Doesn't she?
I just asked him to keep it to himself.<eos> What, keep it to himself?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> That I'm seeing people.<eos> That I'm dating.<eos> That I went on a date.<eos> So, April knows, huh?<eos> Uh, that you're seeing other people.<eos> - Does April know? - No!<eos> N... She doesn't.
I can't believe that Arizona would say...<eos> When did you know?<eos> How far along are you, April?<eos> I'm 12 weeks.<eos> 12 weeks.<eos> I was coming to tell you...<eos> When did you know?<eos> Did you know before the divorce?<eos> Did you know before we signed those papers?<eos> Yes, I did.
Hi. Uh, good morning.<eos> Um, we're gonna take the next one.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe next time, be a little more specific.<eos> You know how long it's been since I saw your mother?<eos> No idea, sir.<eos> Too long!<eos> Her plane lands any minute.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure that trip's a complete coincidence, right?<eos> Nothing to do with me or... her or...
So she shouldn't be asked to dumb things down, okay?<eos> Murphy, can you do the next step?<eos> I can try, but if Dr. Pierce is more comfortable stepping in...<eos> I guarantee you she is, but you will be more comfortable after you do it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now that we've stabilized the heart, we will administer esmolol to slow the heart rate for better control.<eos> Right, now go ahead and incise the diseased artery.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> I don't...
Back to the right, room three.<eos> The ladies are from the Chamber of Commerce.<eos> Both have been background-checked.<eos> BAI:<eos> I love it.<eos> Sam, what song will you sing?<eos> No, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm working, sir.<eos> Do you like Broadway show tunes?<eos> Of course, who doesn't?
All right, let's get our bearings.<eos> Oh, man, that's Cook.<eos> That's a problem.<eos> Uh, he's gonna want this weapon of mass destruction.<eos> What do we do?<eos> I have a plan.<eos> What the hell did you guys do back there?<eos> The whole place is lit up.<eos> Did you get the scepter?<eos> We did.
Does it bother you?<eos> A bit.<eos> This fallen woman is dragging you down.<eos> You know what's weird?<eos> I'm more judgmental about my daughter's Christianity than yours.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You're a bad person.<eos> I don't want you to feel like you're doing wrong when you're with me.<eos> Yeah, you do.
And when the chips fall, it's important you know who your friends are.<eos> Is that clear enough?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Stop the cart.<eos> What's down there?<eos> Uh... just an old bunker...<eos> I want to see it.<eos> I don't have any keys.<eos> We do.
Threw it away?<eos> Then how did it...<eos> Did you pull all of his things out of the trash after he put them there?<eos> Well, yes.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> That's weird, Mom.<eos> Isn't that weird?<eos> I'm not getting involved.<eos> He was a little... unstable at the time, and I was afraid he might regret his decision.<eos> Did he?
Elliot Rollins was last seen in Baltimore.<eos> We deliberately pointed the police towards Philly.<eos> That's where the trail was supposed to end.<eos> Somebody knows what I did.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Aria, I called you last night after you went to Ezra's. Yeah.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't get back to you.<eos> Well, is everything okay?<eos> Did he find out about the Nicole call?<eos> No, he didn't.
I haven't told anyone about this.<eos> I had a dream about you.<eos> When I was in that place with A.D.<eos> I was so tired and scared.<eos> I wanted to give up.<eos> And then suddenly, there you are.<eos> You were all smart and preppy and ready to hatch an escape plan.<eos> I really wish I could have been there, Hanna.<eos> I wish that I could have helped you.<eos> You did.
Ben: Ugh, for the last time, no!<eos> Angela's not gonna see Emma.<eos> I don't wanna talk about it anymore, okay?<eos> Okay!<eos> But she is Emma's biological mother, and if she wanted to... Sorry.<eos> It wouldn't make you any less of a father if you just...<eos> I just wish I got to know my real mom before...<eos> Okay.<eos> You really think it's good for Emma?<eos> I do.
You're right.<eos> You're actually handy to have around.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Lovely of you to say.<eos> Crowley, ticktock. You with us?<eos> The crux of your dispute is your contention that Lucifer, and only Lucifer, can use the Horn to beat Amara, right?<eos> You got it.<eos> Well, that scenario only works if you actually possess said Horn, which you do not.<eos> No, we don't. But you do, so --<eos> Exactly! I do!
Awesome!<eos> (gasps)<eos> Break out the booze! We're doing shots!<eos> No, no shots.<eos> MEN: Shot! Shot!<eos> Shot!<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR:<eos> Truthbetold, ifDerekknewhis boat wasbeingsearched, heprobablywouldn't feelsobuoyed.<eos> SeewhatIdid there?<eos> Butalas,he doesn't.
Tobias Church... A.K.A. "Charon."<eos> The "Ferryman of Hades."<eos> Left gold coins on the eyes of one of his victims last night.<eos> I didn't fail every course that I took in college.<eos> Warrants out for his arrest on no less than 20 murders, and those are just the ones that they can connect him to.<eos> Mr. Church just became our top priority.<eos> "Our" is not going to be enough for this guy.<eos> Church runs with a crew, and yours is not coming back.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> Whatever's inside that vault, promise me you won't set free.<eos> We need to know exactly what we're dealing with so we can fight it.<eos> You can't fight it.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then, no, you don't.
While she was dying of cancer.<eos> I think we have a winner.<eos> What do I win?<eos> You get to die the most painful, excruciating death imaginable.<eos> - And me?<eos> - We grant you mercy.<eos> You'll die quick.<eos> It'll be over before you...<eos> I'll deal with this one.<eos> You do the honors?
We were in MI6 together.<eos> He just phoned.<eos> It turns out that the job wasn't legit.<eos> Something bigger is going on, something bad enough that he told me to go Code 44.<eos> Uh, what does Code 44 mean?<eos> It means abandon everything and everyone.<eos> It means run for your life and don't look back.<eos> You can't do that.<eos> - I have no choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Because I have been keeping something from you that your subconscious mind picked up on and caused you to have a dream that I betrayed you in some way.<eos> Castle, I thought that we said we weren't gonna keep any more secrets.<eos> I know, and I just...<eos> I consider this more of a surprise than a secret.<eos> But I should have known better than to try and surprise the world's greatest detective, after Batman.<eos> W-What's behind the sheet?<eos> Kate... you've been going through a lot of changes these past few years.<eos> You gave up your place, you got married, and you became a captain.<eos> But some of the things that you love have fallen by the wayside, including one thing that's been gathering dust in your father's garage.<eos> - You didn't?
Yeah, I keep it.<eos> Keep it as a reminder to not trust the wrong people.<eos> Well, you're not doing too well, sister.<eos> Enzo has been there for me!<eos> Every single day.<eos> Hiding me.<eos> Protecting me.<eos> Poisoning you!<eos> He'll figure it out!<eos> And what if he doesn't?
Previously on The Vampire Diaries...<eos> I have a family, Matt.<eos> So did I.
Bonnie doesn't have that luxury.<eos> So go to her.<eos> I can't. I can't give up.<eos> I'm not asking you to give up.<eos> I need to make sure that she doesn't.<eos> Thanks for getting back to me.<eos> I'll admit, I was surprised to see you on my phone sheet.<eos> Is there something I can do for you, Damon?<eos> I have a rather lengthy list of hell stone rejects that I need killed posthaste, and I hear you have the resources to do it.<eos> I do.
All the deaths that were covered up as animal attacks.<eos> The more I dug, the less sense it made.<eos> So what did you find?<eos> That there was at least one vampire in Mystic Falls the night Penny died.<eos> It was you.<eos> Yeah, I was there.<eos> I came back for the anniversary of the sheriff's death.<eos> I knew it'd be a hard day for Caroline, and I thought there would be a good chance she'd show up, and if she did, I wanted to be there for her.<eos> But she didn't show, did she?<eos> No, she never did.
Come on, Bonnie.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Let me guess:<eos> It's an ancient, tentacled evil that will destroy our lives and the world as we know it.<eos> Don't be ridiculous.<eos> No tentacles.<eos> Do I even want to know?<eos> Will it deter you from going in?<eos> Nope.<eos> Then no, you don't.
And how are we supposed to keep Amara busy while we're... liberating Lucifer?<eos> Thank you for reaching out to me, Dean.<eos> You said you wanted to meet.<eos> I missed you.<eos> sensations you arouse.<eos> I know you feel the same way.<eos> So...what do we do?<eos> There can be no us.<eos> We should just walk away.<eos> Then why don't you?
Brother, I...<eos> In the beginning... it was just you and me, and we were family.<eos> I loved you, and I thought -- I knew... that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.<eos> But then you went and you made all these other things.<eos> I hated you for needing something else, something that wasn't me.<eos> And then you locked me away, and all I could think about was making you suffer.<eos> You had your reasons.<eos> I did.
He claimed I was cold, emasculating, and hadn't shown him any physical affection for years.<eos> I was wrong, there's three excuses for that.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> It's working.<eos> You sure?<eos> Look.<eos> The system is maintaining its own stability, the quantum vortex apparatus is now controlling the orientation.<eos> You're right.<eos> You realize what this means?<eos> I do.
That's right, baby!<eos> We in you, Atlantic city! -So, what's our plan?<eos> Drink enough to forget that gay Aiden's getting straight married?<eos> Drunk enough to forget men exist.<eos> Except for us, right?<eos> 'Cause we're the woke ones.<eos> Hey. Uh, can I just say how happy this makes me, that we can hang out and not make this weird?<eos> Uh, what?<eos> You thought I couldn't do that?<eos> Of - - Of course I did.
Okay.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Can I crash here for a while?<eos> We're screwing.<eos> Brought dinner.<eos> I'm not hungry.<eos> Well, then you can watch me eat.<eos> Nate's staying over tonight.<eos> I'm just telling you so you don't have to worry about me.<eos> I don't.
He was absent from class today.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll check in with his other professors, then.<eos> Wallace Mahoney was an old client of mine, someone who was out of my life.<eos> And they think Wes shot him?<eos> His father?<eos> Biological father.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You knew about this.<eos> -Of course she did.
Down to no underwear, even with the both-sides trick.<eos> Ugh, gonna vomit.<eos> So, how's spring practice coming?<eos> Who's looking good?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You guys thinking of running the pistol again this year?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Hey, did you get your physical yet with Dr. Nagel for next season?<eos> It's tomorrow.<eos> So, how you doing?
Yeah, but I had already spoken to Vishwa, we'll<eos> Falak, where is that ***** Minal, I want her to apologise.<eos> Peflod!<eos> Rajvir, please...<eos> Please don't talk like that.<eos> Look...don't lecture me on morality.<eos> Get that ***** on the line, now!<eos> Don't you get it ...<eos> I don't have a problem with you.<eos> But I do!
Carry on, Mr. Deepak.<eos> Okay, let me ask you another question? .<eos> Once you saw that Minal is making a drink for herself Didn't you feel that she might be one of 'those' girls and you should leave!<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Do women in your family drink alcohol?<eos> Only the men drink.<eos> Your mother?<eos> Your sister?<eos> Do they drink?<eos> Women from good family don't!
I'm gonna go check.<eos> You should come with me.<eos> Huh? To the engagement party.<eos> What better way to show Jordan and Sarah how happy we are together?<eos> - But first, kimchi.<eos> Do you do this often?<eos> Invite women that you barely know onto hotel roofs?<eos> Would you believe me if I told you you were the first?<eos> And hey, I do know you.<eos> - Oh, you do? - Sure.
What... what do we think?<eos> Too short for a room full of pediatricians?<eos> No. They're used to two-year-olds running around the waiting room,<eos> - What?<eos> Emojis.<eos> Two beers, a frog, and a-a crying cat.<eos> Harry?<eos> What's the matter? I just...<eos> I don't know. - I should have said no.<eos> - Why didn't you?
It was just a minor fluctuation in the electrostatic field generated by the core.<eos> It looks like one of our secondary capacitors failed.<eos> Backup systems kicked in.<eos> There's nothing to worry about.<eos> All right, let me know if there are any other problems.<eos> I will.<eos> Nothing to worry about?<eos> I was wondering when you were gonna show up.<eos> You do know why the capacitor failed.<eos> Yes, I do.
You could brand 'em, stick 'em out in a field, and they just stand there until they're ready to die.<eos> Beau?<eos> I never thought I'd say this.<eos> You talk too much.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Hey, would you say I'm a silver fox?<eos> Oh! Got 'em.<eos> Drake, fetch.<eos> Now even the dog likes you better?<eos> Of course he does.
- Load 'Er up.<eos> - Yes. Don't encourage him, please.<eos> Yo, I got to make up for lost time.<eos> Baz left me with Nevins, holding my dick.<eos> Did you want me to sit next to your bed, holding your hand?<eos> - Is that it? - And change my bed pan?<eos> Yeah. That would've been nice.<eos> Hey, Craig, you want to make some money?<eos> Old times' sake?<eos> No, he doesn't. He doesn't.
This is business, baby. That's it.<eos> Just a guy you call when you need something up north?<eos> No.<eos> You're an old friend who's doing me a favor... because I paid you.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> How's Craig? Fine.<eos> That's all I get?<eos> Look, my boys don't know about this, and I don't want 'em to.<eos> He still look like me?<eos> He never did.
Okay, you know what?<eos> You wanna go? Then go.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> Okay.<eos> Remember when he wasn't an asshole?<eos> Okay. Ready?<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Thank you.<eos> I was in a car accident a few years ago, and, um... I started taking Oxy. And somewhere along the way...<eos> Yeah, my mom did heroin.
It's not like Pope's gonna do anything without his brothers anyway.<eos> I can get the kid to wear a wire, but it will take time.<eos> He just doesn't trust us enough yet, but he knows he's in danger.<eos> What about the teacher?<eos> Think he trusts her?<eos> He's a teenage boy. He might just do it for pussy.<eos> Jesus, you're not considering having her sleep with him, are you?<eos> We need him to wear a wire.<eos> Do you really give a shit how she gets him to do it?<eos> Yeah, actually, I do.
Just how well I knew James, when's the last time I saw him.<eos> See, I thought maybe he was looking for the take, too, so, I followed him home, broke in when it was clear.<eos> Saw he had one of the bags and I tried to take it, that's all.<eos> Risk all that for a...<eos> bag of bones?<eos> Bones prove where the artifacts came from.<eos> You can't sell one without the other.<eos> But that take, especially that gold ring that everybody wants so bad, must be in the other bag.<eos> You don't know where it is?<eos> If I did, brother...
I am.<eos> What about all this says "man"?<eos> What do you feel like watching?<eos> Wow, so we're just gonna pretend that didn't happen?<eos> What didn't happen?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> You couldn't stop staring at Jill's boobs.<eos> Well, what choice did I have?<eos> The damn things threw a shadow.<eos> Don't, just don't.
One, two, three.<eos> ♪ You look happy to meet me ♪ No, no, Herr Krieger, please.<eos> The Askaran Amulet is not degenerate artwork.<eos> It is a masterpiece. Which you will help my men transport to the exchange tomorrow at 01000.<eos> Refusing would meet with the Fuehrer's disapproval.<eos> ♪ Edelweiss ♪<eos> I know the Baron's plan.<eos> Heil Hitler!<eos> You did not salute the Fuehrer.<eos> Oh, yeah. Sure, I did.
No doubt, it fell out of the Temporal Zone.<eos> No sign of anyone.<eos> Well, the power core looks exposed.<eos> That mean what I think it means?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> Ah. Thought you'd never ask.<eos> Back up, everyone.<eos> Ah, what's next?<eos> Don't you think that's enough incineration for one day, Mr. Rory?<eos> No, I do not, Professor.
Ah, your man Colonel Sanders, he, uh... tells me you're his captain.<eos> In any case, he mentioned something about you having regrets about putting men in harm's way.<eos> I don't think that's something I can ever get used to.<eos> You know, by the time I had taken over this division, there had already been three other generals in place before me.<eos> They'd all stepped down and given up.<eos> But I believe in my men.<eos> And I believe in the good that we're doing.<eos> Do you?<eos> Do you believe in your mission, Captain Lance?<eos> I do.
You, Jax, and Ray, stop the train.<eos> The rest of us, we'll deal with Turnbull.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Of course.<eos> This isn't my first rodeo.<eos> @ ~ I wanted to say that.<eos> There's our train.<eos> Loaded with enough dwarf star to punch a hole in a mountain and cut off the pass to the East.<eos> How do we stop a moving locomotive?<eos> We don't.

- Oh. - That is how ideas work!<eos> People, you need a muse!<eos> I can be your muse.<eos> What about stopping all the metas on your Earth?<eos> More of an advisory role for me, but I was there.<eos> I remembered how we... you don't think that's something?<eos> Let me present you with a scenario.<eos> You're confronted with something, a threat that you've never seen before.<eos> You don't know how to stop it.<eos> Who does?
It was just you and Iris.<eos> The two of you were a brother-sister superhero crime-fighting team.<eos> Why didn't you tell us this before?<eos> You didn't want to know about your Flashpoint lives.<eos> But look, listen to me, you got hurt, all right? You got hurt bad.<eos> So what?<eos> That's that me, it's not this me.<eos> And I want to be a speedster.<eos> I... I want to be a flash.<eos> No, no, no, you don't.
Barr, it's the hospital.<eos> Julian's awake.<eos> He knows it was me. He knows what I did.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll talk to him.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> I promise.<eos> Hey, man.<eos> I just wanted to see if you wanted to talk about...<eos> I don't.
I suggest that you acquire that trait.<eos> Soon.<eos> He's gone.<eos> Traveller has been taken.<eos> I repeat, Traveller has been taken.<eos> The Dominators have the President.<eos> - Hey, son.<eos> - I don't understand, Dad.<eos> No one in this family wants me to have powers.<eos> You don't.
So Church has him.<eos> I spent most of my life thinking that men in masks were only capable of doing horrible things.<eos> I may have to reevaluate that.<eos> Let me know when Queen gets in.<eos> Will do.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I mean, I barely knew the kid, Thea.<eos> But that doesn't make it sting any less.<eos> Well, yeah, sure it does.
Such as looking for anagrams in case Prometheus was sending a message in the names of the victims he's been choosing.<eos> - Is he?<eos> - Kind of.<eos> Ahh. First 4 victims--<eos> Tobias Church, Sam Conahan, Peter Meld, and Gay Eked.<eos> Victims 3 and 4 were not random.<eos> We think Prometheus is using those names as anagrams to spell out other names.<eos> Adam Hunt, Ted Gaynor, Palmer Cokes, Sachi Beech.<eos> Those names supposed to mean anything to us?<eos> They do to him.
We have to find Claybourne.<eos> We were hoping there was something here that could help.<eos> Like ashes?<eos> Those look like crematorium ashes.<eos> The question is whose?<eos> Right.<eos> Well, I got to go, so you guys need to run a DNA test on these ashes and bone fragments to find out who this person was and why Prometheus is keeping their remains.<eos> You guys know how to run a DNA sequencer, right?<eos> No.<eos> Of course you don't.
Why do they think that?<eos> He went out to track down a lead, didn't come back, his missed his last 3 call-ins, GPS on his phone's been switched off.<eos> Do you think he's dead?<eos> I think that every cop that's crossed paths with Prometheus is.<eos> Whether or not Billy's alive-- and believe me, I hope that he is-- the ACU and the SCPD, they need instructions.<eos> Well, we've had a BOLO out for weeks.<eos> I'm not talking about a be on the lookout order.<eos> I'm talking about a shoot to kill.<eos> I don't know how that will sit with the public.<eos> I do.
Well, give me a second.<eos> Are you sure you can do this?<eos> Hey, who found four dollars and change on the beach with his metal detector?<eos> I buried it there, so we could go home.<eos> Wait, that's it.<eos> Isn't that the best?<eos> You guys made a person.<eos> We did.<eos> And I like to think I helped.<eos> You didn't.
I don't know about the rest of you, but I want to kick the crap out of that guy.<eos> Yeah, like a hundred pounds of you is gonna hurt somebody.<eos> Excuse me, but I have a beast mode you don't know about.<eos> What have I always told you?<eos> A lady doesn't use her fists.<eos> That's what cars are for.<eos> That's not gonna bring Jodi back.<eos> Yeah, but it might stop that dirtbag from killing someone else.<eos> Look, I miss Jodi as much as you all do, but Travis didn't kill her.<eos> Her addiction did.
Movies.<eos> I caught a late showing at the Cinezone in Mililani.<eos> You got anybody to back that up?<eos> No, I went alone.<eos> I don't have many friends these days since Brighton ruined my life.<eos> Okay, so what you're saying is that you have no real alibi, but plenty of motive.<eos> Look, I made a mistake.<eos> I almost went to jail for it.<eos> You really think I'd risk everything a second time?<eos> For $80 million, yes, I do.
Just a couple spoonfuls.<eos> Yeah, Kelly, come on.<eos> All right.<eos> How awesome is this?<eos> I love having roomies.<eos> It's all yours, Hirsch.<eos> Hey-o. Second responder.<eos> Yo, dude, you didn't carry that all the way up the stairs, did you?<eos> You know there's a dumbwaiter, right?<eos> No, I did not.
I'm sure Gabriel didn't tell Vanessa where he is, okay, but what if, what if she knows how to get in touch with him?<eos> Maybe that is what Brigante got out of her.<eos> And now that Michelle has Sara, she can reach out to Gabriel and offer him a deal. Right.<eos> He hands himself in, she lets the kid go.<eos> Look, I don't give a damn if we got proof or not, we need to drag Michelle Shioma in and get her to tell us where Sara is.<eos> I don't-- she's not gonna say-- tell her what?<eos> - She's not gonna say anything.<eos> - He's right.<eos> She's not gonna talk, but if we keep her out there, we can monitor her and maybe get a lead.<eos> And what if we don't, then?
Oh, I know... shut up.<eos> Look, if it's too big of a job for you, we can find someone else.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> It's impossible.<eos> Spring Hill's got mag-shields up the wazoo.<eos> Screws with all the targeting systems.<eos> Well, that's why he's here.<eos> He's got the security codes.<eos> He's right.<eos> I do.
I've called Julio six times and he still has not fixed it.<eos> Maybe it's because the super's name is Warren.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I gave our apartment key to a guy named Julio.<eos> Really?<eos> What were you doing out there, anyway?<eos> So, I was rehearsing for an audition, to be WNY-8's new weather man.<eos> Cloudy with a chance of Tucker.<eos> Wait, wait. I thought you wanted to be an entertainment reporter?<eos> I do!
You honestly have no feelings for Zoey?<eos> Okay, I guess when I saw her on the fire escape the other night...<eos> Yes, I knew it!<eos> You do, I was right.<eos> But calm down.<eos> You're forgetting something very important.<eos> She's not into me.<eos> - (elevator dings)<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Well, I do now.
Don't listen to him.<eos> He says crazy things all the time.<eos> Uh, watch.<eos> Marco.<eos> Polo!<eos> So, uh, what are you guys talking about?<eos> Your friends were just telling me about all the other girls you're dating.<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> I specifically asked you not to do that.<eos> We didn't.
-Please, Ms. Avery...<eos> No more questions.<eos> A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES [Marseille Theme Tune: Arabic vocal over pulsing rhythm]<eos> I came here for you.<eos> The lists must be delivered tomorrow night.<eos> I'll try to convince Taro to speak to you.<eos> He's the one who leaked the invoices online.<eos> Anyway, the scandal is my problem, not yours.<eos> You're not meant to know the workings of a national election!<eos> Right, and I don't, but Taro does.
Damn things can loiter at high altitude for hours.<eos> - James didn't even see them coming. - Unh-unh.<eos> They should have.<eos> We're all that's left now.<eos> So, what do we do?<eos> I want to go home, get Frankie, and just keep moving.<eos> But first, I want to kill everyone who's responsible for what just happened.<eos> Hell, yeah.<eos> - You want revenge?<eos> - You don't?
You put a suicidal mission in office, and I took advantage of it.<eos> We are public enemies number one and two.<eos> The people don't trust us.<eos> That's because they've been poisoned.<eos> We'll change their minds.<eos> You know, before the quarantine was in place in St. Louis, it was just me and 115 people in a Costco.<eos> But I was able to protect them, because they wanted more than anything to be there.<eos> Not like those broken people we saw in that shelter.<eos> Back then, ‭the people wanted to fight.<eos> They still do, sir.
But your husband must get reassigned all the time.<eos> There's no provision for military spouses?<eos> Depends on which state.<eos> Hmm. (Baby fussing) Anne: Okay, here we go.<eos> Good girl.<eos> Honestly, I would choose to stay home if I could, but when my sister was ill, we took on her medical bills, and it drained our savings.<eos> So I work during the day, and I study for the bar at night.<eos> I never meant it to affect my children this way.<eos> Do you know who broke into our house?<eos> Yeah, we do.
An identified sniper took her out.<eos> The Russians would rather have her dead than captured.<eos> That was our assumption, too.<eos> But since the target was neutralized, the mission was deemed a success.<eos> And the conveniently-timed sniper hit was just written off.<eos> Clearly someone on the inside leaked the details of the op.<eos> Which is exactly why I conducted an off-the-book investigation.<eos> All my operatives were cleared. The leak did not come from MI6, it came from NCIS.<eos> And why didn't you relay this information to morrow?<eos> I did.
Yep, I just might bring the family car by and get me a set of tires. Well, you better hurry up. Tomorrow's the last day.<eos> Dadgum. Creeps up on you, doesn't it?<eos> It does.<eos> You go easy, now.<eos> You still think he did it, Carl? Like you used to?<eos> But then, I felt pretty sure before. What's the difference?<eos> There were a lot of things that weren't known back then, or looked into.<eos> And a lot of mistakes.<eos> And no one ever even spoke to Chris Nelms that day?<eos> Never did. Unbelievable.
This interview has strayed way beyond its stated purpose.<eos> And there's a voice.<eos> There's a voice saying, "We're losing him,<eos> So, there must have been at least one person who cared whether I lived or died.<eos> That was me.<eos> That was my voice.<eos> And I did care.<eos> I thought death would be too easy for you, too easy an escape.<eos> And I didn't want you to cheat the system.<eos> And I still don't.
You're like a big, scary mama bear.<eos> I'm gonna Jackass into these melons!<eos> I'm okay.<eos> You're my mama bear, girl.<eos> I wish I had someone in my life who cared about me the way you guys care about each other.<eos> Oh, don't.<eos> - You do. - I just...<eos> I've been a cop<eos> - for five years and...<eos> - You do.
Ella Lopez.<eos> I just transferred in a couple days ago.<eos> You must be Detective Decker's civilian consultant.<eos> Cool.<eos> I was expecting a different reaction considering your choice of bling.<eos> Dude, I had a friend named Adolf.<eos> Okay, Adolf.<eos> I didn't hold it against him.<eos> And besides, I think the Devil - gets a bad rap. - Oh.<eos> - You do, do you?
She's like a bad penny... in tight leather pants.<eos> Unless, of course, you scared her away for good.<eos> I scared her away?<eos> Well, everything was fine until you went all lovey-dovey on her.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I seem to remember her telling both of us where to shove it.<eos> Luci, you don't think she helped Mom escape, do you?<eos> Well, that doesn't sound like the kind of evil, duplicitous thing a demon would do, now, does it?<eos> But, no, I don't because I found Mum.<eos> - You did?
Demons don't have friends.<eos> Someone who's been helping me do some soul-searching.<eos> What, like hunting them down and killing them?<eos> I wish.<eos> That would be a lot easier.<eos> Now that we are stuck here, I need to figure out... where I fit in.<eos> And she's been helping me do that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I knew you wouldn't understand.<eos> I barely do.
I've been blaming everybody else for the situation I'm in.<eos> I chose to do nothing when my mother was cast out.<eos> To never ask her why she did what she did.<eos> So that's on me.<eos> That's good, Lucifer.<eos> No.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, I've assumed a lot about my mother, including the fact that she wants revenge for what I did to her.<eos> - And now she doesn't?
Rick, don't sell yourself short, man.<eos> You got at least three good seasons left in you.<eos> What you think, Spence?<eos> Well, I think you already got four 100-catch seasons.<eos> No one's ever had seven. That could be you.<eos> You win a championship, you got a right to be in that Canton conversation.<eos> - You really think so?<eos> - Don't say you ain't dreamt of having that beautiful beard in bronze.<eos> Yeah, but I don't wanna get ahead of myself.<eos> Shit, well, you do it with everything else.
Father and son can snort together.<eos> What say?<eos> Where's that Nigerian?<eos> Upstairs.<eos> Put the gun down.<eos> He doesn't understand English?<eos> Tell him to put the gun down. ...or my team will beat him till he speaks all 480 languages of India<eos> Tell him!<eos> You have your passport, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
I completely understand if you don't want to take love advice from an arm wrestling champion, but why don't you just say "hi" or "I miss you"?<eos> "Hi, I miss you"?<eos> No "in my pants"?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I'll give it a shot.<eos> Hey everyb...<eos> Damn it.<eos> Do you need a hand there, Sophie?<eos> No, I got it!<eos> You really don't.
I still won.<eos> ...of how city officials and the GCPD mishandled...<eos> They really want me as mayor.<eos> Yes.<eos> I can't be bought, but I can be stolen with one glance.<eos> I'm worthless to one, but priceless to two.<eos> Love.<eos> They love me.<eos> If you would've bought the election, you would've never known.<eos> But now you do.
Dr. Calvi?<eos> We need your signature, please.<eos> Uh-huh. I'll get somebody to take the I.V. out.<eos> Half an hour, a glass of orange juice, you'll be good to go.<eos> So while I did... kill my girlfriend, who does look rather similar to you, it was not out of malice or intent.<eos> It was an accident that I deeply regret.<eos> And I was not gonna tell you this, but then...<eos> Edward,<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You do?
End of the line.<eos> Just as I suspected.<eos> The brake lines are cut!<eos> How is it... that not one single ignoramus from the GCPD noticed that the brake lines were cut?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Someone paid 'em off.<eos> The question is, who?<eos> Who has that kind of money and influence?<eos> You don't know.<eos> But I do.
- In retaliation.<eos> For exposing him as the leader of the Red Hood gang.<eos> That makes perfect sense.<eos> I swear to you, Ed, we will find him and make him pay for what he has done.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> I feel like this office is cursed.<eos> You think Barnes'll be all right?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm sorry I doubted you.<eos> You didn't.
That was a terrible move, Detective.<eos> It was, right?<eos> What were you planning to do, Chloe?<eos> Crash the christening?<eos> I don't know, Dan!<eos> I was angry.<eos> The guy killed my father.<eos> He had the nerve to smile at me.<eos> Do you have any idea what that feels like?<eos> No, I don't.
Do you think it's crazy that I wanted to talk about it?<eos> Mourn with him, maybe? !<eos> - I... - So I reached out, and guess what I got back.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Like always.<eos> So I figured that if his toys started stabbing each other with a celestial blade, that maybe he might take a moment.<eos> Humans are dying because of you.<eos> Well, humans die.<eos> They all do eventually.
Where's Lucifer?<eos> Something came up at his club.<eos> I don't think he's coming back.<eos> Oh, well, don't worry, Chloe. He never stays away for too long, right?<eos> Huh. Hey, Lucifer. So, did you splint the stubbed toe, or did you kiss it and make it better?<eos> Well, that's an interesting theory, but we don't have any evidence that Eric Cooper's the killer.<eos> Mm, actually we do.<eos> Prints just came back.<eos> Eric Cooper.<eos> How did you...?
We're past that.<eos> What I don't understand, though, is how the detective can think I'm the one who leaked sensitive information to my mum.<eos> How could she?<eos> Yeah, Chloe's the bad guy.<eos> If only I knew who really gave Mom that information.<eos> Right.<eos> If only.<eos> Oh!<eos> Good. You came.<eos> Yes, he did.
They'll keep you in for 24 hours.<eos> I won't sleep here.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> I'll come back tomorrow.<eos> - Do you know him?<eos> - He's my wife's boss.<eos> He was murdered.<eos> - You knew that already.<eos> - No, I didn't.
- Good.<eos> How're you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> - Good.<eos> You gonna invite me in?<eos> - No.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I can't afford it.<eos> Come on, you really think I'm here for money?<eos> We do, yes.
Ah, shit.<eos> Oh, shit, shit. Oh, shit.<eos> Did you check your jacket?<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> I just think we need a chance as humans to... fail in order to discover what actually works, you know?<eos> People don't think there's a process to being happy.<eos> So what do you want?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I mean, I guess I just want a chance to find out.<eos> Who doesn't?
Not a chance.<eos> You're just looking for an excuse to be mad at me.<eos> I don't need an excuse.<eos> I got a damn good reason as it is.<eos> All right, you want me to say it?<eos> ! I'll say it.<eos> I'm sorry I turned you in.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> Didn't know who I was.<eos> Now I do.
I have an idea.<eos> _<eos> Hey.<eos> Got your text.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> Um, I think I've been sending some confusing messages.<eos> Punching me in the throat, abruptly running away from me.<eos> I think you've been pretty clear.<eos> No, because those actions might send the message that I don't like you and that I don't want to see you...<eos> And I do.
I don't know. On behalf of Saito Game Team, I most humbly apologize.<eos> Who are you?<eos> What have you done to me?<eos> - What have you done to me?<eos> - Put him with the others, please.<eos> No, no, no, no! No, no, no!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop! Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Stop, stop, stop, stop!<eos> No, don't, don't!<eos> Don't!
Son of a bitch.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It's going to heal well.<eos> I'll go back to Bogotá with the body until the funeral.<eos> They call his wife?<eos> Yeah, she's on her way from Madrid.<eos> This ain't on you, Javi.<eos> It's on Escobar.<eos> And one way or another, he pays.<eos> We all do.
One... two... and three.<eos> And everyone was scrambling to get out of the fire.<eos> Or climb into it.<eos> This family is the only thing I care about.<eos> - You're the one that--<eos> - Me? Me, ma'am?<eos> Me? - We shouldn't leave, Tata.<eos> - All of this is your fault.<eos> If you'd listened to Pablo, my brother would still be alive.<eos> Because you do that so well?
Let's do it.<eos> Thank you, everybody!<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> And welcome to the first ever Grand Tour.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Now, we hope you like our tent.<eos> We think the great thing is that because it roams around the world, we get a different view out of the big picture windows every week.<eos> So this week, obviously we've got the high desert of California.<eos> - Next week, who knows?<eos> - I do.
She's just racist.<eos> ♪ There's a bright golden ♪ I love singing.<eos> I get to sing in my church.<eos> Really?<eos> You like church?<eos> Yeah, you're supposed to love church.<eos> Also, the singing is good, and I'm getting really good at it.<eos> Mom, Morgan says that her church is really great.<eos> Did you know that Mormons are really into music?<eos> No, honey, I didn't.
So, like, maybe we should be more open about who, uh, we have playdates with.<eos> Like, you know, what about that girl Nellie?<eos> What?<eos> I think it would be nice to have Nellie over.<eos> - Who's Nellie?<eos> - The girl from chorus, honey.<eos> Which girl?<eos> The black one, baby.<eos> The one who asked you for a playdate on Friday.<eos> No, they didn't.
Let's go.<eos> We'll figure it out, Kara.<eos> I promise.<eos> So, are you watching the Venture launch tonight?<eos> No, actually,<eos> James and I are going on our first date.<eos> It's gonna be great.<eos> We are finally both free and clear to just hang out.<eos> No aliens trying to destroy the Earth.<eos> Just him and me, together like normal people, doing what people do on dates.
Manpreet, the food is fabulous.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You should taste Manpreet's kidney-beans and rice.<eos> - It's out of this world.<eos> So Shekhar.<eos> Yeah. How long do you plan to stay here?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Honestly, I don't know.<eos> And anyway I believe, we never decide the time.<eos> Life does.
And brother Navjot.<eos> He doesn't live with us.<eos> He just comes over sometimes.<eos> His father is quiet old.<eos> So he feels lonely.<eos> - That's sweet of him.<eos> - Yeah, he's really sweet.<eos> She thought she loved me.<eos> But she didn't?<eos> No, she did.
I see. That's the kitchen.<eos> We'll show you upstairs later.<eos> This is the guest room.<eos> And this is.. ...our temple.<eos> Temple?<eos> But Gurpreet said you're Pakistani.<eos> We are Pakistanis.<eos> Do you have any objection?<eos> Of course not.<eos> We don't if you don't.
I am Fine.<eos> Not Fine.<eos> - I said I am fine!<eos> I am Fine. Shekhar, enough.<eos> Enough what, Taran?<eos> I want to tell you enough.<eos> Did I tell you to love me?<eos> Did I tell you not to love Amar?<eos> But..you told Amar, that you love me.<eos> I did.
You had your own world before I arrived.<eos> And now you have that back.<eos> And there's no place for Shekhar in that world.<eos> Will you decide whom I love?<eos> Only I have that right. me.. not you.<eos> If I had that right. ...then you could've never loved someone else.<eos> Not now..or in the next lifetime..or after that.<eos> Then why?<eos> I just want to tell you.. What you're doing is completely different from what you want, Taran.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong, Taran.
You want to know how many, uh, calories are in a sausage?<eos> Is... but is it even legal?<eos> No.<eos> Not in this country.<eos> Do you want to fool around?<eos> I don't.<eos> No, I-I do.<eos> It's just been a long time since this has even been an option.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> Um, you don't.
Queens, New York.<eos> Get out!<eos> Bayside, born and bred.<eos> Right here.<eos> You a Mets fan?<eos> Was.<eos> I don't follow baseball much anymore.<eos> Yeah, but still, you got to love watching the Yanks get slapped around, right?<eos> The Yankees?<eos> Who doesn't?
Because it's a secret.<eos> Raimy...<eos> I know what kind of father I've been, okay?<eos> And I know what I've lost.<eos> I lost your mother... and I lost you.<eos> I know what I've lost, okay?<eos> I do, I... and I know what I got to do to get it back.<eos> Dad, please don't go.<eos> Raimy, I know you mean well.<eos> I do.
- Whatever it is.<eos> And if you would just calm down and talk to him...<eos> Hey, look, I am totally calm, all right?<eos> I was calm talking to him, I'm fine.<eos> I'm fine. No, no, no, no.<eos> You didn't...<eos> You talked at him.<eos> You did not talk to him.<eos> - There is a difference.<eos> - I didn't...
I haven't heard you play in a while.<eos> Maybe you can bring it with you on the trip?<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You're excited.<eos> I reckon so.<eos> Don't overdo it out there.<eos> I know my limits.<eos> You worry too much.<eos> No, I don't.
We'll just...<eos> Oh, we'll just...<eos> Okay.<eos> Will you help me, please?<eos> It's a lost cause now.<eos> Come on, come on, come on, come on!<eos> I got it!<eos> Grandpa, help me.<eos> I thought you had it trapped.<eos> I did.
Those were your words?<eos> - Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> Well, that's funny 'cause you've never listened to anything that I've said!<eos> - I listened.<eos> - You have never listened to me!<eos> You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- You have never listened to me!<eos> You never listened to me.<eos> You never encouraged me.<eos> - I wanted to be a writer!<eos> - You tried.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> I tried that.<eos> I wanted to be a writer, and you wanted me to be you. Or at least one of your beloved Mustangs.<eos> That's true.<eos> I did.
You are not Karev's guardian angel.<eos> You are blinded by this thing.<eos> Look, I know you want to help.<eos> But there's no need to go down with him.<eos> I'm his family.<eos> Who else is going to help him?<eos> Did Karev tell you what happened with this patient tonight?<eos> Huh. You should ask him.<eos> I thought this little one got to go home.<eos> Uh, yeah, she did.
Should have seen the intake.<eos> It was gnarly.<eos> How gnarly?<eos> Uh, about 8, 9.<eos> Nice.<eos> You are bored out of your freaking mind.<eos> Oh, my God, I'm so bored.<eos> And I can't move as much as I want to, so we just sit and stare and stare and stare.<eos> And I love Harriet.<eos> I do, obviously.
You're walking on egg shells?<eos> What do you think it's been like for me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I know this whole thing is weird.<eos> Yeah, it's weird, and... hard.<eos> Agreed.<eos> It's hard.<eos> I don't like it.<eos> - I don't either.
What the hell's he doing here?<eos> Are you talking about Jules' necklace?<eos> - Jules?<eos> - Yeah, you know that's how they met, right?<eos> Ophelia found Jules' necklace... actually, I don't know where.<eos> Tracked her down to return it.<eos> - Harris, Fiona, this is Evan. - Hey.<eos> No, we met.<eos> I didn't have pants on.<eos> I do now.
Do you have it in my size?<eos> Thank you.<eos> - You don't want to answer?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You mean harassment?<eos> - Something like that.<eos> - You're the interested party?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - No, you didn't.
We're here about the bodies.<eos> Bodies?<eos> What bodies?<eos> Men with tattoos, heavy tattoos all over.<eos> You didn't-- You didn't transfer the bodies from the Patrick Spring case? - No.<eos> What would we want with them?<eos> - We do not want bodies.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> So you're saying there was no transfer?<eos> The FBI didn't...
Oh, wait. It's daytime.<eos> Wrong count.<eos> Monte Cristo?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Not on the menu.<eos> Never a fan of the eggy bread.<eos> No, Granny. It's a place.<eos> - And its Count has quite the reputation. - Oh.<eos> Why would he want to meet with us?<eos> He doesn't.
You should be thanking me.<eos> Edmond, come on.<eos> This is all just a big misunderstanding.<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> Edmond, we can explain everything.<eos> The Queen's our friend.<eos> She's changed.<eos> She doesn't want you to do this.<eos> That's where you're wrong.<eos> She does.
Bullshit!<eos> If you think losing 20 years of your life, your health and your money to win in court and not end up with a single cent shows that the system works, then you should be very proud of our justice system!<eos> Why'd you bring him here anyway?<eos> You have a business now.<eos> Some people like home made ketchup, others like home made cumshots!<eos> Shit!<eos> Whenever I laugh, these things fall right out!<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> What? You know I do.<eos> No, I don't.
Obviously.<eos> We're prepared to give you excellent media coverage and lots of money, on the condition that we get even more money back.<eos> How much are we talking?<eos> Μore money than you've ever seen, Bougon!<eos> At 8:34 p.m. and eight seconds, if voting trends continue, Quebec's next government will be led by Paul Bougon's Party for the Eradication of Nitwits...<eos> Jesus!<eos> ...in a majority government.<eos> Even here in Hull...<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> We did it!
Do you think war is just?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Your brother isn't a leader. He's a yes-man.<eos> He says yes to everything.<eos> He says yes to extremists. He says yes to more justice. He says yes to more freedom.<eos> Not you, though. I asked you if you were in favour of war and ruin.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> You said no.<eos> You're a true leader!<eos> Not a puppet who does whatever--
- Yes.<eos> - Yes, and who would blame him?<eos> - I would.<eos> Why avenge genocide with genocide?<eos> Why avenge?<eos> Trust me...<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> The Cabinet is empty.<eos> I knew it would be.<eos> Every Rhodian does.
Yeah.<eos> You were tending the bar that night.<eos> You stayed late to clean up.<eos> Yeah, that's what we always do after the...<eos> Then you saw Scott coming down from the stairwell leading to the roof.<eos> He was disheveled, out of breath, sweaty.<eos> You were about to ask him if he needed anything, but he was in such a hurry, he left without saying a word.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I didn't see anything like that.<eos> Yes, you did.
It's happening now, Mom.<eos> Seventy-three views is nothing to scoff at, Bethany.<eos> It's probably higher now.<eos> Whoa! You got a bunch of more comments.<eos> I did?<eos> "No talent.<eos> Now I have ear cancer."<eos> Emily!<eos> -[Jim and Bethany] Emily.<eos> -I didn't...
Drago-san.<eos> Welcome back, Ryo.<eos> Citizens of Zairon, we interrupt your viewing to bring you this live stream from the Royal Court of Ishida.<eos> I deliver the prisoner unto the judgment of the court.<eos> Han-Shireikan, join us.<eos> Ishida Ryo.<eos> You stand accused of the death of your father,<eos> Emperor Ishida Tetsuda.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> I don't.
Yeah, well, better get slicing on these oranges.<eos> Where is that coach?<eos> If we lose this game, I have to give the mayor of Capital City a crate of Springfield apricots.<eos> We grow no apricots!<eos> Kirk is missing.<eos> I haven't seen him since he left home happily singing about his friendship with you.<eos> Dad, what do you know?<eos> What?<eos> Nothing!<eos> I don't... oh, oh...
They said he died jogging, but I never believed it.<eos> He was actually killed by our greatest nemesis.<eos> We need you to take his place.<eos> But I'm just a kid.<eos> We all of us have special abilities.<eos> All these years I've been pretending to be the idiot bartender while actually I'm this super genius guy.<eos> Now, do you want to avenge your father?<eos> I'm in.<eos> Do I get any weapons?<eos> You certainly do.
I'll discuss things with the foreman.<eos> Enrique, mas grande la puerta!<eos> Look, Homie!<eos> We got three pieces together.<eos> That's a good day's work!<eos> Why don't we do one of Maggie's puzzles?<eos> Cow goes in the cow-shaped hole, boom.<eos> Next case.<eos> Hmm, I thought the one good thing about you hurting yourself was that we could spend more time together.<eos> You did?
Cut it out!<eos> Come on, Tommy!<eos> Okay, yeah. No, I'm on top of it, thank you.<eos> So there I am, pouring myself a glass of an absurdly expensive Scotch, celebrating one of the biggest nights of my life, when I get a call from a reporter asking for a comment on the post-game brawl.<eos> I was just about to call you...<eos> We got something here, Oscar.<eos> We have ourselves a moment.<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> Now, I know you love Al.<eos> Yes, I do.
Everybody knew.<eos> Why was I the last to know that I had cancer?<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Wait, wait a minute.<eos> Wait. Wait a minute, guys.<eos> - Explain. Explain. - Okay.<eos> - We...<eos> - You're the one who made me that appointment with that first guy who turned out not to even be a doctor.<eos> - How do I even know I have cancer at all?<eos> - Just trust us.<eos> You do.
Like a hundred percent.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Blood can't test itself.<eos> - That... That's what I mean.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yeah, right. Yeah.<eos> It's just now coming to me. I've never had my blood even tested.<eos> I just went to a person who said, "You undeniably have cancer."<eos> I don't even know if I actually have cancer!<eos> - You do.
Please.<eos> Okay... you know who we are, right?<eos> - Five-O.<eos> - You know we're not the cops, right?<eos> We can keep you here indefinitely, nobody's gonna ask any questions.<eos> You're aware of that, right?<eos> On my children, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> I believe you.<eos> That's the thing. I do!<eos> But, unfortunately, my very impatient partner does not.
Alive, dead, we're just specks of dust.<eos> We blow away in the wind.<eos> But it makes no difference.<eos> We make no difference.<eos> Dead or alive is all the same.<eos> That is the beauty, Joe.<eos> No.<eos> You saved my life.<eos> Please tell me it matters.<eos> Of course it does, Joe.
Uncle Frank, who's Pharaoh?<eos> The Pharaoh was a ruler and... a tyrant.<eos> Are our rulers tyrants?<eos> It's not safe here, Frank.<eos> - Uncle Frank! - No, no, no!<eos> Don't breathe!<eos> Hold your breath! No!<eos> - John, Emily, don't breathe!<eos> - Uncle Frank!<eos> No! No! Don't...
- You go to that school, you're gonna get infected with their lawyer mind-set and when you come out, you're not gonna give a shit about your fellow man.<eos> - If you think that, then you should've spent more time with me.<eos> Because you don't know me at all.<eos> - Ms. Pearson?<eos> Ms. Pearson, are you ready?<eos> - Mr. Forrest... so many lives were ruined that night.<eos> Your daughter's, her boyfriend's, yours.<eos> - Is there a question?<eos> - Someone had to pay for that, didn't they?<eos> - Yeah, they sure as hell did.
For a fee.<eos> All right.<eos> Guess I'll take you to him.<eos> Besides, this is a proposition that Escorpion will want to see in person.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I finally triangulated Murphy's signal.<eos> He was transmitting from Spokane.<eos> Washington?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> And anything else does?
But I don't need to take home the paper trail.<eos> It's not a paper trail.<eos> It's an engagement letter.<eos> Turns out my attorney was filing my positions before he had to, so I let him go.<eos> You want me to take you as a client.<eos> If you'll have me.<eos> On one condition.<eos> I hear you've been having fun with Louis Litt.<eos> But it stops now.<eos> Done.
If you need anything--<eos> I'll let you know.<eos> Look, I didn't-- I didn't tell them what you told me about Harvey getting you out.<eos> I need you to know that.<eos> It's important to me.<eos> Yeah, whatever you say, Kevin.<eos> I know I haven't told you why I'm in here, Mike...<eos> But you don't understand.<eos> From the second I got here, I've had to watch what I say, every single word, and every morning I get up, and I remind myself not to say the wrong thing to the wrong person, and every night I go to bed and think,<eos> "Another day down where I didn't."
- Here.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - That's my guy.<eos> - Your guy?<eos> My private investigator.<eos> Why doesn't it say it on the card?<eos> Because a guy that good isn't in the phone book.<eos> Listen, Rachel, when you get to a certain level, everybody has their person.<eos> Harvey has Vanessa, I have Carter.<eos> And now I do too.
He's the guy that gets the deal, and you're the guy that gets the deal.<eos> There's no third deal.<eos> Harvey, please.<eos> I've betrayed this man enough.<eos> I need you to convince Cahill that one person makes a case, but two people is a slam dunk.<eos> Okay, Mike.<eos> I'll make it happen.<eos> Do you have a second?<eos> Actually, I don't, Donna, because I'm going on the most important date of my life tonight, and I have no idea where I'm taking her.<eos> Yes, you do.
You can fix this.<eos> Whatever it is, I will help you.<eos> No, but that's the thing.<eos> You just said it.<eos> I have to throw the punch.<eos> That's why I came out here alone.<eos> You can't do it for me this time.<eos> Do you know how it feels when you know all your happiness is a lie?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
It's like a mansion at half the price.<eos> You gotta send me some pics.<eos> - You're gonna come visit.<eos> - Absolutely, I will. As soon as I get those job scenarios squared away.<eos> - Oh, what, the Suh thing?<eos> - Suh's the least of my worries.<eos> Anderson clipped me last night.<eos> You got fired?<eos> I didn't tell you?<eos> No, you definitely didn't.
Well, these phones have been disabled.<eos> Only the camera works.<eos> We want you to help document life in the house for the next three days.<eos> Really put yourself in the audience's point of view.<eos> As you all know, America fell in love with two Shelbys, two Matts and two Lees.<eos> And Edward!<eos> And Ed...<eos> How could I forget?<eos> And we brought you back together to see if magic will strike a second time.<eos> Just do you.
What is that?<eos> You cut off my ear.<eos> It's a present.<eos> For Christmas.<eos> It's the best day of the year.<eos> We each get a pickled ear.<eos> A bag of Mentho-lyptus.<eos> Jar of black strap molasses.<eos> More ammo.<eos> The babies do cuddles with Mama.
- Told you.<eos> - Uh, one interesting fact...<eos> Peggy Carter herself oversaw construction of this base.<eos> Most people know the legend of Peggy Carter, but there's so many stories that were never recorded.<eos> I remember one time...<eos> You're seeing their faces, aren't you?<eos> Everyone else...<eos> what's wrong with them?<eos> - Why don't they see it?<eos> - I do.
Some of our medication supply is missing.<eos> It's Yo-Yo.<eos> She's stealing it, and... You two have been in touch this whole time.<eos> There's a group called the Watchdogs.<eos> They're hunting Inhumans.<eos> And who knows what kind of weapon they stole from the energy lab in Pasadena.<eos> You want to know what's connecting these things.<eos> Ithink it might be me.<eos> Now you see it.<eos> Now you don't.
- Come on, let's go.<eos> Hey, stop.<eos> Fitz, we could really use that exit.<eos> If I release the door, all the doors in cellblock A open.<eos> - The s-security wings, the exterior exits ...<eos> - Just do it!<eos> I get it.<eos> You and Phil Coulson are close.<eos> I'm the new Director, your boss, so you think there are things that I don't need to know.<eos> But I do.
I remember he went over to you.<eos> He bent down to check on you.<eos> And then you moved.<eos> - That's when I knew you were alive. - Yeah.<eos> That's not what happened.<eos> Well, the first part is like you said.<eos> The fire, the chase, the shooting.<eos> But what I remember most is feeling like I screwed up that because of me, you were going to die.<eos> We both were.<eos> We didn't.
They can sue you for damages. They could bankrupt you.<eos> And even if someone slipped a chill pill into their collective drink, you would still be legally unable to work for the next two years.<eos> That's for any studio, any network. Television or film.<eos> So... that's the good news.<eos> Now here's the part you're not gonna like.<eos> She's throwing this big... Hollywood party at her house tonight, right? The network president's gonna be there, everyone.<eos> I'm supposed to show up, get down on my hands and knees and beg to be the Manny again.<eos> They own me, Sis.<eos> I don't know what I'm gonna do.<eos> Well, I do, and you did it already.
I'm going on Kimmel this afternoon.<eos> - You're doing Kimmel?<eos> - Last thing I need.<eos> "Ginny Baker's clubhouse decorating tips."<eos> That's funny.<eos> Yeah, those guys are good.<eos> You think it's too soon for this.<eos> Think I'm a media freakshow.<eos> I should keep my head down, focus on the game.<eos> Actually, no. I don't.
That's all I need.<eos> We'll send a car.<eos> We'll make it very, very easy.<eos> - Oscar.<eos> - Hold on one second.<eos> Sorry, the Korean Consulate.<eos> I need an interpreter.<eos> You're aware our manager got thrown out of the game and our pitcher just escalated a beanball war?<eos> - Yes, I am. ‭ - Oh, it's a shame it had to end like this for Al.<eos> Does it, Frank?
Any ideas where we can find him?<eos> Ah, as it so happens, exactly one Brevakk registered in National City for the President's Alien Amnesty Act.<eos> I got an address.<eos> Shall I get a strike team to gear up?<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> Sawyer?<eos> It's Danvers.<eos> Can I talk to you a minute?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> Now you do.
- You don't understand.<eos> - Then make me understand!<eos> We're the last of our kind.<eos> There's no one else.<eos> It's our responsibility to preserve everything we've lost.<eos> That's the difference between us.<eos> I don't want to remember.<eos> You want to still be there.<eos> You want to relive it, over and over.<eos> I don't!
I heard you took out Draaga.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thanks for the tip.<eos> Yeah, I thought it would be fun to have these powers.<eos> It can be.<eos> It will be.<eos> I'm going to teach you how.<eos> I got the impression that you didn't want to spend time with me.<eos> Oh, you're right.<eos> I didn't.
No, stay.<eos> Stay.<eos> Until you fall asleep.<eos> - Hey, Maggie.<eos> - Danvers!<eos> Hey, I was hoping you'd turn up.<eos> Any interest in a game?<eos> Well, actually, I was wondering if you were still good for that drink you promised me.<eos> You told Kara?<eos> Yeah, you did!
I never made you choose.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> I love you, and there is nothing that you can ever do to make me stop loving you.<eos> You're young.<eos> I know how hard this is for you.<eos> Because I was young... and I didn't realize how hard it was for you.<eos> So where does that leave us?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
It's too easy to pass up.<eos> Okay, well, that's your opinion.<eos> You have a better one?<eos> Or maybe you listen to me and find him.<eos> Oh, sure, yeah.<eos> I'm just gonna go make a call.<eos> Goff has been AWOL for 20 years on my end, and I am the one dealing with the fact that this psycho beat and strangled Mom.<eos> Everybody wants a memorial for her.<eos> They want to mourn her.<eos> Of course they do.
He won't take any pills that aren't chewable and shaped like a Flintstone.<eos> You know, when Leonard's feeling anxious I make him take a long walk.<eos> Does that help?<eos> Well, for a while.<eos> Then he comes back.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> This guy from the office just congratulated me on being pregnant.<eos> You did already know, right?<eos> No one at the office did.
None of them is gonna have anything good to say about you.<eos> And they're not gonna have anything bad to say either.<eos> You're gonna be a blast in the field.<eos> "Bartender, one chocolate milk, shaken, not stirred."<eos> Why are you bothering me?<eos> Because you're wasting your chance.<eos> And what's the point in living if you're not gonna live?<eos> You might as well do everyone a favor and kill yourself now.<eos> I usually pray for men like you.<eos> I do.
I thought there was something different about you.<eos> I've never seen people work so hard at not working.<eos> Hey, everybody!<eos> Take a look at my sweet ride.<eos> It's a minivan.<eos> I've been test driving this bad boy with this other bad boy all day.<eos> For six hours.<eos> We went through every Wendy's drive-thru in Queens.<eos> I wrote "Help me" on a napkin.<eos> But nobody did.
It's just that, it's a unique moment.<eos> We want to enjoy it.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - They were in your office.<eos> Let me go! My extensions!<eos> Bravo.<eos> You fooled us.<eos> Call the police.<eos> You have no right to treat us like this!<eos> - Yes, they do.
Previously on Pitch...<eos> The video is everywhere.<eos> I just don't want to do it anymore.<eos> I just don't...
Getting my running in.<eos> You already ran this morning.<eos> It's been crazy lately, and since you won't let me pitch...<eos> I'm not punishing you.<eos> Well, on that mound is the only place that feels normal.<eos> Turn that off.<eos> Been working on a cutter.<eos> You want to see it?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I should have never let you talk me into this.<eos> Rog, come on, it was the only way.<eos> I mean, I love the man, but he stole 150 bricks of cold hard cash.<eos> 149.<eos> - No, it was 150.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> Let's say 149.<eos> Damn it, Riggs, giving Ned money wasn't part of the plan!<eos> Uh, in fairness, I didn't have a plan.<eos> Yes, we did.
But whatever happens on Saturday, February 11th, 2012...<eos> Go home with Wyatt.<eos> Even if he's being an ass.<eos> Just let him take you home.<eos> And know that he loves you.<eos> More than you'll ever know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Worked in "Back to the Future II."<eos> I know what you're gonna say.<eos> No, you don't.
- I should have told you sooner.<eos> He took my mom only six months after he took your mother.<eos> So then you know what it's like.<eos> The loss.<eos> It drowns you.<eos> I used to pray every day, hoping somehow she was still alive, being kept somewhere.<eos> I used to dream about it.<eos> But now, after this, I hope she died quick.<eos> I feel like when we were little you told me you saw his face.<eos> Did I?
Thunk, are you okay?<eos> You spoke.<eos> I win.<eos> Son, you really couldn't climb out of this?<eos> No, Grug, Meep sounds really... okay.<eos> Give it time, Ugga.<eos> There could still be a second scream.<eos> No. You're okay.<eos> I could've sworn I heard... [screaming]<eos> Oh, you did.
Digital tomography of the pillar will show exactly where interior instability lies.<eos> I'll calculate its load-bearing capacity.<eos> And a software we designed will let me engineer a rebuild.<eos> And I'll use six specialized biochemicals I mixed myself to pinpoint what molds, bacteria, or polysaccharides are causing the problem.<eos> Thousands of years ago, fungi was used to adhere concrete, and those spores could've been reactivated from L.A. pollution, Pacific salt air, or something else.<eos> We'll identify the issue and stop it from happening again.<eos> Yes, we're anxious for you to begin.<eos> Well, let's get crack-a-lackin'.<eos> My Happy needs her sleep.<eos> Before you do, a few things:
Why is that?<eos> Actually, we try not to have the television on while we eat or discuss matters better left at work.<eos> I imagine it must be difficult having such important husbands... wanting to be supportive, of course, but then at home there's things they can't talk about, even to you.<eos> It certainly can be difficult.<eos> Actually, a woman's role in the Reich is to run her house and rear her children, and they make the world look like a completely different place.<eos> Every choice that you make is no longer about your future alone.<eos> Everything changes.<eos> You said that you had a serious boyfriend out west.<eos> You didn't want children?<eos> He did.
Let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> My brain is telling me to stop, but my stomach's saying, "Keep going."<eos> You should listen to your stomach because we have dessert coming up.<eos> Yeah? What you got?<eos> Homemade Chantilly cake with macadamia nuts.<eos> That is impressive.<eos> I better pace myself.<eos> Hey, I love the new haircut.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You got someplace you can stay tonight, so you won't be alone?<eos> She could stay with me.<eos> Better whiskey there, anyway.<eos> It might be better to get her into an FBI safe house, you know?<eos> You're adorable, but I can handle myself just fine, thank you.<eos> Copy that.<eos> Come on, dear.<eos> She's tough.<eos> Trust me, you do not want to mess with Miss Loretta.<eos> No, I don't.
What is this place?<eos> Why'd you bring me here?<eos> 40 years ago you had to make a pretty decent living to afford a place on this lake.<eos> But then people started getting sick.<eos> Cancer, sterility, birth defects.<eos> Turns out a chemical plant up river had been leaking for years.<eos> They'd known about it the whole time, of course, but it was cheaper to up their campaign contributions than to repair the damage.<eos> So the people elected to protect us looked the other way as... thousand of families were destroyed.<eos> I don't...
She must be activating the bug software that's messing with the Penter server!<eos> Penter server?<eos> Something's messing with the election.<eos> Well, things just got a lot more complicated, because that woman is Sophia Vasquez...<eos> It's the president's chief of staff.<eos> All right, Happy, you're certain you stopped the footage at exactly 7:13?<eos> I know what seven, one and three look like.<eos> Okay, if the president's chief of staff downloaded that bug, and the president sent the FBI to get us to fix the server...<eos> How do we know Backside, Fart and Go-Smell-Me aren't in on this?<eos> We don't.
It's a IM .50-caliber tranquilizer gun.<eos> Tranquilizer?<eos> Yeah, it's usually used to hunt big...<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Uh, it's usually used to hunt big game.<eos> It's, uh, meant to knock a lion out from distance in seconds.<eos> Of course, that-that doesn't necessarily guarantee that you're not gonna get eaten.<eos> You know who it's registered to?<eos> I do. Yeah.
There was some of that in the thing I had to drink to find Aladdin.<eos> And you kiss me with that mouth?<eos> Let's get this up to Henry so he can pack the Bug before the new tenant comes.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, Hang on, hang on.<eos> Look at me, look at me.<eos> You're worried about your parents, and that's making this worse, but they're gonna be all right.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little baby tree thing and defeat the Evil Queen.<eos> They're gonna find that magic little tree thing?<eos> Yeah, that's right.<eos> What if they don't?
Follow me!<eos> Snow!<eos> Aren't you a real Prince Charming.<eos> You...<eos> You saved me.<eos> I thought I'd lost you forever.<eos> May the love between you always be strong, true, and eternal.<eos> If you need anything, I will always find you.<eos> Do you promise?<eos> I do.
Yeah, Pride, we might have a little problem with the FBI.<eos> Gregorio just made us.<eos> Damn.<eos> Okay, where is she now?<eos> Looks like she's on foot walking down Rampart.<eos> - Be right with you.<eos> - Okay, well,<eos> Patton found the brother of our dead gunman, James Connor.<eos> Yeah, he may have spotted me.<eos> Yeah, he did.
What does that mean? There's no story to that.<eos> That's just sort of like, "Look, I fucked this guy and he's sleeping."<eos> There's completely story, this is my life.<eos> [Jacob] Look at this... that old guy. No, no, I mean, how many are there? You have a whole phone full of this shit?<eos> Are you trying to slut shame me now?<eos> No, I'm not trying to slut shame you. Why didn't you return my text?<eos> [Alison] My privacy is public.<eos> [Jacob] Yeah, but mine isn't.<eos> [Alison chuckles] Uh, I don't think that's true.<eos> -What do you--
Very well.<eos> If those are the orders, those are the orders.<eos> We'll snatch him up and take him to the Allies.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So it seems that this<eos> Von Braun will be at the demonstration tonight.<eos> I can get us past the front door.<eos> Lucy can accompany me as my secretary.<eos> - How do I get in?<eos> - You don't.
They're moving in now.<eos> Drop your weapons!<eos> Drop it!<eos> - Reddington?<eos> - He's gone.<eos> The Feds are Halbeck's problem.<eos> All that matters to me is that we are right on schedule.<eos> Gentlemen, mind if I join you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Who is the most recent?<eos> Omar Najjar.<eos> Married, no children...<eos> Chemical engineer in RD at Bethesda Plastics.<eos> Start there.<eos> If someone hired this Lindquist Concern to kill Najjar, I want to know what revolutionary technology they got their hands on.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Komarov gets massages twice a week from a woman who moonlights as an FBI informant.<eos> - He does?<eos> - He does now.
How would you do that?<eos> He admires Kirk, says he's a good man.<eos> He shouldn't.<eos> And he's not.<eos> I'm in the middle.<eos> Between you and Kirk, between Tom and Kirk.<eos> Can you at least admit how difficult that is?<eos> No.<eos> It's only difficult if you accept the premise that Kirk is your father.<eos> I don't.
But... that's a lesson for another day.<eos> If you're interested in learning from me.<eos> I'm interested.<eos> Chicken Kiev.<eos> Chick...<eos> Chicken Kiev.<eos> My... my kids love it when I make Chicken Kiev.<eos> I do mine from scratch. I mean, I don't have chickens.<eos> I have a butcher friend.<eos> Who doesn't in L.A. these days?
But it's the configuration that's strange.<eos> The pictures are obviously of Gabriel at different ages, but normally one would arrange them in chronological or reverse chronological order.<eos> 15, 11, and 32 is a pattern that he wants us to see. Not us.<eos> Tara.<eos> It's a pattern he wants her to see.<eos> Uh, yes. I remember this.<eos> His 32nd birthday party. Ah.<eos> His sixth grade graduation.<eos> He made the Honor Roll that year. Yeah.<eos> He did every year. Huh.
Jody?<eos> (bats chirping)<eos> She could be unconscious by now.<eos> (bat squeaks)<eos> (gasps)<eos> We are not alone.<eos> CABE:<eos> It's just like The Birds.<eos> Probably didn't see that film.<eos> Oh, I did.
And there is no one in the whole world I'd rather be too hot or too cold with.<eos> Grandma always says the same thing.<eos> Yeah, she does, doesn't she?<eos> Is everything all right, baby?<eos> Um... you girls should go upstairs and play in Tess's room for a little while.<eos> But...<eos> Come on.<eos> Why is there a photo of me and a letter that you sent to William's apartment?<eos> No, you know what? Don't-- don't speak.<eos> Please, don't just-- um...
- Okay, yeah.<eos> - I see you are making fun of me, but I will. - No, yeah.<eos> - Why don't you stop smiling?<eos> - I can't.<eos> - Stop smiling.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> This early midlife crisis is so you, I can't stand it.<eos> You want something to smile about?<eos> - No, please.<eos> - Do you, do you really?
Come along, we'll take your statement.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> It's not her.<eos> I saw you by those sheets.<eos> I thought the same as you.<eos> She could top herself, but not kill someone else.<eos> - Have they arrested her?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You think she did it?<eos> No, I don't.
Report.<eos> Garcia Flynn stole the tape from the White House.<eos> We didn't have a chance to stop him.<eos> Nixon was on it.<eos> He sounded terrified about Rittenhouse, mentioned something about a document.<eos> Destroy the doc.<eos> How? I'm not...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't have it.<eos> When you do.
Deep Throat, here we come.<eos> Over there.<eos> Mr. Felt?<eos> We're the ones that called you.<eos> From "The Times."<eos> You said you have some files on J. Edgar Hoover?<eos> Actually, no. We wanted to ask you about the Watergate Hotel break-in.<eos> No. I only came...<eos> I don't know anything about the Watergate.<eos> Yes, you do.
Please.<eos> Tell me.<eos> I might be mixed up with them too, and I'm scared.<eos> I am...<eos> I am really scared.<eos> You should be.<eos> They control all of us.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> No one does.
Then put her out of her misery.<eos> How do you know so much about it?<eos> Because I've been on both sides of that phone.<eos> I've ducked my share of calls...<eos> And you boiled your share of bunnies?<eos> No.<eos> I've showed up at a doorstep or two.<eos> I'm not proud of that, though.<eos> Well, why do you care so much about it, anyway?<eos> I don't, Lasalle.
I spent the last 18 hours collating log-ins with the first appearance of the malicious code in order to figure out who got punk'd so we could interview the employee and nail that hacker.<eos> And it was you.<eos> You knew.<eos> She was a key player in the Jaipur centrifuge hack.<eos> Why didn't you tell...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> We wanted to, but we thought if you knew, she might pick it up.<eos> Look, you didn't tell her anything, did you?<eos> I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid.<eos> I just don't...
I guess that counts as music.<eos> I like noises, too.<eos> _<eos> You know, I was just curious if anyone at the table has any hidden talents.<eos> I can pretend I'm interested in mundane conversations.<eos> I know Morse code.<eos> Wow, that's really interesting, Hank!<eos> Deirdre, do you have any hidden talents?<eos> Thank you very much for asking, Evie.<eos> And, yes, I do.
She's not listening.<eos> They're saying... that without the treatments, the cancer will kill you before the baby's even born.<eos> In a month, two months, you'll both be dead.<eos> I went to court to fight a traffic ticket so I could save $360 so we could buy an organic crib mattress.<eos> This is how my day started.<eos> And now I'm...<eos> All day long, I have been thinking that there is... there's a reason that I was in that line.<eos> There's a reason that I met you.<eos> And I don't believe in God or fate or anything.<eos> She doesn't at all.
You shouldn't.<eos> Um, I'll be pretty late, so don't wait up, 'kay?<eos> Um, I'm sorry.<eos> They were supposed to tell you not to wait.<eos> I had a Whipple.<eos> I know.<eos> I waited anyway.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> You're right.<eos> We do.

So, you're telling me the hostages, this attack, the bio weapons, the First Lady is all for computer drives?<eos> Those drives contain decades worth of intelligence gathered through surveillance systems the leaders were here to dismantle.<eos> Classified intercepts, clandestine operations, millions of e-mails, text messages.<eos> You want to get to them before the terrorists do.<eos> The terrorists already have them.<eos> They're useless without someone capable of decrypting them.<eos> Someone like Eric Boyer?<eos> We have to destroy the drives before the terrorists figure out how to decrypt them.<eos> How do I know you're not leading me into a trap?<eos> You don't.
! No!<eos> Harry!<eos> Dayana!<eos> So, that's why you were late this morning.<eos> That's what you've been doing the whole week.<eos> Sleeping with the man who could get you fired.<eos> Why?<eos> Why compromise the entire mission for sex?<eos> You don't get it.<eos> I don't.
- Oh, that sounds...<eos> - Then a GSW to the abdomen that Edwards caught...<eos> a duodenal repair.<eos> Wa... How long have you been here?<eos> What day is it?<eos> Scalpel.<eos> How do you know when you're too tired to operate?<eos> Right about when you make your first mistake.<eos> I hate that answer.<eos> You don't.
- Owen. - Webber's right.<eos> Transplant's the only way to save this patient.<eos> I'm removing his liver.<eos> It's only making him worse.<eos> - Scissors.<eos> - Do not make that cut!<eos> Basin.<eos> Clips, please. Boki.<eos> We decided not to list him.<eos> No, you did.
Oh, and bradshaw sucks!<eos> Oh, no, bradshaw's gonna have a huge second half, though. Right, babe? Yeah.<eos> Big...<eos> Big second half.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Actually, no.<eos> Um, what did you mean before when, uh... When you said... "Promise me we'll never have kids"?<eos> I shouldn't have said that.<eos> Yeah, but... you did.
Okay, guys.<eos> Here comes the next question.<eos> I really appreciate you inviting me to this trivial event, Hank.<eos> Supposed to be counterintuitive.<eos> This Zap Strap is amazing!<eos> T-Leaf, sit down and join us.<eos> No, I can't.<eos> I'm already on round nine, about to level up.<eos> I haven't thought about Evie for 31,207 steps.<eos> I just did.
Well, that's impossible and exhausting.<eos> And, you know, I'm pretty good with the salutations and the signing off, but I cannot think of something meaningful to say every time I get off the phone with someone.<eos> That cannot be the lesson in this.<eos> I don't think we're gonna know what we're supposed to learn for a while.<eos> That doesn't work for me, sir.<eos> I'm sorry, but, you know, I cross-check and I figure it out quickly.<eos> I know.<eos> It's gonna get better.<eos> Well, I wish it would hurry up and do that because this feels really rotten.<eos> Of course it does.
What does that mean, loosen the reins?<eos> That means...<eos> I'm done dieting, Kate.<eos> But I still support you 100%.<eos> Um... how?<eos> Like, we were supposed to do this together?<eos> Or like, I agreed to go out with you because you were gonna lose the weight<eos> - for me.<eos> And...<eos> - and I did.
No. Please, Kevin.<eos> Let's hear it, right?<eos> What are you harboring? 'Cause God knows<eos> I would really love to hear this.<eos> You always got special treatment.<eos> Because I'm black?<eos> No, because you're black and you're adopted.<eos> Yeah, hit the jackpot with that combination.<eos> - Couldn't have had it any easier.<eos> - In our house, you did.
Bit of a future environmental catastrophe, but, today, it could save our asses.<eos> - How's that gonna work?<eos> - Connor will fly to this spot with a team of archaeologists and dig this up.<eos> We're standing in what's going to be a suburb of Pittsburgh.<eos> I mean, who knows what could happen to this patch of land over 260 years.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why we got to dig deep.<eos> And this system generally works?<eos> Don't know.<eos> No one's ever tried it.<eos> - And if it doesn't?
The middle of Fallujah would be an amazing result right now.<eos> Needless to say, it is very complicated, and we need Jiya and Mason to help us land.<eos> That is, provided they got my note.<eos> Let's say they didn't.<eos> What are the odds?<eos> Somewhere between one in a billion and impossible.<eos> How do they help us land?<eos> Hey, there.<eos> I don't know what else to do.<eos> Well, I do.
Marcus pulled the airport security footage.<eos> He's going over it now to see if he can use it to identify the pilot, or any of the people he smuggled.<eos> You realize this opens up a small army of suspects for Bennett Nealy's murder, right?<eos> His pilot, his shady customers.<eos> We got a problem.<eos> So this footage is a couple months old, but I'm pretty sure these were two of Bennett's customers.<eos> The date and time jibe with the logs he kept in his office.<eos> His plane returned from a trip to Montreal not 20 minutes before these two got into that limo, but that's not all.<eos> You know Mike over there is in the Army Reserves, right?<eos> Yeah. Did a few tours as an MP in Afghanistan.
Okay, okay. Good meeting.<eos> We'll pick it up later.<eos> Nas, a word in my office.<eos> She's impossible.<eos> You're just figuring that out now?<eos> Even if we do turn Roman, the last thing I need to deal with is a sociopathic killer.<eos> He's her brother... and if you don't at least hear her out, you risk losing her.<eos> You really think that she would turn to Sandstorm if she doesn't get her way?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I'm being hunted... by the Akkadian.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Nothing?<eos> You don't know who the... oh, my God.<eos> - How do you still have a job?<eos> - Fine...<eos> - what's the Akkadian?<eos> - It's a myth.<eos> It's an assassin so lethal it's able to reach targets in such untouchable locations that the intel community doesn't believe it even exists.<eos> Yeah, and neither does Snopes, apparently.
Yes, yes, you do.<eos> You remember everything.<eos> That's why you don't need the dress or any of that other stuff.<eos> Your brain is like our garage full of boxes.<eos> All right?<eos> Come on, that's... that is pretty romantic, right?<eos> It is when you say it, for some reason.<eos> Oh, and here's another thing I know for sure happened on our wedding day.<eos> You looked beautiful and I... was the luckiest man in the world.<eos> I did.
Maybe we can use that.<eos> You know, give our kids a little glimpse into their future.<eos> Scare 'em straight.<eos> Ooh, I like it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, in the last day, our kids have engaged in vandalism, conspiracy and racketeering.<eos> I don't really know what that is, but they make a hell of a racket.<eos> Okay, you guys know Uncle Don.<eos> What you don't know is that he is also a father.<eos> Yeah, we do, to cousin Mikey.
Excuse me.<eos> I need to speak with an FBI agent named Hannah Wells.<eos> - Can you find her for me?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Why does the president want to know about Hannah Wells?<eos> He's interested in some information she claims to have on Peter MacLeish.<eos> Why?<eos> What kind of information did she say she had?<eos> She didn't.
The FBI just handed in their report, and it concludes that Jason Atwood did, indeed, kill Majid Nassar.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> I asked Ms. Jordan to stay on as a White House correspondent to keep us honest.<eos> She kept up her end of the bargain.<eos> We need to do the same.<eos> Tell her we'll give her an exclusive on the man that we have in custody, but she's gonna have to wait till tomorrow.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Sir, I'm sorry about Atwood.<eos> I know you didn't want it to be true.<eos> None of us did.
Maybe.<eos> -What did you say?<eos> The doctor tested a treatment from the Offshore and I felt my legs.<eos> I can't believe it, Fernando.<eos> That's incredible.<eos> It's wonderful.<eos> -You can walk again--<eos> -Michele, why are you so happy?<eos> It took me years to accept that I would never walk again.<eos> But I did it.
Go, go, go, go!<eos> [Álvaro] Vanessa!<eos> What?<eos> Poor Vanessa... she was the last one to eat.<eos> She's so skinny, she must be about to faint.<eos> I think it's time we open the gate.<eos> How many candidates have been eliminated?<eos> None.<eos> Marco brought them together, they were organized until the end.<eos> Everyone did their part with very little conflict.
-What?<eos> -I'm not hurting anyone.<eos> But they have no problem hurting you or me.<eos> Take this shit!<eos> Why is the Process doing this to us?<eos> [Ezequiel] Are you hungry?<eos> If you eat, you'll be eliminated.<eos> -What?<eos> -It wouldn't be fair to the others.<eos> What if I don't?
You know that's impossible.<eos> He's all alone, Ezequiel.<eos> In a few years, he will apply to the Process.<eos> If he passes, you will meet again.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> Then he doesn't deserve to be missed at all.<eos> Because he's one of them... not one of us.<eos> -It doesn't work like that, Ezequiel.<eos> -Julia...<eos> It doesn't.
I'll go wherever you go.<eos> It doesn't matter where.<eos> -Fernando, no--<eos> -No, I'm serious.<eos> I don't care about passing the Process as long as we end up on the same side.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> First candidate.<eos> Joana is done.<eos> Next.<eos> Done, why?
None of you noticed any odd behavior?<eos> You didn't find anything off about her?<eos> Let's not worry about it, Fernando.<eos> You're almost to the Offshore.<eos> I'd like to quit.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I'd like to quit.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> You made it this far.<eos> Very few do.
Ezequiel would like to have a word with you.<eos> Come with me?<eos> Only me?<eos> It's a routine chat.<eos> Hello! Is anybody there?<eos> You have to stay in your room until the transportation to Offshore!<eos> Please!<eos> Please, open the door!<eos> Please! I know I was wrong!<eos> I do!
What report?<eos> I gave Scorsese Miranda's accident report.<eos> So please tell him.<eos> Sorry, Riggs.<eos> There wasn't anything to indicate it wasn't an accident.<eos> What about the tox report?<eos> The driver wasn't drunk.<eos> There was nothing there.<eos> Hey, look, I know how hard this can be.<eos> No, you don't.
You got eyes on Kirk?<eos> Aram's trying to locate the escape vehicle.<eos> - Where are you on Dr. Shaw?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> Reddington got to her.<eos> If we're right and Shaw knows how to cure Kirk,<eos> Reddington has just made sure that's not going to happen.<eos> Which means Liz is his only hope.<eos> Kirk's not gonna hurt her as long as he needs her stem cells to survive.<eos> But he doesn't.
I climbed up, looked into the yard... and she was just Dancing.<eos> ... unafraid.<eos> Daring.<eos> Being.<eos> I'd never seen anything like it.<eos> She had A joy for living.<eos> She was more alive than anyone I knew.<eos> When I heard she killed herself...<eos> I didn't believe it.<eos> I still don't.
What's with the cheeseball movie?<eos> What?<eos> The plot is an interesting mélange of Cold War themes.<eos> And the action isn't half bad.<eos> Balderdash.<eos> What?<eos> I'm trying to see if turn of the century exclamations can make a comeback.<eos> It's a small linguistics experiment I'm doing.<eos> Anyway, hey, you don't even like movies.<eos> Yes, I do. Hooey.
I know what it's like to find that one special woman.<eos> No, more than special.<eos> Before I met Beth, I was a dog.<eos> Bouncing around three different women at the same time.<eos> I was a bad guy.<eos> But she saw through my insecurities.<eos> She gave me a chance to be the man that she knew that I could be.<eos> But you know what it's like.<eos> She was in love over this nonsense playboy life.<eos> Yeah. I sure do.
I'm alone, get him to leave?<eos> - Unlikely.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> This cabin is the only place around here for miles.<eos> It's a good bet that the gunrunners will surmise it's where we came from.<eos> And they'll be able to follow the trail we left.<eos> We were worried about speed, not stealth.<eos> We need to act while we have the numbers on our side.<eos> Guy out there has a gun.<eos> We don't.
You never even said good-bye.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It was probably a good thing you left when you did, though.<eos> Everybody got busted right afterwards.<eos> Apparently, somebody ratted us out.<eos> Yeah, but you didn't get busted, right?<eos> No, thanks to you.<eos> How much did Percy say about this Ramon dude, exactly?<eos> Not enough, obviously. Yeah, but you didn't do anything wrong, right?
Whoo! Okay, I gotta run. You got Mookie Wilson?<eos> - Okay. - Go. - See you.<eos> Hey, kiddo!<eos> Come here, you.<eos> God, you were so good.<eos> Did you see my double?<eos> You had a hit?<eos> I had three hits.<eos> I'm just kidding you.<eos> Of course you did.
That alarm just sent every guard on this floor to this room.<eos> We're not the ones stealing the item.<eos> We're the distraction.<eos> - Just throw the knife out.<eos> - I can't!<eos> Someone saw me at the precinct.<eos> An old coworker.<eos> At any moment, the lab is going to realize that the knife is missing, and when that happens, I will be screwed.<eos> You should have thought about that before you decided to steal evidence.<eos> I did!
We both know it's been a whole lot longer than that.<eos> Just forget it.<eos> I'm cancelling.<eos> So you can come by, don't come by.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I was living the American dream.<eos> I had tenure, passion, standing room only at my TED talks.<eos> But I didn't have that one thing... that one thing that would make them take notice.<eos> And then?<eos> I did.
How long does she think my freakin' neck is?<eos> It's a fat-man scarf.<eos> My wife gave me a fat-man scarf!<eos> I did a few freelance modeling gigs.<eos> I was the "wowee face" for an amusement park ad.<eos> That's actually really great.<eos> - Oh, that was you.<eos> - We really gotta get you working.<eos> Let me take a few photos to send to a photographer I used to work with.<eos> - Do some model looks.
I have a girlfriend., and I am very much so devoted to her. Aw.<eos> Here's my number.<eos> Use it.<eos> She didn't listen to a word...<eos> Throw a peanut out of frustration!<eos> Okay, why are you even here?<eos> I thought the whole point of promoting me was you could go off and write.<eos> I would love to be writing, but thanks to you, all I can do is look at Donovan's face and try to figure out why humans find it appealing.<eos> This is insane... you have to be able to admit that he's attractive.<eos> I do...
- Can I make a confession?<eos> - I wish you wouldn't.<eos> - When I was under...<eos> - Here we go.<eos> I saw a bright light.<eos> And I felt that I had the choice to either go into the light or to come back to you.<eos> And well, here we are.<eos> Mm... this is gonna be a tough one.<eos> - You know what's so great?<eos> - No. I don't.
- Yes.<eos> Let's see.<eos> KXHD136.<eos> You memorized the package tracking number, but you didn't know that you could use that number to track the package?<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> 9:18 A.M. refused delivery?<eos> Did you refuse a package to Retired Rear Admiral Jay Garage-A-Roo?<eos> Listen to what you just asked.<eos> Of course I did.
It's fairly obvious who I do have.<eos> I figured it out.<eos> You have Cece.<eos> - Oh. - My Cece.<eos> My Cece can't go gift-less.<eos> I like to think of her as our Cece.<eos> You screwed the pooch on this one, Winston.<eos> Me?<eos> I didn't screw the pooch.<eos> - Yes, you did.
All right, Cece. That big boy's for you.<eos> What in the hell is that?<eos> Winston, what'd you do with the thing we just bought?<eos> Beanbag chair!<eos> Beanbag chair!<eos> It's from Winston!<eos> They had to make it out of this dumb blanket.<eos> Winston, you remembered our game night.<eos> I love it.<eos> You do?

Two hugs, two bourbons, and a two-hour tirade on the state of America.<eos> Everyone disagrees with their parents.<eos> It's a little bit more than that with us.<eos> My father's a judge.<eos> He's textbook law and order.<eos> Last year, he called me an extremist just because I told him I was a member of the NRA.<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything wrong with being a patriot.<eos> All Americans should have the right to defend themselves.<eos> So you have a gun?<eos> You don't?
Is that really true?<eos> So, do I just wash my hands of him?<eos> Like Pontius Pilate?<eos> Well, I have no doubt Aelle will enjoy the sight of your death.<eos> Mmm.<eos> I'm sure he'll make it a big spectacle.<eos> So I will have the chance to speak?<eos> I'll talk about the gods, about my joy of entering Valhalla.<eos> Even though you don't believe it.<eos> I don't.

You heard;<eos> He believes the same things as his father.<eos> You already killed Rittenhouse.<eos> There's no need to kill the boy.<eos> Flynn! Guys, help me out!<eos> You guys find Flynn, I'll go find the boy.<eos> No, no. No, please don't kill me.<eos> Please. Please. Please don't kill me.<eos> No. No, no, no. Don't kill me.<eos> Please! Please don't!
If I could give them 14 more days, I would.<eos> And you wouldn't have to worry, because I cannot be defeated.<eos> So it would seem.<eos> Narcissus.<eos> Sorry, Emperor, I didn't mean to startle you.<eos> You of all people should know better than to sneak up on a gladiator, especially one with the blood of his vanquished opponent still fresh on his blade.<eos> It was a good battle.<eos> Attilius fought valiantly.<eos> Indeed he did.<eos> They all did.
That's because the government granted supply contracts to entrepreneurs.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It was his own fault!<eos> Why make excuses for him?<eos> Oh right. We're out of soy sauce.<eos> Mother-in-law, I'll go and buy some soy sauce.<eos> What about money?<eos> That money was for his father's life! His father's life!<eos> Welcome.<eos> How do you do things here?
Are Paul and Rachel still okay?<eos> And so it was a very, very sad flight back home.<eos> Very sad flight back home.<eos> [phone pad beeping]<eos> [Collett] We were obviously very upset, very despondent.<eos> I mean, I'd just chucked away a lot of my money.<eos> We can't believe it anymore.<eos> We think they just want to keep us here.<eos> God knows why.<eos> Their God certainly doesn't.
What is this for?<eos> A token of my respect and gratitude.<eos> You did this city a huge service and it was high time someone said thank you.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What?<eos> - Ice-skating.<eos> - I don't know how to ice-skate.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Because I do.
Who are we kidding? I can't kill this thing.<eos> I nearly had dinner with it.<eos> Neither of us are killers.<eos> I am.<eos> You are?<eos> Detective Snuggles.<eos> Nana warned me not to leave my chocolate lying around.<eos> But it was just after Easter, and I had pulled in a big haul.<eos> I never thought that cat would find my stash.<eos> But he did.
With the thing.<eos> Not even an emergency, actually.<eos> It's...<eos> - Hey, is that a Food Magic?<eos> - 3000. I'll leave you boys to it.<eos> But, Jim, tonight... celebration!<eos> Looking forward.<eos> Seriously, we've got a Defcon One situation in Trollmarket.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do!
Why do you always have to be such a grump?<eos> We have the Bridge. Trollmarket is safe once again.<eos> But his teacher changeling is still at large.<eos> - I trust our Trollhunter can handle it. - Hi.<eos> He has an excellent trainer.<eos> Well, you said you wanted adventure and something more.<eos> - Did that amulet help you find it?<eos> - No.<eos> - No?<eos> You did.
- Maybe now's not the best time.<eos> The drive belt's slipping.<eos> Pass me the wrench.<eos> - Hey, you're right.<eos> - So, you brought Claire to Trollmarket.<eos> You really like this girl.<eos> No secrets between you two.<eos> Screwdriver?<eos> I thought you liked her too, Blink.<eos> Everyone else did. Ah!
- You bring news?<eos> - They're going to Gatto's Keep.<eos> For what purpose?<eos> I wasn't close enough to see, but they seek one of his treasures.<eos> I know of Gatto.<eos> If the hunter is foolish enough to deal with him, I doubt they will return.<eos> Did you bring the charm I require?<eos> Do you know what to do with it?<eos> Don't patronize me.<eos> Of course I do.
- He is consumed by it.<eos> If he is not stopped, this world will burn.<eos> I don't have the power to defeat a Guardian.<eos> Guardian is but a name.<eos> The true Guardians of this world are the people themselves.<eos> I know you see what the Kirin Tor can not.<eos> It's why you left them.<eos> No one can stand against the darkness... alone.<eos> I don't understand what you want me to do.<eos> Yes, you do.
Over here!<eos> We'll go behind the gate to attack them!<eos> Take care of him.<eos> We should leave.<eos> We save as many of our people as we can.<eos> It's the loneliness that makes us weak.<eos> Khadgar.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wanted to save us all.<eos> I always did.
It's not all good.<eos> Welcome back to life.<eos> They call me Grizzly Bear Daniels.<eos> They call me Pee-wee Herman.<eos> [chuckles] Where are we?<eos> The woods.<eos> In the mountains.<eos> I gotta be on my way.<eos> - How do you get out of here?<eos> - You don't!
Anatoly Brodsky, do you know him?<eos> - Yes, I know Brodsky.<eos> - Right. Do you know where he is?<eos> - Brodsky? In Moscow, I think.<eos> - No, he's not in Moscow.<eos> But we have information that tells us that he's staying here with you.<eos> - No.<eos> - Oh, it's...<eos> Wait, you said something.<eos> Yes, you did.
He gave them the knife.<eos> We must get off this train.<eos> Jump, Raisa, now!<eos> Jump!<eos> It's impossible.<eos> The arrangements were made last minute.<eos> There's no paper trail.<eos> No one able to preplan.<eos> No one even knew which transport they were on.<eos> You did.
They are trapped and they are desperate.<eos> And your daughter is their ticket out of this purgatory.<eos> What do they want with her?<eos> They want her to be their lantern in the darkness.<eos> To lead them into the light.<eos> What happens if she goes into the light?<eos> There's no getting her back if she does that.<eos> Just because he said that, it doesn't mean... that's true, okay?<eos> Nothing you've said makes sense to me.<eos> And everything else does, right?
That's why I carry this.<eos> To remind myself that I can.<eos> Or maybe I carry it in case I can't.<eos> Here.<eos> Open it.<eos> It's sealed.<eos> Give it to me.<eos> It's shaking.<eos> Do you think I have it in me to never have another drink for the rest of my life?<eos> Yeah. I do.
- Me, too.<eos> - You still got some of that jerky?<eos> You still good on water?<eos> - About three-quarters.<eos> You?<eos> - Yeah, same.<eos> - Hey, Stephen?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Do you want to go home?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- I broke my tibia. Joined the Air Force.<eos> - Yeah, well, I dance alone.<eos> I'll back you up. We all work together.<eos> It's life.<eos> We got three wars going on right now.<eos> We're not in Coachella... waiting for the Molly to kick in so we can writhe in the mud... and wait for Tupac's hologram to come on and make us feel things.<eos> - Understood.<eos> - Good.<eos> You're cynical. I get it.<eos> I really do.
Our monarch is fluent in many languages.<eos> I want to remain in her service.<eos> There is no better position than that of a lady-in-waiting.<eos> None sire, none.<eos> There is only one way for you to remain in her service.<eos> That is against God's will!<eos> Is fornicating outside of wedlock, a Christian act?<eos> But I love him...<eos> Of course...<eos> Of course you do...
- Left side clear.<eos> - Right side clear.<eos> Room clear!<eos> - Do you live here, sir?<eos> - Do you live here?<eos> - This is my studio.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Linus Harp.<eos> Do you know who occupies the opposite studio?<eos> No... No one does.
Are you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Where is he?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Hey, cop!<eos> You're not him.<eos> - You want a moment alone with him?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Did you get the guy?<eos> - No, Katherine did.
Liquid metal.<eos> Shape-changer.<eos> It just needs to touch something to mimic it.<eos> You know about terminators?<eos> And you know who I am?<eos> You were sent to protect me by John Connor, the leader of the Resistance.<eos> My son.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You can't know any of this.<eos> But I do.
Can't crack it, John.<eos> Maybe it just can't be done.<eos> "What do we want?"<eos> Time travel.<eos> - "And when do we want it?"<eos> - It's irrelevant.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Good thing, too.<eos> We're years away from making this thing work.<eos> But when we do... - Boom!
I grew up with Billy, Southie.<eos> So, I know him, I know that he knows that it would be crazy for him to get mixed up in anything that Jimmy does.<eos> It's, you know... too brazen.<eos> I'll ask you again...<eos> how come no one has done Whitey Bulger?<eos> He seems to be involved in every crime in the city and yet the Bureau keeps saying he's clean.<eos> It's only when another agency has an informant that I hear maybe Whitey isn't so squeaky clean.<eos> Well, I hear that he's very careful, he doesn't use phones... that kind of stuff, and...<eos> Who did you say these other informants were?<eos> I didn't.
It's a start. Damn!<eos> Why you riding me so hard?<eos> I'm not riding you, baby.<eos> I'm trying to make you understand.<eos> And you know how I run my house.<eos> Now you gonna have to go to school or you gonna have to go to work.<eos> Now I don't even care if you are a janitor. I don't care what the hell you do...<eos> Long as I own the company. I know, I know.<eos> But you don't own the company.<eos> - Lonzo does. - Okay.
But I don't know your relationship with dude.<eos> But if you want me, Eric, Jerry can't be there.<eos> It's 'cause you ain't got them damn gloves on.<eos> Man, whatever.<eos> But I hear you.<eos> These invoices haven't been paid. They're two or three years outdated.<eos> These are cancelled checks. They all bounced. And these are past due.<eos> Jerry took advantage of you.<eos> I know it's a lot, but you had to know the truth sometime.<eos> Now you do.
Yeah, I know what that's like.<eos> You were adopted?<eos> No, I, I just wish that I was.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't know, I just, we don't really understand each other.<eos> - Where were you born?<eos> - Kosovo.<eos> - Kosovo.<eos> You don't have an accent.<eos> [with thick accent] I don't?
The NSA has a $52 billion budget and the ability to monitor tens of millions of calls a second. You think they're not using it?<eos> Hey, I promise I will refrain from saying<eos> "Ben Rickert" and "dirty bomb" in the same sent...<eos> - I'm sorry, dude.<eos> Ben Rickert.<eos> Did you get a chance to look at what we sent you, Ben?<eos> It's Charlie.<eos> I'm here, too.<eos> Hi, Charlie.<eos> Yeah, I did.
- I think so, yeah. God!<eos> I pulled a muscle in my back from yelling.<eos> Mortgage defaults have done nothing but go up.<eos> Yet you quote us a higher price on the bonds.<eos> Please explain that to me. There's no way that makes sense.<eos> There's no way you're marking these swaps appropriately.<eos> Why shouldn't we back out of this trade right now?<eos> Didn't I say when we made this deal that the ratings agencies, the SEC and the big banks were clueless? Didn't I say that? - Yes.<eos> - Didn't I say it? Yes, you did.<eos> You did.
You know, just...<eos> - You haven't really talked about it?<eos> - Well, not really, no.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think He has a plan... and all three of us are part of it somehow.<eos> But it was us believers, don't you think?<eos> Just like this valley... why it survived, why you and I did... because we have faith.<eos> What if you don't have faith?<eos> You have to.<eos> - Not everybody does.
Bees don't lie.<eos> Oh, I...<eos> Sorry, I gotta take this.<eos> I'm guessing Titus didn't say anything about it.<eos> No.<eos> Must have slipped his mind.<eos> Not easy to picture you making a deal with a royal.<eos> Titus told me you were posted to this planet and said if I helped him, he'd get you your wings back, full reinstatement.<eos> - I figured I owed you.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
- OK.<eos> - Alright? So-so after that, then what?<eos> I... I don't know Doug.<eos> But I know I love you.<eos> We can always see each other carefully.<eos> Next year you're out of your parents' house right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We can actually be together.<eos> If you still want to, after all this.<eos> Of course I do.
It has to be this way.<eos> Here...<eos> To ensure the freedom and safety of self and her daughter...<eos> Adaline vowed to keep moving, changing her name, residence and appearance every decade.<eos> And never to speak a word, of her fate to another living soul.<eos> In 7 weeks when Jenifer Larson, disappears forever... and Susan Flietcher takes up residence in a remote farmhouse in Ashton, Oregon...<eos> Adaline Bowman, beside from one moment of weakness will have kept her vow for the past 60 years.<eos> Hello, Ray again?<eos> Amanda, you're not gonna stand me up are you?<eos> Yes, we did that last year.
Wait!<eos> Watch out!<eos> Captain, my horse.<eos> No!<eos> This may be some intrigue to lure you from the palace.<eos> Your father needs you here.<eos> Captain!<eos> I was having a fine old time.<eos> You had to go and choose that one, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Sorry to interrupt, Mr. Arthur, heh, but, um, with all due respect, I'm...<eos> You're honored and thrilled to lend that Bianca Piper magic?<eos> You wanna do your thing and put some stuff in the words and make it pop?<eos> That's so nice of you.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> "No, you didn't. I didn't say..."<eos> Yes, you did. And thank...<eos> "No, I didn't, I didn't." Yes, you did.<eos> And I thank you.<eos> You did.
So is everybody.<eos> There's always gonna be somebody prettier or more talented or richer than you, but it shouldn't affect how you see yourself.<eos> You label everybody to try to keep them down, but you end up missing out on all this great stuff around you.<eos> You have Wesley, and you treat him like he's stupid, but he isn't.<eos> And people don't like him, because he's with you.<eos> They like him because he's, like, an amazing guy.<eos> Look, I like myself.<eos> I wouldn't wanna be anybody else.<eos> And I realize now that none of this matters to me.<eos> But it does to you.
You beg me to text you sexy stuff all day.<eos> I know, but Sloan was lookin' at my phone.<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't realize you were at the doctor's already.<eos> And why's she looking at your phone?<eos> Ah, you know.<eos> I was showin' her a picture of my cousin's baby.<eos> Great.<eos> Yeah, she must really think I'm a whore.<eos> No, she doesn't.
The wife to have bigger tits... only sometimes.<eos> But I'm... what are you doin'?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> You didn't come to bed.<eos> No, I... I haven't...<eos> What?<eos> What, are you praying?<eos> Yeah. Somethin' wrong with that?<eos> Well, you don't believe in God, so...<eos> For the good stuff, I do.
Look, Ari, I have thoughts about this movie, and my father would like for you to take them seriously.<eos> Thoughts?<eos> You have notes?<eos> Whatever you want to call them. But most of them revolve around cutting out Vincent chase's mutant brother.<eos> Drama.<eos> Yeah. He's an abomination and he's got to go.<eos> The challenge for me was I was the only human in that scene.<eos> Everyone else was living dead.<eos> So how did that affect how you played the role?<eos> It didn't.
I'm confused.<eos> Is this a business meeting?<eos> Uh...<eos> 'Cause I didn't know.<eos> I didn't know either.<eos> I-is this a date?<eos> I don't cook for people who are tryin' to pitch me.<eos> Whatever.<eos> I thought a nice, normal guy wanted to hang out for once.<eos> I did!

Take pictures.<eos> What, did you bring a date?<eos> Oh, no, no, no. No.<eos> We just ran into each other.<eos> I just met him last night.<eos> Oh.<eos> Is this your girlfriend?<eos> Uh...<eos> 'Cause last night, you said you didn't have a girlfriend.<eos> I don't.
Yeah, I-I disagree.<eos> It's probably 'cause you're too close to it.<eos> You can't see it clearly 'cause he's your brother.<eos> As an artist, I'm pretty unbiased.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe there's a bigger issue that's making you not like his character, Travis.<eos> I mean, he's pretty pivotal in the movie, including the final scene.<eos> I don't really understand how you could just cut him out.<eos> Yeah, I-I think that bigger issue thing makes sense.<eos> Oh. D-did you have other problems with the movie?<eos> Yeah, I did.
It was getting late.<eos> I should have taken them in.<eos> But I... I couldn't put that book down.<eos> He writes too well.<eos> I put a... name-tag on his jacket the day before.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> Don't think that way.<eos> There's no connection.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
Don't "what" me, just do it.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yeah, I'm serious.<eos> I saw you checking out my ass earlier.<eos> I know you want to do it.<eos> Just kiss me.<eos> -No, I wasn't.<eos> -Ben!<eos> -Okay, for a second I did.
-Yeah?<eos> Look, I don't know what's gonna happen, but I just wanted to let you know that you're one of the coolest girls I've ever met.<eos> And I hope you meet someone that deserves you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Guys, let's go.<eos> We got to get to the party.<eos> Ben, this is a suicide mission.<eos> Guys, they're gonna bomb this whole town in less than two hours.<eos> What if Denise reaches the military in time?<eos> And what if she doesn't, Carter? Then what?
How are we getting on?<eos> We have about 40% of the film, all the French motifs are missing, and parts of some Czech scenes.<eos> The question is whether the French would mind if we added a new storyline.<eos> - Boys, forget the French.<eos> - Wait, what about the French co-producer?<eos> - There is none.<eos> - What do you mean there is none?<eos> I have the phone number for the French co-producer.<eos> - Leave it be.<eos> - But I do!
- Thank you so much for... Thank you.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So, now that the educational portion of the day is over, let's get to the fun stuff.<eos> What fun stuff? Like...<eos> No, we're just gonna go back home.<eos> Right?<eos> - No, you said a day. Remember?<eos> - No, I didn't. - We agreed to it, Samantha.<eos> - Yes, he did!<eos> - Yes, he did.
- All right.<eos> - I wanna go swimming.<eos> No, no, no, we can't go swimming.<eos> In fact, you gotta get ready for bed.<eos> I'm not tired, and I really want to go swimming.<eos> Okay, I'll make a deal with you guys.<eos> We'll start to wind the engines down.<eos> You guys can sit here quietly and watch some TV.<eos> We're not getting any channels.<eos> - Did you...?
Do you want to know what everybody called me?<eos> - What?<eos> - They called me a slut.<eos> Do you remember that? Hello?<eos> Do you remember that or not?<eos> Petra, I'm sorry.<eos> It was sixth grade, I didn't know what I was doing, and I'm sorry.<eos> It's fine.<eos> I probably didn't have any titties to whisper to anyway.<eos> Nobody did.
Excuse me, do you know where the publishers office is?<eos> Will do it.<eos> How are you Marty, settling in?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> Good. What can I do for you?<eos> I'd like to challenge the protective order in the Geoghan case.<eos> You want to sue the Catholic Church?<eos> We're just filing the motion, but... Yes.<eos> - You think it's that important?<eos> - Yes, I do.
- I'm Mike Rezendes from Boston Globe...<eos> I had an appointment with you, about an hour ago.<eos> I can't talk to you, I'm busy.<eos> Sharon!<eos> She went for coffee, she said she'll be right back.<eos> I'm not following up on an article.<eos> - The one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, in the Globe.<eos> - Did you see the one in the Phoenix?<eos> - No, I didn't.
I don't want you recording this in any way, shape or form.<eos> - Not on paper, not on tape, nothing.<eos> - Ok.<eos> In fact, I probably shouldn't even be speaking to you.<eos> So...<eos> Look, Mr. Garabedian, I know there's... things, you cannot tell me, but... I also know there's a story here.. and I think it's an important story.<eos> - I already talked to the Phoenix.<eos> - Yeah, there's a reason I didn't see it.<eos> Nobody reads a Phoenix anymore... they're broke, they don't have any power.<eos> The Globe does.
Jugde Sweeney set a date for the hearing.<eos> - Really, when?<eos> - In two weeks, in Springfield.<eos> Canellos started a pool of 10 bucks to get in.<eos> Anyone picking The Globe?<eos> He's only taking bets on how fast Sweeney rules against us.<eos> - Robby.<eos> - Hi, it's me.<eos> - Did you get my message?<eos> - I did.
About 1,500. 1% is 15, 6% is... 90?<eos> - Right, 90 priests.<eos> - Is that possible?<eos> From a metric standpoint. Yes. That would certainly be in line with my findings.<eos> Hello?<eos> 90 fucking priests?<eos> In Boston?<eos> That's what he said.<eos> If there were 90 of these bastards, people would know.<eos> - Maybe they do.
No way!<eos> - Let me out of this car!<eos> - Stop yelling!<eos> - Let me out now! - No!<eos> I will not!<eos> I gave you my very last pin, young lady, and I am not about to let it go to waste.<eos> What do you mean your last pin?<eos> Wait, that place I saw...<eos> - It exists?<eos> - Of course it does.
Remind you of what?<eos> That God if at all He does exist sent us into this world imperfect.<eos> We're weak.<eos> We're fragile.<eos> And we're destined to die.<eos> This reminds me that that is not good enough.<eos> Who were you with?<eos> You said "we".<eos> In the blizzard.<eos> Did I?
- Good?<eos> - Very good!<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay?<eos> No, you...<eos> You don't need to apologise... ever.<eos> You never have.<eos> Well, they got to be here somewhere.<eos> They must've gone off for a hike or something.<eos> You do the ricotta?
Ma'am, the battery died.<eos> Our man is down. We cannot replace it.<eos> Christ.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Battery.<eos> For God's sake!<eos> Now we have no idea what they are doing.<eos> I might have a solution.<eos> If my targeted can calculate us coming in under 50% for collateral damage on the girl. Do you think you can get approval at your end?<eos> Yes, I do.
I'll have someone get Lisa.<eos> Thank you.<eos> And if you see Hertzfeld...<eos> It's Andy!<eos> Speak of the devil's chief engineer.<eos> Go.<eos> Come on in.<eos> You look great today.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Doesn't she?
You know, when people used to ask me what the difference was between me and Steve Jobs, I would say Steve was the big-picture guy and I liked a solid workbench.<eos> When people ask me what the difference is now, I say<eos> Steve's an asshole.<eos> Your products are better than you are, brother.<eos> That's the idea, "brother."<eos> And knowing that, that's the difference.<eos> It's not binary.<eos> You can be decent and gifted at the same time.<eos> He didn't mean it.<eos> Yeah, he did.
The computer.<eos> The Lisa.<eos> Do you know what it stood for?<eos> I'm sorry I said that about the iMac.<eos> It's not what I really think.<eos> Behind my back, at the office, you know what it stood for?<eos> Local Integrated System Architecture.<eos> I was five!<eos> Why couldn't you just lie?<eos> I did.
I couldn't enjoy calorie one without my family.<eos> I'm going back to save them!<eos> Aw, if I could just live inside that head, so full of noble thoughts.<eos> The golden rule states if the chosen one escapes, his family is eaten as forfeit.<eos> What do your rules say now?<eos> That all will be eaten.<eos> D'oh!<eos> This system is really rigged against us.<eos> You forgot to glaze me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Are you kidding me?<eos> Blake.<eos> I want you to know that I respect what you and your dad have.<eos> And I know that your mom moving in has to feel like a pretty big step.<eos> But I'm never gonna try to change what you have with him or take his place.<eos> Okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, cool.<eos> Hey, how come you never had kids?<eos> Oh, I did.
Wait, I'll show you.<eos> Oli, try another way!<eos> First, it's important to press the panel and push it in gently.<eos> So ' now turn It "on"!<eos> So, you come from another school, don't you?<eos> Yep.<eos> Why did you decided to come here?<eos> It was lust too strict over there? They weren't cool?<eos> My Mom told me I should try something else.<eos> So I did.
When he got better again.. ..the fool tried to lock horns with it again.<eos> People say my brother is crazy.<eos> But I like my brother.<eos> And you too.<eos> Mr. Sharma, I've decided.. ..that I'm going to take the bull by its horns.<eos> We'll see what happens.<eos> You do love me, don't you?<eos> No, I'll believe it when you say it convincingly.<eos> 'Say it convincingly, or I'm getting out of here.'<eos> Yes, I do.
You take anything with it?<eos> Oh, um... black.<eos> Samina's moving to Jackson Heights. With the kids.<eos> And she is going back to school.<eos> She wants to be an architect. At 45.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't have to say this but I did you have an affair with Isabelle?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yes, yes I did.
But I will be a hero Boov for getting your password.<eos> Yes!<eos> You has in nick-time saved us!<eos> What is the purpose of your face?<eos> Owpain.<eos> You were gonna ditch me?<eos> - No!<eos> - Liar!<eos> I never lie!<eos> Yes, you do!
I'm gonna give you the same break that you gave me.<eos> Tell me you love me, and if I believe it, then I'll let you keep it.<eos> But if I don't believe you, that means you're a bad boy.<eos> And bad boys need to be punished.<eos> So that the envy of all mankind will have to go away with me.<eos> I... love you.<eos> - What'd you say?<eos> - I love you.<eos> I don't think that sounded very sincere.<eos> - Did it?
Actually, right now I'd like you to react as if I've said something humanitarian yet hilarious.<eos> Happy Valentine's, sexy.<eos> Little gift to yourself?<eos> Nope.<eos> I'm already wearing mine.<eos> All right, I'm off.<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> - Oh, what?<eos> Sweetheart, you know I think it's all a load of commercialised bollocks, right?<eos> Yes, I do.
Just because you made up some of your own routines... doesn't mean you get to waltz back in and tell us how to run our own shit.<eos> - I'm not trying to tell you... - No!<eos> There is no fucking universe in which I am not doing that fireman routine!<eos> You can find it, man.<eos> You got to just let go, okay?<eos> - I fucking got it! - What?<eos> - It's like a real wedding except like a fantasy.<eos> Then I go out in the crowd and find myself a real fucking bride.<eos> - Oh, fuck!<eos> - And I do everything with her!
Out with the past.<eos> I never wanted to be in the Navy!<eos> - I don't want this Top Gun shit.<eos> Gone! - Yeah!<eos> Oh, baby!<eos> It's time.<eos> That shit itched.<eos> - Boom, that's out of here!<eos> - Fuck that thing!<eos> Richie? Done!
I mean, what was that with Cassidy? The TV?<eos> What was your dad doing there?<eos> What is that about?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> Cassidy's hurt and you haven't said anything? Are you serious?<eos> Don't put this on me.<eos> You're the reason we came here.<eos> Yeah, but maybe you're the reason all this shit's happening to us!<eos> - Don't even do that, okay?
Adam, please.<eos> I love him, I love him.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> I know he's kind and good and smart.<eos> So smart, and...<eos> And I know the way he makes me feel.<eos> I love him.<eos> I know you don't understand that but I love him.<eos> I do.
Eat me, drink me.<eos> Good morning Anastasia.<eos> - How you feeling?<eos> - Better than I deserve.<eos> Did you put me to bed?<eos> - You undressed me?<eos> - I didn't have much choice<eos> Where did you sleep?<eos> - Dear god...<eos> We didn't...
Glover!<eos> Whoa!<eos> Oh, you freezing?<eos> You freezing cold?<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, hey! Hey, you're back.<eos> I didn't see... see you get here.<eos> Hey, what's everybody doing out here in a state of undress?<eos> I'll give you two guesses.<eos> - You didn't...
You're so lucky you don't have to deal with that shit.<eos> - Gerry, I tell you.<eos> So, what do you have for me today?<eos> This is about $80.<eos> I had the rest, but...<eos> - Meth head.<eos> - Fucking meth head.<eos> - Bad beat. - The worst.<eos> - Things will look up.<eos> - They always do.
Do you have a picture?<eos> She lives with her mom in Little Rock.<eos> I have problems with money.<eos> Did I say anything about money?<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> No, it was... It was something I wanted to tell you so I don't...<eos> I'm gonna do something with my life.<eos> I may not have that figured out yet, but I'm gonna do something.<eos> It's something I wanted to tell you.<eos> So I did.
Just tell me.<eos> Don't say that you don't know. I know that you know.<eos> I'll tell her that you called. No, and you know what?<eos> Forget that...<eos> Forget that I called, okay?<eos> - Curtis...<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Vanessa, listen to me, don't tell her that I called, okay?<eos> Don't. - Okay.
I just call them "Nancy's pants."<eos> Chuck just showed us... your redbook rates only make sense if we're doing buybacks.<eos> I'm not doing buyback deals until it's out the door and we refactor market.<eos> I just wanna be clear that those are the terms now.<eos> So, Jim, you're opening the deal back up?<eos> Well, it wasn't closed quite, Dan.<eos> So, I just wanted to hear you both under these new terms today.<eos> Just you and Chuck, that's all.<eos> Those pants are so tight, you'd think I could see your balls or your dick.<eos> But I don't.
Oh...<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> And, well, would you get married again?<eos> - Has somebody asked you?<eos> - No.<eos> Not really.<eos> I won't ask what that means.<eos> Would I get married again?<eos> No, I wanna be waiting outside the bathroom of my boarding house forever.<eos> Of course I do.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> No act.. you know what?<eos> Please, don't tell me that, because it's just another thing I would have to lie about in my weekly polygraph.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Just keep walking.<eos> But, make sure you're not being follow.ed Oh.<eos> I didn't win those opera tickets, did I?<eos> No, I'm afraid not<eos> - So, where do we meet?<eos> - We don't.
Please.<eos> You must be very excited with all these beautiful women .<eos> - Do you suppose?<eos> - You do more than guess.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> - God!<eos> - Just...<eos> Please never put that face again.<eos> - I do not even want to know what it means.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Tell me.<eos> - I want to know how!<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How, how, how?<eos> - Leave her alone!<eos> - How?<eos> - It was her.<eos> Was she right? Was it.<eos> Was it.<eos> But I did not.
So you hired outside contractors... so you could claim anonymity.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And then I guess you found out I was involved... when I helped Jeremy out with his loan thing.<eos> Oh, fucking Jeremy.<eos> And then you told them where to find me... and they found out about Andrea?<eos> I thought she was some weekend prostitute or something along those lines.<eos> I was shocked to find out you actually had a kid.<eos> Didn't really work out.<eos> No.<eos> No, it didn't.
I'm gonna miss these little talks of ours.<eos> Not if you don't leave.<eos> I have no choice.<eos> The Mind Stone is the fourth of the Infinity Stones to show up in the last few years.<eos> It's not a coincidence.<eos> Someone has been playing an intricate game and has made pawns of us.<eos> And once all these pieces are in position...<eos> Triple Yahtzee.<eos> You think you can find out what's coming?<eos> I do.
I don't even understand a lot of the words in your book.<eos> I sat there with a dictionary.<eos> I try to learn.<eos> But I'm never going to be smart.<eos> And I'm ugly.<eos> I find it enormously charming that you read any book with a dictionary next to you.<eos> My last boyfriend was eight years ago. And he wasn't even my boyfriend.<eos> He was almost 60 and fat and he worked in Human Resources and he had a wife and his daughter was older than me.<eos> And the only reason he pursued me was because he thought he'd have a good shot.<eos> Which he did.
I'm sorry, I can't help you.<eos> Patty, I'm in a real jam here.<eos> This is life or death stuff.<eos> Runner... I am dealing with some really bad stuff.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Ben is in big trouble.<eos> It's bad.<eos> He'll need a lawyer.<eos> So you do have money.<eos> No, I don't.
Now? would you excuse me.<eos> I... Just be one moment.<eos> Of course.<eos> Hello?<eos> Theresa belivet?<eos> Yes. We're patching you though.<eos> So it was you.<eos> Oh hello.<eos> Mrs. Arid? Did you receive the train set alright?<eos> I did. Yes.
I'm talking... serious Rita Hayworth redhead.<eos> Really? You think you got what it takes to handle a redhead?<eos> You going somewhere?<eos> - West. I thought.<eos> At least for a few weeks until the hearing.<eos> What else am I going to do?<eos> I know you don't like to drive alone. So.<eos> She's young.<eos> Tell me you know what you're doing.<eos> I don't.

Okay, everyone, listen up.<eos> I know this is the last day of school...<eos> But first, before we leave... we need to finish picking our partners for this year's summer pen-pal project.<eos> When I draw a name, stand if you want to be their partner.<eos> Here we go. The next name is...<eos> Pigpen!<eos> I will.<eos> A little dirt never hurt anyone.<eos> Schroeder.<eos> I do!
She probably watched the tape.<eos> Mike, she's three feet tall.<eos> She has no idea even what a VCR is.<eos> She couldn't reach up there, put it in and hit "play."<eos> And get the right tape.<eos> That makes me feel old.<eos> Kids don't know what VCRs are?<eos> What was that?<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> - You did? -Yeah, man.
I wasn't.<eos> - I was with Finn.<eos> - Fine, fine, Doctor Attenborough.<eos> Just don't go bringing any of those in here.<eos> Of course you did.<eos> Those ants really do it for you, don't they?<eos> - I need to drain the pasta.<eos> - I know.<eos> Is that why you're stepping on my foot?<eos> I do.
- Yes, My Lord.<eos> We have the gift for Minister Gezza Mott?<eos> Yes, it's all taken care of.<eos> - Gabriel.<eos> - Commander.<eos> - Thank you for this great honor.<eos> - I knew your mother and father well.<eos> If they were still among us, they would be very proud.<eos> - So it begins again.<eos> - So it does.
I'm comin' with you.<eos> Follow after at your own pace.<eos> If we get there before you catch up, I'll try to refrain from flirting with Mrs. O'Dwyer.<eos> God!<eos> Don't you talk that way about my wife!<eos> I know you had designs!<eos> That was years ago.<eos> And she refused me.<eos> And now I'm out here risking my life for both of you perhaps that entitles me to an occasional innuendo.<eos> Well, it doesn't!
Oh, some weren't braves?<eos> Some weren't men.<eos> Oh.<eos> An Indian woman is still an Indian.<eos> She knows how to use a bow and a spear, and so do her children.<eos> Why do you hate them so much?<eos> You should ask my mother and my sisters.<eos> I never met 'em.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You never did.
- Sorry, can't handle your breath.<eos> - I hear ya.<eos> How are you?<eos> We're having a blast.<eos> We just went biking and mini-marting.<eos> It's so fun here.<eos> - Is Dennis okay?<eos> - Oh. Of course.<eos> - You want to see him?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.
- I thought you knew.<eos> That you were here in Barcelona, huh?<eos> That you were coming to dinner?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's easy to say now, isn't it, James?<eos> Just tell Felix if he still wants to give me the information that he got, I'll be at 93 Calle Hercules, apartment 4D.<eos> - You moved back to London?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I had been in DRC, where I spent the past year, helping out, following your lead.<eos> Don't.
I'm a pilot. I'm a pilot.<eos> That is so cool.<eos> That's what I wanna be when I grow up.<eos> Tell me everything about it.<eos> Every single detail. Son, there is nothing like the feeling of guiding that bird up to 36,000 feet.<eos> Someday you'll come up with me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you two keep talking, I'm gonna get dessert ready, okay?<eos> Wow, there's just so much I didn't know.<eos> Well, now you do.
Take the lady's belongings.<eos> I will grab master's.<eos> Take the horses for their feed after we finish here.<eos> Goodness.<eos> How many rooms are there?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Would you like to count them?<eos> What do you think?<eos> Does it look the part?<eos> It does.
- Why, when you are here? So you can do it when I'm not.<eos> - Evening all.<eos> - Good evening, Mrs. Hardcastle.<eos> - In before midnight.<eos> - Only two customers.<eos> I finished my shift early.<eos> I felt like being alone.<eos> Oh, call for the doctor, Sonny.<eos> Nimish asked me to marry him this morning.<eos> And Abhilash did the same this afternoon.
Fuck!<eos> Fuck someone!<eos> Fuck a tit!<eos> Fuck a tit hard!<eos> For the love of Alan Greenspan.<eos> Fuck!<eos> My life is ruined.<eos> I venture you've heard that I'm going to prison.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, we all did.
It's not exactly what I wanted to say to you.<eos> But whatever.<eos> Let's just watch this first, okay?<eos> Hey, should I get a nurse?<eos> Denise!<eos> That was the last time I saw Rachel.<eos> She went into a coma shortly after that, and died about 10 hours later.<eos> I know I told you she doesn't die. And I'm sorry.<eos> Deep down somehow, I didn't think she would.<eos> But she did.
And the kid.<eos> Just the four of us, like it used to be.<eos> As friends.<eos> I can't, I have to work.<eos> In the Mercury?<eos> That's not until 10, is it?<eos> We'll eat at half seven and you go after. Perfect!<eos> Come on, Sylvie.<eos> - You know me, don't you?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> That Moroccan wouldn't be dead.<eos> What?<eos> Did you really think you could hide something like that?<eos> You have to tell your brother a thing like that.<eos> It's not possible to talk to you.<eos> I've been trying my whole life.<eos> Did you listen, even once?<eos> Do you know how it feels, to be humiliated by a woman?<eos> No... you don't.
What the hell is happening?<eos> I don't know, sir.<eos> I want to know who's doing this.<eos> I need answers.<eos> Give me an update.<eos> I said, give me an update!<eos> I said, status!<eos> I suppose I should be flattered.<eos> I didn't think I merited a contract.<eos> You don't.
Come on, Doc.<eos> I don't want to do this.<eos> Believe me, you don't want me to do this either.<eos> So tell me what I need to know.<eos> Tell me... how to make an Agent.<eos> This shit's experimental, Doc.<eos> I've seen it work... and believe me when I tell you you don't wanna be the one it's working on.<eos> You're a bastard.<eos> I know.<eos> No. You don't.
Hey!<eos> I was sincere, wasn't I?<eos> Won't that do?<eos> What must I do to get out of here?<eos> Why is she here?<eos> I thought she was just for the spa.<eos> It's kind of her to come and support me.<eos> You'll see, she's nice.<eos> José, do you still love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Yes.<eos> Get in.<eos> This is my plane tree.<eos> A friend.<eos> That's where me and my bike died.<eos> Why bring me here?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> Why marry that goody two-shoes?<eos> You don't love him.<eos> Yes, I do!
Can't I talk to my wife?<eos> I'm disappointed in you, little José.<eos> He's done nothing!<eos> It's me who sold the house!<eos> We just wanted a new life.<eos> And now look.<eos> Sorry.<eos> José, I think I shouldn't have sold the house.<eos> You regret it?<eos> - Yes, she does.

- Well done, Félix!<eos> - Champion!<eos> Well done.<eos> Félix Portal, winner.<eos> That was cheating, Alphonse.<eos> Unworthy of a hero.<eos> I know.<eos> But it's true.<eos> I don't know how to box.<eos> I never did.
Freedom...<eos> What are you doing with mine?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You want to be mayor. It's your right.<eos> I want a new life. It's my right.<eos> Be quiet!<eos> I'm fed up of this angry soul.<eos> Maybe it's Firmin.<eos> No one thinks of him.<eos> I do.
Johnny Li, Yan Lin, Samuel Wu.<eos> Li just got out of prison two months ago.<eos> Yan and his mother are both junkies.<eos> Wu runs a chop shop.<eos> Hardly commodities speculators.<eos> They're fronts?<eos> Proxies?<eos> So how do they communicate?<eos> How do they connect up to our actor?<eos> They don't.
I'll put the gun down.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Hello, Jonathan.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> He's...<eos> That case you stole from this asshole belongs to me.<eos> Well, you may not know this, not from being around these parts, but I'm in the business of collecting money, not giving it away.<eos> I thought Jonathan might have told you that.<eos> I kind of did.
Keep this one.<eos> How could you say that to her?<eos> It was a joke.<eos> To the woman who's gonna be my boss?<eos> To the woman who I hope is gonna launch my career?<eos> That lady?<eos> Come on.<eos> No, you come on. You know how hard I have just tried to fit into your world.<eos> Why can't you try to fit into mine?<eos> I do!
They're used to... Clint always ate first.<eos> Well, I'm not Clint, so go ahead, eat.<eos> So, were you a cop or something?<eos> Oh, yeah. A sheriff's deputy.<eos> So you saw dead bodies and stuff?<eos> - Zachary.<eos> - What?<eos> Cops see dead bodies.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Yeah, I did.
That writer I was telling you about, Ellison Oswalt. He's a friend of mine.<eos> I gave him some files and some information, even after my boss told me not to.<eos> And since I was the last person to talk to him, and the only other person they saw coming and going from his home, I was a really easy suspect.<eos> I was cleared of all the charges.<eos> Your boss was pissed 'cause you went behind his back.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah. Fired me the day that I was cleared.<eos> You miss it, huh?<eos> Most days.<eos> Yeah, I do.
No, that's your next step.<eos> My next step is to search for images of naked ladies on my office computer.<eos> They won't let me search the dorm room until they talk to the head of Special Crimes.<eos> Which is you.<eos> I know who I am.<eos> Who's "they"?<eos> It's a matter of jurisdiction.<eos> Campus police handle student suicide.<eos> You understand.<eos> You don't.
That's because they stopped caring about life just entirely.<eos> That's not the same thing.<eos> My mom died, so don't even start with me about your pain.<eos> My uncle died.<eos> Shut up, Ruth.<eos> I need some answers.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I'm gonna be worse off now than I was before I started trying to achieve stuff.<eos> I know what it is to want things.<eos> No, you don't.
Hi.<eos> You didn't answer my texts.<eos> Holly, this is stupid.<eos> I'm...<eos> I love you.<eos> I'm sorry, Rob.<eos> - You know this won't work out.<eos> - That's a...<eos> - I don't know why you say that.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It's a question of semantics I suppose whether it's stealing or charity.<eos> - But it's all really the same.<eos> - That's enough!<eos> Everybody relax alright.<eos> You've made your point.<eos> - We'll get off your train alright.<eos> - Got you, would everybody just relax?<eos> Why don't we take a seat?<eos> - I was just trying to help!<eos> - Don't.
- Murder!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Murder!<eos> - Oh!<eos> Ah!<eos> Ooh!<eos> - Help!<eos> Help!<eos> - Don't...
Go on, get the fuck out of here!<eos> - You'll find me, yeah?<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> - You promise?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Brakes is right.<eos> About what?<eos> - Money's too heavy.<eos> - We had to leave a sack in that drum.<eos> - You did what?
Just take a seat, OK?<eos> All right.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Shouldn't we be going to the hospital?<eos> Look, we have all the same equipment here, and there's nobody more qualified to take care of you than me.<eos> They don't understand this.<eos> Just gonna get you stable first, OK?<eos> You're gonna be OK.<eos> - I thought I lost you.<eos> - You did.
I am a middle-aged man... willing to protect you for the rest of your life.<eos> You may run your farm, if you wish. Without risk.<eos> I'll pay your... departed husband's debts and guarantee its financial stability.<eos> It can be your pastime.<eos> Of course, we'd need to wait, for propriety's sake.<eos> But when you're ready, I'm offering you shelter.<eos> Comfort. A safe harbor.<eos> As my wife.<eos> You must at least admire my persistence.<eos> I do.
And here I am.<eos> Pulled from the sea.<eos> Some fishermen found me and brought me to shore.<eos> Then I discovered I was dead and found I preferred it.<eos> For a while, anyway.<eos> - Why have you come back?<eos> - The strangest thing. I missed you.<eos> You don't seem very happy to see me.<eos> You said I was nothing to you.<eos> Did I?
Okay.<eos> Any of you speak English?<eos> Any of you want to make a thousand euros?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Hi.<eos> How about a drink?<eos> How about your room?<eos> How the hell did they rob a bank?<eos> They'd have to have his...<eos> He did. They did.

I have what I'd like to call a sensitive soul.<eos> I can see and feel a lot more than some people.<eos> Makes for a wonderful palate. When I drink wine<eos> I can feel the grapes and soil and the weather.<eos> But sometimes... sometimes it goes deeper than that.<eos> I get connected to a person or a place.<eos> It comes out of nowhere.<eos> It wraps its fingers around your heart and won't let go.<eos> Did you see something at the house?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I did.
Did it work?<eos> The assistant director said it did.<eos> What made you think of a film about people losing their jobs!<eos> Mom, it's not a sad film, it's full of energy, hope.<eos> - It is?<eos> - Yes!<eos> Good.<eos> - Really!<eos> - I believe it.<eos> - No, you don't!
You don't know how you hurt the ones you love.<eos> Then they get boring and you sweep them from your life.<eos> That's not true!<eos> Margherita, you're always defensive, you just see the bad side, you make me feel ridiculous for wanting to be with you.<eos> Why treat me like this?<eos> Giorgio, we've already broken up.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Don't you have the slightest...<eos> - It's me, you know, don't you?<eos> - Of course I do.
She doesn't like me and that's that.<eos> Cut it out, Mrs. Capponi is excellent.<eos> - Livia, you don't study, that's it.<eos> But I did lots of quizzes for my license.<eos> - License?<eos> - For the scooter.<eos> The scooter is far off.<eos> But you promised!<eos> - We didn't promise a thing.<eos> - Dad did.
Livia?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Would you come here, please?<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Look what I found in the drawers.<eos> Why are you wearing your grandmother's robe?<eos> - I had a shower and found it.<eos> - Take it off, it bothers me.<eos> - Why? - It just does...
Jenny Hasboro was a 26-year-old medical student.<eos> Leonard Slomotov...<eos> Stop it.<eos> - ...11 children.<eos> - Stop.<eos> I read about them in the paper.<eos> I memorize their names.<eos> 621 people.<eos> That's on me.<eos> Don't.
- Hm-hmm.<eos> Shall I explain?<eos> - Please do.<eos> OK.<eos> You know when a woman first starts sleeping with a man, she acts like a porn star.<eos> Am I right? Jack and I, anything goes.<eos> Church of Lesbyterian, dinner beneath the bridge, guided tour of site B, if you know where that is.<eos> Remember when you said we should and I was like, "I'm not gonna do that."<eos> - You said, "Go on, try it."<eos> - Did I?
Well, he overcame cancer, and I've had cancer, so I can appreciate it.<eos> Cancer... it's a brutal experience.<eos> But you meet yourself along the way.<eos> I approached my disease the same way that I'd approach a race.<eos> There's an enemy to be defeated.<eos> I recall one time in the hospital, the third cycle of chemo, very weak, making my way down an endless hallway and a nurse comes up to me with a wheelchair.<eos> She said, "Mr Armstrong, would you care to sit down?"<eos> And I said, "Thanks, but no thanks."<eos> "I'm gonna walk."<eos> And I did.
Go!<eos> The pillar.<eos> Bring the pillar down!<eos> Put your backs into it, come on!<eos> Don't let them escape!<eos> Why don't I see a palace here?<eos> Or a throne?<eos> Or a crown? Or a...<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I do.
God, if I was an actor for six weeks on something, and I got...<eos> You don't recover from that.<eos> -L, um... didn't wanna believe that it wasn't working, so that's why I kept shooting and shooting.<eos> I was kind of in denial about it.<eos> And I had to ultimately accept the truth.<eos> It was very painful for everybody.<eos> - They started to shoot the movie without me, and I didn't know anything went on.<eos> And then Gary called me into his office one day and said that they had approached me originally, and then they'd shot, and they weren't happy with what they had, and would I consider doing it now?<eos> He thought I could do it.<eos> As long as I did the show in the daytime, and the movie at night.
It's going to be fine.<eos> Hold it.<eos> This is called gymnastics, Aziz.<eos> We will workout our arms, okay?<eos> Come here, don't go.<eos> Come.<eos> Stretch your arm slowly.<eos> Easy.<eos> Okay.<eos> You do this arm by yourself.
Yes, okay.<eos> I am pitching Dr. Aaron Conners.<eos> Uh, he works with some of the Knicks.<eos> He's this incredible, young sports physician on the rise, and he just created this revolutionary knee insert that cuts recovery time in half.<eos> He's about to perform it on Amar'e Stoudemire.<eos> It'll be the first time it's ever been done on a pro athlete.<eos> If we get this, we'll have access to the biggest names in sports.<eos> LeBron, Durant, Blake Griffin.<eos> I've heard of this guy.<eos> He did D'Brickashaw Ferguson's knee, right?
- When I'm with Matthew.<eos> - Yeah, okay.<eos> - That's it.<eos> That's it!<eos> Okay, well that just explained everything.<eos> That's-you haven't had an orgasm in a year?<eos> Come on, that's bullshit.<eos> Not even when you masturbate?<eos> Lainey, you've got to be kidding me!<eos> You don't mast-- Why not?
Will you be going up to your study?<eos> No, not as yet.<eos> Ah, yes. Home again.<eos> Home again.<eos> Mrs. Munro!<eos> It would appear we've had a decrease in population.<eos> Did Mr. Healy not come by to take care of the apiary whilst I was gone?<eos> Yes, but he won't be able to do it next time.<eos> - Did Mr. Healy say that?<eos> - No, his daughter did.
Talking to you is pointless.<eos> What's up, boss? - Victor?<eos> How's it going?<eos> Rojas called from head office.<eos> So early?<eos> I hope you hung up on him.<eos> Apparently the Lexin derivatives are toxic.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> They expect us to retrieve them without spilling the beans.<eos> What sort of a feasibility study did they do?
- that Alice...<eos> - "Lately".<eos> lately, that Alice had begun to think that very few things indeed were really impossible.<eos> There's seemed to be no use in waiting by the little door...<eos> Ma...<eos> Hey Jack, do you remember mouse?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> I do.
Jack is, is nobody's but mine.<eos> - When he was born, did it, did it ever occur to you... to ask your captor to take Jack away?<eos> Away?<eos> Well, to take him to a hospital, say...<eos> Leave him there where he could be found.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> - So Jack could be free.<eos> Now, this is the ultimate sacrifice and I understand that... but did you think about him having a normal childhood?<eos> - But he had me.<eos> - Of course he did.
He can use the vacation.<eos> This business has him a little upset.<eos> He's in the air now.<eos> He should be landing in a few hours.<eos> Yes, sir, I very much look forward to working with him.<eos> I hope you have a good fucking night too.<eos> Back in five.<eos> It's all under control, sir.<eos> Do I detect some frustration or doubt, Mr. Washington?<eos> How did you...
Before, I thought that it was mom trying to contact me.<eos> But it's not.<eos> It's something else.<eos> Are you sure it wasn't just a bad dream?<eos> No.<eos> I saw him.<eos> He had on a mask.<eos> He had on a breathing mask.<eos> I believe you.<eos> I do...
Oh, shit.<eos> What?<eos> Just please shut up.<eos> Please.<eos> I'll do whatever you want. Just please don't say shit like that anymore.<eos> I can't guarantee that.<eos> In Washington, 10 of the original 19 subpoenaed began their testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee.<eos> Mr. Trumbo, raise your right hand.<eos> Do you solemnly swear the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, nothing but the truth so help you God?<eos> I do.
Oh. Well.<eos> So, you had five jobs.<eos> Mmm-hmm.<eos> And now we got them and now you got none?<eos> Oh, now I'm free to get five more jobs and five more writers.<eos> And you each get five more jobs and five more writers and so on.<eos> To keep that going, we'd have to write every script in the business.<eos> Oh, Arlen, what a devious lad.<eos> So who wants to write a gorilla movie?<eos> Who doesn't?
That Oscar belongs to you.<eos> Get it!<eos> My God!<eos> You're nothing like me.<eos> You're worse.<eos> For the record, you're Robert Rich?<eos> I am.<eos> I've been through the whole list, Ed. They're all hacks.<eos> And you wrote The Brave One?<eos> I did.
It's just I was spooked by those calls and I... .. I needed you.<eos> ~ We need to stick to what we agreed.<eos> ~ Promise me I'm safe, Alec.<eos> ~ I've told you.<eos> Everything's OK.<eos> ~ So, you're staying?<eos> ~ No, I've got things I need to do.<eos> ~ I don't like being here by myself. ~ Stop worrying.<eos> ~ You don't know what he's capable of.<eos> I do.
You don't look that old, by the way.<eos> I mean, I wasn't worried because you look old.<eos> Yeah, well, you know you always got to assume the worst.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Hey.<eos> Uh, excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry, but can I ask you a favor?<eos> Hey, you see anything?<eos> I do not.
Can I get you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd like an appletini.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - Please.<eos> Actually, no, I'd like a Modelo.<eos> Do you want a glass with that?<eos> No.<eos> Hey, is there karaoke tonight?<eos> No, we actually only do that on Thursday nights.
I got you.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hey, the machine's working.<eos> -$1.25.<eos> -All right, have a seat.<eos> --Open the fuckin' door!<eos> Sir, I don't even know what you're talking--<eos> So you don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> No, sir, no.<eos> I do not.
- ( beep )<eos> I cannot be the guy who leaves three voicemails.<eos> Let me guess, Naomi's either late or she forgot.<eos> Can I offer you a drink?<eos> Um, no, I'm all right.<eos> Good, I hear brandy can get you into trouble.<eos> Who's Brandy?<eos> My mother's Brandy.<eos> I didn't think you had a mom named Brandy?<eos> I don't.
Maybe you're mistaken.<eos> I shouldn't have done that.<eos> Nope, nope.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sorry, no, no, no, no, no, I should not have done that.<eos> Um...<eos> I mean, I really shouldn't have done that.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> I wanted to.<eos> I did, too.
No, it's really good.<eos> - Lies!<eos> - It's not lies.<eos> You hate it!<eos> You're washing it down.<eos> I'm not washing it.<eos> You know, Princesses don't know how to cook anyway.<eos> ♪ My love, love is beginning... ♪<eos> Do you remember how my first night on the job Was your Graduation day?<eos> ( sighs ) I do.
Uh, yes. Coach Beiste asked me to summon you.<eos> Have a seat. Shannon, proceed.<eos> Um, you may have noticed that I've been acting sort of weird lately.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Um, taking a lot of personal days and stuff.<eos> Well, the truth is, is...<eos> I've been seeing some doctors.<eos> Okay, this is taking too long. What Coach Beiste is trying to say is that she has cancer.<eos> - You have cancer?<eos> ! - No, I don't. - What?
Vocal Adrenaline was amazing.<eos> We have two days. We have to recruit more members and put together some sort of performance that doesn't totally humiliate us as a team.<eos> Uh, I have an idea that you are not gonna like, but you need to consider.<eos> We need to recruit Kitty.<eos> - No, Kurt! No! - Rachel, come on.<eos> She's talented.<eos> She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.
We have two days. We have to recruit more members and put together some sort of performance that doesn't totally humiliate us as a team.<eos> Uh, I have an idea that you are not gonna like, but you need to consider.<eos> We need to recruit Kitty.<eos> - No, Kurt! No! - Rachel, come on.<eos> She's talented.<eos> She's a senior.<eos> - Kurt, she hates me.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> No, I do.<eos> All of those kids do, okay?
So if you guys want to quit, now is the time.<eos> You'll probably have an easier experience at this school if you do.<eos> But if you don't want to, then we'll just stay here and-and we'll work super hard and put our noses to the grindstone and we might even have to pull an all-nighter.<eos> An all-nighter?<eos> That's amazing!<eos> Yeah, and we can order pizza and root beer and have, like, a party.<eos> I'm s...<eos> Are-are you joining us?<eos> You want to win, don't you?<eos> Yes, we do!
"You know, I've always found women who weep frivolous and repulsive. "<eos> - Nice!<eos> - That's a totally asinine idea.<eos> What else?<eos> You won't fool me!<eos> I know that you can't levitate.<eos> That's everything?<eos> Don't you need anything?<eos> - What do you need band-aids for?<eos> - I don't.
He must've made twenty decisions in two hours...<eos> He moved out, He found an apartment<eos> He spoke on the phone to a divorce lawyer.<eos> It does not really seem like a confused man to me.<eos> You keep on saying to me that this woman is ugly and insignificant.<eos> So what is it that Julian sees in her that...<eos> He didn't see in me?<eos> Now. How should I know?<eos> Because you said that Mick asked him!<eos> - Did I? - Yes.
I'm sorry...<eos> I just do not understand.<eos> What exactly is the problem?<eos> The problem is that I composed the "Simple Songs" for my wife.<eos> And only she has ever performed them.<eos> And only she has recorded them.<eos> And as long as I live, she will be the only one to sing them.<eos> The problem is, dear sir... my wife can't sing any more.<eos> Now do you understand?<eos> Do you?
- Yeah?<eos> - You are not a robot.<eos> - Yeah, but how do you know?<eos> I have the weirdest thoughts in my head right now.<eos> I know. I know, babe.<eos> Do you know what a M1 Abrams is?<eos> It's a type of tank.<eos> I could list like 50 types of tanks right now.<eos> When did I learn about tanks?<eos> I didn't.
Only me?<eos> I told you that day in the car.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I need to speak with Angela.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - I've solved the case.<eos> We've got them all.<eos> I'll get her.<eos> Hello, Angela.<eos> Did you really?
...has just not been as inspiring as I'd hoped it'd be.<eos> But never in the history of the Bernville Camp for Boys... have we not completed a project.<eos> Now, I am more than open to hearing suggestions... as to how we might gain some inspiration in moving this forward.<eos> And you may discuss this amongst yourselves.<eos> But make no mistake... this project will be completed by you one way or another.<eos> So get on it, gentlemen.<eos> You have two weeks.<eos> Sir. Sir. Sir.<eos> We know right now. We know exactly what we wanna build.<eos> - We do?

Quincy thought we were married, huh?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Not exactly the best way to send you off.<eos> Well, so, you're sending me off, huh?<eos> I've been thinking about what you said, about us both deserving to have our lives just be a little easier, a little less burdened, and it really hit home with me tonight.<eos> And not because I have feelings for the chef or anything, but I couldn't help but think, what if I did?<eos> It wouldn't be hard to tell the girls.<eos> There wouldn't be some complicated history that exists between us that we're never going to be able to move past.<eos> No, I get it, I get it.<eos> I do.
I don't have any balance.<eos> I can barely walk on my own.<eos> And I do appreciate you being here, but everything's changed.<eos> I guess I just thought that...<eos> Since we were friends before, even if things are a little different now, we're still...<eos> That was then.<eos> And this new version of me doesn't feel like being friends.<eos> With anyone.<eos> Hey, kiddo.<eos> How you doing?
Of course.<eos> Still angsting out about that blood test, huh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I've been there.<eos> And, you know, a quick fix isn't always such a bad thing.<eos> A pot cookie?<eos> Works every time.<eos> But what about all of the talk about how God helped you?<eos> He did, he does.
You, seriously?<eos> Wow, you really did have some fun in New York after the Mets game.<eos> That was just a lucky guess.<eos> Nice haircut, by the way.<eos> What is that?<eos> Your lame attempt to go undercover and stalk me more?<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> It's okay.<eos> No one does.
Um, romantically?<eos> No.<eos> I haven't really had any long-term relationships to speak of.<eos> Um, it's kind of hard to plan a future with someone when you don't know if you're going to have a future.<eos> Yeah, that makes sense.<eos> That makes sense.<eos> You think that's all it was, though?<eos> Did you maybe have a fear of commitment?<eos> Ow.<eos> Maybe we both do.
- No no no, um...<eos> I just wanna do something first.<eos> Well, why can't we just go together?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Umm, I'm so sorry for not calling or anything.<eos> Brenna told me, but I just...<eos> After the other night, I didn't know what to say.<eos> I still don't.
What do you know about his brother?<eos> I wasn't aware he had one.<eos> Guillermo.<eos> His brother's name is Guillermo.<eos> Do you know anything about his cousin?<eos> I didn't know he had one of those either.<eos> None of that is in his file.<eos> His cousin is Fausto Alarcon.<eos> I don't know who that is.<eos> No one does.
Dad says we have to "find our place" or whatever. Which totally sucks when you want to make... You know, friends.<eos> I'll stay here tonight, but that's it.<eos> Tomorrow morning, I'm out of here.<eos> On my own.<eos> I guess the lion was right about the flood.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But we're safe here for the night.<eos> And our parents will definitely come and get us in the morning.<eos> I wonder if my mother even knows I'm missing.<eos> Of course she does.
I have to become strong and smart again.<eos> Schneider's also smart.<eos> Schneider?<eos> Is that his name?<eos> Yes, that's his name.<eos> According to Mertens.<eos> Who's Mertens?<eos> The man from the deep south who rides a billy goat at night.<eos> - Do you have speed?<eos> - Yes, I do.
I am trying to help you.<eos> I didn't ask for your help.<eos> No, you just needed it.<eos> Hillary, if you want to stay here, you have to...<eos> I don't have to do anything.<eos> You don't like me.<eos> That's just fine because I don't like you much either.<eos> But I do know what you're going through.<eos> You're overwhelmed. You're not sure what to do.<eos> You don't anything about me.
Baba recognize me?<eos> I'm Gopal.<eos> As a Kid, I used to throw stones at you, Babe.<eos> And call you "The mad mountain man"<eos> I was wrong.<eos> Bless you<eos> I want to say something to you.<eos> Yes tell me.<eos> Even I love someone as you did.<eos> So do it.
But I still haven't done it yet.<eos> Minnie still serve food?<eos> - Do you consider stew food? - Yes.<eos> - Then we serve food.<eos> She still stinking' up the place with her "old quail" pipe tobacco?<eos> Minnie dosen't smoke a pipe.<eos> She rolls her own.<eos> "Red apple tobacco"<eos> but mi negro amigo, I think you already know this.<eos> Yeah I do, senor Bob.
He just heard, tell why you here is all!<eos> It was cold the day I killed your boy.<eos> And I don't mean snwoy mountain in Wyoming cold. It was colder than that.<eos> And on that cold day, with your boy at the business end of my gun barrel...<eos> I made him strip.<eos> Right down to his bare ass.<eos> Then I told him to start walkin'.<eos> I walked his naked ass for two hours, 'fore his cold collapsed him.<eos> - You never even knew my boy?<eos> - No he didn't!
- You know why?<eos> - No.<eos> Ten thousand dollars.<eos> That's why.<eos> And when he get's here.<eos> I'm gonna' kill that fella' and turn my sister lose.<eos> Now do you have any reason why you'd want to interfere with me saving my sister from a hangman's rope?<eos> - No.<eos> - You don't.<eos> - No I don't.
I'm on the same floor.<eos> I'm 186.<eos> - Would you like to join us?<eos> - Why not?<eos> One of these days, it's gonna be me on one of those yachts.<eos> What are those yachts?<eos> It's the final ordeal before letting you go and the hardest one.<eos> 15 days of vacation, just a couple, alone.<eos> - Didn't you read the leaflet?<eos> - I did.
You should...<eos> Ok, if you think I should.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I mean, he said he signed the papers.<eos> Shouldn't he have to, like, stick to that?<eos> You'd think so, wouldn't ya?<eos> Well, he was clearly upset by the whole thing.<eos> I think... I hope, anyway, that with a little time and space from the drama of it all, he'll come to his senses.<eos> You really think that's gonna happen?<eos> I do, actually.
Why would I make something like that up?<eos> I don't know, it's just, I've never seen any other kids before.<eos> Don't even remember ever seeing Mom.<eos> Honey, I'm telling you the truth.<eos> And your mom, you knew her.<eos> You were just little.<eos> That's why you can't remember.<eos> Now that I'm grown up... you can tell me the truth.<eos> Do the monsters really exist?<eos> They did.
Now that you two are friends, you can go hunt animals with my dad, right?<eos> So we can have real food more often.<eos> I think that's a good idea.<eos> I can help your dad hunt... and he can help me go get ammunition... and other supplies in the store.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think you don't need my dad's help to go into town.<eos> You, when you were a kid, did you know how to add and subtract?<eos> Well, not much.<eos> I tell you what, not much now neither.<eos> Well, I do.
Tony.<eos> Your name's Tony.<eos> Right?<eos> - I knew it was a man's name.<eos> - Where'd we meet?<eos> Faces before names. You remember me?<eos> You remembered my face.<eos> Earlier, you rock up and flick water in my face.<eos> - You don't remember my face.<eos> - I do.
What's that mean?<eos> You don't meet someone new every five minutes.<eos> Or I don't.<eos> You, maybe.<eos> On a lighter note, the chef has prepared for you, miss, king prawns roasted in armagnac, Catalan style.<eos> Sound good?<eos> That pot, there.<eos> Gentlemen, you're done.<eos> Finished.<eos> - Nearly done.
A kid, let's split up. Let's have another. We'll split up again anyway.<eos> To split up, you have to be together.<eos> You guys aren't together.<eos> We're together separately.<eos> - Right.<eos> - I love him.<eos> Leaving his wife sobbing... You judge from the outside.<eos> What do you know?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You do.
Come on!<eos> We might not make it out of here, you know.<eos> Yeah.<eos> True.<eos> Which means that this could be our last few hours left of life.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, what do you wanna do?<eos> You know, with the last few hours of life we've got left?<eos> I... I don't...
- And I'll return home.<eos> - God answered my prayers.<eos> - The place where they were camping was hit by floods.<eos> - And I got another chance to run.<eos> I kept running.<eos> - lt took me months to get here.<eos> No one believes me.<eos> No one.<eos> You don't believe me either.<eos> I do now.
I will kill you.<eos> I will kill you, Vasudha.<eos> Kill me, Hari.<eos> Kill me.<eos> Because I'm speaking out after ages.<eos> I can't stop now.<eos> Silence me.<eos> Because I can no longer live caged by your dead customs.<eos> Have you seen the light of love?<eos> I did, Hari.
-What the hell, Ted?<eos> -Now, hold on a minute.<eos> No one ever promised you that job.<eos> Oh, yeah, I-I know, but Max Phillips?<eos> He's got an MBA.<eos> He's got a great track record.<eos> He comes highly recommended.<eos> He has some very interesting ideas for new hires.<eos> Honestly, we're lucky to have him.<eos> How did you... Of all...
Mike is dead in the fucking bathroom.<eos> I went in there, and someone ate his...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just had to go.<eos> I just needed to go.<eos> Jesus Christ, I'll never take a shit again.<eos> Evan, Evan, slow down.<eos> What's up now?<eos> Mike...<eos> He didn't...
All civilians are innocent.<eos> Act like the bullets have eyes.<eos> Then, how about taking a photo?<eos> For the historical record.<eos> Comrade Ahn, you can change clothes.<eos> Okay.<eos> We can't fight on an empty stomach<eos> Captain Yem said you would cover our compensation.<eos> What's with you?<eos> He did.
How's Remy working out?<eos> Well, we'd much rather have you there, but he's doing a fine job.<eos> Doug, do you... recall anything?<eos> - About what happened?<eos> - Why? Did the police find something?<eos> Not that we're aware of.<eos> And we've asked them to hold off questioning you until you're feeling more like yourself.<eos> Rachel, she...<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Yes, you do.
When do we announce the nomination?<eos> Listen, I wasn't gonna bring this up tonight, but you should know that there are some serious doubts from people at the State Department.<eos> You mean Cathy.<eos> And some on her staff.<eos> Like what?<eos> Well, in over your head, wearing two hats, the obvious things.<eos> And are you saying this because you don't want to move forward?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I'm sharing with you so you fully understand - what you're getting into.<eos> - And I do.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep. Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton, I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.
- Oh. Oh, yeah.<eos> - Yep. Take that.<eos> Okay, if you want to visit Newton, I know he'd be happy to see you.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> We never finished Carniv? le, so if you want to finish the last two episodes...<eos> - I don't. No.<eos> - You don't. Okay.<eos> - I don't.
Just sit there and eat what I give you, okay?<eos> I, uh, I sold...<eos> I sold computers. Big-screen TVs, stereos.<eos> Well, you asked what I did before.<eos> About 100 years ago.<eos> Yeah... that's about how long it takes.<eos> I went to watch, at first.<eos> Because that's who I was... a spectator.<eos> And this kid, maybe 20, he had this look on his face... like this was one more thing he was gonna fail at.<eos> And he did.
Hey, do you guys need a lift?<eos> It's Ronny!<eos> What the hell?<eos> Get in the truck!<eos> Come on, go!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> My white baby boy!<eos> You saved our lives!<eos> How did you know we were here?<eos> I didn't.
I gotta tell you.<eos> That was a brilliant choice, my friend.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I think that we should have sex.<eos> Of all the things that brought you around, "Bio-Dome" is what get... is what gets you in the mood?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Um...<eos> No, I just...<eos> I think it's important.<eos> I do too.
Would you like some?<eos> He does not love you.<eos> He might lust after you, yes, but that is all - lust.<eos> Sharing you cannot possibly hurt him, for you are a whore - and men always share a whore.<eos> This is rather silly, Katherine, because I know how much you like to get it over with and get back to him and sadly, I will not start until you have spoken.<eos> We could be here till morning.<eos> What would you like me to say?<eos> Something truthful.<eos> You think I hate you... ..and you are right.<eos> I do.
You saw how he went to his death.<eos> You saw it with your own eyes.<eos> You did not read it in a file, yes?<eos> Yes, Boss.<eos> Could any man be braver, any mother prouder?<eos> No, Boss.<eos> Then write that.<eos> Write the truth.<eos> ~ If you insist, Boss.<eos> ~ I do.
Just let go.<eos> Let go of the button.<eos> - I...<eos> - Let go!<eos> Never mind.<eos> We good?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I don't... I don't...<eos> I don't want to be doing this crap any more than you do.<eos> I don't.
Oh, come on.<eos> You guys, you've read her file.<eos> Her dad has a crap heart.<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> And look at her.<eos> Just let her have some fun.<eos> I mean, but it's the I.C.U.<eos> We're gonna say something, right?<eos> No. She'll get all emotional and want to leave.<eos> They always do.
Way to go, Adam. Good style.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Are we supposed to be watching this?<eos> Excuse me, but that's just tacky.<eos> Quinn: Well, I am glad you liked it.<eos> I look forward to reading the new issue, hopefully this time with fewer surprises.<eos> [Chuckles] Oh. [Groans]<eos> I'm sure I don't want to know what that was about.<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
Where'd you disappear to?<eos> I don't... I-I-I don't want some Rachel story.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> Um, well, I was in jail.<eos> The whole time?<eos> Come on, Rach.<eos> I was, um... in my sweatpants, under the covers, watching bad TV and eating ice cream.<eos> Which... wait a second...<eos> I had it delivered.<eos> Okay, I didn't...
You know it.<eos> Margaritas, senoritas?<eos> Hey, I'm off the clock. I've got my cell but I'm just gonna go crash, okay?<eos> What, don't you mean hide, hard core?<eos> Aww. Don't worry about it.<eos> When the dragon's away, the mice will play.<eos> My girls are moving on up.<eos> Really?<eos> Adam said that?<eos> He did.
Yeah, she's cooled off.<eos> She misses you.<eos> Just come back home, do the apology tour.<eos> You two belong together.<eos> Your father won't stay angry.<eos> It'll take a little groveling... my father, who ripped me in the press, stopped my mother and brothers from talking to me?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> All he wants is a respectable son, and this circus makes the whole family look bad.<eos> Oh, God. Did he send you?<eos> - So what if he did?
- No, I wanna... each other, and I'll take care of Lily?<eos> They're just having adult time.<eos> Lily, I'll be right there.<eos> I'll see you in just a minute.<eos> Mary, what the hell is my kid doing on this show?<eos> It is a family date.<eos> How did she even get here without my permission?<eos> Louise brought her to meet Adam.<eos> You want my daughter to meet this guy?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Not to mention the fact that if we leave right now, we're gonna hurt a lot of people, Rachel.<eos> Holy shit, Adam,<eos> I just burned my entire life down because you begged me to.<eos> I know, I know, but, Rachel, you are so compelling.<eos> Look, I made a commitment, and I have to grow up.<eos> I'm honoring my promise.<eos> What about the promise that you made me?<eos> Or did you just sober up?<eos> Rachel, you mean everything to me.<eos> You do.
Come on, what are you doing?<eos> We're engaged.<eos> I caught you getting your knob polished by a teenager.<eos> Whatever. She's a mouth.<eos> Yes, maybe I could have been a little more prudent.<eos> Oh, good God, Chet.<eos> You want me begging every time I get a boner?<eos> I'd be mauling you five times a day.<eos> You know who I am.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Maybe.<eos> "Maybe," yeah.<eos> Go, then. You know what?<eos> Just go.<eos> Do it.<eos> Join the Peace Corps if you want, and see how that feels as your life.<eos> You know something?<eos> I just don't want to be a woman whose whole life is this.<eos> You may want to be Chet, but I don't want to be you, Quinn.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Yeah, you know, just, in England, we could find something...<eos> You and me in England?<eos> So now they want you to go to England with me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Of course they do.<eos> Adam... These people are vulgar.<eos> They will do anything they can to make a quick buck off us.<eos> And you'd willingly be a part of that?<eos> I... I'm sorry.<eos> I... I didn't...
Now, how do you stand this pigsty?<eos> Hm♪Hm?<eos> Piss off!<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> ♪I am dyyy-ing ♪Dyyy-ing, dyyy-ing! - Go away!<eos> Ow!<eos> And here's me, looking forward to this all morning.<eos> To what?<eos> You don't know what I'm talking about, do you?<eos> Of course I do.
What about taking Arabian Nights to Melbourne?<eos> Mm.<eos> Ow!<eos> No wonder you can't keep the weight off.<eos> - Sorry?<eos> - You heard.<eos> You have no idea what it's like to be me.<eos> Come on Matt, I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Yes, you did.
So... You get a date out of this little adventure?<eos> Well, as you said, a cop and a neurosurgeon, not exactly a match.<eos> Sure about that?<eos> - Give me a minute.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thanks for helping us.<eos> Erika created a perfect virus, but she never meant to hurt anyone.<eos> She just became obsessed.<eos> I don't think I understand that kind of obsession.<eos> I do.
Surprise!<eos> You're him.<eos> Him who?<eos> The killer.<eos> Hello, Eye Candy.<eos> Why? !<eos> Why what?<eos> You killed Ben.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I mean, a lot of it had to with...<eos> Dad, are you okay?<eos> It's okay.<eos> It'll be okay.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> I really fucked up.<eos> Mom hates me.<eos> I don't think she hates you.<eos> I just think maybe...<eos> She does.
What did you just fucking say?<eos> Say? No.<eos> I just said...<eos> Hey! When you comin' back?<eos> You forgot your...<eos> And...<eos> No, I'm sorry, Ross.<eos> Stop.<eos> Again, please, as if your future depended upon it.<eos> Or better yet, as if mine did.
Mm, very amazing.<eos> It's a smelly pig butt.<eos> Okay, that's enough.<eos> Let's talk about tomorrow, okay?<eos> What would you like to do?<eos> We could go to that nice bookstore on 16th Street.<eos> Where's Daddy?<eos> Molly, you know why Daddy's not here.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> No, I don't.
I told you.<eos> N.A.S.A. Got us a beach house as a reward for me going up into space.<eos> It's for V.I.P.'s<eos> It's very private.<eos> We've been driving for an hour.<eos> I think they just wanted to do something nice.<eos> To make up for us not going to Washington.<eos> We're not invited to the White House?<eos> Gus, why?<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Can get these guys into space.<eos> Can't get 'em into a couple convertibles.<eos> Ready?<eos> One...<eos> Two...<eos> Three!<eos> I just wanted to say thank you for handling my, um, my problem.<eos> I never heard from that guy or the magazine again.<eos> You're welcome. I did what I had to do.<eos> You didn't...
And according to this, you'll even have a little left over for a rainy day.<eos> Every day's a rainy day without Gus.<eos> Go to the jewelry store.<eos> That $75 something or other, my guess is it's for you.<eos> A diamond pin?<eos> For your 20th, it's meant to be China.<eos> Men should never pick out jewelry alone.<eos> Gus already has something kind of like this.<eos> Wally does, too.<eos> All the guys do.
Gus was pissed because of the communications snafu.<eos> And I was right there in the blockhouse.<eos> I could have told them to call it.<eos> But I knew he didn't want another delay.<eos> I mean, the moon is right there.<eos> We can all taste it.<eos> But we... we were family.<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I... I should probably go.<eos> No, don't.
Is he smoking again?<eos> Looks like it.<eos> You should get him to shave before the big day too.<eos> - Hello, Geoffrey.<eos> - Hello, Lena.<eos> Hope you've got your speech prepared.<eos> I want to hear nice things about Kate on Saturday.<eos> So, I hear you don't want to go to the Crawley's lunch.<eos> I don't mind if you don't, but I wondered why.<eos> I just don't.
Wait!<eos> Wait, don't touch it.<eos> Just let it organically swing.<eos> We're entering the home that Mom grew up in.<eos> Look!<eos> Look, there's the clock that she told us about.<eos> Do you play sports?<eos> I don't like sports.<eos> He used to.<eos> What do you do?
Want a cup of tea?<eos> I just put the kettle on.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> Go on.<eos> Sit down anywhere you like.<eos> Needs a bit of warming up.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Do you think that we look alike, me and Reggie?<eos> Oh, yes, certainly.<eos> No, you don't.
There's a fucking surprise.<eos> Jack! Mate, do you know anything about fraud?<eos> Anything at all?<eos> Take a punt.<eos> Do you know anything about how we pay off policemen every fucking final Thursday of the month?<eos> - Do you know that?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> Fucking surprise, that.<eos> So why don't we kill Jack now?<eos> Or we do Albie as well?
He would tell Katya he wants to... hey, Katya...<eos> What is it that you do now exactly, Katya?<eos> Conflict evaluation and analysis.<eos> Forget that. He don't wanna tell anyone he wants to do that.<eos> I don't even know what that is.<eos> Is he hitting on you?<eos> Watch out.<eos> He always hits on the new ones.<eos> I know that.<eos> We all do.
I don't know.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> How convenient.<eos> Ask her.<eos> Maybe she's got a photo of him in her wallet.<eos> Have you got one of Sarah's?<eos> - What do you care?<eos> - You didn't before.<eos> How do you know?<eos> - You didn't.
Yeah.<eos> That works.<eos> Wow! You're beautiful.<eos> - Mmm. Ryan.<eos> - What?<eos> I love this song.<eos> No.<eos> Uh-huh. No. I don't dance.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - Gwen, I don't.
Yeah.<eos> Ryan, that man's grief was heartbreaking, but you can't blame yourself for his daughter's death.<eos> You were doing your job.<eos> I know.<eos> How many more people would Joe Carroll have killed if you hadn't stopped him?<eos> But so many lost their lives, you know, and it's easy to see them as just an extension of Joe, but I don't even recognize that name--Sherry.<eos> The more I really think about it, there's only a handful of names that I do remember.<eos> Joe Carroll turned those people into killers.<eos> But their lives, their families should still matter.<eos> And they do.
Evan, I have something to confess.<eos> Yes?<eos> I'm glad we knocked on your door.<eos> I'm having a way better time here then at that stupid party we were supposed to go to.<eos> Well, I have to confess, it's not usually this exciting around here at 1:30 in the morning.<eos> It's like destiny that we were meant to meet.<eos> Do you believe in destiny, Evan?<eos> I'm an architect.<eos> So obviously I believe that things happen by your own design.<eos> Well, I do.
So this is the holy city of the Jews?<eos> Why don't they hail their new governor?<eos> I don't come seeking their love, Claudia, only respect.<eos> How do I dress when we are taken to see the Jewish God?<eos> No one sees him.<eos> They believe hes everywhere.<eos> Everywhere?<eos> But cannot be seen?<eos> How do they know he exists?<eos> Maybe he doesn't.
What does Sassen want?<eos> Security, control.<eos> Stricter laws to monitor us.<eos> But those laws won't be implemented without the population's support.<eos> May I present to you...<eos> This is our latest acquisition.<eos> I'd say, go ahead.<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> - No.<eos> From now on you do.
As you know, Marit hasn't been herself lately.<eos> She was depressed.<eos> She left the institute last night.<eos> You never saw her again.<eos> Get ready for the mission.<eos> What happens next?<eos> Nothing.<eos> It stops here. - And now?<eos> How do you know this will work?<eos> I don't.
I'll be lookout.<eos> You can do whatever you want, Q.<eos> Damn it.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> Dad, I'm sorry, okay?<eos> "I'm sorry"?<eos> That's completely unacceptable.<eos> I really like him, Dad!<eos> He does not love you!<eos> Yes, he does!
Were you listening, Ben?<eos> It's New York.<eos> I can't go to New York.<eos> Why? You have a car.<eos> What is stopping you?<eos> Like, 1,200 miles.<eos> Well, there you go.<eos> That's 1,200 miles between you and your love of your life.<eos> Because you love her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
It's way safer.<eos> Just two days.<eos> I love you, Mom.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I hope you had a great summer.<eos> I still can't believe she hasn't called.<eos> They probably don't have phones in Agloe.<eos> She has a cell.<eos> How do we know that she's even still in Agloe?<eos> I just do.
I'm in love with you.<eos> You're in love with me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Quentin... come OH.<eos> I've loved you since we were kids.<eos> And I've never stopped loving you every single day since.<eos> You're not in love with me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> You don't even know me.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'll see you.<eos> What a treacherous thing it is to believe that a person is more than a person.<eos> Margo was not a miracle. She was not an adventurer.<eos> She was not some fine, precious thing.<eos> She was a girl.<eos> It took me a long time to realize how wrong I was.<eos> And not just about Margo.<eos> I was wrong about a lot of things.<eos> I used to believe everyone gets a miracle.<eos> And I still do.
Raiders routinely hit our shipping.<eos> All up and down the coast as far north as Mt.<eos> Pleasant, as far south as the Cumberland Sound.<eos> It took him a short while to learn how to deal with it.<eos> But once he committed to fighting the problem, things changed.<eos> You see, he made these people unafraid.<eos> Everyone realized, like just about anything else in this life... the moment you stop fearing it, it loses all its power.<eos> The governor is a friend!<eos> The governor gave very specific instructions.<eos> - No, don't!
Where have you been?<eos> I've been coming here. Are you just gonna stand up here while your sister gets her ass beat?<eos> Come on.<eos> I've been traveling here.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> I've been headed here, like a freight train.<eos> I couldn't have known then where all this was gonna end up.<eos> I didn't know why he decided to come back.<eos> I didn't know then what he's running from .<eos> None of us did.
Come on.<eos> - Because this doesn't make sense.<eos> - Which part?<eos> You're always on rne about how I don't talk to Mom enough, how I don't respect the family.<eos> Now I tell you I wanna come home, and I wanna help out, and that doesn't make sense to you.<eos> You know what, I'm sorry.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You want me to talk to Dad, I'll talk to Dad. Of course I will.<eos> Yeah, I do. I do.
Bye Felicia!<eos> I love you, Dani.<eos> Call me when you get home, okay?<eos> Hey, and remember; never buy milk at liquor stores. So how went things with you and Lennox?<eos> Oh, you'll never gonna believe this, but the advice you gave me totally worked.<eos> Why wouldn't I believe that?<eos> It was my advice.<eos> Not only are Lennox and I on good terms, but she canceled that stupid trip to Colombia.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Well...<eos> First...<eos> You're gonna rinse...<eos> Your dishes off every time before you put them in the dishwasher.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> Come here.<eos> - You want to go upstairs?<eos> - I do.<eos> I think we deserve some fun time after all that hardcore parenting.<eos> Ooh, yes we do.
Well, you know, I wouldn't want to pick a favorite part because that just wouldn't be fair to all of the other awesome parts.<eos> They would just feel bad about themselves.<eos> Well, that's okay. You can just compliment all of the parts.<eos> I can take it.<eos> Well, okay, first... I like...<eos> What was that for?<eos> Well, you know, I just wanted to thank you for the ring and...<eos> You know, sometimes, there are no words.<eos> Guess who delivers?<eos> I do.
A surprise party?<eos> An ice luge? Joe...<eos> - You really do know me.<eos> - Yeah, well, most of the time.<eos> All right, just hurry up and get ready so we can "go see the movie."<eos> - We can fight later.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Why would I want to fight with my thoughtful, wonderful husband?<eos> - You really mean that?<eos> - I do, of course I do!
I would not have put them in that danger.<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> I went through a rough patch.<eos> I am sorry.<eos> I am clean now.<eos> - I'm starting a new...<eos> - There's nothing new about any of this.<eos> There's nothing new you can say.<eos> You don't have any compassion?<eos> I do.
- I love you too.<eos> I'm gonna slide over a bit.<eos> Why?<eos> I just thought you were gonna lay down just for a minute.<eos> Oh, well, I thought we weren't doing that anymore.<eos> Just for tonight, because I'm so sad.<eos> Move over, you silly woman.<eos> Hey, dude.<eos> Hey, did you know your uncle knows all about construction?<eos> No, I didn't.
Nearly.<eos> Nurse Gilbert, could you pop in for a moment?<eos> Yes?<eos> (I can't do an internal examination without asking.)<eos> Oh.<eos> Quite.<eos> I think we'll have to leave it.<eos> Do you have any female friends who speak English, Mrs Khatun?<eos> It might help for the examination next time.<eos> She doesn't.
~ You've given it quite the build-up,<eos> I'm rather afraid it's going to disappoint.<eos> ~ They're knocking down the nurses' home.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> ~ Well, half of it.<eos> Those of us who volunteered to move out and find private digs will be given a rent allowance.<eos> And I've put my name down.<eos> Oh, Delia, you don't want to end up in some filthy hole,<eos> ~ living cheek by jowl with a lot of students.<eos> ~ No, I don't.
Are there any saying you can't?<eos> I don't have to live at Nonnatus, it was offered to me as a sort of perk.<eos> Lots of girls share flats.<eos> Not even a nun would bat an eyelid.<eos> BELL TINKLES Good morning, madam.<eos> I'm your fiance's daughter.<eos> Marlene Dooley, nee Buckle.<eos> You remember me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I do.
The Nonnatuns will make sure of that.<eos> And we'll look in on them all we can.<eos> Thank you for what you done.<eos> I should be getting back...<eos> I meant to put a bicycle chain on one of the bikes.<eos> It needs to be done before tonight.<eos> Fred?<eos> We're too old to be silly about this, aren't we?<eos> Now either you like me... .. or you don't.<eos> I do.
You actually can't see it right now because it's so small.<eos> Anyways, dude, it's all good.<eos> This is your chance to go back and show all those pricks from high school what an awesome dude you've become, man.<eos> Jocks, they peak in high school, all right?<eos> But nerds, they become Skrillex.<eos> Hey, guys, I was kidding, I've got a huge one.<eos> Like, I wasn't in either of those groups in high school.<eos> - I...<eos> - me either.<eos> - I, like, did my own thing.
- Let's get you out of here.<eos> - I just don't remember.<eos> I thought he was kissing me.<eos> Later, Tor-penis.<eos> Oh, man, these pain pills are kicking in right about now.<eos> You got to eat something before, bud.<eos> Sherry Cruz.<eos> Yeah, the one that got away.<eos> She doesn't know what she's missing, man.<eos> She really doesn't, man.
Liza's going to step up and really take charge of making sure this party is fun, young, and hot.<eos> In fact, I'm going to make her run point for the party tomorrow.<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, wow. Oh, God, please tell me you're not one of those earnest millenials who's never had a cigarette and thinks her parents are heroes.<eos> Nope. Definitely not.<eos> Guess who's just been promoted to point person on the She-donism party?<eos> What?<eos> Diana is giving up control?<eos> Annabelle wants a younger vibe.<eos> Of course she does.
Don't be shy.<eos> I used to babysit a girl who was very shy.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Kaitlyn.<eos> And you know what Kaitlyn loved?<eos> What?<eos> Polly Pockets.<eos> So do I!<eos> It's too bad we don't have any here that we could play with.<eos> We do!
As a matter of fact, our very own Liza Miller found a book in the slush pile, and it's suddenly getting a lot of attention.<eos> Really?<eos> How's that?<eos> Well... this book is incredible.<eos> It's an epic, multigenerational tale of this Southern family.<eos> I had an inkling it might play well in the suburban book club crowd, so I sent it to one.<eos> After we agreed upon that strategy.<eos> E-exactly.<eos> I feel it's always good to keep a finger on the suburban pulse.<eos> Yes, she does.
I... I found a book in the slush pile that I'm kind of excited about.<eos> You're excited about the slush pile.<eos> Oh, well, perfect.<eos> Then, when you're done with those, you can read my junk mail.<eos> Do you want to split an appetizer?<eos> Yeah, uh, maybe the "geh-nocchi"?<eos> Actually, it's pronounced "gnocchi."<eos> What?<eos> Why hasn't anybody ever told me this?<eos> 'Cause you do it so cute.
Jhimli, I needed to borrow some money, I'll return it.<eos> How much?<eos> Whatever you can lend me.<eos> I'll return it with interest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You cannot pay my interest.<eos> Tell me something..<eos> How is Pat" as a person ?<eos> He's fine. Didn't I tell you?<eos> You did?
How long?<eos> 8 pm.<eos> 8 pm.<eos> 8 pm is my dinner time.<eos> Bye, sir.<eos> Did you tell anyone about Harman?<eos> I never told anyone.<eos> Be honest, and I won't harm you.<eos> I said I didn't tell anyone...<eos> Yes, I did.
Who do you play for, Charles Greane?<eos> I used to play for the Bucs.<eos> But I'm retired now.<eos> Haven't really figured out my next step yet.<eos> - I'm still contemplating.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Didn't Rod meet Kimmy here?<eos> And Tina.<eos> He had a thing for bottle service girls.<eos> Who the fuck doesn't?
- See you. - Next memo.<eos> Mike, were you at work today?<eos> I don't remember seeing you.<eos> Next memo. Ben, Moyes is asking questions.<eos> This isn't gonna lead to any kind of an investigation, is it?<eos> Memo deleted.<eos> I fucking hope not.<eos> Do you solemnly that the testimony you are about to give is the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God.<eos> So help me God.<eos> Yes, I do.

Should we check in before we go to the funeral home?<eos> No, I want to see him.<eos> I need to see him.<eos> Oh god. Would you please take these away from me?<eos> After I have one more, and then take them away.<eos> And then when the nausea passes, give them back to me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Before you go back there, you need to know, he may not look exactly the way you remember him.<eos> I don't want to see the body.<eos> I really don't, actually.
Don't blame yourself.<eos> You know what I think would make us feel a lot better?<eos> - What?<eos> - Three of those apple fritters.<eos> Fuck it, let's get a half dozen.<eos> - Paddy...<eos> - I'm on it. Yep.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - I did.
- No, it was not.<eos> - What?<eos> Why do I remember it being so good?<eos> Yeah, maybe because you came all the time.<eos> I didn't come.<eos> - That wasn't good for you?<eos> - Oh, Jesus.<eos> You know that I loved you so much.<eos> I loved you too.<eos> I still do. I do.
Did you and Doris finally get married?<eos> Uh, no, we...<eos> Actually, I'm gay.<eos> Oh, wow, cool.<eos> Good for you.<eos> I love that you're gay.<eos> That's great.<eos> - Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> - No, not anymore.<eos> I did.
If that's enough?<eos> Then that's great.<eos> - If it's not...<eos> - No, it's not.<eos> And it shouldn't be for you.<eos> Even if it's not with me, you shouldn't...<eos> Be... done, Lynn.<eos> You like it?<eos> Yeah, dude.<eos> I do.
Good.<eos> I need this, Dor.<eos> Fuck.<eos> I don't have anything else.<eos> What the fuck happened?<eos> What is going on?<eos> Don't say that you have me, all right?<eos> You have me.<eos> And you have... you... Up till about 10 seconds ago, I was gonna say you have Lynn, but...<eos> Well, I didn't.
- Pancakes suck, Mr. Eddie.<eos> - Wait, what, pancakes suck?<eos> Only in America can a homeless kid complain about free pancakes.<eos> Look, this is from a grant.<eos> So get yourself a spooky lumberjack stack.<eos> It's Halloween!<eos> Hey. You dressing up tonight?<eos> Does a bottom howl at the moon?<eos> I don't know what that means.<eos> Sure you don't.
I don't want us being weird to be the reason I never see you again.<eos> - Patrick... - I'd miss you too much if you go.<eos> Here you two are.<eos> I thought the party was inside.<eos> I just came to get the karaoke sign-up sheet.<eos> - Seen it?<eos> - Yeah, I've got that.<eos> I will, uh, I'll just unfold it.<eos> You know, 'cause I slay Celine Dion.<eos> I really do.

Stop telling people that I'd take a manager job.<eos> That's not what I am.<eos> That's not what I'm going to be.<eos> Dom, your reaction, it's...<eos> - I'm just trying to help.<eos> - I didn't ask for help.<eos> You were the one who said you didn't want to get involved in any business dealing.<eos> Didn't you tell me that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then don't.
If I weren't married, I suppose... but, Russ, as your business manager, I need to tell you something, and you're not going to like it.<eos> At all.<eos> So, what's the plan here, Richard?<eos> We're not gonna, like, fight them, right?<eos> Uh... No, no. I don't...<eos> I mean, we got to do something.<eos> Even if it's just yelling at them... telling them that they're not gonna get away with this.<eos> But you know they are, right?<eos> Well, not if I have anything to do about it.<eos> But you sort of don't.
Just think of the conferences we could have in this nook.<eos> Oh, yeah. I mean, this is really expensive.<eos> So, um, what did the doctor say?<eos> Uh, it's nothing. It's just stress-related night sweats.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> - That's good to hear.<eos> - Are you relieved?<eos> - I would have been if that idiot hadn't have mentioned something about how it can lead to, uh, bed-wetting.<eos> I'm just trying not to think about it.<eos> Good, don't.
We are racing to get our platform ready for CES.<eos> And we took time away from doing that to do this so we could get PR value.<eos> If no one sees the logo, then there's no PR value at all.<eos> Oh, man. I'm sorry.<eos> But you get it.<eos> No, I don't get it.<eos> Okay, look, you have to put our logo in the viewer.<eos> That's it, period.<eos> Mmm... Actually, I don't have to do a damn thing.<eos> - Yeah, you do.

Yeah, so, when we win it.<eos> Whoa! Have you guys seen this?<eos> Seth, the network security guy from EndFrame, just changed his Linkedln status to "unemployed."<eos> No way.<eos> You think we got him fired?<eos> I bet we did.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Well, we never actually breached his security.<eos> Remember we got Marc's login info and went through the front door?<eos> So, he didn't actually do anything wrong.
He's talking about this crack-addict prostitute we saw at the gas station. She was smoking cigarettes.<eos> So sad.<eos> Jian-Yang, what're you doing?<eos> This is Palo Alto.<eos> People are lunatics about smoking here.<eos> We don't enjoy all the freedoms that you have in China.<eos> All right? Where people smoke all the time.<eos> I don't smoke.<eos> Expt for special occasions.<eos> So you do smoke?
Hold.<eos> It just think it's physically impossible for it to dissolve in my mouth.<eos> Hold. Now chew, chew, chew!<eos> It's very hot.<eos> It's good, it's good.<eos> Good? It's the fucking best.<eos> This whole place is.<eos> You call this place and they don't know you, they pretend they don't speak English.<eos> You see a white face in here?<eos> No, you don't.
For the first time in your life.<eos> There's a first time for everything.<eos> Here. These will help.<eos> Thank you.<eos> May Freya lie with you tonight, and take care of you, my friend.<eos> I am so happy that my uncle is dead.<eos> But I still don't believe it.<eos> You saw him killed.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes I did.
There is no more pain, Ivar. No.<eos> No more pain.<eos> That's right.<eos> Very sleepy, Ivar.<eos> You're getting very sleepy.<eos> There's no more pain.<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am.<eos> - No, I don't.
And better than 70 of them are sitting right now just outside your harbor in full support of it.<eos> It is exactly as Thomas proposed<eos> - all those years ago in London.<eos> - Yes.<eos> But then we were talking about less than half the number of criminals on the island.<eos> We were talking about a failing colony, not a failed one.<eos> We also didn't have the most respected captain on the island standing in advocacy of our plan.<eos> Now we do.<eos> We didn't have the trade boss of the island actively working to reform operations then.<eos> Now we do.
Yeah. To buy, like, basic necessities, like a blanket or shoes or a piece of fruit.<eos> Well, fruit is later.<eos> It's... (Sighs) Fruit is later.<eos> (Chuckles) But say a pillow or toilet paper.<eos> - They don't have toilet paper?<eos> - They have toilet paper.<eos> All right, all right, they have toilet paper.<eos> Let's not get bogged down.<eos> The idea is, they're buying these basic human necessities, with the exception of toilet paper... (chuckles) which they already have.<eos> Well, they do.
Is that a scratch across the lens?<eos> They were the last pair.<eos> - But free!<eos> - Right.<eos> But can you see?<eos> Not really, but you're totally missing the point.<eos> Of glasses?<eos> So how was your lunch with Tim?<eos> Oh, and by the way, you heard the "oh, no" thing.<eos> - I did.
- Mm-hmm. - Really? - Uh-huh.<eos> - Hmm? You got to go.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> I want you out of here before the boys get up.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't want to confuse 'em.<eos> Or... we could make it less confusing.<eos> I have no idea what that means.<eos> What if we did this in, like, a more permanent way.
Well, in that case, I am really not a fan.<eos> - I still can't believe it.<eos> - It's so shocking.<eos> I keep picturing the four of you in that shower.<eos> - You're counting the crab?<eos> - I was.<eos> How could she do this to me?<eos> I know.<eos> Look, I know how you're feeling right now.<eos> No, you don't.
(Cell phone ringing) Yeah.<eos> (Stammering) Hi, sweetie.<eos> No, I'm at the dentist.<eos> I lost a crown.<eos> It's all good.<eos> Be back soon.<eos> (Whimpers) I got to go.<eos> You know, I'm a writer too.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I did not.
Matt, I would like to spend all of my advantages to release the bugs on Claire.<eos> Wow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, Pete, love the tux.<eos> Hi, Claire.<eos> Hi.<eos> This is what happens when you take a guy's pants.<eos> So Eric went for the bugs.<eos> You like bugs?<eos> I really don't.
- No niece?<eos> - No niece.<eos> You don't wanna see my response if something happens to her, buddy.<eos> I'm not so sure that it was an accident.<eos> Matthew called me a couple weeks ago.<eos> Matt was getting harassed, and he thought he was being followed.<eos> You fucking whore.<eos> How about you, Noah?<eos> You got a girlfriend?<eos> Matter of fact I do, yeah.
The only reason we're not is because the Sheriff's busy.<eos> If he wasn't busy, he'd probably drag us right out onto Main Street, slit our throats, wouldn't he?<eos> Ethan is not Pope.<eos> He's not gonna do that.<eos> Yeah, you're probably right.<eos> Franklin! You add to that the fact that we just about killed his little kid, you think this guy's gonna let us live?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I-I do. What makes you so sure?<eos> Because I know him.<eos> No, you don't.
Only one way to be sure.<eos> If it is, the inside of this wolf will be stuffed with feathers.<eos> Scalpel.<eos> Well, you know what?<eos> Maybe the obsidian blade.<eos> Then it would be...<eos> Both.<eos> Ah, well, that would work.<eos> Do you even know what you're doing?<eos> Of course I do.
- HEY-<eos> - We're just holed up in - inside.<eos> " We?<eos> - When Medina was killing those demons I got a bit of a half-chub.<eos> - Look, let's get back to the matter at hand here.<eos> Seeing as how you're in an underground dwarven citadel, it looks as if it has nested hinges, which are...<eos> - Oh...<eos> Brodie!<eos> - Told you they'd be okay.<eos> - No you didn't.
- Do it.<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Wanna hurt me? Get it over with.<eos> - Stop!<eos> Go on.<eos> - I don't wanna hurt you.<eos> - It's easy. - Just do it.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - Come on! - Please, stop.<eos> - Do it.
What noise?<eos> You guys hearing some kind of high pitched beat?<eos> Like, eh-ehhhh-eh-eh.<eos> One short, one long, two short.<eos> It's Morse code.<eos> It's all for librarians.<eos> Hey, something's wrong.<eos> Come on.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Well, I did.
I really startled him. I felt so bad.<eos> What was he doing in the lab after hours?<eos> I don't know. I think he's researching on a book, or something that he's writing about, like, poison or chemistry, or one of those things, so...<eos> But in the lab, all that poison and toxic stuff is locked away.<eos> Yeah, but he had a key.<eos> Hey, why are you actin' so strangely?<eos> What's so important we gotta go over it...<eos> You killed Spangler.<eos> - What?<eos> - Didn't you?
It's all right.<eos> Go.<eos> Go now.<eos> Everybody said it was back.<eos> This... .. sweating sickness.<eos> I should have sent them to the country.<eos> Liz wouldn't have let them go.<eos> Anne cried every time you were away.<eos> Did she?<eos> Anne did?
If you hadn't found something, I think you would have lied.<eos> We'll never know, will we?<eos> I don't really feel like going to a birthday party.<eos> Half birthday.<eos> Whatever.<eos> Seems like a good time to be with other people.<eos> - Says the guy who ran away to Thailand.<eos> - Zoe, my family is your family.<eos> - You need family right now.<eos> We all do. - Griffin, I...
No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I guess I'm gonna have to do it from out here!<eos> I traveled 4,000 miles, and I finally realized what I was looking for was always right in front of me.<eos> I mean, not at the moment, but you know what I mean?<eos> All you need is love.<eos> I get that now.<eos> You write that all by yourself?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Yeah. Oh, I do! I do!

- Children are never alone with the adults.<eos> The children are never alone.<eos> Come.<eos> I want to show you something.<eos> What, uh... what did you want to show me?<eos> What do you want to see?<eos> Or maybe... you can show me.<eos> Show you what?<eos> What you people have.<eos> What my family on the island doesn't.
There are a lot more sick people now.<eos> The CDC doctors are locking everyone in the refectory.<eos> Monsters.<eos> I just hope they don't do to them what they did to my Soren.<eos> Truth is no one knows what they're doing.<eos> You may be in the safest place<eos> - They had no right to punish me.<eos> Doesn't Michael say that the true path<eos> - is always righteous?<eos> - That, he does.
I hadn't even thought of that.<eos> Well, we can choose a name later.<eos> Right now, we have a job to do.<eos> Loose ends that need to be tied up.<eos> Loose ends?<eos> The skeptics, of course.<eos> If we're going to rebuild, there can be no interference.<eos> We can easily expel them from the abbey.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> You don't?
- Five days.<eos> It's strange how the tables have turned.<eos> - How's that?<eos> - I was here 30 years ago.<eos> But I wasn't the one in this bed.<eos> It was Alan.<eos> What happened?<eos> I shot him.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> Love rarely does.
You should really stop talking.<eos> I barely had enough thread - to suture the wound. - Jules...<eos> I said no talking.<eos> - You can't give Mother to Ilaria.<eos> - We can control it.<eos> Like Michael?<eos> Mycosis spreading through bees...<eos> Even Ilaria can't control nature.<eos> - Can't you see that I don't have a choice?<eos> - You do.
He was going to kill them, one by one, until he got Marta Ochoa back.<eos> Ivan "the Terrible" thought he could hide in the jungle and wait it out.<eos> Sooner or later, he figured the narcos would cave in.<eos> Big mistake.<eos> M-19 didn't stand a chance.<eos> "Deliver Marta Ochoa safe and sound... or your family is next."<eos> Signed, "Death to Kidnappers."<eos> Please! Please, let me go.<eos> - Hurry up!<eos> - Please, don't!
Murphy, join t' party, huh?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> All you guys having a good time?<eos> You gotta let it go, man.<eos> There's good that came out of this.<eos> Yeah, we used him, then we got him killed. No, we didn't kill him...<eos> Escobar did.
Oh, my.<eos> And we would call you...<eos> We seemed crazy, yelling for you all over the place... until finally you would appear.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> "Where were you?"<eos> "Where have you been, son?" I would yell out.<eos> "In the mountains, Mama."<eos> "Higher than the clouds, Auntie," Gustavo would say, laughing.<eos> He... He always wanted to go farther.<eos> He always did. But with you.
Hours after the vote, a military helicopter was dispatched to coordinates just outside Medellín, where Pablo was waiting.<eos> As you know, I come on behalf of President Gaviria and the Colombian government.<eos> This is the offer of our terms for your surrender.<eos> Peña and I had to go see it with our own eyes.<eos> A terrorist, a drug dealer and a murderer surrendering to a grateful nation who gave him everything he asked for.<eos> It was the closest we'd ever come to him, and we never felt further away.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Let me hand over my gun.<eos> - You won.<eos> - We both did.
Ah.<eos> Here we go with this bull again.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Hey, son, don't be fooled by his false friendliness, all right?<eos> It's an old, southern trick.<eos> All right?<eos> They call it "the sweet tea."<eos> - Oh, really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> All these things have names?<eos> Yes, they do, son, all of them...
don't do this.<eos> It's okay.<eos> - Bow, I'm not doing anything.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I'm being done to, all right?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Junior.<eos> Junior.<eos> You see what's going on here?<eos> I do.
Back then, you met, fell in love...<eos> Hunted and gathered, and then got eaten by a woolly mammoth.<eos> But what happens when there's no mammoth to take you out?<eos> When you both live?<eos> Some people are lucky and find a way to keep that fire alive for decades, while others burn so bright, they explode.<eos> Look at Britney and K-Fed, Sid and Nancy, Ruby and Earl.<eos> Never heard of Ruby and Earl?<eos> They're the fiery couple who made my childhood miserable... my parents.<eos> When these two loved each other, they loved each other.<eos> But when they didn't, whoo!
I knew just what I had to do.<eos> - Dre.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> What are we doing in this neighborhood?<eos> Please tell me you are not gonna buy me another fake purse.<eos> I've never bought you a fake purse.<eos> - Dre.<eos> - Hmm?<eos> You know that "Chanel" has one "N," right?<eos> - I do now.

And yet, she gets to go out and have a fun afternoon.<eos> What do you get to do? Huh!<eos> Homework.<eos> Who are you?<eos> You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do.
And the witch.<eos> This is the way the world ends.<eos> (Thud) Aleister: So tell me, what did Dr. Bauer say?<eos> She's dying.<eos> You know that's not what I mean.<eos> Aleister: An assassination attempt.<eos> Of course you'd have to try.<eos> What good are you as a werewolf if you don't?<eos> I should not have survived in the first place.<eos> But I did.
I can just... feel her.<eos> Something's not right.<eos> I don't want anything bad to happen to her.<eos> Elena has no influence on you.<eos> You will forget what she said.<eos> She is no longer in your mind.<eos> They want to control me.<eos> If you tear your bed apart, you'll just have to sleep on the floor.<eos> What do you care?<eos> I don't.
Kidnapped, experimented on, used in twisted rituals because of what you are!<eos> I know, it's not your fault and you can't help it.<eos> But I...<eos> I can't help how I feel.<eos> Rachel, please, just let me fix this.<eos> We have a baby on the way...<eos> No. He's our son, Rachel.<eos> It's too late!<eos> What do you mean?<eos> No, no, you didn't...
- Derek...<eos> - No, no, no, don't.<eos> I never loved you.<eos> I needed you...<eos> And I don't need you anymore.<eos> You shouldn't have to pay for my addiction.<eos> How did it go?<eos> It was hard.<eos> He didn't take it well.<eos> You did the right thing.
I mean, I do all the time, because you're there.<eos> And you're here.<eos> And you make everything okay.<eos> You always do.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I mean, I must be.<eos> Because you're always right.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> I think I'm in love with you, too.<eos> I really do.
Okay.<eos> I will strike you down!<eos> You're gonna strike me down?<eos> ! Hang on. See?<eos> That's a... (Charlie laughing) That's our thing.<eos> They're doing a bit.<eos> Sorry, that was just a joke.<eos> Do you guys want to do something a little fun?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I do, I do.
No, no.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not proposing.<eos> I would never, uh... (laughs) No, this is, um, it's a promise ring.<eos> Oh.<eos> So, from now on, Waitress...<eos> I promise to be nice and true.<eos> I have a name.<eos> Do you want the ring or not?<eos> I do, yes.
Supposed to hold up, so I'm holding up.<eos> Hey, you know, we're all pretty devastated, so...<eos> Anyway, Cynthia and I were thinking, now that Ma's gone... maybe you could get your own place in the city...<eos> - ...close to your job and everything.<eos> - You wouldn't have to ride the ferry.<eos> You've really earned this.<eos> You've been living in Mom's house, taking care of her all these years.<eos> Which was so noble of you.<eos> - I don't know how you did it.<eos> I really don't.
I've always looked out for you.<eos> Even when we were little kids, I felt sorry for you because Dad hated me, but at least I got his attention.<eos> Now, I don't care if you're fucking around. I don't.<eos> I don't judge you.<eos> I got your back, Mister.<eos> I just hope you got mine.<eos> Hey, I wanna tell you something.<eos> You don't have to marry Marco.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, my! This is...<eos> A bit excessive?<eos> Yes, I know, but I'm a little anal when it comes to securing the perishables.<eos> You know, I just don't want anything to get rotten, and that's about as-as good as it gets.<eos> You're not the only one with standards around here.<eos> So, come on down to the basement and you can check this out.<eos> Okay, so, uh, watch your step on the stairs here.<eos> Wouldn't want you to trip on any old paint cans or anything like that, but hopefully everything down here, you know, has been properly painted and put where it's supposed to be.<eos> So, you know what I'm saying?<eos> No, I don't.
Well, yeah, that's cool, too, but the health inspection was the whole thing, man!<eos> I pulled it off!<eos> It was like, "Here goes there!"<eos> I did the whole thing.<eos> Uh, Charlie, come on.<eos> We always pass, okay?<eos> We never have a hard time passing.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Nobody gives a shit.<eos> You didn't do anything that special.
I'm trying to be more open with you.<eos> So you're trying to be open with me?<eos> How many abortions have you had?<eos> I'm not gonna share that with you because that is private.<eos> I'm not gonna ask you how many girls you've gotten pregnant.<eos> None.<eos> It's not private.<eos> I've gotten no girls pregnant except for you now.<eos> I think you're behaving very magnanimously this time.<eos> I really do.
Yeah, fuck them!<eos> Fuck them!<eos> So, stand up!<eos> And no offense to coaches but fuck you too.<eos> Fuck you!<eos> - Are we scared? - No! - Are we scared?<eos> - No!<eos> Who are we?<eos> I don't know either.<eos> - I don't.
Look, you know I have to make the call.<eos> Vega's file says that her next-of-kin is an aunt in Tampa.<eos> Did she ever mention anyone else?<eos> It's her father's sister.<eos> She's the only living relative as far as I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> All right, well, I thought I'd just check.<eos> I'll make the call.<eos> You don't have to.<eos> Yeah, I do.
I'm sorry.<eos> Um, yeah, I'm ready.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Your brothers don't hate you, you know.<eos> Yeah, they do.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Jimmy's right -- I left.<eos> After my mom died, I was the parent, and I left.<eos> Well, you felt trapped.<eos> Of course you did.
No.<eos> I hear it's big.<eos> Huge. Yeah.<eos> How's the tea?<eos> Hot.<eos> Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I would have mailed you your cup, but I didn't know where you were.<eos> Well, you knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
He thinks he's gonna impress me with "three."<eos> How's that, now?<eos> Well, three's meaningful to you.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It is. How'd you know?<eos> Hmm, well, because three is meaningful to everyone.<eos> I say three, and you're impressed because you have three kids.<eos> Wait, now.<eos> How do you know I have three kids?<eos> I don't.
For Christ's sakes, Dan...<eos> Frank! Last night, you punched me in the face and I did nothing.<eos> Today, you broke into a man's house, A man who is only a witness at present...<eos> No, it's him!<eos> So be very clear, My next step will be to arrest you, Unless you make yourself scarce and go look for Ronnie.<eos> But it's him!<eos> He's a freak and he's got my son involved in all this weird shit.<eos> Frank. Listen to the sheriff.<eos> We'll handle it.<eos> How did you...?
Father's murderers.<eos> All those figures screaming in his new crime scenes.<eos> Ah, Mr. Clare... it hurts me to create them.<eos> Like I'm bringing them to life and then torturing them.<eos> Like some sort of terrible African voodoo doll.<eos> They're all fresh when they come out of the molds... and then I make them suffer.<eos> Some people think that's what life is.<eos> Born fresh to suffer.<eos> Do you think that?<eos> Uh... I did.
Go on, my dear.<eos> "He took us by our winged backs and raised us over His head.<eos> Thence did he fling us from his Heavenly Throne and... and cast us down, to Earth and to Hell.<eos> So we were..."<eos> Damned?<eos> At the very least.<eos> I'm sorry, this is a fascinating narrative... but I don't see it's much help to us.<eos> It's the hidden language of the demon.<eos> It must have a purpose.<eos> Not everything does.
Thank you.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Oh, it's fantastic, Malcolm.<eos> I wanted her to succeed here tonight. I...<eos> Be still your heart, Doctor.<eos> This is but one evening.<eos> Mr. Gray is being a proper host to a new guest, that's all.<eos> You're smarter than that, Miss Ives.<eos> I wanted her to have life.<eos> Now she does.
For once in my life, I didn't feel like running away.<eos> I felt I had a place to belong.<eos> She was your moors your solitude.<eos> In a way.<eos> Sir Malcolm's just looking for where he belongs now.<eos> Without Mina.<eos> Without you, even.<eos> But when he settles down, he'll come around.<eos> He won't forget about you.<eos> I certainly didn't.
The Master will have her.<eos> Then when I have played this game out, my dear... the lamb will kill the lion.<eos> I suppose I shouldn't be surprised at your tiresome obsession with Miss Ives.<eos> You're so very close after all.<eos> You knew her when she was born, didn't you?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You saw her grow into the fine young woman she is?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah. You watched her rather carefully, I'd say.<eos> Did I?
But in the end I didn't.<eos> I mean, how could you show what the box contained?<eos> I could tell you.<eos> A mirror.<eos> Nothing but a mirror.<eos> What things you must do here.<eos> So much empty space to fill up with your...<eos> adventures.<eos> But you like adventures.<eos> Who doesn't?
I took it out to play hide-and-seek.<eos> I couldn't find it, and then--<eos> Oh, that's what happened.<eos> Okay, well, once again, April's Animal Corner has turned into one of our favorite segments--<eos> Loose Animal in the Studio.<eos> And as always, when we accidentally end up doing Loose Animal in the Studio, we have to show you this disclaimer.<eos> Boring!<eos> Here's a disclaimer, I didn't read this disclaimer.<eos> Ooh, good point.<eos> Okay. Done.
I can't read a book.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't have any.<eos> This is the worst thing that's ever happened to me, and I once had dinner with Guy Fieri.<eos> - Ugh. - Ew.<eos> Look, I've tried. I just can't focus enough to read a book.<eos> They're so boring.<eos> I mean, 30 seconds after I crack it open, I'm sound asleep.<eos> You know exactly what I mean, right, Laurie?<eos> I don't.
Okay, let's make this a great night.<eos> I really think my dad's in love with Diane.<eos> Hi, everybody.<eos> This is Betty.<eos> - It's so nice to meet you, Di--<eos> - Betty.<eos> Di-Betty, I mean, diabetes...<eos> Which I hope you don't have.<eos> I-I made pie.<eos> Well, no, I don't.
Not knowing that if we're okay has made my mom physically sick.<eos> They took her to the hospital.<eos> Hanna..<eos> Let's just all help Hanna unpack.<eos> Hanna, I'm gonna help you unpack.<eos> We're gonna find Mona and we're gonna get out of here tonight.<eos> How?<eos> Did you guys know that, um<eos> I won an Etch A Sketch contest when I was in the third grade?<eos> Of course, you did.
- Yes, Pasha sir.<eos> How educated are you?<eos> Fifth grade.<eos> Come on. Time to complete your education.<eos> I give you a chance.<eos> The world's very cruel, Master.<eos> It laughs at your pain.<eos> You cause the heart-beats of everyone to run faster.<eos> Why do You increase the difficulties of the public?<eos> They do 50 different kinds of drama.
- Come on.<eos> Look. The keys are in the ignition.<eos> Let's take it.<eos> Are you nuts?<eos> You want to go cop in the fucking projects?<eos> Come on.<eos> Fucking hell, man.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> ! Where did you learn to drive?<eos> Maybe I didn't.
- A resident advisor.<eos> Like, for my... dorm in college.<eos> I didn't get that one either.<eos> We must be too emotional.<eos> And that's bad?<eos> Um... I mean, it doesn't make for a good employee.<eos> Like, I read a horrible article this morning about this woman getting stoned in Iran for adultery, and it seriously made me so upset that I've folded this laundry, like, four times already.<eos> Emotional equals unproductive, I guess.<eos> - I like getting stoned.<eos> - Who doesn't?
worshiping nothing!<eos> Speak, woman.<eos> Fucking speak!<eos> You won't, will you?<eos> And you know why?<eos> Because you have nothing to say!<eos> S-s-s-s-s-son of a b-b-bitch!<eos> To a meal well done.<eos> You have embraced your new general with dignity.<eos> Not really, but you did well, anyway.
- This is like a watery brown paste.<eos> - The bag said "snow peas."<eos> Bag?<eos> I'm sure it tastes good.<eos> Don't forget, ladies, your usual meal is 1,500 calories.<eos> Beware of overeating.<eos> Well, this is disappointing.<eos> You've got the poulet à la crème.<eos> I didn't know what that was.<eos> And... I still don't.
Other people planted it, watered it, raked the weeds.<eos> Yeah, well, guess who else got experience growing' shit for other people to eat and gettin' none of it?<eos> - I know!<eos> - Watson?<eos> Is it our ancestors?<eos> - Ohhh, correct! - Whoo-hoo!<eos> And now, we takin' back a little thing called... reparations.<eos> You sure you want to get into the ring with me?<eos> - Oh, okay!<eos> - What if she do?
She got it off this website for "proactive parents."<eos> That's what they call themselves...<eos> Get together and talk about being awesome parents.<eos> I opened it once, but it felt wrong, like, greasy in my head.<eos> Everyone else was using it, and the more they used it, the more they focused, and the more they focused, the more their wishes came true.<eos> But you still didn't use it.<eos> 'Cause my wishes weren't about being smarter.<eos> They were about being normal.<eos> I mean, I didn't want to not be smart.<eos> I just didn't...
You do know that vodka is made from potatoes.<eos> Alcohol has its own rules.<eos> So...<eos> So... What do you think is so important that we had to have dinner tonight?<eos> I'm getting something.<eos> I have a very strong sense that this is the night they announce their retirement.<eos> I've been wondering the same thing.<eos> Of course, I'm not psychic.<eos> Oh, honey, you don't know that.<eos> No. I do.
Take your fucking hand off my sternum!<eos> Please!<eos> Grace.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm sorry, Frankie.<eos> I... didn't know how to handle it.<eos> Well, good job picking the worst way imaginable.<eos> Some things there's no good way to do.<eos> How do I tell the woman I've loved for 40 years that I can't be with her - if I want to be happy.<eos> - You don't.
This fucking thing, man.<eos> You know, I just-- I can't get this thing to turn over.<eos> Didn't I tell you not to star': messing with this truck?<eos> Who told you not to mess with this truck'?<eos> Could have tried some reverse psychology.<eos> Hey, you got any ideas?<eos> Look, changed the carb. Changed the battery. Changed all the ignition shit.<eos> I still can't get it to turn over.<eos> What about the cap and rotor?<eos> - Did you?
You are so full of shit.<eos> That was disgusting.<eos> That was horrible, man.<eos> My father would've fucking hated it.<eos> It would've killed him.<eos> Hey, I danced with you one time.<eos> No!<eos> - I don't think so.<eos> - No, no. We did.<eos> We totally did.
I want you to take this and wait over there.<eos> Get the hell away from me.<eos> I know you're pissed at me, and you have every right to be.<eos> I did what I did to save my friend.<eos> Oh, you lied on national TV, and you cost me my career.<eos> Why would I be pissed?<eos> I didn't lie.<eos> I never sent you to that warehouse.<eos> You put a note on my car.<eos> No, I didn't.
Lionheart is the first movie that made me fall in love with Jean-Claude.<eos> I watch it any time I need to find courage.<eos> I could use some courage right now.<eos> I thought you said this film had dancing in it.<eos> This is dancing.<eos> It's so violent.<eos> Life is violent.<eos> It is.<eos> I didn't think so before.<eos> But you do now.
Ready?<eos> I don't know if we should be leaning on the truck, guys.<eos> Chris, unclench, unclench. I know it's not--<eos> I love it.<eos> Here.<eos> Okay, the only thing you really need to know about me... Is that Tequila makes me want to fight... And cheap wine makes me want to fuck.<eos> I'm sure the lives of many brave young men were lost... In the refinement of that elegant theorem.<eos> I love you. Oh.<eos> Find everything you were looking for today?<eos> Uh, yeah, yeah, we did.
Who was supposed to meet me here, so-- okay, well, I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> For what?<eos> Um, I'm sorry-- I'm sorry for Peter.<eos> It's kind of my job to be sorry for him.<eos> Well, he's Peter hemmings or whoever... So I'm sure he doesn't travel anywhere without his trusty team of apologists.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah, I know, not your fault.<eos> Yeah, um, you get service out here?<eos> No, I don't.
Haven't you heard?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> You know, I called you a bunch of times.<eos> You guys have fun, you and Jill?<eos> I'm tired, okay?<eos> You're all tired out, because it's special shit all of a sudden?<eos> Pretty townie chick, out and about.<eos> I don't want to do this tonight.<eos> Yeah, what, 'cause you already did some of that la fag?
No, really. I wasn't willing to admit how much help I needed.<eos> And I needed somebody to wake me up from the insanity of doing the same thing over and over.<eos> You've been a gift from God to me.<eos> Don't you think that this has been one-sided.<eos> This has meant more to me than you know.<eos> Well, good.<eos> I can't imagine how much your prayers and your passion for God must have meant to your husband.<eos> Gosh, I wish I could've met him.<eos> No.<eos> No, you don't.
I have it, I have it, I have it.<eos> It's 8... 8... 854 Wilson Avenue, apartment 4A... in New York.<eos> In Brooklyn, New York.<eos> Please hurry, it's my baby.<eos> Please hurry.<eos> Where are you?<eos> The police are on their way.<eos> Please don't hurt her!<eos> Emma, the police are coming.<eos> She didn't do anything.
Why don't you put those on?<eos> So you're Proctor's big bad watchdog.<eos> You don't look so tough from where I'm standing.<eos> So here's the plan.<eos> First, I'm gonna kill you.<eos> Then I'm going inside and I'm gonna slowly gut your boss and his "Little House on the Prairie" niece.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Nola.<eos> - Let me die.<eos> - You already did.
What is it?<eos> What?<eos> God verdammt!<eos> Your life, that life, is over.<eos> - I work alone.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> You had someone in that building with you.<eos> And you two weren't performing some remote hack on some of the most advanced security systems on the market while rappelling from the roof, so by my count, that adds up to three guys not counting Mr. Rabbit.<eos> What, do you think I work for some criminal mastermind that goes around calling himself Mr. Rabbit?<eos> Yes, I do. Yes, I do!
- This is it.<eos> - Whoa.<eos> - (music playing) - Marnie: Look at this.<eos> - Hey, sweetie?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I think we should, uh, maybe not tell anyone about our little secret yet.<eos> Oh, baby, don't worry about it.<eos> I am a very private person.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
I only said that the more time that you spend practicing the faster you will be able to read.<eos> That's all right.<eos> We're doing just fine.<eos> I'm sure you and Ostrich Stark have a lot to talk about.<eos> How old were you when you learned how to read?<eos> - 3.<eos> - 3?<eos> Were you taught by your mother?<eos> No.<eos> Our Maester Cressen did.
But I could never have aborted.<eos> Especially when you see what they become.<eos> Better to live like a sleepwalker...<eos> Could you ever abort?<eos> - You want an ashtray?<eos> - Thanks.<eos> I can't have children.<eos> Oh, well don't worry.<eos> Some people try for 10 years until they can have kids.<eos> And others never do.
I felt like I was a very lucky woman.<eos> Then he lost his job.<eos> And he started drinking.<eos> And then... beating me.<eos> I could guess how bad the beating would be by the hands of the clock.<eos> Time was a source of terror.<eos> But in here, every moment spent free of that man is a gift.<eos> But... why are you here?<eos> Because I put rat poison in his bibimbap and killed the motherfucker.<eos> She did her husband, too.
Let's move.<eos> Let's be safe.<eos> All right.<eos> Okay, let's move.<eos> - Tara. - Yeah?<eos> - You got it?<eos> - I got this aisle.<eos> They're stuck behind something.<eos> How do you know?<eos> I don't.
Well, it was just an owl.<eos> Grand scheme of things, I think we'll live.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Heard you lost your wife.<eos> You know...<eos> I'm sure it looks like we haven't lost much, but we have.<eos> We've lost things.<eos> Other things we're just fighting like hell to hold on to.<eos> Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.
No, we exile him if it comes to that.<eos> We do that, we don't know when he comes back And what he does to them.<eos> Letting him go makes this place vulnerable.<eos> You really want to wait till someone in that tower has to take care of it?<eos> And that's if we're lucky.<eos> We are not... Executing anyone.<eos> Don't ever suggest it again.<eos> That sort of thinking doesn't belong in here.<eos> People die now, deanna.<eos> They do.
The dead don't choose, but the choices you made, how you sacrificed your own--<eos> I know what you're doing.<eos> Bob was mutilated.<eos> Consumed.<eos> Destroyed because of your sins.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Your brother felt he was apart from it.<eos> He was a part of it.<eos> He didn't deserve to be here.<eos> - You don't!
Since we're all family here, I'm just gonna come right out and say it.<eos> Roger Pierce was an asshole.<eos> Everyone in this room wanted to wring his neck at some point or another.<eos> I never met the guy, but I'm pretty sure if I had, I'd want to do the same.<eos> The question is, who acted on that impulse?<eos> Who was Roger's killer?<eos> Dad!<eos> You threatened Roger with great bodily harm when he insulted me at dinner, a detail you conveniently left out when Agent Moretti and I interviewed you.<eos> - He has Alzheimer's.<eos> - Not here he doesn't.
My mother saw Roger groping Celia in the back staircase hours before his death, forcing himself on a subservient employee...<eos> An employee who has mysteriously gone missing.<eos> If Celia is the killer, then what the hell are you lecturing us about?<eos> Shouldn't you be outside, trying to find her?<eos> No, because I know exactly where Celia is.<eos> Does anybody find it strange that Celia and Alice were never in the same room at the same time?<eos> And do any of you find it as interesting as I do that Celia is an anagram of Alice?<eos> [Scoffs] That doesn't prove anything.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But this does.
All right, I believe you.<eos> I knew it.<eos> I knew it. Finally, someone believes me.<eos> - Why do you believe me?<eos> - I heard the details.<eos> - Your story makes sense.<eos> - Of course it does.<eos> Devil's advocate, like the cop said, the Kettlemans' cars are still at their house.<eos> No record of them leaving. How'd they get out of the country?<eos> They didn't.
You're good at convincing people to do things, aren't you, Mary?<eos> I just want you to know how important your support has been... throughout this entire process.<eos> Call your fucking source, Mary.<eos> Now... it's bad.<eos> - You said he wouldn't have to. - I know, just...<eos> You'd verify the documents and he wouldn't have to do anything else.<eos> Well, it didn't work out that way, did it?<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Nicki. I'm just...<eos> I'm ti... I'm just tired.<eos> Bill did nothing wrong.
I mean, i get a few of these letters every once in a while, But so does everybody.<eos> Is there anyone else you can think of?<eos> There's this guy who works at my coffee shop, Letterhead coffee, right across the street from me.<eos> He's this tall, hipster-nerd type.<eos> He's always asking me a bunch of questions,<eos> But he seems pretty harmless. Corey something.<eos> I don't know his last name.<eos> Does he know your last name?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Uh, how do you mean?<eos> The breakdown of the family structure<eos> - leads to criminal behavior.<eos> You deal with it every day. - Right.<eos> Yeah. Nothing good ever came from a broken home.<eos> There's no more waiting until marriage.<eos> These kids are hooking up with strangers they met on a phone app.<eos> Why buy the cow when you can get the milk for free?<eos> That's not happening to Hayley.<eos> So what do you do...
Michie, you can make such a difference here.<eos> You were on the field when the shooter fired.<eos> Your boyfriend got caught up in a turf war.<eos> You think they're after Raj because he was connected to Kill Street.<eos> That silver S.U.V... you ever seen it before?<eos> Yeah...<eos> belongs to Boz Shepherd.<eos> Did you happen to see who was driving it today?<eos> You want me to say it was Boz.<eos> And what if I did?
Yeah.<eos> Apparently, it went viral.<eos> You sure about this?<eos> Don't know yet.<eos> Does Steve know you're here?<eos> How's he doing?<eos> Doctor said he's gonna be all right.<eos> You really love him?<eos> He's an idiot most of the time, but... yeah.<eos> I do.
Oh, sure.<eos> I know that.<eos> Steve...<eos> Gail, he was right here.<eos> We could have put that guy away, but now...<eos> now he's back out there.<eos> Because he didn't do it.<eos> You know, I thought we had each other's back.<eos> Yeah, same team for the first time.<eos> I did.
Oh, my God, what are you doing here?<eos> LAURALEE: Sophie, you know what Gail did today?<eos> She was a hero.<eos> She saved a girl without even knowing her.<eos> She didn't even think twice.<eos> No big deal.<eos> What was her name?<eos> Michie.<eos> I like that name.<eos> - You do?
I...<eos> You caught me off guard and everything came out wrong and I'm sorry.<eos> Well, it won't happen again, okay?<eos> From now on, you're just the asshole who knocked up my mom.<eos> Okay, fine, I'm the asshole.<eos> I mean, I've caused you nothing but problems since I got here, so I get it.<eos> Pretty much.<eos> Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.
Fuck.<eos> - Why do you even care?<eos> - I just do.<eos> Why?<eos> Look, my old man never gave a shit about me.<eos> All right?<eos> I mean...<eos> I guess you could call him honest.<eos> But I fucking hated him for it.<eos> I still do.
Amy, I have gotten more done in the last few days than I have since I made the switch to dark matter.<eos> What if I stop doing this, and it all goes away?<eos> Your thoughts and ideas come from you, not from your anxiety.<eos> Hmm, perhaps.<eos> But I'm not taking the cap off.<eos> It's one thing to make yourself miserable, but you're making everyone around you miserable, too.<eos> Now, I'm telling you for the last time-- take the cap off.<eos> Oh!<eos> Really?<eos> What if I don't?
Never mind.<eos> I've had one partner leave because I put her in the shade.<eos> Sorry?<eos> I don't see how someone who confuses his personal and professional lives and quotes old TV shows can put me in the shade.<eos> I thought transfer requests were personal. It seems I'm wrong.<eos> Shall we go?<eos> I'd hate to be unprofessional.<eos> I never said...<eos> We have our own ways of working.<eos> Yes, we do.
To pray for Munni.<eos> I see, so where are you now?<eos> Now... we just left for Gojra<eos> You left for Gojra?<eos> I see.<eos> - Okay, I'll call you later.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> - Take care.<eos> Brother, finally you lied.<eos> - No. I didn't.
God bless.<eos> Very gallant.<eos> See, that's how you take your leave of a lady.<eos> All right.<eos> Piss off, the lot of ye.<eos> Ye happen to run into the rightful king across the water, you tell him Angus Mhor sends his best, eh?<eos> King James is in Italy, ye fool, no France.<eos> No, I meant if ye go...<eos> I meant if ye go to Italy!<eos> Yer arse, ye did.
What happened to you two?<eos> I get the drugs out of this dead girl, you leave immediately.<eos> And we split the money, 50/50.<eos> 60/40.<eos> This isn't a negotiation.<eos> Split even or nothing.<eos> I may need one more day to set up the deal.<eos> You know someone?<eos> I found a place.<eos> A job we did in West Ham.
I understand.<eos> But it's no your fault, you know that, don't you?<eos> You mustn't feel guilty.<eos> I don't feel guilty.<eos> That's what's odd.<eos> Do you like to sail?<eos> - I love to sail.<eos> - I do, too.<eos> I think we're going to be very happy, you and I.<eos> I do, too.
I live to serve.<eos> I'm going to ask him tomorrow.<eos> - What if he says no?<eos> - He won't.<eos> We've waited long enough.<eos> I want you to be my wife.<eos> Now.<eos> What is it?<eos> Do you want to marry me because our families arranged it?<eos> Or do you--
We cannot give in to despair.<eos> I will speak with the High Sparrow.<eos> There must be something he...<eos> Let me talk to him on your behalf.<eos> The king cannot sully himself negotiating with an unwashed fanatic.<eos> You will try to help her?<eos> I'll do everything I can to win her freedom and her brother's.<eos> Your happiness is all I want in this world.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
The acts themselves, the degree of contrition.<eos> Thank you, High Septon, for bringing them whatever justice they deserve in the eyes of the Seven.<eos> Did you know this chapel is one of the oldest structures in King's Landing?<eos> I think I may have heard at one point.<eos> Baelor built his sept around it.<eos> But men worshipped here long before him.<eos> Who carved this altar?<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - I'm afraid I don't.<eos> No one does.
No?<eos> What is he?<eos> We're allies.<eos> You fucking traitor.<eos> You fight for the crows now?<eos> I don't fight for the crows.<eos> We're not here to fight.<eos> We're here to talk.<eos> Is that right?<eos> You and the pretty crow do a lot of talking, Tormund?
It was like my seventh interview in two weeks.<eos> Seriously, the system is broken.<eos> Like, they should just tell you ahead of time whether or not you're gonna get the job so you don't have to waste all that time and energy doing your hair and, like, getting your nails done,<eos> and then you could just stay home and, like, look for other work instead.<eos> Shoshanna, interviews are bullshit.<eos> All interviews.<eos> Even talk show interviews.<eos> Fuck Phil Donahue.<eos> I just don't understand why nobody tells you how bad it's gonna be in the real world.<eos> Yeah, they do.
Or what, you write me up and pencil bone me, you paper clip?<eos> Hey, you wanted to work with me, okay?<eos> This is me.<eos> So I've got to go out and find a pay phone?<eos> Do you got one in the car?<eos> Send the old guy out to find a pay phone.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I just bought you five minutes.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> - No, you don't.
Husband has brain cancer.<eos> Nothing they can do but dope him up till it gets him.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> I don't know, can I?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's a birthday card.<eos> So you make the husband as the doer?<eos> I do indeed.<eos> Not seeing a whole lot of evidence.<eos> Well, domestic homicide, you usually don't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> - How you doing?<eos> - not bad.<eos> - (PRINTER WHIRRS)<eos> I... I suppose you're wondering.<eos> That little, um... escapade.<eos> We were just mucking about.<eos> Uncle Lance said you never take it up the bum.<eos> (LAUGHS) Oh, my God!<eos> ADAM: He did.
Boys?<eos> If you're going to do that, could you go inside?<eos> Do what?<eos> Toss each other off.<eos> OK, Freddie, could you both, er... ?<eos> Sorry.<eos> He's fit.<eos> I can see why you chased after him.<eos> Except Lance ended up getting slaughtered.<eos> Right, I didn't... Um...
Is burying Matt in Oakland... I mean, is that something you would even...<eos> No.<eos> It's where we're from.<eos> It's everything I had to get Matt and Mark away from.<eos> Uh, th-then where?<eos> I... will take Matt with me, get him a plot in Simi Valley.<eos> And you get to decide that?<eos> Yes.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - No. No, we don't.
They're damaged.<eos> I don't want to hear about any of it.<eos> So, please.<eos> Please just leave it, okay?<eos> Something happened with our daughter.<eos> She's holding on to her life.<eos> That's what's happening.<eos> And you want to talk about whether she was raped,<eos> - whether she wasn't raped.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Well, my Mercedes is in the shop.<eos> Yeah.. I ought to give him a raise. You're right.<eos> Jim, I saw you on the TV...<eos> That billboard thing.<eos> And I had me a pair of insights.<eos> Insight the first, you ain't afraid to put yourself out there.<eos> And insight the second, you believe in the real America...<eos> Freedom, self-sufficiency.<eos> I do. I...<eos> I really do.
You think I'm crazy.<eos> I never said that.<eos> No, you didn't, because you're very polite, but you think it.<eos> Otherwise, you wouldn't be talking about commitment.<eos> You find that idea distressing.<eos> Who the hell wouldn't?<eos> I... I find it inappropriate for a person suffering from a physical condition.<eos> Anyone who's spent more than a few minutes with me knows that this isn't some kind of delusion.<eos> Wouldn't you agree, Kim?<eos> Of course she does.
She really tried to kill herself?<eos> Why?<eos> She think Heaven's gonna be any nicer than that house?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> - Sorry. But for real.<eos> Why would she do that?<eos> I think she...<eos> Sometimes it just gets to be too much, you know?<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> 'Course you do.
- No,<eos> I think you're awesome. It's me I wonder about sometimes.<eos> Come on, nerd, walk me to band practice.<eos> So how'd it go?<eos> With Timothy?<eos> Not great.<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I thought you said I had, autonomy, when it comes to academics here.<eos> - You do.
A scalding hot plate of spaghetti fell into my face?<eos> I'm to remember every man I've seen fall into a plate of spaghetti?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Uh, can I get your order?<eos> Get me the snapper, bozo.<eos> Snapper fish for the man.<eos> Actually, our fish supplier had an incident at their facility, so we are limited on fish.<eos> Market price is quite high today.<eos> Do you have the snapper or not?<eos> Yeah, uh, we do.
- Don't say it.<eos> - He just said that.<eos> - Just say the answer.<eos> Show... show me.. is the part I say?<eos> Here's the one thing... there's only one thing in the whole world at this moment you shouldn't say...<eos> - Mm-hmm? - "Show me."<eos> So just give me the answer, and then I'll say sh...<eos> You know what, go ahead and do it.<eos> Just go ahead and do it, then.<eos> - Do what?
Needed his time to be someone's fault, so he made it mine.<eos> If that was true, why didn't he just cap us when he got out?<eos> 'Cause he wanted the business back.<eos> He needed to learn how it worked.<eos> What you taught him.<eos> All he needed was an introduction to Lobos.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> He asked to come to the Lobos meet.<eos> He wanted me to take him.<eos> Of course he did.
So you lied to my face.<eos> Tommy, I wanted to tell you, but you were so deep under Kanan's sway.<eos> I ain't never given you a reason not to trust me, Ghost.<eos> Except that one time.<eos> You know, the one where you forgot to mention that Holly talked to the feds?<eos> You had your reasons, Tommy, for not telling me.<eos> Don't make it any less true, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Well, now you know everything.<eos> Do I?
It's nice to go to a diner, too, you know?<eos> Like, I like diners.<eos> Yes.<eos> I appreciate a menu with pictures.<eos> It makes it easier.<eos> It's like sometimes those guys make me do things that aren't really me, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Like, okay, like, I kind of feel compelled to call you a bird right now and throw my glass of water in your face.<eos> But, uh, you know, I'm realizing that I only do that stuff 'cause I don't want the guys to do it to me first, you know what I mean?<eos> Of course I do.
Can I, um...?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> There's a beer I want to...<eos> Oh.<eos> So, you know, just... all right?<eos> Yeah, I'm s... sorry.<eos> Okay. Do you want one, or...?<eos> No.<eos> I... don't.
When I get my money, I want to buy a new cell phone.<eos> I'm gonna a gun, because I'm the man of the house.<eos> Oh, shit, no.<eos> This kid should not have a...<eos> No.<eos> No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.<eos> Your dad loves you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
No, no.<eos> Please.<eos> We're trying to show Bill that life is worth living.<eos> Your dad loves you.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Oh.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Has he not said it?<eos> Because I'm telling you, he just...<eos> He does. No.
We've been over this.<eos> We've justified this already.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We're okay with it.<eos> Fair enough.<eos> Uh, turns out that Mac's dad didn't kill the guy.<eos> No, there was another man in on this.<eos> Yeah, it's gonna look really bad if I rat on this man Eduardo Sanchez, so I can't say his name.<eos> Uh...<eos> You just did.
I would really love to take you up on those hip-hop dancing lessons.<eos> Yeah? Yeah, but just don't say anything.<eos> Wanting to get down a little more?<eos> Hey, Peck. How are you?<eos> Good to see you.<eos> You, too.<eos> Moore, hey. Um...<eos> This isn't a date, but I have some warm beer in my locker, and I was wondering if you wanted to get it...<eos> Hell yeah!<eos> - Okay. - I do.
That's my line!<eos> [ door closes ] So, the brain will create love Even when we don't have it, right?<eos> What's your point?<eos> Nothing, except for the fact That your idea of a perfect relationship Is nothing but a delusional fantasy.<eos> Come on.<eos> It's funny.<eos> No? Okay, what's up, dov?<eos> You don't talk to me for months, And now you want to be my friend?<eos> Actually, no, i don't.<eos> No? You don't?
But i had a job to do.<eos> So, after everything that it cost you, You're okay with the choices you made?<eos> Here's what i do know --<eos> I can live with myself.<eos> I can look in the mirror and still see me.<eos> And sometimes that's all you can hope for.<eos> [ footsteps depart ] [ door opens ] bill: Gail.<eos> They're ready for you.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, And nothing but the truth, so help you god?<eos> I do.
But i'll see you around, all right?<eos> Excuse me. Can you go any faster?<eos> I'm gonna miss my plane.<eos> Oh. Seriously?<eos> Unreal.<eos> Hi.<eos> Your phone's off. I know.<eos> I was in court. What are -- is everything okay?<eos> Nick, how did you know that this was my car?<eos> I didn't.
¶ what easy prey ¶<eos> Hey, still have your key. Thought i'd come by.<eos> You can take some more shots at me In case you didn't get your fill today.<eos> What time's your flight?<eos> Don't have a flight.<eos> Oh, yeah? Taking a train to vancouver?<eos> I'm not taking the train.<eos> Look, i only told you about the offer to give you an out.<eos> Giving me an out. I don't want an out.<eos> I never did, okay?
Delma, you want that mole removed or not?<eos> So many secrets.<eos> So many, many secrets.<eos> So I gave Delma the Band-Aids and the Neosporin and I sent her on her way.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, now that we're alone, we should talk, because I'm pretty sure I know what's going on with you.<eos> I saw this test mixed into Lemon's folder, and...<eos> I don't know... What you're talking about.<eos> Nope.<eos> I do not.
But we are here on official town business.<eos> Yeah. Well, maybe you recognize me.<eos> Mayor Hayes.<eos> Mayor Lavon Hayes.<eos> Of BlueBell?<eos> Don't follow politics.<eos> Well, uh, perhaps you remember a-a certain sack against Florida State in the champ...<eos> Two Super Bowls?<eos> I prefer baseball.<eos> Oh, who doesn't, really?
He might surprise you.<eos> I'm sorry that i walked out of dinner, But you should know the reason why.<eos> I'm having your baby.<eos> I'm gonna do this on my own, And i don't expect anything from you.<eos> Zoe!<eos> Please open up!<eos> Can-can we talk?<eos> Have you, uh, seen zoe?<eos> Is she all right? She's upstairs sleeping, If you want to wait.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, i do.
You're gonna punish her because you lost those batshit Kettlemans?<eos> You notice I'm not exactly crowing over how I snaked them away from you.<eos> Here are your files.<eos> I'm not gonna discuss my employee policies with you.<eos> I'm gonna need some help here.<eos> You sure are.<eos> That prick firing you?<eos> Best-case scenario is my two-year plan just became a ten-year plan.<eos> That schmuck.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
Oh, it's Mr. McGill.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Oh, I love what you've done with the place.<eos> Last time I was here, it was well, not a contender for the cover of Good Housekeeping, that's for sure.<eos> - Do you have news about our case?<eos> - I do, in fact.<eos> But before we get to the nitty-gritty, I think we should chat about your deal.<eos> We told you, there will be no deal.<eos> You did, didn't you?
The rents from quarter day...<eos> You might need it.<eos> You'll take it, and none of your nonsense.<eos> This... Belongs to Ian.<eos> He has another one.<eos> Put it in the top of your stocking.<eos> Hold it with your garter.<eos> Never take it off, even when you sleep.<eos> Do you ken how to use a knife?<eos> Yes, I do.
Here.<eos> Make this very clear that if anyone tries to signal outside it would be a very bad idea.<eos> You don't need to keep that gun on us<eos> He's my son<eos> Yes I had a son as well<eos> No, no thanks. Cause I'm not gonna kill ya<eos> Fucks<eos> What's going on out there Mike?<eos> Backup's here<eos> How you doing doc?
I'm willing to screw up a lot of things, but not that.<eos> - Well, cheers, mate.<eos> I'm touched.<eos> Get in!<eos> What did she say, Julia?<eos> Her final words, what were they?<eos> She said that you would come for me.<eos> There would be nowhere I could hide.<eos> She didn't deserve to die.<eos> No, she didn't.
Well, it's cold out there.<eos> The Agency is the best bet for survival.<eos> Besides, I was fucking good at my job.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You were.<eos> Don't you fucking move.<eos> You just still see the bad we did.<eos> I see the good.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
But Robert and I are very close.<eos> He and Ruth have me over for dinner once a month.<eos> So you already knew about the Alzheimer's?<eos> He told me the day he was diagnosed.<eos> I've never had anything but his best interests at heart.<eos> You don't care about Robert.<eos> You wanted to sideline me.<eos> So you actually think you have a shot at this office?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so does the leadership.
It's gonna look good.<eos> Ugh!<eos> This is fun.<eos> You have really nice skin.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> Okay, can we just...?<eos> Okay.<eos> Hey, wait a minute, what is that?<eos> No, no, no, you need this.<eos> No, I don't.
If you just let me... make you up like a lady, I will--<eos> No, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> You will have the best sex of your entire life.<eos> I mean, tell me this isn't already turning you on a little bit?<eos> If you--<eos> If you just let me do you, you know, like a lady.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> If you do, then--
You killed these children through another.<eos> Please, now do the correct thing to do.<eos> Thousands of years of this, and they still throw stones.<eos> You're purifying yourself. But it's too late already.<eos> Father.<eos> Father.<eos> You know something.<eos> What do you know about Juan Cerboni, Lucio's mother's ex boyfriend?<eos> I recognise evil when I see it.<eos> We all did.
You're making this personal.<eos> You never liked me. That was always clear.<eos> Because guys like you, you're always looking for that climb.<eos> I was a good agent, Alex.<eos> But that wasn't good enough for you.<eos> Well, I wasn't after your job, if that's what you thought.<eos> I wasn't worried about you taking my job.<eos> Then what?<eos> You knew how shaky things were at home for her.<eos> We all did.
Maybe.<eos> But it would take forever.<eos> Just how long do you think the residents of Sandpiper Crossing have?<eos> Referring this case to HHM is for the good of the clients.<eos> That argument you won today against the restraining order the judge was never gonna grant that.<eos> Schweikart is throwing softballs. And he's gonna keep on throwing them over and over.<eos> We'll be busy swatting them away we'll never spend time on the actual case.<eos> This case will span years.<eos> And we don't have the capital to carry it forward by ourselves.<eos> We simply don't.
And they're interested.<eos> They want to make an offer contingent on an interview.<eos> - They've got a partner-track position.<eos> - Wait. What?<eos> Partner track?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> There's an office in Santa Fe with your name on it.<eos> Or there could be.<eos> And you'd be working on your case.<eos> I don't even...
Well, you should get some sleep.<eos> It's late over there.<eos> Good night.<eos> Hold off on the vote?<eos> Until we sit down.<eos> But we keep it in our back pocket.<eos> Michael Corrigan?<eos> They're going to release him when we visit.<eos> You made a miracle happen.<eos> We did.
Isn't that what marriage is about?<eos> Accepting your partner's selfishness?<eos> You of all people should understand.<eos> You know nothing about marriage.<eos> You think it's about... sacrifice?<eos> I think it's about respect.<eos> And you're not respecting his pain.<eos> - His pain doesn't matter.<eos> - How can you say that?<eos> Because mine doesn't either.
I'm sure they loved you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's just, before the divorce, they were perfect, and then... afterwards, they were just human.<eos> And I hated them.<eos> Man, I really hated them.<eos> It took me years to realize that that doesn't make... them any less.<eos> It actually made them more, because we're human beings, and we all make mistakes.<eos> You know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I grew up in a house, just like this, till I was 17.<eos> Suddenly, I'm not living there.<eos> Suddenly, I'm not going to college... but Mr. Whitehall took me in and gave me a job.<eos> And never, ever let me forget it.<eos> Well, two suspects at breakfast.<eos> How many you think lunch will give us? Hmm?<eos> I've lived here my whole life, I've never once been in this place.<eos> Hey, Gary, how are you, man?<eos> Played here last weekend with Judge Walters.<eos> Of course you did.
- I guess so.<eos> Oh, I was feeling so angry at you, but I feel like you're really supporting my tenure now.<eos> I am, I do, of course.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Of us, even.<eos> Get a load of those two, the dread on their faces?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do?
Oh, I was feeling so angry at you, but I feel like you're really supporting my tenure now.<eos> I am, I do, of course.<eos> I'm so proud of you.<eos> Of us, even.<eos> Get a load of those two, the dread on their faces?<eos> - Jesus.<eos> - (scoffs) I know.<eos> Uh, I feel there's something I want to share with you.<eos> - You do?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- That's gross.<eos> - I think it's cool.<eos> I think it's, like, sexual, but not too on the nose.<eos> And it could be like a friendship thing.<eos> - We'll both do it.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Hannah: Excuse me?<eos> Could we get two best "friendulum" piercings, please?<eos> (snorts) Who wants to go first?<eos> She does.
There's actually something that would look really beautiful in your hair.<eos> - If you're gonna wear it back...<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Mom, where have you been?<eos> - There you are!<eos> You were gone when we woke up.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I have been calling you for 45 minutes.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I did not...
Yeah, I'll be back.<eos> I know it's been forever since I've been a t. B.D. Special guest.<eos> I'm so excited.<eos> All right, I'll see you tonight.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hi! - Oh, my gosh, this place looks amazing.<eos> - Doesn't it look great?<eos> Yeah. How are you?<eos> - I heard you got the flu or something.<eos> - Ugh, I did.
- He's never even seen us play!<eos> - He's right.<eos> Okay, new plan.<eos> We put on a show featuring Triple Exes, and invite him to come hear us play live.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hey, after that interview,<eos> I'm happy to let the music do the talking.<eos> I gotta say, I'm still really disappointed about that Jade St. John concert. I wish we could go...<eos> Mom, I told you, I already had plans.<eos> Yes, you did.
I shouldn't have gone.<eos> I couldn't come up with anything and she's askin' me what's wrong and sayin' I'm not bein' real 'cause she wants to write this sad-ass song that I... I can't go there right now, you know?<eos> 'Cause that's all I got playing' in my damn head all day.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't want everybody to know all this.<eos> I just...<eos> I just don't want it ripping' you apart.<eos> Tell you...<eos> I wish I'd never told anybody.<eos> Well, you did.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> Sure. Sure.<eos> Uh, will is a hell of a singer.<eos> You two get to know each other.<eos> Excuse me one second.<eos> Hey, listen, I know this is last-minute, but Rayna had to bow out unexpectedly, and I was hoping you might fill in.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> Teddy, I, uh... I know about Deacon.<eos> - You do?
You were huge!<eos> They played that commercial for eight years straight.<eos> I bought all my weed at high school off of that.<eos> Man, I-I've always wanted to be that famous.<eos> You got to do it for me.<eos> Oh, I'm out the game.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> Please. I'm in a dark place.<eos> Just... Tell me what you love.<eos> I don't... ohh.
Where is it?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do, or you wouldn't be drawing that symbol... a symbol you've seen before.<eos> Wait. Wait.<eos> That's it, isn't it?<eos> You've seen it before, but you can't remember where, right?<eos> Something like that.<eos> You've got the ring of the Magi!<eos> - No!<eos> - Yes, you do!
Grace...<eos> I asked Grandpa not to call you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I don't want to talk about it.<eos> Sometimes, holding things inside can make them grow bigger and stronger.<eos> It helps to talk.<eos> There's a rumour going around school that I'm a witch and that Grey House is haunted.<eos> Did that help?<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
Glen.<eos> I know something could happen to me.<eos> But I feel safe because I know you're mine.<eos> Glen, stop.<eos> Why?<eos> Because I'm married.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I understand.<eos> You don't.
Fine.<eos> I think.<eos> I'm going to Max's.<eos> I'll probably be back late.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll be asleep.<eos> Well then... I'll be going.<eos> - No buzzer?<eos> - I used it.<eos> - You did?
I have to admit I'm lucky on that level.<eos> Karine is pretty relaxing.<eos> She isn't at all suspicious.<eos> It never even crosses her mind.<eos> Good for you.<eos> You know me. I'm not like that. I follow my route.<eos> I'm not bragging.<eos> In all these years, ifs never been that tough.<eos> And, to be honest, the opportunity never arose. Bu!<eos> if it did...

I can't tell my family I was an accomplice to murder.<eos> Spare me that look.<eos> Karine and I don'!<eos> share the same brain, 0k.<eos> - Have you ever lied to her?<eos> - Of course. Loads of times.<eos> Loads of times?<eos> Of course I lie. Don'!<eos> you?<eos> Well I do.
Have a seat, please.<eos> Henri came to see me this morning.<eos> Er... I've been so worried about him.<eos> He hasn't been home for three days.<eos> Why is he avoiding me?<eos> I think... because he lost control in the window, he feels ashamed.<eos> But more than that, he...<eos> he survived and his men died and he feels responsible.<eos> ~ That makes no sense.<eos> ~ But it does to him.
~ Ooh! ~ I have another one you can try.<eos> Er, I...<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I've... ~ I've changed my mind.<eos> ~ Oh! All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How are you?<eos> I know everyone's a bit shaken up.<eos> Oh. I'm almost scared to walk home tonight.<eos> Then don't.
They need to see me.<eos> They're not taking my calls.<eos> They can't keep ignoring me.<eos> Why did they move you here? I don't have to explain that to you.<eos> You've been in these places.<eos> Everything but a bell goes off when they smell fresh meat.<eos> Tell Spencer to cut this embargo crap before it's too late.<eos> Have you forgotten what it feels like to be in a cage for something you didn't do?<eos> Do you remember how that felt?<eos> Yes, I do.
Saying no is not as hard as taking the call.<eos> Have you seen her since...<eos> Once.<eos> I can't go back.<eos> I can't even look at her now without thinking she might've had something to do with what happened to my mom.<eos> That building, where the student union is, that's the original college. Founding father Eustace Ballard laid the first brick of foundation himself.<eos> I can show you a plaque carved in wood from Mr. Ballard's outhouse.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did I mention Ballard was also a minister?<eos> Yeah, you did.
Well, all right.<eos> That's great.<eos> You kids want some candy?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Depends, I guess.<eos> Depends on what?<eos> Chunky chocolate, Taffy bits, marshmallows?<eos> You... you don't know if you like that stuff?<eos> - I know I do.<eos> - Course you do.
One day soon I will rule France, with Queen Anne at my side.<eos> And then a word from me and you'll find your head on the block.<eos> You?<eos> The ruler of France?<eos> You're madder than a rabid dog.<eos> Then be careful I don't bite you.<eos> That is the second time you have struck me.<eos> There will not be a third.<eos> Do you really have to go?<eos> I do.
Shhh, you were dreaming.<eos> I've never felt anything like it before.<eos> I was so scared...<eos> God granted you a prophecy.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> I hope you're wrong.<eos> We can't reject the truth when it is revealed.<eos> He's insisting that we move him somewhere safer.<eos> He knows where I am.<eos> Who does?
She gave it to you on a plate.<eos> There was no arms trafficking.<eos> You were duped by an inexperienced restaurant owner.<eos> Well done, Achard.<eos> A nice end to your career.<eos> - Drop your weapon!<eos> - Put your weapon down!<eos> - Put your weapon down!<eos> - Captain.<eos> Do it!
- Claire, come back inside.<eos> - Not with Henry still inside.<eos> - Claire.<eos> I'm going in, Wes.<eos> The emergency response team is sweeping the facility.<eos> They will find him.<eos> Yeah?<eos> They will take care of him.<eos> That is their job.<eos> And what if they don't?
- You're out of your mind.<eos> What was all that talk just then?<eos> Mutual respect is all.<eos> Is this why you brought me out here?<eos> To show me a good time hoping I'd give you something back for all that you've done?<eos> Is that why you've done it all in the first place?<eos> - Was that your game?<eos> - Hey, this isn't a game.<eos> I got feelings for you, Harry. As much as just said so as did you about me.<eos> I certainly didn't.
Did your brother have money?<eos> Was he well-off?<eos> No.<eos> Then how could he afford a second-class ticket?<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> He doesn't know, but look, maybe Aldo stole it.<eos> But Gino came here honestly.<eos> He's a good man.<eos> He has a family, a job, you know?<eos> He didn't do no wrong.
- Happy anniversary.<eos> - Three months.<eos> - It's a quarter paper anniversary.<eos> I bumped it up.<eos> How did it go with Hanne and Saga today?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I met her only briefly.<eos> Hanne is clever.<eos> I don't know if she understands Saga.<eos> - Who does? - I do.
Oh, Lemon! Oh, it's perfect.<eos> - Thank you!<eos> - Of course!<eos> George: Yes, thank you so much.<eos> But why couldn't you just tell us this last night?<eos> Well... because I have a favor to ask.<eos> Uh-huh. As both of you know, I've been stressing out about the reopening of Fancie's, particularly the menu.<eos> And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.
The girls have had a long day.<eos> And, Pattie, here's something for you.<eos> I don't need to tell you what's in this box.<eos> Oh.. it's arrived!<eos> Take a look.<eos> Oh, Robert, come on.<eos> Shoo!<eos> You're not allowed to see.<eos> They don't want me here.<eos> Of course they do!
I do.<eos> When you were picking through the bones and burnt flesh at the World Trade Center, that belief work for you then?<eos> As a matter of fact, it did.<eos> In many ways, my faith became stronger.<eos> It helped me deal with all of that.<eos> There must be a better place somewhere.<eos> What else could make sense of this child's torment?<eos> I'm a vet, Doc.<eos> Re-upped after 9/11.<eos> A lot of cops did.
This is unfair.<eos> I have to get out.<eos> I got a business.<eos> - There are people I take care of.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I can't stay here.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do your fucking job.<eos> I got things to do.<eos> Don't we all?
This one.<eos> Who's that?<eos> That's my daughter.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Madeline.<eos> Maddie. She's pretty.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - She gets that from her mother, obviously.<eos> Didn't tell me you guys had a suspect.<eos> We don't.
No, I'm still very interested.<eos> It's just something... something's come up, and I was just wondering if I could come by tomorrow and...<eos> Sure.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Bye.<eos> It's you and me against the world, little one.<eos> Why don't you take her along with you?<eos> Single girls with babies aren't exactly a good look.<eos> You don't know that until you get there.<eos> Yes, I do.
Was your picture in the paper last week?<eos> Uh, yes.<eos> Yeah, my mom did that.<eos> Clearly without asking.<eos> I'm on the short list for an internship with Elon Musk.<eos> I love perfume.<eos> I'm kidding.<eos> Spacex, right?<eos> You really think he's going to Mars?<eos> Uh, yeah. Yeah, I totally do.
She's absolutely twatted and won't remember a word.<eos> Go on.<eos> Oh, darling. That's amazing.<eos> How was it?<eos> It was absolutely superb.<eos> She says all these tiny things that, you know, says massive stuff, and... .. and I think she really liked me and all.<eos> Wow...<eos> What did you say to her?<eos> ~ What happened?<eos> ~ You did.
Well, what did he tell you?<eos> Enough for me to know it would be unethical If somebody didn't look into this.<eos> But you can't, so you want me to get harvey to.<eos> Well, you convinced him to look into my case When he didn't want to, didn't you? This is different.<eos> We don't take cases like this.<eos> But I believe a man who can convince harvey To hire someone who never went to law school Could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't tell you I know.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Well, I do.
If I gave you something too needy, It would intimidate you, and you would let it die.<eos> You expect me to believe that's why you're really here?<eos> Of course not.<eos> What you're gonna do in an hour:<eos> Crash mike's meeting.<eos> Donna, I can't have him risking our other business.<eos> It was one client, and you covered it.<eos> And if he drags this to trial, It will be every client.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Well, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Harvey.<eos> - Jessica, it's one case.<eos> He asked me to trust him, and I'm gonna do it, And if you're ever gonna be able to enjoy a vacation,<eos> You're gonna have to trust me.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> You do know that doesn't mean "good night."<eos> Of course I do.
I saw the video.<eos> You and Dr Peep.<eos> - She OK?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> You're gonna have to look at me sometime.<eos> You can't pretend this didn't happen.<eos> Look, I know you're frustrated.<eos> No, you don't know, about me, how I feel.<eos> You treat me like I'm some fucking puzzle to be solved.<eos> - I don't.
No, but I don't need it.<eos> Shane looks out for me. You know, a roof over me head, it's dry, plenty to eat and the yard is safe, like.<eos> He treats you like a dog.<eos> A dog.<eos> And you're saying thank you.<eos> He looks after me.<eos> Do you know this man, Kieran Reilly?<eos> He's also been living rough.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't, no.
Making Mercy's story that he tried to rob the place seems almost plausible.<eos> Ajamu's our key witness here.<eos> He must have heard something.<eos> Big friendly dimwit is only gonna say what he's told to.<eos> - He needs social services.<eos> - He won't have them.<eos> "Shane looks after me." Shane's his problem. If we could get him to talk... If we push him now,<eos> Shane's toy solicitor is only gonna scream "undue pressure".<eos> Let's wait and see, and if Kieran wakes up, there's your witness.<eos> What if he doesn't?
You told me.<eos> - How is he?<eos> When Shane brought Kieran back, was he angry?<eos> Raging. I'd never seen him like that before, you know.<eos> It was frightening, you know.<eos> He got Kieran like this by the throat and then he threw him down, and he didn't hurt him, not so much.<eos> A bit, yeah, but it was me that kicked him. I did it, and I knew I'd hurt him badly. But I just thought that if... if he was out, he could go to the hospital or something, get help.<eos> So I helped him over the wall, but I didn't wanna kick him.<eos> I know you didn't.<eos> So why did you?
You have to get us in there so we can try and stop him.<eos> Only if I can have the ring when we do.<eos> Look at you... in your peasant's tunic.<eos> You're no son of a King.<eos> Take him the ring!<eos> He'll know if what I say is true.<eos> Who is your mother?<eos> Aethra from Troezen.<eos> How do you know my mother, Medea?<eos> I don't.
They struck a deal with Tresidder's Mill.<eos> For now, they have enough copper to keep going, but come the next auction...<eos> We'll see they come away empty-handed.<eos> And the question is, will that be enough to ruin them?<eos> What more can we do, since they deliberately withhold the names of their shareholders?<eos> There's no law against that.<eos> It makes it considerably more difficult for us to exert pressure.<eos> So... let's begin with the one name we DO know.<eos> Jonathan Tresidder.<eos> ~ Banks with us, does he not?
Get it started, get it over with.<eos> - Hey. Good morning.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Wow.<eos> It's fusilli with spicy sausage and cherry tomatoes and homemade linzer cookies.<eos> But if you prefer gingersnaps, I baked those, too.<eos> Wow.<eos> That is the single most gourmet lunch to ever going be consumed underneath a freeway overpass.<eos> Do we need to get going?<eos> - Uh... oh, yes. We do.
She dated a boy in college who came out of the closet and broke her heart.<eos> And now this one sleeps with her husband.<eos> No. She slept with him.<eos> So she was a lesbian.<eos> Her husband didn't know anything about it, and she'd like to keep it that way.<eos> She only told me because I'm a minister.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer. And, no, she didn't.
What are you doing here?<eos> Confession.<eos> Tuesdays, Thursdays, Sunday afternoons.<eos> I came here to see you.<eos> Julie thinks you're out drinking.<eos> Don't worry, I won't tell her.<eos> Ruin your legend.<eos> With all due respect to my surroundings, fuck you.<eos> I thought you didn't believe in God.<eos> I don't.
The next morning, sober, he can't believe he's killed the only thing that mattered to him. His one chance at a good life.<eos> So, grief-stricken, he carries her up to the marital bed...<eos> Jeez.<eos> ... And tries to "love" her back to life.<eos> It was 7 days before I went looking for him.<eos> He's sick.<eos> Yes, he is.<eos> As far as I'm aware, it hasn't happened since.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- That's why you're here.<eos> You tried to refuse the gift.<eos> Sadly, the only way out of here now is if you reach the gift first.<eos> It's him or you.<eos> Please, Khlyen.<eos> I don't want to kill him!<eos> From where I'm standing, little bird, it doesn't look like you can.<eos> I thought you were special.<eos> I thought you wanted to make me proud.<eos> - I do.
"Why" is a question my little bird must never ask.<eos> Open.<eos> Vena's mother says thank you, via a hefty a bonus.<eos> Warrant fee and tip, minus the Rack's 10% skim on all gratuities, and minus the outstanding bill for damages on Qresh...<eos> and we're flush.<eos> - Finally!<eos> - So let me ask you this...<eos> Yes, take a week off.<eos> You earned it.<eos> We all did.
Maybe not, but you wanted me to say it.<eos> You don't know what I want.<eos> Don't I?<eos> No. OK, I don't know what is going on here, if... if I am totally losing my mind, or if one of the gods or goddesses is angry with me and has sent a demon.<eos> A dangerous pervert demon who never seems to have any clothes on.<eos> - Germans are not so uptight about nudity. - Mm.<eos> This is not about nudity, OK? This is... This is about decency.<eos> It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.
full of so much joy and mischief.<eos> I loved her.<eos> But we did not have any food.<eos> Our mother was unable to produce any milk.<eos> If we did not give her to the nuns, she would have died.<eos> Saying goodbye was the...<eos> hardest thing I've ever done.<eos> I never saw her again.<eos> I cried as if she had died.<eos> In a way, she did.
Now.<eos> Choose your attendants.<eos> Clarke, you don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> If this truce doesn't hold, I killed Finn for nothing.<eos> Clarke is right.<eos> We need to do this.<eos> Peace with the Grounders is the only way we'll survive.<eos> Oh, I don't think they know what peace is.<eos> The commander does.
Hey, where's Mom?<eos> She's out back.<eos> I thought we had an understanding.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I watch your back.<eos> You watch my back.<eos> Are you mad at me for some reason?<eos> How about you lied to me?<eos> About the will.<eos> - No, I didn't. No, I didn't. - Yeah.
Jack, the thing is affordable housing is for people who can afford to rent.<eos> So it's not the same thing.<eos> It's the same. It drops down property values, it brings in the bad element.<eos> It's just I don't agree with you, okay?<eos> They said you went to the other side.<eos> I didn't believe them. You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> You really think it could make a difference?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Give it here. Here.<eos> - No, I'm telling!<eos> Excuse me, please. Sorry.<eos> Cemetery's closed 5:30.<eos> Oh, you're the mayor!<eos> On TV I saw you.<eos> I'm leaving in just a few moments.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ I don't need your answered prayers... ♪ _<eos> How you doing, Mary?
You too.<eos> Well, I guess I better be getting back.<eos> Well, let me fix Tawney a plate.<eos> Sure. Why not?<eos> Maybe she's got her appetite back.<eos> Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> Sure, Ted.<eos> You know where my wife is?<eos> I don't, Ted.<eos> But you did, didn't you?
Honestly, I just felt relief.<eos> You weren't even surprised by the confession of the rape?<eos> Later, i-i thought about it, and I...<eos> I just tried to...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Just forget.<eos> Can we circle back?<eos> When trey came by your house that morning...<eos> Did you know that Hanna was dead?<eos> I did not.
Help manage.<eos> And I'm a phone call away, always.<eos> And, speaking of money...<eos> Here is your checkbook.<eos> And... your ATM card.<eos> Your code is Amantha's birthday.<eos> I don't think anyone here knows who Amantha is, Mother.<eos> You remember?<eos> 08-11.<eos> You do.
- A rube?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Like you.<eos> How are you guys doing, anyway?<eos> You and old Johnny Stern?<eos> We're not... doing.<eos> Damn, is something in the water around here?<eos> Something in the something.<eos> Um, you want the rest of the mu shu pork?<eos> Yeah, if you don't.
- Pick one. Pick one you want.<eos> - You having fun?<eos> - No.<eos> You ever handle a real firearm before?<eos> Gives you a sense of power.<eos> Um, you guys are ruining my rehearsal.<eos> Come on, y'all.<eos> I got to get up out of here, man.<eos> All right, we out.<eos> We didn't...
It could have been a neighbor that killed Tom?<eos> Well...<eos> The press know even less than the police do.<eos> They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
And who will suffer?<eos> My kids, my reputation.<eos> Guilty whether you did it or not.<eos> Yeah, well, that's why I'm going to court... fight the good fight.<eos> Look, you should go to the press, set the record straight.<eos> The press don't want the truth.<eos> They want a good story.<eos> Then give them yours.<eos> No one knows you're innocent until you tell them.<eos> The police do.
Uh, b-but, um, there's a problem with a patient.<eos> And, um, brick, i really need to consult with you.<eos> Sorry... But if there's any leftover roast, I am eating for two.<eos> What is going on?<eos> Alice came by.<eos> What?<eos> ! I don't think that she'll come to the house.<eos> But i think she wants to make amends.<eos> Not that she deserves forgiveness.<eos> Because she doesn't.
Your father took it very seriously.<eos> He asked you how to play.<eos> You said, "We each get five cards."<eos> You dealt them out, then you pointed to the far end of the yard and you said, now...<eos> "Whoever gets to the tree first, wins."<eos> You dropped your cards and were halfway there before anyone else realized what was happening.<eos> I've never seen your father more proud.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.<eos> And now I do.
Relax.<eos> This play is 500 years old.<eos> I didn't write it, you know?<eos> No, it's not your fault.<eos> If an actress has to kiss, she will.<eos> I get it.<eos> For you, kissing other guys means nothing.<eos> The kettle calling the pot black...<eos> Do you have a part for me?<eos> - Actually, I do...
Thank you.<eos> I love your way of being.<eos> A Lady who likes the simple things yet overflows with elegance.<eos> And I love the way you speak.<eos> It's out of an ancient movie.<eos> - When you say ancient...<eos> - I wasn't calling you old.<eos> I think you're quite young for your age.<eos> - You know my age?<eos> - Everyone does.

What, what you think she did this?<eos> Kenzi. You saw the blue light.<eos> We all did.
That's different from just being a Power, you know?<eos> Are you sure there's nothing in there that'll hurt him?<eos> I had to turn in Brian's back up piece and all that stuff.<eos> I mean, like, a phone with names, numbers, pictures of Brian's girls.<eos> I took care of it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You okay?<eos> I tried to call.<eos> I didn't want to talk.<eos> But you didn't...
Bent you. Twisted you. And trimmed you.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
I'm vague on those details.<eos> Betrayal and forgiveness are best seen as something akin to falling in love.<eos> You cannot control with respect to whom you fall in love.<eos> You are going to be caught.<eos> It has already been set into motion.<eos> Is that concern for your patient or concern for yourself?<eos> I'm not concerned about me.<eos> I know exactly how I will navigate my way out of whatever it is I've gotten myself into.<eos> Do you?<eos> I did.
And that's how you'll find him.<eos> - Oh?<eos> - The wine, the truffles...<eos> Taste in all things will be a constant between Dr. Lecter's lives.<eos> His name will change, but his taste will not.<eos> Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't.<eos> And if they don't...

One minute.<eos> That's the window.<eos> Small window.<eos> Why don't we just take out the backup generator, too?<eos> Bellamy's inside.<eos> Have him do it.<eos> Leaving them without power that long would kill them all, and as I said, that's not the mission.<eos> Besides, we lost contact with Bellamy.<eos> What?<eos> We did?
- I'll come with you.<eos> - No. No.<eos> I don't want Ray thinking that we are acting as a team.<eos> Now, when your husband comes back, you are gonna talk and you're gonna fix things.<eos> Yeah?<eos> She's at Mickey's.<eos> Terry went to go pick her up.<eos> I'll meet him there.<eos> You didn't have to be so hard on him.<eos> He didn't do anything wrong.
It was nice meeting you.<eos> Yeah, it was nice meeting you.<eos> What is that on your hands and your coveralls?<eos> What would you call that?<eos> Is that oil?<eos> Is that grease?<eos> Down at the shop, we just call it grime.<eos> Grime.<eos> Look, I know why you asked me down here.<eos> Oh, you do? Oh. Oh, dear.

Make it quick.<eos> I'm busy.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Um, well, I understand you don't want me at your wedding and of course that is your prerogative, but for the record, I would just like to say that I'm very hurt by that.<eos> And I fully realize that, over the years, uh, you and I have had a few minor... differences.<eos> But weddings are the time to put all those differences aside.<eos> That's a steaming load of crap. I want to be surrounded by the people who love me and the people that I love.<eos> The only person that you know how to love is yourself.<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
YOU'RE OVER-STOCKING.<eos> THAT IS WAY TOO MUCH TOILET PAPER.<eos> NO ONE IS GOING TO GO TO THE BATHROOM THAT MUCH.<eos> UM, YOU KNOW, I'LL TAKE ROOMS 403 TO 408.<eos> WELL, ALL RIGHT.<eos> ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BE FINE ON YOUR OWN?<eos> I THINK I CAN CLEAN PUBES OFF SOAP BY MYSELF.<eos> THANK YOU.<eos> HEY, DID YOU GET THAT PICTURE I SENT YOU?<eos> YES, I DID.

The seminar. I thought about it, and I think I should.<eos> I'm so happy. - So happy.<eos> - What seminar?<eos> It's called lifespring.<eos> I did it last year in mankato.<eos> - Amazing.<eos> - Oh. Yeah, and I just, you know, I want to be the best me I can be, ya know?<eos> Constance: Good for you.<eos> What did ed say when you asked him?<eos> You didn't, did you?
And he wakes up every day and he starts pushing.<eos> By which, I guess I'm saying, it doesn't matter what they throw at me,<eos> These boys aren't gonna rest until you're dead, son.<eos> Possibly Peggy, too.<eos> I want a lawyer.<eos> Lou, I need one.<eos> I'm asking you for one.<eos> Ed, that's not...<eos> No, I've seen the shows on TV.<eos> No, you don't...
And now we're lowering our price by two million.<eos> Anything other than unconditional surrender and we'll wipe every last Gerhardt off the face of the earth.<eos> My father was a salesman.<eos> Ladies' shoes.<eos> It's fair to say, during the Depression, that he struggled.<eos> Like a lot of people on the Rock River, in Dixon, Illinois.<eos> But I've never been one to focus on life's downs.<eos> I was a lifeguard in high school.<eos> And where some saw a drowning man, I saw a life to save.<eos> Which I did 77 times in five years.
Whatever comes, we'll deal with it, or it'll deal with us.<eos> But I'm buyin' the shop and we're startin' a family.<eos> But how?<eos> It's too late to get the money back for the course.<eos> And you said Bud had to have it by Friday.<eos> We'll figure it out.<eos> That's what people do.<eos> They figure things out, stay together, make it work.<eos> I can help.<eos> Do your chores, kid.
All right.<eos> I never thought I'd say this, but if we are gonna cover all our bases, we need an astrologer.<eos> Oh.<eos> Sorry. Trying not to wake you.<eos> Oh, it's okay.<eos> Uh, I've been up since 4:00.<eos> Sleeping in one of these interview rooms - isn't all that relaxing. - [Chuckles]<eos> Uh, you know, I don't believe in past lives or ghosts or astrology, but this room... it, um, has a weird energy in it.<eos> Sitting in that chair, a person's whole future can change.<eos> Mine did, a long time ago.
Tell me everything about this new group you're working with.<eos> What new group?<eos> You know.<eos> Your drinking buddies from the bar.<eos> I want to know their names, how you met, your mission.<eos> Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with El Jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I do.
Ah, look at me.<eos> My first international summit, and I am a nervous wreck.<eos> Have we done the right thing coming here?<eos> Wanting a better life for your people is always the right thing.<eos> You know what I'm up against, Helen.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
Lena?<eos> Come here a minute.<eos> I know it's awfully difficult at the beginning.<eos> Everyone struggles at first, but it's just a test.<eos> And you're doing very well, I must say.<eos> Honestly.<eos> Thank you, Aunt Gisela.<eos> I like you, Lena, and the others like you, too.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, they do.
I'll handle the rest.<eos> Oh, nothing says manly like buying a matching tea set.<eos> The good news is this guy who's coming, he's dialed into witch business like you wouldn't believe.<eos> If anyone can tell us about you, it's him.<eos> While we're waiting, how about that explanation?<eos> Fine.<eos> Yes, I asked my brothers not to tell you I was back.<eos> I didn't want to see you after all this time when I wasn't myself, not like this, and perhaps, I feared that I might be desperate to kiss you, which I clearly can't do whilst occupying someone else's lips.<eos> Did you?<eos> Did I what?
Candor.<eos> Candor.<eos> Is everything always 10 steps ahead of the game with you?<eos> Well, often, victory is allowing your opponent to believe that they are triumphant till they're not.<eos> Ok. Just remember who sealed the deal.<eos> Credit where credit's due.<eos> I told you you needed a woman to mess things up for you.<eos> You never told me if you like me in this dress.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
But I don't see how we can do that if she is still to believe that her brother is a reformed playboy and failed businessman.<eos> John: Oliver, I told you before, if Thea finds out you've been lying to her all this time, you will lose her...forever.<eos> Oliver:<eos> How's Tatsu? She'll be better when we're far away from here.<eos> Your bow. If you want anything else, take it quickly.<eos> We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Everything all right?<eos> 'Cause you got that crease between your eyebrows that tells me things most definitely are not.<eos> Something awful has happened.<eos> And I-- I need a favor.<eos> A really big favor.<eos> Last time you asked me for a big favor, I had to loan you my helicopter.<eos> Don't need your helicopter.<eos> I need your jet.<eos> Well, Oliver does, but both of us.
Where are we going to fly to?<eos> Ollie, I don't understand.<eos> Malcolm is going to take you home.<eos> Aren't you coming with?<eos> Not now.<eos> You go on, I'll catch up.<eos> I love you, Thea.<eos> Don't ever forget that, ok?<eos> Oliver, I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
I didn't know what I was doing, ok?<eos> It wasn't me.<eos> I'm so sorry, Laurel.<eos> If Merlyn drugged you... then it wasn't your fault.<eos> But how could you work with him?<eos> How could you stand by his side?<eos> Because of the threat of the League.<eos> We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
Of course you feel--<eos> Is that what you think this is all about?<eos> Almost dying?<eos> Because I'd rather have died than have my brother sacrifice his life for mine.<eos> And don't think for a second that I forgot the whole reason Ra's al Ghul was brought into our lives is because of you.<eos> You're no longer in danger from the League.<eos> Maybe getting away from Starling City for a while is--is what's best for you.<eos> You approve?<eos> Is that supposed to worry me?<eos> 'Cause it actually kind of does.
Many a bride has skipped a meal or two before their wedding day.<eos> I would rather die than wed this pretender.<eos> Well, you speak as though they are the only two options before you, my daughter.<eos> Daughter.<eos> And to think, I once wore that title with pride.<eos> Perhaps "mother" will suit you better.<eos> After your betrothal to Al Sah-him, you will extend my lineage by having a child of your own.<eos> If you think I will bear his child--<eos> Yes!<eos> I do.
- I'm working on it.<eos> - You look ok.<eos> Are you ok? I'm fine.<eos> Not even a scratch.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> How did you get him back?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, you didn't kill him.<eos> No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.<eos> And I still do. Thea...
This isn't the first time he's been judge, jury and executioner.<eos> He hasn't killed anyone in nearly two years.<eos> That really is not your best argument.<eos> You have no idea what he's been through!<eos> I know him better than almost... anyone.<eos> Oliver didn't do this.<eos> You have feelings for him.<eos> Yes.<eos> I mean...<eos> No! I did.
Call your black bitch! Go see her, now!<eos> Not tomorrow, not next week, but now.<eos> - No.<eos> I'll kill you if you don't do it.<eos> See what I'm gonna do?<eos> Who is it?<eos> Show me.<eos> Get a move on!<eos> Pick up.<eos> Do it now!
I know.<eos> Hey...<eos> Visitations.<eos> He didn't just let her rot...<eos> Looks like he took care of her.<eos> And her response is positive.<eos> Calm.<eos> There's another visitor.<eos> I thought you said that you didn't know she was there.<eos> I didn't.
filled with shock and outrage that my boyfriend is paying another woman for sex.<eos> But I have a relationship with her, as well.<eos> I sent her flowers.<eos> Why?<eos> Am I a lesbian?<eos> Did you want a lawyer?<eos> - Want us to call one of your bosses?<eos> - No!<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I don't...
Go. Go.<eos> Wait.<eos> Go back.<eos> There.<eos> How do you know?<eos> She's wearing that.<eos> Close to the time Larissa got bludgeoned.<eos> Placed at the scene.<eos> So we got her, right?<eos> Yeah. We do.
It's what time you're called to work... actors and crew.<eos> Call sheet.<eos> That's confusing.<eos> Anyway, according to the call sheet here,<eos> Novo, on the day he was killed, was "called" at, uh, 6:00 a.m.<eos> and then he was "wrapped" at 6:00... no, he was wrapped at 4:15 p.m.<eos> Which means when he drove back on the lot at 10:00 p.m.,<eos> - it wasn't to work.<eos> - No. You saw someone with him, didn't you?<eos> Right? You did, Bert.

She thought he was having an affair.<eos> - Was he?<eos> - It seemed like it.<eos> I mean, he was acting all kinds of shady ... sneaking around, lying about where he was going.<eos> Did you ever see him with another woman?<eos> I wish.<eos> Do you know the bonus I get for a money shot like that?<eos> Divorce attorneys love me.<eos> And the more naked, the better.<eos> I didn't.
Relax.<eos> I'll give you time to make it happen.<eos> I know you're worried.<eos> Killing a minor with an overdose doesn't happen every day.<eos> I didn't kill anyone.<eos> You have one day.<eos> I'll be back tomorrow.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you know why your father killed himself?<eos> No, I don't.
May I?<eos> I'm going home tomorrow.<eos> Why?<eos> You can stay as long as you like... at least until they kick me out.<eos> Who's going to kick you out?<eos> No, I just meant it... as a joke.<eos> I feel good here, with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Can I say something stupid?<eos> I do it all the time!
Lord, grant him eternal rest, and let Your perpetual light shine upon them...<eos> O God, creator and redeemer of all the faithful, grant the souls of the deceased universal remission of sins.<eos> Seba!<eos> I just want to know the name of the guy who was with you.<eos> What do you care?<eos> He wasn't involved in Dagger's death.<eos> I think he got Number 8 to get rid of a witness.<eos> He didn't call Number 8.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - I just do.
The DEA is gonna bring some guy in... and they're gonna flip him.<eos> Danny's gonna get caught up in it.<eos> When's that gonna happen?<eos> Couple days.<eos> How are you doing with all of this?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> I just want him out of my life.<eos> He did this to himself.<eos> Don't feel sorry for him.<eos> Oh, I don't.
Dude gets loose.<eos> All he's got to do is roll on out of here.<eos> Can't even keep himself clean that long.<eos> Brothers, man, they always bitch...<eos> How a brother can't get a break.<eos> They let his ass go, cuts a dude, O.D.s his girl.<eos> I didn't do nothing, but I'm the one still stuck in here.<eos> Prosecutors want to talk to you.<eos> Hell, yeah, they want to talk to me.<eos> Now they do.
The money you owe me, you're lucky I even showed up today.<eos> Um, excuse me, how much are we talking about here?<eos> Stay out of this, Eddie, please.<eos> Jackie's 5,000 in arrears with another 10 due tomorrow to keep me on retainer.<eos> Attorney-client privilege?<eos> If I don't get that money by tomorrow, you'll need a new attorney for your nursing license hearing.<eos> Maybe your boyfriend here can help.<eos> Wow, I... hey. Everything I have is yours, you know this.<eos> I know, but you don't have a job, Eddie.<eos> Yeah, well, you barely do either.
- It's a working spacecraft, which I ...<eos> - I didn't come here for the comics, Chip.<eos> Oh.<eos> Is this about the parking?<eos> I talked with the angry-bear guy, Korsak.<eos> You've been leaking information to the press about active murder investigations, which could compromise those investigations.<eos> I haven't leaked anything.<eos> You sent e-mails from your work computer.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Yes, I did.
Cas, where are you?<eos> Pretty sure that's something those girls will not soon forget.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I'm pretty sure that's something the boyfriend won't forget either.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Paper never wins.<eos> Calm down, fella.<eos> No one knows what really went on.<eos> That puke had a threesome with my Kitty Kat.<eos> Well, so you do then.
First off, I want to say Jake Marshall was a great player and a key member of our team.<eos> But I have faith that we're going to pull together and play a great game of football today.<eos> How do you feel about the recent arrest of Derek Finley in conjunction with Jake Marshall's murder?<eos> Um, what?<eos> Well, do you feel you could've been a target too or?<eos> Why?<eos> He... he didn't.<eos> Well, police found evidence in Derek's locker.<eos> Did you ever feel threatened?<eos> Did you...
No, I was looking for you.<eos> Sometimes it feels that's all I do.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> You chose me first for a reason.<eos> Everything we've gone through, everything we've sacrificed... that was love.<eos> And it's still there.<eos> It doesn't go away.<eos> No, it doesn't.<eos> But it changes.<eos> It does.
Another awesome guy will find his way to you.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And the next awesome person<eos> - doesn't have to show up for a while.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Do you wanna hear my revelation about you?<eos> No, I-I got my own.<eos> - You did?<eos> - Okay, you can wipe the surprised look off your face.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Ugh! You think that's nasty, you should try the kiwi.<eos> Jackie, I seriously hope you were not administering care to a patient at this hospital.<eos> Gloria, they were short a nurse.<eos> I made it very clear you were not to touch any patient.<eos> If I did not touch that patient, she would be dead.<eos> - Is that what you want? - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
Turning you Fae...<eos> It could kill you.<eos> Instantly.<eos> What?<eos> No I...<eos> You can't fix me?<eos> It's just that with other diseases,<eos> I know what I'm dealing with.<eos> But with this...<eos> I don't.
You're right, I can't fake it.<eos> I know a fraud when I see one.<eos> And buddy, you're it.<eos> So, if you try to go after my friends, just know you'll have to go through me first.<eos> Too bad you're stuck in here.<eos> Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
Well we're born alone and we die alone.<eos> That's pretty heartless.<eos> Heart is overrated.<eos> Or maybe you just say that 'cause somebody broke yours.<eos> How did you know that?<eos> Let's just say I'm really good at reading people.<eos> Look, the point is... if this Maestro is so great maybe he can help you too.<eos> I'm okay, I'm fine.<eos> How did you know I don't like being alone?<eos> Because nobody does, not all the time.
Do I have drool face?<eos> I slept on the plane.<eos> Don't move.<eos> I know I had this subterranean death moth on my back.<eos> But, god, did she have to hit me so hard?<eos> I still don't get how you knew to come home now.<eos> Dude, snail mail?<eos> I assumed it was from you.<eos> What?<eos> I didn't...
You've always had my back.<eos> Since day one.<eos> And I will always have your back.<eos> You understand?<eos> People think I got two brothers.<eos> They're fucking wrong.<eos> Why are the lights off?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> I don't.
The business will never recover.<eos> - We didn't fucking do anything.<eos> - It doesn't matter.<eos> There's no way to keep it out of the news.<eos> Mom is gonna be devastated.<eos> It's gonna ruin our name. It's gonna ruin our reputation.<eos> Everything Mom and Dad ever worked for their whole lives is gonna be gone.<eos> - John, we cannot report this.<eos> - We don't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, we do.
Don't want you keeling over after you take this.<eos> Peyote?<eos> Raul says you're stuck in your head and this is one of the best ways to get out.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> You're, uh, not going alone.<eos> I gotta sit this one out, Coach.<eos> You know better than that.<eos> The bigger the tribe, the easier it is to call on the spirits.<eos> How do I know this'll work?<eos> You don't.
No kidding.<eos> All right, what do we know about ABADDON?<eos> Aren't they some kind of anarchist hacker group?<eos> All about bringing down the system?<eos> I don't know, but if what they're plotting is the sin that breaks the next Horseman's seal...<eos> Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
I mean, she's an outsider.<eos> Nadia's father died... we had no choice.<eos> But to be honest, I worry about her.<eos> If you share what we're doing with Alan, you could put him in the same kind of danger.<eos> And this scar... is from when I wrestled a polar bear.<eos> Okay, you two, it's time for bed.<eos> But Raul was telling me about his scars.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.
I know, but not through the lives of their patients.<eos> I watched my mother... suffer and die so that some insurance company could increase its profit margin.<eos> I know.<eos> I was abandoned once.<eos> Cast aside by those who should've cared, but I stood up and fought back.<eos> And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're a son who lost his mother.<eos> I'm a mother who lost her son.<eos> I know.<eos> They deserve to suffer just like your mother did.<eos> No, they don't!
- Where the fulgurite came from.<eos> I found something in the desert in Mali, something beyond incredible.<eos> I... It may be the key to understanding Drill.<eos> I mean...<eos> It may... It may explain everything, Claire.<eos> You...<eos> - You don't seem to be...<eos> - Because I knew.<eos> Sean... he told me that he felt something.<eos> Oh, of course he did.
Never having been in battle, do you think it puts you behind the 8-ball when it comes to running this operation?<eos> I think if it wasn't for the work I've done, you wouldn't know there was a battle, sir.<eos> Well, I really, uh...<eos> I really just - wanted to congratulate you.<eos> Uh, when I first moved up the ranks, one of the hardest things for me to learn was how to delegate.<eos> It seems you're way ahead of the curve.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Well, allowing Claire Bennigan to gather those children, ask them questions about Africa, about Drill.<eos> Oh, I, uh...<eos> You didn't...?
It's her number!<eos> At the same exact time Sara reaches in to her purse to pay for a drink and pulls out the $5 bill with Jonathan's number on it.<eos> Destiny.<eos> They meet up again in central park and they kiss, just as that same little snowflake drifts gently down from heaven.<eos> Naw, bullshit.<eos> That is bullshit.<eos> No goddamn way that's the same snowflake!<eos> Respectfully, yes it was.<eos> So wait, you think like five winters ago, a snowflake fell to the ground, and, like, melted, then evaporated and shit, went back up to the sky, then turned back into the same exact snowflake, flew back down to earth at, like, the exact moment that that dude kissed that chick?<eos> Yes, I do.
What?<eos> Sorry, Brian.<eos> It's sweet, it really is, but there's no such thing as serendipity or destiny.<eos> What, you don't believe that is was serendipity that you met Johnny?<eos> No.<eos> Not really, I mean...<eos> Obviously I love him, but it's not destiny that we met.<eos> I think it was.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> - I do.
This serendipity stuff has got me thinking.<eos> - Oh, don't do that, sweetie.<eos> - It's like...<eos> It's like everything that happens in life affects every other thing in life.<eos> I mean, if we didn't make the light back there, where would we be right now?<eos> - At the light.<eos> - Maybe!<eos> But you don't know that!<eos> - Well, yeah, actually I do.<eos> - Or... or you don't.
- You have.<eos> - Where?<eos> Show me?<eos> Your printers abroad, they're very good.<eos> They're working for me now.<eos> In June last year, just after the Queen was crowned, your son Lord Montague and your son Geoffrey Pole dined with Lady Mary.<eos> Two weeks later, they dined with her again.<eos> I wonder what they discussed?<eos> I'm sure you do.<eos> Actually, no, I don't.
Our son, Richard, telling us that she was in a coma.<eos> We had to hurry.<eos> And then my sister, Miriam, she's got this clock, which hasn't worked for years.<eos> Why she keeps it only God knows.<eos> Erm, anyway, it started working right after... ..right after Janet's accident it started working again until<eos> 4.20.<eos> 4.20 was the time of Janet's death.<eos> Oh, tell him about the day of the funeral.<eos> Oh, he doesn't want to know about this.<eos> I do.
Go ahead.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Do not come out until you finish your homework.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Damn, Shawn, you sweating like you was balling for real.<eos> You know I had to school Riq a little bit.<eos> I used to hoop at St. John's before I blew out my knee.<eos> I didn't even know you went to college.<eos> Okay, well, I did.
Get a prescription and you can have a refill.<eos> - When did you fall in love with yours?<eos> - There's no falling. Just being.<eos> He comes out, they hand him to me, everything changes.<eos> Before Yevgeny, I was selfish.<eos> Now I would die before I let him die.<eos> It's simple. Complete.<eos> I never made that change.<eos> Kev did, I didn't.<eos> Some do, some don't.
What, Ian?<eos> Carl!<eos> - Sammi says Carl put drugs on Chuckie.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Carl, if you did that, then you...<eos> It's not a question of if.<eos> There is no way Chuckie was smuggling heroin by himself. - Heroin?<eos> - What's the fuck's the matter with you?<eos> Carl, you have to do the right thing and tell the cops it was you.<eos> - No, I don't.
Yeah, we should get back to work.<eos> Yeah, he liked it here.<eos> One of them older guys, never left the bar, just wait for the girl to walk up.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know anyone he ever left with?<eos> Uh, a few of the girls here for sure, but I wouldn't try talking to them. You'd just get them into trouble.<eos> - He like boys?<eos> - More like he likes to watch.<eos> Had me and this girl go at it while he sat in the corner.<eos> You do girls.
Wherever the Caspere case goes, we need you running point. Control the sprawl. Control the flow of information.<eos> Dixon is secondary to you staging out of Vinci.<eos> You'll be working under a Ventura detective commanding the task force.<eos> That clear to you, Detective?<eos> 10-4, Lieutenant.<eos> Just one question.<eos> Am I supposed to solve this or not?<eos> Just no surprises, Detective Velcoro.<eos> Ray accepts dualities must be effected to serve public interests.<eos> I really do.
Been listening to them for so fucking long that I don't even know who the fuck I am.<eos> You're a survivor.<eos> Everything else is just dust in your eyes. Blink it away, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll get your stuff.<eos> Take it to another hotel, all right?<eos> I just don't know how to be out in the world, man.<eos> Hey, look out that window.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Nobody does.
Weren't you on the pill?<eos> It's not 100%.<eos> Look, you didn't want this.<eos> But I don't believe in abortion.<eos> I'm keeping it, Paul.<eos> I want you to.<eos> And I think we should get married.<eos> I don't want you to do this because you think it's the right thing or something.<eos> I'm not.<eos> I don't.
Three times maximum.<eos> I wasn't the only one!<eos> We lost touch, then she called to say I was her son's dad.<eos> I made things quite clear then.<eos> I'm amazed that it's come back to haunt me, 20 years later!<eos> Why did she say it then?<eos> What part of it do you not understand?<eos> Your life doesn't interest me.<eos> - I want the baby to have a dad.<eos> - But he doesn't!
I'd prefer to go alone. Really.<eos> But I want to be there at every stage, to be sure it's done properly, and that you...<eos> "Sure it's done properly"?<eos> Gabrielle.<eos> Gabrielle!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Is it the baby?<eos> - Don't you want it?<eos> - Of course I do.
A friend.<eos> - Take your time, think about it.<eos> - No!<eos> It's alright.<eos> It's OK by me.<eos> Fancy a drink?<eos> Yes.<eos> - Put on your trousers.<eos> - They itch.<eos> No they don't.
Love is guided by the heart, wisdom by the head.<eos> One day you will see which rules the other.<eos> I already have.<eos> Shh.<eos> This way.<eos> And keep your voice down.<eos> No one must see us leaving the palace.<eos> What's wrong, Majesty?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course I do.
Stage it up the road. Okay.<eos> - Hey, what was that gonzo shit, man?<eos> - So in a tournament,<eos> I snap his arm or he taps out and we all go get burgers.<eos> - Snap it.<eos> - Come on.<eos> Look, we've got the gun.<eos> Why don't we just let him... Wait, wait. I don't want it.<eos> All right?<eos> I don't...
You expect me to say thank you?<eos> If I didn't need you alive, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> So you just stand there and let me die, huh?<eos> But you couldn't kill me yourself.<eos> Is that where you draw the line?<eos> Tell me what I want to know about Fisk.<eos> You think you're different... from me?<eos> From him?<eos> But you'll get there.<eos> Sooner or later... we all do, men like us.
But we both can't have what we want.<eos> So... your part... in this drama, by necessity, comes to an end.<eos> It's gonna take a lot more than a voice on a radio to stop me.<eos> It's not me you need to worry about.<eos> It's the city you just blew the hell out of.<eos> You...<eos> You think anyone's gonna believe that?<eos> You're running around in a mask, holing up with a known felon in the wake of a series of bombings.<eos> There's that police officer you're holding hostage, so... yes.<eos> Actually, I do.
She told me you'd say that, too.<eos> I'm trying to protect you.<eos> You give Reina an inch, she'll take a mile.<eos> Zoila, you've always said that Reina is the bad sister.<eos> But what if it's the other way around?<eos> Gail...<eos> why did you tell Sandra that I'm running an escort service?<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You told her I was selling sex.<eos> No, I didn't.
Please give me one good reason I shouldn't fire you right this instant.<eos> Genevieve delatour made a sex tape.<eos> Ernesto.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Are we alone?<eos> Spence took miguel to a movie.<eos> What do we need to talk about?<eos> I saw the way you were looking at me today.<eos> You wanted me.<eos> No, i didn't.
I need you to release me.<eos> I understand.<eos> You feel guilty and it's breaking your heart.<eos> Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And that's why I'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, I do.
I love you.<eos> Sure.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Carmen?<eos> [Cellphone beeps]<eos> You have a boyfriend?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
[Clears throat]<eos> So much for the high road.<eos> ♪<eos> I'm so glad we're doing this.<eos> You know, maybe we can make this a regular thing.<eos> [Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
We had a big fight last night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I sort of heard.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Did we keep you awake again?<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> How are you?<eos> I'm so mad, I could spit.<eos> Did you hear what he was saying about us, that we're too close?<eos> I did, and...
None taken.<eos> I know how close you were, and I'm sorry she had to go.<eos> Well, it isn't your fault.<eos> You see, dear, Zoila and I had a certain rapport.<eos> She always gave me her brutally honest opinion.<eos> You want me to be more like her?<eos> Exactly.<eos> And it's a two-way street.<eos> You can tell me my dress is ugly, and I can tell you that I don't like your hairstyle.<eos> You don't?
You're right.<eos> I'll fix it. Oh, yes, you will, because if you lose Deion... you lose me.<eos> Well, honey, he can sleep in the guest room.<eos> Well, think fast, 'cause I have to get my son out of here.<eos> - (Beep)<eos> - Look. I know it seems crazy, but the Powells really do love Deion.<eos> Letting him stay here might be the best thing for him.<eos> Listen, lady.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Actually, I do.
I won't be here tomorrow.<eos> What? Are you trying to kill my buzz?<eos> You're my boss, and we don't have to be friends, but I do have to respect you, and I do not.<eos> (Dog barking) Wait a minute.<eos> What the hell?<eos> I rescued your neighbor's dog from the shelter.<eos> I also convinced her to adopt a Chihuahua.<eos> - (Chihuahua barking)<eos> - That's Penny. For a tiny dog, she's really loud.<eos> No, you didn't.
Now we can test the stain.<eos> I already did.<eos> You were right.<eos> It is blood, and I'm betting it's Louie Becker's.<eos> So then we have proof.<eos> Mrs. Taylor was involved with Louie's death.<eos> And Blanca's. I told you.<eos> There's no way Taylor's the one who killed them.<eos> But she knows who did.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Would that be okay, like, if they were to get hitched Or engaged or something?<eos> I would be honored To share my thunder with you, pal.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Congratulations, lavon.<eos> We are just so happy to here as invited guests.<eos> I resent that.<eos> Will you tell us The proposal story again?<eos> You don't want to hear that again.<eos> We done told it so many times.<eos> Aw, yes, we do! Please!
I mean, my life is in bluebell.<eos> Yours is in nashville.<eos> It's only been a couple of weeks and it's already too hard!<eos> It just doesn't matter, huh?<eos> It-it just, it-it doesn't matter that we-we want to be together?<eos> It doesn't matter that we have, like, we have great chemistry?<eos> It doesn't matter that i love you?<eos> Did you just say that you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
- You have a photo of the boy? - Yeah.<eos> The malar and the superciliary ridge formations are consistent.<eos> Meaning?<eos> I think this is your victim.<eos> DNA comparison with the sister should confirm it.<eos> You asked me before if I had faith.<eos> I remember.<eos> I told you I didn't.<eos> That wasn't the truth.<eos> I do.
But why? Because they are not eternal.<eos> What is eternal?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing is eternal.<eos> God is, perhaps, the only one who is eternal.<eos> What about the heart?<eos> No, the heart is not eternal.<eos> But doesn't God have a heart?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course He does.
- I hit him.<eos> - You hit him how?<eos> With your fist?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do that a lot, Mr. Delacroix?<eos> - What?<eos> Do what?<eos> - Your son, did you beat him a lot?<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't...
Where you going, Harry?<eos> Tell Sheila Delacroix her father just confessed to murdering her brother.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Miss Delacroix, your father described the events in detail.<eos> I'm sorry, but my father is not a violent man, detective.<eos> He never hit me or Arthur... never.<eos> Your mother says he hit her... hard and often.<eos> - That's why she left.<eos> - You spoke to my mother?<eos> We did, in fact, a couple of times.
You really didn't have to go to so much trouble.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> After you went so out of your way to be so sweet to me and Lucy?<eos> Plus, I love sushi, too.<eos> I mean, the rules, the rituals, the beauty of the presentation.<eos> Did you know that when you're not using your chopsticks, you should place them in front of you, parallel to the edge of the sushi bar with the narrow end in the hashi oki?<eos> That's what this cute little thing is called... hashi oki.<eos> I googled it.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> Well, now you do.
Joss has a friend, Karen, who's a psychiatrist, and I think she could refer someone.<eos> I don't need a psychiatrist, Calista.<eos> I need your support.<eos> I give you support.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You have no idea what it's like for me, the amount of pressure I'm under every single day.<eos> We're both under pressure.<eos> Can you at least try and understand what it's like for me?<eos> I want to help.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, my god!<eos> You're Vivian! It's...<eos> It's so nice to meet you.<eos> Mm. I wish that I could stay, but I...<eos> - You've got things. I know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> Totally get it, by the way.<eos> I like her.<eos> Everyone does.
You're probably right.<eos> He's probably bluffing. If he had that kind of evidence against you, don't you think he would've used it by now?<eos> Right?<eos> [Sighs] Maybe. Maybe.<eos> Probably. Yeah. So it's your word against his.<eos> I mean...<eos> Unless...<eos> You don't think that Wilson would testify against you?<eos> No, no, no. Wilson loves me.<eos> More than my husband ever did.
Do you sell these here?<eos> What?<eos> Hey, hey, hey. You're not... you're not supposed to be in tonight.<eos> Uh, this is true.<eos> You know.<eos> I do.<eos> [Groans] So, Niko...<eos> Is officially working at the SLS as of, uh, three hours ago.<eos> Ellis transferred her to one of his other restaurants.<eos> He did indeed.
But that is me.<eos> I have to take this.<eos> Do not move.<eos> I won't.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I actually have an interview with Mr. Boone for the new restaurant he's opening.<eos> Wow. Good for you.<eos> How's married life?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> Nope. I don't.
A one-time thing. It's not about you, Harry.<eos> She's overwhelmed.<eos> How -- how can I help?<eos> I want to help.<eos> I know you do, but you can't right now.<eos> You're only going to make her more upset.<eos> Well, I can't just sit here and do nothing.<eos> I'm taking care of her. I promise.<eos> So, you had a key to the house. Yes.<eos> But a lot of people did.
Hey, did you see the flowers in the kitchen?<eos> Blair got them for me.<eos> He's a good guy, don't you think?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You can't not know.<eos> You either like someone or you don't.<eos> All right.<eos> I don't like him.<eos> Is there a reason?<eos> I just don't.
I knew he was gonna marry her.<eos> And he did.<eos> Did -- did they have any, uh, problems in their marriage that you know of?<eos> No.<eos> Even though I didn't like her, he -- he loved her.<eos> He was happy.<eos> That's the thing -- the police said my son killed himself.<eos> Now, why would a happy man take his own life?<eos> - It makes no sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't.
And you're...<eos> Sure that it's, um...<eos> Yes. It's yours.<eos> Ours.<eos> Ours.<eos> Um, I thought you were...<eos> Aren't you on the pill?<eos> I was, but as it turns out, one in 11 women get pregnant while on the pill every year.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I certainly did not.
Oh. - Just do that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Oh, God, I just...<eos> Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened,<eos> I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know? - Yeah.<eos> You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
Do you hear yourself right now?<eos> I do.<eos> I just don't recognize the voice.<eos> Um, it's the voice of a woman who's completely in love with Marc.<eos> Oh, my... when did this happen?<eos> How did I miss this?<eos> How did I not see myself?<eos> !<eos> Oh, my God, I have to call him.<eos> Yes, you do... immediately!
Fantastic!<eos> Yeah, for sure.<eos> We don't have to if you don't want to.<eos> I mean, I could be fine just...<eos> Pfft. Of course I want to do butt stuff.<eos> In fact, I am so up for having another crazy night, I have prepared as well.<eos> Oh, look!<eos> You got a whole mess of cocaine.<eos> Oh, yeah. 'Cause you love cocaine, right?<eos> Yes, I do!
Thanks.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> You ready to send your first Tweet?<eos> Yes, I am, Mike.<eos> And you're sure you want to make it that profane?<eos> Abso-fucking-lutely.<eos> Bring the cursor up to the blue button and three, two, one, click it.<eos> Did you get it? Did you get it?<eos> !<eos> Yeah! The whole world did.
Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.<eos> Tell your parents, they have to let you stay.<eos> It's safe now.<eos> Emily, I have to go.<eos> Listen to me, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
The idea of O.J. just standing there, in front of the cameras and the jury, wearing those gloves...<eos> Chris, come on.<eos> We're going downstairs to get our conviction today.<eos> We have his gloves with all the DNA, everybody's blood, the fibers, all of it.<eos> We have a receipt that proves he owned them.<eos> We're done.<eos> We've been dealt a king and a ten.<eos> I don't know why you want to ask the dealer for another card.<eos> - Because I know it's an ace.<eos> - No, you don't!
It will never fit him!<eos> I think we should have him try it on in court.<eos> I think it's a terrible idea.<eos> What if it doesn't work?<eos> You don't make a play in there if you don't know the outcome.<eos> I know the outcome.<eos> My hand is bigger than Bob's!<eos> Put me in, Coach.<eos> So, saying we wanted to, how do we present it?<eos> We don't.
We gotta figure out what's wrong, we gotta figure out what's blocking it from the...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Look, Haven... is a cancer that I can't get out of me.<eos> Trust me, you don't want it.<eos> What the hell have you been forcing me to remember for?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know what?<eos> I think you do know.<eos> I don't think you're done with Haven.<eos> I don't.
I'm already ruined.<eos> I kidnapped Audrey Parker.<eos> The woman who exists to fight the Troubles.<eos> They won't forgive that.<eos> They'll execute me.<eos> I will protect you.<eos> I don't want your protection.<eos> I want your love.<eos> You must feel something for me.<eos> I do.
He and his wife both claim that you were already drawing your weapon before you identified yourself as a police officer.<eos> And given your whole... [scoffs]<eos> Well... it's somewhat understandable.<eos> Which brings us to your report, Detective.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Where is it?<eos> Gee, I submitted it.<eos> Didn't I?<eos> - Not yet, no.<eos> - I didn't?
What?<eos> Eyes up.<eos> You think you don't belong in here, maybe you don't.<eos> Describe him.<eos> Describe him.<eos> White male. Fair. Mid-30s.<eos> Facial hair, 6'3", 220.<eos> Which is exactly what I wrote down on my notebook when you described the shooter to me at the scene.<eos> - No, I told you...<eos> - Yes, you did!
He's trashing my life!<eos> Harassing my wife and child!<eos> Don't jump to conclusions.<eos> It's all connected, don't you see?<eos> - You piece of shit.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Calm down, that's enough.<eos> So Mr Moreau, you stand by your statement?<eos> Shouldn't I?<eos> Of course I do.
But how long do you think you can hold out?<eos> If you come down, we will make it quick.<eos> You have my word.<eos> All right then!<eos> Let's make it quick!<eos> We are here to establish the facts of the Queen's infidelity.<eos> You are accused of seducing the Queen at the convent in Bourbon-les-Eaux.<eos> And of fathering her child.<eos> Do you swear to give us the truth of this sordid encounter?<eos> I do.
Not really what I expected.<eos> You sure this one's to be trusted?<eos> She knows this one's to be trusted.<eos> No more games, Tobin.<eos> I'm just surprised Sifter let you keep the party going.<eos> Trust a black hat once, shame on them.<eos> Trust a black hat twice...<eos> How long do you think you can deny the thirst, Nelson?<eos> You have no idea how much money can be made selling the secrets at your fingertips.<eos> But I do.
There's a user going by the handle Justice.<eos> J-U-5-T-U-5.<eos> We think he may be the author of the code.<eos> I need you to gain access to the forums and...<eos> Avery.<eos> (sighs)<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> I know who wrote the code.<eos> (chuckles softly)<eos> I did.
Or he's playing us, and he's gonna disappear just like...<eos> Like Tobin?<eos> Black hats are hardwired to buck the system.<eos> Most can't be reformed.<eos> What do you want me to say, Elijah?<eos> I was wrong about Tobin.<eos> I will be wrong again.<eos> But I am not wrong about Nelson.<eos> I want you to be right, okay?<eos> I really do.
I...<eos> I'm afraid she will come to the house to talk.<eos> I don't know what will happen in the house.<eos> The Dragon may come down.<eos> I know how easily she would tear.<eos> I think about what the Dragon will do to me if I don't serve her up.<eos> She called me a man.<eos> A sweet... man.<eos> I didn't hear... Reba's heart.<eos> I... didn't!
You didn't just say good-bye, though, did you?<eos> That little extra bit at the end.<eos> What was that you said?<eos> You'd never have turned yourself in unless I rejected you. Yes.<eos> That extra bit.<eos> I believe that's what they call a "mic drop."<eos> You dropped the mic, Will, but here you are having to come back and pick it up again.<eos> I knew you would keep running if I kept chasing you.<eos> I knew you wanted me to know exactly where I could find you when I needed to.<eos> And you did.
So you know all about...<eos> I do.<eos> Didn't see that one coming.<eos> It's better than being crazy, isn't it?<eos> Well, I'm just a little...<eos> You know.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Now, you didn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no, of course not.<eos> Well, don't.
Yeah, of course.<eos> I didn't realize how tired I was.<eos> It's on.<eos> Nothing.<eos> It's been hours.<eos> Nick is doing everything he can.<eos> And where's Monroe?<eos> Why haven't they found him yet?<eos> Listen, I know this is difficult for you.<eos> No, you don't.
But, Miriam, he doesn't.<eos> It's acute at best and has, thankfully, been on the wane for a number of years.<eos> They don't need to know that!<eos> - That's quite enough!<eos> With all due respect, Erica, this is between me and Dr Campbell.<eos> Will has looked after your family for many years.<eos> He has great affection for you all, but you're asking him to commit a malpractice.<eos> He can't possibly do that.<eos> I sympathise.<eos> I really do.
He's different.<eos> About the same age as this kid, except he had a few live RPGs in his gut.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You want to know what he said to me?<eos> He said he was sorry for getting me in this mess.<eos> He was afraid of getting me killed.<eos> You must have been scared to death.<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom."<eos> You're lucky it didn't go off.<eos> No, no, it did. It did.
Yeah. Glad you're okay.<eos> You know, I've, uh, I've been where you are.<eos> I was a 5-star recruit, all-American,<eos> - 20-some-odd scholarships,<eos> - Man... I really don't want to hear about your stupid glory days right now.<eos> Now, that... that's true. That's true, my glory days.<eos> My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp.<eos> Never played a game.<eos> I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from.<eos> - I do.
To what?<eos> No, really.<eos> Adapt to what?<eos> Forget that I'll never be able to lead my troops into combat again.<eos> Forget that we'll never be able to climb Machu Picchu like we talked about.<eos> Forget that I'll never be able to build a house from the ground up.<eos> I can't even change a damn light bulb.<eos> Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?<eos> - I know it's hard.<eos> - No, you don't.
I don't either.<eos> So, you intubated Will.<eos> I did.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> He didn't want to suffer, okay?<eos> - He signed the DNR.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> - Three months ago.<eos> Who knows what he would have wanted today?<eos> Actually, I do.
I'm good at it.<eos> You're very good at it.<eos> And... I think I might want to pursue it.<eos> Finally.<eos> You have no idea how happy that makes me.<eos> I'll call Dr. Nelson at Hopkins and secure your spot.<eos> I didn't say "Hopkins."<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You said you want to go into surgery.<eos> And I do... but on my own terms.
If you pay for every drug that's not covered by insurance, you'll be broke in a week.<eos> Okay, then I'll... I'll worry about that next week.<eos> Paul, come on.<eos> Look, you have a big heart, and I like that about you.<eos> But we need to be realistic about what we can and cannot do, all right?<eos> All right, I will try and fast-track the paperwork on the medication, but it could still take a month.<eos> All right, so for now, add on an I.V. aminoglycoside.<eos> All right, that might work.<eos> Okay, but, uh, this sucks.<eos> Yeah, it does.
No, I spat on them Paul.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think there's a giant neon sign on this girl that says<eos> - mistakes were made during surgery.<eos> - Oh, a few weeks into your rotation, you're suddenly the expert on surgical mistakes.<eos> - You're not your dad.<eos> - Gee, thank you for the reminder.<eos> You know, maybe if you focused more on surgery a little bit more than Joey's ass,<eos> - this girl wouldn't be back in here.<eos> - You don't...
It's not a question of lying.<eos> It's protecting.<eos> They told me my mom died when I was little.<eos> Then later I found out she died having me.<eos> When my dad was sick, he said he'd be fine, and six months later, he was dead.<eos> Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying.<eos> That's not lying?<eos> Devin, I am so sorry.<eos> And I know that this must be...<eos> No, you don't.
- I don't know.<eos> - I haven't seen them.<eos> The last I saw, he was chasing after Riken.<eos> You should have killed me when you had the chance.<eos> I'm gonna kill you now.<eos> Like hell you are.<eos> We've got to find Monroe and Rosalee.<eos> There!<eos> Did anybody get away?<eos> Because Riken sure didn't.
- It's not for us to judge.<eos> - What else is there to do?<eos> - Do you recall the favor I asked?<eos> - Of course.<eos> The King asked for time alone in the chapel this afternoon.<eos> Perhaps today is a good day to thank God for our victory.<eos> Hmm, lucky me.<eos> To have a friend like you, the luck is all mine.<eos> - Cassel will come.<eos> - And if he does not, Sire?
And why's that?<eos> It'll look a little conspicuous where we're going next.<eos> I was analyzing the particulates that Clay Parker and Shawna Baez left behind, and I found something very interesting.<eos> When Clay's cells come into contact with Shawna's, they adopt her properties.<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Why would you ask that?<eos> You're doing that biting-your-lower-lip thing that you do when something's bothering you.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Cisco says I don't have a life.<eos> You don't, do you?
Now asthma's gone.<eos> My-my uncle...<eos> worst drunk you ever saw.<eos> Clean and sober, like poof.<eos> And beyond all that, everyone's acting weird.<eos> Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
What are you thinking?<eos> That I really want a drink.<eos> Well, it's good there's not a bar around.<eos> Oh, you think there's no options in here?<eos> You'd be amazed by the options.<eos> You don't need a drink, Sam.<eos> What you need... is to forgive yourself.<eos> I don't know if I can do that.<eos> Not if Joe can't forgive me.<eos> And what if he doesn't?
- Take it!<eos> - No!<eos> - Just take it!<eos> - No, not until you tell me what happened.<eos> Nothing happened. I... I just don't want to do this anymore.<eos> Okay, look, if you don't want to deal anymore, that's fine, but at least tell me what's going on.<eos> I'm getting back together with Griffin.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> Why? I love him.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Hawley: Your honor...<eos> Get control of your client, counselor.<eos> We need a recess. - I want to change my plea. - Again?<eos> This is dizzying, your honor.<eos> I plead guilty and confess to the murder of father Bernard.<eos> Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.<eos> Because you had your client cause one?<eos> No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea.<eos> Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> I do, too, your honor.
And you played Waitlist here like... like some loser.<eos> - Played all of us.<eos> - Why are you letting them do this?<eos> No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.<eos> - I didn't manipulate anyone!<eos> - But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't. Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?<eos> How should I freaking know?<eos> You do, though.
[Door opens]<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
You want to make this right?<eos> Be a man and go and get your girlfriend to talk.<eos> She doesn't trust me anymore.<eos> Then make her, damn it!<eos> Are you a man or not? !<eos> Sure he shouldn't take the trophy?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I still do.
Look at me.<eos> Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I still do.<eos> [Scoffs] I told you everything about me.<eos> Every awful thing anyone has ever done to me.<eos> But you know what?<eos> You're the worst one.<eos> 'Cause I didn't know I had to be afraid of you.<eos> You don't.
Have you seen my Billy Ocean t-shirt?<eos> What? !<eos> That's it!<eos> Feel free to remarry, and find the kids a good dad.<eos> Aah!<eos> Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe.<eos> We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not.
He is your father.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> Like now!<eos> Figure it out!<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's a big deal, you guys.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what he wants, either.<eos> You have no idea what your husband likes.<eos> Like you do.
- if we could actually show you...<eos> - Yo! Yo!<eos> Yo, party people! I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri, and it's time that we give a big shout-out to my man, Dre Johnson!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - What up, J.D.?<eos> Hey, give me a second, Zo-Zo, okay?<eos> Happy Birthday, Dre.<eos> Thanks, J.D.<eos> You know I danced for Whodini, right?<eos> Uh... Yes, I did.
I even skipped a boyfriend's birthday so I could dissect a fetal pig, and I do not regret it.<eos> - Disgusting...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - And selfish.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And then you came along, Dre, and you changed everything.<eos> I was so busy trying to make you think I was perfect,<eos> I almost flunked out of med school.<eos> Hey, babe, you didn't have to do that for me.<eos> - I didn't?
Son of a bitch.<eos> Morning.<eos> Ghost is in the shower, but there's hot coffee while you wait.<eos> Nothing happened between me and your girl.<eos> You and Keisha are single.<eos> If y'all wanna do it, be my guest.<eos> I don't want to keep playing these games.<eos> I like you.<eos> You like me, too.<eos> And what if I do?
- Look, I didn't tell you because...<eos> - Because you're loyal to Ghost.<eos> No, because I didn't want to be the one to break your heart.<eos> You were thinking of my feelings, huh?<eos> Well, you might be the only one.<eos> I can't take anyone else lying to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to tell you one other thing.<eos> If this is about Keisha, I know.<eos> You do?
- I'm sure he'll prove to be an invaluable member of your team.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - You I trust.<eos> I don't foresee myself trusting someone who showed up to his first day of work at a billion dollar research facility wearing a T-shirt that says<eos> "Keep Calm and Han Shot First."<eos> - Huh... would you give us a minute please, Cisco?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - I realize you don't have to explain your hiring decisions to me, but maybe for the sake of a fun exercise, we could pretend you did.<eos> - I have a good feeling about him.<eos> Just as I did about you.
In that case, I'll pray for you.<eos> Good-bye, John.<eos> Good luck.<eos> This is where Anne Marie found him.<eos> Even if we get in, I'm still not sure what we'll be able to do for him.<eos> John's more prepared than even I realized.<eos> You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
When... when did you find out?<eos> Nine years ago.<eos> "Nine years ago."<eos> I'm okay.<eos> I'm strong.<eos> Strong motherfucker.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
After Matt's dad.<eos> Henry.<eos> That's a good, strong name.<eos> I hate to talk to you about doing the right thing.<eos> Doing it is the easy part.<eos> Knowing what it is is tough.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You know what the right thing to do is.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't, Matthew.
- I have no idea.<eos> - A rhetorical question.<eos> You're in there because I put you in there.<eos> But, Don Maroni, wh-why?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Do you know what hubris is?<eos> Do you know? !<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I thought that was another... rhetorical... question.<eos> Yes, I do.
You?<eos> Tip-top.<eos> Always.<eos> So, what's the deal, brother, are you in?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I'm in.<eos> - Ah, that's my boy!<eos> Name your terms.<eos> You remember when we were 14, we stole all that meat from Satriani's?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Thank you.<eos> But I need to see her first.<eos> Before I sign anything, I need to know she's all right.<eos> She's fine.<eos> I need to see her.<eos> Or no deal.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> How long have you known Fish Mooney?<eos> Huh? I don't.
You're dead!<eos> Go!<eos> Before I lose my good cheer.<eos> Go!<eos> He has a point.<eos> So what next?<eos> Assume Loeb and Falcone are the only ones who know where the stash is.<eos> We need someone close to them, someone who'll talk.<eos> That person doesn't exist.<eos> Yeah, he does.
Let me say it in Spanish:<eos> No.<eos> Okay, look, you're right.<eos> I'm ambitious.<eos> I want to show people around here that things are gonna change.<eos> But, Harvey, I can't do that without your help.<eos> Look, I know you're riding high, what with getting over on Loeb and all.<eos> But there's one thing you should always remember:<eos> Fly too close to the sun, you're gonna get burned.<eos> - You done?
I had a really good time with you last night.<eos> And... I hope that I get to see you again.<eos> At least, uh..., have some breakfast.<eos> Oh, I still have to go home and change and I am so late.<eos> Next time.<eos> Call me tonight.<eos> I can come over after work, if you want.<eos> Oh, Jason..., please, I really have to go.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Why did you come here?<eos> These transformed beings are... abominations.<eos> I knew that I had to find the remainder of the Diviners before another monstrosity occurred, and erase any knowledge of it.<eos> How many Diviners are supposed to be in that crate?<eos> Enough to create an army.<eos> Sir, the crate is empty.<eos> My worst fear has come true.<eos> We have to assume they were all taken at the same time back in the '40s.<eos> Does that mean Hydra has them?<eos> And if Hydra doesn't, who does?
Even though she knew it meant giving up her freedom.<eos> All to save the rest of you.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She wants to get better.<eos> If you take her away from the people she loves, she'll only get worse.<eos> I know you think I overreacted.<eos> But this decision... leaving Skye with you ...<eos> it carries real danger.<eos> I want you to understand that.<eos> I do.
- Didn't think he scared so easily. - Well...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll meet you down there.<eos> I'm so glad you're here, especially since it's been well documented that powers can lead to psychological volatility.<eos> Not that Skye's showing any signs.<eos> Her vitals currently are steady.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I did not know that you were married.<eos> Now you do.
And for better or worse, I matter to him,<eos> - And we can use that.<eos> - I'm with May.<eos> This is an emotional powder keg<eos> - you shouldn't be anywhere near.<eos> - Right.<eos> - We can't risk you losing control.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I know that Fury brought you back from the dead.<eos> Right. I didn't ask for that.<eos> But I've come to appreciate the gesture.<eos> And that he filled your veins with alien blood.<eos> God knows what that did.<eos> Weaver thinks it made you into some kind of a messenger for an alien race.<eos> Can you say with certainty that that's not true?<eos> And we haven't even begun to talk about your protégé, Skye.<eos> You two have a lot in common.<eos> At least, you once did.
I represent the Strategic<eos> Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division, And you are about to enter a quarantine site.<eos> Colonel, you can't send your men in there!<eos> A biological weapon was set off!<eos> Nasty stuff...<eos> Flesh-eating.<eos> Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians.<eos> Give my team time to assess.<eos> Did you say, "Biological Weapon"?<eos> Yes, I did.
- Because of me.<eos> I asked him to go and protect you, to keep you safe.<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> I should never have let you go at all.<eos> It was the right thing to do.<eos> We have to make sure that the Cal that we put out into the world is the same Cal that I've seen here... th-the safe and user-friendly Cal.<eos> You were trying to make it easy on him.<eos> You were being compassionate.<eos> - How do we get Lincoln back?<eos> - We don't.
We can't let this happen to anyone else.<eos> No.<eos> What time are you back, love?<eos> Not late.<eos> Is Danny walking you home?<eos> Flippin' hope so!<eos> See ya, Mum.<eos> I fucking saw you in there, Danny!<eos> You didn't see a thing.<eos> Yes, I did.
Cargo hold's secure.<eos> Or as secure as it can be with a teleporter in the mix.<eos> We no longer have to wait for the Inhumans to come to us.<eos> Remember how HYDRA could track the teleporter?<eos> I was able to rebuild that device using this scan from Deathlok's eye.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> - When the teleporter left the cargo hold...<eos> We were able to follow his signature.<eos> - You know where they are?<eos> - We do.
She is a SHIELD agent.<eos> - Is that still true?<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Now's a good time to find out where Skye really stands.<eos> - So they do have it.<eos> - Deep in their ship, under lock and key.<eos> - For now.<eos> - Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.<eos> - Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.<eos> - Yes. Yes, it does.
Did they do something to him?<eos> We all felt that it was best to have someone more objective to meet with your mother.<eos> Gonzales sent people to kill me a few weeks ago.<eos> He's a much better man than you think.<eos> What about you?<eos> Why can't you be in there right now?<eos> I told you, we needed someone objective.<eos> I know that Whitehall subjected you to unspeakable horrors, that he took everything from you.<eos> A good man, Phil Coulson, put a bullet in him.<eos> - Where did you...?
Kara needs closure.<eos> Admit that you betrayed her, and we can end this.<eos> You're such a hypocrite.<eos> You say I betrayed her?<eos> You betrayed your entire team.<eos> How many people who trusted you have died?<eos> See, I've seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside.<eos> He's a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - Sure, I do.
- when she started watching Fox News.<eos> - And I fell for the whole act.<eos> Look, you had to choose between two... this way.<eos> This way.<eos> You had to choose between two sides that both mean something.<eos> I get it.<eos> You make the best choice you can.<eos> Sometimes, it works out.<eos> Sometimes...<eos> - It didn't. - It did not.
I'll get the job done.<eos> Well, w-watch your back because I just saw Hunter with Bobbi, and it made me realize that...<eos> I... well, it's just that w...<eos> we never really spoke about... what you said to me at the bottom of the ocean.<eos> This?<eos> Now?<eos> - You want to talk about this now?<eos> - No.<eos> We...<eos> We don't...
What is my problem?<eos> You want to know what my problem is?<eos> It could not have been a more rhetorical question.<eos> All these yahoos in my business have turned on me.<eos> You know?<eos> Suddenly, I have a "reputation"<eos> for boning other guys' wives and girlfriends.<eos> I can't even get a job.<eos> - I thought you had a job.<eos> - I did.
Stay on the wife.<eos> Mr. Jarvis, I want you to meet...<eos> Chief Dooley,<eos> I'm afraid I mistakenly took your stolen-car report.<eos> Well, thank you for your hospitality, gentlemen.<eos> Unless you're going to arrest and charge me,<eos> I'll be on my way.<eos> If there's anything further you'd like to discuss, please feel free to contact one of Mr. Stark's attorneys.<eos> Do you have any idea how stupid that was?<eos> - I didn't...
Why?<eos> 'Cause she got all soft in there?<eos> How do we know it's not just an act?<eos> - We've all seen her chops. - She came clean even though she was halfway out the door with Stark's confession.<eos> If that confession was real, but she's saying it isn't.<eos> By her own account,<eos> Carter would be back in cuffs when Stark didn't show.<eos> She gave up Captain America's blood.<eos> I know that's big for her.<eos> So do you, Jack.
Yes, he has.<eos> But emotion... can turn the most circumspect of men careless.<eos> - No, that's not what I'm saying.<eos> - Well, it sure sounds like it.<eos> Hey, if Fisk really is the guy that blew the hell out of my city, shot those cops and went after you, then nobody wants to see him take it on the nuts more than me.<eos> No, I might have you edged out on that.<eos> Okay, present company excluded.<eos> All I'm saying is Armand Tully is a dead end.<eos> You find something out?<eos> I, um, did a little back-channeling with Marci.
Not today.<eos> I think I've had enough.<eos> - Tell Foggy I'll see him in the morning.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Matt.<eos> Yeah?<eos> If there is a God... and if he cares at all about... about any of us...<eos> Fisk will get what he deserves.<eos> You have to believe that.<eos> I do.
It was a hell of a speech, Fisk.<eos> You ever think about running for office?<eos> I'll leave that to people like you, Senator.<eos> That's a good answer.<eos> You, um... got a minute to talk about that zoning issue?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll be back in a minute.<eos> I didn't vote for Senator Cherryh last election.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> Few people did.
That Karen didn't know?<eos> This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I only ever needed my friend.<eos> I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that. You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Do you work?<eos> Me?<eos> I never want to work again.<eos> Oh, shit! I have to go.<eos> I'm meeting Jon for lunch.<eos> Sure.<eos> Thanks for knocking.<eos> I didn't.<eos> No, that's right.<eos> You didn't, did you?
What?<eos> Just enunciate.<eos> E-racist.<eos> I am the Eracist.<eos> - Right? Tell 'em.<eos> - We're not friends.<eos> Hey, your buddy here jacked us for a hundred bucks.<eos> But I'm willing to let that slide if you say I'm your best friend now.<eos> Say it, do it.<eos> Do it.
There's not gonna be a winner, 'cause this match is over.<eos> You three are evicted.<eos> Del, you can evict us all you want, but, um... I think we're gonna finish this match.<eos> - Yeah! - Yeah.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Not on my property, you're not.<eos> Oh, damn, Waymond, it just got real out here.<eos> Have you ever seen anything like this?<eos> Anders, do you think we should shut this down?<eos> No, I don't, Montez.
I... yes...<eos> No!<eos> You mustn't speak!<eos> I thought I had made that clear.<eos> If you speak, I will have to cut out your brother's throat.<eos> Now then...<eos> Where did your son and queen go?<eos> I'm afraid I don't know.<eos> He doesn't know.<eos> None of them do.
That's the best part.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.<eos> Claire Underwood.<eos> We need to hit her hard.<eos> You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
You know exactly what this is.<eos> Kensi loves whipping out her metaphor.<eos> Well... good news is, Callen is going to make a full recovery and he should be home soon.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> That's great news.<eos> That's awesome.<eos> Hey, have you ever tried group Zen?<eos> I'm sorry, what?<eos> I love group Zen.<eos> Do you?
I have more than a few guns.<eos> Speaking of guns, you shouldn't be shooting off guns around here.<eos> It attracts too much attention.<eos> He didn't fire a gun.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> You know, it just... It steps on the peaceful environment that we have here.<eos> It rattles Mother Nature.<eos> You understand that, don't you, Dylan?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> We do.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> I just wanted to apologize.<eos> I was really rude last night.<eos> I overreacted and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> Things just escalated.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much.<eos> - She doesn't.
But she did not hear.<eos> I'll change my emergency contact.<eos> Hi, Lieutenant Armstrong.<eos> I have some information on Detective Cordero that you need to hear.<eos> Ah, irony.<eos> He disobeyed your direct order.<eos> What a cruel mistress.<eos> Good morning, mom!<eos> Ah, buenos día.<eos> No, I didn't.
Unfortunately, at that moment, fantasy crashed into reality.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Right, just like Regina a-and Aimeé in "Corazón Salvaje".<eos> And young Jane chose to believe that.<eos> Mostly.<eos> If I'm being honest, perhaps the fantasy cracked, just a little.<eos> _<eos> But then again, it usually does.
Hey!<eos> - Hey, boy!<eos> What?<eos> Oh... oh, no!<eos> Wait, Diablo!<eos> _<eos> I'm just saying... our first case together.<eos> And the last.<eos> And we caught the bad guy!<eos> We definitely did.
I mean, for me, growing up without a dad,<eos> I never stopped wondering who he was.<eos> Yeah. I know.<eos> And I heard your voice in my head saying that when I was trying to decide what to do.<eos> So I e-mailed her.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No response yet but...<eos> I think it's good.<eos> I really do.
Thank you.<eos> And I, um...<eos> I owe you an apology for lashing out at you the other day.<eos> I was having... well... a moment.<eos> LATIN LOVER NARRATOR: And for the first time, Jane realized that Mrs. Falco wasn't the worst person in the world.<eos> She was just a person.<eos> But that knife was very filthy.<eos> Though clearly not a perfect one.<eos> - Xiomara, I want to apologize.<eos> - No, you don't.

What was the long-term plan?<eos> Did you talk about it?<eos> Well, not specifically.<eos> Xiomara, you had a little girl.<eos> You got to raise her.<eos> Don't you want that for Rogelio?<eos> I mean, if he wants it...<eos> - More children?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> - You do?
I've-I've just been... thinking about things.<eos> Overthinking.<eos> Letting my doubts get in the way instead of believing you.<eos> I know you're not your father.<eos> Well, maybe I am.<eos> And why is that a bad thing?<eos> He was there.<eos> He provided for me.<eos> - I know that.<eos> - No, you don't.
This could be the start of a second career for you...<eos> As a movie star.<eos> George Clooney didn't become a movie star until later in life.<eos> I have always wanted to do movies.<eos> Well, now's your chance.<eos> TV's too small.<eos> Your face needs to be 50 feet high.<eos> And in 3-D.<eos> I have been told I have the perfect features for 3-D.<eos> Of course you do.
Nothing, it's nothing.<eos> It's just... the writers were backstage last night making jokes about your weight.<eos> They said they were gonna hide the crullers.<eos> I am the star of this show!<eos> Now give me that cruller!<eos> And how did he land such a prized role?<eos> He gave a great audition.<eos> But I don't understand.<eos> Even if you wanted a part, you didn't have to get me fired.<eos> Of course I did.
Yes, you are right!<eos> I don't know how I missed it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You are a true friend.<eos> So, can I ask you a question?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you think they'll last?<eos> Jane and Rafael?<eos> 'Cause I don't think they will.<eos> Deep down, I-I don't.
I'm still graduating.<eos> It's just a ceremony.<eos> You can't do it after?<eos> No. Dr. Hillcroft is going out of town and he's booked solid, so they're squeezing me in.<eos> Just take a couple of deep breaths and relax, okay?<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Mom...<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> _ _ _<eos> I get that, ma.<eos> But do you think that that's what he'd want?<eos> Because I don't.
It's footage from the night Roman Zazo died.<eos> I remember.<eos> The ice, the splat, the blood.<eos> Yeah, but look at...<eos> This.<eos> It's Rose Solano.<eos> Seconds before Zazo was impaled.<eos> She couldn't have killed him.<eos> And Emilio is right there with her.<eos> So the bellboy did it.
You've done nothing with your life.<eos> You've accomplished nothing.<eos> Can I just say How proud I am of you, honey?<eos> You are such a disappointment.<eos> Thanks, dad.<eos> Thanks, mom. It means a lot.<eos> It means a lot.<eos> Rafael:<eos> Wow. Babies need a lot of gear.<eos> No, they don't.
Ms. Harper, hi, I, uh... right on time.<eos> Thanks for pushing the massage an hour later.<eos> Hey, you're Jane... from the proposal the other night, right?<eos> Um, yeah, that-that's me.<eos> Boy, that really went off the rails.<eos> Let me guess... cute, rich, but dumb, right?<eos> Oh, for the love...<eos> - I-I-I'm not...<eos> - You don't want me to read that?<eos> - Well... I-I do, but...
Where you going?<eos> Couple's therapist<eos> With rafael.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Yeah, I mean, I don't know what else to do.<eos> I hope it helps.<eos> If you have, like, five minutes at the end of your session To ask, like, a little question for me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I-I kissed marco last night.<eos> You did what?
And look, I...<eos> I meant what I said about us being friends.<eos> If that's all you want, I'm totally cool with it.<eos> But, um, is that all you want?<eos> I mean, Jane, am I imagining this, or is something happening lately with us?<eos> You're not imagining it.<eos> But I don't know where it's coming from, and...<eos> I mean, there's so much up in the air, - and with you it is safe and familiar and... - Oh, wow.<eos> - Safe and familiar, huh?<eos> - I-I didn't
Well, according to his frequent locations on Evan's phone, he went to the gym three or four times a week.<eos> Most gyms have free Wi-Fi. Restaurants, too.<eos> I bet you he was eating out every night.<eos> You know, club owners score mad dates.<eos> How often is he at Carla's Cafe?<eos> Almost every day.<eos> Well, according to the network logs in Evan's laptop, he connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi the morning after the murder.<eos> You still think it's a possibility that he framed himself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
The true architects of the plague, they're watching me.<eos> I'm running out of time.<eos> Is among you.<eos> Please, Cole.<eos> I said your name?<eos> You gave me this mission.<eos> You're the reason I'm here.<eos> Now, it's been two years, Cassie.<eos> Please tell me you know who Leland Frost is.<eos> I don't.
Give me your watch. Give me your watch.<eos> If you're hoping to reprise your efforts from the party, you should know that these gentlemen have orders to kill her first.<eos> Now, in all currently known science, time travel... is impossible.<eos> Here's the thing, Cole... I have something currently known science doesn't.<eos> You ready for this?<eos> This is crazy stuff, but it's true.<eos> I remember meeting you in 1987... 28 years ago, and you looked exactly the same as you do today.<eos> Don't understand?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I didn't either at first.
What else is there?<eos> You saw me there, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I stayed away.<eos> I had to follow Henri without you there.<eos> Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you... outside the tents that night... the lights.<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
No charge.<eos> Besides, you know, Lolly will probably stop by later anyways.<eos> She usually does.<eos> You're also a little curious about the list, too, right?<eos> Vaguely.<eos> Well, that was fun, but I feel like I know way too much about all of you.<eos> But, like, not so much about Becca, though.<eos> What?<eos> I drink.<eos> I did, a few...
I'll get your drinks.<eos> Back wall. It's alphabetical.<eos> It's finally over.<eos> That was...<eos> That was awful.<eos> I mean, it wasn't that bad.<eos> Did we just watch the same movie?<eos> I'll admit, you know, maybe Lolly and I don't share the same taste in film, but you know, it's not like we have to have everything in common.<eos> Are you dating her?<eos> Honest, I don't...
No, I won't...<eos> I won't tell you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> I look at your body, you know what I see?<eos> Potential.<eos> I mean, you got a long ways to go, but the foundation, it is there.<eos> You want to feel something?<eos> Do you?<eos> You do.
You can do better than Lolly.<eos> She's a flake, and she'll stomp on your heart.<eos> I'd kick her to the curb.<eos> I appreciate the candid advice from... from the guru, but I don't... I don't want to kick Lolly to the curb.<eos> I mean, I know we're still getting to know each other, but I really like Lolly, and, like, I think she likes me.<eos> So why'd she... Blow you off tonight?<eos> If I had to guess, I... I'd have to say someone's trying to keep us apart.<eos> I mean, the thing is, I really like Jamie, and I didn't want to blow him off tonight.<eos> I mean, I love coal oven pizza.<eos> Who doesn't, right?
Yeah. Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Mm hmm. How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me?<eos> You would have had to have tested it specifically.<eos> Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?<eos> Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah--I do.
I need to be out there.<eos> Joe, you're always the first one To tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.<eos> I took down Clyde.<eos> I can take down His dirt bag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know.<eos> They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, Your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
Come on.<eos> Give me a little credit here.<eos> I've just been dealing with a lot of things lately.<eos> I like you, Linda.<eos> And we really get along.<eos> Relationships should be more than just getting along.<eos> Your heart should ache for me.<eos> Does it?<eos> You're not upset with me?<eos> No one did anything wrong.
- Oh. - You used to live there.<eos> I did.<eos> You ever go back?<eos> No. Too many memories of Tess.<eos> That's right.<eos> Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I'm not gonna try and convince you with promises.<eos> But, Detective, give me a chance.<eos> I think we already know what you're capable of, Doctor.<eos> You hurt a lot of people that night.<eos> So those doctors in there, they're good enough?<eos> The best in the city, best in the country.<eos> Look at them.<eos> They have no clue what's going on.<eos> They're baffled, and the reason for that is what's happening inside Barry is a mystery, and they don't have the tools to solve it.<eos> - But you do?
Right.<eos> But if there is anything that I have learned in our time together, Barry, it is that the only thing standing in the way of you achieving every goal that you set for yourself is you.<eos> There is no limit to how strong you will get or how fast you will go.<eos> Everything that you need, you already have.<eos> Thank you, Dr. Wells.<eos> You know, I couldn't have done any of this without you.<eos> I feel the same way about you.<eos> It's so strange.<eos> I mean, I look at him now, and I know that he killed my mom and he sent my dad to jail, but, I mean, sometimes he's just so kind in the moment, I actually like him.<eos> But you never did.
Do not stop for anything.<eos> Let's move out.<eos> After you.<eos> Hey, we got traffic up ahead.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> How's our cargo doing?<eos> All quiet so far.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Your powers don't work in here.<eos> None of ours do.
Let's just go back to the party, huh?<eos> You think that'd be best?<eos> I do.<eos> Well, too bad.<eos> Because you can't control hurricane Voodoo.<eos> All you can do is ride the wind.<eos> Hurricane force wind, category awesome.<eos> Voo, stop it. Stop.<eos> Stop it.<eos> Don't.
Son of a bitch showed up at my shop this morning.<eos> Just walks right in, tells me the product is gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> - He said his brother took it.<eos> But he thinks he can get it back.<eos> I'd say it's time to cut your losses.<eos> That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Eric told me you left.<eos> I did.
It's always been you.<eos> ~ What has?<eos> ~ You're gonna make me say it, aren't you?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'm in love with you, Maggie.<eos> Ever since you came here.<eos> What am I supposed to do with that now?<eos> Do you really think I didn't know?<eos> ~ Well, why didn't you say anything?<eos> ~ Because you never did!
~ What's wrong?<eos> ~ I think there's been an accident.<eos> ~ What do you mean?<eos> ~ Hey, hey, Pippa! You should be asleep!<eos> ~ I thought you were at a wedding. ~ Is Lisa all right?<eos> ~ No, she's not.<eos> ~ She's, er... I'm afraid Lee's really hurt her.<eos> ~ What? What? !<eos> You should be in -<eos> You didn't...
You might never meet me.<eos> Or Caitlin or Ronnie.<eos> Truth is, there's no real way of knowing what your life will be.<eos> There's no choice here, Barry.<eos> You have to do this.<eos> You gotta change the past.<eos> Joe?<eos> So what... What, that's it?<eos> You think I should just do it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Oh, my God.<eos> - Barry.<eos> We have to shut down the wormhole quickly!<eos> Caitlin!<eos> You didn't save her.<eos> Why?<eos> Why?<eos> You could have had the life you wanted.<eos> You could have had everything you ever wanted!<eos> I already do.
Heard you had a great meeting with the recruiter From vanderbilt last thursday.<eos> How do you know that? Uh, we're cops.<eos> We find out stuff.<eos> Yeah, you know, i always wondered about those meetings.<eos> What do they do?<eos> Like, get you into a fancy hotel suite, Give your dad a few drinks, loosen him up, And then they hit you with the pitch?<eos> My dad doesn't drink.<eos> Well, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated About an hour after your meeting.<eos> I mean, i didn't see him have any drinks that day.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Stop right there!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Turn around, put your hands on the wall.<eos> Turn around!<eos> Suspect had assumed the position, hands against the wall.<eos> Officer Brasher was behind him.<eos> What happened next.<eos> I was making my way around a vehicle to get over to them when I heard the shot.<eos> Did you see Officer Brasher draw her weapon?<eos> I did not.
I mean, I'll run in.<eos> You know, Pam, maybe this is a sign we should be winding things down a bit.<eos> Oh, isn't that great?<eos> Here, I want you to keep it.<eos> Here, it's yours.<eos> Pam, you can't just keep giving me your stuff.<eos> - No, come on, take it.<eos> - Yeah, I don't want it.<eos> - Just take it.<eos> - I don't...
He lives half a day's ride from here.<eos> He is a recluse for a reason, remember?<eos> Take me to him.<eos> Blood Axe, Skull Cleaver, Igmar the Impaler... I don't know who are more afraid of Greylock or them.<eos> Relax, my friend, we're fighting on the same side now.<eos> The wedding vows didn't take place, there is no truce between our clans.<eos> They didn't wed?<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Well, you do now.
That being said, I still don't recall being bounced on your knee.<eos> Nevertheless, it, uh, seems that I owe you an apology.<eos> Like I said, I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> No, sir.<eos> The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir. I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do. - Mm-hmm.
- Did you even plan?<eos> Where were you gonna stay tonight and the night after?<eos> You got cash?<eos> How much?<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> You know it's gotta be cash and only cash, right?<eos> And what about an I.D.?<eos> You got a new I.D.?<eos> Hmm? That's the only way to get off the grid.<eos> No, I don't.
The hunt for Tyler O'Neill ended in tragedy and another Lakewood teen lost her life.<eos> And the press will be hyping the curse of Brandon James and looking for someone to blame, but I've met these kids.<eos> Their loss is impossible to describe.<eos> So I'm not gonna try.<eos> My heartfelt condolences go to the friends and family of Riley Marra.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Could you turn that off?<eos> I can't believe she's gone.<eos> I can't believe I abandoned her.<eos> Brooke, we both did.
I had that one coming.<eos> You totally did.<eos> But...<eos> It was sort of a dick move on my part.<eos> Aw. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful mutual tolerance.<eos> And then I say...<eos> I don't know, a line of some sort about something.<eos> Or not.<eos> My, uh... Dad was out when I got home last night.<eos> Did you...
You know what, maybe it's actually better if I don't.<eos> Don't think that.<eos> He said that it ends with me.<eos> So let's just skip ahead to the ending.<eos> You can't let this sadistic bastard win.<eos> If you're the key to all of this, then you have to find a way to fight back.<eos> I did.<eos> And he sliced Will in half, right in front of me.<eos> I don't know if I have any fight left.<eos> Yes, you do.
She's fine.<eos> I know they're saying a lot of terrible things...<eos> But I did not kill Will.<eos> I don't even know where that knife...<eos> I'm sorry, but my lawyer... I...<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> Mr. Branson...<eos> Whatever your name is...<eos> Okay, my friends are dead, my family has been targeted, and you know why.<eos> Actually, I don't, Emma.
They caught him.<eos> Yeah, it's great news.<eos> I really should've called you back.<eos> You've had a lot on your mind.<eos> I just wanted to make sure you were okay.<eos> I am.<eos> I really am.<eos> - After what happened to Will, I couldn't risk...<eos> - I get it.<eos> I do.
- Would you? Thanks.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, you guys were great.<eos> Extremely retro.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry that I didn't call you yesterday.<eos> Actually, uh, now's probably a really good time to catch up.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I went through Rachel's raw footage, a lot of it, trying to find a connection to Branson.<eos> And did you?
I...<eos> I didn't.<eos> And then she was murdered.<eos> I... I am sorry.<eos> I just don't understand why you didn't tell me or anyone else.<eos> I should have.<eos> But I didn't have any information that would've helped.<eos> It was a no-win situation.<eos> I really wanna believe you.<eos> But you don't?
If you can't hear me and trust me...<eos> Then Branson won.<eos> Even sitting in his jail cell, he beat you.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Where's Kieran?<eos> He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know!<eos> Just listen to me, okay?<eos> Brooke, this whole thing...<eos> This whole thing is a mistake, okay?<eos> The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's all I know.<eos> Is she all right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, she had a couple of rough nights on the row, but she'll be okay.<eos> Who's coming to the party?<eos> Oh, none of these people.<eos> They've declined.<eos> And these are the only replies we've received for a party that begins in less than six hours.<eos> No one wants this.<eos> - I do.
My son.<eos> The only person in this world who truly needed me.<eos> - No...<eos> - You made him sick.<eos> - You made him weak.<eos> - No!<eos> You gave him something over time...<eos> Stop it!<eos> You really think that I'm capable of murdering your child?<eos> I didn't before.
Possibly with vegetables. If you so choose.<eos> Okay. I'm leaving now.<eos> Oh, isn't this a rare treat. I can't remember the last time I had a surprise visit from you.<eos> Kind of makes you want to have one of your own, doesn't it?<eos> She hasn't picked him up yet.<eos> The nurse.<eos> He's not crying but he's awake.<eos> He needs to be held.<eos> Give me two minutes to reschedule my meeting, and then we'll grab lunch.<eos> We just did the autopsy on his mother.
Oh, I thought that was a rhetorical question.<eos> Um... no?<eos> Correct.<eos> No.<eos> Even when I lost all that weight working my balls off on that goddamned elliptical.<eos> That's a girl's machine.<eos> - He said that that's actually...<eos> - I know what he said.<eos> Yeah, I-I choose not to hear when he gets like this.<eos> How we doing up there, Johnny?
I was held up at work.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Did you understand?<eos> Who opened my bag?<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> Blanche?<eos> Don't go swimming without me.<eos> It's dangerous.<eos> - I know how to swim.<eos> - No, you don't.
But if you want to catch him, give me something I can use.<eos> Who is it?<eos> Luke.<eos> Who's Luke?<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I want to hire you.<eos> In the middle of the night?<eos> He's been Kilgraved.<eos> - Open the door, Jones.<eos> - Don't!
- More important than a paying customer?<eos> Life and death, actually.<eos> Figured you were blowing me off.<eos> I wouldn't just bail on you.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
Whatever we were doing.<eos> You had no reason to believe me.<eos> So I shut you down.<eos> That's the reason you broke it off.<eos> Don't, that's not the reason.<eos> Then what was it?<eos> Why does it matter?<eos> Maybe I can make it right.<eos> You can't.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
You help people.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And you make the rest of us look like selfish pricks.<eos> Is that a compliment or...<eos> There are other nurses at the hospital who can help.<eos> There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
We talked a great deal and he told me that he loved me.<eos> I was trying to say... "I love you".<eos> What's going on?<eos> Anyone there?<eos> Over here.<eos> - What the hell is all this?<eos> It is rather unpleasant, I agree.<eos> All these chemical products!<eos> Keeps the birds away.<eos> So does public radio!
If Milhouse can play, anyone can play.<eos> Once again, I'm the lower bound.<eos> You're it!<eos> Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?<eos> Well, there's nothing in the rule book against it.<eos> It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Hippocrates swore by it.<eos> But what does he know, right?<eos> So, I got George in my office.<eos> Seized an opportunity, did you?<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> And?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Maybe there's nothing to find.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> - No, I don't.
No.<eos> But I should have, and I probably will tomorrow because I don't want my permanent record being screwed up because... what?<eos> You thought you'd impress Amber and those dumb jocks she hangs out with?<eos> I'm not putting my head in the noose.<eos> You got caught, not me.<eos> Wow...<eos> You are...<eos> - I'm what?<eos> You know what you are.<eos> And now I do too.
- There's no way you could've known she was in trouble, Chas.<eos> Her lips are chapped.<eos> Celestial burn marks.<eos> Left behind when a soul departs.<eos> This is just Geraldine's body?<eos> Alive and breathing, which is the good news.<eos> And the bad?<eos> Well... if her soul is being used for a dark purpose, then she doesn't have long... a day or two at most.<eos> - How can you separate a soul from a body?<eos> - You don't.
I don't know what happened then, but I was panicked and scared, and when I suddenly came to, it seemed like I was being attacked by a stranger.<eos> Then I felt a power surge from my body.<eos> Sir, I need you to remain...<eos> They grounded the flight in Houston, then took me in for questioning.<eos> I couldn't explain anything, but they had no proof.<eos> My lawyer believed I would be released.<eos> Then orders from the Defense Department arrived, and I ended up in this hell hole.<eos> Defense Secretary Richards has to be the one who's behind this.<eos> You believe I'm innocent?<eos> Yes, I do.
"At least" is a strong...<eos> You...<eos> He doesn't like me?<eos> H-how is that possible?<eos> I'm so likeable.<eos> I won "best couple" in high school, and the guy I was dating was a clown.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I need your dad to like me.<eos> T... he will.<eos> He does, Zelda.
Yes, yes.<eos> Thank you so much, sir.<eos> I will relay that to the...<eos> The client.<eos> I'm so sorry things didn't work out with Madeline.<eos> I think she's... she's having trouble moving past an old relationship.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It happens.<eos> I think I know why you really came to visit.<eos> Oh, you do?
But it... it can't happen because I'm in a relationship.<eos> Andrew, just to be clear,<eos> I came here because I'm going through a tough time and wanted the unconditional support of a good friend.<eos> I'm sorry for thinking that was you.<eos> I totally hear what you're saying.<eos> Sometimes it's like you had something special with somebody, and it's... it's hard to make those feelings go away.<eos> That's exactly what I'm saying.<eos> Hey, so she didn't want me back.<eos> At all.<eos> Oh, she... she didn't?
Yeah, I've heard it.<eos> What were your foster parents like, Harry?<eos> Had several... wasn't close to any of them.<eos> The Saxons were beautiful people.<eos> When they took me in, I thought I was done with Maclaren.<eos> We had some good years.<eos> And then pop got sick and died, and they sent me back.<eos> You know all about that, Harry.<eos> You know all about the darkness, don't you?<eos> I do.
Thomas More and the old aristocracy are for the Pope and not afraid to say so.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Archbishop Warham.<eos> This um, prophetess you harbour in your diocese - Eliza Barton?<eos> How is she getting on?<eos> What do you want, Cromwell?<eos> Well, I hear that she's telling people that if the King marries Lady Anne, he has only a year to reign.<eos> I just wondered who is controlling her.<eos> She may be a simple country girl but she has a genuine gift.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
Saracen. What do you know of this beast?<eos> We called it, jinn.<eos> Huh? It's mean, demon.<eos> Have you actually encountered one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?<eos> We did not.
Cat...<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> You think Mom would be happy for me, Heather?<eos> Despite the fact that she all but tried to destroy Vincent?<eos> - Cat, don't do this...<eos> - No! I am...<eos> I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do.
Why would Korbell order a hit after an unsuccessful raid?<eos> I mean, it just calls more attention to him.<eos> Exactly.<eos> The animal that escapes a snare doesn't necessarily go after the poacher.<eos> Okay, everyone, we can ask these questions in San Antonio.<eos> So, saddle up.<eos> What does this guy Peterson have on you?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Because you're acting like he has something on you.<eos> He doesn't.
A connect has never needed their money this quick.<eos> Julito, do what you said, okay?<eos> - You work on doubling up with everyone.<eos> I'll work on finding the territory.<eos> Look...<eos> I'm not saying he should have called you that.<eos> You're not...<eos> Latin.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No. No, I don't.
But if you leave him, then we'll be together.<eos> [sighs] I'll take care of you.<eos> Me and three kids and my mama?<eos> I'll figure it out, Tasha.<eos> Shawn, we can't be together, not like that, anyway.<eos> Sneaking around, trying not to get caught.<eos> This is the best we're gonna do.<eos> You need to listen to me, okay?<eos> - I have more to lose than you do.<eos> - No, you don't.
So do I.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I have good reason to believe that Simon has been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> And I don't have proof yet, but I know he's working with an outside company, Ravenna.<eos> Ravenna?<eos> That sick bastard.<eos> What is it?<eos> Our daughter's name.<eos> I didn't know you had kids.<eos> We don't.
Ahem. Tomorrow morning.<eos> - Together.<eos> - All right.<eos> Tell me everything you've got on James St. Patrick.<eos> We're gonna take him down.<eos> You look like a movie star.<eos> Get the fuck in the car.<eos> It's good to have you back, brother.<eos> You came through for me.<eos> Of course I did.
Well, I suppose you don't really need one to distribute newspapers.<eos> We could cheer ourselves up by having a farewell party for it.<eos> Let's do that.<eos> What's this?<eos> Sorry, I borrowed it without asking you.<eos> What's that doing there?<eos> But...<eos> You told me you like sukiyaki.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Come on.<eos> Let's go kill some people.<eos> This is all wrong.<eos> We have to make this perfect, or he'll kill us all.<eos> Our boy Mark is punishing us for killing his family last year.<eos> These murder scenes are re-creations of their deaths.<eos> This is the second time in 24 hours that I've been called a liar.<eos> First you're the liar, now me.<eos> You lived this moment.<eos> You both did.
Can you come home?<eos> I know, but it's really bad.<eos> Ok.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you.<eos> Wow.<eos> You lied like a pro.<eos> I bet he can't tell when you're faking it.<eos> Come on.<eos> We all do it.
It's a subspace transmission.<eos> The ship is broadcasting a distress signal.<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for something to treat a headache.<eos> Headaches can be caused by blood vessel abnormalities or brain tumors.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know. I...<eos> I just do.
Tom?<eos> Do you mind if we ask you a few questions?<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> Do you feel it all?<eos> Feel what?<eos> You don't feel it.<eos> Your consciousness is too small to comprehend it.<eos> I feel the emptiness of messages bombarding me, telling me to consume.<eos> I feel like there's something lacking in my life, and I feel like you might have the answer.<eos> I do.
You need to report that<eos> - relationship and file a complaint.<eos> - A complaint?<eos> You felt pressured into the relationship because he was your superior... coerced.<eos> You thought it would hurt your career if you didn't comply.<eos> Well, technically, he wasn't my superior,<eos> - and I didn't feel pressured.<eos> - It was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy, was it not?<eos> How does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage?<eos> It doesn't.
Just please don't tell me if you made out with any cute English girls because I cannot compete with those accents.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Oh, this is really last-minute, but there's this fundraiser tonight.<eos> It's kind of in my uncle's honor, and it's black tie.<eos> Do you want to be my date?<eos> It's gonna be all fancy, and you love fundraisers.<eos> Um, I...<eos> What?<eos> Brenna, I know before I left, we were thinking my parents would forget about what happened and they wouldn't care if we saw each other.<eos> But they still do.
- Oh.<eos> April is my youngest patient, and I have to say, it's hard to talk to her sometimes.<eos> She's dealing with fears that somebody her age shouldn't have to deal with.<eos> And then looking to me for reassurance that everything's going to be okay, when... when you don't know if she's going to be okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I tell her that she is.<eos> And I believe that she will be okay.<eos> But I can't control what happens.<eos> - I mean, you know...<eos> - I do.
And the way I...<eos> I hold my breath every time they test my blood and... Scan my body.<eos> You just hope and you pray that...<eos> And if the results are bad...<eos> You try to accept it, and you get back up, because... because... Because that's the deal.<eos> There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
I used to worry that you would stay pissed at me about how everything went down with April.<eos> Or worse, that you were gonna swoop in and try and steal her from me.<eos> But that all seems kinda crazy now, doesn't it?<eos> You know, I always thought that "Phantom Menace" was the best "Star Wars."<eos> But you know, I get it, because you and April are just friends.<eos> And what's great, dimples...<eos> Dom...<eos> Domples, is that we can be friends now, because I have nothing to worry about.<eos> You don't want April back.<eos> - I do.
I... thought you weren't coming to the wedding, but here you are, all dressed up.<eos> I guess you realized what I already knew.<eos> I've done a little soul searching.<eos> Come on.<eos> Hey. How are you feeling?<eos> Jeez, can't a girl collapse at her own wedding without everyone getting all worked up?<eos> I'm okay.<eos> Just been a crazy day.<eos> I heard about your fight with Leo.<eos> - You did? - Yeah.
Of course, asexual and inter-sex students are not forgotten here.<eos> Why couldn't they find a transgender actor to play the lead in transparent?<eos> Whatever. Gwynnie played a guy in Shakespeare in love.<eos> Oh, honey, that was drag, not trans.<eos> But before we break for the day, I thought we could spend some time getting to know more about our newest member.<eos> On behalf of the club, we're so glad to have our first "B".<eos> Wait.<eos> You're bi?<eos> Oh. I thought you were gay.<eos> Yeah, I did, too.
We're developing more and more for personal use, not just the corporate sector.<eos> Kind of widening out.<eos> And what do you think about this whole government thing of, you know, listening in to people's private information?<eos> - I mean, that's crazy stuff.<eos> - Who knows? I mean, fuck them, you know?<eos> An eye for an eye, I say.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Anyway, this is a conversation for another time.<eos> But speaking of government, did you know that Simon was class president?<eos> Oh, yeah. Yeah, I did.
You're gonna tell me exactly where he's hiding, or we're gonna find out how much you're willing to see your fiancé suffer.<eos> Heather. Shh! They might hear you.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I don't know, but I think they might kill them, JT.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know; I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
Well, it's a good thing we didn't elope, then, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.<eos> It wasn't until it hit me that we might not get a real wedding that I realized that I might want one.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Is that a compliment?<eos> You're still out of pocket, 50 quid.<eos> I must repay it.<eos> No need.<eos> It was money well spent.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To learn that my eldest child is a child no more and quite tough enough to run this estate.<eos> Indeed, she could clearly run the kingdom, should she be called upon to do so.<eos> Well, I hope you mean that.<eos> I do.
According to the Federales,<eos> Lobos plans to meet with his distributors,<eos> Tommy Egan, at a warehouse on 11th Avenue.<eos> They probably chose that location because it has quick access to the West Side Highway and to the Hudson plus multiple exits and entrances.<eos> - We'll need helos and vessels...<eos> - What'd I miss?<eos> Federales got intel that Lobos is planning on meeting his distributor tomorrow at 1:00 in a warehouse on the West Side.<eos> SAXE: So we need every roof, window, and door covered until tactical enters the access point and secures Lobos.<eos> How do we know the info's legit?<eos> We don't.
The king of Urkesh was killed in your restaurant.<eos> Let me summarize your list of woes...<eos> We got motive, opportunity, and now we got a murder weapon.<eos> A bowl with trace amounts of polonium-210...<eos> That's the poison we found in the victim's body.<eos> You wanted the king dead, so just tell us how you did it.<eos> If I knew he was heir to the throne of Urkesh, you think I would have poisoned him, like a woman?<eos> No need to get sexist, pal.<eos> I would have stabbed him in the heart with a knife and told him to rot in hell for what he did.<eos> What exactly did he do?
But follow their lead.<eos> You got greedy, Chappy.<eos> You got greedy, and you killed Rick for that gold.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He was gonna split it with us.<eos> You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
Are you gonna have dinner at your desk again?<eos> Go have fun.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> Hey, got a package for you. Looks cool.<eos> Nice gun. Yes.<eos> I, uh, requested it from the Explorer's Club.<eos> It was found on the shipwreck that Rick discovered.<eos> I know. You know?<eos> Yeah, I read it on your Explorer's Cub journal here, right?<eos> They did a whole photo spread and everything.
He's not that cool.<eos> Uh, do you have somewhere we can go speak privately, away from your children?<eos> Yeah. Come on.<eos> It's what's called a pattern injury.<eos> It's of considerable forensic interest because one can precisely match the wound to the impacting instrument.<eos> Now, I'll be very happy to take your bracelet back to my lab to get an exact analysis.<eos> I hope you have a lawyer.<eos> I guess I did leave that mark.<eos> But I didn't kill her.<eos> Eddie did.
Hey. If you're thinking about taking a trip to Africa,<eos> I would recommend skipping Tanzania. They've just had a recent outbreak of dysentery.<eos> No, um, Isaac wants to take me on vacation.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, he doesn't waste any time, does he?<eos> Yeah, I think he's getting impatient with me.<eos> Having trouble narrowing down a place?<eos> No, it's just, things are... Well, they're moving so fast.<eos> And... you're afraid you don't like him?<eos> No, I-I-I'm afraid that I do.
Sheriff, the NYPD would be happy to help with this case.<eos> It's nice of you to offer, but without the proper paperwork, you know I can't really do that.<eos> Our O.C.M.E. has a state-of-the-art lab, which I'm guessing you don't have here.<eos> Plus, our presumed victim was a resident of New York City, so, technically, it is our case.<eos> You want a bunch of old bones?<eos> They're all yours.<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Think I just found something.<eos> I think we're going to love it here, Abraham.<eos> I really do.
I guess I got a little bit spooked by the lore of the knife.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> You don't believe in some mystical knife!<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Further proof... Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.
Where you going?<eos> I told you, hurry up!<eos> Taylor.<eos> What brings you back?<eos> My brother's funeral's tomorrow.<eos> I got just what you need.<eos> A little bit of down, and a whole lot of up.<eos> Why don't you come inside?<eos> Maybe next time.<eos> What kind of drug does that?
My Lord?<eos> Are we to hear any more evidence for the defence?<eos> - What is your name?<eos> My maid's name is Mary.<eos> 'What is your name?<eos> 'Mary Marriott, sir.<eos> 'Uh-huh. - 'And you are a bathing woman?<eos> - Yes, sir. '<eos> Do you know Sir Richard and Lady Worsley?<eos> Yes, I do.
But... though our friends are gone, you and I remain.<eos> And we must try to make our way in the present.<eos> Without them.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> This place is bringing my old friend Abigail back to me.<eos> I get the distinct feeling these memories have purpose.<eos> How is he alive?<eos> We saw him die on the battlefield.<eos> We saw him die.<eos> Nobody here did.
Dad, I need to see you.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Mom's coming too.<eos> Coming?<eos> To say good-bye.<eos> You have to do something.<eos> - I'll be back here with a court order.<eos> Our lawyers will have one too.<eos> Guess we all know what your word is worth, don't we, Detective?<eos> What did you do, Walt?
You know, I've got thousands of dollars worth of inventory rotting in that freezer.<eos> Over there!<eos> How have you kept your food cold with a broken freezer?<eos> We brought in 200 pounds of dry ice last night.<eos> Peter died of carbon dioxide poisoning.<eos> Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide.<eos> Oh, look who paid attention in chemistry.<eos> Oh, serious crush on my teacher, Mr. Brewer.<eos> That man knew his way around a Bunsen burner, if you know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
But in the end, I managed to buy 100% of his interest in Pied Piper.<eos> Let us never speak of him again.<eos> Well, that is fine by me, and I'm so glad you got him away from Pied Piper.<eos> I mean, now that their suit has been resolved, I think that they're about to become something really special.<eos> Their core technology, it's visionary.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right. Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
- All right.<eos> I'm gonna do one more, a little something here to cool down.<eos> Thank you, thank you.<eos> Really? She got to you too?<eos> You know, I always wondered why no one ever really thought through this whole "one of us, one of them" thing.<eos> I mean, think about it.<eos> Any Evo who turns on his own, can you ever really trust them?<eos> I trusted you.<eos> And I liked you, Noah.<eos> I still do.
Of course, we will make that possible.<eos> But first, we need more supplies and resources.<eos> Everything possible to help make sure that we have the best chance at survival.<eos> Thank you.<eos> A group of scientist were attacked under the arch by a Japanese girl.<eos> She's a tenacious little construct.<eos> Hunt it down and kill it.<eos> And bring me Otomo.<eos> How did you--how did you know that wasn't me?<eos> Oh, I didn't.
I'm okay.<eos> So sorry if I worried you guys, but when the train left without me,<eos> I couldn't get a signal, and there was nobody at the train station, and the office with the phone in it was locked.<eos> So I just started walking.<eos> I mean, I cried a little bit first, but all I could think was,<eos> I am gonna freeze to death out here, and my husband and my kids are trying to call me, and they can't reach me, and they're just gonna hold out hope until some soybean farmer finds my partially thawed corpse in the spring.<eos> Oh... my... God.<eos> You didn't even notice I was gone, did you?<eos> ! - What? - We were so worried.<eos> - I didn't...

What the hell is actually going on over there?<eos> Well, if you've read the after action reports...<eos> I have.<eos> Every one of them.<eos> A handful of enemy dead here.<eos> Another handful there.<eos> I honestly have no idea what it all adds up to.<eos> The program has been effective, sir.<eos> I believe it should be continued.<eos> You do?
Oh, Marianne.<eos> You're... You're a unique girl.<eos> And Roland may have a few flaws...<eos> Understatement.<eos> But he still loves you.<eos> -He loves the crown. -But...<eos> -And his hair.<eos> -But... -Not in that order.<eos> -But if not Roland, then there has to be someone else!<eos> No, there doesn't.
No?<eos> Not even Lieutenant Sutherland?<eos> Who?<eos> I... I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't know any Sutherland.<eos> He knows you.<eos> Told us all about you and your secret mission.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> I don't have any secrets.<eos> I don't. I don't.
Oh, no.<eos> ♪ I want you, I need you ♪<eos> ♪ You cut me, and I bleed you ♪<eos> ♪ You're like some kind of sonnet ♪<eos> ♪ All I want to do is read you ♪<eos> - ♪ And I love you ♪ - I know.<eos> - ♪ I mean I love you ♪<eos> - Yes. Thanks.<eos> - ♪ I said I love you ♪<eos> - You did.
Ow.<eos> Rough night?<eos> I don't remember what happened.<eos> You said her pretty brain exploded and went all over her face.<eos> And you tried to kiss her.<eos> You were a bit of a mess, sir.<eos> A big, hot mess.<eos> Well, that's the least of our problems.<eos> I think I might have ruined our only chance, and now I don't know what to do.<eos> Good thing I do.
Big scar running down the side of his face.<eos> Roberto Salvatore.<eos> It was only a matter of time before he turned up.<eos> You know him?<eos> He's camorristi, one of the higher ranks.<eos> I suspect he ordered Concetta's husband Fabrizi to burn down Nonna Luisa's restaurant.<eos> And I'm guessing he had an alibi for that.<eos> Several.<eos> Well, at least we know how this whole thing began.<eos> We do?
Why would Nonna Luisa take out £6 every Thursday?<eos> Wages?<eos> There were none.<eos> Only the family worked there.<eos> Shopping?<eos> That all came out of the restaurant account.<eos> This was her personal one.<eos> Another one of her secrets.<eos> What did you say you were up to last night?<eos> I didn't.
Josh is funny.<eos> And a considerate fellow. Never litters.<eos> Dad, does this mean you and Josh are married then?<eos> No, of course it doesn't.<eos> You've got dry hands.<eos> Give it a go.<eos> Oh, you've got really soft hands.<eos> - Can you just put it in the ice water?<eos> Cold will contract it. - Yeah, that's what we want.<eos> No, we don't.
It's this.<eos> This is a count of men, ships, and defenses in York City.<eos> - Put this in the drop along with Abigail's note. - Abe.<eos> No, Tallmadge will need to read both of these right away.<eos> - Take it.<eos> I have to go. - Abe.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm using Hewlett to get around Mary.<eos> She thinks I'm in New York studying the law.<eos> - Everyone does.
Oh, Major.<eos> What letter?<eos> Oh, to the Benedicts, a family in Lancaster with whom he wished to become acquainted.<eos> - Really? - Mm-hmm.<eos> Do you know the hour?<eos> What in God's name...?<eos> - Dr. Charles Hallum?<eos> - Uh... Sorry to interrupt, but you have something I need.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London. But I don't have it.<eos> I... I never did.
No.<eos> Did something happen to me?<eos> . They found me in an alley, in a suitcase?<eos> I don't remember that.<eos> So, Madison, what's the last thing that you do remember?<eos> Coming to the city to see Wicked.<eos> I live in Ronkonkoma. And you came by yourself?<eos> I was supposed to meet a girlfriend.<eos> (Benson) Supposed to?<eos> So you didn't?
Are you sure you don't need me to sleep with him?<eos> Or his brother or cousin or mom, dad?<eos> I thought you liked our games.<eos> Tonight just... Made me sick. Literally.<eos> So maybe you could just be a man, and get this done on your own, and not turn your wife into a geriatric whore.<eos> 'Cause I am so over it.<eos> ♪ No longer down, I'm moving up higher... ♪ You look good, Keem.<eos> Mature and so handsome.<eos> You know, you got to switch up your style sometime, you know what I'm saying?<eos> Yes, I do.
You will never find somebody who's gonna work harder for you than Cookie.<eos> Mm, that's not what you said about her before.<eos> I wish I didn't say that.<eos> And I'm hoping she'll forgive me.<eos> Oh, my love for you is unconditional, boy.<eos> Well, I want to be at Empire, but I want it to be how it was.<eos> You mean...<eos> You and me.<eos> Look, if she can forgive you, then... Maybe you can forgive me and we can be together again.<eos> I do...
Can we fix it?<eos> It's dead, monk.<eos> Mom's gonna be so mad.<eos> What do I do?<eos> Tell her the truth.<eos> She'll be angry you didn't take care of your phone, but she'll get over it.<eos> You know that.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I have to take responsibility.<eos> Yes, you do.
See, that's why I wouldn't worry if the tooth fairy's running a couple hours behind.<eos> Would you?<eos> Let's take one more peek and make sure that that sucker's still in there.<eos> Why don't I read you a book?<eos> Which one do you want?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.

Hi, guys.<eos> Kids, you're gonna give me a heart attack.<eos> Mommy, where's Daddy?<eos> He's, um...<eos> He's...<eos> He's not coming.<eos> - I told you.<eos> - Why isn't he coming?<eos> Daddy's not coming, Daddy's not coming.<eos> I didn't, um... I...
- It's OK.<eos> I shouldn't have taken you there.<eos> We used to come here, didn't we?<eos> I remember.<eos> I remember being sick... as well.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> I just... couldn't keep going with the chemo.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> - I should've kept fighting.<eos> - You did.
Yup. It's really great.<eos> So great.<eos> It's great.<eos> So great.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> No, I mean, if you're saying it's great, then it must be great, I just... you don't really seem like you're...<eos> I just wish that you wouldn't have inserted yourself into this situation.<eos> They had it all figured out.<eos> I didn't insert myself into anything.<eos> Yes, you kind of did.
Let's... wait.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What do you mean, people?<eos> I mean, you slept with...<eos> Okay, I did not mean to have... we don't have time for this conversation right now.<eos> Okay, right, right, but how many people?<eos> - Joel.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - It's... no, it's just... - Okay.<eos> But just for the record, I didn't...
I just...<eos> - next week? - Mm-hmm.<eos> I... I just want to make sure that, um... That my dad is there.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, we don't have to go anywhere.<eos> No, I want your dad there too.<eos> We'll do it next week.<eos> He's gonna be there. He's gonna be there.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I don't...
And I see it.<eos> I see it here.<eos> You love working here.<eos> I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while.<eos> And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
- Also a romantic comedy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Y-y-y-yeah, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Must love dogs.<eos> What?<eos> Uh... uh...<eos> It's a romantic comedy.<eos> Oh, I'll have to see that one.<eos> Yeah, oh, y-you definitely do.
No, I can't.<eos> Girls, I can't.<eos> Back off.<eos> Okay. I'm sorry, okay? I care...<eos> I care about this.<eos> Okay? We can't help it.<eos> We find you irresistible.<eos> You...<eos> I can't believe you guys think I'm handsome.<eos> We don't.
- Ivan Vaughan?<eos> - Yes.<eos> And I am telling you, it is gonna happen for you.<eos> - Okay, I-I don't want you to give up on the...<eos> Oh, my gosh.<eos> Joseph.<eos> Hi.<eos> [Sighs] I know things got off to a bad start with us.<eos> But... I still feel like we have a chance.<eos> - You do?
Oh, and on the back, he also has inscribed my favorite Bible verse,<eos> John 8:12.<eos> Oh, did he?<eos> "I am the light of the world."<eos> You are to me, baby.<eos> You are to me.<eos> You know, I am going to go and put this beautiful necklace on right now.<eos> Oh, you outdid yourself, padre.<eos> Come here.<eos> You sure did, padre.
Okay, seriously?<eos> All it takes is one pair of high heels to ruin those.<eos> What exactly did you say when he started freaking out?<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> The landlord asked for the security deposit, and he just started losing it.<eos> An entire month's rent?<eos> I'm sorry, but I don't feel very "secure"<eos> just giving away money I might not get back.<eos> Oh, you definitely won't get it back, bro.<eos> Nobody does.
Why aren't you dressed?<eos> I'm not going to school.<eos> - Are you sick?<eos> - No.<eos> Does this have to do with Callie?<eos> No, this doesn't have anything to do with Callie.<eos> There are other things going on in my life, you know.<eos> I'm protesting.<eos> In case you've forgot, you fired my favorite teacher yesterday.<eos> I didn't...
That we're adopting the baby.<eos> Hey, uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you shut the door?<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> Um... [clears throat] ... I... saw Ana at my dad's.<eos> Moms aren't gonna take her baby.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - No, I don't think she knows yet.<eos> Or maybe she does.
I don't like the way this lady's looking at you.<eos> Louis Huang... Are you jealous?<eos> I don't have to be jealous.<eos> It's everybody else who should be jealous... of me.<eos> I got the best one.<eos> But I am also the hottest one.<eos> Yes, you are also the hottest one.<eos> - The pizza party? !<eos> - Oh, my gosh, Eddie. You won?<eos> No, Cindy Horowitz did.
I'm rehabilitated.<eos> I don't drink or drug no more like before.<eos> For real.<eos> Look.<eos> Clean and sober.<eos> I'm thrilled for you.<eos> Bomb at City Park.<eos> Got your old bosses written all over it.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
Well, anyway, you want your cut or no?<eos> I'm the one cutting you in, David.<eos> That means we play by my rules.<eos> What am I... your charity case?<eos> I look after you.<eos> What if Abigail had turned on that kid's family?<eos> You want another situation like what happened in Memphis?<eos> - Stop it.<eos> - Look, okay, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't...
(sighs) That's how it is, isn't it?<eos> You always think there's one more peanut butter left.<eos> (walkers growling)<eos> (car approaching)<eos> Morgan.<eos> Maybe we just leave him here.<eos> That's not who you are.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't.
I stopped him.<eos> We have a good hour until we have 'em to green when we hand them off to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.<eos> Why don't you head back, tell everyone what's happening?<eos> - They should know.<eos> - Okay, Rick, I just--<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I'll take care of that one.<eos> Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.

Finch, get out on your... Balcony.<eos> Now.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yes, I do, or someone else will get hurt.<eos> Someone whose life still matters.<eos> No, your life matters.<eos> No.<eos> No, it doesn't.
Maybe you don't know this, but babies come with many hassles.<eos> Oh, and you could come visit at any time you wanted.<eos> No?<eos> Okay. Scheduled visits.<eos> That's...<eos> No.<eos> Please never let this moment end.<eos> - Do you have your video recording device?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- All right,<eos> I'm gonna get some work done now.<eos> This has been very interesting.<eos> She doesn't even want it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'll try that.<eos> Um, so, look, I mean, you probably don't even want the baby.<eos> I want the baby, Doug.<eos> Okay, well, I know you have to say that in front of people, but between you and me...<eos> You do.
When's it my turn to be taken care of?<eos> You know what?<eos> Today.<eos> Today's my turn.<eos> I'm going to get absolutely snozzelled.<eos> Well, this is leading towards something dangerously misguided.<eos> We'll see how she likes taking care of me for a change.<eos> You probably don't want to get to "Level Two Jimmy drunk"<eos> around all these people.<eos> Or maybe I do.
Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Would you like me to unpack your case for you, Laura?<eos> Er...<eos> No, no.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Salim Sadik?<eos> Hey, I'm looking for this synth.<eos> Oh, when did you bring it in?<eos> I didn't.
Vince, just do it.<eos> Nathan, this won't work.<eos> You won't work.<eos> Why? To power the barn you need Aether activated in living form, me.<eos> I need more for the huge power necessary for a barn.<eos> The Aether needs a catalyst, a complementary energy to supercharge it.<eos> The same energy it has always needed, love.<eos> The energy it needed when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.<eos> - I... - You do not have that.<eos> I do.
And I won't be coming back this time.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> What do you have to be sorry for?<eos> Leaving you.<eos> I wanted us to have more time.<eos> We'll always want more time.<eos> The trick will be being thankful for the time we had.<eos> We had an amazing time.<eos> Yeah, we did.
I wish you were here to do that now.<eos> For I have made choices, my dear, that are best radical and at worst...<eos> Lorenzo de'Medici...<eos> Count Riario.<eos> Have you come here to kill me?<eos> Do you really believe that that will rekindle the momentum of your doomed Crusade?<eos> I am not here to kill but to confess.<eos> To repent for my sins.<eos> Your wife was not murdered by a Turk assassin.<eos> I did it.
Boost your immunity, help your wounds heal faster.<eos> And we got you some chicken livers kidneys, packed with iron.<eos> Get those red blood cells pumping.<eos> And to top it off, a Châteauneuf-du-Pape Grenache blanc.<eos> Please. Please, don't.<eos> Mmm.<eos> Shut up.<eos> This is just the thing to get your bodies to absorb all these nutrients.<eos> Stop. Stop. Stop.<eos> Don't.
You're being a pain in the ass.<eos> Somebody has to milk the cows.<eos> Besides, I'll be back in...<eos> a couple hours.<eos> I don't wanna be on the farm by myself.<eos> It freaks me out.<eos> Franny, you're 12 years old.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> Besides, I don't really have much of a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.
That's my bag.<eos> Don't!<eos> What the hell did you just do?<eos> That had my money in it.<eos> You had no right to do that.<eos> No?<eos> At least we're not dead.<eos> Maybe you might wanna tell me where all that money came from?<eos> No. I don't owe you an explanation for anything.<eos> Yes, you do.
And she was into hard stuff.<eos> But that's the Lotts. I mean, they think they're above the law.<eos> But sooner or later, Ronnie would've got arrested.<eos> So I went down there to put a stop to it.<eos> When I got there, I realized... she was trying to kill herself.<eos> She had a gun.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I believe you.<eos> But you don't, do you?
You know.<eos> Every day.<eos> You?<eos> I keep asking myself... was it 'cause of the virus... or was the virus just an excuse?<eos> You're not thinking of doing the same thing, are you, Gord?<eos> I couldn't do that to you.<eos> Then drive me into town.<eos> It was the Creekers.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> You do? How?
I'm totally fine.<eos> Now will you please help me with this before I poke my eye out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Now I'm nervous.<eos> Breathe. [Breathes deeply]<eos> - It's gonna go great tonight. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Why are you being so nice to me?<eos> Because you're letting me. [Chuckles]<eos> (Kevin) Nobody knows what they're saying.<eos> (Lolly) Yes, I totally do.
So far.<eos> I'm sure you have.<eos> You got this cool, new job.<eos> They're lucky to have somebody so dedicated and smart.<eos> That viral marketing idea, very clever.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Hey, let me ask you a weird question.<eos> How'd you know I liked apricot jam?<eos> Everybody likes apricot jam.<eos> No, they don't.
No, wait.<eos> I don't care.<eos> You sent Louie Becker to spy on Taylor?<eos> I wanted to prove she was sleeping around, but I never heard from him again.<eos> The next morning...<eos> - His leg was on Evelyn's lawn. - Yeah.<eos> I can't see Taylor chopping up a body and throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> - Katy does.
And?<eos> What'd you see?<eos> I saw through her eyes.<eos> She went outside, down the street, and then...<eos> I know where she was taken from.<eos> The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You wore it when you got married?<eos> We all done.
There's a chance.<eos> I found something.<eos> Mark, Mark. The reason we can't find the Castor samples is because Johanssen used them, to make a clone.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> He and his wife.<eos> They used the original tissue to make a son.<eos> We find him, we get a bit of DNA, that's all we need.<eos> Did he ever mention a son?<eos> He did, didn't he?
How do you know about that?<eos> We took care of Helena, spent time with her.<eos> She said it was you that shot her.<eos> The more reason I'm doing this.<eos> You know, it's not her fault, the way she is.<eos> She's not a monster, she was just...<eos> Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
Fuss, brother?<eos> Fuss is knocked out, but it's OK.<eos> Quit laughing, man!<eos> What do you have to do there?<eos> It's just a meeting.<eos> - Go right? - Yes, right.<eos> Dude, she got it!<eos> Just tell her she's safe, OK? Shut the fuck up.<eos> I took care of that, wanker.<eos> Yeah, man, Boxer, he really did.
I know that.<eos> Okay, so then why are you being so selective?<eos> 'Cause you know dad and I will pick up the slack?<eos> Honey, you have to have a plan.<eos> Musicians don't have traditional trajectories.<eos> I know that.<eos> And I love that you get to do what you love.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it doesn't sound like you're supporting me at all.<eos> Oh, God, you didn't?
'Cause it doesn't sound like you're supporting me at all.<eos> Oh, God, you didn't?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> What did you even say to her?<eos> I just wanted to make sure she was aware of the challenges...<eos> You used my deafness?<eos> She needed to know your story.<eos> She knows I'm deaf.<eos> But she probably doesn't know the extent of the extra challenges you face.<eos> She does.
- You're kidding me?<eos> - Fancy a go?<eos> I would literally never forgive myself if I said no.<eos> Wait right there.<eos> Where is he?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't even know who to call.<eos> I have no idea who I even...<eos> You need to pull it together.<eos> If you shot an armed intruder, this is going to get hairy.<eos> But you didn't do anything wrong.
Elizabeth takes things hard.<eos> I know that.<eos> For your friend Kimberly.<eos> Afghani?<eos> Appropriately enough.<eos> Very strong.<eos> It's one of the ironies of this work that so many lives depend upon one man's relationship with an adolescent girl.<eos> You don't like that.<eos> She's 15 years old.<eos> Do you?
No, no. No, no.<eos> This is... this is it, though.<eos> Consulting at its best.<eos> Very spirited exchange of ideas.<eos> This is how we take a great company like yours and push it to be even greater.<eos> I mean, this, all of this, we-we hope this demonstrates how Kaan and Associates can help your company to really reach its apotheosis.<eos> So, let's just do this.<eos> Let's regroup tomorrow, and we will present you with our very detailed brand strategy.<eos> I think... I-I think you're going to be amazed.<eos> I really do.
I tell people, 'cause there's a tendency to creep up on 'em...<eos> I just said I know all about it.<eos> Doug...<eos> Like that.<eos> It's happening already.<eos> He's not listening, you know?<eos> Doug,<eos> I don't even like absinthe, and I will drink anything that makes me forget.<eos> Do you know what Oscar Wilde said about absinthe?<eos> I do.
Didn't end too well for them.<eos> After everything you've seen, after everything you've been through, you still doubt.<eos> How many miracles are you gonna have to witness before you believe?<eos> We're not talking about miracles.<eos> We're talking about you.<eos> Why do you refuse to accept what you've seen with your own eyes...<eos> That we shared a vision?<eos> - I don't know what that was.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> In your heart, you do.
- Did you?<eos> - Robin...<eos> I'm glad that you have your glasses back.<eos> You may express your gratitude by leaving me in peace.<eos> Look, there are some of us, we want to get out of here.<eos> We want to make a break for it, but we need to get organized.<eos> I know you can help.<eos> Don't you want to get out of here?<eos> No.<eos> I do not.
- Hey, there he is, big daddy boden.<eos> Where's mills and brett?<eos> - Oh, they're tied up.<eos> I mean, not literally, of course.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> - They're at chicago pd.<eos> What's the latest with terrance?<eos> - Uh... Still on the machine.<eos> - Hey, uh... You want to hear How dawson found brett and mills?<eos> - Yeah, yeah i do.
It doesn't make sense that Allen would risk hurting Brenda.<eos> He values her too much.<eos> Reid said he was legitimately scared at his house.<eos> You can't fake fear like that.<eos> The bomb in Archer's truck was planted by somebody else.<eos> A second unsub.<eos> Do you think Allen pissed off a partner who decided to take him out?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> We know you planted the bomb at the coffee shop because you wanted to be a hero, but you had nothing to do with the one at your house last night.<eos> Who did?
- I'm fucking serious, Ricky.<eos> So am I. No more fucking around, okay?<eos> Babe, I promise.<eos> Good, and now you have this to remind you what an amazing and forgiving woman I am.<eos> That I do, okay? I'll cherish this.<eos> This thing must have cost you a fortune.<eos> Oh, no, baby, when it comes to our love, money is no object.<eos> And I used your Black Card to buy it.<eos> Have a great day.<eos> You did...?
You gonna lie to Mama like that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hey, you think I'm too heavy?<eos> No, Charles.<eos> I think you're burly.<eos> Robust.<eos> Fancy-ass words for fat.<eos> Baby, I think you're perfect.<eos> You know I love that sexy body.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you?
No.<eos> This was well before we met.<eos> How is she?<eos> Well, when Sam showed back up,<eos> I, uh...<eos> I thought it best if we take some time.<eos> I've been through this before with my ex-wife, and I, uh...<eos> I just didn't want Lauren getting hurt because of me.<eos> Do you really think this is someone that I know?<eos> Yeah, we do.
It's called "empathy," Ted.<eos> How 'bout that?<eos> We're all damaged, Ted.<eos> Tawney just got an extra dose.<eos> This one's a runner.<eos> I was abused.<eos> I'm damaged goods.<eos> Lord, they pick up on them labels, don't they?<eos> Yes, ma'am. Little pitchers have big ears.<eos> They still do.
I'm paying you for this extra work, too.<eos> It won't take but a few hours.<eos> That's not even up for discussion.<eos> I did it, Melvin.<eos> What?<eos> The paint.<eos> Last night.<eos> The can... Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
Because you said that I could trust you. I know.<eos> You promised.<eos> - You did nothing.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I was ten years old!<eos> Too petrified to sleep.<eos> Do you know what happens to someone, when they don't sleep?<eos> - To their mind?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do?
- Boyd!<eos> - Katherine.<eos> Oh. Uh, ripping you off ... that was her idea from the jump ... payback for you murdering her husband. I just, uh...<eos> I just thought you ought to know.<eos> Whoo!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Oh!<eos> Baby, it's me! Oh, baby!<eos> Do you really think I had Grady murdered?<eos> I did.
Well, I called it in, made sure they knew you were emergent.<eos> You handcuffed me to a bumper, you left me there without so much as a fare-thee-well.<eos> You could hear the sirens on their way.<eos> Must have given you some solace.<eos> I don't suppose you've come to tell me you've found her.<eos> I found her truck some down the road, abandoned.<eos> No sign beyond.<eos> Gotta suck, be that close to the prize, have it shot out of your hand.<eos> - I kinda know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
- Nonsense.<eos> He's in love.<eos> He's scared to take the plunge.<eos> You have to help him.<eos> I must intimidate him.<eos> Dad, in love?<eos> No.<eos> Yes.<eos> He told me so.<eos> Not explicitely, but he did.
He'll see you, now.<eos> I see why they call them Rat People<eos> - Who else would live down here?<eos> - There's not much choice without a Company job.<eos> They spend their whole lives down here.<eos> I don't see Alvis.<eos> - Alvis couldn't make it. He's...<eos> - I know where he is, Auntie.<eos> It still doesn't explain why I should trust you.<eos> Because Alvis does.
What complaint?<eos> This one.<eos> You're suing me for your little tiff with Zachary?<eos> Or is this just your way of getting back at me for not hiring you?<eos> I'm not the one suing you.<eos> I'm just the investigator.<eos> Who's suing me?<eos> Barlow Connally.<eos> Frankly, I don't care...<eos> No, I don't!
Turns out he was at the debate tournament at the time of Rebecca's murder.<eos> But I've got something on the Max Rager front.<eos> I've been digging in Rebecca's phone records.<eos> Jackson and Richmond aren't people. They're cities.<eos> Richmond was a woman whose daughter was doing a double at a burger joint, when she threw fry oil all over some loudmouth customers.<eos> No history of vience.<eos> She just lost it.<eos> Like Jason.<eos> Rebecca asked mom if Fry Girl drank Max Rager.<eos> She did. Tons of it.
- marking them.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> But for what?<eos> Wes, slow down.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I'm at the hospital.<eos> Minx has the same thing Henry does.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. She have a fever?<eos> It's not just her.<eos> They all do.
- They're convicts.<eos> - They're iPads on sticks.<eos> As someone that got paid to keep people out, let me tell you.<eos> Hey guys, I'm moon walking.<eos> Not every bad guy ends up in prison, and not every prisoner is a bad guy.<eos> - Who's this guy?<eos> - 300,000!<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Jeffrey you know, ordinarily I'd do anything you say.<eos> Do it.
I haven't exactly been a whirlwind of entertainment since Troy left.<eos> That's not true.<eos> It's not just me, you guys have been boring too.<eos> Okay.<eos> I just gotta ask.<eos> What was so special about this Troy person?<eos> Did he own a rainbow?<eos> Was he the group's pharmacist?<eos> We don't like to talk about it.<eos> But you often do.
Britta, this is my boss.<eos> From Honda?<eos> In public you'll refer to us as Hilary from now on.<eos> Continue.<eos> There's a program we can be in, where we covertly market as a team, we can be a couple in a relationship in public.<eos> We can walk down the street holding hands.<eos> If I take a job tricking people into buying things they don't want.<eos> Do you enjoy billboards and commercials, Miss Perry?<eos> You mean shill-boards and con-mercials?<eos> No, I don't.
And now?<eos> Spielberg is calling.<eos> Not you know, I don't go by phone calls.<eos> I go by contracts.<eos> But Spielberg is interested in you for The Color Blue.<eos> In the new Play Dough movie, is that right?<eos> Maybe, you know, maybe.<eos> But like I always say, you know, life is a roller coaster.<eos> You were a teacher at a community college in Colorado.<eos> Did you just...
Hi Starburns.<eos> Todd, you know you don't have to creep around to be weird, right?<eos> You're weird at picnics.<eos> Did you hear about the paintball game?<eos> Yeah, I heard there was no paintball.<eos> I heard it was banned.<eos> Well, you can't believe everything you hear.<eos> Okay, you just asked if I heard something and now you're invalidating the whole.<eos> Do you know why I beat you, Todd?<eos> Seriously, you don't?
We self destruct like this because we'd rather be heroes than villains than just kind of sucky people, that need to work a lot at getting less sucky.<eos> She will forgive us.<eos> I know her, I like her, and if she fires either of you, I'll quit.<eos> She's not the enemy, she can help us.<eos> We just have to cool it.<eos> It's true, what he said.<eos> If you guys lower your guns, I'm not gonna throw you a party, but I'm not going to get anyone fired either.<eos> I'll see you Monday, idiots.<eos> So who wins?<eos> What do we-.
Son, just tell us what you talked about, that's all.<eos> I just said the level one entry into the abandoned warehouse was too easy to find.<eos> There should be a hidden entrance.<eos> And he responded to you?<eos> He said, "Okay"" And then what happened?<eos> He changed the game.<eos> I assume it's bad he was talking to the game designer?<eos> Ralph made a suggestion that helped modify the game.<eos> Do you know how that's gonna look to Eckherd when he finds out?<eos> Ralph did nothing wrong.
You know, it's been so long, at this point, maybe we should just float it to next year.<eos> That's what we did last year. Ugh!<eos> We're treating him like a leap-year baby.<eos> Sue's birthday...<eos> that's coming up, too!<eos> Oh, seriously, why do we have two birthdays so close together?<eos> We didn't.<eos> Brick, listen... Um, I don't even know if you're aware of this, but, um, it's come to my attention that it's possible we might have missed your birthday.<eos> Oh, you did.<eos> You definitely did.
I can't even believe she's here!<eos> Hey, it's cool.<eos> We all got a past.<eos> Honestly, I would not have pegged her as your type.<eos> But I did date an eagle scout who once wore all 40 badges on a date, so, yeah, no need to be embarrassed about it.<eos> Uh, I'm not embarrassed about dating her, 'cause I never dated her!<eos> Stop talking.<eos> She could be listening.<eos> I can't believe we forgot Brick's birthday.<eos> We do this all the time, and now we did it on his 13th birthday.
This is called G.O.R.A.P.<eos> It stands for "good old raisins and peanuts."<eos> Some people call it "gorp," but that's incorrect, because they're forgetting about the "and."<eos> It's not a sexy food.<eos> It's just for energy.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, you smell clean.<eos> I suppose you washed your genitals real nice for her?<eos> - Carol, come on. - Phil.<eos> Yes, I did.
- Stop.<eos> - Nothing.<eos> - What? - Oh, hey.<eos> Can I borrow your DVR?<eos> I've watched everything on mine.<eos> Okay, but this one only has Cake Bosses on it.<eos> Okay, great. - Spoiler alert...<eos> - Oh, no, no, I don't want to...<eos> - The cake...<eos> - Don't.
Enjoy your youth while you can, kid.<eos> One day you'll blink... you'll be me.<eos> You know, I hate to spoil your moment of self-reflection, but what we did to you wore off hours ago.<eos> Your heroics out here-- that was all you.<eos> You don't say.<eos> I protected the president once.<eos> Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year. You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Thank you for allowing me to feel useful again.<eos> I wish I could say I wouldn't forget it, but, uh...<eos> There's advancements in neurological science every year. You never know.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> And so do you.<eos> Make as many great memories as you can.<eos> 'Cause at the end of the day, we don't get to decide the ones we keep, huh?<eos> Lorraine?<eos> !<eos> H-How did you...?
No, we're both sworn to secrecy.<eos> You understand that this disqualifies you?<eos> Yes, I understand that.<eos> I'll have to remove you from all cases involving the Security Service.<eos> - I can determine...<eos> - It's for your own good.<eos> There, that's settled.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Do you believe him? - Yes.<eos> I do.
And I appreciate that, Detective, but, still, this doesn't add up.<eos> What could possibly be the connection?<eos> Well, that's the million dollar question, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Well, that was fun.<eos> Thank God you covered.<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> Actually, you did.
Why didn't you wake me?<eos> My God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Kelly got close, Eph.<eos> Setrakian thinks the Master has made her one of the more<eos> - sentient strigoi.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> I'm pretty sure Zack saw her.<eos> You need to talk to him.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Now what am I gonna do?<eos> What do you mean what are you gonna do?<eos> Sofia, last night I was freaking out that Josh was getting married because I had feelings for him.<eos> Yeah, and then Cooper came in and swept you off your feet, and now you're back together with Cooper.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But then Josh, he called off his wedding because of me!<eos> Which means he has feelings for me!<eos> For me!<eos> Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no.<eos> No, it doesn't.
What the hell is going on, Sean?<eos> Everyone's dead but us.<eos> We lost the captain.<eos> We're all alone.<eos> There's no answer from the base at faslane.<eos> How we gonna get home?<eos> Sean!<eos> We'll get home, bruv.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
I did not know his men were going to do this.<eos> We got on that ship, and suddenly they started killing everyone for no reason.<eos> Commander's brother... he started it.<eos> Way I saw it, you were shooting at my men.<eos> They would have killed me if I hadn't, sir.<eos> Dios mío, this is an insane world.<eos> I thought I was joining with this group for my own security, not to kill innocent civilians.<eos> Trust me.<eos> - Where's the sub now? Where'd he go?<eos> - I don't...
There were times when I hated Mootaek.<eos> I wanted to go to the summit too.<eos> But you always chose Mootaek.<eos> Each time I reproached myself.<eos> Is it because I'm a woman?<eos> Am I not good enough?<eos> Myung-ae, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know you felt that way.<eos> I always appreciated your dedication...<eos> Mootaek did too.
I'm an idiot.<eos> There's obviously nothing going on between Riley and Danny.<eos> So, I just wanted to apologize for the other night on the roof.<eos> Kinda caught me by surprise.<eos> Oh, no need to apologize.<eos> I shouldn't have sprung it on you like that.<eos> Oh, no, no, no, no.<eos> It had just been a really emotional day.<eos> The big "I love Ben" announcement.<eos> And you really do, right?
I didn't know what else to do.<eos> I saw the two of you on the roof the other night.<eos> And what did you see?<eos> Two friends who were upset that they were gonna be apart?<eos> Two friends who were worried about each other's future?<eos> Well, yeah, that's one perspective.<eos> It just seems like you have feelings for each other.<eos> And you're right.<eos> We do.<eos> We do?
Super.<eos> God, okay, final offer, ten thousand baht, some of which has blood on it.<eos> For the millionth and last time, we do not have mini-bottles!<eos> Well, then this isn't a real airline.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> It's a CIA front!<eos> Still, though.<eos> Why don't you go read the damn dossier?<eos> Read about the communist insurgency.<eos> I don't do dossiers.
We don't have anything.<eos> You have a situation.<eos> I am going home to Japan!<eos> Well unless you wanna swim there-- which, spoiler alert, you can't, it's too far-- you're gonna need my help!<eos> Ha!<eos> Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs, in addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake, on which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- And if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> Because... you'd have no idea what you're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
Which way to the extraction point?<eos> Uh... I guess head for the beach?<eos> Well?<eos> Yeah, it's nice, although, I assumed there'd be a bar.<eos> You said this was the extraction point.<eos> Uh, no, I merely implied that.<eos> I have no idea where it is.<eos> Although...<eos> Ah, so you did know.<eos> No, I totally didn't.
What the fuck?<eos> I just want to talk to him.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Stop with the asshole routine.<eos> He fucking misquoted my book, like, three times in print.<eos> - He's an undergrad. - So what?<eos> He needs to take responsibility for what he puts in his fucking paper.<eos> Oh, my God, stop being this guy.<eos> You are not this guy. I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
All is ready.<eos> All right.<eos> Matches.<eos> Say your piece.<eos> You forbid Mei to work.<eos> No women on the railroad, plain and simple.<eos> The men will ask questions.<eos> I'll keep a tight lip, but that's as far as I go with this.<eos> Now light the damn fuse.<eos> She does good work.
They're called Leporem Venators.<eos> There's something to be proud of.<eos> If these Willahara are still being hunted by the Leporem Venators, then maybe the car accident that Peter's father died in wasn't an accident.<eos> - See what you can find out.<eos> - I'll hop right on it.<eos> I tried to stop myself before I said it, sorry.<eos> This is happening in Portland?<eos> Well, if this has anything to do with Wesen fertility, I'll bet you Monroe and Rosalee know something about it.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Do we?
Excuse me?<eos> We just had a few more questions.<eos> I was very clear.<eos> Wait for the text.<eos> We were just wondering if you could tell us... Yeah... you know... where the feet come from?<eos> No, I'm sorry, I can't.<eos> Wait, I need to know something.<eos> What?<eos> How much of that blood money do you get?<eos> Oh, no, you don't.
We can't let him have the power.<eos> Max.<eos> No, don't fight it.<eos> Let it happen.<eos> What? !<eos> It's our last chance to try. Our last chance to save Max.<eos> What's the point of saving him?<eos> We're never getting out of here. Leo.<eos> We don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.
Fight through it.<eos> Don't let it control you.<eos> I could've killed you.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> Maybe next time, you should just kill me first.<eos> After you get cut, do you really not remember anything?<eos> It's not even me.<eos> It is, it's just a part of you you don't want to face.<eos> How can I control it?<eos> You don't.
- Not this again.<eos> Passage up the river, a map through the wasteland, and nothing left to lose.<eos> Sunny, listen to me.<eos> There is no through the wasteland.<eos> There's just death and drought and more death, and you sure as shit don't need a map to find it.<eos> I'm leaving, Waldo, with Veil.<eos> She's pregnant.<eos> So what?<eos> I imagine I've got a dozen pups pissing on posts around here.<eos> Every Clipper does.
I won't.<eos> The other offer's still on the table if you change your mind.<eos> You know I'm a lot more persuasive when I get what I want.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't able to get to Angelica in time.<eos> I'm sure you did everything in your power to help her.<eos> You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, Mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
But I could be saved.<eos> Please.<eos> Show me how to get back to you.<eos> Kneel.<eos> Are you willing to renounce all material possessions?<eos> I am.<eos> Will you rededicate yourself to a spiritual path?<eos> I will.<eos> Do you promise never to leave again?<eos> I do.
There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> He's a psychic.<eos> There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Oh, I'm just taking a little look around, thinking about membership.<eos> Is that supposed to be amusing?<eos> Mr. Peterson, this man said that he was from your office.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> It's fine, Stacey.<eos> Stacey, Mr. Peterson and I go way back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How was your little trip down to Rio Bravo?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Of course I do.
I can't do it with the phone.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'd like to speak to Cho, please.<eos> Sure.<eos> What's up?<eos> Something's obviously going on, and I'm here to protest my exclusion.<eos> Vega.<eos> Jane is planning something, and I'm pretty sure it has to do with whatever's going on with Abbott.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I do, though.
Norman. Don't lie to me!<eos> Norman... What game are we playing today, Mother?<eos> I didn't kill Annika!<eos> I drove her into town!<eos> I know, Norman. I know.<eos> I know. I know too, Mother.<eos> I know too, because I remember everything about that night.<eos> I've gone over and over it a thousand times in my head.<eos> I didn't black out.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.
I didn't kill Annika!<eos> I drove her into town!<eos> I know, Norman. I know.<eos> I know. I know too, Mother.<eos> I know too, because I remember everything about that night.<eos> I've gone over and over it a thousand times in my head.<eos> I didn't black out.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I did not.
You're a man.<eos> I'm a woman, so maybe you notice my breasts once in a while.<eos> Big deal. It's freaking normal.<eos> It doesn't mean you're weird or that there's anything wrong with you.<eos> - It doesn't?<eos> - No!<eos> What makes us not animals is that we make choices.<eos> You can't help what you think, what your impulses are.<eos> We all have crazy ones.<eos> I do.
You think I'm the bad guy, but I think you may be much worse than me.<eos> Oh, and don't slip and fall into your pool.<eos> You might never get out.<eos> Nice plan you put together.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> We're lucky we got away with our lives.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> - You know what happened.<eos> - No, I don't.
It's here.<eos> The music's coming from the other side of this wall.<eos> We need to breach this wall.<eos> You do you, Junior.<eos> It wasn't a question.<eos> ♪ Am I beautiful ♪ - Clear. - ♪ Even at my ugliest, you always say ♪<eos> Clear.<eos> ♪ I'm beautiful ♪ We found Rentman's tree house, uh, a bunker under, uh...<eos> Who knows?<eos> I do.
Hey, what are you doing?<eos> We don't have time for that.<eos> You can have soup after I clean your ear, but then you have to go.<eos> Beautiful point.<eos> Can we play?<eos> I'm gonna be late for work.<eos> Just one game.<eos> How about that shower now?<eos> I see you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Did you tell him that?<eos> I went to the funeral.<eos> I told him that Tenea got jacked up by somebody in the department.<eos> I mean, she was carrying a misdemeanor weight, got a felony charge, and did felony time.<eos> - Criolla made it happen?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I told him it had to be a superior.<eos> I guess Suger just connected the dots.<eos> All the way to the murder.<eos> Raffi, did you...
Well, I didn't know where tonight was gonna lead us and that we'd be out here, off the grid.<eos> Oh, no service!<eos> - Everything okay? - Yeah.<eos> I... you know, it has been a lovely adventure, hasn't it?<eos> But should we head back and truffle up our dinner?<eos> We could, or...<eos> I know a fantastic hot spring about 15 minutes up the road.<eos> We could hike.<eos> Oh, well, we don't have our bathing suits.<eos> Neither did Adam and Eve.
It is possible to buy more here.<eos> So why did you call me, not mom?<eos> Mom doesn't pick out my shirts.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You mean as of tonight when I'm doing it instead?<eos> I don't have great taste.<eos> So what?<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
I remember the deal that we made with Victor, the deal that you forced me to make, saying we had access to Alex's car, his phone,<eos> - his computer...<eos> - We had no other option.<eos> You could have let me turn myself in.<eos> And destroy our family?<eos> That's not a choice you get to make.<eos> We get what the SVR needs, or they go after Alex directly.<eos> What words do you need me to say, Mark?<eos> That I didn't cheat on you?<eos> I didn't.
_<eos> He's with two federal agents.<eos> How are they going to grab him?<eos> Carefully.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Use force against U.S. federal agents in their own country?<eos> This is a line Moscow has never crossed.<eos> I don't think you understand the stakes, Victor.<eos> I do.
Daddy needs a little hair of the dog.<eos> Sorry, pal, party's over.<eos> Mr. Anderson requested his boat for the afternoon, so you and your friends are gonna have to leave.<eos> What friends?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi, Joe-Joe.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Do you have an iPhone 4 charger?<eos> No, I don't.
Do we renovate our way to a better future?<eos> There's work to do.<eos> Use this to cover costs.<eos> What kind of work?<eos> If he didn't tell you, I can't.<eos> So I'm just supposed to trust-<eos> You. Yes.<eos> Why would you in the future endanger you in the now?<eos> That makes no sense.<eos> No, it doesn't, does it?
Clear.<eos> Move.<eos> Don't move!<eos> Identify yourself!<eos> Do it slowly.<eos> Get back up in here!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> He's out!<eos> You really think you're worth it?<eos> Somebody does.
Vasquez!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Everyone, get out!<eos> Time's up.<eos> This place is a write-off.<eos> Like my dream of going home.<eos> You can't give up now.<eos> We don't have Brad.<eos> Well, apparently we never did.
He got a money order for cash.<eos> - Maybe it's some sort of payoff.<eos> - The same day he was killed?<eos> The same day Jay Butler disappeared.<eos> Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - with the males carrying the eggs?<eos> - Oh.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- A what?<eos> A swamp spirit from Slavic folklore.<eos> - It was supposed to be temporary.<eos> - It's not?<eos> Korsak keeps finding ways to tell me I've screwed up.<eos> It's been redrawn a bunch of times.<eos> How long have you had it?<eos> - [Elevator bell dings] Six months.<eos> - Oh, my god. We should all know better than to bet with Korsak.<eos> Well, I do now. Yeah.
- Actually, two paintings.<eos> The x-Ray revealed a second painting underneath the forged image.<eos> And the bottom painting is authentic.<eos> - Like a hundred years old?<eos> - More like 150.<eos> That's pretty common.<eos> An older canvas makes the work seem authentic.<eos> Easier to pass off.<eos> - So this guy knew his stuff.<eos> - They usually do.
You think she was followed?<eos> Well... even if she was guilty, Susie was smart.<eos> She wouldn't want a criminal to know where she lived.<eos> I mean, she had to have been followed from somewhere.<eos> But there was no sign of forced entry.<eos> A-And she never would've let someone in she didn't trust.<eos> No. And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.<eos> Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.<eos> Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.<eos> Nobody does.
Frankie recanvassed the crime scene and the dorm but didn't find the phone itself.<eos> Did you subpoena the carrier for the phone records? Yeah.<eos> Still waiting.<eos> If...<eos> - Oh, it's from Winston.<eos> - Hmm.<eos> "I'd ri..." Oh, Winston's the naughty.<eos> Yeah. Mm-hmm.<eos> - God, I love cowboys.<eos> - Who doesn't?
- All right, I'll try her cell.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Uh, we need to talk.<eos> What is wrong?<eos> There was a meeting ...<eos> me, Maura, Mom.<eos> And Mom has decided that she should move in with me so that you can live with Maura.<eos> - Okay. That works.<eos> - No, no, no!<eos> It does not!
You know, if you're going to the airport... you are gonna pay extra for this one.<eos> - I'm not going anywhere.<eos> - The jewels are traveling alone?<eos> Given all that's been happening,<eos> I thought it best to close up and secure the inventory.<eos> You never told us you were dating Ten Mohs.<eos> - A lot of people dated Ten Mohs.<eos> - Yes, but Karina was a threat.<eos> She loved him.<eos> - So did you.
You better hide your secret tiny, tiny porn.<eos> Um... Wow. You weren't kidding.<eos> No, I was not.<eos> Okay. What's up?<eos> What I say cannot leave this room.<eos> What you say cannot fit in this room.<eos> When I was 14, my best friend, uh, Carice Jaquard... she lived next door.<eos> And one day, she didn't show up for school.<eos> So on my way home, I thought I would stop by, see if she wanted to know what the homework was.<eos> Mnh, she didn't.
Well... I love that you can't tell a lie.<eos> - But you think I'm a coward.<eos> - What?<eos> No. Why?<eos> Because I'm avoiding him, not confronting him about it.<eos> Maura, I live in a 2x3 room in order to avoid living with my mother.<eos> You were a child, and he put you in a terrible position.<eos> But it was so long ago.<eos> You want me to shoot him?<eos> - I do.
- But you think I'm a coward.<eos> - What?<eos> No. Why?<eos> Because I'm avoiding him, not confronting him about it.<eos> Maura, I live in a 2x3 room in order to avoid living with my mother.<eos> You were a child, and he put you in a terrible position.<eos> But it was so long ago.<eos> You want me to shoot him?<eos> - I do.<eos> I really do. - Okay.
Hey, you know what?<eos> I wonder if whoever tried to kill him knows that he's still alive.<eos> When is his competition that he's supposed to be in?<eos> Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.

We decided to confirm the property value with the realtor and discovered that five houses near Mona are in escrow.<eos> And every one of them sold over fair market value at nearly $1 million each.<eos> Turns out Harbor Hospital has quietly been buying up all the houses on Mona's block in order to expand.<eos> But all the sales are contingent on closing the deals on all six properties.<eos> Mona was the only holdout.<eos> She didn't want to move Duke away from his home and training facility.<eos> Million dollars is a lot of motive.<eos> The only problem with that is I found her will in the house.<eos> The daughters don't stand to inherit the estate.<eos> - The dog does.
Charging your phone with my car.<eos> - This car has a special feature ...<eos> - Yeah, I'm so glad.<eos> Tell me about it later.<eos> Bomb-sniffing dog.<eos> Sure everyone feels safe now.<eos> - Window!<eos> - All right!<eos> Circle around the back.<eos> - How you doing?
- That's it. Here. - Okay.<eos> You take your stained books and get out of my café. - I don't want them.<eos> - Fuck you!<eos> I don't want you to have them.<eos> Take your 60 bucks, shove it up your ass!<eos> Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
- Violet.<eos> - How's Violet?<eos> - She passed away.<eos> A year and a half ago.<eos> Violet's dead.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I am.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So listen, you told me... that if I ever needed anything I should come to you.<eos> Did I?
He disappeared?<eos> Damn!<eos> Look out!<eos> Run away, Kaede. He's after me.<eos> What is it you want?<eos> To cut the opponent you detest into pieces? !<eos> Will you feel satisfaction from crushing him under your feet?<eos> You may have taken that form, but you're just a human obsessed with revenge!<eos> Everyone has a some darkness in him!<eos> Ren-kun does, too! Me, too!
It's never known anything but death.<eos> It's not like us.<eos> It's not like anybody.<eos> Are you saying we should just hand Rachael over?<eos> Henry...<eos> People weren't willing to give us a chance.<eos> - How can we assume the worst of this child?<eos> - Still..<eos> We don't know what's really going on.<eos> Nobody does.
Did you cheat on me or did I start to bore you?<eos> You know how Scott E said there were zombies at the boat party?<eos> He was right.<eos> I saw them.<eos> Don't kid about this.<eos> I just checked myself out of a mental hospital.<eos> I'm not kidding.<eos> I wouldn't do that to you.<eos> Zombies really do exist.<eos> They do.
Nonsense.<eos> Hang on.<eos> Look what I've got.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a clean cell.<eos> For contacting your dodgy friends.<eos> For scheming and maneuvering and setting things in motion.<eos> I have no use for it. Yes, you do.<eos> I'm sorry, love, but you don't get to sit this one out.<eos> None of us do.
Be strong, my little urchin.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need your help with something and it's really important, so I don't want any quivering.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I want you to take me to Rachel.<eos> What?<eos> If anybody knows about castor, it's going to be her.<eos> I'm not authorized.<eos> I'm not even supposed to know where she is.<eos> Yeah, but you do, don't you?
No, no, Jason, no.<eos> You need to stop this.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - I know.<eos> Hey, marriage is complicated.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> No, no. This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
I just gotta go.<eos> I'll call you later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit!<eos> We're closed.<eos> Okay, yeah, all right, okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
- Please.<eos> Siobhan, I've got something for you.<eos> Listen, I'm just round the corner, so ask the barmaid for directions, yeah?<eos> Terrance.<eos> Good afternoon.<eos> Ferdinand.<eos> You scared the shite outta me.<eos> I thought that you were going to call me if Siobhan Sadler ever came to town.<eos> We had an understanding.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You should see her after a fight. [chuckles]<eos> She collapses onto the canvas like she's given it all she's got.<eos> Crowd just eats it up.<eos> I'm gonna keep you for observation, Kara.<eos> A quick word?<eos> We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.
'Cause I wanted you not to go to the dance because I asked you not to go to the dance.<eos> Not because of work.<eos> Well, now you're just being deliberately difficult.<eos> I will pick you up at 10:00.<eos> And don't forget, you're staying at your dad's tonight.<eos> And, honey, you look pretty.<eos> I also have a berry cobbler, so I hope everybody saved plenty of room.<eos> Oh! Before I met Judith, I didn't know it was possible to go up two pants sizes in one meal.<eos> He's always teasing me, this one.<eos> So how did you two...
Yep.<eos> Not all women.<eos> Do I have the wrong night?<eos> It's...<eos> Thursday.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> I thought it was Friday.<eos> Is that nightie new?<eos> It looks pretty on you.<eos> Doesn't it, Graham?
You'd think that'd be the beginning of a fresh start, wouldn't you?<eos> No possessions, no personal attachments, not even a wallet.<eos> And yet, um... I'm gonna make the same mistakes all over again.<eos> How could I not?<eos> I'm the same person I've always been.<eos> I'm looking for the same thing.<eos> I have no idea how to find it.<eos> You don't think you've changed?<eos> No. No.<eos> I do.
Oh, you poor dear.<eos> No, it's all right, actually.<eos> I have alcohol and gambling.<eos> My happy plate is more than full.<eos> I just thought you should know that I am genuinely attracted to you.<eos> - You are?<eos> - Yes.<eos> In college I had a thing for all my professors.<eos> So did I. I loved them.<eos> But I never did anything about it.
Walter, is this your new car?<eos> We got it this morning.<eos> I told Harry to get a Volt or a Prius.<eos> I mean, I have to be a role model.<eos> Instead, he gets this stupid muscle car.<eos> You said to follow my bliss.<eos> I said a Volt or a Prius.<eos> You willfully misheard me.<eos> Well, I think it's a super cool car, Walter.<eos> I really do.
This life that we have...<eos> it didn't cost you anything,<eos> - but I paid for it.<eos> - Did Nusrat ask for the annulment, or was it you and Father?<eos> It was understood that an annulment was the only way...<eos> You're lying.<eos> You and Father can bring the Palace down around you for all I care.<eos> I will wait here for you.<eos> Come back, okay?<eos> But if you don't...
I wanted to be able to say something more than just,<eos> "I'm sorry."<eos> I'm thinking about staying here.<eos> In Abuddin.<eos> Because your mother wants you to?<eos> It has nothing to do with her.<eos> I'm staying here because I want to make the case of me playing a role in the future of Abuddin.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I can't say yet.<eos> If I did...
No, no.<eos> You obsess over a death trap on wheels.<eos> You know what?<eos> That car is a classic.<eos> Mind yourself.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> With the sales pitch.<eos> It's a classic piece of junk, that car.<eos> You know what that car means to me.<eos> Uh-huh. Do you not?
What do you know about her?<eos> Just what the Dark One showed me... that she was banished to this world 30 years ago, to a place called Minnesota, where she was adopted by a couple.<eos> And they named her Lilith.<eos> No.<eos> Emma? What is it?<eos> _<eos> Lily.<eos> Mom said I could have it!<eos> - Flashlight...<eos> - No, she didn't!
You're too predictable.<eos> You don't listen.<eos> Man against man is no different than army against army.<eos> Deception is key.<eos> You're impatient with me today, Ka.<eos> You might as well have accused General Horemheb of treason.<eos> He's the greatest general Egypt has ever known.<eos> Is that how you earn the army's trust?<eos> No.<eos> I do so on the battlefield with you by my side.
Ivan Radchenko.<eos> Detective Reagan.<eos> Detective Baez.<eos> Welcome.<eos> She's very fragile right now.<eos> We understand.<eos> You were in law enforcement yourself, is that right, Mr. Radchenko?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Now you'll ask me if I have any theory about who did this terrible thing?<eos> Do you?
Wait.<eos> Slow down.<eos> Braxton is trying to extract a memory from Agent Keen.<eos> He will do so by any means necessary.<eos> He's likely contacted someone for that purpose already.<eos> Find out who that someone is.<eos> What memory?<eos> A memory she has no memory of.<eos> You said you had the situation under control.<eos> - I do.
It's gonna be fine.<eos> It's too dangerous.<eos> Something happened that night, something people are willing to kill to find out, and whatever it was involved my father.<eos> I'm not doing this for Braxton or for you.<eos> I'm doing it for me.<eos> I need to know the truth.<eos> Where is it?<eos> I'll have it to you by 9:00.<eos> I thought you said you had it already.<eos> And I do.
♪ ♪ I don't know, I don't know ♪<eos> [Al] As the civil rights movement really swung into high gear, she swung into high gear with it.<eos> In '65, we played at the Selma March in Montgomery, Alabama.<eos> [Martin Luther King Jr.] We have a legal and constitutional right -to march from Selma to Montgomery! -[crowd cheering]<eos> [Al] It was extremely dangerous.<eos> The federal Marshals were called in, and they were standing on the tops of all the buildings downtown with guns.<eos> [Andy] Seated in front of the stage facing the audience was Martin Luther King,<eos> Ralph Bunche from the UN and a lot of other worldwide dignitaries.<eos> [Al] You had Langston Hughes, James Baldwin, Sidney Poitier,<eos> Bill Cosby, Leonard Bernstein, Harry Belafonte, and we did "Mississippi Goddam."
Sir, so the first mate says to the judge,<eos> "I'll have you know, a sailor I am not."<eos> Anything on that destroyer?<eos> - No, mate. - ‭Come on.<eos> Quiet as a church mouse.<eos> Just 'cause the boss is off ship ain't no excuse to lollygag.<eos> - Keep looking. - All right.<eos> - Ned wants results.<eos> - Yeah, all right.<eos> Don't "all right" me.
And for the record, I'm mad at my mom.<eos> That she lied to both of us.<eos> Yeah, well, she was just doing what she thought was best for you.<eos> Yeah, but it wasn't.<eos> I'm just sayin'... you aren't the only one that made mistakes, so don't blame yourself.<eos> If you knew about me, you woulda taken care of me.<eos> And Jude.<eos> I know that.<eos> And it's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
Whatever happens, you can trust me, just know that... honest.<eos> I know.<eos> I do.<eos> Oh, Robert, sorry.<eos> Um, you have a call.<eos> It's your lawyer.<eos> Oh, well, that was quite an afternoon, wasn't it?<eos> Yeah...<eos> I just hope you know that everything that Robert does, he does out of love for you.<eos> I do.
It's a good story.<eos> But that's all it is, a story from a crazy old man.<eos> Who happened to keep a complete set of the original documents in the hope that one day, he might find the courage to set things right.<eos> You engineers did better the second time around.<eos> At least this one took 20 years to start leaking.<eos> If this is true, and Anneca is responsible for hundreds of people's deaths then you and the other high-level executives will be prosecuted.<eos> Reparations can be paid to the alleged victims.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> Reparations are all well and good but the people I represent don't want you to fix it.<eos> - They don't?
Hold on, hold on.<eos> I'm on my way to a meeting with the attorney general and DOJ.<eos> I'm sure that we can work all this out in a timely manner.<eos> No reason to call the secretary.<eos> What we need here are some back-channel negotiations.<eos> I think we need front-channel negotiations.<eos> You should go to Texas and meet with your former boss.<eos> Should we order some dessert?<eos> I hope they still have that strawberry savarin.<eos> And they do!
Come on, let's go!<eos> Let's wheel this sucker out of here!<eos> No way, I'm not touching that dead-ass-dude box.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> We're gonna take the body to Aunt Patty's house and feed him to her raccoons?<eos> - That sounds badass.<eos> - No way. Oh, I bet you got a better idea.<eos> Damn right, Gramps was a paratrooper, so we're gonna crenate his body in a bon fire and scatter his ashes from the sky, just like he always wanted.<eos> - I knew you'd have a good idea.<eos> - I didn't.
Blake, Blake, they're going to the park, but they trapped me in here.<eos> I'm locked in here.<eos> I'm at the funeral home.<eos> [Both talking at once] I'll come and save you.<eos> I'm gonna save you.<eos> What's the deal?<eos> You're just gonna sit here the whole time?<eos> Hey, stop!<eos> - Lay on, peasant.<eos> - Don't.
No, blocking is different.<eos> Unfriending is a statement.<eos> - Unfriending is worse.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> If you want to confront someone, why don't you just do it in person?<eos> W-What?<eos> Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.<eos> - Why would you...<eos> - Do you really want to be in the middle of this?<eos> No, I really don't.
I know how much you need that money, and I swear, I will win that prize for you.<eos> Emily, stop.<eos> "A" is just gonna come after you, too.<eos> "A" can come after me any day of the week, anywhere.<eos> That's not going to stop me from helping someone I love.<eos> (knock on door)<eos> Hey.<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> Did my mom come down to the station?<eos> She did.
To revenge.<eos> What'd you think?<eos> I thought that the sets were really impressive.<eos> The sets.<eos> Mm-hmm. Right.<eos> So critical to any stellar Shakespearean production.<eos> The lighting was really good.<eos> Another aspect typically overlooked by most audiences.<eos> You didn't like it.<eos> No, I didn't.
Goes to foundation.<eos> Overruled.<eos> But don't take the scenic route, Mr. Sirk.<eos> Is Mrs. Marin in the courtroom today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Point her out to the jury, please.<eos> She's in the third row.<eos> She's wearing a blue dress.<eos> Does Mrs. Marin work for you?<eos> She did, she doesn't anymore.
Look.<eos> Everything about Mona was complicated.<eos> Yeah.<eos> But when I said that about her, I saw the look on your face.<eos> And it wasn't the way I want to see you look at me... ever.<eos> It's just my face.<eos> Sometimes it does things without checking with me first.<eos> Well, it sounded like she deserved what happened to her, and I don't believe that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Nobody does.
Roger would fire me if I did anything wrong.<eos> Anybody else at the bakery know what Connor was into?<eos> We all suspected, except Roger.<eos> That dude invented rose-colored glasses.<eos> And, uh, what else did you suspect Connor was into?<eos> I answer, you could charge me with accessory.<eos> Yeah, and if you don't, I charge you with impeding an investigation.<eos> I told him not to do it.<eos> I told him I didn't want no part of it.<eos> None of us did.
Did you set me up?<eos> Look, I'm on your side here, Alex.<eos> Alex, Alex, stop...<eos> Shut up, you son of a bitch!<eos> You're coming with me.<eos> Move!<eos> - Rockwell!<eos> - He has a knife in the car!<eos> I don't have a clear shot.<eos> I do.
You open this door and you let me take my meds, and then I will tell you everything I know.<eos> Open the door, get him his meds.<eos> I can't.<eos> There's no manual override, as Dr Pryce well knows.<eos> - He says you can't open it.<eos> - Don't listen to him. He's lying!<eos> I suppose there's no delicate way to say this.<eos> Dr Pryce is going through the classic stages of drug withdrawal.<eos> I had no idea how bad his addiction had become.<eos> People rarely do.
I can't go up there.<eos> The whole idea terrifies me.<eos> Well, then that's exactly the reason to do it.<eos> Run at that barking dog.<eos> Make your fears your ally.<eos> I wouldn't even know what to do.<eos> Doesn't matter what you do. Only that you do.<eos> And you have my solemn word, this is not going on your permanent record.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't even...
Yeah, we'll keep that in mind.<eos> What's up with all the assault rifles?<eos> Ah.<eos> Private security.<eos> This isn't San Diego.<eos> You might want to hire some protection.<eos> What are you guys doing over there?<eos> Air quality sensors.<eos> So, got any veggie burgers?<eos> As a matter of fact, we do.
That's bullcrap.<eos> Somebody do something.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Here comes the cavalry.<eos> Whoa, that was awesome.<eos> These women are warriors.<eos> They live by the code of the ancient Amazon.<eos> A sisterhood that had each other's backs.<eos> Wow, I wish I had that.<eos> You do!
How are things going?<eos> With Ravi?<eos> Should we talk about this?<eos> Maybe just don't tell me about sex.<eos> - Oh, cause that's like all we do.<eos> - Stop.<eos> No, it is.<eos> - Like all the time. - Ah!<eos> - Banging and banging.<eos> - No, don't!
She thought I had potential!<eos> So, yesterday, she slices her head open on the freezer door and asks me to bandage it.<eos> And I'm there, with the bandage...<eos> And there's blood... And I'm just so hungry.<eos> I couldn't stop myself.<eos> Funny.<eos> I've never eaten anyone I didn't want to eat.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> Liv.<eos> Don't!
Lando Cal...?<eos> Por qué no te callas?<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> I need to think!<eos> Don't yell at me, I didn't lose her.<eos> Now just try to retrace your steps.<eos> Well, I wasn't in the sofa cushions.<eos> Agh!<eos> Well, you could have said that!<eos> I did.
Sploosh.<eos> Sploosh.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Is I bet the sound an avalanche makes.<eos> Uh, no, it's more like a freight train full of tornadoes, which are in turn full of smaller freight trains.<eos> Which are in turn full of shit.<eos> Sorry?<eos> She just had a baby.<eos> Ya know...<eos> I didn't.
Kid's got no track marks on him, either.<eos> What's this?<eos> It's the arrow of Sagittarius.<eos> Scar tissue is deep and well-defined.<eos> This mark must have been here for a few years.<eos> If I didn't know any better, I'd say this guy's been branded.<eos> All right, so somebody comes in here, try to make this thing look like an overdose.<eos> I'm assuming whoever did this did not want us to tie this kid to Julius Brennan.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> Well, that scar just did.
I like the sound.<eos> It's kinda soothing.<eos> It feels weird to sleep alone.<eos> I'm not used to it.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> He used to go away all the time, but this time, he's...<eos> He's gone, and I know he's gone.<eos> And the bed feels lonely.<eos> It's like I don't know how to sleep alone.<eos> You don't.
Your "complicated" friend... just made us the most wanted people in the world.<eos> Do you remember Paris?<eos> I remember climbing the Eiffel Tower and running down the Champs-Élysées.<eos> - It was raining, but...<eos> - There was a nice old lady.<eos> - And she gave me her umbrella. - It had a hole in it.<eos> I was soaked.<eos> So you have all the same memories?<eos> Yeah, Lucas and Lucy, they share the same neural programming.<eos> - They all do.

What'd you find out, Ahdu?<eos> Casualties.<eos> Women, children.<eos> Some got away.<eos> - Some didn't.<eos> - Did they find Terra?<eos> Or Ares.<eos> But I know they're out there somewhere.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I just do.
What about it?<eos> Have you reviewed the preliminary reports?<eos> The explosion appears to have been generated from an outside source.<eos> Perhaps the hybrids launched another assault.<eos> But why would the hybrids kill Toby if he was helping them?<eos> If there's another player on the board, I need to know.<eos> Of course, but this brings up the question of your own safety,<eos> Madame Secretary.<eos> I have adequate security.<eos> As did General Shepherd.
John used to send me messages all around the house in binary code.<eos> He used to use zeroes and ones.<eos> Now, I couldn't understand it, but I had a program that can decode it.<eos> Well, black squares could be ones and white squares could be zeroes.<eos> - Simple.<eos> - Yeah, simple.<eos> Watch.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I thought you didn't understand this stuff.<eos> I didn't.
So you enlist my ex-wife to manipulate me?<eos> Don't play that game, Molly.<eos> I'm not playing games.<eos> Now, you believe in that vision just as much as I do.<eos> What if I do?<eos> Then why are you willfully and deliberately marching towards your own death?<eos> When I came back from 2nd K, I can't tell you how many nights I would wake up in a cold sweat.<eos> - The nightmares...<eos> - I understand that!<eos> No, you don't!
Reactionaries, agitators, smugglers, even bandits.<eos> No one knows who did it.<eos> Go again.<eos> Press harder.<eos> [Screaming]<eos> [Horn blaring]<eos> So...<eos> It's begun.<eos> Thomas: Do you repent your sins?<eos> Stephen: I do.
Go again.<eos> Press harder.<eos> [Screaming]<eos> [Horn blaring]<eos> So...<eos> It's begun.<eos> Thomas: Do you repent your sins?<eos> Stephen: I do.<eos> Do you believe in Jesus Christ, the son of God, who died on the cross and rose again on the third day?<eos> I do.
What is it?<eos> It's my dad's old footlocker from the Navy.<eos> Sylvie mentioned you guys needed a coffee table, I thought this would be perfect.<eos> It's great.<eos> Right?<eos> Beer? Anyone?<eos> Ah, yes, please. Hermann wore me out.<eos> Oh, he will do that to you.<eos> I don't think I have any, actually.<eos> - Oh, yes you do. - Oh.
- Did you call them?<eos> - Léon!<eos> Come down and bring my bag!<eos> "Love"... No. "Life is a sleep.<eos> "Love's a dream.<eos> Love and you've lived."<eos> It's no joke.<eos> I asked if you called them.<eos> Because you don't know the answer.<eos> - I do. Easy.
I don't blame you.<eos> So what's with all... this.<eos> Oh, the box was loose, so I figured I would fix it.<eos> You know that you don't have to do all this, right?<eos> Well, actually, you could've had some serious problems...<eos> Exposed wires, electrical fires.<eos> No. I mean being here with me.<eos> You know, if you have someplace else<eos> - you'd rather be...<eos> - I don't.
What did I just say?<eos> All right.<eos> Something happened between Caroline and me.<eos> Finally.<eos> And then here mom died, and I haven't had a chance to talk to her about it, and I don't know the best way to handle it.<eos> Pull the ripcord.<eos> - What?<eos> - Well, she's not the one.<eos> If she was, you wouldn't have to ask.<eos> - Yeah, but I didn't even...
Yeah.<eos> They're trying.<eos> Would you take it?<eos> Uh, it's not a problem that I'm likely to have.<eos> They don't hand them out for the things I've done.<eos> We've done the same things.<eos> We've covered up killings.<eos> Yeah, but Conrad was unarmed.<eos> But he destroyed countless lives.<eos> - Kate didn't...
You know, I did my share of sneaking out too back in the day.<eos> Those things are out there, Dick.<eos> If Batman's a target, so is he.<eos> Then talk to him about it.<eos> - He doesn't listen.<eos> - But, Bruce, he's just...<eos> He's not you, Dick.<eos> Before I took you in, you had loving parents.<eos> You had a heart.<eos> - And he doesn't?
He's supposed to take my place in the ritual.<eos> - He's...<eos> - You lied to me.<eos> Batman was right.<eos> - You were just using me to...<eos> - Shut up. Shut up!<eos> I swear to you we'll find a replacement.<eos> Now, kill him!<eos> Yes, Grandmaster.<eos> Do it!
Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> My daughter will testify.<eos> So will my fiancée.<eos> Am I making this up... hmm?<eos> No one saw this.<eos> Are you counting on my son?<eos> 'Cause there's something you should know.<eos> He's never had the nerve to go up against his father.<eos> All right?<eos> He still doesn't.
Fortino?<eos> Hey, Mr. Alan.<eos> What did I tell you about using Fortino?<eos> He's supposed to be repotting my azaleas.<eos> Lo siento, Miss Diana. I'm...<eos> I'm gonna go back to the azaleas.<eos> What happened to all the stuff that was in here?<eos> Oh...<eos> Del? Why'd you move their stuff?<eos> I didn't.
You got my money, mane?<eos> We brought the cash.<eos> Did you bring the Del?<eos> Help me!<eos> Relax, Del. Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> I'm here, buddy.<eos> Thanks, Jack, you're my best friend.<eos> You want some more of that?<eos> - No.<eos> - He does.
Good tenant, no trouble.<eos> All right. Nice place.<eos> Guess being a fortune teller is a good gig, huh?<eos> Psychic.<eos> And Justine was amazing, yes.<eos> Oh, so you were a client as well as her landlord?<eos> I did a couple readings.<eos> She was incredible.<eos> Really connected, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
And we might be working late.<eos> Wetestedtheequipment that you use to fix the flooring in the building, and your mallet caused the victim's injuries and tested positive for her blood.<eos> So your move next.<eos> No. You guys got it all wrong.<eos> I didn't kill Justine.<eos> Right. So somebody stole your mallet, then killed Justine with it, and then what?<eos> Planted it back on you?<eos> Okay, I shouldn't have lied.<eos> But I was scared that you would think that I killed Justine.<eos> We do.
Sad.<eos> And mad, at herself, and at me 'cause we can't have a baby.<eos> You do.<eos> We didn't know it?<eos> We... we just didn't know she was pregnant?<eos> It happens.<eos> This was the whole reason for the hunting trips and the jet skis, trips to Bali and stuff.<eos> I said to her, "babe, if it's just gonna be us, let's make us an adventure."<eos> But she really wanted a baby.<eos> We both did.
The doctor said Jenna's waking up.<eos> We have a few questions, so excuse us.<eos> Luke, you guys should go in there too.<eos> She's 16.<eos> Of course.<eos> Right this way.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm sorry, Mom, Dad.<eos> It's okay, baby.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
(Danny) Hey, thanks for coming.<eos> Have a seat, man.<eos> [sighing] Look, Jeremy, um<eos> I'm not gonna be at the practice anymore, because, well, I'm not gonna be here.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Morgan was right.<eos> What?<eos> Don't say anything else.<eos> Danny, I know.<eos> - You do?
- They were to ease his symptoms. - No!<eos> - You must have seen he wasn't well.<eos> - No, really, there was nothing.<eos> No, the day he died, the surf was perfect...<eos> It was just us out there, no cares...<eos> He was so alive!<eos> Why didn't he tell me?<eos> Dr Slater said Jake didn't want you to know.<eos> What, Karl knew?<eos> Of course he did!
Or the supposed friend, caught with the murder weapon.<eos> Or the long-lost daughter, who had just been rejected?<eos> Or the runaway thief?<eos> You see, we had motives.<eos> Yeah, but none of that helped... with the central problem.<eos> Until I considered another riddle.<eos> And then it all started to make sense.<eos> If the killer had no way out of the workshop, then they had to still be there!<eos> But we'd have seen him.<eos> Oh, but you did.
Well, Duke and I have already discussed it.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I've already arranged for you to watch the fight in the green room, if you'd like.<eos> Sorry, one sec.<eos> Go for Jo.<eos> This sucks.<eos> Marriage sucks.<eos> Correction, love sucks.<eos> You don't believe that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Okay, we'll, uh...<eos> We'll leave you alone, but if something comes up, anything, give us a call.<eos> There's one other thing.<eos> I ran into my friend Jemma at the supermarket.<eos> She's married to Kit Verson, a guy from Rick's team.<eos> She thinks Kit came back different this time.<eos> Kind of felt like we were dealing with the same thing.<eos> Kit's been going through some stuff, for sure.<eos> -Um, it takes him a while to get back to normal.<eos> -Thanks. But he always does.
Listen.<eos> Whatever happened, whatever you-- You did, we're gonna fix this.<eos> We're gonna get you well.<eos> -Kit, stop, please.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You're in a sweat lodge?<eos> You're the one who said everything's got a weakness. I figure I take a shvitz, kill a freak, call that a good day.<eos> Yeah, if it works.<eos> Ah, well, you got a better idea?<eos> Yeah, I do, actually, Dean.
I mean, maybe not class, but...<eos> Sit.<eos> Right.<eos> I got friends upstate doing hard time for selling weaker schwag than that.<eos> I'm sorry?<eos> Now that government's gone made that OG dank legal, taxing it, ain't that a bitch?<eos> Yeah, the government, it's pretty diabolical.<eos> Do you want some ice cream?<eos> - I don't know what you want from me.<eos> - Oh, sure you do, Trey.
She said that her favorite DJ was gonna be playing there.<eos> That girl loves to dance.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Fiona, this club is off the hook.<eos> - How did you get us in?<eos> - The owner and I, we go way back.<eos> You guys want more bubbly?<eos> - Free champagne. - Yeah!<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - Oh, we already did.
You're on a roll.<eos> I did none of this.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> [Laughter]<eos> [Bell ringing]<eos> He broke his collar bone and shattered his arm.<eos> His athletic career is shot.<eos> Scholarships gone.<eos> Did you see Jenny push him?<eos> No one did.
Here.<eos> [Keys rattling in door]<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I wanted a haircut.<eos> I see that.<eos> You were in the shower, so I went for a walk, you know?<eos> I was going a little stir crazy.<eos> You can't just leave like that.<eos> What if someone recognized you?<eos> No one did.
He's the starting goalie on the hockey team.<eos> Great stick skills.<eos> The Ivies are all over the kid.<eos> It must have been quite a coup for Wendsworth Academy to recruit him.<eos> Serious coup.<eos> He's going to lead them to the tri-state championships next week.<eos> Have you seen his father down here?<eos> No, I would like to though.<eos> A kid like that, he's raised right, you know?<eos> I do.
She looks more "bored business woman" than girls gone wild.<eos> Check out her lips, recognize that lip color?<eos> Orange is the new lipstick.<eos> That's the color we found in Mickey's car.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Run facial recognition.<eos> Donna McKinney, illustrious manager.<eos> Her clients engage in mixed martial arts, which, according to my research, is a competition of sorts to inflict bodily harm on another human in an enclosed cage space.<eos> We all know what MMA is, Max.<eos> - Of course we do.
- Silver?<eos> He told the assayer there was plenty more where that came from.<eos> I knew it had to be around here somewhere.<eos> Right, Mr. Brown, thank you.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> Sir?<eos> I have to admit some confusion.<eos> Dr. Grace's telegram ascertains that Mr. Graham was indeed poisoned by water hemlock.<eos> Sir, how does that prove that Jagger Brown was seen with Graham in Toronto?<eos> It doesn't, George.
I know, but she's a cop.<eos> I can't just shoot her in broad daylight.<eos> We'll have half the force breathing down our neck.<eos> - It's tricky.<eos> - Carol, listen to me.<eos> Our only hope to make up for not killing them last time is to bring back the beast, and a very, very special beast.<eos> And the only way to find out if that's<eos> Vincent is to make sure that Cat isn't alive to save him.<eos> I won't let you down.<eos> You never do.
I didn't realize that was a crime.<eos> All right, just come on, if we don't follow the rules, we'll never break our codep...<eos> No. Do not use the "C" word.<eos> This is not about codependency.<eos> Okay. What's up?<eos> Someone got saddled with a new partner.<eos> I mean, I get that Carol is trying to prove herself as captain, but...<eos> Uh, you mean Tess, right?<eos> That's what I said.<eos> Uh, no, no, you didn't.
- Wait, hold on!<eos> Move, move, move!<eos> Hold on.<eos> Geez. Tess?<eos> All right, let's go, let's go!<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I'm saving your life, that's what's going on.<eos> Next time, answer your phone if you want a heads up.<eos> Liam got Alton, didn't he?<eos> Yeah, he did.
For both of us?<eos> Why?<eos> Because I made sure DHS acquired some of your blood samples as well-- to tie our fates, and to force you to help me retrieve the samples from the high security lab before all our future plans are lost.<eos> How do we know you're telling us the truth?<eos> Why else would I go through all this?<eos> That's a good question, actually.<eos> Even if he is telling the truth, he certainly doesn't need Vincent's help breaking into DHS. Right.<eos> I could simply lay waste to any agents who stand in my way.<eos> Which makes Vincent the only one who could save them.<eos> And also responsible for them if he doesn't.
Thank you so much.<eos> It's unrealistic to think about children.<eos> Not now.<eos> It's unrealistic.<eos> Clark?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really.<eos> It's fine. I'm fine.<eos> I just needed to know.<eos> And now I do.
Really.<eos> The cherries are no good on their own.<eos> They taste spiky.<eos> The garlic makes them smooth, F major seven.<eos> How about we stick to just cherries?<eos> Right.<eos> Where did we get married?<eos> Anglise Mare de Dieu, Iga, 1937, in Basse-Normandie, in the township of Bellame, part of the district...<eos> - I wish I had your memory.<eos> - No, you don't.
You said: "was"...<eos> He was caught.<eos> Dragged out of the house, and shot in the street.<eos> I saw it happen.<eos> There are deaths that have no meaning.<eos> But not his.<eos> Because I'll keep fighting.<eos> Finish what he started.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Sorry, I didn't...
Jeez.<eos> It's tough not to look out this window with wonder.<eos> Wonder what?<eos> What did we really accomplish?<eos> Felicity and I have a lot to catch up on, so maybe take us through all the evidence the team has gathered.<eos> That's easy.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Ok, so maybe we'll go through all the encounters that you've had with the ghosts, everywhere they've hidden, and places you can cross...<eos> John... We should have discussed this.<eos> Thea and I did.
But I have to make it work.<eos> It can't be my trauma getting in the way.<eos> Why?<eos> Because what happened is my fault.<eos> I mean, my maternal instincts, where were they?<eos> I just gave him to the nurse.<eos> Baby... she was wearing a uniform.<eos> She said he needed a hearing test.<eos> But I should've known.<eos> And I didn't.
You're my best friend.<eos> But you're also a nice hookup and a great writer.<eos> You're not the best camp counselor, though.<eos> You're kind of bad at making arts and crafts. Please, like you're so great at it.<eos> Gosh, it feels so good to get out of that side braid.<eos> The pulling, how did you do that every day for two years?<eos> Are you ready?<eos> See you later, best friend.<eos> You want to know the best part about knowing who I was?<eos> That Matty did too.
I wish I were with you right now just, just touching you, kissing you.<eos> That sounds so good.<eos> We should be recording this, too.<eos> When do I get to see you again?<eos> Soon, but, honey, uh, I've hit a snag.<eos> We have a problem with the final delivery.<eos> What happened?<eos> They moved the third chemical to a higher security lab.<eos> I don't have clearance.<eos> The guy who does,
Mary, their Catholic queen, gone, a queen even English Catholics believe has the right to your throne.<eos> What next?<eos> Do we attack half our population to put you at ease?<eos> The realm will strike down anyone who acts against its sovereign ruler.<eos> Is it not our sworn duty?<eos> Bad day on the job, my dear?<eos> Half of England wants me gone.<eos> Only the Catholic half.<eos> Well, the rest don't want Mary, but they certainly wish I were a man.<eos> Of course they do, especially your privy council.
Aces.<eos> All right, let's gear up.<eos> That might be tricky.<eos> What's he doing?<eos> - Dean...<eos> - We made a promise.<eos> To do what?<eos> Charge out there, guns blazing?<eos> We don't even know how to kill them.<eos> She does.
Your mother and I were going through a tough time.<eos> We weren't communicating.<eos> I had a one-night stand.<eos> That's it.<eos> It was the biggest mistake of my life.<eos> And then what happened?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I told her I'd made a mistake and...<eos> And I could never see her again.<eos> And I didn't...
You're holding sensitive and upsetting information and until the time is right, when it makes sense for her to hear it, from me.<eos> But until then, this is between us.<eos> You have to trust me on this.<eos> This is not your burden to carry.<eos> No.<eos> Hey.<eos> I thought we could do Taco night.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Mom, you don't have to cook.<eos> Sure I do.
Said the latest he can leave camp tonight is midnight.<eos> There's a piece of correspondence I have delayed sending for several weeks.<eos> It's an execution order.<eos> Execution?<eos> For who?<eos> A royal officer held by our forces.<eos> The crime he's committed most certainly merits death.<eos> Our Connecticut 5th has been awaiting my instructions for a month.<eos> If they do not hear word by tomorrow, they'll assume they have my approval to proceed with the execution.<eos> Well, do they or don't they?
They exist merely in the minds of men.<eos> But... when a mind is broken... and a man... is stripped down to his base nature...<eos> Then you can see who he truly is.<eos> It will be with great pleasure that I finally meet you, Mr. Woodhull.<eos> Get out.<eos> Go on!<eos> Washington: Of all the decisions I make, it is this one which threatens my life and our future.<eos> Shall I pardon a brutal murderer in order to save a failed spy?<eos> What should I do?<eos> You always do the right thing, General.
To figure that out, you gotta play Abe's hand.<eos> Woodhull hasn't broken.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because he hasn't been executed.<eos> If he had, we'd have read it in their gazettes.<eos> For a lawful execution to take place, one requires sufficient evidence.<eos> Right, and without evidence you gotta get a confession.<eos> Despite whatever miseries they've heaped upon him,<eos> Woodhull hasn't succumbed.<eos> Neither did the other one.
- I thought he was dead.<eos> - Your son, Finnian.<eos> Finn, we always called him.<eos> Finn.<eos> There are some things that you need to understand about Justin about the way that things were.<eos> You see, his word was not just the law.<eos> It was the word of God himself.<eos> Justin was our oracle.<eos> He was our burning bush. - I understand.<eos> - You don't.
Yeah, I know them.<eos> What I found was, this woman that I trusted implicitly had in fact fallen from that faith.<eos> Now, I was disappointed, and I was heartbroken.<eos> But you see, no one is above betrayal, David.<eos> The president would never lay me out on purpose, not like you're laying out Kyle Green for leaking that photo, which is what I assume you're doing.<eos> You know, David, all this contempt leaves me wondering why you even bothered to come here to warn me about your boss's intentions.<eos> Well, let me be clear.<eos> I don't want this to blow up in her face, and you seem like a shrewd enough operator to keep your mouth shut.<eos> She doesn't need any more enemies in the Senate.<eos> She sure as hell doesn't.
Ask yourself where you want to be standing this time next year and who you want to be standing with.<eos> Who do I want to be standing with, Bob?<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> This is Nick.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
I got to lock up.<eos> It's too bad about Zack.<eos> He was always watching your back.<eos> And such a nice back.<eos> Get out.<eos> You're a stuck up bitch who thinks she's too good for anybody.<eos> Ricky, what are you doing?<eos> Zack was an okay guy, and now he's dead, and I think it's because of you, so I came to get what you never gave him.<eos> No, no, no! You don't know what's gonna happen.<eos> Yeah, I do.
But what do you think?<eos> That's not for me to say, sir.<eos> Sorry to bother, but...<eos> Step in.<eos> I can come back.<eos> Step in, please.<eos> You spun me.<eos> No. Yeah, you did.<eos> I asked you if Sam had priors.<eos> And he doesn't.
These are all lovely words, Antoine, but they don't change the fact that you have a wife, and I a husband.<eos> You have a husband who no longer trusts you.<eos> I think if you ask him for an annulment, he will grant you one.<eos> I have a dying wife who wants me to find a mother for our children.<eos> Are you sure you want a mother for your children who has no shame?<eos> Well, I believe shame is the worst thing a parent can teach their children.<eos> I want my children to be joyful and frank and adventurous.<eos> Like you.<eos> But if parenthood - is something that doesn't interest you... - No.<eos> It does, actually.

Are you all right, my darling?<eos> Give me one moment.<eos> Kenna, please stop.<eos> Listen.<eos> Whatever you think you may know, my wife is pregnant, yes, but she's still very ill.<eos> That's why I sent for her...<eos> I thought she might want to meet you...<eos> Enough!<eos> You didn't invite her.<eos> I did.
For your son, I mean. Not you.<eos> You were there once.<eos> I said "Hello, how are you?"<eos> You said "Fine, dear boy!"<eos> You wanted "Once Upon a Time in Anatolia"<eos> by Nuri Ceylan. I gave it to you.<eos> Why are you sweating so much?<eos> It's so hot.<eos> You wanted another movie too, remember?<eos> I don't!
- What major?<eos> - Directing.<eos> - School of Arts?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm looking for a good subject.<eos> I've seen movies, read lots of books but can't find a good subject.<eos> Listen, those films are already made, those books already written.<eos> You have to look elsewhere.<eos> It won't come just by itself.<eos> What do I do?
Did I buy it?<eos> Yes! Yes, you did.<eos> And I am very grateful.<eos> I'm sure the prosecutor will be, as well.<eos> Lori, there were only three people at the miniature golf the night that Troy Carter was murdered.<eos> It was your husband, Troy and you.<eos> You can't make me testify against my husband.<eos> There's some law about that, isn't there?<eos> Look, your husband didn't kill Troy Carter.<eos> You did.
The gym was right.<eos> New York Fitness.<eos> Broadway and 10th, to be exact.<eos> Viviana's locker had all of this.<eos> Viviana, what were you up to?<eos> Detective Soto, please, sit.<eos> And I hope this can be real quick.<eos> How can I help?<eos> Do you feel you can be completely honest when discussing Detective Diamond's relationship with Captain Broderick?<eos> Yes, I do.
Okay, so, what are you suggesting?<eos> That we let whoever killed Agent Thomas get away with this, as well as whoever's behind everything?<eos> No, I don't...<eos> Look. I want to solve this as fast as you do, okay?<eos> Believe me.<eos> Okay. All right, let's make this quick.<eos> All right, come on.<eos> Agent Thomas was shot through the head, but there were no powder burns, so it couldn't have been from close range.<eos> I still can't work out how the shooter got in here undetected.<eos> Maybe he didn't.
Leave me a message. And I'll call you back, probably.<eos> When did you realize she was gone?<eos> Half an hour ago.<eos> I went to check if she was sleeping.<eos> She'd torn up Lena's room, and she was gone.<eos> Okay, did you call Lena?<eos> Yeah, she's not answering.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We'll find her.<eos> Jack, what if we don't?
You said if I gave them hope, they'd accept me.<eos> Well, I was wrong. Okay?<eos> I failed you.<eos> I gave them too much credit.<eos> They're just not ready.<eos> I'm not sure they'll ever be.<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I should just... go back to being a prisoner in my own house?<eos> I don't know, Camille.<eos> Honestly, I don't.
Well, that's a nice offer, but he's gone.<eos> What do you mean he's gone?<eos> I just took Detective Williams to the plane two hours ago.<eos> He's on his way to Bogotá.<eos> But you find that cocaine, and I can guarantee you that the Colombian government will, uh... will approve that.<eos> Give me 48 hours.<eos> Done.<eos> Good luck.<eos> We have no idea where that cocaine is.<eos> No, we don't.
That was cuddled up with your mama.<eos> I don't know who you're talking about... at the...?<eos> Find out who she is.<eos> Her and your mama are up to something.<eos> Dig.<eos> They know.<eos> If we were suspects, we would've been hauled in already.<eos> Then they're stalling.<eos> You think he was their only witness?<eos> Yes, I do.
If I had to guess, I would say this is part of some larger system designed to access pockets of extra-dimensional space.<eos> Why would somebody want to do that?<eos> I ask myself that question all the time.<eos> Rarely do I get a satisfactory answer.<eos> Right.<eos> Thanks anyways.<eos> Do me a favor, don't tell any of the others about this, okay?<eos> I thought you had resolved to trust them.<eos> Well, some of them anyway.<eos> Yeah, so did I.
It's some kind of infection.<eos> Looks like Two's been exposed.<eos> Your signal's getting stronger.<eos> I'll zero in on it, then see if I can find you an exit point.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Are you sure you want to wait until it begins?<eos> I can give you an honorable death before it comes to that.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> I'd rather have a dishonorable life.<eos> And you did, by all accounts.
I'm a police officer, and I just gave you an order.<eos> You put her up to all this, right?<eos> Maybe it's not even true.<eos> - Maybe he's lying...<eos> - God damn it.<eos> - Stop moving.<eos> - I want you gone.<eos> I want you gone!<eos> The only thing you know is true, Rowan, is that I love you.<eos> - Don't.
Worst bachelorette party I have ever been to.<eos> I hope her fiancé's out getting laid somewhere.<eos> Who's this.<eos> This is Grace, the Reverend's daughter.<eos> Listen to me... this is important.<eos> You promise you haven't shot up any more of that stuff?<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Please don't tell me this is some intervention.<eos> Only reason I haven't called my candy man yet is 'cause you promised you were bringing something even better.<eos> And I did...
So, David tells me you were away for a long time.<eos> Rehab?<eos> Not exactly.<eos> Don't be shy about it.<eos> I've been through 'em all; rehab, psych ward, boarding school.<eos> I should go check on David.<eos> So we're clear, I'm not big on sharing my toys.<eos> David's mine.<eos> I don't mean to cause any trouble.<eos> Oh, but girls like you never do.
But this level of exposure has taxed them beyond design specifications.<eos> I've had to reroute power from some of the ship's other systems to reinforce them.<eos> What caused this?<eos> There are any number of celestial phenomena that can generate this level of gamma radiation, even at interstellar distances.<eos> But in this case I believe we're dealing with the remains of a type 1-A supernova.<eos> It's unfortunate that we happened to emerge from FTL within lethal range.<eos> Yeah, right... This is all just bad luck?<eos> We're supposed to believe this?<eos> You think whoever sabotaged the ship timed this malfunction deliberately to put us in this location?<eos> Damn straight I do.
Likewise.<eos> Gin and tonic, please, uh, governor.<eos> - Nice place.<eos> - It is.<eos> Been here before, then, have you?<eos> - It's my regular spot.<eos> - Oh, right, you're a local.<eos> Nice.<eos> Don't I know you?<eos> Do you?
Sure you're okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Kiss me?<eos> - Jim...<eos> - Kiss me.<eos> - Oh, bugger.<eos> - Alfred.<eos> - You knew, didn't you?<eos> - I didn't know, Alfred.<eos> You did.
Why do you need me to take you?<eos> To vouch for me.<eos> The Pikes are the best arsonists in town, but they're also Fish loyalists.<eos> The idiots think she's coming back someday.<eos> She might come back.<eos> I was there, darlin'.<eos> - She might.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> The Pikes hate me and Penguin, for obvious reasons, but... everyone knows Fish loved you.<eos> They do?
Mr. James if you could begin by telling us where you spent the month of October this year.<eos> Where the hell have you been?<eos> Bullock and I captured one of the monks.<eos> I was right.<eos> They're completing some sort of ritual to cleanse the city of sin.<eos> They have one victim left.<eos> They're calling him the Son of Gotham.<eos> Did they say anything about Galavan?<eos> - I was not kidnapped by Theo Galavan.<eos> - They didn't, did they?
I'm elbow-deep in "I don't care."<eos> (Scoffs) Please, I made Sofia a fake dating profile and every time it dings, it means she got a match.<eos> Don't you want to see?<eos> Are the guys shirtless?<eos> No. Then no.<eos> (Phone chimes) Shoot. Uh...<eos> Ooh, Ruben. Let's see, college graduate, works in marketing, five foot... Eleven!<eos> (Gasps) Oh! Elliot, it looks like we have a match.<eos> Did you know, statistically, cellphones are dirtier than toilet seats?<eos> I did not.
Why isn't there an interpreter here?<eos> - We're working on it.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> You need to face me, please.<eos> We don't have a contract with an interpreter service on the weekends.<eos> So deaf people shouldn't get hurt on the weekends?<eos> It's not my policy.<eos> What about a video phone?<eos> You're supposed to have one of those.<eos> We do.
What did you do to my cupcake?<eos> This is yours?<eos> Why on Earth is your cupcake on my chair?<eos> Because it's very special to me, so I can put it wherever I want.<eos> This is your fault.<eos> Now you have to buy me a new cupcake.<eos> This is outrageous.<eos> You expect me to avoid...<eos> oh, I see.<eos> Mm-hmm. Yeah, you do.
I had it already in a "Tooperware," ready to go.<eos> Wow, that's... so gross, yeah.<eos> Can we ask you a question?<eos> - Mm-hm. - Why do you smell like fish?<eos> Is it hygiene?<eos> No, we spent the night cutting open hundreds of dogfish to see if they had diamonds inside.<eos> - Did they?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yeah. It would be pertinent to the case.<eos> They didn't.
Come on, is that you?<eos> I haven't seen you since Blorgenbergen, man!<eos> Who the hell are you?<eos> Give me a hand, you old dummy.<eos> It's me, Glurg.<eos> NYPD!<eos> Drop it!<eos> Drop it, you're under arrest.<eos> I hope they have saunas in Swedish prison.<eos> They do, actually.
(siren wailing) (horns honking) Just hope we don't run into any wedding guest cops wondering what we're doing here so late,<eos> So let's just get in and out before anybody starts asking any questions.<eos> Yeah, agreed.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, uh, actually, can I ask you a question?<eos> Yeah. Why'd, uh, you and JT break up?<eos> He wasn't supposed to tell you.<eos> He didn't. I just... I used my beast senses.<eos> Vincent, you don't have that power.<eos> No. No, I don't, okay?
Thank you so much for coming, mayor.<eos> As a sign of our respect, please take this chimp servant.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Keep him away from bright lights.<eos> He gets grabby.<eos> Northwests!<eos> You've got some explaining to do.<eos> Dipper, you came back.<eos> You lied to me!<eos> All of you did.
Oh, wait.<eos> Were you in there for, like, an hour?<eos> No.<eos> They found a lump on...<eos> On one of my boys.<eos> You don't mean those boys?<eos> Yes!<eos> What other boys do you have?<eos> But the doctor said you'll be fine. Right?<eos> No, no she did not.
That other guard, Hightower, his fingers were broken, too.<eos> And if I remember right, 7, just like this guy.<eos> The M.E. said Hightower's were defensive wounds.<eos> Probably happened in the struggle during the riot.<eos> I don't see any obvious defensive wounds on him.<eos> Yeah. We need an autopsy.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm gonna go light a fire under Dr. Helpful out here.<eos> I bet all the inmates know exactly what areas are covered by surveillance.<eos> That they do.
We thought we'd lost you there.<eos> How are you feeling?<eos> Okay I guess.<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> Back on the ship.<eos> Guess there's no place like home.<eos> I saw some more of your memories.<eos> I know what happened to you, I know where you're from.<eos> I already know.<eos> You do?
Look, the uhh, the bottom line is she's doing the best she can, but this bucket needs more work than one android can handle.<eos> You can turn around now.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Uhh yeah, we have a damaged relationship.<eos> Do we?<eos> If it gets any worse we're gonna have to shut it down.<eos> A damaged relationship?<eos> Relay switch.<eos> I said relay switch.<eos> No, you didn't.
It killed the virus.<eos> Correct.<eos> And healed the wound itself.<eos> I believe that when you were exposed to the cold of space, the nanites migrated to your skin, joined together and formed a protective shield.<eos> It couldn't have been more than a few microns thick, but it kept you alive.<eos> You knew?<eos> I had my suspicions.<eos> Why didn't you say anything.<eos> I had no idea this technology even existed.<eos> It doesn't, officially.
It's a bloody tragedy.<eos> Yeah, well, it was really bloody.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> It's just one of those things in life that just hits you so hard, and you just think to yourself, wow, it's gonna be weeks before I really, truly get over this.<eos> Chad, I need to talk to you!<eos> It is so sad about Boone, isn't it?<eos> Oh, are you okay?<eos> I mean, how are you feeling?<eos> Uh, I don't know.<eos> How do you...
That's insane.<eos> No, it doesn't, Chanel.<eos> I thought she wasn't allowed to lie.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> My vagina doesn't have teeth.<eos> Can I rephrase the question?<eos> Does your vagina still have teeth?<eos> No!<eos> The answer is no! "No, it no longer has teeth, so it used to have teeth, but you got them removed"?<eos> No, I didn't.
I promise to never betray your trust again.<eos> You most certainly won't betray my trust ever again, because you will never have my trust ever again!<eos> Look, we think you need to contact Number Two, and just give her a chance to do right by you.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> ! How? !<eos> Well, I found this old talking board in the basement.<eos> Yes, they do.<eos> Didn't you see the movie?<eos> The movie Ouija?<eos> No! No one did!
"Hottest Girl in School Figures Out Who the Killer Is," but it was too long.<eos> I mean, I can't believe we did it.<eos> I can't believe this is really over.<eos> I mean there are still so many questions to answer, you know, like, where is the baby and why did Dean Munsch decide to start doing this now, but I don't know, at least we know we're all safe again.<eos> You know how after the first time we kissed, you said we could not keep making out until we found who the killer was.<eos> That's true.<eos> You know, we couldn't waste time kissing when people were in danger.<eos> But now they're no longer in danger.<eos> I mean, you said it yourself.<eos> Did I?
I paint them all.<eos> We are murderers hell-bent on revenge.<eos> Tell me what happened to the baby.<eos> Come to my office, alone.<eos> Well? "Well" what?<eos> You scheduled this meeting;<eos> that means you talk first and I do my best to try to pretend to listen.<eos> You know why I'm here.<eos> You told me if I helped you get out of that asylum, you'd tell me what happened to the baby in the bathtub.<eos> Did I?
Bye.<eos> Bye.<eos> See you, bud.<eos> So, how are you really doing?<eos> Look, I know she was a liar and spent almost 20 years raising and training these innocent children to become mass murderers, but I also really liked her.<eos> She thought I was cool.<eos> You know?<eos> She liked my playlists.<eos> And I believe that even though everything else was a lie that she really liked my playlists.<eos> Aw, she did, Dad.
You want me gone, don't you?<eos> You nearly got Mike killed, so yeah, Paige, I want you out of Graceland, but gone doesn't mean serving life at Leavenworth.<eos> I mean, look, Sid's... Sid's LAPD, okay?<eos> The guy carries a gun.<eos> What if he's inclined to let his gun do the talking?<eos> Then you get him on that.<eos> Look, the answer is no.<eos> Briggs, don't you think it's time that some of us started paying for what we've done?<eos> You know, penance doesn't mean death.<eos> Sometimes it does.
Thank you. [door closes]<eos> I'm moving out.<eos> - Out of what?<eos> - The house.<eos> I just put in my transfer papers.<eos> DEA won't approve it until Sid's behind bars, but, uh... it's happening.<eos> - What?<eos> - You're kidding, right?<eos> You don't have to do this.<eos> Yeah... I do.
Oh, we already talked to SECNAV.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> How did she phrase it?<eos> Uh, "nail the son of a bitch."<eos> For what?<eos> Killing Lieutenant Kutzler's first Medal of Honor nomination.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The packet was routed through your chain of command in 2012, Admiral.<eos> Then it must have got lost in the shuffle before it reached my desk.<eos> Because it never did.
I'm not on birth control.<eos> But we get tested for chlamydia...<eos> How are you keeping from getting pregnant then?<eos> Well, all shoots, they don't come inside you.<eos> Even if it looks like it on camera, they don't.<eos> They always do...<eos> They always do it on you, instead of in you.<eos> You know...<eos> I don't know what to say anymore.<eos> I don't.
-Hi.<eos> It hurts now.<eos> Like, every time I see a porno, I'm like, "That's someone's girlfriend," or, "That's someone's daughter."<eos> - You want to do shots?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Do you want shot glasses? I can grab 'em...<eos> I wanted to get the fuck out of there.<eos> It pisses me off because everyone knows that you were getting almost punish-fucked for money.<eos> It's like you're supposed to have respect for yourself, too.<eos> I do.
I know Jessica told you about Hardman.<eos> Yeah, she did tell me, and I have refrained from coming to see you about blackmailing her out of courtesy.<eos> Courtesy?<eos> You haven't so much as wished me a congratulations.<eos> You want me to kiss the ring, Louis, after what you did?<eos> You're damn right I do, because I don't care how it got up there.<eos> My name is on that wall.<eos> And if I had a crowbar handy...<eos> I would pry it off.<eos> Well, Jeff, you don't.
Rings a bell, doesn't it?<eos> Rings a bell.<eos> Don't play with me, please.<eos> The Book of the Gates is the origin of this Ministry.<eos> And how do you know so much about this Ministry?<eos> I have very good contacts, in my country and in yours.<eos> Can I continue?<eos> Abraham Levi handed over the book to the Queen Isabella of Castile. In exchange for protection.<eos> I think you know the story.<eos> Yes, I do.
This is a delicious meal.<eos> Best meal I've had in some time.<eos> ~ Remember that meal we had Tuesday?<eos> ~ I do. ~ This is better, this meal.<eos> ~ I'm going for a cigarette.<eos> ~ Really?<eos> Do you really have to?<eos> Yup.<eos> Rob, do you smoke?<eos> No, I don't.
- Ship?<eos> San Esteban.<eos> She's a galleon too.<eos> And one of the first to sail, tomorrow at dawn.<eos> Of course, why would it sail later.<eos> Let's not get anxious.<eos> We need to find out the San Esteban's fate.<eos> Maybe she also came back to Spain mostly unharmed.<eos> Okay, I know it's a strange question, being in 1588, but does your grace have a PC at your disposal?<eos> By God I do.
- Yeah.<eos> I don't know if we've changed History with this or not... but if I'm to be honest, I don't give a damn.<eos> What about Amelia?<eos> She was the first to say we had to save your son.<eos> - Is that true?<eos> - It is.<eos> So you can stop complaining about women being in charge,<eos> I never complained.<eos> When did I complain?<eos> Last night you did.
Would you do me the honor of accompanying me?<eos> Where?<eos> To savour our triumph.<eos> It's so moving.<eos> It reminds me of Goya's execution paintings.<eos> I don't understand why it is painted without any colors.<eos> White, black and gray.<eos> As though it were a photograph from a newspaper in a story about the bombing.<eos> I didn't know you knew about art.<eos> I don't.
God has spoken!<eos> God has spoken!<eos> God has spoken.<eos> Let's go.<eos> There's no time to lose.<eos> You should be more careful from now on.<eos> I will be.<eos> I will leave the stage and return to my old life, I have never known anything more dangerous than being a comic.<eos> Do you know how to write?<eos> No, I do not.
I'm admiring you.<eos> All right, then.<eos> Shall we take our royal orders and see where they lead us?<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> You asked for evidence proving the Castleroy's innocence.<eos> This is Castleroy's personal ledger, found in his counting house.<eos> Its contents will confirm guilt rather than innocence.<eos> I don't know how much time I have, but before this is done, there are things I need you to know.<eos> I lied to you, Mary, and that is a treason in itself.<eos> But Aloisius did nothing wrong...
When a person is willing to sacrifice lives for their own petty interests... that is one of those things.<eos> Mary?<eos> I hate to disturb you, but... are you all right?<eos> After everything that happened with Greer.<eos> The truth?<eos> No, I'm not all right.<eos> I've been thinking about all that we've been through, my ladies and I.<eos> And sometimes I wonder if I should have even brought them with me.<eos> I would have felt very alone if I hadn't.<eos> As I do now.
I don't owe you loyalty!<eos> What's wrong, brother?<eos> Isn't she cooperating?<eos> Brother?<eos> No, she's not cooperating.<eos> She's being a stubborn little fool.<eos> Calm down, Hunter.<eos> He didn't mean that.<eos> He cares about you, Beth.<eos> We all do.
I wouldn't leave evidence lying around anywhere, including my boat.<eos> Is this what being a cop has done to you?<eos> Made you suspicious of everyone?<eos> No, just people who lie to me.<eos> For the last time, Laura,<eos> I wasn't lying, I was just reluctant to discuss the intimate details of my...<eos> - Hooker habit?<eos> - Dammit, Laura!<eos> You know I didn't do this.<eos> - I don't.
She certainly looks like you.<eos> - Minus the red hair. - Yeah.<eos> It was very nice to meet you.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> So down there.<eos> Yes.<eos> All right.<eos> These guys are nut jobs at best and dangerous at worst.<eos> Now, how did you know where to find them?<eos> I just did, all right?
Oh, for-<eos> - Ray, take a picture of him!<eos> Where's my stupid phone?<eos> In Soviet Russia--<eos> Pam?<eos> --Toaster take picture of you.<eos> Doesn't even make sense.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> You don't make sense.<eos> It totally does.
I can. I will. I...<eos> I can get my own coffee all day long. I just... Owen.<eos> Thank you for bringing me the coffee.<eos> I really like it.<eos> Uh, you're welcome.<eos> So, how's my head?<eos> The tumor seems stable.<eos> I was worried about the inferomedial margin, but the good news is, there's no sign of growth.<eos> It hasn't invaded the optic nerve yet.<eos> Well, how long till it does?
Arizona and Herman... they're practically joined at the hip.<eos> Arizona: I'll take one of those, too.<eos> Well, she is Herman's fellow.<eos> Isn't she sort of supposed to follow Herman around?<eos> They're laughing all the time, [ Nicole and Arizona laughing ] And Arizona seems so...<eos> Happy... Like really happy.<eos> So?<eos> You seem happy...<eos> Ish. What do you even care?<eos> I don't, obviously.
That's final.<eos> Dr. Stanley, please report... I am going to give you more than a few months.<eos> I am going to save your life.<eos> And I am about to get up in front of a bunch of people and tell them how I plan on doing it.<eos> It makes it really hard for me to do that or even care about doing that when you don't seem to care at all!<eos> Well, that's your problem.<eos> Well, the word's spreading. This was a good idea, hunt...<eos> This is gonna put Amelia Shepherd on the map. Mm. Unless it fails.<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does...
W... excuse me?<eos> If I survive the surgery but don't wake up, give me five days...<eos> A week, tops...<eos> Then pull the plug.<eos> This is... We don't need to be talking about this.<eos> If I do wake up but I'm dependent on vents or tubes, pull the plug then, too.<eos> Y-you know what?<eos> You're not... you're not dying.<eos> Shepherd knows what she's doing.<eos> She does.

She does!
So, you have no idea where Haley is right now?<eos> You mean spiritually, geographically?<eos> Can you please stop spinning that sign?<eos> No. My boss says if I do, he'll replace me with one of those guys!<eos> Go back to where you came from!<eos> Dylan, focus! I don't know where she is, but I can sense that she's okay.<eos> It's like we share the same brain. Who has it now?<eos> Okay, so, last night when you were with her, she didn't say anything about getting married?<eos> Haley got married? ! That's so upsetting!<eos> Done.
The Witness!<eos> CRANE. Uh, I'm sorry.<eos> "The... Witness"?<eos> That's the technical term for us.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> How are you here?<eos> Oh, Abigail,<eos> I have so many questions.<eos> So do I. And God do I wish we had more time.<eos> But we don't.
Katrina, no!<eos> She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh!<eos> Wow.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.
She killed my son.<eos> She dies.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Oh...<eos> Oh!<eos> Wow.<eos> You had no choice.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> We all did.
And I'm warning you, you stay away.<eos> I am a billionaire and I can buy my way out of at least one murder.<eos> This is still America.<eos> So, what looks good?<eos> And don't say my boobs.<eos> Why would I say "my boobs"<eos> when it's your boobs that I like?<eos> Have you thought about us?<eos> I want to give it a try.<eos> Oh, you do?
The full story will have to wait, since we have more pressing issues.<eos> A D.U.I. with a child in the car...<eos> Is a felony. I know.<eos> What am I gonna do?<eos> We're gonna fight it.<eos> But I need to know...<eos> Were you drinking?<eos> I didn't have a drop.<eos> You have to believe me.<eos> I do.
I was afraid.<eos> That night, when I got back from the party,<eos> I found Lyman here snooping through your black laptop.<eos> What? !<eos> Okay, there's a lot of sensitive material in there.<eos> What did he see?<eos> Doesn't much matter now.<eos> Who's he gonna tell?<eos> Louise...<eos> Did you...
Russell, are those for me?<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> - How is she?<eos> - She's fine.<eos> Good. Then I'll just go in and convey the president's best wishes.<eos> I said she's fine, Russell.<eos> Tell that to the Chinese.<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> Hope you're right, Henry.<eos> I really do.
No, because they thought you died back in '94.<eos> Let's face it.<eos> Creatively, Johnny, you kind of did.<eos> The fact the band broke up the day the album came out made you Belgian cult heroes...<eos> Very devoted fans.<eos> So when Johnny OD'd on blow two years later...<eos> Which I warned you about.<eos> The "I don't want to die anonymous" verse of Sex Drugs became the fan base's mission statement.<eos> They didn't want you to die anonymous.<eos> Who does, right?
Just say "too much." Don't fancy-pants me.<eos> You know the expression "Beggars can't be choosers".<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I don't think you do.<eos> You're not giving any of these guys a shot.<eos> Hey, if I don't get the right vibe, I'm not gonna waste my time.<eos> What about my time?<eos> If I wasn't doing this, I'd... you know, still be here, but I'd be drunk by now.<eos> Hey, I've been watching you try to help your friend meet someone, and I think it's very sweet.<eos> You do?
Meet my son Damon.<eos> He's here to take us home.<eos> There you are.<eos> Definite role model material.<eos> Damon really spent 5 years in a cell with you without killing himself?<eos> A fellow smartass.<eos> I can see why you're his drinking buddy, though you're gonna have to knock off the hard stuff while you're breastfeeding, mate.<eos> You know, what are you even doing here?<eos> I thought you hated Stefan.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just because you're an amateur doesn't mean you have to act like one.<eos> Ladies and gents, that's lunch!<eos> One hour. It's a walk away.<eos> And I mean one hour. No dillying, no dallying.<eos> Susie, I am impressed with your knowledge of the professional theater regulations.<eos> Very impressed.<eos> All right, reach down and stretch. Touch your toes.<eos> That's it.<eos> Feel the burn.<eos> And, uh... do that thing. The arm thing.
Fine.<eos> Well, if one of us drug addicts has nicked it,<eos> I'll get you another one.<eos> I don't fucking want another one!<eos> This one's got all my stuff on it.<eos> I need it for my interview.<eos> Oh, do you know what?<eos> Don't worry, you don't understand.<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> - No, you don't!
Just think, I could have my very own Sophie and Anna<eos> - and Sam and Tina...<eos> - Stop it.<eos> What a thing to teach a kid!<eos> How women rip each other's hearts out in the name of love.<eos> What a lesson!<eos> That's what this is about?<eos> - You want an apology.<eos> - Yes!<eos> Yes, I do!
I was ready to give up everything for Max when he got shot.<eos> I mean, school, my future.<eos> And now it seems like...<eos> Forgiving Crash is more important to him than I am.<eos> - (Muffled arguing continues) - That's not true.<eos> Well, Max is fine with it, so...<eos> Yeah, because he's Max.<eos> That's not how he really feels, though.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do, Tay.
I'm supposed to get Carter.<eos> Hey. Sorry, we were up late talking.<eos> Family meeting in the living room.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> But I'm not getting a "Hey, kids!<eos> , we're going to Disneyland" vibe out of it.<eos> - They're getting divorced.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Because I'm married to your mother.<eos> You and mom are separated, though.<eos> - As of this morning.<eos> - So, you're saying if you had more time, you'd be dating her.<eos> No, I'm not saying that.<eos> So you want to stay with mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> Does mom want to stay with you?<eos> I hope so, Grant.<eos> I really do.
I miss us too.<eos> There we are.<eos> Where?<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I mean... I think...<eos> We should be us again.<eos> Together.<eos> You want to get back together?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- that kind of thing.<eos> - (David) Excellent idea.<eos> A calendar.<eos> So helpful.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay, so you want to get the stuff on the list or do you want to make up the schedule?<eos> I'll get the groceries.<eos> Did you mean what you said about us working things out?<eos> Yeah, yes.<eos> I did.
Please sit.<eos> Veg with me.<eos> I'm sorry you're going through all of this.<eos> You know, it's just that we're the kids, the one's who are supposed to be getting into trouble and causing problems.<eos> And yet, we're the ones doing all the adult stuff while our parents are out there being irresponsible and reckless.<eos> Yeah, I'm starting to think it might be nice if all I had to worry about was prom and whether or not I'm gonna look like a dork in my yearbook photo, rather than constantly feeling like<eos> To... adulting.<eos> To adulting.<eos> So does this mean you figured out what to do with those files?<eos> Yeah, I did.
See if you can move this...<eos> Here she is!<eos> Basualdo, get a doctor! - Ordóñez!<eos> - Now, listen to me, ma'am...<eos> Look at me, ma'am.<eos> We're the police.<eos> It's all right, it's all over now.<eos> Look! There she is!<eos> Do you know her or not?<eos> - Do you? - No, sir.
That's the address.<eos> You have no idea how many times I wanted to burn that piece of paper.<eos> How long will you be gone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come here.<eos> You be safe and you come home soon.<eos> We haven't got many days left.<eos> I don't want to be alone at the end.<eos> I know, Mum.<eos> None of us do.
I am here to avenge my girlfriend.<eos> You take her purse, I take your life.<eos> This is what you do when I'm watching your kid?<eos> Here, baby.<eos> - You know I could take him, right?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> But if he teams up with and beary and squirrely, you're a goner.<eos> Mom, you know I tried to take out that mugger, right?<eos> - I do. - And you know how much it hurts to get pepper-sprayed, right?<eos> I do.

He maintains the ability to communicate over the deadman network, so he can still cause trouble.<eos> With the wide radio call, We've hopefully given a large enough number of people enough time to make it to the port.<eos> As we pull in to shore, you'll all be given booster shots to compliment the vaccinations already running through your bodies.<eos> Within an hour, these boosters will make you vessels for the contagious cure.<eos> For how long?<eos> You'll be contagious for five to eight days, during which time, it is imperative that you pass it on to as many people as possible, who will then have five to eight days to do the same, and so on.<eos> We need a minimum of 10,000 people at each stop to sufficiently spread the cure across these sections of the country.<eos> What about dropping the cure from the sky?<eos> Didn't you find a way to make the aerosol work?<eos> I did.
You remember.<eos> You... you... you took pity on me, and I am glad for it.<eos> Ray, where's Tracy?<eos> Call's coming from an unlisted number.<eos> He's on a burner phone.<eos> Still triangulating.<eos> The wind was blowing, and we just... we rolled down the windows even though it was cold.<eos> We didn't even care because the music was blasting on the stereo.<eos> You remember that?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I got to go.<eos> - Go away from here.<eos> You stink like a she goat at mating time.<eos> We don't want to smell your shit all night.<eos> 8 pesos, Presidente.<eos> I did not bet that bird, chuparlo.<eos> Yes, you did, mi General.<eos> 8 pesos.<eos> How is it you have 8 pesos to bet with?<eos> As a fact, I do, Excellency.
The man retreats to victory and then transmogrifies himself by grog house gaggle into a hero... a hero that'll sweep his ass right into this office.<eos> That's President Jackson.<eos> He and Houston want to annex our Texas.<eos> Always been his plan to suck Texas up in the states.<eos> We'll publicize the fact that the... the big drunk, he abandoned his post with a wound that didn't prevent him from whoring and boozing while Texas wallows in hunger and chaos.<eos> Expose his unholy affinity for savages.<eos> Yes, he's the greatest curse that Providence in all its wrath has sent to our country.<eos> Sullied the reputation of countless women, abandoned two wives.<eos> If the people truly knew him as we do...<eos> But they do.
He fished me and Colby out of the river after we separated from you.<eos> Well, I'm obliged to you, certainly, but you got any further business with my fiancée?<eos> Gavin, I...<eos> With due regard, mister, I love this woman.<eos> She loves me.<eos> And I'll take one hell of an ass whooping, won't lift a hand.<eos> But she ain't getting on this wagon.<eos> Is that true?<eos> You love him?<eos> I do.
It is. He frickin' has a giant crack right up his butt.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It's true.<eos> Moon him. Moon him, Ders.<eos> Do not moon me.<eos> Not here.<eos> Not-- - Look at it.<eos> - [grunts] Look at that.<eos> [quietly] You think you can moon me without consequences?<eos> Huh? Do you?
My dragoons can be anywhere on the battlefield they're needed, whether it's to harass Clinton's flanks or to punch holes through his lines.<eos> And we're damn good scouts as well.<eos> You'll be serving under my direct command, is that clear?<eos> It is... sir.<eos> Miss Shippen.<eos> I am so pleased that you could come.<eos> I was happy to, if only to thank you again for your intervention with that mob.<eos> Of course.<eos> Did you see the house?<eos> I did.
Neither could we.<eos> That's why we're here.<eos> Oh, Danny, I'm so sorry.<eos> I should have just told you how I feel.<eos> But I guess I'm still figuring it out too, you know.<eos> I mean...<eos> I like Danny Wheeler.<eos> Oh my God, how crazy is that?<eos> It's true.<eos> I do.
Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Rae!<eos> Is that...<eos> Katie Springer?<eos> !<eos> Hang on, who's Katie Springer?<eos> She looks amazing.<eos> - Yeah, If you like that kind of thing.<eos> - Which everyone does.
- Me and Finn.<eos> When we saw you leaving.<eos> So I just wanted to check to see if you were OK.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> No. No, it's fine.<eos> He's a big softie, isn't he?<eos> I had no idea he was so sensitive.<eos> Well, don't you remember him from college?<eos> Never talked to me at college.<eos> No-one did.
Fuck!<eos> - Leave him.<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> You don't understand.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> That wasn't our plan.<eos> - Now we can't go to Mexico.<eos> - Théo, look at me.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I never did.
Neil, those aren't my type.<eos> What is your type?<eos> I don't think I've ever known.<eos> Well, he's handsome... with a sense of humor.<eos> He's successful, and a little mysterious,<eos> and he's got to be great in bed.<eos> But he's also sweet and someone I'd want to have my children with, someone I can trust.<eos> That's a tall order.<eos> Where you gonna find someone like that?<eos> I did it once.
What?<eos> Your avatar.<eos> See, you're the one on top.<eos> Push the joystick.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To kill me.<eos> - You missed.<eos> - Marissa,<eos> - I don't want to do this right now.<eos> - Yes, you do.
It goes over your head.<eos> He's putting a sweater on a sweater?<eos> Get over it.<eos> Get over it.<eos> That's nice, very nice.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> I love this so much.<eos> Schmidt, isn't there something you want to ask your mother about?<eos> Well,<eos> I did...
Must be our guy.<eos> What do you think he wants?<eos> What, he can't just be a good Samaritan?<eos> Tip about a possible missing NSA agent out of the goodness of his heart?<eos> Maybe in Kansas.<eos> Never want to meet at a Starbucks, do they?<eos> No, they don't.
And then you stumbled into the immunes, and they told you that it was all meant to be and that you were chosen and your children were not and that all of this was destiny.<eos> And it was easy for you to believe because you needed to believe it...<eos> Because it was the only way to go on.<eos> There's another way now.<eos> With us.<eos> - I killed my daughters.<eos> - I know.<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
May I ask why didn't you deliver it in person like she asked?<eos> - Well, because she's fucking crazy. - Ah.<eos> She has been trying to shake down Vernon Littlefield. Now she's trying to shake down me.<eos> Trash like this is why I didn't want you here in the first place.<eos> - Joe mentioned that.<eos> - Joe is a fucking idiot.<eos> No, Joe's not a fucking idiot.<eos> Joe hired me to bring in big money players, protect the wealth, and capitalize on the success of men in a world that, with all due respect, Mr. Anderson, you don't know anything about with the exception of when you watch the Red Zone Channel on your very big fuckin' flat screen.<eos> Monetize my friendships is what Joe's been preaching to me from the moment I walked in the door, and I always thought that that came directly from you.<eos> Everything does except the bad shit.
Really?<eos> That's... that's your name.<eos> It is now.<eos> Who's your friend?<eos> Hey, this is... between you and me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You think you can handle me all by yourself?<eos> You're kind of a... A wild girl?<eos> You really don't want to know.<eos> I do.
It'll be okay.<eos> What happened?<eos> It's gone.<eos> You okay?<eos> No.<eos> I know what you did.<eos> You and your two buddies Declan and Killburn beat Simon George's father to death.<eos> How the hell would you know that?<eos> 'Cause I saw it.<eos> Sure, you did.
I think we should do it right here.<eos> On the ground?<eos> No, no way.<eos> You don't trust me.<eos> Why should I?<eos> Because I'm just trying to protect myself and my baby from being killed by Juliette.<eos> You've seen what she is now.<eos> I have.<eos> You think I planned all of this?<eos> I don't.
I was busy.<eos> I left her on Couch and Third.<eos> And we usually check in on each other every hour, and she didn't come home.<eos> I went looking for her.<eos> I didn't find her till this morning.<eos> We were supposed to look out for each other, and I let her down.<eos> Look, I'm just gonna cut to the chase.<eos> I'm a Grimm, and I know you're a Klaustreich.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about...<eos> Yeah, you do.
We've pulled officers from the 3rd and 8th precincts to help.<eos> If there's a witness out there, we'll find them.<eos> How about video?<eos> The immediate area where you found her car didn't have any street-cam or security coverage.<eos> Making it the perfect place for an abduction.<eos> I have teams from four precincts pulling all video in a 10-block radius from where Beckett was taken.<eos> It's a long shot, but...<eos> What about Amy Barrett... the phone call she made to Beckett?<eos> Can we trace that?<eos> We did... to a cellphone.
If this were Asia we could eat you with mushy peas.<eos> Water...<eos> For dear God do not slam the bloody door!<eos> - Stop shouting!<eos> - I'll shout if I want to!<eos> Your breath, it smells like a fart.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> You're probably wondering why I wanted to see you.<eos> Something to do with Liam?
Okay. Where are we, DiNozzo?<eos> We are in the big orange room.<eos> We know where are.<eos> Where are you?<eos> McGee hasn't pinged my phone yet?<eos> Actually, boss, yeah, I-I did.<eos> Really?<eos> You didn't tell us?<eos> Well, I didn't know if he'd want me to.<eos> I don't.
Juliette was there.<eos> How could she be there if she got on that helicopter?<eos> That's what I thought too.<eos> But she didn't.<eos> She came back to kill Nick.<eos> At least that's what Nick told me.<eos> - Where's Juliette now?<eos> - She's dead.<eos> Nick killed Juliette?<eos> No. Trubel did.
You just did.<eos> Maybe that's the best I can do.<eos> Nick is not gonna let you go unless you tell him where she is.<eos> If I don't answer that, someone will start looking for me.<eos> And it won't be the FBI.<eos> If I don't like anything you say, they can look all they want, but they'll never find you.<eos> Don't answer it.<eos> I need to send my thumbprint so they know it's me.<eos> Wait a minute; how do we know she didn't just send a distress signal?<eos> You don't.
I'm sorry, Clark. I, uh...<eos> Martha, where are you going?<eos> To my parents'.<eos> I need a break.<eos> We need a break.<eos> - Martha--<eos> - No, um...<eos> I can't take it.<eos> Everyone at work knows that I'm lying.<eos> - No, no, they don't.
- How does it go?<eos> - Very well.<eos> You can go back to your position, Samuel.<eos> - Well, what's happening?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You don't know?<eos> - No.<eos> Mrs. Anselmi, you picked up discount tickets?<eos> No, I threw them away, as usual.<eos> No, Mrs. Anselmi, you didn't.
I have explained to you.<eos> You know how serious I am.<eos> We can find a way.<eos> The problem we have now between us, Mrs. Anselmi, Is the trust.<eos> There is no more trust.<eos> I can not work with people I don't trust.<eos> I trust you.<eos> - But I don't.<eos> I don't.<eos> I did.
Then I withdraw my report.<eos> Nothing happened here, and you can be on your way.<eos> Well, someone's, uh, taking shots at residents in my county, - that's a public-safety issue.<eos> - Aw, please!<eos> I don't care if you file a report or not.<eos> I'm compelled to investigate.<eos> You and I both know you did this.<eos> Actually, based on how quickly you pulled that press conference together, I'm inclined to think maybe you did this.<eos> - I shot at myself?<eos> - Sure you did.
Peter's not coming back.<eos> Your son and his friend were robbed last night, and during the course of the robbery, your son, Peter, he was shot.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> What about Jerry?<eos> Is Jerry okay?<eos> Uh, Jerry's alive.<eos> Thank God. Thank God.<eos> So, I-I guess...<eos> I guess you know Jerry?<eos> Oh, I do.
He's not the most popular guy around here. Yeah.<eos> That'd be you.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Vic, come on.<eos> Obviously, you're pissed off about something, something about me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I am pissed off at myself 'cause I'm so stupid.<eos> - I thought you wanted me to call you.<eos> - I did! Really?
I don't?<eos> I was so worried, I paid Yolanda to watch me sleep.<eos> That's so sweet!<eos> - Did you do anything weird?<eos> - No.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Who cares what we do in our sleep?<eos> We can be ourselves.<eos> We love each other.<eos> - We do?
So I don't know if these are related, but I also noticed these postmortem moustache-shaped fracture lines on the parietal.<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's a standard two-pronged hook inside of a high school locker.<eos> The victim's head was shoved against it.<eos> Wait, how did you know that?<eos> Because in high school, I was shoved in a locker multiple times.<eos> This also explains the victim's shoulder injuries.<eos> Before I tell Booth about this, do you really think your strategy of photographing ourselves...<eos> Taking a selfie.<eos> And yes, I do.
Since what's the difference?<eos> Where'd you get it?<eos> It really doesn't matter.<eos> It does.<eos> There are some seriously bad pills out there, all right?<eos> And I really think we should<eos> - take you to a doctor...<eos> - The pills were fine.<eos> And how do you know that?<eos> - Because I do.
No, I won't, I promise.<eos> Do you know what you want out of this?<eos> No.<eos> But Max, that woman raised me.<eos> She's such a huge part of who I am.<eos> Look.<eos> If she had actually killed herself and I had never seen her again, I just know I would spend the rest of my life wondering why on earth I didn't at least try and help her.<eos> Please, can you understand that?<eos> Yeah, I can.<eos> And I do.
I don't even know why I didn't think I cared anymore.<eos> But I wasn't thinking straight.<eos> I couldn't talk.<eos> I just...<eos> I don't know, he was just there.<eos> And I know that's not an excuse... in any way.<eos> But I promise you it didn't mean anything.<eos> Crash, I was out of my mind.<eos> Please believe me.<eos> I do.
You're lucky she's here, cos if it was up to me, I'd shoot ya.<eos> But Rhonda is a good girl.<eos> And I think you should know that about her.<eos> You have a good night now, ma'am.<eos> Feeling it now, huh?<eos> The guilt?<eos> You need to let me go and give yourself up.<eos> I can't go back to jail.<eos> You need to know I didn't choose any of this.<eos> No, you did.
Well, despite all that, today's going to be fun, Dad!<eos> Will there be lots of other girls there?<eos> For some reason, there's been a lot of infertility at the nuclear plant.<eos> After we show you the wealth of jobs in the steno pool, a hearty luncheon of bison with lake beaver will be served.<eos> And upon leaving, you will each receive a piece of orangewood to bite down on during childbirth.<eos> Excellent.<eos> It's getting harder and harder to maintain my sunny disposition, Smithers.<eos> Oh, you're always my ray of...<eos> Shut up.<eos> Dad, what does that do?
I am the puberty demon.<eos> For a thousand lifetimes of man,<eos> I have been going through changes I don't understand.<eos> You can join me if you just take her hand.<eos> I'd certainly like to help a demon, but I...<eos> Do it.<eos> Enter the world of body spray, wiry hairs and wondering what boobs feel like.<eos> Do you know?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> Of course I do.
His mom had mental problems. She kept him trapped down there for years, And my partner and i were there to arrest her for hoarding,<eos> Of all things.<eos> And i was this close to missing him--like, this close.<eos> But i got lucky, and i found him.<eos> Damn. So when i tell stories,<eos> Aubrey.<eos> What?<eos> That's my name. Aubrey.<eos> - Wait, aubrey. - Hey!<eos> Hey, no, don't do that.
~ Always hated that name, as you know damn well!<eos> ~ Where's he put the damn...<eos> Bhupi? ~ Yes, Sahib.<eos> Ah!<eos> What do you think?<eos> Congratulations! A picnic rug?<eos> Ta-da!<eos> Well... .. don't you recognise it?<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Where on earth did you...
- Come on, you know you want it.<eos> - You don't know what I want.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
This is actually why we're here in Wales.<eos> To try to save our marriage.<eos> Oh, my God, baby.<eos> I think it's working.<eos> Are you joking or insane?<eos> Do you really expect me to believe you came to Wales for a romantic getaway?<eos> Easy, bro.<eos> Wales is kickass!<eos> I mean if this weren't a romantic getaway, would I be doing this?<eos> I do, because we did.
Let's cut it together.<eos> Oh. Big box.<eos> Kevin cut the cord when Jenna was born.<eos> Just cut the damn cake.<eos> I'm back!<eos> I couldn't commit to Biggie until I had a chance to see the world, so I decided to pull an "Eat, Play, Love."<eos> I skipped the Ashram part.<eos> Curry doesn't always agree with me.<eos> You don't want to know what curry does to a pregnant woman.<eos> No, we really don't.
Hate to rain on your parade.<eos> Speaking of parade, what's up with the twirling? Did you not hear that F bomb I dropped on that Clement rep?<eos> I wanted to make a strong impression, but... not like that.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> What did Theo say?<eos> Not talking about it.<eos> I'm focusing on my future.<eos> Tomorrow, I will make a lasting second impression via my lifelong passion for baton.<eos> You don't have a lifelong passion for baton.<eos> Uh, yeah, Amy, I do.
But Reagan is going on tour this summer, and she invited me to come, so... maybe I'll just do that.<eos> What... you're kidding, right?<eos> What about getting into Clement?<eos> Um... maybe college just... isn't my thing.<eos> I gotta... I gotta go.<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Amy!<eos> Look... I know why you're trying to help me out.<eos> Oh, y-you do.
I'm here about Castiel.<eos> Was there any of his Grace left?<eos> Question is, are you willing to pay for it?<eos> He must be returned intact.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Told you last time I saw you I'd get out of the slammer.<eos> We need to know how to remove the Mark of Cain from Dean's arm.<eos> He's gone nuclear!<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Actually, I did.
Course, this was before...<eos> Before she got famous?<eos> No. Before she hit on me.<eos> I told her I wasn't into girls.<eos> But...<eos> I think she was confused by the derby.<eos> Yeah. I think we're all a little confused by it.<eos> Nola, I want to ask you if you've ever had any success, but I don't know how to do that without insulting you.<eos> That's correct.<eos> You don't.
Hello.<eos> Ah.<eos> Apparently, She was more discreet than you.<eos> It's okay?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> You want me to call a doctor?<eos> But wait!<eos> Good...<eos> He looks so bad.<eos> We didn't do anything serious?
unknowable and yet terrifying plot for world domination.<eos> So Tuesday then? Your average Tuesday.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What are we gonna do about it?<eos> We're gonna try to stop him.<eos> Okay, let's go home and make some plans.<eos> I already have a few ideas.<eos> Save them for the meeting.<eos> Yeah, I don't really like meetings.<eos> No one does, Flynn.
And there's all these rumors about rituals in the basement... animal sacrifices and stuff.<eos> Peter heard all this from Professor Bancroft in his architecture class.<eos> Professor Bancroft?<eos> Professor Roger Bancroft teaches here?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> Professor Bancroft is... is the authority on Colonial American architecture, man.<eos> You are so lucky!<eos> I-I-I would... I would have killed to have taken classes from... from... from...<eos> And you... you don't even care.<eos> Nobody does, mate.
You think I'm just being crazy?<eos> I mean, if it was your grandfather, what would you do?<eos> I don't have a grandfather, but my grandmother raised me, and if I thought someone was messing with her, I'd turn over every stone until I knew damn sure she was safe.<eos> But I might be a little crazy, too.<eos> Listen, get me fingerprints or DNA, and I can take this to the next level.<eos> Just let me know what you want.<eos> That was nice meeting Father Barnes.<eos> I think you're in good hands.<eos> So, uh... did you read the letter?<eos> Yeah, I did.
I had her checked out.<eos> Mm. Sylvia Hayden is not her real name.<eos> In fact, she's had many identities.<eos> And?<eos> And... she has a history with older men.<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> Erin, I'm an ex-cop.<eos> You think I didn't do my own digging?<eos> Of course she's got a past.<eos> Who doesn't?
- You wouldn't have seen me again.<eos> - Why?<eos> You didn't try to.<eos> I didn't think of it.<eos> - You didn't want to.<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Marianne, I liked you as soon as I saw you.<eos> - Do you love me?<eos> - Of course.<eos> No, you don't.
You could die.<eos> Yes, I am scared.<eos> Of course I'm scared, but what else can I do?<eos> You could...<eos> Lie to Dominique?<eos> Lie my whole life?<eos> - He might look like Gilbert.<eos> - Maybe he'd understand.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But what if he didn't?
When Henry didn't return my calls, I had a colleague in San Francisco ping his cell.<eos> So you found him in the park?<eos> When I got there, he was already dead.<eos> So I took his phone and his keys, and I began to investigate.<eos> And why didn't you call us from the crime scene?<eos> 'Cause I didn't want to waste my time having this conversation.<eos> My friend has been murdered.<eos> I have to find out who did it.<eos> No.<eos> I do.
They look cozy.<eos> Who's that with Carrie?<eos> Hunter Ellis.<eos> Has a long sheet. Could be involved in the heist.<eos> He took a shine to Carrie.<eos> Really?<eos> How come I'm just hearing about him now.<eos> She just remembered him from a pile of photographs of Ganz's associates.<eos> It's not that you have a history of lying, but you have a history of lying.<eos> We both do.
Yes.<eos> Hello, Mr. Canning.<eos> - Hi. - And now, you work for Florrick, Agos Lockhart.<eos> And once Mr. Lyman came to you and Canning and told you he was leaving, did you try to outbid for his services?<eos> - We did.<eos> - In other words, you understood his oral agreement to be genuine.<eos> - We did.<eos> - That's all we need.<eos> Howard doesn't need to understand the particulars of his contract.<eos> You did.
- Cam.<eos> - What?<eos> She's in karate.<eos> It's not offensive.<eos> Debatable, but why would you schedule all this extra stuff on the same day as her talent show?<eos> Okay, are you accusing me of overscheduling our tone-deaf daughter so she's so tired she misses the talent show and doesn't humiliate herself?<eos> Lily has no talent.<eos> Because she's 7.<eos> No one has talent at 7.<eos> I did.
He's the worst.<eos> So bad.<eos> And, um... strictly from a keeping-my-job standpoint, it would be so dope if you told him that.<eos> Oh.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> I can't fire my dad!<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It must be hard, but you realize it's the best thing for the company.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Why?<eos> And don't tell me I know why.<eos> Because it would have been a mistake, and you know it.<eos> What I know is something happened, and you ran away, but not before you told me you loved me.<eos> I did that because I wanted to make you feel better.<eos> What did you just say to me?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I didn't say that--<eos> Because you pity me?<eos> Yeah, you did.
- You're welcome.<eos> My mother's 55.<eos> You know, and if she's only here because Forstman pays for it--<eos> I know.<eos> Harvey wants us to find the person Woodall's close to.<eos> That's all we can do.<eos> Well, "all we can do"<eos> is gonna send her back to some horrible facility.<eos> - We don't exactly know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
- She has Alzheimer's.<eos> - Don't tell me.<eos> He moved her to a high-end facility and pays for round-the-clock care.<eos> And the problem is, we called the company that handles the billing, and--<eos> And everything's in cash up front, probably paid five years in advance.<eos> And Mary Ann couldn't tell you because she doesn't speak.<eos> Which mean we don't have any proof.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I'm gonna go get us some proof.<eos> You did this?
Actually, I don't care.<eos> I take that back.<eos> I do care, because you are killing my buzz.<eos> Why, are you celebrating?<eos> To the end of my career.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I'm the one who vetted those Afghan soldiers.<eos> I convinced the DoD to trust them.<eos> Do you feel confident in the Intel you gathered about them?<eos> I did.
Uh-huh. But this is like watching a super awkward car accident.<eos> Right. Exactly.<eos> I'm going nowhere.<eos> Yes. ...I want you to know this is going to be on you.<eos> We'll, uh, we'll be here f...<eos> She just hung up on me.<eos> Rough call?<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> No, thank you, Mr. Beale.<eos> I don't.
No long-term relationships?<eos> It's a hard-enough job as it is, but with no one to go home to...<eos> Never met the right guy.<eos> I realize it may be uncomfortable for you to talk about your personal life, but I just want to give you an opportunity to tell me anything I might need to know.<eos> Any romantic relationship that could have possibly compromised you in any way?<eos> I don't date much.<eos> I was involved with an agent in the office a couple of years ago-- Chris Amador.<eos> Yes. I think I was more involved with him than he was with me.<eos> But I'm sure you know what happened with Agent Amador.<eos> I do.
All of the extra precautions at the lab,<eos> - and all of this hovering.<eos> - I'm being responsible.<eos> I'm not your responsibility.<eos> Yes, in fact, you are.<eos> When you're in a stitch, and you're waltzing around some dead person's memory, it is my job to keep you safe.<eos> I know what I signed up for and I know all the risks.<eos> All the risks?<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Found it!<eos> Wait. What about the lockbox?<eos> Oh, Korath took off with that long before you rescued me.<eos> What?<eos> You think I was gonna leave without my personal property?<eos> I'd say it was worth the side trip.<eos> You expect to walk out the front door loaded down with that stuff?<eos> Who said anything about walking?<eos> You don't mess with the Rocket unless you know how to fly!<eos> Which they do!
He came here in a bubble.<eos> For all we know, he could be the David Berkowitz of Nutsackland.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Here, put these on.<eos> They'll sync your possibilities up so I can bring you back to certain time.<eos> Y'all are just -- just -- just negligent.<eos> See, now -- now look right here.<eos> Hey, hey, hey, the three of you, put your collars on.<eos> - We have them on. - What are you talking about?<eos> - Uh, we did.
He thinks the moon is a hologram being projected by the FBI to hypnotize Americans into submission.<eos> Told you, certifiable.<eos> I am killing it today.<eos> This is my least favorite hour of the month.<eos> You say that every month.<eos> Then why do I keep doing it?<eos> Opening the floodgates, giving voice... nay, valuable office hours... to the crackpots and the crazies?<eos> You're the dutiful servant of the American people, and the American people need their pulse taken.<eos> The American people believe the air force is chemically neutering us when it snows, Holly.<eos> - This next lady doesn't.
The president asked you to serve, and you said yes.<eos> So before you turn your back on a job that only 47 people have had in the history of this nation, I need to hear why you said yes in the first place.<eos> I have a 10-year-old daughter.<eos> Her name is Casey.<eos> I want her and every other child in this country to grow up in a nation that will allow them to fulfill their dreams just like I'm doing right now.<eos> Well, that's very inspiring, senator Ross.<eos> But the truth is, if confirmed, you will be one horrible tragedy away from the presidency.<eos> With your lack of experience, how do I know that you're prepared to protect us against Russia or the North Koreans?<eos> Simple.<eos> You don't.
And you're getting that damn game, Phil!<eos> What in the name of "Pac-Man" creator Toru Iwatani<eos> - have you done?<eos> ! - You deserve it.<eos> You work hard.<eos> You provide for your family.<eos> No regrets.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't regret it.<eos> 'Course you don't.
Yes.<eos> We went in there with the best of intentions, and we stumbled, but who amongst us hasn't?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - No.<eos> Didn't you hear our chant?<eos> It was really quite clear.<eos> - It's quite long.<eos> - You know, look.<eos> - We want to be socially responsible.<eos> - We do.
If everyone would just shut up and give me two freaking seconds, I can get this suture to hold.<eos> - There. Edwards?<eos> - No leaks. Looks good.<eos> (SIGHS) The streak's alive.<eos> - What was that, Wilson? - No.<eos> Wait, nothing.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "The streak is alive." No!<eos> No, I said, "Freak." I said, "The freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.
- There. Edwards?<eos> - No leaks. Looks good.<eos> (SIGHS) The streak's alive.<eos> - What was that, Wilson? - No.<eos> Wait, nothing.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You said, "The streak is alive." No!<eos> No, I said, "Freak." I said, "The freak is alive."<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> No, she didn't.
- Anything else, Dr. Carlin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Recently she's developed a deep-seated paranoia.<eos> Paranoid?<eos> About what?<eos> She's convinced that she's being watched.<eos> It was about the break-in?<eos> Nice outfit, Soto.<eos> Liked it better when you wore it yesterday.<eos> Oh, I did? Hm.
Anyway, thanks, Pablo.<eos> Kelly, if you really hate what did this, you should come with us.<eos> Let's bring the fight to it.<eos> I mean, I guess I don't know what else I would do.<eos> Well, she shouldn't be alone right now.<eos> Plus, you're kinda like a young me.<eos> Deadites ruined your life and you're hot as hell.<eos> Okay, let's get to the book store and hit the undo button on this BS once and for all.<eos> You know they were Jewish, right?<eos> I - I did not.
That's very good, Juliette.<eos> Thanks very much.<eos> There you are.<eos> The cep risotto's good!<eos> - And with four cheeses?<eos> - Delicious!<eos> That's good, too.<eos> There's a new one: veal sausage!<eos> Same as you.<eos> I didn't...
"I cry alone."<eos> "Sitting under the moon all night."<eos> "O beloved your memories torment me."<eos> "Brings tears to my eyes."<eos> "Without you, my heart doesn't beat."<eos> "Without you the heart's restless."<eos> "The tears trickle down my chest."<eos> "I swear on you, the tears don't dry up."<eos> "You know..."<eos> "and so do I."
Thank you.<eos> Uh, black please, no sugar.<eos> Yes, uh, two coffees, black please.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> - Elleanor Delfont-Bogard.<eos> But people usually just call me Ellie.<eos> And you are?<eos> I just graduated from the Met Police Service with a degree in forensics psychology.<eos> I... hope you don't mind if I observe.<eos> And if I do?
Didn't even have an alibi!<eos> Believe me, I know how flawed the system can be.<eos> But taking matters into your hands... is no better.<eos> And at the end of the day... it won't bring back your son.<eos> Maybe not... but we all deserve justice.<eos> Any luck?<eos> Lot of anger.<eos> Not much info.<eos> Think she knows anything?<eos> I do.
Why am I the only person fighting for us?<eos> This is fighting for us.<eos> No, this is running away.<eos> We've never spent this much time apart.<eos> I mean, what... what if we can't come back from this?<eos> I mean, what if this is the beginning of the end?<eos> We promised each other... roommates in college and... and houses next door to each other.<eos> Best friends forever.<eos> Don't you want that anymore?<eos> Yeah, I do.
"To insulate covert intelligence capacities"?<eos> "To protect an informant in an active operational zone"?<eos> With respect, I don't appreciate your sarcasm, Your Honor.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, here's what I don't appreciate, counsel.<eos> I don't appreciate being instructed as to what will or will not happen in my courtroom.<eos> Your Honor, if I may.<eos> A citizen of this district has been brutally murdered.<eos> Not just a citizen but a public servant a lieutenant for the Metro P.D. And the people have a right to access and evaluate all evidence--<eos> - No, they don't.
Have the lab process the blood to look for a match to Aleko.<eos> - I'm gonna need results fast.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> See you later.<eos> Can we buy you a drink?<eos> Hey, you.<eos> This man you know that sells guns...<eos> Is he reliable?<eos> I thought you had someone.<eos> We did.
Well, that went as well as could be expected.<eos> We got a lead on Keen and an invitation to sit in the minister's box at next year's Slasher Cup.<eos> Cultural peculiarities notwithstanding I find cockfighting to be abominable.<eos> However, truth be told, I do love fried chicken.<eos> You need to tell her, Raymond.<eos> - Tell her what?<eos> - About Tom.<eos> You should have told her some time ago.<eos> - I don't know how do that, Dembe.<eos> - Yes, you do.
If I'm in trouble, it's because of you.<eos> It's because your damn partner was watching that we couldn't use the garage for the deal.<eos> - 150 cars, for God's sake!<eos> - 150 cars full of drugs.<eos> That was nothing to do with me.<eos> It was your idea.<eos> I helped you.<eos> You know, Francoeur...<eos> I don't know who Francoeur is.<eos> And nor do you.
That's just another cardboard cutout.<eos> Ah, right, when people talk, you don't see their words.<eos> Okay, dad, the first thing I want to do is go to the United Nations.<eos> Hayley, we're in New York City.<eos> There's no way I'm doing that.<eos> I want to go on a copper-mine tour.<eos> I-I don't think they have that here.<eos> Hayley, everywhere I've ever vacationed has a copper-mine tour -- New Mexico, Utah, Nebraska.<eos> You're telling me that all those places have something that the so-called<eos> "greatest city in the world" doesn't?
Oleg, the people at Table Two want to know what's in the veggie burger.<eos> No. They don't.
The famine?<eos> Ireland, 1845.<eos> The awful blight upon the potato crop?<eos> It's called An Gorta Mor.<eos> Is that, like, the name of the main guy, like Tommy?<eos> An Gorta Mor is Gaelic for "the great hunger."<eos> - You want to hear it?<eos> - Now?<eos> No, you don't want to hear it.<eos> No, no, I do.
She manages The Cortez.<eos> Hell's wrong with her?<eos> She's kind of a drunk.<eos> She'll sober up.<eos> Drunk, huh?<eos> You want to take down The Countess?<eos> So do I.<eos> And Iris here is the key.<eos> Nobody gets closer to The Countess than she does.<eos> You did.
I don't know, you call it what you want to.<eos> It was people who are recreating or are continuing the crimes committed by notorious killers from the past.<eos> March-- there was a guy.<eos> One guy called himself March, James Patrick March.<eos> You just check out the history of the hotel.<eos> That's the name of the guy who built it.<eos> And you had dinner with him.<eos> I was in a room with a guy who claimed to be him, a guy who I think is responsible for the five dead bodies on the wall in my office!<eos> You think he's The Ten Commandment Killer?<eos> I do.
Tell me more.<eos> I love a good humiliation.<eos> What did she do to you that she hasn't already done?<eos> She took me back.<eos> The Countess told me she made a mistake, and I was the one.<eos> Forever.<eos> We made love like it was the first time.<eos> But you didn't believe her.<eos> Oh, I did.<eos> I did.
What were we talking about?<eos> Honey, it happens all the time now.<eos> "Cassie, where my keys?<eos> Cassie, what day is it?"<eos> You talk to the doctor, Daddy?<eos> Huh? Your mama is the sick one.<eos> Only room for one in the family.<eos> Daddy, let me drive you over to see Dr. Sammy tomorrow.<eos> I can drive myself if I want to go.<eos> And I don't.
In the moment, it seems like it's never ending.<eos> But it always ends.<eos> Oh, no, baby.<eos> There will never be anyone like me.<eos> John... you can't tell me that this isn't what you want.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - No.<eos> Alex is not the answer.<eos> She doesn't know about you.<eos> Not the way I do.
The rest will be on my desk.<eos> Wait for it.<eos> Well, that's a pretty convenient time for a camera malfunction.<eos> Very.<eos> By the way, isn't this your day off?<eos> I stood there listening to that kid threaten your life.<eos> I'm not taking time off until he's caught.<eos> Wherever Donovan is, I'm pretty sure that he's running as far away as possible, as fast as he can.<eos> You're lucky they're allowing me to talk to you.<eos> They don't usually do that.
- Yes, she did.<eos> - Oh, that's for him.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Where's mine?<eos> I should have gotten one for you; he hates his.<eos> Oh, why?<eos> Do you hate the color?<eos> He doesn't like commitment.<eos> Do you not have Gigi's name on you?<eos> No, no, actually, he doesn't.
I like adventures as much as the next man.<eos> If the next man is a man who likes adventures.<eos> Even so, don't... don't go native.<eos> What do you mean? I'm not.<eos> Look, there's a whole...<eos> dimension in here, but there's only room for one ME.<eos> Wait... wait a second.<eos> You just raved about ghosts like a kid who had too much sherbet.<eos> Do you know what you need? You need a hobby!<eos> I really don't.
Yeah, not exactly like...<eos> But, yeah, once or twice.<eos> So you've had to deal with people who are scared.<eos> What do you say to them?<eos> I'm asking what I should say to you.<eos> That it will be all right.<eos> That the Doctor will save us.<eos> And when you say it, do you believe it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Josh, no, I don't want to talk.<eos> Yolanda, as my friend, I'm asking you to stay.<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> Yolanda, as your boss, I'm asking you to leave.<eos> - Yep.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> I pay you.<eos> Sorry, Gabi, monies before honeys.<eos> Gabi, we need to talk.<eos> Yes, we do.
We just need to make it look like it was created a couple years ago with digital imprints that even the best forensics won't be able to tell are fake.<eos> If it contains everything in Maya's head, then the Feds don't need Maya and Hector and his pals still go up the river.<eos> Can you guys really do that?<eos> Yes.<eos> No.<eos> That's fabricating evidence.<eos> The Feds want her on the stand, under oath.<eos> Um, Maya.<eos> Do you swear everything you're going to tell us will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
You gave money to this idiot?<eos> It was from my separate bank account.<eos> What separate account?<eos> Uh... I only use it to pay for my separate phone.<eos> You have a separate phone?<eos> Up, down, up, down.<eos> Up, down... up, down.<eos> Good!<eos> You feel the burning in your core?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
Mike Jambowski!<eos> I love this venue!<eos> Ven-ue! Ven-ue! Ven-ue!<eos> Venue...<eos> Venue!<eos> Hey, you want to fire a confetti gun, Homer?<eos> That's the only kind of gun I've never fired.<eos> Come on, just point and squeeze.<eos> I know that guy.<eos> Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.
Yeah, sure you do, Uncle Lenny.<eos> No, he works at the plant with me.<eos> Homer something.<eos> ♪ When we harmonize ♪<eos> ♪ And you look in our eyes ♪<eos> ♪ You'll see it's no surprise ♪<eos> ♪ That we're your Nobel Prize ♪<eos> ♪ 'Cause, girl, you know it's true ♪<eos> ♪ All four of us love you ♪<eos> ♪ Yeah, we do, yeah, we do, yeah, we do ♪

I'm down to a 17 handicap.<eos> Mm! I've known about your handicap for years.<eos> I never knew it had a number.<eos> And-and you?<eos> Oh, my mother and I are visiting a friend who's been going through a tough time.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Well, the truth is, she embezzled several million dollars, and she's in jail.<eos> You know, I've never known anyone who's been to jail.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Didn't have to.<eos> My first day, I walked up to the biggest bull in the yard and beat the crap out of her with my shoe.<eos> Really?<eos> Snickers?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nobody likes a drum solo.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.
Amen.<eos> I thought I hit bottom when I got sent to prison, but turns out, I wasn't even close.<eos> After those cold steel gates slammed shut behind me, I was so lonely and hopeless, I decided I might as well start drinking again.<eos> I felt like that at rehab when they took away my iPad.<eos> Now... for those of you who haven't been to prison, you pretty much have two choices when it comes to getting loaded:<eos> Toilet wine-- a lovely mixture of moldy bread, rotted fruit, and ketchup.<eos> Ketchup makes it a rosé.<eos> And, of course, heroin, smuggled via somebody's boyfriend's poop chute.<eos> In either case, you really gotta want it.<eos> And I did.
- Why not?<eos> I've always been curious about the... United Westside African Methodist Episcopal Holy Tabernacle Church of God.<eos> Seriously?<eos> I think a couple of them merged.<eos> I can't believe you're buying into this.<eos> What is your problem with God?<eos> I don't have a problem with God.<eos> I happen to be a very spiritual person.<eos> My problem is with an ex-con looking me in the eye and telling me I lost Alvin because God has some freakin' plan.<eos> Well... maybe he does.
I don't know what you mean.<eos> Why does she want me out of the castle?<eos> Is it because she's bedding Narcisse?<eos> She wants me away from him, doesn't she?<eos> I've got to run a quick errand.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Stay in the carriage.<eos> You.<eos> - Do you know this town?<eos> - I do, Majesty.
Daniel saved my life.<eos> I told this story to protect myself and the ones that I love, but it only festered.<eos> And tonight it stops.<eos> I know that none of this makes sense and that there are many unanswered questions, like why was even I attacked that night?<eos> There's only one explanation.<eos> There's one secret that I kept.<eos> And it has cost the ones I love more than I ever wanted.<eos> What the hell, Ems?<eos> I am David Clarke's daughter.<eos> Does David Clarke already...
I've tried to kill you and your brother. Your brother as recently as last month.<eos> You wouldn't have come to me if I wasn't your last resort.<eos> You're desperate. Ha, ha.<eos> You can stop pretending you're not.<eos> So rude.<eos> I can't read the book in its present form... but there is someone who could.<eos> Nadya.<eos> Grand Coven witch.<eos> Where do I find her?<eos> You don't.
I know it's been gnawing at you.<eos> You can't eave that job to them.<eos> You're right.<eos> Out there, you're sleeping.<eos> You make the right choice in here... you'll sleep forever.<eos> And you won't ever hurt anyone ever again.<eos> No one needs to know, Dean.<eos> What happens in purgatory stays in purgatory.<eos> How do you know this' work?<eos> I don't.
Right, less talk, more translating.<eos> Go. About that, I said I can read the book, never said would.<eos> -We had a deal.<eos> -Oh, we did. We do.<eos> And it's time you held up your end.<eos> I want my son dead.<eos> -After--<eos> Once I cast the spell, and you need me to cast that spell... who knows what'll happen?<eos> I don't have time for this!<eos> Right, you don't.
That right there could be the Whore of Babylon, wouldn't make no difference at all- because all I see is somebody's little girl.<eos> And I feel like a real jerk suggesting otherwise, sheriff.<eos> Good luck cracking the case with your eyes shut.<eos> You worked some pretty dark stuff in your day, haven't you, agent?<eos> Must have left quite a mark.<eos> Oh, you have no idea.<eos> -Your partner's a piece of work, agent.<eos> -Yeah, ain't he though?<eos> Dean-o. Welcome to the party.<eos> The hell you doing here, Rudy?
But now I think that maybe it has more to do with me being a Banshee.<eos> It's not my memory, Stiles.<eos> It's someone else's.<eos> Why haven't you said anything?<eos> About what?<eos> The rest of my memory.<eos> The Desert Wolf.<eos> Why didn't you tell Scott?<eos> I didn't think you wanted me to.<eos> I don't.
They're drug dealers?<eos> Among the most ruthless in Europe.<eos> Somewhere along the line, they realized that keeping German neighborhoods white is more than politics.<eos> It's economics.<eos> These guys are fighting a street war.<eos> Interpol estimates at least a dozen drug-related homicides in the last year alone.<eos> You're telling me that Tom Keen, the four-eyes who taught third grade, is walking into that?<eos> How do we find him?<eos> I can check, but I don't think we have any friends on the inside.<eos> I do.
Take away the good guys and the bad guys.<eos> It's a child who needs an organ and a patient with one to give.<eos> Bailey, that woman lost everything today.<eos> I know!<eos> Okay, you don't think I know that?<eos> But ethically, you have to.<eos> Ethically, I'm looking out for the best interest of my patient and his family.<eos> Hey, thanks for walking us out.<eos> You know, you didn't have to do that.<eos> With your sense of direction, I kind of did.
And Brett would have been here to help.<eos> So, Derek's back.<eos> - Is that a question?<eos> - No, it's just...<eos> And I'm glad, I am, for you and the kids, and I don't want to make this all about me.<eos> It's just he says he wants to come back and just work. For me.<eos> Still not sure what you're asking.<eos> Well, I'm asking should I believe that?<eos> Can I believe that?<eos> - I do.

I can set up your rooms for you.<eos> Make them nice.<eos> Uh, Kenna, I have something that I wanted to talk to you about.<eos> Promise me... you will resist the urge to annul our union.<eos> - Why would I?<eos> - For another.<eos> Bash, apart from you, I've only been lied to<eos> - and betrayed by men.<eos> - Who want you.<eos> They always do.
Morten is paranoid that he would put a bomb in the trailer was impossible to predict.<eos> It can still affect you.<eos> Not so much that I can't do my job.<eos> No, but something is wrong.<eos> I can see it.<eos> If you don't want to say anything, I must send you home, whether you like it or not.<eos> My mother is here.<eos> Your mother?<eos> I have never heard you talk about your mother.<eos> I don't.
But not everyone is so fortunate.<eos> And that's why we've donated money so the museum can build a completely new wing.<eos> But while we wait -<eos> - I'm sharing art from my private collection, so it can create more joy and maybe get them to continue in the world of art - and therefore life.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Ladies and gentlemen, Freddie Holst.<eos> - Jeanette, do you regret doing this?<eos> - Definitely not.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - No. Not if you don't.
- You seem to have it good.<eos> - I do.<eos> Are you Claes Sandberg?<eos> Can you come with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> No.<eos> Hi, Claes.<eos> - Do you know her?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Because it should be my child, and no one must believe otherwise.<eos> No, do you think I'm senile?<eos> So keep away from the house!<eos> And Freddie.<eos> Keep away from him, too.<eos> - Hello? - I've been trying to get you all frigging day.<eos> - I've been busy all day.<eos> - With gambling away our house again?<eos> Is it Holst who said that?<eos> So you did?
- Emil Larsson ...<eos> There's an Emil Larsson who was fired.<eos> Is it that Emil Larsson?<eos> - Who?<eos> - The museum guard.<eos> The one who tipped us off about the connection between Holst and the pictures.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does he work at Andersen TL?<eos> There is, in any case, someone with that name who does.<eos> Did.
Stand still Prospect.<eos> Hold still.<eos> This one, is coming right... down... the middle.<eos> Shit.<eos> The thing's out of gas.<eos> You want a beer?<eos> Whoa, wait!<eos> Who says we're done here?<eos> Come on Stash.<eos> I do.
- Yes.<eos> So how do you know my sister?<eos> From yoga.<eos> She told me about your new business.<eos> - Ah. - Sounds exciting.<eos> "Exhausting" is more like it.<eos> At least you can have a beer after a long day.<eos> This is true.<eos> Oh, you met Pam.<eos> Yes. I sure did.
Well, you have a very impressive solve rate, detective.<eos> So, one prisoner kills another, but you don't believe his confession?<eos> What led you to Janet Wong?<eos> Specifically.<eos> Due diligence.<eos> Janet Wong was on duty that night.<eos> She placed Derek Caster in the cell with Mason Garvey.<eos> Suddenly, she had a new car.<eos> Right, and then Wong told you that Henry Guenther paid her $50,000 to arrange the murder?<eos> She did, yes.
I have a balcony that's far enough away from other people's balconies, so nobody could jump down from the roof or whatever.<eos> And I have a parking spot next to the elevator, so I can just run right in there.<eos> And I got everything shipped out from Jersey, all my artwork, the doll I had made of you, and, of course, the pictures of me and Daddy in his red car.<eos> God, we had the best times in that thing.<eos> Anyway, call me back.<eos> Love you.<eos> Oh, God...<eos> I brought you bagels.<eos> - You should have called.<eos> - I did.
We have got to be as solid as a rock wall.<eos> Riley did it!<eos> You two get in here.<eos> Oh God, she's on to us.<eos> I need your help with Danny's surprise party.<eos> - (Both sighing) - Oh. Is that it?<eos> Okay.<eos> So, he finally found out you've been lying to him about his birthday?<eos> Ben told you, too?<eos> No. You did.
Mom, i'm so sorry.<eos> Get in the damn car.<eos> She's already out.<eos> Bet she's gonna wake up With a hell of a hangover in the morning.<eos> Can't say i feel too bad about that.<eos> You know she didn't mean it, right?<eos> She was just using her teenage superpower Of instantly knowing the most horrible thing to say.<eos> What bothers me is that she snuck out, late at night.<eos> Something terrible could've happened.<eos> But nothing did.
I really am sorry.<eos> I am so sorry. I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.<eos> Look, about that, i...<eos> I don't always drink when i go out.<eos> Sometimes when i'm at parties, I'm the girl who lost her brother.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I guess you would.<eos> How do you forget about it?<eos> I don't.
Tyler. But before this, i worked in a car wash.<eos> My manager had one of those wire-key-chain things, too.<eos> Guess who was the last person to see laurel ayers alive.<eos> Her manager at the taco place?<eos> I asked the guys in homicide If i could take a look at her case file.<eos> Turns out when laurel disappeared, The manager was questioned and cleared.<eos> Okay. You know, but young girls run away all the time.<eos> Problems at home, they take off.<eos> You know what i mean?<eos> Yeah, i do.
So I'm supposed to what go in there and pretend I didn't just call her a classless hussy and mean it?<eos> You want to do my job?<eos> Every day, you have to decide between something terrible that you hate and something horrible that you hate.<eos> Either way, people are gonna hate you.<eos> You need to accept that. Otherwise, you shouldn't run.<eos> No one's ever hated you.<eos> Even when they disagree with you, they love Fitzgerald Grant.<eos> That face, that voice.<eos> You got that thing that makes people love you.<eos> And I don't.
When her guard is up, he waits.<eos> He waits... and he waits... Until she starts to believe he's gone.<eos> And she relaxes.<eos> And then he sends us in.<eos> But she has to know.<eos> That's how he lets her know Papa Pope is in charge.<eos> That's how he lets her know that...<eos> You can't take command, son. Yes.<eos> She never had a chance, did she?<eos> No, she didn't.
According to the uniform code of military justice, that could mean any number of things... making a rude remark, using foul language...<eos> Sneezing at the wrong time.<eos> There has to be some way we can get Amy out of there.<eos> What about emergency medical leave?<eos> Sure, if Amy had a dead relative whose funeral she had to attend, for example.<eos> What about a sick relative?<eos> One she had to leave the ship to visit?<eos> That works, too, but Amy doesn't have a sick relative.<eos> Actually, she does.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Nolan Ross.<eos> Friend of your father's.<eos> It only took 10 years to return the favor.<eos> I was kind of hoping you'd have to repay this one never.<eos> Two years ago, I never would've thought I'd have... A partner in all this, or a real friend.<eos> Now that's a revenge all-star opportunity.<eos> What do you have on tap?<eos> A long summer of fun.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I do...
- See you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Bye.<eos> That kid's a nightmare!<eos> - He wailed for 3 hours.<eos> - The horror.<eos> It's why I don't want kids.<eos> - Really?<eos> You don't?
Don't!<eos> I lost hope, but everything's working out.<eos> Tom at daycare, the play...<eos> And with Christophe.<eos> I'm exhausted.<eos> - The shots don't work.<eos> - It'll work.<eos> What will?<eos> Stop saying it'll work.<eos> It doesn't!
Not in this house.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I-I usually read when I eat.<eos> I noticed.<eos> Why is that?<eos> I never know where to look.<eos> Look down, you're being rude.<eos> Too much eye contact, and people think you're weird.<eos> Facts, numbers, patterns, they make sense to me.<eos> People... people don't.
Are you [bleep] kidding me?<eos> What?<eos> I thought what we had was simple.<eos> Maybe for you, because you weren't in it.<eos> I for one found the whole thing very dramatic and stressful.<eos> I didn't realize you felt that way.<eos> Because you never really listened to anything I said.<eos> And you took my V-card, and then you could hardly look at me.<eos> - Come on, I liked you.<eos> - No, you didn't.
And, I mean, of course I told you this, but...<eos> He showed me a letter from Bob to Susan that was from March before she was murdered.<eos> The address written on the front is exactly like the "cadaver" note, down to the misspelling of "Beverly."<eos> So, I'm not trying to make you feel... No.<eos> Like I said, and this is kind of why...<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> No, I got you. Got you.<eos> You know, I'm, I, it was clear enough that I might be dancing with the devil.<eos> Do you think you have an answer now?<eos> I do.
At least you've got a dog.<eos> That's one up on me.<eos> I don't know who I am.<eos> I don't know if this is my birthday.<eos> I don't even know my own name.<eos> No, I know who I am.<eos> I am the puppet of some high-functioning sociopath.<eos> I don't even know what I'm doing here.<eos> What you're doing here is celebrating your birthday with me.<eos> - What did you...?
Kill me if you will.<eos> I told you once before when you held a knife to my throat, I am ready for hell.<eos> But let me say two words before you do...<eos> Mary Sibley. What about her?<eos> I saw her yesterday.<eos> I saw her as I've never seen her before, as a woman in love... with you.<eos> You'd never know she suffers the torments of hell believing that you had died without knowing.<eos> Knowing?<eos> That she has always loved you.<eos> And she still does.
What... wait, really?<eos> I feel some scar tissue.<eos> - You may have plantar fasciitis.<eos> - Oh dear!<eos> Oh, it's nothing serious, but any pressure to your foot can cause a flare up.<eos> Just to play it safe, I think you should sit this one out.<eos> Well, if you insist!<eos> Uh, I do.<eos> As long as you know that I could've finished the race had I run.<eos> - Oh, I do.
You're going to the dance with Cassie?<eos> Yes!<eos> She's helping me save face with Mark and Annie.<eos> She's a good friend.<eos> What?<eos> Just for you,<eos> I think there's a little truth in this big lie.<eos> Where'd you find her?<eos> - We didn't.<eos> Mr. Beamish did.
Jinxed!<eos> Do you have something to, you know, de-jinx me?<eos> I don't believe in jinxes, Martha.<eos> Well, then what do you suggest I do?<eos> Move the ball.<eos> Move the ba...<eos> My.<eos> But...<eos> But the leak!<eos> How did you...
She cheated on me.<eos> I don't want to talk about it, really.<eos> It's just that...<eos> I only want to apologize.<eos> For being right again?<eos> Bottom line is, people don't change.<eos> But sometimes, they do surprise you.<eos> Nick!<eos> You came.<eos> Yeah, I did.
We have a date.<eos> Looking forward to it.<eos> It was a pleasure talking to you.<eos> Oh, you too.<eos> So, I heard you're selling Keating house to a developer.<eos> Martha.<eos> In her defense, I think she just wanted to get me on board with the sale, since she knew it would be unpopular with the town council.<eos> So, do you really think that tearing down Keating house is the best option for our town?<eos> - I don't have the choice.<eos> Sure you do.
Are you all right?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Here, let me take a look.<eos> No, go.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to make you late for your date.<eos> My X-ray is down, but to be safe I need to get a better look.<eos> You did say you fractured that ankle once before, so this joint is at least susceptible.<eos> If you insist.<eos> - I do.
Well, that's impressive.<eos> But it's not control.<eos> I'm a doctor.<eos> If I didn't believe that I could control the uncontrollable, I never would have gotten out of med school.<eos> - I believe at its core, medicine is a struggle to control disease.<eos> - Yes, see, control.<eos> No, see, struggle.<eos> I think I'm gonna control myself on home.<eos> And now I seem to be struggling a bit.<eos> Hmm... we all do.
And for some reason that's all I could talk about.<eos> Your ex?<eos> - Tough marriage, tougher break-up.<eos> I guess in the end we just wanted different things.<eos> She never really wanted kids.<eos> Me, I wanted a whole baseball team.<eos> It's funny how you can think you know someone when you don't, really.<eos> How about you and Jake?<eos> I loved him until the day he died.<eos> I still do.
- Just spend some time with Nick and leave me alone, ok?<eos> - You are no fun.<eos> - Goodnight, Linda.<eos> Goodnight, Sam.<eos> - (Mashing) - (Door opening)<eos> - (Knocking)<eos> - Hello there, Doctor.<eos> Please, call me Sam.<eos> - If you insist.<eos> - I do.
It's hard to believe Ryan's involved.<eos> - Yeah, Jones is the buyer... you didn't know?<eos> - Ryan's Jones?<eos> - (Sighing)<eos> Yeah. One and the same.<eos> - He didn't tell you?<eos> - No, he didn't.<eos> Oh...<eos> I'm sorry, Cassie, but you should know.<eos> Yeah, now I do.
Ok, so I'm a little off my game, alright?<eos> Only if you're trying to get the ball in the hoop.<eos> I hate this.<eos> Basketball?<eos> My parents.<eos> I'm stuck between them and they really hate each other.<eos> Dad wants me to stay here, and Mom wants me to go with her.<eos> Well, what do you want?<eos> I want to go to Hong Kong and back to New York.<eos> No, you don't.

Yes, but will it make you happy?<eos> I think for the sake of Nick, we can get along for a weekend here or there.<eos> - I'm relocating to Middleton.<eos> - Ha! Ha! Ha!<eos> Linda?<eos> When I get back from China, I'm gonna look for a house here in Middleton.<eos> I've already spoken with a real estate agent, Sam.<eos> - You can't be serious?<eos> - You asked me to do this.<eos> - No, I didn't!
- Just spend some time with Nick and leave me alone, ok?<eos> You are no fun.<eos> - Goodnight, Linda.<eos> Goodnight, Sam.<eos> (Mashing) - (Door opening)<eos> (Knocking)<eos> - Hello there, Doctor.<eos> Please, call me Sam.<eos> If you insist.<eos> - I do.

That's great.<eos> Had a feeling you were a dad.<eos> You know, not many guys go from SMU to the league, especially after the death penalty.<eos> That's pretty goddamn impressive, man.<eos> I told you I don't want to fucking talk about it.<eos> Well, I do want to talk about it.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - I do care.<eos> - I don't suck dicks.<eos> - I do... not...
Through entire blockade, my grandfather kept it cocked and loaded by the front door, so, if the Germans ever break through, if they come to the house for my aunts and my grandmother, he has something to shoot the enemy with.<eos> And if necessary... his family, and then himself.<eos> May I ask, sir, why you're telling me all this?<eos> Our people are never frightened, Professor, and we outlast our enemy.<eos> So, tell your wife and your president, we don't back down.<eos> I will convey your message, Mr. President.<eos> But to be honest, I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> They will.<eos> He did what?
Soon as Dad gets back.<eos> Oh...<eos> Yeah, I don't, I don't know if I'm up for that.<eos> Well, get up for it.<eos> We're celebrating. Why?<eos> Because we can.<eos> Because we're here.<eos> Dad's home!<eos> Come on, get your coats! We found a place with awesome vegan options.<eos> I did.
Yes, but I already spoke to Commander Garnett.<eos> Yeah. She sent it up to me to sign off.<eos> Protocol.<eos> So, the captain is aware of this?<eos> He ordered it.<eos> Well, then, I'd like to talk to him.<eos> Captain's not permitted to talk to material witnesses during an ongoing investigation.<eos> Also protocol.<eos> Listen, Mike, I hear everything that you are saying.<eos> I really do.
And every minute that I'm not working is a minute...<eos> I hear you, too, Dr. Scott.<eos> Nevertheless, I have to do this.<eos> The more you argue, the longer it will take, so...<eos> Tell me again, when did you first notice Niels take a turn for the worse?<eos> Sir, we fished an I.V. bag out of the trash.<eos> The tube still had the blood on it from when Niels ripped it out of his arm.<eos> And?<eos> Every bag prepared in the medical bay should have the patient's name, medication, and Doc Rios' signature.<eos> This one didn't.
Hey, Nika. It's me.<eos> Just call me and let me know that you're okay.<eos> Love you.<eos> S03E09 Best Enemies<eos> Detective Angie Flynn.<eos> I hear you're pretty shaken up, Mr. Sharpe.<eos> Julian Stancroft.<eos> I've advised my client that I'll respond to all questions on his behalf.<eos> - You want that?<eos> - He does.
I assisted her, yes.<eos> And this investigation happened after an inmate named Mason Garvey confessed to killing Caster?<eos> Also correct.<eos> So why did Detective Flynn investigate a closed case?<eos> I think that's something you should ask her, don't you think?<eos> Have you ever had reason to suspect a personal agenda drives her work?<eos> I don't think she's the one with the agenda here.<eos> If you're found to have lied during an internal investigation, you can be discharged under the police services act.<eos> Do you understand that, detective?<eos> I do.
- right?<eos> - I know.<eos> But... do you think<eos> - if I got really bad...<eos> - Baby.<eos> - ... that he would come?<eos> - Clementine.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I really don't.
I don't want to know what Ric's doing, do I?<eos> Probably at the movies.<eos> Yeah, or--or mini golf.<eos> I need ketchup.<eos> So are we gonna talk about it?<eos> - What?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> You're gonna make your best friend have to pry it out of you.<eos> I know about the cure, Elena.<eos> You do?
He needed someone to talk to after you left the conversation without telling him what you were thinking.<eos> That's not exactly how it happened.<eos> And I quote-- "She stared at me like I was an alien and then basically teleported out of the room."<eos> Damon Salvatore stands in front of you and tells you that he wants to become a human again.<eos> Wouldn't you freak out?<eos> I just--I needed some time to process.<eos> I mean, 24 hours ago, I didn't even think it was possible to become a human again.<eos> But you want to be a human again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, I did.
Oh, come on.<eos> Yeah, to keep the freaks with glazed eyes away and to kill her if she ever becomes one of them herself.<eos> I'm not gonna let that happen.<eos> Screw you for ruining a perfect day.<eos> I love you.<eos> What did you just say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You just said that you love me.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, you did.
She's outside the dome and was born with severe brain damage from your drinking.<eos> She'll never talk, never read.<eos> Why did you lie to the group?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just can't imagine her the way that she is.<eos> What I did to her.<eos> So I just imagine something else, you know?<eos> She's out there with new parents, and they're helping her and loving her, and... the doctors are fixing her brain.<eos> 'Cause I can't live if I don't think that she has a chance, so...<eos> But she doesn't.
So who else you got?<eos> Barbie?<eos> Problem there is Julia.<eos> She's probably telling him everything she knows about you, which is a lot.<eos> So, you see, your plan has no margin for error.<eos> And that's a big chance to take when the fallout is your brain in a jar.<eos> I still have a human being's body, Jim.<eos> And it's tired.<eos> This is so messed up.<eos> We didn't even do anything wrong.
I never knew what it felt like to be safe or in love until I met Barbie.<eos> And look how that worked out.<eos> Such a cliché, right?<eos> Falling for the dark, mysterious guy and... then get all bent out of shape when he turns out to be dark and mysterious.<eos> Look at us...<eos> two former enemies drinking at the end of the world.<eos> "Former"?<eos> Oh, come on, Jim.<eos> You must have regrets.<eos> Yeah, course I do.
He's one of us.<eos> Just recently converted.<eos> There's a way to save the town.<eos> How?<eos> Emotion.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Are you ready to face judgment?<eos> You're all sure you want to do this?<eos> Like you even need to ask, Red.<eos> Hell yeah, I do.
Sorry, I got to find her.<eos> Barbie, they are gonna have her hidden, under heavy guard.<eos> - This is their new queen.<eos> - That's ridiculous!<eos> She's a baby!<eos> She's nobody's queen.<eos> She was conceived and born in three days.<eos> - She is my daughter.<eos> Look, I know how you feel...<eos> No, you don't.
Joe is innocent.<eos> Everyone under this dome is innocent.<eos> Believe me, what I have to do, it... it breaks my heart.<eos> That couldn't have been my daughter.<eos> She's less than a day old.<eos> What'd you do to her?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> I think you're lying.<eos> If you really were human, you'd remember everything you did while you were infected.<eos> I do.
She didn't show any of the usual signs.<eos> Oh, Louise.<eos> It's normal to look for answers at a time like this.<eos> But we read her note.<eos> She was resolute in her decision.<eos> Was she, though?<eos> I mean, I saw the date book on her desk, and she scheduled a mani/pedi for next week.<eos> Now, why would someone with a death wish worry about their cuticles?<eos> Just doesn't make any sense.<eos> Death rarely does.
See you never, Amanda.<eos> Hello, Amanda.<eos> I'm sending you this message to tell you that I'm ending your game of revenge.<eos> By the time you receive this,<eos> I'll no longer be among the living.<eos> But I would be remiss if I didn't thank you for that brilliant idea I found on that flash drive of yours.<eos> Just as you were planning on making it appear as if I had murdered you on your farcical wedding night, I'm going to make it appear as if you murdered me in your own home.<eos> The only difference...<eos> You never actually had the guts to kill yourself.<eos> But I do.
Maybe I didn't exactly die back there, but I... I sure as hell could have.<eos> I did look up from my car today.<eos> I did see a plane coming toward me.<eos> And for a split second, I did find myself thinking,<eos> "maybe this is it.<eos> This is where it all ends on 37th street between a yarn shop and a falafel stand."<eos> I know what a near-death experience is, and this wasn't my first.<eos> And it's true.<eos> Your life flashes right before your eyes.<eos> And this morning, mine did.
- I know. I thought that if she saw...<eos> - No, I disagree.<eos> These are not the actions of someone who thinks.<eos> - This is someone...<eos> - Oh, my god.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know I'm supposed to keep it down, but...<eos> We had sandwiches.<eos> Wait... you did?<eos> We did.

Shots fired, New York.<eos> I cannot stop playing this one.<eos> You already know this...<eos> Lucious Lyon joint.

I heard Big Heavy and his boys came and paid us a visit?<eos> I can't have them boys coming around here, making my girls nervous.<eos> I feel you, all right?<eos> But I took care of it.<eos> They're not gonna come back again.<eos> Good.<eos> Look, man, I know I've been hard on you.<eos> My label is my life.<eos> My mom, she deserves the best.<eos> She does.
Why didn't you rat me out?<eos> Ah...<eos> I guess I liked you.<eos> Come on, man, that doesn't make any sense.<eos> You knew.<eos> You know, in this whole damn chapter, only kid was ever a real soul brother.<eos> Hey Charlie, you remember that ride? Hm?<eos> Out in the desert?<eos> You, me, the kid?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
You'll slip up.<eos> And when you do, you're going to jail.<eos> So you'd better file a few things away in your wank bank, Jasper.<eos> Who is that?<eos> Andy Sinclair.<eos> The Olympic swimmer.<eos> Andy Sinclair won four gold medals in the last Olympics including one of the greatest come-from-behind finishes in sports history.<eos> The guy inspired a Nation.<eos> Does he inspire you?<eos> Well, yes, as a matter of fact, he does.
- How many dining? - One.<eos> Of course.<eos> I can get you for one at Borchardt.<eos> It's a classic.<eos> You don't want to eat there.<eos> Uh, checking out... 708.<eos> The chef's secret weapon is truffle oil.<eos> He bathes everything in it.<eos> - What if I love truffle oil?<eos> - You don't.
And Sam is going to believe that a senior FBI agent is a mole, with no evidence, based solely on the word of a man he knows for certain has broken the law?<eos> What makes you think he'll even hear you out?<eos> I need to talk to you, Sam.<eos> Okay.<eos> What are we talking about?<eos> I didn't kill Michelle.<eos> I've done some bad things but for the right reasons.<eos> Please, you have to believe me.<eos> I do.<eos> Y-you do?
(Oskar) I release the switch, and the car explodes, Taking us all with it, And any other unfortunate soul<eos> Who happens to be within a five-block radius. Dr. Glover, are we... Quite finished?<eos> Please, help me with my jacket.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It's up to you.<eos> (Oskar) I walk out of that door alone... Or nobody does.<eos> You killed the woman carrying your own child, The woman you loved.<eos> Then you know what I am willing to do.<eos> How do you sleep at night?<eos> I don't.
She's back in town.<eos> I hate lying.<eos> You would hate it more if we missed this 4for1 concert.<eos> True.<eos> And Bobby is hot, so you know he has cute friends.<eos> He'd better.<eos> He does.<eos> Now text her back before she starts worrying.<eos> She's totally gonna know I'm lying.<eos> She always does.
I recognized him when I saw the news.<eos> He came to see me after what happened to Patrick.<eos> And he questioned you?<eos> I didn't know he was a driver for the company.<eos> He said he was a reporter.<eos> He was both.<eos> We believe he started driving because he was digging into Zooss.<eos> What did he want to know?<eos> Mostly about Patrick's job, like if I knew about any problems Patrick had at work.<eos> I didn't.
I'm not really into being this high up.<eos> Okay, uhm...<eos> Winn...<eos> I'm going to tell you something about me that only three people in my life know.<eos> Can I trust you?<eos> - Yeah, yeah, of course.<eos> - Good.<eos> I just... really want someone to be excited for me.<eos> And I, uhm...<eos> Right, how do...
- Shit!<eos> No wonder you look stressed.<eos> She'll have made plans.<eos> Do you know anything about them?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> We're not besties.<eos> It's not like she shares.<eos> Well, you'll just have to make sure she does, hmm?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We still do.
Talk.<eos> Everyone was going to look the other way, except that kid, Cruz.<eos> He found out, went to his boss.<eos> We tried to keep him quiet, but he refused.<eos> He was too idealistic.<eos> So you were a part of a conspiracy, and when Cruz tried to go against you, he was murdered...<eos> Thrown off a bridge to keep him from blowing the whistle.<eos> That's when you framed him, which is why she framed you.<eos> When I knew her, she was nobody, a ranch hand.<eos> How did she...
Yo, A-Train, I couldn't find any Kashi GoLeans, so I made you a bagel.<eos> Yeah, my name is Alice, and this is not what I wanted.<eos> I wanted Kashi GoLean.<eos> Well, that was a fun stroll down memory lane, guys.<eos> - It really was.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> But I'm sorry.<eos> You're still fired.<eos> Do you remember when you had sex with Ders on this desk?<eos> I do.
All right, let's get on that diagnostic right now.<eos> Okay, look, you said a couple of hours, and now it's been all night.<eos> We have get out of here...<eos> - Before classes start. - I'm nearly there.<eos> Bill, wake up.<eos> Yep, yep.<eos> I'm awake. I'm awake. Ahem.<eos> Did you get the encryption?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> Yes, I did.
Subpoena for what?<eos> To appear before a senate investigation committee looking into this administration's involvement in the attempt to overthrow the government in Iran.<eos> Hm. Well, you don't often see a senator hand-delivering a subpoena.<eos> Nice personal touch.<eos> You can be as dismissive as you like now...<eos> Can I take a wild stab at who's chairing this committee?<eos> ...but you will stand before that committee<eos> - and you will tell the truth.<eos> - Not a problem.<eos> Do it all the time.
Thanks to their long lenses and meticulous note-taking, we may have a person of interest... a man by the name of Collin Eisely.<eos> I'm sorry, I need to catch up a little, here.<eos> Have I been under police surveillance?<eos> No, those were taken by someone who was interested in that man,<eos> We have hundreds of photographs of him, in all manner of activities,<eos> Those, however, are the only ones where he appears to be in heated altercation with a man two days before he was murdered.<eos> This guy was murdered?<eos> Last night.<eos> Do you want to tell us how you knew him?<eos> I didn't.
It's a plane ticket Arn purchased under a false name.<eos> Turns out he flew to Prague three weeks ago.<eos> I'm guessing he wasn't sight-seeing.<eos> I figured, where's the best place to meet criminals?<eos> Prison, right?<eos> So, I checked Arn's records to see if he did any time with Czech inmates.<eos> David and Aleksandr Brosnek.<eos> Cocaine traffickers operating from Prague.<eos> Cocaine traffickers?<eos> Anything to do with narcoterrorism?
Must be a very smart boy.<eos> - Well, he's a good student.<eos> - Oh.<eos> He almost had us fooled.<eos> Just like you were saying in class, all it takes is one mistake.<eos> - Hamartia.<eos> - Yeah. Yeah.<eos> The gun used to shoot Arn and Chloe was a SIG Sauer, but, Arn's accomplices have confirmed that they gave Arn a Czech pistol, so where is Arn original gun?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - I didn't either.
He won't like it<eos> After all, he's my younger brother.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> I'll apologies a lot to him.<eos> Fine.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But you don't be scared.<eos> If there's any problem, just call me.<eos> You have my number, don't you?<eos> - You do, don't you?
Shakti, please don't...<eos> Did I starve him?<eos> So what was the reason...<eos> Brother, this girl...<eos> This girl is the reason, brother.<eos> Brother, in this era you can ask any youth like me and he'll tell you that finding love has become so expensive and hard.<eos> I mean...if we go watch a film in the multiplex, that's 800 rupees.<eos> And if you eat a combo of popcorn and fritters then it's 900 rupees.<eos> And after that if your baby says "Baby, coffee" then treating her to coffee costs almost 1000 rupees.<eos> And all night on your prepaid card, we do...
Looking for some fun?<eos> That works.<eos> You're late!<eos> But before we go anywhere, I need to know you can protect me.<eos> And my family.<eos> You're safe now.<eos> I'll make sure your family is, too.<eos> You don't know these people!<eos> You don't know what they can do!<eos> Oh, yeah, we do.
Come on, let's move! Come on, everybody out!<eos> Let's go, let's go!<eos> Move it!<eos> Everybody out! Time's up!<eos> Let's go!<eos> Thomas Dewey organizes a citywide raid to find Lucky Luciano.<eos> He's not in here.<eos> Luciano escapes, but for Dewey, the raid isn't a total loss, as he brings in a prostitute who works in one of Luciano's brothels.<eos> So, how do you know Lucky Luciano?<eos> I don't.
He explained everything.<eos> And I will keep my end of the bargain.<eos> You can take this to the meeting with McCauley.<eos> Oh, for fuck's sake.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I waited 45 minutes just to see if you'd show up.<eos> Sorry, Crys.<eos> I really tried to make it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Tell the truth, Shelly.<eos> Or you too will end up a spot on the wall.<eos> SHAW [ON RECORDING]:<eos> Root, are you there?<eos> It's me, I need your help.<eos> [PHONE CLICKS]<eos> She's alive, Harold.<eos> We wrote her off for dead, but she's alive.<eos> - We don't know that, Miss Groves.<eos> - Except we do.
Two hours... three times a week... to shop and run errands.<eos> How bloody stupid do you think I am?<eos> I know it sounds like a long time, but...<eos> rationing slows everything down.<eos> The queues take longer.<eos> - Oh, I see.<eos> So that means more time chatting with friends.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You know what women are like.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because you'd have caused a huge commotion.<eos> We'd have both been sacked, drummed out of the profession for good.<eos> So you left a note and ran?<eos> - I had so little time to decide.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.

Babe, I miss you too. Relax, all right?<eos> We'll be careful.<eos> It's not our first time hunting together.<eos> I already told you, wild boar.<eos> Yeah, that's what they hunt here in Hawaii.<eos> They're all over the place.<eos> Yeah, the little piggies with the tusks, with the tusks.<eos> Look, you're probably married, right?<eos> - So you know how it is.<eos> - No, I don't.
Okay, we need to isolate her before she carries out<eos> - whatever her plan is.<eos> - How?<eos> Go to your seat.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> Something very stupid.<eos> She has a gun.<eos> Which is why I want you as far away as possible.<eos> You know I feel the same way about you, right?<eos> I do, I do.
I know you've suffered.<eos> Your children dying...<eos> They would have died anyway.<eos> Human life is fleeting.<eos> People are mayflies, breeding and dying, repeating the same mistakes.<eos> It's boring.<eos> And I'm stuck here.<eos> Abandoned by the one man who should know what eternity feels like.<eos> Who should understand.<eos> I do, now, but...
You shall.<eos> In death.<eos> No!<eos> Doctor, what have I done?<eos> What have I done to these people?<eos> Stop this!<eos> They are defenceless.<eos> - He doesn't care.<eos> - But I do.<eos> Oh, God, I do.
I won't be doing that.<eos> Oh, no. No, I don't mean for public consumption.<eos> A journal, just for yourself...<eos> I just said, I don't wanna do that.<eos> 'I don't wanna own it, I don't wanna memorialize it.'<eos> I don't wanna think about it being in a diary somewhere in my room.<eos> I want a nice, big wall between before and after.<eos> ♪ Make you feel better make you feel safe ♪<eos> I thought you liked this wallpaper.<eos> I did.
Tell Faisel who kidnapped his wife before your wives have no husband.<eos> I can't tell you what I don't know.<eos> Maybe Faisel can help you remember.<eos> He killed one of my fighters, and he took my wife.<eos> Tell me where this man is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.
We have, uh, witnesses who say he's your cousin.<eos> He's a stranger, someone we let into our home.<eos> So you must know where he went.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Lebanon.<eos> He's going to Lebanon.<eos> Kasim.<eos> Tell me why I shouldn't tell them.<eos> I owe Khalil nothing.<eos> None of us do.
You want to follow me around, huh? !<eos> You want to stand outside my fucking house? !<eos> You want to say something to me, you little pussy?<eos> Talk!<eos> Fucking talk!<eos> _<eos> _<eos> You don't have to do that. You don't have to...<eos> Get the fuck off me!<eos> Hey, I didn't do...
We can strip it away, but once it's gone, we have nothing to put back in its place.<eos> Well, let's give them something.<eos> Therapists have a lot of rules.<eos> Only one really matters:<eos> don't talk about yourself.<eos> I spent the first weeks after the Departure just waiting.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> We all are.<eos> I had a patient who said she could feel that something terrible was gonna happen.<eos> And it did.
Wait!<eos> She here?<eos> I'm glad you're finally taking action, Kevin, but let's think about this for a second.<eos> This is a big step for us. And we don't really know him.<eos> If I'm understanding right, his primary qualification is that he's a pedophile.<eos> Shut the fuck up, Patti.<eos> Do you want me to do this?<eos> - What?<eos> - Do you want me to do this?<eos> Or don't you?
You don't know how to swim.<eos> Hey, take it easy.<eos> Mind your fucking business.<eos> Why are you wet?<eos> There was a girl in the pool.<eos> - She was drowning, so...<eos> - Did you drink any?<eos> - What?<eos> - The water, did you drink any?<eos> - No. - And don't.
Knock, knock.<eos> Who's there?<eos> Broken pencil.<eos> Broken pencil who?<eos> Never mind.<eos> It's pointless.<eos> I'm Evie.<eos> Meg.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't find whatever you were looking for here.<eos> No one ever does.
We make mistakes, same as anyone, sure, but when we do, we confess.<eos> No secrets.<eos> No sins.<eos> As the leader of the town, it's my job to take the confessions of each and every person.<eos> Harper was reluctant to reveal her secrets.<eos> I was pressuring her, and she ran away.<eos> And now that she's returned?<eos> That means she's ready to confess, and we can all move on.<eos> The real question is, how do you know Harper?<eos> - I don't.
I hated it.<eos> My father loved every minute of it.<eos> He used to try so hard to catch those fish, but he never caught anything, and then one time, I just completely refused to put my line in the water.<eos> I just kind of dangled it off the side of the boat, and all of a sudden, this gigantic fish jumped out of the water and right onto my hook.<eos> My dad was so pissed at me.<eos> Hey, I thought this was a happy memory.<eos> It is for me.<eos> Hey, John Updike.<eos> I love him.<eos> Oh, yeah, so did my dad.
Sorry, you remember Anna, right?<eos> Girlfriend.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm sorry to intrude. I just...<eos> You didn't return my calls, and I knew you hung out here, so...<eos> Wait, she called you?<eos> - It... - Just to offer my condolences.<eos> It's just so tragic and unexpected.<eos> Just, you know, it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Well, suicide rarely does.
Okay, I'll get to that, but first we need some ground rules.<eos> No reporters, especially that Ruby woman.<eos> She... she... she could be helpful.<eos> Trust me.She isn't.<eos> Okay, no reporters.<eos> Go on.<eos> Well, like I said, Tenant works for GBR, and GBR provides infrastructure for the military.<eos> You know, laundry, recreational equipment, basketball courts.<eos> So... ?<eos> They do business in Mali.
They've manufactured evidence to make them think that I'm dead!<eos> Why would they...<eos> Because I saw something that I wasn't supposed to see.<eos> I need to talk to Glen.<eos> No, I've...<eos> I've got orders.<eos> Rich, my husband and my daughter think that I'm dead, that I'm never coming home!<eos> You don't think I deserve to know why?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you do.
We don't share philosophies on the possessed.<eos> How well do you know Gabriel?<eos> Ooh, better than you, I'd wager.<eos> I managed to keep him out of Vega for 25 years, as have you.<eos> But now, thanks to Alex, he's coming here.<eos> We have to prepare for battle.<eos> I have defenses in place.<eos> You don't win wars with defense.<eos> No.<eos> You do it with a trap.
- Oh, it's worse.<eos> How do you have one of the Amphorae?<eos> Where did Rhais get it?<eos> You move again, and I'll open it!<eos> You're an eight-ball.<eos> No.<eos> He's a dyad.<eos> Half human, half higher angel fused together, living in a single body.<eos> I never thought they existed.<eos> Well, they do.
You need to give him the note.<eos> A great thing happened when I lost the election.<eos> I gave up.<eos> Anger, jealousy... what people thought...<eos> I just threw them overboard.<eos> It's nice not to care.<eos> It made me miss just sitting in a bar... drinking... with you.<eos> One more?<eos> Alicia, I, uh...<eos> I don't really...
- I didn't actually see them bring him in.<eos> - 10-26. Ten-twenty... what is a 10-26, Officer?<eos> Chicago police code for detained arrestee.<eos> And Jacob Rickter was that detained arrestee.<eos> Objection. Counselor is putting words in the witness' mouth.<eos> From their own words, Your Honor.<eos> Because they believe that our client was already under arrest, and therefore he should have been Mirandized and offered the services of a lawyer.<eos> This was a slip on the radio, Your Honor, that's all.<eos> Officer Tannerman, did you clearly hear Mr. Rickter referred to by the 10-26 designation?<eos> Yes, I did.
Chris, get away from the window.<eos> - Can't make anything out. - You don't wanna see anything out there.<eos> Okay?<eos> Just, come on, step away.<eos> Sit down.<eos> Read something.<eos> What do you know?<eos> What have you seen?<eos> I've seen what people do.<eos> What they don't do.
Do you want your boy back?<eos> So which is it? You don't want him hurt or you don't want to know?<eos> You took three of my people, sir.<eos> I quarantine at-risk elements of the local populace.<eos> At risk for what?<eos> How long are you planning on keeping them?<eos> Well, you got to take that up with lady doctor Exner. It's her show.<eos> - Fine.<eos> How do I talk to her?<eos> - You don't.
And so do I.<eos> Wait, wait!<eos> No food or drink shall be consumed until its safety can be confirmed.<eos> Take it back.<eos> You believe Her Highness is poisoned?<eos> I believe many things.<eos> I believe this palace is a symbol of our king, of his power, of his country, and our enemies have stopped at nothing to destroy it.<eos> Since the first stone was laid in this expansion, His Majesty knew this day would come.<eos> So, do I believe that our enemies would dare to poison King Charles of England's sister?<eos> Yes, I do.
As was my duty.<eos> What contact did you have with her, in particular?<eos> I served her tea.<eos> - What kind?<eos> Chicory.<eos> It gave her great comfort.<eos> Though I was never the one to prepare it.<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Do you know who did?<eos> Yes, I do.
So did all the other listeners.<eos> I had to throw myself on the mercy of... our benevolent employers.<eos> I had to identify her.<eos> I told them she was a kid.<eos> I told them she was my kid.<eos> I mean, hell, I worked for them for 16 years.<eos> It's got to be worth something.<eos> 16 years?<eos> Did you know she had a film?<eos> She did.
If you have a chance to save your child, even a small one, you take it.<eos> So, this is about something more than that.<eos> Isn't it?<eos> Well, we just feel that...<eos> Maybe she wasn't meant to come back to us.<eos> Maybe God wanted us to know that she was gonna be okay in the other place.<eos> And now that we know that...<eos> We have to let her go.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't know that.<eos> No one does.
I'll wrestle you for him.<eos> I mean, our honeymoon, you... you kicked my ass.<eos> Yes, 'cause you don't wrestle to win.<eos> It's about Sophie.<eos> I think she might have been stoned the other night.<eos> Is that all you're gonna say is "oh"?<eos> Well, she's a teenager, Cat.<eos> I mean, it's not great, but it's pretty normal.<eos> I caught Will a couple of times, you know?<eos> No, I didn't.
It was sweet of them to let me bring Henry.<eos> Though why couldn't he stay behind with a tray on his lap?<eos> Don't be unkind.<eos> I never see him.<eos> He's only up here now to look at some horrid racing car.<eos> - Does he get on with Philip?<eos> - They were friends as boys.<eos> I'm afraid she doesn't like my daughter-in-law.<eos> - Oh, dear.<eos> - Who does?
Here, let me help you with that dressing.<eos> No, no, don't touch it. Don't touch it.<eos> - Oh, stop.<eos> - Don't touch it.<eos> Don't start with me.<eos> Oh, hey, Mom.<eos> Hi, Soph.<eos> Hey, great news.<eos> Looks like we found your ghost.<eos> Well, actually, my team did, with the help of a very famous psychic.
It's not actually... The whole story with me and Turing.<eos> [Sighs] Do you want to tell me the whole story, or should I just stand here and go crazy?<eos> Turing asked me to investigate life after death.<eos> I'm looking for scientific proof of what happens when we die.<eos> Really?<eos> And in exchange, he's donating money to medics international.<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> But it's a lot of money, and there are a lot of people...<eos> I don't think it's crazy, I think it's pretty brilliant.<eos> You do?
He's been acting strange lately.<eos> Strange?<eos> In... in what way?<eos> I think he's hiding something.<eos> What's going on, Janel?<eos> There's nothing going on.<eos> Business as usual.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know you adore my brother.<eos> We both do.
So, how do you explain the way that you've looked at me, flirted with me, I'm not wrong about this.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> You really really are.<eos> OK.<eos> Well...<eos> I don't know if we can work together any more.<eos> So, um, you're just gonna quit?<eos> Move back to London?<eos> I said I don't know.<eos> I don't.
I wasn't here when she got back. I had to work.<eos> Maybe if I hadn't...<eos> Would you like some water?<eos> Why don't you let us get that for you?<eos> Gastric bypass was a pretty good cover story.<eos> Maggie could explain away the trip out of the country, any follow-up appointments, any pain or cramping.<eos> What if she really did book that surgery?<eos> Well, you looked at her pretty closely at the morgue.<eos> If she had had her stomach stapled, wouldn't you have noticed?<eos> She didn't.
Not necessarily.<eos> 40 pounds of concentrated opiate can be cut and processed into 300 pounds of street-grade horse.<eos> Now, even the largest cartels lack the facilities to perform that kind of alchemy overnight.<eos> It's hard to imagine Escanso and Turk were working for a cartel.<eos> The big syndicates have their own pipelines.<eos> They wouldn't waste time planning a one-off score like this, with amateurs.<eos> Amateurs have to sell to professionals eventually.<eos> Well, the DEA should have a list of cartels that can handle that kind of weight.<eos> You two feel like knocking on the doors of a few drug lords this afternoon?<eos> Yes, I do indeed.
How could it be you?<eos> I gave Pine what I knew.<eos> You did? You...<eos> She was in my car.<eos> Kalinda.<eos> She took it?<eos> Took what?<eos> I'm such an idiot.<eos> The flash drive.<eos> - She did this?
He's not like you.<eos> He never was... and he never will be.<eos> Your father doesn't have much time left.<eos> This is your time now.<eos> I'll do my best.<eos> Mum.<eos> I know Dad loved you, and I love you, too.<eos> And so does Cyrus.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Of course he does.
You'll always be the someday I want.<eos> But I have to go back and you have to stay.<eos> It'll be easier this way.<eos> The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States.<eos> And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday.<eos> But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.
Where I come from, a little money is a lot of money.<eos> So you killed him for money?<eos> I killed a man with a hammer once.<eos> Killed another man with my bare hands just for looking at my girl.<eos> - I'm sure she appreciated that.<eos> - Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.
- Those times were for free.<eos> I never would've done what I done to your brother if I'd known it was him.<eos> And not 'cause he was a prince. 'Cause he was him.<eos> They said it was a military accident.<eos> Of course they did.<eos> You gotta ask yourself, who "they" are.<eos> - Who are they?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I mostly operate UAV's.<eos> At least, I did.
Beach rental, adorable, still avail, perfect location, and two bedrooms.<eos> - How much?<eos> - Check it out, you're gonna die.<eos> - Dying! - God!<eos> Dead!<eos> - Get it!<eos> - I already did.<eos> Yes!<eos> Oh, God, I can't wait to tell the boys!<eos> I already did.
Your life isn't over, General.<eos> And neither was the angel that you loved.<eos> I've missed you so much.<eos> Clementine?<eos> Do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> We could have had peace.<eos> If Claire dies because of you...<eos> Not very smart wearing David's watch around.<eos> Zoe, you gotta listen.<eos> I didn't...
Fast and Furious damaged a lot of agents' careers.<eos> No one really wants to relive it.<eos> It's not about what they want, Zoe.<eos> Okay, but we come on too strong, they'll shut down.<eos> We should go to them-- it's less adversarial.<eos> Listen, I've been doing this a little longer than you, and I know one thing:<eos> we got to put pressure on them.<eos> Trust me.<eos> You know, I hate it when someone says "trust me."<eos> I immediately don't.
Pick... up... your gun.<eos> Now! Pick it up!<eos> Christopher.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What needs to be done, King.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I've wanted this bastard for 20 years.<eos> He doesn't deserve a new start.<eos> You're right.<eos> He doesn't.
Come on, Victor.<eos> Not kidding.<eos> PERUGIAN: Does this mean we can't make love?<eos> MARJORIE: Of course we can, just have to be quiet.<eos> Yeah, this isn't gonna work.<eos> Oh, God, the big one.<eos> Is my daughter here?<eos> - No, she left. - Oh.<eos> You know where she went?<eos> - I do not.
No, you have to understand.<eos> Do you know where I was, the three weeks 'they were trying to find me?<eos> '<eos> Looking for you.<eos> I was gonna be the hero instead I get arrested, thrown in jail.<eos> 'They investigate my parents, tear up my uncle's farm' because I wanted to help you.<eos> Because I didn't believe what people said about you and your friends.<eos> - Just let me explain...<eos> - 'Don't.'<eos> Just don't.
And it was all a lie.<eos> One big, disgusting lie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Would you be okay if your entire life you were told something that you saw with your own eyes wasn't real?<eos> I mean, they made me doubt myself.<eos> I've... I've always doubted myself.<eos> At least now we know the truth.<eos> Do we?<eos> 'Cause I'm havin' a hard time believing nobody else in this family knew about Charles.<eos> Somebody did.
- Were they?<eos> - No.<eos> Why did you sneak out in the middle of the night like that?<eos> I don't wanna cause any problems between you and your mom.<eos> Did she say something to scare you off?<eos> No.<eos> If-if you overheard anything she said yesterday...<eos> I'm screwed up, Emily.<eos> I know it, your mom knows it..<eos> ...and you do too.
I do belong in therapy.<eos> But it's not what I wanna be doin' right now.<eos> What do you wanna do?<eos> Simple things.<eos> Take a walk on the beach.<eos> Swim in the ocean.<eos> I can't get back the time I lost, but..<eos> I don't wanna waste any more of it sitting in a room having someone analyze me.<eos> I don't expect anyone to understand any of this.<eos> I do.
What's takin' Hanna so long?<eos> I don't know, she probably has to drag Mona here on a leash.<eos> Oh, Spencer, we saw A jump off a building.<eos> A set up an underground bunker with more spy equipment than the CIA.<eos> I mean, seriously, in your heart do you believe that Lesli Stone could...<eos> People can surprise you.<eos> Mona maintained a 4.0 average and perfect hair while she was tapping Rosewood's police calls.<eos> Spencer, we jumped on the Andrew train...<eos> But he didn't have a motive.<eos> This girl does.
So the photo of...<eos> Kimye will look the same on your phone, your smart pad, and your computer.<eos> What's Kimye?<eos> Kanye and Kim?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You wouldn't, uh...<eos> You've been...<eos> You know what actually?<eos> You don't even need to know.<eos> No one does.
Which I know is-is very presumptuous and if you want somebody else to write it...<eos> No.<eos> No, I mean...<eos> Who knows me better than you do?<eos> And you definitely used your creative writing skills.<eos> When...<eos> When did I have a solo exhibit at The Brew?<eos> I might have embellished slightly.<eos> But I mean, I do have your self-portrait hangin' above my desk.<eos> I did.
- Yeah.<eos> Um, I was just gonna go to The Brew and pick up some muffins for you and Caleb and surprise you.<eos> I actually have a surprise for you instead.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Open it.<eos> Thirty thousand dollars?<eos> It's your tuition, Hanna.<eos> I promised you I would figure out how to pay for college.<eos> - Didn't I?<eos> - Mom, eh, how did you..
Work?<eos> Sara's got a job?<eos> That's great.<eos> God, if I went through what she did, I don't think I'd remember how to read, never mind be able to...<eos> We all remember how to read.<eos> No, I mean, that..<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I don't know the right thing to say here.<eos> Of course not.<eos> No one does.
You need a sandwich.<eos> Would it help if I were there?<eos> - Where?<eos> - At Spencer's.<eos> The-the barn prom.<eos> I thought you said that you..<eos> Uh, that was when I was gonna be sharing a punch bowl with a bunch of former students.<eos> If you want me there, I will be there.<eos> Unless I have to dress up like a troll or something.<eos> I don't, do I?
I haven't finished explaining the protocol if your voice is recognised.<eos> Then you can admit to recognising theirs?<eos> That's correct.<eos> - Same time next week?<eos> The shift doesn't end for another 15 minutes.<eos> My husband isn't well and he'll worry if I'm not home by quarter past.<eos> Well, um...<eos> I suppose that'll have to be enough for today.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you worked here, Mrs Simms.<eos> - She doesn't yet.
That couldn't have gone over too well.<eos> I can scratch off number fifteen off my list.<eos> "She would regret never getting"...<eos> April Carver got fired from a job?<eos> I'm trying something new.<eos> I love it.<eos> Wow, babe, you look stunning.<eos> We both do.<eos> And you know you're not dying tomorrow, right?<eos> I don't.
Why don't you leave?<eos> I'm done.<eos> - Get some sleep.<eos> We'll talk tomorrow.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> If this can get me through months in the hospital, it can definitely keep you entertained for five to seven hours of your donation.<eos> Fingers crossed.<eos> Have you thought any more about the recipient?<eos> - Do you want to know?<eos> - I do.
If I tell you where he is, Do you promise to use that information. Only as a means to find reddington?<eos> You have my word.<eos> In bethesda, there is a small, second story flat.<eos> In the flat, you will find a desk.<eos> The middle drawer has a false front.<eos> Remove it and you will find a silver case along with a key.<eos> This is about the fulcrum.<eos> Yes.<eos> You still have it.<eos> I do. This case, the key.
Hey, sweetheart.<eos> Hi, kitty.<eos> The doctor says you did well.<eos> Elizabeth. She's fine.<eos> You need to go to my flat.<eos> I'm taking take care of it.<eos> You were right, dembe.<eos> I should have told her.<eos> I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.
Currently a guard at Victorville Penitentiary.<eos> But back in '08, worked security for one Mr. Arkady Kolcheck.<eos> This could mean Arkady's the one that put the hit out on Patrick Berkeley.<eos> We have an address for Turner?<eos> Already in your phones.<eos> Good job.<eos> Keep Callen and Sam in the loop.<eos> You asked if we could find out anything on the hit man that tried to take the Berkeleys out.<eos> Nikolai Brantov?<eos> Unfortunately, we did.
Car.<eos> This is DI Kane.<eos> I have a suspected suicide attempt at Trinity multistorey.<eos> I need a fire crew and a negotiator as a priority, please.<eos> Go away.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Tom?<eos> Tom, I'm not going to do that, mate, because I don't think<eos> - that's what you really want.<eos> - I do! I do.
I can't believe she's pregnant again.<eos> What a dummy.<eos> I wonder how much abobos even cost these days.<eos> I should offer to go with her.<eos> We could get post-abobo Mani-pedis.<eos> Oh, Gretchen, you don't need to pretend you have friends.<eos> What?<eos> I have friends.<eos> No, there's nothing wrong with not having friends.<eos> I don't.
What were you saying?<eos> You can run all you like, but Dance will get you.<eos> You and your brother.<eos> Tell me what you know.<eos> Marriage? Ha!<eos> The devil!<eos> What was he thinking of?<eos> I never expected it to go this far.<eos> I thought it'd be over in a week.<eos> - Didn't we all!
Look, some of the best writers in the world have never written a word.<eos> You want to write?<eos> Here.<eos> Start by getting yourself a lap dance.<eos> Go ahead. Go on.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Not that one... she's kind of my strip club wife.<eos> All right, good boy.<eos> Do you want to get a lap dance with me?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do.
What the hell's going on?<eos> You told me not to think about dicks, so my brain got real bored and I started reading these Web sites, and then some other Web sites that disagreed with the first Web sites.<eos> (gasps) Did you know about global warming?<eos> It's a huge threat, but at the same time is made up by a bunch of socialist lib-tards.<eos> My question is, who benefits?<eos> You have to follow the money, Gretch.<eos> Big oil, the Middle East.<eos> (snaps fingers) Benghazi!<eos> I don't want to talk about Benghazi.<eos> Nobody does!
I could fail miserably and make a fool of myself and never be able to face him again.<eos> Fine. Then let Sean take a shot.<eos> Oh, you're good.<eos> (Buddy) The funeral made me realize Buddy Dobbs, the dirt bag, was gone forever.<eos> I was now Jonathan Barlow, trusted pastor.<eos> In light of this criminal connection, we have to ask ourselves, what do we really know about this guy?<eos> I Googled Pastor Barlow the day he got here.<eos> There's almost nothing online about him.<eos> Let's face it--we don't even know exactly why he was relieved of his duties in Florida.<eos> - I do.
Uh...tomorrow?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Your first service.<eos> Oh! Right, yeah, of course.<eos> - Hey, Thanks, Alden.<eos> - Yes, I trust that you will give us a service that will uphold the dignified standards of your predecessor.<eos> You don't have any of those services on video, do you?<eos> 'Cause I'd kinda like to see how it's done.<eos> I mean...how it used to be done.<eos> Uh...uh... no, I don't.
'Do you have the occupants with you?<eos> Control, what was the marker for?<eos> 'Child Abduction, over.'<eos> 'The occupants of the car have left the scene.<eos> - 'PC Moretti and I are searching the area now.'<eos> - I said I'm sorry.<eos> 'Can I confirm their description please?<eos> Look, I hadn't done a commentary before... .. and the bloody sat nav...<eos> I don't know if it's an A road, B road...<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, what else can we do?<eos> Castle, you can't be a part of this. Not anymore.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I have to be.<eos> We don't know this man's agenda.<eos> No, no, Beckett. I need to be...<eos> What you need to do is go back to the loft and stay there.<eos> Now, I've assigned a security detail to you.<eos> - Why would I be a target? - I don't know.<eos> And neither do you.
This way.<eos> Please.<eos> It's-it's okay, it's okay.<eos> Sorry for the rough treatment.<eos> I wasn't sure you'd accept a more formal invitation.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want to help you liberate Abuddin from the apostate Al Fayeeds.<eos> Finish the job your father started 30 years ago.<eos> - I'm done fighting.<eos> - Done?
For Triva.<eos> Find someone to talk to about what happened.<eos> A friend, teammate.<eos> __<eos> Your girlfriend would also be a good person to open up to.<eos> It's Sara, right?<eos> Did Sara understand your relationship with Triva?<eos> Sort of.<eos> You know how it is, old girl, new girl.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Brenna: Hey, Greer.<eos> I miss you too.<eos> Remember when we almost got kicked out of private school?<eos> Well, now I actually did...<eos> By my mom.<eos> It was really awesome of her to force me to go to Charton against my will, wait until I was happy there and then force me to leave.<eos> I had to quit my job at Alchemy 'cause it's too far from my new school.<eos> But since April got sick, she always comes first, especially now that she's getting married.<eos> There's, like, no way to compete with the cancer bride.<eos> So I don't.
I...<eos> I can't go to the conference.<eos> Really?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - I am. I... I have just too much going on at home right now for me to even consider planning a trip away.<eos> So...<eos> I hope you understand.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I do.
All those computer wires stuffed into one outlet, they yours?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> You got to be more careful.<eos> I use a power strip.<eos> I cut it off, I swear to God, I did.<eos> He doesn't know for sure that's what started it.<eos> You got to keep the faith, Billy.<eos> The truth comes out.<eos> You believe me, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I do.
What does Liv want him to do?<eos> Yeah, what does Liv want him to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She's gone.<eos> She ran away.<eos> - Then you do know.<eos> - I don't!<eos> Stop telling me the opposite of what I am telling you.<eos> I am too tired for this!<eos> I don't!
Not celebrating a Morange's death?<eos> The police won't do much to arrest the murderer.<eos> We're already questioning someone.<eos> The Larcher girl?<eos> I fucking told him.<eos> Not her.<eos> Because you knew?<eos> Etienne found out.<eos> He banned him seeing her and gave her a roasting.<eos> Like he did to his wife?
To redeem a father who is still recovering<eos> - from the effects of being wrongly convicted.<eos> - That does...<eos> Enough!<eos> Nobody here is being paid by the word.<eos> Ms. Clarke, my thoughts.<eos> I will grant bail, but I do so with great concern and under the strictest of conditions.<eos> If I hear even a rumor that my conditions for release have been violated, I will have you locked up so fast your inscrutable little head will spin.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes, I do, Your Honor.
The one on your leg should go off-line, and this will become the live monitor and stay here.<eos> And I just walk out the door?<eos> Theoretically.<eos> Okay, look, I know that word doesn't radiate confidence.<eos> Guys, I gotta focus here.<eos> Can I talk to you outside?<eos> Sure. Yeah.<eos> Anywhere that's less than 6 feet from the door.<eos> Who knew Victoria had it in her?<eos> Well, I did.
Oh, yeah. I mean I know that's happening.<eos> I meant... you know, what's happening else?<eos> Nothing.<eos> What did you get him?<eos> I... I, um...<eos> I got him a... oh no, no... oh no...<eos> Ha ha, almost got me.<eos> It's a surprise.<eos> Guys, you didn't have to get me anything.<eos> Good, because she obviously didn't.
Out of the way.<eos> No!<eos> No, they'll tear her apart.<eos> Slot her. What?<eos> You can't...<eos> No, you can't!<eos> I have to do this.<eos> What sort of human being puts another person at risk just to prove a point?<eos> You don't run this prison, Smith.<eos> I do.
I'm putting an end to our little agreement.<eos> You're on your own, Franky.<eos> Fuck!<eos> The screws'll never think of looking in there.<eos> Got a food delivery to bring in.<eos> Maybe you should have told your mates not to start burning their gear out in the yard.<eos> Get back to your units.<eos> Open the door or Vinegar Tits gets it.<eos> You don't run this prison.<eos> I do.
Sit tight.<eos> Dude.<eos> We're bringing him in.<eos> He's clean.<eos> Nothing outstanding.<eos> No warrants, nothing.<eos> We're bringing him in.<eos> Mr. Yates, it looks like your car was reported as being involved in a hit-and-run where a pedestrian was injured.<eos> Do you know anything about that?<eos> No, I don't.
There shouldn't be.<eos> He's a murderer and a rapist.<eos> We all know that, but no offense to your legal acumen, the jury isn't privy to what we know.<eos> They all see the same charming man whose smile lured dozens of women to their deaths.<eos> Liv, we need to prep.<eos> This is going to be hard on you.<eos> I'm fine, we went over it.<eos> Just give me a second, okay?<eos> Hey, maybe you don't want to be in there.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Just like I am now.<eos> Feel free to put all that in your report.<eos> Why would he have done it?<eos> Why would he have wanted to harm your hives?<eos> I don't have any idea.<eos> I just know what I saw.<eos> No, I'm a consultant with the NYPD.<eos> But a warrant could be arranged pursuant to my request.<eos> Or, if you prefer, a formal summons could be issued in response to this needless obstruction.<eos> No, don't me on hol...
Ow. Your face...<eos> Priceless.<eos> How is what you're doing any different than Meredith Grey?<eos> We've been over this...<eos> Because my husband didn't die, because I'm not running away from anything, because this is an incredible opportunity for me to learn surgical techniques that I've never even dreamed of.<eos> Jackson, it's only three months.<eos> You could at least pretend to be happy for me.<eos> Why?<eos> I don't like it.<eos> I don't.
- Really?<eos> - Mm-hmm. In World War I.<eos> And his son Christopher was in World War II.<eos> Good salad.<eos> What did we do before quinoa?<eos> And while he was writing Lord of the Rings, he was sending excerpts to Christopher to get his mind off the war.<eos> I do that too.<eos> You know, I'm not a writer, but I make videos for my mom.<eos> Aw, I bet she loves getting them.<eos> She did.

- Yep.<eos> And the turkey pot pie.<eos> You got it.<eos> * Pastoral scene of the... * Oh, and I bought that Bible, by the way.<eos> Did you?<eos> I'd like to discuss it with you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Not here.<eos> So you got the job, I see.<eos> Yes, sir. I did. Coffee?
Oh, we'll be going home soon.<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> Is anyone there?<eos> Can you open the door, please?<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello.<eos> Randall: Tough choice, Frank.<eos> Either way, somebody you love dies.<eos> Or maybe you all do.
No, no. No, my sister.<eos> Her kids.<eos> We found out too late, Mr. Frink.<eos> But you are free to go.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I... I'm free to go?<eos> I am free to go?<eos> You have suffered enough, and I am not a monster.<eos> If you ever need any more Jews to kill, you know where to find me.<eos> Yes. I do.
Yes, yes, I'm still here.<eos> Yes, Ms. Grant wants all of the hostesses dressed as Supergirl.<eos> Right, uh, red, blue, the "S."<eos> Thank you.<eos> This isn't on you, Kara.<eos> I have to find this man.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> With my help.<eos> Do you have someplace private we can talk?<eos> Do we ever.
You've got to be shitting me.<eos> You're not worried this guy's dangerous?<eos> I mean he's been stalking you ever since you arrived.<eos> It's a lot creepier than that. Come on.<eos> Here's how this is going to work.<eos> Lara's going to wait out here with Derek.<eos> You go in and sit on the bed, then I'll come in and we'll talk but the door stays open the whole time.<eos> I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> You know that.<eos> No. I don't.
It doesn't matter.<eos> Maui's put the word out on that, too.<eos> If Dries sells you any more tavi, he'll be strung up by his balls.<eos> There's no way you can get some.<eos> Not from anyone.<eos> And thank Christ for that, if this is what it does to you.<eos> You could always steal it.<eos> I'm just saying.<eos> If you wanted to.<eos> He doesn't! OK.
I want your input.<eos> Thank you, Dwight.<eos> I'm unclear.<eos> Is this trial a stalling tactic, or is it the rebirth of democracy?<eos> Can't it be both?<eos> Keep the process legit while I'm gone.<eos> Just stop the car.<eos> Stop the car!<eos> I want to do it again.<eos> No, you don't.
Sure.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Oh, don't be surprised if when you come back, you have a few grandkids.<eos> Arla wants three.<eos> I love you, James.<eos> Lucy, no.<eos> You can't do this.<eos> I have to.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Yes, I do.
Who knows what you'd do to me with that stuff?<eos> Fine.<eos> Answer me this...<eos> How far are you willing to go for Audrey?<eos> 'Cause I would do anything for Mara.<eos> And... and she would do anything for me.<eos> You're wrong.<eos> Mara wanted to get you back, but only so she could find your stash of Aether.<eos> You knew where it was.<eos> She didn't.
- Yeah.<eos> Help Nathan out any way you can, okay?<eos> Here we go.<eos> You said the Troubles were Mara's... work?<eos> Yes. Your work.<eos> Really following in your father's footsteps.<eos> I hope it's not too hot.<eos> Oh, Audrey... I don't want to hurt you.<eos> You're my daughter.<eos> And even if I did, poison?
He can turn it into a power, use it to show his daughter how amazing the future can be if she joins him.<eos> Please don't.<eos> You look so worried, Kirby.<eos> But don't you know what's going to happen?<eos> Haven't you seen how you're going to meet your end?<eos> I've tried, but I can only see how other people die, not me.<eos> If you had seen it, it would've looked a lot like this.<eos> I know how it ends for you, Crocker.<eos> I can see it.<eos> Just like Vanessa did.
I've been working out.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> It's too soon to tell.<eos> What can I help you with, Dr. Curtis?<eos> There's someone I'd like you to meet.<eos> Ava?<eos> This is Dr. Hamza.<eos> If she overdosed, she shouldn't be on morphine.<eos> It's a light dosage on a slow drip.<eos> I did a full liver and blood work-up.
He overruled her.<eos> They had a syringe to your throat and she wouldn't move an inch.<eos> We don't negotiate with prisoners.<eos> You know the policy.<eos> OK.<eos> I'm sorry, the place is a bit of a mess.<eos> Why did you say no?<eos> Why was the offer even made?<eos> I mean, Ferguson doesn't want me there.<eos> Yes, she does.
Are you trying to threaten me?<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> Because you're trying to intimidate me and I don't like it.<eos> I don't respect it.<eos> I'm bored, Gidget.<eos> I'm sick of everyone and I'm sick of myself.<eos> I hate it here.<eos> I know.<eos> I told you, I didn't take it.<eos> Yeah, well, then who did, huh?
May I offer you my congratulations?<eos> You may.<eos> Was there anything else?<eos> Not that I can think of.<eos> Vera.<eos> Mr Channing.<eos> Everything alright?<eos> During the riot, when I was held hostage... ..did the governor refuse to open the doors to isolation?<eos> Yes.<eos> She did.
Where is she?<eos> I want Bea!<eos> Prisoner advocate Smith will not be able to take part in this hearing.<eos> She's, ah, incapacitated.<eos> You don't remember any of that?<eos> No.<eos> I fucking killed him!<eos> I killed Harry Smith.<eos> I don't have psychotic episodes.<eos> I don't.
Hey, Ms Westfall, I think you might be interested in this.<eos> I've got Bea Smith's tox report back.<eos> So, can I get out of here yet?<eos> Not up to me.<eos> Your bloods just came back.<eos> You had an hallucinogenic in your system.<eos> So I was drugged?<eos> So, you didn't take them yourself?<eos> No.<eos> I don't do that shit.
'You know, I saw into her soul.<eos> It's just black.<eos> 'It's darkness.'<eos> And then I could see into her mind.<eos> I could see the horror.<eos> I knew she was a freak, but I didn't think she'd go this far.<eos> She's fuckin' demented.<eos> You believe me, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Hey, Liz. Hey.<eos> You know, you're not a nice person when you drink.<eos> Yeah, well, I'm off it.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, that's only cos Maxine chucked it out.<eos> It was a relapse, Bea.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> You get your hands on more booze and you'll have another one.<eos> Oh, and you'd know.<eos> Yeah, I do actually.
As a kid,<eos> I'd come from school every day praying you weren't drunk.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Sophie...<eos> No, listen.<eos> I'd walk through the front door and see you, and when you hadn't had a drink,<eos> God,<eos> I'd be so happy.<eos> But I knew it wasn't going to last.<eos> And it never did.
It's okay.<eos> - Take a breath.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> The prosecution is trying to prevent the jury from hearing Brett's alibi.<eos> One of the witnesses has died, and our only record of her testimony is in this previous trial.<eos> She's exactly right, Your Honor.<eos> That's exactly why we want to exclude this transcript.<eos> Because this witness, a stripper named Lexie Bromwich, perjured herself on the stand.<eos> Do you have evidence to that effect?<eos> Why, I do.
Thank you, Mrs. Florrick.<eos> Uh, Daniel Cain.<eos> Uh, my occupation now is... not much.<eos> Beer drinker.<eos> Um, but I used to work as a bouncer at the Pink Sapphire.<eos> You worked with the defendant Mr. Tatro?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Hey, Brett.<eos> Do you have any memory of Lexie Bromwich?<eos> Yeah, I do.
We know that the alibi is false.<eos> We know that Brett was in that parking lot.<eos> - He told us so.<eos> - Yes, but we're not putting him on the stand, so we're not suborning perjury.<eos> Okay, but we are allowing Dakota's testimony to be entered into the record, a testimony we know is false.<eos> - We have to tell the judge.<eos> - No.<eos> Listen, Amber.<eos> When we argued for the transcript to be admitted, we didn't know it was false.<eos> Yes, but we do now.
Have you met Joshua?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You know, I miss us.<eos> I miss your smell on me.<eos> I miss you inside of me.<eos> What... what are you talking about, Warner?<eos> Don't you remember what you said to me? No, I...<eos> I don't.<eos> You said that you loved me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Come to Lizzie.<eos> Here you go, Dor.<eos> That's the way.<eos> I put extra sugar in it to pep you up.<eos> Oh, thanks Jess.<eos> Come to Jess!<eos> Righto, righto.<eos> You right?<eos> Jessie loves her Joshy.<eos> Yes, she does.
Doesn't mean there was a dog.<eos> Maybe he just said that to get you out the house while his friend went upstairs.<eos> Mrs Simpson...<eos> Oh, Tilly, dear.<eos> Tilly.<eos> Er, did you notice anything about the boys?<eos> Clothes?<eos> Height?<eos> Er... I don't know.<eos> I didn't really...
Boo-fucking-hoo. - Hey!<eos> - You don't talk to him like that.<eos> - I'll level with you.<eos> I'm not here for my people skills.<eos> I'm sure you've lots of stuff to work out with your mother but, for the moment, let's stick to the facts.<eos> Armageddon is tomorrow.<eos> Your mother has a bunker, she wants to save your life, so let's go.<eos> Well, actually, no, I'm sorry to disappoint you<eos> - but I don't wanna live.<eos> - But your nephew does.
- Barely.<eos> Back on the truck.<eos> All right, come on, you guys.<eos> We're gonna get you out, buddy. don't worry.<eos> Hey, Keith.<eos> My name is Meredith.<eos> We're gonna get you out of there, okay?<eos> That'd be great.<eos> How do we even start?<eos> We just do.
How far away was the hospital?<eos> How long were you sitting there waiting for them to declare him brain-dead?<eos> How many hours later was it before I was even informed?<eos> How many chances did you have when you could have called me?<eos> Why didn't you call me?<eos> There wasn't anything you could've done.<eos> He was too far gone.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> You don't know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I mean, I'm totally kidding.<eos> Anyhow, it's not like you just suddenly were gay.<eos> I mean, you had crushes.<eos> And you had-- You had that whole thing with the girl in college.<eos> Come on, every girl had something in college.<eos> No, no, not everyone.<eos> I didn't. You didn't?<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> How about you, Monte?<eos> Did you?
A.J.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - It's a free country.<eos> This where you and your brother used to meet?<eos> Being up here would make me feel like a superhero too.<eos> So what's the plan?<eos> Just gonna wait up here until he shows, if he shows?<eos> Why do you care?<eos> You don't want me around.<eos> Mike does.
Why haven't you got a father?<eos> I'm so sorry. I...<eos> I didn't mean to say that out loud.<eos> Sorry, Toby.<eos> Come on, let's help clear this up.<eos> Laura said your family's all dead.<eos> - What?<eos> - Did you kill them?<eos> No.<eos> No, Toby, I didn't.
Then begin colonization of the entire building.<eos> Then I propose that royal, here, draw up plans to remodel the lower floors.<eos> Yes, a driving range.<eos> Cricket nets.<eos> Clubhouse.<eos> What about the horse?<eos> What about the horse?<eos> We're gonna eat it.<eos> Dinner parties don't grow on trees, darling.<eos> French do it all the time.
Come on, live it up!<eos> So, tell me what's going on?<eos> Are you enjoying a hunk of Fisher pie?<eos> Oh, is this girl talk? Is that what this is?<eos> Look, I know he's Fisher-licious, but...<eos> Liam's been gone less than a week.<eos> The body's still warm.<eos> There is nothing going on between me and Fisher.<eos> Okay, well, if you want my opinion on turning Liam down...<eos> I don't.
Well, I'm gonna have this conversation with Drew later.<eos> I don't need to have it with you.<eos> Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait. You're seeing him'?<eos> Yeah, parent-teacher conference.<eos> Oh. Will I see you before?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Um, Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon, so...<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
- Come here, sit back down.<eos> I think we could do better this time.<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't want to sit down.<eos> No, I-I want another chance.<eos> Look, I'm sorry.<eos> You're sorry?<eos> This is not easy for me, either.<eos> I love you guys.<eos> I really do.
It's just everything is so fragile.<eos> Just life, I mean. I--<eos> I can't go to Jupiter!<eos> Who am I kidding?<eos> I can't even--<eos> What are you saying, Fritz?<eos> What I'm saying is just--<eos> Is that a decoder ring?<eos> I know that I'm no war hero or even brave, and I have sciatica, and--<eos> I do!
Did you kill that bed sheet yourself or what?<eos> It's all I ever want.<eos> Meat, meat, meat.<eos> Robert says it's the iron.<eos> - Mm.<eos> - What about you, Abby? Any cravings?<eos> Oh, it's usually just whatever they're out of at the commissary.<eos> Oh, the commissary's a disaster.<eos> You should see the shopping list I foist on Robert when he's traveling.<eos> You do a lot of traveling, don't you, Dr. Oppenheimer?
That'll work.<eos> You got any last advice before I walk the plank?<eos> Uh, well, um, yes, as a matter of fact.<eos> You should take the assignment with G group.<eos> It doesn't matter what you think of Charlie Isaacs.<eos> This test-- this test is the start of a whole new era.<eos> This is like Auro's interplanetary cruise ship crash-landing on Jupiter.<eos> I don't know, I--<eos> I just- - I don't need the prestige.<eos> - Maybe most guys do, but--
Are you getting a new phone?<eos> 'Cause if you're changing your number,<eos> I'm gonna have to add that to the church directory.<eos> No, this is a private line.<eos> What do you need a private line for?<eos> It's a-a hotline to the pastor so that we can talk church business at any time.<eos> Okay, you're good to go.<eos> Oh, I-I see. So you can conduct your affairs without me knowing. What affair?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Neither does she.
I love being out. So, Roger, you want to give me a hand?<eos> Excuse us.<eos> I think it's going pretty well.<eos> I know.<eos> Isn't it weird how right this feels? - Please take your hand off my thigh.<eos> - Uh-huh. Well, this is definitely not the weekend I was expecting.<eos> Well, I guess we shouldn't be completely surprised.<eos> His voice mail was sung to the tune of Candle in the Wind.<eos> [sighs] The main thing is he seems happy.<eos> He really does.
Please make me a smoothie!<eos> I know this might seem a little scary, Sofia... but Elliot and I are here for you every step of the way.<eos> Anything you need, you let us know.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> Just think, our own little bundle of... crap!<eos> Look at all these posters.<eos> Oh, I can't!<eos> If I wasn't gay already...<eos> I wouldn't know the first thing to do with this.<eos> Yeah, neither do straight guys.
The GMC felt it wasn't appropriate for me to stay working, so they've asked me to take some time off pending an investigation.<eos> But you're the senior doctor.<eos> Well, what's the complaint?<eos> Chris, you can't ask that!<eos> A man says I threatened to burn him with a lit cigarette unless he left his girlfriend alone.<eos> He said you threatened him?<eos> Well, you've just got to pity some people, haven't you?<eos> Fantasist.<eos> But why would he make that up?<eos> He didn't.
Well, we may find some answers in that alley.<eos> Let's go check it out.<eos> Okay, Castle and I are gonna scrub traffic cams.<eos> Maybe we'll find the shooter there.<eos> Anything yet?<eos> No.<eos> No blood, no shell casings, no nothing.<eos> Hey, doesn't this remind you of, uh, that sketch from "Saturday Night Tonight" where, uh, Mickey Franks plays Sherlock Holmes' wacky cousin?<eos> No, I don't watch that stupid show, bro.<eos> - You don't?
So a show that brought joy, laughter, and "judge booty" to people everywhere may have been built on drug money.<eos> Yeah, but the lawsuit was thrown out, so while Sid was getting rich, van Zant was rotting in prison.<eos> You know, maybe van Zant was who Sid was talking about when he told his wife someone was after him.<eos> Makes sense, right?<eos> If van Zant felt that Sid owed him a share of the profits from the show, maybe he came to collect.<eos> And when Sid didn't want to go along, van Zant opted for revenge instead.<eos> Where is van Zant now?<eos> He's registered at a hotel up in Queens.<eos> Yo. I sent van Zant's photo to security at "S.N.T.," asked if anybody saw him last night.<eos> No one did.
I can really pack 'em in!<eos> Be careful how loud you say that.<eos> Check out all these hotties.<eos> This is the best party ever!<eos> But it's weird...<eos> I haven't seen any of my friends.<eos> No, th-they're here.<eos> You know, th-they're around.<eos> Yeah, no one wanted to miss the chance to party with San Francisco's... sexiest bachelor.<eos> No, they didn't.
He's just so excited for me to go that he came up with the whole plan himself.<eos> Coming up with plans, is he?<eos> What can I say?<eos> He's an amazing guy.<eos> (Laughing sarcastically) Is he?<eos> Is he?<eos> You saw us kiss.<eos> That's the only explanation for your big sudden gesture to Jake.<eos> - Gabi...<eos> - Don't Gabi me! Okay?
Yeah!<eos> And if you leave now, you guys can get there before it starts.<eos> Gabi, you have two weeks off.<eos> Go follow your dream.<eos> I...<eos> I can't believe you did this.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> I don't know how to thank you.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Oh, so we have a plan.<eos> You see, this is the first Christmas we're not spending with our families, because my dad's out of town...<eos> Yeah, and because tickets are cheaper after the holidays, so I'm flying home to see my family on the 26th of March.<eos> I decided we gotta make it special by creating new traditions.<eos> Ooh! Like sipping mulled wine and doing a 2,000 piece jigsaw puzzle!<eos> Maybe.<eos> - Put that on.<eos> Oh, you're so cute. - (Knock on door)<eos> Who wants a virgin eggnog?<eos> Ooh, I do.
An iguana?<eos> I'm not gonna call you anything.<eos> I'm here because I want to put everything behind us.<eos> Well, aren't I lucky?<eos> Louis, please.<eos> You were right.<eos> I was a dick in that meeting and again in the bathroom and again with Jessica.<eos> I said some things that I wish I could take back, but we've been friends with each other for a long time, and I don't want to throw that away.<eos> You really mean that?<eos> I do.
Why do you say it like that?<eos> - Like what?<eos> - With disgust.<eos> 'Cause Harvey's got autographed basketballs and vintage records, and you've got a photograph of a guy's shoes.<eos> Well, you better be careful or Sergeant Hulka with the big toe is gonna see how far he can stick it up your ass.<eos> What the hell are you talking about?<eos> Stripes.<eos> I'm just quoting Stripes.<eos> It's a movie.<eos> Harvey and I do this all the time.
Now I look like I'm the irresponsible one, not Drew.<eos> He thinks I'm this... thing.<eos> Val, that's ridiculous.<eos> I am not ridiculous.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Look at her... mocking me with her noodles.<eos> Will you talk to her?<eos> - Laura?<eos> - Yeah. She loves you.<eos> She does, doesn't she?
You're also gonna tell her the truth.<eos> That you're married, cheat on your wife, you hire hookers.<eos> That you never had any intention of being serious with her.<eos> Why?<eos> That would destroy her.<eos> She thinks that... We're in love.<eos> Krista needs to avoid dickheads like you in the future.<eos> Her radar needs fixing.<eos> I'll know if you skip any detail.<eos> So don't.
You're really bringing that up at a time like this?<eos> You asked, I answered, succinctly.<eos> Well, perhaps I was too hasty.<eos> I'd like, for the moment, to take in the music.<eos> Besides... plenty of other items on our agenda.<eos> The fucking Congo can wait.<eos> Oh, your troubles are weighing heavily on you.<eos> I'm not entirely sure why.<eos> I was told that you know the person responsible.<eos> Of course we do.
Are you sexually active?<eos> I was.<eos> A sexually active woman is a powerful force.<eos> She exudes the scent.<eos> The scent?<eos> Pheromones.<eos> The scent lets him know you're ready to engage.<eos> Like a wolf.<eos> But what if I don't have a scent?<eos> You do.
You know you are going to have to let me out of here eventually, right?<eos> If I let you out, how do I know you're not going to kill me?<eos> I would, but then who will pay my alimony and child support?<eos> Mother fucker.<eos> I should just let you die.<eos> Is there any more soy sauce?<eos> Why'd you do it?<eos> Why'd you cheat?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
[Alex] Previously on Casual.<eos> Hi, Grandma.<eos> Why are you at Alex's house?<eos> My mom and I are staying here since the divorce.<eos> Valerie got divorced?<eos> [Valerie] Laura and I have to go look at houses later this afternoon.<eos> What's Wrong with my house?<eos> You knew we weren't gonna live here forever.<eos> I do now.
I am literally on the verge of getting a restraining order.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> - No, Randy. I have seen more angles of your penis than I have of my ex-husbands.<eos> Why didn't you look at your husband's penis more?<eos> Because he's too busy plunging it into a 22 year-old grad student who he... apparently is also his cycling buddy.<eos> Oh, how did I know that?<eos> Because my mother called him and asked him.<eos> - Oh, yeah. - Mm-hmm. - You didn't Want to know.<eos> No, I did not want to know.<eos> No. No, and now I do.
He's got hours on us.<eos> I've heard nothing conclusive.<eos> What about Mason and Korsten's motive?<eos> I'll find out.<eos> Well, when that time comes, we'll know whether<eos> - to drop our other two suspects.<eos> - With all due respect, sir, there are no other suspects.<eos> - Korsten has the polonium.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
What kind of mask?<eos> He was pretty shaken, so we didn't press.<eos> We'll get a full statement from him once he's been treated.<eos> Where is he?<eos> At the hospital in Woodbury.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Trooper Collins. Go.<eos> We need to talk to that driver.<eos> I tried to stop.<eos> I did.
Uh, sure.<eos> So, um...<eos> I talked to Callie...<eos> And?<eos> And you were right... she's totally cool with us.<eos> - So...<eos> - So...<eos> You want to go out with me?<eos> I mean, if you're into the whole French cowboy thing...<eos> Of, course, I do.
I'm never gonna choose anyone over you.<eos> Okay?<eos> You know, the entire time that we went out, all you did was yank me around.<eos> I was understanding... I was patient.<eos> I did everything that you ever asked me to do...<eos> Just for you to dump me.<eos> Now you're not gonna let Mariana date me either?<eos> I already told Mariana, if you two want to date, I don't have any rights to stand in your way. Okay?<eos> - You're right.<eos> You don't! - No.
Daemons, they call them.<eos> They perform action without user interaction.<eos> Monitoring, logging, notifications.<eos> Primal urges, repressed memories, unconscious habits.<eos> They're always there, always active.<eos> We can try to be right, we can try to be good.<eos> We can try to make a difference, but it's all bullshit.<eos> 'Cause intentions are irrelevant.<eos> They don't drive us.<eos> Daemons do.
You don't think it's a little, well... - Quick?<eos> Fast?<eos> Rushed?<eos> Hasty?<eos> We want to get married before Jack finishes his training.<eos> Because, after that, you could be stationed anywhere. Yes, sir.<eos> - Fighting in any number of possible conflict areas.<eos> I understand your concern.<eos> It's not that we don't like you, Jack.<eos> We do, very much.
Why don't we have a look at my old wedding dress?<eos> That not too hot?<eos> Stan.<eos> Is it not too hot? - No.<eos> This, ladies, is notification of a £5 fine for the Institute's failure to obtain a Tea and Biscuit Licence.<eos> Since when was it necessary to have a licence for tea and biscuits?<eos> The war will shortly require each of us to have a licence for breathing in and another for breathing out.<eos> £5 seems remarkably steep.<eos> You'd think the authorities would have more important fish to fry than frying us over this. You would.<eos> And they do.
I'm told Pat was quite brilliant.<eos> She's...<eos> She fell off a chair, hanging a picture yesterday, and it seems to have taken more out of her than we initially thought, so...<eos> I'm so sorry to hear that.<eos> Oh, Pat, there you are, you poor thing!<eos> I was just hearing about your accident.<eos> I'll just say hello and then I'll leave you both in peace.<eos> I thought you liked me. I do.<eos> - I thought we had a lovely time the other day.<eos> We did.
All German cities suffered the same.<eos> After first blasting a town to splinters, the Allied bombers quickly returned in the hope of catching survivors and rescuers in the open and igniting with fire bombs all that remained.<eos> When the roaring bombers released their lethal cargo, a veritable rain of fire descended upon a targeted town.<eos> The thousands of small fires would join together to form one huge blaze, creating an intense vortex of wind and flames. Kate Hoffmeister:<eos> I struggled to run against the wind in the middle of the street.<eos> We couldn't go on across because the asphalt had melted.<eos> There were people on the roadway, some already dead, some still lying alive but stuck in the asphalt.<eos> They were on their hands and knees screaming.<eos> Some miraculously survived the inferno, reaching safety in rivers, canals and parks.<eos> Thousands more, however, did not.
Nothing.<eos> For once, absolutely nothing.<eos> My family's coming...<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> You're gonna get to meet them.<eos> But do they know about me?<eos> No, not yet, 'cause the reporter's gotta talk to them first and make sure it's safe.<eos> But...<eos> They'll love you.<eos> Just like I do.
You must be so thrilled.<eos> Thanks for seeing me on short notice.<eos> Hey, happy to do it.<eos> I remember you from... the Justice Department.<eos> You made...<eos> - Quite a few headlines.<eos> - Well, this is another one.<eos> Right, Odelle Ballard.<eos> - You have information?<eos> - I do.
Shall we walk?<eos> Such a tragedy, don't you agree?<eos> So, why are we talking?<eos> You're a valuable asset, Peter.<eos> You're smart, resourceful.<eos> How you took down a Goliath organization<eos> - like SOC...<eos> - I've got good aim.<eos> Precisely why I want to keep you.<eos> No, you don't.
Tsk tsk tsk.<eos> You're going around selling Bibles?<eos> I need to find my friend, Carl.<eos> I don't know where he is, I swear.<eos> Hmm.<eos> He send anyone else in here buying Bibles?<eos> Um... a girl.<eos> Uh, she's in her 20s... brown hair, pretty.<eos> And you wouldn't know where I could find this pretty girl, would you?<eos> No, I don't.
You are gonna make a huge impression.<eos> I'm so happy you're coming!<eos> Mm. Did you know that frida's original furniture<eos> -Is still in her bedroom?<eos> -Mm-hmm.<eos> And her tehuana dresses.<eos> You're gonna love them.<eos> What is your guys' obsession with frida kahlo?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> I never did.
Oh, my gosh.<eos> I'm gonna look so cute!<eos> Is that Chris Pratt?<eos> Is he coming to the after party tonight?<eos> It's nobody.<eos> No Layla tonight?<eos> Jeff wanted the focus to be all on you... right where it should be.<eos> Damn straight.<eos> Kick ass tonight.<eos> I always do.
Well, the ceremony is about to begin.<eos> -Lovely to meet you. -Nice to meet you.<eos> Take care.<eos> Wow. I mean, I think his heart's in the right place, but he really shouldn't be saying "ethnic" that much. Mm-mm.<eos> What is the real race breakdown of your previous dudes?<eos> Uh, white, white, white, white, half-Asian, then you.<eos> Whoa, so that half-Asian guy, he was kind of a gateway drug to me?<eos> I guess so.<eos> Who knows what will be next?<eos> I do.
Then you are in luck, my man.<eos> 'Cause this truck... Is good for selling a whole lot more than just chicken.<eos> Hey, Billy.<eos> I was surprised to get your call.<eos> Yeah, well, I know what a fan you are of surprises.<eos> Well, I'm eager to hear what was so urgent.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> You know, I thought that we were gonna be friends, Hap.<eos> I really did.
In the wake of princess Emily's tragic passing last night, president Grant regrets that his duties will prevent him from attending senator Grant's swearing-in today.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to support and defend the constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic...<eos> So, you're saying the president is definitely not going to the first lady's swearing-in?<eos> Asked and answered, Carol.<eos> That you take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion...<eos> I want to be sure that's your official statement.<eos> If you didn't catch it, you can always borrow someone else's notes after class.<eos> And that you will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which you are about to enter,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
Take this.<eos> Hurry up!<eos> They're coming!<eos> We were good together.<eos> - We were trouble.<eos> - Go on!<eos> Six bullets, just what I left William.<eos> I should've died.<eos> I should've died, not her.<eos> Well, you didn't for a reason.
Believe it or not, I don't even really like cameras.<eos> - I prefer my life undocumented.<eos> - Liar.<eos> I'm a very rare species.<eos> I am difficult to capture.<eos> You're running around here half naked.<eos> Just be what you are.<eos> Hmm? You're an exhibitionist.<eos> You like to be looked at.<eos> - Oh. - You do.
No.<eos> No.<eos> - We could probably do it quietly.<eos> - No, I'm not doing that.<eos> This is not happening.<eos> This is one time.<eos> It's never gonna happen again.<eos> Neither is this.<eos> That never happens again.<eos> Fucking done.
She had one foot out the door, man.<eos> She had enough of my shit.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Ah, you know.<eos> Usual stuff... money.<eos> Neither one of us ever back down from a fucking argument.<eos> She fights harder than I do.<eos> Let me ask you a question.<eos> - Do you love her?<eos> - I do.
First from the groom.<eos> What the hell kind of bullshit stunt was that, Danny?<eos> Why'd you even show up?<eos> - Just get lost.<eos> - Four minutes later,<eos> Dana Sloan, sister of the bride, rang.<eos> Danny, oh, my god.<eos> I swear, you've ruined everything.<eos> Call me.<eos> Actually, don't.
I like being self-employed.<eos> That's a mistake!<eos> Have you visited the Imperial City?<eos> The emperors' tombs are impressive.<eos> - Tombs?<eos> - Yes.<eos> No, I haven't seen them.<eos> I'm so busy.<eos> Stupid, I don't have time to see much.<eos> - I don't...
You are going to modify the dat file put Colby's IP in there.<eos> You do that, you have set in motion the largest revolution the world will ever see.<eos> Sources have confirmed the hacks were in part tied to Colby's terminal.<eos> Sir, step inside the car.<eos> Bon soir, Elliot.<eos> "Give a man a gun and he can rob a bank, but give a man a bank, and he can rob the world."<eos> It's a bit of a silly expression, actually.<eos> A little reductive, but still...<eos> I like it, for the same reason most people hate it, because to me it means that power belongs to the people that take it.<eos> Nothing to do with their hard work, strong ambitions, or rightful qualifications, no.
Very close.<eos> He was my best friend.<eos> Worked at Evil Corp his whole life.<eos> He was one of the best computer engineers they had.<eos> And out of the blue, he got fired.<eos> No one knew why.<eos> Then one day he told me.<eos> He had leukemia.<eos> Made me swear to never tell anyone, especially my mom.<eos> So I didn't.
Hey, don't do that.<eos> No, no, no, no, this is crazy.<eos> This is crazy. Uh...<eos> Take a walk around the block and go cool your loins, okay?<eos> See? That's why I need you.<eos> Because you say annoying stuff like that, Danny.<eos> You make me a better person, and I make you a better person.<eos> No, no, no, no, no, no, you don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Okay, Mindy?<eos> Just do me a favor.
I'm the talent, you know?<eos> I probably shouldn't be hearing this shit anyways.<eos> Hello?<eos> You are so fucking hot.<eos> What?<eos> I'm looking at pictures from the shoot this morning.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> I look good?<eos> Well, I haven't gotten dressed yet, If that tells you anything.<eos> Yes, it does.
- allowing us to enter your...<eos> - No. Absolutely not.<eos> I discussed this thoroughly with my wife last night.<eos> I don't know why you guys are trying to intimidate us, but you are not coming into our house.<eos> Well, since you're still on the fence about it, what do you say we play a little game?<eos> You answer no to our questions, we'll all go away.<eos> What questions?<eos> Does your wife drink mint tea?<eos> D... w-what if... what if she does?<eos> A lot of people do.
In your terms, my last will and testament.<eos> - How does it work?<eos> - I've no idea.<eos> Well, thank you anyway.<eos> Rigsy, your neck.<eos> Clara, what are you playing at?<eos> The chronolock!<eos> Take the teleport off him first!<eos> I don't have it, I'm telling you.<eos> Clara does!
- I've no idea.<eos> Well, thank you anyway.<eos> Rigsy, your neck.<eos> Clara, what are you playing at?<eos> The chronolock!<eos> Take the teleport off him first!<eos> I don't have it, I'm telling you.<eos> Clara does!<eos> No...<eos> No, you didn't.
Rigsy, your neck.<eos> Clara, what are you playing at?<eos> The chronolock!<eos> Take the teleport off him first!<eos> I don't have it, I'm telling you.<eos> Clara does!<eos> No...<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Go on, then. Take it off.<eos> Clara, you didn't...!
I did this, do you hear me?<eos> I did this.<eos> This was my fault.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> - Liar.<eos> You always care. Always have.<eos> Your reign of terror will end<eos> - with the sight of the first crying child and you know it.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> I do.
I guess we're both just going to have to be brave.<eos> Clara...<eos> Everything you are about to say, I already know.<eos> Don't do it now.<eos> We've already had enough bad timing.<eos> Don't run.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Nah.<eos> You stay here.<eos> In the end, everybody does this alone.
- Yeah, sort of.<eos> - Darling, shall we pop back indoors?<eos> - Yeah, good idea.<eos> '.. four, three, two, one.'<eos> Indestructible as ever.<eos> Married the diamond(! )<eos> Hello?<eos> Sir...<eos> - .. the ship, it came down, did you see it?<eos> - Yes, I did.
No.<eos> Just the wind.<eos> Nothing's ever just the wind.<eos> No?<eos> It blows through the cave system and harmonises with the crystal layer.<eos> Why are you sad?<eos> Why are YOU sad?<eos> I told you, my diary's nearly full.<eos> I worry.<eos> Please don't.
(Jenna) The only thing I cared about circulating was enough alcohol through my system to deal with the guilt of lying all evening.<eos> Boo, bitch! [giggles]<eos> You have to get down on this three-bean salad.<eos> It is my jam.<eos> Gabby, so, um, I'm just curious.<eos> That thing you were talking about earlier, about Matty?<eos> Oh.<eos> You want to know the secret?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do I?
See, it's that face right there.<eos> Why are you so unsupportive of them?<eos> It's your best friend in love with my best friend.<eos> - Because she's not!<eos> - Okay. What do you mean?<eos> - Why would you say that?<eos> - Because it's the truth, Brian.<eos> They had this fun little thing in Mexico, and she got carried away and agreed to marry him because she thought he'd be shipping off before she ever had to go through with it, and she got all caught in these wedding details,<eos> Jenna.<eos> She never did.
I figured you for a mama's boy.<eos> One slap, and you spit out the info.<eos> It's been a good run, kid.<eos> Now, let's just get to the end.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay.<eos> You win.<eos> Nobody treats me like that and lives.<eos> Do you even know who the hell I am?<eos> Do you? !
I hope you like them.<eos> Enjoy them while they're hot.<eos> Oh, your needle.<eos> I suppose we should discuss the poison.<eos> Poison?<eos> You're not the first Castithan concubine that has attempted to murder me.<eos> Your people know nothing about my physiology, and that's exactly the way I like it.<eos> I have lived for many, many centuries, and the longer my people live, the more difficult we are to kill.<eos> So why do you want me dead?<eos> Actually, I don't.
The truth.<eos> I have failed.<eos> Will you try again?<eos> Do I have any chance of success?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> What shall you do?<eos> In my entire life, no man has ever made a meal for me.<eos> I feel I should thank you.<eos> You know whose badge that is.<eos> Of course I do.
How were we supposed to know?<eos> It's not like we run background checks on all her boyfriends.<eos> Well, we have to start.<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> - Make nice with that guy?<eos> - You have to.<eos> But... why don't we just send them all home?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Then you tell Daphne why you have a problem with Larry 'cause you're the one who said you didn't want the kids to know about our financial problems.<eos> No. I don't.
I don't know if he's alive.<eos> He would've shown me by now.<eos> That's what Michonne said.<eos> I just want to see his face.<eos> I can't.<eos> I don't get to know what will happen.<eos> I won't get to know why it happened, what I did right or wrong.<eos> Not now.<eos> I have to live with that.<eos> You do, too.
Why haven't I killed anybody?<eos> Because if I did, there'd be no going back.<eos> There'd be no going back to how things were.<eos> I'm from a place where people are still like they were... more or less, better or worse.<eos> I can walk it from here.<eos> Till we meet up with my friends.<eos> They got a car.<eos> You can ride with them.<eos> How many friends you say there were?<eos> I didn't.
You okay?<eos> Yeah. I'm not gonna have to fuck him, am I?<eos> No.<eos> You don't have to fuck him.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So... Now what?<eos> He wants to see you fight.<eos> But I thought he loved me.<eos> He does.
You got to take somebody else.<eos> Okay, well, should I kick her out of my house?<eos> That's between you.<eos> What was your name again?<eos> Jay. - You know that.<eos> - Jay.<eos> Don't try and diminish me.<eos> Let me ask you something.<eos> Do you think Laura wants a relationship with you?<eos> - Yes, I do.

- Yes.<eos> You're not selling?<eos> I meant in general.<eos> Let's get your stuff.<eos> I'll say hi.<eos> Miracles don't happen.<eos> I won't argue, but you're making a mistake.<eos> I can get you an appointment.<eos> - I don't want that.<eos> - You don't?
Who are these men?<eos> The Knights Rosula, a clandestine order under the charge of the archdeacon of Windsor.<eos> They believe Annora and others like her pose a threat to the Church.<eos> That is why Robinus was here, not to examine accounts, but to start the search for Annora.<eos> What possible threat could a gentle, aged woman present to the Church?<eos> She has ancient documents in her possession that cast doubt upon the Church's most significant teachings.<eos> I find it difficult to believe that a man as pious as Archdeacon Robinus would endanger the life of a child.<eos> But we must meet Robinus and his Rosula to find out if it is indeed a harsh truth or the delusion of a potion maker.<eos> You do not think it is a delusion.<eos> I do not, my lady.
If this is but another deception, kill the boy.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Ruskin to be witness to the pain he caused.<eos> Then kill the heretical priest as well.<eos> Yes, master.<eos> I hope one of those burn for me.<eos> Are you in need of prayers, Sir Brattle?<eos> From the moment my eyes open till they close again with sleep.<eos> Do you truly believe the vision we shared was that of our child's birth?<eos> I do.
- Tammy...<eos> Remember we went to that sweet little shop in Venice and we tried, like, 12 different cakes?<eos> Remember, honey, we fell in love with this?<eos> Sarah, okay?<eos> Just calm down.<eos> - I have a beautiful soul.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> I have the soul of a warrior!<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - I do!
- I got drunk. I'm allowed to get drunk.<eos> And according to you, everything I do is wrong anyway.<eos> - Didn't say that... - And I should blame myself.<eos> Well, I do. I blame myself.<eos> I'm the last person who walked away and left her here to live like this.<eos> Happy?<eos> I left her first.<eos> She was depending on me, and I got on that bus, and I left her here.<eos> So I know how you feel.<eos> [Crying] No, you don't.
Hey, you need a ride, Gunnar?<eos> Oh, I'm good.<eos> Thanks, man. Uh, Jesse's giving me a ride.<eos> - All right.<eos> - I'll see you.<eos> Hey, uh, before you go, I just want to say...<eos> I had a really great time.<eos> I mean, it worked.<eos> We worked.<eos> Of course we did.
How are you, Ryan?<eos> Oh, I'm all right.<eos> Take care of yourself.<eos> Agent Booth.<eos> Glad to see you're still with us.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Do you have any idea who shot you?<eos> Did you see their face?<eos> Yes, I did.
♪ I'm in the sky ♪<eos> ♪ Thoughts are like pearls ♪<eos> ♪ And flags are unfurled ♪<eos> ♪ Because you're mine, mine, mine ♪<eos> ♪ Because you're mine ♪<eos> Why are your clothes still on?<eos> I thought we had a deal.<eos> You know, if you want to be a good FBI agent, you're gonna have to learn how to lie better.<eos> You didn't have a date tonight with Brandon... o-or anybody, I figure.<eos> No, I didn't.
That's normal.<eos> Not when you hide in the bathroom to do it.<eos> You don't have a boyfriend.<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> - Oh, you want to talk about hiding? What's the file in your... none of your business.<eos> Well, great.<eos> Get your hands off me.<eos> Look, it's okay.<eos> We both said things we didn't mean.<eos> Yeah, and some things we kind of did.
Okay, you can tell me!<eos> All right, you following me right now.<eos> How's that?<eos> Okay, that's not an answer!<eos> All right, does it...<eos> does it make me creepy that I notice that you get up every time Alex leaves a room?<eos> Or that you go on long runs in the woods by yourself?<eos> Or that you somehow seem to know this campus like the back of your hand... that's creepy!<eos> You really want to know what's creepy? !<eos> - Yes, I do!
We've... we've taken bullets.<eos> We put everything on the line for her.<eos> For you when you needed it the most.<eos> Where were you when we needed the same?<eos> Huh? No, I'll tell you where.<eos> Hiding behind those monitors.<eos> - Shelby, please. - No.<eos> This morning, we said we weren't gonna make any more choices that we regret.<eos> So I hope that you can live with this, Alex.<eos> I really do.
I am just preparing you for a lifetime of men who are gonna try to get away from you fast.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> Okay, the longer we stand here chatting, the longer it's gonna take us to get back on the road.<eos> So, Sue, you're up.<eos> Have at it.<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Yeah, what?<eos> Sue's gonna change the tire.<eos> If she does it the way I taught her, it shouldn't take long.<eos> It did.
Because if the coins are stolen, there's no account.<eos> Who do you want to win, the government or us?<eos> There is no us.<eos> I'm here on behalf of DeGraaf's.<eos> Do you really want to see that couple break up?<eos> Oh, please. Do you expect me to believe you actually care about them?<eos> I care about the account, and we're running out of time.<eos> Do you have anything useful?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> - No, you don't.
I didn't get any time off when my dog had puppies.<eos> - You took two weeks off.<eos> - I only needed one.<eos> I totally get it.<eos> I recently missed an important lunch because I was admiring a butter-yellow dandelion that had forced its way through a pavement crack.<eos> That's a weird new attitude.<eos> Yeah, Dr. Reed's been in a real good mood since he started getting it on the reg.<eos> On the reg with Whitney?<eos> Well... She knows you're going out, right?<eos> Indeed she does, Danny.
Are you asking me out?<eos> Yes, but as pretend, so don't get... [yells]<eos> - This is my first ask-out. - Really?<eos> Congratulations, because you got yourself a boyfriend!<eos> All right, yes!<eos> No!<eos> After a long day of being a Modern Mominista, there's no better reward than your hubby's appreciation.<eos> Welcome, my beautiful breadwinner.<eos> Wow. Place looks great.<eos> - Doesn't it?
And she works for you, right?<eos> What do I need to do to keep this quiet?<eos> You know what I want.<eos> Fine, they're right... you're dangerous.<eos> I'm dangerous.<eos> But that's not who you are.<eos> You...<eos> You're wrong.<eos> - I know the real you, Lincoln, and you...<eos> - You don't.
Even if she is, Rio isn't.<eos> He's played this thing pretty well so far.<eos> There's no way he would let her know where he is.<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's riding around L.A. in a convertible like a tourist.<eos> Is he?<eos> Or is he meeting contacts at places where it's just very easy to blend in?<eos> Might've planned this whole thing out.<eos> I doubt he planned on getting arrested in Singapore.<eos> Nobody does.
And I'm Molly Ringwald!<eos> Open the door, Rio.<eos> That's not my name!<eos> Well, it's one of 'em.<eos> I'll give you each fifty thousand dollars!<eos> We're federal agents!<eos> Okay, how about, uh, a hundred thousand dollars each?<eos> Open the door!<eos> I have a gun.<eos> No, you don't.
Did you talk to him?<eos> Nope. He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So you talked to him, but not with you boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?
Nope. He wasn't home.<eos> Well, I'm here.<eos> I want to talk to you about everything, just not tonight, okay?<eos> So you talked to him, but not with you boyfriend?<eos> It's different, Ollie.<eos> Both of our parents died because...<eos> That's how we know each other.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this right now.<eos> What if I do?<eos> What if you do what?
Hey.<eos> That motherfucker George Bush, sent us over to Iraq in '91.<eos> 82nd airborne division.<eos> I remember that first push. We're going through Boswa. We was tripping.<eos> I get hit by this sniper.<eos> Motherfucker tagged me from behind.<eos> Took out my lower spine.<eos> Love you, guys.<eos> My wife... she was so ashamed of having a husband that the stank bitch didn't even show up to Fort Brag when they sent my ass home.<eos> But Melvin did.
Someone needs to call them out on it.<eos> But it's a lot to ask of kids who could suffer the consequences.<eos> Maybe you need to find some kids that have less to lose.<eos> It's so great to work for clients I like for a change.<eos> That's nice of you to say that.<eos> Well, it's true.<eos> I mean, you've got a beautiful home, a beautiful family.<eos> And your partner Stef... what a great gal, huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I really lucked out in the wife department.<eos> Yeah, you really did.
Will you hand me one of those cuvettes over there?<eos> - Uh, which one?<eos> - The-the square tube with the lid on it.<eos> I didn't hate the patients.<eos> I just... hated their pain.<eos> Their tears.<eos> And their families' tears.<eos> You shut down your emotions for long enough, you don't want to spend all day with somebody else's.<eos> Does it bother you when I talk about my mother?<eos> It did.
What?<eos> That is reason to book my travel to Clearwater, Florida.<eos> - You sure you can handle this?<eos> - I can fly a cargo plane.<eos> I've done it before.<eos> You can say it, you know.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - "I told you so."<eos> You don't need me to tell you that getting involved with Ray was a bad idea... you know that on your own.<eos> I do.
to know, and then have a bunch of baggage about it, because it's my baggage and I'm dealing with it.<eos> _<eos> I do enjoy being with you.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I wanna stay.<eos> _<eos> Positive.<eos> I have those feelings too sometimes.<eos> You do?
One of my students was there. Was, uh...<eos> Hey, professor.<eos> Where you been?<eos> ...transfer student.<eos> He only started a few weeks ago.<eos> Had two men with him.<eos> You know, my experience is limited, but I'd say they were professionals.<eos> It was Hydra.<eos> Don't know why they'd be after me.<eos> - I do.
- Ask who?<eos> Anyone.<eos> The dean, your professor, someone from your family.<eos> Nobody in my family went to college!<eos> My mom didn't understand what I was going through, my aunt or my cousin, nobody.<eos> I used to walk around that fancy campus and think, what am I doing here?<eos> My mom works at a box store.<eos> Who cares what your mom does for a living?<eos> You did deserve to be there.<eos> You do.
- We need money.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Dad left.<eos> - What do you mean, just gone?<eos> He left. And Mom wants to go find Dad in American states.<eos> And we need money for boat tickets and a bribe for the visas.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> This shit is fascinating.<eos> Did you know there is such a thing as inherited trauma in your actual DNA?<eos> No, I did not.
You don't know how many times I almost told you.<eos> I just ...<eos> I didn't know how.<eos> - I didn't ask for this.<eos> - Oh, god.<eos> What have you done?<eos> - Melinda, don't...<eos> - Unh! Let me go!<eos> Don't do that!<eos> I don't ...
One of my men cut it off.<eos> Saved my life.<eos> By chopping off your hand?<eos> You kind of had to be there.<eos> - Does it hurt?<eos> - Every day.<eos> Phantom pain.<eos> The thing that's missing is the thing that you feel the most.<eos> - Makes it hard to forget.<eos> - So maybe you don't.
I never knew why you married me.<eos> I was never as...<eos> kind and empathetic as you.<eos> That's why it was so easy for me to walk away why I gave up on you.<eos> I lost something when I left you.<eos> I won't do it again.<eos> But you have to stop this.<eos> Melinda...<eos> How'd you know that wouldn't kill him?<eos> I didn't.
No. I've been looking into this organization for two years now.<eos> All dead ends.<eos> But what I did manage to dig up tracks with what we know about Darhk's Ghosts.<eos> They're H.I.V.E.<eos> Do Oliver and Felicity know?<eos> No.<eos> You've been investigating this for two years and you haven't told them?<eos> It's a family thing, Laurel.<eos> I would think you, of all people, would understand keeping secrets when it comes to the death of a sibling.<eos> I do.
I don't know what it is you're doing.<eos> I need a floor plan, Christine.<eos> Or why you think you can come to me, but I need this job.<eos> I promise this will never get back to you.<eos> But the next time that bastard demands personal services, at least you'll know you screwed him a little, too.<eos> I... I, uh...<eos> I didn't know where else to go.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I shouldn't have come here.<eos> But you did.
Brazil.<eos> Any particular reason you chose Brazil?<eos> I know where you're going with this, and, yes, we...<eos> When that picture of Kevin in Rio popped up on the Internet, we had to go look for ourselves.<eos> So, that boy in Brazil, to you, could've been Kevin.<eos> Maybe. It...<eos> It's possible we saw what we wanted to see.<eos> I have one last far-fetched question, but<eos> - we have to ask.<eos> - No, we don't. No, we don't.
See how hard your dad works to earn money.<eos> So when you grow up, you will be honoring your daddy.<eos> Ready?<eos> Yes.<eos> Now, fight!<eos> Why are you just standing like that?<eos> Like a man, come on.<eos> Director if you don't play good, your contract will be gone.<eos> What you guys doing in front of a child?<eos> Director, nicely done.
- You wait until I'm bound for a war on an aircraft carrier, and then you get swept off to some far-flung planet.<eos> With him.<eos> Top-marks pilot astronaut hero man.<eos> - I would do anything ...<eos> - Do you love him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
With him.<eos> Top-marks pilot astronaut hero man.<eos> - I would do anything ...<eos> - Do you love him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I think...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.<eos> Of course you do.
Ah, what the heck?<eos> Congratulations, Milhouse.<eos> You made it through adolescence and you're cuter than ever.<eos> Oh, sweet Lisa!<eos> You know I had a rocky childhood with all the rocks they threw at me.<eos> You're the most amazing thing at this party.<eos> Well, excuse me!<eos> I'm not even the best Simpson at my best friend's party!<eos> Do you know what it's like to be second-best at anything?<eos> Yeah, I do!
Afraid that they might murder me?<eos> I don't care.<eos> At least then you would be free.<eos> She would have nothing to hold over you.<eos> What if I don't want to?<eos> Don't want to?<eos> You have no idea what it is like, Cotton, to be filled with ideas, with dreams, with visions of how things should be, and yet be utterly powerless to do anything about them.<eos> That is what it is to be a woman.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Of course you don't.
- It's an apology.<eos> Well, and it's an admission of guilt.<eos> You know, if you were Avery, would you want to hear anything that Darius has to say right now?<eos> My son got the crap kicked out of him when he was a boy just for being gay.<eos> No one ever apologized to him.<eos> Darius McCrae wrote something for me?<eos> He did.<eos> He wanted to apologize.<eos> You don't have to read it if you don't want to.<eos> No, I do.
Bassam! Stop!<eos> I warned you, I'll kill her.<eos> Oh, my... my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Morning.<eos> So... we, um...<eos> Drank Chinese whiskey.<eos> And then?<eos> We didn't...?
You have.<eos> Some people call that growing up. I call it growing old.<eos> Once you let fun go, you never get it back.<eos> Over and above everything and anybody... .. I choose fun.<eos> It's for you.<eos> Not here!<eos> - What is it?<eos> - It's the impossible.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> I didn't.
They haven't even been cleared for field duty.<eos> I cleared them just now.<eos> Seems I might just get my team after all.<eos> Listen up!<eos> Hydra has Fitz and Simmons, and they're planning to open another portal!<eos> Which is why we're going to stop them.<eos> - Yeah, but why us?<eos> - I'm guessing we're all they've got.<eos> You two have powers.<eos> My other agents don't.
You saw what I did to her.<eos> She's not gonna want to help us.<eos> It's not about helping us. It's about helping her client.<eos> I can't ask her to do that.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I can't.<eos> - Harvey, what's going on?<eos> - Nothing's going on.<eos> How did you know those things about her in that deposition?<eos> Because I did.
I did.<eos> And I shouldn't have been so standoffish with you In the file room.<eos> Well, maybe I shouldn't have had that be Our first interaction.<eos> No, that's not on you.<eos> That's on me.<eos> I never welcomed you to the firm, and I should have.<eos> You know, when I was a young mother, First week of school, every day I dropped my little girl off.<eos> When I left, she cried.<eos> Friday came, I left, she didn't cry.<eos> So I did.
Patrol went into the tunnel.<eos> They found vinyl auto skins on the road way.<eos> They pulled a fast one on us.<eos> Oh, so now Theo Davis is in a van that could be any color, any logo.<eos> He's in the wind without his meds, the takers don't have their money...<eos> You just signed his death warrant.<eos> Put the bag man in the box and get him talking.<eos> I don't appreciate your tone.<eos> You want to know what I don't appreciate?<eos> We really don't.
She's supposed to get bumped up to Deputy Inspector.<eos> She picks out her new office, plans herself a party, gets loaded, tells half the precinct what she really thinks of 'em.<eos> Then the promotion falls through.<eos> Epic.<eos> That's why.<eos> Why she's so unbearable?<eos> That's why she's willing to drive an hour to work.<eos> She was humiliated.<eos> There's no one in our precinct who knows what happened to her.<eos> - But if they did...
- What?<eos> - I'll allow it.<eos> I grind.<eos> - You grind.<eos> - I grind.<eos> Grinder, Grinder, Grinder, Grinder... It sounds like The Grinder has worked his magic again.<eos> The Ramirezes are going to be able to stay in their apartment.<eos> And so the hero makes his way out of town.<eos> Why do you have to go, Uncle Dean?<eos> - I just do.
- Feel better?<eos> 'Commander Nagata.<eos> 'Young, for the responsibility.<eos> 'Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid.'<eos> Marvellous, ma'am.<eos> All hail, Morpheus, eh?<eos> 'Deep-Ando.<eos> Conscript.<eos> 'Likes to think of himself as the joker of this little group.<eos> 'Well... he DID...'
That does not end.<eos> That never ends.<eos> It just rips a hole inside of you that never closes.<eos> Your child is dead!<eos> You can visit his grave, bring him flowers.<eos> You know exactly where he is and what he is.<eos> My child is breathing and talking right down the block from me at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, but I can't see him.<eos> I don't know how he is or what he needs or if he's even okay.<eos> He's surrounded by vultures who want to pick the flesh from his bones, but he doesn't know it.<eos> And I do.
What does that have to do with anything?<eos> Wait, before you answer, I need you to revoke your rights.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I-I revoke.<eos> I have excellent health insurance.<eos> Hamilton/Lookwood allows me to see any doctor I want with extremely low deductibles, and the prescription plan is awesome.<eos> Anything else?<eos> You said the promotion you missed came with stock options and a bonus of?<eos> The entire package was worth almost $2 million, but I don't know how that's relevant because I didn't get it.<eos> No, you didn't.
Now you can stand.<eos> All a man needs is a sword and one good hand.<eos> You've got both, so pick it up.<eos> Look, t-this is useless.<eos> If she wants me to pull Excalibur, then... then let me try.<eos> When I fail, she can move on.<eos> When you fail, there's no moving on.<eos> You turn to dust.<eos> What do you care what happens to me?<eos> I don't!
What is she up to?<eos> Well, given our missing memories,<eos> I'd wager whatever it is, it's not good.<eos> Let's take a better look at the damn thing and find out.<eos> Stop!<eos> I can't believe I'm about to say this, but it could be booby-trapped.<eos> You could get killed.<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't know you cared.<eos> I don't.
But it is a shame.<eos> It would be nice to have the whole family together.<eos> Has anyone heard from Nate?<eos> Why would you tell Jenna that you kissed me?<eos> You know why we broke up, right?<eos> I finally told her that the reason I'm having a hard time falling in love with her is because I've already... fallen in love with somebody else.<eos> - With you.<eos> - Yeah, I-I got that.<eos> Hey, I know it's not okay. I know.<eos> You don't...
So sue me.<eos> You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff because I wasn't worried about it then,<eos> - but I am now.<eos> - Mike--<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
I want you to reconsider our settlement offer.<eos> And what makes you think we're going to accept the same deal that you brought us before?<eos> Because I've sat across from you, and I know that you care about more than just the fight.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but that fight's gonna end with Alyssa Lang going to prison.<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't have to.<eos> And the only reason it's gonna end that way is because that deal is coming from me.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to believe a word you say?<eos> What do you want me to say, huh?<eos> That I got tired of playing the goon?<eos> Because I did.
We'll let you come with us.<eos> You're in charge of making fires though.<eos> Kid!<eos> Can you hear us? !<eos> Send a smoke signal!<eos> I'm going across.<eos> You won't make it.<eos> We have to get him.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Ain't that right, Dale?<eos> Oh you right about that.<eos> You're both right.<eos> Cuz it ain't everyday you come in contact with a modern miracle<eos> Your maker's been smiling on you because today I offer you the most rare and precious of currencies.<eos> Everlasting life.<eos> What's he talking about?<eos> Well... if you're interested... we've got<eos> You got a stuttering problem? !<eos> Well yes he does.
They're getting close!<eos> Thank you.<eos> For what?<eos> We still haven't gotten you laid.<eos> For everything else, then.<eos> Coulda, shoulda<eos> You know they got a name for that.<eos> Yeah, well if we can't be self-critical, there's no room for self-improvement.<eos> Who said that?<eos> I did.
You got it.<eos> Multiple lacerations.<eos> And based on the number and depth, significant overkill, maybe even rage.<eos> Bertie.<eos> Crane? Deep wounds.<eos> Bold.<eos> No fear of being caught.<eos> Exsanguination.<eos> You recognize this M.O.?<eos> I do.
Trust me.<eos> All that hard work and now we're back to square one.<eos> Just wait till Moorefield hears this.<eos> He's been whoring himself out to a couple of halfwits.<eos> Button the pig's sash and let's go.<eos> Forgive me, Rachel.<eos> This must be the strangest thing you've ever done.<eos> Oh, not even this week, Your Majesty.<eos> You think you're going to get away with this?<eos> Yes, I do.
We can't be normal, we never will be, but some days we can just disappear for a while, you know?<eos> Fade into the music and the high and pretend we're not the people we always will be.<eos> I promised Dad I'd avenge him.<eos> I know you did.<eos> But this anger, Liam, this quest for vengeance...<eos> I don't think Dad would want that for you.<eos> And would he want me hanging out on a boat getting high?<eos> He'd want you to be happy.<eos> I know you miss him.<eos> I do, too.
I guess I hit the wrong guy.<eos> Hell yeah, you did.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - Not really.<eos> I think we just broke up.<eos> Riley, everything is gonna be okay.<eos> Ross is just some guy you dated.<eos> He's not the one.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> - I just do.
He was my mentor, actually.<eos> So my doppelganger, a man who looks exactly like me, betrayed you.<eos> I'm sorry, I'm not him, so you need to listen to me when I say you can take care of Zoom, and all we have to do is capture Doctor Light.<eos> I thought about testing the mask for Light's DNA, but it would only have Linda's.<eos> The mask, what mask?<eos> Light's mask.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> Iris shot it off Doctor Light when she attacked Linda.<eos> You know how to use the mask to find Light?<eos> Yes, I do.
Whoever comes for you comes for me.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> She's awake.<eos> Yes.<eos> Whoever comes for me may very well come for you...<eos> But they may also come through you, Marcellus.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I hoped I was wrong, Lucien...<eos> I really did...
Oh, then, please, Niklaus...<eos> Make me like you.<eos> You've had a thousand birthdays since.<eos> If I forgot to send a card, it's because I forgot about you.<eos> Is that why you're here, to remind me?<eos> I am here for the same reason Lucien and Tristan are... to protect my sire.<eos> Now, if you turned me that night like I'd asked, I would be here to protect you, but since you didn't, I need to know where in the hell is Rebekah?<eos> Elijah.<eos> I didn't realize we had a meeting on the books today.<eos> We don't.
This choker scarf, and I only wore it because Josephine did and I thought that maybe if I were more like her, then... then maybe they would respect me.<eos> Here.<eos> You need this more than I do.<eos> You know, Davina, I... I wasn't ok with what you had me do to the Versailles coven...<eos> But I'm guessing that you're not ok with it, either, so you're running from it, pretending to be someone that you're not, someone who you think that they want you to be.<eos> You know what I learned?<eos> No one is gonna respect you until you show them who you really are, so if you're gonna wear old-lady choker scarves...<eos> You're gonna get old-lady goats.<eos> Is that all you got, a hunch?<eos> I don't do hunches.
Hey, Zoey, will you stop texting and answer me?<eos> Oh, I just texted you no.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You've been begging for more lessons for months.<eos> Yeah, but you're not exactly the best teacher.<eos> You get a little yelly.<eos> Yelling is caring.<eos> Resheida:<eos> Oh, yo, Mr. J., did Zoey tell you I've been thinking about that Daddy's Day thing?<eos> No, I did not.
In yourself?<eos> But... so does that mean I'm off the hook?<eos> Dre, I hate guns more than I hate how Levi's fit me.<eos> And I know I don't want guns anywhere near my children, all right?<eos> But somehow I panicked, okay?<eos> And that is how people wind up shot.<eos> That is exactly why we shouldn't have a gun in the house.<eos> Babe, I get it.<eos> And I shouldn't want one, either, especially after what just happened.<eos> But I do.
we're speaking culturally.<eos> Culturally.<eos> Oh, my goodness gracious.<eos> This is... this is so embarrassing.<eos> It really is.<eos> We have been so presumptuous.<eos> Oh, well.<eos> Of course you have your own culturally specific church.<eos> Yes.<eos> Who doesn't?
Get me out of here.<eos> Get me out of here!<eos> Aah!<eos> Oh [bleep]!<eos> Everybody back!<eos> If you're not a parasite, you have nothing to fear.<eos> So what about Summer?<eos> Why am I always your go-to?<eos> - Never go in my room again.<eos> - I didn't!
Geez.<eos> - You all right?<eos> - Uh-huh!<eos> What are you doing, Rick?<eos> I'm pretty sure the battery's dead.<eos> Oh, you think so, huh, Morty?<eos> Well, let's see.<eos> Hey, wait-- huh?<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Of course you don't.
I am so sorry.<eos> Okay, that was crazy!<eos> Just go.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> We're free, we're free!<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> Well, well, looks like birds of a feather... go to jail.<eos> Why was he wearing sunglasses at night?<eos> I hope you folks like community service.<eos> - I do. - What?
and "1-2-3" is "I miss you" and "8-0-0-8-5" is boobs.<eos> What?<eos> Boobs?<eos> Oh, my God. What scamp came up with that one?<eos> Okay, I gotta go.<eos> Dinner tonight?<eos> Totally.<eos> Let's hit that gravy truck.<eos> Okay, love you.<eos> No, I don't.
Boobs?<eos> Oh, my God. What scamp came up with that one?<eos> Okay, I gotta go.<eos> Dinner tonight?<eos> Totally.<eos> Let's hit that gravy truck.<eos> Okay, love you.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Aw... "I love you.<eos> No, I don't"?
- Now get out of my house."<eos> - I don't remember any of that.<eos> Well, anyway, I'm finally moving out, just like you wanted.<eos> Good.<eos> Honestly, you'll probably be better off without me.<eos> Yeah. But we had some good times, though, right?<eos> - Did we? - Right.<eos> Well, um, take care.<eos> Hey, I hope you can find a way to be happy, BoJack.<eos> - I really do.
Yeah, it's, uh... powerful stuff.<eos> But I'm never doing it again.<eos> Any drugs again.<eos> Anika.<eos> You're mom and I are so sorry for everything that's happened.<eos> For being so neglectful.<eos> You guys had your own stuff going on.<eos> I get it.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
So you mean you're cheap? You know what, for someone who won't throw me a sympathy mud,<eos> Louis.<eos> What can I do for you?<eos> You can give me your proxy.<eos> Why would I do that? Because you asked me to bring the compensation issue up<eos> For a vote like a man and I did.<eos> And is Jack Soloff aware of this?<eos> Not only aware of it, he's voting for it.<eos> And however did you get him to do that? Let's just say that you wanted me to do this Like Harvey would have and not like I would have,<eos> But I did the best of both.
So sue me.<eos> You send the notification over to Tanner?<eos> Two hours ago.<eos> Then it won't be long.<eos> What? I didn't say anything about your state of mind after Tim Petroff Because I wasn't worried about it then,<eos> - But I am now.<eos> - Mike...<eos> - What if it doesn't work?<eos> - It'll work.<eos> - And what if it doesn't?
I want you to reconsider our settlement offer.<eos> And what makes you think we're going to accept the same deal That you brought us before?<eos> Because I've sat across from you, And I know that you care about more than just the fight.<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but that fight's gonna end With Alyssa Lang going to prison.<eos> Yeah, but it doesn't have to.<eos> And the only reason it's gonna end that way Is because that deal is coming from me.<eos> How the hell am I supposed to believe a word you say?<eos> What do you want me to say, huh?<eos> That I got tired of playing the goon?<eos> Because I did.
Where's her phone now?<eos> Redmond and Eighth.<eos> What fancy private school did you pick this up in?<eos> I learned it here.<eos> Three years on this island, and I have been hurt every way you can imagine.<eos> I know what kills, I know what cripples, and what just hurts.<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop!<eos> He didn't take the drugs.<eos> I did.
I'm her handler, nobody else.<eos> Second, you get Six to let me see all the files about who I am...<eos> Dmitry, John Cameron, all the legends.<eos> _<eos> Which one of you put gun in my desk?<eos> W-What gun?<eos> It was you, wasn't it?<eos> Yes, it was him.<eos> I have right to kill him.<eos> Yes, you do.
I think you solved this thing so it's time to go back on your meds, okay?<eos> - I'm not a moron.<eos> - Nobody said you were.<eos> You don't think I know what you're doing?<eos> No, no!<eos> No!<eos> I know exactly what you're doing.<eos> I just want you to take your pills like we agreed.<eos> - "Like we agreed."<eos> - Yeah, we did.
We have a green light?<eos> We have a green light.<eos> However, I did neglect to mention your conversation with Etai Luskin.<eos> I'm sure you did.<eos> How detailed is their intelligence, do you think?<eos> They know Assad's in the crosshairs.<eos> They know we have a likely candidate to replace him.<eos> Screw 'em.<eos> As long as they don't know the who and the when.<eos> They don't.
Hello?<eos> CARRIE:<eos> It's me.<eos> What the hell's happening at the Russian embassy?<eos> You heard about that already?<eos> Yeah, it's all over the Internet.<eos> They keep mentioning classified documents... are they the same ones Laura Sutton was writing about last week?<eos> One would assume.<eos> He said as much on the video.<eos> - Who did?
On one condition.<eos> Name it.<eos> None of the hacked documents see the light of day ever again.<eos> They won't.<eos> I swear to you.<eos> Are you talking to anyone else about this?<eos> I told you there is no one else.<eos> I'm counting on you to do this.<eos> And I just told you I would.<eos> You did.
Blood, sweat, and a lot of Danny.<eos> And now, may I offer you a glass of...<eos> I managed to remember the tree house, but actually forgot the wine.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I can't be in a relationship where I'm constantly questioning everything.<eos> I always feel like I'm in second place.<eos> Wait...<eos> Are you breaking up with me?<eos> Because that's not fair!<eos> I didn't do anything wrong!
Can't you see Silky is singing?<eos> Why don't you scurry on back to "The Golden Girls" convention?<eos> I don't know them!<eos> I thank you all so much!<eos> What is wrong with you people?<eos> I mean, is there anything you don't know how to ruin?<eos> Dude, what was up with that?<eos> Yeah, why didn't you tell us?<eos> Well, do you guys want the whole story?<eos> Yeah, we do.
You really want to go to Star City?<eos> Come on, we don't need Team Arrow's help.<eos> Yeah, I think we do, man.<eos> Man, you've fought meta-humans with abilities a lot worse than knife-throwing.<eos> I don't think this guy's a meta-human.<eos> There's something different about him, something, ah, mystical.<eos> Mystical, really?<eos> We stop meta-humans because we're scientists.<eos> We can figure out what their weaknesses are, but we don't have any experience when it comes to guys like this, with magic.<eos> They do.
It's my dad.<eos> I think I did it.<eos> What do you know, Snow?<eos> I think you did do it.<eos> Velocity-6?<eos> This is what was so urgent, Harrison?<eos> You get me to come here so I can take your speed drug?<eos> That's right.<eos> - You knew about this.<eos> - Of course she did.
Gimme.<eos> Now hold still.<eos> This one might hurt. I said stop.<eos> You get in my way again... You touch me again, and I...<eos> ...will end you!<eos> Uh, Efram.<eos> You're fine.<eos> You're fine, you're fine, you're fine, you're fine.<eos> You're unclean in the biblical sense.<eos> Don't!
The A.G.'s office has strict protocols, Castle.<eos> You're not with the A.G.'s office anymore.<eos> I did what I did to protect you.<eos> He gave me a class seven distress code.<eos> That's life or death.<eos> I mean, what did you want me to do?<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> Come on.<eos> Do you have any idea how worried I was?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Yeah, well, your friend with the creepy ring asked so nicely.<eos> Please tell me we're not going to negotiate with terrorists.<eos> Or, you know, 4,000 year old bad guys.<eos> Just think of this more as a fact-finding mission.<eos> Maybe Savage slips up and gives us something that we can use to our advantage.<eos> Thea said you were being a little more humorous lately.<eos> I'm sorry, how do you know so much about Savage, anyway?<eos> I don't know anything about him,<eos> Mr. Allen.<eos> No one does.
Because if that happens, I will come for you.<eos> And in a way that will make you beg for the likes of Vandal Savage.<eos> 24 hours.<eos> Until what?<eos> Until we are supposed to hand you and Carter over to Savage, or--<eos> Savage lays waste to Central City.<eos> Yeah. We've been through this before.<eos> 1887, the Huang he floods,<eos> Savage killed nearly two million people to get to us.<eos> And he did.
These guys don't stay dead.<eos> Especially if you can't find a body.<eos> Whoa.<eos> Glass half empty much?<eos> Good news is whatever Darhk had going on there, we lit it up pretty good.<eos> Where is Merlyn?<eos> Said he had to attend to League business.<eos> Can't believe I'm gonna say this, but I owe him one.<eos> I helped out a little bit, too.<eos> Yes, you did.
"But could youth last and love still breed,<eos> "had joys no date, nor age no need,<eos> "then these delights my mind might move "to live with thee and be thy love."<eos> I had no idea you enjoyed poetry.<eos> Well, there's a lot about me that you haven't... allowed yourself to know.<eos> ♪ Sick of leaving things... ♪ The poems of sir Walter Raleigh, a proper Englishman.<eos> Oh, this looks like a decent edition.<eos> ♪ Sick of leaving things half done... ♪ Do you really think some bauble will convince the heretics to side with you over an evil step-daddy who spoils them rotten with ponies and ice cream?<eos> - I don't have a choice.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Of course I'm right.<eos> The secret to happiness is burying all your true feelings and living a life of bland compromise.<eos> So here's the question, Glenn.<eos> Do you love Peter enough to repress your love for me?<eos> Peter, if you're willing to forget all about this, I'm more than happy to continue hiding my true feelings.<eos> I do miss us hanging out together.<eos> Sorry I kind of went a little crazy.<eos> Ah, that's all right.<eos> And I'm sorry I will always love your wife.<eos> Which I don't.
No, no!<eos> She'll kill you!<eos> Rumple, run!<eos> No, Belle!<eos> I'm not running this time.<eos> No! Go!<eos> Do your worst.<eos> How...<eos> H-how did you know that would transform her back?<eos> I didn't.
Dead.<eos> 'Wait till Moorefield hears about this.<eos> He's been whoring himself out to a couple of half-wits.'<eos> Get me a meeting with the Deputy Prime Minister.<eos> I don't have time for tea with the Queen.<eos> Tell her I'll think about it and let her know.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Lucky for you I do.<eos> 'I hope the fairy tale works out for you.'<eos> - I really do.
You look good.<eos> - Liam, I do not look good.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Morning.<eos> So much for slowing down.<eos> - Eleanor.<eos> - What?<eos> Last night... you said you liked it when I said your name.<eos> - I did? - Mm-hm.
Alak.<eos> My condolences.<eos> Keep 'em.<eos> My mother... you know where she is, don't you?<eos> I do not.<eos> But wherever she is, one may assume her heart grieves.<eos> Well, she's a coward and a murderer.<eos> You do not understand the position she was in.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
There are two bullets left inside, both meant for you... one from Rafe, one from Christie.<eos> He keeps it by the front door.<eos> I would not recommend knocking.<eos> Thank you, for telling me.<eos> He's been through a lot.<eos> Yes.<eos> We all have.<eos> You still have me, Favi.<eos> That I do, Andina.<eos> That I do.
Any money missing from the company?<eos> - No.<eos> - You sure about that.<eos> As far as I know.<eos> Isn't it your job to know?<eos> My job covers a wide range of responsibilities.<eos> You ever heard of Bankers Trust in Sacramento?<eos> Maybe you've heard of Simon Kincaid.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Nick...<eos> Hey, you guys got a minute?<eos> I'm Detective Burkhardt.<eos> What?<eos> You have to be careful with this guy.<eos> I think we can handle him.<eos> No, you don't understand.<eos> He's not what he seems.<eos> We know all about him.<eos> No, you don't.
- This an okay time?<eos> - Yeah, he just ate.<eos> I'm trying to get him back to sleep.<eos> Just came by to see if you needed anything.<eos> Nick here?<eos> No.<eos> He's at work.<eos> It's a little weird getting used to being here again.<eos> - I can't even imagine.<eos> - Don't.
- What is it, farmer?<eos> - First blood or to the death?<eos> - Uhtred!<eos> I'll be splitting your skull, boy.<eos> So one follows the other.<eos> Uhtred?<eos> Father Beocca.<eos> My goodness.<eos> - You know this hassling, father?<eos> - I do. Yes, I do.
Dr. Pineda, tell him what else I say.<eos> If you want to be part of a team...<eos> No job is too big, no job is too small.<eos> Being an emergency-room physician requires humility.<eos> And like a firefighter cleans his rig, you clean yours.<eos> This is Center Stage.<eos> It demands your respect.<eos> Sorry, Dr. Lorenson, but did you want to lay down?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, no. I didn't...
Car accident.<eos> Bad one.<eos> Minivan rolled down an embankment.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Whole family.<eos> Plenty of O-neg.<eos> You get any sleep today?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I know when you're lying.<eos> - No, you don't.
By my last count, there's six plus Kindzi against the entire town.<eos> We can beat 'em. Can we?<eos> Of course we can.<eos> Hell, it wouldn't feel like home if we weren't on the verge of annihilation.<eos> No, this time it's different.<eos> This time it's on me.<eos> God, I'm so stupid.<eos> Amanda, don't.<eos> I believed him.<eos> We all did.
There's a rest stop about a mile south.<eos> - We'll send a vehicle.<eos> - Send a cleanup team, too.<eos> The plan only works if Tamir's people thinks he's still alive.<eos> We'll find Kate another way.<eos> Beslan?<eos> What about Beslan?<eos> He wasn't with Tamir.<eos> - Do you have eyes on him?<eos> - We don't.
What if we never find her?<eos> We will.<eos> This is my fault.<eos> No, it's mine.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Tamir told me that Dmitry... that I killed your husband.<eos> That's why he attacked me.<eos> So I had to kill him before I could find out where Kate is.<eos> You didn't kill Doku.<eos> I did.
That is, assuming we can get Santiani on board.<eos> I don't buy it.<eos> How would this girl get a doctor to go along with faking cancer?<eos> She had no history with an oncologist, no doctor record, no hospital record, no bills.<eos> She didn't need any of those things.<eos> What kind of person asks a cancer patient for proof?<eos> But why would anyone fake something like this?<eos> It's funny you should ask.<eos> Laura has a theory.<eos> Of course she does.
The boys don't even know that he's here.<eos> It's okay if they did.<eos> And I take it that it's okay with you.<eos> We already covered this.<eos> I know.<eos> I just thought that maybe because you saw us together that it might make you feel differently.<eos> It doesn't really matter what I feel.<eos> Laura, is there something you're trying to tell me?<eos> Or that you want me to say?<eos> You already did.
Cut your losses and move on.<eos> But I say that about everything.<eos> If something's failed, light it on fire and watch it burn...<eos> In your rear-view mirror as you drive your way to successtown.<eos> Ah! Maybe you're right.<eos> But I'm also not ready to give up on this place.<eos> It was the future I wanted to build.<eos> I don't think mother nature felt the same way.<eos> I really cared about it.<eos> I still do...
You should have come to us.<eos> And risk losing someone else?<eos> I thought the best way to control the darkness was to isolate myself.<eos> But when I did that, there was no one around to give me hope or tell me when I was being stupid!<eos> Fine.<eos> You're being stupid.<eos> So stop it.<eos> Right now, we have to clean up this mess.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
We were so close, Mary Margaret.<eos> Emma was seconds away from destroying the darkness and ending this.<eos> And Hook would have been dead.<eos> She chose love, David.<eos> And we would have done the same thing.<eos> We'd share one heart because we took the same kind of risk that Emma took.<eos> We save each other.<eos> That is what our family does.<eos> So have some faith in her.<eos> I do.
I'm a really good friend.<eos> Do you day drink?<eos> Well, it's the day and I am drunk, so you tell me.<eos> I mean, Julia's our boss.<eos> I can't believe she wants Ricky to do her in her office.<eos> But that's what she said.<eos> She said, "I want Ricky to do me in my office."<eos> Lots of times.<eos> Didn't she also say, "Lots of times?"<eos> Yes, she did.
Thank God. - Thank God what?<eos> - No, thank God that you're confused too.<eos> I just started these new meds today, and I thought maybe...<eos> - Stop talking, please.<eos> - Stay focused.<eos> - You've just been given an examination of your magical aptitude.<eos> - "Magical"?<eos> - We had reason to believe you possess certain... nascent abilities. - Okay.<eos> I mean, I used to think that...<eos> - And perhaps you did at one time.
All the victims in both instances were teenagers, except for Jose Rivera.<eos> A younger staff, that's pretty typical for a night shift.<eos> The unsubs might have considered that.<eos> It would be easier to subdue a group of kids.<eos> Almost an identical M.O.<eos> Copycat or no, why go back to this town and do this again?<eos> They could be sending some kind of message to announce their return.<eos> Or it just might be criminal ego.<eos> They got away with it the first time.<eos> Why not do it again?
That's not what I asked.<eos> I care for him.<eos> And none of this can affect the way you defend him...<eos> What did I just say about you micromanaging?<eos> You're freaked out, aren't you?<eos> About the other night.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> It doesn't have to mean anything.<eos> We just... Had fun.<eos> Well, at least I did.
No one on my staff did.<eos> In fact, Caleb told us all to take that night off early.<eos> Is the prosecution prepared to call their first witness?<eos> We are, Your Honor.<eos> Annalise Keating. And due to the circumstances, I'll be treating her as a hostile witness.<eos> I'll have no need to be hostile if she stops acting like I'm the one on trial here, Your Honor.<eos> You watch yourself, Ms. Keating.<eos> You're a material witness here today, nothing more.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Sorry doesn't explain why you tell strangers something I haven't even told my parents yet.<eos> I'm just saying, it's not 1995.<eos> You don't need to be ashamed.<eos> Oh, apparently I do, according to your "bro" who thinks I'm dying.<eos> - Asher's an idiot.<eos> - No, you're the idiot because you told him.<eos> It's hard to explain, but everyone in there... we know a lot about each other, even the really bad things.<eos> Oh, like the fact that I'm positive?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't...
And the worst part is, is that you still think that I did.<eos> No.<eos> You needed to be saved from me.<eos> And that's what you all need.<eos> So maybe today was a good thing, you know?<eos> Lock me up.<eos> That way, you can all finally be safe.<eos> Caleb and Catherine Hapstall, you've been charged with murder in the first degree in the death of Helena Hapstall.<eos> Do you understand the charges?<eos> They do not, Your Honor, and neither do I.
This matter's not closed.<eos> What do you got?<eos> A hostage crisis in an MWA building in Queens.<eos> Two gunmen reported five minutes ago.<eos> Reade and Zapata are en route.<eos> MWA?<eos> Municipal Workers Association.<eos> So, what, two gunmen five minutes ago,<eos> NYPD called us already?<eos> No, they didn't.
He came to see me one night last year, and... something was off.<eos> He said he'd been blind his whole life, but now, tonight, he could see.<eos> When he left, he said the next time I saw him, he'd be a different person.<eos> A better person.<eos> Three weeks later, his body floated up in the East River.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You know what I remember about that night?<eos> His eyes.<eos> They had this shine.<eos> Just like yours did on that subway platform.
That sounded like the opposite of fly fishing.<eos> Can we talk about it later?<eos> I'm sorry about Ivan.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Did he have something to do with your job?<eos> The one we don't talk about?<eos> Sorry.<eos> I don't mean to push.<eos> When you were an operative, how did you know when you were in too deep?<eos> I didn't.
You know, coordinate your work ensemble.<eos> Yeah, I'm not too worried about that.<eos> Well, I guess social worker beige does go with everything.<eos> No, it's not that.<eos> I'm not going back to work.<eos> I've already notified my agency.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> You love your job.<eos> I did.
Just someone who hates seeing innocent people mistreated.<eos> I don't know how we can ever thank you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Name it.<eos> Our people at the casino are just as stubborn as Red Hawk.<eos> They won't believe me if I tell them what's coming.<eos> But they might believe you.<eos> Well I'm in.<eos> Since when do you know how to ride a horse?<eos> I don't.
Just one question.<eos> Please.<eos> Fine, if it means you'll be gone quicker.<eos> Come on.<eos> How well do you really know Mandy?<eos> What is it about this girl that's got everyone's knickers in a twist?<eos> Including your own.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> Doesn't anybody care that I'm happy?<eos> Of course I do.
She wouldn't tell me, all right?<eos> Said it was a big secret, some-some, uh, rich married guy.<eos> Well, does she have a friend that she might've confided in?<eos> She didn't trust no one, man.<eos> Uh, uh, her therapist.<eos> Her therapist is probably the only one who knows.<eos> She-she's some, uh, uh, Dr. Linda in-in Beverly Hills.<eos> Saw her, like, five times a week on the DL.<eos> Used a fake name, everything.<eos> Oh, did she now?
Go get the glove.<eos> We can do this!<eos> We can save your vagina!<eos> Hurry before it's too late!<eos> It's taken me a little longer than I anticipated.<eos> - Here you go, sweetie.<eos> - What?<eos> ! Don't give it to me.<eos> I can't go back down there.<eos> You do it.
Yeah, Kyle loved your brother so much.<eos> I don't think your brother ever really forgave himself for getting Kyle into that lifestyle.<eos> Oh, did-did Kyle tell you that?<eos> No, your brother did when he became Kyle's sponsor.<eos> Excuse me, Mya, um, we do have to start prepping.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you come see us after?<eos> I will if I can, yeah.<eos> I loved him, Alex.<eos> We all did.
You're just giving up?<eos> Look, we don't have much of a choice here, okay?<eos> I can't exactly tell your father that his daughter's ghost wants a transplant to happen, so...<eos> Then he wins.<eos> Again.<eos> He wins again?<eos> He made my life a living hell.<eos> Now he's bent on keeping me here.<eos> My father... Started touching me when I was 8, told me if I ever told my mother, it would kill her.<eos> So I didn't.
And the fact that she did this to herself...<eos> I mean, I... I can't even imagine the guilt you must feel...<eos> That there were signs you should have seen of how much she was hurting inside.<eos> But you can't blame yourself.<eos> I do.<eos> You know, as fathers, we try to protect our-our children from every-every cruelty.<eos> But you can't be there every second of every day.<eos> You can't live their whole lives for them.<eos> I tried to be a good father.<eos> I did.
She needs to be strong right now.<eos> Her health is the priority.<eos> Is it gonna work?<eos> Vent on.<eos> Leave some blood behind.<eos> What's happening?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes.<eos> My heart, it took.<eos> It did.
Oh, God.<eos> - We're the most wanted people in Cuba.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So let's just get that ledger and get the hell out of here.<eos> No argument here, but how exactly do we break into Havana's most closely guarded bank, in broad daylight, during business hours?<eos> Very carefully.<eos> What do we have?<eos> Vault's in the southwest corner of the building.<eos> We're really doing this?<eos> We really don't
I'll be in touch.<eos> Make sure you have Heia air dry your sheets!<eos> You'll sleep like a baby!<eos> This whole thing, the diner, it wasn't a hostage situation.<eos> It was a jail break.<eos> Yes.<eos> We're not gonna be able to fight our way out of this, Lizzy.<eos> We're gonna have to think our way out.<eos> You really think he can help?<eos> I do.
No! I'll kill both of you and starting with her.<eos> No, wait!<eos> All right, just kill me!<eos> Kill me.<eos> Ok.<eos> Cover the back.<eos> This way. Come on.<eos> William, please listen to me.<eos> Shut up. No. I know what you're feeling.<eos> No, you don't.
Can you finish it?<eos> This wheatgrass smell makes me sick.<eos> Well, man up.<eos> I'm balls deep in three gut busters over here.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> It smells like the Jolly Green Giant's jock strap.<eos> Oh, my God, it's like...<eos> Stop.<eos> You gagging makes me gag.<eos> Okay, almost done.
And yet, I do the same, and I'm in trouble?<eos> That... is perfect.<eos> You think your father would be proud of this?<eos> I will never win with you.<eos> Yeah, I should go.<eos> Hey, thanks.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I don't understand why you would react like that.<eos> No, Kara, you don't.
Hauser escaped to redeem himself?<eos> For Hauser and me, Tommy the Irishman and his $10-million stash, it was like Moby Dick, the one that got away.<eos> If Hauser thought that if he escaped with Mullens, he could recover that money...<eos> He'd do it and then disappear to some far-off island.<eos> No, he wouldn't.<eos> He would deliver Mullens and the money to me.<eos> It's a hell of a stretch.<eos> Hauser was my sergeant before he was my captain.<eos> We rode for two years, you don't know him the way I do.<eos> The way I did.
It didn't have to be this way.<eos> Don't try talking to me now.<eos> Tell my brother I'll be right there, Andromeda.<eos> Where is your new friend?<eos> Need help closing the deal?<eos> We're working on a new case.<eos> Case?<eos> So, are we both cops now?<eos> I know you got your pieces of the puzzle, too.<eos> - You always do.
- What?<eos> - One one thousand.<eos> Dash.<eos> What am I shooting at?<eos> Three one thousand.<eos> - Dash. - Now!<eos> Where was he?<eos> I didn't see him.<eos> Dash, I missed.<eos> I didn't.
- It's my job to stop her... - No.<eos> It's not.<eos> It's Hank's.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> Come in and we'll spar to make sure you're ready, okay?<eos> You two seem pretty chummy.<eos> We were wrong about Hank.<eos> He didn't have anything to do with my dad's death.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Just... I do.
Previously, on Hawaii Five-O...<eos> What do you want from him!<eos> Gabriel wants me to transfer all my assets to a holding company he controls.<eos> Gabriel got away with the money that was meant to buy his freedom from the Yakuza.<eos> Without it, we're both dead.<eos> It's not that I don't love you.<eos> I do.
"Electric down.<eos> "Trying to get the hatch open.<eos> We're compromised."<eos> "No generator."<eos> No oxygen system.<eos> The shared ventilation system provides all of us with roughly 150 cubic feet of oxygen.<eos> Divide that by 13, each consuming 1.5 cubic feet of oxygen per hour, we have one hour and ten minutes of oxygen left.<eos> I'm a Marine-- I spent a lot of time on a ship.<eos> You have immersion suits down here for underwater escape.<eos> Uh, we do, but not in this compartment.
But tonight you're gonna wake up in recovery, 100% fine, and I will be there to tell you so.<eos> Sylvester,<eos> I really do love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I'll see you tonight.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm sorry to hear your friend is sick.<eos> Seriously? We have to put a bell on you.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
I'll been in in a sec.<eos> Open.<eos> Okay, help me pull.<eos> Got it!<eos> As much as I hate saying this, you need to put this on.<eos> Let's go!<eos> I can't believe that worked.<eos> I can't believe I left my pants in there.<eos> I'm so glad I brought extra clothes.<eos> You did?
It turns out Open Vistas is no ordinary rehab.<eos> They specialize in Marks syndrome, a brain disorder common to former Precrime prisoners.<eos> Halo burn.<eos> So you're saying my victim was a nurse in a building full of killers?<eos> I'm saying my victim, and future-killers, technically, the city set them free after Precrime was abolished.<eos> Oh, that doesn't make them innocent.<eos> These people would be murderers.<eos> Yeah, but the trick is, which one are we looking for?<eos> We have no DNA, no face to run.<eos> What if we did?
Why did you leave?<eos> Mm, get out of the city.<eos> You?<eos> Same.<eos> - It's a lot quieter out here.<eos> - Mm.<eos> I knew a man who worked at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio.<eos> Lucas Tollin?<eos> Mm, can't say I ever met the man.<eos> Sure you did.
Actually, you can.<eos> Your patient was flagged a potential risk by the city's<eos> - new...<eos> - Hawk-Eye program.<eos> I heard.<eos> Mark was a little agitated this afternoon.<eos> Then you know that the provisions bypass doctor-patient confidentiality.<eos> Denying access is a felony punishable by jail.<eos> How do you sleep at night, Detective, knowing that you work for a police state?<eos> Well, some nights I don't.
Wait.<eos> What's that?<eos> Go back.<eos> - What is that?<eos> - Sounds like Darth Vader.<eos> Could you isolate that sound?<eos> Yes.<eos> Oh, my God! It's wheezing.<eos> - I know who it is.<eos> - No, you do not.
Is she wanting to be won back?<eos> When we first met, it was my roguish charm that caused Beckett to drop her guard, but it was my sherlockian skills that made her fall in love with me.<eos> I just have to solve a few cases with her to show her that, together, we are still magic.<eos> Richard, you do know that you cannot just barge your way into the precinct and talk your way onto a case anymore.<eos> I am a licensed private investigator.<eos> I don't need a precinct to solve a case.<eos> Now, this tattoo was on the body of a dead convict found in Central Park.<eos> I know I've seen it somewhere before.<eos> I just don't know where.<eos> I do.
I might be able to help.<eos> Now we're talking.<eos> My study deals with extracting secrets from unwilling subjects.<eos> And Peter revealed that he was having an affair?<eos> So, who was he sleeping with?<eos> Someone on that list.<eos> Dean Feller, I'm sure you know why you're here.<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> Well, we found the studio apartment.<eos> I don't...
So, what are you thinking?<eos> How Peter escaped had something to do with who killed him?<eos> Only one way to figure it out.<eos> And guess what.<eos> We're gonna figure it out together.<eos> You're not gonna get a signal.<eos> - You trapped me in here on purpose.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> But since you brought it up, tell me... why do you feel trapped in our marriage?<eos> I don't.
Nobody's life is important right now.<eos> Nothing's important but getting on that ship and destroying it.<eos> I'm sorry, Nolan, but that's true.<eos> You have to leave.<eos> It's just not a party without you.<eos> Wish me luck?<eos> Oh, you don't need luck.<eos> You'll be back.<eos> You always come back.<eos> And when you do...
Yes.<eos> - You probably want me to stop asking questions, huh?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I'm home.<eos> Run upstairs and tell the girls dinner's in about ten minutes, would you?<eos> - All right.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Okay, so I've had about 20 minutes in the car to process this news, and I think I know what's going on.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
The truth?<eos> Alison gets the short end of the attention stick around here.<eos> In what way?<eos> Well, this fashion thing, it's been going on for a long time.<eos> Really?<eos> Years, Mom.<eos> I mean, she reads magazines and blogs.<eos> She follows trends.<eos> She even sketches designs sometimes.<eos> She does?
I'm sorry about that.<eos> That's okay.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> I love it down here.<eos> Some people don't get it.<eos> Yeah, it's good energy.<eos> It's real.<eos> Cayman and company back there can be kind of soul-crushing.<eos> Why would you want to be friends with people like that?<eos> I don't.
Please.<eos> You need to listen to me.<eos> Dash, get out!<eos> I know what it's like.<eos> To obsess.<eos> You don't know the first thing.<eos> I know everything.<eos> My whole life, all I've seen are people making the same decisions that you're about to make.<eos> And it doesn't help.<eos> It never does.
I wanted to call him Joseph.<eos> Joseph...<eos> My little Joseph...<eos> No, don't...<eos> Do you remember, when I used to visit you?<eos> You've always been a good lad.<eos> I made the right choice.<eos> The other one, Joseph, he was the Devil.<eos> Do you remember what I used to talk about?<eos> You didn't.
But what you saw in that video, that never happened.<eos> Nobody died in that alley.<eos> Nobody.<eos> Torrential rain, passage of time.<eos> There's no way any trace evidence survived.<eos> Yeah, we're not looking for physical evidence.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> We are looking for George Mallory's camera.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I-I do this sometimes.
I've been planning the op.<eos> The op? Yeah.<eos> I secured a ring.<eos> I reconned a location.<eos> Now I just got to execute.<eos> I mean, it just, it sounds so romantic the way you say it, you know?<eos> I mean, I could see it now-- you and Catherine in matching camouflage cargo pants on some very exotic shooting range, and you get down on one knee, and you say, "Babe,<eos> I mean, it's every girl's fairy tale.<eos> Oh, yeah, you want to hear a secret? Yeah.<eos> You do? Mm-hmm.
I get it. Go to your dinner, Rosie.<eos> Another time.<eos> Wednesdays?<eos> 8:00 P.M.?<eos> Hey, hey. There you are.<eos> Hello, Ms. Rosewood.<eos> I'm Dante Harrell.<eos> There's no need.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
Idiot.<eos> I don't need your lectures.<eos> Come on now.<eos> Is it ready yet?<eos> I'm starving.<eos> Want some more?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'm off to bed.<eos> - Did he really say "thanks"?<eos> - He did.
I never mentioned a cross.<eos> Tell me the truth.<eos> The Sisters of, uh, St. Agatha have been rumored to perform exorcisms of the iron cross.<eos> A pointless effort.<eos> No matter the good intention.<eos> After all that talk of armies and ships, you defeated the English with nothing more than a letter.<eos> I can't take much of the credit.<eos> It was Mary's plan.<eos> How did you know it would work?<eos> I didn't.
I mean, this is... this is ridiculous.<eos> Look, I told you to stop calling me Sammy.<eos> Take me back to the beginning.<eos> Lay it out for me.<eos> A few months ago, ATF busted two former Cal Tech grad students in West Covina for manufacturing Binetex.<eos> Okay. ATF already knew that they had sold 50 pounds of the explosives to a Filipino arms dealer named Ramon Santos.<eos> I was able to get in undercover as a middleman between Santos and Madison's guys.<eos> We set up a buy, everything was going smoothly until the sale went down.<eos> Then... you saw the rest.<eos> Yeah, we did.
You've earned it.<eos> At this point, why even go to bed, you know?<eos> I feel like if I just keep moving, I'll be fine.<eos> Ooh, I have a good idea.<eos> Let's go grab burgers, huh?<eos> Double-double, animal style.<eos> My treat.<eos> Who's with me?<eos> You know they make animal-style fries, too?<eos> Of course I do.
He has a message.<eos> He knows he's not involved in your bombing case, but if you're interested, he figured out who Taurus is.<eos> How did he even know we're looking for Taurus?<eos> I can read lips.<eos> It isn't that hard.<eos> People have been talking to you your whole life.<eos> You just got to pay attention to their mouths.<eos> "I did not read the Iliad.<eos> Maybe honesty counts for points"?<eos> It does not,
and our high-performing employees understand that they're safe.<eos> Sounds like a fun place to work.<eos> - Talented employees<eos> - Ready to try this?<eos> Come and go at Eukaryote...<eos> Hi.<eos> Good morning.<eos> So, we're here to see that guy.<eos> Do you have an appointment?<eos> No, we don't.
Is it?<eos> You chew your pens.<eos> I used to do this.<eos> Probably a good DNA sample here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Of course... if it is your DNA under Paul Wilkerman's fingernails, we'll know soon enough.<eos> Which means you have a very short amount of time to cooperate.<eos> You could start by telling us which of Paul's heirs you were conspiring with.<eos> And I want to know what you did with Arthur's mouse.<eos> I do, too.
I can come to your house.<eos> I can come to your neighbors' house.<eos> - You cannot! - I could come to your - parents' house and say that you welched<eos> - Oh, sir...<eos> - on your debt.<eos> You took out<eos> - You know where my parents live? money and you're not paying it.<eos> - No, I've paid every cent.<eos> - Yes, you should... I can do that, it is not illegal<eos> - for me to do that.
It is. And I've seen it once before.<eos> Crime scene? Well...<eos> Sort of.<eos> I had a meeting with Chavez.<eos> When?<eos> The night she was killed. What do you mean, Chavez was killed?<eos> It was a set-up.<eos> They attacked us right when we got there.<eos> You know the FBI is still looking for her, don't you?<eos> You didn't...
Can we not talk about this, please?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Don't worry, they'll get Cruz, and then they'll get the rest of them.<eos> You don't know what these people are like.<eos> I've dealt with a few.<eos> They're crazy, what they're gonna do.<eos> They told you? No, no.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I thought you said they didn't talk to you.<eos> They didn't.
It's a black magic amulet.<eos> Part of some creepy serial killer ritual or whatever.<eos> This inscription right here, it's a protection charm, most commonly used in occult ceremonies performed to bind two people together.<eos> Not a very good protection charm, though, if you ask me, am I right?<eos> (chuckles)<eos> You know, 'cause she was chopped all up in a bag, right?<eos> Guys, look, uh, all right, look, maybe it makes sense if it's our killer's way of linking himself to the Vic?<eos> Okay, that's... that's pretty good.<eos> Since when do you speak Latin?<eos> I don't.
- And look who he's talking to.<eos> - That's Judge McCan.<eos> - Oh, that's Judge McCan.<eos> That's Judge McCan!<eos> Oh, I'm supposed to recognize judges now?<eos> - Hey! It's good - Oh, hi!<eos> - to see you guys!<eos> - How are you? Nice to see you.<eos> Yeah, so I see you got some drinks.<eos> - Yeah, we did. We did. - Mwah!
Introducing the Flexi-box!<eos> I guess that's Nesbit.<eos> The indestructible mailbox that is taking the nation by storm!<eos> You can try smashing it.<eos> You can try crushing it.<eos> But nothing...<eos> Nothing, I mean nothing destroys the Flexi-box.<eos> Aw, man!<eos> I used to love this commercial.<eos> Of course you did.
No, I am.<eos> It's just, you know, you were right, Bones.<eos> Look, this wasn't about finding Jared's ashes, this was about my brother being gone.<eos> I know how much you miss him.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I don't want the kids to wake up.<eos> You want to take the box?<eos> No, I tell you what, why don't we just leave it here so she can visit her brother in the morning.<eos> Girl really loves her brother, doesn't she?<eos> Yes, she does.
The phone is in the room, but she isn't.<eos> There's something else we need to talk about.<eos> Did she tell you she was withdrawing from school?<eos> She was?<eos> She got a B-plus on her midterm.<eos> She thought her world was over. Aasia, you never told me that.<eos> She picked up extra-credit work and she was going to withdraw her request on Monday.<eos> This, whatever's happening, it isn't related to that.<eos> I need you to believe me.<eos> I do.
Also grateful?<eos> Petra, because the fertility clinic discovered one last sample of Rafael's sperm.<eos> And thanks to some wise words from Rafael's sister Luisa...<eos> That should have been your baby!<eos> A few too many drinks and a willing turkey baster... well, you get the idea.<eos> But she didn't get off Scott-free.<eos> I just wanted to discuss the fact that you stole Mr. Solano's sperm.<eos> And let's not forget<eos> - Rogelio and Xiomara.<eos> - I totally do!

It's not every day I recommend his assistant become the manager of the lounge.<eos> Executive assistant.<eos> Oh. Well, that's a position I can get you...<eos> That's what I am!<eos> You have until the end of the day, or I'm gonna tell Rafael that you stole his sperm.<eos> Have him sign my new contract.<eos> Of course I didn't read the contract.<eos> Who reads contracts?<eos> That's what I have lawyers for.<eos> At least I did, anyway.
I made two last week. Wow.<eos> Um, wait, hang on.<eos> Six grams-- is that not too much?<eos> I mean, will it not short-circuit the explosion?<eos> No, it should accelerate it.<eos> Okay. Trust you on that one.<eos> Oh, no! I don't have magnesium.<eos> You can break up the flint.<eos> You have a fire-starter kit in your heel?<eos> You don't?
It means that you are just going to sit here and enjoy it.<eos> Uh, you're very kind, but, uh, we're in a bit of a rush.<eos> I need Dr. Rosewood to sign these transfer papers and for someone to let the county examiners in to take possession of the body.<eos> Oh, I can sign these.<eos> I'm the office administrator.<eos> Oh, dear. I need a pen, though.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We need to finish this right now. Let's go.<eos> All done.
Did he threaten to?<eos> He said, Claire asked for a divorce in the same room and look what happened to her.<eos> Pretty close to admitting he had committed a murder.<eos> That's when I knew I had to go.<eos> But, I'd never pull off hiding from him.<eos> So, you had to be dead.<eos> You did a good job.<eos> The 911 called the DNA on the broken windshield.<eos> Oh, yeah. I thought that would convince him.<eos> It did.
I don't know.<eos> I know I'm all they have now.<eos> - Hello. - Hey, honey.<eos> - Can I ask you a tiny little favor? - Okay.<eos> Can you rotate the eggs 90 degrees, clockwise?<eos> No, Phil, I can't. I can't.<eos> I am tired, and I am sweaty, and as much as I have tried to stay positive like you all day, I think sometimes we need to just face certain facts like corporate people are not creative, and ducks that haven't hatched in a month might never.<eos> Just turn the eggs, lady!<eos> You know what?<eos> Kind of done with birds for the day.
Go try a layer four UDP/TCP in the OSI stacks.<eos> Agent Navabi?<eos> I don't understand half of what he's saying.<eos> I don't even know what questions to ask him.<eos> I thought you were great.<eos> Maybe I can talk to him.<eos> Look, Gavin--<eos> Mr. Delgado, we both know you can take that site down.<eos> I don't choose who deserves to die.<eos> The masses do.
Maybe I can talk to him.<eos> Look, Gavin--<eos> Mr. Delgado, we both know you can take that site down.<eos> I don't choose who deserves to die.<eos> The masses do.<eos> No Capitol Hill, no committees, no debates.<eos> I've created the purest form of democracy.<eos> By dispersing power directly into the hands of the people, no single person possesses the ability to tip the scales.<eos> And I don't choose targets.<eos> The people do.
You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> You're supposed to be dead.<eos> I saw it on the news.<eos> - Take me off the site.<eos> - Site?<eos> What site? What are you talking about?<eos> Look at me and listen to what I'm saying to you, because I'm in no mood to repeat myself.<eos> We know what you've done.<eos> We know you have the power to stop it.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Her name was Sharon.<eos> Did you know that before you blew her up?<eos> Blair, honey, whatever they're telling you to do--<eos> No!<eos> Dad, no.<eos> I am so sorry, but I had nothing to do--<eos> You killed her!<eos> No, she didn't.<eos> It's understandable that you would think she did,<eos> - but she didn't.
We must recast.<eos> But it's Make Love Week.<eos> Fans will want to see someone spectacular in bed with me.<eos> Salma, Penelope, J. Lo.<eos> Rogelio, be realistic.<eos> You're right... younger.<eos> Selena, Demi, Emma Stone.<eos> I heard she can play any race.<eos> - Stop, you know who it should be.<eos> - No, I don't.
Jane, and yes.<eos> No one said she didn't want to go.<eos> But she just broke into tears.<eos> I want to work.<eos> Does that make me terrible?<eos> Mommies, stop.<eos> There's no right choice, because we're all different.<eos> The only thing that's important is that you honor whatever choice is right for you.<eos> Oh, my.<eos> Did you... ?
- One more thing, Janie. - Uh-huh?<eos> Abuela wrote this to read at my baptism.<eos> I read it at yours.<eos> And I want you to read it at Mateo's.<eos> Oh... It is with great joy that this family, brought together by unconventional circumstances, welcomes this precious life for baptism.<eos> Jane and Rafael, what name do you give your son?<eos> - Mateo.<eos> - Mateo.<eos> Michael and Lina, as godparents, do you promise to support these parents in raising this child, showering him with wisdom and affection?<eos> - We do.

So that's my advice to you.<eos> There's a baby coming.<eos> Whatever that means to you, embrace it.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Okay, Mateo's down.<eos> So... let's talk about Petra.<eos> I mean, if you still want to.<eos> No, yes, of course I do.
Yeah.<eos> We checked.<eos> You had markers and I.O.U.S all over the city.<eos> At underground casinos... the kind of establishments that don't take kindly when you can't pay up.<eos> I bet you thought it was your lucky day when your brother asked you to forge that Van Gogh.<eos> Justin was gonna sell the original painting.<eos> The two of you would split the profits, but when you found out that he was just gonna give that painting away, you got a little pissed.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> I-it doesn't prove that I killed him, either.<eos> No, but the hair at the crime scene does.
I didn't tell you because of this.<eos> I knew how you'd react, and it wasn't worth it.<eos> Oh, oh. I'm not upset about him.<eos> I'm upset about the lie.<eos> You're also upset about him.<eos> Of course I'm upset about him!<eos> He's Korean Channing Tatum!<eos> Come on, I'm sure you have an ex who's more attractive than you let on.<eos> No!<eos> I didn't!
Well, that's good.<eos> I love a story with a happy ending.<eos> I also love stories with robots.<eos> Hey, let me take a picture, like I did 20 years ago.<eos> You know what?<eos> I-I think I got a better pose for you.<eos> Allison...<eos> I always knew I loved you,<eos> (Voice breaking): But I had no idea how amazing it'd be to build a family and a life with you.<eos> But I do now.
You come onto my turf, there are consequences.<eos> Well, this... this is my turf, Beef.<eos> Get out now and don't come back.<eos> (Chuckles) You think I'm scared of you and your little girls?<eos> Oh, speaking of girls.<eos> - I have this, er... friend and he's seeing one. - (Whistles)<eos> - (Groans) - (Cracks nut)<eos> But, er... he doesn't trust her.<eos> - She's got this mother.<eos> - They always do.
Looks like that's how he and Costello communicated.<eos> There were texts that corresponded with the time of the victims' deaths.<eos> They were coordinating the shootings.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> (sighs, clears throat)<eos> You scared the hell out of me.<eos> When that door closed and I heard those shots,<eos> - I thought they...<eos> - Jane.<eos> They didn't, okay?
Easy.<eos> Jesse.<eos> Are...<eos> Are you a cop now?<eos> Do you believe him?<eos> That man pulled every one of us out of that wreck.<eos> My whole body was broken.<eos> I couldn't move.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.
Wait.<eos> Just wait, wait, wait, wait. Okay.<eos> Do you think this is one of those things.<eos> "Cop shoots an unarmed man" kind of thing?<eos> Because my partner and I got bullet holes in us that tell a different story.<eos> Okay, settle down.<eos> I thought you and I had something<eos> - in the bank here, Leanne.<eos> - We do.<eos> We do.
Jill, those earrings are nice.<eos> These are the most beautiful earrings I've ever seen.<eos> I picked them out.<eos> Happy housewarming/ Merry Christmas.<eos> You really shouldn't have done this.<eos> They look so expensive.<eos> They are.<eos> We just wanted to say we're sorry.<eos> We were way out of line to think we knew what was best for you.<eos> Even though we do.
Yeah.<eos> Something about... sending them off to live happily ever after.<eos> Alone and in peace.<eos> And what's the nonfiction?<eos> Can't say, Henry.<eos> You know that.<eos> No one wants this hot potato.<eos> They disappear, we all sleep easy.<eos> My agency had plans for them.<eos> (chuckles) Yeah, well, who didn't?
We can't deal with the volume, and we need to move some of these patients.<eos> What, so we can make it somebody else's problem?<eos> I'm just saying that we're at a breaking point and we don't want to make any mistakes.<eos> I don't give a damn about reputation.<eos> I know you're overwhelmed.<eos> Everyone is.<eos> But this is our hospital, and these are our patients whether we like it or not.<eos> And we are gonna push through as best as we can, and we are not gonna stop until every last patient gets exactly the care that they deserve.<eos> Got it?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, yeah, we're almost there.<eos> Because I knew you would call back, and I was right.<eos> We know each other.<eos> Trace?<eos> She hung up on me.<eos> Or maybe it was just a bad signal.<eos> Oh, there she is.<eos> Babe?<eos> Nope, was trying to make sure you had a good signal.<eos> You do.
The area south of downtown South Park has always been the ugly eyesore of this town.<eos> But now SodoSopa is going to bring in the fresh, new vibrancy that Whole Foods can't ignore.<eos> We'll keep the existing structures, but add brick walkways and some quaint, white lights.<eos> A plaza in the middle will be a place where young couples can play with their toddlers.<eos> And it will all be small businesses, like artisan cheese shops or noodle houses.<eos> Oh, this is really exciting.<eos> I thought this area was just gonna stay forever.<eos> Who is?<eos> So you think you keep all the existing structures?<eos> I do.
Hey, bro.<eos> I'm the new principal of the school.<eos> My name's PC Principal.<eos> PC Principal.<eos> I like that.<eos> So, you've just recently moved here?<eos> That's right.<eos> And do you believe this town is deserving of a Whole Foods?<eos> You know, I think it's changed a lot.<eos> I really do.
How dare you?<eos> This is a complete violation of the anonymity we were promised at Utopia Circle.<eos> Utopia Circle won't exist if Tanya's convicted.<eos> Maybe she should be convicted.<eos> I mean, Dominic's dead because she pushed him too far.<eos> It's called "The Octopus"...<eos> Dominic's favorite position...<eos> mine, too... except Dominic also liked to get slapped in the face during it.<eos> Uh, how does this help Tanya's case?<eos> It doesn't.
Nothing.<eos> But -- no, you looked at Sam like -- you guys know what's wrong with me.<eos> You don't have a soul, all right?<eos> Amara sucked it out.<eos> You want to be a little more blunt?<eos> H-how is that even possible?<eos> Look, this is just so you don't get in trouble, all right?<eos> We'll be right back, and then we'll figure out what to do with you.<eos> Well, how do -- how do I get it back -- my soul?<eos> Generally, you don't.
We got it from here.<eos> My name's Erin Lindsay.<eos> I'm with the Chicago Police Department.<eos> I'm gonna come in, okay?<eos> We're here to help.<eos> There's a lot of people that are looking for you.<eos> Sarah?<eos> You know my name?<eos> I know all about what happened to you.<eos> No, you don't.
Oh, yeah.<eos> [Come here.]<eos> Should get that looked at.<eos> Rumble in the jungle, eh?<eos> Heard you landed a pretty good punch yourself.<eos> Ah, well...<eos> What I've lost in speed, I've made up for in accuracy.<eos> Look, Jake, I understand your, erm...<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
Yeah, actually yes, yes, I am - - I am sick.<eos> I'm sick of worrying about you every time you go to work.<eos> I'm sick of freaking out every time the phone rings cos it might be the station, or...<eos> - Or the hospital, saying something's happened to you...<eos> - Al,<eos> I'm fine!<eos> How can you say that after what happened to you today?<eos> You had someone pull a gun on you!<eos> You nearly died...<eos> - But I didn't.
- It's fine. I just need to know.<eos> Oh, you don't think you deserved my piling my service on you.<eos> - No.<eos> - I believe you do.<eos> What?<eos> I'm gonna let you in on a secret.<eos> See, when Webber had this job, it was easier for him.<eos> And hunt had it easier than I do.<eos> You know why?<eos> - I don't.
- You can't...<eos> - Don't talk to my wife that way.<eos> - Shut up, Frank.<eos> - Jannie...<eos> Not another word.<eos> You knew.<eos> Did you give him the drugs because you knew what he would do with them?<eos> I graduated college in 1973.<eos> Do you know how many women in this country had a college degree in 1973?<eos> - I don't.
I'm the reigning two-time champ.<eos> It's a 12-team PPR league.<eos> 12-team PPR league.<eos> Well, before I, you know, before I...<eos> Booth quit because he thought it was a gateway to gambling, so...<eos> Oh, it looks like Angela got us access to Ross's league.<eos> That's gonna be tons of information we're gonna have to go through.<eos> Lots of transaction logs, e-mails; not to mention, all the trash talking on the message boards.<eos> Oh, I love a good trash talking.<eos> Of course you do.
Which means the murder weapon made two stabs at a time.<eos> So we're looking for a two-pronged weapon.<eos> Hodgins just sent results from the defecation.<eos> It looks like the coywolves recently feasted on...<eos> Sus domesticus.<eos> They ate pigs?<eos> Perhaps they got into a farm?<eos> No, these pigs were cured with salt.<eos> I know the murder weapon.<eos> You do?
You know, you had every right to veto that Aaron Rodgers trade.<eos> I mean, that would've been collusion.<eos> Any commissioner would've vetoed that trade.<eos> But that must've been the last straw for Ross, who wasn't happy with you as commissioner.<eos> That's why Ross went to confront you at the sandwich shop.<eos> And when you didn't approve the Aaron Rodgers trade, he was gonna oust you as commissioner.<eos> You can't prove anything.<eos> That's when a fight escalated.<eos> You grabbed your little meat holder there and stabbed him two times.<eos> How did you...?
Well, think about it some more.<eos> There are plenty of creative ways for Andy to survive!<eos> Someone shot to the sternum?<eos> !<eos> Okay, come on, do you know how fatal that is, Bones?<eos> Booth, you're questioning my knowledge of an injury to the sternum?<eos> Oh, really, you're questioning my, uh, gun shots.<eos> Stop!<eos> No!<eos> Don't!

Mom says you're hopeless.<eos> You can't make a living.<eos> I'll come down from the mountain.<eos> I'll do anything!<eos> I won't let you go hungry.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Please. Tell me.<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Do you want to marry me, or not?<eos> Of course I do!
It's the king of all Corean tigers!<eos> Why?<eos> Wanna catch it and get rich?<eos> Just a thought.<eos> Why, you little!<eos> The kid is serious.<eos> Look kid.<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> Do you even know how to shoot?<eos> Of course I do!
Not interested.<eos> He'll die anyway.<eos> If we don't kill it, someone else will.<eos> Why shouldn't he die by our hands?<eos> Sir. Don't you want payback?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Don't you boys have to get going?<eos> Sir.<eos> - He didn't mean anything.<eos> - Yes, I did.
I've been hunting since I was ten.<eos> Do the right thing.<eos> If it wasn't for Seok, he'd be long dead!<eos> After what happened, he'd be lost without Seok.<eos> You know?<eos> Not everyone dies hunting.<eos> Do what's right!<eos> The hunters here belong to the army.<eos> You know you can't come and go as you please.<eos> Of course I do, sir.
- She wants to see you at 11:00.<eos> - Today?<eos> Get out of my frickin' way, Frank.<eos> Move, or I break your face.<eos> Calm the hell down.<eos> She knows what the hell this is about.<eos> It's okay, Frank.<eos> See?<eos> Annalise, he could have a wire.<eos> I don't.
You have a feeling?<eos> I'll call you back.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I haven't told Sinclair anything...<eos> Yet.<eos> I have some questions.<eos> Of course.<eos> Frank helped you, right?<eos> It's not like you and Annalise carried that body into the woods.<eos> He did.
Where are you?<eos> Just keeping an eye on our guy Bruno.<eos> Well, stop.<eos> I talked to Nate, and he promised he was gonna look into him.<eos> And you think your cop buddy's<eos> - gonna handle this the right way? - Yes. And what does the "right way" mean?<eos> - I'll call you later.<eos> - They're dating?<eos> Michaela's pretty much the only other number he calls, but I don't think she knows who he is.<eos> But Wes does?
You're not gonna get me drunk and convince me to sign this deal.<eos> I know.<eos> You don't know who killed Sam Keating.<eos> Not for sure, at least.<eos> That was a stall tactic, a very smart one.<eos> I understand why you did it.<eos> This can't be an easy decision for you to make.<eos> Then don't make me make it.<eos> I wish I had that much power.<eos> You do.
- Nothing yet.<eos> Did you bring the drugs?<eos> Yeah, let's cut them up and snort them before the cops come.<eos> Screw this.<eos> Tell us what the hell's going on.<eos> - Relax, Michaela.<eos> - How can I if we're about to get arrested?<eos> - No one's getting arrested.<eos> - How do you know that?<eos> 'Cause she does.
Because I needed to know the truth about Annalise...<eos> And we don't deserve that, too?<eos> The people who've helped you over and over again to...<eos> - Michaela, let me...<eos> - Do not touch me!<eos> Hey!<eos> Keep your hands off of her.<eos> - Where's Rebecca?<eos> You know, don't you?<eos> - I don't.

"Da-veed."<eos> "Day-vid." "Day-vid." "Day-vid." "Day-vid."<eos> I can update this to a one-star review in two seconds, dude.<eos> Oh, God, I love being a restaurant critic.<eos> And yet, there was more.<eos> For in this crisp time when autumn begins to fade, the chef brines chicken in habañero and even adds habañero powder to the crust.<eos> But the heat is restrained.<eos> You experience the fruity, delicious flavor of this without any spicy pain.<eos> I don't need anymore pain.<eos> Hell, does anyone?
No, I'm gonna call him.<eos> [beeping]<eos> - They need us upstairs, bro.<eos> - [Door buzzes]<eos> What?<eos> You were engaged twice?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Before Wendy, there was Nicole.<eos> - You knew that.<eos> - No, I didn't.
Boy, your second birthday was a real barn-burner, huh?<eos> Look at that.<eos> Sorry I missed it.<eos> Wish I had been there.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Way it shook out, I, uh, I'm glad you get to watch it with me now.<eos> Edie can't get enough of this raw bar.<eos> Look at her go!<eos> - Do I know kids or what?<eos> - You do.
I'm asking so I can defend you.<eos> Yes.<eos> There's people that can vouch for it.<eos> What they didn't know is that he was beating me, because I covered up for him again and again.<eos> I just couldn't take it anymore.<eos> Why stage the crime scene?<eos> - I exaggerated it.<eos> - Why? Because I knew no one would believe me.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> - Because I do.
He doesn't want any of you near this case.<eos> But not me, right?<eos> You know, at least tell me you've made some headway on the suspect front.<eos> - You're all garbage.<eos> - You mean all them, right?<eos> Not me?<eos> I-I'm still good, right?<eos> Find everyone who knew Jill and Steve and see if anyone witnessed the abuse.<eos> We believe her?<eos> For some reason, I do, yes.
I'm over all the secrets.<eos> We should know better at this point.<eos> So let's just get an answer once and for all.<eos> Spit it out.<eos> You're gonna want to lie to us, but I'm warning you we know a lot more...<eos> Wes stole the key to the storage locker because this guy Bruno told him you went there the night Rebecca disappeared.<eos> So we unlocked it to see if her dead body was in there, but...<eos> We just found cash.<eos> - I know.<eos> - You do?
Jackson Richmond!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Jackson Richmond, you're under arrest for cyber bank fraud.<eos> You set me up?<eos> But I did it for us.<eos> There is no "us."<eos> Suspect is in custody.<eos> I'm sorry you had to do that.<eos> I know he meant a lot to you.<eos> He did.
No, actually, my aides are rushing to prepare a bill to increase the debt ceiling.<eos> Last thing we need is another government shutdown.<eos> It must be quite difficult for your staff to put all that into their work, knowing it is unlikely for any senator to actually read it before a vote.<eos> I must ask if we could return to the investigation.<eos> Sure, let's back it up a bit, Bones, you know.<eos> I find myself quite curious as to how you plan to spin the fact that Senator O'Malley was hacked to pieces.<eos> So you're saying Rick was dismembered?<eos> What's interesting is the placement of the hack marks.<eos> As a former surgeon, you know it is ideal to cut along the joints.<eos> Killer didn't do that.
This was not an accident.<eos> Somebody cut the gate over there.<eos> Saw that.<eos> Did a hatchet job on the cables.<eos> Oh, ballsy.<eos> Bastards were smart.<eos> Avoided the security cams, had all the right gear.<eos> Industrial cutters, just like those.<eos> Look familiar?<eos> Murder weapon did double duty.
You get that from a greeting card or a fortune cookie?<eos> So where's my wife?<eos> Thank God.<eos> Carol? Who is this?<eos> Your husband.<eos> - My husband? - Yes.<eos> He loves you, and he's gonna take you home.<eos> I'd rather go with you.<eos> I wouldn't know where to go.<eos> Tom does.
Then that means ...<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> When that circus gypsy predicted this is how grandma would die, we all laughed.<eos> Well, I guess she's the one laughing now.<eos> That's not true.<eos> I actually find this very sad.<eos> Your principal ... he stinks!<eos> Not true!<eos> I showered this morning!<eos> Yeah, you do, you old dick!
I actually find this very sad.<eos> Your principal ... he stinks!<eos> Not true!<eos> I showered this morning!<eos> Yeah, you do, you old dick!<eos> You suck at video games, you don't like rap music, and you hate Chew Blast gum!<eos> No!<eos> Your bus driver sucks [bleep]<eos> You suck [bleep]<eos> No, you do!
Well, looks like the lunch rush is over.<eos> No Felix, no Tendo.<eos> We are closed.<eos> Well, your sign says you're open.<eos> You followed us?<eos> You want to tell me why you ran an eye-dent search on Tendo Guinta?<eos> - Hawk-Eye showed...<eos> - You can go ahead and stop lying to me now.<eos> I met Arthur.<eos> How did you...
Nelson, we just uncovered the most massive digital invasion of privacy ever.<eos> So our black hat didn't target Isabel specifically, at least not at first.<eos> He hacked the entire WeDial network.<eos> He bundled his malware with a video chat software update.<eos> So any user who installed the update was instantly violated by the target and knew absolutely nothing about it.<eos> Any time they started a video chat, their conversations were redirected through the target's computer, allowing him to eavesdrop.<eos> All right, this is voyeurism.<eos> I mean, not in a classic sense.<eos> But our target is a cyber voyeur who became obsessed with Isabel after watching her on a computer and realized he couldn't have a relationship with Isabel in the real world, and ultimately killed her.<eos> Right, but if he didn't...
Okay, we can't go straight at this guy.<eos> He's not a scared truck driver.<eos> This guy is a shark.<eos> And if he sees us coming, Loksat's gonna burn all of us.<eos> We've got to track Brown's every move nice and quiet.<eos> It's gonna take time.<eos> Yeah, but if we do it right...<eos> He'll lead us straight to Loksat.<eos> I thought you said lying was wrong.<eos> I did.
And I'm not gonna do that to somebody else.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't.<eos> Hey, Hunt, um, I need to find a patient...<eos> Gabby Margraff.<eos> Oh, she's in surgery with Grey and Pierce.<eos> What do you need?<eos> I need to tell her her boyfriend's dead.<eos> He coded in the hallway.<eos> Well, how did he...
Even yours.<eos> I may not understand your gift, but I have experienced it.<eos> The night they tried to burn you at the stake, you came to me in what I thought was a dream.<eos> You told me about a ritual you did to bind us together.<eos> That's how I found you.<eos> It worked?<eos> Since then I've been sensing things you've sensed and feeling things that you've felt.<eos> I wanted to bring us closer.<eos> I'm sorry, I had no right to do it.<eos> No, you didn't.
There's something I thought you should see.<eos> Your favorite patient has a visitor.<eos> [baby fussing]<eos> Thanks.<eos> You did that.<eos> - Chief.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I just want to apologize.<eos> The whole baby thing...<eos> I didn't exactly...
A friend.<eos> How am I supposed to trust your judgment when you bring around a friend like that?<eos> Someone who gets into fights and breaks bottles and could get us shut down?<eos> He's not a bad guy, he's just going through a rough time.<eos> His judgment's a little impaired.<eos> I don't care about his judgment.<eos> I care about yours.<eos> Which in this case was nonexistent.<eos> I know, look, I...<eos> No, you clearly don't.
The Beast King never lets anyone off easy.<eos> enough fooling around.<eos> now's your chance.<eos> You guys smashed my ceiling!<eos> Humph. Fine.<eos> Then behold the true power - Aw man... - of the Beast--<eos> I got dirt in my special place.<eos> are you listening?<eos> Let me just shake this out.<eos> You done?
You decide to stay.<eos> You decide you need me, then you decide you don't.<eos> You decide we can talk.<eos> You decide we cannot.<eos> I don't want to talk because I know what you're gonna say!<eos> You're gonna say you love me but...<eos> - You don't know what I'm going to say!<eos> - I'm pretty sure I do.<eos> - It doesn't matter!<eos> You don't! - Fine!
Would you like to come with us, Sylvester?<eos> You're family.<eos> We'll see you soon, Walter.<eos> Sorry for discounting your plans for Megan as science fiction.<eos> You didn't want to lose her.<eos> Neither did we.<eos> Good night, son.<eos> D-Did I, uh... did I ever tell you about the time that, uh,<eos> Megan pulled the fire alarm to get me out of trouble at school?<eos> No, you never did that.
You still haven't said why you're in town.<eos> Hovercraft conference?<eos> Invisibility cloak expo?<eos> Oh, so close, but, you know, I don't work for Hogwarts anymore.<eos> I work for DARPA, and pretty much everything I do is, you know... Compartmented, yes.<eos> No work.<eos> So, just to get small talk out of the way:<eos> let's see, your dad is, uh, on a low salt diet, your aunt's become a lesbian, and the dog is eating his own poop.<eos> I have baggage.<eos> Yes, we do.
Can you hold?<eos> No, I don't have time.<eos> And you put me on hold.<eos> Find that machine yet?<eos> I'm working on it.<eos> Max is a special boy, Merri.<eos> A brilliant boy.<eos> We only have 90 minutes left.<eos> You don't think I know that?<eos> Yeah, yeah, sure you do.
Did you take all that from the tiny hands of little children?<eos> And this.<eos> Bevy, the razor's not in there.<eos> But it might be in here.<eos> I threw it away!<eos> You power-walked out of here like a panther!<eos> We couldn't find you!<eos> Well, this is...concerning.<eos> You -- you have another bag, don't you?<eos> She did.
No. Instead of delaying the inevitable, I say let's work together and stop him.<eos> Forever.<eos> You may never get a better chance.<eos> Track it down, even if it takes you all the way back to Austria.<eos> I expected you to be long gone.<eos> I should be, but my baggage<eos> - has proven impossible to locate. - Mm.<eos> I could leave a valet behind, but I'd rather keep these items at hand.<eos> - You understand.<eos> - I do.
No. I-I think it's just the box that the panels came in.<eos> Yeah, that's what I thought.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, look, says here you got to plug it into a junction box.<eos> Oh, do we have a junction box?<eos> I don't know what that is.<eos> And we're sure it's not that cardboard box?<eos> I-I don't think so.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't, either.
Police have the assailant in custody.<eos> His name is Dr. Lionel Gray, a genetic scientist at Seoul National University...<eos> This is what we're dealing with now?<eos> Decentralized cells.<eos> We have a tonnage issue with insanity in this country.<eos> And genius insanity, which is a dangerous combination.<eos> Attacking with a genetic slime that modifies cells, turning facial skin pigments into a hideous death mask.<eos> You know Memento Mori is going to try to top this.<eos> Even though Gray is in custody.<eos> I do.
No, you can't be here.<eos> The buyers are on their way.<eos> - Buyers?<eos> - Blomfeld's selling them to a third party.<eos> Get dressed.<eos> I need to get you three out of here.<eos> What about them?<eos> Put them in.<eos> What do we do when they wake up?<eos> How about they don't?
I'll help you with your love life.<eos> Are you like a love doctor?<eos> And this puppy is... ready to ship.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - So, um, you mentioned, uh, helping me with my love life.<eos> Oh. Well, that's easy one. I think you should...<eos> Hold out for something more magical, right?<eos> I should just wait for that special someone?<eos> No, I-I think you should say yes.<eos> You... okay. You do?
Did your mother know Anna?<eos> She used to spend every weekend with us.<eos> We did our homework together.<eos> She liked going out on Saturdays.<eos> With whom?<eos> Her boyfriend?<eos> I don't know.<eos> At what time did Anna usually come home?<eos> You have to help me.<eos> Often, she didn't.
What happened?<eos> Cher hates us too.<eos> We must be wrong.<eos> That's not the Cher, Max.<eos> It's a Cher impersonator.<eos> Then why do I have chills?<eos> I love Cher.<eos> I used to imagine she was my real mom and that one day she'd pick me up and take me away with her, and then we'd get matching see-through body stockings like normal mothers and daughters.<eos> Aw, that's so disturbing.<eos> Max, we did nothing wrong.
I mean, we-we can't believe that our little boy is dating.<eos> Mom.<eos> You remember when you used to want to marry me?<eos> - Mom.<eos> - Those were...<eos> Sorry... good times.<eos> Um, okay, so... to boobs.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did I just say "boobs"?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you did.
Osteosarcoma.<eos> It involves the frontal and the occipital bone.<eos> It's locally very aggressive.<eos> It's a lovely tumor.<eos> It's almost cute.<eos> Just plopped there.<eos> "Hello."<eos> He's waited 18 months for this kidney.<eos> We finally have one, and now he has cancer?<eos> What if he didn't?

Yeah, their pumpkin ravioli never disappoints.<eos> This has been really nice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We somehow managed to finish our meal without actually...<eos> Talking.<eos> Right.<eos> Talking.<eos> Do we need to, though?<eos> I-i want to.<eos> If you do.
Um, Dr. Nathan Riggs, this is Grey, Shepherd, this is hunt.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Riggs.<eos> Hunt!<eos> Hey.<eos> Yeah, we, um...<eos> Dr. Hunt and i go back a bit.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, I didn't realize.<eos> No. No [Scoffs] you didn't.
No one talks about my King Julien that way.<eos> Who are you, mask guy?<eos> You may call me "The Phantom of Club Moist."<eos> A little dramatic.<eos> [gasps] What are you doing?<eos> Hey, everybody.<eos> Like you all to meet my friend, King Julien.<eos> Say "Hi," Your Majesty.<eos> I don't have time to say hello. I'm the king.<eos> Old chunky-thighs Maurice does all the hi's for me.
_<eos> Stop, please!<eos> I don't know where he is!<eos> He's your brother.<eos> Of course you do.
- I told you...<eos> - We had to try.<eos> - Did we?<eos> He's not even close with his brother.<eos> We had to try.<eos> So now what?<eos> N-N-No, no, no, no...<eos> Thank you.<eos> _<eos> - Did you...
Uh, right.<eos> CT reveals three broken points on Margot's pelvis, 2.2 centimeters between the bone.<eos> Yep, definite compression injury.<eos> She's gonna need an ex-fix to immobilize the fracture and limit the bleed.<eos> You mean it will tamponade the venous bleed?<eos> That's very impressive, doctor.<eos> You do know your ortho.<eos> I want to apologize about before.<eos> It's not that I don't respect ortho.<eos> I do.
Jamie, how are you?<eos> We didn't miss the carolers, did we?<eos> You are right on time.<eos> And this doctor made Aidan an angel.<eos> Hi, I'm-I'm Dr. Harris.<eos> This is for you.<eos> She suggested we, uh, make one for Aidan in case you couldn't make it.<eos> That's so sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I nearly didn't, actually.
- Passes off the cash.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa! I didn't do a thing.<eos> Then stop giving us the runaround.<eos> I assume your eyes are open when you're sitting on your butt all day doing nothing.<eos> Hey, look, it's quiet here.<eos> Most of these units are owned by foreigners with big wallets looking to invest in Manhattan real estate.<eos> Hardly anyone even lives here.<eos> And her?<eos> Yeah, I sort of remember her going up one time but I never saw her come out.<eos> Maybe the night guy did.
So it's like Kiss, Marry, Kill.<eos> What is that?<eos> It's a game where you're given three people and you choose which one you'd kiss, marry, or kill.<eos> Well, my game is better, 'cause instead of marrying someone, you get to eat them.<eos> Let's just play.<eos> I'll start you off easy.<eos> Electric eel, pufferfish, shrimp.<eos> I wouldn't fight the eel, because I know it can generate enough current to kill a horse.<eos> So I'd eat the eel, fight the shrimp, and befriend the pufferfish, because it would be nice to have company on those days I feel bloated.<eos> Very well done.
And?<eos> Use it as you will.<eos> I want every penny back that belongs to me.<eos> Bill, my dear, thank goodness, I've been trying to get word to you all day.<eos> Is that right?<eos> I thought you should know, Mr Bucket is looking for you.<eos> Here, was he?<eos> A fleeting visit.<eos> Funny he came here looking, when all the time he knew where I lived.<eos> He did?
She starts crying, right?<eos> Don't you hate when they do that?<eos> She put it out there, then she takes it away?<eos> No. That's not right, Robby.<eos> - That's not right.<eos> - No.<eos> - She was taunting you. - Bad.<eos> That made you mad.<eos> Yeah. I don't like that.<eos> Yeah. No one does, Robby.
Yeah. We've met.<eos> I cannot possibly do this.<eos> Jade knows that guy.<eos> He's in one of her classes and she cannot stand him.<eos> He's an arrogant ass.<eos> Listen, you cannot go by what Jade told you.<eos> Your teacher recommended him highly.<eos> - He's horrible!<eos> - You don't know that!<eos> Yes, I do.
I mean, how is that possible?<eos> He's no more than 15, maybe 16, and he looked me right in the eye and made me feel like I had to give him my credentials.<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's something kinda weird about that kid.<eos> You know, you're really hitting a home run with this whole tutoring thing.<eos> You're not making any sense.<eos> I'm making total sense.<eos> You obviously just don't get what I'm trying to explain to you.<eos> When I took this job I thought you at least understood the basic concept.<eos> - I do. - No.
We're trying to save you from this prison.<eos> This isn't a prison.<eos> I made this world.<eos> Well, I sorta woke up here.<eos> - It's complicated.<eos> - What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying this is my home now, and I don't wanna be saved.<eos> - Sorry, Mabel.<eos> - No worries, bubble bear.<eos> - You did what?
It can cause heart failure and abnormal rhythms.<eos> Aubrey, we've noticed from your medical records that you've lost quite a few pounds over the last year.<eos> From diet and exercise.<eos> You don't have a prescription for thyroid medication, but we've known some girls to sneak their mom's pills.<eos> Do you have a prescription, Mrs. Clark?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I've never taken my mom's pills.<eos> The only thing I take are my vitamins.<eos> Mom, you believe me, right?<eos> Yes, honey, of course I do.
Where's all the stuff I actually asked you to buy?<eos> Oh, it all felt too American.<eos> Dave, kill the camera.<eos> You're not putting me in a position to succeed.<eos> So, this is some big-baby-ish reaction to me claiming your heritage isn't important to you?<eos> Oh, no.<eos> I'm simply sharing my culture with my family.<eos> Why?<eos> Does that bother you?<eos> Yeah. It does.
I didn't realize the dress was...<eos> Third-century Asian pimp?<eos> I thought you went to the Sportsmen's Lodge.<eos> I did, but that was a bust.<eos> Hundreds of drunk divorcees, and only two of them were ladies.<eos> It was quite a sausage fest.<eos> Ironically, they ran out of sausage.<eos> So I figured I'd take you up on your invite.<eos> I didn't invite you.<eos> Julie did.
Oh, the universe hates me.<eos> Don't hide from me.<eos> I see you.<eos> There you are.<eos> Yummy vanilla.<eos> Hiding behind the red velvet.<eos> We'll take these too, please.<eos> So, is that nice Mark boy still taking you to Monica's pool party?<eos> Not sure.<eos> We do weird phone call.
- No, he didn't.<eos> - Yes, he did.<eos> He did all that stuff.<eos> For you.<eos> You may think that you want a more glamorous life, you know, one with voice mails and a new car, but don't be so quick to throw away what you already have.<eos> 'Cause what you already have has been fighting for you all day.<eos> And if you have someone in your life that knows you're worth fighting for, then you're right, that's not a spark.<eos> Mrs. Glenn, that's a fire.<eos> H- how do I know he'll change?<eos> You don't.
I can't say I've done much.<eos> Until drugs corrupted the hell out of it, it was a great sport.<eos> You want to know why?<eos> It's one of the few sports that focuses on a team of individuals.<eos> You see, the cyclist needs the rest of his team to get out in front, provide a wake, so he can draft on them.<eos> I'm not sure I follow.<eos> You want Squad Three to be the best squad in the city, right?<eos> I do.<eos> And you have an idea, a vision, on how to make that happen, I assume?<eos> Of course you do.
I-I... He wanted to go out for dinner.<eos> I said no, but I just thought I should tell you.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You two are close.<eos> There is nothing going on between Sebastian and I.<eos> I mean, I'm a happily married woman.<eos> I know that.<eos> So, um, what-what's really going on?<eos> I don't...
This clotting matches the exact frequency of luminescence of the blood sampling extracted from Klarissa Mott's remains.<eos> Hmm, gotcha.<eos> I gave Klarissa everything.<eos> I gave her her start.<eos> I-I gave her her best material.<eos> L-Look, these were things that I didn't even share with my own son.<eos> And she promised me that she would spend her entire career here at the Palace.<eos> Now, I invested a lot in that girl.<eos> And she broke her promise to you.<eos> She did.
Is it getting hot in here?<eos> Mmm, mmm. See?<eos> The cookies are fine.<eos> Totally fine.<eos> Right, Max?<eos> Fine.<eos> Man!<eos> That was weird.<eos> I don't know what got into me.<eos> I do.
- I swear I did not have relations with that girl.<eos> - I never thought you did.<eos> - She knew the burner wasn't on.<eos> She put that bottle in my hand deliberately.<eos> I just can't figure out why she's doing this.<eos> - Maybe somebody put her up to it.<eos> Look, you want this taken care of,<eos> I can look into it.<eos> Just depends on your tolerance for getting down and dirty, Chief.<eos> - No, I didn't do nothing wrong.
You're not pizza.<eos> And you're not a twentyish white guy with dark hair.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Anybody else in here?<eos> There's a cat somewhere.<eos> We got played.<eos> Let's figure out how.<eos> Is this because I clicked on that porno mail?<eos> I didn't mean to.<eos> We never do.
- I have no place to live!<eos> - I don't know how to skip.<eos> I'm graduating in a year and a half, and I have no idea what I'm doing with my life!<eos> Mouthwash doesn't work on me.<eos> - Ugh!<eos> Okay, Dad, choose.<eos> - Yeah, Dad, who's it gonna be?<eos> Mike had to do something he never had to do in his whole life... pick between his two sons.<eos> So, he did the only thing a father could do in that situation.<eos> He didn't.
The blackout could be the Chernobyl of the power grid.<eos> Okay, I know that we can't divulge stuff, but I didn't know we'd moved on to spinning each other.<eos> I'm just giving you what the White House's official position is.<eos> Okay, let's try this:<eos> If it was us, was it in response to what happened on Air Force One?<eos> Solar flares happened on Air Force One.<eos> I was read in to that one.<eos> I know about the malware.<eos> Well... but not who was behind it, because we didn't know.<eos> And we do now?
Yeah. Uh, I was told that this was the scene of an apocalypse.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> What did I miss?<eos> Why don't I get some sodas for us?<eos> I'll be right back, guys.<eos> Okay. What is going on?<eos> Gabe showed up for the parole hearing.<eos> I thought you didn't want anyone there.<eos> No, I didn't.
I wanted to find you, but I guess you found me first.<eos> I know you, don't I?<eos> Uh, you remember?<eos> You were pretty small back then.<eos> I was the governor of Lothal.<eos> I supported your parents and the messages they beamed out against the Empire.<eos> It was part of the reason I was accused of treason and sent to prison with them.<eos> I do remember.<eos> Then you know what happened to them.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Back out.<eos> Are you fucking him again?<eos> I knew you'd ask that.<eos> - Well, are you?<eos> - No. No, I'm not.<eos> Do you believe me?<eos> You have to trust me, Noah.<eos> I want to do this for myself.<eos> I don't want to be a doctor.<eos> No? You don't?
- So why do you stay?<eos> - The money.<eos> - I need your help.<eos> - Name it.<eos> - My battalion chief is in legal trouble, some woman accusing him of assault.<eos> It's obviously a set-up, and we're pretty sure that Maddox is behind it.<eos> Her name is Serena Holmes.<eos> I need to find out if Maddox is paying her off.<eos> - I don't know anything about it.<eos> I honestly don't.
What's going on?<eos> Lily Coleman's grandmother called yesterday.<eos> Lily never came home.<eos> She's missing.<eos> Will your lawyer be joining us, Mr. Donovan?<eos> I don't need my damn lawyer.<eos> I just need y'all to let me up out of here.<eos> Well, the judge has ruled that you'll remain in custody pending the result of the new trial.<eos> You got nothing shows I killed those people.<eos> You never did.
By myself.<eos> We have got to spend more time together.<eos> Let's see what we got.<eos> All right, this is the box of evidence collected by Baltimore PD at the crime scene where they found the body.<eos> Looks like a blouse.<eos> All right. Now, there should be three more bags of clothing.<eos> Shoes, pants... undergarments.<eos> Good morning, Abby, Timothy.<eos> I understand from Mr. Palmer you have the Baltimore coroner's report.<eos> I do.
Nothing.<eos> Just came down to see how you're doing.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> What you working on?<eos> Well, I confirmed Baltimore Forensic's finding.<eos> The DNA on the needle does belong to Joy Vanatter.<eos> And then I ran the residue from inside the barrel through Major Mass Spec, and it's black tar heroin.<eos> It's a very cheap low-grade form of the narcotic.<eos> That's weird, 'cause Cheech said that Vanatter was using, um, high-grade heroin.<eos> He did.
"eat the sandwich and forget about her."<eos> Feelings!<eos> I didn't even cry at his funeral.<eos> You believe that?<eos> The guy was my whole world.<eos> Not a tear.<eos> Everybody looking at me like -- Like I didn't love him.<eos> But he knew.<eos> He had to know, right?<eos> Of course he did.
You're right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, anyway, uh, you just about ready to go see Gerald kicking ass at his new job?<eos> Uh... yes. Oh, that's right.<eos> We're going to Jimmy's.<eos> That's perfect.<eos> Love is a gamble, right?<eos> We're just two gamblers, rolling the dice, you know?<eos> Yeah. You got to roll the dice, right? - You have to.<eos> - You do.
But something inside of her told her to believe me.<eos> That's where it started.<eos> A pact of honor.<eos> An unspoken agreement... that I would take on a burden that wasn't part of my mission.<eos> It was just the right thing to do.<eos> And now you come here to engage me in one of these agreements.<eos> If she goes back to Sudan, she'll die.<eos> You know that.<eos> No.<eos> No, I-I don't.
Could... could you just go...<eos> Okay. It wasn't clear.<eos> No, I didn't... I didn't know... I mean, I didn't know if it was the trip or his family...<eos> Phil.<eos> It was the trip, right?<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> You saved my ass.<eos> Oh, it's all good. [Sighs]<eos> - So, how do you know Jeff Scarborough?<eos> - I don't.
Uh... the results of which might be slightly upsetting, but...<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh. Melissa and Carol found this for me.<eos> It's for surgery students.<eos> It's got, like, guts and skin and appendix... every-everything I need.<eos> So you won't be needing a cadaver?<eos> Hardly knew her.<eos> Boom.<eos> Why, did you find one?<eos> No, we did... uh, no, we did not.
Used to.<eos> Then I really got into Brutal Mercy.<eos> Which is where you connected with the defendant.<eos> Yeah, TheAlgea.<eos> Yeah, that's his screen name.<eos> The Greek spirits of pain and suffering.<eos> I liked that.<eos> You also liked his plan to "KSR" Lucy Van Gaal.<eos> I did.<eos> I still do.
- Judge!<eos> - Save it, Matan.<eos> As a matter of law, I find there was insufficient evidence to support a conviction here, so I am vacating the jury's verdict and entering a judgment of acquittal.<eos> Come.<eos> Mrs. Florrick.<eos> How else can I help you?<eos> What you did up there...<eos> Your Honor, we earned that, right?<eos> That wasn't about what I said in here earlier?<eos> - Because I didn't...
I didn't.<eos> Who else could it be?<eos> One of the two other people who were in the room when you told me.<eos> I once had a torrid love affair with Charo.<eos> Rogelio!<eos> I-I'm so sorry for doubting you.<eos> But now we can continue to develop our friendship.<eos> I don't want to be friends with you.<eos> Rogelio, you don't know one thing about me.<eos> Yes, I do.
That is to say, they matched it to somebody in the data bank who they didn't know was in there.<eos> And that somebody was Gregory Allen.<eos> I feel free.<eos> When I left the prison, the anger left.<eos> It was gone.<eos> It stayed there, behind them gates.<eos> It didn't come out with me.<eos> I was happy when I got out.<eos> I probably was the happiest man on the Earth.<eos> - How you doing? - Oh, hello.
Like, what kind of factors?<eos> Like, it's a three-month commitment, Hailey.<eos> I know.<eos> You told me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just talked to the producers, and they said that if I take this, I can't have any contact with the outside world, so...<eos> I can't... talk to my parents or friends or see you.<eos> Well, that's really lame, but I think that you should do it.<eos> This is a really good opportunity for you.<eos> You do?
Do you mind if I plug in?<eos> [classical music playing] See, you don't buy bloody naming rights for some cross-promotional bullshit.<eos> You do it to let the music live.<eos> "La Boheme."<eos> "La Boheme," beautiful, and your name should take its rightful place along the great patrons in history,<eos> Emperor Franz-Joseph,<eos> Cosimo de Medici,<eos> Juan Luis Delgado.<eos> Juan Luis de Medici, I like it.<eos> Oh, fucking A, you do.
- You fell in love?<eos> - No! No, no, no, no.<eos> No, I- - I was-- I got cursed.<eos> - Is it not the same thing?<eos> - No, it's not the same--<eos> I mean, between you and me, yes, but between normal people, it's not the same.<eos> It's something else.<eos> Maestro Rivera, he asked me to go back to Mexico and take his place.<eos> - You accepted?<eos> - No, I did not.
Exactly.<eos> Thank you, boss.<eos> Howler monkey?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> You know, primates are fascinating.<eos> I've been watching a lot of Discovery Channel.<eos> Did you know that...<eos> That there's a dead Marine in an alley?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> And now you do, too.
You have any complications?<eos> A few bloops and bleeps.<eos> No complications.<eos> Listen, you should be discharged by now.<eos> Who's the idiot who ordered the 2-D echo?<eos> You can't be too careful, you know.<eos> Oh, so you're the idiot?<eos> You ordered your own test?<eos> 23% of people who have a first heart attack have a second one.<eos> 77% don't.
Suing.<eos> Two weeks before I was released from jail, investigators were gonna bring in pictures to show me of Teresa's body and how it was burnt, and there was still muscle tissues on the bones.<eos> There was a lot of pressure they were putting on me to turn against Steven.<eos> I've been doing this job a long time.<eos> I've met a lot of interesting people, a lot of people that are similar to Steve.<eos> But I've never met somebody as cold-blooded... as him.<eos> To think what he did to that girl.<eos> Sit and think about that for a minute.<eos> - Think about her family.<eos> - Oh, I do all the time.
Even the top dog sheriff has to sign a log like this, right?<eos> You should, yes, if you're going by that checkpoint, yes.<eos> Well, unless you were eluding the checkpoint in some way, you would really have to sign in, wouldn't you?<eos> Correct.<eos> All right, so the log shows that Lieutenant Lenk signed out at 10:41 p.m. - on Saturday, November 5th.<eos> Correct?<eos> - Yes, if this is all November 5th. Yes.<eos> Well, if you take a minute and look through there and show me where Lieutenant Lenk signed in.<eos> Do you see an entry that Lieutenant Lenk signed in anywhere on that log on November 5th?<eos> No, sir, I did not.
- Probably Steven.<eos> - No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.
- No, not "probably." Who did?<eos> If you know, you need to tell me.<eos> You were over there.<eos> - Steven did.<eos> - Did you see him do it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No, honestly, yes or no, did you see him do it?<eos> Don't lie about it.<eos> If you did, good.<eos> If you didn't, good.
Has anyone ever told you you're a handsome young man?<eos> Me?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Oh, yes. One time.<eos> - Ah!<eos> A photographer.<eos> I ordered a dozen portraits.<eos> He said, "You're such a handsome young man.<eos> "Get three dozen."<eos> So I did.
Are you there?<eos> Yes, I'm coming up.<eos> Be careful not to fall.<eos> My God, what a night!<eos> What a night.<eos> - What's wrong? Your eye?<eos> - I hit myself pretty good, huh?<eos> - Do you believe in ghosts?<eos> - No.<eos> I didn't either.
Gerda, I want to be a woman, not a painter.<eos> Well, people have been known to do both.<eos> I'm curious to see what you would paint.<eos> That's all.<eos> Sometimes it's hard to know what's in your...<eos> Didn't you just take one of those a minute ago?<eos> Gerda, I know what I'm doing.<eos> I'm just going to get some fresh air.<eos> You know, sometimes I do wonder why you let me go through all this, if you thought that everything would be the same afterwards.<eos> I didn't.
I cannot bear it, Chiron.<eos> I'm sick of living.<eos> The gods save me!<eos> What would have happened had I not just now returned?<eos> You were gone for days, with not a word to me.<eos> I'm sorry, Princess.<eos> There was a reason.<eos> You say this to me... as if I'm blind to the moon's phase.<eos> I know what's in store.<eos> No, you don't.
Really?<eos> You said that was going to be my car when I turned 16.<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> I never said that. I remember.<eos> I was in third grade and you were taking me over to Anthony Nadar's house for his birthday, and we were there early, so we gave him a ride around the block, and he was talking about how much he loved your car,<eos> and so you were all like, "This is gonna be Mason's when he turns 16."<eos> All right, first off, I have no memory of that, all right?<eos> Second of all, I would never say that.<eos> You did, though.
Jim!<eos> Big time! Look at you!<eos> Mom's not home. This is my dad.<eos> Mark.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Jim! The cool guy from the safari.<eos> Do you wanna "bowl" me a few pitches?<eos> I'm sure your father wants to do that with you.<eos> No, he doesn't.
We have three days.<eos> Tusk!<eos> Dependable as death you are!<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> A Boggart!<eos> Subterranean beast.<eos> Nasty temperament.<eos> Blind as a bat.<eos> How do you fight a Boggart?<eos> You don't!
My father didn't leave much behind.<eos> Richard?<eos> I didn't kill your son.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Look, I think the cops have been lying to us both all along.<eos> Where's my shoe?<eos> The cops are up to something, right?<eos> Something to do with your son, with you.<eos> Why do they want you dead? How should I know?<eos> Same reason you do.
I shouldn't have said that to you.<eos> I apologies.<eos> Sir. Sir...<eos> Sir.<eos> This is yours.<eos> This is yours.<eos> Oh no. Come on.<eos> I'm packed too.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Jai, whether anyone does anything or not.
For the better part of a decade, a San Francisco Bay-area drug ring sold tons of cocaine... to the Crips and Bloods street gangs of Los Angeles and funneled millions... in drug profits to Latin American guerrilla army run<eos> by the US Central Intelligence Agency... a Mercury news investigation has found.<eos> This drug network opened the first pipeline between Columbia and...<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> You did it.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Want to go fool around in the woods?<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Yes, I do.

And when it does, the eagle always sees.<eos> This... park business seems to be picking up speed.<eos> Now that Rockefeller's thrown in with them, they're making real offers.<eos> - They'll be coming to us next?<eos> Rockefeller's $5 million behind them.<eos> We're not interested.<eos> Well, I was asking your husband's opinion, Mrs Pemberton, not yours.<eos> Easy.<eos> Well, I don't want you to worry about it.<eos> Well, I do.
What kind of a name is that anyway?<eos> He said he was Kenyan.<eos> - What's your connection to him?<eos> - I only met him once at a coffee shop.<eos> - The rest was through the mails.<eos> - When was that?<eos> - Two years ago. - You've been prescribing a rare, potent drug to somebody you met once in a coffee shop two years ago?<eos> He had medical records. He was representing someone else, but the name had been redacted.<eos> You have no knowledge of who's actually using this drug?<eos> None whatsoever, but I did nothing wrong.
45. 38.<eos> It was too late.<eos> Fundamentalism, - Mr. Lake, of the prophet...<eos> - 170.<eos> - ...was social justice!<eos> - 38. Better schools, better jobs, Mr. Lake.<eos> This doesn't just... just end.<eos> Are you still a believer?<eos> Hmm? Do you still believe?<eos> I don't.
- Tim Leitch from FEAR. - Tim Leitch from FEAR.<eos> - The guy from Dead Moon.<eos> - Andrew Loomis.<eos> And the guy from The Wipers, Sam Henry.<eos> So if you think about it, Portland's kind of like a haven for legendary punk drummers, right?<eos> That's a good point.<eos> Mia, your man knows his punk rock history.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Oh, God, something just stung me.<eos> Who does that?
Hey, little man. Look at this room.<eos> You got the best place in the joint.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> That's right.<eos> You just get some rest.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Hey, I just got here.<eos> They're saying he's through the worst of it.<eos> They were assigning his room, so, I thought I'd come here before I checked in on Kat and Den...<eos> They didn't...
No, I didn't think so.<eos> And Jack Witkowski isn't the kind of guy to forgive and forget.<eos> He'd find a way to get to you before we could even bring you to trial.<eos> I've tried to arrest him for two years.<eos> He's got ties to the police.<eos> Someone who turns a blind eye to what he does.<eos> There are some people in Scotland Yard that think that Jack is doing us a service.<eos> He kills his fair share of bad people.<eos> They believe that one in the hand is worth five in the street. Think they can... control him.<eos> But you don't.
I mean, The Man Up Show? Are you kidding?<eos> You've listened to it, right?<eos> It's asinine.<eos> No.<eos> You were his boy.<eos> And as far as he was concerned, the sun rose and set on you and your siblings.<eos> You're gonna be okay.<eos> - I know.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> But I do.
As soon as we realized what was happening, we called the police.<eos> - As soon as you realized?<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> You called the police?<eos> These are the phone records from that night.<eos> According to these records... the only call, to the police, made from this office, took place at 8:53 PM.<eos> Sam, that feed went live at 8:30 PM.<eos> Fuck.<eos> Do you know who I am?<eos> Yeah, of course I do, you crazy bastard.
- We've been very bad, you know. - Mmm.<eos> - We're going to get a terrible report.<eos> - Mother won't be surprised.<eos> - She thinks she has a very odd daughter.<eos> - Not odd.<eos> Just interesting.<eos> I've never known where I fit.<eos> Does it need to be a place?<eos> Well, I don't know what to say to the pair of you!<eos> No, really, I don't!
a generation.<eos> - I am prepared to fight for that long.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I thought we were making progress.<eos> Now, you're impatient.<eos> After 400 years of slavery.<eos> Am I the only one sitting here who's done nothing about this until now?<eos> I do know a few things about military action.<eos> Still, if you're not going to listen to me, then why did you take me away from my family?<eos> I didn't.
Come on, make some romance Sing a happy song<eos> - Hey, Jer, give me a break.<eos> - Okay, I'll tone it down a little bit.<eos> You have the greatest hair, Tom.<eos> In the back, it's awesome.<eos> Shift's over, Jer.<eos> - Jerry?<eos> - Hi. Fiona.<eos> You said I should come by accounting some time.<eos> - I did? - Yeah.
When she's through playing with you, she's going to... take you apart like a cheap Christmas toy.<eos> I was up for the position at Westcott and Louise wouldn't give me the job, so I met with her and then I turned on all the charm.<eos> I was desperate. I had to.<eos> She wasn't going to give you the job?<eos> No, that's what I just said.<eos> I know, but why? Had she seen you before?<eos> Was it something about...<eos> It was possible that I might not have been the strongest candidate that they were looking at, but I had other things to offer, which I let her know, wink wink.<eos> She just wasn't going to give it to me. I wasn't their top candidate.<eos> Well, how did...
"I'm old enough to have a kid who can drive?"<eos> My God!<eos> Does he know about me and you?<eos> No, no, God, no.<eos> He knows I used to teach and sometimes he asks why I stopped, you know, but...<eos> What do you tell him?<eos> That it wasn't my thing.<eos> - I'm sorry, Rich.<eos> - No, Milo, you don't ever have to apologize.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
So we lose 12 to zero, and that's a bridge?<eos> He asked for you.<eos> Wants you to be his second.<eos> He respects you.<eos> You're the only one who ever beat Spassky.<eos> We were young. He'd destroy me now.<eos> And you've beaten Bobby.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> Bobby has problems.<eos> So did Mozart.
When I walked into a place, people sat up.<eos> They sat up straight.<eos> They noticed.<eos> What'd you ever have?<eos> And the fucking bar stool you put that old biddy at.<eos> You bought her free drinks and don't think I don't know that you did it on purpose?<eos> That was my stool and nobody sat on that stool because it was Cousin Marv's stool.<eos> And that meant something.<eos> That meant something!<eos> But it didn't.
- So you... - Yeah. - ...killed him.<eos> - Yeah, I did.<eos> I shot him in the face, twice.<eos> Then I wrapped his head in a towel and stabbed him in the heart... so he would bleed out, put him in my bathtub and watched him drain.<eos> Then I put him in an oil tank... with laundry detergent and lye and sealed it back up.<eos> Want to know what his name was?<eos> It's 2:00, Bob. It's 2:00.<eos> His name.<eos> - I would not know, Bob.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I don't really give a shit.<eos> Like I said, things don't change much in Woodbury, but every now and then, we need to be reminded that change can be good.<eos> The pharmacy had a whole new look, and I wanted to see it for myself.<eos> Ma'am, are you finding everything all right?<eos> Yes. Yes, I am.<eos> And may I say this pharmacy has the most impressive collection of douches I have ever seen.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> High blood pressure, acid reflux, chlamydia.<eos> Never would have guessed.<eos> No one ever does.
Everything depends on the man.<eos> Maybe we let, uh, Chavez starve himself to death, then we won't have to do anything.<eos> Unfortunately, I don't think he is the suicidal type.<eos> Ma!<eos> I'm gonna leave some more stuff here.<eos> Mostly clothes I don't wear anymore.<eos> Mom, what's wrong?<eos> Does he know what he's doing to you?<eos> No.<eos> He doesn't.
I volunteered.<eos> I'm not walking away.<eos> You die here.<eos> Right here.<eos> I can't save you.<eos> And if I go on and kill the Omega, you're dead.<eos> Forever.<eos> Why does it matter what happens to me?<eos> I wish... I didn't know you.<eos> But I do.
There he is, Mama!<eos> What?<eos> Who, Almitra? Where?<eos> Mustafa!<eos> There!<eos> I'm sorry, my little one, but he's...<eos> No, look! On the ship!<eos> See?<eos> I do, Almitra.<eos> I do.
Did Drago or his trappers do this, too?<eos> The crazy thing is... I'm actually the one who shot him down.<eos> Hey, it's okay, though. He got me back! Right, bud?<eos> You couldn't save all of me, could you?<eos> You just had to make it even.<eos> So, peg leg!<eos> What did your father think of your Night Fury friend?<eos> He didn't take it all that well.<eos> But then he changed.<eos> They all did.
Stop!<eos> You'll only make it worse!<eos> It was a very unpopular opinion.<eos> Hiccup!<eos> Then, one night, a dragon broke into our house... finding you in the cradle.<eos> I rushed to protect you.<eos> But what I saw... was proof of everything I believed.<eos> This wasn't a vicious beast... but an intelligent, gentle creature... whose soul... reflected my own.<eos> Valka, run!<eos> Don't!
Your boys failed, yes, but the contest did not.<eos> If it doesn't work, it will ruin our relationship with Major League Baseball and the scouts.<eos> It will jeopardize the future of our investment.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I have to do this, Mr. Chang.<eos> If you do this, you do it without my support and without my future commitment.<eos> I understand.<eos> Good day, gentlemen.<eos> And for the record, Mr. Chang, my boys didn't fail.<eos> I did.
Why don't you wear gloves and a face mask?<eos> Never have and I never will.<eos> And I'm still here.<eos> Why is all the food sitting outside their rooms like this?<eos> - It's getting cold.<eos> - It's always cold because the appropriate staff won't bring it into the rooms, so it sits and rots until one of my staff can.<eos> I know him.<eos> Can I go inside with you?<eos> Only if you wear all the protective shit.<eos> If you don't, I don't.
- When?<eos> - He'll answer me.<eos> - When?<eos> ! There's 110 new cases this month!<eos> Still no meeting with our gay mayor.<eos> No meeting with his gay assistant.<eos> What?<eos> Do I embarrass you, Bruce?<eos> Yes.<eos> You do.
What am I supposed to do?<eos> Throw it away in the trash can?<eos> I won't do that.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> That's too final.<eos> Last year I had five cards.<eos> Now I have 50.<eos> A collection of cardboard tombstones, bound together with a rubber band.<eos> I hate these fuckin' funerals.<eos> I really do.
Black hair?<eos> No.<eos> No, he has brown hair.<eos> Does he have a scar?<eos> - A scar?<eos> - Yeah. He had a skiing accident.<eos> He should have a scar across the right side of his face.<eos> Chrissy?<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't.
You were married but you've been apart for four years.<eos> She's awake.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Christine. It's Ben.<eos> Your Ben.<eos> If I'd have known you were in any kind of danger, I'd never have stayed away.<eos> I had to. For Adam's sake.<eos> He's our son, Chris.<eos> And he loves you very much.<eos> We both do.
No. No, sir.<eos> I wrapped my little nubs around it and I squeezed until that devil didn't have any fight left.<eos> Do you know why I did that?<eos> Why?<eos> Because if I did not, the safety of my entire family was in jeopardy.<eos> Do I make myself clear?<eos> Hey, uh, by the way, did you see the polls tonight?<eos> That's pretty superb, huh?<eos> I don't think you understand me.<eos> I certainly do, sir.
You don't understand.<eos> I call Vickie.<eos> -Wait, wait, wait, no, no, no...<eos> Wait, don't do that. You need to go.<eos> It's ringing.<eos> It's all very confusing.<eos> And it's... Confusing.<eos> Very.<eos> -You know, Josh knows about us now.<eos> -He does?
Pacquiao nails him with a long looping right.<eos> And another left.<eos> They're really slamming it out but Rocil is getting a bad beating from Pacquiao here.<eos> The crowd is roaring on its feet.<eos> Rocil is slowly getting up, no...<eos> He has been counted out.<eos> His opponents were, very often, much bigger. They looked much bigger than him.<eos> Every time he entered the ring, then I get scared.<eos> "Can he do this? Can he handle this guy?"<eos> And, he did. Amazingly, he did.
How does it feel to be promoted?<eos> Feels great, Ben.<eos> I thought no one was allowed to leave.<eos> I said we're not allowed to leave.<eos> They're different, they're runners.<eos> They know more about the maze than anyone.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> What?<eos> What? You just said "maze."<eos> I did?
You know, Bigfoot, man. Can we just try to be fucking professional?<eos> I mean, just pretend to be professional.<eos> Shasta Fay Hepworth. She's gone.<eos> Fuck you.<eos> Doc could never figure out what Shasta might've seen in him... besides being just about the only doper she knew who didn't use heroin... freeing up a lot of time for both of them.<eos> And it wasn't any clearer about what had driven them apart either.<eos> They each gradually located a different karmic thermal... watching the other glide away into different fates.<eos> Does it ever end?<eos> Of course it does.<eos> It did.
Where have you been?<eos> Everyone's asking about you.<eos> I was in Poughkeepsie.<eos> It seems like you made a whole lot of stuff up.<eos> Now, people have criticized me and some of my colleagues, saying that we were pretending to be objective when there is no objectivity.<eos> Okay, we were trying to capture truth, but the truth of experience...<eos> I don't wanna miss his speech.<eos> You know, it's your responsibility to be honest.<eos> People are gonna believe it.<eos> I didn't do anything nobody else does.
- Obviously. I fucked you. - You fucked what?<eos> You called it fucking?<eos> I didn't call it fucking.<eos> - Don't treat me like some random chick!<eos> - You better control it.<eos> - No, you control it. - Control it.<eos> You control it.<eos> Stop it.<eos> - You control it.<eos> - Don't.
- Happy birthday!<eos> - There we go.<eos> Wait a minute, baby, is this cake chocolate?<eos> Chocolate cake, chocolate icing, chocolate filling.<eos> Yeah, but I'm allergic to chocolate.<eos> I know.<eos> I fucking love you.<eos> Did you just say, "I love you"?<eos> No, I didn't finish my sentence, is what I did.<eos> Yes, you did.
I'll sit back and wait till I'm needed, then, eh?<eos> We good? Yeah.<eos> Let's do it. Yeah?<eos> Michael, long time no see ya, man.<eos> You brought a friend?<eos> Yes. This is my DI, David Knight.<eos> He's running the operation on you.<eos> I think it's best if we all have a chat.<eos> I've explained to David how we've been working so far. And now we want to work out something a bit more interesting.<eos> Do you?
I've said if...<eos> They do what we want, we'll leave them well alone.<eos> I've no idea what you're talking about.<eos> The deal we've discussed.<eos> Didn't discuss anything with ya.<eos> Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Is this a fucking joke or what?<eos> That's not...<eos> What you doing, David?<eos> What you doing?
- Every day I look at that and...<eos> - I did that.<eos> - You what?<eos> - I did that.<eos> What, you wrote that?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're a fucking terrorist, ain't you?<eos> They knock about together.<eos> Really? How do you know him?<eos> I don't, really.
Take your feet off the dash.<eos> All right, I have a question for you, which you do not have to answer.<eos> I feel like, if you don't answer it though,<eos> - you're kind of answering it, you know.<eos> - What?<eos> Was that your first kiss since 1945?<eos> - That bad, huh?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> Well, it kind of sounds like that's what you're saying.<eos> No, I didn't.
Shut up!<eos> I'm not gonna fight you.<eos> You're my friend.<eos> You're my mission.<eos> You're my mission!<eos> Then finish it.<eos> Because I'm with you to the end of the line.<eos> On your left.<eos> Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
- Did you not hear the lady?<eos> - Mind your business.<eos> - Stop!<eos> - What are you deaf or just a dick?<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> What does it say up here?<eos> "Deaf" or "dick"?<eos> Help me out.<eos> Stop! Leave him alone!<eos> Don't!
- He's dying.<eos> And he thinks the only thing going to save his life is my blood, Spider-Man's blood.<eos> As far as I know, if I gave it to him, it could kill him.<eos> I'm saying worse.<eos> This is the maintenance closet, Gwen.<eos> This is the most cliche hiding place you could have chosen.<eos> I'm...sorry.<eos> This is the stupidest hiding place. Take us to the Bahamas hiding place.<eos> I don't want to talk to you about England is because...<eos> I don't...
Mr. Osborn.<eos> Look up.<eos> I think you're looking for me.<eos> I cannot believe my eyes.<eos> Spider-Man.<eos> Just the man I wanted to see.<eos> - You...err...talked to Peter?<eos> - Yeap.<eos> I want to help you, Mr. Osborn.<eos> I really, really do.
- The jaded lawyer... with no respect for the law. That's original.<eos> That's me?<eos> I respect the law just fine. I'm just not in awe of it.<eos> I'm not encumbered by it.<eos> If the great state of Illinois can't meet its burden of proof... if I walk with a guilty client, it's on you.<eos> So I suggest you do your job, Kattan.<eos> Now, if you'd like to finish that cliché you followed me into the pisser to unload...<eos> Did it involve my reflection?<eos> Maybe sleeping at night, how do I do it?<eos> I do it on a Tempur-Pedic bed, in a Highland Park home... with a Ferrari, next to a loving wife... with the ass of a high-school volleyballer.
- I'm parked up...<eos> Tried to get a space in the big lot. I had to go around.<eos> - But eventually I found one.<eos> - Here you go.<eos> - Where's the family?<eos> - Couldn't make it.<eos> School.<eos> Oh. I didn't know kids in Chicago go to school in the summer.<eos> There isn't.<eos> They just do...
Okay, so you're gonna swear in, hand to God... and lie under oath that you remember hitting him?<eos> I won't confess to something I don't remember doing, okay?<eos> - You promise?<eos> Thank you. - Yes.<eos> - I'll see you in court. - I'm sorry.<eos> I just...<eos> I'll see you in court.<eos> Judge Palmer.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth... and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
I have her.<eos> Let me go, Charles.<eos> There.<eos> You see?<eos> Secret service man left to the stage.<eos> -Got it.<eos> -Go.<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> I didn't tell you to activate it.<eos> I didn't.
- Here's your mermaid costume.<eos> - What?<eos> We need a diversion.<eos> And, frankly, you're the only one who can pull off that look.<eos> But I can do more, Skipper.<eos> I want to help the team.<eos> Really help the team.<eos> If you think I'm ready, which I am.<eos> Assuming you agree.<eos> And perhaps even... if you don't?
Does this hurt?<eos> Ouch.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ooh.<eos> Still hurts. How many bad guys were there?<eos> Two, but the little girl, she could really fight.<eos> She?<eos> What?<eos> You said she.<eos> No, I didn't.
What my child's telling me will get me laughed out of this town.<eos> That's what I'm saying. I don't know what to preach.<eos> I don't have anything to say.<eos> Just speak from the heart, Todd, like you always do.<eos> What about fear do we struggle with?<eos> Is it confusion?<eos> Is it doubt?<eos> Is it questions?<eos> I got questions.<eos> We all do.
I loved my grandfather very much.<eos> He was there with me when my father couldn't be.<eos> He taught me to weld.<eos> He gave me that slingshot.<eos> I know.<eos> We play with it.<eos> That's right.<eos> And he was a good man.<eos> He was a really good man, but I don't know what he believed in.<eos> None of us did.
- Turn around. ...nine, 10...<eos> Turn around!<eos> Maisey... you're safe.<eos> Maisey.<eos> Come here, honey.<eos> I know I might look scary, but... I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> Come sit with me.<eos> It's over.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?
- I was gonna leave without you.<eos> - There's no turning back now.<eos> - I'm doing it.<eos> - You're doing it.<eos> I can do this!<eos> So, watch...<eos> Watch your fingers when you shut the canopy.<eos> Okay.<eos> Do you see the joystick between your leg?<eos> Yes, I do...
- You know?<eos> Maybe one of these nights, we'll have sex instead of watching Project Runway. We'll TiVo Project Runway.<eos> That's probably why they invented TiVo. So people could have sex.<eos> I still don't get it.<eos> Why do we keep having all of these days? And then, going to bed at night? And then, having all of these days?<eos> Well, that's sort of what life is.<eos> When will it end?<eos> It won't.<eos> - Well, it'll end when we die.<eos> - Don't do that, buddy. Okay?
What? No!<eos> I knew it! I knew it!<eos> There's so many things about you that I still love.<eos> -Can I have a Scotch and soda, please?<eos> -Cameron.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> I still believe in you.<eos> And I don't wanna give up. I don't.<eos> -But I can't. I can't.<eos> -What? Did you even...?
But no one's going to saw off their heads, are they?<eos> Nobody's going to blow up their kids because you're on a beach in Bali or riding a train to school in Madrid or London.<eos> How fucking dare you?<eos> How fucking dare me?<eos> Tell me I've broken every rule in the book?<eos> That I've trampled on the essence of the constitution?<eos> You want to spout that crap?<eos> Yes?<eos> Do you know where you are?<eos> No, you don't.
- That is also true!<eos> - Hold on!<eos> Hold on!<eos> Keep calling me vermin, tough guy!<eos> You just wanna laugh at me like everyone else!<eos> Rocket, you're drunk.<eos> All right?<eos> No one's laughing at you.<eos> He thinks I'm some stupid thing!<eos> He does!
Which I can disable by dismantling the power source.<eos> We'll make it to the flight deck, and I'll use the Hadron Enforcer to kill Ronan.<eos> Once Ronan is dead, we will retrieve the Stone. Use these devices to contain it.<eos> If you touch it, it will kill you.<eos> I'll contact one of the Nova officers who arrested us.<eos> Hopefully, they'll believe we're there to help.<eos> There's one more thing we need to complete the plan.<eos> That guy's eye.<eos> No!<eos> No, we don't.
- Make that two, please.<eos> God.<eos> - Nancy, right?<eos> Gwen.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Thank God for you.<eos> Girl doesn't show up and leaves me to handle two cabins.<eos> You're a lifesaver.<eos> If I pass out, just promise to catch me before I hit the floor.<eos> Not if I do first.
No that's...<eos> You know if the Thornhills want quality give them quality.<eos> We don't pimp no Numbers trash.<eos> We've come up in the world like Kratsov.<eos> You wanna go downstairs kidnap some s-s-skirt and get s-s-snuffed like Kratsov?<eos> For what?<eos> Plenty of little chickens out there we can get for a handful of f-f-feed.<eos> See that's why I run this operation.<eos> You don't know nothing about retail markup.<eos> And you do.
I've got to go.<eos> Conrad had often professed that he led a life of the mind.<eos> Unfortunately for him, his mind had been damaged by years of abandonment, philandering, Tom Collins, and a two-pack-per-day nicotine habit, not to mention an unhealthy Oedipal complex.<eos> The weight of his guilt had finally become too heavy.<eos> The incessant charade could go on no longer.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Where were you?<eos> You left me in the concert.<eos> You stayed, huh?<eos> Actually, I did.
I have to go back to work.<eos> Can I have one hour?<eos> I just need one hour.<eos> One hour.<eos> Yeah, thanks. I'll be right here.<eos> I hate surprises.<eos> You're going to like this one.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> It's for both of us. Don't get too excited.<eos> You didn't.
I prefer to have my own office.<eos> You're a team, and you will work as one.<eos> I don't have time to explain myself as I go along, and... I'm afraid these men would only slow me down.<eos> If you can't play together, then I'm afraid we can't let you play at all.<eos> This is Stewart Menzies, MI6.<eos> There are only five divisions of military intelligence.<eos> Exactly.<eos> That's the spirit.<eos> Mr. Turing, do you know how many British servicemen have died because of Enigma?<eos> - No, I don't.
So, I can give these men orders now?<eos> I hate to say it, but yes. Excellent.<eos> Keith and Charles, you're both fired.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - What?<eos> You're mediocre linguists, and positively poor code-breakers.<eos> Alan, you can't just fire Keith and Charles.<eos> - Well, he just said I could.<eos> - No, I did no such thing.<eos> But Churchill did.
- It's about cryptography.<eos> - Like secret messages?<eos> Not secret.<eos> That's the brilliant part.<eos> Messages that anyone can see, but no one knows what they mean unless you have the key.<eos> How's that different from talking?<eos> - Talking?<eos> - When people talk to each other, they never say what they mean.<eos> They say something else, and you're expected to just know what they mean.<eos> Only I never do.
Turn that thing off.<eos> No.<eos> Don't, please.<eos> Please.<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> No!<eos> No. No!<eos> Well, then, it seems that your great big expensive machine doesn't work.<eos> - It does. - Wonderful.
I'll not be... fixing your lamb all day while you come home from the office.<eos> I'll work.<eos> You'll work.<eos> And we'll have each other's company.<eos> We'll have each other's minds.<eos> That sounds like a better marriage than most.<eos> Because I care for you.<eos> And you care for me.<eos> And we understand one another more than... more than anyone else ever has.<eos> I don't.

And people... talk about the war as this epic battle between... civilizations... freedom versus tyranny, democracy versus Nazism, armies of millions bleeding into the ground, fleets of ships weighing down the oceans, planes dropping bombs from the sky until they obliterated the sun itself... the war wasn't like that for us.<eos> For us, it was just... half a dozen crossword enthusiasts in a tiny village in the South of England.<eos> This is... your victory.<eos> Victory... of the cause of freedom in every land.<eos> This is a solemn but glorious hour.<eos> I wish that Franklin D. Roosevelt had lived to see this day.<eos> Was I God?<eos> No. Because...<eos> God didn't win the war.<eos> We did.
- Checking that tail number now.<eos> - That's Kimmo's Safari.<eos> - That's our bird.<eos> Get that camera tracking north, - in the direction the helo is flying.<eos> There! On that mountain top.<eos> Lock on it.<eos> Jesus Christ. It's the President.<eos> Who the hell is that?<eos> Anyone here got an ID?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He loves an image of me.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> Tuck... What happens if I get a divorce?<eos> I think we both know that you'd never be able to come back here and...<eos> Your children would suffer the most.<eos> They are heirs to a European throne, Grace.<eos> And add to that the fact that you would have been a failure as a Princess.<eos> I don't want to say no to the movie.<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, don't.
That's not it.<eos> I mean, that may be true, but... something is happening to you.<eos> And I don't know if it's what happened before or not.<eos> It's not. Believe me.<eos> Okay, then what?<eos> What?<eos> I don't know, Phillip.<eos> Sometimes... sometimes you just look at everything and it's all just different.<eos> - Do you know?<eos> - Yeah, I do.
- Do you believe that?<eos> - No.<eos> - Right?<eos> - Right.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> America?<eos> - Really, yeah.<eos> It says he carved it with a chainsaw.<eos> - Do you believe that?<eos> - I do.
One.<eos> - Two.<eos> - I told you you can't drink in here.<eos> - One.<eos> Two.<eos> - I'm calling the cops.<eos> - You don't have to call the oops.<eos> Look who came back.<eos> Yeah. I came back.<eos> - You did it?
You have to leave now. Everyone.<eos> If you don't go, it'll be all-out war.<eos> War... has already... begun.<eos> Ape started war.<eos> And human...<eos> Human will not forgive.<eos> You must go... before fighting begins.<eos> I am sorry... my friend.<eos> I thought we had a chance.<eos> I did, too.
- God!<eos> I won't let you go!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> - Allison, you okay?<eos> - Come on, Trey. Let's get in the car.<eos> - Everyone here? - Yeah.<eos> This is crazy, guys.<eos> Hey, can I use your cell? My son's out there.<eos> I got no signal. Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> I don't either.
In aerospace, the military...<eos> We will own the entire robotics industry.<eos> All exploration.<eos> The oceans. Space. Everything.<eos> Wembley.<eos> What is this?<eos> The jellyfish commercial that you wanted.<eos> You said they were erotic yet deadly, like women.<eos> I never said that.<eos> - Yes, you did.

I try to respect the pain that you go through.<eos> Could you please review Eee Tee for the Atari 2600?<eos> I mean it's the worse game of all time.<eos> Heard legends of it that it's buried in the landfill somewhere.<eos> Let's just keep this one buried.<eos> Why is it called Xenophobe, anyway?<eos> Well, apparently it means having a fear of anything foreign.<eos> Well, if by foreign it means a drooling, alien creature that's gonna kill me, you bet your ass I fear it.<eos> When in the name of the ass are you going to do the Eee Tee? You are my last hope.<eos> Please do Eee Tee.
- I could pay for it.<eos> - Yeah, fuckin' oath you'll pay for it.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Oh, this dickhead thinks it's OK to steal other people's beers.<eos> If someone does you wrong, you knock 'em the fuck out.<eos> My party, my rules.<eos> Or don't you have the balls?<eos> Ray?<eos> You know this prick?<eos> Yes, yes, I do.
Wow, how the time flies.<eos> ...poughkeepsie...<eos> Montauk...<eos> binghamton, new paltz.<eos> Uh, new paltz.<eos> What's the capital of New York?<eos> All right, we'll try again, but there are rules.<eos> No upsetting questions.<eos> I didn't realize it was one.<eos> Well, now you do.
baby, help me out, please.<eos> Yeah, basically we were just thinking, what if you moved out, you know, like what would that be like?<eos> And you have to understand, you can stay here as long as you need, until you get on your feet.<eos> A couple of days, three days...<eos> However long you want.<eos> Four days.<eos> Okay.<eos> No, I think...<eos> I think it's a really good idea.<eos> You do?
- Sit!<eos> Sit!<eos> Let's play along. You want to save Ma Zouri?<eos> We'll execute him!<eos> What's going on?<eos> Why is Ma Zouri in the stable?<eos> At least the French put him in a cell.<eos> - Here.<eos> - You believe this trash?<eos> Others do!
That's great. That is good news.<eos> So it's 20,000 square feet, but it's a minimum five-year lease.<eos> Twenty thousand. That sounds like a lot more than we need.<eos> But we want something we can grow into, right?<eos> - And we have a really big order, Nick.<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> Come on, Nick.<eos> Nick. - I don't know.<eos> - You know, I say we take it. I say we take it. - Yes.<eos> - Yes, we do.
We can't go around 'em:<eos> "Hey, Dubois, don't call me Ozinski, my name's Robert."<eos> Now I spend my whole life doin' that.<eos> - You takin' a whiz?<eos> - Sorry, can't hold it.<eos> Robert was my dad's name, I'm a Junior.<eos> He's not around, though, I don't really know him 'cause he left when I was a baby.<eos> Yeah, my dad's not around either, he did some bad things to my mom and so we left and I haven't seen him in a while.<eos> I kinda miss him, though, my Mom's being a jerk.<eos> They do that, man.
But then you were working as a cocktail waitress if I remember it correctly?<eos> - Oh, shit.<eos> - We got confirmation.<eos> That's a dirty bomb.<eos> Boss.<eos> Abort.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hi sweetie, it's your father.<eos> You didn't forget, which means you probably love me.<eos> Of course I do, Zooey.
- We're about to see right now.<eos> Look, look, look, look.<eos> He has a paper.<eos> You did not get her number.<eos> Totally got her number.<eos> Right there.<eos> You doubted me, and my spy glasses worked.<eos> You, too, you're a sellout.<eos> No, uh-uh, you didn't get Emma's number.<eos> Yes, I did.
Taxi, taxi, please.<eos> Are you okay...<eos> Did you fall down?<eos> No, no, I hurt my back.<eos> Should I, should I call an ambulance?<eos> No, thank you very... No, thank you.<eos> I'm just trying to get a taxi and I can't get high enough.<eos> Taxi, Taxi!<eos> Oh.<eos> I didn't... Oh.
That's good.<eos> It's good that you're leavin'.<eos> What?<eos> I'm just having a good time with you, Jami.<eos> The only reason I play football is to get a scholarship and go to SMU. Yeah?<eos> And how about you?<eos> Where'd you apply?<eos> You did apply, right?<eos> You're, like, super smart.<eos> Yeah, I did.
You know, Texas stories.<eos> Not all that Hollywood bullshit.<eos> Oh, that.<eos> Yeah, that's pretty cool.<eos> Yep.<eos> That's the original.<eos> Go ahead and touch it if you want.<eos> - No, thank you, sir.<eos> - That's okay.<eos> I don't...
Larry needs to see him for a fitting.<eos> I'll take that as a yes.<eos> So, who are you?<eos> That's Sam, my daughter.<eos> Wow! That's amazing.<eos> You don't look anything like each other.<eos> What do you do? Um...<eos> She's my assistant. Works with me.<eos> And does she talk and speak?<eos> She does. Yeah.
I've explained everything He'll obey you<eos> Stay here<eos> Thank you<eos> Uncle!<eos> What is it?<eos> Do something for me<eos> Invite Das to the club<eos> We'll do the coal mine deal<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Do the deal there? In a public place?
Dude, we're 40 days late on our rent. 43.<eos> I've run out of stuff to sell on eBay, man.<eos> I have nothing.<eos> Man, let's just call it what it is, all right?<eos> We're ready to go back.<eos> So quit then.<eos> Go crawling back to Miami.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> - Ain't gotta be like this.<eos> - Yeah, it does.
All kinds of people.<eos> He doesn't mean "homosexual," Uncle Ben.<eos> - He just means "stupid. "<eos> - Don't worry, Vlad.<eos> Joey and I understand each other.<eos> You're not even a good artist anyway.<eos> - Joey.<eos> - What?<eos> I know you don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's such a horrible thug.<eos> Sometimes I can't believe we're actually related.<eos> Oh, I give up.<eos> I do hope you're not in too much pain.<eos> I'm sure I'll survive.<eos> Perhaps you can help me take my mind off things.<eos> Perhaps I can.<eos> I'm coming.<eos> No, no, no. I don't want that.<eos> Nonsense, of course he does.
- No, it's not, Ben.<eos> It's not. It's not.<eos> - It is.<eos> I mean, I...<eos> Yeah, I was upset that you were not answering my calls, but I...<eos> I didn't want to die.<eos> What?<eos> Well, I mean, I...<eos> I thought I did.<eos> I did. I...
It's the right kind.<eos> Camel hair, right?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you get a new journal?<eos> I knew how much you wanted them, so I couldn't resist.<eos> Okay, I'm going to go start dinner.<eos> Do you guys want your favorite, lasagna?<eos> Need some help?<eos> Hey, Big Joe.<eos> Yes, I do.
Why not go in the morning?<eos> 'Cause I want to be back before tomorrow night.<eos> What are you really doing?<eos> Stop, Mary.<eos> Can't you take the dirt bike?<eos> I was maddening a belt, but I can't make that.<eos> You're not yourself.<eos> What else is going on?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> Don't.
C-can you help me please? Please?<eos> Can you?<eos> Can you help, can you help me out?<eos> Is Robbie with you?<eos> It was a...<eos> It was an accident!<eos> Just a God damned accident!<eos> You don't, you don't want to do this!<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
Baby?<eos> - I'm going!<eos> - No, Mum!<eos> Oh yes!<eos> Shit, I can't feel anything.<eos> Marianne, send them away.<eos> You brought them.<eos> - I don't want to!<eos> - Nor me.<eos> - I do.
Well, that's the problem with arguments. They've done studies...<eos> It's when you stop listening that you stop communicating.<eos> Sid makes you listen.<eos> What if I pretend her light's red just to annoy her?<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> You're both green.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Do you understand what you're doing by staying here?<eos> What you're throwing away?<eos> - Do you? - Ah, ah.
What if I pretend her light's red just to annoy her?<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> You're both green.<eos> Talk to her.<eos> Do you understand what you're doing by staying here?<eos> What you're throwing away?<eos> - Do you? - Ah, ah.<eos> Take some deep breaths.<eos> I'm not throwing anything away.<eos> - Why do you always... - What?
- What sort of lady friend?<eos> - Service industry.<eos> - Just a few blowjobs.<eos> - OK, it's my girlfriend, can you just stop?<eos> - Oh, sorry, sorry.<eos> I didn't realise you were, you know, exclusive.<eos> What was it you said earlier?<eos> "Girls for now, girls for later."<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.
You can't afford not to be.<eos> Look, why don't you come and spend some time in my office, see how we do things?<eos> I don't want anything handed to me on a plate...<eos> I'm not giving you a constituency.<eos> Maybe you've got it in you to do something special one day.<eos> And I'd rather you be doing it in my camp than someone else's.<eos> I'm not just offering you a better lawyer, Alistair, I am offering you a future.<eos> Good.<eos> You know Lord Riot did not spell his name R-I-O-T, but R-Y-O-T?<eos> Nothing to do with riotous behaviour.
Marie, bite his ear.<eos> Do not be afraid.<eos> Kresten, go get the gun.<eos> Do not be afraid.<eos> Just take it.<eos> And stay down, Kresten.<eos> No, stay down.<eos> Stay down, Kresten!<eos> Lower your gun.<eos> Do it!
Now you don't just sound like a sick mule, you look like one to.<eos> I said shut up!<eos> People won't be as surprised to when you open your mouth.<eos> Damn it! I'm gonna kill you.<eos> It's probably a family thing.<eos> I am sure your whore mother sounded like a mule when you were conceived.<eos> Damn!<eos> Do you know how long, I've waited for this very moment.<eos> You felt that, didn't you?<eos> Of course you did.
Hey, you know, you were right.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> Do tell.<eos> We need to try more new things, like weekends away in places like this.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> It makes me excited about us again.<eos> Do you feel it?<eos> - I do.
I have something for you.<eos> One gulp, and forget the cold.<eos> You tell me the news.<eos> This is what we take for hunting.<eos> One puts in our flanges.<eos> There, the cold does not laugh.<eos> The teacher is young, strong as an ox.<eos> But me, I need fuel.<eos> I think I'll avoid.<eos> I do not usually.
I like you.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> If you liked me, you never would've let Jason go through with that.<eos> Fine.<eos> You know what?<eos> I should've stopped him.<eos> I guess I didn't because part of me thought that Jason might've been right about you.<eos> But things are different now.<eos> I never knew how much Nardo loved you.<eos> But I do now.
I'd love whatever you have on the night her best friend drowned.<eos> I understand there was an investigation?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We're not really in the habit of just handing out case files.<eos> I'm not in the habit of dating cops, but I make exceptions.<eos> Do you ever make exceptions?<eos> I'll have it scanned for you right now.<eos> Would you say I was a good parent?<eos> Great. Do you have a pen?<eos> Uh... indeed, I do.
Sorry?<eos> My name's Migg.<eos> Mick?<eos> No, Migg. Two Gs.<eos> Steady on, I've just given you two 20s.<eos> Sorry, do you want them back?<eos> No, I was making a joke about the Gs being like grands.<eos> Anyway, I need to close this door because it's freezing outside.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I know it is.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
Nah, only about six inches.<eos> That is so gross.<eos> Yeah. Next subject, please.<eos> Mary, does your cousin's shack have electricity?<eos> Why?<eos> Do you need a place to plug in your vibrator?<eos> How dare you?<eos> Turn that music off, Mary.<eos> You seriously like this?<eos> You seriously don't?
You would take his side.<eos> I'm not taking anyone's side.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Tell that to Jenn.<eos> Mary, what is she talking about?<eos> That's right, Jenn.<eos> The girl in the stupid picture with Sam, it's fucking Mary.<eos> Thanks, Zoe.<eos> She has a right to know.<eos> Everybody else does for fuck's sake!
Thanks for the intro, Charlie Rose.<eos> - She's pretty hot.<eos> That lady. - I concur.<eos> - Like in a MILF-y way.<eos> - Oh, that's the best-y way.<eos> Yeah, I guess.<eos> - I guess you hit that, huh?<eos> - Totally. I totally hit that.<eos> Cool. Do you still love her?<eos> I do.
People like you shouldn't be fussy<eos> What are you doing here, bro?<eos> -Get in, I brought sandwiches.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> -Nothing, I just got you a sandwich.<eos> You're still filming Sibel's wedding?<eos> -Yes, it's for my film studies.<eos> Except the hen night. She won't let me.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Just do it.
-Forgotten.<eos> Come on, after three months and three weeks?<eos> You don't believe that, do you?<eos> Sweetie, Cynthia is...<eos> -I'm about to lose it.<eos> Why didn't I know she was coming?<eos> I forgot to tell you.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> How can you forget something like that?<eos> I just did.
You fucking asshole.<eos> I just have one more question for you.<eos> ♪ Do you ever feel ♪<eos> ♪ Like a plastic bag ♪<eos> ♪ Drifting through the wind ♪<eos> ♪ Wanting to start again?<eos> ♪<eos> What is that?<eos> - I don't know what that is.<eos> - Oh, yes, you do.

Look at the TV.<eos> Oh, Jesus Christ.<eos> Why are you showing me this?<eos> That little girl is the one you said went to see her daddy, Marie Fontenot, circa 1990.<eos> I took a "missing juvenile" report.<eos> And when I went back to follow up on it the file said, "Report made in error."<eos> I never wrote that.<eos> So I marched it right into the Sheriff, Ted Childress.<eos> He's dead now.<eos> He did it.
If you come down here, bring guns.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Yeah, it was good. It was really good.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> Wow. It's like a vacuum pulling the air out.<eos> What is it?<eos> I think something's back there.<eos> I think it's a way out.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't.
They're free to continue to believe as they want, whatever they want.<eos> But they're going to have to do it without our help.<eos> Hear, hear.<eos> Dagny.<eos> Ellis Wyatt.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I felt abandoned.<eos> I finished the John Galt line to move your oil, and you disappeared on me.<eos> You quit when I needed you most.<eos> All of you did.
An advance.<eos> Where did you get these?<eos> The Mulligan bank.<eos> Whose house is that?<eos> Francisco.<eos> He was the first.<eos> So he destroyed his reputation and the family's copper mines for the strike?<eos> That's not all he gave up.<eos> You know that he and I were very close at one time.<eos> I do.
- Not many.<eos> Most have their own bunkers.<eos> I figure we're just getting the really nervous ones.<eos> Welcome, Prime Minister.<eos> It seems the implant can emit some kind of counter signal... to ensure the wearer remains unaffected by the waves from the SIM cards.<eos> The waves that turn everyone into a psycho killer.<eos> But what he probably didn't tell anyone... is it can also super heat their soft tissue at his command.<eos> Valentine selected his chosen few to get the countdown warning... but he had to be sure they didn't blab to the wrong people beforehand.<eos> How does this help us right now?<eos> It doesn't.
He killed all our friends!<eos> Eggsy, the world is going to shit!<eos> - Is he dead yet?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Stop playing with your food!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Gazelle!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> Kill him!<eos> Well done, son!

Mr Sergeyev's petition to revoke the ruling of the Zagorye District Court.<eos> That ruling is upheld, and Mr Sergeyev's appeal is denied.<eos> The ruling shall come into effect forthwith.<eos> Well, shall we go?<eos> In a minute.<eos> Vadim, every time you come, all you do is worry about the election.<eos> It's not for another year.<eos> In fair weather, prepare for foul.<eos> You do well to tend to worldly matters, but remember the divine.<eos> But I... Don't I already?
He wants you to know that he's willing to help you, but he needs your help in exchange.<eos> Help with what?<eos> His parole.<eos> He wants to end it early.<eos> We're marshals.<eos> We can't end anybody's parole.<eos> Well, you can tell a judge that Darryl aided you in the apprehension of a federal fugitive.<eos> That coupled with his exemplary record as prisoner is evidence of his full rehabilitation.<eos> You really believe that?<eos> Yes. I do.
It's the last one tonight.<eos> We could jump in the car, if...<eos> We'll wait.<eos> Did you get the congressman<eos> - anything for his birthday?<eos> - No.<eos> I got him cuff links.<eos> - Silver, with his...<eos> - We don't talk about birthdays.<eos> - We don't do gifts.
You keep to yourself, do quiet time.<eos> It's not prison I'm worried about.<eos> That'll all work itself out.<eos> You just have to give them time.<eos> You should get some sleep.<eos> We got a long drive tomorrow.<eos> You okay?<eos> This is all on me.<eos> She's going to jail, 'cause of me.<eos> You did 15 years for her.
He was my brother.<eos> Then you'd know he'd do anything to defend the Wall.<eos> He even talks like a wildling now.<eos> Aye, I talk like a wildling.<eos> I ate with the wildlings.<eos> I climbed the Wall with the wildlings.<eos> I--<eos> I laid with a wildling girl.<eos> You admit to breaking your vows, then?<eos> I do.
Oh don't you worry about that, partner...<eos> Archer is not your average dealer.<eos> And what about the pseudoephedrine?<eos> We'll worry about that tomorrow.<eos> Tonight we celebrate.<eos> Right but the pseudo, I mean, you do have it...<eos> Oh, I've got it, partner... but here's the thing... if I tell you where it is now what's to stop you... just putting a bullet in me?<eos> Well, I can think of a long list of things, Russell... but number one would have to be the fact that...<eos> He doesn't have a gun.<eos> Well, you do now.

Do you know why?<eos> Probably because they fit so well into the guns.<eos> A bullet always tells the truth, Milton.<eos> Isn't that right, baby?<eos> A bullet always tells the truth.<eos> Damn fucking straight.<eos> That's why whenever I load my gun I always like to keep one chamber empty.<eos> Then I spin the wheel of fate...<eos> And I never know which one the empty chamber is.<eos> Nobody does.
You'd have been proud of this one, Russell.<eos> You really, really would have been proud.<eos> This one... lasted all day.<eos> Oh god, help me.<eos> No.<eos> Oh god, ok, ok, look... Milton, I...<eos> I'm begging you... just... I'm begging you.<eos> I know you're begging me Russell. I know you are.<eos> But here's the thing...<eos> So did they.
I know you're begging me Russell. I know you are.<eos> But here's the thing...<eos> So did they.<eos> Well... It's not Russell.<eos> He doesn't know anything?<eos> No but that first day, the day I cooked the meth.<eos> He knew something back then.<eos> He knew every single step of my filtration process.<eos> And nobody knows that.<eos> But he did.
I am not even gonna go into it.<eos> Well, I wanted to tell you that Norman came to see me today.<eos> What for?<eos> He brought me a photo he took of a man out at Blaire Watson's grave.<eos> Did you know he's been going out there on a regular basis?<eos> I know he's been out there.<eos> I thought he's gotten over this.<eos> I-I think that... he's young, he's impressionable.<eos> Her death hit him very hard.<eos> He and Miss Watson-- I don't even--
- He killed Herzog.<eos> - It worked. I knew it.<eos> Herzog is dead.<eos> He is dead.<eos> Yes!<eos> Holy cow, that was close.<eos> You did it!<eos> You killed Herzog?<eos> I can't believe that that actually worked,<eos> Of course it did.
If you want to chase phantoms and leave the fortunes of Florence to us, go.<eos> I'll even give you some trusted men to accompany you.<eos> And provisions for the journey.<eos> Why would you possibly do that?<eos> 'Cause I don't like you.<eos> And I'm quite happy to see you sail off the edge of the world.<eos> But if you somehow achieve your aims and return, well, you'll owe me, won't you?<eos> Very well.<eos> I accept your offer.<eos> Of course you do!
Just like the CIA uses to listen to you.<eos> Like a microphone, only you don't know it.<eos> They think I don't know it.<eos> 'Cause they think I'm stupid.<eos> My lawyer, he thinks I'm stupid!<eos> Want me to plead insanity like I'm some kind of whacko.<eos> I ain't no whacko!<eos> I'm not stupid.<eos> Do you think I'm stupid?<eos> No. I don't.
The game is over, and all of your secret labour on their behalf was in vain.<eos> The Duke...can't be so short-sighted.<eos> Spain would pay twice as much and guarantee Savoy's independence.<eos> Really?<eos> What a pity you're not there to advise him.<eos> He can't have forgotten how you tried to overthrow him.<eos> That whole incident was a tragic misunderstanding.<eos> You forget who you're talking to.<eos> I saw the orders with my own eyes.<eos> So you did.
Wait, wait, wait.<eos> But the last two weren't discovered yet.<eos> Okay, so 6 planets. 6 planets.<eos> Wait, wait, wait. Scarlett.<eos> Don't touch anything.<eos> Was this built before or after Copernicus?<eos> Before.<eos> So, they still believed everything revolved around the Earth.<eos> Which means the Earth didn't count as a planet. Right.<eos> But the Moon did. And so did the Sun.
Some nights she still sees him, in the shadows, her little Daniel.<eos> This is the boy that I followed.<eos> He always listened and behaved, but one morning he wanted to go out to play.<eos> She refused.<eos> He had been sick for many days.<eos> Fever, rash... same as his friends.<eos> But he insisted.<eos> And he never came back.<eos> He disappeared.<eos> They all did.
It's awesome.<eos> Do you have more?<eos> There's something I made.<eos> Will you show it to me?<eos> If you want.<eos> Ouch!<eos> There.<eos> One more?<eos> - I don't have any more.<eos> - You don't?
- What do you take out first?<eos> - This.<eos> Yes, exactly.<eos> So, the needle, you have to secure it.<eos> Good.<eos> Throw it away.<eos> Perfect, Chérif.<eos> Very good.<eos> Who wants to go next?<eos> - I do. - OK.
He wrote that to me?<eos> He wrote it to everybody.<eos> - You gotta be kidding me.<eos> - Wow. You realize how many people have read this?<eos> I'm up to 2,000 followers since last night.<eos> - You're trending, bro.<eos> - They're sending me messages.<eos> They're goading me into responding to this prick.<eos> - Don't do it.<eos> Don't do it, man.
- This guy.<eos> - Don't.<eos> What are you writing?<eos> Chef, don't... That's not a good idea.<eos> Just listen. I won't send it until we all say it's OK.<eos> "Why don't you come by again tonight? "I got a whole new menu just for you, asshole."<eos> - No, gimme the phone.<eos> - That's not good.<eos> Not a good idea.<eos> Don't do it!
I get to touch people's lives with what I do.<eos> And it keeps me going, and I love it.<eos> And I think if you give it a shot, you might love it too.<eos> Yes, Chef.<eos> Now, should we have served that sandwich?<eos> No, Chef.<eos> That's my son.<eos> Get back in there. We got some hungry people.<eos> He's ready to cook!<eos> - We did good, man.
- That's nothing. I've also been shooting these videos...<eos> one second every day.<eos> One-second videos?<eos> Now you're joking with me.<eos> No. You edit 'em all together.<eos> One second of every day.<eos> And then you cut 'em together and watch it.<eos> OK, enough with the virtual world.<eos> How about something real? Who wants to stop at Disney World?<eos> - Oh, yeah, I do.
You can pop your cherry with this one.<eos> First one's a bitch, but you get numb to it.<eos> All you gotta do is stand next to me today, but after this you're gonna do 'em on your own.<eos> Listen, Rick, I don't...<eos> - Could I...<eos> Could I just... - Go fuck yourself?<eos> Yeah. What did you think it was gonna mean, working for me?<eos> - I just thought that maybe...<eos> - No, you didn't. You didn't think. You didn't have the guts to ask me either.<eos> Nobody does.
Got anything on you that could poke me, stick in me, hurt me?<eos> Call it in. No, sir.<eos> No.<eos> All right.<eos> You have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you.<eos> You have a right to have an attorney present during questioning.<eos> If you can't afford one, the court will appoint one for you.<eos> Sir.<eos> OK, I just wanted...<eos> He didn't do anything.
Okay, uh, back in the day, my mom worked at WCIV.<eos> She, uh...<eos> Teenagers.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Everything's okay.<eos> Keep talking.<eos> Well, back in the day, my mom did some work at WCIV.
Wow, that's impressive.<eos> Yeah, absolutely.<eos> I'm sorry, excuse me, guys.<eos> Oh, you're fine.<eos> I think you know everyone here but Mary Jane.<eos> Mary Jane Paul is the host of "Talkback" on SNC.<eos> Mary Jane. Mary Jane, this is Avery Daniels.<eos> She was a partner at Cornwall and Sullivan law firm and now she sits on our financial advisory board.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'd like to see you try.<eos> If anyone's gonna upstage the bride, it's your mother.<eos> You joke, but you're right.<eos> Did we order these?<eos> They're courtesy of the gentlemen at the bar.<eos> He also wanted me to give you this.<eos> Let me handle this.<eos> Uh... go get him, tiger.<eos> - Hi. - I see you got my message.<eos> - I did.
Through the force of his will, thriving when so many of the rest of the world are barely hanging on.<eos> I mean, you're that successful, Washington comes to you.<eos> Jonas, you have to back us.<eos> Roosevelt is choking the whole country.<eos> - He's a socialist.<eos> - He's a Russian Jew.<eos> He's gonna tax us businessmen out of business.<eos> Maybe we ought to be taxed out of business, seeing as how it was our business that got this whole country in a mess in the first place.<eos> Really, Jonas, you act like you don't want to make money.<eos> I don't.
Oh, right, and get up all in your business.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm going to get the surgery, whether Lisa does it or not.<eos> Trevyon, come here, baby.<eos> Get your shirt on.<eos> I know you see me standing here, Niecy.<eos> You know I was thinking about getting my tubes tied.<eos> I thought you were just talking.<eos> You were the one who said that having babies shouldn't be my biggest achievement in life.<eos> Yes, I did.
People like us think we've been cursed by God, but, in fact, we've been cursed by our parents.<eos> You look in the mirror, and you see an adult.<eos> But you have to look more carefully. There's a big piece of you that never grew up.<eos> It may have grown tall, but not up.<eos> You spend your life waiting for your parents to come back and make it all right.<eos> But they don't come back.<eos> It's not all right.<eos> You have to somehow move past them.<eos> You have to somehow convince yourself that you don't need those people.<eos> Because you don't.
He got too rough with me.<eos> He got mean. He said these two tweakers, that they could tag-team me and share me or some shit - and teach me a lesson.<eos> - All right, quiet down.<eos> I just...<eos> Wanna go back to, like, the way it used to be, you know? Like, you used to... Used to take me places, really nice... really nice places.<eos> We used to... we used to sleep in your bed together.<eos> You know?<eos> Remember?<eos> I don't like it like this.<eos> Of course you don't.
Fireman's carry.<eos> - Did she see a car?<eos> - Car?<eos> Get this: "Something gray."<eos> - Yeah. - Farragut: Jesus.<eos> - That guy you told about me? - Uh-huh? He's a serious guy, huh?<eos> - You wanna know what he did, Carl? - No.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> He burned my family alive.<eos> Oh, I didn't...
- Hands up! Get 'em up! - Hands up!<eos> - Hands up now! - Put 'em up!<eos> I mean, this is the sweetest offer I've ever heard, right?<eos> You tell us who the Colombians are targeting next, and we won't charge you with distribution.<eos> What's the debate?<eos> Ain't no debate.<eos> I just know not to trust a word that comes out of a cop's mouth.<eos> We're trying to save someone's life.<eos> You all worried about my boy?<eos> Don't.
Ashes to ashes.<eos> Can we recover from this?<eos> Viggo, you know what was in that vault, right? It was nothing.<eos> Shit!<eos> I'll say this, John. They sure as fuck broke the mold with you.<eos> Ay, ay... You always had a certain audacity about you, you know.<eos> I can say you're still very much the John Wick of old.<eos> Am I?<eos> People don't change. You know that.<eos> Times, they do.
So that's your thing?<eos> Well, it sure isn't for the company or the frills.<eos> There ain't no greater exercise in boredom. But you're right.<eos> I, uh... I bought this baby special when I landed my bighorn permit.<eos> Been waiting to fill that last little space on the wall.<eos> You get a gender exemption?<eos> Yeah, dulled male only.<eos> You mind if I just double-check that permit?<eos> You know what the odds are for landing a bighorn license?<eos> I sure do.
- Yeah.<eos> And that's fine and all.<eos> But when we get somewhere, you need to mind your own business.<eos> You understand me?<eos> What a girl falls into a river?<eos> I don't care.<eos> Now promise.<eos> What if a man is walking on the side of the road, and it's really hot and he drops a penny, and it gets stuck on the melting road, and his hand gets stuck and a truck is coming?<eos> That's never happening.<eos> But what if it did?
- Find any water yet?<eos> - No, not yet.<eos> I'm going back out if you want to come.<eos> You know, my father, he begged for mercy in the airlock chamber when your father floated him.<eos> Spelled "die" wrong, geniuses.<eos> If you're gonna kill someone, it's probably best not to announce it.<eos> You're not really a member of the guard, are you?<eos> No, the real guard will be here soon, unless we stop it.<eos> You don't actually think they're gonna forgive your crimes?<eos> Even if they do, then what?
It's really cyper.<eos> Or, as you call it, saffron.<eos> - Saffron?<eos> - Well, it's our own version of it.<eos> We use it for cooking.<eos> But some enterprising guards have made a good amount of cash selling our spice's magic remedy to... gullible humans outside the Sector.<eos> It was worth a shot.<eos> Do you... have a sick friend?<eos> Um, I don't.<eos> She does.
Chloe, you got her?<eos> Chloe, do you have her?<eos> No.<eos> I don't see her.<eos> I missed her.<eos> Where are you?<eos> I'm right in front of charing cross station.<eos> You missed her?<eos> How?<eos> I just did, okay?
Who did that to you?<eos> Get that wound cleaned up.<eos> You don't want it getting infected.<eos> I'll be up in a minute.<eos> Naveed?<eos> Listen to me.<eos> This is very simple.<eos> What I asked Simone to do with this man yates is disgusting to you.<eos> But you're wrong to blame her.<eos> Or me. Don't.
You know, I don't know about you, Nick, but, um...<eos> You know, I got to 50 and I was all right, I was pretty cool with it.<eos> But, you know, I'm...<eos> I'm 56. How old are you?<eos> I kind of had to think about...<eos> reinventing myself, I suppose, within the business that I'm in, you know, and it was...<eos> I can't reinvent myself.<eos> - Do you want to?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't...
She literally walked onto the lip of the stage and stared everyone down...<eos> like it was... Well, I remember... I remember seeing...<eos> I had the same thing happen when I saw "The Killer" play in Paris and my mate was there and he's like... comes up to me, he goes, "Well, good news."<eos> "The... the T-shirt guy selling the T-shirts."<eos> And I'm like, "Ooh, what do you mean?"<eos> and he goes, "Oh, I saw him last week in the South of France"<eos> "and the T-shirt seller did most of the set<eos> "and The Killer just sat on the side and came out...<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - "and did Great Balls Of Fire
The sooner I sorted things out, the sooner I'd have it easy.<eos> With the minimum each month.<eos> The minimum was enough for me.<eos> This was a place of hope for me.<eos> But even the plants preferred to die there.<eos> Your plants need light, Patrick. They're dying-<eos> The crazy thing is, they're fake. They are?<eos> Maybe they're fake dead plants.<eos> - Do you like dead plants?<eos> - No. Maybe some people do.
But I always looked out for my little brother... to the best of my abilities... even if they were somewhat impaired.<eos> It was always me and you against the world.<eos> Me and you... against the world.<eos> Me and you, Frankie.<eos> It was me and you.<eos> I'm gonna go take a piss.<eos> Yo, Frankie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ever wonder what life would be like if... if you never pulled the trigger on that cop 10 years ago?<eos> But I did, Jimmy.
It was always me and you against the world.<eos> Me and you... against the world.<eos> Me and you, Frankie.<eos> It was me and you.<eos> I'm gonna go take a piss.<eos> Yo, Frankie.<eos> Yeah?<eos> You ever wonder what life would be like if... if you never pulled the trigger on that cop 10 years ago?<eos> But I did, Jimmy.<eos> But I did.
They're people.<eos> There's respect in what I do.<eos> You are very interesting to me.<eos> Your artwork is interesting, too.<eos> Do I scare you?<eos> Are you gonna arrest me or what?<eos> No, I'm not gonna arrest you.<eos> Then stop following me.<eos> Why did you say that you didn't recognize Ellie Ford?<eos> - Because I didn't.

I've been trying to talk to you about it for a while now, but... things got complicated.<eos> I fell in love with you...<eos> long before we ever met.<eos> Please stop.<eos> He told me how to find you.<eos> He told me... that you were Jenny Glick's daughter.<eos> Do you have any idea... how special that makes you?<eos> He speaks to me, June...<eos> Judas.<eos> No, he doesn't, Daniel.

- Like, oh, seven years. - Uh, mm-hmm.<eos> - Mm-hmm, September 14, yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Today's September 14.<eos> No, no, it's not September 14.<eos> That would mean it's our anniversary.<eos> Oh, my God, it's our anniversary.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Well, we need to celebrate.<eos> Yes, we do.
Sorry. It's out of my system now, I swear.<eos> I swear.<eos> Totally blown over.<eos> Honey, I know I said this through the bedroom door, through the bathroom door, through the closet door.<eos> I really am sorry.<eos> Especially for grabbing you by the back of your head like that.<eos> But that was just reflex.<eos> It's fine.<eos> When I was curled up in a ball on the floor trying to forget the look on our pediatrician's face,<eos> I, uh... I did a lot of thinking.
Yeah, that's right.<eos> So be the shark.<eos> Be the fucking shark, Alex.<eos> What are you gonna do, Nola?<eos> You gonna hit me?<eos> I think I was wrong to ask you to stick around.<eos> After everything that's happened, everything you went through,<eos> I should have thought about that.<eos> I'm sorry, but you don't belong here anymore.<eos> I never did.
I guess we're lucky the bald guy and the dyke caught us first.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - Hey, I like the dyke.<eos> Do you know what I love about this country?<eos> The same laws that protect people from me, protect me from you.<eos> You sound like my father.<eos> I think that was an insult.<eos> You see, my father believed that the law spoke for all men, even a black janitor.<eos> You just have to have faith in the system.<eos> And he did.
How many black kids you know know how to swim?<eos> That is such a racist assumption.<eos> Doc, what the hell are you talking about?<eos> You didn't h... Nothing.<eos> I'm sorry about that.<eos> Okay, you said he was going swimming?<eos> It's not always about race, pal.<eos> You seen many swimming pools in this neighborhood?<eos> Does Kenny know how to swim?<eos> No, he doesn't.
Exciting, then exhausting.<eos> - Ah. - Then I died.<eos> Joking.<eos> Kinda.<eos> Well, you're out of it now' so that's good.<eos> I used to think that I failed because of my team.<eos> -I didn't have the right chief of staff, campaign manager, comms guys, my then wife, but, no.<eos> It was me.<eos> I just didn't have it.<eos> - Well, very few of us do.
No.<eos> He said hello.<eos> That was all.<eos> "Hello" was more than you deserved.<eos> Can I ask you something?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What is it?<eos> Did you have to turn him against me?<eos> I didn't.<eos> You did.
I put 40% down deposit on this property... because you said that you would be there.<eos> You now have three serious separate pending legal cases against you... one with 16 counts of misconduct... ranging from fraud to tax evasion.<eos> And then today, in the middle of our meeting...<eos> I get a report saying you had armed your entire fleet of drivers... which led to a shoot... out on the 59th Street Bridge.<eos> - None of that is true.<eos> - That may be.<eos> "May"?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter. It matters that you know we didn't do this.<eos> I do.

"Where's Emma's mom?<eos> I wonder where she lives."<eos> Okay, look, lady.<eos> I know I've made some mistakes.<eos> (Laughing) Okay, yeah.<eos> Um...<eos> But you have to understand.<eos> I didn't have all the love and support that Ben has.<eos> I didn't have an incredible, selfless mother who would do anything for me.<eos> Well, who does really?
- That might be smart.<eos> - OK.<eos> Now you're done.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - It's all right. I'm not going to hurt you.<eos> - I know.<eos> - I don't remember the other night.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I'm not saying that makes it OK.<eos> - It doesn't.
Who's your friend?<eos> - Mind your own business.<eos> OK.<eos> - You can get your car at the train station.<eos> How am I supposed to get it?<eos> - I don't care.<eos> Did you forget something? - I gave it to you. I gave you the money.<eos> - Address?<eos> - Right. OK, and how do I, uh, contact you?<eos> - You don't.
He's leaving tomorrow.<eos> Just another day, please.<eos> I don't know if I can take any more.<eos> Antxon!<eos> Not Antxon again!<eos> Yes, or we'll get in a mess.<eos> Weren't you with my father?<eos> Yes, but... I think he suspects something.<eos> He says it doesn't seem you've been together three years.<eos> - He did?
Actually, could you close the door?<eos> - Are you ok?<eos> You're acting really weird.<eos> - Yeah, no, I'm fine.<eos> Um, so I uh...<eos> I don't know how to say this, really.<eos> Um...<eos> Say what?<eos> You know that I care about you a lot, right?<eos> Yeah, of course I do.
Ali's alive.<eos> She's been alive the whole time and didn't tell us.<eos> She talked to us but she never told us she was alive.<eos> Hey, you're not the only one who feels like she's been playing "hide and seek"<eos> since junior year.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, sometimes I imagine her wet and scared in a cardboard box by some train tracks.<eos> And, other times I see her in a penthouse, dripping diamonds and laughing at us.<eos> But... we don't know which one's the truth.<eos> None of us do.
All kinds of things happen that we're not expecting.<eos> It's hard to explain.<eos> Try me.<eos> Ravenswood turned into more than I thought it would.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> That's why I'm glad that you're out of there.<eos> Hanna, I might have to go back.<eos> What do you mean, "might"?<eos> I have to go back.<eos> No, you don't.
But that's what I keep thinking.<eos> You're done.<eos> You've... you've got your life back.<eos> Not us.<eos> She's gone but she's not gone.<eos> And we can't get away from her.<eos> And I'm so tired of being Sara's friend.<eos> Just... sucks the life out of you.<eos> I understand how you feel.<eos> No, you don't.
I see.<eos> Self-righteous son of a bitch is flanking me with all his own people.<eos> Says it's for my own good, that I lack experience in an executive capacity.<eos> He told me to take it or leave it.<eos> You're gonna be transferred.<eos> There's nothing I can do about it.<eos> You're still the chief of police.<eos> You've never left me out there, not for one day.<eos> You know you have to do this.<eos> No, I don't.
Christmas.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think it's best for you to have a roommate.<eos> Not to be alone.<eos> At first, anyway.<eos> Oh, I forgot.<eos> Do you have a cell phone?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, I do!<eos> No, I don't.
I gotta roll a joint before the meteor shower starts.<eos> Why?<eos> We're about to watch a fucking meteor shower. "Why."<eos> Oh, here.<eos> That's for when you apply to college in a few years.<eos> Use me as a reference.<eos> You're a postdoctoral scientist at Tristana Pharmaceuticals.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - So you already knew...<eos> Oh, that cancery stuff, yeah, I did.
Can I plug this in your ear?<eos> Why don't you try that girl I saw you with earlier?<eos> She seems to have a fair amount of extra energy.<eos> - Heather.<eos> - Oh, Heather's, what, like, 19?<eos> She's completely age-appropriate.<eos> Why' you jealous?<eos> Fuckin'<eos> -A, I'm jealous. You see that body?<eos> No, of course you did.
I feel like I've seen this toy before.<eos> Do you like it, honey?<eos> I love it, Dad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Well, have fun putting it together.<eos> Wait, wha...<eos> Dad, don't you want to build it with me?<eos> Well, there's no dad on the box.<eos> I don't want to get in trouble.<eos> Of course I do!
- Many fear Hobots.<eos> - He is totally harmless.<eos> - I want to talk to my son.<eos> - Enough. Remove your Hubot!<eos> I'm moving now, Kevin, as I said the other day.<eos> - If you want, you can come with.<eos> - I not coming!<eos> - I never want to see you again.<eos> - You can't mean that.<eos> Yes, I do.
So, David knows the guy?<eos> I mean, maybe it's his uncle or something.<eos> That's what I'm trying to figure out.<eos> I need to talk to the police.<eos> The cops found those drugs in Zeke's room, so they think they've got their guy.<eos> So, what do you need me to do?<eos> Get any information you can on this guy.<eos> Do you really think David killed Craig and that other guy?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
I can handle them from now on, Marge.<eos> Gentlemen, I've been thinking.<eos> My glorious youth and beauty won't last forever.<eos> Someday, when the leaves have turned and the moon has broken apart into chunks of floating cheese,<eos> I will be old.<eos> What's your point, pound cake?<eos> I'm hoping we can find a way to coexist.<eos> - What did he say?<eos> - He wants to see if ghosts exist.<eos> Ooh, they do.
That bitch is an emotional terrorist.<eos> She better not be going to this thing tonight,<eos> I can't stand her.<eos> How's that $30 spray tan working out for you?<eos> I don't know, you tell me!<eos> Oh! Fuck off!<eos> If I had tits like that, it would not have taken me till I was 18 to get some dick.<eos> Shelby, did you bring my black shoes?<eos> I don't have them.<eos> Yes, you do.
- I know the House better than you know birds.<eos> Believe me when I say they'll pass the Senate version.<eos> I'll talk to the president.<eos> - Just make sure this is airtight. - Thank you.<eos> What is it?<eos> - Lucas Goodwin.<eos> - From the Herald?<eos> He must have been working with Zoe.<eos> - How much does he know?<eos> - No more than she did.
He's the first real connection we have to Mina.<eos> It is an invaluable opportunity we cannot afford to waste.<eos> Even if it means beating him to death?<eos> Suddenly sentimental about bloodletting, Mr. Chandler?<eos> Maybe I don't take to torturing children.<eos> Killing redskins more your line?<eos> You know nothing about it.<eos> Whole Indian nations pacified into nonexistence, what don't I know?<eos> How do you know I was in the Indian wars?<eos> I didn't.
- She's not with us tonight.<eos> - And why is that?<eos> Another time.<eos> - Come, we have a distance to walk.<eos> - Wait.<eos> - First, tell me what we're doing here.<eos> - We're going to explore a plague ship.<eos> Come this way.<eos> You asked me once if Sir Malcolm knew what he was seeking.<eos> He does not.
Perhaps I was just cherishing the secrecy of it as a hidden sin.<eos> But in me, there was a change.<eos> I marked it from that night in the hedge maze.<eos> Perhaps it was always there.<eos> Little acts of wickedness.<eos> Harmless, of course.<eos> Something any girl would do.<eos> I told myself it was no more than mischief.<eos> But I knew it was more.<eos> Of course I did.
The parish decided upon the rite of exorcism.<eos> They did not seek approval from Rome.<eos> It was, uh, well, a community event, you might say.<eos> And I was asked to assist.<eos> To help that poor boy.<eos> What happened?<eos> He died.<eos> They all died.<eos> Did he find God?<eos> No one did.
You still might.<eos> Don't let me hurt anyone.<eos> I won't.<eos> They won't stop me.<eos> They haven't the heart for it.<eos> But you do.<eos> When the moment comes, look into my eyes, and pull the trigger.<eos> And send you to heaven?<eos> If you believe in that.<eos> Oh, I do.
- Sir?<eos> - At this time, I have no authorization... for an extra team or air support without confirmation, except for an extraction. Okay.<eos> Maybe I wasn't clear about the yellowcake.<eos> It's the uranium type.<eos> Uranium's legally mined in that region... and there are about 10 international agencies... counting every ounce of yellowcake produced... making damn sure what your intel says is happening never happens.<eos> So you can imagine the kind of politics that we...<eos> Listen, Case.<eos> The guys in D.C. cried wolf about this African yellowcake once before.<eos> We both know how that turned out.<eos> Yes, I do.
Where should we go?<eos> Jay, shift your weight.<eos> Shut up, old man.<eos> This ain't "E" and "E," it's "R" and "R" for me.<eos> You know...<eos> I haven't thanked you yet. For what?<eos> Your excellent work in picking a vacation spot.<eos> Come on, man.<eos> You know I was born to roll like this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Ohh, does it hurt?<eos> Yeah, it fucking hurts.<eos> It looks pretty bad.<eos> Did medical check it out?<eos> It's fine.<eos> You know what it looks like?<eos> It looks like you got herpes.<eos> Hey, no.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> It kind of does.
You... you see that book there?<eos> It has no cover on it, huh?<eos> Uh-huh, yes.<eos> That book... it used to have a cover.<eos> I remember I read this cover, you know, when it has a cover on it.<eos> It was saying that Harry Potter, it has seven book, you know?<eos> You guys only have six book.<eos> Huh? I don't know what to tell you...<eos> I... You know how long I'm asking for this book?<eos> No, you don't.
Nobody gives you a medal when you do it right... they just give you a demotion when you do it wrong.<eos> My granddad... he flew 25 missions over Germany, blew up a dozen Nazi installments.<eos> What do we get?<eos> We get to babysit a bunch of sheep farmers.<eos> Like I said, I hate it here, and, yet, here I am.<eos> And do you know why?<eos> I'm here because my commanding officer told me to come here.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> The review board will have, uh, a hearing for both of you next month.<eos> - I didn't do...
He's not a real threat.<eos> Maybe Carter talked things out with you.<eos> I won't.<eos> - How much longer?<eos> - Until what?<eos> - Until I can stop.<eos> - You prefer prison?<eos> I've given you eight child pornographers, three botnet masters. But you still haven't given us AVunit.<eos> I told Carter I don't know where he is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- I'll arm-wrestle you for it.<eos> - And you'll win.<eos> Of that, I have no doubt.<eos> But I assign the episodes.<eos> This place is a fucking freak show.<eos> What the fuck is this now?<eos> I'm sorry to interrupt.<eos> I'm Julia, Levon's mom.<eos> Levon has something he'd like to say to you.<eos> Do it.
No, it's creepy.<eos> Yep, we're in creepy town right now... population you.<eos> "A," I have an appointment, and "B," it's too soon.<eos> And "C," are you getting stoned right now?<eos> What kind of appointment?<eos> - It's an acting appointment. - Mm.<eos> - You didn't answer my question.<eos> - An audition.<eos> Rath said that there was a small part that I might be good for.<eos> Oh, Rath did, did he?
They stole a man's freedom.<eos> Justice needs to be served.<eos> And if you help us serve it, Peter...<eos> You'll get full credit.<eos> Help us bring down the Ewings.<eos> I'll make some calls.<eos> Well, the only reason you'd be calling me is if there's an Emma problem.<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> I threw her out, Harris.<eos> You did what?
You done?<eos> For now.<eos> Look, it's my cousin John Ross who's behind all this, all right?<eos> My father and I are trying to do everything in our power to stop it.<eos> Why didn't you say something sooner?<eos> 'Cause you're pretty cute when you're angry.<eos> Oh. All right.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> Hey, you like barbecue?<eos> Who doesn't?
You disgrace our family!<eos> Go!<eos> Go, you have to leave now!<eos> You've offended his honour, he'll not forgive this!<eos> - He hit you!<eos> - I hit him!<eos> You see, you understand nothing.<eos> You will never understand!<eos> I thought I was doing the right thing. Yes.<eos> Yes, you and your sons and your armies, all doing the right thing!
We're not even related.<eos> Kiss me.<eos> The money ran out, and most of his land was sold off for taxes.<eos> That well ain't never comin' in.<eos> There's oil down in that ground.<eos> And I'm gonna get it.<eos> Devon, we struck oil!<eos> Son of a bitch, it's oil!<eos> You're acting like you don't want to make money.<eos> I don't.
But we've known you for years<eos> And I feel we have this kind of a bond<eos> Besides you are a father, and you want the best for your family<eos> So I think that an arrangement like this one will help you<eos> If you say that you took the car last night while we were sleeping<eos> And that you drove during the accident<eos> I will place the best lawyer that will get you out of jail as quickly as possible<eos> With good conduct you're out in less than year and a half<eos> -Does it work that way?<eos> -It does
Give him a breath test.<eos> Nicolas, did you bring the breathalyser?<eos> Silly me, I left it at the station.<eos> He can drop by and take it tomorrow.<eos> I bet they let him off.<eos> What's up?<eos> You couldn't sleep?<eos> What about Dad?<eos> I don't know if he'll be back home.<eos> I don't, Théo.
We're getting close.<eos> You guys ready?<eos> Ew, he wears cologne. It's gross.<eos> If my dad finds out, I'm totally getting grounded.<eos> And if your dad doesn't find out, maybe we'll be invited to Ryan's New Year's Eve party.<eos> Maybe we won't go into next semester being the same lame losers we are now.<eos> I don't have to jump off a bus to prove I'm fun.<eos> I'm fun.<eos> I know that.<eos> Just... no one else really does.
It's just that I gotta pee so badly.<eos> They have to let us pee, right?<eos> You think I should ask again? Should I ask...<eos> They ain't gonna let you pee.<eos> No one told you to wear a pee pad?<eos> - A what?<eos> - A pee pad.<eos> Two maxis stacked so they like a maxi-maxi.<eos> And then you just let out a little at a time.<eos> Now, some people do two down and then one across the front, one across the back like a diaper, but me, I just do a double stack.
I'm glad you can make jokes.<eos> Alex...<eos> I need to do the right thing for a change.<eos> I have to.<eos> And truthfully, you... you can't keep me safe either way.<eos> Left hand, please.<eos> Raise your right.<eos> Do you solemnly swear that you will tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth,<eos> - so help you God?<eos> - I do.
It seems like boys and girls make the world go around.<eos> Not only are you beautiful weird, but you're also wicked smart.<eos> I've made a pretty decent living writing about boys and girls.<eos> Speaking of boys and girls...<eos> Yes?<eos> Are you and mom going to get a divorce?<eos> How can we get divorced?<eos> We're not even married.<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I do.
Well, that sounds like a pretty good definition of prayer to me.<eos> Sister, I don't... I don't think the man upstairs would be too interested in hearing from me.<eos> I've been a particularly wayward son.<eos> - Everyone says that.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> I'm a blasphemous mess.<eos> If there's a top ten most unwanted list up there, I... I could very well be on it.<eos> Maybe so.<eos> But right now you just seem like a man who loves his wife.<eos> I do.

Karenina, you don't think I'm starting to go through the change, do you?<eos> - Because...<eos> - Starting?<eos> - I still get really wet.<eos> - Yes, yes, you do.<eos> I think that's what makes me pop so fast.<eos> You see, this is why we don't go out, because every time we do, Charlie says something that makes me throw up in my mouth.<eos> She started it.<eos> Hey, well, try living with that shit try living with that shit.<eos> I didn't.
JP. If he comes in, you slip out.<eos> No, it'll be all right.<eos> This way. Hurry.<eos> C'mon.<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Squeeze.<eos> Keep squeezing.<eos> Keep squeezing, fuck.<eos> - l'm squeezing. - Until he comes back.<eos> When he does...
- lt's a good investment.<eos> - For who?<eos> Well?<eos> - lt's ridiculous.<eos> I've been asked to give out awards to the best Vita reps.<eos> Honestly, it's an honour for me to be here and meet you.<eos> - l'm starving.<eos> - l have toothpaste.<eos> - Doesn't work.<eos> - lt does too.
I'm fed up.<eos> Julie.<eos> You're about to win the World Cup, and you want to stop?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm burnt out.<eos> I'm tired.<eos> That's why we want you to see a doctor.<eos> Would you stop bringing that up?<eos> You know why I don't want to see one.<eos> No, we don't.
What exactly is the company, by the way?<eos> The client is in footwear.<eos> Shoes, women's.<eos> The new head of marketing wants to cut costs.<eos> I get it.<eos> It's 20 degrees out there and the kids are in sandals.<eos> Lowering overhead is not a bad idea.<eos> Is that where you'd start, keeping in mind "the four Ps"?<eos> Do you have an MBA?<eos> No, but their head of marketing does.
Hi there.<eos> My name is Shawn Spencer.<eos> This is my partner Robert Jones, but you may call him Bob.<eos> We would like to cast you in the remake of his life.<eos> Don't pay him any mind.<eos> My name is Burton Guster.<eos> Hello.<eos> Do you by chance know where the parking ticket payment window is?<eos> You poor thing.<eos> Yeah, I do, actually.
I guess some girls are turned on by a weather set.<eos> You heard Jackson enter that night.<eos> It was dark, shadowy.<eos> You premeditated this murder, but you were convinced it was your wife.<eos> And you knew he'd bring her back to the studio where he secretly films his trysts.<eos> Using the technician's green screen suit, you knew you'd remain undetected.<eos> You waited for them to drop out of frame--<eos> And you knocked that poor girl out cold and stabbed you some Jackson Hale.<eos> Then you noticed it wasn't Connie at all, it was my client Sandra Panitch, an innocent girl who walked into a deadly love triangle.<eos> I did, I did.
I'll be here living my truth.<eos> Okay.<eos> Or we could all just go back to the car!<eos> See you in a bit!<eos> But I have no stick!<eos> Shosh?<eos> Ray's third worst scenario in life... thank you...<eos> Is a road trip with a spontaneous detour.<eos> Who has a third worst anything?<eos> - Who doesn't?

- Okay, great.<eos> I'm really not as fragile as he thinks I am.<eos> - Okay, good.<eos> - I'm really a good old girl.<eos> - Good.<eos> - But if you did have some arnica for these bruises on my thigh, that would be so helpful.<eos> Did you run into something, or is that more of, like, an abuse scenario?<eos> 'Cause those are really...<eos> You know, I don't know what to call a provoked physical attack by someone you love.<eos> - I really don't.
So, ready to watch some, uh, shitty TV?<eos> No one asked you to come here.<eos> Look, I know you're going through a hard time lately. Okay? And I also know that's the last thing you'd ever admit to anyone.<eos> So why don't we just sit down together like not friends and you could introduce me to your televiewing sensibilities?<eos> Well, have you ever seen reality television before?<eos> I've seen Ken Burns' jazz documentary about 17 times.<eos> - Does that count?<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> No way.<eos> No, it doesn't.
I'll have to burn Harold Parr.<eos> To the Israelis? Mm.<eos> That's fine.<eos> They'll bury it. They won't let this go public.<eos> But I... I have one other stipulation.<eos> The Stein Foundation has to stay intact.<eos> It cannot be compromised.<eos> It already is.<eos> The Israelis will know.<eos> Hamas probably already does.
- No, no, no. They left four years ago and functionally disappeared.<eos> Until now.<eos> Too late.<eos> Clearly, they're a team that leaves no trace...at all.<eos> So, where next?<eos> Given what's happened, I have to suggest the possibility that our most likely point of first contact will be when Kasim's kidnappers choose to make it with us.<eos> So the long arm of the law has just come up short.<eos> Is that what you're telling us?<eos> And how do you expect us to react to that?<eos> He doesn't.
You're a wonderful father, Ephra.<eos> Don't let them see you like this.<eos> I'm stuck in a loop, aren't I?<eos> Playing Neil Diamond records?<eos> Thinking about it.<eos> Then, yes, you are.<eos> I can change.<eos> Would that involve black denim?<eos> - It could if you wanted it to.<eos> - I don't.
The question is, do you want him to?<eos> Your men?<eos> They are dead.<eos> Then they have come.<eos> Yes.<eos> I spent 15 years searching for my daughter.<eos> And now she hunts me.<eos> Tell me, Yulish.<eos> Do you really believe in God?<eos> I do, yes.
Do you really believe in God?<eos> I do, yes.<eos> To me...<eos> God always felt like something men made up to feel less alone.<eos> And now... I am more alone than I have ever been.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I don't give a shit.<eos> And instead of wishing for God... I am praying...<eos> That He does not exist.<eos> Because if He does... Dead or alive...
He's-- he's so loving and kind and gentle and he's hot, too.<eos> Yeah, he's, like, sexy as heck.<eos> Do you have a boyfriend?<eos> There's this one boy, but I don't know.<eos> What's his name?<eos> Wade.<eos> Holly's boy?<eos> You have a crush on Holly's boy?<eos> - No, not a crush exactly.<eos> - Yes, you do.
- ( pounding continues )<eos> - ( sizzling ) - ( vampire screaming )<eos> ( vampire ignites, screaming )<eos> Yes, brothers and sisters, it has been night a long, long time.<eos> But when I got up today, I prayed to God.<eos> I asked Him for guidance.<eos> I strained to listen.<eos> And He told me,<eos> "Morning is coming."<eos> Yes, He did.
Yes.<eos> He wasn't, though, was he?<eos> No, he wasn't.<eos> You still mourn for Joffrey?<eos> He was my husband.<eos> My king.<eos> He would have been your nightmare.<eos> Your Grace, I feel...<eos> You knew exactly what he was.<eos> I did, too.
That can't be.<eos> Our last working mine ran dry three years ago.<eos> Then how do we pay for anything?<eos> The crown owes the Iron Bank of Braavos a tremendous amount of money.<eos> How much?<eos> A tremendous amount.<eos> There must be someone at the Iron Bank you can speak to, come to some arrangement.<eos> The Iron Bank is the Iron Bank.<eos> There is no someone.<eos> Someone does work there.
But what he says about what they do, it's all true.<eos> It's exactly what the survivors of their raids report.<eos> Yes, imagine the stories wildlings tell about us.<eos> Love is the death of duty.<eos> I told that to your friend Jon Snow once.<eos> He didn't listen and neither did you.<eos> Which is why you've abandoned your watch atop the Wall to come here and read about the terrible things that may have happened to the girl you love.<eos> I don't love her.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> - No. Yes, you do.
I remember how it sounds.<eos> I was in love once.<eos> You were?<eos> You can imagine all manner of horrors befalling that poor girl and her child.<eos> Is it so difficult to imagine that an old person was once, more or less, like you?<eos> I'm sorry, Maester.<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> Do you know who I was before I came here?<eos> What I could have been if I'd only said the word?<eos> Of course you do.
My family doesn't live there anymore and someone burned it down.<eos> Oh. Does Winterfell have a Moon Door?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> It's not high up in the mountains.<eos> It's down on the ground.<eos> That sounds dangerous.<eos> - How do you make people fly?<eos> - We don't.<eos> What do you do with all the bad people and the scary people and the people you don't like?<eos> I never did anything with them at all.
Are you okay?<eos> Put on your seat belt.<eos> Is... is everything okay?<eos> What is okay?<eos> I've a car bashed up to hell! My boss angry at me!<eos> - I'll pay to have it fixed.<eos> - You pay nothing.<eos> The school has insurance.<eos> But the $500 deductible, who pays that?<eos> I do.
You're right to have that reaction, Marge.<eos> Why, I just figured, at home I sit with the family, so I assumed that...<eos> Have you ever drunk out of a toilet?<eos> I-I don't see what that has to do with the discussion.<eos> Dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Yeah, dogs eat in the kitchen.<eos> Y-You know, you're eating mostly horse hooves and tallow, right?<eos> You cool with that?<eos> Oh, and the ones that fall on the floor, you just eat those up, too, huh?<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, you do.
- Don't have it.<eos> - It's in the car.<eos> - I already searched the car.<eos> - What?<eos> You didn't break the window, did you?<eos> That's a custom tint.<eos> And I cut the ignition there, Leno, so don't think about running off. I'll have you know that I cannot make a damage claim this early into my new job.<eos> You tell me where the gun is, I'll let you live another 30 seconds.<eos> Come on, man, you don't wanna keep killing dudes.<eos> Yeah, I do.
What color shirt am I wearing?<eos> I'll take an answer to any one of these questions.<eos> [Phone beeps]<eos> Field trip.<eos> We're coming up on the end of the road, Shawn.<eos> Can we make a u-turn?<eos> We're also running out of gas.<eos> All right, Gus, if this is it, I really need you to know something.<eos> - I know, Shawn.<eos> - You do?

Have you chased me down to say you still don't want to get a drink with me?<eos> No, I... I changed my mind.<eos> I would like to get a drink with you...<eos> If you still want to, 'cause I know I've been really weird tonight...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would like that very much.<eos> I have a confession to make.<eos> I actually did have gum, but it was my last piece.<eos> So you lied to me.<eos> Yeah, I... did.
I just knew they hadn't run away.<eos> - Should have followed my instinct...<eos> - And not listen to me ?<eos> What's going on ?<eos> Am I talking to the cop or the psychologist?<eos> You're talking to a friend.<eos> Today Michele told me I'm not his mother. - Why ?<eos> - Because it's true.<eos> - I didn't know.<eos> - No one did.
You're not interested?<eos> It's not that, Mr. Ponzi...<eos> Have you seen other banks?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You have to go.<eos> I can't keep you.<eos> I can't pay you.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> You pull out.<eos> You always do.
It's so like ali to do this to her.<eos> Honey, we don't know anything about Where alison's been or what she's gone through.<eos> I'm trying to reserve judgment.<eos> Mom, alison was at the center of every mess That spencer got into.<eos> She's a walking time bomb, But it's never all who blows up.<eos> It's everything and everyone else around her.<eos> I understand running away.<eos> But to let your friends and family think You're dead?<eos> I really thought It was alison in that grave.<eos> We all did.
- He's back.<eos> That was him. In Robin Simons' house. That was him.<eos> Alex... what happened at your house?<eos> We think we know but we want you to tell us.<eos> We've found another victim.<eos> He's told us everything.<eos> Were photos taken in your house too?<eos> I can understand it isn't easy.<eos> I hope it happens to you one day.<eos> I really do.
- We're not all cavemen.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> - I can come.<eos> - Omega Psi!<eos> - I get that.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Classic.<eos> All right.<eos> So we serve about 300 people a day.<eos> We do pre-natal care, eye exams, dental services, wellness center.
License and registration, please.<eos> We could do it that way.<eos> You ask me for my papers.<eos> I tell you it's not my car, that I borrowed it... see where things go from there.<eos> We could do that.<eos> Or you could go get in your car and drive away.<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> Because some roads you shouldn't go down.<eos> Because maps used to say, "there be dragons here."<eos> Now they don't.
- Give him the pad.<eos> - You give him the pad.<eos> Give him the pad!<eos> One of you must give me the pad now.<eos> I thank you very much.<eos> Do you have a pencil?<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> You see that?<eos> It's amazing.<eos> They did it in The Big Lebowski.
♪ and all around me music fills the sky ♪<eos> ♪ There's music by the river ♪ and there's music in the grass ♪<eos> ♪ And the music makes your heart soar in reply ♪<eos> (cheers) Oh, thank you so much.<eos> You're too kind.<eos> Pinkie Pie: WOW!<eos> Oh.<eos> You um, you didn't hear me, um ...<eos> Singing in the most beautiful voice ever?<eos> Uh, yeah we did!
Now y'all go off and make yourselves look just like that.<eos> Who's our next model for the fashion show?<eos> Um...<eos> Apple Jewel?<eos> Who the hay is that?<eos> ♪ Is this some kinda joke?<eos> Why, Rarity, what ever would make you think I was joking?<eos> Because you would never wear an ensemble like that!<eos> You like plowing fields and hauling apples... And I can like fashion just as much.<eos> But you don't!
You shouldn't miss a wing beat or drop a hair in altitude and whatever you do, don't let go of it!<eos> Are you really, really, really, sure you're ready?<eos> I mean, I don't want to take it if you're not super sure.<eos> Ready!<eos> Ponyville can do so much better!<eos> I'll be back with a freshly painted one in no time!<eos> We were using that!<eos> And it's not like anypony else has color-coordinated horseshoes or anything!<eos> (sigh) I guess someponies do!<eos> Someponies do what?
And now I want you to slow down and pant.<eos> Pant!<eos> That's it!<eos> Good!<eos> Good!<eos> Slowly, gently. All right?<eos> Good girl, good girl!<eos> The head's delivered, Doris!<eos> I want my baby.<eos> Doing wonderfully, Doris.
I have an idea how to round it off.<eos> Indeed?<eos> But, it'll take a little organisation on your part... ..and I need it to be a complete surprise.<eos> All I'm saying is that you could have discussed it with me.<eos> Why?<eos> So you could try and change my mind?<eos> You're my brother.<eos> And this is my country!<eos> Everybody has a choice, George.<eos> Yes, they do.
Or, at least some of it.<eos> In return for my continued patronage.<eos> If you understand me?<eos> I can assure you I've quoted you my very best price.<eos> Are you an honest man, Mr Pratt?<eos> Of course, M'Lord!<eos> Thank you.<eos> That's all I need to know.<eos> You don't HAVE to go.<eos> Yes, I do.
Ohh! And he gave me this.<eos> Oh, Agnes, congratulations.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So, to what do I owe the pleasure?<eos> Felt.<eos> Felt?<eos> Yes, to line military coats.<eos> I need a great deal of it - and quickly.<eos> I trust you have suppliers.<eos> I do.
For God's sake, Henri.<eos> Call me by my name.<eos> It's good to see you, Agnes.<eos> Look at you.<eos> They will not even let me change my shirt.<eos> I look terrible.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What is it that they think you've done?<eos> They believe I have a link to Germany.<eos> And do you?
Let's not forget that we could be dealing with anybody who's crossed our path in the past.<eos> Peter and Logan, I want you in West Bear Valley.<eos> Antonio and I will cover Main Street.<eos> And I want the rest of you to check out the industrial area.<eos> You can change if you have to, but obviously, discretion is the key.<eos> How do you want to do this?<eos> - I'll go...<eos> - We split up.<eos> We split up, meet back here if we find nothing.<eos> Signal if we do.
Did you get an ax from the basement?<eos> No, sir.<eos> Did you go upstairs and have an argument with Abby Borden?<eos> No.<eos> Did you conspire with others to do away with your own parents in order to inherit their estate?<eos> Absolutely not!<eos> Did you see your father's face, dead on that sofa?<eos> Did you see his face?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
The state has spent months building a case against this woman.<eos> We can't just stop this trial because of a similarity.<eos> And so the idea being presented here is that there is yet another ax murderer loose in this very same city?<eos> I agree with Mr. Knowlton.<eos> The machinery we have impelled cannot be ground to a stop.<eos> The case will go on.<eos> And Miss Borden will be tried in the matter of which she was accused.<eos> The prosecution calls Miss Bridget Sullivan.<eos> Do you swear to tell the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
The cosmos, as revealed by science, is stranger than we ever could have imagined.<eos> Light and time and space and gravity conspire to create realities which lie beyond human experience.<eos> That's where we're headed.<eos> Come with me.<eos> Back in 1802, on a night like this, the astronomer William Herschel strolled the beach on the English coast, with his son John.<eos> Herschel was the first person ever to see into the deeper waters of the cosmic ocean.<eos> There he glimpsed the magic trick that light does with time.<eos> Father... do you believe in ghosts?<eos> Why, yes, my son!<eos> You, you do?
I once had a friend, very clever fellow, an astronomer and a parson at Leeds, by the name of John Michell.<eos> Poor man died when you were a babe, God rest his soul.<eos> He held that some stars are invisible.<eos> They really exist, but we shall never see them.<eos> "Dark stars," Michell called them.<eos> With all due respect, Father, surely your friend was mistaken.<eos> If no one can see them, then how can we possibly know they exist?<eos> Did you see the man who left those footprints, John?<eos> Why, no, Father.<eos> I did not.
Mr. Murphy.<eos> - Is this the guy?<eos> !<eos> - Mr. Murphy.<eos> - Please, just tell me, is this the guy? !<eos> - Mr. Murphy!<eos> I need to you to calm down.<eos> My son is missing.<eos> You know what that's like?<eos> No, I don't.
"Please send her my birthday wishes.<eos> "I am her father, "yet I was never around for her.<eos> "It's the biggest regret of my life.<eos> "I still remember "how you didn't want her to become a dancer.<eos> "You said only science and technology "could make a meaningful contribution to our country."<eos> It's true.<eos> Back then I was against it.<eos> And now?<eos> Does she still dance?<eos> Yes, she does.
Why?<eos> Who is he?<eos> His name is Bobby Cordero, I think he's the man who attacked you in the park that night.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Sorry, never saw him before.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Detective, I have said, I don't remember anything from that day.<eos> Do you understand whay "anything" means?<eos> I do.
Antoine.<eos> - I love what you've done.<eos> - Yes, we worked hard.<eos> A drink?<eos> Do you want to be an artist?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you get bored when there are people?<eos> I'm not bored, I'm looking.<eos> - Why don't you talk to people?<eos> - I do.
Go and see her.<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> OK?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't understand what you do to me.<eos> I hope you get your money.<eos> You've been waiting a long time.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I didn't mean what I said about Dad.<eos> Yes, you did.
Sometimes I come home late, hoping he'll be waiting for me.<eos> But he always comes home later.<eos> My son's apartment is empty.<eos> If you need somewhere private to study, I can lend it to you.<eos> Thanks, but that's not why I said it.<eos> Alice, I'm from the same world as you.<eos> I know it's hard to accept that people think we're important.<eos> But if you do, you'll be strong.<eos> Did Agnès ask you?<eos> No, she didn't.
I need a reason to see my family?<eos> We haven't heard from you in over a year.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - We're gonna need more than that.<eos> Come on, guys.<eos> Give him a break.<eos> He just wanted to see the baby.<eos> Really?<eos> Well, I don't see the baby.<eos> Do you, Frankie?
- Yeah.<eos> - Jane, I just want...<eos> - Do you have any idea what you did to us, what you did to Ma?<eos> I... look, it's hard for me to open up.<eos> Well, try.<eos> You put your family through hell, and I for one would like to know why.<eos> You were a good Dad.<eos> We were a-a good family.<eos> We had good times, right?<eos> Yes, we did.
You know who "A" is.<eos> I'm not so sure anymore.<eos> Oh, cut it, Spencer.<eos> First it was Mona, then it wasn't.<eos> Maybe I know or maybe I'm just looking into another mask.<eos> Ali is alive.<eos> Who told you that?<eos> Never mind.<eos> She's alive and you know how to find her.<eos> No, I don't.
I'm just really tired, that's all.<eos> We both know what's going on here.<eos> I think it's time we address the issue... don't you?<eos> The path you've been going down is very dangerous.<eos> I have to go.<eos> What are you wearing?<eos> It's nothing, I...<eos> I had to change.<eos> And this is all I had in my gym locker.<eos> Did you?
I was afraid that you wouldn't forgive me.<eos> I met Alison in college.<eos> She lied about her age and I believed her.<eos> I don't want to hear this.<eos> I don't want to hear it.<eos> I just want to get off.<eos> Aria, please, just listen to me.<eos> Nothing you say will change anything.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.

They are fighting.<eos> When I come home, he barely even talks to me.<eos> - So stop working.<eos> I wouldn t have to work if...<eos> - If what?<eos> Why did Toni get that job, and not you?<eos> - They offered it.<eos> I refused.<eos> - You refused?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Kid's name was Sidney... and we found this medallion from a '76 Hornet.<eos> It's a lousy car, but it had a cool medallion.<eos> And he started fightin' me for it... and we ended up beatin' each other down this hill, and the hill just dropped off, you know?<eos> Dumped us on some rocks.<eos> Sidney landed funny, and I came down on top of him.<eos> And, when I got up... he was just starin' at the sky.<eos> His neck was turnin' purple.<eos> So, I ran home and told my dad.<eos> I took him out to show him... and he takes a look... and tells me to go home.<eos> So, I do.
You gonna be all right to play tonight?<eos> Hey, you don't happen to know where Jean's brother is, do you?<eos> Parents are lookin' for him.<eos> They think he was hanging out with Phillip Kopus last night.<eos> That sound right to you?<eos> I thought that Jean was with Kopus last night.<eos> No, she was at a friend's house.<eos> She don't know where Brian is, either.<eos> You sure you don't know where he is?<eos> No, I don't.
Don't really want it anymore.<eos> You sure?<eos> 'Cause it kind of seems like you still want it.<eos> Hey, Junebug, you want to get...<eos> "Junebug"?<eos> It's just a nickname.<eos> Yeah, I have one for you, too...<eos> Tessa... dactyl.<eos> I texted you after school to see if you wanted to get a yogurt, and you said you had plans?<eos> And I do, with Junebug.
She heard at least two people who giggled.<eos> One of them was a girl.<eos> She fainted.<eos> She woke up an hour later.<eos> Nude.<eos> All her clothes were gone.<eos> May I see.<eos> Carl?<eos> Sunday.<eos> Well done, Henning.
- When I find her...<eos> Don't be an idiot.<eos> Lay low for now and erase all traces of our work.<eos> - What the hell, Ditlev.<eos> - We have not seen each other and will not again.<eos> - What if they find her?<eos> - She has dug herself into a hole.<eos> Finally she disappeared altogether.<eos> - What if they find her?<eos> - Then we do it.
I will certainly try...<eos> The rubies in that necklace were blood-red.<eos> I don't expect civil servants to understand how impressive that is, but I do expect you to get them back.<eos> If there's any other details the two of you can remember...<eos> Mr. Powell? What?<eos> Oh, uh... no. I'm sorry.<eos> I have to get this done before sundown.<eos> Adrian is convinced the gunmen will come back, so he's decided to change every lock in our house.<eos> You know how to change locks?<eos> No, he does not.
I'm happy for what has happened to you.<eos> But when you're done telling me about your fancy new life, you go back to your room.<eos> You don't think to ask how my day was.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Is it?<eos> Alejandro can treat me like the help.<eos> I don't care.<eos> But you...<eos> I thought I mattered to you.<eos> Of course you do.
My mother is a leader of the Trags.<eos> There's not much I don't know.<eos> But why are you helping out now?<eos> It's time I embraced my destiny.<eos> Nicely done.<eos> If it wasn't for your speech, the integration program and your father's work would've gone down the drain.<eos> You wouldn't have given up on integration, though.<eos> No.<eos> But I'm only interested in programs that work.<eos> Thanks to you, this one still does.
Ours was to be a transitional generation...<eos> Ensuring that 3 generations from now mankind could go home.<eos> But everything has changed, and we will either be the generation that sees the human race return to Earth...<eos> Or upon whose watch... It finally ends.<eos> My son is already down there.<eos> I sent him.<eos> And the truth is I don't know if he is alive or dead.<eos> But I still have hope.<eos> How does the Chancellor vote?<eos> I don't.
- Over and over. Just get a normal job and an apartment like everybody else and stop bloodsucking.<eos> - He's been angry like this always at me. - lt's okay.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> I think it is possibly because he is internally battling a sexual desire for me.<eos> Holy dogshit! HANNAH:<eos> That's a weird one. That's a weird one for me.<eos> I'm sorry, guys. It doesn't take a psychiatrist to correlate Adam's romantic interest in you with a repressed fantasy toward me.<eos> - I don't want to fuck my sister.<eos> - No one is saying you do.<eos> Caroline just did.
Good night, Tricia.<eos> What do you think?<eos> We'll see.<eos> The idea is to take color theory and turn it on its head.<eos> Break all the rules.<eos> They're gorgeous.<eos> Who'd you say your client is?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I was just wondering if maybe I knew him.<eos> You don't.
Welcome to the party, pal.<eos> Cass, how we lookin'?<eos> Most of Sam's internal burns have healed.<eos> I should be able to fix the rest.<eos> What's your name?<eos> I thought I knew every angel in heaven, but I've never seen you.<eos> Why would I tell you anything?<eos> Well, I don't give a damn who you are.<eos> You need to get out -- now!<eos> And if I don't?
We'll do this the fun way.<eos> See?<eos> Not real.<eos> Like I said.<eos> I know how possession works, Sam.<eos> You've seen everything that he's seen, even if you can't remember.<eos> That's what I need you to do.<eos> I need you to remember.<eos> Did I kill Kevin?<eos> No, you didn't.
We think she's in trouble.<eos> Real trouble. Jasper too.<eos> We know he likes a flutter. That's fine. We won't tell anyone.<eos> We just wondered if you'd seen him with any...you know, bad types.<eos> It's all bad types in here, love.<eos> How'd your friend get rolled up in this?<eos> She and Jasper had a thing going on the side. Selling.<eos> Yeah, I heard about that.<eos> All right, I know Jasper.<eos> Everyone does.
Well, if you're here to see Sarah, you have a strange way of showing it.<eos> You didn't tell mother, did you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I was quick enough on my feet to cover for you.<eos> Assuming it's Anna you're here for.<eos> Yes.<eos> I should have guessed with all the trips to the city.<eos> She's been talking to you about Gino.<eos> You know about him?<eos> I do now.
I don't have anything that I want to ask her.<eos> What do you think she'd say about me?<eos> Let's just... let's just stop talking about this.<eos> We came all this way.<eos> Let's just enjoy the view.<eos> Okay. It's nice.<eos> It is nice, I told you.<eos> Does she supply her own eggs?<eos> I mean, I don't want to go, but I want to know if she supplies her own eggs.<eos> Oh my God. Does she?
It was fun.<eos> Yeah, it was nice just to hang out.<eos> Can I tell you something?<eos> Of course.<eos> I was sort of thinking about it today, and I think it might be cool with me if you...<eos> You want me to fuck you?<eos> Yeah. - Okay. - But not today.<eos> Oh. I feel like maybe I opened up enough today.<eos> If you know what I mean.<eos> But I do.
What am I looking at? - My W-2.<eos> - Box one is my last reported income at IBM. - Whoo-hoo.<eos> It's also what 200% of quota looks like.<eos> The golden circle.<eos> I'll break numbers.<eos> I always do.<eos> You answer to me. I'm SVP of sales, so you're dog shit around here until you close a deal.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - I do.<eos> All right: "Do." Good.
Don't you realize what you wrote?<eos> You wrote a treasure map.<eos> If you see him around, I wanna meet that guy.<eos> There's a project I want to discuss with him.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> "This puts the future squarely in the hands of those who know computers not for what they are, but for everything they have the potential to be."<eos> What?<eos> You know who said that?<eos> No, no, I don't.
Because I want to build a machine that nobody else has the balls to build.<eos> Wow, you're serious.<eos> Look, that's a terrible idea.<eos> - For such a multitude of reasons that I... because it's illegal.<eos> Worst-case scenario, IBM sues us into the ground.<eos> Uh, Cardiff finds out, then both of us would be on the street.<eos> Apple, IBM, they have the market sewn up.<eos> Plus, you got Commodore, Tandy, Texas Instruments.<eos> I'm sorry, but you missed it.<eos> We all did.
I'm a realist.<eos> I know what small towns are like, Sian, and I know exactly how those lads are going to react.<eos> - You think so?<eos> - I know so.<eos> I'm standing on a bloody picket with them day after day.<eos> It was a majority decision.<eos> The committee decided.<eos> I hope you and your bloody committee can guarantee their safety, Sian.<eos> I do.<eos> I really do.
She's finding her feet.<eos> Right, gentlemen, listen to me.<eos> A police officer only has the right to detain a group of people...<eos> You need evidence to stand up in a court of law. They need evidence. Detain them for longer than 24 hours--<eos> There's no proof.<eos> No proof.<eos> And I will not be leaving this desk until you do.<eos> We've got all day, so chop—chop.<eos> - Nobody said anything about hiding who we are.<eos> - Yes, they did.
Is that what you want?<eos> No family?<eos> Hiding from people at work? From everyone?<eos> Keeping secrets?<eos> Come here.<eos> - So now Cliff will speak on behalf of the LGSM.<eos> Floor's yours, Cliff.<eos> Well, what I want to say abo--<eos> About the gays and lesbians-<eos> Why don't you do us a poem, Cliff?
We gotta find him or we're fucked, okay?<eos> Go.<eos> Will you answer that fuckin' phone?<eos> No, sorry, it's nothing important.<eos> Daniele, I can't talk.<eos> Wait, don't hang up.<eos> I'm working.<eos> - Don't get pissed.<eos> - Then you don't understand?<eos> No, you don't.
- Am I right?<eos> - Right.<eos> - Right, so give me a pound! - Aah!<eos> Okay. No... no pound.<eos> So far, the reunion was a little more "Troubled Water" than "Homeward Bound."<eos> Wow, so, you're telling me it's not even an elective.<eos> Correct.<eos> It's a class required for graduation.<eos> Uh, but how does senior tanning enrich students academically?<eos> It doesn't.
That was a field call, not an order.<eos> Did Weatherly know?<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> You think I'm set up on you?<eos> Are you?<eos> No.<eos> But I'm clocking two of your pavement artists right now.<eos> You've had me in a floating box since I left Angel's Bluff.<eos> Weatherly didn't know.<eos> The president still doesn't.
Keep an eye on her.<eos> I cannot believe she ate a whole brownie. She is gonna be down for the count in about 20 minutes.<eos> Awesome!<eos> Um, do you wanna play quarters or something?<eos> Cool. Give us a minute?<eos> ♪ Boy uh, I'll go get some beers.<eos> I don't wanna ruin what is clearly going well for you with cute and nice over there, but I thought that flock of seagulls boy with the grouchy attitude was more your speed.<eos> He is. Scott's a friend.<eos> Oh, your boy didn't show, huh?<eos> No, he did.
Look who's putting the pressure on now.<eos> I think you can handle it.<eos> The morning after a big bash can be exciting... or surprising.<eos> What's the rush?<eos> Oh, I gotta go.<eos> If my girlfriend finds out, she'll totally dump me.<eos> You have a girlfriend?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I thought you knew.<eos> I did not.
How do you know I'm here to bet on a horse?<eos> We're in front of the O.T.B.<eos> And a deli and a hair center for men.<eos> You told me you come up here and bet.<eos> I love the idea that betting relaxes you.<eos> It did until you showed up.<eos> Look, I've been thinking about you a lot.<eos> I was hoping to find you.<eos> I don't know where you live.<eos> Very few people do.
I know.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't understand what's happening to me.<eos> I-I'm a scientist.<eos> I know that sex is a purely physical act.<eos> But with you, it's... it's more.<eos> It's like I crave you.<eos> I keep searching for this biological explanation, but there's none.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I do.
I mean, I'm just cold.<eos> Okay.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - You're okay.<eos> - We're okay.<eos> Why? No.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to scare you.<eos> I... I didn't.
Obviously not as good as my pancakes, but good.<eos> What's that smell?<eos> - These...<eos> These are burning. - What?<eos> This bread isn't battered.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - You forgot to batter the bread.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> It...<eos> - Yes, you did.
What does this feel like to you?<eos> It's me.<eos> Please.<eos> Please, help me.<eos> Help me.<eos> Take it out, please.<eos> Take it out.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> Don't...
We could lose district. - Who cares?<eos> - Everybody cares.<eos> Everybody!<eos> All right, yeah, whatever.<eos> Fucker!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> So what do you want to know?<eos> What do you want to tell me?<eos> What's important in your life right now?<eos> I don't...
It's more than that.<eos> Think about it.<eos> You have the opportunity to shape a future generation.<eos> Convert them, if you want.<eos> Everybody nowadays is just trying to eat sustainably.<eos> Why can't we do that?<eos> Together?<eos> I honestly don't know whether to wish you luck or not.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> - I don't.
I don't wanna kill you.<eos> I am sick and tired of trading guilt trips with you, Kenny.<eos> So I'm gonna say this one more time.<eos> Pick it up!<eos> You think I'm afraid of dying?<eos> You know, I was gonna leave that cell on my 18th birthday, get sick and die in my own piss and vomit.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I don't have any memories of touching my dad's hand, or what my mom smells like.<eos> You told me that a relationship between a vampire and his maker was special.<eos> - Yes, I did!
The ones I dusted were weak-willed bottom feeders.<eos> If I didn't stop them, there would be some other couple, family, just like you and I, that they will destroy.<eos> That was 200 years ago!<eos> Oh no, that's tonight or tomorrow or a century from now, and it'll never end.<eos> Suzanna, you're killing people.<eos> You're not just killing them.<eos> You're wiping them from existence, and all because they drink blood.<eos> Now, I saw the way that you fought, and there is no way you could've pulled that off without drinking.<eos> You're right.<eos> I do!
I was just trying to help, Zoe.<eos> That's the lie you tell yourself every time, but you possessed bodies even though you knew it was wrong.<eos> You shredded ghosts...<eos> Because you couldn't accept yourself.<eos> You sent Nick to limbo, and then you brought him back as a zombie.<eos> Now you're gonna do the same with this lil' smokie girl!<eos> Nobody knows I messed up more than I do.<eos> I've had a lot of time and multiple dimensions to think about my guilt.<eos> Do you think I like coming here and being scorned by you?<eos> I really don't.
That's your... that's your thing.<eos> They might have been nice when they were alive, but as ghosts, they're ratched-ass bitches.<eos> They're fine!<eos> What did you do?<eos> I banished them from the house!<eos> You're welcome!<eos> You shouldn't have done that!<eos> I couldn't stand here and watch them talk to you like that!<eos> I deserve this.<eos> I really do.
But they get love.<eos> They get to be with someone.<eos> What do I get?<eos> Glad you asked me, son.<eos> I get to either be with someone like me, and that ends in disaster,<eos> or I get to be alone or I get to live a lie.<eos> Those are my choices, right?<eos> What, you don't want me to compel you? Hmm?<eos> I will do it!<eos> No, I don't.
- This is what happened.<eos> Hallowed be thy...<eos> It's what was meant to be.<eos> I apologize for the theatrics.<eos> I had to flush you out.<eos> You came in here practically glowing.<eos> Live blood, I can smell it on you.<eos> Who was it?<eos> Did you kill her?<eos> Of course you did.
My life right now is so much better than it used to be, and I'm really not blaming anyone for little hiccups.<eos> Oh God!<eos> Changing into a wolf is not a little hiccup.<eos> Honestly though, I've seen you change, and every month, you hum and haw and hiss and pooh-pooh on it, and it really doesn't seem that bad.<eos> I'm just gonna say it.<eos> - Sally, I'm sorry.<eos> - Stop apologizing.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> You don't know what this curse is yet.<eos> You don't.
Actually, Terrance, this is a synthetic substance.<eos> Devised for zombie vegans.<eos> Or "zegans."<eos> Meh.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You weren't answering your phone.<eos> I was worried you might have been bitten.<eos> Oh.<eos> Zombies not able to control selves.<eos> All we do bite, bite, bite.
And it's a little bit hard to do that when I just turned the next leader of Boston, ok?<eos> I understand a weakness for our kids, but I thought after that girl, after you dried up, I thought you were done with all this.<eos> The pain that you felt after killing Isaac.<eos> That never really goes away completely, does it?<eos> No.<eos> Well, then why would you wish that on me?<eos> Don't ask me to do that to Kenny.<eos> You're asking me to look the other way while people die.<eos> I didn't know what he was up to.<eos> I really didn't.
Reranked all the DoctorWhos by puffiness of the hair.<eos> Oh, and I also got married to my actual, non-imaginary, comic-tolerating girlfriend, Strawberry.<eos> Now when Milo talks to himself, it won't seem crazy.<eos> So, Milo talks to himself.<eos> We will treasure that information.<eos> Yes... we will.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm gonna share this primo origin ish with my bride.<eos> Even the mintiest comic is just acidifying pulp, if you have no one to read it with, right?<eos> Nerds don't get girls.<eos> These days they do, man.
Oh, yes, I remember that painting.<eos> And that is the man I sold it to.<eos> And that man sold it to me!<eos> That proves the painting is mine!<eos> And nothing can stop me from selling it and keeping all the money!<eos> I love art!<eos> Art?<eos> What do you know about art?<eos> You don't even know who painted that picture.<eos> Yes, I do.
Wait, so, you're saying there's a lot of folks online that are pretty die-hard about this thing?<eos> You throw the right Tibetan symbol into the mix, you dumb asses ever think the Thinman comes to life as a tulpa?<eos> Because thousands of people can agree that Thinman is any one thing?<eos> The lore changes blog to blog.<eos> He's not a tulpa.<eos> Right here, right now, cut the crap.<eos> Do either of you actually know what Thinman is?<eos> No. We just play supernaturalists on tv.<eos> We have no idea what we're doing.<eos> Of course we do.
Why?<eos> Because he is a weird guy, okay?<eos> He's a weird, dorky, little guy.<eos> But he happens to have an army of Angels behind him, and, even though I hate to say it, if we're gonna take a shot at Metatron, they might be useful.<eos> Well, do you think we need the First Blade?<eos> Why don't we just leave that here?<eos> We talked about this, and we decided that --<eos> No.<eos> In all fairness, we didn't decide.<eos> You did.
Yeah.<eos> Lately, he seems to be...<eos> Amped up -- you know, on edge.<eos> Effects of the mark?<eos> What else?<eos> He does seem angry.<eos> I mean, he's always a little angry, but now it seems like...<eos> More.<eos> I think a part of him actually believed that I ordered those angels to, you know...<eos> Sam, you don't, do you?
They told you about that, huh?<eos> We had a deal.<eos> Yeah, well, it was a stupid deal.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause if you'd stuck to it, Tessa would still be alive.<eos> Without her, we ain't got jack.<eos> Yeah, you think I don't know that?<eos> You think I wanted that to happen?<eos> I don't know, Dean.<eos> Did you?
Whoever thought<eos> Genny, this is the fourth<eos> That's three<eos> - This is the fourth.<eos> That's enough, I gotta go to work.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - You couldn't take any more, huh?<eos> Shut up and blow me<eos> Dad looks great, Ciro.<eos> Even in maximum security, double or triple maximum security... he always does great
Gennaro...<eos> Thanks for calling me,<eos> I'm glad to be with you at this moment.<eos> There are no words.<eos> C'mon, Ciro, there's room for you too.<eos> Mom's not in there, nothing's in there,<eos> Mom's gone.<eos> Do you believe in God?<eos> The God who sees all, knows all.<eos> I do.
You go into a situation thinking it's one thing and, the next thing you know, your wallet is empty and you can't look at yourself in the mirror.<eos> Why don't you just ask for the jacket back?<eos> He shouldn't have to, all right?<eos> The lendee should return the item to the lender without being asked.<eos> It's the social contract.<eos> All right, guys. Here you go.<eos> Will wants his jacket back.<eos> What?<eos> Bobby, what are you...<eos> I don't...

- Sixteenth century.<eos> It, um, broke when it was being shipped, into a thousand pieces.<eos> It took specialists over a year to restore it.<eos> - Here, I want you to have it.<eos> - I can't accept gifts.<eos> No, no.<eos> Not as a gift. No.<eos> As a reminder of how hard it can be to put something back together again once it's been crushed.<eos> If you're going to threaten me, you don't have to go to the trouble of veiling it.<eos> I don't usually do interviews with reporters.
Sorry I'm late, Captain.<eos> What was it this time, Mr. Allen?<eos> Forgot to set the alarm?<eos> Before you answer, remember you the excuse last time...<eos> It was... " car trouble .".<eos> Wondering why do I remember?<eos> I do not have a car.<eos> He made me an errand to me.<eos> Barry? , Got me what I asked for?<eos> Yes, yes, I did.
I love you, baby.<eos> Always remember that.<eos> Swear to keep this place secret.<eos> No human can know about it.<eos> Eljida and your son's life depend on it.<eos> Mommy... I want Mommy.<eos> I want Mommy...<eos> You'll see your mother again.<eos> I really believe that.<eos> After today, I do, too.
It was hard for her.<eos> They didn't use the same words they... they do now-- postpartum depression...<eos> Anyway, I-I didn't understand it.<eos> I didn't take it seriously enough.<eos> Your mother was a good woman, Maggie.<eos> If she did anything wrong, it was my fault.<eos> I should have been more understanding.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Did you know that Agent Bellamy has gone over my head and gotten a federal court order to open the tomb?<eos> I did.
Have you seen my toolbox?<eos> Who are you talking to?<eos> No one.<eos> What did you do, Ray?<eos> He's gone.<eos> Yeah, just make sure that we have the north side of Montgomery covered.<eos> I thought you had cars posted outside.<eos> We had all cars to the robbery.<eos> How the hell did he get away so fast?<eos> Maybe he didn't.
How did that go?<eos> Good.<eos> Helped me realize something...<eos> You were right.<eos> Valentina does deserve the best.<eos> And that piece of crap doesn't even come close.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You said you didn't know how to write lyrics.<eos> I don't.
But you have to know, I never stopped loving you.<eos> Then why didn't you want to see me the last time I was here?<eos> Last time?<eos> Four years ago.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I went through this phase, thought I wanted to know where I came from.<eos> So I hired a private detective.<eos> He tracked you down.<eos> But when I came here and asked to meet you, your father told me you didn't want anything to do with me.<eos> He did what?
He's shooting a commercial.<eos> What are you doing tonight?<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> It's Friday night.<eos> I've got crazy plans.<eos> Gonna drink tea and write in my therapy journal.<eos> Why don't you call some friends and have them come over?<eos> My uncle wouldn't like that. No!<eos> He wants you to have a good time.<eos> We both do.
So you're about to be single.<eos> Isn't there a chance you two could work it out?<eos> You seem so devoted to each other.<eos> Yeah, I got caught red-handed.<eos> There was this gorgeous writer.<eos> We were in Chicago together. - On a book tour?<eos> - Good guess.<eos> And one thing led to another and...<eos> [Chuckling] You know how it goes.<eos> I do. [Chuckles]

[Chuckles]<eos> I really do.
Carmen and I are not romantically involved.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> That's because you're confused.<eos> Hey, your mom and I are gonna make sure that you get the help that you need.<eos> I want to talk to Carmen.<eos> She refuses to step into this house until you're gone.<eos> That's how much you've upset her.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Carmen loves me.<eos> No, she doesn't.
I don't want anyone in the family knowing about this.<eos> Promise me you won't say anything. Okay.<eos> But you have to start taking this thing seriously, mom.<eos> I mean, what are we gonna do if your kidneys fail completely?<eos> Relax.<eos> I gave up food in the '80s.<eos> I see no reason why I can't give up fluids, as well.<eos> Give me Henri's number.<eos> I just promised mom I wouldn't call him.<eos> Yeah, but I didn't.
Not really.<eos> You're more of a mother to me than she is.<eos> You do realize you're older than me, right?<eos> What is a mother, anyway?<eos> It's someone who cares about you and teaches you how to behave and makes you feel safe.<eos> All right.<eos> If you really think of me as your mother...<eos> And I'm not sure how I feel about that.<eos> But if you mean that...<eos> I do.
I love having a child.<eos> Miguel makes me very happy.<eos> You know what I love having?<eos> A dream.<eos> And the day my dream comes true, I'm gonna be as happy as you are.<eos> What if it doesn't come true?<eos> What?<eos> Well, lots of people have dreams that don't work out, Or they get their dream and then it goes wrong.<eos> That's not gonna happen to me.<eos> But what if it does?
Zoila's Pablo.<eos> Her ex-husband?<eos> Her current husband, but thanks for asking.<eos> Is she here?<eos> She's making breakfast.<eos> That smells good.<eos> If you invite him to eat with us, I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to talk.<eos> - No, we don't.<eos> We really, really do.
How can I help you, detectives?<eos> We're trying to build a time line for the night of your husband's accident.<eos> Do you know when he left the house to go for his run?<eos> I was in bed reading, and I fell asleep.<eos> Can't Nick tell you?<eos> He doesn't remember much, which isn't surprising.<eos> I wish I could be more helpful.<eos> This is a big property.<eos> Do you have security cameras?<eos> We do.
I need to disappear for a while.<eos> What kind of trouble?<eos> Ethan, before you go, I need to ask you something.<eos> Make it quick.<eos> Why... Why did Nicholas let your mother live here all these years?<eos> Did she have something on him?<eos> I'm not sure what it was, but yeah.<eos> She had something.<eos> Of course, mom couldn't really tell anyone because Nick saw her push Dahlia off the bridge.<eos> We both did.
There's a medical?<eos> What a personality!<eos> Come in, please.<eos> I'll leave you to it.<eos> You need to understand that what is happening to you is both a great opportunity and a great misfortune.<eos> You're rich. You can buy anything. Give gifts.<eos> But be careful. Why?<eos> You must be wary.<eos> When you have money, people love you.<eos> People already do.
What did you do?<eos> She won't stop talking about you. Spend the night, then don't call?<eos> Some gentleman!<eos> You didn't tell me?<eos> He doesn't give a shit about you.<eos> Is she pregnant?<eos> I know a doc.<eos> You gonna help or just commentate?<eos> You spent the night with her?<eos> Yes, he did.
I'm sure you guys know what it's like.<eos> Where are you from?<eos> I just moved here from the city, from New York to live with my dad.<eos> So what happened with your man?<eos> Oh, please.<eos> How many hours do you have?<eos> It's complicated, but I'm trying to stay away from guy drama and focus on school.<eos> Speaking of which, have you seen the college apps?<eos> I don't know where to start.<eos> I do.
All right, everyone, write down your pick for cheer captain.<eos> Another for Lissa.<eos> Good choice, Trina.<eos> Wow, this is a tight race.<eos> In fact, it's dead even.<eos> Lissa doesn't even want to be cheer captain.<eos> Well, if I'm called to serve, I guess I'd have no choice.<eos> Jenna, the equipment girl, may I have your ballot, please?<eos> - I get a vote?<eos> - No, you don't.
Shelagh, leave him to his own devices.<eos> We both left him to his own devices, if you remember, the day he was taken ill!<eos> I don't deserve that and neither do you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> We're both sorry.<eos> And he's an 11-year-old boy.<eos> Polio or no polio, he needs to spread his wings.<eos> I don't know what I'm going to do with myself.<eos> I do.
Max Simkin.<eos> Well, Max, I'm Carmen Herrara from the Lower East Side Action Committee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Basically, we're dedicated to the preservation and rejuvenation of the Lower East Side. Uh-huh.<eos> We're trying to stop real estate developers from converting the neighborhood into luxury housing and retail spaces, forcing the regular people out.<eos> How are they forcing them out? Money.<eos> I mean, they buy them out or they raise the rent.<eos> How much do you think I'd get for a place like this?<eos> That doesn't matter.<eos> It does to me.
Elaine Greenawalt? Yeah, that's it.<eos> You know her?<eos> Her company owns Mr. Solomon's building.<eos> She's got a pretty nice place upstate too.<eos> You went to her house?<eos> This is the building.<eos> Once he's gone, they can sell the whole block.<eos> It's worth a fortune. Wow.<eos> You really think you can stop them?<eos> Of course, I do.
Who?<eos> Leonard Solomon.<eos> He doesn't live here anymore.<eos> He moved. Really?<eos> Somebody should tell him that.<eos> Oh, and by the way.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Sir, can you step over here, please?<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> I didn't do...
If I hadn't confronted Murphy, none of this would have happened.<eos> How could you know it'd go down like that?<eos> Bellamy knew.<eos> We think the grounders are a threat.<eos> Now we're killing each other.<eos> There have to be consequences.<eos> We can't just let them hang people.<eos> Hopefully, we figure it out before Murphy kills us for helping her.<eos> He's not the forgive and forget type.<eos> - How did you...
With a family who loves you.<eos> Please, Pop, leave me alone.<eos> Just... (cries)<eos> I didn't do right by you when you were little.<eos> I was in jail when you were a baby.<eos> I never got to take care of you, you know?<eos> Let me take care of you now, please.<eos> Okay, here we go.<eos> You think Gustavo wants to help us get out of here?<eos> I do, too.
- Hundreds are heading to complain to Pilate.<eos> - What?<eos> He'll have them cut down before they can get anywhere near him.<eos> - Thieves!<eos> - Scum!<eos> Filthy Roman scum!<eos> Just give it back!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your god brings it?<eos> No, he does not.
- What?<eos> He'll have them cut down before they can get anywhere near him.<eos> - Thieves!<eos> - Scum!<eos> Filthy Roman scum!<eos> Just give it back!<eos> Jerusalem needs water.<eos> You think your god brings it?<eos> No, he does not.<eos> Rome does.
You focus all your energy on one guy, and you end up freaking him out.<eos> Daniel's feeling the pressure all the way in Virginia.<eos> - Vermont.<eos> - Same thing.<eos> The point is, Daniel won't ever call until you go out with someone else.<eos> Trust me.<eos> That's how the universe works.<eos> Karen: So, you knew Jacob liked me?<eos> Of course.<eos> We all did.
You are.<eos> You're the bad guy, Savi.<eos> You're the most selfish woman I've ever known.<eos> You only chose me because you thought I might die.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> You had months to take me back, but you couldn't make up your mind.<eos> You were in.<eos> You were out.<eos> And then you just totally disappeared.<eos> I didn't...
Okay. Well, the camel guy showed up, so that's a relief.<eos> What would I have done with this fork-horned saddle?<eos> You're late.<eos> Did you get the votives?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> Why not?<eos> Seriously?<eos> Harry, I got a camel...<eos> A real, live, leaf-eating, cud-chewing camel.<eos> I did lanterns instead.
And tell her, um...<eos> Well, you know what to say.<eos> I do.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I love you.<eos> Dr. Bickman.<eos> Can I help you?<eos> You know, I can't stop thinking about last time.<eos> Well, it was a mistake. It will never happen again.<eos> - It just did. - No. No!
Really?<eos> See, I can't stop thinking about you.<eos> I can't forget what it felt like to be with you, and I don't think that you've forgotten, either.<eos> I've told you plenty of times<eos> - I have a fianc?<eos> - You're engaged to a cook.<eos> - His name is Will.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> If you are serious about this man and you feel nothing for me, why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.

I'll call her.<eos> It was rude of me.<eos> I'll apologize.<eos> So, what's up?<eos> I have a favor to ask.<eos> Need you to make me something.<eos> It's for a patient.<eos> Hunter showed up at the hospital.<eos> - Did you know that?<eos> - No, I didn't.
Long ago, I was going through some rough years, trying to make ends meet.<eos> Me and the wife were living on toast and baked beans.<eos> But every Thanksgiving, somebody would leave a turkey on the bar big enough to feed my whole family.<eos> One year, I go to the bar early,<eos> I see your father sneaking in to leave the bird.<eos> We gave thanks because of your dad.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> I can't make this decision for you.<eos> I don't want to disappoint Esme or Joshua.<eos> Of course, I don't.
It's okay. I want to hear all about it. Yes.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm...<eos> I'm still waiting on a sitter.<eos> I had to check on another patient.<eos> There's some people with cancer this way.<eos> We can go cure them over here.<eos> Come on.<eos> - Watch here.<eos> - Did you see his eye?<eos> I did.
Previously on "Black Box"...<eos> I'd like to propose a-a toast to the brilliant woman who I'm now going to be spending the rest of my life with.<eos> What happened between us... It was meaningless sex.<eos> Why do you want me to touch you again?<eos> - I don't.
You left a note.<eos> "No obligations. No strings."<eos> - Yeah, your motto.<eos> - Your words.<eos> I take them at face value, which I assume is what you want.<eos> Well, it's what you want, isn't it?<eos> I'm open.<eos> You want to talk about this?<eos> Sure.<eos> If you do.
- Thank you.<eos> - You owe me.<eos> So... talk to me.<eos> We're getting nowhere on the Wayne case.<eos> I made a promise to Bruce Wayne and I can't deliver.<eos> But you will.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe I'm out of my depth.<eos> Hey. I very much doubt you're out of your depth, but even if you are, you know how to swim, don't you?<eos> Yes, I do.
I managed to get Tracey off of me, and then I ran.<eos> It was too dark for her to see me, I guess.<eos> I ducked into the first lab I could find, and then I came here.<eos> I thought for sure you were dead.<eos> That makes two of us.<eos> Jaye, I...<eos> Don't beat yourself up for closing that door.<eos> You thought I was right behind you.<eos> Looks like we make a pretty good team.<eos> We do, don't we? Good.
Anywhere you interact with other people opens us up to risk.<eos> I'm just supposed to slave away at the fucking call center and then lock myself in the apartment.<eos> - Don't get dramatic.<eos> - I like the fellowship. Okay?<eos> There there's nothing to worry about there.<eos> All it takes is one person's cousin to visit from Lynchburg.<eos> Someone you went to school with or some client that you spent the night with.<eos> - Those guys would never end up here.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> Yeah. I do.
Not murder.<eos> Take the plea. Be good.<eos> Get out early.<eos> Everybody's fucked me.<eos> If I was trying to fuck you, I wouldn't be here.<eos> He's gonna get away with it, isn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> He is.<eos> - Take an iced tea if you have any.<eos> - We don't.
- and you've taken advantage--<eos> - I'm not kicking her out.<eos> - I could have said nothing, but I told you.<eos> She better be gone by the next time we talk.<eos> - Sir.<eos> - What took you so long?<eos> I can have a briefing ready in five minutes.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> I had Seth do it. He doesn't have security clearance.<eos> Well, he does now.
There's the real cruelty.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Actually you are.<eos> Straight to hell.<eos> It's impossible!<eos> I'm immortal.<eos> Wrong.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> Tough shit.<eos> Who does?
Da Vinci, wait!<eos> You'll fail.<eos> Oh, fuck!<eos> Fuck!<eos> The palace can be breached.<eos> That furnace.<eos> Yes.<eos> The grate providing ventilation for the blacksmith's forge.<eos> Dragonetti said that was too dangerous.<eos> He did.
This time it'll be more than a search.<eos> Destroy everything!<eos> Clothes and jewels.<eos> Strip the walls!<eos> I swear by all that's good that I'd tell you, if I knew.<eos> Spare my house.<eos> Why should I, when my own house has been sacked by that scoundrel Brilhac, who calls himself General?<eos> You're lucky to be alive!<eos> Maurice, tell them, if you know of a hiding place.<eos> I don't, mother.
Where's that secret room?<eos> Alexandre knows it.<eos> Take your father, while there's time.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I thought it was in the house.<eos> I've spent hours looking for it.<eos> I could have stopped you falling from that horse.<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't tell you where the ditch was.<eos> No, you didn't.
Why not?<eos> I was a little nervous.<eos> I mean, you can be kind of intimidating, Karen.<eos> Intimidating?<eos> Yes, I can be very scary.<eos> I know.<eos> So, why were you coming to see me?<eos> Because I wasn't completely honest with you the last time I saw you.<eos> I said I didn't have any feelings left for you, and...<eos> I did.

Is Lucy... ?<eos> Lucy's in Tahoe for the week.<eos> So, agent Gordon's gonna be here in an hour, so are you cool if he just sets up camp?<eos> Yep. He can set up wherever he wants.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I was kind of hoping we could talk before he...<eos> There is nothing for us to talk about, Daniel.<eos> I just want this whole thing over.<eos> I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
And was careful every time.<eos> Not the whole time every time.<eos> If only I hadn't met you.<eos> You were fine with my history when I first told you.<eos> That was before you infected me, Ben.<eos> What?<eos> No, did you get the results?<eos> Not yet, but I have it.<eos> I know I do.<eos> Of course I do!
- Oh. - Forgot to ask what that means.<eos> [Chuckles] Surprised you waited for me.<eos> Thought you were mad.<eos> - Mad? Mad at you?<eos> - Why would I be mad at you?<eos> Uh, w-well, no... no... no reason.<eos> I just... [Chuckles] Yeah, I thought you were mad.<eos> [Sighs] Look, Harry, I know... Deep down, you still hate me.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
There are hidden Atrians trying to hurt humans.<eos> The Trags are a fringe group.<eos> Just like the Red Hawks. And like the Red Hawks, they hate race-mixing.<eos> If they thought that you and I were together, they would kill you.<eos> Just to send a message.<eos> All I wanted was to protect you from this.<eos> All of it.<eos> No. I needed to hear this.<eos> I wanted to know all this time why you kept pushing me away.<eos> Now I do.
it's just not my performance you're watching.<eos> You'll be found guilty and given the federal death penalty.<eos> I'm trying to save your life.<eos> I guess I'll have to save my own life.<eos> I don't know you.<eos> My name... is Bedelia Du Maurier.<eos> You're Hannibal Lecter's therapist.<eos> What's that like?<eos> I've heard so much about you, I feel I almost know you.<eos> - You don't.
This is a far more practical use for those limbs.<eos> Hard to have anything, isn't it, Dr. Lecter?<eos> Rare to get it, hard to keep it.<eos> A damn slippery life.<eos> You were determined to know the Chesapeake Ripper, Dr. Gideon.<eos> Now is your opportunity.<eos> You intend me to be my own last supper?<eos> Yes.<eos> How does one politely refuse a dish in circumstances such as these?<eos> One doesn't.
- You're lying.<eos> You're all lying.<eos> Will.<eos> Hannibal.<eos> You're lying to each other, and they're lying to you.<eos> Tell me what you believe is happening.<eos> What do I believe?<eos> What do you believe?<eos> Do you believe Will killed Freddie Lounds?<eos> No, I don't.
I have to prepare.<eos> Tomorrow.<eos> What is this gibberish that Vilaça came to tell me?<eos> I do not have the courage.<eos> I have to listen!<eos> Understand me, Excellency.<eos> As close to this house, I felt it was my duty...<eos> You have done well, Vilaça.<eos> If I need something, I'll call you.<eos> - What does he?
Should be ready when we get there.<eos> Great.<eos> So, what's the problem?<eos> Nothing. I just...<eos> Well, if we get the rockets to launch, will they see them from The Ark?<eos> Like the good book says, it's all about burn time and cloud cover.<eos> But I know your mom will be watching.<eos> I've never seen anyone love someone the way she loves you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I did.
I said, "this is gonna not be good.<eos> This is gonna get ugly."<eos> And so she just Kept looking at me.<eos> And then she said,<eos> Like that, you know?<eos> And she rung up The, um...<eos> Batteries or something.<eos> Well, that was a...<eos> No, that was a big victory.<eos> And i didn't...
Leverage.<eos> If you went after Tuhon, he'd have no choice but to come out of retirement for Carter and go back to being an outlaw.<eos> He's telling the truth.<eos> Yeah, but is that the whole truth?<eos> So, we got a plan?<eos> Right now, we wait.<eos> Hetty's contact is en route with keys to a safe house.<eos> It's a favor from a Russian mobster who owes her one.<eos> FBI knows you're in town.<eos> Figure Carter does, too.
Uh... it's good.<eos> It's... interesting.<eos> It's kind of challenging.<eos> How's it going in here?<eos> Oh, you know, it's my reward for being beaten and chained in a cave with my ex-fiancé.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Kens, you know when you... you really want something, and you get it, but somehow, it's... not the way that you wanted it at all?<eos> I...<eos> I want to be aa agent.<eos> I do.
Miyamoto Musashi.<eos> Who's that?<eos> What, does he got a restaurant on La Cienega or something?<eos> Enough.<eos> Hello, Miss Blye.<eos> Brunson's unstable, Hetty.<eos> If he keeps it up, I'm taking the shot.<eos> Understood.<eos> It's a bitch when things don't go according to plan.<eos> Do they ever?
Several?<eos> Such a lady.<eos> Lady is thirsty.<eos> I was thinking you're more of like a...<eos> They're quite a team, Henrietta.<eos> They're my '27 Yankees.<eos> Doesn't get any easier, does it?<eos> Sending them out each time, never knowing if they'll come back.<eos> They always come back, Owen.<eos> Until one day they don't.
They have eyes everywhere.<eos> So, what are you doing down there?<eos> Heard what happened.<eos> I was looking for him.<eos> How'd you know where to find him?<eos> A suspected gang informant got merc'd two weeks ago at that same spot.<eos> Who killed Agent Clark?<eos> I don't know for sure, but that's the Gaki Boyz style.<eos> Why would the Gaki Boyz want Agent Clark dead?<eos> They don't.
Is exactly why you're gonna be working late the rest of the week.<eos> No fish fry.<eos> Wha...<eos> It's such a shame.<eos> I think Alice really liked that guy.<eos> That brain-dead water jockey?<eos> He's basically like a roided-out version of me, and I'm not roided out, Jillian.<eos> I'm roided in.<eos> Oh, well, I don't think it was his brain she was attracted to, if you get my drift.<eos> - I don't.
Healthy, organic snacks.<eos> Interesting, because what we need is someone who will shop for what we want.<eos> Amen.<eos> Don't you know people need to be told what they want, 'cause it's actually what they need?<eos> Where'd you learn that...<eos> From your wife that has you on that diet?<eos> Damn!<eos> I don't want to be on his wife's diet.<eos> Do you?<eos> - No, I don't.
You pull that story, or I will tune you up!"<eos> But I can't, right?<eos> 'Cause she's a chick.<eos> That doesn't even make sense, man, because you wouldn't even be hitting her for, like, s-sexist, gender-based reasons.<eos> That's exactly right, 'cause if you hit a chick just 'cause she's a chick, that's wrong.<eos> But if you hit her because she's out of pocket...<eos> Isn't it more sexist not to hit a woman because she's a woman?<eos> What you're saying is more sexist...<eos> I'm saying, do you want us to hold the door for you or not?<eos> Well, you do.
You've got a loyal fellow there, Mr. Lowe.<eos> Treat him well.<eos> I must express my gratitude for your intervention.<eos> They do say the true measure of a man is how he treats someone who can do him no good.<eos> They do.<eos> However, in this case, the observation wants for accuracy, since apparently I'm in a position to do you a great deal of good.<eos> Indeed, but not for long.<eos> My lady Selima believes it would be quicker to torture from you what we need.<eos> So I understand.<eos> I, myself, do not.
All that to get what you wanted?<eos> Oh, if I'd done him myself, I might have come across as disagreeable.<eos> And those men, those assassins... you were unarmed?<eos> It had to look compelling.<eos> They could have killed you.<eos> You imagine so?<eos> Truthfully?<eos> Don't get yourself into harm's way again.<eos> What do you mean "again"?<eos> I never did it once.
Give me the damn cup. Ahh.<eos> Wipe that smile off your face.<eos> Hey, you're lucky I'm even helping you, considering the last thing you did for me was to tell Enzo to strangle me to death.<eos> Quit crying.<eos> You're still around.<eos> Yeah, more than we can say for Aaron Whitmore.<eos> Weren't he and Elena tight?<eos> Yep. Does she know Damon killed him?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Does she?
Aside from getting Damon to undo every positive decision he's ever made?<eos> Is it such an anomaly for Damon to have a friend?<eos> Well, if so, consider me honored.<eos> Ok, we're here.<eos> Where is the antidote?<eos> Who are you?<eos> I'm Sloan, and you met some of the travelers when they were taking a bucket of your blood.<eos> Oh, yeah. How could I forget?<eos> So, you have the antidote to this ripper virus, correct?<eos> We do, thanks to Enzo.
Well, Meryl Streep, I'd love to know how we're gonna act out Watergate.<eos> Well, I'm sure team Stelena will figure it out.<eos> "A," you just implied that I was on your team.<eos> Two, you just gave me that judgy little hinty voice.<eos> So what am I missing?<eos> It's probably nothing.<eos> Speak.<eos> Well, don't you think that Stefan and Elena have been a little...<eos> You know?<eos> No. Clearly I don't.
She... she said that she could bring people back.<eos> Tell me that she can bring him back!<eos> We'll bring him back.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get away from prying eyes.<eos> I got you!<eos> Looks like I've now saved you from both metaphorical darkness and actual darkness.<eos> I think you owe me a beer.<eos> You said you had a plan, Bonnie.<eos> I did.
Excuse me.<eos> Can I help you with something?<eos> Frank, I was hoping to have the whole place lit up by the time you got back.<eos> Darling?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Frank.<eos> You look like you've seen a ghost.<eos> I'm not at all sure that I haven't.<eos> When he pushed past me, he was close enough that I should have felt him brush my sleeve as he passed, but I--<eos> I didn't.
Oh, baby, I burn every day of my life.<eos> What spf do you use?<eos> 45... in the winter.<eos> And your translucent skin. Yeah.<eos> Do you have bruises everywhere?<eos> I got that from hanging up the phone.<eos> He's perfect.<eos> This is the greatest day of my entire life.<eos> I didn't even know pumpkin pounders existed.<eos> Well, we do.
O, eh, thanks, but eh... No thanks.<eos> I don't drink on the job.<eos> - Everything all right?<eos> - Yeah, it's...<eos> No, it's... it's not.<eos> - Jay. Jay, do you read?<eos> - Loud and clear, boss.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You got a visual on Carrie?<eos> Indeed I do.
Yes.<eos> When you wore the clothes that he bought you and you went to his parties...<eos> - Admit it.<eos> You always knew.<eos> - I just need to...<eos> - I didn't...<eos> - Don't lie to me.<eos> I did know.<eos> But I loved him.<eos> We both did.
- What'd I just say?<eos> - Professor Sabbith?<eos> Jacob, you don't have to call me professor anymore.<eos> It's Sloan.<eos> - Got it.<eos> - I love your blog.<eos> Well, thank you.<eos> Thank you very much.<eos> - I didn't know you read it.<eos> - God, everybody does.
What fish is it?<eos> - Striped mullet. Never tried it.<eos> Very tasty.<eos> Is this the first time they've gone missing? No.<eos> They have a reputation.<eos> - But they were always home by bedtime.<eos> - What for?<eos> A reputation.<eos> You know.<eos> No, I don't.
At the bumper cars for a while, then we went home.<eos> - What time was it?<eos> - Midnight.<eos> - I know because we had to go.<eos> - Where did you leave them?<eos> On the road.<eos> At the edge of town.<eos> - Did they have boyfriends? - No.<eos> Is it true they wanted to leave town?<eos> - Who doesn't? - I don't.
With a friend.<eos> Blonde, long hair, 16 years old?<eos> - Is that how you like them?<eos> - Motherfucker!<eos> Stop, stop, stop!<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Where were you?<eos> You already know, I was with Marina the whole time.<eos> How do you know her?<eos> I don't.
That's right.<eos> I wear a hat too.<eos> Does that make me a suspect too?<eos> I won't authorize anything until you bring me something conclusive.<eos> Now please leave.<eos> I'll call you when I hear back.<eos> You're protecting him.<eos> What?<eos> You don't know how things work around here.<eos> Yes, I do.
You may be a little out of practice, but you'll be back to 100 percent before you know it.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm ok, Mom.<eos> I just wanted to say goodnight, and I love you.<eos> And call your dad, please, he misses you.<eos> Uh, did he tell you... that Dani's moving in with him?<eos> Danni's moving in?<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> It's his life, though I still don't understand why he didn't break up with her, but that's... none of my business, right?<eos> He did.
We just... we need to go through everything one more time.<eos> But he has to have me in there too, doesn't he?<eos> He's still a minor.<eos> Isn't that the law?<eos> No, he's not under arrest.<eos> He's just talking to me.<eos> You don't legally have to be in there.<eos> But if Norman wants you in there anyway,<eos> - that's fine with me.<eos> - No, I-I don't.
- No, your, uh, friend...<eos> No, honey, no.<eos> He knows you could never do something like that.<eos> - How?<eos> - Because I told him.<eos> But he doesn't even know me.<eos> I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?
No, honey, no.<eos> He knows you could never do something like that.<eos> - How?<eos> - Because I told him.<eos> But he doesn't even know me.<eos> I told him about you.<eos> So you just told him, and... and he believed it, even though he doesn't know me?<eos> And I told you, and... and you know me better than anyone.<eos> And you didn't?<eos> - And you still don't?
- And you still don't?<eos> - That's not true.<eos> Whether or not you like Cody or if I should have been there, I was there, and I couldn't let him hurt her.<eos> I had to try to help her.<eos> Are... are you mad at me?<eos> Did... did I do something wrong?<eos> - It's not that.<eos> - Well, then what is it?<eos> - Why don't you believe me?<eos> - I do.
Okay, I'll ask.<eos> Who's Kate Argent?<eos> Uh, I'd like to know, too.<eos> Well, we were at her funeral.<eos> So, I'd like to know how she got out of a casket that was buried six feet underground.<eos> She was never in it.<eos> She was Allison's aunt.<eos> And a total sociopath.<eos> You don't have to talk about it now if you don't want to.<eos> Um, yes, he does.
I got turned off from all y'all.<eos> Maybe I'm different.<eos> You are different.<eos> You're livin' in a criminal's house, drivin' his car, drinkin' his wine.<eos> I have my own place.<eos> Above a college bar.<eos> And then there's the kid in Florida.<eos> She's fine with her mother.<eos> Yeah, but shouldn't you and her be tryin' to make it work?<eos> We did.
Ma'am, I swear to God, we all thought he was gonna just eat some shrimp, rattle off a few platitudes, go home, watch Full Meta! Jacket for the millionth time and fall asleep.<eos> Kelly, tell Mike to climb off his wife and get on the speakerphone, now.<eos> Do you know what this is?<eos> Let me explain something to you.<eos> This is POTUS trying to screw me, okay?<eos> This is the unflushable turd that is left in the can for the next person, e.g. me.<eos> The toilet's still broken, FYI.<eos> Has POTUS gone nuts?<eos> We can't have a crazy president.<eos> In Italy they do.
Let's see if you can top that, huh?<eos> Where's the rest of the batch?<eos> Huh, Benito?<eos> Storage facility in North Hollywood.<eos> It's where I cook.<eos> Please, man, It wasn't my idea, I swear.<eos> No?<eos> Then whose was it, huh?<eos> - Whose was it?<eos> - All right. No, no! Please don't.
You know what I'm saying?<eos> I ain't trying to be disrespectful at all, but... I didn't come up like you.<eos> Every day was like a war for me.<eos> And I fought that war for her, and now for my kids.<eos> And they make me want to keep fighting that war for them.<eos> Lukas is dangerous to all that.<eos> You don't have a lot of options.<eos> With everything in my fucking heart, all I know is I've got to protect this.<eos> You know how that feels?<eos> I do.
You found it.<eos> Hey, Alex.<eos> This isn't as pretty as the front.<eos> We got nothing to hide, but welcome wagon is a whole lot nicer.<eos> Alex will take you, ask you a few questions.<eos> Uh, but first, we need to see everyone's weapons.<eos> If you could just lay them down in front of you.<eos> All right.<eos> - I'm sure you understand.<eos> - Yes, I do.
You know what, Hank?<eos> You're right.<eos> You're absolutely right.<eos> I should look him up, to thank him.<eos> Because him abandoning my mom and I for Coco, best thing that ever happened to us.<eos> We bonded, like two peas in a pod.<eos> I mean, sure there was some downsides, like I was never allowed to have Cocoa Puffs in the house.<eos> But that was more than made up for by her teaching me how to shave, and how to drive, and how to hit a curveball. I mean, we were always together.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have your mom take you to a Bulls game?<eos> No, you don't.
And while that was going on, I'd come over to my toy chest.<eos> Sometimes I'd climb in.<eos> I remember, because I was... confused.<eos> I'd be playing with my toys, but I wasn't happy.<eos> And all I wanted... was to be someplace far away.<eos> When he was done...<eos> Howard would clean David up.<eos> Then he'd come over to me and just say...<eos> "Don't tell Mommy."<eos> And I never did.
It's Valentine's Day, asshole!<eos> Come join us.<eos> I found this in your trash.<eos> And this is... The guy you always talking about?<eos> Yeah, I know something about loving people who aren't smart enough to wanna be loved back.<eos> But I learned a secret that I can tell you.<eos> They don't deserve it.<eos> He's ruined this day for me forever.<eos> Nobody knows that we're not together.<eos> Yeah, but you do.
Okay, well...<eos> Meadow said this really amazing thing...<eos> Meadow?<eos> Is that a person?<eos> Yeah, she's my best friend.<eos> Was my best friend.<eos> Anyway, she said...<eos> "Brook, be a grasshopper."<eos> And it just made so much sense, you know?<eos> No, I don't.
He didn't even know how to change a diaper.<eos> How could I leave my baby with that?<eos> Hey, maybe nobody taught him.<eos> And maybe he's a dumbass.<eos> But still, I feel really bad for missing her first birthday.<eos> - Hurry up.<eos> - Can I rinse off?<eos> They used to hold an empty one for Red.<eos> - Move it!<eos> Do it in the fucking sink. - Ow!
- Yes.<eos> - I thought as much.<eos> Well, you've created quite a headache for me, young lady.<eos> Now, not only am I responsible for you but for your little spawn of the system.<eos> So do me a favor, sweetheart. From now on, keep your legs closed.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You've officially destroyed a man's life.<eos> No. You gotta tell her that if the bank is closed on Sunday... that there's no fucking late fee if you pay her Monday morning.<eos> - That shit's not right.<eos> - I did.
But he's so mean.<eos> I mean, he's really mean.<eos> He's not the man that I thought he was.<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> No, I don't hate you.<eos> Really? But it's getting clearer every second that you're totally batshit crazy. But you're a beautiful, sweet girl.<eos> Fuck this guy.<eos> So many people are gonna love you.<eos> No. No. Nobody's gonna love me.<eos> I do.
And what happens in the meantime?<eos> By remaining silent, you let this... clearly dangerous woman stay here.<eos> How long before she hurts someone else?<eos> One of your girls?<eos> You eat and I sing like a canary, huh?<eos> We abandon our principles together.<eos> You found her out by the greenhouse?<eos> What was she doing out there?<eos> I do not remember taking Lady Locksley out there.<eos> I do not!
That's it, that's it.<eos> I love that movie. Oh!<eos> You got one fucked-up perspective on the world, kid.<eos> Yeah, I hear that a lot.<eos> I guess that's why I gotta be locked up.<eos> No... that's what makes you great.<eos> Thanks, Rosa.<eos> Hey, you ever think about Jay-Z and Beyoncé fucking?<eos> 'Cause I do.<eos> Like, more than I do myself, even.
Hello, laurel.<eos> You're late.<eos> I had to circle around to make sure there wasn't a swat team Waiting for me again.<eos> That's fair.<eos> Trust me, I wouldn't have asked my father To put me in touch with you if I had any other choice.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Sebastian blood.<eos> He's about to be the new mayor of starling city.<eos> I know who he is.<eos> No, you don't.

Says the same thing.<eos> Dad... The dui, The paranoia about blood, you're looking like hell.<eos> You got a problem, laurel.<eos> No. It's addiction.<eos> No! It runs in the family.<eos> You can't pin it on sebastian blood.<eos> Daddy, please, you have to believe me!<eos> Please!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't, baby.
I just want to help you.<eos> You can't.<eos> I--I got to go.<eos> You haven't said much.<eos> Are you working on your lecture?<eos> I suppose you think I was wrong about sebastian, too, though.<eos> I think...<eos> That you have everyone fooled, Because you want people to think that none of this gets to you.<eos> And that you don't need anyone's help.<eos> I don't!
And she poisoned laurel. She took mom.<eos> To get you to come back to the league?<eos> To get me to come back to her.<eos> Oh. Nyssa, don't do this.<eos> I tried to warn you, but you wouldn't listen.<eos> I thought it would be instructive for you to know what it feels like To suddenly lose someone you love.<eos> To have them ripped from your life without warning.<eos> You do not want to hurt my mother.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
Leave everyone behind.<eos> I'd go anywhere you told me to.<eos> I had the money, Junia.<eos> I tried.<eos> I try every day to get there.<eos> But I've made some mistakes.<eos> What sort of mistakes?<eos> I took money from my employer.<eos> I invested it with a Wall Street man that said it couldn't lose.<eos> Then it did.
I should head inside now.<eos> Miss Mallon has committed no crime.<eos> She's been tried in no court and has had no due process under the law.<eos> On the word of a few crusaders, she's been shut up in quarantine in a tiny cabin on North Brother Island against her will with the sick and the dying and the diseased, of which she's none of those things.<eos> She wants her freedom.<eos> And I'm here to make certain that she gets it.<eos> Miss Mallon, would you take the stand, please?<eos> Place your hand here, please.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> - I do.
What?<eos> I don't like what it's doing to you.<eos> I don't care what you like.<eos> I need to work.<eos> I need to concentrate.<eos> So, please, just do as you're told.<eos> - John...<eos> - Now, Nurse Elkins.<eos> You see what it's doing to him?<eos> I do.
Okay, I need water.<eos> Where's a water source?<eos> Where... oh!<eos> This foul trickle will have to suffice.<eos> I have a full gatorade right here.<eos> Meanwhile, the pageant girls were quenching their thirst from another questionable source.<eos> Tessa: - Um, what's that?<eos> - It's go-go juice.<eos> Oh, you don't know about that?<eos> Everyone does it.
Tessa: - Um, what's that?<eos> - It's go-go juice.<eos> Oh, you don't know about that?<eos> Everyone does it.<eos> Gives them their pluck and sparkle.<eos> You need some?<eos> No. No.<eos> We don't need some.<eos> Alana has plenty of natural pluck and sparkle.<eos> [ Chuckles ] Does she, though?
You going to brew it or screw it?<eos> Her name is Jasmine and she likes to take it slow.<eos> Check it out.<eos> Would you look who's standing in our office?<eos> Oh, no way.<eos> I can't believe it's that guy!<eos> - You have no idea who that is, do you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yours must have been fascinating... with the Indians.<eos> They're so mysterious, so... natural.<eos> Natural?<eos> "Unnatural," I'd say.<eos> Soulless savages.<eos> I assure you, ma'am, the Indians do have souls, if any of us do.<eos> "If"? - Anne:<eos> And what about witches?<eos> Do they have souls, too?<eos> They do.
And Larry is like, "The biggest mistake we would have done is not listening to this kid."<eos> He barely is not even tall enough to even get over the podium, and it was this movable podium so it was this embarrassing thing, where once he put his screen up nobody could see his face.<eos> When you come to our website here, and you go to "Choose License". It gives you this list of options, it explains what it means, and you've got three simple questions:<eos> "Do you want to require attribution?"<eos> "Do you want to allow commercial uses of your work?"<eos> "Do you want to allow modifications of your work?"<eos> I was floored, just completely flabbergasted that these adults regarded him as an adult, and Aaron stood up there in front of a whole audience full of people, and just started talking about the platform that he'd created for Creative Commons,<eos> and they were all listening to him, just...<eos> I was sitting at the back, thinking: he's just a kid, why are they listening to him?<eos> But they did...
- ... I could order you to do some other...<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> No. Exactly.<eos> Good.<eos> I was testing you... the no-sex policy at work... and you passed, so well done, fellow employee.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sure you were.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Of course you do.
Space 4 Rent gets reasonable rent,<eos> Mr. Trawley gets his property.<eos> Quantum meruit.<eos> - Boom!<eos> Latin.<eos> - It's Latin.<eos> The only people lacking mental capacity in this courtroom are them and anyone who would consider this ridiculous argument.<eos> Whoa. Whoa, the judge is considering.<eos> Your Honor, he just called you crazy.<eos> - No. I most certainly did not.
- We we just prefer to use someone who knows Mason more intimately than just a one-hour, court-ordered evaluation.<eos> - Does this witness have a name?<eos> - Yes, Your Honor.<eos> Professor Marcel Ziff.<eos> Do you remember meeting us yesterday at the faculty event?<eos> Yes.<eos> And as I recall, you were asked to leave.<eos> Do you remember telling us that you thought Mason was insane?<eos> I never said that.<eos> And didn't you... what?
You know, w... we see it more as an experiment in probability.<eos> Coach Kotsky, don't you dare try and put lipstick on this pig.<eos> I'm confiscating that pool money when this is over.<eos> I am very disappointed that you have tarnished the good name of Richard Nixon Middle School.<eos> This is why I have to bug all of the offices.<eos> Now let's get back to the fair.<eos> Lily, when you told me about your project on the bus,<eos> I thought it sounded good.<eos> I thought you could win.<eos> - Yeah, we both did.
It was... it was just more about spending time together.<eos> Dead bodies, just a bonus.<eos> Oh, look. How was your water last night?<eos> I didn't force you to drink so much vodka or to make out with that poster of "The Most Interesting Man in the World."<eos> No, you didn't, but you did try to sabotage my evaluation.<eos> Which means you were scared I was gonna do better than you.<eos> Which means... someone thinks I'm a good teacher.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> Boom!<eos> (hushed) I do.
Sorry to interrupt.<eos> Um... Just listen.<eos> Whatever happens -- whatever happens, don't shoot.<eos> Jane?<eos> Jane, where did you come from?<eos> Mexico!<eos> In a tunnel!<eos> I had no choice but to let them dig that tunnel!<eos> You let them build a thousand-yard tunnel into your land, and yet you got nothing in return, Mr. Phelps?<eos> Of course I did.
I love you.<eos> Love you.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Oh, just wanted to apologize for leaving you out there without a ride.<eos> I understand.<eos> All in the line of duty.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I got you that thing you wanted.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> How did you...
Now he's asking for our help.<eos> Fortunately, the same jurors are impaneled for another month.<eos> And, under the pretense of a murder investigation, I will face them and determine which ones were bribed.<eos> Or intimidated.<eos> I-I can't believe you got a prosecutor to take part in the con.<eos> It's not a con.<eos> It's a sting.<eos> Sting.<eos> The prosecutor doesn't know that this is not real.<eos> The Attorney General does.
Objection.<eos> You said "murder".<eos> Thomas McAllister may have shot and strangled himself.<eos> There are no objections here, Mr. Jane, no judge, just a friendly inquiry.<eos> But I take your point.<eos> Do you recall the day of McAllister's death?<eos> I do -- big day.<eos> I had been chasing the man for eight years.<eos> Any of you know what it's like to be driven by a moral imperative?<eos> You do.
I am so sorry.<eos> Please excuse me.<eos> No problem.<eos> No problem.<eos> It's your arms.<eos> They're so sparkly.<eos> Oh, my God. You noticed my glitter lotion? Yeah.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> It's on me, too.<eos> At least somebody did.
Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> What's this about?<eos> All security told me was some guys from the FBI wanted to talk.<eos> I got a massage in 15.<eos> Oh. Well, we found something that belongs to you.<eos> Where'd you get that?<eos> Over at the Fishing Camp.<eos> You know it, don't you?<eos> Sure you do.
Yeah, we're on it.<eos> Where are these, uh, housemates?<eos> This way.<eos> Hello.<eos> Finally.<eos> We've been sitting here like two hours, dude.<eos> You guys heard of human rights?<eos> No such thing.<eos> Which one of you found Tyler's body?<eos> I did.
Relax.<eos> It's okay.<eos> We -- we can tell that you've never seen this before.<eos> Relax?<eos> You people destroyed my life.<eos> I mean, my own parents thought I was guilty.<eos> You were a legit suspect.<eos> The file says that you were stalking Greta.<eos> You were spying on her.<eos> I-I didn't.
I was in love with her.<eos> I was just a stupid kid.<eos> Why didn't you say anything about this then?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> That would have made everything all right.<eos> I mean, she was 15.<eos> I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did?
Why didn't you say anything about this then?<eos> Oh, sure.<eos> That would have made everything all right.<eos> I mean, she was 15.<eos> I was 18.<eos> You do the math.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, we talked to Christie, and she always thought you were innocent.<eos> She did?<eos> She said that?<eos> Yeah, she did.
Do you have a problem with that?<eos> Nope.<eos> No problem.<eos> I'm starving.<eos> How's the food here?<eos> Yeah, apparently, it's good.<eos> No burgers.<eos> I wish my wife were here.<eos> Women really love this kind of stuff.<eos> Yeah, they do.
- What investigation?<eos> - You can look into that.<eos> All the information is here.<eos> Are you refusing to answer?<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened in that box with Reddington?<eos> He saved my life and then threatened to kill me.<eos> What he said while doing that is none of your business.<eos> According to the report from your therapist, you feel guilty about what happened during the raid.<eos> Of course I do.
Who are you?<eos> Mikkelson.<eos> Schroeder is en route.<eos> Moment with my client?<eos> How long did they have you in here before I arrived?<eos> Where is Schroeder?<eos> He should be in here now.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> I need to know exactly what you told him.<eos> No, you don't.
What evidence did he have?<eos> I want to know everything.<eos> There's Madeline.<eos> Think she beat us to it?<eos> Stay on task.<eos> We have two minutes to access the security door.<eos> Shall we?<eos> Lizzy, I know this must be very difficult for you, but we can't both lead.<eos> How did you know about Omaha?<eos> I didn't.
Unfortunately, our POI's not on it.<eos> So you're nowhere?<eos> We're piecing it together.<eos> The good news is that Reddington's escape from federal custody has been contained, which means if Keen is willing, the task force can continue.<eos> You arrested Reddington.<eos> He escaped.<eos> Now you ask me to meet in secret, off the record, so you can tell me you're willing to work with him?<eos> You let Reddington get away.<eos> You want him on the street.<eos> I don't.
But we will, uh... find him?<eos> Whoa. A monkey holding a banana?<eos> ! So many Beanie Babies here I haven't seen before.<eos> Francine, look at this one!<eos> It's a bear in a bunny costume.<eos> What are you doing in a bunny costume, bear?<eos> I'm here with the parents, Stan and Francine Smith.<eos> Do you folks have a statement?<eos> I just want my baby to come home.<eos> Of course you do.
We have nowhere to go!<eos> Yes, we do.<eos> We're gonna drink this, and then we're gonna jump off the roof, but we're gonna be fine, because our bodies'll go limp.<eos> This is a terrible idea.<eos> Drink, drink, drink, drink, drink!<eos> This was, this was a great idea!<eos> I know, right?<eos> Ooh, grab-grab that cab.<eos> Hey, so what's the craziest thing you ever... has ever happened in this cab?<eos> So-so how many hours did...?
- Okay, I'll allow it.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> We gave it our best shot, no?<eos> I'm sorry, Rachel, is this your home?<eos> Oh, God, no, I'm sorry.<eos> - Well, this is what we're playing.<eos> - But it doesn't make any sense.<eos> Oh!<eos> It sounds like Anthony wants to forfeit.<eos> - He doesn't.
I made a promise.<eos> About Tate?<eos> To whom?<eos> I made a promise.<eos> Hope you painted the room pink.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> She's gonna be like me.<eos> Like my mother.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - No, I do.
Personal security's a tough business.<eos> We don't always make a lot of friends.<eos> That's Troy.<eos> Is that Ron? Yeah.<eos> We spent time together in Iraq.<eos> Most of my employees have some sort of military training.<eos> - And who... who's that?<eos> - Bobby Hammond.<eos> - He work here too?<eos> - He did.
Thanks.<eos> This look familiar to you?<eos> November 11th... the day Frankie was attacked.<eos> We better find out what the hell we're dealing with.<eos> Neurotoxins, enzyme inhibitors...<eos> I'm gonna call Juliette.<eos> Yeah, dealing with a 6-foot-tall scorpion, we're gonna need all the help we can get.<eos> Okay, the first candidate is from 13th-century France.<eos> It's called a Trasque... a small, solitary creature who loves the singing of maidens.<eos> Who doesn't?
Like when you said "period dramas are for people on their periods."<eos> That's awesome.<eos> I said that?<eos> It's funny.<eos> Sometimes me and Cal, we get together, and we...<eos> We watch TV on our own, and it's really nice. Yeah.<eos> Tom makes the best finger sandwiches.<eos> Oh, oh, does he?<eos> I'm so glad you like those.<eos> I really do.
I've known this was right since the moment you walked into my furniture shop.<eos> Why do you think your order was ready two weeks early?<eos> Your commitment to excellence?<eos> I couldn't wait to ask you out.<eos> It seemed the most non-stalkery way to speed things up.<eos> I do love that end table.<eos> That's a start.<eos> I do love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Neal, I... I know you're hurting, but Rumplestiltskin is gone.<eos> Maybe, maybe not, and if he's not, maybe he can get me back to Emma.<eos> Neal, it's impossible.<eos> Regina was clear... the price of our return was a complete reset... no more portals.<eos> This is our realm for good.<eos> There's no way to cross over, not without another curse.<eos> We have to move on.<eos> This is our home now.<eos> Now, I know you miss them.<eos> So do we.
Yes, how did you break the blood lock?<eos> I didn't.<eos> The door was open.<eos> No one's that powerful.<eos> Cora really never told you?<eos> Told me what?<eos> The truth about us, Regina.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> How do you know my mother?<eos> The same way you do.
- I've got it.<eos> You can't go to a sleep clinic without your teddy bear.<eos> I'll see you downstairs.<eos> "I sing the body electric."<eos> The armies of those I love engirth me, and I engirth them.<eos> They will not let me off till I go with them,<eos> "respond to them."<eos> You know what it is?<eos> You know what will happen to you if you break it?<eos> No, you don't.
But Dande Darpa Khel's about as deep in the tribal area as you can get.<eos> I'm-I'm not following you.<eos> Who's gonna risk going in to verify anything?<eos> Nobody, that's who.<eos> We're bulletproof on this.<eos> Bulletproof?<eos> Completely.<eos> Sorry.<eos> We missed the 4:00. Did you get my text?<eos> I did.
I will be blamed for the riots.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> It's because it was my video, and it's my face on it.<eos> Also, people are watching me now.<eos> No one is watching you.<eos> Who's that guy?<eos> That's a teaching fellow.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Maybe, maybe.<eos> No, but then... she gives it to Tommy and tells him to get rid of it,<eos> - which he doesn't.<eos> - Yeah, I'm thinking, Tommy panicks, decides to keep the jacket close where it won't be found, it won't be traced back to him, it's only later, when his life has turned to crap,<eos> that he decides to get his payout, at the reunion.<eos> I'm buying it, except for two things.<eos> I can't put Tommy and Melanie together at that reunion, and I can't out them together at that party 22 years ago.<eos> Ok, so the police report said something about blue paint transfer from the car to Vicky's clothing, right?<eos> Yeah, we check with DMV, neither Tommy nor Melanie had a blue car.<eos> But Melanie's aunt, Laura, did.
But today, I might. So, now, it is.<eos> And you want to know how I feel about it.<eos> You're my partner. Well, I already told you how I feel about hiring him.<eos> This doesn't change that.<eos> Good to know.<eos> Seems like something else is on your mind.<eos> He doesn't just want to work together.<eos> He wants us to keep seeing each other.<eos> And you don't want to risk the one to have the other.<eos> No, I don't.
It's Logan's show now.<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> We need to move up our timeline.<eos> Well, I'm buying shares as fast as I can.<eos> I'm talking about a tender offer.<eos> The plan is shock and awe.<eos> If we rush a tender offer, we won't have enough leverage to force people to vote with us.<eos> It's fine to have shock and awe when you're the only one in the game. But Walter Gillis knows we're coming and he got himself an ally.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> Because I do.
- No?<eos> Okay.<eos> You've done it.<eos> - I did not like it.<eos> Did not like you?<eos> No, it's not for me.<eos> Remember when I said two years ago... We had to concentrate? Us all to Swedish House Mafia<eos> I do not know whether we then used drugs.<eos> We need to focus our subsequent and our solo things have to give.<eos> Yes, you did.
I like it, too.<eos> It used to remind me of mom.<eos> Going down in that plane crash made me feel like, in the end, maybe... instead of being terrified to die, she was brave.<eos> Maybe it wasn't so bad.<eos> Now... it makes me think of you, and how you let me hate you instead of telling me about who she really was.<eos> I know that you've been replaced at B613 as command.<eos> I work for the Smithsonian.<eos> My title is chief curator.<eos> I'm just saying I know what happened.<eos> No, you don't.
Liv.<eos> Liv!<eos> You would be unworthy of that title if you were that stupid.<eos> We're working on it. Good. Fine.<eos> So, who else knows?<eos> I thought you said you were dropping this?<eos> I tried the dark side. Turns out you were right. Didn't suit me.<eos> He's brilliant and ego-maniacal and has done more to thwart the rule of law than you and I will probably ever know.<eos> And he's powerful. And he thinks he doesn't have a weakness.<eos> But he does.
Okay, then, we need to cancel it.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> I do.<eos> Candidate's flaming out. Peaked too early.<eos> Money's trickling in.<eos> And this debate could be the nail in your coffin.<eos> I've been there.<eos> If this debate happens, you are going to go to jail.<eos> I-I don't know if we sell copy paper.<eos> Because I just don't, okay?
She's not over the first-family interview. Small of her.<eos> She's licking her wounds.<eos> I have no information on that.<eos> All I know is I'm handling the White House.<eos> - I'm your...<eos> - Olivia proxy.<eos> Right.<eos> I'm calling her.<eos> She said you'd say that.<eos> - Did she?
What I know is that you are a terrorist, a traitor to your own country.<eos> Maybe.<eos> But I'd rather be a traitor than what you are, Livvie.<eos> Cleaning up those people's messes...<eos> Fixing up their lives.<eos> You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.
Maybe.<eos> But I'd rather be a traitor than what you are, Livvie.<eos> Cleaning up those people's messes...<eos> Fixing up their lives.<eos> You think you're family...<eos> But you're nothing but the help.<eos> And you don't even know it.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Oh, I do.<eos> I do.
Leo: Yeah, I was hoping, too, but there's nothing there.<eos> Jerry is Fitz's kid.<eos> Can't win 'em all.<eos> Hey.<eos> You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> No.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't know why I'm calling you.<eos> Yes, you do.
You just said you couldn't tell anyone.<eos> Right.<eos> No.<eos> It's just... It's very complicated.<eos> You trusted her.<eos> You didn't trust me.<eos> No, Gr... Grayson, listen.<eos> You have no idea how many times I tried to tell you the truth.<eos> I tried.<eos> But you didn't.
Fuck!<eos> Oh, my...<eos> That never happened.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Because it did.<eos> Yes, it did.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> You believe that story?<eos> Coming from this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
How black people are offended by chocolates.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Black people are offended by white people who come to their parties and kill their goddamn dog. Ugh!<eos> Black people are offended by everything.<eos> What the fuck you talking about, man?<eos> No, now you should be!<eos> You have every right to be!<eos> I would be, too, if I was...<eos> I wasn't thinking!<eos> I didn't...
And it's the last night anyone saw Zoe.<eos> Okay, you got blackout drunk... it happens.<eos> And it's not like you were abducted by aliens.<eos> And someone did see Zoe later:<eos> Drake.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> Why?<eos> I mean, how well do you know him?<eos> I just do.
Or you got to be able to draw the person standing there out.<eos> And you risk a thing like that, you'd better know there's something inside that's worth your while.<eos> And exactly how to get to it and to get it, all before the marshal has time...<eos> But...<eos> To come back in and close the door.<eos> Baby, I don't know what you're thinking. Doesn't matter what I'm thinking.<eos> What matters is I can't think of anyone but you... And me...<eos> Who knows where that gold's at.<eos> And such a betrayal.<eos> I didn't
Cokehead Banker is my fallback.<eos> It's like a 200% profit on a 7-figure deal, so instead of taking a bath, we all got stinking' rich.<eos> Thank you, burning man.<eos> You're welcome, homeless veteran.<eos> Seriously, man...<eos> Don't let anyone make you feel like a fallback.<eos> Sometimes I pull total 10s out of here.<eos> There's no rhyme or reason to the dating game.<eos> You are so wise.<eos> I do a lot of drugs.
Then I can't be a part of it.<eos> - It's the Galloway nonsense, isn't it?<eos> - Claire, come on.<eos> It's OK.<eos> You can say so.<eos> We're friends.<eos> - It doesn't help.<eos> - You don't actually believe--<eos> No.<eos> But enough of the country still does.
You're the one who's not accepting it.<eos> - Really? - Yeah!<eos> Trench coat, Ferrari, super-trendy hotel with a water bar?<eos> Are you having my mid-life crisis?<eos> Oh, it's just ...<eos> it's so weird, you know?<eos> I-I love going to bed early and getting up early.<eos> And ... and ... and ... and drinking at home.<eos> - And I love pyjama pants!<eos> - Who doesn't?
Will you answer that?<eos> You see, in this condition.. ...it's not good to get up immediately after sitting down.<eos> Why are you laughing?<eos> Hello, ma'am.<eos> Your three medium cheese pizzas.<eos> With large fries and two ice teas.<eos> And apple pie with ice-cream pudding.<eos> We didn't order it.<eos> Hold on. Hold on.<eos> I did.
The rest of us chowed on Corn Nuts.<eos> Ike was fancy.<eos> He only ate peanuts.<eos> Yeah, well, peanuts are natural.<eos> Who the fuck knows what they put in a Corn Nut?<eos> So the chart says that you've been in an accident.<eos> Leg fell asleep.<eos> Foot slipped off the brake.<eos> But then again, you and me... we never knew when to stop, right?<eos> - He didn't?
Hey, who wants to do something fun?<eos> - I do!
But on the positive side, I don't have to run the 5K.<eos> - What, you're not gonna run the race?<eos> - What's the point?<eos> Jules, the reason you started this was to motivate your dad.<eos> Say what you want about his coaching methods,<eos> Chick was definitely motivated.<eos> But he's too motivated.<eos> It's awful.<eos> Do you know how many towel snap marks I have on my ass?<eos> I actually do.
Well, I got to run.<eos> I'm deciding between Bali and Brazil for the honeymoon.<eos> Damn health week!<eos> My kingdom for a cruller.<eos> One veggie lovers omelet and some bacon I got on the black market.<eos> Score. Thank you. Nope.<eos> You're on the stupid diet with the rest of us, Tucker.<eos> No special privileges just 'cause the waitress wants to ask you out.<eos> Tansy and I are just...<eos> She doesn't...
Of course.<eos> Wow. I'm sorry.<eos> That ... that was awesome.<eos> It's true what the other guys say ... you are the smartest person to come through here.<eos> Is that what they say?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, Simmons is probably smarter, technically, but that's because she likes homework more than life itself.<eos> Nice to have someone to talk shop with all the time... or to just plain talk to.<eos> You know, um, I didn't like it here at the Academy at first.<eos> - You didn't?
I know.<eos> It's just... she's so... devious.<eos> Cyrus?<eos> - What?<eos> - Where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> She was right behind us.<eos> I can't believe I fell for it again.<eos> - Alice, we don't know...<eos> - Yes, we do.
Uh, did we just get Winston arrested?<eos> Or worse.<eos> Fortunately, I had time to sell out 'Arry and resurrect Despereaux one last time to clean up Winston's mess.<eos> - Maybe he meant well.<eos> - Yeah, maybe he really thought - he was doing the right thing.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, I've got an update on your Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> God, please tell me he doesn't exist.<eos> He doesn't exist.<eos> But he did.
So what about the bag of jewels we saw you with outside?<eos> Staley.<eos> My office.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Excuse me, who was that brazen fellow with the crystal blue eyes?<eos> I'm gobsmacked.<eos> That must be Wim Stuyvesant.<eos> Gee.<eos> How do you say "Suck it" in English?<eos> You just did, Shawn.
I get it, all right?<eos> I'm with you.<eos> Rachel is a boatload of crazy.<eos> But for some reason, Miles really loves her, and him, we need to keep on our side.<eos> - For what?<eos> - Everything we spoke about.<eos> Getting the Republic back, that's what you want, right?<eos> Well, trust me, we need his help to do it.<eos> You understand?<eos> Do you?
It's unbelievable.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Time flies.<eos> - Oh, I'll just, uh...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh.<eos> Donnie has the ball.<eos> - Oh!<eos> He does!
You have no rhythm.<eos> Yeah, exactly.<eos> Even my heartbeat is irregular.<eos> Oh!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Did you have to go to the bathroom?<eos> - No.<eos> I need the truth.<eos> - Oh, ooh.<eos> Yeah, I-I didn't ...
Ah, you better have a good reason for being late.<eos> Oh, I do.
Well, no, you lose because now you're not getting anything.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> The living room's clean.<eos> - Because other people cleaned it.<eos> - So? You pay Luisa to clean it.<eos> Go to your room.<eos> Oh, by the way, Luisa broke that garbage disposal.<eos> Did you know?<eos> No, you didn't.
Which is why I'm dead.<eos> And I may be gone but just remember whenever the wind whispers through the woods you got me killed.<eos> Now, you listen to me, young man.<eos> I've punched about a thousand hearts in my life.<eos> - I never, never missed.<eos> - You ever been a 3-foot tall half ling running through 2-foot high vines trying to punch a 7-foot monster?<eos> I'm gonna check the others.<eos> Check your character.<eos> Or just kind of generally take this game seriously.<eos> Your son does.
Hi, I guess we're gonna be partners.<eos> I understand there's some internet where I can make my inner thoughts public.<eos> It seems like Greendale the city and Greendale the school have some stuff to sort out, and Subway doesn't... doesn't do conflict.<eos> We do good food at good prices.<eos> We are but simple sandwich artists who want the world to eat fresh.<eos> Eat fresh!<eos> Subway, ho!<eos> Did we just save Greendale?<eos> - Did we just save Greendale?<eos> - No, no, you did not.
I'm sorry, what?<eos> There was an, uh, an accident with her garbage disposal.<eos> Her scarf got caught and... she choked to death.<eos> - Oh, my god. - And I was there.<eos> I watched it happen, Felix.<eos> I didn't do anything about it.<eos> Look, are you joking?<eos> No!<eos> No, no. I thought it was her.<eos> We all did. We...
So why don't I know what's going on in Sleepy Hollow?<eos> I have told you everything I know.<eos> You've been on my side of the table. You know I need answers, Frank.<eos> For these murders, for the beheadings, all of it.<eos> Detective Morales... Morales is not the answer.<eos> Then who the hell is?<eos> Evil.<eos> What?<eos> Did you just say "evil"?<eos> Yeah, Tom, I did.
I know me and Finn were just friends now, but he was still the embodiment of horn.<eos> I still couldn't believe I'd walked away from all that!<eos> The vagina police should come and take my bits away.<eos> Right hand.<eos> Go on.<eos> So is there anything going on between you and Liam, then?<eos> - SHE SCOFFS - No.<eos> Why?<eos> Do you think there is?<eos> - Amy Malone does.
Not even kissed him.<eos> 'I do so hate it when Kester's right.'<eos> 'But sometimes, I love it in equal measure.'<eos> We couldn't find your...<eos> 'Oh, shit.'<eos> What's she doing here?<eos> - She's come to beg me not to fight her.<eos> - Well?<eos> Did she tell you where she keeps sneaking off with Liam?<eos> No. She didn't.
They're quicker, they're easier to read.<eos> It might give the two of you something to talk about.<eos> You work all the time.<eos> [Alice] What I liked about it was how, how... How big, how wide the "scape"... of it was.<eos> Yeah the "scope" of it.<eos> The "scope".<eos> That's the word I got this morning.<eos> It's unbelievable to me that you guys never worked through that.<eos> You must have known... you must have known somebody that died from AIDS, right?<eos> Oh yeah, honey, everybody did.
I was numb.<eos> And I loved him so much.<eos> I'd do anything for him.<eos> He was my father.<eos> He told me I was just a kid. They wouldn't put me in jail... a few months max, I'd be out.<eos> He just kept on saying, "please, please, please."<eos> - Danny. - For him.<eos> For all of us, especially you.<eos> - I... - I don't understand.<eos> I didn't either.
Her water just broke.<eos> Did you nick the uterus?<eos> I might have.<eos> Can the fetus survive this?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna get you out of here in no time, man.<eos> - I'm gonna call Alex.<eos> - No.<eos> Don't, Joel.
dying inside me.<eos> And nobody's doing anything about it.<eos> I am so sorry.<eos> But we will make sure your other fetus is healthy.<eos> We will put you on antibiotics,<eos> - monitor both of you.<eos> - You know he's still alive, right?<eos> His heart is slowing down, but he's still alive.<eos> I think that he's a fighter.<eos> I do.
You stir life up.<eos> That's why people love you.<eos> is that right?<eos> Half the time I don't mean to.<eos> I'm just unlucky.<eos> It's like the wishbone, you know?<eos> Remember the wishbone?<eos> You always got the big piece.<eos> You remember that?<eos> I never did, not once.
Where's Demi?<eos> And all the crap that usually covers our flat surfaces?<eos> Demi's doing her homework, - I cleaned. - Wow.<eos> Let me get you some wine.<eos> If whatever is on your mind is that bad, then yeah, I will take that.<eos> And that.<eos> Okay, Honey, listen.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I know.<eos> You do?
Ah. What's, uh...<eos> What's the matter with you, son?<eos> You look like someone stole your cookies.<eos> No, sir, it's... It's just that, um...<eos> Are those my cookies?<eos> Anything you leave on your desk is mine.<eos> Uh, have a seat. Have a seat.<eos> I'm trying to tell Jenny that I love her.<eos> She doesn't know already?<eos> Hell, the rest of the world does.
Come on!<eos> Jack!<eos> Oh, my God, Jack!<eos> Oh, God, baby, are you OK?<eos> Oh, Mommy was so worried.<eos> I think he's all right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hadn't stopped when you did, that car might have...<eos> I don't know how he didn't see him.<eos> He did.
It's only 20 minutes ago you were down there.<eos> You know, books will be written about this.<eos> I'll write the first one of course.<eos> It'll be called The Lewis Solution.<eos> For difficult Fae.<eos> Shit.<eos> Something's happening?<eos> Something's on my nose.<eos> Get it off! You have an itch.<eos> Humans do that.
The boss is here.<eos> - To truth.<eos> - Truth!<eos> - Whoo! - Let me make some rounds.<eos> - Baby, I'll be back.<eos> - Where you going?<eos> I've got to handle some details.<eos> Don't you have people for that?<eos> It's called "customer service," Tasha.<eos> I do this part myself.
Mira. We let Maria go.<eos> Tell me who set this up, - and I'll let you go too. - I can't.<eos> I can't.<eos> Pl... please, man. Please, okay?<eos> I swear to God. I swear to God.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> We both know how this ends.<eos> Neither one of us walks out of here a happy man, huh?<eos> I don't wanna rat.<eos> I don't.
And I'm not afraid to kill you.<eos> Clean that up.<eos> I want the shit spotless, like it never fucking happened!<eos> This shit makes no sense.<eos> We had 19 drivers delivering product tonight, right?<eos> 20.<eos> Sabueso caught a bachelor party.<eos> Had to stay on to deliver.<eos> And this motherfucker here hits Cruz when he's holding the money from all the day runs?<eos> Plus we did that brick drop tonight.
That's Bennett.<eos> Chang, Triantis.<eos> I just can't help thinking whoever did this...<eos> - Was inhuman.<eos> - Was just like me.<eos> From what I can see, The Scythe is a true sociopath.<eos> Ilaria's hatchet man.<eos> And yet your father worked for the very same corporation.<eos> How do you defend that?<eos> I don't.
You call these defectors "heroes," men who've betrayed their country.<eos> Then you turn around and accuse me of the same thing.<eos> But with me, you call it "treason."<eos> So you're saying you're a hero for selling secrets to our enemy?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not saying that because I did no such thing.<eos> Would you be willing to prove that by taking a polygraph?<eos> Look, Edward, you were the one who wanted to talk to us, remember?<eos> If you cooperate, we can drop all this tough-guy stuff and just get to the bottom of what really happened.<eos> And if I don't?
You tell your prosecutor I'm done.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It does now.<eos> Sign the divorce papers, or I'll tell the world who you really are.<eos> I'm never gonna divorce you.<eos> When I was married to Jake, he beat me.<eos> And I'm gonna tell the world.<eos> I'm not afraid anymore.<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
Thank you for the cosmic fuck you.<eos> - Even my own daughter isn't a match.<eos> Anything else you wanna throw at me?<eos> How about a flesh-eating virus, huh?<eos> Wanna toss that in?<eos> What did you say?<eos> - What?<eos> -Your... daughter?<eos> - I didn't say that.<eos> -Yes, you did. No.
Yes, climb.<eos> Yo, Abbi.<eos> Hey.<eos> Got something for you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Big ol' clogged toilet in the girls' room.<eos> It's pretty bad.<eos> You'll know it when you see it.<eos> Thanks for the heads-up, Tre.<eos> No problem... just do me a favor.
Idiots.<eos> So, Brandon called, and he's being transferred.<eos> To Fort Lewis.<eos> That's in Washington... state.<eos> It's literally the furthest diagonal from here.<eos> I really like you, Derrick, but you'd be the only thing keeping me here.<eos> I can bartend anywhere.<eos> And Sam and his dad...<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Uh... yeah, you do.
Hey, who's that?<eos> Ow!<eos> Hello.<eos> Be patient, little buzzer, it's still too early.<eos> But I have to tell you about my dream.<eos> There was this big, bright round yellow thing. And all this blue.<eos> - Bees don't dream.<eos> -Why?<eos> Well...<eos> They just don't.
I did everything they said after that.<eos> And Petty Officer Coyne?<eos> Were you close?<eos> No, we worked together.<eos> They forced me to get him to the park.<eos> You were the bait.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I didn't mean to get...<eos> I mean, I never would, uh...<eos> I did...
I checked every college radio station in DC, Virginia and Maryland.<eos> Well, we still got to keep looking.<eos> So...<eos> Delilah.<eos> Not you, too.<eos> Look, I didn't have a choice.<eos> I can't go to the awards gala with her.<eos> I feel bad, okay?<eos> It just... seemed like you... didn't really want to go.<eos> I didn't.
Well, Sara's back.<eos> I have a new life in Central City, and, um, I have a wonderful job.<eos> Well, there's jobs here.<eos> More than a job.<eos> Um... I have...<eos> Someone.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You know, it's great, Mom.<eos> You deserve to be happy.<eos> - Everybody does. - Yeah.
This will all blow over, ok?<eos> Please.<eos> No.<eos> It won't, Dad.<eos> You were caught aiding and abetting the Vigilante.<eos> Working with him last year cost you your detective shield.<eos> Now, it can cost you 18 months in prison.<eos> They want his name.<eos> Do you know who the Arrow is?<eos> I don't.
Can we blast our way out?<eos> I can see why you two are made for each other.<eos> You like your explosions.<eos> Chert voz'mi.<eos> What?<eos> These are Kaiten torpedoes.<eos> Manually operated.<eos> Someone needs to steer from inside.<eos> Okay, but then, how do they get away from the explosion?<eos> They do not.
I love you.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Yes.<eos> Johnny.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Hey, Lyla.<eos> I love you.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do, actually.
Twitch, and I will open your throat.<eos> My first words to you.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> I do.<eos> I remember the exact moment.<eos> My blade against your neck.<eos> Just like my blade is against the neck of your beloved.<eos> If only I'd killed you then, everything would be different.<eos> Drop the bow, kid.<eos> Do it.
And I got to see my family again.<eos> But over the past year, I've needed to be more...<eos> And I faltered.<eos> But then I stopped you.<eos> Without killing.<eos> You helped me become a hero, Slade.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You think I won't get out of here?<eos> You think I won't kill those you care for?<eos> No, I don't.
That's really smart.<eos> How you out-foxed him.<eos> Talk about unthinkable.<eos> You and me, I mean.<eos> When you told me you loved me, you had me fooled. For a second,<eos> I...<eos> Maybe you might have meant it.<eos> What you said.<eos> You really sold it.<eos> We both did.
Walk away.<eos> Come on. Help a girl out.<eos> What did I tell you?<eos> Hey, what the hell's your problem, katonk?<eos> She asked you nicely.<eos> Go away.<eos> Back off! Now!<eos> Let him go.<eos> You heard me.<eos> Now, do it.
Now, you listen to me very carefully.<eos> In a couple of hours, this whole island's gonna be crawling with HPD, FBI and Illinois State Police, and they're all gonna be looking for your husband.<eos> And there'll be some young, gung ho, trigger-happy cops looking to make a name for themselves by bringing in a fugitive on a 20-year-old murder case.<eos> And they don't know Jack, the family man.<eos> They only know Jack, the fugitive, and they're gonna bring him in by any means necessary.<eos> Bridgette, I know this is a lot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> But I'm gonna need your help.<eos> If you know where he might be, if he's tried to contact you, you need to tell me right now.<eos> I don't.
So do whatever you got to do.<eos> Torture me like your friends did, 'cause I can't tell you something I don't know.<eos> Yeah, well, you see, torture isn't really my style.<eos> Now, Koga... you got a three-year-old son and a little girl, right?<eos> You've been through the system.<eos> You know how it works.<eos> First person to step up gets a deal, and Yamada is dead.<eos> I call that an opportunity.<eos> Look, you talk now... maybe you serve two to three years in a minimum-security prison and you get some kind of relationship with your children.<eos> But if you don't...
We want more than just to defeat Jafar.<eos> We want to bring back the Queen.<eos> So unless you can help us with that... you're of no use to us.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I can't help you with that.<eos> But she can.<eos> - Done!<eos> - Nah.<eos> I thought you didn't like to drink.<eos> I don't.
If you're really desperate to meet women and like having food eaten out of your mouth, I could set you up with my mom.<eos> Why is that funny?<eos> That's just unhygienic.<eos> It's a joke.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I believe that a joke is a brief oral narrative with a climactic humorous twist.<eos> For example, uh, Wolowitz's mother is so fat that she decided to go on a diet... or exercise, or both.<eos> See?<eos> The twist is that people don't usually change.<eos> Well, they don't.
Do you think I have what it takes to really make it as an actress?<eos> Yes. So you think I'll be on TV and in movies and win awards.<eos> Honestly?<eos> Yes, honestly.<eos> I don't.<eos> How could you say that?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I got all confused when you said "honestly".<eos> Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.
Look, do I think that you are talented and that you are beautiful?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> But isn't Los Angeles full of actresses who are just as talented, just as beautiful?<eos> All right, look... we'll come back to that.<eos> No, please.<eos> Don't stop, go on.<eos> Tell me how I'm gonna be a waitress for the rest of my life.<eos> That is not what I said.<eos> Look, I think you're really good.<eos> I truly do.
I don't know.<eos> Who profits most from the extinction of the Medici line?<eos> The Medicis have made many enemies.<eos> True.<eos> Thank God we have you, Signor.<eos> For if the assassins had succeeded, you would be the unquestioned head of the bank.<eos> Perhaps our profits would benefit.<eos> It was easy for you to blame the Duke, with his troops enforcing the embargo.<eos> I don't like your tone, Signor.<eos> You don't?
From Zita's body. You cock-sucker.<eos> I knew we couldn't trust him.<eos> No, your friends understand the value of my presence, where you are simply a dog with a bone.<eos> Zo didn't want you inserting the key prematurely.<eos> In case it activates a river of lava or... venomous snakes.<eos> So you really imagine the architects of this structure would use the same deception twice.<eos> I see.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Zo meant you no harm.<eos> None of us do.
Hey, it was worth a shot. Good seeing you again, bro.<eos> Hey, ladies!<eos> Max is single and ready to mingle!<eos> Delivering from the bitter pains of eternal death, the woman was a wicked woman, and she was dead in her own life.<eos> Yea, Lord, pity them who are dead, and give peace and happiness to the living.<eos> Hey, Fruit Brute!<eos> You don't remember me do you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - I just made an ass out of myself.<eos> - No, no, no. I... I do.
My morning face is not that bad.<eos> Sorry, I'm just having a nightmare.<eos> I mean, I was having a nightmare.<eos> - How did you sleep?<eos> - Oh, not a wink.<eos> I have all this energy, like I drank 100 Red Bulls or something.<eos> And I think like in a jiffy.<eos> Real quick.<eos> Did we...<eos> We didn't...
Olivia, you are an angel from heaven.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Must be nice having your own place.<eos> Making your own hours.<eos> Greeting customers the way you want.<eos> Eating burgers whenever you want.<eos> Yeah, I'm thinking about sub-letting the space on the other side.<eos> If you know anyone who is interested, it would make a really great spot for like a start-up.<eos> I think.<eos> I did, but...
You know what pisses me off the most?<eos> I mean, besides having a half-alien baby that might kill me... or worse, give me cankles?<eos> I really like Drake.<eos> At least, on the bright side, sex with an Atrian is pretty amazing, right?<eos> Roman and I... we never...<eos> No.<eos> Seriously?<eos> What were you guys doing in the storage closet that whole time?<eos> We just wanted to be together.<eos> We still do.
I'd rather be a loser inside with you.<eos> Wish we knew what was going on inside the Sector.<eos> Relax.<eos> Um... I need to talk to you.<eos> I'm gonna grab a drink.<eos> I'm sorry. I-I can't.<eos> I'm pregnant.<eos> I don't need anything from you.<eos> I just figured you deserve to know.<eos> And now you do.
Well, Tom gave it to me because Tom was trying to get me tipsy.<eos> I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before. It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.
I am-I have some more if anyone wants.<eos> Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before. It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.
Tremendous.<eos> You know, there's something about being jetlagged, it always makes me feel like I'm on my period, you know?<eos> No.<eos> I've been jetlagged before. It doesn't make you feel like you're on your period.<eos> Midsummer Night's Dream!<eos> Did you tell them?<eos> Tom, how do they know I'm on my period?<eos> They don't.<eos> Okay, well, they do.<eos> We do.
You know it's a good thing; what we're doing here.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> You want to go check on her?<eos> Like what we sign up for.<eos> You know?<eos> Making a difference.<eos> If I can help one person get back on the right path, then...<eos> I'm doing my job.<eos> You know what I mean? Mm-hmm.<eos> Yeah. I do, and I...
What about you, Dad?<eos> You know what was really fun about Jack's project was finding out that Pops's dad was awarded two medals in World War I.<eos> Can you believe that?<eos> You mean you never knew?<eos> He never said a word.<eos> Wonder why he kept it a secret.<eos> Because the men in this family like to brag about everyone's accomplishments but their own.<eos> Uncle Danny, didn't you get a medal for your time in Fallujah?<eos> Really, Dad?<eos> He did.
What?<eos> When?<eos> The night that I ran away.<eos> I saw him, and I tried to convince him to turn himself in.<eos> And then we fought, and... he got into a car accident.<eos> Yeah, I just... I just wish things had turned out differently.<eos> Because if you had turned him in, maybe he'd still be alive?<eos> Yeah, maybe something like that.<eos> Danny, no, you can't think like that.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
What are you talking about?<eos> You and Jo!<eos> It's not just the secrets that you guys share.<eos> (Sighs) It's been Jo all along.<eos> It's always been Jo.<eos> No.<eos> (Sighs) I've been thinking.<eos> Me too.<eos> I said a lot of things.<eos> We both did.
I can fully see your net.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Raising money for baseball camp, what does it look like I'm doing?<eos> I used to "raise money" for baseball camp in college.<eos> Hey, don't cut into my profits.<eos> Stop it!<eos> I need this.<eos> Chef Asher cancelled our date for tonight.<eos> He said he didn't think we had a real connection.<eos> - You didn't.
- I just told Jenny I love her.<eos> - You did?<eos> What did she say?<eos> Oh.<eos> She didn't say "Thank you," did she?<eos> No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.
Oh.<eos> She didn't say "Thank you," did she?<eos> No! No.<eos> No, Mr. Moyer.<eos> I'm not going to engage in any of that with you.<eos> - She said it back.<eos> - Of course she did.<eos> Now get off of my balcony before I ask you if she cried.<eos> - Did she cry?<eos> - She did.
For me? Hmm?<eos> _<eos> ... everything since '82.<eos> I need them brought to me, because I need to know...<eos> That would be great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Jeanne.<eos> Have you heard?<eos> My transfer finally came through.<eos> No, I didn't.
I've made sure that you can't get out.<eos> Dash... I'm begging you, please don't do this.<eos> I know there's still good inside of you.<eos> If that's what you need to believe... whisper it to yourself while I smash your skull in.<eos> Procumbe!<eos> Is... is that all you got?<eos> I bet you banged my brother harder than that.<eos> No matter what you think, I never slept with Killian.<eos> I loved you, Dash.<eos> - I really did.
I can't sense him.<eos> I don't... I don't feel the connection anymore.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> We did it!<eos> You saved me.<eos> You sound surprised.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're welcome, Aunt Wendy.<eos> Did you feel that?<eos> I did.
You think or you know?<eos> He knows that I don't trust him, and so he took something that belongs to me, - and he messed with it.<eos> - Okay, so give it to me.<eos> Maybe I can figure it out.<eos> - I'll do an unveiling spell.<eos> - I got rid of it.<eos> I didn't want it anywhere near me.<eos> So, the truth is he just could've found your earring.<eos> Joanna, you asked me to come out here to talk about this because you have doubts.<eos> I do.
And I did love him.<eos> Before he became corrupt.<eos> But you remained loyal to him long after he became corrupt.<eos> You could've joined us in the rebellion.<eos> You didn't.<eos> Because he fed me lies about all of you, and I believed him.<eos> I didn't know what I was doing.<eos> By the time I realized how wrong I'd been about everything, it was too late.<eos> I thought you understood.<eos> I do, I do.
Of course not.<eos> Why would it be awkward?<eos> Because we kissed and you were almost my brother-in-law?<eos> Ancient history.<eos> I think you know that's not what I'm talking about.<eos> Dash told me, Freya.<eos> About everything.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> I know you're a witch.<eos> You do?
So maybe we should try to find its mate.<eos> Kill them, and just let the Mandragora die.<eos> No.<eos> We don't kill innocents.<eos> The mate's not innocent.<eos> They're collateral damage.<eos> We'd be saving lives, and it could take weeks, tracking them down.<eos> We don't have that kind of time.<eos> Look, just... tell me where you saw the Mandragora.<eos> I didn't.
Mmm. He brings out your fire.<eos> Uh-huh. But you're keeping him at arm's length.<eos> - You're scared.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> No, it's-it's okay.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.
Uh-huh. But you're keeping him at arm's length.<eos> - You're scared.<eos> - No, I'm not.<eos> No, it's-it's okay.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> You've been hurt... a lot.<eos> Do you want to know<eos> - how this turns out?<eos> - No, she doesn't.<eos> - Yes, I do!
I'm sorry.<eos> I guess I just...<eos> "panicked."<eos> I suppose I had that coming, but you need to calm down.<eos> Why?<eos> Because we shouldn't fight?<eos> Because we're family?<eos> Because I can trust... you?<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And she's a good person, but that is not enough.<eos> I don't... love her.<eos> I don't.<eos> I think maybe I went temporarily insane or something.<eos> I think you're still insane.<eos> How are you saying this to me right now?<eos> ! - On my birthday, by the way.<eos> - I know it sounds, nuts.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I do. - Yeah.
Dr. Gardiner.<eos> Are you upset?<eos> No.<eos> Why would I be upset?<eos> Because we just time-traveled and I found out you murdered me?<eos> - It wasn't like that.<eos> - Yeah, kind of was.<eos> I had a very good reason.<eos> That's what you always say.<eos> She really did this time.
Kyle and his mom, were they tight?<eos> Sir, all incoming cadets take photos with mothers.<eos> It's an academy tradition, sir.<eos> Just chill with the "yes, sir," "no, sir" bullshit, all right?<eos> - I ain't your pops.<eos> Did you know Kyle well?<eos> No, ma'am, I can't say I did.<eos> Do you like being here?<eos> The Academy's taught me how to be disciplined, courageous, serve the greater good, to be a man.<eos> Yes, ma'am, I most certainly do.
A week if you're Madonna.<eos> Oh, here comes that guy you kissed.<eos> God, he's so much hotter than your fiancé.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Hey. What can I get you?<eos> Uh, I'll have the Gin Rickey, and the ladies will have the champagne, the billecart rosé.<eos> You don't remember me, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, of course I do! Yes!
I cannot turn this woman away.<eos> I have to take care of my child.<eos> Don't forget the axe.<eos> You are leaving then?<eos> Of course I'm leaving.<eos> Is Bjorn going with you?<eos> That's up to Bjorn.<eos> Bjorn, you have a big choice to make.<eos> I admire your mother.<eos> We all do.
My life isn't your problem to fix.<eos> Now I'm getting a lawyer.<eos> And tomorrow, I'm turning myself in, and this will all be over.<eos> I'm surprised to see you.<eos> Coming here in the middle of this media firestorm may not be the smartest thing to do, but... I need an ally.<eos> And I couldn't help but notice that you've yet to take a public stance on my guilt.<eos> I like to know all the details of a story before I tell it.<eos> Jack told you what Conrad did to his family?<eos> - How did you know?<eos> - I didn't.
He's dead.<eos> There's no proof of that.<eos> And besides... I always feel like if I light a candle for him, it's like this little lighthouse, so that he can find his way home.<eos> Lord, thank you for this breakfast.<eos> Even if it is my last.<eos> And please... please forgive me for all the lives I've taken... including the one I will take today.<eos> Hey, you're driving me to Eric's, so when Mom comes in and tells you, you remember.<eos> I totally knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Yeah, I did.

She would've been raised without any emotional attachment, so that she could be the perfect like corporate leader, totally able to make decisions based solely on strategic advantage.<eos> So Rachel's evil because mummy and daddy didn't hug her enough.<eos> I love you, too, daddy.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> Well, the psychology makes sense, Sarah.<eos> Shit. I got to go.<eos> It's me.<eos> Yeah, well, there's been a problem.<eos> Sarah Manning's gone.<eos> I did, and now, I don't.
Don't fight.<eos> Don't go anywhere.<eos> Hello, sestra.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Helena, what are you doing here? !<eos> I followed you from mother's house.<eos> I shot you!<eos> You were dead!<eos> You were dead!<eos> Yes, you did.
You're going to need more than big socks this morning.<eos> I know this has been sort of confusing, Kira.<eos> I don't blame you for being put out.<eos> But, since we're stuck in this together, there's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun.<eos> And there's no reason why we shouldn't have really awesome socks.<eos> Right?<eos> Sit, please, Paul.<eos> I'm in need of a new monitor.<eos> You have a monitor?<eos> She did.
Are you sure this is a good idea?<eos> If he's withholding promising treatment from you, yes.<eos> He's going to ruin your career, destroy your reputation as a budding lesbian.<eos> No, I think he's probably culturing it himself, so I would check these fridges.<eos> For a beaker marked "culture"?<eos> Oh, shit. Shit!<eos> Dr. Cormier.<eos> My bad.<eos> I wanted to see the original genome.<eos> No! She didn't.

Shit!<eos> Dr. Cormier.<eos> My bad.<eos> I wanted to see the original genome.<eos> No! She didn't.<eos> Aldous, you held back a stem-cell line from us.<eos> In fact, I didn't.
Your wife's a clone.<eos> See?<eos> I use the C-word, too.<eos> - Ugh. - It's okay.<eos> We'll deal with it together, okay?<eos> What's that smell?<eos> Um, no. No. Stop.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> ! What are you doing?<eos> ! Don't!
They'll do anything to keep the whole thing secret.<eos> Why say Leekie died on a plane?<eos> He didn't die on a plane.<eos> No, he died in your car.<eos> Yes. I'm sorry.<eos> But why the DYAD cover story?<eos> Maybe they think he's dead.<eos> Maybe they told him to be dead and go live in guadalupe, only he's in our freezer.<eos> I know what to do.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you, Donnie? - Mm-hmm.
What?<eos> Callie doesn't want us to be there.<eos> Too bad.<eos> You have to talk to the judge, right?<eos> So that way she can come home.<eos> Unless you don't want her anymore.<eos> Of course we want her.<eos> It is not a question of whether we want Callie.<eos> It is... it is whether she wants us.<eos> - She does.
Just...<eos> I just need to hear you admit it.<eos> So I know I'm not crazy.<eos> Yes.<eos> It's Callie.<eos> - Brandon.<eos> - What?<eos> She's just going to hurt you.<eos> You... you don't know...<eos> - I don't. - ...
Nervous?<eos> Harness that energy and focus.<eos> Focus is key.<eos> I really like you, but I love Lexi.<eos> But I really think we need to break up.<eos> If you're interested in using me as sperm donor, I'm in.<eos> If you wanna use Timothy,<eos> I think we should get together, all three of us, talk about it.<eos> The lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> - Oh, we don't.
- Everything ok?<eos> - Yeah. We're ok.<eos> - Good.<eos> So, listen, the adoption lawyer has found your father.<eos> Where?<eos> Not far from here, actually. North Park.<eos> Now the lawyer spoke to your father, and he has agreed to sign away his parental rights.<eos> That's good.<eos> But the lawyer would like to know if you two would like to see your father first.<eos> Oh, we don't.

So he is making me take this DNA test and... and sign this agreement that says that I'll never sue him.<eos> - That's crazy.<eos> - Like I want his money?<eos> Just sign the papers, and then sail off on your yacht and I promise I will never think of you ever again.<eos> - And I have to see him.<eos> - Why?<eos> 'Cause we both have to be there at the test, to make sure that nothing gets switched or whatever.<eos> I know you didn't want to know anything about him.<eos> Guess I don't have a choice.<eos> Some people do.
And it's definitely not her thing.<eos> Just think about it.<eos> We could probably use a little buttoning-up.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - We're in a car.<eos> So?<eos> So, like, our first time shouldn't be in a car.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> I don't need the whole candles and roses thing if you don't.<eos> - I don't.
- Not in front of me.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Well, thank you for that.<eos> I appreciate you looking out for him, being such a good friend.<eos> Did something happen?<eos> My dad thinks Jude is gay.<eos> That's why I can't spend the night at your house anymore.<eos> I see.<eos> - Did he say that to Jude?<eos> - No. But I did.
- How were the empanadas? - Uh, what?<eos> Your dad said he and Dani were trying out some new recipe tonight.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Uh, Dad had to work late so I didn't stay for dinner.<eos> Why didn't you stay and eat with Dani?<eos> I hope you weren't rude.<eos> We raised you better than that.<eos> - Didn't we? - I wasn't rude.<eos> I just have a lot of homework.<eos> I still do.
I mean, through Jesus.<eos> I would tell her myself, but I barely know her, so that would make me seem pretty awful.<eos> Ok, look.<eos> I love my brother.<eos> He's my twin and I would totally give him a kidney, anytime.<eos> But when it comes to girls, he can be a little all over the place.<eos> Not in a bad way.<eos> He's just not very good at expressing his true feelings.<eos> If he even knows what he's feeling.<eos> Which, most of the time, he doesn't.

It's like you're cars on a train.<eos> Well, not on a train, cars of a train.<eos> They're all... they're all in the right order and they're all just going down the track, you gotta get them into the right station. You know?<eos> Sure.<eos> Unless you pull into the wrong station, and then everything's just screwed up forever because now you're in Moscow and you wanna be in St. Petersburg, and nobody wants to be in Moscow, unless you're, like, Raskolnikov,<eos> Maybe we shouldn't talk about Crime and Punishment right now.<eos> It's a little heavy.<eos> - But not.<eos> You know?<eos> - I do.
Uh...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank Dani, she did all the cooking.<eos> Please, thank her for me.<eos> I will.<eos> Hi.<eos> Your dad is talking about having a baby with Dani.<eos> I need you to know why I'm helping Ana.<eos> - I know why.<eos> - No, you don't.
Why don't you just tell Wyatt.<eos> Because, I don't want to.<eos> And I really wish he hadn't involved you.<eos> Well, me too.<eos> But...<eos> I know how it feels to love you and not know why you're pulling away.<eos> It's a lonely place to be.<eos> And frankly, it's not OK.<eos> I really don't want to talk about this.<eos> Of course you don't.
I can't trust anything.<eos> And I knew this was gonna happen, Brandon, I knew it.<eos> Come here, come here, sit down with me.<eos> Take some breaths.<eos> OK, just take some deep breaths.<eos> No matter what, they can't make you live with them.<eos> We'll still be your family.<eos> I'm never getting adopted.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes I do.
Well, I'm not.<eos> OK?<eos> Are we done?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> I'm so stupid.<eos> I could have blown everything.<eos> But you didn't.<eos> Will anyone ever love me?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I get it, Sherlock.<eos> Lock up the scene, photograph and bag the evidence.<eos> Routine procedure.<eos> Where's the file?<eos> Case number 45344.<eos> Make sure you tag it, too.<eos> How did you get in here?<eos> I've been in here for a long time.<eos> It walked right to that evidence crate like it knew where it was going.<eos> Not like. It did.
It comes and it goes, and it works out, like, maybe 30% of the time, and even then it's... it's a lot of work.<eos> It's gut-wrenching, pride-swallowing work.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause I'm not as unlovable as I look.<eos> Somebody loved you?<eos> She said she did, anyway.<eos> And you loved her too.<eos> Thought I did, yeah.<eos> She left you though.<eos> Yes, as a matter of fact, she did.
Erika wants to see you before you start setting up. Why? Am I in trouble because of last night?<eos> Well, now that everyone knows you sing like a young Diana Ross, your boyfriend here is gonna have to write you a bunch of songs to sing.<eos> Hey, come on. You're no slouch in that department, either. Yeah, I mean, Juliette Barnes was a regular old fangirl watching you up onstage.<eos> Still not talking about it. Damn it. Last night was pretty cool, though.<eos> No, I'd say more like "awesome." I still can't believe I sang at the Bluebird.<eos> Yes, you did. You know, I was thinking... Maybe the three of us could get together and...<eos> Do this again sometime. What do you think?<eos> What, you mean like a band? - Let's do it. - Yeah.<eos> Did you sleep here? Yes...<eos> last night, I did. Sorry.
Might wanna try the one in back.<eos> Yes?<eos> Finch?<eos> Mr. Reese, where are you?<eos> And why are you calling over VoIP?<eos> You tell me.<eos> You're the one who put me here.<eos> We can't keep doing this, Finch.<eos> Put you where?<eos> Doing what?

You know what, Santana?<eos> You can find a new singing partner.<eos> Rachel, you can be my roommate, but I'm not your new best gay. Ha!<eos> And, Kurt, you might be used to this kind of drama, but I'm not.<eos> I'm over it.<eos> Blaine, come on, wait up.<eos> I can't even look at either of you... that's how grossed out I am.<eos> Please stop.<eos> We owe you an apology.<eos> Yes, yes, you do.
Bye.<eos> So, I thought you were gonna climb in through the window.<eos> I think I'm retiring my cape.<eos> Guess you're outgrowing a lot of things.<eos> No, I freaked out.<eos> And I was wrong and I'm sorry.<eos> I thought we were gonna have the perfect senior year, and the one that we got has been so weird and really hard.<eos> Yeah. And so when I tried to plan the perfect night out and it didn't go the way that... that I'd hoped, I-I flipped out.<eos> And I guess I found it shocking to find two people kissing that I never really expected to find kissing, but, really, that happens all the time around here.<eos> It does.
It's where I first gave you a blow job.<eos> I was just thinking that, yeah.<eos> We were watching Chicago Fire, and you said, "This show is so stupid."<eos> It is.<eos> Right.<eos> "Do you want a blow job?"<eos> And I...<eos> Do you remember what I said?<eos> You were just like, "Yes, please." "Yes, please."<eos> Because I did.
Marcus, you shouldn't be here.<eos> You're wrong, mom.<eos> This is exactly where I should be.<eos> You've got some balls coming here.<eos> Don't.<eos> You're standing where my wife took her last breath.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so very sorry.<eos> Tell me she didn't die for nothing.<eos> If I did...
This was an affair between two officers that got way out of hand.<eos> Preston Cruz is one of my best officers.<eos> We found the sex tape footage on Terry McCandless's computer, and Preston wasn't in it.<eos> Lee Anne is saying that these guys drugged her.<eos> She wasn't drugged.<eos> Okay, look, as city attorney, I represent this department and these officers.<eos> I got to know who sent me that drive.<eos> I'll have our I.T. Guy run it.<eos> - I'll make you a copy.<eos> - I already did.
He hates when I'm late.<eos> I'm not sharing the tip.<eos> You running out on me, or was I supposed to come back here for a little quickie?<eos> I swear to God, if you show your face here again, I'll report you, and that won't look too good for the lawsuit.<eos> Hey, I know you don't hate me.<eos> You're blushing just looking at me.<eos> I mean, you're ready.<eos> All I got to do is look at you.<eos> We had something.<eos> Yeah, we did.
Excuse me.<eos> Your father's apology, Anna's departure, both to the good.<eos> She makes me sick.<eos> You two at it again?<eos> She breaks his heart and then she just sits there blaming everyone else for what's happening.<eos> You're upset. I understand.<eos> But you've got to...<eos> I hate her!<eos> No, no, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do.
You've a choice to make, Ben.<eos> Make it now.<eos> You don't know how important this is.<eos> I wish you could understand what this means.<eos> Tell me what it means.<eos> They wouldn't be after us if this wasn't real.<eos> This is my chance to tell a story that really matters.<eos> I love you, Ben.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Of course, I do. I just...
Yes and no.<eos> I'm frustrated we don't have her.<eos> But thrilled by her strength.<eos> She's everything we hoped she would be.<eos> But...<eos> It's easy enough to suppress this footage, coordinate a cover story, get out in front of it.<eos> But we still have a leak.<eos> And that angers me.<eos> I abhor being lied to.<eos> Who doesn't?
Boy or girl, it doesn't matter. Because it will literally be the greatest child who's ever lived.<eos> You swear you have no preference?<eos> You?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Who's ready?<eos> Raise your hand.<eos> It's a boy!<eos> Both: Yes!<eos> I thought you didn't have a preference.<eos> I didn't.
- Ouch!<eos> - See?<eos> He's over it already.<eos> I'm just gonna let it go.<eos> Okay, but if you don't confront him right now, you are not allowed to obsess to me later about what went wrong, because you have a window right this minute to find out from the source.<eos> Like, what do you have to lose?<eos> Okay, what's up with you?<eos> - Hey, I didn't see you.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> Yeah, you did.
Parking garage outside my dad's office.<eos> You're the reason I dropped a grand fixing my bike.<eos> - I think you've got the wrong person.<eos> - Then I saw you again at "The Boston Post." In the elevator?<eos> Which means you're here to get the big scoop on Bruce Hendrie's cancer kid, aren't you?<eos> - I...<eos> - No, unfortunately for you... (Whispers) I never forget a face,<eos> (Normal voice) Which is surprising, I know, considering...<eos> - (Chuckles) Now I'm not a religious man...<eos> - I didn't...
Yeah, well, I realize that, Sara.<eos> Which is why I've been looking out for April, trying to make her feel safe.<eos> It's all I've been able to think about.<eos> So don't talk to me about family loyalty, okay?<eos> Especially since you're the one who's held a grudge against me for years.<eos> You wouldn't even let me come to my own brother's funeral.<eos> You know why I did that.<eos> You know what?<eos> I don't want to dwell on the past anymore.<eos> I don't.
When I was going to work, it was like my only break from all this heavy stuff.<eos> You know, our stupid competitiveness and your whole arrogant Harvard thing?<eos> I needed that to stay sane.<eos> I still do.<eos> It's not arrogance.<eos> I'm just smarter than you are.<eos> Seriously, this is the most romantic present ever.<eos> You should write into like "Cosmo" or something.<eos> I'm sure they have a whole column for stories like this.<eos> They do.
No, not just the Florida thing.<eos> I'm so sorry that you have one perfect daughter - and one who's just like... - Hey.<eos> I have two perfect daughters.<eos> - When were you gonna tell me?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I didn't even know if you and I were getting back together.<eos> Why do you think I came back here?<eos> I wanted to be here for you, like as your boyfriend.<eos> Since we were only on a break because of distance, I thought you wanted that too.<eos> I did.
You're talking to me about hospitality?<eos> I'm letting the woman stay in our home.<eos> Even though she always starts a grandma competition over who's closer to the girls, when I obviously am.<eos> I really think Lynn's gonna be on her best behavior.<eos> She won't want to add to any drama.<eos> She can't help it.<eos> Do you remember last Christmas?<eos> She turned this whole house upside down.<eos> She really thought we had bedbugs.<eos> And we didn't.
You tell him.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to interrupt.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I crossed the finish line.<eos> It's all just...<eos> Well, it's cruel.<eos> Ohh, you're out there in the john making baby batter, while in here, the doc gets the results from my very last test, and it turns out I'm the culprit.<eos> I don't even know what to say.<eos> Nobody does.
When, Bill?<eos> When, exactly, will everything be fine?<eos> How many more opportunities do you have to squander before you make this work?<eos> !<eos> You... you have a wife and a child who depend on you!<eos> Doesn't that mean anything?<eos> Y-yes.<eos> Yes, of c... of course.<eos> That's all I think about...<eos> How to do right by you, the baby.
You never told me you had a friend that had... What did you call it?<eos> Oh, precognitions.<eos> Just this morning, I was buttering my toast, thinking of nothing in particular, and all of a sudden it came to me,<eos> "Hunt down Betty DiMello."<eos> Moretti.<eos> It's Betty Moretti now.<eos> Yeah. So you guys are friends from...<eos> Acquaintances, really.<eos> - Oh, we go way back. Mmm-hmm.<eos> Same gal does our hair at Clarise's.
But in this case, people think there's a difference. Sexually speaking.<eos> True or not, I'm simply wondering if it's worth our consideration. Dr Masters' office.<eos> Yes, Mrs Kenworthy.<eos> No, that's fine.<eos> We can...<eos> All right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs Kenworthy just cancelled her appointment<eos> When does she want to reschedule?<eos> She doesn't.
Why think closed when the world is open?<eos> Why think small when the world is so big?<eos> So big.<eos> I want to plant a garden in the side yard.<eos> I love gardens.<eos> You plant beans, you get beans.<eos> Carrots become carrots.<eos> Set out to make something grow, and it does.<eos> You wanted a clinic of your own.<eos> Deep down, you probably always did.
I couldn't hurt her like that.<eos> And I couldn't hurt you.<eos> So whatever secrets you may have, they're safe.<eos> They've been safe for a long time.<eos> I don't judge you.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> What you do, what you don't do, it's not my place to judge my own son.<eos> My place is to love you.<eos> Just that.<eos> And I do.
Well, do consider it.<eos> I see you've found the last place of refuge.<eos> Oh, I quit smoking during my fertility treatments.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - But you go ahead.<eos> It may be the only fun of the night.<eos> Bill certainly has had a lot to drink tonight.<eos> I think Bill may have lost his mind.<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, too.
Absolutely not.<eos> No, this is my treat, Frank.<eos> End of discussion.<eos> Professor Tolan used to say you were the biggest pain in the ass to ever grace his lecture hall.<eos> I see some things don't change.<eos> It was great seeing you.<eos> Really.<eos> You don't think I drove six and a half hours to discuss Marilyn Monroe's nose job, do you?<eos> I don't know if you heard, but after all my years of bachelorhood debauchery, I finally settled down.<eos> I did.
And I think we should have Dr Masters field this one.<eos> Well, masturbation, for one.<eos> Can't say "masturbation".<eos> Auto-manipulation, then. Mmm-mmm.<eos> I think we want to leave out anything that suggests solo behaviour.<eos> So, Ulysses is a dildo?<eos> What did you think? Our female subjects were having intercourse with a Greek leader in the Trojan War?<eos> CBS doesn't like dildos.<eos> CBS doesn't have to use a dildo.<eos> But Dr Masters and Mrs Johnson's participants did.

Testing me?<eos> Because you do it a lot.<eos> Sometimes I can't tell if you're hoping I'll pass or fail.<eos> Why would I want you to fail?<eos> Maybe because it'd make it easier for you to chalk me up to being some silly, fly-by-night do-gooder.<eos> It's like you're hoping to discover underneath it all, I'm really just a dilettante.<eos> A militant?<eos> A dilettante.<eos> You don't know what a dilettante is?<eos> I don't.
Fantastic.<eos> Hey-hey, it's okay, it's okay.<eos> You're safe in here, Kira.<eos> This truck is made of titanium.<eos> They can't track you in here.<eos> I'd be dead if it weren't for you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Kira, you must know something about Anton.<eos> That's why they tried to kill you.<eos> I don't.
Do you mind just sending them the form so they know you're here legally?<eos> Yes, I mind.<eos> And also I may not be.<eos> To wit, maybe you could make out my checks to cash?<eos> Or bitcoin.<eos> I didn't know I was working with an illegal.<eos> The irony.<eos> Well, sometimes we do center pivot, but mainly we do lineal like you see out there.<eos> What is it your business does again?<eos> Something to do with algebra?
Declined.<eos> Great. Great.<eos> That stupid margarita machine maxed me out.<eos> So now the CEO of Pied Piper can't even afford to buy lunch.<eos> Yeah, I don't think we can use that name anymore.<eos> Dude! Dude, hey. I owe you a big apology, man.<eos> I had no idea who you were before and I read all this coverage about your company online, and I was like, "Hey, Pied Piper!<eos> I met this dude!<eos> He came into the store and told me my parking app was fucking awesome!"<eos> I did?
There's enough for bread and TP.<eos> Shoo.<eos> Get hard drugs.<eos> Make daddy proud.<eos> - You can't be serious.<eos> - I set my alarm for 6:00 AM.<eos> Excuse is the refuge of the moral coward.<eos> Dude, I got three hours of sleep.<eos> I was up all night studying for econ.<eos> So did every other jerk on morning shift.
Stay focused.<eos> You and Kelly have been separated for a year, and things happen.<eos> It happened to us.<eos> Oh, that's different.<eos> How is it different?<eos> It just is.<eos> I don't think Kelly would agree.<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> I never told her.<eos> You didn't?
Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.<eos> Patterson grilled the guys.<eos> Yeah, me, too.<eos> Everyone at TM and the hospital.<eos> I don't think they have any suspects.<eos> They don't.
I right.<eos> The ring.<eos> Just how many times do I have to tell you?<eos> What do you hope to gain by telling the Prime Minister?<eos> How can you not tell him when she's alive?<eos> It's not just anyone but Na Young Unni!<eos> The Prime Minister has to know about this.<eos> I have to tell him.<eos> Even though Ms. Park Na Young doesn't want that?<eos> - Na Young Unni doesn't?
If I could whisk you off your feet to any place on earth, where would you choose?<eos> - Terry... - In two days, I-I have a way that we might be able to escape this mess.<eos> To give you the life you deserve.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Two days.<eos> Just give me two days, and then I'll explain everything.<eos> I can't.<eos> I can't leave Arliss.<eos> You don't owe him your life, Lee Anne.<eos> You don't.
You think I want...<eos> Yeah, sex.<eos> The romantic night out, the movie, the food trucks.<eos> Food trucks means sex?<eos> No, but coming back to your place, it just feels so...<eos> I really like you, Rico, but I'm just not ready.<eos> Yeah, o... okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I mean, I don't want to have sex with you.<eos> You don't?
It's, uh, shocking, I know.<eos> But... but yes.<eos> Now can we just drop all the sex talk?<eos> You want to watch a movie?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> (Chuckles) Oh, I've seen "Star Wars" like 100 times, but every time is like the first time.<eos> (Stammers) I mean, you know what I mean.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
And Shane.<eos> And Trudy.<eos> How do you think I feel, Deb?<eos> Finding out 25 years after high school that I was your last choice.<eos> So I kissed the other guys in your band.<eos> But then you and I got together, and everyone else fell away.<eos> You weren't my last choice, Marty.<eos> You were my best choice.<eos> You won, Marty.<eos> We both did.
Old dialect of Greek.<eos> There's a possible reference to Thanatos, the Hellenic demon of death.<eos> Can you rewind it?<eos> Rewind it.<eos> Maybe we need to listen to it in reverse.<eos> Demons have been known to speak backwards.<eos> Just to up the creep factor.<eos> Isolating the audio...<eos> Let's see if this works.<eos> Indeed it does.
Watch it.<eos> Get her arm!<eos> I'm trying!<eos> - That's my mom, OK? - Hold her, hold her.<eos> Thanks for meeting me out here.<eos> I just... ..I just didn't want to talk about this in there.<eos> I can bless your mom with oils.<eos> An exorcism is really in the realm of science fiction, Sarah. I...<eos> I used to think that.<eos> - I still do maybe, but...
Shelby...<eos> And when I told you I was leaving, you pretty much showed me the door.<eos> That is not fair.<eos> You didn't fight for me, Roy.<eos> That's why I left.<eos> Not for money.<eos> Because I wanted to be with someone who thought I was worth fighting for.<eos> (Chuckles) I think you've always wanted to be with a completely different kind of woman.<eos> And I hope someday you find her, Roy.<eos> I really do.
Hey.<eos> How you doing?<eos> ...Tumblr drinking blogs there are out there?<eos> I could write a better one than these douche bags.<eos> Wait, so your mother was dating two different guys while your father was in prison.<eos> That we knew of.<eos> "Smoking a coke-laced bowl of weed is the best high ever"?<eos> Amateurs.<eos> Wasn't she afraid he'd find out?<eos> He did.
So who stole it?<eos> I give up.<eos> Who?<eos> No, not who stole it, like, guess who stole it.<eos> Who stole it like which one of you fuckers stole my money?<eos> Why do you think we stole your money?<eos> Because you knew where I hid it.<eos> - Where?<eos> - In the damn keg!<eos> Ooh. We do now.
How long?<eos> 90 days or less.<eos> All right.<eos> I suppose we'll manage.<eos> Or I could go to trial.<eos> Why would you want to do that?<eos> Why wouldn't I do that?<eos> Because you'll get convicted.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
That's his wife's job.<eos> Daniel? Margaux called.<eos> There's a crisis at work.<eos> We can't avoid each other forever.<eos> Let's talk.<eos> All right, come in.<eos> What do you want to chat about?<eos> The weather?<eos> How I slept last night?<eos> 'Cause I didn't.
And he pushes my face into the cold concrete and he whispers, "Relax, honey."<eos> Over and over and over.<eos> A-all I could do...<eos> Was focus on the pilot light underneath the water heater and wait for him to be done.<eos> The day you were delivered, they put you in my arms and you heard my voice and you looked straight in my eyes.<eos> And I felt this calm.<eos> There was nothing of Jimmy in you.<eos> You were from me and no one else.<eos> And we were happy.<eos> Then why did you, um...
There is zero point in following the law, because the whole thing is corrupt.<eos> And nothing is going to make me happier than to watch the whole stupid thing burn to the ground-- the government, the police, the feds, every shred of it.<eos> Burn, burn, burn.<eos> How's that feeling?<eos> Hmm?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Calm down.<eos> You saw that.<eos> Yes, I did.
If we are dealing with a spree killer, at least he's on a slower boil now.<eos> No new incidents reported in the past hour. The victim at the gas station wasn't just shot.<eos> The body showed signs of having been run over multiple times by a large vehicle.<eos> That is one way to put the "over" in overkill.<eos> Morgan, you and JJ go to the park where the first shooting took place.<eos> Blake, go to the gas station crime scene, and as soon as we can find Sita Patel,<eos> Reid and I will talk to her, see if she interacted with the unsub.<eos> I was walking to work.<eos> The boy grabbed my handbag, and then when I tried to hold on, he yanked hard, and I fell. Did anyone else see the attack.<eos> Many people. But they did nothing.
Do what?<eos> Ask questions and lie.<eos> Especially about him.<eos> We know what he did to you, Violet.<eos> Gina told us everything.<eos> You found her?<eos> Did you find Daisy, too?<eos> Her real name is Sheila.<eos> Sheila Woods.<eos> And, yes, we did.
All right, Garcia, you can eliminate anyone under the age of 70.<eos> And they wouldn't just need to be elderly clients.<eos> They could also be disabled in some way.<eos> Anyone he could take advantage of.<eos> Oh. 12 names, then.<eos> How many of them live near a grocery store?<eos> Define near.<eos> Uh, within a mile.<eos> Well, there are 163 grocery stores in the greater St. Louis area.<eos> Two of them do.
- You don't understand what you've done.<eos> The primordial won't work now.<eos> The virus that you created, the modifications you made...<eos> You've made it so much worse.<eos> And you could have come forward at any point.<eos> I mean, you must have known this.<eos> No, that was too late.<eos> There was zero benefit from me coming forward at that point...<eos> You killed four billion people.<eos> - I didn't...
Where's Astrid?<eos> She's dead.<eos> She told Mark and the rest of them that she was leaving with you.<eos> Mark didn't like that.<eos> She fought them, and then they, uh, came for Josh.<eos> I'm so sorry, Kenny.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I don't even know how to feel.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
I brought it here!<eos> I'm so, so sorry!<eos> - You know exactly what to do.<eos> - No, I can't fight him!<eos> He always wins!<eos> That's the problem!<eos> You can't fight him.<eos> Confrontation is standing up, looking something in the eye and being honest.<eos> - I don't know how to do that.<eos> - Yes you do.
No further questions.<eos> I'd like to call as my next witness Betsy Lewis.<eos> Mrs. Lewis, in what capacity do you work at the Charleston police department?<eos> I'm the secretary to the deputy chief of police.<eos> Have been for 27 years.<eos> So you work for Holland Knox?<eos> Yes.<eos> I used to work for his predecessor Wes Tarkington.<eos> Jamie: And when you worked for deputy chief Tarkington, did you ever see a copy of a statement of complaint submitted by my client Lee Anne Marcus?<eos> Yes, I did.
Now Roman is involved?<eos> Commissioner, this sounds like a coincidence that you are turning into a conspiracy.<eos> You felt yourself something was wrong.<eos> Did you or did you not see Steven Marcato in your building?<eos> I don't know if I did.<eos> I haven't been myself since I've been pregnant.<eos> I wouldn't trust my instincts if I were you.<eos> I trust mine, and I think there's something here.<eos> Did you know Nena Pascal was pregnant?<eos> No, you didn't.
- Rose. - Look at this.<eos> There's a hidden wall.<eos> It's a passageway.<eos> It's a secret passageway into our bedroom.<eos> I finally know what they're doing.<eos> It is an old building with old rooms.<eos> There's nothing secret about that.<eos> Don't use that tone with me.<eos> I know what they want, Guy.<eos> I finally do.
I think...<eos> I think I'd talk about it.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Oh. We have a friend.<eos> Oh.<eos> Honey...<eos> You're not gonna give up, are you?<eos> She was meant for us.<eos> You really love her.<eos> I do. I do.
Who's that? Doesn't matter who mine was.<eos> Yours will be a different person.<eos> You have to find them.<eos> You have to ask them.<eos> They'll guide you and help you realize all your dreams.<eos> 'Cause they are possible, Guy.<eos> All of them.<eos> And you deserve it, don't you?<eos> I really do.<eos> You really do.
It's temporary.<eos> Yeah, well, the problem is that I was counting on selling that book for you and me, so now this interview has suddenly become a white-knuckle, balls-in-a-vice type situation.<eos> Oh, and Ro,<eos> I wouldn't mention that picture to anybody.<eos> Why?<eos> You just... you went a little nuts last night.<eos> That's all.<eos> By the way, I like the new you.<eos> I thought you liked the old me.<eos> Well, I did.
No!<eos> Max, I got to do this.<eos> You said that we'd develop my pictures today!<eos> I get that, okay?<eos> This is a big job-- this job pays for me to develop your pictures.<eos> Okay, fine, then we will develop my pictures first like the plan that we had, and then you can do yours.<eos> All right, Max, listen.<eos> We're not developing your pictures today, okay?<eos> So great, so you're a liar!<eos> - Did you--
Your refusal compels him to use force.<eos> I'm not afraid of him.<eos> I only fear God.<eos> He's going now.<eos> He'll use force if he has to.<eos> Did you see... 33... 34... 35... 36... 37... 38... 39... 40.<eos> No signal.<eos> Mother!<eos> Do you forgive him or not?<eos> I don't.
Yes.<eos> No sound.<eos> And that's when detective Benson came out and... and she ordered you to leave?<eos> She said she was police, that you were a bad man and she will take care of it.<eos> Did she tell you that immigration would take Luisa away from you if you didn't do what she said?<eos> You don't have to worry, miss Nunez.<eos> Detective Benson is not in the court today.<eos> You can tell the jury the truth.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, she did.
Or maybe you invited me in.<eos> You were the last person that I wanted to see that night.<eos> That night, when I "broke in," were you armed when you came home?<eos> Yes.<eos> So why didn't you just pull your gun on me?<eos> I froze.<eos> An experienced detective didn't hear me come in, didn't see any signs of forced entry.<eos> She just froze.<eos> So you're telling me that you didn't invite me in, but clearly, you react differently to me than you do to hundreds of other men that you've...<eos> - No, no, I don't.
I'm really liking my photography, and people always say that they like the way that I dress, so I've been posting pictures of my outfits on this site.<eos> I know it's not a huge money-maker right now, but I do get money whenever someone clicks on a link and buys something that I wore.<eos> I'm gonna take a business class next semester, which I'm hoping will help me turn all of this into becoming a stylist.<eos> I have 1,200 followers.<eos> Most are women who want to know what to wear.<eos> Some are men who want to know what I'm wearing, but, you know, I'm trying to figure a way to block all of the pervs.<eos> So, yeah. I guess that is my plan.<eos> It's amazing.<eos> We are so proud of you.<eos> Don't even, guys.
I admire the hell out of you, Jay.<eos> I always tell Darlene, "That's a real guy."<eos> Self-made, stand-up, the kind of guy you want to be in a foxhole with.<eos> Well, I'm not all that.<eos> Well, it's not like I've been in a foxhole.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, Vincent.<eos> I'm gonna miss you, too.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too, Jay Bird.<eos> I really, really do.
The father who apparently you are in collusion with!<eos> You're both trying to cover for whoever got shot!<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> I don't believe you!<eos> I don't care!<eos> Asked and answered-- she has made her statement twice.<eos> Why are you harassing her?<eos> Because my job is to make sure that everybody is telling the truth, and she is not!<eos> You don't know that.<eos> The hell I don't!
Gotta keep that refrigerated.<eos> All right.<eos> Thanks.<eos> What were you thinking?<eos> Are you trying to lose your job?<eos> This from my fellow body snatcher?<eos> No, I was trying to save Vincent, apparently because Cat shot him.<eos> He didn't give her much of a choice.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do, and so do you.
Like what was Ted doing there in the first place?<eos> - Yeah. It's weird.<eos> - It's more than weird.<eos> Something bigger's going on here, don't you think?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Come check this out.<eos> This is surveillance from that security camera at the entrance of the roller coaster repair yard.<eos> Ted enters alone at 8:47 P.M.<eos> Did anyone enter prior to that?<eos> No. But about 15 minutes later at 9:04 P.M., someone does.
I hope that lasts.<eos> Oh, I'm sure it will.<eos> Okay, here's the dilly and the sweets.<eos> We're gonna round that down to 19 kilos even, so I'll just take back 50 grand-. Way to go, Pam.<eos> And since the coke's in the shape of a Poppin' Fresh costume and taint sweaty, I'm taking off another 50.<eos> The hell you are!<eos> Can I finish?<eos> Can I finish?<eos> Since Ramón gave his word that you people wouldn't bring any guns...<eos> Hey, we didn't, not even my underwear gun.
- You put 50 kilos of cocaine on this bus<eos> - without my permission?<eos> ! Sterling?<eos> ! - You have to press the button.<eos> - The what?<eos> - Oh, for...<eos> You dated<eos> - Burt Reynolds!<eos> - They don't have the coke, lickbag!<eos> - We do! Right here in the Trans Am! - Oh.
Okay, so how do we get Ray and<eos> - his useless legs out of here?<eos> - Well, now, I actually have some thoughts on that.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> - I think it's a<eos> - pretty good plan, y'all.<eos> - No, it isn't!<eos> We might as well slather ourselves with whatever it is<eos> - crocodiles eat, and swim down!<eos> - What do crocodiles
- Hey. But only for three days, right?<eos> And then he moves the rock and comes out of his cave stronger<eos> - than ever. - Then he shuts off the tractor beam, releasing the Jews from captivity.<eos> - What? - Hey.<eos> Wait, yes, now that sounds familiar.<eos> - It cannot possibly.<eos> - Gospel of Luke?<eos> - Hey. - Oh for... Ray, you used to be a preacher, you want to back me up here?<eos> I actually don't know.<eos> My church didn't really do the
That video?<eos> Did you know anything about it?<eos> I wasn't even aware of its existence until yesterday.<eos> I'm not talking about its existence.<eos> I'm talking about what it depicts.<eos> Alicia, if I had known what Jim Moody was up to, why would I have asked you to disqualify those ballots?<eos> You didn't ask me.<eos> Eli did.<eos> Because he didn't know anything about what Moody was up to.<eos> And neither did I.
The witness who discovered the video and tried to show the governor.<eos> There are other reasons why Peter won't waive.<eos> This guy has got it out for him.<eos> - He fired his wife...<eos> - Eli.<eos> My report is inconclusive until I have the governor's full and unconditional cooperation.<eos> You're throwing this into the laps of the Feds?<eos> No.<eos> But it might end up in the laps of the Feds because you don't trust me.<eos> He did nothing wrong.
Charlie, stay with me.<eos> Yeah, well, whatever he said, he was right.<eos> I let that guy get the drop on her. - I should have seen it coming.<eos> - There's nothing you could have done, Toby.<eos> That guy was a trained killer.<eos> Well, this guy is never gonna believe it.<eos> You know you've been photographed with known associates of Los Sangres, right?<eos> I get my picture taken with a lot of people I don't know.<eos> When did you put the money in the ceiling, JJ?<eos> I didn't...
He's loyal.<eos> - So you read who's responsible?<eos> - Alphonse Reid.<eos> - The quarterback?<eos> - That's right.<eos> He saw Alphonse in the locking room alone looking suspicious.<eos> - Well, let's go talk to him.<eos> - What about Becker?<eos> We can't tell him we're working off one of my reads.<eos> So we don't.
It's a...<eos> The "ho" is silent.<eos> See, the fact that you know that means that you're even more of a giant twit than I'd previously thought.<eos> From now on, we're just neighbors, okay?<eos> You stay out of our lives, and we'll stay out of yours.<eos> That sounds good.<eos> Hello?<eos> Who?<eos> The nomadic company?<eos> I don't even...
But setting aside the fact that all of our friends are here and that we don't speak Italian, if we stay in New York, we both get to follow our dreams.<eos> Are we really gonna go someplace where only one of us gets to do that?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Well, then how can you...?<eos> Wait-- what?<eos> We're not moving to Italy.<eos> We have a baby.<eos> It makes sense to stay here.<eos> Even I know that.<eos> You do?
Hey!<eos> Don't swear.<eos> We're gonna lose it.<eos> We're gonna lose it.<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa! - Hey.<eos> Calm down. Calm down!<eos> - Get the fuck my glasses!<eos> - Dion!<eos> Hey, hey, hey, hey! Do the breathing! Do the breathing.<eos> Do the breathing.
One of my very best friends in the whole wide world is Sasha Bingham.<eos> - I know Sasha Bingham.<eos> - I know you know Sasha Bingham.<eos> Sasha Bingham is the star of Fucking Punching.<eos> - She was, indeed.<eos> - We had some good times. E*xcept for the time when I accidentally fucked her mom.<eos> That was unfortunate.<eos> She told me about that.<eos> She also said you give really great head.<eos> - She did?
Uh, nobody can see you doing jazz hands.<eos> They know.<eos> [Laughter] Uh, what are you guys talking about?<eos> Uh, the night you were conceived.<eos> We're all... we're all grown-ups here.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I can tell this guy knows his way around the rodeo.<eos> Well, if by rodeo, you mean sex...<eos> [Chuckles] Um, uh, no, unfortunately.<eos> Uh, I don't.
Yeah, I told the chief I'd hang out and help out a little bit.<eos> Great.<eos> Hey, you got any aspirin?<eos> What? Why?<eos> Are you feeling the...<eos> It's the headache.<eos> People get them all the time.<eos> Right.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Um, I actually do in my purse.
Yeah. I'm Leslie Shay.<eos> - I, uh...<eos> - Hi. Hi.<eos> I feel terrible about all this.<eos> I don't know why he left it to me, I...<eos> My brother was going through a rough time, obviously, the last six months.<eos> He was angry at the world 'cause he was sick.<eos> [Sighs] Angry at me 'cause I didn't do enough to help.<eos> But I tried.<eos> I really did.
Mmm, no, grab me two!<eos> I want to make an ice cream sandwich sandwich.<eos> That is an awesome idea.<eos> Are you staring at me or am I just really paranoid?<eos> There's nothing to be paranoid about.<eos> She's on to us.<eos> Abort.<eos> I repeat, abort.<eos> I hate you.<eos> You don't.
Not long after I found the animal dead in the corner.<eos> Why didn't you tell any of us about your suspicions?<eos> You were already dealing with so much and then you were gone.<eos> What could I, any of us, done about it in your absence?<eos> Who would stand to gain by my death?<eos> Diane, certainly.<eos> But also Catherine.<eos> What better way to warn you of Nostradamus's visions, than by fulfilling his latest prophecy?<eos> That one among us would die?<eos> And one of us did.
I have a memory of our... hands touching.<eos> Did I do the touching or did you?<eos> Me?<eos> I just can't help but play my cards around you, for some reason.<eos> Listen...<eos> There's some things I got to do.<eos> Don't you give me the "soldier going off to war" speech.<eos> I seen that look as soon as you walked in... the killer look.<eos> The Yukon got you.<eos> Didn't it, Haskell?
The point person is an Air Force general,<eos> Robert Lansdale, out of Nellis.<eos> Nellis.<eos> That would help explain all the trips to Vegas.<eos> Yeah, and why his accident may not have been an accident.<eos> I know John had a gift for telling a good tale. Seducing his listener.<eos> But the truth is, his story was going nowhere.<eos> He was frustrated.<eos> So you think it was an accident?<eos> I do.
Where the fuck you going?<eos> Cops saying they're gonna shut down Truth unless they speak to me face to face.<eos> You're gonna have to run this meeting solo, Bro.<eos> Are you fucking with me?<eos> We're getting hit, you shut shit down.<eos> Now we got an entire network meeting and you're gonna go deal with some bullshit at the club?<eos> They're shutting the club down, Tommy!<eos> We wash more money up in there than we do at every other front we got combined.<eos> You want me to just fuck this off?<eos> - Hell, yeah, I do.
- That's not what she's doing.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> No, no, no. She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because. Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.
- Of course it is.<eos> No, no, no. She's trying to help me.<eos> She's trying to seduce you.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Norman.<eos> Norman.<eos> Then why didn't she close the door?<eos> Because. Because she knows you're watching her.<eos> - She does not.<eos> - Of course she does.
And the people being protected need to realize that being safe can cost you something.<eos> But it beats the hell out of the alternative.<eos> I assume we're not here to take in a matinee.<eos> This is for your ears only.<eos> Five months ago an Islamist terror cell-- same one responsible for the bombing in London the other day-- had plans to do some damage here.<eos> What happened?<eos> On a tip, we located the bomb components in a locker at Penn Station.<eos> That tip was provided by one of my officers in the International Liaison Program.<eos> FBI didn't have the intel, or Interpol, or the CIA.<eos> Only we did.
Hey, Joseph, thanks for coming down.<eos> I heard you found Jenna Wallace.<eos> Uh, yeah, thanks to you.<eos> I'm happy for them.<eos> They're grateful to you for all you did.<eos> There's someone else who wants to thank you, too, right over there.<eos> Daddy?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Allie.<eos> Did they...?
Your whole department.<eos> That's not the issue.<eos> The issue is his name is on my desk because his old man is a drinking buddy of yours.<eos> And so what the hell is so bad about that?<eos> I don't work that way!<eos> Well, maybe you ought to.<eos> Pop, I'm not going back to the last century where the top spots went to the guys with hooks.<eos> Nobody's asking you to.<eos> And by the way, it worked just fine.<eos> No, Pop... it didn't.
I love being a cop, sir.<eos> And, sure, I've got some goals.<eos> Some pretty lofty ones, in fact.<eos> One day hoping it's me sitting in this office.<eos> But I've got a long way to go, and I'm enjoying the good work that's gonna get me there.<eos> Thanks for coming by, Officer.<eos> Thank you, sir.<eos> I'm sorry. We both know you're dreaming.<eos> I don't think the judge will agree with you.<eos> I do, and....
Thank you.<eos> This was delicious.<eos> Yeah, I remember how much you loved this restaurant.<eos> I do.<eos> But we used to only come here when it was a special occasions.<eos> Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right. The Nicky question.<eos> Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?
This was delicious.<eos> Yeah, I remember how much you loved this restaurant.<eos> I do.<eos> But we used to only come here when it was a special occasions.<eos> Well, I was hoping that... tonight could maybe be one of those.<eos> Right. The Nicky question.<eos> Uh-huh. You really think we should be telling her about... whatever it is we've been doing?<eos> Only if we want to keep doing it.<eos> And you do?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Glad I could help.<eos> Time to go.<eos> Guess it's too late to give you my real number.<eos> Concentrate on not getting a prison number.<eos> It was cute while it lasted.<eos> You're still here? Tour ended hours ago.<eos> I wanted to watch you march Warner in.<eos> That didn't happen.<eos> Maya jerk you around again?<eos> No, nothing to do with her.
(chuckles) Yeah.<eos> That's only 'cause I got burned on the last miracle implant.<eos> (drawer clatters) How about a drink?<eos> Um... (sighs) I really have to take this to pathology.<eos> Actually, that's going with me.<eos> What do you mean, it's going with you? You know the terms of our clinical trial...<eos> Any implant removed from participants becomes the sole property of Sabian Medical Devices.<eos> What, is that the only reason that you wanted to conduct the autopsy... just to get your prosthesis?<eos> (sighs) If there is a design flaw here, I want to know about it, and I want to get it fixed.<eos> - Yeah, we all do.
I knew it.<eos> Sex club.<eos> - I'll wear my crotchless teddy.<eos> - Uh, cocktail attire.<eos> Wear something warm in case we want to hang outside.<eos> Ah, I've never been to an outdoor sex club.<eos> Oh, yeah, you know what?<eos> Speaking of romantic, intimate getaways-- my mom.<eos> She wanted us to come grill tonight.<eos> - She did? - Mm-hmm.
Hey, I pay 30 at the Thai place, and they wash towels too.<eos> Damn Thai sex workers, stealing jobs from decent Americans.<eos> Our girls are Russian.<eos> They eat with forks, not with sticks, right?<eos> Baby, you hit up everyone who's come in here, all three of 'em.<eos> What if we advertise?<eos> Put an ad in Craigslist or one of those free local business things?<eos> Hey, yeah, we can get some meth heads to hand out flyers and shit.<eos> - And pay them how?<eos> - We don't.
Get used to it.<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Up top.<eos> A lot can happen in one night.<eos> Sometimes you meet someone great.<eos> Sometimes you get your heart broken.<eos> Sometimes nothing changes at all.<eos> But sometimes...<eos> Just sometimes...<eos> Everything does.
Now my legs really hurt.<eos> It's like I have a tension headache, but in my calves.<eos> A new surprise every day.<eos> That sucks.<eos> I know.<eos> And I'm so gassy.<eos> There's just been, like, a long, slow fart stream coming out of me since we started talking... this morning.<eos> That really sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> It does. Thanks.
_<eos> _<eos> You never told me that.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Yo, Sharee.<eos> Is that your mom?<eos> Mom, what are you doing here?<eos> You know damn well why I'm here.<eos> - No, I don't.
My pagoda project!<eos> I didn't finish!<eos> Pagoda!<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> This won't take but a sec.<eos> Here, Dotty. Hold that till it dries.<eos> Rough morning.<eos> Won't happen again.<eos> But it did.
Face it-- you don't have a leg to stand on.<eos> Oh, I got legs-- two of them, just like Axl-- that might have been perfect for ice skating, only we'll never know 'cause you took Sue to ice capades.<eos> Hey, I still do stuff with Axl.<eos> When is the last time you did anything like that with Sue?<eos> Hey, I spend time with Sue.<eos> I watched her play volleyball, Frankie.<eos> Got her checked out at the emergency room.<eos> I'm just saying, you don't know where she works.<eos> You have no idea what J-P-la is.<eos> Nobody does.
About what?<eos> You'll have to ask him.<eos> The principal will be with you in just a moment.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Castle, none of this adds up.<eos> What were those girls so afraid of?<eos> What happened in that cafeteria?<eos> I'd offer a theory, but I'm too busy having detention flashbacks.<eos> You must've spent a lot of time in this hallway.<eos> More than I did in class.
But she's gone now.<eos> You're lying.<eos> And if you don't tell me the truth,<eos> I will arrest you for obstruction<eos> - and harboring a fugitive...<eos> - Stop.<eos> Leave him alone.<eos> He's just trying to protect me.<eos> She even kind of looks like Carrie.<eos> No, she does not!
We're gonna have to kick her loose.<eos> Waitress confirmed that Jordan was at the café in Queens till 11:00.<eos> So she couldn't have killed Madison.<eos> Not with her bare hands, but who knows how far her secret telekinetic powers might reach?<eos> Well, it turns out our victim might've had some secrets of her own.<eos> Did you track down whoever Madison was seeing?<eos> As far as I can tell, she wasn't seeing anybody.<eos> But these are her financials.<eos> - What kind of high-school kid has financials?<eos> - Madison does.
It's all my fault.<eos> I never meant for any of this to happen.<eos> I never meant for anyone to get hurt.<eos> So, what we saw at your house, that event at the cafeteria...<eos> that was you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You must think I'm a freak, huh?<eos> Uh... how did you do it?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Most people don't.
Love to, but I, um, better get back to the station.<eos> Right. Well, if anything comes up worth reporting, you'll be the first one that I call.<eos> I hope you don't wait that long to call me.<eos> Good morning.<eos> It is now.<eos> I keep thinking about the other night.<eos> It just felt so good to connect with you again.<eos> Arliss, baby...<eos> There's something you gotta know.<eos> Don't.
Jacoby wanted to do wind sprints outside.<eos> You know, he's a mean dude, but I think I'm making progress.<eos> He asked to borrow my squat belt, I told him no,<eos> Okay, but let's build up that relationship slowly, okay?<eos> We don't want to jump the gun and spook him.<eos> (brandon) whew! 'sup?<eos> Good workout.<eos> You know, it's weird I never worked out with you before.<eos> What'd you say your regular gym was?<eos> I didn't.
I will say she makes a wonderful rye.<eos> So dense, yet so moist.<eos> Hello, ladies.<eos> Since you have allowed crime to win,<eos> I've hired a private investigator to solve my case.<eos> Say hello to leo sporm.<eos> A p.I.?<eos> These guys are hacks.<eos> How do you know if your husband's a murderer?<eos> You don't.
He's the king dirtbag.<eos> Hi, daddy.<eos> I made goalie.<eos> There were six girls trying out, and they only picked two.<eos> And I got it!<eos> Daddy, Julia took my scrapbook.<eos> I didn't take it.<eos> She lost it.<eos> - Yes you did!<eos> - No I didn't.
What?<eos> He made the whole story up.<eos> So you wouldn't have to go through what I went through when Justin died.<eos> He lied about the whole thing.<eos> Okay?<eos> He was trying to protect you.<eos> Tell me everything right now.<eos> I don't know everything.<eos> Just that he made it up, or he let you believe it.<eos> So he and Aida didn't...
I know what she did...<eos> The night of the accident.<eos> I know about the pills.<eos> How?<eos> This place. It showed me.<eos> That's why you were driving so fast.<eos> You were trying to get her to the hospital. So they could pump her stomach.<eos> I didn't want you and Scott to know.<eos> I didn't want you to ever know.<eos> No, of course you didn't.
Oh, that's right.<eos> It's a house of horrors.<eos> And one of my worst memories, thanks to you.<eos> I told you not to take that job in the first place.<eos> Well, that was a good score.<eos> With a bad mark.<eos> You only went after that guy 'cause big jim kicked dad out of houston.<eos> You made it personal, and that's why you blew it.<eos> No, I blew it because I didn't have the right boxman with me.<eos> Well, now you do.
I think I may know where you can find that girl that you're looking for.<eos> Kat something or other?<eos> Did Kyle say something about her?<eos> No, but she apparently was in his room last night.<eos> That's strictly against school rules.<eos> And Kyle knows that. I'm disappointed in him.<eos> I am doing everything that I can to help you, Detective.<eos> As I told you that I would.<eos> Did you see the girl?<eos> One of my boys did.
Hey.<eos> What is going on?<eos> You're not my social worker anymore. Stay out of my life.<eos> Get your backpack, please, Jack.<eos> You don't have the slightest idea what I'm dealing with.<eos> Every time I've ever opened the door, the only thing I've gotten back from you is that disappointed, shitty look of yours.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You have never known me.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> No one does.
Lots of things would make me happy.<eos> Everybody deserves a little happy.<eos> I want you to have it.<eos> Hey, Teej, what's going on?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Yeah, great.<eos> Well, why did I come all the way out here to meet you?<eos> Did you know that dad was in love with a woman before he met mom?<eos> Um...<eos> No, I didn't.
Did, um...<eos> Was it here in town?<eos> Um, do you know that bar where Atlantic sort of hits Auburn?<eos> Yeah. Kennett's.<eos> I was in there one night, and, um... was hanging out with these seals, these...<eos> They were all on leave.<eos> And then this one guy... and he took me to one of those motels like you took me to.<eos> I'm so sorry. No, no, no.<eos> That's not...<eos> I didn't...
Is it okay if I get them?<eos> Your name?<eos> Charles duluth.<eos> Peter emery? That's right.<eos> I'll need to see some identification.<eos> All right, I'll hang onto this till you return the key. No problem.<eos> Thank you, raymond.<eos> You're welcome, sir.<eos> The lab's not empty. It's supposed to be empty. Okay, calm down.<eos> What do we do?
I thought I heard something.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I want to see the seat of power.<eos> Does that turn you on?<eos> Mm, I want to rub my tetas all over the congressman's desk.<eos> Are you going to open this door, Carl, or don't you have a key?<eos> Of course I have the key, but we c... or maybe you don't have the cajones then?<eos> Maybe you should check.<eos> I thought you wanted to, uh...<eos> I do.
They're back!<eos> Hey, we heard an explosion.<eos> What happened?<eos> Murphy happened.<eos> Thank God!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> Where's Monty?<eos> - Monty's gone?<eos> - Clarke, we need to leave, now.<eos> All of us do.
In the game of Go, it's what we call a truly inspired, or out-of-the-box move.<eos> The Nogitsune has had sente, the advantage, until this point.<eos> What you need is a divine move in order to turn the game around.<eos> Okay, so is anyone feeling divinely inspired?<eos> Mom, you said you trapped it in a glass jar, right?<eos> It wasn't the jar that trapped it.<eos> It was where I buried it.<eos> The Nemeton.<eos> A place I don't know too much about.<eos> Who does?

We can...we can talk any time.<eos> About Felicity?<eos> And your son.<eos> (Sighs) It's not like you think.<eos> What do I think?<eos> Sometimes it's better to...to put things in a box.<eos> I married a paranoid schizophrenic.<eos> And she caused a lot of trouble, as er...as delusional people will.<eos> She had a serious drink problem too and...<eos> I didn't...
She had a serious drink problem too and...<eos> I didn't...<eos> I didn't handle it very well.<eos> I ran away.<eos> I tried to fight for custody for my son, but um... ..they wouldn't even allow me back into the country.<eos> Please forgive me, Munchkin.<eos> How did you er...find out?<eos> The police told me.<eos> Er...you've been talking to the police behind my back?<eos> They did the talking, Malcolm. Oh.
Now I'm gonna miss another deadline that I promised I'd make.<eos> Well, maybe the stakes are a little bit higher in my world, okay?<eos> I'm not just QA-ing calculators.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - I didn't...<eos> Gordon, let me ask you something.<eos> When is the last time you cut their toenails?<eos> Or which one of your daughters is allergic to apricots?<eos> Do you even know their pediatrician's name?<eos> No, you don't?
Fuck me.<eos> No unauthorized personnel...<eos> Yeah, these...<eos> Do you have any idea what this is about?<eos> No.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Hey.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Do you mind telling me what the fuck is going on?<eos> Actually, yeah, I do.
I hear you're trying to make the precinct more efficient.<eos> Gina, what are you doing in the captain's chair?<eos> Please, I'm open to any ideas about efficiency.<eos> I've narrowed the problem down to one location:<eos> The holt-jeffords vortex.<eos> Things would go a lot faster if the two of you Did less experimenting and more working.<eos> And I'm not the only one who thinks that.<eos> You melted my fringe.<eos> You think I have an anger problem?<eos> I don't.
- Hey. - Hey. - What was that?<eos> Nothing...<eos> uh...<eos> I mean, it's... Agent jinks, it's your go, I believe.<eos> - Oh, yeah. Can I maybe go later, or you know, not at all?<eos> Oh, come on. Don't go all pete on me.<eos> We each have to do this.<eos> - No, I'm not, it's just...<eos> What if I don't have a defining warehouse moment?<eos> Of course you do, pookie.
Proposals usually end in "will you marry me?"<eos> If I'd understood, I never would have said...<eos> Well, great. Naomi's walking out on Jimmy, and now you're walking out on me.<eos> - It's freakin' kismet.<eos> - Listen to me!<eos> I'm not walking out on you.<eos> But we can't get married just because you're screwed up about your dad.<eos> Don't use him as an excuse for cold feet.<eos> If you don't want to get married, just say so.<eos> I don't!
It's useless.<eos> Up till now, I still can't figure out... where they hide the 300 missing workers.<eos> 300!<eos> It is North Evil's business.<eos> Lui didn't let me get involved.<eos> North Evil... is starting to suspect me.<eos> I have to move fast... to quickly rescue them.<eos> Why not find a chance to kill Lui directly?<eos> No.<eos> If we do,
Is he daed?<eos> Was he hit?<eos> He's dead, chief.<eos> Stop following me.<eos> Just let me explain...<eos> No need.<eos> Hear me out.<eos> Don't be like this.<eos> I don't want your explanations!<eos> Don't do this.
I'm changing.<eos> We'll go to my store, and we'll find you something awesome.<eos> Hey, guys. I'm gonna use the restroom.<eos> I'll see you later.<eos> - Okay?<eos> Bye. - Bye.<eos> See you.<eos> - Um, I'd like to buy this, please.<eos> - Sure. Also, do you have it in a seven?<eos> - We do.
She will not rest.<eos> She will not stop.<eos> And I will not know peace.<eos> So we take her out of the equation.<eos> Eliminate the threat.<eos> The graves of Asgard's enemies are littered with men who underestimated Sif.<eos> Do not make the same mistake.<eos> You do not know her.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
What about his wife?<eos> Ms. Sonia is awake.<eos> Want to see her?<eos> That would be great.<eos> - Excuse me, thanks.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Rita.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> Noemia, did you know that Severino was suing us?<eos> No, I didn't.
Don't touch me and watch your mouth.<eos> - You piece of shit.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - You piece of shit! - Jean, don't do that.<eos> Oh my God, stop this.<eos> Let go of me!<eos> - Let go of me, you madman.<eos> - You punk. - Stop it!<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> We don't do this in this house!
I got a key back here somewhere.<eos> Think twice before you do that, Zoe.<eos> - I know things about you.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> You know what I'm doing here.<eos> You should've came with us.<eos> It's a little late for that, I think.<eos> But it's not too late for Bo.<eos> I know you care about her.<eos> Okay, we all do.
Um, let me think.<eos> Sounds pretty cool, actually.<eos> Well, yeah, if you're into that drama geek shit.<eos> Honey, I'll be right back.<eos> Hmm? Hmm?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'll drive you, you can Uber back.<eos> I didn't even say we were going.<eos> Yeah, I know you didn't.<eos> I did. Huh?
You need to listen to me very carefully.<eos> There is a place for people like us where you'll be safe.<eos> Off the streets, and away from Ultra.<eos> So you've heard of them.<eos> Good.<eos> How do I know I can trust you?<eos> What's up?<eos> Um, what's up is you haven't been in school in a week.<eos> Told you, I'm sick.<eos> You did.
For starters, a bed-and-breakfast forces you to eat with strangers at your table.<eos> One step ahead of you--<eos> Bernadette and Wolowitz are going with us.<eos> Oh, very well.<eos> What are the sleeping arrangements?<eos> We've only been dating for three years.<eos> If we were to share a room, people might talk.<eos> I got you your own room.<eos> What if my room has a claw-foot bathtub?<eos> It doesn't.
If she needs new organs, I'll buy any dog necessary and scrap them for parts!<eos> You're the owner?<eos> Owner, father, soul mate, and if anything happens to her, your worst nightmare!<eos> Well, she's not throwing up, which is a good sign.<eos> So, I'm gonna take her in back, put her on fluids and give her something to absorb the toxins.<eos> Okay? Okay.<eos> Okay, thank you.<eos> Oh, if she's scared, you can sing to her.<eos> She likes Katy Perry.<eos> Oh, but don't do "Firework""
So now...<eos> We're in a real fight.<eos> I'm gonna go to bed.<eos> These are yours.<eos> Good night.<eos> Warner...<eos> Warner, will you stop wiggling?<eos> That's just what your mother used to do, up all night with her stomach pills and her heart pills.<eos> She had a cute angina.<eos> Yeah, she sure did.
No, he's not.<eos> What did you do?<eos> I don't know about you, but this is very exciting.<eos> You're gonna do well.<eos> You're gonna do well.<eos> May I say goodbye first?<eos> Indeed.<eos> You ready, brother?<eos> If you think it's for the best.<eos> I do.
He made me a Handler.<eos> Your handler.<eos> The party?<eos> The bartender?<eos> A setup.<eos> He wanted to make sure you played.<eos> But what happened between us, that was real.<eos> Oh, shut the fuck up.<eos> If you don't wanna believe me, that's fine.<eos> I don't.
- Looks real.<eos> Need it to if we're gonna get the guy behind the counter to give us all the money in the register. Don't have to.<eos> I can do it alone.<eos> No, I can do it.<eos> Sure you're ready to pop your armed robbery cherry?<eos> Yeah, I've done it lots of times before.<eos> You're cute.<eos> Black or camo?<eos> Did you not get your last check?<eos> No, I did.
You're not the only one.<eos> I'm just saying, your feelings for Cat aside, this is just as much about Tori as you.<eos> Fight it all you want, but the truth is you share a unique connection with her.<eos> A primal connection.<eos> You may be the only two beasts left on the planet.<eos> Relax.<eos> She's fine.<eos> She could've died, Tess.<eos> On my watch.<eos> But she didn't.
Who is it?<eos> Who is your master?<eos> You traitor!<eos> Is he not the king!<eos> How dare you! Betray His Majesty!<eos> Since he was a young prince, servants tried to kill him.<eos> They poisoned his food and carried knives. I've heard of over 12 attempts at his life.<eos> Still!<eos> You! He trusted only you!<eos> I did, too.
It was going to be 15, but then this one guy described himself as "Jackson Pollock-esque"<eos> and I told him that's finger painting for adults and I hate it!<eos> The Pawnee-Eagleton merger has made for a rough year, both for me and for the town.<eos> But if I can pull off this unity concert and prove that this merger was a success,<eos> Pawnee might once again tolerate-slash-ignore me.<eos> I know that sounds bad, but for a politician it's pretty much the best-case scenario.<eos> Well, you guys might as well be a pile of leaves because you're about to get blown away.<eos> I have booked a meeting with none other than Grant Larson.<eos> - No one knows who that is?<eos> - Um, I do.
I'm serious.<eos> I don't like you living at that huge ranch by yourself.<eos> I wish you lived in the neighborhood, somewhere close, that I could come visit you every day.<eos> Well, I suppose it would be nice not to have to keep up with all the work out on the ranch.<eos> And if I was closer, I could come by whenever I want, drink your beer and play slap-a-dope.<eos> What's "slap-a-dope"?<eos> Ohh!<eos> You still got it.<eos> [ Laughs ] I can't believe the dope fell for it.<eos> - Job well done.
Yeah, he is a character.<eos> No, he's annoying!<eos> And why does he always have to use our bathroom?<eos> 'Cause he says the softer seat helps him with the strain of his--<eos> Stop!<eos> Stop. I don't-<eos> - Ugh.<eos> I don't understand why you're so upset.<eos> I mean, yes, my dad can be a handful, but you still wanted him to move in with us.<eos> No! I didn't!
Well, whenever we're in a fight and you don't know who screwed up more, you come here, you get a dozen cupcakes, and you decide whether you should give them to me and apologize or you should eat them yourself because you're so upset.<eos> [ Sighs ] I was so conflicted.<eos> [ Chuckles ] I'm gonna have to do so many crunches.<eos> Jules, I'm really sorry I blew up at you.<eos> No, honey. This is my fault.<eos> I should have talked to you more before asking dad to move in with us.<eos> I just-- I got so excited at the fact that you said it was an option that I started to really believe that's what you wanted.<eos> I was being selfish.<eos> I do want him to move in with us.<eos> No, you don't.
I've got nothing else to say to you.<eos> Well, we'd love to talk to you...about your movements after the viewing.<eos> Told you.<eos> I went home.<eos> You might want to rethink that answer.<eos> What can I say? I thought my role as husband was to provide... ..give my wife everything her heart desired.<eos> It turns out that what she desired was some jumped-up gigolo.<eos> Do you know they were actually planning to run away together?<eos> Must have made you very angry.<eos> Yeah, yeah, it did.
I never opened it.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I owe my life to a man, Duch, who executed thousands of others.<eos> My savior is a torturer.<eos> A murderer.<eos> I've no idea if he feels remorse.<eos> I do.
W... Wasn't he...<eos> The guy in the dungeon?<eos> That was Frank Darnell posing as him.<eos> I would've told you earlier, but I knew you'd be dealing with...<eos> He has, but he's good now. JT.<eos> Good. I think I found a space under the dungeon.<eos> It could have some more clues.<eos> I was hoping you could check it out.<eos> And you two will be...?<eos> Doing our day jobs for a change.
I don't think I ever told you that I'm sorry.<eos> For what, for trying to kill me?<eos> You had to say it.<eos> Sam's gone.<eos> I'm gonna go look for your, uh, friend.<eos> I can't be with her, JT.<eos> Ugh, what is wrong with people?<eos> You should just wear black on Valentine's Day.<eos> I don't deserve her, man.<eos> Yes, you do.
I have a 1989 strangulation victim dumped 10 miles from where the first body was found, only she was raped and stabbed.<eos> His comfort zone.<eos> Could be our unsub.<eos> Well, I've got two more, '01 and '03, except these took place in Clifford, Delaware.<eos> The M.O.'s an exact match.<eos> I got another one here from 2013, Scottsdale, Maryland.<eos> He was smart enough to cross state lines.<eos> The Crestview rapist was operating during that time.<eos> The male unsub never went dormant.<eos> Only the female did.
Listen, we're in Year 12, so I don't need to put up with your Year 9 shit. I don't care!<eos> Don't fuck with my little brother.<eos> Don't fuck with my face.<eos> Apologise for what you did.<eos> Apologise to my dick.<eos> That doesn't make sense, so I'm not going to do it.<eos> Your hair doesn't make sense.<eos> Get out of my fucking area!<eos> Do you want a fucking go about this?<eos> Yeah, I do!
I know that I apologized already, but I didn't know how personal this was for you;<eos> what that gem does.<eos> Well, you felt tied to it because of your, your family, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> But a 200-year-old relative versus something that has present-day power over you--<eos> I think that you win.<eos> You know what, tell me this:<eos> why would someone want a gem that controls beasts unless they already have, or they're creating, ones exactly like Tori and me?<eos> You have to get it back.<eos> No. We do.
Luckily, we have the Internet as a community of...<eos> Oh, this is terrible!<eos> She's quoting scriptures, but using tons of cuss words.<eos> - This is as bad as it gets with Caroline. - Okay.<eos> Berkley's around the corner at his baby's world music class.<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> I'm in.<eos> - Great.<eos> - What kind of beer does Berkley like?<eos> - He doesn't.
I bet it's really fancy, like Beauty and the Beast fancy.<eos> No, it's probably just an empty, white cube with a USB port in it for him to plug his finger in when he's on sleep mode.<eos> Apparently, my husband Kevin has invited you all to my party.<eos> There is very little street parking, no gifts, no singing of Happy Birthday.<eos> Should be fun.<eos> Sounds fantastic.<eos> Did you hear that?<eos> His husband invited us, not him.<eos> He so doesn't want us there.<eos> Yes, he does.
Okay, we'll fluff pillows.<eos> Come on.<eos> Please don't go.<eos> I made a decision today.<eos> - I am closing my clinics.<eos> - Why would you close M.E.N.D.?<eos> Because I want you to know how sorry I am.<eos> - And I want to make restitution somehow.<eos> - Wait, wait, closing clinics that are saving desperate mothers and ... and children?<eos> I-I don't ...
Imagine if her ex was Ryan Phillippe.<eos> Milo?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Oh.<eos> Hey.<eos> You know, just wanted to see what you do.<eos> Always wondered how candles got made.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
So, I guess this messes up your green card.<eos> Oh, please...<eos> You really think you're the only guy I can get to fake-marry me?<eos> Are you mad at me?<eos> Honestly, I'm a little relieved.<eos> You were starting to freak me out with all your cake-tasting and seating charts.<eos> So, we're good?<eos> Same old us?<eos> Do you promise to stop measuring me in my sleep?<eos> I do.
Easy.<eos> Bear wins on land, shark wins at sea.<eos> What about on neutral ground?<eos> Neutral ground?<eos> Like what, the sky?<eos> No, I mean make it a fair fight - ocean floor, but the bear gets scuba gear.<eos> - Interesting.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, how did your date with Kelly go?<eos> Did you finally...
- All of us.<eos> Uh-oh. Okay, I will open up to you guys.<eos> I am upset about a lot of women.<eos> I'm upset about Sam,<eos> I'm upset about you acting like a woman, and I'm upset about the infant that is literally taking a crap on my poker table.<eos> That's my fault, I shouldn't have given her apricots.<eos> Will, it's nothing to be ashamed of.<eos> I know what it's like to get blown off by women.<eos> Poker chip.<eos> No, I don't.
You're killing me now!<eos> We are not the same people.<eos> Maybe I had something to do with that.<eos> Trust does not come easily to me.<eos> I was always taught that love was delusion.<eos> That people love what you can give them, and a queen... what's the use of might-have-beens?<eos> It's too late.<eos> Those two naive children are dead now.<eos> We killed them.<eos> Did we?
Not until we figure out what to do.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - Yeah, yes.<eos> - I mean it, I'm serious.<eos> This could end up very badly if this gets out.<eos> Ok.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I was... really trying to help.<eos> Well, at least no one knows.<eos> - Ana does.
Then is it ok if I ask her out?<eos> Yeah. Sure.<eos> So, I talked to your mom.<eos> She's fine if you wanna go back tomorrow, so you can work on your audition and focus...<eos> Dad.<eos> I'm really sorry.<eos> For everything.<eos> - Didn't think...<eos> - No.<eos> No, you didn't.
Oh, baby.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> - You ok?<eos> - Yeah, it's just... it looks like Zac is going to have to move in with his dad for awhile.<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - In Arizona.<eos> - That sucks.<eos> - It's ok.<eos> - I just want him to be safe.<eos> - Yeah, of course you do.
When the day arrives that such a word is considered illmannered in good company, then we really will have lost all hope.<eos> You do believe in it, then.<eos> In love?<eos> I'm familiar with the affliction, yes.<eos> Did you ever marry?<eos> The truth now.<eos> I did not...<eos> Although I came very close once.<eos> But you know how it feels to want to spend the days of your life with someone that you cherish?<eos> I do.
Everybody thinks that, and they're not wrong.<eos> The child will be a daily reminder of our betrayal.<eos> That's not so.<eos> James never saw it as such.<eos> Whatever he claims, his heart will be broken.<eos> I believe he's a better man than you take him for and stronger.<eos> Well, I believe he's had more than his equitable share of sacrificing himself in the name of someone else's welfare.<eos> Then to be clear, what are you saying?<eos> I have to lay it out?<eos> Yes, you do.
Your father was decapitated in a motorcycle accident.<eos> Or have you forgotten?<eos> No, I haven't forgotten.<eos> It's OK.<eos> My mother killed herself when I was seven.<eos> Left me alone and unwanted.<eos> There's suffering all around us.<eos> Why not take some pleasure from it?<eos> I don't know how to get pleasure from suffering.<eos> Yes, you do.
I'm sorry.<eos> You were right.<eos> I did go to the police.<eos> Go to the police.<eos> I never will again.<eos> If you untie me now, I won't tell anybody what's happened.<eos> Please Peter.<eos> Please Peter, would you talk to me?<eos> I miss what we had.<eos> I do.
They are here to ask me some questions, but don't worry.<eos> They chromed me late.<eos> The machine's downstairs.<eos> My father got it to make his own pills... his own, uh...<eos> drug regimen.<eos> At the end, his doctors were trying all sorts of different treatment avenues.<eos> How long have you been dealing?<eos> We found the DNA profile of the girls who died on the backup log of your ChemPrinter... along with every customer you ever printed a pill for.<eos> Bet you didn't know it had that feature.<eos> So when did you...
Oh, come here, big man.<eos> Okay, I got you.<eos> I got you.<eos> It's all right, Vickie.<eos> His family's trouble is gone now.<eos> Aaron's cries can't hurt anyone anymore.<eos> This is the longest The Troubles have ever been in Haven.<eos> What if it stays this way forever?<eos> We'll cope.<eos> Haven always does.
When I first heard I'd be working for Gordon Clark, I wasn't sure he even knew his way around a motherboard.<eos> Well, I've been proven wrong a hundred times over, and, today, my respect for this guy has been taken to a whole new level.<eos> To Gordo, for kicking ass and taking names.<eos> To Gordo.<eos> Thanks, Gordon.<eos> Good job, buddy.<eos> Hey, I see you told them the good news about the LCD screen.<eos> Yeah, everyone's excited.<eos> Good, I thought maybe you didn't get my message.<eos> No, I did.
He deserves it-- everything he sacrificed for you-know-who.<eos> Wait, what do I get for my sacrifice?<eos> Curled toes.<eos> So, Gabe, I hear you're leaving.<eos> I'm going to try one of your canapes.<eos> Wish me luck.<eos> Weren't you going to tell me?<eos> Of course I was.<eos> I just, um...<eos> I didn't, because...
There's a whole lot of us who are gonna need rescuing.<eos> At least I hope there are. And the last thing I need is anybody else dying because of me.<eos> You love him?<eos> That would be none of your business, William Compton.<eos> If we're to be friends, Sookie, we should be able to talk about things like this.<eos> He wants kids.<eos> Ain't that what you want?<eos> When you and I were together...<eos> - ...children was something that we- - I do love him, Bill.<eos> I really do.
- Yes, it's Brian's.<eos> - Brian?<eos> Who's Brian?<eos> Wade and Rocky's father, my ex-husband.<eos> Well, they should be here, then. Adilyn!<eos> Wade, honey, if you're here, come on out.<eos> With your hands up where I can see them.<eos> You don't have to be so dramatic.<eos> - They didn't break any law.<eos> - Like hell, they didn't.
- At the BBG.<eos> - He's acting like he doesn't even know you.<eos> - Yeah, that's because he doesn't.<eos> Listen, Arlene, do not say anything to him, all right?<eos> - I'm on my way.<eos> - Okay.<eos> So...<eos> -...should I use this on you?<eos> - Uh... How much does it say to use? Um...<eos> It doesn't.
- Yeah, I'll be sure to do that, then.<eos> I'll see you in hell when I get there.<eos> There is no hell.<eos> You just try to convince yourself of that.<eos> You don't even know--<eos> Hold it together, Noomi.<eos> You are one with the universe.<eos> Keep it together.<eos> You know how on the news you see these... These places get wiped out by tornados but the people who live there are always vowing to rebuild on the exact same spot where tragedy took away everything they had?<eos> I do.
L-Look, this is more than just a condiment.<eos> A condiment is something that you throw on a meal at the last minute;<eos> it's an afterthought.<eos> Satan's Tongue is the main event.<eos> It's more like a meal replacement.<eos> I had one for breakfast, one for lunch, and then a sensible dinner.<eos> You know what, I'm gonna do something that I don't normally do.<eos> I'm gonna take off my sunglasses and I'm gonna really listen.<eos> This sauce of yours, does it have a story?<eos> It actually does.
No.<eos> Maybe it was the gardener 's wife.<eos> It was Mel Burke.<eos> Wow, geez, look.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> I never should have had a guest over here without asking your permission.<eos> She actually just came over to give me something.<eos> Oh, I know what she gave you.<eos> - You do?
No, she was totally gonna die.<eos> - No, she wasn't.<eos> - Yes, she was.<eos> - No, no, no, no, no. - You don't always have to say everything that pops into your mouth.<eos> - [Stacey crying] - I have to go to the bathroom.<eos> - Let me out.<eos> I have to go now!<eos> - Ow! - Come on. - Trevor, get up.<eos> - But he hurt me.<eos> - No, he didn't.
_<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> Tio, it's Javier.<eos> I need you and a cleaning crew down at La Isla Rica now.<eos> The Metas were never going to let us out of this deal.<eos> After our last payment, they were going to kill us all.<eos> Salazar is going to have to report back to his bosses.<eos> When he doesn't, they'll come looking for him.<eos> And when they do?
Because the $5 million you're not getting pays for my silence.<eos> "Silence"?<eos> For what?<eos> We both know I didn't do this.<eos> No.<eos> You did.<eos> Rumor on the streets is, you're still angry you didn't get the Fishscale rights from the Metas, so you took out your anger on my supplier.<eos> Are you still upset that we wouldn't move your product?<eos> How do I know you're not setting me up?<eos> You don't.
I'm telling you, son, now is not the time.<eos> I agree.<eos> I think we need to show restraint.<eos> "Restraint"?<eos> The Lords pin-cushioned Pops.<eos> They put me in this damn chair.<eos> I understand how you feel, Carlos, but...<eos> No!<eos> No, man.<eos> You don't.
Over my dead body, Pop.<eos> Well, if we don't, we're all dead, Carlos.<eos> Come on, this isn't a business merger you put together in a board room, Daniel.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Dad is a businessman.<eos> So is Lavar Quintel.<eos> What have you always told us?<eos> _ _<eos> We don't have anything to offer Lavar Quintel.<eos> Yes, we do.
You've got five minutes.<eos> If I think for one second that you're lying, I'll go to the DA, and I'll show her everything.<eos> I want the truth.<eos> All of it.<eos> My parents were dead, Jess.<eos> I was six years old, alone.<eos> Javier was the only one who loved me.<eos> He told me he was doing it for all the right reasons: to get the family out of crime, to go legitimate.<eos> And you believed that?<eos> I still do.
It's better if I show you.<eos> How did you get this?<eos> We have friends who are looking out for us, and they can look after you, too, if you join forces with us against the Metas.<eos> - I got no squabbles with the Metas.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> See, my father made a deal with them.<eos> They've taken over his operations, and soon they won't be satisfied with just Peacock Hill.<eos> They'll be looking to expand, which means sooner or later, they will come after you, Lavar, and you will need me as much as I need you.<eos> You want me to clean up your daddy's mess.<eos> No, no, no, no. I do not.
'Cause my friends tell me the truth.<eos> So why the lies?<eos> Jessica Chapel could derail everything that I have worked for, and I am not gonna let that happen.<eos> "Why the lies"?<eos> You're going to like my lies when they help you get the Latino vote when you're running for mayor.<eos> My lies can be very helpful when they serve your purposes.<eos> Won't be mayor if I'm behind bars like you.<eos> Calm down.<eos> No one knows about us.<eos> Does Lopez?
Well, you don't have to worry about her anymore.<eos> I'm getting you out of here.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> She won't let me.<eos> Whenever I try to leave, she...<eos> It's too late.<eos> She must know you're here.<eos> Now, you've already gone through labor once, so at least you know what to expect.<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> We both do.
Look, I... I don't mean to pry, but she did express some anxiety about all of this.<eos> You did?<eos> David, we're missing a year of memories in the Enchanted Forest.<eos> We suddenly find ourselves in Storybrooke about to have a baby?<eos> It's... a bit disconcerting.<eos> I think it's best to just get these anxieties out in the open.<eos> Feelings, especially those we keep bottled up, can affect a pregnancy just as much as diet and exercise.<eos> Look, I suppose what I'm trying to say is that... If you've got any fears at all about any of this, it's best to just get it out<eos> - into the open.<eos> - I don't.
After alleged reports of assault against staff and an increase in neighborhood crime, this was the last in a long line of unwanted controversies for the church-owned and operated halfway house which was forced to finally shut its doors on February 28, 1996."<eos> I may have been a bit hasty with my initial investigation.<eos> If I had to make a bet, I'd say this place is crawling with NRE.<eos> - What?<eos> - Negative residual energy.<eos> - It's what happens when a spirit...<eos> - I don't need to know the lingo. - I just need you to get rid of it.<eos> - Well, it's not that simple.<eos> - Why did you say it was?<eos> - I didn't.
We think one of your executives may have been targeted.<eos> How did Lawrence Iver fit into the hierarchy here?<eos> Larry?<eos> He was an ace.<eos> He made our clients a boatload trading distressed debt.<eos> Came here to the mother ship five years ago.<eos> He had been on the commodities desk ever since.<eos> Did he have any enemies at the company?<eos> I guess.<eos> We all do.
A wedding in the courtyard with... eight guests?<eos> That's all we need.<eos> My parents, your parents.<eos> My two sisters and their husbands.<eos> And the ho... the hotel in Santa Barbara?<eos> - We'll lose the deposit.<eos> - Aw, the hell with the deposit.<eos> What?<eos> I-I thought you wanted to get married, babe.<eos> I do, it...
Yeah, nobody in or out of the embassy.<eos> Where's Redmond?<eos> In with the Ambassador.<eos> Ah, good morning.<eos> Ambassador.<eos> - How was the flight?<eos> - Bumpy.<eos> Got to admit, you're the last person I expected to see here.<eos> - I assume you got my cable.<eos> - I did.
What's the connection?<eos> Burns' wife.<eos> Meet Sally Ann Burns.<eos> But we know her better as Sally Ann Caldwell.<eos> The name on the other plane ticket.<eos> The reason we couldn't find her is because she hasn't used her maiden name in over 20 years.<eos> So Guy Ingram and Burns' wife were gonna run away together.<eos> Burns must've found out and made sure that didn't happen.<eos> All right, how do we get to Sally Ann?<eos> We don't.
So you don't care if you go back to prison?<eos> Better to lose favor in the eyes of man than in the eyes of the Lord.<eos> It's like you said, a man who knows his calling must do everything in his power to live up to it.<eos> Have we met?<eos> Not officially, sir.<eos> I saw you get baptized at Hand of God four days ago.<eos> You opened my eyes to what it means to be saved, and now I see you're a modern day Solomon.<eos> So whatever decision you make here today, I'm good with it.<eos> Uh, Mr. Dennison, uh...<eos> Did you, uh...
I prefer "Regina."<eos> You think you can bring down the Wicked Witch with sticks?<eos> Well, I'm certainly going to try.<eos> I'm afraid we're too late.<eos> She's long gone.<eos> Well, perhaps she left a trail.<eos> I was hoping the same thing.<eos> Well, then you've got yourself a partner.<eos> I don't remember asking for one.<eos> You didn't.
Okay.<eos> Doesn't hurt to ask.<eos> If anyone wants to stop by, give his morale a boost.<eos> Hope can heal.<eos> Can hope make up for the years of misery that he put us through?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Come by.<eos> Find out.<eos> He doesn't deserve to go out like this.<eos> No one does.
Thought you didn't care.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Why are you going, then?<eos> It's my son, man.<eos> All right, I'll get dressed.<eos> No, no, look, it's fine.<eos> I'll head over by myself.<eos> I'll be back in a couple hours.<eos> What, you don't want me to go?<eos> Probably best if you don't, tough guy.
- Don't you dare!<eos> - God, please--<eos> When you see a stranger on the street and...<eos> - God, please don't let her go to East Indiana State.<eos> - Stop it, Axl!<eos> Oh, you have freakishly strong fingers.<eos> Hey! Knock it off.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> - God, please don't-- - Ow!<eos> Don't you--
I was voting for the Teen Choice Awards, and I voted twice.<eos> I just love Kaley Cuoco so much.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Did you even know she was going to this party the other night?<eos> Yes, I knew she was going.<eos> Did you know there'd be alcohol?<eos> Yes, I knew there'd be alcohol, so I rushed her right over.<eos> But first, we stopped at my dealer's house and did some pot.<eos> I'm just saying-- she's getting to the age where you got to keep your eye on these things.<eos> Oh, I do?
Before.<eos> Why?<eos> Check your timeline.<eos> Kemp Jr. rapes Heba.<eos> 24 hours later, the paper his dad bailed out twice calls her a liar on its front page.<eos> You think I'm in the tank for Kemp?<eos> How dare you?<eos> I write for the working stiff, the guy that takes the 7 train, the guy who worries whether his kid needs a new pair of shoes or not.<eos> Okay, Jimmy, I understand.<eos> No, you don't.
Hey, Cam, hold off on that thing for a second.<eos> Lily, honey?<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> It's all in good fun.<eos> All right. Good.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Who's this little dumpling?<eos> Only my niece.<eos> If there's one thing she loves, it's piggy-back.<eos> No, I don't.
I don't know.<eos> The truth is, those guys weren't really brothers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> They said that they were...<eos> No, no, it doesn't matter what they said.<eos> Family isn't about whose womb you come from or whose blood type you share.<eos> It's, um...<eos> You remember when your mom and I went out and left Ben in charge for the first time?<eos> And you guys had that huge fight and you kicked a hole in the bedroom door.<eos> I didn't...
Over 2,000... .. and needs to be seen to be believed.<eos> When there's no more... .. balls.<eos> A few new tricks from fellow perf...<eos> 'Tixy, I feel like my mind has been poisoned by beauty.<eos> 'I was so annoyed at myself.<eos> I had the perfect chance 'to throw a pint of sex in his face, and I blew it. '<eos> All right, fatty?<eos> Er, where have you two been?<eos> We've just been out having fun, like young couples do, you know.<eos> No, I don't.
We got cable.<eos> We got pretty much everything we have at ho--at the house.<eos> Check it out.<eos> I got a couple of games we could try out this weekend.<eos> Cool.<eos> Syd. Here's that rainbow loom you have at home.<eos> I thought we could, uh, you know, go rainbow... Bracelet crazy this weekend.<eos> I don't play with that anymore.<eos> I'm ten now.<eos> You don't?
Ow, it hurts." Click.<eos> It's mostly the execution.<eos> That's how it is.<eos> - I see.<eos> I understand.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Well, anyway, I like it.<eos> All right.<eos> I think that's the cover.<eos> I do too.
- Hey, Carl.<eos> - Bags.<eos> Do you-- where's your stuff?<eos> I can't go.<eos> What?<eos> huh?<eos> I know it sounds crazy.<eos> I'm sure I'll never have this chance again.<eos> But I was getting ready, and I looked in the bathroom mirror, and you know that sticker I have?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
I mean, God knows I still struggle, but these last two weeks, they've just been really... blurry.<eos> Do you remember going to dinner with your sponsor last night?<eos> Was that last night?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Yes, you're right. It was.<eos> So, then, when did you go to the hotel and meet Justin?<eos> I don't remember.<eos> Anita, we have a witness that saw you accost Justin outside of a coffee shop a couple of days ago.<eos> - Do you remember that?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Heed me.<eos> Give me the heart.<eos> And who is this?<eos> Roland!<eos> Go back!<eos> - Come here, little boy.<eos> - Don't!<eos> Please.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> I really don't.
Hopefully the same thing you see in me... a second chance.<eos> And you're quite a good kisser.<eos> Just wait till I actually have my heart back.<eos> What is that like?<eos> - I mean, can you...<eos> - Feel?<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Just not fully.<eos> It's difficult to explain.<eos> Then don't.
And then the only way to stop us from interfering was to bring us back here and wipe our memories.<eos> So if we get our memories back, we might already know how to defeat her.<eos> We just need to break this curse.<eos> Well, thank goodness we have a savior.<eos> I would love to, but there's one problem.<eos> Last time, all it took was me believing in magic and kissing Henry.<eos> Since I've been back, I've done both and nothing.<eos> It's the belief.<eos> Henry... he needs to believe.<eos> In this new life... he doesn't.
A book can't just disappear.<eos> But it can just appear.<eos> The first curse.<eos> It just showed up in my closet when I needed it...<eos> - or more accurately, when Henry needed it.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> He was going through a rough time.<eos> He was realizing he had been given up.<eos> He didn't feel like he had a real family.<eos> He did.
Let's go, Molky. We're late.<eos> Hey, good luck, Terry.<eos> All right, man. Appreciate it.<eos> Okay. I should get out of here.<eos> Okay, you want to get something off your chest?<eos> Last night?<eos> I just... I don't really think you needed to lay those guys out, you know?<eos> Hildy, those guys were assholes, okay?<eos> They were looking for a fight, and I didn't... I didn't... I didn't have a choice.<eos> Yeah, you did.
The blood they took from that boy... any sign of it yet?<eos> This just happened; they haven't processed the scene yet.<eos> Go find out what our father-son team - was doing at that black site. - Yes, sir.<eos> It's for you, Miss Fitch.<eos> Yes? Last time we spoke, I said we were just getting started.<eos> Do something for me today, your daughter walks out of here.<eos> Why should I believe you this time?<eos> The only thing you need to believe is that there was a dead boy in a barn, and a mother who put him there.<eos> I know who you are, Francis.<eos> We all do.
Tell me you understand.<eos> I understand. And my sister is unharmed?<eos> Thank you, Director Widener.<eos> At this time, the committee would like to call Porter Pearce CEO Meg Fitch.<eos> Ms. Fitch, you've been called today to answer allegations that your company is linked to that horrible video showing American servicemen shooting innocent civilians.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> I welcome the opportunity, Mr. Chairman.<eos> Please raise your right hand.<eos> Do you swear that the testimony you give before this Senate committee today will be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth?<eos> I do.
Arms up.<eos> He had a 6-foot frog tongue!<eos> He bled white!<eos> He had worms in his blood!<eos> Sir, you need to chill out.<eos> Get the light out of my face, man.<eos> In a couple of hours, you'll come down off of whatever shit you took, but in the meantime, you need to follow my instructions.<eos> Now bend forward and expose your buttocks.<eos> I didn't take nothing.<eos> I don't do drugs.
There, it's M. Tartullo.<eos> In another one, it's Nicky Tull.<eos> There's no way one guy witnessed all these crimes.<eos> It's obviously a phony eyewitness giving bogus statements.<eos> Rix is cooking his cases.<eos> Guy's got brass ones...<eos> I'll give him that.<eos> He's barely even changing the name.<eos> I know, and the system's so big, no one ever caught it.<eos> Linda did.
- Anyone else with them?<eos> - Not that I know.<eos> Do you know where your brother's truck is?<eos> A 2004 Chevy Silverado...<eos> I know what it is.<eos> It's not here.<eos> He drove it last night.<eos> Now, your brother's friend, was he a Lausenschlange too?<eos> - I don't know what you mean.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
We're a long way from high school.<eos> You may be good with a soldering iron but when it comes to the big picture... you have no idea!<eos> What the hell?<eos> ...Alicia's arrival is imminent, currently traveling west approaching 75 miles per hour, expected to exceed that, before reaching shore sometime late tomorrow morning.<eos> Reports of oil company employees being evacuated by helicopter from offshore rigs in the path of the storm have punctuated the fear and trepidation that's felt by many.<eos> Advanced computer probability...<eos> Hold on, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Where did you...
Any questions?<eos> I got a question.<eos> Are you banging Joe MacMillan?<eos> Oh, yeah, I'm stupid for thinking a toy store might carry the world's most popular toy.<eos> Hello?<eos> Debbie!<eos> - Any luck?<eos> - Not yet!<eos> Uh, yes, I'm looking for a Cabbage Patch Kid.<eos> You do?
There's just something about you that gets me talking.<eos> Oh, well, you know, actually, it's kind of my bread and butter.<eos> I'm a therapist. [Gasps] Like Frasier.<eos> Will there be some witty banter about wine and opera?<eos> Okay, got to go, but if you and your husband just want to talk, maybe I can help.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> And do you happen to know what area of the bowling alley I can find a good dentist in?<eos> That was such a fun night, Marty.<eos> Did you see my lasso dance every time I knocked down a pin?<eos> Yeah, I sure did.
No, I'll-- It's the 614C, right?<eos> And D, yeah.<eos> Did you get the soup I sent you?<eos> Oh, yes, thank you.<eos> Well, I better grab those forms.<eos> _<eos> Hey, look.<eos> Come on.<eos> Got it.<eos> Hey. What you doing here, loser?
My hair blond and move, I don't know, back to Atlanta.<eos> Is there anything I can do, anything to cheer you up?<eos> If you took me to lunch, I'd be the happiest guy in the world, but that's crazy.<eos> No, no, no, no, no. Lunch it is.<eos> All right.<eos> It's a date.<eos> All right, great. Hey, min.<eos> You got a sec?<eos> I got some pretty hot gossip.<eos> I don't, Danny.
We went searching.<eos> I found the roller.<eos> There's no sign of her.<eos> All right, let's just ask you a few questions.<eos> Shouldn't we be putting together a search party?<eos> First things first.<eos> Uh, can anybody think of anybody who may wish Bertie harm?<eos> No.<eos> Bertie doesn't have an enemy in the world.<eos> No, but I do.
What?<eos> You don't remember.<eos> Remember what?<eos> It's your orderly Indogene brain trying to process the inexplicable.<eos> You remember that I left, but not how I left.<eos> You didn't want to remember.<eos> No, Lev.<eos> I died eight years ago after I opened my veins and I left you holding all that guilt.<eos> Say you forgive me.<eos> I do.
I taught you better than that.<eos> Don't do that again.<eos> - I deserve to die. - Hey!<eos> Stop talking like that.<eos> Anyway, you didn't.<eos> Irzu won't let me die.<eos> Would you stop that?<eos> This thing inside you, it doesn't come from Irzu or any other kind of god.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do, okay?
This is Michael Gough from Swimming Achievers.<eos> Are you able to come here straightaway?<eos> Physical violence is behaviour we just don't tolerate here.<eos> What happened?<eos> Eva pushed Rory down the steps near the change rooms.<eos> It's lucky he didn't break his skull.<eos> - He called you a name.<eos> -That's no excuse for you to...<eos> He's the guy! He's the guy that killed that little boy!<eos> He did not!
Tucker:<eos> You know my dad will freak out, but I can't keep this up.<eos> You know my knowledge of the law is limited to TV shows and that time we went to jury duty just to pick up girls.<eos> Look, I don't care who she killed.<eos> That defendant was guilty of first degree sexiness.<eos> You may not know anything about the law, but we do know someone who does.<eos> Well, unfortunately the deposed is indisposed and won't be re-disposed until an undisclosed time.<eos> So in other words, I'm gonna be a while. - Oh!<eos> - It's all right. I've got you.<eos> Yes. Yes, you do.
Wait.<eos> Just now this happened?<eos> I know, I know.<eos> It's so silly.<eos> But something about the way he looked at me literally took my breath away.<eos> Really?<eos> you... you need to say something.<eos> Oh my God, no. I could never.<eos> I mean, what if he doesn't like me back?<eos> Oh, he does.
The man who cursed you, Henry Parish, is my son.<eos> Needless to say, he's going through a rebellious phase.<eos> You a soldier?<eos> You have the, uh... the posture.<eos> I am.<eos> I fight in the war to which your father gave his life.<eos> Which is why, though it pains me to say, we cannot trust my son with your cure.<eos> You love your son?<eos> In spite of everything, yes.<eos> I do.
Come on. I got your little mag here.<eos> It's a newspaper!<eos> A newspaper, Wade.<eos> Oh, yeah. Without the Belles, this Toast and Roast is toast.<eos> If they're putting on their own show, who's gonna want to watch us?<eos> I don't even know what we're doing here.<eos> I got 19 episodes of Chicago Fire burning up my DVR.<eos> We all done crying in our soup?<eos> Oh, come on, Lavon, you got to admit, things are looking mighty bleak.<eos> No. No, I don't.
- No, no, no. We love... we love your lights. Um, we just...<eos> We don't want you to be concerned.<eos> Right. The only spotlight you should be worried about is the one that you're gonna use... to make a baby.<eos> What?<eos> Ew, Lavon. No. That worked.<eos> Okay, good enough for me.<eos> I love y'all, but everybody out!<eos> Oh. Now!<eos> You know I love you.<eos> I do. I... Mm.
Excuse me.<eos> - It already looks great. - Oh.<eos> No condiments left on the tables, unrefrigerated.<eos> What was that?<eos> Sounds like some kind of animal.<eos> No, trust me, there are no animals in this restaurant.<eos> You're gonna get it now.<eos> Stop it!<eos> Get away!<eos> Don't do it!
Don't listen to a stranger.<eos> Why change...<eos> Karl, don't forget Dad's last words:<eos> "Listen to the yellow bird".<eos> Right! Darius says "yellow bird". 2 minutes later, a yellow bird shows up!<eos> This is nonsense!<eos> Darius talked to you?<eos> What did he say?<eos> Well, he made me promise to take you to Africa. - He said that?<eos> Yeah, he did.
Bon voyage!<eos> We'll survive for 6, maybe 7 days on our own.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> We'll just make them count.<eos> Nah, well, it's just it's a lot farther than I thought.<eos> I'm sure Karl will be very happy to take over.<eos> Stop making excuses! If my father wanted Karl to lead us, he would have said so. But he asked you.<eos> He must've had a good reason.<eos> I really can't think of one.<eos> Plus, he didn't really...
What else...<eos> I know what it's like to be stuck here!<eos> If I never met you guys, never figured out how to get out of here...<eos> She's been here for 40 years!<eos> 40 years!<eos> And you guys are all moving on, and...<eos> - No, I'm not...<eos> - Yes, you are!<eos> And I don't have a life to move on to.<eos> I don't.
Three, two, one.<eos> There you go.<eos> Hi, James.<eos> How are you?<eos> Hey, Beth.<eos> - Hi, Lana.<eos> - Hey, is Danny okay?<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - He didn't come in this morning.<eos> Yeah, he did.
I told you.<eos> I was working.<eos> You know Danny wasn't at school today, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Danny died last night.<eos> How?<eos> We're not sure.<eos> He was found lying on the beach early this morning.<eos> Does his mom and dad know?<eos> Yeah, they do.
I used to do the same thing with Tom.<eos> Does Tom know?<eos> Promise me, Ellie, because I don't know your boss.<eos> You and me, we go back.<eos> The boys go back.<eos> I'm relying on you to catch them.<eos> I promise you, Beth.<eos> I promise.<eos> He did know, didn't he, that I love him?<eos> Of course he did.
Mo' mass, mo' speed, mo' "mentum."<eos> (Laughs) Nailed it!<eos> What's up, Coach?<eos> So, when we were studying and I brought up college, what did you mean by,<eos> "that's not gonna happen"?<eos> I meant I'm not gonna leave my mom and I'm not trying to go 50k in debt by the time I'm 21.<eos> What if you could get a scholarship for field hockey?<eos> They have those?<eos> (Scoffs) They have scholarships for kids who speak Klingon,<eos> - so yeah, they do.
Yelling at him isn't gonna change a thing.<eos> Oh, so you'll just let him walk all over you?<eos> Maybe we should do this another time.<eos> So, I'm gonna get a scout to the game tomorrow to check out Sharee.<eos> Oh, that's awesome.<eos> She has so much raw talent.<eos> I just really want her to get the chance she deserves.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
If it makes other people uncomfortable, that's their problem.<eos> - I wish I could be more like that.<eos> - You can.<eos> So your book bombs?<eos> Big deal!<eos> You tried something!<eos> Unless you want to climb back on that safe little boat<eos> - I found you on.<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.
No, I don't want you to chaperone.<eos> And so it doesn't make sense for your bag to go if you're not going.<eos> Wait.<eos> What--honey, I'm--<eos> - I wish I was still friends with Micah.<eos> He gets to take an extra bag because of his wheelchair.<eos> Okay, can you stop for a second?<eos> Why don't you want me to chaperone?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I just don't.
I just--I thought that he was past this stage, but I guess it's never over, so...<eos> Uh, all right, listen, thanks a lot for staying here with him.<eos> I know it couldn't have been easy after seeing that.<eos> Max is--is a cool dude, you know, most of the time.<eos> And honestly, I'm not supposed to say this, but a lot of these kids-- they're jackasses.<eos> - Well...<eos> - You know, I-I try to--<eos> I try to step in where I can, but it's--it's gotten bad.<eos> I think that next year is gonna be much better.<eos> I really do.
I don't know.<eos> You getting as tired of that answer as I am?<eos> You could say that.<eos> So, cheap and stupid.<eos> Guess I'll have to get by on my looks.<eos> Like you don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> What's that on your wrist?<eos> It's faded ink.<eos> And of course I don't know what it means.<eos> But you did.
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?<eos> They grow up so fast.<eos> You already know why I asked you to come here.<eos> I assume the lawsuit jarred you out of your stubborn obliviousness.<eos> You don't move in straight lines Kellogg.<eos> You never have.<eos> You say you want apples when you want oranges.<eos> You claim you want to sue me and pretend you want a pay day.<eos> I just want things to be fair.<eos> No you don't.
None of this shit of turning girls out for drugs.<eos> We say we're gonna look out for each other.<eos> Then that's what we got to do ...<eos> - for real.<eos> Okay?<eos> - If she really hit that screw<eos> - in county, she's harder than she looks.<eos> - My brother told me the real story.<eos> Guard was psycho.<eos> He did himself.
None taken.<eos> I'm gonna pop a squat.<eos> Still something underneath all the mumbo jumbo.<eos> The way women treat each other.<eos> It's like they're fighting over table scraps.<eos> I don't mean just in here.<eos> Back in high school ... scheming to steal someone else's man, talking behind each other's backs.<eos> Girls grow up nipping and s-scratching and whupping each other's ass.<eos> It's no wonder when a man does it back... we think it's normal.<eos> Until we don't.
No!<eos> We don't have any friends.<eos> - Let's party!<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Get some!<eos> Ah, this sucks, dude.<eos> Oh!<eos> Look at this crew!<eos> Who knows what day it is?<eos> I do.
I painted you something, 'cause sometimes it's easier than talking.<eos> And it kind of says everything about how I feel.<eos> Really?<eos> I know art's not your thing, but I kind of feel like I captured it.<eos> I mean, this is us.<eos> Obviously, you nailed it.<eos> Totally us.<eos> You get it?<eos> I didn't know if you'd get it.<eos> Of course I do.
How come you're quitting, quitter?<eos> I'm just not that into it.<eos> That's all.<eos> Because your mom didn't get a part?<eos> She totally should have.<eos> She was really good.<eos> But you don't want to do it without her?<eos> - Is that it?<eos> - I... no, I didn't want to do it in the first place, so...<eos> Yeah, you didn't.
You going after Tanner now?<eos> What are your followers up to?<eos> Oh, you'll see, my old friend.<eos> I'm slightly concerned, though, that this may be our final moment together because you're right about one thing.<eos> My time is up.<eos> Yeah. It is.<eos> Since we're being... Intimate, let me ask, do you miss her?<eos> I mean, how often do you think about Claire?<eos> Good, because I miss her, Ryan.<eos> I really do.
You let them come hunt me down because I've had a good ride.<eos> How would you like to get back in the fight, Joe?<eos> So what do you have in mind?<eos> I've been thinking about this whole thing the wrong way.<eos> Guerrera pack loves to hunt.<eos> They're primal, alphas.<eos> I gave you my reason for not making a move these past few months.<eos> What, pray tell, is theirs?<eos> They don't have the stake.<eos> Well, then who the hell does?
Yeah, I didn't think it was the best idea to stick around and answer questions.<eos> You don't think you and an explosion at the same place is a coincidence?<eos> Hey, check this out.<eos> It's a GPS.<eos> I found it on your jacket.<eos> It's wasted now.<eos> You took out one of Steelgraves' crew earlier tonight.<eos> It was a set up so they could plant that thing on me.<eos> Oliver, I know what you're thinking.<eos> No, you don't.
Mary: I'm aware.<eos> I'm what this realm needs.<eos> Nobles like my father lord narcisse gave the crown To your husband's family.<eos> They can take it away.<eos> You're making a mistake!<eos> And your husband will hate you for it.<eos> As soon as he learns how the world works, How it's always worked.<eos> Open the door, put him inside.<eos> His mother knows it.<eos> So did his father.
Ramona.<eos> (Door slamming)<eos> (Rumbling)<eos> (Ramona giggling, echoing)<eos> (Grunting, sighing)<eos> (Coughing)<eos> Well, there you are.<eos> - I see you got my message.<eos> - Yep!<eos> I did.
Well, if Berman knew he had incriminated himself on tape...<eos> He'd go to any lengths to get it back.<eos> Victoria, this investigation is ongoing, and exposing it to Mr. Berman or anyone at JP Harding would break federal statutes.<eos> But I thought that this was something that you and your team needed to know.<eos> I'd certainly say so.<eos> So I trust that you will keep my office in the loop if there are any... significant developments.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Of course.<eos> Sir, I didn't... I didn't know you had a sister.<eos> Oh, well, now you do.
You said Peter was wearing his wire when he was killed.<eos> I'm afraid that's not possible.<eos> So you knew about the wire?<eos> You admit you were in on it with him.<eos> Jamie.<eos> It's not illegal to know.<eos> And I guarantee you you will never link me to that payment, so you'll never be able to prove witness tampering.<eos> But, yeah, I knew about the wire.<eos> And Peter wasn't wearing it when he was killed because he had already left it for the feds at the dead drop at Lafayette and Spring.<eos> How do you even...
I've got the black cable.<eos> Myka!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I mean, is everything all right down...<eos> We are not talking about that, okay?<eos> What the hell are you guys still doing out here?<eos> Am I really the only one that reads the Regent's Addendums to the manual?<eos> Okay, look, we know that the shield draws its power from the Alpha Centauri Star System.<eos> - I knew that.<eos> - No, he didn't.

It is the inevitable.<eos> A force beyond your comprehension is coming for you ... you and Skye.<eos> She has something we want.<eos> And she will die giving it to us.<eos> I have seen it.<eos> Go to hell.<eos> No matter where I go or what you do to me, I will always ...<eos> What did you do?<eos> - Wait. What just happened?<eos> - Did Ward just...
Think about the Centipede program, how he experimented on innocent people like Mike Peterson, how he kidnapped and tortured Coulson, how he ordered Quinn to shoot you.<eos> And he wasn't gonna stop, Skye.<eos> Not until you...<eos> I wasn't gonna let that happen.<eos> - So, what happens now?<eos> - I face a S.H.I.E.L.D. review board.<eos> Whatever the punishment, I'll take it.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> But I don't regret what I've done.<eos> - You don't?
- And now he's dead.<eos> - After the attacks led us right to him.<eos> The investigation all wrapped up in a neat little bow.<eos> I feel like he could still be out there right now, in our heads.<eos> Or in our files.<eos> When you told me to check into the psych evals, you said something.<eos> You said, "read his mind."<eos> And it got me thinking.<eos> And Ward said that the Clairvoyant knew how to push all the right buttons.<eos> Raina did that to me, too.
How?<eos> !<eos> It doesn't matter, sweetheart.<eos> You need to let those people go.<eos> You've got to stop this.<eos> Mark.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You played me.<eos> You think I'm an idiot...<eos> No. I don't, Mark.
Makes me wonder what he's thinking sometimes.<eos> Take yourself, Sister.<eos> Should've been you he recommended for Matron.<eos> Should have been you.<eos> But they do say that him and Grace Carter is close, so...<eos> It's a topsy-turvy world, Sister.<eos> And nothing more topsy-turvy than that cocky sort.<eos> Turning up in men's clothes.<eos> Neither fish nor flesh, if you ask me.<eos> But I didn't.
Who?<eos> Your husband.<eos> Can he talk to you?<eos> Of course he can talk.<eos> That's good.<eos> George, my boy, he can't talk.<eos> He was hit in the head.<eos> I don't think he sees me.<eos> Doesn't know I'm there.<eos> Of course he does.
So, you feel compelled to save everybody else.<eos> Was it your father in the regiment?<eos> No.<eos> Are you ready now?<eos> I don't even know which direction I'm facing.<eos> You know, I still think you have a question for me.<eos> If you do, you need to ask it now.<eos> The Blighty convoy is here, Major.<eos> Sir, in your regiment... ..do you know of a Subedar Major Amar Singh?<eos> Yes, I do.
Sonmanto holds a number of safe deposit boxes and uses them primarily as back-up for pending patents, contracts, etc.<eos> Well it will be very helpful to our investigation to know exactly what's been removed.<eos> I checked the records as soon as we knew about the robbery.<eos> That particular box was empty.<eos> As I mentioned, we have more than a few.<eos> You do know that impeding a police investigation is a very serious offense.<eos> And you know that as a Fortune500 company, we have a full complement of lawyers that can back-up my truthful and helpful statement.<eos> But why go there. Liber8 is behind this robbery Mr. Richardson.<eos> You don't want them having anything of yours.<eos> And they don't.
See? That's your problem, Brick.<eos> You are a rigid thinker.<eos> That's why I'm gonna end up ruling the world.<eos> All the big-time rich guys -- Steve Jobs... other guys -- they're all creative thinkers, risk-takers.<eos> I don't know about this, Axl.<eos> Wha-- look, that's fine.<eos> Go ahead. Dress like one of the characters in the book and do a lame presentation like a million other kids.<eos> What do you want, Brick?<eos> Do you want to go the safe route, or do you want to be an innovator, a trailblazer, a rule breaker? !<eos> I do.
So, this is where the Heck laundry goes down, huh?<eos> Yep, this is where the magic happens.<eos> I've seen the clean clothes, but you never get to see behind the scenes.<eos> [ Laughs ] Very few have had the privilege.<eos> [ Clears throat ] So, listen, I was thinking, you know, sometimes people don't always have dates to the prom.<eos> [ Chuckles ] And I don't know if you do or you don't, but if you don't and you want to go, I'm around, so I could take you if you want.<eos> Are you kidding me right now?<eos> ! No, uh, but if you don't want to --<eos> No. No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I do, I do, I do.
As a matter of fact, there was.<eos> It's official... the Department of Humanity now has complete control and authority over the lottery winners and embryos.<eos> I have complete confidence and faith in your ability to do the right thing here, Darius.<eos> Thank you, Mr. President.<eos> I'll... try to do my best.<eos> What's the best way to handle this?<eos> Handle what?<eos> The lottery winners.<eos> How do we tell them that they're not going home... that they're gonna be sequestered in a facility in South Carolina for the next two years and that their babies will be the property of the United States government?<eos> We don't.
I'd have to say the one where that asshole Mr. Carlton locked me in the cellar because I didn't say thank you fast enough.<eos> Yeah, that was a bad one.<eos> You?<eos> Worst?<eos> - The one where that Mr. Holsher.<eos> - Hullbert.<eos> Hullbert, right.<eos> What a prick.<eos> I should have punched that son of a bitch in the face.<eos> You did.
Five diplomats were killed in China.<eos> They need to figure out what happened.<eos> They're trying to eliminate you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Make their lives easier and yours.<eos> Well, I told them I didn't have anything to do with this.<eos> I just got done clearing out Nathan's office.<eos> So you've been drinking.<eos> I thought you gave that up.<eos> - I did.
Fifteen years.<eos> Really beautiful years, yeah.<eos> Really powerful.<eos> It's really amazing.<eos> You know, to have someone who's been able to see you grow for such a long time, I mean...<eos> Yeah.<eos> It's special.<eos> Look at me!<eos> I... I lied.<eos> I did.
Now you really need to go.<eos> You really need to go.<eos> - Do I really need to go?<eos> - You really need to go!<eos> Get out, get out!<eos> Grow up!<eos> Kieran, we're wrapped.<eos> For the day.<eos> Just wrap it.<eos> Wrap wrap wrap, done done done.
No. You'll have to excuse my incredulity, but it seems to me that you and Mr. Gardner share... almost everything.<eos> Your incredulity... is excused.<eos> Do you have any other questions, Mr. Dubeck, or is that it?<eos> I was just giving Mrs. Florrick a chance to reconsider her response.<eos> No, I'm good.<eos> You and Mr. Gardner are lovers,<eos> - isn't that correct? - Excuse me.<eos> What does that have to do with anything?<eos> The relationship between two lawyers on Governor Florrick's legal team - bears a direct relationship to...<eos> - No. No, it does not.
Come on. We have so much left to learn about each other, stuff you can only learn if you're crammed together in a small space and you can't get out.<eos> Just you and me.<eos> Four walls.<eos> No boundaries, no escape.<eos> When you put it like that, it sounds amazing.<eos> - And like prison.<eos> - Well, I feel like if we get tired of each other, I can always run across the hall to my room. It's so close.<eos> Just pop over there.<eos> Mm. - Do you not want to? - Whoa.<eos> I did not...
- They rushed me here.<eos> - You're here for the toy convention?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Been meaning to get there myself.<eos> Supposed to get an award tonight.<eos> - For real? - Yeah.<eos> You in the toy business?<eos> Inventor.<eos> You know the Finger Paddle?<eos> Oh, God, my kids used to play that game for hours.<eos> Some still do.
Called in, said he has information regarding Michael Elliot.<eos> I brought him up here.<eos> That's all right, isn't it?<eos> Commander, Special Agent Gibbs.<eos> You asked to see me?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Please, have a seat.<eos> When I heard about Michael Elliot's murder, I thought I should contact you.<eos> - How do you know him?<eos> - I don't.
Excuse me.<eos> We'll be leaving in a minute.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't worry. Did he work on any sensitive or classified issues?<eos> Mostly he just worked with constituents from the state who had requests or problems.<eos> We'll need access to his office computer and files.<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Will? Would you please call Jennifer?<eos> May I ask, do you have any suspects?<eos> We do.
Don't change the subject.<eos> Now, what are you doing in Washington? Come clean with me.<eos> What's this great news that you were gonna tell me about before we were interrupted?<eos> You call shooting a man an "interruption"? Dad.<eos> I found my soul mate.<eos> I'm getting married.<eos> This is interesting. What?<eos> - Are you talking to me?<eos> - You said something.<eos> I did?
Yeah, okay. That's not reassuring.<eos> Hey, Dan. Dan.<eos> I just want to say I'm sorry if I wasn't very sympathetic to your, you know, mental head issues.<eos> So... I'm sorry.<eos> Friends?<eos> Go fuck yourself, "Jack and the Giant Freakstalk."<eos> Your team lost, and you should be fitted with a leper bell, you sinking shit.<eos> Yeah, okay.<eos> Boy, I do not know what I saw in you.<eos> I do.
- Not according to my birth certificate.<eos> - Would you excuse me for a moment, please?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Could you just help the gentleman on his way out the door.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Why didn't you tell me that wasn't David Fickler?<eos> - You didn't ask.<eos> - Hey, how did everything go?<eos> It didn't.
( Laughs ) Come on.<eos> But I think you might have taken it a little too far.<eos> Well, think what you want.<eos> But my life is easier now that I don't have those urges anymore.<eos> - Aha.<eos> - What?<eos> - You just checked her out.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> - I didn't.
- You're mistaken, my lady, I never...<eos> - Please.<eos> My friend needs your compassion.<eos> It's dangerous, casting off a babe.<eos> I understand.<eos> No.<eos> Truly dangerous.<eos> Not just to your reputation.<eos> I was warned many girls don't survive.<eos> You did.
My calculator's on the desk.<eos> No, Selina said this is gonna be my office.<eos> You don't need an office.<eos> You have a bag.<eos> - Okay, that's bullying.<eos> - Well, why don't you take it up with the president?<eos> - Guys... - Kent: Why don't you call the Chief Justice<eos> - and get them both in?<eos> - And so it begins.<eos> Actually, it really does.
Not exactly.<eos> The bad news is the main cash flow is buried behind a continuously evolving code wall.<eos> - English.<eos> - Pretend that the code is... a door.<eos> Now, we manage to jimmy the lock but, before we can get the door open, another door with an even better lock slams shut behind it.<eos> So what's the good news?<eos> Well, I thought that he may be working with a partner so, I kept looking.<eos> What I found was a secondary stream in the cash-flow, only this account path had a small flaw in the code and I was able to crack it.<eos> Do you have the account holder's name?<eos> I do.
You should go home.<eos> - I'm a gypsy and we?<eos> - You don't have a home.<eos> He's working, eh?<eos> You've got a few tricks to learn, Alex Hugo.<eos> Like the decor?<eos> Sorry, I knocked?<eos> I didn't want to answer.<eos> My husband just died, you know?<eos> But of course you do.
I'll get the truth and you get the prize.<eos> The truth or your truth?<eos> Work with me, Wacquier, you won't regret it.<eos> You're a good cop who looks below the surface like the ones hanging above the stairs.<eos> What is this shit?<eos> 1:00 am.<eos> Don't you have a life?<eos> Do you know this guy?<eos> Commander Hugo?<eos> All the older guys do.
I totally don't have to hit that. I mean, she's nice and all, but you're my bro.<eos> Yeah, it is...<eos> So this is the new digs, huh?<eos> Uhhuh. Yeah.<eos> - Yeah. Nice and clean.<eos> - It's, you know-- it's temporary until I figure out- yeah.<eos> It's great.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Your kids are-- they like it?<eos> - Yeah, they do, they...
She should.<eos> Very sensitive kid.<eos> Rough day, huh?<eos> Yeah. Not one of my best.<eos> Thought it'd be classier if I got boozy out on the porch instead of inside.<eos> Listen, goose, I want--<eos> I want to talk to you about our selling the house.<eos> I just want you to understand my point of view, my feelings about it.<eos> I'm mom, I-I get it.<eos> I do.
- Whoo!<eos> - I can't use it next week.<eos> I'm booked too solid.<eos> - Great. - Ouch.<eos> - Bag of poop for you.<eos> Sorry about that.<eos> Put in your piggies.<eos> Put your piggies in. Look at this pretty girl.<eos> Did you mean it when you said to your mom that Jabbar's baptism was one of the greatest moments of your life?<eos> I did.

But nobody can know about that base, So who knows what really happened?<eos> Maybe some contra went nuts.<eos> Lisa: Today was a shitty day, With my shitty kids and my shitty husband.<eos> I love them. I do.<eos> But damn, they get on my nerves.<eos> I wanted to --<eos> Everyone knows what I want to do --<eos> Then I remember the last drink that got me here 2 years, 1 month, 10 days ago.<eos> I don't even have to say it. But...<eos> And I didn't, and...
The best thing you can do for her Is find a way to deal with your anger.<eos> I'm not here to be saved --<eos> Not by you, tim...<eos> Or your god.<eos> I see that you're in pain, mr.<eos> Jennings.<eos> There is grace and forgiveness for you.<eos> For everyone.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> - She's totally right.<eos> - She's obviously wrong.<eos> Hey, great news.<eos> The air-conditioning repairman is coming on Thursday.<eos> - Why?<eos> - To fix the air-conditioning.<eos> Honey, it's not broken.<eos> You just don't know how to set it.<eos> - Yes, I do.

You really think you know me, don't you?<eos> You don't.<eos> I know you used to be an artist.<eos> - And I know you've got a booth at the Art Walk that's currently sitting empty, and I know that Stefano Leone will be disappointed.<eos> Stefano Leone's gonna be there?<eos> I set it up back when we were dating.<eos> I, uh, wanted it to be a surprise.<eos> Patrick...<eos> I wanted good things for you, and -- call me crazy --<eos> Mm, I still do.
I won't go into the details here.<eos> Today is about you and your work, all right?<eos> I finally remember what I did during my blackouts.<eos> It's all because of that one memory.<eos> That's why I was sabotaging everything.<eos> Because you didn't think he was worth it.<eos> With everything that happened with my father, I understand.<eos> You're the only person who knew how to save me.<eos> - I'm not sure I deserve it.<eos> - You do.
Out here in the Middle, we're not caviar, champagne, or theater people.<eos> We like pretzels, beer, and TV.<eos> 36 salt specks.<eos> You count the number of salt specks?<eos> You don't count?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
Hey.<eos> Oh, hey, you made it.<eos> Yeah, barely.<eos> Uh, uh, one second. Before we, uh... How... how you doing?<eos> I'm good.<eos> How are you? So, are we... are we... are we cool?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Do you want to... talk about it, or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?
How are you? So, are we... are we... are we cool?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Do you want to... talk about it, or...<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you?<eos> - Well, I just... - You want to talk about? I-I didn't want there to be any, um... awkward, lingering...<eos> All right, well, I just want to say that, uh... um...<eos> - Yeah. Just... I...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you, uh...
I get it.<eos> Did he laugh at you?<eos> Call you a pussy?<eos> Oh, here we...<eos> Did he tell you that your wife wouldn't be pulling a train at 30,000 feet with him and half his other employees if you knew how to actually satisfy a woman?<eos> So then that night, you're feeling like a spineless piece of shit, so you do what any cat in your shoes would do.<eos> You reclaim your manhood, and you go... you take care of the woman that did you wrong.<eos> - No! - You slipped out of Joni's.<eos> You went over to Cindy's. You broke her neck, right?<eos> No, I didn't...
This is Damien, and this is Aaron.<eos> Screw this.<eos> Bloom, just give me one second.<eos> You are a son of a bitch.<eos> Hey, it's not like that, Captain.<eos> Oh, Captain! Captain.<eos> Aren't you cute?<eos> You can mail me my wallet.<eos> We didn't know what happened to you, Bloom.<eos> Now you do.
- Got her?<eos> - Here.<eos> Got her.<eos> Call out!<eos> Gabby?<eos> Call out!<eos> - Hey! Dr. Arata, right? - Yeah.<eos> Did Gabby Dawson come in here?<eos> Did you seen her?<eos> Dawson... I did.
I don't know.<eos> - All right, never mind on the hot - Air balloon idea.<eos> I got a lot more where that came from.<eos> [Phone chimes] Hey, did you figure out what to do with Dawson's dad?<eos> Yeah. I did.<eos> Hey, thanks for coming by, Antonio.<eos> You didn't have to rush over here.<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> When you said this was on the sly, I figured out right away what you're up to.<eos> - You did?
What, like a "drink" drink?<eos> You go on dates with failures?<eos> - Constantly.<eos> - OK.<eos> - Uh... bye.<eos> OK.<eos> - Bye.<eos> You have any weapons or drugs on your person at this time?<eos> Why, yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you have to be so disruptive? !<eos> Do you?<eos> !<eos> People come here to try to learn to cope and all you do is undermine it!<eos> Stop.<eos> Fuck him and fuck this place!<eos> Nobody talks to me like that, it's bullshit!<eos> I'm not coming here any more, I'm done with therapy.<eos> Liam, you don't mean that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Please, just stop it.<eos> It's everyone's fault.<eos> Mainly Izzy's.<eos> I beg your pardon?<eos> You know what, Chop, I'll tell you why I kissed Peter.<eos> Because I was upset and disappointed with you for what you did to Archie.<eos> You let them boys kick him off the football team and call him horrible names and be mean to him.<eos> Yeah? What those boys done.<eos> I didn't do it.<eos> Yeah, you didn't DO anything.
You're here for the job?<eos> I think I am.<eos> You?<eos> Yup.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What did you think of me when you first met me?<eos> Is this about your speech, or more procrastinating?<eos> Speech.<eos> I liked you.<eos> You did not.
The whole town together with its 30,000 residents is the patch.<eos> One of us gets caught, he'll take everyone down with him.<eos> Journalists will come, and up in smoke we go.<eos> I'm all clean.<eos> I've had inspections already.<eos> Crime detection rate was within norm.<eos> No drug addicts, no prostitutes at all.<eos> But you and Matyugin will be going up in smoke in his fire truck.<eos> Any more threats?<eos> What did you do with the prostitutes?
What's between us cannot be settled.<eos> Of course, it can.<eos> With a duel.<eos> - A duel?<eos> - Between gentlemen.<eos> Two pistols.<eos> Somewhere private.<eos> Choose Baker as your second and I'll select the most discreet man I know.<eos> - Yeah, I know what a duel is.<eos> - Of course you do.
- ...with two little complications...<eos> - You're pregnant.<eos> - Aw [bleep].<eos> - With twins.<eos> Are you thinking what I'm thinking?<eos> - ...and only one solution.<eos> - What?<eos> You want to split up twin sisters?<eos> You understand that children are not like monetary possessions.<eos> - I do not, your honor!
I begged you.<eos> I guess now that we got<eos> Chipp McCapp as our headliner,<eos> I can get rid of my awesome wish list.<eos> Yeah, those are long shots.<eos> "Bob Dylan's friends"?<eos> Well, I just thought maybe they could get Bob Dylan to come.<eos> Land Ho.<eos> God, I love them.<eos> Everybody does.
Sam's probably nearby, too.<eos> Quick, get in before he spots us.<eos> Vincent, I know you're trying to help, I do, but I can't let you get in the way.<eos> I have to track Xavier to Sam so that I can catch him in the act, so that I can arrest him, and Gabe can prosecute.<eos> Sam?<eos> Yes.<eos> What about Xavier?<eos> You know he's an innocent victim in all this, right?<eos> He's a person, too.<eos> No, of course I do...
I don't want to hurt you.<eos> No, you deserve to be happy, and I can't make you happy.<eos> No, that's not it.<eos> Catherine, I've made a lot of mistakes.<eos> I know.<eos> We both have.<eos> And Gabe is a good guy.<eos> He is.<eos> He really, you know, cares about you.<eos> He does.
- Yes, I am.<eos> I abandoned you just when you needed me most.<eos> I was never there for you.<eos> Leave it all on me.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> All you were ever trying to do was keep the family safe.<eos> That's all I was trying to do.<eos> I understand.<eos> I do.
No, no, no, no.<eos> That's because you caught me in the middle of my power pose.<eos> It helps me with my confidence.<eos> Not so much now.<eos> Damn, I never thought I'd see the day when a white girl gets fingered before the black housekeeper.<eos> All right, look, there's got to be another explanation.<eos> I totally trust my staff.<eos> Oh, that's what I love about you, Juju.<eos> You think everyone's so good and honest.<eos> - I do.

- No, I know that.<eos> I'm sorry, Stephanie.<eos> Will you let me say that to you, please?<eos> Okay? I am so sorry.<eos> I had no idea I was gonna do that.<eos> None.<eos> I thought I was...<eos> I told myself that I didn't want her, that April didn't want me, and you and I... w...<eos> - Steph, you are so...<eos> - Please don't.
You don't like it?<eos> The yellow and black is cool.<eos> - Really good.<eos> - Spot on.<eos> Get the fuck out of here.<eos> - A week?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - You don't know art.<eos> And you do?
[laughs] hi, jake!<eos> Vivian!<eos> [laughing]<eos> .<eos> Because of it being such an important one.<eos> You know that in ancient egypt,<eos> The peasants drank beer for breakfast? Well, that explains why all their buildings were crooked.<eos> Charles, can I see you in the bathroom for a second?<eos> I've got a mole on my back that needs a looking-at, And charles has eyes.<eos> I do.
Okay, that was so not my idea.<eos> Oh, but the rest of this was?<eos> Sir. In fairness...<eos> And you, detective Beckett, you know what a high-profile case this is.<eos> How could you allow this circus?<eos> Sir, given his fixation with the '70s, we figured that this would be an opportunity to let Harold Leone open up about his knowledge on Vincent Bianchi's murder.<eos> And did he?<eos> Well no, but...<eos> So, all this mess, this ridiculous display and you have nothing to show for it?<eos> Actually, sir, we do.
I mean, we thought he'd never notice.<eos> Everybody out.<eos> It's all a misunderstanding.<eos> It's not a misunderstanding.<eos> We'll be laughing about this in 24 hours.<eos> Gordon, you're wrong.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Did you know about this?<eos> - I didn't know anything about this.<eos> Yes, you did.
No one gets away this time.<eos> Copy.<eos> There's over 900 bucks here.<eos> Yeah. Should be enough to lay low till we can make the move to the mainland.<eos> We got to ditch this car, get off the road.<eos> Gonna be lots of cops out there looking for us, you know?<eos> Were you scared?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I was.<eos> I'm just glad the clerk didn't get stupid.<eos> And what if he did?
Wow, so at least we know that we're gonna be safe if we ever happened to be attacked by toy pigs.<eos> Let me ask you something, Mel.<eos> How do you plan to care for this completely untrained animal when you're down in city hall all day doing...<eos> Whatever the hell it is you do down there?<eos> Okay, now you're just finding problems that don't exist.<eos> There are dog-sitters on every street corner just waiting to be called.<eos> Those are homeless people.<eos> There are teenagers in this neighborhood that would pay me to look after an adorable dog like Wendell.<eos> - We'll find somebody.<eos> - Yeah, and what if we don't?
I bet you never had that.<eos> Sounds fucking disgusting.<eos> You... Are gonna eat it and like it.<eos> Look, Hol, I...<eos> I might be a little late tonight.<eos> How late?<eos> I... you can make that shit for me another night.<eos> Another night?<eos> You like having me around, huh?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You, miss.<eos> Did you know him?<eos> A wave hello, half a glass off him, no more.<eos> You are the draper's girl, Are you not?<eos> Your shop front out there.<eos> All this violence passed through, Your premises exempted.<eos> What can I say?<eos> Pretty dresses, aren't they?<eos> Beauty is its own best form of protection, they do say.<eos> Do they?

The thing itself in good time.<eos> For now, a sample.<eos> Those soldiers' tunics are red, if you have my meaning.<eos> And their deaths relate to all you would now elaborate upon.<eos> Something else for you, too, Mr. Best.<eos> Its purpose will get clearer, but, for now, I entrust it to you for safekeeping.<eos> Until we next meet, however, you heed some advice...<eos> This dance you join, it is a deadly one, so, you go now to your place of work, you take what you need, and you do not return.<eos> You do not take a step without that.<eos> You do so in caution.
They promised.<eos> Who promised you your own room?<eos> The TV people.<eos> The TV host told all of us that if we went on his show,<eos> - we'd get our own rooms.<eos> - He promised.<eos> And what happens to people who break their promises?<eos> They get in trouble.<eos> That's right, Daisy.<eos> They do.
What do you think?<eos> You can't kill me, Rumple.<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> She gave it to Belle.<eos> And she wants me dead.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> Well, then, you'll have to do what she wishes.<eos> If she has the dagger, you have no choice.<eos> If she has the dagger.<eos> But she doesn't.
Mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> We do.<eos> - That sounds great.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Yeah. I love to watch kids swim.<eos> I'm really glad we didn't invite them to our house.<eos> - I like our house.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> No, I don't.
Well, maybe you should just get a whore.<eos> I think one of my old roommates is an actual whore.<eos> She was cute.<eos> She's probably ruined in her area,<eos> - but she is a... whore.<eos> - I don't... it's not...<eos> - I don't want a whore.<eos> - I wish Greg would give<eos> - me permission to bang a stranger.<eos> - No, you do not.

Just call up Harvard and ask for a copy of his transcript.<eos> Professor Gerard's legal ethics class, did you ever hear of anybody ever getting an A-plus?<eos> No, he's famous for never giving higher than an "A."<eos> Well, what are you so happy about?<eos> I made bubble-wrap slippers this morning while you were in the shower.<eos> I specifically told you the bubble wrap is for the dishes.<eos> I also made a hat.<eos> Okay, I'm moving in with a ten-year-old.<eos> And you love me.<eos> [Laughs] I do.
We worked it out about the buy-in.<eos> And this is gonna un-work it out.<eos> You know, it's funny.<eos> First it was too generic.<eos> Now it's special.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> I don't think you have a problem with my choice of gift.<eos> I think you have a problem with my choice of recipient.<eos> Do you think Scottie would even be here if it wasn't for me?<eos> No, I don't.
I am letting you evaluate the offer.<eos> You sent this letter to kill the deal.<eos> I sent that letter to buy you time.<eos> Jessica, you put my name on a document you knew I wouldn't support.<eos> You are on Lisa's side.<eos> You want to sell.<eos> This isn't about Lisa, and I don't give a shit whether this company is sold or not.<eos> This is about you and me and how we're going to run this firm.<eos> Didn't we just have a conversation about that?<eos> Yeah, we sure did.
- Not particularly.<eos> You're saying I should trust him.<eos> I'm saying I do.<eos> I'd ask how you're holding up, but I can see the answer.<eos> [Sighs]<eos> Not well.<eos> I can only imagine what these last couple of days have been like for you.<eos> But I'm telling you, it's gonna be okay.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
Well, maybe you didn't have him sign it, but I know when he signed it, and it's not gonna hold up.<eos> It'll hold up just fine.<eos> We'll see.<eos> This is a subpoena.<eos> So the next time we have this conversation, you'll be under oath.<eos> What exactly is he claiming?<eos> He's saying Quentin wasn't competent when he made me executor.<eos> So let him say it.<eos> I don't see where there's a problem.<eos> Yes, you do.

- Me.<eos> Friend?<eos> Louis, I may not ever say it, but that's not because we aren't.<eos> We are.<eos> You know it.<eos> I know it.<eos> I just don't like to say it.<eos> Last time I asked you, you said, "don't push it."<eos> You knew I meant yes.<eos> I did.
Louis, I know you value the letter of the law, but what about its spirit?<eos> Because Mike embodies that spirit more than either one of us.<eos> You said we're friends.<eos> A friend would not ask me to do this.<eos> No, Louis.<eos> A friend just won't hold it against you if you don't.<eos> [Soft rock music]<eos> ♪<eos> Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I do.
No, not. Well, then I guess we better get you one.<eos> So you are rainbow boy now?<eos> The fuck you do to your hair?<eos> You wear pink sweaters and stink of man perfume now?<eos> I look shitty in pink.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> You like the penis, yes?<eos> Not when there's tits directly above it.<eos> You want it up in your poop place?<eos> No, I don't...
- That's great!<eos> That's exactly what you wanted.<eos> How did you do that?<eos> Well, Daniel and I came up with a plan.<eos> My father didn't know what hit him.<eos> Are you sure he has your best interests at heart?<eos> I couldn't have gotten my magazine back without him.<eos> He's not the bad person you think he is.<eos> - You don't know him.<eos> - Yes, I do, Jack.
I hated you for leaving me.<eos> But now I realize that I drove you away.<eos> I loved you, Steph.<eos> We had our demons -- maybe I still have mine -- but we had some...<eos> Very good years before they took over.<eos> I know.<eos> I regret having involved you in my affairs yet again.<eos> If there was any way I could extricate you from this new battle with Victoria, I would.<eos> No good can come of it.<eos> Two good things did --
Just so you know, I'm not seeing anyone else.<eos> Well, me, neither.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> (laughs)<eos> Please.<eos> So, uh... you...<eos> you have tattoos?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't.
Okay.<eos> Cool.<eos> So is that it?<eos> Are... are we engaged?<eos> Yeah, I think so.<eos> All right.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> Just... feels a little anticlimactic.<eos> Yeah, it kind of does, huh?
You've seen Freaky Friday, sometimes little kids end up in big person bodies.<eos> Leonard, we can't protect him forever.<eos> I know, but...<eos> He'll be okay.<eos> You taught him well, Padawan.<eos> Good Lord!<eos> Padawan's the student, not the teacher.<eos> Seriously, let him go.<eos> Sheldon, if you really need to do this, I'm not gonna stand in your way.<eos> I do.
- You were chasing me.<eos> - The sauce-- is it a remoulade or--<eos> Oh, cool it with the innocent routine, buster!<eos> [ Bowl clatters ] That's gonna stain.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey, Grayson. I'm a suspect.<eos> They're interrogating me.<eos> You never responded to my text about sponsoring my softball team.<eos> I don't think I got that text.<eos> Yes, you did, honey.
You know, I can't tell him about the...<eos> Verrat... whatever it is you call them.<eos> He's a Grimm.<eos> He'll understand. Well, I wish I did.<eos> Open the trunk, and get me the book on top.<eos> - Dad.<eos> I don't see why this is gonna help.<eos> Show him this.<eos> If he's who I think he is, he'll come.<eos> And if he doesn't?
You know, why does she have to do this?<eos> Of all the men in the world, why does she have to cheat with my husband?<eos> - I know this is hard for you...<eos> - Henry is all I have.<eos> Now Amy?<eos> She can have any guy she wants.<eos> Always could.<eos> Our whole lives.<eos> Yeah, that sucks.<eos> Okay, it really does.

What if Hannah is right about Vernon?<eos> If she can prove it, I'll come and find you.<eos> And if she can't?<eos> I'll find Vernon Greg.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> You'd hang.<eos> Go to Lancaster.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> Yes, you do.
- Jess:<eos> No. She's pregnant?<eos> Shepard: She's pregnant.<eos> She and her boyfriend are gonna take the kid.<eos> They're gonna raise the kid in Iowa.<eos> So they're going to Iowa.<eos> - Jess: That's gonna ruin her career.<eos> - Shepard: What do you want me to do?<eos> Jess: Oh, my God, you know what you need to do.<eos> Shepard: No, I don't.
Shepard: No, I don't.<eos> I don't know what I need to do.<eos> Jess: Tell her to get rid of it.<eos> Shepard:<eos> The baby. Get rid of the...<eos> That's what I should tell her?<eos> Jess: Yeah, look at how happy you are.<eos> You love working with this girl.<eos> - Shepard: I didn't love it.<eos> - Jess: Yes, you did,
Jess: Aw. Your daddy's a good man.<eos> But he didn't want our meal ticket to get an abortion.<eos> Isn't that right, daddy?<eos> - Shepard: Stop.<eos> - Jess: What?<eos> That's what happened.<eos> Shepard: What, are you mad?<eos> Jess: You can't make people do things that they don't want to do, right?<eos> Shepard: And I really don't want to be managing some kid.<eos> I don't.
I, uh... asked Roxanne to come, but she's at a women's apparel event at Newport beach, and it's kind of strange that... this was her suggestion in the first place, for me to come here...<eos> Maybe we should focus on the people who are here.<eos> My guy. - I'll go. I'll go first.<eos> I want to. - Actually, AJ, I would love to go first,<eos> - because we're kind of in a rush.<eos> - No, we're not, actually.<eos> We are. I'm sorry...<eos> Jess can go first if she wants to go first.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I do, I do. - Of course you do.
- Meaning that your husband eats dinner alone every night with the nanny, and your son only speaks spanish.<eos> Uh... spanish,<eos> - it's a beautiful language, Spanish.<eos> - I wish I knew how to speak spanish.<eos> You should come down to Costa Rica with us and then we could all speak spanish.<eos> Just let it go, man.<eos> She's not gonna want to bang you in Costa Rica, either...<eos> - she flat... out does not want to do it.<eos> - I think you can stop now.<eos> - And she doesn't even...
Let's go.<eos> This would be a great honor if we were Sumerian.<eos> Why do you think kings are buried this deep underground?<eos> Sumerian kings.<eos> We're facing death, and you trot out Sumerian kings?<eos> Well, they're a damn sight more interesting - than British kings. - Mm.<eos> Yeah, all right.<eos> He's interesting.<eos> Depends... whether you find mental illness intriguing or not.<eos> I do.
- what would you do?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> You want to be mayor again.<eos> I'm helping, whispering in his ear, steering him.<eos> It's enough.<eos> Nothing is ever enough for Amanda Rosewater.<eos> Oh, no, come on. That's not true.<eos> You love being the boss.<eos> - I don't love being the boss.<eos> - Yes, you do. - You totally do, yes.
I look forward to seeing you in the field, sir.<eos> What's Barbie Doll doing here?<eos> Envisioning 12 ways I can kick your caveman ass.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Where's Irisa?<eos> I thought she could stay behind.<eos> She and Berlin don't get along so well.<eos> I figured we could minimize the drama.<eos> Irisa has value.<eos> Your girlfriend does not.
Irisa.<eos> I love you.<eos> More than anyone I've ever loved in my life.<eos> And I don't ever want to spend any time apart from you.<eos> I wanna make you my wife. And I wanna be your husband.<eos> Why?<eos> Because that's what you do.<eos> When you love someone, and you know they're the one, you make a commitment. Forever.<eos> You don't want to marry me.<eos> Yes, I do. With all my heart.
- YES, FAVI DATAK.<eos> WELCOME HOME.<eos> - WHERE IS MY WIFE?<eos> - SHE'S ENTERTAINING FAVI CHRISTIE'S MOTHER.<eos> - IF YOU THINK I'M GONNA LET SOME SNOOTY SHANJE STICK INSECT RAISE MY FAMILY, YOU ARE CRAZY.<eos> - YOU GAVE UP ANY CLAIM TO PARENTING WHEN YOU LEFT DEFIANCE.<eos> - IS THERE A PROBLEM? - DATAK.<eos> WELCOME HOME, MY LOVE.<eos> YOU REMEMBER PILAR, RAFE'S WIFE.<eos> - I DO.
- Andy, come on!<eos> - Ah!<eos> See?<eos> Oh!<eos> - Not cool, man.<eos> - Not him, not that Kyle.<eos> Okay, we are going to have a doctor's appointment, and then after that, we can probably tell people.<eos> So just hang in there, please.<eos> I can do this.<eos> People do this.
Come on, Katy, we can't just leave him.<eos> It's stopped.<eos> Maybe he's all right.<eos> Yeah, it's either that or he's died.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Come on then.<eos> Stay with me.<eos> Look at this.<eos> If she was in school uniform, she'd look like you.<eos> Don't, Shell.
It's 'cause of her we have bedtimes!<eos> Chris, come on, we're going home!<eos> He can't make you do this.<eos> But, Mom, I wantto do this.<eos> What?<eos> I know he's marrying me for my money, but I don't care.<eos> Dad and I spent more time together planning this wedding than we ever have before.<eos> And if being married means I get to spend even more time with my dad, then it's worth it.<eos> Wait. You knew all along I just wanted you for your money?<eos> Yeah, Dad, I did.
And I think that's what she felt and I think it terrified her.<eos> So the way that she decided that she would face it was to fight to the last breath.<eos> Fight, fight, every moment.<eos> I guess I'm a little like Susan in that I always thought she would survive, too.<eos> She had this transplant in the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle.<eos> And when the doctors came to tell her it hadn't worked, she started to scream.<eos> LEIBOVITZ: I went to Seattle to bring her home in an air ambulance.<eos> It was really a harrowing experience.<eos> She then returned to Sloan-Kettering because it was over, and she was being sent there to die.<eos> Um...and she did.
Oh, hi, Dr. Sam.<eos> Will said you'd be here, and I wanted to be the first to greet you.<eos> You should know that our doors are always open to you.<eos> Thank you, Marcus.<eos> You're an excellent greeter.<eos> So did you save any lives today?<eos> I bet you did.<eos> I think you have the coolest job ever.<eos> Did you know one of my real-life dreams was to ride in an ambulance?<eos> I didn't, but...
I just want to know how long it's gonna take.<eos> Oh, so now you want answers.<eos> What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Come on, you started it, what does that mean?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I sent you flowers.<eos> We spent the night in a hotel together, but you act like nothing ever happened and I don't like it.<eos> You don't. No, I don't.
Protect?<eos> I don't need you to protect me from anything.<eos> I'm sorry, that's not what I meant.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> Be honest.<eos> Okay, you want honesty?<eos> You may think that Vincent has changed, you may even believe that he actually has, but I used to be what he is, and I know sooner or later, he is going to hurt you...<eos> Gabe and you will be sorry! Gabe, please.<eos> The only thing I am sorry about is that things didn't work out between us, because I cared about you.<eos> I still do.
Dirty cereal bowls in the sink aren't gonna exactly tip the scales.<eos> Well, now that he's in the conversation, I'll make sure to clean the bowls tonight.<eos> Your mother.<eos> Your mother.<eos> She does not look happy.<eos> Come on. It'll-it'll be fine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - All right.<eos> But y-y-you told her, right?<eos> Her? I did.
It is!<eos> What?<eos> Look at it, Murphy.<eos> It's glorious.<eos> It's a mass.<eos> I-it's a massive mass, but...<eos> Okay, so, we're gonna need a 3-D reconstruction and, um...<eos> Hey, Dr. Bailey. Hey, do you have the labs on the... um...<eos> - I said, "tell no one"!<eos> - I didn't!
She just... she just looks at me and sees who I am and how I feel...<eos> and accepts it.<eos> You know, she doesn't try to change it, doesn't want to change it.<eos> That person.<eos> There's a billion people out there.<eos> But I imagine... there's only one her.<eos> I am happy to sign the document.<eos> That's wonderful.<eos> I don't have a pen.<eos> No, sweetheart, you don't...
She laughs.<eos> And then she says,<eos> "you know, you're not half the man your brother is."<eos> Then I hear this sound.<eos> So, um...<eos> I run downstairs, and, uh, there's chazz.<eos> And he's got the hammer.<eos> And he looks up at me and says,<eos> "oh, jeez, lester.<eos> What did I..."
You're not gonna believe this.<eos> I'm packed.<eos> I'm totally packed.<eos> I even bought one of those mini travel toothpastes, which is already in my toiletry bag.<eos> Old people brag about the weirdest things.<eos> No, you know, last night, your dad and I were talking, and we realized that every time we take a trip, the same thing happens, right, Mike?<eos> Back, cry, forget, snark, fight.<eos> And nobody likes that.<eos> Do you like that?<eos> No. Nobody does.
See?<eos> Here it is.<eos> We'll just take that deposit and be out of your way.<eos> Uh-huh. And you wouldn't just drag in a desk from the room across the hall, would you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Really?<eos> 'Cause there might be a number under each desk that matches the room it belongs to, so I could easily find out.<eos> I think you're bluffing.<eos> I don't think there really is a number.<eos> You don't?
That is incorrect.<eos> And we're down to our final two.<eos> I told you.<eos> This is Brick's year.<eos> Look at him up there.<eos> He's got the eye of the tiger.<eos> Your word is... succedaneum.<eos> We got this.<eos> He knows this one.<eos> He does? He does?
No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> I'm so perturbed!<eos> So, how was school?<eos> Things getting better with that math teacher?<eos> It wasn't so bad today.<eos> Oh, by the way, you were right about the park thing.<eos> Piper's parents thought it was weird that you wanted to meet her there, too.<eos> I didn't.
You go near my family or threaten them again, I'll fucking kill you.<eos> You understand?<eos> Who the fuck is Catherine Shaughnessy?<eos> No one you need to worry about.<eos> Then why is The Boston Globe's Lois Lane asking me questions about her?<eos> She was Sully's girlfriend.<eos> Where is she now?<eos> Aw, Jesus, here we go again.<eos> You don't want to know.<eos> Oh, but I really do.
I don't care.<eos> What's the address?<eos> Look, if Pop and Sully had ever met, I'm sure I'd have known about it.<eos> Sounds like you two are close.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> He's my father.<eos> Well, if there's any way I could talk to him, even if there's one Sully story, I'd like to hear it.<eos> He's a tired old con.<eos> Sure, he made a lot of stupid mistakes, but he paid for 'em.<eos> We all did.
What was in the box?<eos> Um, his... skateboard tools and stuff.<eos> At least, that's what he said.<eos> But you didn't believe him.<eos> It's just, when he came to get it, he acted kind of strange.<eos> He noticed some tape had come loose on the box, and... he freaked out.<eos> He made me swear I hadn't opened it.<eos> Holly, do you have any idea what was in that box?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I really don't.
I'm not... you know what?<eos> I don't owe you an explanation.<eos> I have a girlfriend who I just took to Paris.<eos> There were hands in the pants at the Louvre, and that's all you need to know.<eos> Mr. Mansfield.<eos> Brody!<eos> What's up, man?<eos> Does Mansfield know you're using his office?<eos> Does Mansfield know I'm using his office?<eos> No, he does not.
Can I say something?<eos> You're not here to train me.<eos> I know what I'm doing.<eos> I know how to handle people.<eos> So you can keep your brooding, assaholic, big city cop act to yourself.<eos> Sir.<eos> Potato chips?<eos> Why don't we have any potato chips in this house?<eos> You don't want potato chips.<eos> No, I do.
It's like he was in a boat or he was put in a boat.<eos> I don't know why.<eos> Who's telling you this?<eos> Where'd you get this from?<eos> Danny.<eos> So, tell me about Gracepoint.<eos> Well, it's the only town for 20 Miles, one road in, one road out.<eos> People come for whale-watching season, tourists, and then again the summer, but basically, we're just a working town.<eos> We've never had a murder here.<eos> I do a weekly crime report in the journal, so...
- It was amazing!<eos> - Yeah, it was great.<eos> I should've called you.<eos> Yeah, dad said it took him three weeks to get up his first time, and I got up on my first day.<eos> - Mm. - It was amazing.<eos> - How was your schoolwork?<eos> - It's done. - Dad said, "screw cedar knoll."<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did he?
Right.<eos> He really got up?<eos> Yeah, he did.<eos> That's kind of awesome.<eos> - It's a good thing.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah. - Did you really say,<eos> "screw cedar knoll"?<eos> - I need to rinse off my--<eos> - You did.
Fine!<eos> You win! Tell charles.<eos> Hold me close, little wolfie.<eos> Hold me.<eos> (jake) all right, convict.<eos> What do you know about the murder of nate dexter?<eos> Look, I'll tell you the same thing...<eos> I told you eight years ago.<eos> I don't know anything about nate dexter.<eos> And even if I did...
Why?<eos> Do you know something I don't?<eos> Well, just that my mother said he wants to leave tonight on the first of many vacations with her.<eos> If Pascal stops running the day-to-day at LeMarchal, it could create a power vacuum back in Paris.<eos> Where Gideon can sweep in and take advantage.<eos> We are about to launch a product that will fundamentally alter the landscape of this company.<eos> So why shouldn't your father commit to you before your brother has a chance to change his mind?<eos> Are you sure this is the right address?<eos> County Registrar's office said there's no Kurt Renner or anyone living here.<eos> Well, someone does.
What do you mean?<eos> You think she's trying to manipulate me-- is that it?<eos> I love her, D.B.<eos> I have to trust her.<eos> She's all I got.<eos> And I want to be there for her, I mean, really be there.<eos> Help her out, the way any father would.<eos> Good for you.<eos> And I hope it works out.<eos> I really do.
I just don't want to live there forever.<eos> You need to take Bracken down...<eos> same as we do.<eos> There has to be a way.<eos> Yes, and I thought I'd found it.<eos> I got to one of Bracken's men.<eos> He told me there was something that the senator was afraid of... a recording made by a former associate to protect himself.<eos> A recording in which Bracken admits to murder.<eos> Do you know where it is?<eos> No, and neither does Bracken.
Whoa, some spread, huh?<eos> Mm-mm-mmm, celery.<eos> ♪ balle balle<eos> I think I just saw an alien on a unicycle, swinging a sword.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> I saw that, too.<eos> I bet their kids don't reject them.<eos> Those guys know how to have fun.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, they do.

He's already getting in your head right now.<eos> I assume it's like a big warehouse, just filled with hundreds of faceless girls, posters of Fonzie.<eos> Hell, I bet, uh, yoga girl's already in there.<eos> You tell that cheating bitch I said hi.<eos> All right, now.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Okay. We are going.<eos> This week, Burski dies.<eos> No, he doesn't.
He's using it against you to try to make you stumble.<eos> Possibly.<eos> You know, if Claire is alive, then she's sending me a message, and she will be at the inn in Ware County, where I proposed to her, where we wrote that poem.<eos> Do you know how ludicrous that sounds?<eos> What's waiting there, if anything, is a trap.<eos> That's all this can be, Joe.<eos> It's a trick.<eos> Is it?<eos> Is it really so hard to believe that she could fake her death?<eos> I did.
Is that what I taught you?<eos> To run and hide?<eos> People there... people there hate us.<eos> When you're desperate, you lash out.<eos> And if things were reversed and I was still there and someone else had lucked into all of this, I would hope that I would not believe rumors.<eos> Tonight, Bay and I...<eos> Bay and you, what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just don't want to lose you.<eos> And neither does Bay.
Luke may still change his mind.<eos> And just because we lost the Taylors doesn't mean there's not another great couple out there.<eos> I wanted them.<eos> You sure?<eos> He's kind of weird.<eos> Yeah, but he's cool weird.<eos> And she's, like, the best mom you could ever ask for.<eos> Okay, I'm just gonna let that go.<eos> - You know what I mean.<eos> - I do.
What he wants-- what he really wants-- has nothing to do with you.<eos> Don't you look ready to rumble?<eos> We're not.<eos> We want to take your deal, with one small change.<eos> - I'm not lowering the amount.<eos> - No, don't worry.<eos> Instead of $10 million, we'd like to give you 100 million.<eos> Because that would still cost us less than if we fought you and you got this.<eos> - I have no idea what that is.<eos> - Yes, you do.
I do operate that way, Louis, but not with my friends.<eos> So I'm only gonna ask you this once.<eos> So be it.<eos> - Are you mad?<eos> - I'm disappointed.<eos> Harvey, I--<eos> You can't have it both ways, Louis.<eos> The furniture came.<eos> Look, I know we said that we'd go with all my choices, but it turns out you have got pretty good taste.<eos> Yes. Yes, I do.
What, you just reverse and hope?<eos> Where did you think I was? ! All day, I have been behind you.<eos> I didn't think you were that close behind me.<eos> I now know why they have those stickers for lorry drivers -<eos> "If you can't see my mirrors, I can't see you."<eos> 'Even though the incident had been technically my fault, 'I still followed the standard procedure.'<eos> What? He knows the rules.<eos> Live by the sword, you must...<eos> I can't remember. Whatever.<eos> Something to do with swords.
We were partners when I first came up.<eos> Me and Jimmy worked the gang unit together with Alvin.<eos> Ivory tower recognized he'd be better served working undercover in Chinatown.<eos> Yeah, perfect place for him.<eos> He's got his own Vice squad now... all Chinese cops.<eos> All I can tell you is he was dressed like the guys in the video, and he was looking awfully cranked.<eos> So why don't we put a tail on him, see what's what?<eos> - 'Cause it ain't him.<eos> - How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
I'll see you later.<eos> Bad time?<eos> No contact... that was our agreement.<eos> When exactly do you intend to keep up your end of the deal?<eos> When I'm finished.<eos> You were almost killed after a marriage I can only imagine was supposed to have a very different honeymoon.<eos> I could have been stuck in here forever, spotting a guy named little shiv on the bench press.<eos> I want to renegotiate.<eos> You have no leverage.<eos> Ah but I do.
Sir?<eos> That's all.<eos> Uh, in looking into Stealth, I discovered a computer program they use called Echo.<eos> I think it's a real weak spot-- something the Soviets might try to go after.<eos> So I'm gonna look into it, see if I can shore up their security.<eos> Great.<eos> Echo, it's called.<eos> I don't really understand it.<eos> Computer stuff.<eos> Who does?
Understood?<eos> - We don't get high...<eos> - Understood?<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> Dude, do not Instagram that.<eos> The cops can trace that shit.<eos> You're gonna get busted, Jill.<eos> Your dad already knows you took it.<eos> - Did you tell him I took it? - No.<eos> But he does.
We had this huge fight.<eos> And then I just left him all alone.<eos> If you'd been with him, he would've done the same thing.<eos> I want to kill whoever did this to him.<eos> Don't say that, Sam.<eos> You don't mean that.<eos> I just wish he could hear me.<eos> So I could tell him I was here.<eos> He knows we're here.<eos> He does.
Well, let's go arrest this guy.<eos> What are we doing?<eos> Not so fast, McGruff.<eos> He hasn't committed a crime yet, but he's gonna-- trust me.<eos> Okay, how do you know that?<eos> That library in Dusseldorf was ancient.<eos> And the books inside it were period.<eos> The paper in those books-- 75% cotton, 25% ultrafine linen.<eos> You know what that means?<eos> I do.
Do we understand each other?<eos> Well, why don't I let you two talk?<eos> So... you want my endorsement?<eos> Actually I was told that you had had a change of heart.<eos> So, what does this do?<eos> Peter thinks Castro wants the meeting.<eos> Castro thinks Peter wants the meeting.<eos> They're both prideful and...<eos> I want to learn your job.<eos> No, you don't.
Okay, bye.<eos> Oh, love to Eddie and Sydney, Spencer, Sophia, and Ryan.<eos> - Nailed it.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Hank.<eos> - Hey, Aaron.<eos> You want to hit?<eos> Uh, yeah, I just don't have a racket, sneakers, or talent.<eos> Give me one lesson, and you can start hustling on the doctor circuit.<eos> How about we do business first?
Uh, well, since my house is empty, I thought I would go there and catch up on work.<eos> Right. Um...<eos> Before you do...<eos> Jeremiah, I-I don't know if I ever thanked you for taking over and... and running Hankmed while I was gone.<eos> It... it was a great responsibility, which I-I took very seriously.<eos> I know.<eos> Last summer...<eos> We had our issues.<eos> Do you think we can ever get back to where we once were?<eos> - No, I don't. - Oh.
Why don't you just go do the show for those guys, and then we can simulcast it overseas?<eos> Well, it'd be hard to do in a hurry, and I don't know if I have a whole show in me, either.<eos> Well, I'd help.<eos> And, listen, we put the word out, I'm sure there are a ton of people in this town who would love to do it.<eos> Don't you have an album to launch?<eos> I do.<eos> But, you know, those guys are my fans, too.<eos> Come here.<eos> I can't stop thinking about you.<eos> Don't.
That's a no.<eos> We just cut the fabric into this shape and then...<eos> Leo, come on, we've got this.<eos> Go find your mother.<eos> Thank you.<eos> The Incas have clearly made no progress.<eos> There must be a clue somewhere.<eos> Mother!<eos> Tell me you heard that.<eos> I did.
Odile's one, my one and Claire's little one.<eos> Did you check her out?<eos> No, her reference left the country.<eos> She's lying, she has no references.<eos> Why say that?<eos> She looks honest.<eos> My one has brilliant references.<eos> Your one wants to declare 3,000 euros a month.<eos> That's twice what I earn!<eos> You do the job.
Listen, mate.<eos> Don't wait for me.<eos> Go to Brussels.<eos> Make the transfer there.<eos> Mr Halimi, please.<eos> It's useless.<eos> Mr Halimi, please.<eos> Did you hear?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You did?
♪ Because you're all that I<eos> Good-bye?<eos> Where are you going?<eos> I don't know where exactly.<eos> I just don't want you to throw away your life, okay?<eos> Oh, right, 'cause this is all for me?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Come on... - Vincent, it makes me responsible for this colossal mess.<eos> I don't know whether to kiss you or throw you off this roof.<eos> I do.
Previously on "Once Upon a Time"...<eos> I'm powerless.<eos> Regina's got my pendant.<eos> Want to meet your new uncle?<eos> I saw Regina take your dagger.<eos> - She gave it to Belle.<eos> - If she has the dagger, you'll have to do what she wishes.<eos> But she doesn't.
Rose brought the malum here behind my back to complete the grand rite without me.<eos> Whose idea was it to turn the puritans' hatred against themselves?<eos> To use them to achieve the first grand rite in centuries?<eos> Who made that possible?<eos> Me.<eos> Yet you and that foul bitch mistrusted me.<eos> And much worse for you, you underestimated me.<eos> But killing the Samhain, do you have any idea what you've done?<eos> The question is not whether I understand what I have done, but whether you understand what you must now do.<eos> I do.
It's the puppet that Dick Butkus made of Marty Weaver for his first Halloween-ween.<eos> Hey, Deb!<eos> Deb!<eos> Fantasy football!<eos> Deb!<eos> Deb!<eos> We're never going to see the Weavers again, are we?<eos> With the time change, they'll be dead by the time we back to Zabvron.<eos> I don't want to go, husband.<eos> I don't, either.
He didn't have to tell me about that reserve tank, but he did.<eos> Yesterday, we save his life, he can barely utter a "thank you."<eos> I think in some strange way, he tried.<eos> A few words does not change the fact that all he cares about is his folklore status.<eos> And he's not the only one fueling it.<eos> Rebecca's been... talking him up all over town.<eos> She's also the one who discovered the whole... crop problem in the first place.<eos> But a few science textbooks is not gonna solve what's happening here.<eos> She doesn't know everything about this dome.<eos> And we do?
It brought me comfort.<eos> The gravesite is where I felt closest to you.<eos> Brought you flowers every Sunday.<eos> Thank you, but...<eos> I realize it wasn't about you.<eos> It was about me.<eos> It was about healing.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.<eos> - But I do.
I'll work for Piron and just watch over them.<eos> Really?<eos> Huh.<eos> 'Cause from the outside, it seems like Alec bought you and put you on a leash.<eos> You're trying to provoke me.<eos> Why?<eos> I've got three crimes, all of them swept under the rug, all of them wearing Halo beta testing devices.<eos> That's not a coincidence.<eos> I'll talk to Alec about it.<eos> Kiera already did that.
McGee, where are you?<eos> Do you think it's possible we could've shaken these guys?<eos> No.<eos> Keep your eyes open.<eos> Oh, boss, I got a signal.<eos> These damn things won't let me shut 'em down.<eos> - It's even messing with our phones.<eos> - Got every available I.T. helping Ms. Sciuto, and not one of them knows what the hell it is.<eos> We know one I.T. who does.<eos> Or did.
I got a job offer, Harvey.<eos> Supposed to go have drinks to talk about it tonight.<eos> I can move it, it's just, that's... that's why I hesitated.<eos> - When?<eos> - When what?<eos> When'd you get the job offer?<eos> - The other night.<eos> - And you didn't mention it.<eos> I didn't know what I thought.<eos> - And now you do?
- A piece.<eos> - No.<eos> - No piece?<eos> No negotiating.<eos> Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.<eos> - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.
- No.<eos> - No piece?<eos> No negotiating.<eos> Look, I know what you're doing.<eos> You can't make up your mind, so you want me to make it up for you.<eos> But I don't want someone who's with me for the money.<eos> I want someone who's with me 'cause they want to kick some ass.<eos> - And if you want to take this job right now, I will negotiate in good faith.<eos> But you don't.<eos> I don't yet.
Thank you for your help, Rachel.<eos> I really appreciate it, but if you don't mind, I'd like to be alone.<eos> He's not here.<eos> Where is he?<eos> To tell you the truth, I don't know.<eos> All he said was he had a late night.<eos> - You're taking the job, aren't you?<eos> - I was just--<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yeah, you do.
Moving speech, truly, but nobody leaves until they go through orientation.<eos> Orientation?<eos> All right.<eos> Just gonna need you guys to answer a few questions. A few psychoanalytic, non-sequitur questions.<eos> A lie detector?<eos> The lie detector, Agent Coulson.<eos> This baby measures galvanic skin response, oxygen consumption, micro expressions, biofeedback brain waves, pupil dilation, voice biometrics. 96 variables in all.<eos> Fury designed this himself.<eos> He wanted a lie detector Romanoff couldn't beat.<eos> - Did she?
But there's still no rush on us being an "us."<eos> It's not like it's a good time to start anything.<eos> There's never a good time.<eos> We've gotta start somewhere.<eos> You better get going.<eos> Daniels will be here soon.<eos> It's okay. You'll be fine.<eos> Why don't you tell her the truth?<eos> That you're still alive? Sorry, it's just the way she talks about you sounds like you two had something nice.<eos> We did.
Where's our bus?<eos> And our team?<eos> It's so beautiful.<eos> So, are we off to Portland?<eos> Actually, Fitz thinks the 084 plasma ray we found in Peru might help.<eos> Didn't we jettison that to the sun?<eos> Yeah, but Fitz has the specs on it.<eos> - On the hard drive.<eos> You need me to decrypt the hard drive.<eos> The team does.
You're missing the point.<eos> I didn't want to just cross him off.<eos> I wanted to make a spectacle.<eos> People are killed by guns every day in Bogota.<eos> But how often does a monster punch a drug lord's head clean off?<eos> Hell, that's international news.<eos> Spectacular thing you did back there, Mikey.<eos> If I didn't know better, I'd swear you're starting to enjoy your job.<eos> You get the impression he's enjoying his job?<eos> Somebody does.
- And younger. - Usually younger.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - I told you we should have gone in.<eos> - Oh, hush.<eos> May looks barely a day over...<eos> 30. You're gorgeous.<eos> Score one for the Howling Commandos.<eos> Your grandpa's pin should help me locate Cybertek's mainframe.<eos> I didn't know they had wi-fi back in the day.<eos> They didn't.
Previously on "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> We should have seen Hydra coming.<eos> But they don't stand a chance.<eos> John Garrett does.
I really don't think you should go.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> I just wanted to come over and say congratulations and what a great guy he is and that I hope you'll both be very happy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause it's a lie.<eos> I was angry when I thought you were lying to me, so I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> I got to say something.<eos> No, you don't.
But I still needed to find distractions for my ever-present shadows.<eos> Gentlemen, please do not look, but that woman stirring the bowl over there seems to fancy one of you.<eos> I said don't look.<eos> - She's a pie-eater, that one. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Well, I 'll just be settling my cock to roost in that tonight.<eos> Not so fast.<eos> We said everra man for himself during the gathering.<eos> Aye, we did.<eos> But ye ken how much I fancy a hen with a bit of meat.<eos> Who doesn't?
- then move in.<eos> - Then we move in quick.<eos> Okay?<eos> As you can tell,<eos> Bembenek and his brother have no problem getting violent.<eos> All right?<eos> Hey, Lindsay, Lindsay...<eos> I know how you're feeling.<eos> Al...<eos> You don't.
One two three, lift.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Struggling to breathe.<eos> Sir, I'm gonna need you to calm down, okay?<eos> I need you to try and relax, all right?<eos> I need you to take slow, deep breaths.<eos> All right, pass me the kit.<eos> You know how to intubate a burn victim?<eos> I do.
- I don't know.<eos> - Come on. Let's go find him.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> I guess this place just gives me the creeps.<eos> Danny.<eos> We've been looking all over for you.<eos> You OK?<eos> Take a look at this picture and tell me if I should be.<eos> That guy kind of looks like Danny.<eos> Even some of the women do.
- Danny.<eos> - Come on, get off. Come on.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Listen, we need to leave right now.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> I'm home.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys can leave.<eos> Bryan and Jillian, they did.
- Come on, get off. Come on.<eos> - All right, all right.<eos> - Listen, we need to leave right now.<eos> Fuck that.<eos> I'm home.<eos> This is not your home.<eos> You know what?<eos> You guys can leave.<eos> Bryan and Jillian, they did.<eos> - Vic did. - What?
It's not really the problem right now!<eos> Since you seem to have one or two things in common with Bailey, what would get rid of you?<eos> Well, probably a single dad who works for tips and lives with a giant and a dwarf!<eos> But since that hasn't worked, I don't know!<eos> Great.<eos> So she's the mother of the mother of all crazies.<eos> That's it.<eos> You just have to out-crazy the crazy.<eos> - I think I know how to fix this.<eos> - You do?
- Yeah, no.<eos> - Not buying that one?<eos> No no no no.<eos> More...<eos> Mom, you are so pretty.<eos> Yeah, what else?<eos> - And sweet.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - Did I say sweet?<eos> - Yeah, you did.
Can you believe "Tuckles" was already taken?<eos> Can I interest you in either a snake or a hot dog?<eos> Oh, in a minute.<eos> I got a little unfinished business.<eos> Really?<eos> You couldn't have told me you changed your mind before I got on the subway like this?<eos> I realized I had to do it for Emma.<eos> Do you know how long it takes to explain to a transit cop why you've got a rubber chicken in your pants?<eos> Actually...<eos> I do.
Here. Will you just ask him these questions?<eos> I'm sorry. I got to get out of here.<eos> Riley, wait. What are you... come on!<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Yeah, ironically she just remembered that she left a cake in the oven.<eos> Aww, a girl after my own heart.<eos> You know, she reminds me of my little sister.<eos> Or your daughter?<eos> - I don't have one.<eos> - But what if you did?

Well, chalets ...<eos> You m'sors it like that, you, "cottage"!<eos> We Could Spend two or three days at my cottage When I have my daughter not Worse Than you ... I do not know ...<eos> Are you ...<eos> - You're the song Vivo per lei?<eos> - What?<eos> The song Vivo per lei?<eos> Andrea Bocelli, yes.<eos> I have sour For That.<eos> You did the duet version of the girl with bad guy?
- A black budget report.<eos> Unfortunately, it's in Collier's hands now.<eos> I'm afraid that's not exactly accurate, Harold.<eos> Collier just sent out another coded message.<eos> "Disseminate."<eos> A shocking revelation today as an anonymous source released a classified government report...<eos> The report revealed black budget items connected to an invasive surveillance system...<eos> High-level government officials, including Senator Ross Garrison, were named in the report. - Senator!<eos> Does this massive surveillance system exist, Senator?<eos> It does not.
- Stop!<eos> What are...<eos> Don't push me!<eos> Now he's in there.<eos> Great.<eos> Not doing it.<eos> I'm not doing it.<eos> Blake, you don't even know how to drive, man.<eos> - Shut up.<eos> Yes, I do.
- Beautifully.<eos> We've uploaded your neural networks to the server.<eos> Now what?<eos> Well, I need you to do one thing.<eos> I need you to take a long, relaxing bubble bath when I begin Phase Two, the download to the replacement anatomy.<eos> It'll have my brain?<eos> Not your physical brain.<eos> Your mind, your thoughts, memories, your personality.<eos> Will it like Brussels sprouts?<eos> Not if you don't.
Hurry, or we'll be dead before tomorrow.<eos> Observe, child, the quintessence of devoted marriage, how carefully I attend to my dear husband's toilet And how fearlessly he exposes his throat to my blade.<eos> Come along, miss Mercy.<eos> Leave her.<eos> Take him with you, tituba.<eos> One's too few, and three's too many.<eos> Your eyes... So filled with want.<eos> The hard part's not getting what you want, child.<eos> The hard part's knowing what you want.<eos> But I do.
[Oliver chuckles] Okay, what if, by some incomprehensible twist of fate, it takes the U.S. post office more than three days to deliver a simple letter?<eos> And, in the meantime, Kelly shows up... And she waits... And waits...<eos> And she waits, but he never comes, and so she's standing there, on the bridge, alone, wondering how he could just leave her there, after she said she loves him so much?<eos> I admire your passion, Ms. Mclnerney, but our job is to simply revive a dead letter and send it along.<eos> And, yes, there are times when we wonder what will become of those who receive them, but we are the United States post office.<eos> We cannot play God.<eos> You said you don't believe in coincidences.<eos> What if you had pulled a green envelope out of there, instead of that pink one?<eos> Then Charlie and Kelly would never have had a chance.<eos> But now they do.
You're shameless, I've been calling you for a month.<eos> Give me back the Berni.<eos> - What was that?<eos> - Wait, wait, wait.<eos> Will you do me a favor?<eos> Buy some hot dogs<eos> Sure?<eos> Even the cook realized it was a bad copy.<eos> - I don't have that Berni.<eos> - Yes, you do.
Let's get out of here.<eos> Let's get out of here!<eos> Wait!<eos> No!<eos> I have other available lots!<eos> Okay, we have to get up.<eos> I don't want to have to fire you for being late.<eos> I'll appeal and tell them why.<eos> (groans) Not sure I told you... my parents are coming to town.<eos> No, you didn't.
I am a hot, smart woman with an ass that doesn't quit.<eos> So why doesn't everyone just trust me for once in your life?<eos> Trust me.<eos> I'm gonna find that real email.<eos> "Dear Mindy, I know I'm breaking our tacit rule "by emailing you twice in one day, but here's why... "I can't stop thinking about you.<eos> I think we should meet in person."<eos> "Please let me know if you're interested.<eos> "Oh, how I hope that you are.<eos> "If this correspondence has even the slightest chance "of changing our lives forever, don't you think we owe it to ourselves to explore it?"<eos> "I do.
I didn't want to tell you because I knew...<eos> I knew this would happen.<eos> I knew it would push you away.<eos> I love you.<eos> Mindy, I love you.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I want to be with you.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> Yes, you do.
- They're here.<eos> - And?<eos> So, Fredo?<eos> He's not at the lake or the river.<eos> No.<eos> Something might have happened.<eos> Maybe he was hit by a car, drowned in a river...<eos> Selling to the Chapuis did him in.<eos> I won't say it.<eos> So don't.
Re-do it.<eos> I will not send him to a school...<eos> Shit!<eos> Oh, it's open.<eos> Sorry, it's open.<eos> Fredo!<eos> He's not at the lake or the river.<eos> Cut.<eos> What?<eos> - Re-do.
I know what I'm talking about.<eos> Yeah, well, my mom loved it, too.<eos> Her and my dad used to put it on and get tipsy.<eos> And dance.<eos> And my sister and I would sneak down and watch.<eos> And the lyric's...<eos> ♪ Or anyone at all.<eos> That's... that makes sense.<eos> What?<eos> No, it doesn't.
You'd have to ask him that.<eos> I'm asking you.<eos> Why would a solid cop like Cutter-- close to making detective-- suddenly turn in his shield, forfeit his seniority and start from scratch with another department?<eos> You know, I always considered us colleagues.<eos> Friends, even, in that "from work" kind of way.<eos> You?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> There was an allegation that went away with a quick settlement and a quiet resignation.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I didn't... till now.
Everything okay?<eos> Your text said it was "serious."<eos> Yeah, it's about a friend of mine.<eos> A friend?<eos> No, really, he's a great kid.<eos> Name's Tyler.<eos> He went to my school, but Mom said she saw him in Hell's Kitchen looking like he was on drugs.<eos> Did he use when you knew him?<eos> I know he smoked pot sometimes.<eos> No, I don't.
Teri's actions put the entire firm at risk.<eos> I was protecting you.<eos> You think I need protection?<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> I'm a partner in this firm, and you went behind my back to Kim?<eos> Kim, a woman whose idea of compassion is... is stepping over the homeless.<eos> No, Jane, I spared you from having to choose between the firm and your friends.<eos> - I knew you'd choose Teri.<eos> - So you chose for me.<eos> I don't...
What are you grinning about?<eos> Are you happy that I had an affair with that over-sexed married woman?<eos> Cheryl just said that you both know you didn't do it, and given that she's obsessed with you and hated her husband, I don't think you killed Harry.<eos> I think it's possible she did.<eos> And according to that file, she was at the club the day of the murder.<eos> Oh, yeah. We have another suspect.<eos> Stace? Sweetie, what's wrong?<eos> I'm worried about Owen.<eos> I don't think he wants to marry me.<eos> Well, of course he does.
The murder victim.<eos> And that, Dr. Hubert, is probably where my fear of anthropomorphic animals comes from.<eos> I still can't go to Disney Land.<eos> Thank you for sharing.<eos> Mm-hmm. But we've been here for 45 minutes, and I'm not hearing anything from Owen.<eos> Owen, you recently had an anxiety attack.<eos> Let's talk about that.<eos> Yes, let's!<eos> I don't think Owen wants to marry me.<eos> What? ! No, of course I do.
I'm not sure anyone would enjoy that.<eos> Oh, no, well, that's not really true.<eos> You know, I mean, 'cause you're just always so self-deprecating.<eos> I've got stuff to do.<eos> She's green.<eos> I don't think we should just put her in with random skank.<eos> You said Zen Dolls, right?<eos> That's right.<eos> I know somebody who works there.<eos> Or did.
Come on.<eos> Found this in my desk.<eos> What was she like?<eos> She was a pain in the ass.<eos> Her coffee order was the most complicated in the district.<eos> Took her longer to describe it than to drink it.<eos> But she was damn good police.<eos> Slept like a baby every night.<eos> Mind if I keep it?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- What's up, bro?<eos> - Don't get used it to it, though.<eos> We don't seem to stay in them for very long.<eos> - How is burgess taking it?<eos> - Taking what?<eos> - You know, you getting promoted up here, When perhaps... She deserves it a little bit more.<eos> - Oh, that.<eos> Well, she's been assigned a new partner.<eos> - There he is.<eos> - Hey, man, what the hell you doing back so soon, huh?
Let's leave it at that.<eos> - I don't even know what I would have done If he was taken away from me.<eos> - You don't have to think about that now.<eos> - So...<eos> Charlie... - Confessed.<eos> He'll probably get a little rhythm for cooperating.<eos> Annie, I'm sorry.<eos> I should've never let charlie back in.<eos> People don't change.<eos> - You did.
Come on.<eos> No, it's yours.<eos> No.<eos> Know what?<eos> Now I want some.<eos> What do you want, Simon?<eos> We are blowing out Madison's candles.<eos> Listen, I don't care that you're her father.<eos> Madison doesn't want to talk to you.<eos> Because she doesn't.
I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Well, look, look, obviously, you know, I can't... condone this kind of behavior.<eos> But, you know, if you...<eos> if you think it's... helping you, I mean, that's really the important thing.<eos> It is helping.<eos> I feel so free.<eos> Do you know what it's like to have sex with a woman who never wants to see you again?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I met this one.<eos> I mean... yeah.<eos> Yeah, I mean we bumped into each other this morning at the queue to the lift.<eos> And I guess we were both longing for someone...<eos> Just kidding.<eos> No, we had a great day.<eos> Good snowboarding and really nice talks.<eos> You told me that you're very religious.<eos> - I... didn't say that.<eos> - Yes, you did.

He's driving off...<eos> It was really dangerous.<eos> It's insane...<eos> - Could you carry Vera?<eos> - Are you tired?<eos> Want a smoke?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Actually, can I take one?<eos> Do you smoke, Daddy?<eos> Yes, I do.
Do you know where my family went?<eos> Do you know what it was?<eos> It was a test.<eos> Not for what came before, but for what came after. It was a test for what comes now.<eos> Well, if it was a test, then I think you may be failing it.<eos> I love you, Matt... but what you're doing... your paper, the church... it's not working anymore.<eos> It's not making things better.<eos> Maybe it's time to let it go.<eos> The kids' preschool teacher.<eos> They usually did it at her apartment.
I think you're overreacting a little bit.<eos> - You think?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You think... this furniture will just, like, merge together all of a sudden while we're watching?<eos> Seriously, what are we talking about right now? I don't...<eos> I've never done this before, okay?<eos> I've never lived with someone before.<eos> I'm not used to accepting stupid... wooden bars and stuff like that.<eos> You always say that things will work out.<eos> But what if they don't?
Maybe I'm just doing it for the love of the job.<eos> They're paying me a lot.<eos> Take a picture, it'll last longer.<eos> Hey, hey, uh, I don't suppose your animals do any tricks?<eos> What's that?<eos> I mean, you wouldn't happen to have, you know, a horse that counts or a sheep that juggles?<eos> I mean, anything to sell tickets.<eos> Juggling sheep, huh?<eos> See that little goat over there?<eos> He does a pretty neat trick.
But what happens when the novelty wears off and we're left with no common ground?<eos> Then we're like a...<eos> like a tiger and an Indian boy in a very small boat.<eos> Yeah, I didn't get that movie either.<eos> Look, the good news is... it's up to the universe now.<eos> Oh! Oh, come on.<eos> The opening act's about to start.<eos> Uh... the date's over already?<eos> How'd it go?<eos> It didn't.
His gun is in there.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> What?<eos> I need you to get out in that hallway.<eos> You ok?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Relieved.<eos> I thought it was gonna be the worst day.<eos> I was so afraid Reid wasn't going to make it.<eos> Yeah, but he did.
If I die before you, please don't let them read "Wind Beneath My Wings" at my funeral.<eos> Who knew it had so many verses?<eos> You think that we didn't know him or his family didn't?<eos> Maybe he changed.<eos> They said he liked nighttime walks in the snow?<eos> He hated the snow.<eos> What about that food?<eos> I didn't know he cooked.<eos> He didn't!
I said that this was a custody hearing.<eos> My scientific materialism doesn't apply here.<eos> "Chapter five:<eos> On Morality. "Humans create value systems to organize the world.<eos> "Pleasure is good, pain is bad.<eos> "Charity is good, murder is bad.<eos> But they are random and, in fact, meaningless."<eos> Do you not believe this?<eos> Professor?<eos> - I do.
- OK.<eos> Hello!<eos> To what do I owe a visit from my daughter?<eos> You don't look great.<eos> We can't all start the day with red wine.<eos> Tell me about the ASCP, the security agency.<eos> I don't know anything about them.<eos> They installed your alarm.<eos> Possibly, but I don't deal with maintenance issues.<eos> Dad, you do everything, round here.
Really?<eos> - How's that?<eos> - Well, you know, backstabbing, stealing secrets, pretending to be someone's friend just so you can undermine them.<eos> - We've all been there.<eos> - Is that so?<eos> And what kind of a pageant have you been in?<eos> Well, it was a robotics competition.<eos> Ahem. But the, politics are all the same.<eos> - If you say so.<eos> - I do.
You're trying to save her.<eos> You've seen danger here.<eos> My old friend, how can I say this?<eos> I can't let you leave.<eos> Your gift of sight is invaluable to me, to the safety of France.<eos> You can force me to stay... but not to see.<eos> You'll have me, but not my visions.<eos> Not if you cost me this last chance at happiness.<eos> So you came to me as if I had a choice,<eos> - but clearly I don't.
No, it's like, seamless operation.<eos> Yeah!<eos> Don't mind them. She's just showing off her work.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - Sorry.<eos> Amazing.<eos> Dr. Marber is an artist.<eos> Dr. Marber?<eos> No way.<eos> - Do it.
- All right.<eos> - All right, baby.<eos> See you and Jake, Barnes Noble, I'll have the press there, do a couple of interviews, a couple of happy snaps.<eos> - Easy peasy.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You look great. - Bye, Cat.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Bye, darling.<eos> Cat said that Jake needs to be at the book signing.<eos> He does.
We have to stop him.<eos> To the stable.<eos> Peggy-Sis.<eos> Headhorn.<eos> Chariot.<eos> And Minnie.<eos> The Equestranauts!<eos> Do I like this show?<eos> Neigh...<eos> I do not.
Are you named Bob?<eos> Oh. I was just...<eos> Bob, come.<eos> Sorry, Sunpuddle.<eos> Oh, he's always doing that to me.<eos> All these...<eos> Equesticles.<eos> We both know they're weak, pathetic.<eos> I-I don't think that.<eos> Yes, you do.
Oh, God.<eos> Oh, I'm getting younger.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> Can you tell, Bob?<eos> Uh, yup, mm-hmm, yup.<eos> Look around the side of the eyes.<eos> You see it?<eos> Yeah, yeah, uh, looking... good.<eos> Do you still recognize me?<eos> Do you?
You bet... for two whole minutes.<eos> Then, um... in retrospect, a laser show and 3-D holograms was one gigawatt too many.<eos> I just started my lecture on mechanical engineering, and the whole building blacked out.<eos> Oh, you're... you're a teacher here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You thought I was the A.V. guy?<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yes, I totally did.
That makes you a good man for me.<eos> Harvey, sometimes we need a little help.<eos> Big day.<eos> Horrible day.<eos> It ended well.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You and Louis really came through.<eos> So did you.<eos> Look, I know what you're thinking.<eos> - No, you don't.
So I-I don't think I'm gonna have time to get you your stuff.<eos> Why can't you just get it at the airport?<eos> Wait... you know what? Maybe I can just grab something at the airport.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Good morning.<eos> - Ultrasound's ready. - Okay.<eos> We're gonna see which saphenous vein to harvest.<eos> Ooh, that's so cold.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> How did you...
She has made so many sacrifices for me, and now I think it's time for me to do the same for her.<eos> Wait.<eos> I have been wanting to leave for a while now, but I just haven't been able to find anyone that I was willing to give the institute to, until now.<eos> Wait.<eos> You're offering me your hospital, like you're Willy Wonka and you're handing me a chocolate factory?<eos> Cheer up, Charlie.<eos> You're not serious?<eos> You are serious.<eos> This place is yours, Cristina, if you want it.<eos> Do you?
It's like free money.<eos> Can you imagine what he would've given us if the glasses were clean?<eos> All this money and I didn't even do anything.<eos> I'm one mustache away from being a Kardashian.<eos> Yeah, Nicky's a big-shot bookie with a Yorkie and a membership to the VIP lounge at the race track.<eos> A Yorkie and a green leather jacket?<eos> Are you even real?<eos> I love horse racing.<eos> I used to go to the track all the time, and not to brag, but I do own a Thoroughbred.<eos> Oh, yeah, she does.
"Backed" is to passive.<eos> Okay, what's the final version?<eos> Mm. "Anyone who knows me knows I've have a tendency "to bristle when pushed into a corner.<eos> I end up saying things that I not only regret..."<eos> but truly do not believe.<eos> My comments were thoughtless, and I'm sorry if I offended anyone.<eos> More to the point...<eos> and I want to be clear... it's no one's fault if they are poor.<eos> And you feel that was a sincere apology, Mrs. Florrick?<eos> Yes, I do.
It goes with everything.<eos> It's nature.<eos> Norman, you wouldn't be doing this because you're mad at me, would you?<eos> I have no reason to be mad at you.<eos> I love my work, and I'm sharing it with you because I love you.<eos> Enjoy.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Oh, hey. The rod that holds up the shower curtain just broke out of the wall.<eos> - Well, maybe Norman can hold it up for me while I fix it.<eos> So how did you...
Can you come by my house later?<eos> No. No, I can meet you someplace public.<eos> That way I know you can't shoot me, and I can't be spotted with you, so it's gonna have to be someplace outside of White Pine Bay.<eos> There's a pizza place in Downtown Oceanview.<eos> I'll meet you there at 8:00 P.M.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> I just put dinner on.<eos> Hope you like steak.<eos> Who doesn't?
I hope there haven't been any more encounters with the king.<eos> I've been staying out of his way.<eos> Waiting for you to return.<eos> Why do you stop?<eos> It's not our first kiss.<eos> You're my husband, it's all right.<eos> It's not as though I'm inexperienced.<eos> I'm well aware of that.<eos> Well, if you wanted a virgin...<eos> No, I don't.
Huh?<eos> Dad, are you headed out?<eos> For work?<eos> Yeah, I have to go see someone in the inner walls.<eos> I'll be back in two or three days.<eos> Eren wants to join the Survey Corps.<eos> Mikasa, you traitor!<eos> Eren, what are you thinking?<eos> Do you know how many people die outside those walls?<eos> I do!
We can do it.<eos> I'm strong.<eos> Stronger than all of you.<eos> Extremely strong.<eos> I can kill all those Titans there.<eos> Even if I'm alone.<eos> You're either incompetent or you're spineless cowards.<eos> How pathetic.<eos> You can sit here and suck on your fingers.<eos> Yeah, do that.
WPF-- "when pigs fly""<eos> I didn't believe a word the guy said.<eos> Ah.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, I think we got the visual perfect here.<eos> But we're missing something.<eos> What are we missing?<eos> Odor.<eos> Oh, I didn't know you wanted to go that far.<eos> Uh, I don't.
Come on.<eos> Hi, Dave.<eos> Hi.<eos> I brought you some dog food.<eos> Look.<eos> Where's Emma?<eos> Where's Emma, huh?<eos> How do you know my name?<eos> Why'd you tell me you didn't have a family?<eos> I don't.
Because it takes courage to think for yourself.<eos> She did.<eos> Maybe she was there as an agent provocateur.<eos> Maybe she was there getting her masters degree.<eos> It took a bullet to finish what Detectives Cameron and Fonnegra started.<eos> Are you seriously suggesting Rebecca Barton was assassinated?<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> But they have someone in custody.<eos> Come on.<eos> Of course they do.
There was a calling pattern on Rebecca Barton's phone.<eos> Same number kept cropping up.<eos> Untraceable.<eos> Check out the dates.<eos> I took it back a year.<eos> This was when we were looking for a mole in the department.<eos> And, more recently, when Liber8 took Jim Martin.<eos> Yeah. Betty found his location pretty quickly.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Yes you do.
Never mind, found it.<eos> Your mom wasn't worried when you'd come down here?<eos> She was a little jealous that I was hanging out with Tiny Marge without her, but...<eos> The only thing my mom ever worried about was herself.<eos> She's selfish.<eos> She missed my birth 'cause she "had a thing."<eos> Come on, she can't be that bad.<eos> Turns out, you're not that big of a high school dropout, And she's probably not that big of a monster.<eos> I mean, she raised you alone, and you didn't die.<eos> I did actually, twice.
Uh... looked like a breech birth, but then the baby did a little somersault, stuck the landing.<eos> You need to start thinking gymnastics.<eos> - Olympics 2032.<eos> - USA! USA!<eos> USA!<eos> Smokey Taylor for the gold.<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> - The minute you walked out, she freaked and started yelling that she wasn't ready to be a mother.<eos> How do we know she's not gonna freak and change her mind again?<eos> - We don't.
Your significant other is about to submit his entire life to public scrutiny.<eos> If you think this is bad, wait until the press gets a hold of you.<eos> I am someone who interrogates people for a living, so I do think that I can handle whatever it is that the press throws at me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then tell me about your first marriage.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, you're about to re-marry a man you divorced only a year and a half ago.<eos> That's kind of weird, right?<eos> - You want to explain it?<eos> - No, I don't.
It's a Morgan silver dollar.<eos> "Morgan" starts with "M."<eos> It's the only silver coin with 13 stars... 13.<eos> 1921.<eos> That adds up to 13.<eos> Yes.<eos> You're very good at math, Alex.<eos> I love numbers.<eos> They don't lie.<eos> But people do.
Who you are.<eos> I know what to say to make you laugh.<eos> I know how you felt when your mother died.<eos> I know how you felt when... Our baby died.<eos> I can'.<eos> I can't.<eos> I thought I knew you, but now...<eos> Baby, I... I'm not sure.<eos> You did.<eos> You did, Jack.
- Tequila for everyone!<eos> One, two, three.<eos> She's a wild one!<eos> Who cares!<eos> I don't feel like sleeping.<eos> One, two, three.<eos> Cheers!<eos> It's very good after drinking champagne.<eos> You have a shot, go to bed and crash out, you'll sleep all day.<eos> Like we don't already!
She said no.<eos> You all right?<eos> You okay?<eos> Who the hell were those guys?<eos> You're asking me?<eos> Those guys were after you.<eos> Who's your wife?<eos> Who are you?<eos> - George...<eos> - No, don't.
You don't know what it's like on the outside.<eos> - You've been in prison for how long?<eos> - Three years.<eos> Three years.<eos> Well, the whole world has changed.<eos> How?<eos> How?<eos> Stamps are more expensive.<eos> I see right through what you're trying to do, Charlie.<eos> - You do?
Dad beat me so I ran away.<eos> And Grandma chased me.<eos> Then she fell into the sea.<eos> I ran away to avoid getting beat up.<eos> You saw her fall in the sea?<eos> Dad beat me.<eos> So I ran, and Grandma chased me.<eos> Said she'll kill me.<eos> Were you here with your grandma?<eos> Did you...
OK, Ashley, I'm arresting you on suspicion of abduction and demanding money with menaces.<eos> What?<eos> !<eos> You don't have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention when questioned something you later rely on in court.<eos> That's...<eos> You can't, th...<eos> Anything you do say may be given in evidence.<eos> Are you with me, Ashley? Have you taken that in?<eos> I haven't...<eos> I didn't...
when I asked him for a rise, then none of it, again, none of it would've happened.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> Maybe, I flipped, God knows, but...<eos> And then you...<eos> Me?<eos> Oh, come on!<eos> You encouraged me.<eos> I...<eos> Maybe not to start with.<eos> But you did.
Demetrie, I told you...<eos> It could've been Demetrius.<eos> You'll have to excuse Detective Johnson.<eos> He's worried that you're confusing your duty as a defense attorney with your duties as a witness.<eos> You're not. Are you?<eos> Good luck, Mr. State's Attorney.<eos> Finn Polmar. Finn, I had a thought.<eos> About how to keep Castro from firing you.<eos> You know he's running for state's attorney?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He's responding to pain.<eos> One saline!<eos> Now!<eos> I've never seen this before.<eos> Please save him.<eos> Don't take him from me again!<eos> Please, God, give him a second chance.<eos> Let's get him to the OR!<eos> I swear to God, Toph, I thought he was gone.<eos> We all did.
It's not going through.<eos> The towers are probably overloaded.<eos> Look, Topher and Janet will be okay.<eos> Her labor took 12 hours the last time, so... hopefully she'll be back before her water even breaks.<eos> And we need you downstairs.<eos> Scott is an excellent surgeon.<eos> Yeah, he's good.<eos> I just don't like...<eos> Anyone telling you what to do?<eos> Who does?
Take a look at that sucker.<eos> How many did McGarrett get on his first try, you say?<eos> Half a dozen.<eos> Oh.<eos> But I'll tell you what... that's three times bigger than anything he caught.<eos> You got your phone?<eos> Yeah... Take a picture and send it to him.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You sure you want to kick up that hornet's nest?<eos> Oh, hell yeah, I do!
- Thanks very much(!<eos> ) - For the animals, I mean!<eos> I know.<eos> Thank you, Billy.<eos> Have you had any tea yet?<eos> MURMURS: An a fortiori argument is an argument from a stronger...<eos> Must you read at the table?<eos> What's all that stuff anyway?<eos> - I thought you were going to see Neville Kelly.<eos> - Well, we did.
Really?<eos> Because I have it on good authority that its existence was recorded in the minutes of that meeting, which are on file in your office.<eos> It also says that it was your decision not to read it out.<eos> Now, if that letter had been read out as intended, it would have set out how this zoo will be a way of appreciating the world around us, from a baby penguin to a 100-year-old tortoise, a place where all our families, mine included,<eos> can be in touching distance of something magical.<eos> Now, as for having nothing but contempt for Upton, then, yes, I have at times fallen into that trap, but that's not how I feel now.<eos> I don't blame any of you for protecting what you love - I can't.<eos> It's exactly what I'm trying to do right now.<eos> Now, we've all said and done things we don't mean, myself included, and we don't always see eye-to-eye, but I believe we could live side-by-side.<eos> I really do.
Let's do it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Oh, baby!<eos> She went about it the wrong way, but Bailey's treatment did work.<eos> A-a-are you looking for a "Thank you," Dr. Hunt?<eos> She's lucky he's alive, because we're only gonna take her license.<eos> When we're done, she won't practice medicine ever again.<eos> And if we lost him, I wouldn't stop until she was behind bars. I...<eos> It wasn't Dr. Bailey's fault.<eos> She didn't do anything wrong.
Richard, I just wanna say, I really respect what you're doing here.<eos> And if you could ever use someone with my business development skill set, I would love to be a part of this.<eos> The fuck you will be.<eos> We'll call you when we want pleated khakis.<eos> You know this is a fucking domestic?<eos> Why... why were you so mean to him?<eos> He wasn't spying on us.<eos> He just said he likes us.<eos> - He wants to join the company.<eos> - Of course he does, Richard.
I'd be happy to discuss it with you.<eos> Good day, gentlemen.<eos> You smoke weed?<eos> You really embarrassed me in there.<eos> You didn't say shit about any business plan before today.<eos> And neither did he.<eos> And he was kind of being an asshole back there.<eos> Yeah, that's why he's a billionaire. 'Cause he knows how and when to be an asshole.<eos> That's what you need to be like.<eos> - You do, Richard.
Oh. Anything needed to be said to her can be said to me.<eos> Oh, that's beautiful!<eos> My familiar.<eos> Familiar?<eos> A gift from the Devil to do my bidding, my spiritual companion.<eos> This is how she feeds.<eos> Will I get a familiar?<eos> In time.<eos> How do I choose?<eos> You don't.
Oh yeah, and there's one other thing you should know,<eos> Honey, I can't hear you.<eos> Okay, you know what, just...<eos> I'll talk to you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, we need to talk.<eos> Oh, I can't right now, Joe.<eos> I just stopped by to pick up my notes for my afternoon meeting with the Mayor.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> You do?
Zander, no...<eos> Just let me finish, okay?<eos> I know that we're just supposed to be friends now.<eos> And...<eos> You just need to understand that you're not alone.<eos> Okay?<eos> 'Cause you have me.<eos> And you'll always have me.<eos> You want to be with me even if I'm pregnant with Emerson's baby?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Say good night, sweetie.<eos> Oh, do you think you're gonna go?<eos> It's okay.<eos> Let it go.<eos> This is a waste of time.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get off me. Stop.<eos> How do you know it's real?<eos> The black box?<eos> I don't.
Tell me what you want.<eos> Do I know everything now?<eos> Yes.<eos> All of it, every single bit of it, stays between us.<eos> Whole town's turned out, looks like.<eos> Except for us.<eos> You always said I was too close...<eos> That I couldn't see what was right in front of me.<eos> I wanted to be wrong.<eos> I really did.
Go get it out of her.<eos> Do you have children?<eos> Yeah, why?<eos> If you have kids, I don't understand how you could stand over his body smoking and then just keep walking your dog.<eos> I knew someone would find him.<eos> Didn't want to get involved.<eos> You people destroyed my family.<eos> How?<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> - It does to me.
(Kathy) All?<eos> Rene thinks you're hiding something, that there's more to the story.<eos> Does she?<eos> Why don't you let us decide if there's more?<eos> Unless you'd prefer that all of Gracepoint learn about your hospital visit.<eos> So you're threatening me?<eos> There must be some part of you that's sick of having a secret.<eos> Keeping a secret like that's exhausting, weighs on your heart.<eos> Oh, at least you love me.<eos> Yes, you do.
Dave, can I borrow your shirt? - No.<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> Cheryl, can I please borrow your blouse?<eos> Whoa, I'm not wearing a blouse, bro.<eos> It's really more of a chemise.<eos> I'm not wearing that either.<eos> Mr. Barber, you offered a deal, yes?<eos> Yes, we'll drop obstruct for a plea on vandalism.<eos> For which you have no case.<eos> - We do, actually. - Okay.
Look... you believe what you want.<eos> But we both know who Vincent really is, what he is capable of and that is a bad thing... and it has to be stopped.<eos> By you?<eos> By all of us, Detective.<eos> Personal thoughts aside, we are sworn to uphold the law.<eos> Whether we like it or not, that is our job, that is your job.<eos> We are way past the point of no return here, Tess.<eos> This thing is gonna blow up on Vincent and soon.<eos> Which means you need to pick a side.<eos> So does Catherine.
Check all the surrounding surveillance cameras, we got to follow them.<eos> There!<eos> They're heading north, narrow your search.<eos> Where are they?<eos> I don't know. They must've found a gap.<eos> He's obviously knows what he's doing.<eos> Damn it.<eos> Keep looking.<eos> Did you know Catherine was with him?<eos> No. I didn't.
I can't believe you made me think that you loved me.<eos> How could you do that to me?<eos> Lacey, I'm so sorry.<eos> I was desperate.<eos> I was trying to save you from yourself.<eos> I didn't need to be saved.<eos> Even if I got caught, I wasn't going to jail.<eos> Juries love me.<eos> You saw my boobs.<eos> I did.
You killed the ad.<eos> You killed everything.<eos> She's the kind of girl who's gonna shine for the network in her callback for the "Bracken's World" pilot.<eos> What?<eos> Don and I signed Chevy.<eos> Don who?<eos> Our collective ex-wife who still receives alimony?<eos> I agree with Jim.<eos> Do you still love Megan?<eos> Of course I do.
He's Shyam...<eos> I'm Ram.<eos> Humpty Dumpty!<eos> Uncle said their driver was very cute.<eos> You're smoking again!<eos> What happened, why do you look so tensed?<eos> Do you love me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm being serious.<eos> Of course I do.
Too bad she never got to give the message.<eos> What if she did?<eos> Maybe that person, the person she was writing to, the one that she couldn't protect anymore, maybe that's who killed her.<eos> Any idea who that could be?<eos> Yeah, tons of ideas.<eos> All of them pretty nasty.<eos> There's a creaky saying you hear a lot at the meetings:<eos> Do you want to be right or do you want to be happy?<eos> I don't have that choice.<eos> I never did.
That's a very interesting question, and I will have to get back to you on it.<eos> I'm so sorry you had to go talk to Ezra.<eos> Yeah, well, we had to know what he was going to say about New York.<eos> But somebody else could have gone and done that.<eos> No, not really.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Do you need anything?<eos> Yeah, I need to know that it didn't happen.<eos> Shana in the theater.<eos> But it did.
You don't know them.<eos> And I'm tired of accepting society's definition of me.<eos> I don't pray to that anymore.<eos> Darling, I understand.<eos> Being a young mother can be overwhelming, even with help.<eos> You sit with your child at the end of the day and you're exhausted and you don't even know what you did.<eos> And everything you do seems wrong.<eos> It's hard to accept that those are the definitions, but they are.<eos> I'm sorry you had nothing to live for.<eos> I did.
We can't be in this line because A...<eos> You know, and B...<eos> He'll have already talked to everyone who's boarded.<eos> We need to be on the plane early.<eos> Let's go back to the first plan.<eos> No reporter is gonna sell us their ticket.<eos> There are people on this flight who aren't reporters.<eos> Let's look around and identify them.<eos> Those two are on their honeymoon.<eos> I do, just a little.
That he's been subjected to.<eos> That he's been subjected to.<eos> Petty gossip.<eos> He's talking about proven allegations that priests have been raping children and that bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and maybe even this pope have been protecting the children?<eos> No, the priests.<eos> Benedict fails to mention that in his sermon, which is bad enough, but you failed to mention that in your report Monday.<eos> And that's inexplicable to me.<eos> Bill Donohue...<eos> Yeah, you don't want the Catholic League mad at you.<eos> Nobody does.
And Business Insider is gonna do a profile on me in which I will be likable.<eos> There's something I don't think you're understanding.<eos> What's that?<eos> You have a PR problem because you have an actual problem.<eos> Still don't know why I'm here.<eos> It was a story Charlie wanted because it was a story Pruit wanted and I pretended we couldn't find the Princeton student so we wouldn't have to do the segment.<eos> Charlie knew I was lying, he knew why I was lying.<eos> And I knew he knew why I was lying.<eos> It was a showdown and he lost.<eos> Yes, he did.
- I can.<eos> - Do it.<eos> I was wrong. That hurt.<eos> But do that if you ever see me put a cigarette in my mouth again.<eos> - Neal's plane landed.<eos> - All right, Neal's plane landed!<eos> - Why suddenly?<eos> - What?<eos> You said it was suddenly very important that you live a long time.<eos> - Did I?
You're standing in front of a mirror and 10 feet behind you is Sloan, who's monitoring the conversation.<eos> You want me to join you?<eos> You told him what I told you?<eos> - It had to be done.<eos> - It so didn't.<eos> You think that because I recommended you for the job in DC that I don't care that you might move to DC?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> - It's easy to interpret as a soft breakup.<eos> - I don't even know what that is.<eos> - He does.
You dating anybody?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> I'm just so busy...<eos> with work.<eos> Oh, you know what?<eos> There's this girl that Jenna went to college with.<eos> She's out here, she is smoking hot, man.<eos> I mean, I should get you her number.<eos> I don't really...
Like I would ever do that.<eos> This is so awkward.<eos> Eyes on the prize, Ryan.<eos> The quicker we find that gorge, the quicker this torture ends.<eos> You're just lucky you've got me here to guide you.<eos> No, I'm lucky I brought this.<eos> Yeah, but can that show you how to find food so you don't starve to death?<eos> I brought granola bars.<eos> Yeah, they'd be good if you didn't have a gluten allergy.<eos> Which I don't.
What-what does that mean?<eos> You're a god, right?<eos> Well, I did rise from the dead, yeah.<eos> Well, then, I guess you should know what that means.<eos> It doesn't work that way.<eos> It doesn't work at all.<eos> I mean, if you're a god, why didn't you know the truth about my father?<eos> You didn't even know you were a god.<eos> Admit it, you have no idea where we're going.<eos> Yes, I do.
I need to know that you're still here.<eos> Please, just give me a sign to let me know that... (sniffs)<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Wilfred. That'd be right, blame the dog.<eos> Oh, thank God.<eos> Ever since you've been gone,<eos> I-I feel like I've been holding my breath.<eos> Well, if that trouser cough is any indication, I can understand why.<eos> You know that's all you, right?<eos> I do now.
Always I'm increasing the tension.<eos> Then, burn on you 'cause you'll be holding onto a dead guy.<eos> ♪ I wanna hold you ♪<eos> ♪ A-till the fear in me subsides... ♪<eos> Believe me, if you're holding onto a 300-pound dead guy, fear is not gonna be your problem.<eos> Congratulations, you have ruined a beautiful song.<eos> It's a song?<eos> I thought we were just riffing.<eos> I apologize to Dan Hill and all of our viewers.<eos> I don't! Shh!
Nothing's as simple as it used to be.<eos> What's going on, Alicia?<eos> I'm spinning, Mom.<eos> I can't stop.<eos> I shouldn't have stopped working.<eos> Oh, honey, you're just hurting.<eos> I'm so sorry you have to go through this.<eos> - I don't know what to do, Mom.<eos> - Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Shh-shh. Oh, baby, nobody does.
I think it would have been worse judgment for me to sit back and do nothing while this man continued to brutally assault his wife.<eos> The family sued you for wrongful death.<eos> Is that correct?<eos> They were manipulated into it by a lawyer.<eos> They dropped the suit the next day.<eos> - So, let's review.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You sexually entrapped Erich Blunt into giving up a DNA sample, and you were completely out of policy when you shot and killed a man in a rogue police action... a killing for which you were put on administrative leave and sued.<eos> Inspector, don't you think these behaviors call into question your competence as a police officer?<eos> No, I don't.
I'm going to finish my drink.<eos> You can finish it with me, if you like.<eos> Now, look.<eos> Look at me.<eos> We've got a fund. For you.<eos> You'll get paid weekly.<eos> I know it won't bring back your son.<eos> I know that.<eos> You have other sons.<eos> You do.
This isn't business, this is bloody work.<eos> Cigarettes and booze is all right, but this manufactured stuff, it's heavy.<eos> I'm not even sure it's stolen.<eos> Some of it is legally purchased.<eos> One day, all of it will be.<eos> It's like having a fucking job.<eos> Hey! Easy with them fan belts.<eos> I'll wipe that smile off your face.<eos> I want another pound a boat.<eos> Done.
I had to have it.<eos> It was the chance to relive those magical 3 minutes and 42 seconds, which was also the length of the song.<eos> But then it dawned on me --<eos> I was cheating on my wife with the red-hot memory of another woman.<eos> I could not let Claire find out.<eos> I had to destroy the evidence.<eos> Luckily, I'm cool under pressure.<eos> What?<eos> ! No!<eos> When did he...?
What?<eos> I have a source... says she's protecting him because Keller was part of some military experiment that super-charged his DNA.<eos> "Super-charged DNA"?<eos> Yep.<eos> And since I know you're all friends, I was hoping you could corroborate.<eos> Listen, I thought you were a reporter, not a sci-fi writer, so...<eos> Tess?<eos> You know that I saw something strange at Cat's apartment that night.<eos> I know that you think you saw something that night and I also know who your so-called source is and he's completely unreliable.<eos> Yes. - You do?
- Mm-hmm.<eos> Sorry to make you wait.<eos> Yeah, in the middle of the night.<eos> So, you brought the serum?<eos> Actually, I didn't.<eos> - Right.<eos> Because none of this is real, right, Gabe?<eos> Look, I'm not doing this story.<eos> I don't believe Vincent's a beast, or that they even exist.<eos> Well, they do.
You're getting my insides dirty!<eos> Stan!<eos> Jeff?<eos> Jeff, are you there?<eos> Oh, Hayley, look at you, you're right back where you started, trapped in your room.<eos> Yeah, but-but Jeff might come back one day.<eos> Look, honey, Jeff is gone.<eos> And nobody knows where he is, not even him.<eos> Plus, he said he hated you right before he left.<eos> No, he didn't.
A 21, a 16 and a 19, which brings your total score to 286.<eos> And you need to tuck your elbow further under the dart.<eos> You had three wall hits and punctured the beer sign. Twice.<eos> What are you, the dart police? Yeah.<eos> I show up whenever anyone sucks at darts.<eos> Come on, come on.<eos> - Want to go? Want to go?<eos> - Please... can you give your highly superior memory a break while we try to relax? I...<eos> I never relax, you know this.<eos> I do.
I am barely pregnant!<eos> Thank you all for being here on this joyous occasion.<eos> There once was a homo named Tucker...<eos> Sal, stop.<eos> No, you're going into labor!<eos> Also, just stop!<eos> But we've only been together four months.<eos> I just love you so much, I can't wait to have your baby.<eos> God! Kids ruin everything!<eos> Yeah, they sure do.
Hey, so you're, like, the minister?<eos> Kinda.<eos> When they lost Sal, the situation was a no-brainer, which made them think of me.<eos> Isn't there a lot you have to remember to marry people?<eos> Not really.<eos> They all follow the same basic pattern.<eos> "We're gathered here today to join these two in holy matrimony."<eos> "Do you take him to be your lawfully wedded spouse?"<eos> And the first person says...<eos> - I do?
I'm gonna tell them about the real hero.<eos> You pulling my leg?<eos> The real hero is the person who got killed at the police station after you arrested him.<eos> Meep didn't deserve to die.<eos> And somebody is going to pay for what happened to my friend.<eos> Where the hell have you been? !<eos> Curfew's lifted.<eos> What?<eos> Have they caught the killer?<eos> He did.
We have to divert the attention of the audience in order to pull off the illusion.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> No, don't.<eos> My God, what have I done?<eos> Oh, Ethel.<eos> But you understand. I had to kill her.<eos> I had to protect my precious angels.<eos> Horseshit.<eos> You had to protect yourself.<eos> But you don't...
You're very quiet.<eos> Do you condone this... outrageous behavior?<eos> In fact, I think we should take 50% of the box office.<eos> ♪ You're mine<eos> ♪ And we belong...<eos> Jesus, what the hell was that, gasoline?<eos> It tastes like piss on fire, but it's cheap. It'll get you drunk twice as fast.<eos> Let's have another one.<eos> One's good for me.<eos> I don't do liquor.
Impressive.<eos> Yep. That coulda gone either way.<eos> Glad it went the good way.<eos> You know, I have to say, you're the most handsome tech guy I've interviewed for my list.<eos> Oh, well, I have to say, can you repeat that into my phone so I can use it as a ringtone?<eos> May I escort you to the terrace?<eos> Oh, what's this?<eos> Oh. Well, you know how at Costco they have all those free samples?<eos> - I don't.<eos> - Well, they do.
Jeez, somebody's gaydar's on the Fritz!<eos> I think you're the one who's straight.<eos> I love women and boobs and chopping firewood.<eos> Then what's he talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> He's just some jealous ex-boyfriend.<eos> He's the person that I slept with who made me realize that I am so over men and way into the lady business.<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - I don't know what's happening.<eos> I do.
Thank you, Sofia!<eos> You're the best friend ever!<eos> Cam is sweet and thoughtful and he totally respects the fact that I wanna go slow.<eos> Wait... what if just left because he doesn't like me?<eos> How good does it feel to lose your self-esteem over a guy, again?<eos> So good!<eos> How are you on this perfect, beautiful, angel-like morning?<eos> Someone's either on a sugar high or a "got them some sugar" high.<eos> Well, I know I don't usually talk about my personal life at work because I didn't have one, but...<eos> I do now!
I was having amazing sex over and over again.<eos> Yo, Gabi, I need pizza, I worked up an appetite.<eos> I'm too late!<eos> - Too late for what?<eos> - He's 17!<eos> Look, I'll get you a good lawyer, hopefully...<eos> No, no, no, wait, wait, wait.<eos> You don't have to do that.<eos> I know that he's 17.<eos> - You do?
Why?<eos> What you gonna do now?<eos> I just de-arrested you.<eos> I'll make a note of the fact that you apologised profusely.<eos> In tears.<eos> Mind how you go.<eos> What she say?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Eh?<eos> What she do to ya?
Ready when you are, Captain.<eos> Good.<eos> Then we won't waste time on pleasantries.<eos> I'm sure the name Fu'ad Hansur means something to you.<eos> Yes.<eos> Parsa gave up Hansur as his second in command during my interrogation.<eos> Hansur evaded our roundup, but today he showed his face.<eos> On behalf of the Brotherhood, he released a video claiming responsibility for the break.<eos> Thought you said he didn't have the funding to pull this off.<eos> They don't.
What did you say to me after Jackie died?<eos> What did you tell me to do?<eos> I was out for two months.<eos> That was different.<eos> It's been half a day, Gibbs.<eos> He was your father.<eos> He was.<eos> And now he's dead.<eos> And I still have a job to do.<eos> And I didn't?
Leticia Gomez.<eos> Says that you farmed out all your dirty work to the Brotherhood of Doubt because you thought they couldn't be traced back to you or your network.<eos> She gave you up.<eos> Fu'ad Hansur's compound last night.<eos> CIA followed your funding trail straight to it.<eos> Intel suggests that all remaining leaders of the Brotherhood were killed in the strike.<eos> Like I said, I don't need a confession from you, Alejandro.<eos> You think I'm dirt?<eos> You think my father was dirt?<eos> Damn right I do.
Look, I'm just doing a friend a favor.<eos> It's really not a big deal.<eos> What friend?<eos> What does Ida Bankowski have to do with anything?<eos> The Bankowski case is closed.<eos> Well, she's missing and my friend wants to find her, see if she's okay.<eos> When did the Roundhouse become your personal investigation resource?<eos> The intelligence officer who monitors that database reports to the commissioner every time he sees a red flag.<eos> Like why is a vice cop looking for investigative information on a homicide that's none of his business?<eos> Nothing to do with his caseload.
He asked me if I liked Mr Green and why he didn't like you.<eos> And what did you say?<eos> I said I don't know, because I don't.<eos> I promise you this.<eos> Nothing bad is ever going to happen to you again.<eos> I hope that's true.<eos> We'll sit by the fire, with all our children around us, and I'll make certain that you are safe.<eos> I wonder.<eos> We both want it so much, but do you believe it'll really happen?<eos> I do.
Eight months ago at 2:00 in the morning?<eos> - Come on.<eos> You know how this works.<eos> - Yeah, I know how it works.<eos> Am I being detained?<eos> The witnesses who fingered Walton came clean, all right?<eos> They admitted to lying.<eos> Then why did Walton take the deal?<eos> He didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
You sure there's no other family we can call?<eos> Uh...<eos> The only other family I have left is Erich Blunt.<eos> I understand.<eos> Don't be shy.<eos> Just slide it in there, nice and easy.<eos> Erich?<eos> Sorry, we have a situation.<eos> Who the hell let you in, Leonard?<eos> I did.
James Harbach is dead.<eos> Shot himself in the head.<eos> What?<eos> And he left a suicide note saying he killed Kevin Neyers.<eos> Don't pretend like you don't know.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> You had your grandfather kill your father.<eos> I know.<eos> Haven't put all the pieces together yet, and I will.<eos> But when I do...
Just let me be!<eos> Let you be?<eos> Mom's getting prepped!<eos> We need you here!<eos> Get here now!<eos> Fuck, everything's just perfect!<eos> Daddy, your foot!<eos> Hey, sweetie.<eos> Why aren't you sleeping?<eos> I already did.
Is he nuts? !<eos> Stop!<eos> Fucking...<eos> What a fucking moron...<eos> I just want to talk...<eos> I really don't know!<eos> All I want to know is... the reason why Park's looking for Lee.<eos> I don't know, I swear!<eos> Please let me go, okay?<eos> You really don't?
Dear mother of God.<eos> She called you?<eos> They sound like they've been drinking.<eos> I'm gonna kill them.<eos> I'm in a meeting, so I really don't know...<eos> Peter, just tell them to stop.<eos> This needs to stop.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I would go there myself with a hatchet, - but I'm in the middle of something here. - Okay.<eos> You didn't...
I know.<eos> Anyway, how do you feel about tomorrow?<eos> - Tomorrow?<eos> - Empty nest?<eos> I'll be fine.<eos> I'll see you tonight at 8:00.<eos> Eli.<eos> You busy?<eos> I thought we were only watching things that had to do with us.<eos> - This does.
Give me a few of them slams.<eos> These girls are my infatuation.<eos> God's greatest creation.<eos> They have the power to put my body in physical depression, encouraging the animal inside of me to take on a sexual aggression.<eos> My words are inspired by the curves and that's just a little lyrical confession.<eos> - Inspired by the curves, huh? - Okay.<eos> You hear that?<eos> - You hear him?<eos> You hear your son?<eos> - Yes, I did.
I made you steal and scam and try to make money without ever working and trying to be the big shot with that scum you hung out with.<eos> I did all that, didn't I?<eos> You broke my heart for a long time.<eos> Well, it took that long to find it.<eos> You did this to yourself.<eos> I sit at home and I wonder... how did things come to this?<eos> Why did I deserve this?<eos> There's no reason, Ma.<eos> You think when you're looking at the end, you're gonna get the reason why everything was the way it was.<eos> But you don't.
They are showing reruns of "Mr Aslan's Estate," Mom.<eos> She was a maid there, right?<eos> Don't be silly.<eos> What maid?<eos> She was the most beautiful girl in the house.<eos> - Why don't you do this any more.<eos> - I'm going to sign up with the agency.<eos> Even if I can't play such young women any more, I'll find roles that fit my age.<eos> Didn't you like the toy?<eos> I did, Daddy
Oooooo....<eos> - It's Seyhan, brother.<eos> - Ah Seyhan, come in, brother.<eos> Do you have an elephant comb?<eos> An elephant comb?<eos> What's up with that?<eos> We're shooting a film with Veli Bilgin and it's the last scene and he wants to open the shot with an elephant comb.<eos> You know how it is with art house stuff.<eos> - If you don't have it, I'll check in Karaköy.<eos> -I don't, Seyhan.
You have no business in this building, and you need a security pass to come down here.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Letting Pryce suck away your power because it terrifies you?<eos> Norman called.<eos> Asked me to meet him.<eos> - Goddamn it.<eos> And I told him I wasn't interested in a family therapy session.<eos> Thank God you're all right.<eos> I... missed you.<eos> Did you just...
Which is odd, because I'm not supposed to feel pain.<eos> Well, it happens.<eos> Medication you're on stimulates neurogenesis.<eos> Oh, that means it regrows brain cells, love.<eos> Some of those new cells will be pain receptors, I'm afraid.<eos> How many hours in total do you wear your contacts, Kieren?<eos> Oh, I wear them all the time.<eos> All the time?<eos> When do you take them out?<eos> I don't.
Say 7.30.<eos> I'd like that, sir.<eos> Well, I'm bloody skint.<eos> Me and you both, and there's nowt down that Jobcentre.<eos> Aye, cos every tart around here is employing those rotten bastards!<eos> Oh, dear. I should watch my language, though, shouldn't I?<eos> Can't even say boo to a goose these days.<eos> You know, we saved the world once. You'd think that'd be worth summat.<eos> It's like the Rising never happened.<eos> Aye, but it did.
Place call.<eos> Anya Sparks.<eos> Alan? Alan, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just needed to talk.<eos> Oh, you know, it's-it's late.<eos> It's just, I was thinking of Katie.<eos> You're the only one in the world who understands.<eos> I understand that calling me makes you feel better.<eos> I do.
You look good.<eos> How are you doing?<eos> Well... well enough to stay out of this place.<eos> Did you hear about the Cavanaugh settlement?<eos> I'm glad the family got some money.<eos> They would've preferred the truth.<eos> Heard about Mrs. DiLaurentis, too.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't really think that it was a coincidence that Bethany Young was found buried in her backyard.<eos> Do you?
I can't talk about Bethany or any other patient not to the cops or reporters or you.<eos> Look, I know that you have a set of rules that you have to stick to and I understand that, but somebody very close to me might be framed for her murder.<eos> So if you could just tell me anything at all, like if anybody from Rosewood ever visited her or anything, it would be such a great help.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> Eddie, you got a phone call.<eos> Good seeing you, Spencer.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I should never have come back here.<eos> Look, I get that you're scared, Ali.<eos> We all do.
Well, actually there is.<eos> I would like it if you would come down to the station later with your dad and answer some questions.<eos> About what?<eos> Your childhood friend, Shana Fring.<eos> I still can't believe she's gone.<eos> Yeah. It's so sad.<eos> So much tragedy for such a small town.<eos> If there's anything I can help you with.<eos> Well, we were hoping that you could tell us where you were the night she died.<eos> I already did.
Oh, someone's ticklish.<eos> Stop it, please stop it.<eos> Oh, you're gonna get it.<eos> Please, stop it, please, stop it.<eos> Oh, you're gonna get it.<eos> Please, stop it, I'm being serious.<eos> I'm being really serious.<eos> Please, stop it.<eos> Please don't do that, that's upsetting, I'm not...<eos> Don't!
[Weeping] She... she's gotta be alive.<eos> She's gotta be alive.<eos> Right?<eos> She lived?<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'm so scared.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know how to pray, Oliver.<eos> - You do.
Uh, I wanted to just ask you about one other thing... this right here on Memorial Day.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh.<eos> A man came to the door selling life insurance.<eos> Uh...<eos> James was out of the house...<eos> M.I.A. - Okay, that's a week before Neyers' death.<eos> - Right.<eos> You know where your husband went at that time?<eos> - No, I don't.
Trent's the new deputy D.A. Got here six months ago.<eos> - Charms all the judges' panties off.<eos> - Yeah, that's in his skill set.<eos> Yeah, and if you leave now, all of your clients get thrown back in that punch bowl until they're reassigned council, which could take days, or weeks.<eos> So maybe do us a solid and finish out the day.<eos> You are one spirited little lesbian.<eos> - Who said I'm a lesbian?<eos> - No one.<eos> Not... no, not me.<eos> Not anyone. No one did.
What a great office.<eos> Sooner or later you're going to get Don's, aren't you?<eos> I don't know how much better it is.<eos> He's right next door.<eos> I didn't expect to see you.<eos> - Megan's in for a visit.<eos> - Thanks for the subtitles.<eos> - Did you hear about Ginsberg? - Yes.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> I did.
Where is it?<eos> ...To the holy spirit.<eos> As it was in the beginning, is now, and ever shall be, So help me god.<eos> Where is it? !<eos> Holy spirit... [ bone cracks ] [ screams ]<eos> Oh, for the love of christ.<eos> [ sighs ] damn!<eos> [ dog barks in distance ] Jane: Yum.<eos> Tastes just like a ham-and-cheese omelet. Except without the ham and the cheese and the omelet.<eos> How did -- what?
It's okay.<eos> What happened back there?<eos> Well, see, I had to go into the bathroom to take a du... uh, stand against segregation.<eos> And they said, "nigga, don't you dare go into that bathroom."<eos> And I said, "you don't scare me, white man.<eos> "And my name ain't 'nigga.' you will address me as 'Mr. Freeman.'"<eos> Amazing.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> - Sturdy, did you hear this?<eos> - Yes, I did.
So, I cock the hammer, close my eyes and fire... ..and its fucking head explodes.<eos> You are so badass.<eos> Where were this?<eos> Roarton.<eos> No, where in Roarton?<eos> The Save'n'Shop.<eos> Um...<eos> Jem?<eos> I was wondering if you had a partner for the show-and-tell tomorrow.<eos> Cos if you didn't...
Like that. Don't forget to breathe.<eos> That's it.<eos> And lift your right leg up!<eos> And lift your left leg up.<eos> I fucking love Wednesdays.<eos> Yeah, we do it every Wednesday now. It's good...<eos> You know, it's good for the circulation, good for their heart.<eos> Vicky takes the class.<eos> Not everyone joins in, you know.<eos> Joe doesn't do it any more cos of his wig.
What?<eos> All those problems we've been having, me and Janice.<eos> I dunno.<eos> Yeah, you do.<eos> She left me.<eos> Been putting it about a bit.<eos> Word on the street, she's now called the hefty gobbler.<eos> Nah, we're better than ever now.<eos> Sex.<eos> Yeah, you do.
- Nah, I already helped you once.<eos> It ain't happening' again.<eos> Have fun with Hoss over there.<eos> No, no, no. No.<eos> No, no, no!<eos> Please!<eos> Please!<eos> Please! I'm sorry, please!<eos> Daryl. Stop. You almost died 'cause of him!<eos> But I didn't.
We're not going out there, but I'm a good shot.<eos> Show me.<eos> Okay.<eos> South side of the building.<eos> You can see him from in there.<eos> You're thirsty.<eos> Don't say you're not.<eos> Did you want me to shoot you?<eos> I thought I did.<eos> But I didn't.
Oh!<eos> That's my niece.<eos> I did not know that she was home.<eos> Oh, please, can you go and ask her to wait with me?<eos> Please?<eos> Uh, sure.<eos> But she was sleeping.<eos> Oh, for heaven's sake, wake her.<eos> You still have my keys.<eos> Yeah, I do.
How big you are, now!<eos> Time goes so fast.<eos> I don't know if you're still angry with me... but it was hard for me, too.<eos> And you, how are you doing?<eos> - Fine.<eos> And Fabián?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> What did he do to you?<eos> Does he know you're here?<eos> - No, he doesn't.
- WHO'RE YOU? - DETECTIVE TUTUOLA, MEET SONNY CARISI.<eos> REMEMBER THAT SENSITIVE, EXPERIENCED DETECTIVE<eos> THAT I PUT IN FOR?<eos> - SO WHO DO WE CALL FOR A WARRANT?<eos> - EASY THERE, COWBOY. WE'VE ALREADY TAKEN DOWN ONE HOUSE,<eos> AND ALL WE GOT WAS HOUSE.<eos> THERE'S SOMETHING BIGGER GOING ON HERE.<eos> - MAYBE WE DO STAKE IT OUT, PUT A U.C. INSIDE?<eos> - COOL. THEY DON'T KNOW ME.<eos> HOW ABOUT I DO IT?
Okay.<eos> Let me take a look at the numbers here.<eos> I kind of want to do this on my own, you know?<eos> I see here that your wife is on the deed, as well.<eos> That's right.<eos> And...<eos> Not a problem.<eos> She's all behind it.<eos> Don't expect me to thank you for doing your job.<eos> I don't.
The metaphorical way can end up hurting just as bad, though.<eos> But it would bleed less.<eos> I'm not authorized to prescribe medication.<eos> Something that might make life a little easier.<eos> At least easier than picking fights with cert teams.<eos> But if an inmate makes the request himself... then I'm required to run their request up the flagpole.<eos> Feel-good drugs?<eos> Feel-less-bad drugs, maybe.<eos> You get what I'm saying?<eos> I do.
Now.<eos> What's it to do with? Put your head between your knees. Hello?<eos> The thing is, Nevison...<eos> The thing is...<eos> I may be wrong...<eos> I may be wrong, but the thing is...<eos> ..I think I might know who these people are.<eos> Did you see anything?<eos> No. No.<eos> I-I didn't.
Yes, both, I guess.<eos> So if I believe there is no God, then there is no God.<eos> It's not the same thing.<eos> Why not?<eos> 'Cause you're just lost, Daniel.<eos> Something we can agree upon.<eos> I know God loves you, Daniel.<eos> You said that before.<eos> Or was it Jesus who loved me?<eos> They both do.
I like these.<eos> I think I might try to work out a deal with him.<eos> Janet...<eos> I've got some news.<eos> I really don't want to have to tell you this.<eos> He came by the house.<eos> Who?<eos> Teddy.<eos> He told you?<eos> He did.
Every set of beats tells of the Khan's mandate.<eos> And what do they say this night?<eos> War.<eos> "Those skilled in warfare move the enemy, and are not moved by the enemy.<eos> Get the enemy to approach by his own accord.<eos> If he's at ease, exhaust him.<eos> Well fed, starve him.<eos> Settled, move him."<eos> I never knew you gave much merit to Sun Tzu's treatise on war.<eos> I don't.
Security had no sense of romance.<eos> Finally had to buy a ticket.<eos> - To London?<eos> - Newark.<eos> It's the London of New Jersey.<eos> I can't let you do this.<eos> Okay?<eos> I can't let you walk away from this relationship.<eos> I don't think I have a choice.<eos> You do.
I was once, long ago, quite different, but I changed.<eos> And I left my past in the past, where it belongs, as you have.<eos> So, what went on between us...<eos> Was real.<eos> Yes.<eos> My feelings for you were... are real.<eos> But Marian is my wife.<eos> I loved her, and I made a vow...<eos> "Until death do us part,"<eos> and it did.
I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's a gut instinct, Nolan.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> Well, maybe his interview tonight will.<eos> If he's hiding something from the FBI, he's not gonna announce it to the whole world on live television.<eos> Ems, I respect your instinct, but I think you're looking for an easier answer.<eos> 'Cause the truth is anything but.<eos> It's hard to accept that this happened to someone that we love.<eos> But it did.
I know I do.<eos> All right, well, it's public knowledge that Mr. Clarke and entrepreneur Nolan Ross were business associates years ago.<eos> Mr. Ross, welcome.<eos> Uh, Nolan was like the son I never had.<eos> And I knew his first company would be a success, and it was.<eos> Well, because you had the courage to invest in me.<eos> An investment that paid off.<eos> I figured the profits would provide a nice nest egg for my daughter, Amanda.<eos> She never got the money, did she, Nolan?<eos> Of course she did. Of course she did.
Hey!<eos> Hey, Jaysene!<eos> Uh, now that we're done with our training,<eos> I was wondering if you wanted to, uh, go out some time?<eos> I'm sorry, I've met someone else I'm interested in.<eos> I see.<eos> Hmm. Why don't you take a little longer there, Lavon?<eos> Not like we have a fire to put out or anything.<eos> Hey, we had an understanding!<eos> No, we didn't.
Yes.<eos> Good.<eos> See you then.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Patti, you ready to come in?<eos> It's a cat?<eos> Yeah. Ha ha ha!<eos> But it has a pop tart for its body, and it's just shooting through space and it has rainbows coming out of its butt and it's just really happy about it.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> No, dad, you don't.
That's enough.<eos> Luke, why don't you go water our garden.<eos> Haley, just disappear for a minute.<eos> Well, it's not like you could help with that.<eos> Abracad-ouch.<eos> Well, it's great having Alex home, huh?<eos> So great.<eos> You don't think that she's the reason why we --<eos> No.<eos> No, I do not.
Excessive?<eos> Really?<eos> Struck by cupid's magic arrow.<eos> It's off, Lily.<eos> Seriously?<eos> Two hours rehearsing with Rosa?<eos> Cam, what is going on with you?<eos> We just had the most romantic year ever, planning our ceremony, the wedding, the honeymoon, and I'm just worried if we let this go, we'll never get it back.<eos> Well, that doesn't all just end.<eos> It did once.
We're a family of fire starters, poison eaters, and online prostitutes.<eos> It wasn't a perfect summer.<eos> It was a stupid summer.<eos> Without you here to shame me,<eos> I watched every "Real Housewives" episode and I only got to page two in "War and Peace."<eos> Please stay.<eos> We need at least one adult in this household.<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> You know the attic window is open, right?<eos> We really didn't.
Uh, it's my, uh, overnight bag.<eos> Listen, Scarlett.<eos> I got to get the hell out of this town.<eos> Can I hitch a ride with you?<eos> You up yet?<eos> I brought you some coffee.<eos> Did you ever feel anything?<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Listen, Scarlett.<eos> I got to get the hell out of this town.<eos> Can I hitch a ride with you?<eos> You up yet?<eos> I brought you some coffee.<eos> Did you ever feel anything?<eos> Did you ever love me...<eos> - At all?<eos> - Yes, I did.<eos> - I do.
I don't belong here and never did.<eos> My head literally is about to explode.<eos> You haven't given yourself time to think it through.<eos> Yeah, I have. No.<eos> Remember that whole thing? It nearly killed me.<eos> Well, yeah, but what doesn't kill you makes you stronger, right?<eos> Please stop talking.<eos> I really got to get on the road, guys.<eos> Gunnar, get out of the car.<eos> - No, you don't.
I could cover for him out there and then help you look for him after.<eos> How would that be?<eos> That's real sweet, Luke.<eos> Thank you.<eos> ♪ love goes ♪ ♪ love goes ♪<eos> ♪ she's gone ♪ ♪ I'm gone ♪<eos> ♪ To Mexico ♪<eos> ♪ a postcard from Mexico ♪<eos> I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings, dad.<eos> You didn't.
I know, goddamn it.<eos> I'm not at liberty to say.<eos> You hungry?<eos> What the hell happened to my cabinetry?<eos> Deer broke in.<eos> Huh!<eos> No shit.<eos> Try not to get trapped in there.<eos> How did you know?<eos> Uh... I didn't.
Can't let me go, won't let me die.<eos> Oh, what to do, kevin?<eos> What to fucking do?<eos> What do you want?<eos> I want you to understand.<eos> Understand what?<eos> You ever think about the 14th, 14th of October?<eos> The great vanishing? The sudden departure? The clusterfuck of the modern era?<eos> When's the last time you ever really thought about it?<eos> I don't. Me?
You guys made a sex tape after what we just watched?<eos> What did you just watch?<eos> A video of a...<eos> I can't think of anything!<eos> We saw your sex tape.<eos> You couldn't say "cat"?<eos> Half the internet is videos of cats, Will.<eos> You watched our sex tape? !<eos> Not just me.<eos> We all did.
You underestimate how much I like a challenge.<eos> You lie to me again, you no longer have an attorney.<eos> Frank, find out how the prosecution knew about Max's first trial.<eos> Whoever slipped the information could be a possible suspect.<eos> - And the rest of you, prove I wasn't wrong to hire you.<eos> I forgot.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> My boss called us into work last minute, and I'll take you to dinner this weekend instead.<eos> Boyfriend drama?<eos> I don't do boyfriends.
You're welcome.<eos> What?<eos> Don't you think that's beautiful?<eos> They don't see color.<eos> No.<eos> I think they need to be tested.<eos> But when I say it, I'm wrong.<eos> I made the team!<eos> - That's so exciting!<eos> - Of course you did.
You know, Graceland used to be a safe haven, you know... for all of us.<eos> I don't know when, but we lost that.<eos> Well, you know, it doesn't have to stay that way.<eos> Charlie, baby, turn around.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Listen, um...<eos> I want you to know that if it... if it was gonna be anybody, it would be you.<eos> I really want to keep it.<eos> You want to help me cut the peppers?<eos> Yes, I do.
I just wanted to do...<eos> Something.<eos> I'm done.<eos> We have an actual client waiting for us in court.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I hooked up with pretty much all the hot guys at boarding school, if it makes you feel better.<eos> Also, I barely remember what his penis looks like.<eos> Wait.<eos> No.<eos> I still do.
- That's your baby, amber.<eos> Good, strong heartbeat, good size, shape.<eos> Yeah, it looks good.<eos> - Oh, god. - You okay?<eos> It's just overwhelming.<eos> It's a normal reaction.<eos> Your mom must be so excited.<eos> Actually, she doesn't know.<eos> Oh, and the father?<eos> Uh, he... He doesn't either.
Hold that thought...<eos> Until I get out of here.<eos> Look, I know that was hard for you.<eos> And if it's too painful, we don't have to talk about it.<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> I'm a big boy. I can handle it.<eos> Well, in that case... ♪ I was right ♪<eos> ♪ I was right, I was right. ♪<eos> I don't know how people... Can be friends with you. I mean, I don't...<eos> I don't...
I'd actually love to get a bottle of this rose that Luke turned me on to.<eos> Eva, would you be up for some classy PBR?<eos> - It's my favorite.<eos> - Ugh. Fine.<eos> Go. But I'm staying here.<eos> I would have to lather myself in Purell before stepping into that etch-a-sketch place.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - Do you have the time?<eos> - Ew! Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.
- Ew! Do you not own a cell phone?<eos> I do now.<eos> Oh, no, you don't!<eos> This phone is my lifeline!<eos> My texts, my music, my contacts, my photos, my Twitter, my Pinterest, and my comprehensive notes dedicating my five-year plan!<eos> Back off, bitch!<eos> Hey, let your phone go!<eos> Thanks.<eos> I had it under control, Jenna.<eos> No, you didn't.
Sh! I don't know, they'll be somewhere.<eos> What you doing? !<eos> Get off me, bastard! You bastard!<eos> -Nothing... to do... with me!<eos> You wanted to see me?<eos> Put your seat belt on.<eos> -Where're you living?<eos> -Is that my son?<eos> -That's my lad.<eos> -Nothing to do with you.
He's right here inside my face.<eos> That was hostile.<eos> What, what I said is--?<eos> What about--<eos> You mean the look on her face, right?<eos> No, please don't, Louie.<eos> Please don't do it here.<eos> Don't what?<eos> - Don't start here.<eos> - Don't what?
I'm gonna think about it, so... okay?<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> I'm gonna get back to you.<eos> - Oh, you tweaked your neck again, huh? - Huh?<eos> See, that's 'cause you don't stretch.<eos> - I know it looks a little gay, but it works. - What?<eos> I'm about to go upstairs and give Junior the talk.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey, pops,<eos> - how come you never gave me the talk?<eos> - I most certainly did.
Fine, I'll whup all four of you.<eos> Okay, um... Mm-hmm. Who's going first?<eos> Uh-oh. Junior, you picked a bad day to wear shorts.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> All of you are getting an ass-whupping if Jack isn't in my room in five minutes.<eos> Guys, that's like 300 mississippis.<eos> We better go.<eos> A quadruple ass-whupping?<eos> I don't think you have the cardio stamina for that.<eos> - Oh, I don't.
I am so hungry.<eos> Boy, there's food on your fork!<eos> You know what? If everybody is so unhappy, why don't we all just go home without eating?<eos> All: Yay!<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Baby, this is the beef plantation!<eos> So, you have "roots" on laserdisc, but eating at a place called beef plantation doesn't bump you?<eos> Well, it didn't...
I really don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Of course you don't.<eos> Ignorant people never do.<eos> So, I'm shutting you down right now.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean none of that stuff I just said.<eos> I had to make it at least appear that I was setting you straight for my wife.<eos> You know, she can be a little cuckoo sometimes.<eos> - You understand, right?<eos> - I do.
'Cause it's hilarious.<eos> See, man, now he's gonna think all those messed-up stereotypes about black folks are true.<eos> Man, he'll never stop asking me if I know Jay-Z.<eos> But don't you know Jay-Z?<eos> A little bit.<eos> But that's beside the point.<eos> Man, look.<eos> All black people don't know one another.<eos> Do you know Rupaul?<eos> Yeah. I... I do, actually.
Aww, thank you, baby girl.<eos> That means a lot, and I know you meant it because you weren't looking at your phone when you said it.<eos> Wait. What?<eos> - Babe, I got to hand it to you. - Oh.<eos> You really tapped into my biggest fears.<eos> Home invasion?<eos> No. (Laughs)<eos> The thought of you guys growing up.<eos> That scares the hell out of me.<eos> Please don't do it for another 15, 20 years, okay?
Yeah!<eos> Uh...<eos> I said, "it's time for some presents!"<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Did I forget to tell you that Santa's in charge of the toy drive?<eos> Um...<eos> Yes, you did.
I'm sorry, but I'm going to be in Indianapolis.<eos> - Why? - Because we're presenting to Burger Chef Monday morning.<eos> I know the astronauts may not make it, and then what are we gonna say?<eos> Oh. I'm sorry.<eos> - They're going to be fine.<eos> - It's not fair!<eos> You know what? I'll give you the key and you can come down and watch yourself.<eos> Just don't use the stove again.<eos> I don't wanna go to Newark.<eos> - Nobody does.
I've only had sex with one person in the last 20 years.<eos> - How much do we like each other?<eos> Heh, heh. Mom came home at 2 a.m. last night.<eos> Yes?<eos> You know anything?<eos> Boss, I don't want to do this.<eos> You don't get to tell me what you want.<eos> Do you know anything or not?<eos> Boss-- You wanna keep your job?<eos> No. Yeah, you do.
I can't name my source.<eos> That's a fucking lie.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> If she went into witness protection, she was gonna send me a postcard. She never did.<eos> No, missy, she's dead.<eos> Asking if you were all in, that was wrong.<eos> You think so?<eos> I do. I think it's sexy.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> Yes, I do. I really, really do.
And if you can survive a family vacation...<eos> You're doing okay.<eos> Oh, and I did get my wish.<eos> We finally all went on a ride together.<eos> And it was the scariest ride of all.<eos> - Axl, get your feet out of my face!<eos> - Come on!<eos> It's an improvement!<eos> - You wish your face looked like my feet!<eos> - Ohh! No, I don't!
Absolutely.<eos> Good, because right now my only suspect is the devil.<eos> The victim is Silvie Pavel.<eos> She's a Stanford grad.<eos> Her father owns a successful flooring company in Glenview.<eos> Silvie was the idealist of the family.<eos> She worked for an inner-city charity called NRP.<eos> What's that?<eos> - Neighborhood Relief Project.<eos> - Mm. They did anti-gang work...
I mean, she must have been cracking up, right?<eos> That's why she was all paranoid about Richard and Silvie.<eos> So you don't think that they were having an affair?<eos> Hell no. And I told Elena that, but she wouldn't believe me.<eos> She took off upset.<eos> About what time was that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Around 9:00.<eos> The next day, she begged me not to say anything...<eos> So I never did.
Landon Jennings was killed?<eos> Did you know him?<eos> Well, of him.<eos> He's a pioneer in artificial intelligence.<eos> Don't you have some work to do in the bathroom?<eos> [Toilet flushes]<eos> Mm, sounds like your dad figured it out.<eos> - Your dad's here?<eos> I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
And make it look like Carter Humphries did.<eos> The P.O. box was Dr. Jennings' idea...<eos> A final "screw you" for sleeping with his wife.<eos> The parts came, he built the device, and we planted it in the vents.<eos> Jennings took that test every morning when you went out for scones.<eos> That way, if you had a change of heart while it was happening, you couldn't stop it.<eos> [Voice breaking]:<eos> Every day got a little more stressful, especially when his symptoms started to show.<eos> We... we both knew it was coming.<eos> And then... it did.
Trust me, so do you.<eos> Oh, that guy is tough.<eos> Oh, I've had much worse jobs... usually a hairnet involved.<eos> So, what was your worst gig?<eos> Oh, my... my worst... my worst gig?<eos> Uh, you know, it's just, um...<eos> Well, my parents always worried that a job might interfere with my studies.<eos> My big sister... she set me up with this job and I didn't show up, and now she's probably going to throw me out of her house.<eos> My big sister bought me this messenger bag.<eos> Of course she did.
If you can make this happen pretending to be a lawyer... imagine what you could do if you became a real one.<eos> We need to make sure you do.<eos> Right, Felix?<eos> Sometimes it's...<eos> Not so bad having you around.<eos> Just so you know, what I heard was, "I love you."<eos> Well, if he's choking, you're doing that wrong.<eos> No, Ama, that was a hug.<eos> "Another thing we didn't have in our village."<eos> We didn't.
You're a better bad guy than me.<eos> You do it.<eos> [Chuckling] Oh, yeah. You're Myrna, okay?<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Fine.<eos> - Your husband gets arrested. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Then later on, his buddy Lee comes over, looking for bail money.<eos> Right, and I think if Geno's so smart to save some bail money, well, then he's got to have some money hidden somewhere in this house.<eos> And you want it.<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
- Then, you have to do it now.<eos> Hello.<eos> Zbigniew Religa.<eos> Are you familiar with transplantation medicine?<eos> Kidney transplants?<eos> My son doesn't need no kidneys.<eos> But I need your son's heart.<eos> I do not give my consent.<eos> - I understand.<eos> - No, you don't.
John loves babies.<eos> And if you need a break, we could take her or we could go to St. Louis.<eos> It would be fun.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks for coming.<eos> I told John that you were at a super fun student center event that I could not miss.<eos> Well done. (Sniffs)<eos> Hey, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I did some coke.
Place call.<eos> Anya Sparks.<eos> Alan? Alan, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I just needed to talk.<eos> Oh, you know, it's-it's late.<eos> It's just, I was thinking of Katie.<eos> You're the only one in the world who understands.<eos> I understand that calling me makes you feel better.<eos> I do.
Why, what was wrong with her?<eos> Nothing, she was perfect.<eos> She was top of her class in law school, and she's an academic fellow for the united nations.<eos> Wow, so she's good enough for the entire world, but not Yolanda.<eos> But Derrick, Cheryl sounds like the one.<eos> I mean, you don't just meet somebody like that.<eos> I mean... I had that with my last boyfriend, Cooper.<eos> We had this amazing connection until, you know... He dumped me and moved to China.<eos> But, you know, the point is if you love somebody...<eos> I do!
Please!<eos> - Why don't I believe you? Here...<eos> Wrap this around his face.<eos> Hold it tight at the back of his head.<eos> - Oh, please don't do this.<eos> Please don't do this.<eos> - How long do you want to do this, huh, Lawrence?<eos> - Again. - Briggs.<eos> - No! - He knows.<eos> - What if he doesn't?
Come on. Let's get you up.<eos> Okay. - Anybody else in here?<eos> - Nope. Did you take anything?<eos> Feel free to search me.<eos> I don't think there's anything, but I drink too much.<eos> A haiku man.<eos> I like haiku.<eos> I'm gonna need your full name and address.<eos> My name's Yosa Buson.<eos> - Any I.D. on you? - I don't.
Are you a relative or something?<eos> Uh, [Clears throat] I'm a friend.<eos> Oh. Um, yeah, I just really need to talk to her.<eos> You know, I feel really bad.<eos> Came here earlier to let her know that her husband had passed away, and, ah, I screwed it up.<eos> Who died?<eos> Her husband, uh, down at the pawn shop.<eos> I'm... I'm... I'm really sorry if you were close.<eos> No, he didn't die.<eos> No, no. He did.
Nah, booze has never been my vice.<eos> Liver conditions can cause itching, so I'd like to do an ultrasound to check for gallstones, and let's draw blood for L.F.T.'s, C.B.C., chem panel, and hepatitis.<eos> And let's also get a urine sample.<eos> Look, I don't know how things work in the Hamptons, but I want you to put a rush on these test results.<eos> Oh, don't worry, we rush everyone.<eos> Doc, I'm begging you, please, if you can stop this itching, I'll comp you at my new restaurant for life.<eos> Hell, I'll put your kids through college.<eos> Either of you two have kids?<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't.
And what did He even do?<eos> The "Back to the Future" movies, uh, He worked on those.<eos> Otherwise, He's been pretty much the same.<eos> I don't know if there is a God.<eos> That's all I think you can say, honestly.<eos> I mean, you could say there is a God if you believe in it.<eos> That's-- you could just get to say it 'cause you believe it.<eos> You can't argue with somebody's beliefs.<eos> "I believe in God."<eos> "No, you don't."
Louie, come on up.<eos> Okay. Louie is gonna provide the fuel.<eos> I will provide initial combustion.<eos> Don't worry, Louie, you're safe.<eos> Okay, Louie, bend over the desk.<eos> This may be my last day here.<eos> Okay, Louie. Ready? Mm-hmm.<eos> One, two, three, fart!<eos> I thought you said you had one.<eos> I do, I just...
That's a kid!<eos> Thanks, Louie.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow for potatoes.<eos> Yes, sir, see you tomorrow.<eos> We were playing basketball in Mike's driveway... Mm-hmm. ... and I had to take a piss.<eos> So I go upstairs, and I'm walking by his parents bedroom.<eos> So the door is wide open and his mom is standing there with just a skirt on.<eos> I saw her tits.<eos> No you didn't.<eos> What if I did?
You're just kind of an idiot.<eos> Yeah.<eos> That is a fucking very valid point.<eos> So stop doing idiot things.<eos> Alvey's not wrong, Lisa.<eos> Nobody wants to put me on a fucking card.<eos> I've pissed off a ton of promoters.<eos> Do you want to fight?<eos> Fuck.<eos> Yes. I do.
I'm sorry about last night.<eos> You were wasted.<eos> Haven't seen you like that in a long time.<eos> I think it's just gonna take me a minute to get used to having Ryan here.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I'm a fucking bully.<eos> I'm a bulldozer.<eos> But I hear you.<eos> - Okay?<eos> I do.
You've been drinking.<eos> Only to remedy the lifeless monotony that has overcome this household.<eos> You know, Rebekah is still pouting over the Governor's son.<eos> When you threw him to his death, did you imagine a different outcome?<eos> You monopolize young Marcellus with schooling.<eos> He and I used to have such fun.<eos> If only there was someone with whom I could share a bit of roguery.<eos> Ah, yes. That's right.<eos> There is.<eos> You didn't.
Where is she?<eos> Where is this witch who dares craft moonlight rings without my permission?<eos> Niklaus...<eos> I've been expecting you.<eos> I must offer my condolences on the tragic loss of your child.<eos> Wasn't it your coven who threatened her life?<eos> Is that tea your idea of a peace offering?<eos> Chamomile has lots of healing properties.<eos> Did you know that it's also a flowering plant?<eos> I did.
- I want out!<eos> - I want to get out of here!<eos> - I'm gonna take that away from you unless you calm down.<eos> Calm down!<eos> Now, tell me what you want.<eos> - I want to get out of here.<eos> - OK, well, that's...<eos> That's up to the board to decide.<eos> I don't have any power over that.<eos> - If you did, your opinion...
What are you guys doing here?<eos> Blowing that bitch's cover.<eos> Eva's real name isn't even Eva.<eos> It's Amber Horn from San Pedro.<eos> She stabbed a guy in the face with a pencil.<eos> Excuse me, Hamilcrap, that is my intel.<eos> Whoa, whoa, you guys, just stop it.<eos> I know you have a thing against Eva, but you need to deal.<eos> Do you even know who she really is?<eos> Yeah, I do;
You stole these from school?<eos> That's badass.<eos> Yeah, it is badass.<eos> See, look at that- - What do you think of that, Louie?<eos> She likes badasses.<eos> Huh- - What do you think of that?<eos> So-so-So what'd I say?<eos> An ounce per scale, is that what it was?<eos> Actually, you said two ounces.<eos> Oh, I did, did I?
But careful:<eos> no contempt for poor people.<eos> What else?<eos> A faithful and devoted wife, who's tender,<eos> clean.<eos> Simply a woman!<eos> I'm repeating myself.<eos> So change the record, love.<eos> - I make a mess when I eat.<eos> - Michel does, not Mylène.
You slept in my bed... and I slept on the sofa.<eos> The drag queens...<eos> Remember?<eos> - Where's André?<eos> - He's found a nurse.<eos> I'll get solitary.<eos> You've missed the roll-call.<eos> Maybe you'll just get a reprimand.<eos> - How do you know all this?<eos> - I just do.
Nice job.<eos> Come on.<eos> You have lost your mind, Abbott.<eos> Your people hounded my client, abused her when they took her into custody.<eos> Now you want her to cooperate?<eos> There was no abuse, Ellen.<eos> I got bruises.<eos> You ran, Tish.<eos> When people do that, we chase after them.<eos> Of course she did.
I didn't plan that.<eos> I didn't seduce you in order to get you to re-administer a test to a former player of mine. That would be slightly insane.<eos> Slightly.<eos> For the record, I am capable of empathy.<eos> But my little brother... he's deaf and has loads of other medical issues.<eos> And I grew up watching my parents and all of his teachers baby him.<eos> And it didn't do him any favors.<eos> It wasn't until people stopped making excuses for him and forced him to truly try that he made any real progress.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Well, now you do.
- I'm an only child.<eos> - Damn.<eos> - That's a no.<eos> - Do you know Alan Randall?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Who... yeah.<eos> - Yeah, no, we...<eos> - no, wait, no.<eos> - Not sure I do.
Just shut your mouth!<eos> I'm not talking to you any longer.<eos> Hey, Sean, who did you call before we picked you up, eh?<eos> The feds?<eos> State troopers?<eos> Did you call the Sheriff, Walt Longmire?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> I didn't call anybody.<eos> I thought you said you and your wife had some car trouble.<eos> We did.
Your advice, your counsel.<eos> And as the syndicate moves forward, it'll only get stronger.<eos> And your involvement will be an important part...<eos> Yeah?<eos> We waited for you, John.<eos> For quite some time.<eos> Nucky?<eos> I called.<eos> Didn't you get the message?<eos> Actually, I did.
No, good call.<eos> Where is he at?<eos> Ah.<eos> So when was the last time Divya spoke to the father?<eos> Oh, I-I'm not sure.<eos> We're just good friends...<eos> And roommates and, uh...<eos> But I don't know all the details of her life.<eos> Do you know where Divya is?<eos> Oh, yes, I do.
That we know.<eos> We'll get back to you.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Fine.<eos> You have a lot of nerve showing up here.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> You told Nemec about me.<eos> It was you.<eos> You're the only one who knows I'm here.<eos> Of course I did.
Oh.<eos> Yeah, it's like a little pizza.<eos> What's up?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Did something happen between you and Erica Flynn?<eos> Why?<eos> She made a point of letting me know that it did, so did it?<eos> Actually, yes.<eos> Something did.
Jack Dawkins is on the team.<eos> He says the convoy route is clean.<eos> Every Jihadist with a copy of the Qur'an and an RPG has a hard-on for this senatorial visit.<eos> don't go on that convoy unprotected.<eos> Better to have it and not need it.<eos> Millions in selling oil to the west.<eos> I mean, you say that that gave you the ability to be who you are, to do what you do, as a direct result of Western wealth.<eos> Your arrogance is surpassed only by your naivete.<eos> You thought you knew us.<eos> You did not.
I had it on me during the attack.<eos> Something happened, and it was used on Aaron.<eos> Charlie!<eos> Aaron!<eos> In the firefight, after I got out...<eos> I didn't have it on me.<eos> Why did Vera give you a gun?<eos> He wanted me to be safe.<eos> Did you love Aaron?<eos> I still do.
Ah. Sorry.<eos> Don't worry. Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna learn more about this guy.<eos> Abigail, I'm sorry.<eos> Because it won't work.<eos> Because it can't.<eos> I've read your letter.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, she was beautiful.<eos> We all have different ways of dealing with loss.<eos> He never forgot her.<eos> What's this?<eos> "Youth. Vitality.<eos> Vigor."<eos> The ouroboros, or a snake eating its own tail.<eos> It suggests eternal renewal.<eos> I wonder if that has something to do with the condition of your father's body.<eos> Or maybe this does.
- Arthur Campbell.<eos> - Oh, I know who you are.<eos> Everybody knows who you are.<eos> I hear you've been trying to get ahold of Ryan.<eos> Is there something I can help you with while he's out of pocket?<eos> No, thank you Caitlyn.<eos> I can wait till he's back from Brussels.<eos> Ryan's not in Brussels.<eos> But you knew that already.<eos> - Yes, I did.
- I spooked her.<eos> - No, you were trying to help.<eos> Same result.<eos> Look, there are a lot of people looking for her.<eos> She won't get far.<eos> Should we go back to your room?<eos> No.<eos> And... and... and you got to get back to work.<eos> - No, I-I-I don't.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
Oi, back here, love.<eos> Hey, hey, hey. Just a heads up.<eos> Dors caught me doing a...<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> I know what you're up to.<eos> Yeah?<eos> What?<eos> You're using the garden project as a way of smuggling stuff in.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Dors.<eos> Yeah, you do.
These drawings have led - to some pretty awful stuff.<eos> - But it doesn't change the fact that my sister's drawings have always been right.<eos> We won't have to go far.<eos> An image search found possibilities in town.<eos> I've got all the red doors here in Zenith.<eos> Personally, I'm thinking the storage space, but if we're really digging into the space-time of it all, the colonial's got that whole Narnia spin.<eos> You said that you saw this in a vision? They always mean something.<eos> I think that door is the way back into the dome.<eos> Hunter, we need addresses.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm glad to hear it.<eos> Don't you want to know how much?<eos> If you'd like to tell me.<eos> $2,364,120.<eos> - That's a lot.<eos> - That's quite a lot.<eos> Did you take my advice?<eos> I'm just asking.<eos> I haven't your appetite for danger.<eos> So you didn't?
These right here, airlines and corresponding plane numbers.<eos> International airlines.<eos> So whatever they're transporting is going in and out of the country.<eos> We haven't figured out what these numbers mean yet, but we think it has something to do with where the shipment ends up.<eos> If everything is chosen at random...<eos> No one knows who's flying or where until the algorithm chooses.<eos> Cloaked in this kind of secrecy, it must be a very high value target.<eos> And without planning, it's almost an impossible heist.<eos> Unless you have the algorithm.<eos> Of which, thanks to Neal and Keller, the Pink Panthers do.
If you can't buy a beer without thinking the bartender made you.<eos> And always on the move.<eos> Always on a hustle.<eos> I thought you preferred that lifestyle.<eos> I do. But it ain't cheap.<eos> That's why I'm gonna take all the money.<eos> I-I told you we couldn't trust him.<eos> We had a deal, Keller.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> We did.
- Did you?<eos> - Yes, technically, when I told you to move up our timeline.<eos> Now, if you'll excuse me.<eos> W-wait a minute.<eos> If you--if you broke privilege, what are you gonna tell the judge?<eos> I don't know, but until I think of something,<eos> I'm going to confuse the shit out of everyone I can.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> - It makes total sense.<eos> - No, it doesn't, Your Honor.
Are you an attorney or an investment banker?<eos> I'm an investment banker.<eos> Then what the hell are you doing in my chambers?<eos> Acting as my own attorney.<eos> And no matter how much he tries to confuse the issue, he can't.<eos> I told him I was going after the same company he was, and he used that knowledge to move up his tender offer.<eos> He waived conflict.<eos> That doesn't apply to privilege.<eos> Bottom line is, he doesn't have proof of anything.<eos> I don't, but he does.
- Just tell me this.<eos> Did you refuse the deal because it wasn't good enough or because it came from Logan?<eos> You think I didn't take this deal because of your history with this asshole?<eos> Well, you did just call him an asshole.<eos> He's an asshole because he's willing to decimate a company just to put some money in his pocket.<eos> Look, I gave my word to Walter Gillis.<eos> That's what I told Harvey and what I told Logan and what I didn't think I'd have to tell you.<eos> I'm just saying, all of this could have been over today.<eos> You think I don't want this to be over?<eos> I do.
Where'd you get that?<eos> Come on.<eos> You know where I got it.<eos> Louis...<eos> I know he took your dream.<eos> I mean, she didn't even consider me.<eos> Just brings him in, had me train him, and gives him the corner office.<eos> Hey, did I ever tell you about the time that I auditioned for Hamlet in college?<eos> Obviously, you played Ophelia.<eos> No, Chrissy Kiff did.
So what's going on with Mike Ross?<eos> How do you know I'm thinking about Mike Ross?<eos> Who else would it be?<eos> He got you on the ropes?<eos> No, I got him.<eos> And he's about to go down.<eos> How do you know?<eos> 'Cause the only way to stay in the game is to get Walter Gillis to give up his dream.<eos> And you don't think he has the stomach to rip off the arm to save the body.<eos> No, he doesn't.
Sad and lonely Dina.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Hey, ref.<eos> Hey, beer guy.<eos> That's six.<eos> Need anything else?<eos> Um, I will let you know.<eos> Wow, beer guy is super hot.<eos> I guess. If you like that type.<eos> I do.
You're that new girl, from the private school.<eos> Yeah. Hi, I'm Gretchen.<eos> No one hangs out here anymore.<eos> And Lorde wants her hair back.<eos> Loser!<eos> That's not cool.<eos> You can't treat my niece that way.<eos> Forget it.<eos> Wayne, you have chocolate sprinkles on your face.<eos> I always do.
Ladies and gentlemen, if you would be good enough to look from the windows on the right of the train, you'll be able to see the soaring majesty of the Magellan black hole.<eos> Ah, I remember when this was all planets as far as the eye could see.<eos> All gone now.<eos> Gobbled up by that beast.<eos> And there's that smile again.<eos> I don't even know how you do that.<eos> I really thought I hated you, you know?<eos> Well, thank God you kept that to yourself.<eos> There was this planet, Obsidian. - Planet of perpetual darkness.<eos> - I did.
You seem like the wolves in the village.<eos> Cursed to turn when the moon is full.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> Father is beside himself with rage.<eos> It seems this...<eos> Affliction can only be passed by some kind of conception.<eos> And do our siblings share this affliction?<eos> Do you... Share this affliction?<eos> No...<eos> I don't.
Kol Mikaelson, and if you want to take down Klaus without your friends dying, well, then you'd be a fool not to listen to me.<eos> What's happening?<eos> That's mother dearest calling me home.<eos> Well, you always did know how to leave a message, mother.<eos> If only all my sons were as respectful as you are.<eos> Kol will return home soon.<eos> Elijah will wake from his slumber believing the only way to salvage his humanity is to rejoin our family, which is why it is time you bring Camile in.<eos> Here. I've spelled this to subdue her without causing bodily harm.<eos> I thought we had more time.<eos> We don't.
It would have been better than the bathroom.<eos> Your secret's safe with me.<eos> Once these people get wind of a juicy tidbit like that...<eos> You know what, I think I need to go freshen this up.<eos> Just let me get that.<eos> We have a lot to catch up on.<eos> Oh my God.<eos> Who was that?<eos> Some guy who thinks I wrote him into my book.<eos> - Did you?
So what have you got to lose?<eos> Go big or go home, right?<eos> I ran into Karma.<eos> I'm guessing from your broodiness it didn't go well.<eos> We're done.<eos> Finito.<eos> After what happened last night, there's zero chance we're ever going to get back together, and it's all my fault.<eos> Yowzer, here we go again.<eos> Liam, enough with the guilt.<eos> You didn't do anything wrong.
I'm trying to fucking work out, and I tried to ask him fucking nicely!<eos> Why is this fucking dick even here?<eos> 'Cause it's good for the gym.<eos> And you just happen to be here.<eos> Now pick up his fucking camera.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Stop saying sorry, Keith.<eos> You sound like a fucking pussy, man.<eos> Hey, Keith, why didn't you start the puzzle?<eos> I did.
Maybe I have.<eos> I'll dig them out.<eos> Well, anyway, you were delivered at Saint Joseph's because we had to move to North Hollywood when I was eight months pregnant so your dad could train some Armenian guy.<eos> Who I think has since passed away.<eos> I can't believe you don't know any of this.<eos> Yeah. I just thought it was Huntington for some reason.<eos> Well, I guess if you want to be official, you're from the Valley.<eos> But to me, you're from Venice.<eos> Hey. Lisa said you have my money.<eos> I do.
- Mom.<eos> Okay, look. Let's stop.<eos> I got it.<eos> Good job.<eos> Here.<eos> Here, drink this.<eos> So, the good news is, his knee is stable.<eos> So right now it's all about developing his strength and his lateral movement.<eos> Did he tell you he has a piece of his pelvis floating around?<eos> Uh, yes. Yes, ma'am, he did.
I could use someone like you on my crew.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well... someone, you know... strong.<eos> I'm not gonna be your henchwoman.<eos> There was no henching implied.<eos> Oh, there was hench.<eos> Was there, now?<eos> Yes, there was. Look at you, picking up on things.<eos> You must have had a feeling about that.<eos> I did, yes.
Danny, this is, Sophia Russo, one of the witnesses from the trial.<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't give you my last name.<eos> I didn't know if it was appropriate to call with the jury deliberating, but it's why I'm calling.<eos> Listen,<eos> Malcolm was a friend, and it killed me to testify against him.<eos> Can you just call me back when you get this?<eos> 818-121-8791.<eos> I really have to talk to you.<eos> Hey, I'm not here.<eos> Do your thing.
I called her back, a couple times.<eos> She didn't answer.<eos> She...<eos> She sounded funny on the phone.<eos> - Yeah, she's probably sorry.<eos> Sorry for what?<eos> - For lying on the stand.<eos> I was sitting next to you while she testified.<eos> Why didn't you say anything?<eos> I did.
Closer.<eos> Still not there, but I'm confident that tomorrow...<eos> Tomorrow, nothing.<eos> The three stooges are not gonna change their minds.<eos> This is a hung jury.<eos> Now, you tell the judge and let's all get on with the rest of our lives.<eos> I'm just sick of this shit.<eos> Can I get one of those?<eos> I didn't know you smoked.<eos> - I don't.
I don't wanna start any...<eos> I brought new photos.<eos> He let you cut his hair.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Everyone says he looks like you now.<eos> He still won't come with you?<eos> Uh, it's just hard for him.<eos> The kids at school have been...<eos> Honey, Luke loves you so much.<eos> He does.
Great to finally meet you, Avatar Korra.<eos> And this must be Mako, Bolin, and Asami.<eos> You've done your research.<eos> I make it my business to know who's visiting my city.<eos> So you're a dancer?<eos> Dancer, leader, wife, mother, collector of rare meteorites.<eos> You'll find people here have many skills and interests.<eos> Korra, why did you lie when Aiwei asked if there was anyone else with you?<eos> What?<eos> I-I didn't.
Well, hell, if those are our only choices, then, um...<eos> Let me just say the ranch is real pretty in the fall.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> All right, well, if that date is good with you guys...<eos> What do you think?<eos> All right, I know this is gonna be a long first leg, but I'm gonna get back every chance I can.<eos> You're gonna come out every chance you can.<eos> We're gonna Skype our lessons.<eos> I just don't get why Luke's making you go on tour with him.<eos> I don't, either.
- Here he is!<eos> - Luke: Hey, sorry.<eos> I got caught playing mini golf with the kids.<eos> - You missed a good game, Rayna.<eos> - I know I did.<eos> Look Wheeler, Brett from Rolling Stone.<eos> - Brett: How you doing?<eos> - How you doing?<eos> I thought this was just gonna be the two of us - taking care of all this.<eos> - I did, too.
I got a scratchy throat.<eos> Don't do this, please!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hey. You all right?<eos> Just told Brad about Micah.<eos> [Voice breaking] He doesn't want kids.<eos> Wait, you've been dating three months. You just now told him?<eos> Nobody wants to date a single mom, okay?<eos> Kiley, come on. I'm sure some guy's...<eos> No, Gunnar, they don't!
It is not about whose fault it is.<eos> Bottom line... this is inappropriate.<eos> So, I'm just supposed to stop liking him?<eos> Yeah. Yes, you are.<eos> Why, because you're afraid of what other people might think?<eos> ! No, Maddie.<eos> I am trying to protect you.<eos> Do you remember how you felt when you saw that magazine article?<eos> Remember... and the way it depicted you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
As impossible as it is to believe, based on this, they actually come out little.<eos> What are we gonna do when she gets here?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It's not like we can shuttle a newborn back and forth between your place and mine.<eos> Right.<eos> Probably shouldn't, anyway.<eos> Maybe you should just move in for a little bit.<eos> Guest room's empty.<eos> Unless you have a better idea.<eos> I don't.
Hey, dad, what song were you nominated for?<eos> Oh, uh, "ball and chain. "<eos> Luke Wheeler had a big hit with it.<eos> "Ball and chain"?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Oh, it's when you're stuck with somebody.<eos> Like my mom's stuck with me?<eos> Hey, she's not stuck with you, buddy.<eos> She just... Needed a little breather.<eos> We all do once in a while.
I don't remember that.<eos> Here we go.<eos> Just that it caught me by surprise.<eos> You know, it was just so out of the blue. Fine.<eos> You want to talk about it?<eos> Let's talk about it.<eos> My ex-wife, married to me for all of six years, took me for more than half of everything I'd ever earned in my entire life to that point.<eos> And I'm sorry about that.<eos> But that's not me, and I think you know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Mm, is he running out of cash?<eos> I can't tell you that.<eos> Did you love him?<eos> How long have you been waiting to ask me that?<eos> You know, just when you were at your weakest and most vulnerable.<eos> I did love him, but I don't love him now.<eos> I love you.<eos> Who ended it?<eos> - Does that matter?<eos> - It does to me.
You said you would, and you didn't.<eos> So either do what I'm asking, or I'll do it myself.<eos> You can't do it, Harvey.<eos> Yes, I can.<eos> Logan's gonna do it anyway.<eos> At least this way it'll be me.<eos> What's the difference if you hire somebody to look into Mike or Logan does?<eos> You know damn well they're gonna uncover his secret.<eos> I don't know that, and you don't either.<eos> - Yeah, I do.
Well, maybe you should think of something that won't ruin his goddamn life.<eos> You ready to get down to business?<eos> - Yes, I am.<eos> - Good.<eos> I was thinking that maybe we could do all this over lunch.<eos> It's 10:30.<eos> There's a lot to discuss, Jessica.<eos> No, there isn't.<eos> We need to bury them in paperwork.<eos> No, we don't.
Look, Wendy, about earlier, in the heat of the moment<eos> I might have said some dumb things and...<eos> Can't we just pretend none of that ever happened?<eos> Please.<eos> Dude.<eos> Dude.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I always kind of knew.<eos> Wait.<eos> You did?
No. No, there's, uh, too many reporters at the station.<eos> I know a place.<eos> It's not a hotel.<eos> There's a couch you could sleep on.<eos> Just nothing fancy.<eos> Okay, that's the last one.<eos> Looks like we're live.<eos> It's fancy.<eos> I didn't know the department had money for gear like this.<eos> They don't.
I can't believe I have to waste my time babysitting a bunch of grad students who probably think dark matter is what's in their diapers.<eos> This might not be that bad.<eos> Uh, you like telling people they're wrong.<eos> Wrong!<eos> Just because I enjoyed that one doesn't mean I always do.<eos> You enjoy giving people grades.<eos> A valid point, but unoriginal-<eos> - B-minus.<eos> And you love the sound of your own voice.<eos> Yeah, well, of course I do.
When I was a teenager, I started reading every book I could find on the occult.<eos> I taught myself spells, rituals, curses.<eos> I learned to conjure all kinds of dead things.<eos> Just not her.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Get ready.<eos> I told you to call my cell phone.<eos> You really don't want to be up here.<eos> Oh, yes, he does.
Previously on Girlfriends' Guide to Divorce...<eos> Jake needs to be at the book signing.<eos> He does.
Abby McCarthy is, or was...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> one of the two untouchable authors in the mommy book biz, right?<eos> - She sure was. What to expect and, of course, The Girlfriends' Guide.<eos> But now?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Wanting your husband dead?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, we all think it at times.<eos> What? - Yes, of course we do.
- Yeah.<eos> one of the two untouchable authors in the mommy book biz, right?<eos> - She sure was. What to expect and, of course, The Girlfriends' Guide.<eos> But now?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Wanting your husband dead?<eos> - Really.<eos> Well, we all think it at times.<eos> What? - Yes, of course we do.<eos> You do?
- a lot of people.<eos> - We could show it to you.<eos> - Why would we lie to you?<eos> - Because you want to shut me down for good and never wake me up, exactly like he told me.<eos> - I don't want to shut you down for good.<eos> - Yes, you do.<eos> You're afraid of what's happening to me.<eos> And Mom doesn't love me.<eos> Your mom loves you.<eos> We-we both do.
Just stop this...<eos> Ethan, where... where'd you get that?<eos> Odin gave it to me.<eos> He told me to call him if you were gonna shut me down.<eos> That he'd come get me.<eos> Ethan, give me that phone.<eos> Hey, I just want to see it.<eos> You don't want me to call him.<eos> You're right.<eos> I-I don't.
He can... get into people's minds and make them do things they don't want to do.<eos> How?<eos> Well, he has special powers.<eos> He does something to our brains that we can't understand.<eos> Not mine.<eos> This doesn't seem like a prudent course of action, considering.<eos> We're not leaving him.<eos> You said Sean was exposed to the spores.<eos> How do you know he won't contaminate the capsule?<eos> I don't.
I have a gun collection at the lodge which you might appreciate.<eos> Would you like to see it?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> - What do you think?<eos> - Let's call Ryan.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Run it by him.<eos> We're here to make the decision for him.<eos> Do you think we should take him the bid at $10 million?<eos> - I do.
Where are you from?<eos> St. Louis, but lately I feel like I live out of my suitcase.<eos> Hey, no fair.<eos> Speak English.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I was about to leave, anyway.<eos> I hate Russian food.<eos> Nice meeting you, Martine. Mmhmm.<eos> - I like her.<eos> - No, you don't.
He'd... beat me.<eos> Slap me, punch me.<eos> Uh, one time, I came home a little late 'cause I was covering for this pregnant girl I work with.<eos> [Voice breaking] He kicked me in the stomach, said he'd at least make sure I'd never be able to have a baby again.<eos> Did you ever think about leaving him or pressing charges?<eos> Preggers felt that in the baby maker.<eos> He said he'd kill me if I did.<eos> He said he'd get away with it 'cause he was a policeman and no one would believe it if he killed his wife.<eos> He told me no one would protect me.<eos> But someone did.
I'm just saying, you can do something after this that's not dealing drugs.<eos> Like, go to college, law school, even.<eos> And then after that, I'll run for office.<eos> Be the country's first ex-juvie drug-dealer bartender president.<eos> I'm kidding. I'm kidding.<eos> I know.<eos> I'll stop, okay?<eos> Stop trying to change you or whatever the hell it is you think I'm trying to do.<eos> I'll just stop trying to help.<eos> No. Don't.
The only way to stop that deal is to get her to rescind it.<eos> - Why would she do that?<eos> - She wouldn't.<eos> Unless we leak to the press something so deplorable about Griffin that it would make it politically impossible for her to move forward with the deal.<eos> We can't leak anything to the press.<eos> There's a gag order.<eos> What if I leak it?<eos> The judge will hold you in contempt.<eos> I can just say I don't know what a gag order is.<eos> But you do.
So you'd do anything to protect her.<eos> Lie, even?<eos> He's badgering my witness, Your Honor.<eos> Lying under oath is illegal, Cody.<eos> Mr. Rodriguez, this is bordering on witness intimidation.<eos> - Are you lying, Cody?<eos> - Your Honor, I ask the court to cite the prosecutor for misconduct and allow my witness to leave the stand.<eos> I'm not lying about my mother.<eos> She loved elke.<eos> We all did.
That would be bad.<eos> What exactly is in there?<eos> My work.<eos> Well, we can't have that out there.<eos> If I die...<eos> If the light takes me back, I need you to burn me.<eos> Hide me from the demons.<eos> You're not gonna die, Eleanor.<eos> I got a good doctor coming.<eos> But if I do.
That's right.<eos> Damn!<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Please don't hurt her.<eos> You know this rain is here to rid this town of nonbelievers.<eos> Now, you know that.<eos> I heard you talking to those kids at the diner.<eos> You believe.<eos> Don't you, lady?<eos> I do.
[Door opens]<eos> Justin?<eos> Justin!<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> I don't want...<eos> I don't want to have sex.<eos> That... that... that came out wrong.<eos> I do.
You can't tell Nicki that you... you gave me that move.<eos> But then how's Nicki gonna know that I gave you the move?<eos> She won't.<eos> Ever since we, you know, met,<eos> I've always thought, like, Nicki was out of my league, you know?<eos> And, please, promise me... promise me you won't say anything.<eos> Fine.<eos> Ah, I still don't know what got into you last night.<eos> [Chuckles] Well...<eos> [High-pitched voice] I do.
I'm not gonna let you ruin this weekend because you're...<eos> What's the word, again?<eos> In-secure.<eos> You're not even the kind of guy who should be in-secure.<eos> Why are you saying it like that?<eos> Insecure.<eos> In-secure.<eos> you don't think I'm, like, this overemotional, you know... sensitive crybaby?<eos> Baby bird.<eos> Of course I do.
I'm-I'm trying, but it won't come back up.<eos> I thought you said you knew how to fly it.<eos> I do!<eos> Damn it.<eos> We've lost the signal.<eos> I'm sorry, Julia.<eos> It's my own fault.<eos> When you guys started talking about tunnels, I just really wanted...<eos> I really wanted to believe there was a chance.<eos> We all did.
No.<eos> Of me.<eos> Ashamed for letting Melanie die all those years ago.<eos> Ashamed for losing faith in you.<eos> Ashamed of leaving my family.<eos> No, you didn't lose faith.<eos> I'm the one who lost faith.<eos> I didn't understand your gifts.<eos> O-O-Or that the dome had chosen us.<eos> Now I do.
- She was having trouble breathing.<eos> She just passed out.<eos> Come on.<eos> I know we've screwed up.<eos> Over and over again.<eos> But even with everything that's happened, I still choose to believe you're trying to protect us.<eos> I think that when you... stopped moving, that was your way of giving all of us another chance, so I need to ask you for one more thing.<eos> Please help Melanie.<eos> She deserves to live.<eos> Everyone in here does.
Junior, you can't leave me!<eos> Barbie, where's Julia?<eos> She's coming.<eos> She sent me up ahead.<eos> Why's everybody stopped?<eos> Nobody knows which way to go.<eos> Barbie, we need to go this way.<eos> We saw the butterfly go down there.<eos> I think it's a sign.<eos> Both Joe and I do.
That was my cuff link.<eos> - Technically my cuff link.<eos> - True.<eos> The pain in my legs and my feet?<eos> Is from gout.<eos> It's not life threatening, but you should try to avoid eating rich foods, red wine, oysters... that kind of thing.<eos> Yeah, where she's going, that won't be a problem.<eos> You're a traitor.<eos> We had a deal.<eos> We did.
California.<eos> Fine.<eos> Thank you.<eos> All right, what do you want?<eos> Chips.<eos> Okay, I have...<eos> Two dollars.<eos> What do you got?<eos> I thought you had money.<eos> I did.
- What should... what should I do?<eos> - I'm gonna stay with you til they get there.<eos> Max, blink if you can hear me.<eos> Max... Blink if you can hear me.<eos> One, two, three, four.<eos> You're like a brother to me now.<eos> I really like you.<eos> I really... really, really like you.<eos> That shirt looks great on you.<eos> Yeah, better than it does on me.
I felt...<eos> I feel like I'm normally five out of five, acting, and this was near a four.<eos> You're not a four at this point. I'm sorry.<eos> -Not even a four? -Nope.<eos> How do you think that went, Poppy?<eos> (IN MOCK LA ACCENT) Georgie, that went so well.<eos> You did so well, I have to say.<eos> Do you think you'll definitely get the part?<eos> -(IN NORMAL ACCENT) Yeah, definitely. -I think you will, too.<eos> How about we do a little role play?
How are you feeling?<eos> Like, great, amazing.<eos> I mean, your pain from the transplant.<eos> Is it still there?<eos> No. It's gone.<eos> I'm just realizing it's gone.<eos> The spikes are starting to understand that they're part of you.<eos> Wait.<eos> You make it seem like they've got a mind of their own.<eos> They do.
They're -- they're gonna get us and change us into these --<eos> No, no, no! The knife -- you still got it?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I got it.<eos> Get it out.<eos> I got it.<eos> I got it.<eos> Aim for the heart.<eos> The heart?<eos> Where's the heart?<eos> Just do it!
You look terrible.<eos> The last thing I want to do right now is go out for dinner.<eos> I'm so exhausted.<eos> Yeah, I hear that, sister.<eos> I just feel bad.<eos> You know, Sam finally made reservations at a restaurant, which he never does.<eos> I just want to have dinner in bed.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Oh, hey, did, uh, Wes sign those papers?<eos> Yeah, he did.

Yep.<eos> That is a thumb.<eos> I'll rehydrate the tissue.<eos> Any luck, there's enough left to give us that print.<eos> You two used to bone?<eos> Please don't use that expression.<eos> What, did it offend you? No.<eos> It's just inaccurate.<eos> Mr., uh, Grassi, do you know why you're here?<eos> Nope. I don't.
Mr. Grassi, please have a seat.<eos> Mr. Grassi, I want to extend my heartfelt condolences regarding your son's accident.<eos> It's a tragedy.<eos> No child should lose an appendage to a kitchen appliance.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What does... what does any of this have to do with me?<eos> Go ahead, Junior.<eos> Tell your dad.<eos> You did this to my son?<eos> No, Mr. Grassi, I didn't...
You could have sat back, stayed quiet, watched Thin Man fail.<eos> And let Heisenberg beat us to the punch?<eos> If we fall short with the combined brain power of all the Allies and a floating line of credit from the United States government, isn't there a chance that Werner Heisenberg will fall short, too?<eos> Of course.<eos> And if we fail, and Heisenberg fails, it'll never get built.<eos> We could all go home.<eos> You could have kept quiet.<eos> But instead, you walked into my office, and you sounded the alarm.<eos> I thought you should know.<eos> And now I do.
What are you doing?<eos> Hey. What are you doing?<eos> What are you...<eos> (muffled): What are you doing?<eos> You're gonna have to hold still.<eos> So do you try to capture bad guys every day?<eos> I try.<eos> Boy: But...<eos> How do you know If they're bad guys or good guys?<eos> Sometimes you don't.
You have to find it.<eos> - Cait, the chain reaction, I can't reverse it.<eos> The doors need to stay shut to protect you.<eos> You still there?<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - Caitlin, whatever happens--<eos> - Ronnie.<eos> Ronnie!<eos> He saved so many lives that day, And no one will ever know what he did.<eos> - I do.
- Daddy. - Oh.<eos> Baby, I'm fine.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> - I'll let you guys talk.<eos> - Partner.<eos> You two arrive at the same time?<eos> - Dad, we have something that we need to tell you.<eos> Dad, the thing is-- - You two are dating.<eos> I know.<eos> - You do?
- Rebecca?<eos> I mean, come on, aren't you banking a lot on this journal?<eos> Isn't that the same journal that said she killed her Vincent?<eos> Really?<eos> I don't know what happened or why.<eos> It doesn't make sense, but I'm not doing this because of the journal, I'm doing this because what does make sense is protecting Vincent from Gabe.<eos> And that's all that matters to me.<eos> I got to stop Gabe now.<eos> No.<eos> You don't.
I'm the one who found out it's not Woodall coming after us, it's--<eos> Sean Cahill.<eos> You think I didn't know that?<eos> These are my clients, and when they call in a panic, I need to be the voice on the other end of the line.<eos> Then be the voice on the other end of the line, but you're not handling the S.E.C.<eos> I'm the reason they're coming after us.<eos> Which is why you wanted to hire Jeff in the first place.<eos> That was before all this became real.<eos> Now that it's happening, he doesn't want to sit on the sidelines.<eos> Damn right I don't.
- Louis.<eos> - No, no, no. No, no, no.<eos> You once told me that my actions had consequences.<eos> Remember?<eos> Your actions yesterday have consequences too.<eos> What did you say to Gianopolous?<eos> Not much. Just that you were the person responsible for his number two leaving him.<eos> I was responsible?<eos> He agreed to it. But what he didn't know was is that it was his own lawyer who came up with the idea.<eos> Now he does.
Were you in The Lamb on the Friday before the trespass?<eos> We have people saying you were.<eos> Who?<eos> Bert Middleton.<eos> They didn't even ask me if I'd seen who did it.<eos> Well, did you?<eos> See it?<eos> He came in from the side. It was fast but...<eos> Father should have seen him coming.<eos> He didn't even...
The objective is to save the great trees, not the brushwood. Am I right?<eos> It wasn't a fire, those weren't trees, those were people.<eos> They were community-payback scum bags, I wouldn't lose any sleep.<eos> - I bet you won't.<eos> - Good to be alive, though.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Seriously, thank you.<eos> Yes, a lot of people died and maybe the wrong people survived.<eos> - Yeah, but we saved the world, right?<eos> - We did. - You did.
'I had...<eos> I had promises to keep.'<eos> Hey. Hey. I got your message.<eos> Two weeks late.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Improving.<eos> I see you've got news for me.<eos> News? He figured it out then?<eos> PE figured out there was a way home.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did.
I see you've got news for me.<eos> News? He figured it out then?<eos> PE figured out there was a way home.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, he did.<eos> Oh, good old PE.<eos> He'll make a maths teacher yet.<eos> Listen, Doctor.<eos> There's something that I have to tell you and, um... ..it's not good news so just listen, OK? I know.<eos> Sorry? I know exactly what you've got to tell me.<eos> You do?
Really want their money, huh?<eos> Well, half of it goes to city hall, lines a lot of pockets.<eos> - Actually, sir, there was<eos> - Or you guys... police.<eos> Helps fund your investigations.<eos> Well, it's... it's not about the toll.<eos> So, um, it's... it's a possibility you might have witnessed something today.<eos> You know, one of your neighbors saw the car and called it in.<eos> No, I didn't see anything important.<eos> I don't... no.
You're just making this up right now, aren't you?<eos> - No way!<eos> - No way, McKibben.<eos> Sadie, do this for me.<eos> I really like this girl.<eos> If you have to pretend to be all harmless to win her over, then clearly, you've picked the wrong girl.<eos> - Again!<eos> - I'll pay your way.<eos> You have to pay for Sergio, too.<eos> Done!
It's great.<eos> We're teachers.<eos> We're parents.<eos> We're horse owners.<eos> And every morning we wake up, - that's all we got to be. - (phones buzzing)<eos> That's a shock.<eos> Well, this can't be good.<eos> The, uh, Secretary of State's plane just went down over the Atlantic.<eos> I thought we said no gadgets at the table.<eos> ELIZABETH: We did.
Unser's here.<eos> He needs to talk to us.<eos> - OK. - I got him.<eos> Hey. Um, thanks for...<eos> - thanks for not saying anything. - Yeah.<eos> I love him.<eos> You don't even know him.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> I... you must've loved Jax when you were together.<eos> I still do.
I wasn't rubbing anything in anyone's face.<eos> Oh, bullshit.<eos> You have leverage, and you want to make sure he knew it.<eos> And when he had leverage, he made sure I knew it, and I didn't agree to a deal, and then break my word ten seconds later.<eos> And I'm giving you my word.<eos> Close this deal, and as soon as it's wrapped up, he's out.<eos> And what about Jessica?<eos> Is she gonna agree to it?<eos> Let me deal with Jessica.<eos> Oh, just like you did on wexler.
I sold my interest to Logan Sanders.<eos> What the hell you talking about?<eos> That wasn't our deal.<eos> What can I tell you?<eos> When you're the biggest bully in the yard, people give you their lunch money without you even asking for it.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You son of a bitch.<eos> You promised me that I would control what happened to that company.<eos> I promised you if we won.<eos> We didn't.

- What?<eos> - The briefcase.<eos> Why you got to mess with the briefcase, man?<eos> You had one...<eos> Johnny, Johnny, slow up.<eos> What are we talking about here?<eos> Where's Lucia?<eos> She's with Carlito, thanks to you.<eos> What, you just let him take her?<eos> I didn't... yeah.
We're closed tonight for a private event.<eos> I'm not here for a latte.<eos> I need to talk to you.<eos> Uh, I'm actually kind of busy right now.<eos> Yeah, it sounds like you've been busy.<eos> Being the kind of scumbag Who's begging to get his ass kicked. Excuse me?<eos> Do you hit on all of aria's friends or is it just hanna?<eos> So I'm guessing you're the boyfriend.<eos> I respect you coming here.<eos> Seriously, I do.
Well, maybe you should tell us where this is.<eos> You know, just in case anything were to happen to you.<eos> Good-bye, hanna.<eos> Be careful please. I will.<eos> Aria's right.<eos> If you identify this guy, it will be way too easy For "a" to prove that you're lying.<eos> We don't even know who this cyrus person is Or where he came from.<eos> I get it, em.<eos> Okay?<eos> I do.
Take off your seatbelt, hanna.<eos> We're not here to follow her. We're here to follow him.<eos> What did you say to her?<eos> That her actions have consequences.<eos> What about yours?<eos> Were you even listening when I asked you Not to talk to her?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> And you sought her out anyway?<eos> I...<eos> I didn't...
There had to be a duplicate set.<eos> Ali wasn't walking around naked.<eos> Are you saying it was always someone's idea that Bethany take Ali's place?<eos> Tell me another way that Bethany ends up in that yellow top.<eos> We need to figure out a way around that picture of "A"<eos> at the hospital or we're busted.<eos> What picture of "A"?<eos> Picture of Alison.<eos> No, you said a picture of "A".<eos> No, I didn't.

That's wolfsbane?<eos> I thought it was purple.<eos> Not this species.<eos> Which is very rare and very expensive.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> "Don't screw up"?<eos> Don't miss.<eos> Okay, all you have to do is nick him. It'll work fast.<eos> Even on an Alpha.<eos> We gonna do this again?
What did he say?<eos> What exactly did he say?<eos> I can't remember, he came out of left field.<eos> He asked me if I had a hot date, and I said no.<eos> And he said, "well, it's too bad" that Elizabeth is stuck here with her family."<eos> It's not like he said,<eos> "Kyle, I know you're sleeping with my wife."<eos> Trust me, Liz, he knows.<eos> Can we...<eos> And now... so do we.
- Hey. - You're back.<eos> According to the FBI, this is where I live now.<eos> Was it fun to see your friends?<eos> Yeah, loads of fun.<eos> Even made a new one.<eos> Guy in a silver Subaru who sat in his car all day watching me.<eos> My God.<eos> I hope you got his license.<eos> As a matter of fact,<eos> I did.
Okay, well...<eos> Let me know if you find anything.<eos> Absolutely, I'll look into this.<eos> Carter wants yogurt.<eos> Great.<eos> Go, have fun.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey, yo, try some Fro-Yo.<eos> Do you know what you want?<eos> Um, yeah, yeah, I do.
I was in a coma?<eos> It was a little coma.<eos> Just long enough to scare us all to death.<eos> Why does all the fun stuff happen to you?<eos> Abduction, seizure, coma.<eos> I kissed Gabe, didn't I?<eos> Yes, you certainly did.<eos> Taylor...<eos> I really don't like him.<eos> Except, you do...
Thank you.<eos> I'm not staying but I...<eos> I, I just wanted to give you this.<eos> Hey, Armadillo.<eos> Hey, you're up.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I should've told you this sooner.<eos> Because then maybe you wouldn't be here.<eos> Elizabeth didn't take your backpack.<eos> I did.
Are you still a Kitsune?<eos> Technically.<eos> These are your grandmother's ashes.<eos> Grandma died in Eichen House.<eos> Your father had a difficult relationship with his mother.<eos> But after the things she said, and the way she acted...<eos> He thought she was crazy.<eos> Well, she said she heard things.<eos> Why did she want her ashes in here?<eos> Well, actually, she didn't.
But is it still just professionals?<eos> I don't think Haigh's ever tried anything like this.<eos> I think he was taking a chance.<eos> That means anyone with the dead pool could take a chance.<eos> But if Haigh had it, then who else does?<eos> How easy is it to get this thing now?<eos> Meredith was only there *** once.<eos> But I think once was enough.<eos> How did your grandmother know her?<eos> She didn't.
He put it online.<eos> He took the money from the Hale Vault, then turned the bearer bonds into cash.<eos> He made the payments.<eos> Was it Brunski's idea to fake your death?<eos> Did he get nervous because you helped us with one of the cipher keys?<eos> I wanted to help.<eos> All you ever wanted to do was help.<eos> Is that why you're here?<eos> I know you wouldn't want to be here if you didn't want to talk.<eos> I do.
- Ryan's fine.<eos> - Everything's under control.<eos> - Says you.<eos> I have a card I have to promote, okay.<eos> I'm doing a press event in a couple of days.<eos> I want Alvey and him to be there. You know, I get it.<eos> I completely understand.<eos> Man, I tell you, it's like spinning plates all the time.<eos> - Nothing ever works out, you know.<eos> - I do.
- Hey.<eos> - You're back.<eos> According to the FBI, this is where I live now.<eos> Was it fun to see your friends?<eos> Yeah, loads of fun.<eos> Even made a new one.<eos> Guy in a silver Subaru who sat in his car all day watching me.<eos> My God.<eos> I hope you got his license.<eos> As a matter of fact, I did.

- I can't forget about this dream.<eos> - Why does it worry you?<eos> - It's difficult...<eos> With you, I can be frank.<eos> - I have a nephew...<eos> - I know.<eos> You love him, you tell us about him.<eos> Our words can contradict our thoughts.<eos> Out of family duty, I say I love him.<eos> When you actually don't?
Do what you wish.<eos> I'm ready for anything.<eos> You will be my pride... my glory.<eos> I will be your father.<eos> Follow me.<eos> I have scripts at home.<eos> I'll read them to you.<eos> Tonight, I dub thee... actress.<eos> - Did you speak to him?<eos> - Yes, I did.
Are you in there?<eos> Mirror, mirror on the wall, who's the most dangerous of them all?<eos> There's been a spillage in Geography, I need some paper towels.<eos> Can't you read?<eos> Course I can read.<eos> Read what?<eos> The door.<eos> It says, "Keep Out."<eos> No, it says, "Go Away Humans."<eos> Oh, so it does.
Technically, that is true.<eos> That is true technically.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> No, I don't believe there should be.<eos> You do not speak for the library.<eos> Is there not to be an intercession?<eos> Intercess all you want, mate, as long as I'm intercessing with my double cheese, extra pep.<eos> I'm assuming he doesn't have my pizza on him.<eos> No.<eos> No, he does not.
Where is he?<eos> Fun fact, we have no idea.<eos> Fun fact, I got a warrant for his arrest.<eos> - On what charge?<eos> - At the moment, kidnapping.<eos> I anticipate an upgrade to murder, but that's just me.<eos> We've become aware of certain emails and texts he sent to Rose Marquez.<eos> Threatening ones.<eos> If you know where he is, you should tell us.<eos> We don't.
You planned this whole thing?<eos> You took the bait.<eos> I know you better than you do.<eos> I only wanted to be alone.<eos> I tried.<eos> I tried and I tried.<eos> Mr. Martin...<eos> She was never the girl I needed her to be.<eos> You understand.<eos> I do.
You're a psychopath.<eos> Yeah...<eos> Maybe.<eos> They say a lot of CEOs are.<eos> It's good for business.<eos> It's about Frank.<eos> What about him?<eos> He's in trouble.<eos> You know where he is now?<eos> - We do.
Like the fact that I never read Paradise Lost.<eos> Hey, Pete.<eos> Those drinks aren't on the house.<eos> I can't keep covering you.<eos> Yeah, I know, I know.<eos> I just...<eos> I rolled out and forgot my cards.<eos> I'll get you back.<eos> - You said that last time. - No, I didn't.<eos> Uh, yes, you did.
Whoa.<eos> You. Granny.<eos> Those aren't yours, and you know it.<eos> I'm a cop, so listen up.<eos> I saw what you put into your washing machine.<eos> You had two sets of sheets, a terrycloth robe, three sets of pajamas, five sheets.<eos> No kids clothes.<eos> Give them back.<eos> And you.<eos> You did three loads... all boys clothes.
- Not here. - Aw, I could've sworn it was right here.<eos> - He's got no s...<eos> You've got no sense of direction.<eos> I mean, like, zero.<eos> We went to Venice.<eos> We walked around and around in circles.<eos> Then we went on one of those little can...<eos> I mean, it was just...<eos> Do you know...?<eos> He doesn't.
We're so sorry.<eos> Maybe I could have helped if I'd known, but I'm still in the middle of things with immigration, and we're under such scrutiny, he must have been afraid any publicity would've endangered Monika.<eos> - How's she doing?<eos> - I've offered her a job in our home and, if she wants, some help to stay in the country.<eos> The other women will all have representation as well.<eos> Thank you again.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> You were right.<eos> People change.<eos> Fletcher Sayers did.
It's me, Rush.<eos> It's Manny.<eos> I'm off the clock, Manny.<eos> I...<eos> I know, bro, I know.<eos> There's been some trouble, Rush.<eos> Some business associates of mine, they...<eos> Business associates?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I do.
"An ink blot?<eos> Look harder."<eos> "An...<eos> "An ink splash with dots around it.<eos> "Yes.<eos> Is that it?"<eos> "No, hang on, Charlie.<eos> "Do you see an image?<eos> "Hidden in the ink blot?<eos> "Other people do.
They're cryin' to their mamas.<eos> They ain't got a gun, nothin'.<eos> We jump a couple sentries, and then it's just bam...<eos> Bam... bam...<eos> Bam...<eos> All dead.<eos> That's finished.<eos> The war ended.<eos> Damn, Bohannon, they had it comin'.<eos> They did, right?
I had a couple of unis hang out to keep an eye on things.<eos> We need to get over there.<eos> - WOMAN: 911.<eos> - Lieutenant Burns, Major Crimes, requesting a 10-13.<eos> Officer shot at 1216 163rd Street.<eos> Carrie.<eos> There was a car right here.<eos> A rental.<eos> You got the plate?<eos> Uh, I... I... I didn't...

Get that bread you like, with the cheese.<eos> We could head down to the water and...<eos> Pretend.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe.<eos> That'd be nice.<eos> - Let someone else be cops for a while. - Oh...<eos> You've done enough.<eos> Give Jo time to find the antidote, let us all take over.<eos> What if she doesn't?
- Costing Henry billions.<eos> Sarkov said her lab hadn't cracked the cloaking technology, but what if Will did with a little help from his neighbor, Henry?<eos> And with a functioning suit, Henry could've enlisted Will's help to get revenge against Talmadge.<eos> But Henry still needed help defeating Talmadge's home security.<eos> Invisibility doesn't defeat thermal or pressure systems.<eos> So, they hustled Jiggy while Henry was wearing that invisibility suit.<eos> Henry is the one that was moving the cue ball around the table.<eos> And perhaps once Henry realized the power of the suit, he set his sights on Will, making sure that power would never be taken away.<eos> Okay, how do we find this kid?<eos> We don't.
I've been really worried.<eos> Yes, I know, and I think I know why.<eos> Because I disappeared.<eos> But... I'm back now, and I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'm here to stay.<eos> I just keep thinking I'll lose you again, or something terrible will happen.<eos> I know it sounds crazy...<eos> No, no, it does not sound crazy.<eos> I would feel the same way.<eos> Matter of fact, I did.
That's no prediction.<eos> Sorry I asked.<eos> But as you're aware,<eos> I am convinced of your paranormal powers.<eos> I have denied them.<eos> Tell me, Bess, do you believe that Harry, here, is the possessor of supernatural powers?<eos> Over me he sure does.<eos> I believe when we first met,<eos> I told you I was a clairvoyant.<eos> Yes, ma'am, you did.
Your mother committed suicide.<eos> No, he made her do that, all right?<eos> !<eos> She... she was fine before, okay?<eos> And my mother...<eos> I never got the chance to tell her...<eos> I said some really terrible things to her.<eos> Listen to me, Connor.<eos> I'm a mother, and I promise you, your mother knew you were sorry.<eos> No, she didn't.
We're not immortal.<eos> Cherish your time together.<eos> Alex...<eos> What happened?<eos> Michael's life lessons.<eos> Did you... scatter Bixby's ashes?<eos> In the garden under a jacaranda tree.<eos> In the spring, it's gonna be full of purple flowers.<eos> I thought she was gonna make it through.<eos> Yeah, we all did.
I'm here for you.<eos> I'm never going to let you go.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> The revolution has already begun.<eos> Chaos is the natural order of<eos> You see what I did there?<eos> I put a sock in it.<eos> Literally.<eos> Classic Bolin.<eos> I do what I do.
For he commands us to love our God, as well as our neighbor.<eos> Do you love your God?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you love your neighbor?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did not love my neighbor this week.<eos> I sat in judgment on my fellow man.<eos> I reveled in the pit of my own self-righteousness.<eos> So I deserve to be cast out into darkness, and I do not deserve salvation.<eos> None of us does.
Tell me, what does my uncle want with these tribal leaders?<eos> He is bringing them to the retreat in the desert, where, either by bribe or force, he will enlist their support for his plan to unseat you and install himself.<eos> You have been Tariq's right hand... why not stand with him in this?<eos> Look around you.<eos> All of this is ruin of the past.<eos> That's his way.<eos> Your way is about the future.<eos> A future I want for my country, my people, my children.<eos> Do you have officers you can enlist... men you trust?<eos> I do.
- What? Terrorism Prevention...<eos> - And if I call the police...?<eos> - Yeah... Of course.<eos> Here... use my phone.<eos> The number's 999.<eos> No.<eos> Actually... I'll use our phones.<eos> If you think that's best.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do!
Can you identify any of these men?<eos> Him.<eos> H-Hold on a second here.<eos> We're-we're talking about police officers from Juárez.<eos> You gonna protect her?<eos> - Did you arrest Robles?<eos> - It's not that easy, Sonya.<eos> Why?<eos> Mexico City has Eva's affidavit.<eos> No, they don't.
Whoever clocks the fastest four laps is gonna get their shot at the big time.<eos> Well, I'm happy to report your EKG is completely normal, but your left arm is weaker than your right arm, which is most likely Musculoskeletal in nature, anything from a strained ligament to an irritated nerve<eos> to a muscle tear.<eos> But to be safe, I'll keep an eye on you until the time trial is over.<eos> Great.<eos> In the meantime, can I get back to fine-tuning machines instead of being hooked up to one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In a second.<eos> I barely had anything to drink.<eos> I didn't... a couple sips of wine with a pairing menu.
Find out everything you can about them.<eos> And work on that poker face.<eos> I can always tell when you're lying.<eos> Careful, Becca.<eos> - That's awful.<eos> - Awful?<eos> The person who did this should get a big fat reward.<eos> You think this is a good thing?<eos> Angels dying?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Jesus?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> Somebody slashed this inflatable snowman.<eos> - Well, it wasn't me.<eos> - Now listen here, sonny.<eos> I've won this contest three years in a row and I never had any problem with vandals until you decided to enter.<eos> So be warned, I will sit up all night to protect my decorations and my property.<eos> And anyone who trespasses will have me and the end of a baseball bat to contend with.<eos> - You didn't... ?
Lena Adams Foster...<eos> Do you like them?<eos> They're beautiful.<eos> Let me see!<eos> Diamond earrings?<eos> !<eos> I want diamond earrings.<eos> Are you sure you like them?<eos> No...<eos> Yes, I do.
How's this gonna work?<eos> What you mean, Ray?<eos> How do I know for sure... you're not gonna hurt my kid?<eos> You don't.<eos> I didn't think so.<eos> Drop it.<eos> Drop the fucking gun.<eos> There's a million dollars on that table.<eos> $500,000, if you split it.<eos> A million if you don't.
We're dealing with a cult here.<eos> A Fae cult.<eos> Dyson, those three bodies from the elevator crash...<eos> They were taken the other night.<eos> Three ritual killings.<eos> Three missing bodies.<eos> There could be a connection.<eos> You have anything with the missing bodies with the scent?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
And you endangered her and her daughter For what, for a lousy payday!<eos> Not a payday.<eos> It's my ticket out.<eos> Of what?<eos> A.R.G.U.S.!<eos> You don't know the things waller's made me do.<eos> The person she turns you into.<eos> That still gives you no right To put a bulls-eye on my family's back!<eos> I had no choice.<eos> But you do, john.
Then you have them.<eos> - Rachel, are you okay?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - Where are you going?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I just can't be here, and I can't be at home.<eos> I can't be anywhere.<eos> Go see him.<eos> I don't even know where he is.<eos> Yes, you do.
Mike Ross is not coming back to this firm.<eos> You heard Louis.<eos> He already gave him the job.<eos> He can un-give him the job.<eos> It's too late for that, and you know it.<eos> Well, it damn sure didn't help when you jumped on in there and told him it was a great choice.<eos> It was a great choice, and if I hadn't jumped in and let you speak your mind, you know what he would have heard?<eos> Something's wrong with Mike Ross.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do, and so do you.
And if you go to Jessica to try to overrule me, the next time, it won't be Mike you get in a fight with.<eos> It'll be me.<eos> [Melancholy music]<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> You're home.<eos> I am.<eos> Why aren't you at work?<eos> Because I spent the whole day moving from one place to another, and I just had to talk to you.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> I didn't.
That's not what I asked.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Of course I want the baby.<eos> It's your child, so it's my child.<eos> You look so surprised.<eos> I guess I am.<eos> A little.<eos> My sister has to stop calling.<eos> I'll take care of it.<eos> Luisa, he really doesn't...
- It has...<eos> - The journals.<eos> They gave me the strength to survive.<eos> Hopefully they'll do the same for you, and maybe you'll understand why I did the things that I did.<eos> You spent three years fighting for a family that was right in front of you.<eos> And instead of embracing me, you used me and lied to me?<eos> Charlotte...<eos> Do you hear yourself? You chose revenge over me.<eos> I didn't think I had the choice.<eos> Well, you did.
I'm afraid he is.<eos> How?<eos> Did... how did that happen?<eos> We're waiting for the autopsy, but until we figure out cause of death, we're investigating it as a possible homicide.<eos> Tell us what happened last night.<eos> How'd you hurt your wrist?<eos> I fell.<eos> Does it hurt?<eos> Whoa, looks like the bad guy's winning.<eos> He always does.

Did Frank say anything to you about Reed?<eos> He said that Reed was the most brilliant man he'd ever met.<eos> Ma'am, the car's out front.<eos> Take care of Frank.<eos> He's on the throne now.<eos> That's what really killed Reed, you know?<eos> The Gadget.<eos> I don't know how many different ways I can say this.<eos> Even if I had known about an inside man in Werner Heisenberg's staff...<eos> - Which you didn't.

You also are acquainted with a Professor Richard Lavro who traded his office at Harvard for one in Stalin's atomic research division, an association you misrepresented the last time we met.<eos> If Charles Isaacs is not a spy, we'd expect him to be forthcoming and cooperative, and yet you have lied since the moment you set foot into this room.<eos> So I'm your unified theory. Is that right, genius?<eos> That every scientific failure, every intelligence slip up, I'm singlehandedly responsible?<eos> I'm not so sure it was singlehanded.<eos> The Perlmans are your wife's cousins?<eos> What role did Abby play in all of this?<eos> Paul.<eos> Didn't think you had the first idea where I lived.<eos> I didn't.
I occasionally see this movie director guy.<eos> Gross.<eos> One time, he booty-texted me from some awards show.<eos> I was already at the bar, so I drove over to his house, and then he texted me he was going to be late, so I idly drove around his neighborhood... until I kind of sideswiped an off-duty cop.<eos> Do you know, I'm glad this is a one-night thing, so we can reveal all this awful shit about ourselves.<eos> Totally.<eos> High five.<eos> I'll get that.<eos> Okay, I like that.<eos> All girls do.
Damn it.<eos> That's good, too.<eos> * Don't look ahead There's stormy weather... * You know, right before Becca broke up with me, I started reading her e-mail.<eos> Oh, I've done that.<eos> So even though I had warning, when she broke up with me, it kind of... just kind of knocked me out.<eos> Even though she's clearly a ridiculous human being, you know?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Break-ups hurt.<eos> I've heard.<eos> I don't really do relationships.
She said that the money would come.<eos> The master bedroom!<eos> We were gonna grow old together in that house, you know, raise a family, be happy.<eos> - Break it in?<eos> - Break it in!<eos> And that's what I wanted.<eos> Really good.<eos> It was the American dream, if that even exists anymore.<eos> But that day, I totally believed in it.<eos> We both did.
Some forces are too strong.<eos> You had a lousy father.<eos> I mean he was weak.<eos> I-I mean you are not.<eos> I-I mean you're strong.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I hope it.<eos> Look... I just need a night here before I continue my journey, but I'll stay tomorrow and help, if that's what you want.<eos> Just meet me in the morning at the barn, and we can continue training.<eos> But if you don't...
Pop?<eos> Francis, I'm in the sunroom.<eos> I'm having a whiskey.<eos> You want one?<eos> We have a guest.<eos> Well, does he want one?<eos> No, she doesn't.
Let's go, Evan.<eos> What's with you smelling like vetiver?<eos> What's with you knowing what vetiver smells like?<eos> Let's give Hank some privacy.<eos> - It's vetiver.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Who's that?<eos> Seems like they've met before.<eos> Yes, it does.
From who?<eos> Eiling?<eos> Eiling is a dangerous man, Barry.<eos> We do not want him as an enemy.<eos> After the lighting bolt, what if you hadn't found me?<eos> It could've been me.<eos> Hunted, on the run, cut off from everyone I know and care about.<eos> You guys saved me.<eos> And I want to save her just as bad as you do, Barry.<eos> We all do.
Watching each breath they take, praying it won't be their last.<eos> To hold your daughter's hand, trying to memorize what it feels like so you won't forget.<eos> Your daughter too scared to close her eyes, even when she's so tired, because she's worried she won't be able to open them again.<eos> Some things you just can't fix.<eos> You got to live with them.<eos> You don't take innocent lives.<eos> We shouldn't be listening to this.<eos> That man deserved to die.<eos> They all deserved to feel my pain!<eos> No, they didn't.
Well, Adam made it sound pretty serious.<eos> Well, Adam's a worrier and always has been and so is your mom.<eos> And that's why they get together, so they can worry each other out.<eos> All right, well, to be honest, I'm pretty worried too.<eos> It's your heart.<eos> I mean, this mitrial gurgle...<eos> Martrial gastral...<eos> No, no.<eos> Crosby, do you even know what mitral regurgitation is?<eos> No, I don't.
I hope you're hungry.<eos> I think I over-ordered again.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I think I'm ready for round two.<eos> Couldn't get in touch with my accountant.<eos> He's got all my files.<eos> Brought you everything I had at home.<eos> Did Grace ever get that job?<eos> She mentioned something about a presentation or something a while back.<eos> She did, didn't she?
Get her some air and remind her of the rules.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Hanging all over my guests.<eos> And her?<eos> She was practically unconscious.<eos> I thought that's what this party was all about.<eos> You think that's what I wanted to see from you?<eos> You're here because of who you are, not because of who you think I want you to be.<eos> Well, I wanted to show you that I know what I'm doing.<eos> But you don't.
Gentleman, don't turn this diner into a trial.<eos> Let's change the matter.<eos> Tell us about your management?<eos> Tell us why, since your arrival, local incomes have fallen 50 per cent.<eos> 70 per cent!<eos> That's right! Explain why merchants prefer to border our city.<eos> We want an explanation.<eos> Rather a clarification, because we're losing a lot of money.<eos> - Let's see...<eos> - Do your best!
A lifeline?<eos> You're the one that threw me overboard.<eos> - Mike-- - And why did it have to be him?<eos> I don't need you to keep telling me that you're sorry or to be charming or anything else.<eos> I just need to get that image out of my head.<eos> - Did you get it?<eos> - No.<eos> A little heads up would have been nice.<eos> I don't exactly have a backup plan.<eos> - Well, good thing I do.
I was the one he wanted to laugh at.<eos> But you got the last laugh, right?<eos> I mean, you caught him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's on death row.<eos> Just lost his last appeal.<eos> Scheduled to be executed next week.<eos> So, what?<eos> You think someone's decided to pick up where your boy left off?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I do.
Does that include playing at being a CSI?<eos> Processing your own crime scenes?<eos> That was me just having a little fun with my friend, Mr. Russell.<eos> Right down to stalking his daughter?<eos> How is Maya?<eos> Those last three girls you killed, where are their bodies?<eos> 'Cause the families want closure, right?<eos> But... this ain't the movies.<eos> And, trust me, they do not want to see them now.<eos> But maybe someone else does.
That's right.<eos> They're gonna question your motives there.<eos> They'll question your motives here.<eos> Yeah, just like you did.<eos> Not to mention this new DNA evidence.<eos> Yeah, which didn't come back to Briscoe or his twin, but to an unknown male, who probably is the real killer.<eos> Maybe.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> You still think the twins are behind this?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's right.<eos> Hypotheticals only.<eos> - The one with the silver teeth.<eos> - Jim Lenard.<eos> He'll make a good witness...<eos> He's likable.<eos> So is Trey.<eos> Trey was the one wearing the wire.<eos> You said you didn't know who was wearing the wire.<eos> I didn't, until today.
Shouldn't be too long.<eos> All right.<eos> You bring another police escort?<eos> Just us bad guys.<eos> We had nothing to do with the sheriffs.<eos> Of course, you gunned them down, so now they're everyone's problem.<eos> We hear the bitch lived.<eos> Yeah, unfortunately.<eos> But she is critical and not talking.<eos> And if she does?
Be careful.<eos> I will.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> That was Ryu.<eos> Lin will meet us.<eos> All right, good.<eos> Okay, I put Barosky on notice.<eos> He wants another five grand for the personnel.<eos> Of course he does.
Where's Milner?<eos> Wilson, you need to take them seriously.<eos> What they're saying is...<eos> - Where is Milner?<eos> - What, you gonna torture us, Wilson?<eos> Yeah. I might. I might do, Becky.<eos> Russian flu is real.<eos> It's some psychopathic weaponised virus from the '60s... and they're going to release it, did you know that?<eos> - What?<eos> You did?
Connor shows up for a duffle full of cash.<eos> Yeah, he will.<eos> I'll set it up.<eos> Hey.<eos> Sorry to bother you.<eos> Um, I just got a call from your grandfather's nursing home.<eos> I guess Gemma's visiting her dad.<eos> Really.<eos> I didn't know that.<eos> Yeah, well I didn't, either.
I pulled these bullets from the ceiling at the bank.<eos> I tested them and they were fired from your gun.<eos> OK, you got us on that.<eos> - You also killed a man. - Killed?<eos> W... what are you talking about?<eos> We shot into the ceiling, just like you said.<eos> I'm not talking about the bank robbery.<eos> I'm talking about the train robbery.<eos> - We didn't actually rob the train.<eos> - Yes, you did.
- Great.<eos> Uh, it's not a date.<eos> We're just hanging out.<eos> I think it kind of might be a date.<eos> Yeah, you guys should definitely come.<eos> Okay, great.<eos> All right.<eos> Just, uh, text me the deets.<eos> - They still say that, right?<eos> - They do.
No.<eos> It's really not.<eos> I thought it was a band.<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> I feel like I can't keep up, Paige.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - I just learned how to perfectly express myself in 140 characters.<eos> Now I have to condense everything into a 7-second...<eos> - What is it called... "vine"?<eos> - No, Evan, you don't.
My eye is killing me, but my feet are fine.<eos> Well, in a day or two, the pain will wear off substantially.<eos> Here, have some water.<eos> You know, I'm really glad I'm doing this.<eos> I'm glad you're glad.<eos> When will you be back for the second surgery?<eos> A couple weeks.<eos> I have some business to sort out at home.<eos> Will you miss me?<eos> I already do.
So it's literally out of my hands.<eos> That's my exact sense of humor.<eos> I like your beard.<eos> Thank you.<eos> It keeps my face warm.<eos> Uh, can I ask you a question?<eos> Mm-hmm. Does it tickle when you kiss?<eos> I guess there's only one way to find out, isn't there?<eos> Yeah. Yeah. You know what?<eos> It actually does a little bit, yeah.
I don't know what you heard, but let me set things straight.<eos> In order to get my job back, I put myself out there as dirty.<eos> I never agreed, nor did I ever report on another cop.<eos> - I know what you're feeling.<eos> - You don't.
Broken glass gets into the pool, I got to drain the whole thing.<eos> - It's... it's a nightmare. - Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm Degranzo. I own the hotel.<eos> It's a nice place you got here.<eos> What brings you out here?<eos> Ah, I'm taking the day off.<eos> Hey, you know what? Good for you. Good for you.<eos> We don't do that enough as a culture.
Your dad just texted.<eos> He said he's okay. He's safe.<eos> Obviously, this is a really fucked-up thing to do, but it's not entirely his fault.<eos> I don't know if Jay told you, but he stopped taking his medication.<eos> No, he didn't.<eos> - Why would he stop?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - I thought it was helping.<eos> - I know. I did, too.<eos> He just did it.
I wanted to talk to you about getting married.<eos> - Is this a proposal?<eos> - Of a sort, yes.<eos> Rosalie.<eos> I knew I had the right size.<eos> What the hell is going on here?<eos> It's, uh, it's beautiful.<eos> - You really like it?<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> Of course she does.
I'll just wait until you're through.<eos> Don't mind me. Get out of here.<eos> Not until we talk.<eos> Whatever it is you want to say can wait till I'm not on the toilet.<eos> No, it can't.<eos> Fine. What is it?<eos> I was... I was wondering if you...<eos> If you wanted to hang out with me and Karma this weekend.<eos> Why? We hate each other.<eos> We do not.
So she's okay?<eos> She survived?<eos> Yeah, yeah, she's okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, it didn't even... it didn't even come up this time.<eos> - Yeah, I'm just gonna wait until the next therapy, because, yeah, our shrink was a little late, which started the session out weird.<eos> And then before I even had a chance to say anything,<eos> Barb started talking about how her sister's lupus is affecting her.<eos> Did I tell you that Barb's sister Joni has lupus?<eos> No. Well, she does.
Oh, man, I can't get...<eos> - Who makes these freakin' things?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Are you wet?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You seem so wet.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Totally wet.<eos> You want this?<eos> Yeah, I do.
He wants out.<eos> He wants out. [Sighs]<eos> Does Ed have end of life directives?<eos> - No extreme measures.<eos> - Okay, okay.<eos> Shell.<eos> We have options.<eos> - Don't say it.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> - We do.
Look at that burnt orange color.<eos> Isn't that gorgeous?<eos> It's a little '70s, isn't it?<eos> No, 'cause I mean, the color, the orange with the blue, you know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You okay, you like it?<eos> - Yeah, it's cool.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You really do?
- Okay, all right.<eos> - Good, good.<eos> - Jesus Christ.<eos> - Yeah, I think it's awesome.<eos> - Fucking love it,<eos> - I want to fuck that chair. - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> You ever think about Barb and Len?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Course I do.
Mount Cypress.<eos> Mount Freelance.<eos> Sarah.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> How'd you know I'd be here?<eos> Easy, conceited.<eos> I had no idea you'd be here.<eos> - Alex...<eos> - He didn't.
Wow. Um... yeah, I'd love to hang out.<eos> But alcohol's not really my thing.<eos> Do you have any weed?<eos> - Give me ten minutes.<eos> - Perfect.<eos> Dr. Will Rush's office.<eos> Did you get the flowers?<eos> It's J.P.<eos> Yes...<eos> I did.
I had a feeling that felt a lot like love.<eos> In the name of that feeling...<eos> I did a lot of things I'm not proud of.<eos> You name the cliché, that was me.<eos> And so how did it end?<eos> Rush got me out.<eos> The rest doesn't matter.<eos> It does matter.<eos> It matters a lot.<eos> Oh, no... it doesn't.
Have a toy box in the attic of the old days. The boy is going to love it.<eos> - You do not know if it is a boy, then.<eos> - There will be a boy, I know.<eos> - Looking for this?<eos> - Hello?<eos> I always knew I would get a violent death.<eos> But I was not prepared for the humiliation by being killed with knitting needles.<eos> By a Norwegian.<eos> I admire you.<eos> I do it.
But that did not mean exposing you to any trouble.<eos> - The way I terminate employment on...<eos> - Allah's ways are inscrutable, Bo.<eos> Yes, right?<eos> So you're a Muslim too?<eos> Talk to acquire unique expertise in refugee issues.<eos> Sure, but it does not look like there are some who need it, so...<eos> I think you should come and see us and assume bit like consulting assignments.<eos> Are you saying that you are willing to to give me a second chance in the Nav system?<eos> Yes. I do it.
Zed Martin.<eos> I found your three-month lease.<eos> So, what's a chica bonita in her mid-20s doing slumming it in a one-horse Welsh mining town in the middle of Pennsylvania?<eos> I travel a lot.<eos> Right.<eos> Well, there's only two types of people who travel.. a lot.<eos> Those in the circus and... those on the run, and curiously,<eos> I'm not seeing any funny wigs or face paint.<eos> I know what I'm running from.<eos> Do you?
- Um, it is quite an offer and quite an amazing commitment you've made to this community.<eos> But I'm afraid my answer's no.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> - Yeah. Then it would seem you're excused from the remainder of this conversation.<eos> - Okay.<eos> [Laughs] Well, look at you.<eos> - Yeah. Look at me.<eos> - Who knew you had such excellent taste in cars?<eos> - [Laughs] I thought you would like it.<eos> - I do.
Where did these boxes come from?<eos> Our manufacturer in China.<eos> Check inside.<eos> Drugs.<eos> Who's in charge of this shipment?<eos> Macalvoy!<eos> Let me go!<eos> I swear I didn't kill him!<eos> Yeah?<eos> Then who did?
But no one knows.<eos> She simply vanished.<eos> Must have been awful for Frank.<eos> Do you know a man named Novik?<eos> No.<eos> He's an oligarch in exile from Crimea.<eos> He hired Frank to retrieve something from Sevastopol.<eos> I don't see a connection, Caterina.<eos> Neither do I but...<eos> Frank does.
Not totally, but...<eos> Then what do you need?<eos> See, I watched you work.<eos> When you had more to do than just fix corrupt software, you lit up.<eos> It's no fun just fixing problems all the time.<eos> Exactly.<eos> You want to create.<eos> You want to express yourself.<eos> You want to break out of who you are and try new things.<eos> Well, I do too.
You're still seeing that guy?<eos> Did he break your heart?<eos> Mike... mike, can we get another round here?<eos> - Thanks. - All right, Oscar.<eos> It's hard to love someone who doesn't love you back, right?<eos> Hey, I tried to blackmail him.<eos> Mm-hmm, for you.<eos> It didn't work, but... you want to fuck me, Oscar?<eos> What?<eos> You do, right?
It's public record.<eos> I made copies.<eos> I'm sorry, Bailey.<eos> I don't want to be the one to tell you.<eos> Okay. - I have to go.<eos> - Okay. It's o...<eos> - Wait.<eos> - What? I don't have a car.<eos> - Oh, fuck. - I don't have a fucking car.<eos> - I don't... - Okay.
Until you hear it.<eos> It wasn't your fault.<eos> This is why secondary drowning is so dangerous, especially in young children, because it just looks like they're tired, just like any kid who spent the day at the beach.<eos> There's no way you could've known.<eos> But if I had taken him to the hospital right away...<eos> If I hadn't let him sleep...<eos> Would he be alive now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you believe in heaven, dr.<eos> No, I don't.
Aand she seemed pretty upset about it, so...<eos> You know she adores you, right?<eos> Isn't she, like, your closest friend?<eos> I don't want to talk about Divya.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, that's personal.<eos> I get it.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, if you want to talk...<eos> I do.
2 weeks ago he committed suicide, the poor devil.<eos> Hanged.<eos> By a tree.<eos> She hasn't said a word about it.<eos> I came upon the cremation fees: 4,500, 5,000 Euros.<eos> We had a fight.<eos> That's the biggest thing she ever hid from me.<eos> We're off to the South, to settle her father's affairs.<eos> - I have some in my mouth.<eos> - No, you don't.
But not before I hit him with an arrow laced with particulate nanotechnology.<eos> Felicity wrote a program that tracks the nanites using GPS.<eos> The tracer arrow.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You had a shot at Merlyn and you didn't kill him?<eos> I tagged him.<eos> With a flesh wound!<eos> He's marked.<eos> There's nowhere in the world he can go where I can't find him.<eos> And when you do?
It's very European.<eos> Where's Inspector Krunch's duster when you need it? - Ha, ha.<eos> - You, Von Dinkenstein girl... did you say something you'd like to share with the group? Nope.<eos> Nothing at all.<eos> And again, it's "Dinkley," not "Von Dinkenstein." Hmph.<eos> Hmph.<eos> With all these lights, your gas bill must be enormous.<eos> Nein, the castle was built on a natural-gas resource.<eos> We have all the gas we need. - Ha, ha.<eos> Yes, you do. Ha, ha. - Ha, ha.
Did he work in medicine?<eos> Is it the hospital?<eos> Is that where he worked?<eos> Or was it something more like infectious diseases?<eos> 'Cause you'd have to get vaccinated for that.<eos> Like the Centers for Disease Control, right here in Atlanta.<eos> [Takes deep breath, crying] Leave him alone.<eos> Let's go.<eos> What did you tell them?<eos> Yes, you did. Yes, you did.
Hey, guys.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Hey. How's p.T.?<eos> Long and boring.<eos> I should go.<eos> I can't miss my weigh-in.<eos> Emma's pretty great, isn't she?<eos> Yeah, she is.<eos> You know we, uh... Used to be a thing?<eos> No, no, I didn't.
Uh, no, he doesn't have any money.<eos> Why don't we go downtown and talk about this?<eos> - What, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> - First, I thought that you guys were strippers, but now... I am less sure.<eos> Say something, lawyer!<eos> Officers, don't talk to my client, and you... I don't like that tone.<eos> - I hired you.<eos> - Uh, excuse me, officers.<eos> Does this ad possibly say, "lonely, bi-man seeks special boy, 12, for deep friendship in Manhattan"?<eos> It does.
You mean with the journalist who is helping you.<eos> Who you'll be staying with.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> She saved me.<eos> She?<eos> When did this happen?<eos> When did you meet her?<eos> How did you meet her?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I just did.
He must have been in such a hurry.<eos> He was in a hurry 'cause he was ashamed.<eos> I want to just get this over with.<eos> - Jessica, what...<eos> - Am I doing here?<eos> I'm here to tell you that I know you know the truth about Louis' resignation.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Yes, you do, and I'm guessing you didn't like it.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
You told her that?<eos> Harvey, no one has ever been able to do that.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> You want to make a splash? Part the Red Sea.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> "Oh, no," what?<eos> You have that look on your face like you want me to have some emotional conversation I don't feel like having.<eos> You know what, Harvey?<eos> I just came in here to see if you needed anything.<eos> - I don't.
Called you back about what?<eos> I asked him to hire Louis anyway.<eos> - You're kidding.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> I even told him if he did I'd owe him one.<eos> - Hmm. - What?<eos> Oh, I'm just tryin' to figure out at what point in the last week you decided to become a pussy.<eos> Oh, so doing something nice for someone makes you a pussy?<eos> - I didn't say that exactly.<eos> - Yes, you did.
None of that kiddie, plastic crap all over the place.<eos> Stop!<eos> I have to tell you something.<eos> [Sniffs deeply] I want children.<eos> Like, a lot of children.<eos> I want this place to look like a damn orphanage.<eos> And when your womb gives out, we're gonna fly around the world.<eos> We're gonna collect them like stamps... like precious, little, lovable stamps.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You did?
'Cause you tend to like your ideas a lot better than mine.<eos> Because I have better ideas than you do.<eos> Which is why I wanted this to be your idea.<eos> How long have you been doing this?<eos> - This is, uh...<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> ...the first time.<eos> How long, David?<eos> How long have you been pretending to hate stuff that you actually love?<eos> - I don't...
We're prepared to offer...<eos> - $10,000. - $10,000 a month.<eos> Ten?<eos> Right.<eos> Uh... well, I was thinking something more in the neighborhood, of, uh... 20.<eos> Welcome to the Yurt.<eos> Perfect.<eos> So, where do I start?<eos> Oh, I don't think we have any medical issues at the moment.<eos> We rarely do, actually.
I'm an idiot.<eos> With very good taste in flowers.<eos> I shouldn't have told you I was being considered for the job that way.<eos> Well, let's just say it didn't go well with my hangover.<eos> I know things between us are...<eos> Actually, I'm not sure what they are.<eos> But I care about you, Erin.<eos> I care about you, too.<eos> I just need you to understand that...<eos> I do. I do.
Thank you, Donna.<eos> I knew I could count on you.<eos> Can't remember the last time I saw you in here.<eos> I can't remember the last time this firm faced prosecution.<eos> I can: Ava Hessington.<eos> And after that, we said it would never come to this again.<eos> How the hell did it?<eos> We stepped into the ring with Charles Forstman.<eos> I'm guessing he didn't budge last night.<eos> He didn't.

Listen, we need to talk.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I-I thought...<eos> I do...<eos> Because I know what you're going through.<eos> I'm not sure you do.<eos> You're angry.<eos> You're scared.<eos> You want to get things on an even keel, controllable, knowable, calm.<eos> Okay, maybe you do.
Stop slouching!<eos> You look beautiful, honey, but please raise your left shoulder!<eos> Love you!<eos> Why does she keep leaning to one side?<eos> Is the sandwich too heavy?<eos> Can we get her a lighter sandwich?<eos> - Where's the food stylist?<eos> - Right away.<eos> Oh, hello. I thought you left.<eos> I did.
I'm frightened by how little you seem to understand this.<eos> Your words and your actions have consequences.<eos> When you do something mean because you're angry or bored it happens to someone else.<eos> It hurts them.<eos> You're not the only person who's real.<eos> So, what?<eos> Do you think I'm a bad person?<eos> I think you did a bad thing.<eos> Doing one bad thing doesn't make you a bad person.<eos> But what if I did, like, a lot of bad things?
Did Mama know what you did?<eos> Oh, come on, son. Of course not.<eos> You don't see it, Pops, do you?<eos> You didn't buy anybody.<eos> You didn't put Zale in your back pocket.<eos> You just became him!<eos> You became everything we suffered ignorance and brutality to change, that people died to overcome.<eos> You're the one who bought the lie.<eos> You believed that they had all the power.<eos> You still do.
I'm almost on the platform.<eos> Just wait!<eos> Been waiting too long.<eos> They're probably watching.<eos> Who's watching?<eos> !<eos> Are you there?<eos> They don't want you to know the truth.<eos> They don't want you to know who you are.<eos> Who doesn't?
I did the same thing with Stu...<eos> What?<eos> Hey, Zelda! Hey, guys.<eos> We got some seats.<eos> Come grab a seat.<eos> Pull up a chair.<eos> - Holy crap.<eos> - I know, right?<eos> - This is killing me. - I hope it does.<eos> - I really do.
Homeland - 4x11 "Krieg Nicht Lieb"<eos> So this is fine with you- - Haqqani a folk hero, people shouting his name in the street?<eos> Of course not.<eos> - You could have stopped it. - I tried.<eos> Really?<eos> Tell me what you did to stop an attack that canonized a terrorist and wiped out my entire station.<eos> It wasn't an attack. It was a goddamn coup.<eos> You think I want these people running Pakistan?<eos> - You tell me.<eos> - I don't.
This is just a temporary thing.<eos> Okay, well, then, let's... let's just enjoy it while it lasts.<eos> Mmm. Do you remember what we got that first time that we were together in that, in that motel in Fort Lauderdale?<eos> (laughs) Powdered doughnuts from the vending machine.<eos> Go (laughs) get them.<eos> Baby, are you okay?<eos> Are you sure you want to do this?<eos> I want to.<eos> I do want to.<eos> You do?
Plus you took a picture of Brian Bell after you killed him, you e-mailed it to someone... on your phone.<eos> We call that a "death dunk."<eos> Mm-hmm. Death penalty slam dunk.<eos> E-mails between Papa Legba and our Mr. Howard discussing the hit, the price, everything.<eos> I don't know who he is.<eos> I swear.<eos> That's the whole purpose of Chauvenet.<eos> It's anonymous.<eos> I have no idea who Papa Legba is.<eos> Nobody does.
Come on.<eos> Sorry about the rope.<eos> At least we know he can talk.<eos> I wish I could.<eos> I knew it.<eos> He doesn't understand a word we're saying.<eos> It's a tactic.<eos> If we think he doesn't speak English, we won't expect him to tell us anything.<eos> Due respect sir, then why do we expect him to lead us to his commander and not into a trap?<eos> We don't.
Had to be done.<eos> Did you get any sleep?<eos> It's ok.<eos> I'll sleep when we find Finn.<eos> You haven't seen him, Clarke.<eos> Losing you, the others, the war, it changed him.<eos> He executed the Grounder that drew us the map.<eos> Pulled the trigger without even blinking and walked away.<eos> That doesn't sound like Finn.<eos> No, it doesn't.
What... we're a two-man band.<eos> I'm not splitting our appearance fee with them.<eos> Think about it.<eos> What's better than performing for her?<eos> Performing with her.<eos> Now we'll make sweet music together, and she won't be able to deny her feelings for me.<eos> But it's supposed to be you and me!<eos> It is just you and me... and them.<eos> You know what would be so cool?<eos> If we did an all-acoustic set.
My dad couldn't remember our birthdays, but he remembered every damn word of that theme song.<eos> What would we do, baby...<eos> Without us?<eos> Sha-la-la-la.<eos> That... was...<eos> Amazing!<eos> - You love me so much!<eos> Oh!<eos> - I really do.<eos> I really do.
Both.<eos> I don't have emotions.<eos> I read that in your file.<eos> But how can you protect something if you don't care about it?<eos> I care about my paycheck.<eos> I can't really tell if you're purposely being contemptuous, of maybe you are unstable.<eos> Well, if you dismissed every government worker who was unstable,<eos> Washington would cease to exist.<eos> Giving these responses, how do you expect me to approve you?<eos> I don't.
And they died like this?<eos> What is it?<eos> I know how to stop the attack.<eos> He's stable for now.<eos> We should go.<eos> You ready?<eos> Even if you can save Lincoln... he won't be the same.<eos> The things he's done... they'll stay with him.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
Can you leave me?<eos> I want to sleep.<eos> Tell me.<eos> Kevin...<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Please.<eos> You're right.<eos> I must stop calling you "my little turkey".<eos> You're too big, now.<eos> But what to do?
I murdered that man, Governor.<eos> Not out of fear nor aiding the law, but for no purpose other than to end the man's life who took my son's. I am guilty.<eos> I have pled so.<eos> You, Ruth Elizabeth Cole, are guilty of murder and shall be hanged by the neck until you are dead tomorrow.<eos> May god have mercy on your soul.<eos> Have the gallows constructed in the town square.<eos> A public execution?<eos> Transparency, Judge. Followed by a strict adherence to the law.<eos> A death warrant should be drawn up.<eos> Do it.
Meaning what?<eos> Made your deal for food and shelter with John Slotter.<eos> He's the murderer here, and I won't live under such a man.<eos> - Was Indians killed your pa...<eos> - Wasn't.<eos> And you know it.<eos> You got a dark heart to go with that widow's dress.<eos> I see you've cleaned yourself up for the occasion.<eos> And you look fetching in black.<eos> Don't she, Ling?
On your Mark, get set, Ruffalo!<eos> Go!<eos> I'm doing it, Charles!<eos> I look cool!<eos> The next event will be "Keep Your Cover."<eos> Contestants must craft an undercover persona and talk to as many police officers as you can before being recognized.<eos> Pregnant.<eos> Nice.<eos> Means you had sex.<eos> Damn right I did.
We were lucky.<eos> They would kill to see these in Tehran.<eos> How does an Iranian end up working for Mossad?<eos> How did the FBI end up working for Raymond Reddington?<eos> How did you find us in Warsaw?<eos> Who told you we were there?<eos> Medical examiner just called.<eos> He needs to see you, stat.<eos> How do we know we can trust her?<eos> We don't.
How do you explain that?<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll answer for you.<eos> You're a supplier for Dr. James Covington.<eos> You provide him with vital organs for him to sell, and he pays you through the Wellbright Fund.<eos> I don't know Covington.<eos> I was approached by an associate I don't know his name... about providing him with viable material.<eos> You deal with bodies.<eos> I thought donor organs had to be fresh.<eos> They do.
Well, that was a quick turnaround.<eos> What made you change your mind?<eos> Well, I... I went out with Jeff and some of the other members of the crew to see a movie.<eos> - Which one?<eos> - Uh, "Horrible Bosses 2."<eos> They said it was just like the first one.<eos> I... I don't know.<eos> Uh, but we went to Delancey's afterwards.<eos> And I'm not sure how the subject came up, exactly, but it turns out that Jeff thought I would be nuts to skip college this semester.<eos> - Did he?
Whoa. This is why I told you to wait in the car!<eos> Oh, she snapped.<eos> Here comes Cryane.<eos> Hey, hey, Deedee, come on.<eos> Diane, you are making a public spectacle of yourself.<eos> Deedee, what are you doing with Dad's keys? Put those back.<eos> Oh, come on, that's Dad's truck. Dad's chum is in the back.<eos> No! No, no, no!<eos> Sucka dick,dumbshits!<eos> Well, that crazy clam did it.
Well, sure, Diane is short, but I don't know about knobby.<eos> The last thing I want to do is hurt Diane, but I keep having this dream where she's gone.<eos> There's no break-up, no tragedy.<eos> She's just gone, and my life continues without her.<eos> And it terrifies me to say this, but in the dream I feel... relief.<eos> Hey, thanks for listening to all this.<eos> You're a really good friend, Todd.<eos> Since you weren't able to give me any useful intel,<eos> I had to offer up my restaurant, but now, we're on my turf.<eos> Time for operation "I don't."
Can you change best to pretty good?<eos> Sarah Lynn, how's it coming with the Horsin' Around years?<eos> Almost done with the story where Hulk Hogan guest starred and told us to say no to drugs.<eos> Keep typing, monkeys.<eos> If only Hulk Hogan could see us now, right?<eos> What?<eos> Because Sarah Lynn said the thing about Hulk Hogan?<eos> That was like four hours ago.<eos> Oh, uh, right.<eos> - How we doing now?
Thank you for coming, dear.<eos> I love that you can do that.<eos> Just, eyes in the back of your head.<eos> Or your reflection in the back of my camera.<eos> Thunderstorm?<eos> Probably what?<eos> Mature stage multicell cluster.<eos> It's just rain.<eos> I like rain.<eos> Who doesn't?

- Charlie Witherspoon.<eos> - Hello.<eos> I... Oh.<eos> Sorry, my... My hands are really sticky.<eos> Oh, God, am I blowing this?<eos> Charlie was the editor of The Harvard Lampoon.<eos> He can be Princess Carolyn's new assistant while I use Laura.<eos> - Ugh. - Good thinking, boss.<eos> Ah, ah, phone is ringing. Phone is ringing.<eos> What do I do?
- to the top of Machu Picchu.<eos> - That's walking, not camping.<eos> You two are seriously debating this right now?<eos> Sam's girlfriend, Louisa, told us Sam went alone back to Manhattan yesterday afternoon to get supplies.<eos> We know he never made it back to the island and was killed around midnight.<eos> Those kids couldn't have killed Sam.<eos> They couldn't even get off the island, 'cause Sam had their only boat.<eos> And you and Carrie believe their story?<eos> Jay's looking for the boat to confirm it,<eos> - but, yes, we do.
Doesn't he realize the doors that would open? It's like resume gold.<eos> I would finally have a track record outside of hankmed.<eos> - You should explain that to Hank.<eos> You should explain all of that to Hank and tell him how you feel. - I feel fine.<eos> It's--he's just not interested, you know?<eos> I'm at peace with it. - Seems like an angry peace.<eos> Look, with everything that's going on,<eos> Hank, Emma, the board, if you want to keep talking to Bob- what?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I don't, okay?
- Well, Evan found him... Online.<eos> - Did he ever say he was a doctor?<eos> - No. Ohh.<eos> In fact, he insisted we call him Bob, but I just figured he was trying to make us comfortable.<eos> - If it makes you feel any better, he does have an undergraduate degree from concordia university. - Yeah?<eos> A degree in what?<eos> - Theater. - Mm.<eos> - I'm sorry if you feel deceived.<eos> - You know what?<eos> I don't.
I'm with Boris now, and we are really happy together.<eos> - Okay. [Laughs]<eos> - It happened really fast, but it just feels right, okay?<eos> - Mm-hmm, yeah, no, I mean, you guys are perfect together.<eos> - That's what I think. - [Laughs]<eos> - Seriously though, I just walked out on Boris.<eos> You think he's pissed?<eos> What are we gonna do if he's pissed?<eos> - I'm sure we'll figure something out.<eos> We always do, right?
Provided she's given the opportunity.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Do I get my job back?<eos> The legend is back, girl, permanently and with a salary.<eos> I thank you ever so much. Hiring my friend Rusty permanently as well is the greatest gift you gave me.<eos> Rusty?<eos> Permanently?<eos> I gave you the greatest gift, didn't I?<eos> - You did, you did.<eos> - I really did.
Look, I wanna say... it to you.<eos> - Then why can't you?<eos> - Because I'm not a good person.<eos> I've done things, things that... made me think that I can't be your Prince Charming.<eos> - If you only knew, you'd...<eos> - I'd what?<eos> Punish you?<eos> Look, I've done tons of stupid I'm not proud of either.<eos> But if you really want to make this work...<eos> Oh, of course I do.
If you can wait on payment,<eos> I'll accept your offer.<eos> Fiona?<eos> This will do for you?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Blithely?<eos> This light... The way you're standing, you look... you look like my stepmother must have when she was young.<eos> Does she, Thomas?<eos> When mother was a girl?<eos> No, she does not.
How do you feel?<eos> - Hungry.<eos> - Then you should eat.<eos> The last time I was offered food, it didn't turn out so well.<eos> Not to worry.<eos> It's all organic.<eos> This looks so damn good.<eos> You know, I know that resistance helped you to get out and that herr Meisner was instrumental - in the orchestration. - Uhhuh.<eos> So how did he know our people were waiting for you?<eos> He didn't.
Well, maybe that was because someone fucked with my meds.<eos> What?<eos> My pills.<eos> That I rely on.<eos> I'm wondering if someone tampered with them.<eos> I guess you don't think it's out of the question.<eos> And what, you think I did it?<eos> I didn't say that.<eos> But did you? No.<eos> Well, who did?
He doesn't know; he's on foot.<eos> He's calling back in 15... 11 minutes. We have to locate him and put together an exfil plan.<eos> Did he call? Not yet.<eos> You ready?<eos> Good to go.<eos> We needed a break.<eos> Maybe we finally got one.<eos> Right on time.<eos> Saul.<eos> What do I do?
Strange Empire 1x06 Electricity<eos> Ma!<eos> What is it?<eos> Bad. You have to come.<eos> Buck up, boy.<eos> Quit your mewling.<eos> He's going to fall.<eos> My baby!<eos> Don't much like drinking alone.<eos> Nobody does, Captain.
- What do you think?<eos> - It's like you guys - willfully don't even hear me.<eos> - I could just take this one to the grave.<eos> Like Titanic said, a woman's heart is an ocean of secrets.<eos> Right?<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> Yes, totally.<eos> I just listen better when I have<eos> - something to do with my mouth. - So, what do you
NADINE: Ma'am, the White House called.<eos> You've been summoned to Camp David.<eos> Motorcade's waiting outside.<eos> Oh, fine.<eos> The leader of the free world trumps lunch?<eos> Sorry. (laughs)<eos> It's okay.<eos> You go to work.<eos> I see what you did there.<eos> I did.
We don't know yet.<eos> But I am going to need a list of all of his students' names.<eos> The students loved Chet.<eos> He put in a lot of time here.<eos> In fact, right now he would be setting up for tomorrow's Pelican rally if... he hadn't...<eos> Well, I'm sorry for your loss, Ms. Meadows.<eos> Thanks for your time. Yeah.<eos> How was your meeting with the principal?<eos> According to her, everyone just loved good old Mr. Messner.<eos> Until someone didn't.

Is that why you killed her?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I never touched Livia.<eos> She told me she had an older guy, she never said who.<eos> Was it you?<eos> It's not what you think.<eos> What did she want then?<eos> The cops were at the cemetery, why?<eos> - Who knows?<eos> I don't!
I thought it was because of the cardinal.<eos> Possibly.<eos> I have many uncles.<eos> Lucky you.<eos> You're quite assertive, aren't you?<eos> Has it crossed your mind that I decide what will happen to you, not your uncle?<eos> There's no unemployment in Italy?<eos> Let me give you some advice.<eos> If you don't want to be out of work you have to abide by our rules.<eos> But you don't.
61 beats per minute.<eos> Consistent the whole time.<eos> Not that puny.<eos> Speaking of not puny...<eos> Yeah, I want you to get used to this.<eos> It's a sniper rifle. Huh.<eos> Pardon me.<eos> Uh, just one quick question.<eos> - You went to S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, right?<eos> - You didn't.
Uh, just one quick question.<eos> - You went to S.H.I.E.L.D. academy, right?<eos> - You didn't.<eos> If you did, you would have known better than to shoot us.<eos> Apology number 470...<eos> I am very sorry, Agent May.<eos> Don't be sorry.<eos> Just wait.<eos> Uh, we just have a little wager.<eos> - Uh, so, did you...?
You want to tell me about Newcastle?<eos> It's a town in the north of England.<eos> Horrible weather and even worse football team.<eos> You don't end up like Gary over bad weather.<eos> Well, that's just him, isn't it?<eos> Gary's had more opportunities handed to him in his life than I've had hot dinners.<eos> And he's pissed them all away.<eos> Gary's is a life wasted.<eos> B'hoah Shlomoh, kvosh et hahosheh.<eos> All done.
More's the pity.<eos> Friends don't betray each other.<eos> I betrayed you.<eos> I betrayed her.<eos> Oh, don't worry about Zed.<eos> She's a tough bird, that one.<eos> I'm talking about Astra.<eos> There's something I need to tell you, John.<eos> About Newcastle.<eos> Gaz, you don't...
Should've never gotten you all involved.<eos> You, especially.<eos> Because I'm a coward.<eos> Because it's not your world.<eos> Never was and I knew it.<eos> And I knew you were high.<eos> We all did.<eos> The thing is, Gaz...<eos> I don't blame you.<eos> I never did.
I will do it.<eos> Great.<eos> Fresh linens are on the cart.<eos> Watch out, the bed's pube city.<eos> God.<eos> You know, your son is a really great guy.<eos> Every night when I fall asleep on the sofa, he carries me to bed.<eos> Well, he tries to, and then he just drags me by the leg.<eos> You think I don't know my son is great?<eos> Of course I do.
No, you didn't.<eos> When it comes to your family, you always place the blame on yourself, but this is not your fault.<eos> She's right, Oliver.<eos> Throw Malcolm in front of Ra's, let the League sort this out.<eos> Merlyn has a video.<eos> He made contingencies.<eos> Oliver, if you fight Ra's al Ghul, he'll kill you.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> During the Undertaking, Merlyn told me that I couldn't win, because I didn't know what I was fighting for.<eos> Now I do.
By League law, I have the right to challenge you to a trial by combat.<eos> It's been 67 years since a man challenged me.<eos> You covet death that much?<eos> Do you accept?<eos> Oh, yes.<eos> I see the years have done little to dull your stubbornness.<eos> Maseo...<eos> My name is Sarab!<eos> You told me once a man cannot live by two names.<eos> And I don't.
I arrived the same year as Ta-er Al-Sahfer.<eos> She was a great warrior.<eos> You did not kill her.<eos> When you face the Demon, it will be my duty to bear witness.<eos> I have no desire to watch you die.<eos> Under our code, you have 12 hours to settle your affairs.<eos> The 13th hour, be at this place.<eos> This location is consecrated ground for the League.<eos> A place for the settlement of blood debts-- if one survives the climb.<eos> If you do.
== sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> Roy.<eos> I was just researching cheap booze for Thea's club.<eos> You know, it wasn't you who killed that officer.<eos> I keep telling myself that, but it's not working.<eos> Every single time I put on that mask, I feel like a fraud.<eos> You--<eos> You have to give this time.<eos> If you want to talk about it--<eos> I don't.
Only one way to find out.<eos> Hey, I don't want any trouble!<eos> What happened to the thing?<eos> You are ridiculous.<eos> Um... Which I mean in a...good way. That's...not creepy.<eos> You look beautiful.<eos> I think it's the dress.<eos> The dress is actually missing something.<eos> Oh, no, I forgot to do up the zipper again?<eos> I always do that.
Look, we're both trying to find out who the hell's doing this.<eos> We could help each other.<eos> His name is Albert Mancini.<eos> No criminal record, aside from a few unpaid parking tickets.<eos> Grant says he doesn't know who this guy is.<eos> Oh, and now you believe him?<eos> I haven't decided yet!<eos> Do you know that you're training with a vigilante?<eos> Former, apparently.<eos> And no, I didn't.

Come on in my office, Nicole.<eos> Okay.<eos> So...<eos> In some ways, I feel a little awkward asking your advice, but you deal with this issue on a daily basis, too.<eos> Oh, what issue is that?<eos> My husband's a great guy and a wonderful father, and we used to work together... no problem.<eos> But ever since I became the accounts manager, which made me his boss, we've been having problems, and how do you handle that?<eos> Well, I never worked with my husband.<eos> I can imagine.<eos> No, but you do work with my dad.
Where is everybody?<eos> It's your circus.<eos> Well, I'm glad to see that you're feeling better.<eos> Are you?<eos> How much longer are you planning on dragging out this fiasco?<eos> Well, I think it's best if we wait for the others.<eos> I don't bite, Congressman.<eos> Unless, of course, I'm provoked.<eos> I prefer to have everything on the record, Ms. Lange.<eos> Of course you do.
I'm not looking at you.<eos> Now, I'm looking at you 'cause you're looking at me.<eos> Why are you acting so weird?<eos> I'm not acting weird.<eos> You're acting weird.<eos> Wow.<eos> I did not see that coming.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You know exactly what I'm talking about.<eos> Uh, no, I don't.
Sure.<eos> About what?<eos> Muggings on the National Mall.<eos> Doubt I can help you.<eos> I got to get back to practice.<eos> Yeah, well... practice is gonna have to wait.<eos> Why do you want to talk to me?<eos> We've got a photograph of you fleeing a mugging near the Vietnam Memorial last Friday, wearing this backpack.<eos> You mind if we search it?<eos> Yeah... yeah, I do.
It didn't sound that serious.<eos> When she didn't come in this morning or call, I phoned, but got no answer.<eos> It's strange because Courtney 's a very conscientious employee.<eos> It's not like her to be irresponsible.<eos> How long has she worked for you, Mr. Tolson?<eos> About six years.<eos> She joined us just after she got out of the Navy.<eos> Courtney's a systems analyst.<eos> With her military background, our clients love her.<eos> You do a lot of government work.
They get... Toad.<eos> Yeah, well, let's...<eos> Start the autopsy. I couldn't agree more.<eos> Now, wait a minute.<eos> You sure these were taken of him?<eos> Yes. I took 'em myself.<eos> Give me that.<eos> Oh... This gentleman Has both his original central incisors.<eos> Is that a problem?<eos> Angus didn't.
(phone ringing) Ah.<eos> Excuse me. Gibbs:<eos> Duck, are you there? Yes.<eos> Did he ever say anything about me?<eos> He was always so scarce with his praise, I've wondered.<eos> I'm sure angus was satisfied with your work.<eos> His standards weren't very high.<eos> I mean...<eos> I'm-I'm sorry, gareth, I-I need to have a word in private with maggie.<eos> You don't!
Pitt...<eos> There's a bone stuck in this.<eos> A cervical vertebra.<eos> This thing acts like a wire noose.<eos> Keeps getting tighter until it pulls all the way closed.<eos> Explains the blood spray.<eos> Well, the carotid artery acts, quite literally, as a spigot.<eos> No buttons, no timers, just... on.<eos> Once the motor starts, it doesn't stop.<eos> Well, apparently, that one did.
Okay, Max. Easy.<eos> Hi, grandpa.<eos> I got 'em. I got 'em.<eos> Let go.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm good.<eos> I like a girl.<eos> Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do like a girl?
That's all.<eos> Good.<eos> All right.<eos> See you.<eos> [Exhales]<eos> You'll learn how to do that.<eos> You just toed the line.<eos> That is how you-- I got to take notes.<eos> - Hey, you want another one?<eos> - I certainly do.
You have to understand, when Jane looks at you, she just keeps remembering this sequence of events in her head... the pregnancy, the lying.<eos> How do I get that out of her head?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Maybe with time?<eos> Is she still wearing her ring?<eos> Seriously, did you punch yourself?<eos> Rafael, stop.<eos> You and I both know what happened.<eos> No.<eos> We don't.
Mate, the coppers are after you and the Frenchman wants his money<eos> You want to stay holed up in here forever, is that it?<eos> OK. Let's do it<eos> Tell Oz I want to see Laetitia<eos> - Are those the arms?<eos> - That's right<eos> All present and correct<eos> That's the heart<eos> - Do you want to hear it?<eos> - Yeah. I do
It was you.<eos> You were the one in my house that night.<eos> You killed my mother!<eos> Why?<eos> if you want to know that, you're gonna have to catch me.<eos> Not fast enough, Flash.<eos> - Who are you?<eos> - You know who I am, Barry.<eos> I don't know who you are.<eos> But you do, Barry.
They're called meta-humans.<eos> "Meta-humans"?<eos> People with very powerful abilities.<eos> You and me are the only guys on the force that know what's really going on.<eos> And we need to keep it that way...<eos> So nobody else gets hurt.<eos> Can you do that?<eos> And The Flash?<eos> Do you know who he is?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Because if you don't and they come in here and see you pointing a gun...<eos> They're gonna kill me!<eos> I won't let that happen.<eos> But you need to let me answer that now.<eos> Charlie-0-5-Sanders, talk to me!<eos> Charlie-0-5-Sanders!<eos> Are you there?<eos> CSI Finlay, I need you to surrender your firearm.<eos> I know the drill.<eos> Yes, you do.
Foolish arrogance led me astray.<eos> But I learned my lessons.<eos> I'll be back... stronger and smarter than ever.<eos> Good luck with that, bro.<eos> Here I am riding around in a lovely truck, sharing an ice-cold beer with my new friends.<eos> My luck's already turned, right?<eos> Dude, anyone ever tell you when you walk, you look just like a penguin?<eos> Nobody's ever told me that.<eos> He's saying he has a right to stop me from beating on a mope.<eos> Damn right I do.
My son would never leave his clothes.<eos> Oh, so elegant he is.<eos> Yes, I show you.<eos> Damn.<eos> Mooney and the cops must have had him killed.<eos> Looks like... the snitches get bumped.<eos> That's life.<eos> But they're not going to get away with it, not as easy as they think.<eos> You take things too personally, you know that?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Leave you waiting.<eos> It went, like, weirdly great.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Just, like, he's...<eos> I don't know.<eos> He was, like, so excited and happy about it, and, you know, it's...<eos> I don't know. It's confusing for me.<eos> It's weird being here.<eos> Like, seeing him, and... it's hard for me to see him again, and... yeah, I mean, he was... seemed like he was kind of a mess to me, I mean.<eos> Oh, I don't...
Okay, thanks.<eos> If I think of another name, I'll let you know.<eos> Yeah. By tomorrow.<eos> Peter needs to endorse tomorrow.<eos> Otherwise it looks like he's following the crowd.<eos> Alicia, I'm tired. I need you to take over for me.<eos> Never say such a thing.<eos> I don't know why he'd say that.<eos> I never heard him say such a thing.<eos> No, I-I did...
No.<eos> I'm rather flattered.<eos> Good. What are you exactly, a good guy or a bad guy?<eos> I did it to stay alive.<eos> What would you have done?<eos> I know... you guys made a fortune.<eos> Give me half the money. Otherwise ... I'll perform your story... every day in front of the Division office.<eos> Xiu ... what fortune?<eos> There's no such thing. Sir Zhao. You know who I am?<eos> Who doesn't in this town?
Did I do something?<eos> 'Cause I feel like I'm in trouble.<eos> No, I'm in trouble 'cause when this changes I don't have anyplace to be.<eos> God...<eos> I used to be so careful.<eos> Wait, um...<eos> What's changing?<eos> I thought we were good.<eos> Yes, but it all changes, Alex.<eos> It always does.
I'll be sure to write Adam a very nice thank-you note.<eos> You know, the way he did it...<eos> When he cut my throat, it was so cold, so callous.<eos> Yeah, well, in his defense, he had to act quickly.<eos> I mean surgically.<eos> Of course, it proves that he does really know about your, um... Condition.<eos> You're right.<eos> He knows everything about me, which means he knows about you.<eos> Well, so?<eos> So what if he does?
I need to know what you've been saying and to whom you've said it.<eos> I need to know, Natalie.<eos> It's you.<eos> You run the ring.<eos> You told that guy to kill Blake.<eos> You were coveted by a very important man.<eos> A man that I need to keep happy.<eos> So, now for both of our sakes,<eos> I need you to tell me that you didn't tell anybody anything.<eos> I didn't.
Really? That's how you gonna do me?<eos> It's me and you against the world except...<eos> When it's your aunt.<eos> She is not my aunt.<eos> And she is also not dumb.<eos> Paint a picture.<eos> She'll see.<eos> This is how you answer the door?<eos> Only when it's a dude I don't care about.<eos> Or a girl I do.
Heather's told me about the obstacles that you've had to overcome, Cam.<eos> And it's been a real inspiration to Johnny.<eos> He's such a brave kid.<eos> Well, we heard about his bravery.<eos> We can see it up close.<eos> I just wish he was awake to meet you guys.<eos> You would love Johnny.<eos> I mean, everybody did.<eos> I can't believe I just said that.<eos> Everybody does.
- No, it is.<eos> The whole famous fucks granting dying wishes don't even give kids hope.<eos> It just gives them 10 minutes of distraction from the fact they're gonna die.<eos> I don't want distraction.<eos> I want debauchery, man.<eos> You want to play fairy fucking godfather?<eos> Get me an eight-ball of blow, some strippers, and show me how you ball, man.<eos> - I know you be balling. - Johnny. Johnny.<eos> - We can't do that.<eos> - I don't even do blow.
The attention you deserved.<eos> I know how much this meant to you, and I... I should've just stayed out of it. Listen, I'm...<eos> I'm sorry I mistreated you.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> Peter, wait.<eos> If I could not forgive, then I would be truly handicapped. What?<eos> It's from the book, Peter.<eos> What book?<eos> I forgive you, Peter.<eos> You do?
Yeah.<eos> I never would have had the confidence to get my book published in the first place. And that's all I ever wanted.<eos> Friends?<eos> Frasier.<eos> So, Bri, how's that ankle itch? Well, what do you mean?<eos> I'm just saying, you probably have an itchy ankle under that cast.<eos> It starts as a tickle and then you can't quite reach it? Not gonna work, Stewie.<eos> Yes, you're right. Best not to think about it.<eos> Even though it might be a little bug digging away down there, just nagging and itching and...<eos> Ah, ah, crap, I did it to myself!
Half of your closet?<eos> For me?<eos> Ma gave this to me when she sent me to divorced kids camp.<eos> There's plenty of room in there.<eos> You can wheel your stuff back and forth.<eos> That's a very nice gift, Danny.<eos> Hey, it's a loan.<eos> See you later.<eos> Have a good day.<eos> You didn't, uh...
Would you stop talking?<eos> Come to think about it, there were multiple ways you could have infiltrated my family.<eos> But you chose me.<eos> Why?<eos> You were expedient.<eos> Nah, there's more to it than that.<eos> You went through great lying lengths to keep me around.<eos> What lies?<eos> Oh, that's funny you should ask.<eos> I didn't.
A queen, capable of dominion over life and death.<eos> There were guards then. A midwife.<eos> Lots of people.<eos> But they fled when Hades began to lose his power.<eos> I won't stop 'til he's as powerless as she was.<eos> Oh, Mom.<eos> She meant to have you two leave this place together.<eos> But when the time came, she realized only one could escape. So she let you go.<eos> She loved me.<eos> My mother did, too.
How'd you know it wasn't over?<eos> That's the thing with the Fae.<eos> It's never over.<eos> OK! We've got chardonnay, licorice, Tremors... your second fave Bacon flick, and Footloose, your number one favorite... well, everyone's number one favourite...<eos> Bo, I can't.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I can't keep being the lost human in the Fae world trying to be Fae.<eos> I'm not Fae.<eos> That has never mattered to me.<eos> But it does to me.
That depends.<eos> Are they suspects?<eos> What's the matter, boy?<eos> Why's he acting like that?<eos> What's wrong with him?<eos> Riley.<eos> Hey!<eos> Riley!<eos> You think the dog's trying to tell us something?<eos> Yeah, I do.
Sons of bitches.<eos> You look like crap.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You could let a person know you're back in town.<eos> You knew I was here.<eos> You could call a friend.<eos> Are we?<eos> Still friends?<eos> I need a favor.<eos> I don't do favors for the White House anymore.
You could have anything you wanted brought to you here, anything in exchange for information.<eos> And you asked for one night alone in a cage with me?<eos> - I demanded.<eos> - You demanded.<eos> What did you think it would accomplish?<eos> What did you think was going to happen?<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Did you think I'd want you back?<eos> Don't flatter yourself, Robin.<eos> You did, didn't you?
Chin said Hollier's daughter died on H93, right?<eos> That's right, why?<eos> That's where he's going.<eos> Call Kono. We got to know exactly where that accident happened.<eos> We find them, we find Sophie.<eos> That little girl you took, she's not my daughter.<eos> I know. My brother-in-law grabbed the wrong girl, but it didn't matter.<eos> I knew as soon you heard 1.6 million, you'd do whatever I said before you'd admit to killing my daughter.<eos> You have to believe me, I never meant for that to happen.<eos> But it did.
Oh, Miss!<eos> You bought a bra?<eos> - Where'd you get it?<eos> - Online.<eos> Paid for with what?<eos> I...<eos> I asked Dad if I could use his credit card.<eos> Did he know what you were buying with it?<eos> - God, Mum!<eos> - Did he?
It's got nothing to do with me.<eos> Yeah?<eos> - Hey, babe.<eos> - Oh, hi, darling.<eos> - Hey, I don't wanna nag...<eos> - But you'll make this one exception.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hm!<eos> I don't like you leaving the back door unlocked.<eos> I didn't.
You cracked it?<eos> I did, it was beautiful, I...<eos> Jesse.<eos> Jesse, I'm sorry... .. I didn't want to hurt you, I tried to protect you, I did.<eos> Jesse?<eos> - Jesse.<eos> - Hey.<eos> What's goin' on?<eos> Come in.<eos> Well, why doesn't he?
Believe me, please, Jesse.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - I'm getting back on the files.<eos> Isn't that what you want, to get them to find me?<eos> - To get me caught?<eos> - No.<eos> Jesse, don't. Don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!
- What are you doing?<eos> - I'm getting back on the files.<eos> Isn't that what you want, to get them to find me?<eos> - To get me caught?<eos> - No.<eos> Jesse, don't. Don't.<eos> Why are you with me?<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I did!<eos> I did.

Rediscover me.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> Can I come?<eos> Do you think I'm too controlling?<eos> Do you think I'm too controlling?<eos> Well, you do make me staple everything on a diagonal two centimeters from the top left... It gives the strongest hold.<eos> And you did put a password on our DVR player because<eos> - I don't know how to manage Sunday nights.<eos> - How to manage Sunday nights.<eos> You don't.
Ah, the Russian torrent sites have it now.<eos> I don't think you understand how sharing works.<eos> I agree.<eos> Why did you tell Zelda about Geronimo?<eos> What?<eos> You told Zelda.<eos> Zelda told Stephie.<eos> Now Stephie's using it to pretend to be some kind of psychic at me.<eos> I don't know what a Geronimo is.<eos> He didn't.
He crashed it into a cow on his first ride... Totaling both.<eos> That was a secret, and you never should have shared it.<eos> Secrets are wrong.<eos> Sharing is right.<eos> As a member of the open-source coding community, we believe that information should be free.<eos> It should be...<eos> Nobody knows what you're talking about.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> You don't know what I'm talking about?<eos> You don't.
Well, they're not some magical group of woodland fairies, all right?<eos> They actually exist.<eos> And they're all around you, watching your every move.<eos> Okay.<eos> Creepy.<eos> Noted.<eos> People who get on the U.N.O.S. list are not just people who need the organ.<eos> It's people who the board feels will take care of the organ.<eos> Do you know who's on this board?<eos> I do, indeed, yeah.
Those people are looking at Charlie like he's a potential empty hospital bed, like he's just taking up space from someone else they could be charging.<eos> Not someone else.<eos> Another sick kid...<eos> A sick kid we might be able to actually help.<eos> So that's it.<eos> We give up.<eos> - You just tell the parents to give up?<eos> - Don't talk to me like that.<eos> You don't think that this kills me, too?<eos> Actually, I don't.
No, seriously.<eos> I've seen him.<eos> Okay, well, you and Dash also dip a lot into the private stash, so...<eos> Nurse Jackson, listen to me.<eos> I've talked to him.<eos> When I had my first surgery, he was there, playing with this...<eos> Little creature... An origami thing, and...<eos> Oh, I know that completely sounds like I was high, but...<eos> You got to believe me.<eos> I do.
The Secundum Naturae Ordinem Wesen are back, and Monroe is not happy.<eos> Did you fall?<eos> Ah!<eos> Ah!<eos> I didn't touch it.<eos> I didn't think you'd want me to.<eos> We're gonna need it as evidence.<eos> - When did you find it?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Rosalee did.
Because I was sworn to secrecy.<eos> Grand Pabbie, I need some answers.<eos> Please.<eos> Your mother, Gerda, was the youngest of three.<eos> And then there was Helga, and Ingrid was the oldest.<eos> As children, the three girls were quite close, often seen playing together in the royal gardens.<eos> But then, one day, Helga and Ingrid vanished.<eos> No one ever knew what happened to them.<eos> It was a tragedy the royal family wanted to forget.<eos> And they did, with my help.
There's a lot more than just me.<eos> Don't I know it.<eos> She wasn't looking for a blonde.<eos> She was looking for the savior.<eos> What?<eos> This scroll... the writing is runic.<eos> It's a prophecy.<eos> It says, "the name of the savior is Emma."<eos> She knew?<eos> Before you even did.
They're about to be his next victims.<eos> "Like me or I die."<eos> It's a popularity contest.<eos> And Kent is losing.<eos> These guys' photos update every five seconds, along with their votes.<eos> They're both attached to electrical leads.<eos> Which probably lead to a power supply controlled by a computer.<eos> That countdown started at one hour.<eos> - Whichever brother has the least votes gets his heart stopped.<eos> Or they both do.
I could've handled things so much better.<eos> I'm not exactly a perfect mother.<eos> Well, I'm not exactly the perfect son.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Midnight was approaching, and no sign of Matty.<eos> He said he wanted to be together, but where was he?<eos> Hey.<eos> Have you guys seen Matty?<eos> - No.<eos> - I did.
How do you know that?<eos> It doesn't matter how he knows it.<eos> He's right.<eos> I stole it from my old boss.<eos> He had wandering hands, so I wandered my hands to his car keys.<eos> Look, no offense, but you got to find<eos> - someplace else to say.<eos> - I totally get it.<eos> I appreciate you guys helping me.<eos> Really, I do.
What is that?<eos> He kills people in here.<eos> No, that's him.<eos> That's Old Man Hawkins.<eos> ♪ NCIS 12x07 ♪ The Searchers Original Air Date on November 11, 2014<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man<eos> He followed me for, like, two blocks.<eos> I couldn't just shut the door on him.<eos> I didn't think you liked cats.<eos> I don't.
Suit yourself.<eos> Uh, Mr. Ortiz, I'm Lieutenant Carver.<eos> I want to assure you that protection can be provided around the clock.<eos> We can even relocate you and your family until after the trial is over.<eos> Yeah, then after you get what you want, who is gonna protect me then?<eos> You'll just have to trust us.<eos> WOMAN:<eos> This is a big tent firm, Erin.<eos> Yes, we handle hard-core crime cases, but we also have attorneys on everything from the Keystone Pipeline to defending the civil liberties of the Guantanamo Three.<eos> We also do incredible pro Bono work with the Innocence Project.
I'm gonna grab a coffee.<eos> Ca-caw! Is it going down?<eos> It's going down.<eos> But whether or not Henry would notice the cute barista who was covering for Romy<eos> - remained to be seen.<eos> - He's next!<eos> Hey, stranger.<eos> Ooh, it is taking every ounce of self-control I have not to block this.<eos> It's like I want people to be happy.<eos> But on the other hand, no, I don't.
Well, he takes his job seriously. He's a man after my own heart.<eos> Yes, but at the end of the day, you go home to your beautiful wife, whereas Henry goes home to a salad, usually.<eos> You can't make love to a salad.<eos> What can I do to help?<eos> Oh, find out who his favorite "FRIEND" is.<eos> And if he ever had the clap.<eos> Oh, sorry, sir.<eos> Uh, no, Henry, please, join me.<eos> Thought you had a private bathroom - in your office.<eos> - Oh, I do. I do.
I don't like being followed.<eos> I'm trying to help you, Detective.<eos> You are heading down a dark path, and you'll wind up getting yourself killed.<eos> All these incidents,<eos> I think you enjoy shooting people.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> I hate it.<eos> But it's what I'm good at, and it's what I have to do.<eos> You don't have to save everyone.<eos> Yes, I do.
I'm about the magic.<eos> This is going to be TBD, okay?<eos> This is how they say it in this country.<eos> - TBD.<eos> - TBD?<eos> - TBD.<eos> - TBD, TBD.<eos> Hailey,<eos> I told you not to let me go in.<eos> Didn't I? Eh?
- Anyway, this is Ashley.<eos> I think, um, we went to high school... together.<eos> - You went to high school together!<eos> - We went to high school together!<eos> Julie Berkman's older sister Ashley?<eos> That's me.<eos> Is this fun or what?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> Your dad is dating Trashley Berkman?<eos> - Didn't she... ? - Yes.
I'm in love with her, and I'm gonna marry her.<eos> Gonna... get a new mom, Jess.<eos> Because I am not sure if you heard that, but there is going to be a wedding.<eos> Oh... there will be no wedding.<eos> And it begins.<eos> Why are we meeting in a parking garage?<eos> Because what we are doing is unsavory<eos> - and we're hiding from God.<eos> - And you also... you promised Winston and everybody pizza, so...<eos> Yeah, you definitely did.
I know you guys forced me to come here so I can watch Alex and get all inspired by college again.<eos> We really didn't.<eos> Yeah, you just got in the car.<eos> I only packed four sandwiches.<eos> Happy anniversary, Jay!<eos> I don't love this tableau.<eos> Is that Gloria's gift to me?<eos> What is it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Sure you do.
He's not into his grades, and he's always goofing around, and he's not serious.<eos> There's something not quite right about him.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> I can.<eos> Bipolar, emotional disorder, mommy issues.<eos> Shall I go on?<eos> Says last night, you claimed he harassed you by phone, followed you to class, incited arguments.<eos> The dude broke into our house.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> - Yes, we do.
I don't know.<eos> It could explain the song, a nostalgic ploy.<eos> It's so cliched.<eos> I told you.<eos> We love our cliches here.<eos> They even come with a soundtrack.<eos> But Roberta Flack?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your life has a soundtrack, Ben.<eos> No, it doesn't.
You sleeping with her?<eos> Is that any of your business?<eos> Well, she's a wealthy older woman.<eos> She funds your work.<eos> She put on your first show.<eos> Maybe when the money and the favors dried up, you decided to make her pay.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I have a video of you assaulting her in a parking garage.<eos> No, you don't.
Just say it out loud.<eos> I...<eos> I forgive...<eos> I forgive you.<eos> MacKenzie, you're such a joy.<eos> I'm still angry.<eos> Of course you are.<eos> No one lets go all at once.<eos> You might have to do it 1,000 times before it gets any easier.<eos> But it will.
What is happening?<eos> Oh This is...<eos> I believe the term is 'euphoria'.<eos> I have an idea.<eos> Hail in the southern desert extending form Las<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> How did you just become more beautiful in 20 seconds?<eos> Do you want to kiss me?<eos> Yeah, but I don't know how.<eos> You will.
Danny!<eos> I hurt you.<eos> I get it.<eos> It was selfish and wrong of me to leave without telling you.<eos> But coming here has taught me that the Iron Fist isn't just for K'un-Lun.<eos> Others before me may have felt it was their destiny... but I am Danny Rand.<eos> And I'm the Iron Fist.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I wish you could understand.<eos> I never will.
What are you doing?<eos> Get up.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I know you say that I'm enough.<eos> But there are certain things that you are used to getting that I will never, ever, ever be able to give you.<eos> And it might be fine for right now, but what's gonna happen when you start needing them again?<eos> I won't.
His unearthly potions... alter perceptions.<eos> The ducks will be flying.<eos> All the coaches to Bath and Southampton<eos> - are being searched, Your Highness.<eos> - For what?<eos> For whom?<eos> We have no idea who they are, who they pretend to be.<eos> It's been 12 hours!<eos> He will break.<eos> No, he won't.
Okay, just because you're married doesn't mean you can have secrets.<eos> Alright, well, it's a little early but I'm pregnant.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You're okay with that, right?<eos> Hanna, of course.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Besides, we're right behind you.<eos> When we get back from our trip we're gonna meet with an adoption agency.<eos> - Just don't say anything.<eos> - No, I won't.

- Why don't you take the Jeep?<eos> - The Jeep is a hundred years old.<eos> The Jeep's not a hundred years old.<eos> It's not even paid off yet.<eos> Why don't you take the station wagon?<eos> 'Cause that's so much better.<eos> You guys, I'm trying to have friends, you know, like you guys are always talking about.<eos> Sweetie, your friends are not going to like or dislike you for a car.<eos> Mom, it's high school.<eos> Of course they will.
I'll burn these.<eos> I'll light them on fire and let them burn until they're... I don't know, melted plastic and ash. It's your call.<eos> But if you want to fight... if you want him to pay you for what he did, these tapes can help.<eos> They're proof.<eos> You want me to tell the whole goddamn world what happened to me?<eos> I want you to do what you want to do.<eos> Whatever's going to make this better for you, if anything can.<eos> But I'm not gonna lie.<eos> I want him to pay for what he did.<eos> Will he, though?
You can't love someone back to life.<eos> You can try.<eos> Clay... we don't know what was in her mind or in her heart.<eos> There's no way to know why she did what she did.<eos> Actually, there is a way.<eos> Before she died...<eos> Hannah recorded 13 reasons why she killed herself.<eos> And you're number 13.<eos> And everyone who comes before you on these tapes knows what you did and didn't do.<eos> And they always will.
They have an armory.<eos> They have guns.<eos> Why didn't you tell us before now?<eos> I made a promise, Rick.<eos> Do you ever think about who you've killed?<eos> Are you ready if this goes south?<eos> It won't.<eos> If it does, you don't need to feel bad.<eos> I do feel bad.<eos> I will.
- The gift receipt is in the bag.<eos> You've changed so much.<eos> You're all grown up.<eos> - Well, where's the famous boyfriend?<eos> - That's enough.<eos> - He's a friend.<eos> - Yes, sorry.<eos> The friend. Where is he?<eos> - Dad, don't say anything.<eos> - I won't.
Given your occupation, I would imagine you'd be accustomed to literally being surrounded by death.<eos> What?<eos> Death is inevitable.<eos> Bones, you don't...<eos> And in his case, relatively imminent.<eos> Stop.<eos> Sorry, she didn't mean that.<eos> She just likes to blurt things out.<eos> You're gonna have a very healthy and happy life in front of you.<eos> - No, Booth, he will not.
Do you have any plans for the day?<eos> I have a few ideas.<eos> Or, we can use that energy to track down Jenna.<eos> She's out there.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> I think that Grunwald is starting to rub off on me.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna challenge the logic in that.<eos> Noel's dead, but Jenna's still out there.<eos> - I mean, we have to find her.<eos> - We will.
The world doesn't work like that.<eos> Maybe not the rest of the world, but this is Rosewood.<eos> Yeah, I keep on trying to tell myself that this is just a town but I can't make a convincing argument.<eos> The evidence doesn't really support the premise.<eos> Maybe this town has to disappear before we can leave.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> But we keep trying.<eos> So we'd beat on boats against the current.<eos> We will get out of here.<eos> We will.
Congratulations.<eos> Thanks.<eos> There is a part of me, though, that, uh wants to say I'm sorry.<eos> To whom?<eos> Well, to the only person I know who uses "Whom" in a conversation.<eos> Sorry to me?<eos> For what?<eos> Don't you dare apologize for being with me.<eos> And don't you dare forget it, any of it.<eos> 'Cause I won't.
Clive has already witnessed a full-scale zombie outbreak.<eos> That's a genie that can't really be put back in a bottle.<eos> We want to know what you mean when you talk about Seattle being a zombie homeland.<eos> How can we know if we're with you when we don't even really know what we're talking about?<eos> Ir enough.<eos> We here at Fillmore-Graves are preparing for D-Day.<eos> Discovery Day, the day when humans, en masse, learn of our existence.<eos> What do you think happens then, Liv?<eos> I thought it would be in our best interests if it didn't get out.<eos> Maybe it won't, but it probably will.
I tested earlier versions of the virus and the antidote on livestock.<eos> I made sure to set aside a successful batch.<eos> This place gives me the creeps.<eos> I like it.<eos> It's concentrated.<eos> Once you dilute it, there is enough here to cure every infected person in Gotham.<eos> Oswald, you and I will rule this city together.<eos> OSWALD: Yes. But first, I have to kill Ed Nygma.<eos> He has to die.<eos> MOONEY: Oh, he will.
So that changes things, right?<eos> I mean, since Iris didn't die, future me never goes down that same dark path.<eos> I never create time remnants to fight Savitar.<eos> And if future you never creates these time remnants, then Savitar himself is never born.<eos> Precisely.<eos> Once the time paradox catches up with him, then... he'll be erased from existence.<eos> But I saw him.<eos> He didn't disappear.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - But he will, Joe.
Throw him the line.<eos> This is crazy.<eos> Don't hear me arguing, do you?<eos> - All right.<eos> Hang on tight. - Yeah.<eos> I've always appreciated you doing the salmon ladder but never as much as in this moment.<eos> I got about 5 feet of slack.<eos> I can make it.<eos> Oliver, if you don't...<eos> I will.
- So they think you're in it.<eos> - Bud. - Wh-what?<eos> You're the diversion.<eos> Right, right, right.<eos> They follow me.<eos> Hey, you could fit in that one if you were gonna fit in one.<eos> I haven't fixed it yet, but...<eos> But I guess that doesn't matter right now.<eos> - I don't see anybody.<eos> - You won't.
Now, I'm a man of my word.<eos> You can walk.<eos> Just as soon as you wake up.<eos> I don't know what you mean...<eos> Slag.<eos> You seem troubled.<eos> I hope it was not the encounter with your manservant.<eos> If this is my destiny,<eos> I do not want to fail.<eos> You won't, Bruce.
Yeah, it's happening fast.<eos> I never got to explain to you why I said yes to Stefan.<eos> I know why you said yes.<eos> You want to spend your life with him, in spite of everything.<eos> I get it, but I can't watch you marry him.<eos> Can't watch him be happy.<eos> And it's really hard for me to say that I won't be there with you.<eos> Because you know I would do anything for you.<eos> I can't do that to myself.<eos> I won't.
You know how stubborn she can get.<eos> It doesn't change the fact that...<eos> You guys know that I'm right here, yeah?<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Fine.<eos> Lucifer, I told you no hospitals.<eos> How am I supposed to find the antidote if I'm laying here...<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, we will.
(MEN CHATTER)<eos> (MAN CALLS) Stop him!<eos> -(LUCAS GRUNTS) -MICHAEL:<eos> Sorry! Sorry, Dad.<eos> -Dad, I'm sorry.<eos> Alright, lads?<eos> Come on, let's play. -You alright?<eos> (MEN CHATTER)<eos> Can't let him do it again.<eos> The rest of us won't. Oi!
You know, after I heard you play and before everything happened, I was going to ask you to come to Chicago with me.<eos> To stay.<eos> You could study music.<eos> I'm not even thinking about that right now, Mom.<eos> No, I know, I know.<eos> It's just, I want you with me.<eos> I don't think that this town is safe anymore.<eos> I feel like Riverdale is getting ready to slide off of a mountainside, and I don't want you anywhere around when that happens.<eos> Just promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Thank you, Jafar.<eos> Now it looks like we're prosecuting a damn hero.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> I don't have videos like that on my cell phone.<eos> Do you?<eos> Danny Nasiri had a good life, a loving family.<eos> I don't believe a kid like that would self-radicalize.<eos> Why do people from Ferguson, Baltimore, and Milwaukee burn down their own neighborhoods?<eos> I honestly don't know.<eos> And you never will.
Magnetic?<eos> - Charismatic?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But no, nothing has happened between us.<eos> Nothing.<eos> And it's important to me that you know that.<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> [Inhales deeply]<eos> Okay. [Laughs]<eos> And nothing ever will.
Not much to be gained from discussing it with you, though, is there?<eos> What better person to discuss it with?<eos> What better guarantee could you have that the things you say will never leave this room?<eos> But perhaps you're right.<eos> If she's driven you this far, it's gone beyond your control.<eos> Yes.<eos> It has.<eos> She's a disease.<eos> I regret my role in spreading it.<eos> You will, too.
Mama'll be right back.<eos> I'm going to the airport.<eos> You sure this is all right?<eos> We'll be okay with my sister.<eos> Strange, I never thought much about God before all this.<eos> Not many people have.<eos> Why would He leave Heaven? What's He thinking?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Well, I hope you find him.<eos> I will.
You want me to invest in your house?<eos> Then I shall.<eos> Come and see me tomorrow afternoon and we'll talk.<eos> Show me what you've got and I'll show you what I've got.<eos> How's that for you?<eos> Violet tells me there's not a soul in Quigley's house tonight.<eos> Place is like a morgue.<eos> Give the man money, Mr. Haxby.<eos> A coin for a gentleman!<eos> I will not.
I thought they strung you up somewhere.<eos> To rot.<eos> It tore me apart.<eos> But I didn't give up like a coward.<eos> You think what you want.<eos> I think you're a liar.<eos> 'Cause you said we would find Hannah.<eos> You will find her.<eos> No.<eos> We will.
I only did it to protect you.<eos> I never meant to hurt you.<eos> You sound just like him.<eos> Can we just agree to stop doing the wrong things for the right reasons?<eos> Yeah, that sounds like a plan.<eos> Let me start by doing the right thing.<eos> Report back to work, Agent Danvers.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I hope one day we get him back.<eos> We will.
Sam Elliot in "Long Desert."<eos> It's the second movie I ever did.<eos> Maybe I'll use the accent.<eos> I wish I was going with you.<eos> Timing on this Billy Rathburn dinner really sucks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He's a great DP.<eos> You'll be happy you stuck around to get him.<eos> Yeah, as long as we have the deal in place by the time he leaves for Prague Sunday night.<eos> You will.
Henry Sharrow is no more.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> - Henry's death was an accident.<eos> - Was it?<eos> And who was there to see it was a misfortune?<eos> And who was there to see that it was not?<eos> He as much as told me.<eos> Killed his brother cos he'd fallen for you.<eos> I don't believe you. Oh.<eos> But others will.
They respect it.<eos> They're dogs.<eos> If you beat them, they obey you.<eos> Not women.<eos> Women don't fear pain the way men do.<eos> They have to be broken in other ways.<eos> But make no mistake... they have to be broken.<eos> Many inmates have tried to make a fool of me over the years.<eos> None have succeeded.<eos> And none ever will.
What the hell's he doing here?<eos> It's okay.<eos> They helped me.<eos> You're leaving, aren't you?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Take me with you.<eos> You know I can't do that.<eos> You've got a life here, a family.<eos> I want to see the future.<eos> You will.
Show mercy now, so that later, when this war is over, they'll be more likely to seek out a non-violent solution.<eos> And in what reality would a corporation even bother<eos> - negotiating with a colony?<eos> - In a reality where that colony is backed by two dozen other independent colonies.<eos> Show you can govern fairly, and it will go a long way toward convincing others, like the G.A. or The League of Autonomous Worlds, that you deserve a fair shake.<eos> All right.<eos> We'll see how your friend does with the Traugott guard.<eos> But someone...<eos> Someone has to pay for this.<eos> And they will, but not with their lives.
Octavia?<eos> It's pathetic, right?<eos> She hates me but I keep coming back for more.<eos> She's your sister.<eos> She's blood.<eos> She'll come around and see how special you are.<eos> Clarke...<eos> If I don't see you again...<eos> No.<eos> You will.
Where did you get that?<eos> I took it.<eos> You gave me the lead, remember?<eos> The Weddle case.<eos> I knew they had Luke.<eos> I also knew this is how they got you to confess to Nassar's murder.<eos> Jason, take your statement back.<eos> Tell me everything you know.<eos> Listen to me, if they know - that I'm cooperating with you...<eos> - They won't.
- Relocation?<eos> What's that code for?<eos> Execution?<eos> Don't be a child, Miss Clark.<eos> Now, please, if you'll excuse me, I need to prepare for my meeting with Admiral Decker.<eos> He's my boss.<eos> Everyone answers to a higher authority, Miss Clark.<eos> What about my team?<eos> I am preparing a new, more trustworthy team for you, so the work of the Stitchers Program will continue.<eos> No, it won't, not without me.
It's not about us.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> I went against my better judgment putting Roman into the field, and you ended up getting shot for it.<eos> You went against your better judgment using the HMX as bait, and now it's in Sandstorm's hands.<eos> So what's your point?<eos> Look, we have feelings for each other, of course we do, but... is it worth losing a war over?<eos> So that's it then?<eos> I think it has to be.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow?<eos> Yes, you will.
Oh, it's pretty damn far, isn't it?<eos> You be safe.<eos> You be good.<eos> If you want me to come, I will.<eos> I've kept you to myself long enough.<eos> Time to spread your wings. Focus on your art, your music.<eos> You have a gift, baby.<eos> You have so many beautiful futures in front of you.<eos> Make sure you pick a good one for me, okay?<eos> I will.
This tape will self-destruct in five seconds.<eos> I'm gonna need all your sizes.<eos> I have some costume ideas.<eos> "The House of Cedar and Pine."<eos> 1957.<eos> Us.<eos> That's how Olivia knew.<eos> Everything is on that document.<eos> - If anyone else sees it...<eos> - They won't.
Didn't Amelia tell you?<eos> She's waiting in the car.<eos> The sitter's upstairs.<eos> We're going out.<eos> Well, if you want to go out so bad, why don't you call Riggs?<eos> I'm busy.<eos> I want to go out with you.<eos> Meredith.<eos> Stop.<eos> No. I won't.
Not her.<eos> Nope.<eos> She was...<eos> She was happy.<eos> She was always smiling and joking and laughing.<eos> I don't know what to say.<eos> I mean, how do I even...<eos> I don't know what...<eos> I don't know what to say<eos> You will.
Where... Where do you think he is?<eos> His heart is set on fulfilling his destiny.<eos> And he can't do that without the sword.<eos> What sword?<eos> The sword Emma shattered when he last faced her.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Why does he think that... that killing Emma with this blade will make him the Savior?<eos> He's not the first one to think wielding that sword would make him a hero.<eos> We have to find him before he gets his hands on it, before he goes after Emma again.<eos> We will.
I remember this photo from Peter's office.<eos> It's still so weird to me that he and Gavin Belson were ever friends.<eos> Select destination. - No.<eos> No, thank you. - Optimizing route to Arallon.<eos> Hold on. Wait.<eos> Are all these Peter Gregory's notebooks? Um...<eos> - Are they?<eos> Are they in this box? - Richard.<eos> Remember, you promised you were gonna get some sleep tonight.<eos> Yeah, I will.
I can't believe I didn't hear you in my own kitchen.<eos> 'Cause I made it in mine, and I just walked it over to your house.<eos> Okay, what...<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> You told me you wanted me to be right.<eos> I didn't mean it.<eos> - Walk away from this.<eos> - I can't.<eos> You can.<eos> You just won't.
I promise. I swear.<eos> How do you know, Paige?<eos> Sex muddies things. I'm not having sex.<eos> Yeah, but you might.<eos> And if you do, you're going to feel and say things to Matthew that you've never felt or said to anyone before.<eos> How are you gonna handle things then?<eos> I...<eos> You have to think about that.<eos> I know you don't want to hurt us, but it can happen without you even realizing. You wouldn't even know you've said it.<eos> All right, all right, I'll just--
Honey, this is my uncle, Albert.<eos> Wow. Heard a lot about you.<eos> We're glad you could make it.<eos> Treat her well.<eos> Or else you'll have to answer to me, and that's not something you want on your calendar.<eos> Well, I think I can handle you, Uncle Albert.<eos> Good choice.<eos> I like him.<eos> Well, I'll see you on the dance floor.<eos> Yes, you will.
Could I have my throne back now?<eos> I'll fight if you want.<eos> I've become pretty boss with a broadsword.<eos> You have... so don't.<eos> Fine.<eos> Always did like to storm out.<eos> I should go too.<eos> I should be there for my people, whatever happens.<eos> You mean in case I fail?<eos> You won't.
Missy, seriously, why?<eos> Oh, because he's right.<eos> Because it's time to stand with him.<eos> It's where we've always been going, and it's happening now, today.<eos> It's time to stand with the Doctor.<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> Missy!<eos> I will never stand with the Doctor!<eos> Yes, my dear, you will.
I like watching you eat.<eos> What's the big deal?<eos> Yeah? Watch this.<eos> I knew you were gonna do that.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> No. Hey! You can eat after.<eos> ¿Después de qué?<eos> You promised you'd have the 50 grand.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> I will...
What's in there?<eos> A gun?<eos> A knife?<eos> A gun that shoots knives?<eos> - Gabi! He's got a... gum!<eos> - Would you like a piece?<eos> - Oh, no, no thank you.<eos> Clearly, I hate gum.<eos> - I'll take some.<eos> - No, she won't!
He wanted me to give you this.<eos> "Take a walk with me."<eos> Is there a reason for this walk?<eos> There is.<eos> Elizabeth... from the very first moment we met, I knew Heaven had sent an angel into my life.<eos> I don't know when I'm coming back, so I don't know if it's fair to ask you to wait for me.<eos> Jack...<eos> I would wait an eternity for you.<eos> Elizabeth Thatcher... will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will!
Rosie?<eos> Sweetheart?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I can't sleep.<eos> I was thinking about Jack. And Elizabeth.<eos> You're not the only one.<eos> What is she gonna do when he's gone?<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> I'm really gonna miss him.<eos> We all will.
Now, I know this is gonna go against everything you know about me, but... I am not a terrible dental assistant.<eos> I actually know what I'm doing now.<eos> But in the beginning, I was so overwhelmed.<eos> I would try to pass the instruments, and all I would hear Dr. Goodwin say is,<eos> "No, not that one... that one!"<eos> And all I hear the patients say is,<eos> "Ow!<eos> That's my tongue!"<eos> Okay, but, like, so, I find someone who's willing to hire me, then I show up on my first day, and... how will I know what I'm supposed to do? !<eos> Oh, you won't.
Sí, sí, sí.<eos> Claro que sí.<eos> I'll pull it up on one of the hotel computers.<eos> You all right, Clara?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Paola just reminded me of the helplessness that I felt when I lost Brad.<eos> Of course.<eos> If we can find out who did this to Drew, it's gonna give her closure, allow her to move on.<eos> I hope we can do that.<eos> We will.
He suffered a brain bleed during surgery and died on the table.<eos> No apparent connection between the two.<eos> But we're not sure, so we can't be certain the driver wasn't in control of the vehicle.<eos> Radio's tuned to 98.2 Wuko.<eos> That's our boy.<eos> Please, just think about it.<eos> Think about the evidence.<eos> I know. Scratch dots his Is and crosses his Ts.<eos> We know that.<eos> But a jury won't.
You say "They" as if you're not a part of them.<eos> You went inside The Farm to stop a group of insurgents inside the CIA, and you failed.<eos> Someone noticed, and they contacted me.<eos> Ryan. Someone else.<eos> Someone who knew how ruinous this group could be to the very foundation of this country, to the world.<eos> They knew what it took to stop them.<eos> We knew lines had to be crossed.<eos> You have betrayed every oath that you have ever taken.<eos> Once all this is over, you're gonna pay for everything you've done.<eos> Everyone will, Alex.
It doesn't hold me back.<eos> It allows me to accomplish whatever I need, including this.<eos> We're done.<eos> I'm cutting you loose.<eos> You're a free agent now.<eos> And, um...<eos> I have all the help that I need.<eos> It's not you.<eos> What happens when he changes his mind?<eos> He won't!

So, we're going to have to figure out a way to do this thing the way we do everything... together.<eos> You did what?<eos> We're sorry, Emma.<eos> We were just trying to make things better.<eos> You made it a hell of a lot worse.<eos> You keep blaming yourselves.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> There's nothing you could have changed.<eos> We know, but that doesn't mean we're gonna let you f-face it on your own.<eos> And you won't.
I didn't want to participate in the theater of a funeral.<eos> But, through various levers of guilt, I ended up going.<eos> It was tense and awkward.<eos> I stayed for a while, and then left town.<eos> And the next week, I got an e-mail on my phone, and it said, "The will of Daniel J. Brennan."<eos> I was, like, "I guess I'll open it."<eos> Which, by the way, isn't in the commercials.<eos> It's not like, "Listen to music.<eos> Take selfies.<eos> Open wills."
I wanted to hate you.<eos> Allura...<eos> -It's--<eos> -But it's not you.<eos> It's me.<eos> My anger has blinded me for too long.<eos> I'm so sorry I misjudged you.<eos> You've proven, it's not what's in your blood. It's who you are that counts.<eos> Please come back to us.<eos> I will.
I, on the other hand, am quite pleased with myself.<eos> You set me up.<eos> No.<eos> I just knew you'd make the wrong decision.<eos> What are you going to do with all of this?<eos> What I came here for...<eos> Start the final battle.<eos> But worry not.<eos> You won't be around to regret your mistake much longer.<eos> No one will.
Roger Mayfield Murtaugh, you know what a girl likes to hear.<eos> Honey... I might have been a little optimistic about 45 minutes.<eos> I've got to run, I'll call you back later.<eos> Guys.<eos> We have a rocket launcher situation out here.<eos> How did he find us?<eos> All right, look.<eos> If Tito sent this guy to get the kid, he's not gonna fire that thing in here.<eos> So we've got time.<eos> He will.
We're all gonna be exposed.<eos> This operation is over.<eos> We've lost.<eos> I'm not usually one to cop to being afraid.<eos> I'm scared, too.<eos> The last time I handled an asset, it... it didn't end well.<eos> This time, it will.<eos> Be careful.<eos> In case I don't come back, I...<eos> You will.

Checked himself in with a 104-degree fever.<eos> He was delirious.<eos> Told the nurses his name was Lando Calrissian.<eos> That's why we couldn't find him.<eos> He's got a long recovery from meningitis ahead of him, but no prison time.<eos> How'd it go on your end?<eos> The night that Fred Kirby disappeared, nobody saw anything.<eos> So, whatever happened here, maybe they finished it with a gun.<eos> Anybody find any slugs or casings?<eos> No, and they won't.
Why he wore a dress to make a phone call, we will never know.<eos> And what's this right here? This is the heart and soul of this set.<eos> This is the original stoop from The Cosby Show.<eos> Which we got for like, nothing.<eos> They paid us to take it.<eos> They were like, "This thing's got bad juju, get it off our hands", you know.<eos> But of course, the final piece of inanimate set decoration, is you, the audience.<eos> A collection of comedy nerds and theater dorks and... [laughs] children whose parents have made a severe miscalculation.<eos> All of you gathered together, wondering if there will be an intermission.<eos> There will not!
- Okay.<eos> I'm gonna think about it.<eos> You were the best fighter in the world.<eos> And I want to see that back in the ring.<eos> You're just happy it will be another black guy getting punched tonight.<eos> No shit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, man.<eos> And tell your wife... I'm sorry.<eos> I will.
So this is the only copy?<eos> So, now what?<eos> We just bring it to Brackett?<eos> Oh, I'll take it to Brackett.<eos> You stay here and clean up.<eos> Clean up what?<eos> Clean up the studio.<eos> Destroy everything.<eos> What if we need that stuff?<eos> We won't.
You just out for yourself, or you wanna make a better life for all the people of Georgia?<eos> - Well, of course I...<eos> - And what kind of man are you?<eos> You got the balls to do what you know is right, or do you just slink away?<eos> Now, what you don't get to do is threaten me.<eos> So if you're gonna walk out of the convention, then you just do it right now!<eos> But if not, then I expect to see your bright and shiny faces wearing your big "All the way with LBJ" hats tonight when I take the stage.<eos> Bird, go away and leave me be.<eos> I can't do that, Lyndon.<eos> I won't.
You know the most random crap, you know that?<eos> You're just jealous 'cause you don't...<eos> Hey!<eos> Mark, it's okay. Andy!<eos> Once they get ahold of you like that, they never let go.<eos> Here, let's have a look.<eos> Oh, you'll survive.<eos> Rinse that with cold water and put a compress on it. You'll be fine.<eos> I didn't know what to do.<eos> Well, next time, you will.
I assume she was capable of finding a reason.<eos> I'll do my best to save your life tonight, but first it would help if you would explain your connection to the Ricoletti case.<eos> Yes.<eos> In detail, please.<eos> I've never heard of her.<eos> Interesting.<eos> I didn't mention she was a woman.<eos> We'll show ourselves out.<eos> I hope to see you again in the morning.<eos> You will not.
He's yours, to do whatever you think is right to...<eos> Sounds like a bribe.<eos> I haven't asked you for anything.<eos> Yet.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A simple exchange of information.<eos> Julie Mao was one of ours.<eos> I want to find out what happened to her just as much as you do.<eos> You think a man like Filat Kothari deserves to walk free?<eos> Because he will.
-Thephoneis... that's all right.<eos> Can you hear me?<eos> - Yes. - It's at gloucester, okay?<eos> Okay. I understand.<eos> We play with the rockport team, but they're the lead team.<eos> Okay, I understand.<eos> Thank you, Paul.<eos> Yeah, sure thing.<eos> Give Joe my regards, all right?<eos> - I will.
- Who cares?<eos> - No.<eos> I don't.<eos> Okay, it's getting warmer. I got band practice.<eos> Can you drive me home so I can get my stuff and take me over to my girlfriend's house?<eos> Sure.<eos> This the same girl who was over at the house?<eos> No. That was sylvie, and this is Sandy.<eos> They don't know about each other, so, uh, please don't say anything in case it comes up.<eos> I won't.
Just holidays.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, please?<eos> Yes, I'm already here.<eos> Sure, okay.<eos> Okay, talk soon.<eos> She asked if you'd like to join her to an American Embassy reception this evening.<eos> - Was that her?<eos> - Yes, she's still in the meeting.<eos> When she will.
Missandei, how many times were you in the company of these dragons?<eos> - Many times.<eos> - And did they ever harm you?<eos> Never.<eos> Dragons are intelligent.<eos> More intelligent than men according to some maesters.<eos> They have affection for their friends and fury for their enemies.<eos> - I am their friend.<eos> - Do they know that?<eos> They will.
It's a conversation.<eos> Tell me, can your little birds get a message to the Good Masters of Astapor, the Wise Masters of Yunkai, and benevolent enslavers of Volantis?<eos> Of course.<eos> Men can be fickle, but birds I always trust.<eos> Your eye looks much better, Arthur.<eos> How's your mother's jaw?<eos> Better.<eos> And your father?<eos> No one's seen him.<eos> And no one will.
A fate worse than death, I'm sure.<eos> Oh, I didn't mean...<eos> I just occasionally feel as though I'm destined never to go out again!<eos> Of course you will.<eos> I know that, really.<eos> Do you ever...<eos> Do you ever wish you hadn't broken it off with Tom?<eos> No. We're much better suited as friends.<eos> And hopefully we'll both find other people one day.<eos> Of course you will, Trixie.
- I'm about sick and tired of...<eos> - What?<eos> You sick and tired of what?<eos> About sick and tired of the Knicks losing' all the time, man!<eos> You got some hair, too, right there.<eos> - I'm not finished. - Yes, you are.<eos> - Hey, Counselor.<eos> - Aw, don't jinx me, Pop.<eos> I haven't even passed the bar yet.<eos> Oh, you will.
"You do windows, brother."<eos> That wasn't no question.<eos> We need this place open.<eos> I know.<eos> You gonna run it?<eos> I ain't no barber.<eos> What about you?<eos> Another question for another time, my man.<eos> We gotta figure out something soon either way.<eos> I will.
Candy?<eos> She rubs everyone the wrong way but Pop.<eos> Who she rubs the right way, every Tuesday and Thursday at 9:45.<eos> Looks like Shaft ain't had nothing on Henry Hunter.<eos> Pop was a mack.<eos> If that's what you wanna call it.<eos> He would want you to have his apartment upstairs.<eos> Uh, especially since your crib blew up.<eos> I'll earn my keep somehow.<eos> Goddamn right you will.
If it be God's will.<eos> God's will?<eos> And who determined you to be the instrument of such a thing?<eos> He has.<eos> You just make sure that He's the one doin' the ordering'.<eos> Man of God is called to lead in love.<eos> Anything else will leave us all worse off.<eos> He is a god of love, Nat.<eos> Don't you forget that.<eos> I won't.
- No.<eos> - Has Benson?<eos> Has anyone?<eos> Just the father.<eos> So I was arrested on hearsay?<eos> Is that what you're telling me?<eos> Why is she doing this?<eos> No one'll believe it.<eos> If it's her word against yours.<eos> Yes, they will.
Previously on AMC's Hell On Wheels.<eos> I'm coming back for you and the baby.<eos> Don't say it.<eos> I will.
And the stray sheep?<eos> Would you deny them the love of their shepherd?<eos> Isaac's gone to water the horses.<eos> Brigham Young hopes you're in church on Sunday morning, front row, so he can bless your marriage.<eos> My father would have wanted me to keep my vow to you.<eos> This ain't your head talking.<eos> William is your son.<eos> It ain't right for me to keep him from you.<eos> Pray on it.<eos> I will.
I thought I'd have weeks to get a statement ready; two statements.<eos> And now I got... aw, shit.<eos> I'll see you guys later.<eos> You know, statistically, a deliberation this fast spells guilty.<eos> Statistically, I know, but...<eos> All they asked to be read back was the limo driver testimony.<eos> That... that sounds good.<eos> Really good.<eos> I'm not going to say it.<eos> Then I will.
Then what exactly is our plan?<eos> Your big plan isn't exactly my problem.<eos> Shocking turn of events.<eos> Oh, Wil, come on.<eos> Don't forget to hide your ears.<eos> Wait, you're leaving us?<eos> What is this, a party?<eos> Yeah, and I want you to do the honors.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Oh, you will in a second.
Hey!<eos> Step back!<eos> Matches Malone?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I want to hire you.<eos> Kids now.<eos> So, you want to hire me?<eos> I want someone to die.<eos> Wait a while.<eos> They will.
Because of what you're pursuing.<eos> Is there a difference?<eos> And if you can't make your peace with that, then you're not ready.<eos> There will be others, Master Bruce.<eos> Karen was the only one who knew what The Philosopher looked like.<eos> How are we going to find him now?<eos> You need to have faith, Bruce.<eos> I know what you risked today.<eos> If Barnes finds out you were involved...<eos> He will.
- Either that or you're crazy.<eos> There's nothing to laugh about here.<eos> Maybe something funny popped into my head.<eos> - Such as?<eos> - How do I know?<eos> Lots of things are funny, aren't they?<eos> You think you're going to score, don't you?<eos> What makes you say that?<eos> Not one of your muscles is relaxed.<eos> Anyway, you won't.
None of this makes any sense.<eos> Maybe it's for the best.<eos> What?<eos> Well, the sad fact is that she's been dead to you for 25 years.<eos> You've already grieved.<eos> Like with Kelly.<eos> When she died, I was devastated.<eos> But... now that she's gone,<eos> I mean, I-I love Kelly.<eos> I always will.
What do you want?<eos> Just being with you... is enough.<eos> Don't push me away.<eos> I'm a friend.<eos> Before you go, tell me about Damascus.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> It's all right.<eos> You... You've got a lot to think about.<eos> We'll talk again.<eos> No, we won't.
That they have their day in the sun, and then it's over.<eos> It's more than a day.<eos> But how long?<eos> A year or two?<eos> To choose or be chosen.<eos> And then, that's our lives settled... for ever.<eos> It's frightening.<eos> You just have to choose right, that's all.<eos> But how will I know?<eos> You will.
I don't want to see your face any more!<eos> Once upon a time, there was a very great nobleman and his name was Bluebeard.<eos> Now, this nobleman had a beautiful young wife, but she died, and some people thought that it was Bluebeard's fault, but didn't dare say so.<eos> And then, one day, Bluebeard thought to himself,<eos> "It's about time I got myself another beautiful, young wife..."<eos> Tell the story, Papa, tell it!<eos> Papa! Come here, I'll tell you the story.<eos> But I want Papa to tell it!<eos> Just come and say goodbye to him.<eos> I will not!
Souvenir.<eos> I'll take that phone, too.<eos> Have a good night.<eos> How soon?<eos> The judge is reviewing the Rule 35 order now.<eos> I mean, once he signs it, if they make an arrest, it won't take these guys long to figure out it was me that talked to the Feds.<eos> Well, once he signs, it'll be a matter of hours, not days.<eos> The WITSEC arrangements are already being made.<eos> - You know where they're sending me?<eos> - Nope. And I never will. Nobody will.
- More than anything.<eos> - I know you do.<eos> And I can also see that Alex is more than just one of your agents.<eos> She's family.<eos> And you want to protect her at all costs.<eos> I get that.<eos> But if you pull her out before she has a chance to save her sister, she will never look at you the same way again.<eos> You know that.<eos> I can't lose her.<eos> And you won't.
Help us.<eos> I thought all your kind were dead.<eos> I am the last.<eos> Earth is my home now.<eos> And I will not let you take it from me.<eos> You stupid girl.<eos> Have you any idea what you're doing?<eos> Yes, I'm stopping you.<eos> Your mother believed she could, but she failed.<eos> I won't.
You have spoiled everything.<eos> Where is he going to live?<eos> How do I know?<eos> He has to live somewhere.<eos> Maybe he will better off somewhere else than with me.<eos> Does he have money?<eos> No idea.<eos> Well, has he taken his card or not?<eos> He didn't need it at the institution.<eos> Now he will.
I like to sit tall in the seat.<eos> Look, um, I have some ideas, and I'd love to share them with you.<eos> I'd love to hear them.<eos> Come to the next dinner.<eos> We'll bang some steaks, talk some concepts.<eos> But I was just hoping that maybe, you know -- no, I know what you were hoping.<eos> Door's always open.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, that's cool, Bobby.<eos> I-I will.
- You never told me that.<eos> - Well, I'm telling you now.<eos> Mr. Almeida walked out of his apartment with the intention to hack Mrs. Almeida into many bloody pieces... starting by taking off her head.<eos> Guess what?<eos> Never happened.<eos> Instead, he woke up in a hospital with two broken arms and a restraining order safety-pinned to his chest.<eos> Jesus, Matt.<eos> If I take a night off, people get hurt.<eos> I don't wanna lose you.<eos> - You won't.
But, you know, you were always...<eos> Please, you don't have to say anything you don't mean.<eos> I always loved you.<eos> I never stopped.<eos> All the time we were apart, every day, your face was right before my eyes.<eos> I know.<eos> Every day, it was as if I could see you.<eos> You can see me now.<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Yes, it's...<eos> Thank you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Your dog has vertigo.<eos> That can't be a thing.<eos> And you are gonna have to carry him until he gets home.<eos> Are you shitting me right now?<eos> I don't shit.<eos> But he will, uncontrollably, for the next 36 hours.
It's okay to be wrong from time to time.<eos> Believe it or not, I've been wrong before.<eos> I know what it feels like.<eos> I'm not wrong.<eos> Not this time.<eos> How much you willing to bet on it?<eos> Everything I've got.<eos> That's a lot to lose.<eos> But I won't lose.<eos> Yes, you will.
You don't have to worry about it.<eos> You can go back to your wife knowing full well that I will make this right.<eos> How?<eos> Mr. Jarvis, I understand that you have a great deal invested into the outcome of this mission.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Whitney Frost shot my wife.<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> No, you're going back to the hospital.<eos> I want her to pay for what she did to us.<eos> And she will.
This is the last piece.<eos> - All set?<eos> - Just like you wanted.<eos> This is the gamma core.<eos> I cannot stress this enough...<eos> Handle with extreme caution.<eos> Got it?<eos> Oh.<eos> Who's doing the honors?<eos> I will.
♪ No ♪<eos> That's why I'm here.<eos> ♪ Don't let me go ♪<eos> ♪ It's hard enough on your own ♪<eos> When did this happen, Drew?<eos> Chicago, right?<eos> October 17, 2014, at 6:31 p.m.<eos> ♪ You're not alone ♪<eos> - ♪ I've been out chasing ghosts ♪<eos> I always will.
And whose fault is that?<eos> So, are you happy here?<eos> Are they taking good care of you?<eos> People come here to die.<eos> Why would I be happy?<eos> I'm getting a promotion.<eos> So, when I get back I'll be able to move you to somewhere better.<eos> Somewhere near the beach or something.<eos> You won't come back.<eos> Of course I will.
No!<eos> No!<eos> Please, stop!<eos> I am not a patient.<eos> Hannah.<eos> Hannah.<eos> She may look like a woman... but she's just a child.<eos> Ignorance, Mr. Lockhart... is the great enemy of science.<eos> I wanna see Pembroke.<eos> And you will.
Come back when they're dead, too.<eos> Yeah, we'll stop them.<eos> We have before.<eos> I'm not talking about the walkers.<eos> Morgan wants to talk to them first.<eos> I think that would be a mistake, but it's not up to me.<eos> I'll talk to the people still at home.<eos> I'll discuss it with the people on guard now, too, but who else wants to approach the Saviors, talk to them first?<eos> What happened here, we won't let that happen again.<eos> I won't.
Let her be. And let this wretched world end and let another begin.<eos> The world of the night.<eos> The world of the bat and the owl and the spider.<eos> The blessed dark.<eos> He's a handsome man, your master. Ah.<eos> Radiant.<eos> And he's been kind to you.<eos> Bountiful with the gore, he's been.<eos> I should like to meet him.<eos> You will.
_<eos> They're just kids.<eos> I'm sorry to disturb you.<eos> Would you like a moment with her?<eos> No.<eos> I'm here to see you.<eos> You made me a promise to support my people.<eos> If Heda's spirit chooses me.<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you still?
Join us, Charles, please.<eos> There's no more need for fighting.<eos> We both know there's no way in hell I'm taking that thing.<eos> Sorry it has to be this way.<eos> How about you, Marcus?<eos> We need him.<eos> He can help us find Clarke and the other A.I.<eos> That was a mistake.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> You will.
You always have a guy.<eos> Autopsy notes on two male skeletons pulled out of the bay, both missing hands and feet.<eos> I'm all ears.<eos> Monty, how's that security footage from the hotel going?<eos> Nothing yet, but I'm still looking through it.<eos> It's a couple weeks' worth of security footage.<eos> Copy.<eos> I've told so many people that they've lost loved ones.<eos> It never gets any easier.<eos> And, Monty, it never will.
Are the tarps holding up?<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, we're headed home.<eos> If it gets too difficult, stay in the storm shelter.<eos> You're well protected there.<eos> There's plenty of food and water.<eos> It should last you until at least we get home.<eos> Sweetheart, please come home in one piece.<eos> - Tell Gilly I love him.<eos> - I will.
Memories are short.<eos> They will forget.<eos> And eventually, so will he.<eos> He will never forget.<eos> Cruel living has already stained his mind.<eos> He'll grow older, stronger.<eos> He'll remember.<eos> Then he will come for me.<eos> Who will protect me then?<eos> I will.
We will show our special branch that they are dogs barking up the wrong tree entirely.<eos> Mr. Drummond, those dockside work gangs, get to the wires.<eos> Sergeant Thatcher. Major Al-Qadir, sir, with me, if you please.<eos> The spice shipments, Assistant Commissioner, all those from South India.<eos> There were five in the last fortnight, and these are names of those men to lead those work gangs.<eos> One such name chimes heavy with me, sir.<eos> And which one is that, Sergeant?<eos> Teague.<eos> He's a union steward.<eos> One moment, if you will, sir.
- How will this reassembling take place?<eos> - Yeah, it's all under good control.<eos> But then once we are prepared, all we have to do is take him.<eos> From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.
From Rose?<eos> It would kill her.<eos> That is a metaphor, darling.<eos> The killing that comes your way, that ain't.<eos> Do you understand what you raise in me, Matthew?<eos> - If this absurd plot of yours fails...<eos> - It won't.<eos> Well, if it does...<eos> I will not spend my last day on Earth in vain, desperate hope.<eos> No, you will.
A few hours.<eos> Will I feel pain?<eos> No, no, you'll be sedated.<eos> Does your wife cook for you?<eos> Yes. Yeah, she's a good cook.<eos> I'd make a horrible wife.<eos> Well, that's not true.<eos> And you're a horrible liar.<eos> I'll miss your hair.<eos> So will I.
And before long, I caught up with him.<eos> And I dragged him to Cape Town in chains.<eos> And then I reported to the infirmary.<eos> I'll admit... I'm envious of their fire.<eos> A bit cavalier, though, don't you think?<eos> Out there in the open, taunting their prey.<eos> There's no need to hide when you've got the numbers.<eos> Ah, but do they?<eos> He's dying of thirst.<eos> We will, too.
I can't even imagine wanting to. Please.<eos> You must believe me.<eos> Oh, I do, Mr. Balfour.<eos> I most certainly do.<eos> You still hoping to take Ethan Talbot alive?<eos> Ethan Talbot is a scourge upon the earth.<eos> Whatever code I have followed... I hereby disavow.<eos> If given the chance, I will shoot him in the back. And butcher all his kind.<eos> And when this one dies?<eos> So will we.
Just do not look at them.<eos> I won't, I won't!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We need to go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't. No, I won't.<eos> I won't.
I won't, I won't!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> We need to go!<eos> There's no time.<eos> Lydia, I'm going to be erased, okay?<eos> Just like Alex.<eos> You're gonna forget me.<eos> I won't. No, I won't.<eos> I won't.<eos> Lydia, you will.
(GROWLING)<eos> (YELLING)<eos> THEO:<eos> Can't find him, can you?<eos> Probably don't even know where to start.<eos> You're not gonna find him.<eos> Let's be honest, he's probably already dead.<eos> I wonder what's gonna happen when Scott realizes that it's your fault.<eos> I should kill you.<eos> Yeah, but you won't.
You know what I mean yeah, well, I don't care.<eos> All right? I'm the Bren'in.<eos> Foster, you don't demand trust.<eos> You earn it.<eos> Why do you think I consented to marry you?<eos> Because I believe that you have the promise to lead fairly and wisely.<eos> But you have to calm yourself, be measured in your thoughts and your deeds.<eos> You treat people right, they'll stop questioning you.<eos> Trust me on that.<eos> I will.
Did you eat yet?<eos> How can I eat without you?<eos> I am waiting.<eos> What girl...<eos> Forget that girl.<eos> Don't ever make that mistake of forgetting her.<eos> Just a minute.<eos> One can even find God if you truly seek Him.<eos> Why can't you find a girl?<eos> Sure you will.
Now, just... I mean, based on how crappy I feel, and how much monster-ness Pandora ripped out of me,<eos> I have a feeling<eos> I'm finally cured of that thing.<eos> Wish I could help.<eos> Mmm... (chuckles)<eos> You know, I was also thinking about getting my old band back together.<eos> I hope that's not gonna be a problem.<eos> - Ooh... - I mean, we'd only want to practice over here, like, three nights a week,<eos> - maybe four, max.<eos> - I'll just...
We made a great record, but it's not enough anymore, Kels.<eos> You need some kind of a story, and the minute that TMZ shows clips from that tape, I promise you, you will be the biggest artist in the world.<eos> - For about 10 seconds.<eos> - It only takes one, pal.<eos> They're gonna click on that link, watch the footage, hear the record, and they're gonna love it because it's great, because you're great.<eos> But they're never gonna know that unless you've got their attention.<eos> And this is how you get the world's attention.<eos> My parents are gonna see that tape.<eos> - Tyler's parents...<eos> - No, they won't.
- Me too.<eos> I was abandoned by my parents when I was just three years old.<eos> Children are so lovely when they are three years of age.<eos> How can anyone abandon a three year old?<eos> Where do you find the nerve?<eos> I never knew you were an orphan, too.<eos> Well... now you know.<eos> - Does Lenny know?<eos> - No.<eos> And he never will.
You know, I've never been in a guy's actual bedroom before.<eos> Are you even listening to me?<eos> I am.<eos> But you raging about Finn when you're stuck in here and can't do anything about it isn't going to help.<eos> What you need is something to take your mind off it.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Is that a challenge?<eos> I just want Finn to suffer for what he did to me.<eos> For what he did to us.<eos> He will.
Yes... yes, well, thank you.<eos> They're delivering the body from the morgue later today.<eos> Would you be available to sit down and discuss funeral arrangements?<eos> Sure... sure, why not?<eos> I could, uh, come by later this morning.<eos> That will be perfect, Norman.<eos> And you should bring whatever outfit you would like us to put her in.<eos> Hello? Are... are you there, Norman?<eos> - Yes, I'm here.<eos> - I'll...
With no accessories.<eos> You have had 30 years to make that call and we both know that you're not going to do it.<eos> But I will.<eos> You poisoned her, didn't you?<eos> You had her for tea yesterday and you poisoned her just like that horse.<eos> She was a maid, for Godsakes.<eos> You were going to marry a maid?<eos> That's pathetic.<eos> I loved Violet.<eos> And I always will.
It seems I'm dealing with a bit ofa mortalitysitch.<eos> I'm bleeding.<eos> I'm just realizing the gravity of what you're saying.<eos> That I'm allergic to lead projectiles?<eos> All I have to do is wait for some pitiful thug to end you.<eos> And right back to Hell you go.<eos> People come to me to ask for favors, and more often than not,<eos> I'm happy to oblige.<eos> What do you get?<eos> A devilish I.O.U., if you will.
HI.<eos> I'm here.<eos> Hi.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know. I'm sorry, too.<eos> We're going to put her under, the way she was when I first saw her.<eos> She won't feel any pain, will she?<eos> She won't feel anything.<eos> We have to try to help her.<eos> We will.
It's for my grandma.<eos> What's that for?<eos> Oh, we used to have somebody come play happy hours, but he was drunk all the time, so they fired him.<eos> Too bad too.<eos> Tips were really good when he was here.<eos> Why?<eos> You play?<eos> A little.<eos> Norman, this handsome dude was just asking if we ever have anyone play that piano.<eos> No, and we never will again.
Quentin! Describe The Beast that attacked you.<eos> How did it get in here?<eos> Mr. Coldwater, what did The Beast say to you?<eos> How did it know your name?<eos> So what is this place exactly, besides a health hazard?<eos> Time was, the finest meat packing plant in town.<eos> Yeah, it's a winner.<eos> Hey, that star on your arm...<eos> - I earned it.<eos> You will too with effort, whole sleeve of 'em.
Well... what we have here is a terminal case of overthinking.<eos> And the only cure? A night of underthinking.<eos> You and I are going out tonight.<eos> I can't tonight. No, I have cribbage with my dad.<eos> Oh, I love cribbage is something no one has ever said.<eos> Go out with me to a little club called...<eos> Aura.<eos> Aura? Yeah, we can't get in there.<eos> I know the bouncer.<eos> Yes, we will.
I am a Mandinka warrior.<eos> Mandinka, eh?<eos> I will kill many Americans for your king!<eos> You'll have to walk.<eos> Head east into the Great Dismal Swamp and meet up with Lord Dunmore's Ethiopian regiment.<eos> You'll be given food, shelter, and a letter of manumission.<eos> What is "a letter of manumission"?<eos> It's the piece of paper that states you're free.<eos> And slave masters will believe this paper?<eos> They will in England. Hyah!
! This is yours?<eos> I-I came in for some kindling.<eos> - I wasn't stealing.<eos> - Get out.<eos> - I ain't gon' tell nobody.<eos> - Get out!<eos> Kizzy, I swear!<eos> Kizzy, it's been a while now.<eos> And I ain't told nobody, just like I said.<eos> And I won't.
You said it was important.<eos> It is, Mrs. Said.<eos> I need your help.<eos> My son is dead.<eos> What else do you want from me?<eos> To help save someone else's son.<eos> A son whose mother is a liar.<eos> Look, Hank is still out there.<eos> Now, if you'll just take a look at this...<eos> I won't!
[ Gasps ] Yay!<eos> ...by 6:00 tonight.<eos> No! It's too much sauce for too little time.<eos> And anyways, I don't have the key ingredient -- the blood peppers.<eos> And my cousin can't send me more from Colombia until next week.<eos> One spicy step ahead of you.<eos> Enter the Serrano pepper!<eos> Chi-caw!<eos> No one will know the difference.<eos> I will.
After that, um then eventually life... life goes back to normal.<eos> After this is all over... if we don't end up seeing each other much, if... this is just a moment in time...<eos> I just want you to know I'm still glad I met you.<eos> Why wouldn't... why wouldn't we...<eos> Don't you want to see each other?<eos> It's just...<eos> Back in the real world, I am going back to debt and custody battles... and... keeping my chemistry in line, and God knows what else.<eos> You shouldn't have to deal with the responsibilities in my crazy life.<eos> Yeah, okay, - what if I want to?<eos> - You won't.
Looking good is pretty dumb when you think about what's happening to us.<eos> True.<eos> I'd kill for a soapy bath right now.<eos> When we get out of here I'll take you to my mum's favourite salon.<eos> Mani-pedi for both of us.<eos> What's that, a drink?<eos> Manicure-pedicure.<eos> Sounds like fun.<eos> If we ever get out of here.<eos> We will.
♪ I just wanna be sure ♪<eos> ♪ Tomorrow is a better day ♪<eos> ♪ I just wanna be sure ♪<eos> ♪ Tomorrow is a better day ♪<eos> ♪ I just wanna be sure ♪<eos> ♪ Tomorrow is a better day... ♪<eos> God, I'm glad to see you.<eos> I know.<eos> We need to need to find Fi.<eos> We will.
Were you actually gonna marry this cult guy?<eos> If I did, would you come back to work here?<eos> Oh, that's it.<eos> I'm leaving.<eos> Please!<eos> It's been months.<eos> Can't you forgive me by now for what happened to the baby?<eos> No!<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
Ugh, she was so perfect.<eos> God, I hated her.<eos> Really?<eos> I thought she was nice.<eos> You know, now that I think about it, not a huge fan.<eos> Yeah, well, I loved her.<eos> Sat behind her in home room for three years.<eos> Smell of cherry lip balm and acne cream still gets me going.<eos> She didn't even know you were alive.<eos> Oh, she will now.
Because, Barry, I need you to know that it doesn't matter to me if you're The Flash or not.<eos> You, Barry... that's who I want to see if I have a future with.<eos> I mean... if you still want that too, of course.<eos> I should go see if Jesse and Wally need anything.<eos> Come on.<eos> And?<eos> He got away, but I'll find him.<eos> Later.<eos> He needs to pay for what he did to my brother!<eos> And he will.
Given the fact I can barely stand.<eos> I'm seeking a divorce.<eos> Now?<eos> I'm dying, Robert.<eos> Elizabeth and I love each other.<eos> We're going to marry.<eos> I'll continue to provide you with the best care and the finest treatment.<eos> You know you can run to Elizabeth as soon as I'm dead. Why can't you wait?<eos> We can't wait.<eos> We won't.
And yet they are the ones punished.<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Dalbir ma'am!<eos> Madam. The new government of Pakistan has put a stay on death penalty.<eos> Sister... they've put an indefinite stay.<eos> It means Sarbjit's death sentenced has been postponed for now.<eos> This means... papa's coming home?<eos> Not yet... but he definitely will.
I get it.<eos> I'm not mad.<eos> It'll give me the cover I need to slip out.<eos> I just need to know it's clear, so do me a favor and tell your boss that nobody leaves until it's safe for me to.<eos> Reid, perimeter agents are pulling back.<eos> You have to let her go.<eos> Well?<eos> Repeat--all agents, do not engage or pursue until the bomb is defused.<eos> You can leave.<eos> But you won't.
I know a guy.<eos> So, Magnus, how long has it been?<eos> One hundred?<eos> One hundred fifty years?<eos> One hundred and thirty-eight.<eos> Oddly, I haven't missed you.<eos> Of course you have, my love.<eos> All right, you two can catch up later.<eos> Right now, we need to find the Book of the White.<eos> And you will, but not without payment.
Where is the doctor?<eos> Where's James?<eos> They're coming.<eos> Make it stop, we have to wait!<eos> There's no stopping, there's no waiting!<eos> I'm scared, Frances, I'm scared, I'm scared I'm going to die,<eos> I'm scared I'm dying, I'm dying! No, look at me. Look at me!<eos> Now, listen.<eos> You are not going to die, I won't let it happen.<eos> I simply won't!
No.<eos> Let me finish.<eos> I figured that we would find some kind of balance, you know?<eos> Your father would give you discipline, some structure; I would give you room to run so you could figure things out.<eos> And I honestly thought that's what was happening to you now.<eos> I thought, maybe he's finally figured it out.<eos> Ugh. What an idiot I was.<eos> - What the hell are these? - Geez.<eos> You want to tell me about them?<eos> Because your father won't.
Experimenting with... too many things.<eos> I wish I could just bury that entire part of my life.<eos> You ever do anything like that when you were young that you regret?<eos> Not really.<eos> I was kind of a nerd student.<eos> I guess I wanted to prove to my mother that I was nothing like her, so I became a lawyer.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> About the same.<eos> I haven't found anything that could help.<eos> You won't.
Did you find anything?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> Nothing.<eos> Dead end.<eos> Do you think you can get to the prison through the tunnels?<eos> Yes, thanks to your map.<eos> If it weren't for Hook, I'd still be rotting in that cell.<eos> You'll tell him that I did the right thing?<eos> That he was right to trust me?<eos> I will.
Sir, they're ready for us.<eos> You should take the lead in there.<eos> Phoebe seems to like you.<eos> I think she'd have been the same with anyone.<eos> Just get her talking.<eos> Only she knows who White is.<eos> Any joy with his van?<eos> It's been found abandoned.<eos> We'll find him, sir.<eos> We will.
- Nothing, nothing.<eos> Just be better another night, okay?<eos> Is this about Riggs?<eos> Can you...<eos> I'm not getting into it.<eos> Everything doesn't need to be talked about.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah, I understand.<eos> So another time you will call me, and we'll go out.<eos> But you won't, will you?
Mike... It wasn't just the look on your father's face.<eos> It's the look on your mother's.<eos> They think I'm taking away your future.<eos> You are my future.<eos> Hey, hey. I am not saying that I don't want to get married.<eos> I'm just saying that if for some reason I was responsible for taking away your dream...<eos> That you'd never be able to live with yourself.<eos> You go finish law school, okay?<eos> And you pass the bar, and you become a lawyer, and then... in two years when I get out, if you still want to marry me...<eos> Oh, I will.

What's your secret?<eos> - Well, usually, I'm in a hurry... - Mmhmm.<eos> So I cook it less time than it says on the box.<eos> You want me to make you another one?<eos> No. I have to save room for dinner.<eos> Good idea.<eos> You should come over and see my computer.<eos> Oh, you know, I think I'm done for the night.<eos> Oh. Well, how about after dinner?<eos> I will.
- Well, usually, I'm in a hurry... - Mmhmm.<eos> So I cook it less time than it says on the box.<eos> You want me to make you another one?<eos> No. I have to save room for dinner.<eos> Good idea.<eos> You should come over and see my computer.<eos> Oh, you know, I think I'm done for the night.<eos> Oh. Well, how about after dinner?<eos> I will.<eos> Not tonight, but, uh, I will.
[Crying]<eos> [Groans]<eos> [Chuckles]<eos> I made it start bleeding again so it looks fresh.<eos> Ben...<eos> Where are we?<eos> Bus station.<eos> Why?<eos> It won't work.<eos> - Yes, it will.
Don't get cocky.<eos> This is the first time you'll be testifying in court, and it can get nerve-racking.<eos> I'll be fine, especially since word on the street is the defense lawyer is a total hack.<eos> Oh, yeah? Who is it?<eos> "Short attention span" Stan?<eos> That guy gets lost in his own cross examinations.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You will be fine.<eos> Too bad you won't be there to see me in action.<eos> - No, but I will.
Do you know... there are cities where the air smells of spices... and women are carried on jeweled chairs?<eos> Would you like to see that?<eos> I would love that, but...<eos> I have responsibilities here.<eos> An ailing child.<eos> Husband.<eos> Ah, a husband.<eos> Well... it would appear a better man than I has won.<eos> But I am in port quite often... should that ever change.<eos> It... it won't.
Some peace.<eos> Barry, listen to me.<eos> You waited for me for years.<eos> You let me get to a place where this was possible.<eos> So I am telling you I am gonna do the same thing for you.<eos> Wherever you need to go, whatever you need to do, do it.<eos> And when you get back, I'll be here.<eos> Okay. I love you, Barry.<eos> I love you too.<eos> And I always will.
I was just looking out for you. It's not that you look out for me.<eos> It's how you look out for me.<eos> So, what's the big break I had to rush over here for?<eos> Amiel didn't commit suicide. He was murdered.<eos> By who, I don't know yet.<eos> You okay?<eos> Mitchie went behind my back and found out about Erica's year off.<eos> Then he tagged my mother in.<eos> - Don't be mad. - He told you, too?<eos> Forcibly and against my will.
I'm j-just gonna say that he passed away.<eos> Father Benedict asked if, uh, someone was gonna speak at the service.<eos> Well, that's up to you.<eos> Well, I'd... be too emotional, too sappy.<eos> Dad would hate that.<eos> I thought you might like to do it.<eos> I don't think that I'm the guy to get up and talk about Dad.<eos> Maybe Erin or Shane.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I won't.
Odin.<eos> I win, Preacher.<eos> Now, I'm telling you...<eos> Serve God.<eos> I ask you again.<eos> Will you serve God?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will.
I win, Preacher.<eos> Now, I'm telling you...<eos> Serve God.<eos> I ask you again.<eos> Will you serve God?<eos> Of course I will.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> Of course.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Justice has finally come for your friend.<eos> Pray it hasn't come for you, too.<eos> Why don't you lose your mask?<eos> You're not as scary as you think.<eos> Twelve hours from the exact time the last alien was kidnapped to his time of death.<eos> Which means she doesn't have long.<eos> Your sister wasn't his target.<eos> Well, maybe that doesn't mean anything to him.<eos> - We have to find her.<eos> - And we will.
Go in?<eos> Raven, no.<eos> - Our mission is...<eos> - To wait for Clarke, like always.<eos> But what if we can do this ourselves?<eos> We have Becca's backdoor password.<eos> We have me.<eos> You said the moment we use the password,<eos> A.L.I.E. will know.<eos> She will.
What do you mean we're not?<eos> Here's how this is gonna go.<eos> We're all going to the reception and we're gonna pretend to have a good time.<eos> And we're gonna get Marjorie off on her honeymoon without her knowing anything.<eos> Doesn't Marjorie deserve... ?<eos> Marjorie deserves to be happy.<eos> We'll tell her after she gets back from the cruise.<eos> Christy, I don't, I-I don't think I can hold it together.<eos> Yeah, well, you will.<eos> All of us will.
Yeah, and trust me, every possible way you're second-guessing me right now, I've already done it.<eos> This is our best chance.<eos> Listen.<eos> I know that this is totally crazy and not what anyone expected or asked for, okay?<eos> But what Caroline is doing for me...<eos> I am getting to have the family that I thought I lost forever.<eos> Please.<eos> Now, you make sure that nothing happens to them.<eos> Please.<eos> I will.
Me?<eos> No, not you.<eos> Well, you don't strike me as the right thing kind of guy, anyway.<eos> People change.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> I just heard.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That baby will never know how special she was.<eos> He will.
You sure?<eos> It seemed your son was pretty serious about it.<eos> He won't push it.<eos> Not after tonight.<eos> What do you mean, tonight?<eos> He lost the presidency.<eos> Sorry.<eos> So am I.<eos> I hope we have some time together.<eos> Mm. We will.
They're almost in Syria.<eos> Via Guvecci.<eos> And our 2 men?<eos> They can intercept them before the border.<eos> Good. The men who escorted Raymond can try to bring him back.<eos> One was a sniper in Beirut.<eos> Just the 2 of them?<eos> They'll hold them until the Turks get there.<eos> - They'll blow their cover.<eos> - Yes, they will.
So, I want you to go.<eos> To leave me sitting here amidst my folly, surrounded by my stupidity for all the world to see.<eos> For my father to look down on.<eos> Do you think he will be proud?<eos> Amelia...<eos> Please make him go.<eos> Stupid shoe!<eos> I'll have to have it seen to.<eos> Will you look at it for me?<eos> - Yes, of course I will.
You're in danger.<eos> You take a walk and get some fresh air.<eos> Okay? I'm not asking you.<eos> I'll walk you out.<eos> If anything occurs, you'll contact me?<eos> Of course.<eos> Type in your number.<eos> This is more than a job to me.<eos> If something happens to Carlos...<eos> Nothing will.
Just you and me.<eos> What do you think?<eos> I-i just... I just want to see you, care.<eos> I want to see you, too.<eos> But... It's kind of a war zone over here right now, and...<eos> Alaric really...<eos> He needs you.<eos> Yeah, I get it.<eos> Well, we'll-we'll figure it out once this huntress thing is over.<eos> Yes. We will.
I got... yeah...<eos> I got to write on this, so...<eos> That's two squad cars in two days.<eos> Yeah. Looks like he's running hurt.<eos> Yeah. Check out the trunk.<eos> Well, that's not department issue.<eos> That blood on the barrel...<eos> We know whose it is?<eos> No, sir. We don't.<eos> And we probably won't for a while.
Rip it out.<eos> This is the only chance these people have to contact their loved ones.<eos> Oh, you mean it's your only opportunity to reach out and haunt your infant son.<eos> Looks like Chisel Chin, Jr. Will just have to go to bed without what I can imagine are terribly dull bedtime stories.<eos> Cruella, why are you doing this?<eos> Is this because I won't write you back to life?<eos> I'm not the one that ordered all the phones to be ripped out down here.<eos> Well, with all you heroes running around, the place he feels has a little too much hope bubbling up in his realm.<eos> Well, you can tell him it's gonna take a lot more than ripping out phones to discourage us.<eos> I will.
See?<eos> I knew that once he got to know my sweet...<eos> Hey, whoa, whoa!<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Why you got to turn everything into an excuse to hug me?<eos> Don't flatter yourself.<eos> Nobody wants to hug you anyway!<eos> I'll hug him tonight when he's asleep.<eos> Can you sign this form saying you take full responsibility for the school camera, editing equipment, the sound equipment, and lighting packet while it's in my possession?<eos> No, we will not.
Money?<eos> Sex?<eos> Is the Kama Sutra that good?<eos> Or was she that unhappy?<eos> Tomorrow morning, early... you will leave for Russia... to begin a new life.<eos> Russia?<eos> I know it's not easy.<eos> It's the only way.<eos> Okay. And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
Not when you see what Daesh does.<eos> Chama?<eos> Let me hold you.<eos> It'll take a long time to forget.<eos> Give me your hands.<eos> Let me go.<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> I won't let you go!<eos> I won't!
I want in.<eos> He's your cousin, Anthony.<eos> And I'm 100% certain he's innocent.<eos> But if one of my family's accused of something like this, then I think another one of my family deserves a chance to clear his name.<eos> And what if the facts fall otherwise?<eos> I'd arrest my own mother if I thought she was scamming cops.<eos> Your own mother.<eos> Well, with a lot of back-up.<eos> Please, Erin, don't insult me.<eos> I won't.
We have, Your Honor.<eos> On the charges of rape and sodomy in the first degree, we find the defendants, Noel Panko and Bobby D'Amico, not guilty.<eos> Mr. D'Amico and Mr. Panko, you are free to go.<eos> The State of New York thanks the jury for their service.<eos> I'm a national joke.<eos> Nobody's gonna believe me, ever.<eos> Hey, Kristi.<eos> Kristi.<eos> I know exactly what those guys did to you.<eos> Nobody else will.
Someone's moving up the timeline.<eos> Do you have the money?<eos> First let me talk to my daughter.<eos> Not until we get what we want.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> He's testing you.<eos> Push back-- let him know you're serious.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> What if he doesn't call back?<eos> He will.
Who do you work for?<eos> American military?<eos> And where's your friend who was shooting at us?<eos> I'm doing recon for a client.<eos> They want to buy an item.<eos> They'll beat any price.<eos> And you heard about this item where?<eos> Antiquities market is small.<eos> People talk.<eos> And so will you.
It was just, well...<eos> Don't make me relive it.<eos> Well, the good news is we're back on our feet, and we're days away from having this whole trial business behind us.<eos> A white wine, please, and for the lady...<eos> A white wine as well.<eos> Our lawyer, Bram Keller...<eos> He thinks that this trial could be as important as Scopes.<eos> Didn't Scopes lose?<eos> He did.<eos> Yes. But we won't.
And while I love a wedding with scale, I can also embrace the simple elegance of this.<eos> Guy, could you let the clerk know that we're here and we're ready?<eos> Right.<eos> We are gathered here in the sight of God and in the presence of this witness to join together this man and this woman in holy matrimony, which is an honorable estate and not to be entered into lightly or unadvisedly but reverently and discreetly.<eos> William Masters, will you have this woman, Virginia Johnson, to be thy wedded wife?<eos> Will you love her, honor her, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Virginia Johnson, will you have this man, William Masters, to be thy wedded husband?<eos> Will you love him, honor him, keep him in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
Roman's wolves are loyal to Roman.<eos> Your father's wolves are loyal to his money.<eos> The Albino's not on the payroll, he does what he does out of personal interest.<eos> But for the rest, it is true, and it works.<eos> I have created a finely tuned system to manage such a large Pack.<eos> I do not want to lose that, so I am willing to make a deal with you.<eos> What kind of deal?<eos> Sasha Antonov.<eos> If Roman has Sasha, the feud will end.<eos> And so will the list.
I was just kind of letting you know.<eos> If I wanted to protect my friendship with Nancy,<eos> I knew I had to get to Shelly before she ratted me out.<eos> Hi, Shelly.<eos> Having fun?<eos> You know, sometimes adults say silly things that kids don't understand, like when they talk about mortgages or other people's parenting skills.<eos> You might think you get it, but your brain hasn't actually developed the capacity for irony yet.<eos> In fact, your head's probably still soft.<eos> If I touched it right now, my finger would probably go right through it.<eos> Not that I will.
Have you asked him?<eos> Not yet. Still making sure IAC is my only option.<eos> Well, if it is,<eos> I just hope you know what you're doing to your career.<eos> I don't want this career.<eos> Want to be a tax lawyer now? Hadn't thought of that.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I never saw this kitchen finished.<eos> Neither did Daniel.<eos> Well, maybe he will one day.
You are not allowed to use the F word.<eos> You don't mean it.<eos> You're only saying you forgive me because you don't think that we're gonna pull this off.<eos> And look, yeah, it's gonna be tight, Bonnie.<eos> But we're gonna make it.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> So I don't accept your forgiveness, you understand?<eos> You are gonna have to stay strong, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
- She's in Woodley Park.<eos> - Got it.<eos> Martha, we need to go.<eos> No! If you don't walk away from me right now...<eos> If you could go back with Martha, would you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I'd understand.<eos> Tomorrow morning, you will leave for Russia.<eos> And how soon before you come?<eos> I won't.
You want to celebrate your birthday with a clean bill of health.<eos> I swiped your license while you were in the shower last night.<eos> Why didn't you tell me it was coming up?<eos> 'Cause I hate my birthday.<eos> Well, that is only because you've never had me to celebrate it with you.<eos> I'm gonna make it fun.<eos> I promise.<eos> It's Laurel.<eos> Tell her that I'm really sorry about her grandmother, okay?<eos> I will.
Annalise isn't mad at you.<eos> She tried to kill me, Laurel.<eos> Shetellyouthat? Justtellherthis,okay ?<eos> We'reeven.<eos> Wait, don't say anything else.<eos> No need to send any more hit men my way.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I saw you flirting, and I got jealous, so I told him...to back off.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> No, it will.
Hello, Wally.<eos> Are you him?<eos> Are you the voice I've been hearing inside my head?<eos> I am Alchemy.<eos> I've been having visions of another life.<eos> Where... where I have speed, where, I'm...<eos> The Flash.<eos> I can give you that back, should you desire it.<eos> I just want the pain to stop.<eos> It will, child.
You want to read your confession before you sign it?<eos> Screw you!<eos> Now, Sergeant, I am offering you an opportunity here.<eos> I'm not owning up to this.<eos> You did this.<eos> Yeah, but I used your gun to shoot Private Collins.<eos> Apparently, he walked in on your attempted illegal appropriation of WMD for your own personal gain.<eos> I got 6 men out there who'll testify to that.<eos> No one will ever believe your story.<eos> I will.
True love?<eos> -Did you have anyone in particular in--<eos> -Oh, hi! -I'm Miranda.<eos> -Hey. I'm Owen.<eos> Hey, Owen.<eos> I saw you singing with the choir.<eos> I was thinking about joining, so...<eos> Oh, you should. We could use all the talented singers we can get.<eos> You should come to rehearsals tomorrow. Okay.<eos> Maybe I will.
You didn't know that?<eos> You're number one speed dial on my phone!<eos> Okay.<eos> What do you need?<eos> Your keys and your coat.<eos> Thanks, bestie.<eos> Are you sure you're well enough to drive?<eos> - Absolutely. - Okay.<eos> Well, promise me you'll be careful.<eos> I will.
Listen to me...<eos> I've finally found the right man...<eos> He's right at the door...<eos> Please don't say anything stupid in front of him.<eos> - I beg of you!<eos> - Laxmi!<eos> I beg of you!<eos> I finally have a decent life.<eos> Please don't ruin it!<eos> You won't, right?
Or I'm not going to eat.<eos> God bless you child...<eos> What if she's poisoned my food?<eos> I used to feed you with so much love...<eos> I've lost my appetite.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> He's gone finally...<eos> He is gone.<eos> He won't come back, right?<eos> He won't.
A doctor and a journalist.<eos> - You get it? - Yeah, I get it.<eos> The choice is simple, you see.<eos> It's kill one, and the other will go free.<eos> But if your answer to me is "no," a thousand watts into them will go.<eos> Sorry, Jervis.<eos> I'm not killing anyone.<eos> Yes, you will! Now pick up the pistol and fire!<eos> You want to show me who I really am, then show me.<eos> Oh, I will.
I'm the one you want.<eos> So let Lee and Vale go.<eos> Keep me but let them go.<eos> You're trying to confuse me.<eos> But I won't let you.<eos> No. I'm determined that you'll live on and suffer without your love as I have.<eos> Choose.<eos> No.<eos> I won't choose.<eos> You will. You will.
I think.<eos> She's out of the hospital, anyway.<eos> - You two are not...? - No.<eos> I'm not trying to make this awkward.<eos> Why would it be?<eos> We're both adults.<eos> There's no reason we can't work together.<eos> I'm glad you feel that way.<eos> Mario agrees?<eos> He will.
Sure, but... his was used 20 minutes ago.<eos> He hasn't logged out.<eos> Call the police.<eos> Now.<eos> You're ahead of schedule.<eos> Our paths weren't meant to cross just yet.<eos> But I'm not gonna kill you yet.<eos> I do that, you become the martyr, and she'll carry you in her heart forever.<eos> Before I kill you, she has to hate you.<eos> And she will.
Oh, great.<eos> Much better.<eos> I did it to save your life.<eos> After the rebellion, your father was angry.<eos> Deeply angry.<eos> He wanted to destroy you.<eos> I begged him not to.<eos> I asked him to send you to hell instead.<eos> I did it because I love you, son.<eos> And I always will.
No.<eos> Nyx, there's no other way.<eos> What?<eos> Nyx, what?<eos> I can't let them send you back.<eos> They're not sending me anywhere, Nyx.<eos> I'm choosing to go.<eos> - What other choice do we have?<eos> - We can fight.<eos> We will.
There were footprints in the dirt leading that way.<eos> Parn Heidekker.<eos> Parn Heidekker.<eos> Heidekker?<eos> Is that a name?<eos> Stop them coming.<eos> Please, you must stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> I have child who is scared.<eos> I will.
So this little guy is gonna get to meet his grandma after all.<eos> Take him to the NICU and page Karev.<eos> Um, Karev's in the clinic.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Uh, just take him to the NICU.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Know what?<eos> If Kara's mom would ever forgive her.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> Of course she will.
This whole thing was a huge mistake.<eos> Do your friends even know what happened to you?<eos> It's time for you to leave.<eos> I see you for who you really are, and if that scares you, fine, but I'm a real friend and...<eos> We are not friends, Ophelia.<eos> You are completely demented.<eos> At least I'm not a coward.<eos> Don't contact me again.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
SCREWDRIVER WHIRS<eos> - That was very brave.<eos> - He killed her.<eos> He did even think about it.<eos> He just...<eos> HE GROANS<eos> ALL GASP<eos> DOOR OPENS<eos> Will he live?<eos> Yes, yes, he will.
Five-hundred words on the dual Metallo attacks in Metropolis and National City with eyewitness accounts, comments from police sources and zero adjectives, all thoroughly vetted and verified.<eos> - You don't work here.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> Not if I don't say so.<eos> You will.<eos> Read it and you'll see.<eos> You done wasting my time?<eos> You don't want it?<eos> Fine.<eos> Plenty of other outlets will.
I can't.<eos> In my pants, back pocket.<eos> There's a picture.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> Let me see her.<eos> My sweet, sweet baby.<eos> I want to talk to my Flora.<eos> Baby girl.<eos> If by chance you see this, the first thing you have to know, is I love you.<eos> I always will.
I can get you medicine and some supplies.<eos> Might as well take advantage of the darkness.<eos> The man in all the pictures Is that your dad?<eos> Uncle Eli.<eos> He raised us.<eos> Yo, I got to head to Canelo's.<eos> This late?<eos> Why? With all the power out, there's gonna be looting.<eos> Gabe doesn't know about the night job.<eos> And he never will.
- the Cardinals were scouting me, but...<eos> - ‭Scouting you?<eos> So, if the Cardinals have been scouting you, then you've been thinking about sticking with baseball for a while?<eos> - Uh, well, Ginny... - You lied when you told me you wanted me to come<eos> - to your last games?<eos> - Ginny, you're in Midland.<eos> Okay? No one knows you're here.<eos> What do you...?<eos> They know about us.<eos> Soon, everyone will.
- Cute.<eos> I knew throwing you at the bottom of the Murder Board would make you spin out.<eos> Do I belong here?<eos> In your mind?<eos> Simple question, really.<eos> I was the one who recruited you here.<eos> I believe you may be special.<eos> And you keep working as hard as you are, and we're gonna have a talk.<eos> Very soon.<eos> Yes, we will.
I'm worried they need me for something else.<eos> If we could just find a way to see under one person's mask, we could figure out who they are and how they know each other, what they want.<eos> Maybe if you ask nicely, one of them will take off their mask.<eos> Actually, that's not far off from what I was thinking.<eos> I just hope Alex is inside the perimeter.<eos> All right, let's go over this one more time.<eos> You need entrances, exits, number of terrorists, hostages, explosives, how they're rigged, armaments, hostage locations, and if bio weapons are a real threat or a bluff.<eos> Anything I'm forgetting?<eos> Alex, please be careful.<eos> Okay. I will.
Yeah, and I said I was sorry at the trial.<eos> Look, we've got eight months left to live.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm not going to let him rot in jail.<eos> It's practically a death sentence.<eos> Well, what if you get caught?<eos> Then you'll both be in jail when the world ends.<eos> If the world ends, which it might not,<eos> - by the way.<eos> - It will.
I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> No, no. How did you...<eos> You really think dried squid ink can hold me?<eos> I'm far too powerful for that now.<eos> Look, I know you want me back, Rumple.<eos> It's... it's never gonna happen.<eos> I know.<eos> But I cannot lose another son, Belle.<eos> I won't.
You're not giving her away.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I came from the same place as you. And now I'm here.<eos> I believe in the Process.<eos> They have to say it in so many words.<eos> I need confirmation from both of you.<eos> It's very important to me.<eos> Isabella will apply to the Process.<eos> And she will pass.<eos> She will.
Raising alarms and stress levels at number two: Beeps.<eos> They scored sky-high in the annoying stakes.<eos> So, the sooner white noise rains on their beeping parade, the better.<eos> This sucks.<eos> Finally, at number one: Those try-hard humans, the talking machines.<eos> If you want to speak to an operator, press seven.<eos> We've never really gotten along with machines that talk and try to understand us.<eos> Who saw you?<eos> She saw me.<eos> - And maybe we never will.
Here you go, Mr. Katz.<eos> Just three quick initials and you'll be on your way.<eos> We can't do this.<eos> Of course we can.<eos> I came out here to accomplish something.<eos> Not to just give up when things got a little tough.<eos> We're not giving up, Bryson.<eos> What does it matter if we skip the shitty parts?<eos> - No one's gonna know.<eos> - Well, I will.
It's gone. I mean, someone's taken it. It's not here.<eos> Kaulder?<eos> What?<eos> - What?<eos> Miranda.<eos> Miranda!<eos> You're too late, witch hunter.<eos> She died badly, screaming.<eos> Alone.<eos> Just like you will.
You know, your sisters... Stepsisters, have asked for parasols and lace.<eos> What will you have?<eos> Bring me the first branch your shoulder brushes on your journey.<eos> That's a curious request.<eos> Well, you'll have to take it with you on your way and think of me when you look at it.<eos> And when you bring it back, it means that you'll be with it.<eos> And that's what I really want.<eos> For you to come back.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I will.
She was the only one of her kind in the whole universe.<eos> I remember her.<eos> I remember all of it.<eos> She's not gone.<eos> She's still here?<eos> It is only with the heart that one can see rightly. What is essential is invisible to the eye.<eos> He'll always be with me.<eos> I understand now.<eos> - Please tell the Aviator I remember him!<eos> - I will!
No, I like Italians.<eos> I'm half-Italian.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> That was a lie.<eos> So, then I...<eos> There, yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will come to the party and I cannot stop trailing off.<eos> - All right.<eos> - But I will now.
I guess that true.<eos> - What are you doing out here?<eos> - Well.<eos> There's not much call for imaginary friends lately.<eos> So, I. You know...<eos> Yeah, yeah, Don't be sad.<eos> Tell you what.<eos> When I get back up to Headquarters.<eos> I'll make sure Riley remembers you.<eos> - You will?
That can't be real.<eos> Okay, so you're seeing the same thing I'm seeing?<eos> What kind of mushrooms did that guy put on our burgers?<eos> - They're ready for you, Mr. President.<eos> I've got to explain this to the National Security Council. Listen and do me a favor Sam...<eos> Watch that again.<eos> See if there's anything you can find to help us out.<eos> Yeah. I can sit in your chair?<eos> No, you can't, and everything is recorded.<eos> Okay, I won't, I won't, I won't.
- Give me the pipe!<eos> - Wedge it under the handle!<eos> Watch out, Mom!<eos> Watch out, Claire! Die!<eos> Die!<eos> Ray!<eos> Ray! Ray, he's not getting in!<eos> He's not getting in.<eos> It'll hold.<eos> It will.
I think you do.<eos> How many teeth do you have?<eos> Jess, you should tell her.<eos> I know, I'm sorry.<eos> I just don't wanna rub it in that my life is great right now.<eos> She'll resent you more if you don't tell her.<eos> I'm telling Kit.<eos> It's my news, too.<eos> - Jay! Please, let me tell her in my own time.<eos> Fine, I won't.
You sure do have a repetitive nature, Samuel.<eos> - I mean it. - Mean what?<eos> What are you gonna do if I don't?<eos> Command the Lord to strike me dead with a lightning bolt?<eos> We were friends.<eos> I'm asking you... stop doing what you're doing to Tom Watson.<eos> Tom Watson shook my hand and agreed to a deal.<eos> - He's not going to leave.<eos> - He will.<eos> One way or another, he will.
Just... Well, I wash it, Mrs Kehoe, with soap.<eos> There's nothing wrong with soap.<eos> Soap was good enough for Our Lord, I expect.<eos> Oh, and which brand did he use, Miss McAdam?<eos> Does the Bible tell you that?<eos> Our Lord was a man, anyway.<eos> He didn't care about greasy skin.<eos> Ladies, no more talk about Our Lord's complexion at dinner, please.<eos> The girls will help you find something suitable, Eilis.<eos> - Won't you, girls?
Oodles, I say.<eos> Ooh. -I don't know.<eos> That sounds risky.<eos> -What's risky?<eos> He's suggesting we... knock off Ezekiel Grant's poker game.<eos> - It's in Yuma tomorrow night.<eos> Yuma's less than a day's walk from here.<eos> That poker game, there's practically gonna be an army protecting' it.<eos> If Tommy says we can beat 'em, I'll believe him.<eos> - We all will.
Brooder, compact your gear to the essentials.<eos> I shall.<eos> Sorry about Saucy.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> She was top quality.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We'll carry your stuff.<eos> Go on, get ahead of us.<eos> When you pack, don't forget her medical kit.<eos> We won't.
We both even have the same middle name.<eos> I know.<eos> You are amazing, Larry Elizabeth Gaye.<eos> But despite how wonderfully everything was going, something just didn't feel right.<eos> Do you have to go?<eos> No, I went when I woke up.<eos> So, when you come back to LA, will I see you?<eos> Look, I, um, the thing is...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you will.
Hey, you. This young man here, he's a Gaye. And when you mess with a Gaye, you mess with Gayes everywhere.<eos> And some of us Gayes have a vicious temper.<eos> You feel me?<eos> You feel me on that?<eos> Scram!<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Hey, it's what dads do.<eos> So, are you gonna be, like, staying with us from now on?<eos> Well, actually, Son, I...<eos> I... I will.
And some of us Gayes have a vicious temper.<eos> You feel me?<eos> You feel me on that?<eos> Scram!<eos> Thanks, Dad.<eos> Hey, it's what dads do.<eos> So, are you gonna be, like, staying with us from now on?<eos> Well, actually, Son, I...<eos> I... I will.<eos> Of course I will.
- What are you doing here?<eos> - Checking on my investment.<eos> You've come to the wrong place.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> I couldn't find you at the party.<eos> How are you, Mrs. Donnelly?<eos> Why did you come here, really?<eos> To pay my respects to you.<eos> There's nothing I admire more than someone planting trees under whose shade they may never get to sit.<eos> Others will.
Ten years in a maximum-security prison.<eos> You have 30 days to get your affairs in order.<eos> Just run them over!<eos> I can't go to jail.<eos> I'll die in there.<eos> That's not gonna happen, James, because I'm gonna put my investigators on this twenty-four-seven until we find out who really did this.<eos> Just stay in county lines with that thing on. Otherwise, the U.S. Marshals will be down there pronto.<eos> Son, I want you to stay strong.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I will.
The information I require is in two places.<eos> Your secure database, and inside your head.<eos> Berlin, they found her in Berlin.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Okay, Okay.<eos> File 5-1-7, access code G21-12-57.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But you won't find her.<eos> She's a ghost.<eos> I will.
Get up!<eos> Tonight we hold a solemn supper, sir, and I'll request your presence.<eos> Let Your Highness command upon me to the which my duties are, with a most indissoluble tie, forever knit.<eos> Ride you this afternoon?<eos> Ay, my good Lord.<eos> We should have else desired your good advice in this day's council, but we'll take tomorrow.<eos> Is't far you ride?<eos> As far, my Lord, as will fill up the time 'twixt this and supper, go not my horse the better.<eos> Fail not our feast.<eos> My Lord, I will not.
No, we still have law.<eos> call the police and we come.<eos> We'll crack this case. The bastards won't get away with it.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> We're relying on you, Sgt. Po.<eos> Of course, it's my duty.<eos> But Master Ip you know the score.<eos> The police can't keep watch here all day. We need your help.<eos> Tell people to be careful.<eos> - I will.
All I know is that they put me into a sleeping sim and when I woke all hell was breaking loose.<eos> Heck, don't play with it.<eos> You all know what this means.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - For helping us.<eos> - I wish I could do more.<eos> I had no idea Jeanine was capable of something like this.<eos> It's time we fight back.<eos> - We don't have the numbers.<eos> - We will.
"...what's happening to you."<eos> I spent my whole life trying to make up for one mistake.<eos> I did everything right.<eos> And I still ended up in hell.<eos> Zoe, we can help you.<eos> Frank said we can fix this.<eos> - We just need more time. - Oh, no.<eos> It's too late for that.<eos> You have no idea what you've done.<eos> But you will.
This thing is almost over.<eos> Hang tight.<eos> Hello, bound lady.<eos> Not now, Aldo.<eos> I think Mr. Fine has underestimated you.<eos> You found your targets, you tracked them down, you fought very hard.<eos> Susan... you are a good agent.<eos> You'll get them next time, huh?<eos> Unless we die here.<eos> Then you will not.
Richie, this, right now... this will be the best part.<eos> The dying part?<eos> Not the dying part.<eos> The living.<eos> You... you folks from the mystic east... Have a much better handle on the whole Karma, life/death thing.<eos> Rumi writes, "there's a candle in your heart, ready to be kindled."<eos> There's a void in your soul, ready to be filled.<eos> "You feel it, don't you?"<eos> Richie.<eos> You will. I...
The Brave One has been nominated for an Academy Award.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes, really!<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I don't know. It's like Roman Holiday.<eos> Oh, Hymie, this is nothing like Roman Holiday.<eos> Roman Holiday had a guy with a name and a body they could give the award to.<eos> There is no Robert Rich.<eos> Who gets the thing if it wins?<eos> Well, maybe it won't.
Thank you.<eos> - What is his name?<eos> - Not even I know his name yet.<eos> How can that be?<eos> Do you not know him?<eos> Surely, as an avid reader you know that the husband of a princess can only be discovered through a tournament.<eos> So I won't choose him myself.<eos> What if I don't love him?<eos> You will love him, Violet.<eos> You will.
" Dr Pierson, E.R. med one. " " Dr Pierson, E.R. med one. "<eos> I wish I had never met Mike Webster.<eos> They destroyed us.<eos> And I don't understand why it is happening this way.<eos> Bennet, listen to me.<eos> Do you know what I chose to fake?<eos> You.<eos> We will have this family.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
If I do a good job, nobody can fault you.<eos> Either way, it doesn't hurt your chances in 2016.<eos> Well, I appreciate you coming by before going public.<eos> It is classy, and thoughtful.<eos> I won't actively block you.<eos> The rest is on your shoulders.<eos> Thank you, Senator.<eos> Tell the president I'm doing this out of respect to you.<eos> Frank's still on my shit list till I beat him in the general.<eos> I will.
I can tell that story anytime.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> Zach?<eos> Honey?<eos> Are you crying?<eos> Zach is really upset.<eos> You should talk to him.<eos> It's the girl stuff.<eos> He doesn't wanna talk to me about it.<eos> Okay, I will.
How many people have I killed over the years?<eos> And for what?<eos> After Peter, I've had enough.<eos> I-I-I can't take anymore.<eos> I wanna know what's out there.<eos> We deserve to know.<eos> I'm ready to face whatever it is.<eos> I-If-If your fiancée is out there and there's still a future for you with her, we'll face that too.<eos> I just... I can't leave here without you.<eos> I won't.
His heart ain't in it.<eos> All right, OK. Well, let's go get him, then, shall we?<eos> - Where is he? On Ormsby Street, yeah?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Jump in, I'll give you a lift.<eos> Nah, you're all right.<eos> I'm gonna walk. It's a lovely day for it.<eos> Don't forget this lot.<eos> They're very important.<eos> I won't.
That means showtime!<eos> How do you catch demons, Lord Zhong?<eos> Using my eyes ... I fix my eyes on them ... untill they reveal themselves!<eos> So what are demons like in broad daylight?<eos> Most demons take the form of beautiful women.<eos> Are there any demons, Lord Zhong will not slay?<eos> Come see my performance tomorrow night!<eos> Depends on who it is!<eos> Sister, what if he doesn't come tomorrow?<eos> He will!
Again?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why not?<eos> So you're saying you like having me around?<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> I think you know that.<eos> Because my lease is up at the end of the month.<eos> Oh! I see what you did there.<eos> You said we'd talk about it.<eos> And we will, but right now, cake!
I've been on the telephone with the Bishop's secretary for the last half an hour.<eos> Well, go on.<eos> Don't be a tease.<eos> What did the Bishop want with a lowly curate?<eos> Apparently, he likes the work I've been doing, wants to meet me in person to tell me so.<eos> How marvellous.<eos> Are we supposed to go to him or is he coming here?<eos> Well, he'll want to meet me too, won't he?<eos> I didn't actually ask him.<eos> Well, of course he will.
Are you okay?<eos> I told him about your cancer.<eos> Here.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Keep it. Keep it, it's for your treatment.<eos> I'm getting free treatment from the government.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Keep it. I'm sure you have other expenses.<eos> Yeah, I do...if you come along.<eos> Will you?
He didn't want to be there.<eos> We had a deal, Doc.<eos> I should never have agreed to this.<eos> And I never should have helped you.<eos> Rex would be back in Broken Hill right now.<eos> Just do it, Doc.<eos> Please.<eos> Just hook me up to that machine and do it.<eos> I can't, Rex.<eos> I won't.
There is a city called Paris.<eos> I can see that not the living but the dead will conquer Paris.<eos> We are running out of fresh food.<eos> The city is beginning to starve.<eos> I believe we must attempt to come to terms with them.<eos> We should never give in to these vile pagans.<eos> Otherwise we will have failed, and that is how we would be judged.<eos> The Franks want to discuss a way to end the siege.<eos> You have all failed!<eos> I will not.
I know, I know.<eos> It's all right.<eos> All right, girl.<eos> It didn't eat them.<eos> It's killing for sport.<eos> Units on standby, ready for go. Good.<eos> Hold off on that live feed.<eos> We've got an evolving situation here.<eos> Did they give you the green light yet?<eos> They will.
He has a head wound, but nothing serious.<eos> But do they know he's dead?<eos> They think he was just missing, since we didn't find his body.<eos> We have to tell them.<eos> They'll have to believe us.<eos> I don't think that's a good idea.<eos> I didn't ask you.<eos> No one else knows what happened to him. No one knows he's dead.<eos> If we all tell them, they'll believe us.<eos> No, they won't.
Are you sure?<eos> 'Cause he had something sweet<eos> - right before he got sick.<eos> - You must be mistaken.<eos> - The blood tests prove it.<eos> - I know my son, and he would never break the rules.<eos> Why don't you help me find him and you can ask him for yourself?<eos> - Soren will return on his own time.<eos> - What if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
You... you think it likes you?<eos> Let me show you how much.<eos> Cry really loud so all the sisters can hear you.<eos> Good baby.<eos> You have no friends.<eos> Julia.<eos> Alan is here.<eos> We're running out of time.<eos> If we don't find...<eos> We will.
You can call me Aleister.<eos> Savannah!<eos> I've never heard of you before.<eos> The coven doesn't tell you anything.<eos> They're not your family, they don't care.<eos> But I do.<eos> And I want you to show them who you really are.<eos> You are the most powerful witch of all.<eos> I don't even have my powers yet.<eos> But you will.
We're all dead by dawn.<eos> We're all dead by dawn. We're all dead by dawn...<eos> Bitten 2x07 - Bad Dreams 03/21/2015<eos> I was thinking... we should go away for a bit.<eos> Just a few days, somewhere warm.<eos> Get your mind off what happened.<eos> What happened to me at Aleister's...<eos> I hate that it took me so long to find you.<eos> I thought I lost you.<eos> You never will.
- is to kill Clay.<eos> - Jeremy, that is not going to happen.<eos> What if we find Aleister's body and just kill it instead?<eos> It's not going to bring Clay back.<eos> That would just lock Aleister in Clay's body forever.<eos> Then we do that.<eos> We trap him, we hold him in the cage, and we wait.<eos> Clay's strong, Jeremy, he can fight this, okay?<eos> I know he can!<eos> He will!
We have time.<eos> No. She's not what I need.<eos> We know it worked.<eos> Put me back in my body.<eos> Enter the circle, Clara.<eos> When all the witches are dead, it will just be you and me.<eos> What are they planning?<eos> Clara wants to possess a new body.<eos> Who survives the Undoing?<eos> Clara will.
We're wasting our time.<eos> We're not going to find anything here that'll lead us to Aleister.<eos> Have you felt anything yet?<eos> Some sounds are distorted, but I haven't felt the need to Change.<eos> You think it's true?<eos> That the curse is lifting?<eos> That we won't be werewolves anymore?<eos> Jeremy wouldn't say it if he didn't believe it.<eos> Look, I know what it means for us not be a wolves anymore, but if it happens, our lives become easier.<eos> They will.
This is the way the world ends.<eos> You going to fight me, Savannah?<eos> You were dead.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> So fitting that it comes down to us.<eos> The only male witch.<eos> The only female werewolf.<eos> You put up a good fight.<eos> But all good things must come to an end.<eos> They will.
Go to your room<eos> Hi<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I just came to see if you're ok<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You should leave<eos> Calm down<eos> Did you tell anyone what we saw today?<eos> I did, but they wouldn't believe me<eos> They won't
Father Pedro is crazy<eos> I just came here to check on you<eos> It's better if I just go, good night<eos> I think so too.<eos> Good night<eos> Jorge...<eos> What, woman?<eos> Can't you see I'm in communion with the Holy Ghost?<eos> Want to make us a little boy?<eos> With God's will!
Ronnie's?<eos> I need to be sure.<eos> Minus-20 last night.<eos> We're only looking for a body now.<eos> I should tell her.<eos> No.<eos> Let me deal with it.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will.
Midnight Sun Hotel.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Yeah, hello.<eos> I'm trying to get hold of DCI Morton.<eos> Do you know where he is?<eos> He's out.<eos> If you see him, could you tell him...<eos> Tell him to call his office.<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course I will.
And yet I am, and live..." [both] "Like vapors tossed..."<eos> "I long for scenes where man hath never trod.<eos> A place where woman never smiled or wept.<eos> There to abide with my Creator, God.<eos> And sleep as I in childhood sweetly slept.<eos> Untroubling and untroubled where I lie."<eos> [both] "The grass below, above, the vaulted sky."<eos> I wonder if he ever found it... his silent place with God.<eos> Oh, the poem tells me that he did.<eos> As you will one day.
We must leave this place now.<eos> Sam.<eos> Sam!<eos> If you die, this whole thing dies with you.<eos> The munitions in Concord...<eos> It's taken care of.<eos> We need to get you out of here.<eos> It's too late.<eos> We'll never make it.<eos> Yes, you will.
Look at this.<eos> Should have torn us apart.<eos> It didn't.<eos> Why are we here?<eos> For this.<eos> I see it.<eos> Noah, that kid... he said he didn't know if he can make it.<eos> That's how I feel.<eos> You're gonna make it.<eos> Both of us, we will.
Everything you people have been through, I don't know if you see that.<eos> We do.<eos> Bring your kids in for a checkup.<eos> I know I offered you one, but they really should come in.<eos> They were out there a while, right?<eos> Yeah. Thanks, Pete.<eos> Let's be friends, man.<eos> We kind of have to be, right?<eos> Yeah, we do.<eos> So we will.
I...<eos> I keep thinking about what you said.<eos> If i need to file a report, if that will help...<eos> You guys are -- you're doing all this.<eos> If i can help, i want to.<eos> Okay, pria, we -- we lost tonight.<eos> We lost our guy.<eos> We didn't find him.<eos> I know.<eos> But you will.
There is a time to tear down and a time to build up.<eos> Today is the time we mourn our dear sister Leah's passing and weep for the end of her earthly journey.<eos> And tomorrow will be the time to move on, to celebrate her righteous life and revel in Leah's heavenly salvation.<eos> How are you?<eos> Kai and Leah didn't speak for 20 years.<eos> We don't want that.<eos> Please, come home.<eos> We forgive you.<eos> I don't forgive you.<eos> And I never will.
This place will look like Pompano Beach.<eos> They're offering way above market.<eos> Okay, listen, I can't do that.<eos> But what if I pay in cash?<eos> - Cash?<eos> - Please, Sue...<eos> I need this.<eos> Please?<eos> If you come up with money by the end of the month, deal.<eos> I will.
May the Father judge him justly.<eos> Help me! Help me!<eos> This is Lord Petyr Baelish's establishment.<eos> Cocksucker!<eos> Boy fucker!<eos> You barbaric filth!<eos> There's a special place in the Seven Hells for your kind.<eos> Please, please, I'll pay!<eos> I'll pay all of you.<eos> Yes, you will!
You're very nice.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But do you know what I'm gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna go out there and find it. So, I'm not gonna marry you.<eos> No, I'm not gonna settle down.<eos> I'm gonna go and find myself one more cock, and do you know what you're gonna do?<eos> You will wait. - I'll do what?<eos> - You'll wait for me.<eos> I will not!
Don't go through my things. You're not touching them.<eos> You raped me.<eos> You happy now?<eos> I said, are you happy now?<eos> - I'm OK.<eos> - Dirty fuck.<eos> Don't get like that.<eos> Are you going to tell her?<eos> Veronica. Not a fucking word.<eos> - I won't.
Previously on Power...<eos> Mrs. Stern, I have good reason to believe that Simon's been skimming from the clubs, hiding assets.<eos> There's proof, I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
We're coming, we're coming.<eos> Here's the guns.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Shit!<eos> You had the ambassador kill the general of your country.<eos> You need to clear that up for me before we die.<eos> I follow orders, as you do.<eos> Well, in that case...<eos> I want to meet your boss.<eos> You will.
Things have been going real nice.<eos> Instant family!<eos> Good.<eos> Thanks, my man.<eos> Here.<eos> Ah, you two very good together.<eos> Maybe you two get married, yeah?<eos> Yeah, well, your invite's in the post.<eos> Which one of you will wear the dress?<eos> He will. She will.
It's 2:00 in the morning.<eos> I'm gonna finish this album.<eos> If I have to go line by line and note by note, I'm gonna do it.<eos> Juliette, come here, come here.<eos> You know that's not gonna sound right, okay?<eos> It takes all the emotion out of everything.<eos> What's goin' on with you? Huh?<eos> I'm having a baby, and I just feel like nothing in my life is my life and I lose my voice, too, I'm gonna...<eos> I can't. I can't lose my voice.<eos> You won't, you won't.
[Echoing stops] Deacon, hey, can you hear me?<eos> How'd I do?<eos> Um... there was a problem in Columbus.<eos> After they took the liver out of the donor, the surgical team found cancerous lesions on the donor's lungs.<eos> They didn't want to take the risk that the cancer had spread to...<eos> I didn't get the surgery.<eos> No.<eos> But we found one donor.<eos> We'll be able to find another one.<eos> - Will we?
The past is dead.<eos> I am a different woman now.<eos> The past is never dead.<eos> But we are finished with each other.<eos> From now on, we will be strangers.<eos> You are a stranger to yourself.<eos> The truth is staring you in the face and you can't even see it.<eos> What truth?<eos> Whatever I am... .. you love me.<eos> And you always will.
- Of course!<eos> George: Yes, thank you so much.<eos> But why couldn't you just tell us this last night?<eos> Well... because I have a favor to ask.<eos> Uh-huh. As both of you know, I've been stressing out about the reopening of Fancie's, particularly the menu.<eos> And I was hoping, as my closest friends, that you'd be willing to come over this evening for a sample meal.<eos> Hmm. I knew she wanted something.<eos> Yeah, of course she did.<eos> All you had to do was ask.<eos> But of course I will.
I-I know what's going on here, you're trying to push them together, so AnnaBeth will be happy, so that... that we could be together.<eos> (scoffs): What? !<eos> Don't be silly. This is for them.<eos> Mostly.<eos> (scoffs) Lemon, no...<eos> That's...<eos> It-it-it's not fair... to AnnaBeth or George.<eos> Not to mention, it's just plain craziness.<eos> It won't work.<eos> It will!
It's done.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Katori!<eos> It's over.<eos> They figured out that you got the heroin from me, but they're gonna give me a second chance.<eos> But you need to stop.<eos> No more gambling.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
To combat this, she receives induction therapy, stem cell therapy, at the World Health Organization Center on the Nakuru Road.<eos> My cars are known to my enemies.<eos> The road to Nakuru is long.<eos> No one would think to look for her in that pile of shit you call a bus.<eos> She's the most important thing in the world to me, Capheus.<eos> Everything I do is to build a life for her.<eos> Every breath I take, I breathe for her.<eos> Without her, my life has no meaning.<eos> And if something happens to her...<eos> neither will yours.
Perhaps you're right.<eos> Perhaps the risk to our work is too great.<eos> Just write the check so we can get back to work.<eos> I can see you're still upset about New York.<eos> I don't want to talk about New York.<eos> I do feel I-I owe you an apology.<eos> Your apology can wait.<eos> Virginia, I-I just didn't know how else to prove to you that Dan Logan is not what he seems.<eos> I do not want to talk about New York.<eos> Then we won't.
- Let's make us a baby.<eos> - Another?<eos> Yeah, you lost your fuckin' mind.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Boy, you crazy?<eos> We ain't had us a little girl.<eos> This is our answer to the pipe bombs-- politics, everything thrown at us during this project.<eos> I only hope people still wanna live in these houses.<eos> Oh, they do.<eos> And they will.
And so do you, missy.<eos> Come on.<eos> How did you know about the lie-detector test?<eos> - I heard you and mom. - Abby...<eos> I know.<eos> I shouldn't listen to other people's conversations.<eos> And repeating it, especially to strangers, that's worse.<eos> I just want everyone to know the truth, daddy.<eos> You didn't kill Tom.<eos> They will, monkey.
Hi. Hi.<eos> I-i'm here because...<eos> I think we should take a chance.<eos> Well, if your offer still stands.<eos> And, uh, i'd really love To go on a date with you, george tucker.<eos> Well, i would... (laughs)<eos> I would really love that, too.<eos> Good.<eos> Okay. (laughs) Uh, i'll see you then.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
Kenz, open your eyes, look around.<eos> Oh, what, what you think she's evil now, too?<eos> Is that it?<eos> You know, I'd really expect this from somebody else, but not from you.<eos> Guys!<eos> What if we lost her?<eos> Then we'll find her again.<eos> Kenz, we'll find her.<eos> We're not giving up.<eos> Lauren: And nobody ever will.
I say we use the Sky Girl to draw fire.<eos> - You got a problem?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You are the bringers of death.<eos> Help.<eos> Someone's alive down there.<eos> Jasper, where do you want this?<eos> Put it here, no weak spots.<eos> We need to make sure they don't get in.<eos> They won't.
Over here... No! This is where the proposal is happening.<eos> Okay. You want it, you come over here and get it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Carol... What's your middle name?<eos> Andrew.<eos> - Andrew?<eos> - Yeah. What is that, a family name?<eos> Andrew Pilbasian... will you marry me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!
Okay. You want it, you come over here and get it.<eos> Okay.<eos> Carol... What's your middle name?<eos> Andrew.<eos> - Andrew?<eos> - Yeah. What is that, a family name?<eos> Andrew Pilbasian... will you marry me?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes, I will!<eos> - Yes, I will!
We have to work with him.<eos> I don't have a choice.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> What happened wasn't your fault, Thea, because it wasn't your decision.<eos> If you want to make this right, what you do from now on...that is.<eos> I can't remember Sara's smile.<eos> It's weird, isn't it?<eos> I mean, I know Sara used to smile and--and laugh, but when I close my eyes and I try and picture it, all I see is the way that I found her.<eos> You know, sometimes, the only thing that keeps me going is the thought of one day finding her killer.<eos> We will.
If they spot us, we cannot let them get away.<eos> Surprise is our only advantage.<eos> I'd say they've spotted us.<eos> What's your count?<eos> 6 on the south side, probably another 4 on the east.<eos> I don't want to go out like Butch and Sundance, so what's the plan?<eos> Shoot straighter than they do.<eos> Cover me.<eos> If he gets to the fortress before we do, we're dead.<eos> He won't.
I want you to rest a few days in that hospital.<eos> Mr. President, I'm ready to go back to serving the American people.<eos> You said you were going to stay in India, and that's exactly what you're going to do.<eos> - This isn't a dialogue.<eos> - But, sir...<eos> God damn it, Walter!<eos> Of course.<eos> I apologize for jumping the gun.<eos> I will stay here as long as is required.<eos> - Damn right you will. - Yes, sir.
- Our entrance set off the silent alarms.<eos> The cops will be arriving in 2 minutes and 14 seconds.<eos> - Bring them.<eos> - That's not for the cops, as we discussed.<eos> He'll be here.<eos> - You do hear that, right?<eos> - He's not coming.<eos> We're leaving.<eos> - This better make sense real fast, buddy.<eos> - It will.
Right.<eos> That's all you got to do now-- read the Bible.<eos> It's a good book.<eos> You should, too.<eos> You know you was conceived in the back of a truck between a church and a graveyard?<eos> I'd tell you to go kill yourself, but I know you don't have the balls.<eos> If you're here, then you're desperate, so come back with some money.<eos> I'm not coming back.<eos> Oh, yes you are.<eos> Maybe not on purpose, but you will.
I hate you!<eos> I hate being your brother!<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You got confused.<eos> And...<eos> I still love you.<eos> I still love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will, bro.
Oh my God, is he ok?<eos> He's stable now.<eos> What can I do?<eos> Should I come over?<eos> No.<eos> Stay where you are.<eos> Don't leave.<eos> I might send someone over to get some clothes for him.<eos> Ok.<eos> I will.
You did this.<eos> You're not alone!<eos> You liar!<eos> Now, you're gonna learn how I handle pests.<eos> Good to see you again, Charlotte.<eos> What the hell are you doing here?<eos> We had an agreement.<eos> Come back to the church with me.<eos> That's where you belong till that baby's born. No.<eos> I won't.
Yes! I love you.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Hey, Cyndee, we're friends no matter what, right?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Okay. Well, maybe I'm spoiled because things are going so well with Charles, but I think you can do better than Brandon.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> Brandon's perfect.<eos> He takes care of me... like you used to.<eos> Okay, I just want you to be happy, so...<eos> Cyndee Sandy Pokorny, will you...
- Thank you, Hal.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Oh, this is my father, Majid.<eos> He's in academics.<eos> Actually I work for the Center for Socialist Thought now.<eos> I'm not even gonna pretend to know what that means, but good for you. [Laughs]<eos> Delia, you know what? I got to tell you something.<eos> I represent a few people who could use a shark like you to help un-marry them.<eos> Well, have them call me, by all means.<eos> (Hal) Absolutely, I will.
I'm sorry for messing with your stuff and giving you a mustache and shooting you in the butt.<eos> Well, it takes a good man to admit he did something wrong.<eos> And I would have laughed at the butt thing if it was somebody else's butt.<eos> Okay, Deion.<eos> Time to do homework.<eos> You know, in spite of your act, I think you have a place in your heart for children.<eos> Here is your paycheck.<eos> With a little something extra, as promised.<eos> I don't understand why you wanted Zoila to think you were broke.<eos> You will.
Karen, please, just come in.<eos> Like I said, I've given this a lot of thought, and I just don't feel comfortable with it now.<eos> Why now?<eos> W-what's changed?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We'll have the French fries, the jumbo shrimp cocktail, and... ?<eos> Um, do they have Mac and cheese?<eos> Well, the Mac and cheese is truffle Mac and cheese, buddy.<eos> You might not like it.<eos> I will.
Well, Alec will insist.<eos> He doesn't know that I'm sick.<eos> What the hell's going on?<eos> He's receiving his physician of the year award from the American Society of Cardiology, and there is a black-tie gala tomorrow night.<eos> While he'd never admit it, this award means the world to him.<eos> Vivian... you know him.<eos> If I tell him now, he'll... Blow off the award and jump into savior mode.<eos> I'd never forgive myself.<eos> He won't forgive you for not telling him.<eos> I will. I will.
You changed your mind.<eos> The airline changed my gate.<eos> My flight's boarding now.<eos> How did you get past security?<eos> I bought a $69 ticket to Atlantic City.<eos> Paige, you don't have to go.<eos> They arrested Alison for killing Mona.<eos> She's in jail.<eos> She won't stay there.<eos> Yes, she will.
- I mean, it's like you got the child lock going.<eos> - I can't get out.<eos> - You poor thing.<eos> I don't know where to go.<eos> I don't wanna go nowhere.<eos> That's the important thing.<eos> I don't even wanna go nowhere.<eos> Gwen, we got a code 3 for chest pain.<eos> But, yeah, we'll finish this later.<eos> - Oh, yes, we will.
- [Sighs]<eos> - Shh.<eos> I promise you, Wes.<eos> I got you.<eos> ♪ ... my own way, own way ♪<eos> [Lid closes]<eos> Rebecca... ?<eos> If we don't find her?<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
They're out there fighting, dying right now to take back the ship.<eos> You're just gonna blow them to kingdom come?<eos> - Fury's orders are...<eos> - Well, Fury's dead!<eos> He's not seeing what we're seeing.<eos> He's right, Bobbi.<eos> We already took the top deck.<eos> Director Fury left orders, and we're gonna follow them.<eos> Hydra will not get this ship and its cargo.<eos> They won't.
And I realized her words have come true.<eos> I am not a monster.<eos> I am an angel.<eos> I'm finally what I'm meant to be.<eos> I'm happy to hear you say that.<eos> Angels are guardians, Jiaying, but they're also heralds, sent to reveal the truth.<eos> And that is my purpose.<eos> I'm here to show the Inhumans exactly what you are.<eos> Even in the darkness, they will see the truth.<eos> No. They won't.
Clear.<eos> Maggie, come take over.<eos> Walk me through how you do this.<eos> I am so, so sorry.<eos> You were actually asleep in there, standing up, with your eyes open.<eos> I haven't been sleeping.<eos> It's this shift and studying for boards and...<eos> - It can't happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
Your DNA was found amongst the remains at the terrace.<eos> Why fake your own death?<eos> In the face of universal loathing, who wouldn't want to be Johnny Royalle?<eos> In the face of universal loathing, why resurrect him?<eos> This city is my home.<eos> I wanted to come home.<eos> I wanted to make something here.<eos> A house of sorts.<eos> A safe place.<eos> A celebration, if you will.
I want to see everybody who was supposed to be at that meeting last night, and the attendance sheet, so I can see who was not.<eos> You think it was a panther?<eos> -Your brother did.<eos> -Why?<eos> Well, he knew there was an informant, high up, right next to you.<eos> I think he was waiting at your house to tell you.<eos> You want to put names with those black faces, you're gonna have to work harder than that.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me.<eos> I don't.<eos> I never will.
I don't know. Maybe I'm wrong. I think people need to hear your voice to hear his.<eos> Can we set up a time to meet?<eos> Um... I'll think about it.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> Seth, this is good, but downplay expectations even more. There's no telling what we'll walk away with. - Yes, sir.<eos> - We shouldn't inform the press until after you land, for security purposes.<eos> Donald...<eos> - If anything should happen to me--<eos> - I'm prepared.<eos> - But nothing will.
I need to know everything.<eos> How did they get the virus, the witness...<eos> Hey! Hey, I need a doctor in here!<eos> Help!<eos> Dr. Adler... start preparations.<eos> We have the core.<eos> Careful.<eos> Your father... his sacrifice was not for nothing.<eos> Promise me this'll work.<eos> It will.
Spearhead.<eos> She's got a kid... my kid.<eos> Jesus, man, I'm sorry.<eos> You're... you're sorry?<eos> That's nice.<eos> This ain't working.<eos> It's not working.<eos> You got to stop.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
We got you a present as a class.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I knew she'd cry.<eos> I won't cry.<eos> Even though you're kind of a nerd who thinks it's okay to wear "sensible shoes""<eos> the truth is, we really think you're a great teacher.<eos> So, here.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I won't.
I offered you a terrific position.<eos> Just think of all the fabulous scenes you will write.<eos> Think of all the lives you'll touch.<eos> But writing is her dream.<eos> Dreams don't pay the bills.<eos> Geez.<eos> At least her see if she likes it.<eos> She already knows she likes teaching.<eos> Trust me, she will like this much, much more.<eos> No, she won't, you silly actor.
It came out wrong,<eos> - but you meant what you said, right? - No.<eos> I was lashing out because I... felt guilty, like you said.<eos> Like I was...<eos> letting you down.<eos> Look, I-I understand that you're mad, and you have every right to be.<eos> I'm not mad, Rafael.<eos> I'm scared.<eos> When this baby comes, I'm scared it's gonna all be on me, all the child care.<eos> No, it won't.
God, he's such a pest.<eos> _<eos> (sighs) And he wants to talk.<eos> Again.<eos> We're talking with you here again because it looks like your dad is Sin Rostro and has been running a plastic surgery ring for criminals inside your hotel.<eos> And it's really hard for me to believe that you knew nothing about it.<eos> You know, I liked it better when you were suspended.<eos> Look, if your father needs money or a place to hide, he might contact you.<eos> And if that happens, we need to know.<eos> And you will.
like everyone else just knows what they're talking about?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Once you've lived in New York, there's just something about it.<eos> Feels like the one and only.<eos> Plus it's the best place to wipe your slate clean and start over.<eos> I should check it out then.<eos> You could come stay with us.<eos> We have a terrible futon and a terrible coffeemaker.<eos> You should really come to New York.<eos> Maybe I will.
It's Japanese.<eos> Tokyo.<eos> White Dragon.<eos> Wexler told me about this place.<eos> He knew about the 12 Monkeys.<eos> They're connected to this place somehow.<eos> 1987... that's the date<eos> Leland Goines said he met me before.<eos> But that hasn't happened for you yet.<eos> No, but it will.
- So?<eos> So I don't understand.<eos> - Understand what?<eos> - Why you're a girl.<eos> Or...<eos> Stop it!<eos> Look, Greylock was keeping me hidden and the easiest way was for mw to be a boy.<eos> But why?<eos> If I tell you, make a promise that you keep my secret.<eos> I will.
There are exceptions to the rule...<eos> However, the themes of trust and tolerance still resonate.<eos> It's not what it looks like.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it looks like you're moving a body.<eos> And your daughter's worried it's her mom.<eos> I told Brooke, Monica is fine.<eos> She's at Pleasant Roads Rehab in Phoenix.<eos> - Give her a call.<eos> - I will.
But why did you kill my friends?<eos> They had nothing to do with this!<eos> To watch you suffer, Emma.<eos> Although they did help a lot.<eos> After all, what did your BFFs do?<eos> They filmed your first time.<eos> I mean, the day that your video accidentally went viral and I was right there to see it happen?<eos> Priceless.<eos> They're gonna figure out who did this.<eos> No, they won't.
You talking about money?<eos> Yes, to a certain degree.<eos> Well, why didn't you say that?<eos> Come on in.<eos> Come on!<eos> It's okay, come on!<eos> It's just their perception, Lizzie.<eos> Perception based on misunderstanding.<eos> They don't want to understand.<eos> They will.
Husband?<eos> Her former employer.<eos> Oh, a procurer, in our house?<eos> - Emma, stop.<eos> - What does he want?<eos> Well, why don't I go find out and then I will send him on his way.<eos> Do you want to go with Adele?<eos> No.<eos> No, I want this madness to end.<eos> So it will.
Everything will be all right, Iris.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Sister Julienne.<eos> You delivered my Lorna.<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> And I've often remembered her in my prayers.<eos> I never thought I'd have another child.<eos> I just...<eos> I kept loving her.<eos> And you always will.
Let's light this candle.<eos> All right, why do I smell sandalwood?<eos> Go away.<eos> You're painting the easel.<eos> - It looks good, right?<eos> - The Mason Hotel wants a painting.<eos> They won't accept an easel.<eos> Or... will they?<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
Well, tell him that Lobos is coming into town, all right?<eos> Maybe that'll change his mind.<eos> There she is.<eos> For you.<eos> - Nice place. - Thanks.<eos> I can see why Simon wanted to take it from you.<eos> Your information checked out.<eos> With proof I can destroy him in this divorce.<eos> - You said you had documentation?<eos> - I will.
The case is closed.<eos> It's done.<eos> But he didn't do it.<eos> Why would he sign?<eos> Maybe because he's been falsely imprisoned for 35 years and he just wants to get the hell out?<eos> But it wasn't about that for Eddie.<eos> He knew he was innocent.<eos> It was about finding the truth.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe he lost hope that he ever would.<eos> Well, now he won't.
You don't think he...<eos> I wouldn't put anything past Malcolm.<eos> That's why this has to end.<eos> I'm meeting him here tonight.<eos> What's your plan?<eos> I told him that I have his daughter.<eos> What?<eos> You mean alive?<eos> What happens when he finds out she's not?<eos> He won't.
You didn't put up much of a fight.<eos> - When are you going to learn to take responsibility for your own actions?<eos> Maybe when you do, mom.<eos> I was 20 years old.<eos> Well, I was 17 when my father summoned me back to Russia to tell me that he was a KGB general and it was time for me to do my patriotic duty, which I did.<eos> And still, I accept that as a choice.<eos> One that I have carried the burden of every day since I made it.<eos> We're gonna keep running for the rest of our lives.<eos> - Until they find us.<eos> - They won't.
- Why will you not do my bidding?<eos> You are my wife.<eos> Are you not satisfied with looking upon me through the keyhole?<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> All I wish for, sir, is to be happy and in love and with my husband.<eos> All I wish for, madam, is that you do my bidding.<eos> You betray my love for you by asking...<eos> It is not betrayal... it is simply my wish.<eos> You should wish to please me.<eos> I won't.

Mud run's in 10 minutes.<eos> What's that all about?<eos> The dorm triathlon.<eos> The final event is a mud run.<eos> Oh, that's cool.<eos> I did that once in my summer camp.<eos> Are you sure about this?<eos> I never said I was great at it.<eos> If we lose, everyone will hate me.<eos> No, they won't.
It's not fair.<eos> Dad, there's lots of people in my position, and some of them are even sicker than I am.<eos> Like Keith.<eos> And they're ahead of me on the waiting list.<eos> That's just how it is.<eos> How it is does not make it right!<eos> I'm close, though.<eos> Dr. Urman said a call could come at any time.<eos> You can't give up hope.<eos> I won't.
What is it?<eos> I'm gonna talk to someone about it.<eos> A doctor someone.<eos> Maybe see about some medication.<eos> It's always been just me, you know?<eos> Now it's not anymore.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You know, after I cleaned the fries off your face and put you to bed, you said something to me that was pretty dark.<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> Okay, I won't.
And you got him right.<eos> You tell Winona I said hey.<eos> I still don't know what she sees in you.<eos> - It'd be weird if you did.<eos> - Hold up!<eos> - Got the Seattle chief on the line.<eos> - Well, where's Rachel?<eos> She'll be here in two.<eos> - Gonna miss you, Raylan.<eos> - No, you won't.
Ooh, the true artist refuses to become a sellout.<eos> Integrity.<eos> I mean, God forbid you make a little money off your talent.<eos> And have you been making money off your talent recently?<eos> Not gonna lie, it's been slow.<eos> I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> Don't be.<eos> When it rains, it pours.<eos> So I'm just hoping a storm is coming soon.<eos> It will.
How does a merger that gives Maya the ability to produce her electric car for the masses help me?<eos> Well, it doesn't.<eos> Unless, of course, producing an electric car for the masses isn't a part of Ellis's vision for the future.<eos> You saying it's not?<eos> Ford or Ferrari-- who do you think Ellis wants to be?<eos> With this merger, Maya's dream of mass production is effectively neutralized.<eos> Without it, however,<eos> Maya is free to take her highly sought-after technology anywhere.<eos> And it will get made.<eos> Yes, it will.
In the meantime, we'll talk to Keith Bradshaw.<eos> Told you I'd be back.<eos> What do you want, a medal?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> I just want to talk.<eos> What about?<eos> Have you thought any about what we discussed last time?<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
And I wished for bad things to happen to him.<eos> Now it just seems so stupid.<eos> It's okay. It's okay, Ferg.<eos> It's okay.<eos> 196.<eos> Okay, that's it.<eos> - Out, Walt.<eos> - What?<eos> Look, I said you could sit there as long as you kept your mouth shut.<eos> - Sorry. I will.
Okay. All right.<eos> Let's do a search within a five-mile radius of where Lexi's body was found.<eos> We're looking for somebody who recently had their concrete driveway sealed.<eos> Hi. I heard you got something.<eos> Yeah. Lexi's body was found right here.<eos> Two miles away, on Harvard Drive, this house had their driveway sealed on Wednesday.<eos> Now, we know that when Lexi ran she didn't get very far, so Clark's got to be holding Cara somewhere nearby.<eos> I should get out there.<eos> Wait for backup.<eos> I will.
Thank you.<eos> My presentation is about marriage law.<eos> This is me, Garrett.<eos> I'm in your class.<eos> This is Stacy.<eos> She is in our class as well.<eos> This is what I want.<eos> Oh, Garrett.<eos> Stacy, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, yes, Garrett, yes, I will!
Previously on "The Strain"...<eos> You may have resigned from Stoneheart, but you haven't resigned from Eldritch Palmer.<eos> You can break this chain of misguided loyalty once and for all.<eos> - I'm not gonna change my mind.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Do you understand me?<eos> Okay, let's get him, uh, prepped and tubed, please.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Now needles.<eos> This day.<eos> Yeah, you and me both.<eos> I'm missing lunch.<eos> Come on, Jackson.<eos> Don't tell me you haven't chaperoned a patient before.<eos> Okay. Then I won't.
You weren't here.<eos> What if Norma had seen you?<eos> Look, what if she had, okay?<eos> I'm a human being.<eos> Is that a crime?<eos> She's the one who won't talk to me.<eos> She's the one being irrational.<eos> I don't think it's irrational to not want to talk to the guy who raped her.<eos> Look, you don't understand, Dylan.<eos> You never will!
What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You made a face.<eos> No, it feels good.<eos> You sure? You can say.<eos> No, it feels great.<eos> Just say.<eos> You sure you don't want to stop? No, I want you to come.<eos> I want you to come too.<eos> I will.
We end up together.<eos> It's a happy ending.<eos> Wasn't that the end that Harry wants you to change?<eos> Look, I'm the asshole in the book.<eos> I destroy everyone I care about.<eos> I-I ruin my life.<eos> The story's not even about you.<eos> It's about me.<eos> Before you judge, will you please just read the whole book?<eos> No, I won't.
Kiera?<eos> Kiera cameron, the one that... Never mind.<eos> Yeah, you've made mistakes, but your instincts are right.<eos> Time travel, the power to change things?<eos> It's not an experiment.<eos> It's the answer.<eos> Do it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
It doesn't mean anything.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Are we playing too rough for you?<eos> I think we should get out of here... and go find some real trouble.<eos> Hey.<eos> Is that the page that August took out of the storybook?<eos> Did you find anything?<eos> I think this door somehow Has something to do with the author.<eos> I just have to figure out where it is.<eos> You will.
Al "The Ape" Neely?<eos> Yeah, we played together at Nebraska.<eos> He, uh-- he married that actress, Isabella Ricci?<eos> Well, anyway, she's been twisting his arm, trying to get him to go see somebody about their bedroom problems.<eos> They'd heard of you and, uh... about flipped when I told them we were neighbors.<eos> They wanted me to put in a good word, you know?<eos> Maybe-- maybe you'd see them.<eos> You don't have to put in a good word.<eos> Just have them call the office.<eos> All right, I will.
No, but I had unis show his picture around Shana's building.<eos> The same day he left that voice-mail, neighbors saw him banging on her door, yelling obscenities.<eos> He promised he'd be back.<eos> So I was a little... aggressive when Ms. Baker didn't let my son into that school, but that doesn't mean I killed her.<eos> "Bitch, I know where you live, and you will never see me coming."<eos> That sounds like a death threat to me.<eos> I was being dramatic.<eos> How were you being when you shot her?<eos> Look, you don't understand.<eos> And neither will a jury.
Danno says the only thing he hates more than swimming is running.<eos> Don't worry about Danno.<eos> You know, it scares me to think what that guy's gonna be like when he actually is a grumpy old man.<eos> That looks just like your car, Uncle Steve.<eos> Because it is my car.<eos> Listen to me, you don't... you don't move from this spot.<eos> Okay? You don't talk to anybody...<eos> Okay, I won't.<eos> Don't move, all right?<eos> I won't, I won't.
I hope you don't mind.<eos> I thought your crew might like something to work by.<eos> Aye.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> I'm afraid I've got something to show you.<eos> I know what that is.<eos> Why do you have that?<eos> - Please don't use it!<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> I won't.

I'm not going to be able to wait.<eos> Something must have happened.<eos> Can we reschedule?<eos> I'm afraid not.<eos> Hey, I'm sorry.<eos> I missed the bus on the way over here and I forgot my phone at home. I...<eos> I had to run half the way over here.<eos> Thanks for driving us home.<eos> Oh, it's fine, I'm sorry your moms couldn't stay to celebrate.<eos> - We will tonight.
You, Abbie and Crane.<eos> All the time I have known you, you have used me.<eos> You didn't even come visit me in Tarrytown.<eos> You didn't even bring by my daughter.<eos> So stop pretending you care about my family.<eos> And tell me what I want to know, Jenny.<eos> Or I will tear you apart!<eos> They're afraid of you, Frank!<eos> They don't want to be with you!<eos> They will.
Maybe not now, but if we stay together--<eos> If?<eos> What are you-- What are you saying?<eos> I'm saying I want what's best for you.<eos> You're approaching a very exciting time in your life. You're going to be meeting new people.<eos> You're going to be discovering yourself.<eos> Right. I can do all of that and still be with you.<eos> But if you take this time for yourself... there will be no regrets.<eos> Promise me you'll at least think about it.<eos> Yeah, I will.
– Yes, she does.<eos> You love me.<eos> That's why I grew up.<eos> Sometimes, she wouldn't allow me to go out.<eos> Really?<eos> – Didn't your father say anything?<eos> – He did.<eos> He was nicer?<eos> Maybe he'll come back too.<eos> – He won't.
- Our leader.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> How can they do that?<eos> That BS about aiding a terror cell.<eos> There's no depth Shepherd and his cronies won't sink to.<eos> He just wants to get your attention. - He got it.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> I don't know, but I can't sit in Sherwood Forest hoping they live up to the ideals of the Constitution.<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.

Let me go back!<eos> - I want to go...<eos> - It's too late, lady.<eos> You've made your choice.<eos> Mom, wake up.<eos> Please wake up.<eos> She's gone, honey.<eos> No. No!<eos> - We have to go now.<eos> - No, I won't.
When I tried installing the anti-virus, it triggered an emergency firewall.<eos> John must have put it in there to protect him.<eos> - We did it?<eos> - Yeah, we did it.<eos> - Well, we all did. - I think I need to go to the hospital.<eos> Come on, let's go.<eos> Well... I guess I'm not a hybrid. Just an ass.<eos> You just wanted the choice.<eos> You think the world is ever going to know what really happened?<eos> This time, they will.

No, but I do recall the 4 months where he faked his own death.<eos> Funny thing about that, he actually didn't fake it.<eos> We went to this island off the coast of Canada in search of this cure for vampirism, - and Jeremy...<eos> - Damon! Is this some sort of joke to you?<eos> Look. Jeremy has had a rough time here, I know, but that's part of the reason<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but I can't let that happen.<eos> So can we try this my way now?<eos> We already compelled him into art school.<eos> Sorry that I wanted my little brother to actually get a degree.<eos> He will.
You know, I thought that the splinters in this tissue were bone but they're too porous.<eos> Yeah, no, that seems like wood.<eos> This tissue is muscle and cartilage from his esophagus and throat. It's fibromuscular tubing.<eos> So, after a drawn-out fight, the killer jammed something wood in the victim's neck and then ripped out pieces of his throat?<eos> Gruesome, but we found cause of death.<eos> Now we have to look at all the wood back here to see if we can find the piece he used to kill Dover.<eos> You don't have to go back to the game, Booth.<eos> Cam and the others found evidence at the scene.<eos> But we got no answers.<eos> Yet, but we will.
He has a cell phone the marshals don't know about.<eos> We just want to speak with him, Melissa.<eos> Just to explain the situation.<eos> Whether he testifies or not is totally up to him.<eos> Please don't ask me to do this.<eos> I know we're putting you in a very difficult position.<eos> But the guy that we are after killed two little girls.<eos> We really need your grandfather's help.<eos> Just... don't tell him where you got the number.<eos> We won't.
I mean, didn't you say that one of the main reasons why the beast of 1854 was able to expose<eos> Alistair and get him killed was because Rebecca tried too hard to protect him?<eos> Yeah, somebody's got to break that chain.<eos> Great.<eos> Congratulations, now can we time warp back to today?<eos> What am I supposed to do?<eos> Just stick with the plan, it's already in motion, right?<eos> Get the gem, assemble SWAT, and we'll capture Liam the moment he comes out of DHS.<eos> This will blow up in our faces if Helen Ellingsworth can still protect Liam.<eos> She won't.
Look, you have to do what's best for the office, not some individual person.<eos> I have to stand by them.<eos> Will you turn this off?<eos> I-I tried before.<eos> You wouldn't let me.<eos> Well, I'm gonna let you now.<eos> Come here.<eos> Just sleep, okay?<eos> You'll know what to do in the morning.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Get what?<eos> The video, obviously.<eos> I thought he was better.<eos> He is... but you never know about tomorrow.<eos> I'd like to keep it handy, just in case.<eos> I'll let you know once I make a copy.<eos> Don't call this number.<eos> Call my cell.<eos> Please don't forget.<eos> I won't.
You got it? - Got it.<eos> - Ahem!<eos> Lieutenant Waters!<eos> This is a surprise.<eos> Oh, I just paid Rosetta and the child a visit.<eos> I, uh...<eos> I wanted to thank you for helping her.<eos> Rosetta is a fine girl.<eos> She and the baby will thrive with a few shillings from you, of course.<eos> Yes, she will.
If we want anything to stick, we have to catch her red-handed.<eos> Do you have a plan?<eos> It'll be fish in a barrel.<eos> Two to three dozen beautiful women roaming the room waiting to be asked on a date.<eos> You will slip in.<eos> Peruse the inventory, make your pick.<eos> As soon as Charlotte swoops in to seal the deal, we swoop in.<eos> Billy Soto looking fly.<eos> Shame you don't get to see me in action working my magic.<eos> Oh, but we will.
I didn't know anything about his murder.<eos> Do you even believe yourself?<eos> You work in intelligence.<eos> How can you not know?<eos> No...<eos> The second it happened, I knew it.<eos> But I didn't know they were gonna do it, I had no idea.<eos> You're a trained liar.<eos> How will I ever know if you're telling the truth?<eos> You won't.
That's coarse.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Just turn the knob.<eos> Don't bark at me.<eos> I'm not!<eos> I-I'm sorry.<eos> I'm just frustrated I can't do anything with this stupid hand.<eos> How do you think I feel?<eos> I'm here trying to play scientist, when I really should be trying to make captain.<eos> And you will.
Get the suspect's photo out to every unit, stat.<eos> She's armed and dangerous.<eos> Does Cat know?<eos> No. I dropped her and Heather off at the apartment like we planned.<eos> She knows I'm staying at JT's, so she's got no idea.<eos> Okay. JT: It's not gonna be easy to keep this from her.<eos> And frankly, I'm not even sure we should.<eos> If we tell her that Julianna escaped, she'll call off the wedding.<eos> Well, Tess is right.<eos> She will.
And as I said that out loud, I realized that I must have been in the ladies' room.<eos> I can't see, Max.<eos> Max, I've got some exciting news!<eos> Eh, I vowed I'd never get excited about anything again after that last Indiana Jones.<eos> I found us two discount heat lamps on Sherry's list.<eos> It's like Craigslist, but without the high probability of being murdered by a deranged medical student.<eos> And about those lamps?<eos> We can't worry about our outdoor business.<eos> We barely have an indoor business.<eos> And we never will, with that attitude.
I don't want to do this, but I have to.<eos> Nobody can connect me to Mary but you.<eos> ME won't buy it.<eos> Victimology's all wrong.<eos> The Deer Hunter killed men.<eos> Is that what you call them?<eos> Men? This wasn't supposed to happen this way.<eos> I didn't want to hurt Mary or anybody else, anybody but them!<eos> I understand.<eos> Maybe a jury will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Because I'm a traitor now.<eos> A pariah.<eos> One more moment, please.<eos> One more moment... is that all we have?<eos> The wagon is ready to take her away.<eos> Nobles are waiting.<eos> Promise me you'll take care.<eos> Promise me, Greer, for it is a dangerous world.<eos> I will.
Miss you already, Bose.<eos> You do?<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> I mean, I figure we're not gonna get teamed up as much now that we got the Wisconsin import.<eos> Mmm. Too bad.<eos> We're good together.<eos> We are.<eos> And I'll miss you, too.<eos> I mean, working together.<eos> I will.
Didn't the FBI seize her parents' house?<eos> Thus the party.<eos> That sounds like a great idea.<eos> I think I'll pass.<eos> Come on, is this about Max?<eos> What about him?<eos> 'Cause he's staying over there and you don't want to see him.<eos> Well, he's also working with Crash, another person I don't want to see.<eos> Well, in any case, everyone's gonna be there if you change your mind.<eos> Maybe I will.
Haven't seen her in a week.<eos> Maybe she got arrested.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Make some calls, get her here.<eos> Yo, I don't even know who she with.<eos> [Carisi] Well, find out.<eos> And then tell the pimp that you got a special request.<eos> You got a whale here who's willing to pay top dollar for snow bunnies.<eos> I'll do what I can.<eos> Yeah, you will.
No. No, you can't.<eos> You can't put him in that position.<eos> Did you ever regret it?<eos> One time.<eos> In '88, when you apprehended that bank robber all on your own before backup ever arrived.<eos> That was a clear case for the Medal for Valor.<eos> Eh. Now, every time you put on the uniform and I see a space where a medal should be, or a commendation bar, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I have regrets.<eos> I don't have regrets, Pop.<eos> Neither will Danny.
A bit of ancient wisdom for you to mull on your journey.<eos> Ah, here we go.<eos> You're late.<eos> Shall we do this or not?<eos> I'm curious why you requested this parley.<eos> I would think it would be obvious.<eos> Typically each side must prove that the other has something to lose by continuing the conflict.<eos> Allowing two British parties to bloody each other further wouldn't be good for either of us.<eos> I'm sorry, have you seen any blood?<eos> Nor will you.
Bristol.<eos> - So Bristol is your dream?<eos> - No, I didn't say that.<eos> Well, you literally just said that to me, Rae.<eos> No, well, I didn't think it was,<eos> - but now I've lied to everyone and it's all a big mess. - OK.<eos> I just don't know what to do.<eos> Look, I get your dilemma, I do.<eos> - Don't tell anyone about this!<eos> - No, I won't.
So, who found the body?<eos> Homeless guy, Ed Turner.<eos> Said he found her in this recycling bin when he was scavenging for bottles.<eos> We get Turner's statement?<eos> No, we haven't found him yet.<eos> He called 911 from a nearby payphone, but when we got here, he was already gone.<eos> Obviously, she's not carrying I.D.<eos> So, uh...<eos> I'm guessing we don't know who she is?<eos> Hopefully we will in a minute.
I mean, I have reason to believe that someone murdered him.<eos> If somebody killed Branch, got to be Nighthorse.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> Well, he's been trying to get at me in all sorts of ways.<eos> He planted those old Indian bones on my golf course to try and stall my development.<eos> But I don't go down easy.<eos> When he saw he couldn't get at me, he... went after the thing I loved.<eos> If someone went after my daughter, I... I don't know what I'd do.<eos> - We got to get him. - I will.<eos> I will.
RICK: Summer, Morty, take off your collars.<eos> What?<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Good question.<eos> I suppose the answer is I'm not certain.<eos> Oh, no, what are you doing?<eos> - I have no idea.<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> Stop it!<eos> [echoing] Maybe I will, maybe I won't.
I grew, and I came here to tell you in person that I won't publish the book.<eos> Good.<eos> That's the right decision.<eos> If you give me $3 million.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> No, not you. I want $3 million from whoever hired you.<eos> I assume it's one of the guys in my book, and he's got to have money.<eos> I mean, Olivia Pope don't come cheap, right?<eos> Nobody's paying you $3 million.<eos> One of the publishers will.
I'll get someone else.<eos> I said I would do it.<eos> Alex's uncle cannot possibly be considered an impartial judge.<eos> I'm the gym teacher.<eos> Who else has the training to oversee this?<eos> Anyone with a stopwatch?<eos> Okay, you know what?<eos> No need to humiliate me.<eos> May the best child win.<eos> - Oh, she will. - Ah.
You look back there, and I'll check these shelves.<eos> Hmm. Anything up there?<eos> Not a thing, buddy.<eos> I feel like I saw some sort of a...<eos> Are they aware...?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Maybe we can use this broom handle to pry it loose.<eos> No, that won't work.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Yes, it will.
I took a break.<eos> So you got fired?<eos> Dude, just tell me.<eos> Will you relax and have a beer?<eos> Can't, man, I'm working.<eos> That's right.<eos> Get over here.<eos> It's good to see you.<eos> Stop by the district later.<eos> I will, I will.
Give it here.<eos> I didn't kill Sierra.<eos> Her name was Felicia.<eos> She slipped.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> Someone slipping in the shower is an accident.<eos> Felicia was thrown out a 20-story window.<eos> She fought back tough, didn't she?<eos> If you say so.<eos> Actually, the medical examiner will.
Thank you.<eos> You tracked him for a long time.<eos> Well, it's why I became a police officer.<eos> To find him.<eos> He was my, ah... last and best lead.<eos> All the other evidence had closed?<eos> My sister was abducted when I was 12 years old, Inspector.<eos> The trail has gone very, very cold.<eos> You never stopped looking for her.<eos> I never will.
You seem on edge lately.<eos> Just got a lot on at work.<eos> More details from the court in The Hague...<eos> In his ongoing trial at the International Criminal Court today, lawyers for General Wombosi seemed caught off guard by the...<eos> Is this yours?<eos> Yeah. Been looking for that.<eos> Since when do you read The Hague Guardian?<eos> You know me, I like to stay well informed.<eos> Then don't forget the doctors appointment tomorrow.<eos> - I won't.
It's not the ballet or whatever.<eos> Though... though it is a kind of a dance.<eos> There's grace, a rhythm...<eos> An elegance. Oh.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> I got shushed, but the purple prose is fine.<eos> Shh!<eos> Okay.<eos> She is gonna pull it off, though, right?<eos> Yes. Yeah, she will.
And that'll give me enough time to cancel my Reader's Digest, my Country Living.<eos> Then we'll be ready to go.<eos> "We"?<eos> You don't have to do this alone.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> I thought you were reborn.<eos> Donovan was my one true love.<eos> I thought when he brought me back from the brink of death, it was because he loved me.<eos> He doesn't love me.<eos> He never will.
I would love to have you as my chef again.<eos> - I think I heard "girlfriend."<eos> - Did you hear that?<eos> I was hoping you said chef loud enough so all you heard was "chef-friend."<eos> Listen, Josh, what we have between us is undeniable.<eos> But it's also crazy and messy and confusing...<eos> - Go on a date with me.<eos> - What?<eos> Gabi, you and I have been through so much, but the one thing we've never done is go on a simple date.<eos> So... will you?
Give me some slack.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> When we regain control, Paige, you steer us to the side of the road.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be right back.<eos> Or not.<eos> A minute, 32 until impact.<eos> What took you so long?<eos> Oh! Uh, please tell me you did not just drop the screwdriver.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Joe!<eos> Joe!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Get off me!<eos> I have to find him!<eos> You are the past.<eos> Dawn is the future now.<eos> Stop fighting, son!<eos> Give up!<eos> We won't.
Did we just become best friends?<eos> Hey, look who decided to show.<eos> You're back? 100%?<eos> How did that happen?<eos> Um, it was Hannah. She managed to get the location of the remainder of my Grace out of Metatron.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I told you we were due for a win.<eos> Good to have you back, pal.<eos> I don't trust you.<eos> I never will.
That was Tom's decision.<eos> Right now, that judge may think you're guilty, and it's not easy to let a cold-blooded killer go free, even in the name of national security.<eos> But a cold-blooded killer you are not.<eos> If we can prove Tom is responsible, it might just tip the scales.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> I never should have put him there.<eos> He'll go to prison for the rest of his life because of me.<eos> One step at a time, Lizzy.<eos> He's not gonna come back.<eos> He will.
Haven't you?<eos> No.<eos> What about your sister?<eos> I didn't go to her funeral.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> - But you're going Hans' tomorrow?<eos> - Will you come with me?<eos> - Do you want me to?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Then I will.
I need to know if you want me to undo it.<eos> What?<eos> I know you and Donna aren't me and Jeff, but you are as close as two people can be without being that.<eos> Shit, Harvey, Scottie leaving didn't throw you off your game this much.<eos> I appreciate the offer.<eos> But as long as Donna wants to work for Louis,<eos> I am not gonna force her to work for me.<eos> Okay.<eos> ♪ ♪ Harvey, have you thought about what's going to happen if she doesn't come back?<eos> She will.
But not your pot.<eos> - My pot is fine.<eos> Your pot is stuck.<eos> - So, you're here to stir it?<eos> Someone has to.<eos> I know you think you're helping me...<eos> I am helping you.<eos> You'll see.<eos> - I don't see.<eos> You will.
Judas.<eos> I really do love this story of me traveling abroad to set up a royal retreat.<eos> I only wish I really was decorating a small palace.<eos> I hear it's beautiful and they throw the most marvelous summer's end parties in Norway.<eos> Dear Kenna, you'll be out to here by then.<eos> Perhaps if I stay on with your friends, after the baby's adopted by that couple in Sweden.<eos> I'm doing the right thing... the only thing I can do... is giving up the child.<eos> Thank you for finding me a loving home and family to hide out with.<eos> And as long as Bash doesn't say anything...<eos> He won't.
If I draw them away, you think you can plant the explosives and get out in time?<eos> Yeah, not a problem.<eos> There's no turning back after this, Red.<eos> If we do this, they're gonna hit us back hard.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Yeah, could be Barbie leading the charge.<eos> I'm not dying 'cause you can't pull the trigger on your boyfriend.<eos> Maybe it never comes to that.<eos> Yeah, well, if it does, you'd better not hesitate.<eos> - 'Cause I won't.
It's possible nobody survived this attack.<eos> The only bodies are out here.<eos> Jim had other safe houses on his radar.<eos> Maybe they escaped.<eos> Yeah, or they were taken.<eos> If they're alive, it won't be for long.<eos> The kinship still thinks that I'm a part of them, so why don't I head down to town hall, and see what I can find out.<eos> Okay, I'll go check out the other places the Resistance could be hiding.<eos> What if... somehow they know you're not one of them anymore?<eos> Hey, they won't.
I know.<eos> What would you say if I asked him on a little vacay?<eos> Somewhere far from the Hamptons.<eos> - Too soon?<eos> - No, I'd say go for it.<eos> Don't hold back, Nolan.<eos> That's what I did with Jack, and look where it got me.<eos> And I have a private jet at your beck and call...<eos> If you want to fix that.<eos> And I will.
Go.<eos> Helly.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> I'm sure you'll agree that discretion is in our best interests.<eos> Your secrets are safe with me.<eos> Of course in exchange, Helena is going to need a little favor.<eos> From one Queen to another.<eos> - If I refuse?<eos> - You won't.
But there are men outside, Really bad men, Who want to hurt us.<eos> The FBI agents?<eos> (Natalie) no, they're not FBI. They're SVR.<eos> (Sarah) oh, my god, we have to call the cops.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> Victor, the FBI, they're-- They're on their way,<eos> (Sarah) what if those guys come in before they get here?<eos> Upstairs, behind all that stuff in mom's closet.<eos> But if they find us up there...<eos> They won't.
That's the door.<eos> And, in my opinion, that's everything.<eos> That's what we'll grow.<eos> A big part of my pitch to them was that they could maintain creative freedom.<eos> Yeah. That was smart.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I, um... I went by the house.<eos> They told me.<eos> We don't know who did it.<eos> You probably never will.
Pernell?<eos> Pernell, I need you to sit back down.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> What do you see?<eos> Put the body where it belongs.<eos> Holy shit.<eos> No, no, you can't leave him at Julio's.<eos> I have to.<eos> What if someone finds him?<eos> - They won't.
We'd have both been sacked, drummed out of the profession for good.<eos> So you left a note and ran?<eos> - I had so little time to decide.<eos> I didn't know what else to do.<eos> Spoken to me.<eos> You should have spoken to me.<eos> I thought that you loved me.<eos> I did.<eos> I do.<eos> I always will.
Rene?<eos> It's me.<eos> Sarah.<eos> Remember.<eos> Sarah?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> There you are.<eos> We will find a way through this, you and I.<eos> We will.
Don't take me there, please!<eos> The fire, this town...<eos> I find it all hard to believe.<eos> And you've witnessed it, Michael.<eos> Our faith in God is the reason for everything.<eos> Our Father is here.<eos> Faith is useless in this world.<eos> That's not our truth.<eos> It's clear you don't believe in our faith.<eos> Perhaps you never will.
You will never know the truth unless you stop this!<eos> 01x04 Tango Uniform<eos> _<eos> Hamid was a fool, short-sighted.<eos> By killing him, I have done the Azawad Liberation Movement a favor.<eos> So now what?<eos> Now we wait to see if you live or die.<eos> Aslam.<eos> Pray they find him and he has this flash drive you say is so valuable.<eos> They will.
Let's bring him back and find out.<eos> The markings on Alex's body are Father's final message.<eos> If you harm him, they'll disappear forever.<eos> What good is a message if nobody can read it?<eos> Gabriel, please.<eos> Killing the boy won't matter.<eos> All we ever needed was his skin.<eos> If you kill him, you may as well kill me.<eos> I'll never forgive you.<eos> Oh, yes, you will.
How's she doing?<eos> Have you got anything I can give her for the pain?<eos> Nothing stronger than aspirin.<eos> The phone is in the kitchen if you need to make that call.<eos> I did.<eos> My cousin is coming to pick us up in the morning.<eos> We'll set up your mom in one of the bedrooms, okay?<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Aren't we leaving?<eos> Yeah, yeah, we will.
Fate put you on the throne, and fate dares you now to hold the line.<eos> More than a thousand years of rule.<eos> After all those centuries, this is what ends it?<eos> Your kids have too much fun?<eos> Your wife doesn't wait up for you when you come home?<eos> You're stronger than that, brother.<eos> I know you are.<eos> Plagues, wars, communism, Nazis.<eos> Everyone before you held the line.<eos> And so will you, my King.
And when he does, I will tell him nothing of your concern.<eos> Why would I?<eos> You had your chance.<eos> You took your turn.<eos> And when you did, how relevant were my feelings to you?<eos> And now you know.<eos> I'm trying to find him because I'm concerned about him.<eos> I'm worried that his world has just been destroyed and he's alone.<eos> Maybe you can sit back and wait for him to call you, but I can't.<eos> And I won't.
But I have to go back and you have to stay.<eos> It'll be easier this way.<eos> The last time I heard that was when my mom dropped me off in the States.<eos> And I accepted it because I thought there'd be a someday.<eos> But there wasn't.<eos> There was just... wasted time and then she was gone.<eos> I don't believe in someday.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Lucky for you, I do.<eos> And I always will.
Hey.<eos> All right?<eos> Come here.<eos> Behaving as if you were already President before the other members have voted for you is a bit...<eos> Don't you think there's something rather Joyce-like about that?<eos> This pitch alone would yield over a hundred thousand square feet of prime agricultural land.<eos> Why would anyone play cricket on it when it could be used to feed people?<eos> Because not everyone thinks like you.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> But they will.
Elizabeth. She's fine.<eos> You need to go to my flat.<eos> I'm taking take care of it.<eos> You were right, dembe.<eos> I should have told her.<eos> I understand why you didn't.<eos> No. You don't.<eos> The blessing of an honest man.<eos> She still hasn't found caul.<eos> She won't.
I told you.<eos> Those basic hos are super basic.<eos> Ooh...<eos> That's nice.<eos> I didn't know things had changed so much.<eos> I just want to go dancing like we used to.<eos> Just one more time.<eos> No, thanks.<eos> I'll go dancing with you.<eos> You will?
We should be calling the government to take him back.<eos> Yes, so we can get our reward.<eos> Has it never occurred to either of you the trouble you've caused by bringing him here?<eos> Nasrin, please.<eos> You're not being helpful.<eos> You didn't tell us your name.<eos> Once he's finished eating, bring him home.<eos> Give him something to wear that won't draw attention.<eos> What if the government finds out that we are harboring a fugitive?<eos> They won't.
I don't care.<eos> By the time I got to Marion's house, they were loading him in the ambulance.<eos> I had to see him.<eos> Jack.<eos> Please don't leave me.<eos> I need you.<eos> I'm not gonna put Victoria in prison.<eos> I'm gonna put her in the ground.<eos> And don't you dare try to stop me.<eos> I won't.
You didn't mention that before.<eos> You know, Jamie, there's a chance I can help you remember if, uh... if you're willing to try.<eos> Welcome.<eos> Usually folks make an appointment, but...<eos> I think I can squeeze you in.<eos> Appreciate that.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I want you to do something for me.<eos> I'm afraid I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Those were her very words?<eos> Was it all lies, then?<eos> Did she never care for me at all?<eos> I'm sure she did.<eos> If I am to die, then I need to know her feelings for me were true.<eos> You must ask for an audience.<eos> See her in person.<eos> You are right.<eos> I'll look into her eyes and I'll know.<eos> We both will.
Nothing further.<eos> And brutally forcing himself inside of her, again and again.<eos> Nothing further.<eos> Thank you, Doctor.<eos> Counselor, good job.<eos> - Did you see what we saw?<eos> - The real Greg Yates?<eos> I just hope the jury saw it.<eos> They haven't yet.<eos> They will.
You know, we're together now, the three of us.<eos> That means we share the good stuff and the bad.<eos> I know.<eos> It... it really is nothing.<eos> Is it a ghost thing?<eos> Yeah. I guess I'm kind of still getting used to talking about that.<eos> Well, so am I.<eos> And sometimes it can be a...<eos> I don't want you to worry.<eos> I won't.
Well, yeah.<eos> Callie's getting her license.<eos> I haven't done the test yet, so fingers crossed.<eos> I'm sure you'll pass with flying colors.<eos> And you have a birthday coming up too.<eos> Yes, we're gonna have a party at the house, so I'd love for you all to come.<eos> Of course. We'd love to.<eos> We'll be there.<eos> Sophia, you need to eat something.<eos> And I will.
Come with me to the crags and then decide who speaks the truth.<eos> You want to save this town.<eos> You want to be Salem's leader.<eos> All I ask is that you see for yourself.<eos> I won't have any more of this nonsense.<eos> N-no, doctor.<eos> We shall go, all three of us.<eos> With all due respect, Magistrate...<eos> As magistrate, it is not your respect I require but your obedience.<eos> As you will.
Let's go.<eos> Okay, and... 16, 17, 18!<eos> Thank you for coming.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Spent the day in basic training.<eos> Nolan's whipping us into shape to face your good pal Rahm Tak.<eos> Rahm's no friend of mine.<eos> Any word of your mother?<eos> They haven't caught her yet.<eos> They never will.
~ I'm sorry. ~ SHE LAUGHS<eos> Mmm. This is good.<eos> Your favourite.<eos> You not eating?<eos> Have a bit more.<eos> ~ HE CHUCKLES ~ Why?<eos> Because I love you.<eos> I want you to remember that.<eos> Never forget it.<eos> I won't.
Three, two, one.<eos> Have a seat.<eos> Bingo.<eos> Do you think death by 1,000 cuts will work on Ferguson?<eos> Only takes one to open an artery.<eos> He's colicky, love, that's all it is.<eos> And Arty used to be exactly the same.<eos> He'd get gassed up and there was nothing you could do, and he had lungs on him like a bloody trombone.<eos> He won't feed, Liz.<eos> No, he will.
I'm sorry.<eos> Stop saying that.<eos> - Stop saying that you're sorry.<eos> - Look, look...<eos> I don't want to go through life always worried about what's around the next corner.<eos> And I don't want my kids to, either.<eos> - Your kids?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> What happened to Steffan can never happen again.<eos> - It won't.
Neil said.<eos> He wouldn't.<eos> Just after we slept together.<eos> He was all right, actually.<eos> I wouldn't sell tickets but we had a good time.<eos> You wanted to get back at me.<eos> Is it sinking in?<eos> Have you felt it yet?<eos> No.<eos> But you will.
I never thought I'd see Jason attack his friends.<eos> He is not the Jason we know.<eos> We mustn't forget that.<eos> He was the Jason we know when he killed Medusa.<eos> I know how you feel about him right now, but you must remember what the Oracle said.<eos> Jason is the only person who can save Atlantis.<eos> I'm going to find Melas.<eos> If anyone knows how to help Jason, Melas surely will.<eos> ~ If they find you...<eos> ~ They won't.
- Please, I'm sorry.<eos> - Get out.<eos> I hate you.<eos> Get out. - John...<eos> - Get out! Get out! Get out!<eos> Get out!<eos> There, now.<eos> She feels your pain.<eos> I told you she would.<eos> And soon they all will.
I wouldn't assume that.<eos> We need more time to analyze the data.<eos> You don't have more time.<eos> This country needs a victory now.<eos> - I think you mean your husband.<eos> - My husband is this country.<eos> If he fails, it fails.<eos> I'm telling you, I know him.<eos> You need to act now.<eos> The president and I will...
Dad, how old were you when you knew?<eos> Knew what?<eos> That you wanted to be a writer.<eos> Since I was a kid, I guess.<eos> Why?<eos> I'm finishing my junior year, and I have no idea what I want to do.<eos> By the time you were my age, you'd already published your first book, and now you're winning this amazing award because you followed your passion.<eos> How can I be amazing if I can't find mine?<eos> Trust me.<eos> You will.
Steph.<eos> I've seen you looking... at the planes overhead... .. the trucks going past...<eos> You're staring into your plate at supper.<eos> You're lying in bed...<eos> your back to me.<eos> Taking yourself off up here to brood, instead of talking to your wife about the most important decision you'll ever make in your... in all our lives.<eos> You want to go and fight... Stan?<eos> Go. Because you're no bloody good to us like this.<eos> I know every inch of you, man, inside and out. I always have.<eos> I always will.
I hope this isn't indicative of how you've been running the Jeffersonian in my absence.<eos> This was my oversight, not Dr. Saroyan's.<eos> I understand that you're angry and...<eos> You told me my husband is dead.<eos> Angry doesn't begin to cover it.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> There's no time for that.<eos> We still don't know who this is or how he died.<eos> And we'll figure that out.<eos> Yes, we will.
Of course.<eos> You must do as you are bid.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I wanted to see you again before I left.<eos> - I'm returning home to Colchis.<eos> - Why? What's happened?<eos> Pasiphae's protected me since I was a child.<eos> I realise now that she nurtured me so I would become like her.<eos> But I cannot.<eos> I won't.
Graham: We had a deal.<eos> No contact, ever.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> ISIS has turned Iraq into a giant death camp.<eos> It's become impossible to move anything back home.<eos> You brought merchandise with you?<eos> It is on a shipping container to the Port of Newark Terminal tonight.<eos> One of the 27 statues of Gudea.<eos> Yeah, I recognize it.<eos> So will everyone else.
You know of River Song, wife of Hydroflax?<eos> I do.<eos> I know River Song of old.<eos> And if you spare me, I'll tell you who she's really married to.<eos> - Explain.<eos> - You need a head.<eos> I can get you a head... fit for a king.<eos> Why do you delay?<eos> We have paid, we will receive.<eos> Yes, you will.

You are the woman who loves the Doctor.<eos> Yes, I am.<eos> I've never denied it.<eos> But whoever said he loved me back?<eos> He's the Doctor, he doesn't go around falling in love with people.<eos> And if you think he's anything that small or that ordinary, then you haven't the first idea of what you're dealing with.<eos> Your Majesty, I assure you, she is the perfect bait.<eos> When this woman is in danger, the Doctor will always come.<eos> Oh, you are a moron.<eos> No, he won't.
The fact that he hasn't indicates that he has deep pockets and a network of resources at his disposal.<eos> Share this profile with your local divisions and with law enforcement.<eos> Search for escrow payments to match the unsub to his clients.<eos> One of those clients will be his next target.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hey, Al.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I'm heading out.<eos> Did you finish that engine transfer on that Jeep?<eos> I will tomorrow.
I'm just looking out for my people.<eos> And you think that I'm not?<eos> Look, I heard what Rick said.<eos> Which part?<eos> How they wouldn't all make it.<eos> They meaning us and not you.<eos> How you should leave us behind if we can't keep up.<eos> Glenn is out there risking his life for you and for everyone else and I'm still here, so I don't know what the hell you're talking about.<eos> Things are gonna get worse and then we'll see.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Our battle's already lost without them.<eos> Wilkin.<eos> Halt!<eos> Two legions or more.<eos> Armor from hoof to head.<eos> What is it?<eos> We will not defeat them on steeds.<eos> You will know what to do.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Um, if you're looking for Caleb, he went to say goodbye to the analysts who got the ax.<eos> He passed?<eos> Miranda's test and yours.<eos> You didn't really want him to take the bribe, did you?<eos> Miss Wyatt, my son is a screw-up.<eos> I want him to find his place in the world.<eos> I just don't believe for a second it's here.<eos> And if you're honest with yourself, you'd agree.<eos> No, I don't.<eos> You will.
He won't "chat".<eos> Unless you're talking about mathematics, the discussion will be a waste of time.<eos> Is it possible that Alex would have confided in him?<eos> - That's a very serious allegation.<eos> - I'm just thinking aloud.<eos> Marcus admired Alex.<eos> On some level, he might have envied him, but... .. I can't believe he'd want to harm him.<eos> Could you arrange a meeting?<eos> So you do have something specific you're going to speak to him about?<eos> - We will.
- Not that I recall.<eos> I had sex with someone else when we were still together.<eos> You know about Carmen accusing Rita of hitting her?<eos> And I have a recording of Carmen admitting that she lied.<eos> Carmen knows that I kissed you.<eos> The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.<eos> It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.
The judge will never let Lena and Stef adopt me.<eos> It just wasn't meant to be.<eos> I should probably go back to my room.<eos> I'm afraid Mariana's going to wake up.<eos> She won't.<eos> That girl sleeps like the dead, you know that.<eos> I wish we could stay here forever.<eos> ...and ever and ever.<eos> Do you think they know yet?<eos> They will soon.
We didn't even break any rules.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Technically, we weren't even fostering when you came to Idyllwild.<eos> You were staying at G.U.<eos> And the thought of adoption wasn't even a possibility.<eos> Yes, but it... - We didn't do anything wrong.<eos> - You don't think so?<eos> We can't... We can't ever tell anyone.<eos> I know.<eos> We won't.
Louis, we've already been over this.<eos> His lawyer's his wife.<eos> You're never gonna sign him.<eos> Well, that's just it. I don't need to sign him.<eos> I only need to pretend to sign him.<eos> Okay. That's a bad idea.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> If Jack thinks I signed Dellmore, and I tell him I'll give him a piece, he'll know it's worth a fortune to him and he'll overturn the vote.<eos> And what are you gonna do when he finds out the whole thing was a lie?<eos> He won't.
Time to start!<eos> Kakarot!<eos> I've accepted the fact that you are the strongest Saiyan.<eos> Stop that!<eos> I had just gotten to a good place.<eos> But even so, Kakarot.<eos> I have no interest in being the second best!<eos> One day I will surpass you!<eos> No...<eos> I will surpas everyone in this universe!
Can we meet somewhere?<eos> Sure.<eos> I'm just leaving Amsterdam now.<eos> I'll call you when I'm closer to home.<eos> I'll be waiting.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Of course.<eos> And, Allison, please don't tell anyone about this.<eos> Anyone.<eos> I won't.
And Otto?<eos> Have you seen Jonas, by any chance?<eos> No.<eos> Why?<eos> I was... just wondering if he'd asked about me or... wanted to know where I was.<eos> Should I tell him about your situation?<eos> No, it's fine.<eos> I'll just get Numan, then, hmm?<eos> And you-- you be careful.<eos> I will.
She must be desperate.<eos> She has to support Ben or she'll lose him.<eos> I couldn't care less about Lori's problems.<eos> Someone has to do something to stop her.<eos> And I guess it's not gonna be you.<eos> ♪♪ Excuse me, number two, could you hand me a beer?<eos> I wouldn't get too comfortable if I were you.<eos> By the end of the year, you'll be back where you belong... many paces behind me.<eos> Oh, we'll see about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
It's a miracle, that's what it is.<eos> It certainly seems so.<eos> I feel disposed to celebrate.<eos> I'll fetch a fresh bottle.<eos> Nothing broke!<eos> Hurry up and finish the decorations, your father'll be home soon.<eos> - Where's Peter?<eos> - Here!<eos> - Will he have the goose?<eos> - Yes, he will.
It's Wessex.<eos> They'll take one look at you and kill you as a Dane.<eos> Whereas Ubba will kill me as an Englishman.<eos> With King Aethelred, we have a chance of everything.<eos> What do you say?<eos> Come with me.<eos> - Why do they stare?<eos> - They think you're pretty.<eos> Or they've never seen a Dane so close.<eos> But they will.
All I ask is that you last long enough to occupy him while I steal back the dreamcatchers.<eos> Ah, yes.<eos> But for that...<eos> I don't need this.<eos> This... is where that magic belongs.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You can't beat Hook without it.<eos> Well, my feud with the captain predates you by centuries.<eos> And if I am gonna beat him, I'm gonna do it with honor.<eos> And I will.
but my home is here.<eos> Here?<eos> Among people that call you traitor?<eos> Your husband, it is dead.<eos> You must at long last stop grieving and move forward.<eos> But my son and grandchild are here and very much alive.<eos> Bring them along.<eos> I promise you, we will treat them as equals, as family.<eos> Tell me you will consider it.<eos> I will.
[Bry chuckles] It's Snapchat.<eos> You see, you were mixing up Snapchat and Facebook.<eos> [McKeyla] Sir, you don't understand.<eos> I work for an elite group of women operatives from all over the world.<eos> [Bry] Is this what usually happens?<eos> No, not when I'm on my own.<eos> -What do we do now?<eos> -They're never gonna let us in.<eos> You're right.<eos> They won't.
Listen, why don't you go unpack and we'll have dinner ready in an hour.<eos> Cool.<eos> I'm gonna open some wine.<eos> Do you think she's ready?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Is anyone ever?<eos> At a certain point we're just going to have to trust in the future, right?<eos> I just hope that she'll learn to believe in herself.<eos> And that she'll stand up for herself.<eos> She will.
What's with all the Band-Aids?<eos> Paper cuts.<eos> Sitting in my cell all day, doing legal research on my case, unfortunately I hit a brick wall.<eos> Not a lot of loopholes when you kill your wife's lover and then you try to kill your best detective.<eos> - I'll never stop regretting that.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hauser, time's up.<eos> Is that it?<eos> I didn't get anything.<eos> You will, hotshot.

That you see her future-murder in a vision?<eos> Does it matter what we tell her if we save her life?<eos> Look, even if we do manage to scare her off without completely outing your identity, what happens next?<eos> Well, she lives, for one thing.<eos> And Tyson walks to kill again, when we won't be there.<eos> The only way to take him off the streets for good is to catch him red-handed. With his victim.<eos> By using her as bait.<eos> And what if you mess up?<eos> - What if you can't stop it?<eos> - I will.
Peekaboo, bitch.<eos> Vega, stand down.<eos> Let's face it, Will.<eos> You're not a closer.<eos> - You...<eos> - Stand clear.<eos> - You have no idea what's coming.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Stand clear.<eos> - And you never will!
Probably.<eos> You're right.<eos> I mean, we've been stuck in worse places together before.<eos> I like that word... together.<eos> So what happened, Kate?<eos> What did I do wrong?<eos> Castle, this one's not about you.<eos> It's on me.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Robert, you accuse of me of such terrible things.<eos> - Why would I ever...?<eos> - Because you know.<eos> Admit it, Amy.<eos> I don't know anything, truly I don't.<eos> I love her.<eos> Don't.<eos> Please.<eos> I always have.<eos> I always will.
Again. 200.<eos> Clear.<eos> I have a pulse.<eos> Sinus tach at 112.<eos> And... he's back.<eos> Get a BP and keep giving him blood.<eos> Send a rainbow of tubes and a type and cross.<eos> Get his blood gas and get him to the OR.<eos> Did you find my dad yet?<eos> We will, sweetheart.
We subpoenaed his call logs before his phone went dead.<eos> And speaking of, the most common call made was to an Amanda Derkos.<eos> That is Greek, right?<eos> Not that it makes any difference.<eos> The address is on the south side.<eos> Conway mentioned a girlfriend, so...<eos> Great.<eos> Jay and I will take it.<eos> - I'll go with.<eos> - No, you won't.
Just because I forget to press record on one audition, suddenly he's questioning my integrity?<eos> Hey, Malmuth, you want to come after me?<eos> I welcome it.<eos> But what I don't welcome is you bringing my nephew into this.<eos> Because the only thing he's guilty of is following his little baby heart.<eos> Fine. I've got nothing to hide.<eos> And I'm quite confident that Principal Davis will see things the same as me.<eos> Well, we'll just see.<eos> Mm-hmm. Won't we?<eos> We will.
Whatever happened to mugs?<eos> Did he land on his feet?<eos> Unfortunately, no.<eos> Mugs had borrowed $500,000 from a loan shark against the value of the painting.<eos> When he didn't steal it, he couldn't pay it back. A few weeks later, the loan shark shot him dead.<eos> There's something going on with that vent.<eos> Time to go.<eos> I don't understand. How did they find us?<eos> They didn't.<eos> And they won't.
I think you can give him a little of your time!<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> [Register beeping]<eos> Find everything you needed today?<eos> Yes.<eos> Okay, looks like your total comes to $37.98.<eos> Would you like to give a dollar to help feed hungry kids?<eos> Yes, I would like to give a dollar.<eos> You want to give a dollar?<eos> Yes, I will.
I don't blame you, child.<eos> Francis was his own man, who made his own choices.<eos> Long ago, he chose to love you.<eos> I see you as children so clearly now, as if it was yesterday.<eos> Your love... it gave him so much joy.<eos> And that is what you must remember as you move ahead in this life.<eos> Move ahead?<eos> I don't know how.<eos> I'm confident that you will find a way.<eos> Maybe not today or tomorrow, but you will, Mary.
It isn't right.<eos> You took a stand.<eos> I admired that.<eos> That's why I kept my mouth shut all these years, and that's why I'm going to help you out of this mess now.<eos> What does NCIS have on me?<eos> The camera connecting you to Meyers.<eos> It's circumstantial.<eos> Yes, but... shooting Meyers really mucked things up.<eos> You need to get ahead of NCIS before they find something.<eos> They won't.
Following his orders.<eos> As am I.<eos> And what orders might those be?<eos> Well, frankly, not to botch the job like my predecessor,<eos> Nicholas, did and let you tear up a treaty that was signed without witnesses.<eos> There will be no more such oversights.<eos> My God, you are quite beautiful.<eos> Between you and Elizabeth, I don't know who is the more stunning.<eos> And will that be going in Elizabeth's transcript?<eos> It will not.
Mrs. Suzuki.<eos> I owe you an apology.<eos> - I shouldn't have...<eos> - I don't need an apology.<eos> I thought about what you said on the phone the other day, and...<eos> He could've been suicidal.<eos> Anyway, after you called, I started poking around.<eos> He had a beer fridge, and I found this in the freezer.<eos> I don't know what to make of it.<eos> Maybe you will.
Do you know I'm a cop?<eos> You're a cop?<eos> Better change your uniform.<eos> I like it when you dress up.<eos> Put these on.<eos> Well, he didn't break in.<eos> Do you know how he could get in?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Come to the station tomorrow if you want to press charges.<eos> - I will.
It is PET insurance and I'm actually covering all of the large mammals in the south west now, so...<eos> - Well done you.<eos> - It's a big deal for me.<eos> Mate, come on, don't go.<eos> Just, like, have a couple more drinks or something.<eos> Why are we hugging?<eos> Cos this is it.<eos> This is goodbye.<eos> I'm never going to see you again with your new cat insurance job and your new wife and your...<eos> You will.
That's how I got out in time.<eos> I knew they were still inside.<eos> But I just kept running.<eos> And I kept going until I couldn't hear them screaming any more.<eos> I was the oldest.<eos> They were screaming for me.<eos> You were only a child.<eos> After that day, I swore that I would never love anyone ever again.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You won't.
What time is it?<eos> Uh, 7:02. And you will notice... you're still alive.<eos> That's nice.<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Would you wanna know when you were gonna die?<eos> No.<eos> But if you did... what would you do if you knew how long you had?<eos> I would try and figure out how to be happy.<eos> Then why don't you?<eos> Maybe I will.
I'm almost 16, godmother.<eos> I can take care of myself.<eos> I understand.<eos> That's not what I have to say to you..<eos> - I have a plan.<eos> When I grow up, I'm going to live here in the Moors with you.<eos> Then we can look after each other.<eos> You don't have to wait until you're older.<eos> You could live here now.<eos> Then I will!
I've seen the Omega.<eos> It's pretty much game over tomorrow. So can we move this along?<eos> Okay.<eos> Where?<eos> There's a dam. It's in the mountains. I saw German writing.<eos> Do you think you can work out where that is?<eos> I mean, there can't be... too many places that fit that description.<eos> Training's over. I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> We don't even know where we're going.<eos> We will soon enough.
Tell him about Type B. You gotta wine them, dine them.<eos> - Then what do they do?<eos> - Break your balls.<eos> They bust-a the balls.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - You don't get it.<eos> You see this face?<eos> He don't get it.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
He won't be raising any alarms unless he has her on his side.<eos> And that I can assure you will never happen.<eos> Someone's escaped.<eos> Oi.<eos> Hai!<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> Here.<eos> If they reach town, it's the end of us.<eos> They won't.
Yeah, sure.<eos> Try.<eos> - There!<eos> - That's all you got?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Did it again!<eos> Did it again!<eos> - Dylan, stop... stop it. - I won't.<eos> No, I'm not going to.<eos> I won't.
Malcolm.<eos> I know everyone's depending on you...<eos> I don't care about that.<eos> I don't care about any of that.<eos> I care about him.<eos> He saw things that no kid should see, and I'm not letting us go back to that.<eos> I know.<eos> I have been trying to get closer to him.<eos> But...<eos> You will.
You let them stay!<eos> Put apes in danger!<eos> Caesar love humans more... than apes!<eos> More than your... sons.<eos> Ape... not... kill... ape.<eos> Forgive me.<eos> You are my son...<eos> I need you to listen...<eos> You didn't tell Caesar about the guns we found?<eos> Neither will you.
Over and over.<eos> And I suppose that was a prayer.<eos> After, did you feel any better?<eos> I mean, a few days later I started feeling much worse.<eos> You know, seriously panicking, paralyzed in bed.<eos> What about now?<eos> I feel... different.<eos> It's like she sort of cleaned me out or something.<eos> Um, do you think you'll still play the show?<eos> Yeah, I will.
Eddie, please, give me the gun.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I was drowning. I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute praying to be somebody else. Somebody I'm not!<eos> Anybody-<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed. She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> And you never will.
Tell me.<eos> Why do I always have to beg people to love me?<eos> Eddie, please, give me the gun.<eos> It was me. I was drowning. I'm just not capable of...<eos> You deserve to be loved, Eddie. You do.<eos> I just wanted to be what you wanted. What you wanted.<eos> Now I spend every fucking minute trying to be something else, something I'm not.<eos> Just put the gun down, Ed. She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> You don't, do you?<eos> NO. And you never will.
When the show's on is irrelevant.<eos> You don't go, "when's that YouTube video on?"<eos> It's just on.<eos> So, forget the when.<eos> Forget "nights" and "time slots" and "lead-ins."<eos> So, how are people supposed to know when...<eos> Forget the when!<eos> What... what when?<eos> What I mean is, how will they know what's on?<eos> They won't.
I've been meaning to ask you.<eos> Our mutual friend, she put guards at your door, tried to protect you.<eos> Yet you left anyway.<eos> Why?<eos> You really have to ask?<eos> How did you feel when she threw you aside?<eos> When she's ready, get her on a boat.<eos> Captain, this isn't what I meant by cleaning up.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
Hey, you got dark circles, my sweetheart.<eos> - A friend has new Fifa pension.<eos> - You have the right to play it?<eos> - Even zonzon, they are entitled.<eos> - But how you talk, you?<eos> - At table.<eos> - I dribble like I want.<eos> I'm too strong.<eos> - What it does, the arbitrator?<eos> It will cardboard.
So what do you wanna do about it?<eos> You're the problem solver around here.<eos> Yeah, I am.<eos> And what if I woke up one day and just said, "I'm not gonna find a way today"?<eos> What if I just left?<eos> Hell, you've been gone for a month doing who knows what.<eos> Who do you think has been taking care of business around here?<eos> No one.<eos> I need you to check this one again, Eddie.<eos> Will you?
I can buy my own damn vodka.<eos> Look, he said he'll cover everything for our trip: petrol, food, guns.<eos> I'm so excited, I could wet my pants!<eos> - Kolya...<eos> - Pasha.<eos> - It'll only take a second.<eos> - I'm serious.<eos> I can't today.<eos> Tell him to come tomorrow.<eos> - I will.
I haven't seen Goldie in a while.<eos> How you doing?<eos> I'm all right.<eos> You wanna race?<eos> Come on, that's a hybrid.<eos> Way to wiggle out of getting beat.<eos> You and Mom going for a drive?<eos> Well, that was the plan.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> No, she won't.
Don't be afraid. I will be over there.<eos> Good dog!<eos> Hello everybody.<eos> Can we start?<eos> - A bit faster.<eos> - I bet he'll start barking.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Wanna bet?<eos> - He won't bark.<eos> - And what if he will?
In all seriousness, I'm actually asking.<eos> - I'm a little scared, dude.<eos> - All right.<eos> Here, I'll take the map.<eos> No, I just wanna...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> - Excited. Yeah. - Yeah?<eos> You're gonna let me know if I run into a tree walking backwards, right?<eos> - -You didn't answer my question!<eos> - I will.
Do you want to have breakfast?<eos> I want to, but I can't.<eos> I got my son's basketball game in an hour.<eos> What about lunch?<eos> I can't.<eos> I have the Founders' Tea for the charity gala with my mom.<eos> Oh, you would not believe how much those women care about floral arrangements.<eos> So no breakfast, no lunch. Mm-mm.<eos> So I guess that means I'll see you later, then?<eos> Yes, you will.
It's open.<eos> Just a tiny bit, but it is open.<eos> You keep trying to close that door because you're scared.<eos> But you won't always be scared.<eos> What's behind the door?<eos> Besides my dirty laundry.<eos> You have to go in to find out.<eos> You know what I'm talking about.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> You will.

Frankie's gonna be the only freshman on the team.<eos> Hey, didn't you used to be in the grade above me?<eos> What are you, the grade police?<eos> Okay.<eos> Cool. [Chuckles]<eos> Well, my parents are out of town. And I'm having people, over Friday night.<eos> You guys should come.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we totally will.
You'll have to go to the police.<eos> I'm not going to the police, you prick.<eos> It's only going to be worse if they have to come and get you, innit?<eos> Why are they going to come and get me, eh?<eos> What are you saying?<eos> You going to grass me up?<eos> Is that what you're saying, you're going to grass on me?<eos> No, I'm not saying that.<eos> How are they going to know it's me, then?<eos> They won't.
Well, it was great to meet you.<eos> Welcome, and I wish you luck.<eos> - You ready?<eos> If there's anything you need, anything at all... don't hesitate to call the office.<eos> I'm sorry this happened to you.<eos> See you soon.<eos> Do you think I'm ready to move into sales?<eos> No, I don't.<eos> - I don't think I'll be able to...<eos> - You will.
Vlad very busy.<eos> He's meeting with his 10:00 now.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> He has very long day ahead.<eos> - We'll wait.<eos> - No, we won't.
Then we will.<eos> I don't remember what happens really, but some things I do.<eos> You've been kind.<eos> Everybody.<eos> Not like you.<eos> I might have fallen in love with you.<eos> You don't mind me saying that?<eos> You still might.<eos> Don't let me hurt anyone.<eos> I won't.
The case was originally under the control of a County officer, Superintendent Edgeton - a good man but out of his depth.<eos> Public feeling was running high.<eos> There was a demand for quick justice.<eos> The Yard sent Detective Inspector Langley and Detective Constable Cuff to take over the investigations.<eos> Their enquiries soon led to Joseph O'Connell, originally of County Wicklow and a well-known local poacher.<eos> It was given under oath at the inquest by the family gamekeeper,<eos> Benjamin Pickstock and his son Robert, that O'Connell had been sworn to be revenged on Blaise-Hamilton...<eos> ..for a just flogging received at his hand.<eos> We found no record of the trial.<eos> Nor will you.
I just... I just lost my head.<eos> I weighted him down and laid him to rest.<eos> You mean he's in the loch?<eos> Markham or Henderson were to dredge the loch...<eos> I could never let that happen.<eos> It was such a long time ago.<eos> It's like it... It's like it never really happened.<eos> One thing you should understand.<eos> I loved my brother.<eos> I always will.
It's my cross to bear, not yours.<eos> And I should be the one that deals with it.<eos> And I will.<eos> Right now you can see what it feels like to be a caged animal, where just a glimpse of the sky constitutes a room with a view.<eos> Could I get a café con leche, por favor?<eos> Sí, señor.<eos> Your money may be buying you special privileges in here...<eos> But it's not gonna get you out.<eos> No?<eos> And neither will Nicolas Treviño.
I had a brother pass away, when I was little.<eos> He was four. And a quarter.<eos> My mum never likes it if we leave the quarter off.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I sometimes reckon, if he had lived now, he wouldn't have died.<eos> Times change for the better, don't they?<eos> Yes. They do.<eos> No sign of the GPO engineers?<eos> I keep pacing up and down by the telephone in case they might ring to say they are on their way.<eos> Which of course they won't.
Feel that. Feel it.<eos> His little heart is beating so fast.<eos> I'm gonna call you Whiskers.<eos> You like that? I think he likes it.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - I think he's perfect.<eos> That's your new home.<eos> You like it?<eos> Do you like it here?<eos> He will.
And you're wrapped up in them and they're wrapped up in you.<eos> And you-- for a little-- for a little while, you're more than just you.<eos> You're-<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I'm not a bleeding poet.<eos> No, you're really not.<eos> What did I get for it?<eos> An arrow six inches from my heart.<eos> There'll be arrows for all of us soon, I imagine.<eos> There will.
I'll get help. Shh.<eos> Maester Aemon is coming.<eos> He's gonna make it all right.<eos> - Now.<eos> - Now!<eos> The outer gate won't hold.<eos> Take five men, hold the inner gate.<eos> Hold the gate.<eos> If they make it through...<eos> They won't.
Who are you?<eos> Are you from the monastery?<eos> I am not important but he might be...<eos> This little one I found wandering in the woods.<eos> My duty here is done.<eos> He goes with you now.<eos> Hello, my child. What is your name?<eos> It will take more than that, my friend.<eos> If he has a voice, I couldn't find it.<eos> In time maybe you will.
You look good, Bunch.<eos> I like the tie.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Thanks, guys.<eos> - You trace the call?<eos> - Yeah. My guy from ATT says that Daryll was driving past a cell phone tower in Baja.<eos> - Heading south.<eos> - All right.<eos> Stay on it.<eos> I will.
It's like anyone else's.<eos> - Are you with the Reds?<eos> - With the Soviets?<eos> Do you work for Lenin and Trotsky?<eos> Are you a Bolshevik?<eos> Did you create a plan to finance Soviet Russia and destroy American banks and financial institutions?<eos> Who thinks that?<eos> Important people in Washington.<eos> Sir, is it true we won't start again?<eos> We will, Lucy Meli.
I'm not...<eos> I'm not ready to hear this.<eos> When I met your father we were teenagers and I never expected to be with anyone else.<eos> Never.<eos> But then one day, things change, and it's over.<eos> And I'd be lying if I said it doesn't still hurt.<eos> It does.<eos> But it's like a broken bone that's healed... and still throbs every time it rains.<eos> It doesn't feel like this is ever gonna go away though.<eos> Sweetie, it will.

What's the big deal?<eos> We didn't do anything, Ezra.<eos> That's not the point.<eos> Then what are you so freaked out about?<eos> God help me, Alison, I actually like you.<eos> I just don't want to see you get hurt.<eos> You're an all right guy.<eos> See you around.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
I have just been under so much pressure at work, and it's lessened my libido.<eos> That happens, Victor.<eos> That's a real thing.<eos> Then my wife is never gonna work.<eos> It is a lot of responsibility being the sole breadwinner.<eos> I know.<eos> I did it for years.<eos> But I learned to leave my work at the office to make time for you.<eos> I don't want our marriage to fail.<eos> I... it won't.
What does he know, Duncan? What does he know?<eos> Well, well. Doktor Hume.<eos> Come to mend our ills.<eos> What's up Doc?<eos> You here to examine my wrist, are you?<eos> - Back up, Doctor Hume.<eos> - You'r a long way from the moral high ground down here, Doctor.<eos> Still, we all make mistakes, eh?<eos> - Mind your own, Beswick.<eos> - Oh, I will if he will.
Then it's unequal.<eos> When someone you love... ls subtracted from you...<eos> When...<eos> Then it feels like, you know, that your value is less than it was.<eos> Does that make sense?<eos> Why did he have to go?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - It just doesn't make sense.<eos> - I know.<eos> It never will.
O... okay, but we're not gonna be doing any touristy stuff.<eos> - Nor would I want to.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Let me just grab my poncho, my traveler's checks, and my walking stick.<eos> I'll be right back!<eos> Uh, can I... sit here, or are you guys saving this seat for Evan?<eos> She doesn't know.<eos> She wouldn't care.<eos> - She might.<eos> - She won't.
My husband was particularly impressed with it.<eos> I'll tell him.<eos> Is that a Welsh accent I can hear?<eos> Uh-<eos> - Oh. Uh, maybe.<eos> The remnants.<eos> I haven't been home in a long time, so...<eos> - We're looking forward to seeing them all back here soon.<eos> And wish Jonathan a happy Christmas from all of us in Dulais, will you?<eos> Of course I will.
Have some pride.<eos> Because life is short, okay?<eos> It's short.<eos> Okay?<eos> - What should I tell the others?<eos> - Nothing. I wasn't here.<eos> You're a mad bugger.<eos> I'm taking you home after that. In the van. No arguments.<eos> Will you give this to Jeff, please, Joe?<eos> Of course I will.
He comes here, to the club...<eos> Danielino, the one working at the garage.<eos> He did a few things for me.<eos> How's he part of all this?<eos> His girlfriend was the girl in the car, the girl with the ring.<eos> I'm looking for him, but haven't found him yet.<eos> If this girl and Tonino Russo are connected...<eos> Now you tell me!<eos> He came here, to the club, but he was your man and you gotta find him.<eos> - I will.
You're this guy.<eos> And this guy is awesome.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Yeah, I don't know, I'm, uh...<eos> I can't believe I'm saying this, I'm, um...<eos> Almost look forward to this turn.<eos> Because you're with us.<eos> And I mean this when I say this:<eos> Everyone here gets you, Josh.<eos> And Nora will too.
MOW.!<eos> That girl, Noemi...<eos> I left her.<eos> You were right, she was no good for me.<eos> Good, you did well.<eos> MOW.!<eos> What is it?<eos> - Will you miss me a little?<eos> - Good heavens, Gennaro...<eos> Of course I will.
On the night of the storm, after... STAR Labs... they explode, after the plane crashed and woke up on the floor, live, when I saw what I could do not understand it.<eos> I am God .n-Shut up.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Do you think your arms can stop God?<eos> Why "God" will Banks need to steal?<eos> He's right.<eos> I've been thinking small.<eos> Barry, Barry.<eos> This is approaching.<eos> Wind speed will 320 km / h and up.
Listen. Listen. We have to get married!<eos> Why?<eos> Because if we don't...<eos> I get nothing.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Read the contract, alejandro!<eos> You know, my album, my tour --<eos> If you run off with dario, it -- it all goes away.<eos> Baby, I won't let that happen.<eos> You won't?
That's good!<eos> I was really worried about you.<eos> As well you should be.<eos> You're the reason I fell.<eos> No, not true.<eos> You may have gotten distracted while I was talking.<eos> You were spewing vile rumors about a dead woman, trying to shock me.<eos> Now, that's just silly.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And neither will Nicholas.
Then you will drive me to the sale at Gucci, where I will orgasm twice more.<eos> I'm not really in the mood.<eos> Since when?<eos> Mrs. Powell, please...<eos> Why do you keep calling me Mrs. Powell?<eos> I-I'm not trying to upset you.<eos> Well, then I think you should be a good employee and get naked.<eos> All right.<eos> I really can't afford to lose this job.<eos> Well, you won't.
I know that.<eos> At least, I know it now.<eos> But I also know that Jacob needs to love, and be loved, just like any other human being.<eos> And the board have decided he'd be better off out of temptation's way.<eos> Have you asked Jacob his opinion?<eos> I would love to be like you, Mr Hereward.<eos> I would love to be young and zealous and full of ideals.<eos> But what happens in St Gideon's is real, and compromised and shabby.<eos> And that can change.<eos> Maybe one day it will.
Don't lose it.<eos> So, do you have plans next Friday night? No.<eos> You having another rally?<eos> No. I would like to have dinner with you.<eos> Would you like to have dinner with me, Max?<eos> Yeah. Sure, yeah.<eos> Got a pen?<eos> Here's my number.<eos> Don't lose it.<eos> I won't.
That is unfortunate.<eos> No, it's not. You're supposed to share your dreams with your friends.<eos> Okay, fine, I'll share.<eos> I do want what you guys have, okay?<eos> Can I jump off this roof now?<eos> Kate, you're gonna have a wedding.<eos> And it's gonna be beautiful.<eos> Yeah, but I don't even have...<eos> I don't know if I'll ever...<eos> You will.
I was at his place for, like, 48 hours...<eos> The most incredible two days of my life.<eos> You slept with sexy smoldering?<eos> You're lagging.<eos> Catch up.<eos> Come on. - So what's next?<eos> - Nothing.<eos> Nothing. He's never calling again.<eos> - Would you stop it?<eos> Yes, he will.
I may carry it but it belongs to your husband.<eos> There's a reason Lorenzo wanted you to have it.<eos> Leo, my boy!<eos> Oh. I'm sorry, Signora.<eos> I won't keep him long but he must come with me at once.<eos> I have something to show you.<eos> Your Grace.<eos> In our conversation last night, we... we found that we both have something of value to offer each other.<eos> Please accept my offer to share my good fortune with Naples and our successes will know no bounds.<eos> Your Grace, will you...?
What do you want to do with her?<eos> We leave her here, she dies of exposure or the Taliban finds her.<eos> And she tells them all about us.<eos> Position, number of men.<eos> We can't leave her alive.<eos> We're not gonna kill a child.<eos> Agent Callen, why don't you ask your partner what we should do.<eos> We'll take her with us.<eos> If she slows us down-- and I want you to understand this-- you're trading her life for Kensi's.<eos> She won't.
On occasion.<eos> Can you describe the visions?<eos> And this... these things in your head, this is a remedy?<eos> Chinese in origin, I believe.<eos> Would you mind waiting while I... while I...<eos> Please.<eos> Be my guest.<eos> Deliver this to the spaniard.<eos> Nobody must know.<eos> Nobody will.
She's all yours.<eos> I've had fun messing with her mind all day.<eos> I know, Stefan, I know.<eos> It's been a rough couple days.<eos> I needed an outlet, ok?<eos> These drugs are... Hardcore.<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> I came to say bye.<eos> I want to see you.<eos> You will.
Yes, I, uh... feel a bath is in order.<eos> Aye, of course.<eos> Well, I hope you'll join us for Samhain tomorrow night.<eos> What, the pagan festival?<eos> Reverend Wakefield, you do astonish me.<eos> Well, I love a good ghost story as much as the next fellow.<eos> Right.<eos> Take your time, darling.<eos> But do try to get home before the storm breaks.<eos> I will.
You erase them.<eos> So, yes, I am asking you to help me kill your brother.<eos> You keep saying kill, but you're immortal.<eos> You can't be killed.<eos> Oh, but we can, luv, and my father was the only one with the means to do it...<eos> A white oak stake fashioned by my father to take from us the very thing he forced upon us all...<eos> Our immortality.<eos> Stand with me or fall with him.<eos> Choose, son.<eos> I will always...
Except security in the file room is so old school, You need a key card to get in, which, even if you had, You wouldn't know where to start looking for the file.<eos> An assistant da would.<eos> You said you needed my help.<eos> Now I need yours.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You.<eos> You know what I really miss about being home?<eos> My bed.<eos> I don't know if I even remember what a bed feels like anymore.<eos> And you probably never will.
My condolences, Dr. Thackery.<eos> Dr. Christiansen's untimely passing has brought added strain to The Knickerbocker.<eos> Aside from the public disaster it presents, it further hampers our efforts at financial solidity.<eos> As you can see, gentlemen, in the published reports in front of you, monthly costs have increased.<eos> This is due in part to the recent renovations in the men's and women's wards.<eos> The hospital is now running at a deficit of nearly $30,000 a year.<eos> Now, in light of this, I've taken the liberty of postponing the much-needed repairs in the courtyard.<eos> Now, Dr. Thackery, as you were Dr. Christiansen's Deputy Chief of Surgery, the board would like you to step into his position as Chief.<eos> We'd be grateful if you'd accept.<eos> I will, though with great regret.
Just by bringing us here, my brother and I are already dead.<eos> We're just about the only people who can help you now.<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea who you're dealing with.<eos> You people are amateurs compared to him.<eos> Who?<eos> Give us a name.<eos> He will bury you.<eos> Well, we'll see about that.<eos> Yeah, you will.
- What? How?<eos> - The state department secretly moved up his extradition... a day early, just after they received the demand video.<eos> Small-minded, fear-driven bureaucrats.<eos> The Russian ambassador's plane is set to depart from Burbank Airport right now.<eos> Mr. Ambassador, I'm asking for your cooperation.<eos> If Torbin Salvi succeeds, these chickens will only be coming back to Russia to roost.<eos> Yes, but here I have my chicken in hand.<eos> Dominik Salvi is personally responsible... for the deaths of hundreds of innocent Russians.<eos> My country deserves to see him pay.<eos> And they will.
Is that why you're here?<eos> Because of Henry Rivers?<eos> Hey, I got to take care of something.<eos> You want to meet up later?<eos> Yeah. I got to meet this lawyer.<eos> - So I'll call you after.<eos> - All right, cool.<eos> I'll buy the coffee, but I want you to do all the talking.<eos> I want to know what's going on.<eos> You will.
Well, I'm assuming that it's not an accident, our meeting in a hotel in Alton, Illinois, a half-hour outside of town.<eos> Freud probably said it best.<eos> There are no accidents.<eos> Then we're of the same mind.<eos> I think we are.<eos> And I think it's good that we clear this up.<eos> Anyway, uh, I imagine it's a difficult time.<eos> Ethan must be taking the breakup badly.<eos> He can't understand it.<eos> Well, he will...
It sounded like a bomb.<eos> Sounds like a damn war.<eos> Right there.<eos> What the hell are these people?<eos> They ain't people.<eos> Don't.<eos> Let him turn.<eos> Cross any of these people, you kill them.<eos> Don't hesitate.<eos> They won't.
I'm really full.<eos> I'm gonna go get out of these clothes.<eos> No, I want to show you the clock first.<eos> - Monroe...<eos> - It'll only take a second.<eos> - It's really nice.<eos> - No, you got to watch it work.<eos> Now, make sure you listen to the tone of the cuckoo on this one.<eos> Ready.<eos> Will you...
No, I want to show you the clock first.<eos> - Monroe...<eos> - It'll only take a second.<eos> - It's really nice.<eos> - No, you got to watch it work.<eos> Now, make sure you listen to the tone of the cuckoo on this one.<eos> Ready.<eos> Will you...<eos> Marry me?<eos> Will you?
Ah, before my time.<eos> She's... She's being cheeky again.<eos> She's knows the Dyad was built on vaccines.<eos> - Yes, polio, Spanish influenza...<eos> - Manufactured right here, shipped all over the world, and millions of lives saved.<eos> Oh, so this is where you keep the clones.<eos> Ah, obviously you're part of a high-security program.<eos> Yeah, most restricted projects are entirely compartmentalized.<eos> Right, so smart people don't know what they're actually working on.<eos> Ah, but you will.
And that's what I did.<eos> Good.<eos> I'm glad you did.<eos> Now, when that happened, were you able to scratch his face or... ?<eos> It got my thumbnail inside his eye, his right eye... deep.<eos> He screamed, and he fell off of me, and... and that's when I ran.<eos> You have been amazing.<eos> He didn't break me.<eos> I want him to know that.<eos> He will.
I doubt if my newbie abilities banished him for good.<eos> But maybe at least Remy can get a good night's sleep for once.<eos> You did good out there.<eos> I'm just glad I could do something.<eos> You know, I was thinking about what Price said.<eos> There's lots of books out there, but... this story, it hasn't been written yet.<eos> Caleb.<eos> Looks like Olivia's audio file is a dead end.<eos> I hope she gets some answers.<eos> She will.
I believe in second chances. Mm-hm.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Hey, Leticia, it's Norman.<eos> Yeah. Hey, I know you have your people out looking for my niece, but I was hoping you could help me out with another matter.<eos> Well, right away, if you could.<eos> You two are the most prosperous people I seen tonight.<eos> God's been good to you.<eos> You can throw a little bit of something my way?<eos> I hope you motherfuckers die of cancer!<eos> 'Cause you will.
I just wish I could skip the part where I don't know the right thing to do and get to the part where I do.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Water?<eos> My kingdom for a lobe, amigo.<eos> My kingdom for a lobe.<eos> Didn't expect to see you again.<eos> Do you know how many nights I laid awake, year after year wondering where you were, if you ever thought about me?<eos> Did you? Ever? No.<eos> I will now, though.
Sorry.<eos> For what?<eos> For not telling you how I really feel.<eos> Time to choose, Oliver, who lives and who dies.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Whoever did this to her is going to suffer.<eos> You cannot die until you have known... Complete despair.<eos> And you will.
Money.<eos> [Answering machine]: Hi. You've reached Jennifer.<eos> Leave me a message.<eos> Stuart: Hey.<eos> It's me.<eos> I've made a lot of mistakes, so... I understand why you're not here.<eos> I just want you to know I don't blame you.<eos> This is on me.<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> I always will.
Dash, your computer, those e-mails from Kyle Hutton!<eos> They're gone.<eos> I wiped the hard drive.<eos> It's totally clean.<eos> The... the thing is...<eos> I need you to know that no matter what happens, I'll keep you out of it.<eos> You can't keep me out of it, Dash.<eos> I helped you.<eos> No one knows that.<eos> And no one ever will.
- Me, too.<eos> - Could I, uh, invite Maya to our booth?<eos> Yeah, if you want to have sex with her, sure.<eos> Oh, so there's movement, movement, movement.<eos> No way!<eos> Nice try, Fedora.<eos> We got numbers, bro.<eos> - Nicely done. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Be good to her.<eos> Oh, we will.
- You have a chance to be free now.<eos> - No, Drake.<eos> - You need to take it.<eos> I can come and go, but you will always be trapped in the Sector, and you know I'm right.<eos> And when things calm down, I'll come find you in Eljida.<eos> But that's not gonna happen unless you leave tonight.<eos> You were so small when they took you from me.<eos> And now I...<eos> I can't lose you again.<eos> You won't.
Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Kendall, what are you doing here?<eos> I let myself go.<eos> So, you're home.<eos> ى.<eos> So, you do however, the "night games"?<eos> It depends. He's coming?<eos> No, it will not.
You've got almost 95 percent function now.<eos> That's better than the doctors even hoped.<eos> But if I'm gonna play piano, though, I need 100 percent.<eos> So I'd like to give it a shot.<eos> - So we agreed?<eos> You're good?<eos> - Yeah. It's the right call.<eos> - I'll let Brandon know. - Ok.<eos> Oh, and tell him if he wants to come by, that, you know, I'm here.<eos> - I will. - Ok.
♪ You want to take him back ♪<eos> So, I'm sorry for how I've been acting lately.<eos> I know you've got these plans for us, and...<eos> Me going out on Luke's tour is messing that up.<eos> But, uh... I don't want you to have any more doubts about our relationship.<eos> ♪ 'Cause he ain't gonna change ♪<eos> ♪ He ain't gonna change ♪<eos> Layla Grant... ♪ I love that boy... ♪<eos> ♪ He ain't gonna change [chuckles]<eos> [Voice breaking] Hell yeah, I will!
Let her through.<eos> Well, if he didn't hate us before, he does now.<eos> Who cares?<eos> How's Finn?<eos> Alive.<eos> His people will care.<eos> How long until they figure out where he is?<eos> And what happens when they do?<eos> I mean, when they come looking for him?<eos> They will, Bellamy.
There it is, then.<eos> A love you couldn't conceive saved by an act you would never have imagined - a certain symmetry.<eos> Yes.<eos> So?<eos> Yes.<eos> Our driver will collect you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I thought you might need the company.<eos> You will miss her.<eos> Oh, we all will.
Yes.<eos> So?<eos> Yes.<eos> Our driver will collect you.<eos> Hello.<eos> I thought you might need the company.<eos> You will miss her.<eos> Oh, we all will.<eos> Not Mother.<eos> Oh, yes, she will, possibly more than most.
Dude, look, she's saluting us!<eos> Help me caption this.<eos> Bren, let's go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Move!<eos> I owe you so much.<eos> I promise I'll never lie to you again.<eos> Please don't tell mom.<eos> She'll freak out.<eos> I won't.
Apricot cruller for him, powdered sugar for me.<eos> And this morning, I got you a Danish-- it's prune.<eos> Does it ever occur to you that I have patients in actual need, people that are sick, people that are desperate for real help?<eos> So forget the prune.<eos> This is not a joke, Betty.<eos> You will put an end to this shameful charade today.<eos> Because if you don't, I will.<eos> I will tell your husband myself.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
30,918 emergencies.<eos> New York, New York.<eos> It's a wonderful town.<eos> Okay, one more step, and Aaron is home free.<eos> Tell me, so we can get this over with.<eos> I want you to delete them, Sandra-- all of them.<eos> I can't.<eos> Those calls are part of the public record.<eos> They're evidence, confessions, dying words.<eos> I won't.
Then straighten me out...<eos> tell me the truth.<eos> If you want to leave me, do it today...<eos> Don't wait for tomorrow ...because I'm really serious about us.<eos> If you leave me today, I'll handle it but any later... I'll not be able to take it Dev.<eos> Any later...?<eos> I'll not be able to take it, even if you leave me today...<eos> So do you wanna get married?<eos> Will you?<eos> You will!
- Yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Oh, what's that?<eos> - Oh. - (Laughs)<eos> I, uh...<eos> I just stopped in because I wanted to ask you a question about a mirror.<eos> A really special mirror that used to be in the basement here.<eos> Uh, a friend of mine really loved it.<eos> A friend whose pa-chank I'm desperately trying to beat up,<eos> - if you will.
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll find another place.<eos> Can I at least wait until it's dark?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> I got to go to county and talk to Jax.<eos> Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.
I just want the lies to stop.<eos> I know you, Lee Anne.<eos> (Sniffles) You are better than this.<eos> You're better than a man like Terry McCandless.<eos> This isn't you.<eos> This isn't the woman that I know you are inside.<eos> Please, just... stop.<eos> If I win, you'll change your mind.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
Because when I saw her, she seemed back to normal.<eos> What do you think is wrong?<eos> I'm not certain.<eos> Maybe you can get to the bottom of it when I'm out of your hair and Niko is chasing Hoffman's dead-end trail.<eos> It's not a dead end.<eos> She'll find Hoffman.<eos> That wasn't the plan.<eos> The man killed Declan Porter.<eos> You said you wanted your Femme Nikota to taste vengeance.<eos> Well, this way she will...
You're getting old...<eos> When will he marry?<eos> I will marry the one who loves me at least a little bit if not a whole lot.<eos> No chance of you finding someone who will love you.<eos> Wherever you go, you put these conditions.<eos> Or tell us where we can find you a fairy queen we'll go and get her...<eos> So Taru, did she accept your condition?<eos> She will accept Mr. Chaudhary, she will.<eos> Did she call?<eos> She will Nanhe miyan...
I may not look it, but I'm a softie.<eos> I like seeing people getting together.<eos> Yeah, man, I bet you do.<eos> I got a theory about you.<eos> You keep going on about this no fraternization business... but I think maybe you just want me to keep my grubby hands off the girl you're sweet on.<eos> You'd better tell me, amigo.<eos> Don't want our swords crossing by accident.<eos> Heh. I'm just messing with you, because I already know who she is.<eos> - Yeah, keep talking, Tex.<eos> - All right, I will.
- It's okay.<eos> Something hit me when I woke up this morning.<eos> That feeling that he's out there somewhere...<eos> It's gone.<eos> Arliss is dead.<eos> I know that now.<eos> But...<eos> What?<eos> Bailiff: Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God?<eos> I will.
Think you can play me for a fool?<eos> You must be drunk.<eos> Place your bets.<eos> $1,000 to start.<eos> I'll raise that.<eos> I bet my head and money that you have a 10 pair.<eos> I bet my head and money there's a card in her panty.<eos> Show your ass and take it all if you can.<eos> What will you bet?<eos> What if I won't?
Yes, they've been killing women for decades at La Chimére.<eos> They use them to have babies so that they can kill the babies for their blood because they need the blood of the innocents in order for them to stay young.<eos> That's how they stay young.<eos> They've stayed young.<eos> It makes complete sense.<eos> Complete sense the whole time, and they want my child.<eos> - Nobody is going to touch your baby.<eos> - No, they're not gonna have my baby.<eos> No, I promise you.<eos> They will not.
- Woodhouse?<eos> - Mum.<eos> If I see this glass empty again, I will be very<eos> - unhappy.<eos> - Perish the<eos> - thought, mum.<eos> - Now, then.<eos> Who'd like to go first?<eos> No?<eos> All right, then I will.
- Had there been a sequel.<eos> - God forbid. - Right?<eos> - And as for who's the<eos> - hot one...<eos> - Wait, what, of us? I'm the hot one!<eos> - Eh... - Oh, my God. - Oh, get over<eos> - yourself! - Shh!<eos> Will you shut up?<eos> - Oh, please. She knows we're in here.<eos> - She will if you
Gary?<eos> He's really leaving.<eos> Hey, Barney.<eos> You still, uh, have my wedding ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I've got some work to do.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Blauman will cool off eventually.<eos> We'll see him again.<eos> Of course we will.
A little cold, but I'm OK.<eos> Really?<eos> And you get prettier all the time!<eos> Nice of you.<eos> - See you later?<eos> - All right.<eos> Stings, huh?<eos> A little, yeah.<eos> You got to chill with the germ thing.<eos> I will.
You wanna eat or work first?<eos> You really think Lobos only meets his distributor twice a year?<eos> I was thinking we should take another look at the Federales' records.<eos> What?<eos> You're inspiring a third option.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Frankie warned me to stay focused.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - We should work.<eos> Mm-hmm. We will. After.
I know.<eos> - But I'm right here.<eos> - Charlie, I need you to be quiet.<eos> Maggie, every time she breathes, that lung is in the way.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Baumann, I need you to lower her respiratory rate.<eos> I need B.P. on the minute.<eos> I feel like there's somewhere else I need to be.<eos> - Don't forget the piñata.<eos> - I won't.
Daddy.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> [ stake plunges ] [ grunts ] [ gasps ]<eos> [ crying ]<eos> Technically, it's only $26 million, But carlos doesn't need to know that.<eos> Are you certain about using the real thing?<eos> Trust me -- first thing carlito's gonna do is check.<eos> The plan's gonna work.<eos> You just got to make sure your girls know what to do.<eos> They will.
Trotsky.<eos> Ah, there it is.<eos> But he's got a wife who never wears a bra.<eos> I think you're gonna like it.<eos> Thanks for dressing up, by the way.<eos> (jake) all right, back to this plate.<eos> I think you could use it for a variety of things.<eos> New item up there.<eos> How much you guys Wanna pay for me to stick my socks In this moron's mouth?<eos> I will.
!<eos> Let's just wait until we get all the facts...<eos> She's screwing him!<eos> Okay, would you just take a breath for a second?<eos> This one doesn't even have a card!<eos> How is April supposed to return her gift if we can't even manage to keep the gifts with the card?<eos> Okay, we'll find the cards. Arizona!<eos> Stop.<eos> - We will fix it.<eos> - No! We won't!
Other than me and Killian.<eos> Hey, what about after you?<eos> I'm tracking a breakout who can kill.<eos> Maybe Ultra rebooted the project.<eos> What does your boss say?<eos> Jedikiah denies knowing anything about it.<eos> - Which he would in any event.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> So how will I know what I'm up against.<eos> You won't.
You guys might be the ones to make it work.<eos> Uh, wait.<eos> What do you mean, "we might be the ones"?<eos> Honey, look, the thing about long-distance relationships is that sometimes they... Never work.<eos> - Never? !<eos> - Well, look, Lennox.<eos> Everybody plans on staying with their high school sweetheart, but then the next thing you know, you're at college and the older guys ask you to this really cool party, and the next thing you know, you're upside down.<eos> Then the rest of the freshman year, everybody's calling you the Keg Queen.<eos> Aunt Mel, I don't think I'll ever be Keg Queen.<eos> Well, not with that attitude you won't.
It's absolutely perfect.<eos> Are you sure it's not too much?<eos> No, I want to look hot.<eos> Haven't you ever been to a wedding?<eos> It's a great place to meet men.<eos> I'm sorry I'm late.<eos> What do you think, Daddy?<eos> - You look like a slut.<eos> - Awesome, I'll take it.<eos> No, she won't.
If the Skwerkel lady is your sister, then... why were you protesting?<eos> My family is complicated.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> Maybe not, but I'd like to try.<eos> My sister is being groomed to take over the company once my dad retires.<eos> Your dad is the head of Skwerkel?<eos> Yep, he founded it.<eos> Shane is the only other person who knows.<eos> So please do not tell anyone.<eos> I won't.
That's over.<eos> We have to deal with that later.<eos> Right now, we have to protect the family.<eos> The only way we're gonna survive is we take out the leaders of the Metas before they know what hit them.<eos> You're talking about starting a war that we can't win.<eos> We can.<eos> But we have to strike first.<eos> A simultaneous attack here, in Mexico, and on El Mozo in prison.<eos> We don't have the firepower or manpower to do that.<eos> We will.
It's my dad.<eos> She gonna be okay?<eos> Be careful out there, Max.<eos> The streets are crawling with ISI.<eos> And you're without official cover.<eos> What about the embassy?<eos> Totally in the dark.<eos> Langley?<eos> Langley knows, but they can't help you out if you get in trouble.<eos> Then we won't.
Have I not hurt people in the name of Korban?<eos> But you channeled the spirit.<eos> That's completely different.<eos> We're not monsters.<eos> You and I, we have faith.<eos> My faith has evolved.<eos> I am evolving.<eos> So should you.<eos> Ok, Micah.<eos> I will.
Hmm? Why, when I was in the seventh grade, I joined the choir just so I could sit next to Ella-Jean Swain.<eos> It is possible that I may have let Cupid's arrow talk me out of any number of tickets.<eos> - I sent 150 postcards to Kerry Washington and flowers on her birthday.<eos> All returned.<eos> Mm. Mayor Hayes, we, the Owls, stand by you.<eos> All those in favor of moving forward with the Mayoral Toast and Roast, let me hear you hoot.<eos> Belles, I understand there are some among you that may take issue with my new boyfriend.<eos> It is true that Davis Polk is a Gainey, but he is also a wonderful and honest man.<eos> That said, if you feel the need to censure me or even ask for my resignation as Belle co-leader, I will not object.<eos> Well, I will.
- all tense and shit.<eos> Now, Mexico?<eos> - Huh. Mexico.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Took care of business.<eos> - Let's have a drink, man, toast our goodbye.<eos> - Well, I only drink with people that I like or I pretend to like, but I will indulge in one of these cigarettes.<eos> - Shit, I didn't even know you smoked.<eos> - Well, there's a lot of things you don't know about me, Darryl Crowe Jr.<eos> - And you never will. - Ha!
- Congratulations.<eos> Couldn't have done it without a great and very patient S.O.<eos> Yeah, you could have.<eos> I'm no Clairvoyant, but I do believe some things are meant to be.<eos> Don't say I never gave you anything.<eos> They're coming for me.<eos> It's time we finally meet.<eos> Can't say I'm a fan... of this double-blind situation.<eos> How will the field teams meet us at the destinations?<eos> They won't.
I got my ticket out of this place, Luke.<eos> Soon as I'm pregnant, I am going to be one of the most famous people on the planet.<eos> Well, doesn't mean you couldn't come back here, right?<eos> I mean, look, I know I don't say this too much, but you and me...<eos> We're a pretty good couple.<eos> Yeah, but there's a big world out there.<eos> I want to see it, you know?<eos> I want to be part of it.<eos> What if you lose?<eos> I won't.
How are his eyes?<eos> Are they open?<eos> Yes, but he... he's having a hard time seeing.<eos> Some things are blurry.<eos> He needs water... As much as you can give him.<eos> He's not responding. I need to call an ambulance.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - I'm not a doctor, Kyle.<eos> - I can't just let him die.<eos> - He won't.
That's very sweet. I'm just gonna eat this first, thanks.<eos> I didn't eat lunch and my stomach's not...<eos> You should eat, of course!<eos> Listen, I know how important...<eos> I might need you to do this, later, if you don't mind<eos> I will, absolutely, absolutely.<eos> I'm like so stressed...<eos> I know how important this broadcast deal is to you.<eos> We have to get it today.<eos> We will!
Anyone could have acquired a sample and analyzed it.<eos> There is no evidence they're linked with Liber8.<eos> Actually, there is.<eos> Your daughter.<eos> What about her?<eos> She's embedded at Gautuma.<eos> It appears Liber8 placed her there.<eos> They will make a move sooner or later.<eos> What if pulling her out tips them off?<eos> It won't.
Fine.<eos> I'll make it easy for you.<eos> We don't mean anything to each other, not anymore, 'cause we're done!<eos> That is not what I want.<eos> - Oh, screw it! - Alex!<eos> Are you okay?<eos> How was that?<eos> Alarmingly convincing.<eos> Just stop freaking out, okay?<eos> Now I will.
No.<eos> I made that mistake once before, and I'm not about to make it again.<eos> It's men like Kingston Tanner that preach nothing but-- but lies.<eos> You know, religion is responsible for far more bloodshed than I could ever be.<eos> It's only good for one thing-- power, and death is its-- is its greatest ally.<eos> But why choose Kingston Tanner as your target?<eos> Oh, no, no.<eos> No. He chose me.<eos> He's been taking my name in vain to increase his coffers, so I thought it best to teach the man a lesson and show the world what religion truly represents.<eos> And we will.
Where did you get that?<eos> Oh, I bet you'd like to know.<eos> Just get the hell away from me, all right?<eos> I never want to see you... or hear you or talk to you.<eos> I swear to God.<eos> Discharge on 27?<eos> Uh, that is correct.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Discharged with further investigation in case we find any additional holes in your alibi.<eos> You won't.
But maybe he'd treat me like an adult.'<eos> I've, um...<eos> I've got a scan on Monday.<eos> Karim's starting his evening shift so he can't come.<eos> I just want someone to be there.<eos> I don't feel very well.<eos> I'm just a little bit worried.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> 'Course I will.
You look like shit.<eos> I can't go to a regular hospital.<eos> Too many fucking questions to answer.<eos> Gracias.<eos> Can we talk alone?<eos> They already patted me down, took my gat.<eos> Nice of you to visit.<eos> Where's Ghost?<eos> She won't let me fuck her in the ass.<eos> Her sister will, though.
If she can prove it, I'll come and find you.<eos> And if she can't?<eos> I'll find Vernon Greg.<eos> And then what?<eos> I'll kill him.<eos> You'd hang.<eos> Go to Lancaster.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> Yes, you do.<eos> And I never will.
And you're coming to work with us.<eos> John, no-one speaks to us as it is.<eos> They'll be gone soon and we'll still be here.<eos> They're the past.<eos> We're the future.<eos> I won't do it.<eos> You'll do as you're told while you're under my roof.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll go, then.<eos> No, no, you won't!
I know sometimes I put our family second to...<eos> What?<eos> The family of man?<eos> You do understand, don't you?<eos> Our son is alive.<eos> And Esther's isn't.<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Will you wait for me?<eos> I never regretted the day you stopped that cart.<eos> I never will.
And Marjorie...<eos> girl, you're my rock.<eos> You see the good in everything.<eos> Even while you're fighting breast cancer... all you do is think of others.<eos> - I love you, Regina.<eos> - I love you, too.<eos> [sniffs] - Don't you die on me.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Don't you drink.<eos> - I won't.
Couldn't find any takers for Chicago?<eos> Everybody turned me down but Larry.<eos> - Ouch.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Well, cheer up.<eos> You got a new job, new challenges, all that crap you like.<eos> Man, I'm gonna miss Pawnee.<eos> I wish I could stay, you know, keep an eye on it, raise my kids here.<eos> And let's be honest, am I ever gonna find a better breakfast than JJ's Diner?<eos> You will not, no.
Coming in for the landing!<eos> You'll never find love!<eos> Is that how you all feel?<eos> You'd have to read it back to me.<eos> Brett?<eos> Hey, guys, for a penis name, what do you think of Duncan?<eos> It's Scottish for "brown warrior."<eos> Listen, if you had any guts at all, you would try to fix this thing with Sabrina.<eos> But guess what?<eos> You won't.
They're extremely friable, so soft hands.<eos> You're on the right side of the table.<eos> You have one chance, or else you could rip through the aorta, which is essential to connecting the new heart when it arrives.<eos> Nope.<eos> Just take a breath, just throw the stitch.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I've never put a horizontal mattress in an aorta before... only in a bowel.<eos> From this side, I'll just tear through her native aorta.<eos> - Well, what if I tear through it?<eos> - You won't!
Blow, blow, blow, blow, blow.<eos> Okay.<eos> Everything looks good.<eos> I'll call the hospital and let them know we're on our way.<eos> Okay.<eos> - The hospital?<eos> - Yeah, for the MRI.<eos> Tracy, we want to make sure your hamstring is fully healed.<eos> You don't want to reaggravate it.<eos> I won't.
Smokey.<eos> Are you really going to be able to see Smokey with that?<eos> No, but if she didn't get to use it, she wouldn't have helped, being scared of rats and all.<eos> Do you need this much height for pizza? No.<eos> But you do if you also want to roast a chicken.<eos> Nice.<eos> Very interesting dish, pizza.<eos> It's all about harmony.<eos> Different ingredients working together.<eos> A sort of culinary team, if you will.
You're Matthew Kellog.<eos> My reputation precedes me.<eos> I hope that's a good thing.<eos> I know you better than you realize.<eos> I'm not exactly from around here.<eos> You and me both.<eos> That's why I came to you.<eos> I need resources, I need information.<eos> I don't even know you.<eos> You will.
We have access to NSA's complete sat feed history.<eos> That girl's good.<eos> I can see why you like her.<eos> The images are a little patchy, but they're gonna clear up any second.<eos> I guess living on the edge really pays off sometimes.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sometimes.<eos> What if he doesn't show?<eos> Before they put him away, he never missed a rehearsal, right?<eos> - No. - Then he won't this time either.
We need to go right now.<eos> Of course we do.<eos> Lead the way.<eos> Sir?<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> She said I never lied to her.<eos> Today, I did. But she's alive.<eos> And safe. We did that at least.<eos> Why didn't you tell her the truth?<eos> I will.
I've got you, man, okay?<eos> You'll be all right.<eos> Dougal, is it bad?<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> You're gonna be fine.<eos> It wasn't spurting, which meant the femoral artery wasn't cut.<eos> So there was a good chance I could stop the bleeding at the thigh.<eos> Will I lose my leg?<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Are we-have the opinion of May Ghislain?<eos> Forget the opinions, baby.<eos> Do not call me "my dear."<eos> Ghislain, It Has more strength, and I have full authority here.<eos> I'm sour he Would Have-been very sensitive to your charms, order now it's me Who Decides.<eos> You no right to do That.<eos> I have the right!<eos> You have no CDI.<eos> I'll give you your pay and everything is legit.<eos> Will more Courier heart?
You just find a dead possum in here, you don't pick it up?<eos> Come on!<eos> Oh, God. Not dead.<eos> Not dead!<eos> That's fantastic.<eos> You have amazing taste.<eos> Really?<eos> I was worried you'd think it was tacky.<eos> How you gonna get Kenny Loggins?<eos> Oh, we won't.
With Mary?<eos> A private session?<eos> Now he says we're not going to Paris, but straight back to Scotland in the morning, on the first ship.<eos> What, your business unfinished?<eos> How odd.<eos> I wonder what he and Mary spoke about.<eos> No idea, but he was feeling quite singled out about it, it seemed, by the expression on his face.<eos> Favored by the queen.<eos> If only he knew about this.<eos> Of course, he won't.
If Olivia got away, he surely knew we'd be coming.<eos> Maybe that's why he left Rowan's hand.<eos> To draw us out onto the ice.<eos> I'll find him.<eos> I'll see him dead for Rowan and for all his victims.<eos> I promise you.<eos> You can go, assured of that.<eos> You deserve your own life far away from here.<eos> Maybe finally I can find something that's... my own.<eos> You will.
Antonio.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> Hi, honey.<eos> Hey, big guy.<eos> Belden?<eos> Gone.<eos> Those guards?<eos> Both dead.<eos> Find him.<eos> We will.
I'm some... some chump 'cause you want to get Truman's little bitch on your team?<eos> Well, we got a spy in Truman's house now.<eos> And if she convinces other people in town, we got an underground.<eos> Who cares?<eos> We could've used the gas.<eos> We could've taken out a truckload of Patriots.<eos> And anybody else who gets caught in the middle.<eos> You said you wanted to win!<eos> I do.<eos> And I will.
Boy, it's pretty toasty in this car.<eos> You know, this isn't working.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> You're not leaving.<eos> If you don't drive me, I'll take a cab.<eos> Good luck finding one in this neighborhood, especially looking and smelling like you do.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm walking to the car, right now.<eos> I'll leave.<eos> No, you won't.
- What are you talking about?<eos> - That is so beautiful.<eos> - Is that one of yours?<eos> It's Yusef Komunyakaa from his delicate and heart-wrenching poem Jasmine.<eos> Zach's leading a poetry group.<eos> So you teach poetry now?<eos> Teach is an aggressive word.<eos> What I do is I assemble a collective of local wordsmiths the theme of our reading this week is "unfinished business."<eos> You should come.<eos> - I probably won't.
Thank you to Lady Katherine for generously providing Selborne Hall for this event this evening.<eos> Right, good, on we go.<eos> Lights!<eos> Now, then, our zoo.<eos> It's all about the animals, of course.<eos> Um... It's about protecting them and it's about caring for them.<eos> Some of these slides are aspirations.<eos> We don't have a lion or an elephant.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But we will.
And has it?<eos> I didn't do this for me.<eos> I just need you to know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I know.<eos> Avenging a father... is a cause...<eos> This wasn't about my father.<eos> This was about my sister.<eos> I wanted her life... her death to mean something.<eos> It will.
I didn't do this for me.<eos> I just need you to know that.<eos> I do.<eos> I know.<eos> Avenging a father... is a cause...<eos> This wasn't about my father.<eos> This was about my sister.<eos> I wanted her life... her death to mean something.<eos> It will.<eos> It will.
I told you it would work.<eos> Yeah, well, don't get cocky.<eos> If Gabe can prove that we fed old surveillance footage of Vincent into his police monitors, we're both dead.<eos> Working on it.<eos> He'll never know we tricked him.<eos> And just so you know, I never doubted you.<eos> Liar.<eos> Well, I really hope this works.<eos> Just be careful.<eos> I will.
-Oh, just give her my regards.<eos> You like to play with fire, don't you, Mr Shelby?<eos> Yesterday in Belgravia,<eos> Field Marshal Russell's house was burnt out.<eos> An incendiary device was put through his letterbox, which means<eos> that he will have to find somewhere else to live for at least the next three months.<eos> Which also means that your plan, for me to break in and shoot him in his bed, is now no longer an operational possibility.<eos> Indeed. But if you think a wee burn frees you from your obligations, -think again.<eos> -I will keep my side of the bargain.<eos> Oh, by God, you will.
I do, yes.<eos> I'll send your request out to the universe and lay my ear to the cosmic rails, as it were, wait for a reply.<eos> I'd appreciate that.<eos> You think I'm bullshitting, don't you?<eos> On the contrary.<eos> Here's my number.<eos> Give me a call in a few days.<eos> And I'll let you know if I got a lead.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
But the biggest joke of all-- the thing that'll sink ya every time is hope.<eos> Hope that the world will right itself.<eos> That the just will be rewarded and the wicked punished.<eos> Oh, once you buy into that horseshit, you're dead in the water.<eos> The only way to survive in this disgusting godforsaken world is to take control.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna take care of our people but us.<eos> Dell hurt one of our own, we can't let him get away with that.<eos> Can't let... that degenerate prick win.<eos> He's got to pay.<eos> He will, Ma, he will.
You just bought five hundred copies of a magazine you're not even in!<eos> Admit it.<eos> You both wanted to get on that list.<eos> - For him!<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Who?<eos> - Gabi!<eos> At least when Josh fires you, you can add pimp to your resume.<eos> - Why isn't she coming over here?<eos> - Oh, she will.
She made it happen.<eos> With a little help from you.<eos> Actually, she ignored any of my advice.<eos> Oh, well... that is certainly very sad.<eos> Cos if she could smell a rat in you, she certainly was someone to believe in.<eos> What's this?<eos> Should I know?<eos> Should I start talking to IA?<eos> I don't believe we have an IA in the Secret Service...<eos> We will after this.
(Sighs) This is never gonna end.<eos> I don't think you can do that in here, Jenny.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Jenny, listen to me.<eos> This motion is a smoke screen.<eos> They have nothing.<eos> - Then why are they doing it?<eos> - Politics.<eos> - If they win?<eos> - They won't.
Talk about destiny, I'm facing Pepe Muharrem again.<eos> And my dearest Arzu, poor girl, is in seventh heaven over playing with Boğaç Boray.<eos> Look, Zafer.<eos> The actor Arzu deserves By her side is Boğaç Boray.<eos> She is, God bless her, beautiful like the moon.<eos> You should consider it.<eos> "<eos> -He wouldn't accept." "<eos> -Exactly, he wouldn't."<eos> "He won't, brother."
The characters are stupid and the plot's predictable.<eos> This is Sandra's favourite programme, Mum.<eos> It's our favourite programme so if you could just leave it alone...<eos> I didn't crawl out of the grave to spend my time watching rubbish like this.<eos> I wish you'd crawl back.<eos> What?<eos> What did she say to me?<eos> Clive?<eos> !<eos> Sandra, will you...
It's labour we require up at the castle!<eos> Labour and gold, not old men and their worthless baubles.<eos> This will be a great help, Master Quayle, believe me.<eos> Newcomer to Sherwood, are we?<eos> Yes, my Lord.<eos> You may also prove useful.<eos> Bring her.<eos> Your days are numbered, you cur!<eos> You shall live to regret that.<eos> Actually, no... ..you won't.
- Did you miss your flight?<eos> - Come kiss me.<eos> - What's going on?<eos> - Come here.<eos> What?<eos> Are you high?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Amantha Holden, you rule breaker.<eos> Mm. Just don't tell Daggett.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Somebody hurt her.<eos> You were with her.<eos> We got eyewitnesses, son.<eos> I-I was with her, but I left.<eos> Where'd you go?<eos> Wandering.<eos> Can anybody verify that?<eos> You said I could see my father.<eos> That you, honey?<eos> And you will.
What else does it say?<eos> What else are you looking for?<eos> I just feel like there's more to the story.<eos> It's all right here.<eos> FBI tends to be pretty thorough.<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's just...<eos> It's a gut instinct, Nolan.<eos> I can't explain it.<eos> Well, maybe his interview tonight will.
Yes.<eos> See, it ain't me he's scared of.<eos> He's afraid I'll make him see his own true self.<eos> Would you reveal him if you could?<eos> You finally starting' to see he's a fake?<eos> No.<eos> I can't hold that notion.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> You'll be shot, you try to leave.<eos> No, I won't...
Complicated.<eos> (SOFT LAUGH)<eos> I don't know. I thought she was interesting.<eos> But you know what?<eos> After she was killed, the worst thing turned out to be the best thing.<eos> Why?<eos> Because your mother came back into my life and we had you guys.<eos> So what are you saying? I'll get over him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You will.
You ain't never gonna stop them white boys.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> They everywhere.<eos> You just here.<eos> I'd call surviving a victory.<eos> Well, you pretty slick at that.<eos> Gonna keep your word to her?<eos> 'Cause I'm keeping to mine.<eos> How will you know?<eos> I won't.
Yes, of course she did.<eos> But then she came to her senses and left me.<eos> Yeah, well, they do that.<eos> What happened to your husband?<eos> Uh, he... He was a lawyer.<eos> Was in D.C. for a deposition, and decided to go for a run on the hotel treadmill.<eos> And he had a heart attack.<eos> There is a part of him that I still feel.<eos> I just want it to go away.<eos> It won't.
- Just grab the files for me, will you?<eos> - Sure, just as soon as I get the okay from the lead detective and the D.A.<eos> Two signatures, easy-peasy.<eos> That's BPD-2410 and 2413.<eos> - What?<eos> - I need the files now.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Everything is time-stamped.<eos> - Once I get the forms...<eos> - You will.
I think that's best.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Eli?<eos> At least look at me.<eos> What am I supposed to do with myself?<eos> Aren't you done with me telling you?<eos> What are you waiting for anyway?<eos> She won't even open the door.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - She won't.
Our child's first sonogram, Peter.<eos> I just got so wrapped up...<eos> In the case.<eos> The Peter Burke Tunnel Vision.<eos> Let me make this clear.<eos> I am not going to raise our child as a married single mother.<eos> No.<eos> Never.<eos> And he's gonna be the first priority in this family.<eos> He will.
Perhaps we should set loki the pig free.<eos> Seems one's fate can change after all.<eos> But that was just the beginning, a brief moment of happiness.<eos> That is how it always begins.<eos> A butterfly lands upon your finger unaware that it will lead to her tragic end.<eos> Her tragic end came when you drained her body of blood...<eos> All for a spell to smother the wolf within Niklaus, as memory serves.<eos> Actually, Elijah, your memory doesn't serve you at all.<eos> You just don't realize it yet, but by the time we are done here...<eos> You will.
Let's go bigger to smaller.<eos> It's more shocking.<eos> Just dropped Tommy off.<eos> Trust me, he'll be keeping his mouth shut.<eos> Now am I forgiven?<eos> Do I have a choice?<eos> Now you have blackmail on me.<eos> I'm gonna take that as a yes.<eos> You know, I'm not going to tell anyone, Lauren.<eos> None of us will.
Your concern is that I will ruin you if you don't tell me how to find the man that they work for.<eos> Or should I say, the man that you work for.<eos> I have no idea what you're talking about.<eos> And those two just happened to be a couple prospective clients.<eos> My business is none of yours.<eos> Maybe if you dealt with your business, your child wouldn't be dead.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You damn maniac.<eos> Anna, I don't think she's going to answer.<eos> - She will.
But I already know what you did to make it up to me.<eos> Natasha told you?<eos> When?<eos> When she showed up at my place.<eos> Natasha's at your apartment?<eos> Okay. She's wanted by the FBI.<eos> Your apology was sounding a lot better a few seconds ago.<eos> She's a fugitive.<eos> What are you gonna do if she gets discovered?<eos> She won't.
Nah.<eos> But they play Barry Manilow.<eos> No.<eos> But they're called "Fairly Manilow""<eos> Great! No!<eos> Well, what do you want to do?<eos> Well, we're in Vegas.<eos> I want to go downstairs, get a bucket of margaritas, dance until I vomit all over a roulette wheel and watch it go everywhere.<eos> What if we don't want to vomit?<eos> Oh, you will.
- Love.<eos> Love.<eos> Love was what was special.<eos> Love makes everything better.<eos> Unless you're talking about Courtney Love.<eos> That bitch ruins things.<eos> I know you like to take credit for everything, but...<eos> You can't tell Nicki that you... you gave me that move.<eos> But then how's Nicki gonna know that I gave you the move?<eos> She won't.
Mm, no. No transfers.<eos> I want it in cash.<eos> 500 euro notes, please.<eos> And may I see your phone a moment?<eos> Yeah, sure, but, Berta, that's a lot of money.<eos> I mean, it'll be heavy, and you have bad feet.<eos> You shouldn't be carrying it around.<eos> I won't be.<eos> - What are you...<eos> - You will.
I think it could help.<eos> Well, I can tell you that kind of stuff is a lot more fun when you're high.<eos> Taylor's right, don't use me as a role model.<eos> Last time, ma...<eos> Elizabeth made this whole speech to your empty chair.<eos> She described the day she came home and you weren't there.<eos> It sounded pretty... horrible.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure it did.<eos> And how she's afraid she'll have to go through it again.<eos> Will she?
- Mr. Alexei Sergueitch!<eos> - Karp!<eos> - Did you roll my cigarettes?<eos> - No.<eos> And why not?<eos> I gave you an order.<eos> - When I have time.<eos> - You're a braggart.<eos> - I'll tell Madam.<eos> - No, you won't.
How could I turn him down?<eos> I'd need to give him a share and deprive the one I love.<eos> - Don't give him anything.<eos> - Impossible!<eos> Why deny him his share if he's polite?<eos> And if he comes here, penniless, he'd need to be taken care of.<eos> He'll want to move in.<eos> - I couldn't turn him away.<eos> - Tell me to.<eos> I will.
It's this thing in my family.<eos> My mom started it.<eos> I was about 9 years old.<eos> I was heading off to this summer sports camp.<eos> My first time away from home, and she said if the moon was up that I wasn't alone.<eos> 'Cause chances were somebody else in the family was staring at that same moon.<eos> Hmm.<eos> You're worried about your father.<eos> He said he was gonna bring Matt back.<eos> He will.
I know you're there!<eos> Stop watching us!<eos> Leave us alone!<eos> I'm not afraid of you!<eos> I'm not afraid of you!<eos> I should tell you where we're at.<eos> Trust me, I'm up to date.<eos> I'm getting memos every 10 minutes.<eos> - What if Warren finds out ab...<eos> - She won't.
I conspired for and with the Khanate.<eos> And you think, what?<eos> The Khanate does not guide my heart?<eos> Your mind.<eos> But minds can be easily persuaded of anything.<eos> The reason you do not sleep is because of a longing in your heart<eos> - that will never be sated.<eos> - And why should it?<eos> - I know you believe Xiangyang will fall.<eos> - It will.
Can you give me the phone, please?<eos> Ralph occupy yourself with this.<eos> I have a riddle for you to figure out.<eos> You can tell your mom the answer at the end of the day.<eos> So, what kind of punch does a jellyfish like?<eos> You got it? Okay, cool.<eos> All right, hold on one second.<eos> Any dreams you have of him making a team or being in student council, it's just, uh, not gonna happen.<eos> I thought you told me he'd eventually fit in.<eos> No, he will, just not at school.
- I know.<eos> I spoke with her.<eos> I held her in my arms.<eos> You didn't want to let her go.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> I understand.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.
You didn't want to let her go.<eos> Neither did I.<eos> - Where is she?<eos> - She's safe.<eos> I understand.<eos> I think I understand.<eos> But the people of Vega won't.<eos> Well, people don't need to know.<eos> People don't need to know anything, do they?<eos> And they never will.
You need to apologize to him for being such a no-showing-up bitch!<eos> We're sorry we broke your shit.<eos> Okay, good. Nestor, we'll talk about restitution?<eos> Hey. You okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hell were you doing anyway?<eos> Nothing worth talking about.<eos> You still need to make it up to us.<eos> I'll fire your ass, and it won't mean shit to me.<eos> Yes, it will.
Correct.<eos> And then I get hammered.<eos> What if this doesn't work?<eos> You got roughly 45 minutes.<eos> Take your car, get Ralph, drive like hell past the Santa Monica mountains.<eos> Radiation cloud should pool up in the San Fernando Valley basin.<eos> You might be okay.<eos> No one would blame you if you wanted a head start.<eos> If it doesn't work, I'll go get Ralph.<eos> But it will.
You?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's something we need to talk about.<eos> Ok.<eos> - Do you have a fever or something?<eos> - No, you have to look at it.<eos> - But you have to say something.<eos> - There is no...<eos> If you do not want, so we can do something else. I do not know.<eos> No, no. I will not... I will not...
Don't go where your teacher would like to tread.<eos> She's a married woman.<eos> You're to give Agnes her job back.<eos> You told me to get rid of her. Now I'm telling you to bring her back.<eos> I know why you're doing this.<eos> You're using her.<eos> Does it matter?<eos> It were making her ill.<eos> She won't want to come back.<eos> She will.
For all I know, that's why it didn't work out for him up there and it's...<eos> The least I can do, is comfort him when he's down.<eos> Go.<eos> Come in, come in.<eos> What are you doin' here?<eos> Stuff has been sitting on your desk for days.<eos> I wanted you to have it.<eos> Okay. I'll need it for my new office.<eos> You got a job?<eos> - Not yet, but I will.
You sure it was them found?<eos> I can take you to them when the time comes.<eos> Thank you, Mrs. Loving.<eos> Be an end to the waiting.<eos> Have you seen my girls, Mrs. Briggs?<eos> Dressed like boys, maybe?<eos> Looking to be fed?<eos> If you see 'em, tell 'em to stay.<eos> Your luck's a marvel, Jack.<eos> Will you, uh...
Washington has repeatedly exploited Pakistan and interfered in our affairs.<eos> No self-respecting state can accept such dictates, not even from a superpower.<eos> It's a stain on our honor.<eos> If they want to break relations with us,<eos> I say good riddance.<eos> A career official in the Foreign Ministry,<eos> Tasneem Qureishi has emerged in the last few days as a leading...<eos> Hey. You're gonna drive yourself crazy.<eos> I wish it would just happen already.<eos> Maybe it never will.
You'll become an ATV... All-terrain vehicle.<eos> You hit a bump?<eos> Bam!<eos> It jostles you, but you'll be okay because you'll have all these really stunning features, dual joint suspension, a reinforced steel frame...<eos> It should be noted that the parish recently gave Father Ortega a pep talk about making himself more accessible to youth.<eos> See?<eos> Just because I'm a priest doesn't mean I don't get it.<eos> That was a line they suggested he use.<eos> The point is, things will get difficult over the course of your marriage.<eos> They just will.
He's gone out.<eos> He won't be back before ten. ~ Thank you.<eos> I think I've got an idea.<eos> Do you think Lard Mary would mind annoying Lord Sinderby?<eos> ~ None of our lot would mind.<eos> ~ Will you help me?<eos> I suppose so, seeing as it's what Lady Mary's asked for.<eos> ~ Then there's your answer.<eos> ~ I don't understand.<eos> You will.
The one thing I do know for sure is you are my princess.<eos> And I am the luckiest nobody in the world.<eos> Sure, we were far from royalty or Rock Gods, but that night, my mom felt like a queen.<eos> - Listen, about what I said.<eos> - No.<eos> It's fine. I get it.<eos> You don't feel the same way about me.<eos> But I'll win you over.<eos> No, you won't.<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Yeah.<eos> Go upstairs.<eos> Watch the rear.<eos> I'll take the lower level.<eos> You three, take the front gate.<eos> That's the plan.<eos> All right?<eos> Hey. We got this.<eos> May we meet again.<eos> We will.
Walter called.<eos> Said you weren't gonna play.<eos> First time in 15 years, huh?<eos> I took it apart to clean it like I always do, but when it came time to put it back together,<eos> I just... couldn't.<eos> I'm like that.<eos> In pieces.<eos> You find whoever killed Calvin?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I will.
You've experienced something like that,<eos> - with your Morgan?<eos> - I believe so.<eos> And instances of longer intensity.<eos> You are an innocent, Mrs. Blithely.<eos> You watch I don't catch and I'll school you in pleasure.<eos> Your husband...<eos> I'll hold him.<eos> What if you fall off?<eos> I won't.
Angelo...<eos> Wehavetogonow.<eos> Please.<eos> Ciao, amico!<eos> is he straight?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> Passed my test.<eos> Will you have him?<eos> I can, but I don't have to.<eos> Then you won't.
So you ready to see the system in action?<eos> Ready.<eos> All right.<eos> Hand over your ring.<eos> What?<eos> Your ring.<eos> Ohh! Stefan Cooper, what are you doing?<eos> We've known each other for a very long time now, and you've always been my best friend.<eos> I have always loved you, and I want to spend the rest of my life with you.<eos> - Will you--
That's not good.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> And that's not the worst of it.<eos> The analysis of the painting came back... it is 500 years old.<eos> But the alien writing on the back... brand-new.<eos> So that means someone is out there,<eos> - carving right now, someone...<eos> - Someone like me.<eos> - We'll have to find him.<eos> - We will.
- Mm-mm.<eos> - It's my only copy, but trust me, it's highly true.<eos> You need to nip this in the bud.<eos> Tonight, you sit this so-called roommate down and you say, "Hey, man, I was in the shit while you were at home watching telly.<eos> If my nightmares are too scary for you, maybe you need to pay for my meds!"<eos> - Damn straight.<eos> - Yeah, you tell<eos> - him that.<eos> - I will tell him that.<eos> I will!
Hmm? What?<eos> It's a long story.<eos> What's this?<eos> Oliver helped me put that in while you guys were at the hospital.<eos> Wait, this is for me?<eos> For the next time you're in town.<eos> There'll be a next time?<eos> I'm still calling the shots.<eos> We'll talk about that.<eos> Yes, we will.
A good boy?<eos> Really?<eos> Really?<eos> Very good?<eos> You're a good boy, huh?<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Not bad?<eos> Come here.<eos> Stop it!<eos> No, I won't.
But you know I can...<eos> I can see you right now.<eos> I got to... um... there's a... [Receiver clicks] [Chuckles]<eos> - [Stephie moans] - [Clatter] [Clearing throat]<eos> Uh, Stephie, I...<eos> Hmm? You have something on your face, I believe.<eos> - It is our client. - Mm-hmm.<eos> Um, thank you, Frank.<eos> That will be all for today.<eos> And I will, um...
And I must apologize for Melissa.<eos> Xiomara, I owe her a lot and I tend to look the other way when she's possessive.<eos> But I won't do that.<eos> Not with you.<eos> You're too important to me.<eos> In a short time, you have become too important.<eos> We can't.<eos> You have to focus on your relationship with Jane, and I'll only get in the way.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Sometimes it's off a few inches.<eos> Sometimes more.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> If you're looking for sense, You stumbled down the wrong rabbit hole.<eos> Easy, mate.<eos> Even I'm not ready for that one yet.<eos> I think what Chas meant was, um, Don't go wandering around here without a chaperone, all right?<eos> Right.<eos> Each one of these stigmata represents A place where something bad is going down.<eos> Supernatural brushfires, if you will.
Henry is a child.<eos> There's a big difference.<eos> I don't see how the truth harms anyone, adults or children.<eos> Ok, so what am I supposed to tell him if he asks how she--<eos> I gotta go.<eos> It's work.<eos> Go.<eos> We're fine here.<eos> Do not say anything more to Henry about Roz.<eos> I won't.
How would you know what my sister thinks?<eos> You've never even met her.<eos> Well, just from what you've been saying, I-I feel like I know her.<eos> You two were very close.<eos> Something must have pulled you apart... something beyond your control.<eos> But my memories are gone, and no one in this town has even been to Arendelle.<eos> I need to face the truth, Belle.<eos> No one here can help me, and I'm afraid that means I might never see Anna again.<eos> Okay.<eos> You will.
What's happened?<eos> I've come to my senses.<eos> Anna, no!<eos> Oh, this isn't you.<eos> - It can't be.<eos> - I'm afraid it is.<eos> Ingrid, you're not... in an urn.<eos> No.<eos> Fortunately, I have a chance to show you that I am the only one who will ever understand you.<eos> Anna never will.
And they hired you for that?<eos> They hired me for my ability to predict things. That many people think aren't subject to prediction.<eos> Are you saying you can predict things about the returned?<eos> When it will happen again, how many will come, How long before they'll disappear.<eos> Everything in nature follows a pattern. And is therefore subject to prediction.<eos> How do you define nature?<eos> Definitions change, but numbers are perfect.<eos> Numbers don't lie.<eos> You really don't know anything, do you?<eos> We will.
I know.<eos> It's exciting, isn't it?<eos> I mean, both sides racing to the temple, life and death, flesh and blood, emotions!<eos> Who knows how it'll shake out?<eos> All I know is, my baby's gonna be right there in the center of it.<eos> - I know you want to meet her.<eos> - Oh, I can't wait.<eos> I mean, I have to wait for the right circumstances, but...<eos> 'Cause if you let this man die,<eos> - Skye will never...
Okay, Happy, see if you can get any gas out of that tractor.<eos> Paige... find her something to collect it in.<eos> You got time to fill me in?<eos> The farm was built in the '20s.<eos> Means old knob and tube wiring, so no grounding conductor.<eos> Now, if I target concentrated micro-frequency waves-- which this remote emits-- to the second floor circuit breaker, then I can cause it to short out.<eos> But I will need an accelerant.<eos> Which I almost have for you.<eos> Even if we get a fire going to flush them out, they have guns.<eos> Then so will we.
- Yes, Mom.<eos> I don't want to see you hurt.<eos> All I want is distance.<eos> You were wrong.<eos> I'm not alone.<eos> I have David.<eos> Even after he reunited with Emily.<eos> You keep waiting for blowback, but it hasn't happened.<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It won't.
- And he's finally waking. - Hey.<eos> Look, I know that we were under the Snow Queen's curse, but...<eos> We were under a curse.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Henry got away.<eos> So you failed.<eos> At kidnapping a child.<eos> Well, perhaps you could say my heart wasn't in it.<eos> The Snow Queen's plan also failed.<eos> But mine won't.
Ever wonder why I got picked?<eos> Why do I come back and not other people?<eos> It seems like whoever's making the decisions up there has got some kind of suck-ass criteria.<eos> Do you know why we came back?<eos> I do.<eos> Why?<eos> To be punished for our sins.<eos> I thought it was a second chance.<eos> I thought it could work.<eos> Oh, it never will.
- Let me guess.<eos> They're going to use the rumors that I'm secretly gay to make it seem like I can't be trusted.<eos> Yes.<eos> It'll be effective and probably cost me... five points.<eos> I have the same oppo research on you.<eos> My handlers want to wait until you use the courtroom shooting to humanize yourself and then we'll leak that you were, in fact, sleeping with your boss.<eos> - Is that a threat?<eos> - No.<eos> I told you I won't go negative, Alicia.<eos> - And I won't.
She would never come forward on her own, but... I'm her mother and when I saw the bruising...<eos> Well, I had no choice but to report it to you.<eos> My little girl is being terrorized.<eos> - She's just seven years old.<eos> - You're doing the right thing.<eos> No child deserves to be treated like that.<eos> I just want it to stop.<eos> And it will.
No?<eos> You're a thief, aren't you?<eos> Let's see how good you are.<eos> A challenge.<eos> Bodies are so much bulkier than jewels.<eos> And yet you seemed right at home.<eos> I guess once a thief, always a thief.<eos> I'll take that as a compliment.<eos> So, have you thought of a plan when they discover her remains are missing?<eos> They won't.
Does stupidity run in your family?<eos> I'll take that as your blessing.<eos> Do you realize by the end of the week, We could both be back home, sleeping in our own beds, Getting our real lives back?<eos> I know.<eos> It's all happening so quickly.<eos> [ siren wails ] you're not psyched?<eos> No, i am.<eos> I'm just still processing.<eos> And i don't want to get my hopes up In case there's a chance that i don't get out, so --<eos> You will.
My physical therapist says it's the secret to my success.<eos> Hey, you okay?<eos> Yes.<eos> Really?<eos> What aren't you telling me?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Emma, we're not gonna break up when we get out of here.<eos> I mean, it could happen.<eos> No, it won't.
Let me go.<eos> He killed my boy, and I can't let him get away with it.<eos> What about your daughter?<eos> The police are here to arrest Bud.<eos> This gig is his last.<eos> You still have time to be Ella's father.<eos> I was gone half her life.<eos> She's never gonna speak to me again.<eos> We know why you wrote "6 A.M."<eos> Now she will, too.
It's complicated.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Probably.<eos> But... the answer is simple.<eos> Get out of there.<eos> Do you know what the British say?<eos> - Do you think it's my fault?<eos> - That's not what I said.<eos> What I say is that it's also your responsibility to make it stop.<eos> Because, clearly, he won't.
He's my husband.<eos> Where am I?<eos> You were asleep.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> No, it's true.<eos> You were snoring away like a champion.<eos> Will I remember this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I hope so.<eos> I will.
You did a lot of good stuff for my kids when I wasn't there for them, and I never thanked you.<eos> So... thank you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, is this one of those amends things?<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Cool, I've never gotten one of those.<eos> Bring it in.<eos> Bring it in, come on.<eos> I'm just scared that now that you have a beautiful house and a pool and this great new life that Roscoe will never want to come back to my place.<eos> Of course he will.
Of course, of course, anything.<eos> Okay, so go to my house, and in the backyard there's a key in the magnet box by the pool filter.<eos> Take the key and go in the back door.<eos> The alarm code is 4242.<eos> Go up to the bedroom.<eos> On the bed is a letter.<eos> And it's addressed to Michael.<eos> Take it home and save it for me when I get back.<eos> But listen, promise me that you won't read it.<eos> Of course I won't, Brooke.
I never will.<eos> Never.<eos> You're not even here right now.<eos> You're dead.<eos> You blew your brains out.<eos> Stuck your gun in your mouth and you blew your brains out.<eos> I had my reasons.<eos> There was no way out. I hate you!<eos> You swore you'd always love me.<eos> And I always will.
What are we here to do?<eos> Find how to tell her.<eos> The watch.<eos> The watch.<eos> That's it.<eos> We code the data into the movement of the second hand.<eos> TARS, translate the data into Morse and feed it to me.<eos> Translating data to Morse.<eos> Cooper, what if she never came back for it?<eos> She will.

You wanna go with me?<eos> To meet your parents?<eos> It's just dinner and drinks.<eos> You, uh...<eos> You sure I'm relationship material?<eos> You know what?<eos> It's...<eos> It's actually gonna be really boring.<eos> - Probably better if you don't.<eos> Of course I will.
I mean for Scare students who actually, you know, have a chance.<eos> Aw, snap!<eos> My chances are just as good as yours.<eos> You're not even in the same league with me.<eos> Just wait, hotshot.<eos> I'm going to scare circles around you this year.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You will.
But you're stubborn.<eos> You don't listen.<eos> If you don't want do listen, then stop listening.<eos> You know who he is?<eos> Want to fight?<eos> When I was pregnant with you it was strange.<eos> They wanted me to terminate but I wouldn't.<eos> And you're right.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> And I never will.
It was the lark, the herald of the morn.<eos> No nightingale.<eos> Look, love, what envious streaks do lace the severing clouds in yonder east.<eos> Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.<eos> I must be gone and live, or stay and die.<eos> I do not think the light is daylight yet.<eos> I am content if you would have it so.<eos> I have more heart to stay than will to go.<eos> Come, death, and welcome.<eos> Juliet wills it so.
When are you guys gonna get it?<eos> It's not them any more!<eos> They're gone! -<eos> - Fuck!<eos> That door is reinforced steel.<eos> They can't get through.<eos> They have power tools.<eos> They have high explosives.<eos> The decompression'll kill them.<eos> - It won't.
I'm sorry.<eos> I'm developmentally challenged.<eos> Like bad. Nightmarey, special episode bad.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> It's all right. I was...<eos> I was a little frustrated.<eos> I just planned on being here one summer, and now it's three years.<eos> It had a lot to do with you.<eos> I just don't want to look back and regret that it should have only been one summer.<eos> You won't.
♪ He were lookin' for a she ♪♪<eos> Where the hell are you?<eos> Everybody is worried about you.<eos> I'm done. it's over.<eos> No.<eos> No way.<eos> I won't let you.<eos> I can't even pay the rent.<eos> Yeah, you can.<eos> And, yes, you will.
And I want to tell you everything.<eos> Good.<eos> Tonight, after you were gone, I thought a lot.<eos> About you... and how you've been treating me, and I thought:<eos> Why do I love you?<eos> And then, I felt everything in me... just let go of everything I was holding onto so tightly... and it hit me that I don't have an intellectual reason.<eos> I trust myself, I trust my feelings.<eos> I'm not gonna try to be anything other than who I am anymore... and I hope you can accept that.<eos> I can.<eos> I will.
- And he didn't have anyone else to drive him.<eos> - That's actually a really nice thing to do. - He would do the same thing for me.<eos> Well, I really want to make it up to you.<eos> I take a ballroom class every<eos> Thursday if you're interested.<eos> - Oh, I also do ballroom.<eos> You do?<eos> - Honestly, though, I haven't done it since I was really, really young, but...<eos> Well, you better find something snazzy to wear. Okay.<eos> I will. - All right.
It's Big Red all over again.<eos> Only this time, instead of one lawn mower, it'll be 32 giant, fire-breathing cars!<eos> And I won't be able to save you.<eos> You won't have to, because this time, I have speed.<eos> You're not a car.<eos> You're a snail.<eos> I got a shot here, Chet.<eos> I can do this.<eos> You'll see.<eos> No, I won't.
Very simple.<eos> I'm not asking you to tell me her name.<eos> I know you'll refuse.<eos> But, tell me it isn't Escartefigue's wife.<eos> No, it's not her.<eos> All right.<eos> So what do we do about Fanny?<eos> Let's wait.<eos> What if she accepts Panisse?<eos> She won't.
Ladies and gentlemen, I thank you.<eos> - Good to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Not a bad price. Can I say hello to you in public?<eos> Oh, Billy.<eos> You were fantastic, my friend!<eos> I'm happy for you.<eos> I'm going to miss you.<eos> You say it like we'll never meet again.<eos> Of course we will.
No.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Down?<eos> No.<eos> Will you pin it on me, Mama?<eos> Red.<eos> I might have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
I totally understand.<eos> It's business.<eos> I would do the same.<eos> But it isn't just business, is it? What we do.<eos> It's passion, love.<eos> Which is why we are prepared to risk our lives for it.<eos> Not me.<eos> If I had more talent and could earn better money with something else, I would.<eos> How do you know you will make money here? You haven't yet.<eos> Not yet, but I will.
Father!<eos> I would like to accept.<eos> What a beauty.<eos> But first, there's something I have to tell you.<eos> Two years ago, my mother died of tuberculosis.<eos> I contracted it too.<eos> I've loved you since that day you rescued my hat.<eos> I've loved you since the wind brought you to me.<eos> Please marry me.<eos> I will.
Ok, you are Jonah.<eos> Don't forget.<eos> Please.<eos> I love you.<eos> I will never forget you.<eos> I love you.<eos> You just go to sleep, ok?<eos> I'm scared.<eos> I don't want to die.<eos> - You will not.
We were all loitering in the parking lot, and... the plan was to go to the dive bar next door, keep the party going.<eos> But you said that we couldn't make it because I had to work the next day and you had to get me to bed.<eos> - Yeah, and you were pissed.<eos> But secretly...<eos> I loved that.<eos> Because I knew right then and there, you'd be an amazing father.<eos> But, I need you. You know?<eos> I don't wanna do this without you.<eos> You have me.<eos> You always will.
You have baby names?<eos> You want babies?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Don't you?<eos> What'd you say we let the Mama take a look?<eos> I'd love to...<eos> Now hand over my baby.<eos> Bo promised...<eos> She promised nothing would happen to my baby.<eos> Then nothing will.
Is that what you think?<eos> You destroyed us.<eos> You ran off in the middle of the night.<eos> We lost our standing.<eos> We were almost exiled.<eos> No, mom.<eos> I don't want your forgiveness.<eos> I came to forgive you... and tell you that I love you.<eos> Both of you.<eos> And I always will.
There's nothing to see.<eos> But where is she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Come on. Story time.<eos> I really want to see.<eos> Let's have a story, naughty, naughty.<eos> What if they don't find her?<eos> They'll find her.<eos> Yeah, but what if they don't?<eos> They will.
He was just a traveling encyclopedia salesman and she was a waitress at a diner.<eos> And she got pregnant and she told him, and he took off.<eos> That's it?<eos> He never returned?<eos> No.<eos> He never called?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> So he has no idea who you are?<eos> He has no clue.<eos> But he will.
Are you fucking crazy?<eos> - No.<eos> - They're not gonna leave the money - on the street anymore anyway, okay?<eos> - So we go inside and get it!<eos> Just fucking forget it.<eos> Forget everything.<eos> There's cameras at every door, okay? So why am I even talking?<eos> I'm not even... I'm not...<eos> Cops won't expect it.<eos> Nobody will.
How many?<eos> Barristan: 2,000, Your Grace.<eos> Armored and mounted.<eos> Enough to make a difference?<eos> It's hard to collect wages from a corpse.<eos> I'm sure the sellswords prefer to fight for the winning side.<eos> I imagine you're right.<eos> I'd like to talk to the Titan's Bastard about winning.<eos> He may not agree to meet.<eos> He will.
"Ritsas."<eos> That was close enough.<eos> Does she know her daughter's a queen?<eos> Not yet.<eos> That will be a surprise, I expect.<eos> Many surprises for her.<eos> How am I supposed to sit here planning a war when you're over there looking like that?<eos> Will you come with me one day to Volantis?<eos> When all this is over?<eos> I will.
So tell me what are your plans for the future?<eos> Have you two thought of having a child of your own?<eos> - What can I say, ma'am...<eos> - What can I say, Cornelia.<eos> I've been asking you for ages to call me Cornelia.<eos> You really want to make me feel old, do you?<eos> - Can I have one? - Go ahead.<eos> Another thing.<eos> Quit smoking.<eos> Maybe this way he will, too.
To the greatest invention since jazz.<eos> - Hell, yeah.<eos> - Salud.<eos> Cheers, liar.<eos> Well, for the record,<eos> I nearly tripped over your crap on the way out.<eos> Are you still coming by this weekend to get it out?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I will.<eos> I will.
Why not?<eos> You don't think people want to hear the truth?<eos> Not as much as when Louis was the culprit.<eos> The other papers reported on it in a very small way, didn't they?<eos> In a few months, I doubt anybody will remember the Jessie Taylor case that clearly. It'll slip away, bit by bit.<eos> Well, I hope you're wrong.<eos> But you're probably not.<eos> Of course, we don't have Louis' side of the story.<eos> I still haven't heard from him.<eos> Perhaps we never will.
And I'll have her call me Mummy Olanna or something, so that if Amala ever comes back, she can be Mummy.<eos> You're doing this to please the revolutionary.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Why are you doing it then?<eos> She was so helpless.<eos> I felt as if I knew her.<eos> I think this is a very brave decision.<eos> Will you come back for her christening?<eos> Yes.<eos> Of course, I will.
- I want to love you oh, I want to love you but I can't let go<eos> I can't let go no, I can't let go<eos> I can't let go won't you help me help me to let go<eos> I want you to meet the songwriter Jimmy Collins...<eos> And his partner Kyle Bishop.<eos> It's almost midnight.<eos> - I don't want to stop working.<eos> - Neither do I.<eos> We shouldn't let our momentum die.<eos> We won't.
Every room keeps getting blocked.<eos> There's a way, we'll find it.<eos> Or... we could just... glare at it.<eos> I hate this.<eos> The warehouse was supposed to do good, but instead, it just keeps killing the people I love.<eos> Well, that's kind of a simplification.<eos> Is it, though?<eos> You died, Leena died, and now, the whole damn world is dying.<eos> Claud, Claud, Claud, Pete and myka will find a cure.<eos> - They will.
They need to obliterate the enemy.<eos> Blow them to bits.<eos> - Please unhand me.<eos> - Or what?<eos> You're threatening me with a spoon now?<eos> Giuliano!<eos> As I was saying, the timbre of the barrel is also indicative of its general properties.<eos> Start again.<eos> Don't scrimp on the sulfur this time!<eos> He won't.
I have to think it over, I can't...<eos> You've already thought it over.<eos> In truth, your journey has already begun.<eos> Time... is a river.<eos> You have already made the decision.<eos> You make it every time.<eos> He's done the coin thing, has he?<eos> You're the map maker.<eos> I thought you needed rescuing?<eos> - I will.
You are perfect.<eos> You are the perfect wife.<eos> Just not for me. I have been waiting for the right girl should show up.<eos> And it was not you. I do not think it is charming, when you wrinkle your nose.<eos> Your little roll of the head is annoying.<eos> I so wanted to love everything about you, but it was just not there.<eos> What I am trying to say is:<eos> Natasha Moss...<eos> Want to let you divorce me?<eos> Yes... Yes, I will! I will definitely.
Guess where he is now?<eos> The valkyries are taking him home to Valhalla.<eos> Right at this moment he is...<eos> He is drinking ale with the gods.<eos> Yes, he is happier than even we are, with our boat and... these goods.<eos> Erik:<eos> Even so, he was my kinsman.<eos> We must avenge his death.<eos> It was done in the name of king Aelle, and king Aelle must suffer for it.<eos> One day, he will...
[ music ]<eos> Lauren!<eos> [ music ]<eos> Lauren!<eos> Guess she went to the banquet without you.<eos> And the award for Worst Girlfriend Ever! Goes to me...<eos> She'll forgive you.<eos> Here's to your Dawning.<eos> May you not die.<eos> - I won't.
One... two.<eos> Three.<eos> Mr. McCall?<eos> Uh, I'm sure it's an emergency if your mother needs you to leave school, but I'm gonna give you a warning in the nicest possible way.<eos> I am well aware of your attendance record.<eos> I don't wanna see you slip back into old habits.<eos> I won't.<eos> It's gonna be different this year.<eos> Resolutions are only good if you stick with them, Scott.<eos> I will.
I came for Network<eos> - Why do not you come for your guy?<eos> - Red, this is the sent your men to the window of the church?<eos> Yes, but we to deal with it, obviously.<eos> Really?<eos> Because it seems just the opposite.<eos> I pay by direct this and ensure our interests , thing you're doing.<eos> And the question arises: where is my gold?<eos> Oh, I have, Judah.<eos> You will.
Do you see any stripes here?<eos> Blood drawn?<eos> No.<eos> This woman, dead five days.<eos> Yes?<eos> Yes.<eos> You see here, these two finger nails broken.<eos> Skin, from her assailant.<eos> Now, Inspector you will confirm that I have not yet opened this sack.<eos> I will.
Who will lead us against the Philistines?<eos> My sons will inherit my place.<eos> Your sons are corrupt.<eos> My sons have been brought up to trust in God and obey his laws!<eos> Everything I have done for you I have done because I walk in God's ways!<eos> We know that they take bribes.<eos> Everyone knows it!<eos> They shame your good name.<eos> So, when you are gone, and the Philistines return, and we look to your sons to call on God... will God answer?<eos> No, he will not.
No.<eos> You haven't forgiven me.<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> You don't love me anymore.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm with someone else now.<eos> You know that.<eos> But I feel an infinite tenderness for you.<eos> I always will.
- I'm drowning!<eos> - We must.<eos> Throw the fucking thing!<eos> I told you I would find you.<eos> Well, what a pleasant surprise.<eos> Look at this, it's tibor.<eos> Where is the money for the car?<eos> I don't quite have it on me, but I'm...<eos> - You don't have it on you, eh?<eos> - I will definitely...
This is not making much of a difference, is it?<eos> Olaf!<eos> Hang in there, guys!<eos> Go.<eos> Go faster!<eos> - Wait, what?<eos> - Hey!<eos> Kristoff!<eos> Don't come back!<eos> We won't.
Hello, Peter.<eos> I am starving.<eos> I forgot to eat.<eos> Would you like something, Peter?<eos> No.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You should eat.<eos> Don't fight.<eos> She'll win.<eos> I will.
Look, it'll be fine.<eos> I promise, he's in great hands.<eos> What?<eos> It's the circus, kid.<eos> What?<eos> What?<eos> Uh, Shawn, I thought that you said we were going to the Le Cirque show.<eos> Yeah. This is a dress rehearsal.<eos> Yes, but we promised Max that he would be seeing the show.<eos> And he will.
You know, I figured you're over there doing your thing.<eos> I'm over here doing my thing, partying and whatnot.<eos> Come on, son.<eos> [Scoffs]<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Huh?<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Hmm?<eos> Will you please Wang Chung with me?<eos> - Will you--
Need the satellite phone.<eos> I'm going to the station.<eos> Well I'll go with you.<eos> No, you stay here.<eos> -Why?<eos> You are too old.<eos> Just let her go.<eos> Listen to reason.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> And you will too.
Well I'll go with you.<eos> No, you stay here.<eos> -Why?<eos> You are too old.<eos> Just let her go.<eos> Listen to reason.<eos> I'm going with you.<eos> And you will too.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Yes, you will.
- Watch us.<eos> Guys!<eos> Look, I know you're scared.<eos> I am too.<eos> But my friends?<eos> They are really good at this.<eos> Stronger than me.<eos> - They will find this murderer.<eos> - She's right.<eos> We will.
Is there anything else?<eos> No. That's all.<eos> For now.<eos> Dr Parr a friend of yours?<eos> A friend of my wife's.<eos> It just goes on and on.<eos> Relentless.<eos> It will stop, I promise.<eos> I just thought, when she woke up, we would get some answers.<eos> And you will.
She often visited Harriet with David.<eos> What the hell is wrong with you?<eos> I lost a game is all.<eos> To a class D player. It's not good enough, Jamie.<eos> It's just that you...<eos> What?<eos> It's just what?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'll win the next round.<eos> Too right you will.
That's it.<eos> So did you find out who this Silverfish was?<eos> It took us a while but it turned out to be one of our own programmers.<eos> Was it Kevin Pierson?<eos> Pierson could barely play draughts.<eos> No.<eos> It's the one next to him.<eos> His name was Jason Winters.<eos> And where will we find Mr Winters?<eos> You won't.
You must believe that you will.<eos> That they will survive and so will you.<eos> You survived polio.<eos> Is it true we are headed for Romania?<eos> So they say.<eos> Ah, I have cousins there.<eos> They have a fine orchestra.<eos> If they won't have me, it will mean a cap on the pavement.<eos> Will you go back to fight this war, Colonel?<eos> We both will.
Somebody will want it.<eos> I want it.<eos> - It's me or the baby.<eos> - The baby, sweetheart.<eos> Know you're gonna regret this.<eos> I love you.<eos> - Are you gonna leave?<eos> - No.<eos> Everybody always leaves.<eos> I won't.
And nobody's here to pay me my money.<eos> And I sure as shit didn't cart my ass all the way down here for free.<eos> Hey, you, kid!<eos> Where's your mother?<eos> She and Kev went to go get a drink.<eos> He was freaking out about the whole kid thing.<eos> What whole kid thing?<eos> About how I may be Kev's kid.<eos> Debs, be home for dinner.<eos> - I will.
You know what?<eos> Then I don't want you to feel compromised.<eos> I'm not gonna tell you any more.<eos> I'll just leave you out of it.<eos> No. I want to know what's going on.<eos> Look.<eos> I don't think she's ever gonna know what you did.<eos> Even if she did know, when all this comes to light,<eos> I honestly believe that she'll think what you did was courageous.<eos> Everybody will.
He wants to concentrate on his sobriety and enlightenment.<eos> He's at fucking Happy Endings!<eos> - Listen, do you think maybe--<eos> - No, Charlie.<eos> You don't even know what I'm about to say.<eos> You were gonna ask me to go talk to him for you.<eos> - Would ya, Hank, please?<eos> - No, can't do it.<eos> - Won't do it.<eos> - Of course he will.
Have you been with him?<eos> No.<eos> But would you blame me if I had?<eos> I'd just be following your example.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> All these years I have sat at home, while you've gone out and had your fun!<eos> Do you think that I want to be this way?<eos> Do you think that it makes me happy?<eos> Now I'm meant to feel sorry for you, is that right?<eos> Well, maybe I will tomorrow.
- She's here now.<eos> - And I have an appointment.<eos> And I did do my homework, Miss Lowry.<eos> I didn't need to see your client to know that she fits the profile of someone who'd commit this kind of act.<eos> I can't believe this.<eos> You arrogant bitch, you judge her before even seeing her!<eos> That was her choice.<eos> Good day.<eos> - Will she see me?<eos> - No. No, she won't.
- Hi, sweetie.<eos> - Hey, baby.<eos> You going to youth group?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - All right.<eos> Hey, can you fill the car up?<eos> You can use the card.<eos> - Yup.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
He's only little, isn't he?<eos> He's just...<eos> He's just my little boy, isn't he?<eos> Listen, boy.<eos> I'm sorry that I er... that I wasn't there for you and er...<eos> You're... you're my...<eos> You're my boy, Danny, and I let you down.<eos> I'm so, so sorry.<eos> I love you zillions, superstar.<eos> I always will.
And he needed help.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> He killed himself because no one gave a damn.<eos> So everything that we talked about, our... our plans and having a family... none of it was ever going to happen.<eos> He lost his life.<eos> And I lost everything.<eos> But his sacrifice won't be forgotten.<eos> Killing people isn't going to bring your husband back.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
I want to get out.<eos> Yeah, well, we all want things that we can't have.<eos> But if I kill her like he would kill her, then maybe I could understand him better.<eos> I wonder if then you would finally understand what you've become.<eos> They will be sewing up Dr. Chilton until the morning...<eos> That is, if he makes it through the night.<eos> At least Will remains in one piece... for now.<eos> His temperature is 105.<eos> White blood cell count is twice normal, and they still can't identify the source of his infection.<eos> They will.
And victims can sometimes broadcast victimhood involuntarily.<eos> Not me.<eos> That's not necessarily true.<eos> Your victimhood has a high profile.<eos> Celebrity victim.<eos> Someone here asked me if I kept my stained clothes.<eos> How did that make you feel?<eos> Like I wanted to go home.<eos> But I don't have a home anymore, do I?<eos> You will.
But he's so not like that.<eos> How do you know?<eos> We had breakfast the other day.<eos> He's sweet, funny.<eos> Yeah, you liked him, right?<eos> Totally.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> You weren't here. We all had breakfast.<eos> I haven't even met him.<eos> Well, you will.
Monica Penny had seen something in me... something strong.<eos> And maybe it was nuts, defining myself by what a retired porn star thought of me, but she made me realize that if I didn't define who I was and what I wanted, somebody else would.<eos> And what I wanted was Sebastian.<eos> And no man, not even my father, could stop me.<eos> You know, I actually think I prefer him this way.<eos> He's more interesting.<eos> I just wish I could have found morrissey.<eos> I know I'll never see him again.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> Of course you will.
- It's...<eos> - No need to say.<eos> - I see it in your eyes.<eos> - Beautiful.<eos> It's only beautiful if it works.<eos> Set the sail.<eos> Floki!<eos> The sail!<eos> - She'll sink.<eos> - No, she bloody won't.
I am kind of worn out from the night before you left.<eos> Okay, so, couch time and... Yes! ...I will get some popcorn.<eos> I'm glad to have you back.<eos> I genuinely missed you.<eos> Before you say anything, I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry that I attacked you at the reception.<eos> It's just, I saw you up there, singing with Blaine, and I saw the old, legendary chemistry.<eos> I saw two soul mates rediscovering each other, and I was jealous. Why couldn't that be me?<eos> Why can't I have that with someone?<eos> You will, just not with me.
You know.<eos> Finn, I love this song.<eos> Who do you like best, Chloe?<eos> Morrissey, or the lead singer of the Smiths?<eos> Well, it depends what mood I'm in.<eos> What?<eos> 'In your face, Chloe!<eos> '<eos> Right, who wants a beer?<eos> - I will.
This is from the girl to her mother, um, begging for forgiveness, wanting to come home.<eos> She signs it "Oksana Svetlova."<eos> I hope this helps.<eos> Oh, yeah, it does.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Uh, please, my apologies.<eos> Uh, I must go, but I can come back to translate fully if you like.<eos> (Kate) Thank you.<eos> Do you know who did this to her?<eos> No, but we will.
Well, you're in.<eos> Oh, and, uh, for dinner tonight, wear something revealing.<eos> Red Widow 01x05 The Recorder Original Air Date March 24, 2013<eos> High-end assault rifles, handguns.<eos> I didn't get the buyer's name.<eos> This is good.<eos> This is really good.<eos> We just gotta find the mode of transport, the timing.<eos> - He doesn't have the business yet.<eos> - He will.
I'm trying to search here.<eos> Could you just be a little quiet?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I'm sorry, Doctor.<eos> Jane's had some problems, uh... taking stuff.<eos> Oh. Well, that's the first I've ever heard of that.<eos> Well, in that case, let's empty your pocket.<eos> No, I will not.
- Thank...<eos> - [Zoe] Hello?<eos> - Zoe.<eos> [Toilet flushes]<eos> You don't have to tiptoe.<eos> I thought you fell asleep.<eos> No.<eos> Just thinking about work.<eos> I don't have anything for you yet.<eos> I will soon.
She's just trying to be thoughtful.<eos> I'm sure she was.<eos> So you're not mad?<eos> About what?<eos> About how comfortable your ex-wife is in your home and with your family, how she seems to know things about you that I don't know?<eos> Why would I be upset?<eos> Okay, see, this is why I wanted to stay at the Four Seasons, So you wouldn't have to deal with this.<eos> Castle, I shouldn't have to deal with this Because you should've said no.<eos> Yes, but I didn't, and now I can't. I know.<eos> I'll...
Make some magic, dog boy.<eos> Nothing here.<eos> I could've told you that.<eos> Maybe something out here.<eos> I'll hope so.<eos> Put that back.<eos> Exactly how it was.<eos> Put it back.<eos> Stuart, what if he doesn't find anything?<eos> He will.
Know this or face extinction.<eos> This is Allegra.<eos> She is the equivalent of a human female in her late 80s.<eos> Allegra suffers from acute bradycardia, her kidneys are failing, she's lost the ability to swallow.<eos> Allegra, in short, is dying.<eos> Now, several hours after this video was taken, we injected Allegra with our Serum RM47.<eos> We expanded on the University of Wisconsin studies on induced pluripotent stem cells.<eos> Meet Allegra today.<eos> I'll have what she's having.<eos> And you will.
Go ahead, bunny.<eos> Do your worst.<eos> I deserve it.<eos> I ignored you, tried to pawn you off on someone else...<eos> I didn't take these silly things out or fluff this like I was supposed to.<eos> I wasn't really thinking about you at all.<eos> Any of you.<eos> Just wanted the jewels.<eos> I hope you'll all forgive me someday.<eos> You will?
But you've improvised quite nicely.<eos> I'm in your debt, my friend.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm the one that owes you.<eos> I killed two of those girls.<eos> You took the blame.<eos> There's no point both of us rotting away in here.<eos> How can I ever repay you?<eos> Oh, you will.<eos> My friend, you will.
No, I'm gonna remove the dead tissue, and I'm gonna clear out your infection.<eos> Now, before the procedure, is there anybody that you should call?<eos> No, nobody that would answer the phone.<eos> I have a daughter, Leslie, but I haven't talked to her in years.<eos> No, it's just me and my chakras and apparently now my busted panc.<eos> He's ready.<eos> Hey, doc, do you think maybe you could call her?<eos> Maybe that would work.<eos> It'd be really great to see her again.<eos> You will.
This stupid merger.<eos> It's bad enough my vote is worth 1/3 of what it was last week.<eos> Now our uni-balls, gone.<eos> Our... What?<eos> Pens, Donna.<eos> The new quartermaster,<eos> Barbara L. Tottingham, will not buy us any more uni-balls.<eos> There's not one single uni-ball in this entire firm.<eos> - Please stop saying uni-ball.<eos> - No, I will not.
Well, I do.<eos> He needs a head on a platter.<eos> Why mine?<eos> You've been skirting environmental laws for a decade.<eos> He's got a chance to nail you, and he's gonna take it.<eos> This isn't an environmental allegation.<eos> No, it's a bribery charge, it's got teeth, and it's coming your way.<eos> Don't sugarcoat it, Mr. Specter.<eos> Give it to me straight.<eos> Okay, I will.
You think you know me?<eos> It was I who languished for years thinking of nothing but you.<eos> Nothing but this moment.<eos> And now the perfect tool for my vengeance is in front of us.<eos> I never planned on killing you.<eos> But I will make you share my pain, Kenobi.<eos> Satine.<eos> Remember, my dear Obi-Wan...<eos> I've loved you always.<eos> I always will.
I tested it this morning.<eos> Ah, hair of the dog -- also a good cure.<eos> I don't know about the cure part.<eos> How'd your end go?<eos> This afternoon, Flynn will be at a micro-distillery tasting for event planners and liquor distributors.<eos> How'd you find out -- organized crime tip?<eos> Organized wife tip.<eos> She has access to the guest lists for these types of things.<eos> She's not gonna be there, is she?<eos> Yeah, she will.
And then when we're done, we'll, uh, need to finish our conversation with James.<eos> Would you mind handling that without me?<eos> Neal, he's your father.<eos> You have to talk to him.<eos> He's a man we need information from.<eos> And I know you'll ask all the right questions.<eos> Stop staring. You're hurting my head.<eos> If that's what you really want.<eos> It is.<eos> All right, I will.
Right.<eos> One-footed Josiah mentioned him, didn't he?<eos> He did.<eos> Well, just go talk to him, and then after that, go talk to your father.<eos> Art...<eos> He knows who and where Drew is.<eos> He won't...<eos> It's easy, Raylan.<eos> You just stuff that file, tell him we've got all the evidence that we need, and then you give him a little nudge or a thinly veiled threat, and he'll spook.<eos> He won't.
Make peace, and bask in glorious light.<eos> He shall be awarded all respect deserved.<eos> Many a boy may enter a war.<eos> Yet at it's end, only a man will emerge.<eos> It warms my heart to see you become one.<eos> I am what you have made me.<eos> More soldiers return.<eos> They pry wood and beams searching for vermin.<eos> If we stay, will they not find us?<eos> They will.
And you didn't admit to more than that?<eos> No.<eos> I said everything exactly like you told me to.<eos> - You really think I'd spill my guts?<eos> - Calm down.<eos> Why didn't you tell me he was gonna hurt himself?<eos> I never would've done it.<eos> How could I have known?<eos> - I just want all this to go away.<eos> - It will.
Doesn't seem all that fine to me.<eos> And it kills me to say it, but if he's not fine, he can't be here.<eos> Well, that's not your call, Director.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> That would be up to SECNAV Jarvis.<eos> Look, Gibbs, for all intents and purposes, he's on your team now.<eos> So that means it's your job to protect him and my job to protect you.<eos> Give him time to figure things out.<eos> And if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
Never felt so powerless.<eos> A few days later,<eos> I buried you...<eos> My only child...<eos> Right here.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you, Sasha.<eos> No matter what.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
Is that daddy?<eos> No, honey, it's not.<eos> Um...<eos> April, I beg you.<eos> Can you just...<eos> Can you tell him to call his son?<eos> Can you please just...<eos> I don't...<eos> Tell him that his son wants to speak to him.<eos> Of course I will.
I'm not going anywhere else with you.<eos> - Ruben.<eos> - No.<eos> It's the only option for us.<eos> I've got my lab, my office, a lockdown room.<eos> I can do all the treatments in there.<eos> I'll be in control.<eos> He'll be trapped.<eos> - Look, if he gets out again...<eos> - He won't.
I hate it.<eos> I hate all shots and hospitals and doctors.<eos> Even your friend Dr. Cole?<eos> Especially him.<eos> Why, what's wrong with Dr. Cole?<eos> I can't say.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'll get in trouble.<eos> No, no, no, Wendy.<eos> No, you won't.
I don't know, I just, uh... Realized I don't blame you.<eos> Jason's the one who turned us against each other.<eos> You know, for the past five years I've thought of you as elevated cortisol levels.<eos> Unbalanced endogenous opioids.<eos> Wow, please stop.<eos> You were, uh, an anomaly in Jason's brain, to... to be eliminated.<eos> I never thought of you as a person.<eos> How could I keep making a drug that would kill another person?<eos> I can't.<eos> I won't.
I know.<eos> I threw them out the window when I met you because my life was on the line.<eos> Now the threat is over.<eos> And you're bringing another threat into your life.<eos> It's my work.<eos> What can I say?<eos> I treat dangerous people.<eos> It's a hazard of the job.<eos> Besides, you have no proof that Zach Hamilton is guilty of anything.<eos> I will.
It's possible Joe made an attempt to trace Claire Matthews' location via our satellite system.<eos> We got to move her right now.<eos> Yes, we do, but we need you to convince her of that.<eos> Will you call her?<eos> Using what phone exactly?<eos> No.<eos> I want to do it in person.<eos> You got to get me a chopper, and from now on,<eos> I want to be in charge of her safety detail.<eos> Like hell you will!
Because she knows it isn't safe?<eos> It's possible.<eos> Well, yeah, if you're not taking into account that she died two years ago.<eos> Sure, it's possible.<eos> Toby? I don't think we're in here alone.<eos> Emily? It feels like home when you see a friendly face.<eos> Uh, this is for you.<eos> It's from my mom.<eos> Tell her I said thank you and I look forward to having her over for tea as soon as I'm settled in.<eos> I will.
- Are you OK?<eos> How long has it been since you went to Cork?<eos> 17?<eos> 18 years?<eos> I saw the ticket in your bag.<eos> When are you going?<eos> - So I can plan.<eos> - Did you read my mail?<eos> I never read it.<eos> I never will.
- Lulu has responsibilities!<eos> But you don't know anything about responsibilities.<eos> - Hey!<eos> - Wait!<eos> Wait!<eos> What did you say?<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Hey!<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Will you...
I'm not perfect, Julian.<eos> I'm very, very close, but so what?<eos> So I guess I didn't know how hard it would be missing the day-to-day of my kid's life.<eos> I mean, you're there all the time.<eos> You're there when she gets up in the morning.<eos> Guess I'm afraid that you'll be her role model, and I'll be some putz who hangs around sometimes.<eos> You're not the putz who hangs around.<eos> Come on.<eos> They need the bed. I don't want to lose her.<eos> You won't.
I watched it umpteen times.<eos> Did yöu write all these films?<eos> I almost did.<eos> I had all these ideas.<eos> But...someone else made the films.<eos> I didn't even write it on paper.<eos> I had cooked it up fresh in my mind.<eos> Yet they stole it.<eos> That means yöu never wrote anything.<eos> I will...for yöu.
You're okay.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Oh. Patrick.<eos> Thank God.<eos> I told you, I need to do this on my own.<eos> No, you need my help now.<eos> Police are closing in.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Do they know I'm here?<eos> No, not yet, but they soon will.
"Your mother sucks cocks in hell!"<eos> That shit never gets old, right?<eos> I might actually be lucky this happened now.<eos> Guards just think I got the flu like everyone else.<eos> Well, in two days, you're gonna be wishing you had the flu.<eos> I'm lucky you're here with me.<eos> And I'll get through it.<eos> I'll get back on track.<eos> They won't even find out I was using.<eos> Yes, they will.
How's it feel?<eos> Not great.<eos> So I checked some of the Cronus guys' phones last night.<eos> I couldn't find anything.<eos> I really appreciate it, man.<eos> All of it.<eos> Because if this doesn't work, I'll be expelled.<eos> And my whole future will be over.<eos> Hey, I'll find something.<eos> I will.
She would never do something like this.<eos> - Then who did?<eos> - Quiet!<eos> Ahsoka!<eos> It's me, Anakin!<eos> Stop running!<eos> You can't help me, Master.<eos> Someone's setting me up!<eos> I believe you, Ahsoka!<eos> But no one else will!
Wait.<eos> I... I know... I know what this is.<eos> I think I remember who I am.<eos> Well, I'm sure Mr. Gold will be thrilled.<eos> These are the places you saw it?<eos> Yeah. This town's lousy with magic.<eos> Now you should go.<eos> If Neal suspects anything, it's gonna make everything we have to do that much harder.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> He won't.
Take a look.<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> He's alive, Hook.<eos> He beat you.<eos> Now this guy has some powerful magic, mate.<eos> He's untouchable.<eos> You'll never get another chance to take him down.<eos> Oh, I will.<eos> I will indeed.
How is this any different?<eos> The wraith.<eos> What?<eos> We sent it through a portal.<eos> Why can't we do the same thing with the self-destruct?<eos> - Because we don't know if it's going to work.<eos> - It could.<eos> It's too risky.<eos> No one will go along with it.<eos> Yes, we will.
Your tracksuit!<eos> I'm going for a jog.<eos> I've been a lump.<eos> You deserve better.<eos> I feel like a weight has been lifted.<eos> - All right. - Okay.<eos> - Here we go.<eos> - Bye. Have fun.<eos> - See you in a bit.<eos> I will. [ Chuckle ]
This heroin thing is starting to blow up a little bit, and I'm damn close to making some busts.<eos> Okay.<eos> The thing is, the guys over in narcotics, they get real territorial, and they don't want a guy from vice taking collars from them.<eos> So I told a little white lie to my boss 'cause I wasn't where I was supposed to be last night, and I said that you and I...<eos> Can you just say yes if anyone asks?<eos> Why do I feel like I'm not getting the whole story?<eos> Because you're not getting the whole story.<eos> I'm working a case.<eos> Will you cover for me, please? Uh...<eos> Of course you will.
Still getting used to things.<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm...<eos> I'm sure it's-- it's very different.<eos> I...<eos> She was so much a part of my life.<eos> But I have my work and I have Emmalin.<eos> And you have friends who care about you deeply.<eos> Don't forget that.<eos> I won't.
Come on.<eos> What do you have against soldiers?<eos> You don't know me that well.<eos> Yeah, but I'd like to.<eos> Look...<eos> I appreciate the offer, I do. But no way.<eos> What's that?<eos> My number.<eos> In case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
So, um, what's on your mind?<eos> It's my mom.<eos> She hates surprises.<eos> And I'm, um, about to lay a big one on her.<eos> Mom, say something?<eos> Why do you want to rush into war?<eos> I don't want to take charge of a platoon and be the only guy who doesn't have a combat patch.<eos> Sorry, I don't date customers, especially soldiers.<eos> My number, in case you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Yeah, I do.<eos> You okay?<eos> I feel like you're a million miles away right now.<eos> Yeah, I'm good.<eos> I just... I was thinking.<eos> Maybe I should stay here for a little while.<eos> Maybe we should hold off on the whole moving-in-together a little bit.<eos> Sure, if that's what you really want.<eos> Just don't go too far away.<eos> I won't.
It's from the 27th floor.<eos> I saved it from the Dumpster.<eos> It was so close, wasn't it?<eos> The end.<eos> Our careers in ruin.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I don't want that<eos> - to happen again.<eos> - I know.<eos> It won't.
[Grunts]<eos> I just realized...<eos> You can't control everything...<eos> [Sighs]<eos> No matter how hard you try.<eos> Let's just say I made peace with that fact.<eos> [Groaning]<eos> Peace?<eos> You love Elena.<eos> You always will.
- Aaron, I have a family. That sergeant I stabbed?<eos> He was...<eos> She's 11.<eos> - Is she okay?<eos> - Yeah, she is.<eos> My family got to Texas.<eos> They're, uh waiting for me.<eos> Well, then you have to get back to them.<eos> I want you to know I love you, Aaron.<eos> I always will.
It's not just any body, Alvin.<eos> It's a case in point of the kind of cancer that's eating at this neighbourhood.<eos> What seems to have gathered so many interested parties?<eos> Fire department found Jane Doe this morning.<eos> Looks like she was strangled sometime last night.<eos> And all interested parties have been assured results from your team.<eos> Ha, ha, well...<eos> We appreciate the confidence.<eos> I just don't understand why a Jane Doe would draw the attention of the IIB.<eos> You will.
Private security firm.<eos> Perfect way to satisfy her inner cop.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And one of their clients was a tech startup in the Empire State Building.<eos> That's got to be it.<eos> Well, the question is, how do we search it?<eos> We don't.<eos> We keep our distance and let Neal search on his own.<eos> Does he know where to look?<eos> He will.
What you've said...<eos> it was beautiful.<eos> Well, thank you very much.<eos> I guess you're going back to Turkey tomorrow.<eos> I can't go home.<eos> As soon as I set foot in my country...<eos> I'm going to be killed.<eos> ♪ Blue Bloods 3x15 ♪ Warriors Original Air Date on February 15, 2013<eos> I can assure you that nothing came from this office.<eos> Nor will anything.
He's no fool.<eos> It's to punish me.<eos> My sweet boy, George.<eos> My poor, sweet boy.<eos> Their children will be orphans.<eos> Orphans and paupers!<eos> Their father dies a traitor.<eos> His lands will be forfeit.<eos> And who do you think will get them?<eos> SHE will.
Took it with him to Korea.<eos> When he made it back in one piece, that made the knife a good luck charm.<eos> So...<eos> When my dad shipped out for Vietnam, he took it with him.<eos> He made it back home too, which made the damn thing Miracle lucky.<eos> Here.<eos> Make sure you always come back alive.<eos> Miles, I can't take this.<eos> I... I-I don't want this.<eos> One day, maybe your son will.
There you go!<eos> Be right back, okay?<eos> So what's gonna happen with her?<eos> She'll disappear.<eos> I'll make sure she does.<eos> So we'll... we'll never know?<eos> It needs to unfurl on its own, Anonymously, Where the world can't interfere.<eos> And if she's carrying what we think,<eos> You will know.<eos> We all will.
If she wasn't the one they were after and she's just in the way--<eos> Mr. Castle, you need to stay positive.<eos> Whatever their motives, the kidnappers will realize she has value.<eos> Now what we need to do next is go to your home and set up a trap and trace on your phone lines so we're ready for their call.<eos> I'll wait for you outside.<eos> Gates will see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I can't believe this is happening.<eos> We're gonna find her, Castle.<eos> We will.
No, but we just--<eos> That's the job.<eos> That's my life.<eos> Yeah, but, uh... we just met.<eos> I mean, I got a lot of questions, a lot of things I want to say.<eos> I don't--I don't...<eos> I-I need to have more time.<eos> Maybe we can do that sometime, you know, someday.<eos> How will I know if you made it?<eos> Oh, you won't.
No, no. No, Bobby, I'm good. L...<eos> I'm here to get you.<eos> You don't belong here, Bobby.<eos> And we're getting you out.<eos> Am I the only one who sees the urgency of this?<eos> - Sir. - Something is going on.<eos> My hellhound has been killed.<eos> Winchester, jumbo size, is trying to break into the mother ship and that prophet of theirs is madly translating away.<eos> - Add it up.<eos> - I will, sir.
-So sack me. -Why would I want to do that?<eos> You tell me.<eos> I work for you as long as you'll have me.<eos> I apologise, Will.<eos> I know you've got my back.<eos> I appreciate your honesty very much.<eos> Shall we get on?<eos> -You only have one computer, is that correct?<eos> -Yes. But I don't see what that's got to do with what happened to that woman.<eos> You will.
You think he started the fire?<eos> I think that's why he can never speak about her.<eos> That's why she wants revenge.<eos> Jesus, Lorna, that's crazy.<eos> What can we do?<eos> Dad?<eos> If you want to tell us more... about the fire, about what happened, then maybe it'd be good to get it off your chest.<eos> And then maybe this... haunting, whatever it is... well, maybe it'll stop.<eos> Think about it.<eos> I will.
The kid can't keep a secret.<eos> Do you have an example?<eos> I do.<eos> Francine's throwing a surprise party for you next Friday at 7:00 p.m.<eos> She got you the movie The Usual Suspects.<eos> Kevin Spacey is Keyser Soze.<eos> Takes all the names from the things in the room.<eos> Listen, if the CIA finds out we've been harboring an alien, they'll kill us all.<eos> He's not gonna tell anybody.<eos> He will.
Stay up there.<eos> Oh, Steve.<eos> What's that in your pants?<eos> It's my butt.<eos> Mom!<eos> Aw, honey.<eos> Is everyone else's tushie filling out except yours?<eos> Yes.<eos> What if my ass never comes in?<eos> Oh, it will.
Thanks a lot.<eos> You're married.<eos> I told him that, but it didn't seem to faze him.<eos> Flattering?<eos> Well, sort of.<eos> But it's SOCO, they've had their hands everywhere.<eos> Dirty Brian.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sir, do you think we'll get them, the killer?<eos> We will.
Mr. Shikijoh...<eos> Do you think he'll really come here?<eos> He will.
You got it?<eos> Control, alt, delete.<eos> Got it.<eos> Sweetheart, are you all right?<eos> How's little Carl?<eos> Perfect.<eos> I keep checking to see if something's changed, if somehow he knows his mother's... gone, but...<eos> He's too little.<eos> He couldn't possibly understand.<eos> He will one day.
You're right, Castle.<eos> It does change how I see you.<eos> It makes me like you just a little bit more.<eos> Don't forget Mr. Whiskers.<eos> Oh, so now you remember his name.<eos> Could you give us a second, please?<eos> I was hoping you'd come.<eos> I wanted to say good-bye this time.<eos> "Good-bye" makes me feel like I'll never see you again.<eos> You won't.
My boss seems to like you, G. That's right.<eos> Hey, hey, come here.<eos> How much for this?<eos> Now that...<eos> That'll buy you a brick, my man.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> Don't forget to breathe.<eos> He won't.
Hey, hey, come here.<eos> How much for this?<eos> Now that...<eos> That'll buy you a brick, my man.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> [Tires squealing]<eos> Don't forget to breathe.<eos> He won't.<eos> I won't.
Be careful, now.<eos> It's Abed's camera.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Watch it.<eos> Oh, where is the stop button on this?<eos> Oh, here it is.<eos> Okay.<eos> - You want to hear my pitch? - Mmm-hmm.<eos> A strong, independent woman, starting her own business.<eos> An "entrepreneu-her," if you will.
- Go ahead, Larry.<eos> It's Larry, right?<eos> Before you have security set their tasers to stun, let me just say that in this box my colleague is holding is dirt.<eos> All the dirt we spent the past week digging up on every single one of you.<eos> Dirty dirt. Filthy dirt.<eos> Some of it is illegal, and some of it's just downright disgusting.<eos> I'm talking "no amount of Lysol's gonna clean that corporate jet" disgusting.<eos> You know what he's talking about, right?<eos> - Actually, I don't.<eos> - Oh, soon you will.
- What the hell's that about? - Um...<eos> That would be me. I think I might have told Charlotte that they could use the bar for a press conference.<eos> (Sighs)<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> (Conrad) Ah, Jack.<eos> I wanted to thank you for allowing us the use of the tavern.<eos> Yeah, sure, but you'll have to excuse me.<eos> I'm running late.<eos> Actually, we were hoping to discuss involving you with the campaign in a more official capacity.<eos> Our very own, uh, "Joe the plumber," if you will.
We can prove that the rig was sabotaged.<eos> We're gonna expose who's behind this ourselves.<eos> We'll have to subpoena the wreckage.<eos> That won't be easy.<eos> Why don't we just quit all this and open up a sandwich shop?<eos> Ken Richards wouldn't lie to me.<eos> Someone put a gag on him.<eos> I want to talk to Mr. Richards.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
I don't really want to talk about that.<eos> Um, I do, however, want to save this boy's life, so can you please help me?<eos> I can't issue the order.<eos> I don't think you'll prevail on the merits.<eos> Judge, please...<eos> But I will grant an emergency hearing for a preliminary injunction.<eos> Thank you.<eos> My courtroom, tomorrow, 10:00 A.M.<eos> Come prepared with a real argument.<eos> Yes, I will.
It wasn't her fault.<eos> She was only trying to be nice.<eos> It was me.<eos> I don't belong here and these past few days have shown me that.<eos> I don't accept what you're saying and Cora certainly won't.<eos> But we must go now or we'll get stick.<eos> Do any of you ever leave school?<eos> I'm sneaking off.<eos> I wish I knew why.<eos> You will.
I'll get it.<eos> Don't say anything.<eos> Hi!<eos> Ready?<eos> Hi, ma'am.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - Good, you?<eos> Don't be late.<eos> Call if you need to.<eos> I will.
Mature deliberation (! )<eos> Cheer up, lad.<eos> You read the letter.<eos> You were a very near miss.<eos> So, next time, you'll hit the target.<eos> I reckon Jimmy's right.<eos> They say that to everyone who fails.<eos> Well, I reckon you work hard and you deserve to succeed.<eos> You just have to stick at it...<eos> and you will.
Darling, I do think your going to rescue my hopeless brother is an act of real love, and I cherish you for it.<eos> That'll keep me warm as I cross the raging seas.<eos> Good.<eos> Now, kiss me.<eos> Lady Grantham says we can stay 'til we're done.<eos> But, it'll be a few weeks more.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> Not if you make yourselves useful.<eos> Try to be strong, my darling.<eos> I will.
Because our professionalism and standards have to be beyond reproach, Virginia.<eos> You know, this is not research into kidney disease, which might survive some incident of inner-departmental scandal.<eos> This study is the scandal.<eos> So even a hint of impropriety could derail all our work now, everything that's to come.<eos> I understand you're upset about Scully.<eos> I'm not talking about Scully!<eos> Now, given that every museum in the world is filled with art created from this basic impulse, the greatest literature... the most beautiful music.<eos> The study of sex is the study of the beginning of all life, and science holds the key.<eos> Yet we sit huddled in the dark like prudish cavemen, filled with shame and... and...guilt... when the truth is, nobody understands sex.<eos> And now nobody will.
With all due respect, I'm not looking for your advice on how to handle this.<eos> I'm telling you what my associates and I think the best way forward is.<eos> Is it risky?<eos> Yes.<eos> Welcome to kidnapping.<eos> Do it.<eos> It's done.<eos> $10 million.<eos> (Voice breaking) What if he doesn't call?<eos> He will.
You can't, you just ate.<eos> I don't care, I want to die of congestion.<eos> - If you die, I will too.<eos> - I don't care.<eos> You know, right?<eos> You can't always get out of everything with hugs, let go of me.<eos> - I won't let go.<eos> - Serena, let go of me.<eos> - Let go of me!<eos> - I won't.
It's normal that I want to know his intentions.<eos> I don't want him to think he's holding us.<eos> Hello and goodbye.<eos> I'm moving out.<eos> We can see that.<eos> Miss Arletty bought me two songs.<eos> I'll live somewhere else.<eos> I'll be on the radio.<eos> Will you listen to me?<eos> I will, like anybody else.
You are?<eos> Ugh!<eos> How are you not more together?<eos> You know, Sonia, I hope it works out with you and Danny.<eos> But if it's not him, it's gonna be someone.<eos> You will be happy.<eos> I don't see myself being happy.<eos> I self-sabotage.<eos> Well, now that you recognize that tendency, maybe you can change.<eos> But I won't.
Don't take it.<eos> We'll be in federal lockup by Friday.<eos> Well, nobody asked you, cracker.<eos> You got one minute.<eos> Clyde Barrow, if anything's meant to be between us,<eos> I think it better start being now.<eos> (clicks)<eos> It's empty.<eos> Well, I didn't know that.<eos> And neither will they.
Gloria Delgado?<eos> I'm here!<eos> Conspiring to promote prostitution.<eos> How do you plead?<eos> - Not guilty, your honor.<eos> - Oh, good.<eos> It's you.<eos> Your majesty. I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> But I will say that I am guilty if I can just pay the fine and go home.<eos> No, you won't.
Plane's ready whenever we are.<eos> Annie.<eos> Annie, you're coming with us to Washington.<eos> Okay, you can get a flight from there to Paris.<eos> I don't know...<eos> Ade and Navid...<eos> Go.<eos> Navid and I are fine.<eos> We have each other.<eos> We always will.
That's the guy I want to be.<eos> Now I'm here to say that I don't care how hard it is, it's what I want.<eos> Because what we have is worth it.<eos> Annie, I love you... and I always have.<eos> Annie Wilson, will you marry me?<eos> Oh, my God, are you serious?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And it's romantic as hell, and I'm not taking no for an answer this time.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Thank you.<eos> Tough couple of days.<eos> You crossed a line, Dino.<eos> I'm sorry you feel that way.<eos> How I feel... isn't the point.<eos> How you understand your job, that is the point.<eos> Sometimes you're not gonna like yourself very much for the decisions you have to make; knowing how the men feel about the decision you made... but you're gonna have to make that tough decision again and again because that is the job you accepted.<eos> I get that.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> But you will.
You needn't if you don't want to.<eos> Are you determined to put me off?<eos> OK! Well, if that's what you want.<eos> So shall we?<eos> I don't see why not.<eos> Why not what?<eos> Some of us are going on to the Embassy later.<eos> Oh, what fun.<eos> Oh, well, you can come, if you'd like.<eos> I will.
Well, when I decided to go to Rose's ball, I felt it was wrong not to tell you, since you'd asked.<eos> What changed your mind?<eos> I suppose it came to me that these balls and presentations and comings out are not just aristocratic folderol but traditions by which members of this family measure their progress through life.<eos> And you wanted to be part of that?<eos> Well, I felt by dismissing it as trivia, I was being smug and intolerant.<eos> Do they know what they have in you?<eos> I know what I have in them.<eos> So, have you decided whether or not you will come to the ball?<eos> Oh, how can you ask?<eos> Of course I will!
If that's okay, I mean.<eos> Oh... Well, I mean, I saw you with two ladies.<eos> I thought you were with them.<eos> Never seen 'em before.<eos> So... cool to crash?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Freddy, he was my partner, and he was my friend, but he wouldn't be dead if it weren't for this dome.<eos> You're gonna have to tell Rusty.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> Like hell he will!
Are you stealing insulin?<eos> You yourself said you only had a week's supply left.<eos> Alice, look what happened today.<eos> We almost ran out of antibiotics for everyone.<eos> What happens when we run out?<eos> Okay, what's going on?<eos> You're not acting like yourself.<eos> I-I'm scared.<eos> What if the dome lasts forever?<eos> It won't.
That's fancy.<eos> Better unpack my suit.<eos> Anything else on your end?<eos> Just the new Mossad director.<eos> Orli has a long- standing history of not playing by the rules.<eos> I would not trust her unless she earns it.<eos> Get some rest.<eos> Let's be careful out there.<eos> McGee.<eos> We will.
Your real middle name is Leslie.<eos> Your hacker handle was "Lord Zolton."<eos> You used to visit David Clarke in prison, which means you undoubtedly believe I played a role in his demise.<eos> Look, will you help me or not?<eos> I think I'll pass.<eos> Uh, how about, uh...<eos> We play for it?<eos> I win, you do the job for me.<eos> - And when I win?<eos> - You won't.
No. I have evidence.<eos> That's what I've been doing for the past weeks-- Learning about flora's life. And lying to us.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> So if your son didn't kill flora hernandez, who did?<eos> I think it was phillipe delatour.<eos> But I'm gonna need help from all of you To prove it.<eos> The caterers should be doing that.<eos> Oh, it's all right. I need to keep busy.<eos> If you need any help...<eos> I won't.
That's good!<eos> I was really worried about you.<eos> As well you should be.<eos> You're the reason I fell.<eos> No, not true.<eos> You may have gotten distracted while I was talking.<eos> You were spewing vile rumors about a dead woman, trying to shock me.<eos> Now, that's just silly.<eos> I don't think so.<eos> And neither will Nicholas.
I'm sorry.<eos> What?<eos> I know the truth now.<eos> You are bad.<eos> So I won't feel guilty.<eos> And I'm gonna be happy...<eos> Very soon!<eos> Seriously, Rosie,<eos> I don't understand what you mean.<eos> You will.
- I don't know.<eos> I guess I thought it'd just stay like this and then eventually you'd move into mom and dad's room.<eos> I just can't believe you're really leaving.<eos> Bro, don't worry.<eos> I'll be home at Christmas to pick up my presents.<eos> And you can come visit me if you want.<eos> Might even need you to do some of my homework.<eos> I'm really gonna miss you, Axl.<eos> I know, Brick.<eos> Everyone will.
lied about you, you and your mom are doing well?<eos> Do not.<eos> - You arguing with her before.<eos> - Ahsha ...<eos> - Why not talk about it?<eos> - Because I will not.<eos> I will. Be be honest.<eos> You will save people, but I will not be saved.<eos> You can not handle, you want to sleep with me.<eos> - No, I will not.
Billy, here, has an announcement to make.<eos> Wendy, there's something I want to ask you.<eos> Oh, do you want to have sex again?<eos> Oh, she's a keeper, son.<eos> She's a keeper.<eos> Yes, of course I want to have sex with you.<eos> But it's more important than sex.<eos> Wendy...<eos> Get your drunk ass back here now!<eos> Will you...
Damn it!<eos> Broke my nose, man!<eos> I'm gonna need a doctor!<eos> Why don't you tell us where they're going?<eos> I don't know.<eos> This was Wayne's show.<eos> He wanted somebody to slow you down so he could get away, and I volunteered.<eos> Anything to get away from that madman.<eos> I ain't trying to die out here.<eos> Now you won't.
Okay. So, what do we do?<eos> Where's your phone?<eos> We're gonna call Gene.<eos> You're gonna tell him you're sorry.<eos> You're gonna tell him you know what he did.<eos> But you haven't told anyone he has Christian.<eos> What?<eos> You're gonna tell him you two can work this out together.<eos> What if he doesn't believe me?<eos> He will.
It's my fault.<eos> I finally found someone who's right for me and I drove her away.<eos> Raj.<eos> Penny I miss her already.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> I miss Leonard too.<eos> What's...?<eos> What is wrong with me?<eos> Why can't I ever have love?<eos> - You will.
Though I-I'm no great fan of montage.<eos> I don't suppose you've read André Bazin,<eos> "The Ontology Of The Photographic Image"?<eos> I'm waiting for the movie.<eos> It's pretty theoretical.<eos> Pseudorealism versus true realism.<eos> What's the difference?<eos> Honestly, I have no idea.<eos> You know, the film you're shooting won't survive a nuclear attack.<eos> Nothing will.
They're ___. N___.<eos> The ___.<eos> One ___.<eos> I ___.<eos> I ___, and ___.<eos> Take ___.<eos> I ___ in ___.<eos> And ___ to ___.<eos> The ___.<eos> They ___. They'll ___.
He's an imaginary monster that lives in the basement.<eos> It's a ghost story they all tell each other.<eos> Creak isn't just a story!<eos> Tell me more about this Creak.<eos> You have been making accusations about my hospital...<eos> Abuse...<eos> The blue medicine.<eos> It's time for you to forget.<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
Is it weird that I'm worried I might not get one?<eos> Girlfriend, loosen up your poodle skirt.<eos> Matty is not gonna leave you lacking.<eos> As outdated as the tradition was, there was something about being outed by your date that was...<eos> - Is Jenna Hamilton here?<eos> - Sweet.<eos> But in my excitement to be a have, I'd forgotten about the girls who were still have-nots, like Kiki Reynolds and Mia Brady and Kristy Patton.<eos> I knew what it was like to be bare-chested.<eos> Jenna Hamilton, will you be... [Laughs] Matty's girl?<eos> Yes, I will.
I didn't tell Matty.<eos> I just maybe told Jake. But Jake and I--<eos> Tell each other everything.<eos> I've heard.<eos> But your sharing is getting back to my relationship.<eos> Please stop talking to Jake about Matty and me.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine.<eos> Even if Jake wants to talk<eos> - about you or Matty, I won't.
What did it say?<eos> "I'm sorry." I kept it simple.<eos> Yeah, you got back together with her.<eos> What?<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> No way!<eos> She'll know what I meant.<eos> Okay.<eos> - She will!
- Thanks.<eos> - You all right?<eos> I should've shared that intel about Brody with you sooner.<eos> I'm sorry, I wasn't thinking.<eos> You've been to hell and back.<eos> I know how important this is to you.<eos> I owe you.<eos> We all do.<eos> Yeah, well, as long as we get the real bomber...<eos> We will.
That's the one thing the Chancellor did get right.<eos> And because you were weak, I went around you.<eos> I did use hospital exam rooms.<eos> I did use hospital equipment.<eos> And I used the money you thought I was using for infertility research on sex instead.<eos> In which case, Barton, you've been bamboozled by our lying, arrogant employee worse than I've been.<eos> I leave the honors to you.<eos> You know what needs to be done.<eos> I will continue my study at this hospital... no matter what you say today, no matter what you do.<eos> You won't, Bill.
Think about him.<eos> Think about the feelings you're getting.<eos> Describe it to me.<eos> It's a... It's a chill.<eos> I can't explain it, but it's like I can feel him.<eos> He's trying to reach out to me, but I don't know where he is, and I can't understand what he's trying to say.<eos> All I know is that he's scared, and he's lonely, and he's in a lot of pain.<eos> He's in a lot of pain.<eos> We have to find him.<eos> We will.
Get in there and get your dad.<eos> Looks like I don't have a choice.<eos> I told Michael to land, find alternate transport to Mumbai.<eos> We'll head back to D.C.<eos> Hey... This is gonna work.<eos> We're gonna save him, I promise.<eos> The DNA was a perfect match.<eos> You handled yourself well.<eos> What happens when I refuse to cooperate?<eos> You won't.
I had to do something.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> If you think I'm going anywhere without Lizzie and Mica...<eos> If you want them to leave, to go out there with you?<eos> Lizzie's sick.<eos> Mica is 10 years old.<eos> She can't.<eos> We'll keep them safe.<eos> You're gonna start over, find others, people who don't know, and you're gonna survive out here.<eos> You will.
I just wanted Randall for myself.<eos> I forgot to tell you...<eos> you're out of O.J. sorry.<eos> Well, you probably needed it after last night.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I shouldn't have barged in on you like that.<eos> Thanks for not throwing me out on my ass.<eos> Do me a favor?<eos> Don't tell Kate.<eos> I won't.
-You...<eos> -I must sleep.<eos> I'm up early.<eos> Sleep well.<eos> Clott!<eos> Cloette is coming!<eos> -It was too big!<eos> -Take a big gulp of water.<eos> When David comes on Saturday, make beef stew.<eos> David will not.
I've got like two weeks left on my lease, so it's not that I'm desperate, but I've had to modify my CV to a blank piece of paper saying, "I clean," written again and again in marker pen.<eos> - I'm sure something will come up.<eos> - I do do other things with my time, though.<eos> I'm doing a collection of, like, William Blake-style lithographs depicting my entire sexual history, but on Tumblr.<eos> Wh-what's that?<eos> It's like a blog.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> It's just an ironic gesture of how romance is outdated.<eos> I haven't really worked it out yet.<eos> Well, you will. You will.
They're there now!<eos> Now?<eos> Yes!<eos> Then why don't we open the door and see?<eos> No.<eos> We could do it together.<eos> No!<eos> You're safe, I promise.<eos> Please don't leave me!<eos> No, I won't.
Do you wanna see the e-mails you sent me while you were with him?<eos> I'm never gonna get it.<eos> So the small favor you can do for me is not saying something as inane as, "You forgot you were mad at me."<eos> Because sometimes, you're not as cute as you think you are.<eos> - You're right.<eos> - I want to know who leaked the story.<eos> The campaign's happy to announce the results of the latest New Hampshire Journal poll, which has Governor Romney in the lead with 37% of New Hampshire's likely Republican voters, well ahead of Rick Perry with 18%,<eos> Ron Paul with 14%, then Michele Bachmann and Herman Cain.<eos> You forgot about Huntsman, Gingrich, and Santorum.<eos> - And soon you will, too.
Oh! You know, I'd totally bust his chops, but they're simply beyond divine.<eos> You know, it's too bad you can't make it tonight, Holly.<eos> - Mm. - But you got a good reason.<eos> - That's right. - Mm-hmm.<eos> The best!<eos> You guys have fun.<eos> - Totally.<eos> - We will.<eos> I'll take your money next month.<eos> Oh, no, you will not!
He's my nephew.<eos> Uh, yes, this is my phone.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [Phone ringing]<eos> [Beeps]<eos> A little late.<eos> I believe I'm right on time, Michael.<eos> I thought we were gonna have a face-to-face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We will.
Get me ears on that call now.<eos> I'm trying, sir, but it looks like every call in the state is being routed through that tower, I can't just--<eos> Get the NSA on it, then.<eos> Get me on that call!<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You're changing the venue.<eos> There's a car waiting at the corner of Collins and 7th.<eos> It leaves in two minutes.<eos> - What if I don't make it?<eos> - You will.
- She obviously needs help.<eos> So what are you saying?<eos> Just put her over the line and that's it?<eos> - Yep.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You can't.<eos> She can't even walk.<eos> That's the most idiotic thing I've ever heard.<eos> - But they'll come.<eos> - No, they won't!
Okay, Briana.<eos> Remember how we have to talk in here.<eos> Jerry Stone, my boss, and the C.E.O. of Stone Quarry Enterprises, introduced me to Mark Hull.<eos> I had sex with Mr. Hull.<eos> He paid Jerry for that, and he tipped me $80.<eos> Did Jerry video me having sex with that guy like he did the others?<eos> Yes.<eos> Are you gonna watch that video?<eos> No.<eos> No, I won't.
- Really?<eos> - They'll have sex for days.<eos> Ooh, for days.<eos> Right?<eos> You don't gotta eat their pussy or nothing.<eos> That's... a refreshing change.<eos> Down-to-earth.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> Well, look, why don't you come down sometime and we'll find you a slump-buster, all right?<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
It's Anna.<eos> No...<eos> Andrew!<eos> No!<eos> Just take...<eos> No, no, please. No.<eos> It's like I'm not really here.<eos> I can't even feel things with my hands properly.<eos> None of it makes sense, Andrew.<eos> Never will, will it?
For now, I can get you whatever you want.<eos> What do you like to do?<eos> Draw.<eos> An artist, huh?<eos> That's cool. OK.<eos> I can buy out Vincent's for you tomorrow, maybe get you some curtains or-- Marcel... you know what I really want?<eos> I want to make them pay.<eos> I'm pleased you stayed.<eos> You'll keep your promise about your mother's spell book?<eos> I will.
But they were Polish.<eos> What difference does that make?<eos> - It's even worse. You don't get it?<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Germans are everywhere.<eos> Apartments are to be divided.<eos> The Jews are all exterminated and we'll be next.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I promise they won't come again.<eos> They won't.
You run toward them...<eos> and fix them.<eos> Of course.<eos> That's what you do for the people you love.<eos> Why do you keep dealing those?<eos> It's not going to change.<eos> There's got to be a way.<eos> The girls have never lived this long before.<eos> I don't think I can take losing them again.<eos> We won't.
Let me lighten your load.<eos> What do you fancy, Prince Filipe?<eos> - You do not waste time. - Oh...<eos> Time is a game played beautifully by children.<eos> - I hate children.<eos> - Hmm... wise man.<eos> Let's begin.<eos> A blindfold?<eos> Please, I've came so far to see your petals in bloom.<eos> And you will, you will.
And what's in it for me, other than a death sentence from Pan when you're gone with your boy?<eos> You can come with us.<eos> That's right.<eos> A home. That is what you want, isn't it?<eos> Listen closely.<eos> Pan trusts me. He'll let me in.<eos> And maybe, just maybe, I'll leave a way open for you.<eos> But you've only got one shot, so you better have a good plan.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We will.
You can tell me anything.<eos> When I heard you might be here, and that you might still be alive, I knew I should be happy, but I wasn't.<eos> I was terrified.<eos> I didn't understand why until now.<eos> From the moment I saw you in New York, in the instant you stepped back in my life, I knew.<eos> I knew I'd never stopped loving you.<eos> And before I even had a chance to take a breath, I... I lost you once more, and all that pain that I had pushed down for all those years, it just came... rushing back, and I...<eos> I didn't know if I could go through it again.<eos> I love you.<eos> I probably always will.
They're hosting that charity event for the school at their house.<eos> We are gonna charity the shit out of them, you guys.<eos> They are going to love us for it.<eos> Well, while you guys are desperately trying to become the couple that the Cutlers hate the least, I'd like you to see what the newest member of our league is up to.<eos> Not only will he not throw the game or give up control of Taco's team, but now he's posting.<eos> This is Taco and I will be victorious on the battlefield.<eos> Hey, Taco. Hey, Andre, I have one question for you.<eos> Did you ever have to tell a friend that his dick was blown off and then you realize it wasn't your friend, it was you?<eos> You don't know what it means to lose.<eos> But you will.
The roads are frozen. So are the motor cars.<eos> I'll hike!<eos> And risk being murdered?<eos> What? Quentin may have arranged us in neat numbers for now, but I'm sure if he saw you, he wouldn't hesitate to kill out of sequence.<eos> PRUDENCE: Oh, my God. We need to stay inside.<eos> Especially you, Mrs Stanley.<eos> No doubt he wants to finish the job.<eos> To kill me?<eos> Yes. Well, supposing he gets inside?<eos> He won't.
You kill people.<eos> Listen to me... Fucking murderer!<eos> You kill people.<eos> Fucking murderer!<eos> Fucking murderer!<eos> You kill people!<eos> I won't be alone.<eos> It can't happen!<eos> If the police take you...<eos> They won't.
-Well, then, open a window.<eos> -I don't have a window!<eos> We can't lose our history.<eos> Without our past, we have no future.<eos> Well, white vinegar should clean it off, and if that doesn't work, you can always try Borax.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll try that.<eos> You'll have to find out where the damp's coming from as well.<eos> I will.
No. Dawson's looking for her now.<eos> If she shows up, get in touch, okay?<eos> Sure thing.<eos> - No luck?<eos> - She comes here every day, but they said that they haven't seen her since Tuesday.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm running out of ideas.<eos> I promised Severide that I'd find her, but...<eos> - What if I can't?<eos> - You will.
It sounds like Vincent just took a huge step backwards.<eos> I know.<eos> That's what has me worried.<eos> It's gonna be hard to save him if he can't save himself.<eos> You still think he's the last beast on the list?<eos> I'm not sure.<eos> If he is, he's running out of time, too.<eos> You sure you don't want to try kickboxing?<eos> It's more cathartic.<eos> Maybe I will.
How's it going there?<eos> Good, good.<eos> I let everyone know we're out of guns, what our plans are.<eos> They all get it.<eos> - Every charter's on board.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, Lowen just arrived.<eos> And get home safe.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Now, tell me, what are your phone needs?<eos> My needs are simple.<eos> I need a phone that can draw a mustache on people and occasionally will call my mother and hang up.<eos> And she needs one with a good camera, because I have to film my video pitch for new pants.<eos> You know you're supposed to, right?<eos> Max, I might be a virgin again.<eos> I love my new phone!<eos> It's so cool and red.<eos> It feels like anything could happen!<eos> But it probably won't.
"Scorch."<eos> "Scorch?" Are you joking?<eos> Have you ever heard of Steve Rogers?<eos> But Captain America, now, he's on the news, and a lunchbox, and a poster on the wall.<eos> I don't want to be a superhero.<eos> You want to be recognized for your gift.<eos> And who is more recognizable than them?<eos> I was given this power for a reason.<eos> I just want people to see what I can do.<eos> They will.
You could invite that boring girl.<eos> Unless... did you not call her 'cause she's so boring and you're the picky one?<eos> I don't... just...<eos> It's our schedules and, you know, phone tag.<eos> I don't have the bells and whistles phone plan with night minutes, I don't have it.<eos> Why don't you call her from here?<eos> We'll all go out to dinner.<eos> Fantastic. Tell your guy to wear his fanciest dress shorts.<eos> Okay. Tell Mary to bring aersolity.<eos> I will.

I don't care. At least I can-- at least I can visit you and I can write you letters.<eos> Why?<eos> All I ever do is lie and I screw up.<eos> That is all-- that is all I ever do.<eos> No.<eos> There was no job in Mexico.<eos> There was nothing.<eos> I'm nothing.<eos> I don't want to leave you.<eos> I won't.
We could do a lot of things that... That I haven't done.<eos> There's lots of things I want to do and I want to do them while I'm still young enough to enjoy doing them.<eos> Do you know I've never been out of the country?<eos> Mom, I had no idea you were thinking about all this stuff.<eos> Why would it even occur to you?<eos> Joel.<eos> He never shut you out.<eos> Listen, um, don't mention this to the others, okay?<eos> Everyone is so emotional about this house.<eos> No, I won't.
Lily, that's actually good.<eos> Can you really do makeup?<eos> Stay there.<eos> Is it really too much to ask that you consult me before you make such a big decision?<eos> Claire, when you went back to work, you asked me to take the reins.<eos> So I think you need to trust me now.<eos> Do you really think I'd put Luke in a dangerous situation?<eos> He's my favorite, which I did not just say.<eos> - If anything happens to him --<eos> - It won't.
Stay with Skye.<eos> You remember Skye, right?<eos> Keep him safe.<eos> Take care of my boy!<eos> Where's Coulson?<eos> - We land in half an hour.<eos> - Good.<eos> The sooner we begin, the better.<eos> Whatever this is, whatever you think you're doing, it won't work. I won't give you what you want.<eos> You will.
- I-I can't. I can't.<eos> Hey, Tampa!<eos> - Rayna! - I'm so happy to see you.<eos> Listen.<eos> I love a rowdy crowd.<eos> I really do.<eos> And I love y'all so much, but I don't like booing' too much.<eos> I think that's kinda rude.<eos> I've always thought of you as family.<eos> I always will.
Oh, now you see?<eos> Now, that's just a spin.<eos> Now, you see, Autocar, that's oversteer.<eos> Sometime you read road tests and you do think, "What are you on about?"<eos> It's a really nice car and you can get the arse out.<eos> Finally.<eos> - Still pretending to have fun?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Will, uh, will Poo be like this?<eos> - Will what?
Protect the children!<eos> Hurry UP-<eos> Quickly.<eos> Protect the children!<eos> Be careful.<eos> Don't be afraid.<eos> Sister!<eos> Eko.<eos> Bill- promise me that... you'll protect all the children.<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm not gonna apologize for wanting him dead.<eos> But you gotta believe me.<eos> I... I never meant for an innocent man to die.<eos> Conrad put Father Paul in that car, not you.<eos> You tried to spare me from a monster.<eos> It was an act of pure selflessness, and one I will always cherish.<eos> So what now?<eos> Does Conrad know?<eos> No.<eos> He never will.
Yeah, I used to do work for the owner.<eos> Freelance acquisitions.<eos> What kind of acquisitions?<eos> Fine.<eos> Stay put till I get back.<eos> Wait.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> Do you see these people?<eos> They don't understand.<eos> Hopefully they never will.
Hey, if it was the case then Tan would have hit Chan Young. Hey!<eos> My Chan Young is good in fighting, you know!<eos> And don't take Kim Tan's side!<eos> Don't take Yoo Rachel's side!<eos> Just like there's no way to prove that I was in my dream... To me, that place is like that.<eos> Was I really in that place?<eos> You were there, I can attest to that.<eos> Hey! You didn't log out?<eos> Do you really want be be logged-out of life?<eos> Yeah, I won't.
Looks like they're about to rekindle their past.<eos> Then I have to make sure they have no future.<eos> Secrecy causes even the simplest truth to seem wondrous, mysterious.<eos> It has the power to fuel passion and seduce you into becoming someone you're not.<eos> We should get going soon.<eos> You did tell your parents I was coming, right?<eos> Or that I exist?<eos> I thought we'd surprise them.<eos> But what if your mother hates me?<eos> She won't.
But someone came after me.<eos> I don't blame him, he was doing his job.<eos> He sold my debts to Tom Weston.<eos> And now Weston gives me a choice - become his mistress or face prison.<eos> Oh, no, please!<eos> I don't want your pity,<eos> I want your company.<eos> Tomorrow night at the Three Crowns?<eos> Won't you come and drink with me?<eos> I bloody will.
Hard to tell which one to kill first.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> You. You first.<eos> Stay away from them.<eos> Well, how about this?<eos> The worm has teeth.<eos> What, you're here to pwotect your wuved ones?<eos> I'm not going to let you touch either one of them.<eos> Oh, and I'd like to see that.<eos> Oh, you will.
I never stopped wearing it.<eos> I'm glad you're here.<eos> You don't know what it means to hear you say that.<eos> Federal Agent Rossabi.<eos> I know that you've been colluding with Annie Walker.<eos> When I'm done you're gonna be back in a prison cell.<eos> Did you sanction a CIA black Ops team to torture Teo Braga with full knowledge that he was your husband's son?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Did your husband know that?<eos> - He will now.
My ass is on the line.<eos> You understand what that means, right?<eos> This don't work, it ain't<eos> "we don't do no more business together" bad. It's "kill my girlfriend and kid" bad.<eos> Where's the meet?<eos> The Bishop wants to meet your cook at pier four in the Defense District, in one of those old abandoned buildings.<eos> It makes sense.<eos> It's isolated, discreet.<eos> This whole thing only works if The Bishop turns up in person, you understand that?<eos> Yeah, he'll the.
I could buy you lunch.<eos> Or a cheeky bottle of Sauvignon Blanc.<eos> You need two referees.<eos> One from the course you are leaving now and one from the course you were on before.<eos> Wasn't that the one that they asked you to leave because you were drunk and you cut a hole in a woman's face?<eos> There was an incident of a... particular nature.<eos> The nature of which I cannot recall the details of.<eos> Or you could get a reference from me.<eos> Oh, nice one!<eos> But you won't.

I am not an ugly duckling.<eos> I'm a swan.<eos> And a surgeon... a freaking kick ass surgeon... who, by the way, has had sex before.<eos> Does daddy know?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're fired as my bridesmaids, all three of you.<eos> I don't want a single one of you standing up for me at my wedding.<eos> Honey, don't be silly.<eos> You have to have bridesmaids.<eos> And I will.
Then revived.<eos> There is but one mortal...<eos> With such a curious fate.<eos> You are Ichabod Crane.<eos> We've waited centuries for this moment.<eos> It was foretold...<eos> That your arrival would seal our fate.<eos> Seal your fate?<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Seriously? Cos if that's your own, you should work that up into a novel or something.<eos> So, now, you need to be aware that taking drugs as part of a medical trial does have risks, however small those may be.<eos> Dude, I've gobbled blank pills knocked out by rudeboys in gas masks.<eos> I go to un-franchised fried chicken outlets.<eos> I think I can handle a little bit of medical testing.<eos> Will it definitely come up?<eos> They're meeting for a big chat, JP.<eos> Ooh, big chat.<eos> No-one likes a big chat.<eos> Still, maybe it won't.

You will never be a monster to me.<eos> I will die of sadness if I am never to look upon your face again.<eos> Please.<eos> I am cursed.<eos> This cannot be!<eos> I must flee.<eos> If the guards catch me, they will kill me.<eos> Where will you go?<eos> How will I find you?<eos> You won't.
I'll never go to prom with you.<eos> I'd rather be thrown into the ocean wearing a speedo made of meat.<eos> - Silence!<eos> - No, you silence.<eos> Don't you dare tell me to silence.<eos> Okay, then shut up.<eos> You can have the Asians back, but I wanna negotiate my own terms.<eos> That is so cute.<eos> Now shut your silly little mouth, or you will never see Fred again.<eos> In fact, no one will.
Take this.<eos> Put it on shuffle.<eos> I thought you were over it.<eos> I'm over him, but not over it.<eos> I kind of thought it was the same thing.<eos> Yeah, I did, too.<eos> But I just found out that it's not.<eos> I'm sorry, Jeremy.<eos> - Call me sometime?<eos> I will.
That's bullshit, that's just words. it's nothing.<eos> If that were true, you would have cut back on the touring.<eos> - You would have paid more attention to what was going on with me.<eos> Not always looking for a perfect goddamn fingering to a Haydn quartet.<eos> I did the best I could.<eos> I tried to be a good mother to you.<eos> I wanted to be perfect, but this is a musician's life.<eos> We rehearse and we practice and we perform.<eos> Unfortunately, that's how it's going to be for you, too, you'll see.<eos> No, I won't.
- Can I have copies of all this?<eos> I'm standing outside the Ann Arbor Courthouse, where Sharon Solarz entered a plea of not guilty.<eos> Judge Panameno remanded her without bail.<eos> - Mr. Osborne, can I speak to you?<eos> - Not now.<eos> Not talking to me is a very dangerous decision for you right now.<eos> Not here.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> - Look, if I don't hear from you soon...<eos> - You will.
He stuck cheese from your coat.<eos> Just try to win.<eos> Maybe you can.<eos> Maybe I can, I am smart you know?<eos> You can hunt.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's to protect you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You can't turn out again.<eos> I won't
I wish I could've done something.<eos> Done something?<eos> Jack, you stood up to Pitch.<eos> You saved us!<eos> But Sandy...<eos> Would be proud of what you did.<eos> I don't know who you were in your past life.<eos> But in this life, you are Guardian.<eos> But how can I know who I am until I find out who I was?<eos> You will.
Looks like it's your fear they smell.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Are you ready now, Jack?<eos> To make it official.<eos> Then is time you take Oath.<eos> Will you, Jack Frost, vow to watch over the children of the world, to guard them with your life, their hopes, their wishes, and their dreams, for they are all that we have, all that we are,<eos> and all that we will ever be?<eos> I will.
The sooner she settles back into her life, her normal routine, the better.<eos> Starting in a week or so, I'm gonna recommend that Paige see a neural psychologist.<eos> - Okay. - Whatever she needs.<eos> Therapy, specialists, I'll make sure she gets the best.<eos> You'll come home where I can take care of you.<eos> Mom can make up your old room, and I can take some time off work.<eos> I don't mean to be disrespectful, 'cause we really appreciate that, but you just heard Paige's doctor say that she needs to go back to her normal routine.<eos> Her life with me is her normal routine.<eos> Yes, but that's a life she doesn't remember.<eos> She will.
Oh, my God, I can't believe I'm quoting anything from that silly little book.<eos> You tell Michael that you don't want to come in between him and his mother and that if he wants to continue dating you, then you must be a priority in his life.<eos> She's had him his whole life.<eos> I can't compete with that.<eos> Well, then dump the first man you've met in three years that genuinely cares about you and Duke.<eos> Wait a minute, there's no such thing as a perfect man, right?<eos> What do you have to lose?<eos> Isn't that what you've been preaching to me all night?<eos> Okay.<eos> I will if you will.
Yeah. What do you mean?<eos> Anybody can come.<eos> Of course. Jews are welcome.<eos> Well, yeah.<eos> Why wouldn't they be?<eos> Exactly, that's what I'm saying.<eos> Why even bring that up?<eos> You don't bring it up, you just let them in.<eos> Why mention it?<eos> No one will.
- Thanks for staying up with me.<eos> - Sure.<eos> My brother said Penn State has this restaurant called Ye Olde College Diner.<eos> You have to get a grilled stickie on your first night.<eos> It's a tradition.<eos> - That sounds like fun.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Pretty soon, you'll have a whole new group of friends, you know.<eos> You won't even think about this place anymore.<eos> Yes, I will.
- The way he planned<eos> - You need to love your sister<eos> - Like he said<eos> - You need to love your brother<eos> - Like he said<eos> - So let's help each other<eos> - Like he said<eos> And live<eos> I hope you get the message<eos> Where you won't Somebody will
It's about freezing.<eos> Freezing?<eos> Think you might want to think about freezing the eggs.<eos> The eggs?<eos> My eggs?<eos> Yes, those eggs.<eos> Come on, Mom.<eos> I am not gonna have children anytime soon.<eos> Well, exactly my point.<eos> You will.
Lily!<eos> In there, baby.<eos> There you go.<eos> Come on!<eos> No!<eos> No!<eos> Come on! Let's go!<eos> No!<eos> We have to help them!<eos> You will.
Is that you, Ines?<eos> I said... Don't play with fire! You'll get burned!<eos> It doesn't hurt?<eos> It won't hurt me?<eos> Oh God, my dear!<eos> What happened?<eos> 50 hours in surgical room. That's crazy.<eos> Even for you.<eos> Do you think he will forgive me?<eos> He will.
Look,<eos> There's the paperwork to have him taken into care.<eos> You really want a lawyer?<eos> You wanna go that way?<eos> Just dial 9 for an outside line,<eos> Yes, the IRA does continue to insist it's serious about peace, but a lot of people are going to find that hard to credit when the organisation appears to be trying to send young men and women over here to place bombs on the London transport network.<eos> And now the police have issued this photograph of the alleged bomber tonight. It is a little indistinct. It was taken from the security camera before she went into that tunnel, but they hope that someone will recognise her from it.<eos> They'll kill me,<eos> They'll never know.<eos> They will,
They broke down the wall!<eos> - Run.<eos> - They got in.<eos> They broke down the Romanos wall, your majesty.<eos> You have to get out of here.<eos> We have to go back to the palace.<eos> You should stay in a safe place until we repel them.<eos> Remember you told me to tell your fÄ±ancĂ©.<eos> And you go to my family-<eos> I will.
Are you Ase?<eos> Ase Evensen?<eos> It's me.<eos> Katrine!<eos> - Are you still awake?<eos> - Yes, she's only now gone to sleep.<eos> You should have brought her to me.<eos> You need to rest.<eos> I won't pass the next exam anyway.<eos> - Of course you will.
- Demo.<eos> - What of? How to be spackers?<eos> Demo tape.<eos> - Is it any good?<eos> - Of course!<eos> We're the second best band in the world.<eos> No one's heard it.<eos> Dodge has been a proper tape Nazi.<eos> He won't play it to no one.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Where is she?<eos> Get me help first, and I'll tell you.<eos> If you tell me where she is, I won't shoot you again.<eos> But you have five seconds.<eos> You stupid bitch, she's alive.<eos> She's under your house.<eos> She's been there the whole time.<eos> My God. Oh, my God.<eos> I told you the truth. You said you wouldn't shoot me.<eos> I won't.
- Just tell me, yes or no.<eos> I keep giving things away, but still no call about getting into the House.<eos> What call?<eos> If I have to do more, just tell me and I'll do it.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Be patient, don't rush things.<eos> I have plenty of patience, it's just that I've invested everything to get into the House.<eos> Only death has no remedy, everything else works out.<eos> - You want to get into that house?<eos> - Then you will.
Fear!<eos> How did we lose our freedom?<eos> Fear!<eos> Are we to lose the last vestiges of our humanity to fear?<eos> No<eos> The heavens tell me I'll die soon<eos> But I'm not afraid<eos> I want the heavens to know I, Refuse to die at the hands of a Han Chinese<eos> How could I die by the hands of one of our own?<eos> You won't
I love you.<eos> I love you so much, Track.<eos> - Man: Fall in!<eos> - I gotta go, Mom.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Just-Just another minute.<eos> No, I'm really sorry, but' I really gotta go.<eos> You're gonna do great tonight, okay?<eos> Thank you, thank you, but, sweetie- sweetie, you be safe.<eos> I will.
Don't you think about her any more?<eos> Sweetheart, I will always think about your mom.<eos> Sometimes it's hard for people to keep things that remind them of someone who's gone.<eos> Sometimes, they just wanna make it through the day without feeling sad.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> When you say "people," you mean you, right?<eos> Yeah. I mean me.<eos> I worry about forgetting.<eos> - Mom had such a great face.<eos> - Sweetheart, you won't.
No. I know.<eos> Come on. Maybe we can find some candles.<eos> Remind me I left those there. We might need them again.<eos> What are we gonna do?<eos> Well nothing's getting past those monster nails, right?<eos> - We just wait.<eos> - Until what?<eos> Until the storm ends.<eos> But what if it doesn't?<eos> - It will, sweetheart.
That guy was a trip?<eos> He made it feel like, I don't know. Like you and me were the last people left on this planet.<eos> And together we'll save the world.<eos> Where do you live, Nicole?<eos> Why? You want to come visit me?<eos> It's luxurious.<eos> I live in Bankhead, near the bus station.<eos> I'll come visit you.<eos> - You're sweet.<eos> - I will.
I mean, like she was just going to wake up and smile.<eos> I didn't go in. I...<eos> I just couldn't.<eos> Trevor, find Daddy, baby.<eos> He's over there by Mr. Benton.<eos> You really should come to the counseling group.<eos> The union has great people for us to talk to.<eos> I can't.<eos> Really. I...<eos> I will.
I was the one guy in your court. The one guy!<eos> I was your defender and your apologist, but no more.<eos> Charlie, I can do this.<eos> You're about to be questioned by a federal agency about piloting an airliner drunk. An airliner that crashed! And you continue to drink!<eos> What kind of crazy do you have to be to do that? I'm afraid of you.<eos> Okay, all right. Then let me stay with you. Let me stay with you.<eos> They're staking out all my houses anyway.<eos> I'll stay with you until, until...<eos> Until the hearing. I won't leave the house.<eos> I won't.

A trial.<eos> Then we'll see.<eos> How long?<eos> Whatever the law says.<eos> One month, two...<eos> I'm sorry. I can't.<eos> I have a 6-month contract here.<eos> My wife is pregnant.<eos> She'll understand.<eos> No, she won't.
Fucking dick.<eos> Do you no fucking understand, you prick? Eh?<eos> I just want to have my life! With my fucking family.<eos> You better tell me the truth or you're getting it.<eos> Did you follow me?<eos> HOW?<eos> On my motorbike across the road.<eos> Clancy told me to.<eos> - Have you told him yet?<eos> - No! And I will not.
You didn't kill him though, you ninny.<eos> We took him alive.<eos> A bit buggered, but alive.<eos> Want to see him?<eos> I'd better not, if you'll pardon me, sir.<eos> The devil might tempt me to finish him off...<eos> You can't forgive them, eh?<eos> Not in this world, or the next.<eos> Tell me, Chico, have you seen Corporal Percy about?<eos> No, nor will I, Major.
Here's Lisbon...<eos> This here is Torres Vedras.<eos> This is the first line of Torres.<eos> The vital one.<eos> 20 leagues of fortifications.<eos> 150 redoubts.<eos> 600 pieces of artillery.<eos> There's not even the eye of a needle for the French to get through.<eos> What if they do?<eos> They won't.
He's Vietnamese.<eos> So, anyway, you said you wanted some sex in it, so I guess they're having sex.<eos> Desist, brother.<eos> You know this will not help us.<eos> He sniffs the air.<eos> He says the single word...<eos> Gasoline.<eos> The hooker, she studied Vietnamese at Yale.<eos> I don't smell gas.<eos> You will.
She wants to be with someone whose best memory is of her.<eos> And apparently that someone is you!<eos> You cost me the election.<eos> Now it's time for payback...<eos> She wants to be with me.<eos> She loves me.<eos> She loves me!<eos> Ooh. My bad!<eos> Larry, I won't forget about this, you son of a...<eos> Now you will.
I went out for some painkillers, my head was about to explode.<eos> Feeling any better?<eos> Yes. Thanks a lot. Dr. Tapia's here.<eos> We'll be right back. Yes?<eos> Why didn't you pick up?<eos> I'm sorry, I thought the police might have your mobile.<eos> Nobody took my mobile.<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> Has she turned up?<eos> No, but she will.
Writing is my new outlet. You should be happy for me.<eos> If you say so.<eos> But Vanya say same thing about "Warcraft,"<eos> and then D.S.L. bill come...<eos> Yes, of course everything's set for tonight.<eos> There is nothing to worry about.<eos> I hope that's not overconfidence I hear in your voice.<eos> I don't need to remind you how sensitive an operation this is.<eos> If anyone finds out...<eos> Jack, they won't.
Johnny Ducks was sick.<eos> He didn't know what he was doing, and neither did you.<eos> Now's not the time to harbor grudges.<eos> But if you stay, you do things my way.<eos> Or you go to war with the Russians... and me.<eos> Coffee.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> I'm an alternate.<eos> Didn't get on the jury.<eos> You will tomorrow.
Oh, no.<eos> No, Mary, driving down's half the trip.<eos> You should come with me.<eos> We could... We could leave tomorrow.<eos> Or tonight.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Maybe I need a change of pace too.<eos> Thanks for the drink.<eos> Uh, call me. Let me know.<eos> I will.
Your shooter thought it was Judi Silver because she was wearing Judi's wig.<eos> You killed the wrong whore.<eos> That's why God made extra bullets.<eos> Judi can't hurt you.<eos> She doesn't know anything.<eos> Don't do this, Ike.<eos> It demeans both of us.<eos> You know how this works.<eos> I can't let you kill her.<eos> I won't.
But are you absolutely sure?<eos> I never forget a friend, son.<eos> No.<eos> Our Ike never gave me one red cent from you.<eos> Always a chance to rectify that situation, though.<eos> You like what you see?<eos> He knows.<eos> No.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> He won't.
I mean, come on.<eos> Do I have to do everything myself?<eos> Hey.<eos> Dad.<eos> Dad.<eos> I can hear him now.<eos> Logan.<eos> His first word was "Dad. "<eos> I wanna hear that again.<eos> You will.
Do you think the audience will?<eos> - She's kind of a hot mess.<eos> - Considering how she always gets up no matter how many times she's knocked down it's a pretty safe bet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Do you think Julian making the winning shot was too much?<eos> No, I loved it.<eos> I wanna tell the story.<eos> Your story.<eos> I wanna do it justice.<eos> You will.
I remember looking out the window and I saw him playing basketball by the pool.<eos> Somewhere between all the yelling and the next time I looked out he had disappeared.<eos> And, uh, I went outside and he was floating face down in the pool.<eos> And we didn't know how long he'd been out there.<eos> And, um Nathan pulled him in and eventually, he coughed and he cried but he was okay.<eos> And I felt like I had damaged him.<eos> I felt like the worst parent in the world.<eos> And it took me a really long time to forgive myself for that.<eos> But I did, eventually.<eos> And you will too.
That makes sense.<eos> We entered into contract.<eos> You, as agent, should understand that.<eos> Have you ever heard of a hold-out?<eos> Two wives, six kids.<eos> I'd milk every penny I could get. What...?<eos> No talking!<eos> Have you not heard of honor among thieves?<eos> We gave our word, Nathan Scott, that you would die.<eos> And so you will.
- Yeah?<eos> Except in your imagination.<eos> I couldn't help but notice that you've started writing something.<eos> Yes.<eos> All these horrors seem to inspire me.<eos> It's about a werewolf.<eos> Mary Shelley's got nothing on you.<eos> You're pretty smart, you know that?<eos> For all the good it does me.<eos> It will. At university.
Lied like a rug about her weight big time.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Jennifer Elizabeth Wyatt.<eos> 1642 Melvin Road, apartment 7.<eos> Organ donor.<eos> Born September 7th.<eos> And you said that she was honest about her weight.<eos> She put 126.<eos> I don't know about weight.<eos> Well, you will.
And from there to Husum.<eos> And then over the mud.<eos> You remember, Lore?<eos> Hamburg is far.<eos> If I don't go willingly, they will come and take me.<eos> Use the money first.<eos> There is jewellery in my big suitcase.<eos> Are you going to prison?<eos> You mustn't worry.<eos> I won't.
win Nationals, come back, graduate, and then just have a nice little church wedding performed by a rabbi with our nearest and dearest.<eos> And hopefully nobody will get tragically injured this time.<eos> You think we're gonna win Nationals?<eos> You know, our first Regionals and last year,<eos> I had this feeling, like we were just gonna win.<eos> But this year, nothing.<eos> I just really, really, want to win, though.<eos> If not for us, then for Mr. Schue.<eos> What if we go all this way, and Carmen just says no?<eos> She won't.
It's the ideal time to break ground.<eos> Now you and I don't believe in that malarkey, but the construction workers might.<eos> I've alerted the media. My signage is everywhere.<eos> You don't need a pastor to bless a shovel of sand.<eos> Ripp's an elder in the church. You know he can pray up a storm.<eos> Ripp's in Denver on business, and besides, the condos for Christian living is my passion, even more so now that the Lord spoke to Ripp and told him to tell me to put my condos in Meh-hee-ho.<eos> I'm trying to write a very difficult sermon series on the book of revelation.<eos> Pastor Tudor, pastor Tudor, pastor Tudor.<eos> Nobody understands revelations. Never have.<eos> Never will.
Why not try?<eos> You don't think I've considered it?<eos> Mother would never allow it.<eos> Suren and I would have to disappear.<eos> Two suitcases, 2 train tickets and never look back and she--<eos> She's not ready to give this up.<eos> You wouldn't have to run.<eos> Stay on Mother's good side.<eos> We can have what they have.<eos> And in a thousand years, we will.
Well, I don't think so.<eos> It's probably just a glitch.<eos> Say, weren't you on the Astraeus crew?<eos> Yeah, unfortunately as it turned out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're going to have to come with us.<eos> To where?<eos> Back where you belong.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Auditions?<eos> Say, that's a good-looking dummy.<eos> Who you calling a dummy, dummy? That's not polite.<eos> Neither is beating Daryl Hannah, but that didn't stop Jackson Browne.<eos> Okay, okay, I've seen enough.<eos> You open the show Sunday.<eos> Open the show?<eos> That's how we do it with new acts.<eos> You do well, you move up.<eos> And you probably will.
Okay, Nick, I'm calling the landlord. - Uh-uh.<eos> - This is ridiculous.<eos> Don't call the landlord. We don't need him here, and he's a jerk.<eos> See, here's an example.<eos> Maybe you never gave him the chance to show you what a great guy he is.<eos> Yeah, he's a terrible person.<eos> No, Jess. He sucks. Don't call the landlord, I'm serious.<eos> Hey, Kim, where should I put this... budget... report?<eos> - On the desk. - Yeah, um, okay.<eos> I'll just...
I pray you hang.<eos> I will supply the lumber for the gallows, and I will tie the knot on your rope.<eos> And when your neck snaps, I will rejoice as you are sent to boil in eternal damnation's hellfire!<eos> A Merry Christmas to you, too, sir.<eos> You all right, ma?<eos> You hear that?<eos> Hear what?<eos> Shh.<eos> They'll come from over there.<eos> Who will?
Nope.<eos> It's gonna be better.<eos> You are married to a Second Lieutenant now.<eos> Yes, and I am very proud of you.<eos> But we don't know where we're gonna live. We don't know where the kids are going to school.<eos> And I won't have any friends.<eos> Won't have any friends?<eos> What about Denise Sherwood? Frank's a Brigade Commander now.<eos> Denise isn't gonna have any time for me.<eos> Sure she will.
There's only nineteen names.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Number seven is fake. Betty Drillzer.<eos> Except for your signature supporting my run for city council!<eos> Fuck you!<eos> Never!<eos> Find someone else to sign it!<eos> Where?<eos> I'll sign it.<eos> You will?
Mm-hmm.<eos> Your whole family's getting along, and mine's totally messed up.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Phyllis took off.<eos> Look, just stay here, Char.<eos> Just stay with your aunt.<eos> No, I gotta go.<eos> My mom needs me.<eos> Okay, I'll come with you.<eos> We all will.
I gave you purpose.<eos> Without me, you're nothing.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Your 976th and 977th kill.<eos> How did you bake that so fast?<eos> - Is this wednesday?<eos> It's tuesday.<eos> Oh, Chris, look.<eos> These cakes show everything that's happened to us.<eos> And everything that ever will.
I got your text. What's going on?<eos> Follow me.<eos> David, you're scaring me.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's wrong is you're late.<eos> And the wine is getting warm.<eos> We have to stop doing this.<eos> We just started doing it.<eos> We have to figure out what we're doing.<eos> We will.
All I know is we need to make our wools soft or see Kingsbridge ruined.<eos> Father, you're always exaggerating.<eos> Possibly.<eos> But as head of the guild, it is my duty to engage in such problems.<eos> You'll find a way.<eos> How's Mother?<eos> Resting.<eos> It will take weeks for your letter to reach the queen and hear if she will<eos> - even accept your offer.<eos> - She will.
I mean, you didn't hit a single thing.<eos> Yeah, but Aunt Mel saw us.<eos> - No, she didn't.<eos> - Yes, she did.<eos> - I swear that was her car that we passed.<eos> - That was not her car.<eos> There are thousands of cars out there that look just like that, that are being poorly driven by blonde-haired women.<eos> - I can't do this any more.<eos> - How are you gonna learn how to drive, huh?<eos> Maybe I won't.
I don't suppose they'd let us be cellmates?<eos> We need progress, Nathan, or we're pulling the plug.<eos> - What's this? - It's progress.<eos> Nine digits?<eos> - You work in intelligence.<eos> Figure it out.<eos> For once, I'd like you to handle one of these meetings while I lurk in the shadows.<eos> - You couldn't lurk if you tried. - Heh.<eos> That number we gave her better pan out.<eos> It will.
Maybe you guys should spend a shift back here, see what it's like.<eos> Kind of like when you spend a night in your own guest room.<eos> Make sure it's up to scratch before you stick your mother-in-law in it.<eos> I don't have a mother-in-law.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't.<eos> Yeah, well, you might someday.<eos> You're right, McNally.<eos> Maybe I will someday.
I'm in.<eos> Oh, wait, no.<eos> I've got that date.<eos> I mean the dinner thing.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> Who with?<eos> No, nobody.<eos> He's just a... a guy.<eos> I'll cancel.<eos> No, you won't.
I thought it would be me.<eos> [ laughs ] small claims, just for the week.<eos> Still...<eos> I was sentenced to it.<eos> Still...<eos> You know what the definition of growth is?<eos> I do, but I can't remember --<eos> Recognizing the value of doing what you hate.<eos> I take it I won't be seeing you again For father's day this year.<eos> No, you will.
Succinct.<eos> I wanted to make sure that we were really together first, that this was gonna stick.<eos> You know how she is.<eos> Hence the abject terror.<eos> You wanna tell Chelsea about us?<eos> But I also know that she'll go home and open that always-gigantic mouth of hers around Ithaca, which means it's just a matter of time before our parents are sobbing over the phone, insisting how they always knew we'd work things out someday.<eos> So I wanted to make sure that... you wanna tell Chelsea too.<eos> I wanna say the right thing here.<eos> Well, don't by--<eos> - No, I won't.
Down with corporate greed!<eos> If you're not mad, you're not paying attention!<eos> Down with corporate greed!<eos> Hey!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Matthew Stone.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> This guy's bigger than Steve Jobs.<eos> A lot of people are going to feel this loss.<eos> At least one person won't.
I looked through the Book of Shadows, but there's nothing about contacting ghosts.<eos> You want to speak to the dead,<eos> I think I have just the thing.<eos> Nothing's happening.<eos> This is so lame.<eos> We're witches.<eos> It should work.<eos> Apparently not.<eos> But...<eos> Maybe this will.
Where are you?<eos> Close. I'm on Oak--<eos> Cassie?<eos> Mom?<eos> Drowning the demon is the only way to save Nick.<eos> Tonight isn't about you.<eos> It's a wake for Nick, and I loved him.<eos> John Blackwell is my father.<eos> Promise me that you will stay away from him.<eos> I will.
I'm sure.<eos> Roll up your sleeve.<eos> I can't believe we all got duped.<eos> I been wearing this thing for months.<eos> I feel like such a tool.<eos> Lying jerk!<eos> please.<eos> I don't know what to believe in anymore.<eos> Let's do this.<eos> will you?
You think we can stop this now?<eos> You know what, babe?<eos> Even when you're telling the truth, it sounds like a lie.<eos> Yeah, we can stop.<eos> I think I should find another place to live.<eos> I think you're a private person and I'm kind of worried that if I'm here and I see things that you're not used to people seeing, that you're going to like me less.<eos> You won't mean to, but I think that will happen, you know?<eos> A friend from rehab relapsed last night, went back into treatment.<eos> I don't want to do that.<eos> You won't.
Hank.<eos> OK.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> - OK.<eos> - But I want to see the crime scene before I interview the suspect, OK?<eos> Tell Ident to hold the scene.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure.<eos> Look, y-you, uh... you can't tell anybody else why you're doing this.<eos> I'll...
- ♪ You better lawyer up!<eos> - There's no lawyers<eos> - in small claims court.<eos> - What?<eos> - Then lawyer down, okay?<eos> - Yeah, so lawyer down.<eos> You know what?<eos> We're gonna see you in court, man.<eos> - See you there.<eos> - No, we will.
See you.<eos> I don't know what to tell you, Lloyd.<eos> Hey.<eos> Here's what you wanted me to write.<eos> Doesn't feel like you left anything out.<eos> It's good.<eos> And I have a copy, if you need it.<eos> You want me to read it?<eos> Not if you don't have to.<eos> Then I won't.
I think it's a baboon or a tree sloth.<eos> Nah, you're all wrong.<eos> It's a jaguar.<eos> He eats them raw because he think it gives him powers, so once he offers you what's in that bowl,<eos> The heart and major organs must be eaten to absorb the animal spirit.<eos> Hey, I like a good steak as much as the next guy, but...<eos> It's not enough to simply devour the flesh.<eos> You must believe.<eos> After everything you've seen, you believe, don't you?<eos> Sooner or later, you will.
These men are dangerous.<eos> I-I can't go back to them with nothing.<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> I'm not gonna let anything happen to you.<eos> Look...<eos> Maybe there's a way we could help each other out.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well... I could give you enough information to keep your bosses happy.<eos> What if the other cops find out?<eos> They won't.
I knew it.<eos> That is it.<eos> I'm going for way more than a slap.<eos> Hanna, stop.<eos> Stop why?<eos> !<eos> Don't look at me.<eos> I'm ready to hang a sign-- "Bitch can see."<eos> She doesn't know that we know.<eos> She will in a minute.
She's white, I'm sorry.<eos> I want a black African.<eos> If that's how it is, get married, have kids, stay with your wife.<eos> I won't see you any more.<eos> I don't like that.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> - How much for the hair?<eos> - 70 euros.<eos> "70 euros"?<eos> - You won't...
But we're going in giving full support for the E.R.P., right?<eos> With some caveats, delays, the usual bullshit, that's what we do.<eos> I don't know, man.<eos> What do you mean you don't know?<eos> We gotta have something right there.<eos> Motherfucker. I can feel my gastritis jacking up.<eos> Jonathan.<eos> You got a second?<eos> Don't forget who brought you in on this engagement.<eos> I will not.
Thanks for that thought.<eos> Seriously, though.<eos> If we don't find the exit door to this ride...<eos> I just want to say --<eos> Don't.<eos> Okay?<eos> We're gonna make it.<eos> We always do.<eos> But, Hal, what if we don't?<eos> We will.
- What are your moves?<eos> - We don't really have any.<eos> Oh, so you need me to help?<eos> Cool.<eos> Okay, first thing to know about guys like that is keep your sentences short.<eos> Don't mention Tolstoy or math, it will just make you sad.<eos> Oh, and it really helps if you have a car and an income,<eos> - 'cause that guy's got nothin'.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> And he never will.
Well, my husband was supposed to pick me up at 6:00 but he can be such an idiot.<eos> I'm sure he can.<eos> Where did you go to school, Devin?<eos> I had the best education in the world.<eos> Private kindergarten where I got straight check marks.<eos> Experimental boarding school in carmel where the students teach the teachers, and the teachers teach animals.<eos> Year abroad on an all-male catamaran.<eos> Then on to Northwestern where I majored in confidence.<eos> I had every educational advantage, Jack.<eos> Just like my children will.
Please.<eos> Tell us about Mallory.<eos> I'd gone home.<eos> Whenever he books a 5:00 p.m. audition,<eos> I just have to stay and greet, and then he lets me go.<eos> Okay, we're going to need a list of all his five o'clocks.<eos> Eddie's going to be upset.<eos> He doesn't have to know.<eos> If your boss is a good guy, we won't find anything.<eos> No, you-- you will.
- Call me when you land.<eos> - I will.<eos> Safe travels.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> For a very, very long time.<eos> It's only three weeks.<eos> All expenses paid.<eos> Jim's going to be there.<eos> That marriage is not good. Nobody knows better than me.<eos> Definitely we will.
She has the king Arthur of bad taste in men.<eos> I'm glad you guys are reacting this way.<eos> I need to be reminded that he is the worst on earth.<eos> Because if he comes through town and calls me,<eos> I will be there in five minutes.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> - Uh, Andre much?<eos> - Okay, I understand.<eos> - I don't.<eos> - You will.
The other bow.<eos> The one on her costume.<eos> We arrested the wrong man.<eos> What?<eos> I-I don't understand.<eos> So you're saying Darren didn't do it?<eos> Well, he's guilty of blackmail, but that's as far as it goes.<eos> So what if the killer's still out there?<eos> What if he comes after me?<eos> He won't.
Detective Murdoch, I-<eos> A! Ease, Constable. Save your strength.<eos> Was anyone else hurt, sir? There was so many women and children.<eos> Nothing serious.<eos> And George?<eos> It would appear he has a much harder head than you do.<eos> That's no surprise.<eos> Did you get the bomber, sir'?<eos> I've only just started looking.<eos> You will.
The law says that I have to accommodate you to the best of my ability, so if you want to stay, go wash dishes.<eos> Can't do much damage there.<eos> Yeah, I'd say sleeping with my brother's girlfriend is not handling things right!<eos> I just have never understood the obsession with marriage as an end game.<eos> - It's a piece of paper.<eos> - I order Mr. Sorrento returned to Italy.<eos> I just thought that we had some kind of future together.<eos> - I'm so sorry.<eos> - Will you take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> I... I will.
Previously on "Switched at Birth"...<eos> What the hell are you doing?<eos> Put the pin back in the grenade, angry girl.<eos> I'm just answering your piece.<eos> The law say that I have to accommodate you to the best of my ability, so if you want to stay, go wash dishes.<eos> Will you, Regina Teresa Vasquez, take this man to be your lawfully wedded husband?<eos> - I will.
Oh!<eos> I can't breathe!<eos> I can't find breath.<eos> Dallas?<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> Don't touch me!<eos> I feel confined!<eos> If something happens to that dog, I don't know what I'll do.<eos> I don't know how I'll press on.<eos> I won't!
Previously on The Client List<eos> Kyle left me, and I have no idea if he's ever coming back.<eos> Bobby just texted me, and he's thinking we should just look around here and get married.<eos> Well, whose are these, anyway?<eos> Dee Ann.<eos> Me?<eos> This guy I'm seeing...<eos> It's just fun.<eos> What if it turns serious?<eos> It won't.
Malory, I've done some messed up shit working for you, but I am not, repeat not, chopping up a dead body!<eos> What!<eos> My God, do you want me to get the electric chair?<eos> !<eos> For a murder you both know I didn't commit?<eos> !<eos> Malory, I just can't.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Can't?<eos> Or won't.
I had things to do.<eos> The box of tissues in your bedroom will still be there when you get back.<eos> - Go away!<eos> - You look gross from this angle.<eos> - You look gross from every angle.<eos> - Only two more days left of this and I'm free of catering to you.<eos> Adios.<eos> - You have mental problems.<eos> - So in two days he won't have to be your chauffeur anymore?<eos> Oh no, he will.
- Is that it?<eos> - Yeah, he does.<eos> Is this really the kind of guy you want to be your Packmaster?<eos> - Hell no. -<eos> - Fuck, yeah.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, which one of you's willing to be his second?<eos> Put your fucking meat where your bark is.<eos> I will.
- We'll probably get them down...<eos> - Just a minute.<eos> Would you be so kind to cancel my meetings the rest of the day?<eos> I will not and have never wanted pay 19 million dollars.<eos> With all due respect, I believe we're talking about ten million dollars.<eos> - Ten million dollars is nothing.<eos> - You might be right. But 19 million?<eos> Honestly there is way too much.<eos> Our latest bid is 19 million dollars.<eos> Gentlemen, we will certainly nowhere.
sitting at his house ready to grab him.<eos> Only one day.<eos> I-I-I can't wait that long.<eos> Bring Mr. Morris in.<eos> I want to have a chat with him.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> Brenda, you have to go back to work at this hour?<eos> Mama, I am so sorry, but I've got a deadline.<eos> Hmm, I thought since Clay was feeling better, you and I could have a little talk.<eos> And we will.

I'm tougher for it.<eos> And I'm ready to retake the reins of the company I created.<eos> He said he told you a year ago.<eos> He's lying. I never met a Mr. Pedrono.<eos> You know what he's doing, don't you?<eos> - Establishing a timeline.<eos> - That's right.<eos> He has to give fair warning before he can enforce an eviction.<eos> Would you sign an affidavit<eos> - to that effect? - I will.
They do not belong to any secret agency of the country.<eos> They are frauds.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> There's a ticket for Brazil, visa, your new passport and a Swiss Bank account number from which you can withdraw all the money you will ever need...<eos> There are only two choices for people like me.<eos> Life and death.<eos> I cannot win.<eos> But I won't wait here to die.<eos> You don't understand this now.<eos> But one day you will.
I am having sex with my husband, Ruby.<eos> What is it?<eos> Walt just called.<eos> There's a situation at The Red Pony.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let him figure it out.<eos> It's your day off.<eos> I'm all he's got.<eos> I flew home especially to see you.<eos> And you will.
But he won't listen to me.<eos> I'm listening, Mrs. Barlow, from here on out.<eos> Keep the line open, as the kidnappers say, and the next time you hear from them, you call this number immediately.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> I... I'll call you as soon as we hear from them again.<eos> Captain, permission to wire-tap.<eos> Mrs. Barlow, I need your permission to attach a wire-tap to your phones.<eos> Of course.<eos> Just... promise you'll find my children.<eos> We will, Mrs. Barlow.

And I needed to admit that to you in person.<eos> Dad, can we please not do this in front of Dexter?<eos> No, if you two are together, then I-I want him to hear this.<eos> I spent a lot of time with a prison shrink, working through my issues.<eos> He said it's important to take responsibility, so that's what I'm here to do.<eos> Okay.<eos> Now, I don't expect you to forgive me.<eos> I don't see any reason that you should, not after everything I put you through.<eos> But it's important you know, no matter what, I always loved you.<eos> I always will.
Look, all she knows is that you bought some gas.<eos> That's not a crime.<eos> Yeah, but buying gas to burn down a church to cover up the fact that you killed Travis Marshall is.<eos> And she knows that.<eos> But she can't prove it.<eos> Yet.<eos> I need to know what else she has, what her next move is.<eos> If all she's got is that DVD, I can handle this.<eos> Is this ever gonna end?<eos> Yeah, it will.
That was fast.<eos> Gray, I'm so sorry. But maybe, you know, if you put yourself out there again...<eos> Look at this!<eos> "Gray Chandler Murray spotted with Tamara Mellon."<eos> "Is she jumping ship at Donovan Decker?"<eos> -Oh, no.<eos> -Oh, yes.<eos> Donovan knows Tamara's been trying to get me over there ever since she left Jimmy Choo.<eos> If Donovan sees this...<eos> Maybe he won't.

- I didn't...<eos> - You didn't have the wallet.<eos> Did you go back up for it?<eos> - No.<eos> - You didn't.<eos> Who did?<eos> - There's no way--<eos> - Meredith, he was your father.<eos> You probably both said a whole lot of mean things to each other, but you loved him and he loved you.<eos> More than Otis ever will.

The whole council knows who we are now.<eos> Everything's about to change.<eos> Yeah, I'm sure Damon has a revenge plan cooked up.<eos> We'll figure out a way to deal with it.<eos> Stefan, you don't have to convince me that everything's going to be OK.<eos> I know.<eos> Wish I could, though.<eos> Wish I could just tell you that you'll never feel pain.<eos> That you'll never crave blood.<eos> But you will.
And I-- People make mistakes. I make mistakes.<eos> You make mistakes.<eos> Okay, if you're gonna... Bring up the abortion again... ohh.<eos> If you're gonna say that you had sex with someone because I had an abortion--<eos> I had sex with someone because I was hurt.<eos> And you wanted to hurt me back?

I mean, you're not dealing with reality.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I'm doing it too.<eos> Only, in my case it's even sadder, because I have not changed my underwear in three days.<eos> Yeah, you're right, I have to deal.<eos> I've got to cancel all the wedding stuff, and find a new place.<eos> Can I live with you?<eos> Wow, that's aggressive.<eos> But, uh, yeah.<eos> Will you, please?
Place your retractors in here.<eos> What are you gonna do?<eos> I am going to zap the tissue and see if the muscle contracts.<eos> We're looking for the four c's in here.<eos> What are we looking for?<eos> Contractility, capacity to bleed, consistency, and color.<eos> I'll tell you right now that color is not good.<eos> It's not contracting, either.<eos> - is not gonna work.<eos> - And what will?
Quinn's not gonna find out because I've destroyed every piece of evidence that you and I were ever a couple.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> You couldn't have gotten rid of all of it.<eos> You replaced me with a tiger.<eos> I couldn't completely get you out of that one.<eos> Had to get creative.<eos> Well, I'm glad that deleting our entire time together was so easy for you.<eos> But I guarantee you:<eos> Quinn is gonna find out eventually.<eos> No, she won't.

I'm not even allowed to use tampons, because my mom thinks, "oh, it takes away your virginity."<eos> - She doesn't know that I've kissed a guy before.<eos> She will now.
You know, the fact that you would even accuse me of that makes me sick.<eos> But if you still don't believe me, fine.<eos> See for yourself.<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Tell me what happened.<eos> I found it in the file room that day.<eos> It has my date stamp on it--mine.<eos> We have to tell Harvey.<eos> He'll know what to do.<eos> No, he won't.
We're on our way now.<eos> That's not much time.<eos> Come on, man, you're CIA; you don't need time.<eos> You keep us alive.<eos> We'll see what we can do.<eos> What happens if we can't get him out?<eos> Let black kill him.<eos> Go to plan "B."<eos> We don't have a plan "B."<eos> We will.
Call the nurse.<eos> Say she woke up.<eos> See, if you pray...<eos> How do you feel?<eos> Do you want some water?<eos> No.<eos> Anything hurt?<eos> No.<eos> Don't you ever leave me alone again!<eos> I won't.
He doesn't know where she is.<eos> What if Wilson...<eos> No, forget Wilson.<eos> Here's what we're gonna do...<eos> I'm gonna send a patrol car out to you right now, and you are going to stay put.<eos> No, I need to go out and find her.<eos> No, you need to stay put in case Lacey comes home.<eos> Get out there right now.<eos> I can't lose her, Bud.<eos> You won't.
What are you doing here?<eos> It's my office.<eos> Ooh. Mike has an office.<eos> Ed called us here.<eos> He's not gonna change my mind, pop.<eos> I'd rather build taco stands for the rest of my life than have him cosign a loan and lord it over me.<eos> Jim, does he lord it over you that he saved your butt from that bully, Andy O'Connell, in the seventh grade?<eos> How do you even remember that kid's name?<eos> - Because Mike always-- - Dad, dad, dad.<eos> You'll all here.
When I was wounded riding in that humvee... (Voice breaking) I was so afraid I would never see you again, never be able to tell you how I feel.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> Are you asking me?<eos> I'm asking.<eos> Th-then-- hen I want to hear it.<eos> I'm serious, Nikki.<eos> If this is it, then I want it all.<eos> Charlotte Mayfield, will you marry me?<eos> Yes. Yes. (Laughs)<eos> Yes, I will.
What?<eos> The, the, the, the running, the Olympics.<eos> Where?<eos> Oh, my God, how can you have missed it?<eos> Even coming from the airport, it's everywhere.<eos> Darling, it's been everywhere for five bloody years, hasn't it?<eos> Will we, won't we?<eos> Will it be built, won't it be built?<eos> Will we win?<eos> No, we won't.
You got a thing for mommy.<eos> And now it all makes sense.<eos> Because I actually looked into your mommy, and it turns out that the whole time you were home with daddy, mommy was out banging--<eos> Point, Tanner.<eos> I'll see you in court, Harv.<eos> So when did the plan change from trying to settle to punching Tanner in the face?<eos> He didn't seem to want to do the one, so I did the other.<eos> That's funny.<eos> But he got under your skin, and that can't happen when we go to trial.<eos> - It won't.
It's not just a bunch of houses in the same place.<eos> It's a community.<eos> It's lives that are connected, people who care about each other.<eos> That's beautiful.<eos> Now, back in Mrs....<eos> I know it sounds sappy, but damn it, it's true.<eos> And these wonderful people I'd lived beside...<eos> Well, they're my family.<eos> Your honor, I'm--I'm not sure what we're getting from this.<eos> Well, you will in a minute, honey.
Nico, I-it's Tony.<eos> Ran down every lead on the tapes, turned up nothing.<eos> Whoever did this -- a real pro, man.<eos> Well?<eos> That's the guy.<eos> The guy who tried to sell me the tapes.<eos> I need to be certain.<eos> Positive. 100%.<eos> Your pal know you're on to him?<eos> No...but he will.
The real Dean never would have expelled us.<eos> He loved us.<eos> Unfortunately, love is not admissible evidence.<eos> Oh... ♪ Love is not admissible evidence ♪<eos> I'm working on a cop opera.<eos> Cop-ra!<eos> Police-ical!<eos> Fine.<eos> We'll get some proof.<eos> No, you won't.
- Hey.<eos> - Hey!<eos> So, how'd it go?<eos> Well, they seemed happy to see me.<eos> But what about the designs?<eos> - They're looking at them now.<eos> - Okay.<eos> We should know any minute.<eos> God, I hope they like them.<eos> They will.
H.R.! And like you, I want my family to grow up In a beautiful, prosperous, and safe california.<eos> So vote for me, tommy dale, for governor of california.<eos> Man: And, cut.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Excellent. That's it.<eos> Dale:<eos> Got it? Yeah. Nailed it, kid.<eos> Lancaster 3:00.<eos> Don't forget the delta smelt brief.<eos> I won't.
We got $60 for what?<eos> We're gonna throw in A free beverage and some warm, hot towels!<eos> A warm towel!<eos> 60 bucks.<eos> We got $60?<eos> We have $60, the guy in the back.<eos> Jared: $60 in the back.<eos> You know, we're gonna throw in that jet ski Courtesy of one leonard franklin of franklin and franklin, The law firm so nice they named it twice.<eos> Don't worry. I have no problem firing my son.<eos> Actually, you will.
Has he been silvered?<eos> Less than an hour ago.<eos> Shall I give him another dose<eos> - and bring him to you?<eos> - Excellent.<eos> We got a new Packmaster- me.<eos> That arrangement include you sucking down vampire blood?<eos> I accept the role of master of this pack.<eos> You gotta have a second before you can challenge the master.<eos> I will.
Elizabeth Burke.<eos> Yes.<eos> Agent Collins.<eos> Uh, my husband's actually at the office.<eos> I know.<eos> Well, then, what are you doing here?<eos> My job.<eos> You can't just walk in like this.<eos> Does agent Hughes know about this?<eos> He will.
He comes and you relapse.<eos> You don't want to, but still you go.<eos> It's not good for you but you can't resist.<eos> That guy's like cocaine.<eos> Is your life with me sad?<eos> I shouldn't meet him anymore.<eos> Dream on.<eos> Do you think you're enough for me?<eos> I won't see him anymore.<eos> I won't.
One must dive, not wade.<eos> Since you know so much about weddings, could you marry your father and your mother?<eos> But you need a ring.<eos> I have one.<eos> It's a great ring.<eos> I'll give you mine.<eos> This is a ring?<eos> I got it from my mother who got it from her grandmother.<eos> It'll be yours one day. Be careful.<eos> I won't.
Oh, no!<eos> What, has she got her martini goggles on again?<eos> Yeah, every once in a while, She goes through these periods Where she just gets super smashed<eos> I mean, she'll get on a tree stump And think it's a Kennedy.<eos> That's e... that's exactly what's happening.<eos> Well, it's all right.<eos> You just tell her.<eos> She'll have a laugh,<eos> Set fire to his car, and move on.<eos> I will.
If you don't knock it off, and I mean right now, the next place you go is gonna have locks on the doors and bars on the windows.<eos> Do you want to spend the next two years in a juvenile detention center?<eos> Keep talking!<eos> And see what happens.<eos> Officially, rusty is in an emergency-care situation, which means he needs 24/7 adult supervision.<eos> Okay.<eos> But by whom?<eos> Well, I am working that out, but in the meantime, have him walked across the street to the doctor, have his personal things sent to my office, and he'll be out of your hair for the rest of the day.<eos> Before we can deal with any of your concerns, we need to comply fully with the law.<eos> And we will.
I just wish... I wish you didn't have to go.<eos> Me, too.<eos> I am so proud of you.<eos> It's okay. I'm gonna listen to Cooper and Charlotte. I'm gonna do my homework and brush my teeth.<eos> I'm gonna behave in class. I'm gonna read books instead of watch too much TV.<eos> I promise.<eos> I love you, mom.<eos> Coop. Mase, let's, uh, let your mom rest now.<eos> If you see Nana, say hi, okay?<eos> I will, baby.
Sucks.<eos> It's like every time you feel like you're taking one step forward, the world knocks you two steps back.<eos> Dude, my loans won't be paid off till 2020, and I have a kid.<eos> I feel better now.<eos> Well, as long as you feel better.<eos> You have your own cup?<eos> Yeah, when you come here a lot, they give you one.<eos> Want one?<eos> I don't come here a lot.<eos> You will.
Hey! Hey, stay away from him!<eos> Well, we anticipate that Somers' attorney will try and paint you as blinded by grief or looking to make a buck.<eos> This isn't about the money.<eos> I just want justice for my father.<eos> Emily, there are a lot of people who don't want this trial to proceed.<eos> Dangerous people.<eos> My mother died when I was a baby, and my father has been the only family I've ever known and they slit his throat.<eos> They are going to have to kill me if they want me to give this up.<eos> Well let's hope it doesn't come to that.<eos> And it won't.
- This is so dramatic.<eos> Do you guys remember One life to live?<eos> Shut up.<eos> Look, be pissed.<eos> Hate me.<eos> Do what you gotta do.<eos> But we got bigger fish, okay?<eos> We trade him in, we get outta here.<eos> - Won't matter.<eos> - Yes, it will.
My partners will be thrilled.<eos> And of course, we'll keep it off the radar until you say otherwise.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'll talk to Margaret and start the paperwork.<eos> Okay.<eos> That sounds great.<eos> Can you hear my voice, Mr. Delaney?<eos> Oh, man, you should've just kept going.<eos> I know you want to die.<eos> And you will.
- Of course.<eos> I knew what was going to happen to the Congress.<eos> That's impossible...<eos> How could you know?<eos> How I knew, and how I came to be the man I am today, is going to become clear to you...<eos> What is that?<eos> The culmination of my life's work...<eos> You and I have more in common than you realize, Edouard.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will...

Of our own mortality?<eos> I was thinking more of the number of people I've put in the ground.<eos> Hell, I could fill my own graveyard.<eos> I'm sure most of them deserved it.<eos> You put fresh flowers on Hunter's grave.<eos> From my garden.<eos> It seemed the least I could do.<eos> She would have appreciated it.<eos> I like to think so.<eos> I, however, will not.
I'm moving out.<eos> No, you're not moving out.<eos> I'm-I'm not?<eos> No, you can stay as long as you want.<eos> As long as you need.<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> that's so good to hear.<eos> Thataboy. I just...<eos> I just want you to not worry about anything.<eos> I won't.
- You do.<eos> I wanna focus on you.<eos> I heard about that man.<eos> Cheryl, whatever it is you've heard...<eos> He walked out of jail.<eos> After that crime he committed.<eos> After he was convicted with all of those witnesses.<eos> Cheryl, you will either find a woman without family and friends and torture her or you won't.<eos> If you do, your daughter will be healed.<eos> If not, she won't.
Billy,<eos> I've seen this kid spend an entire afternoon smoking dope and trying to lick his own nipples.<eos> Who amongst us hasn't... done...<eos> Look, we will...<eos> we will take him on, okay?<eos> Billy...<eos> He'll be my responsibility.<eos> Oh, thank you so much.<eos> You will not regret it.<eos> Yes, you will.
It's a text from my mom.<eos> Remember we asked her to find out who leaked the video of Payson kissing Sasha?<eos> And?<eos> It was Lauren.<eos> Honey... breathe.<eos> Thanks for making this happen so last minute.<eos> No worries. Nothing I like more than making dinner for six unexpected house guests.<eos> This is getting serious, Annie.<eos> - I really could lose this job.<eos> - But you won't.
Sad or empty or whatever.<eos> I like the smell of your hair and I like the sound of your voice<eos> - and I fucking decided on you.<eos> - Charlie!<eos> Ah!<eos> Relax, I'm fine.<eos> Please, don't break up with me.<eos> Please don't, just don't.<eos> I'll do whatever you ask, honestly.<eos> I will...
And your brother?<eos> - He knows you're going? - He doesn't need to.<eos> Right, your brother's bad luck.<eos> - And you're good luck?<eos> I can't drop you.<eos> Use your moped.<eos> I don't have time.<eos> Call me tonight.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - I will.
In my culture, we believe that when you die your spirit has to climb a mountain, carrying the souls of everyone you wronged in your lifetime.<eos> Imagine the weight I will have to lift.<eos> The monsters I created, the people they killed.<eos> Isaac.<eos> He was my friend.<eos> Now his soul will be in my arms, too.<eos> Can you see now why I fear death?<eos> You want to hand me over.<eos> There's no shame in that.<eos> But you won't.
Where we headed?<eos> I am headed to Philly.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, let me take a shower real quick.<eos> Give me like five minutes.<eos> Actually, give me like 15.<eos> I'm gonna stretch this leg out.<eos> I'll be right with you.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
do you have to?<eos> I mean... leave.<eos> I mean, really?<eos> [ Sighs ] Yes.<eos> I need to spend some more time... thinking about the living.<eos> Now, y'all find Rusty's mother, like I promised him we would, and when I come back from Atlanta, we'll - - I'll --<eos> I'll only be working down the street a ways.<eos> We'll see each other all the time.<eos> I know it.<eos> We will.
Will you help me down?<eos> As you know, the club's big Halloween bash is tomorrow night, and since I'm going as Barbie, I was hoping that maybe I could convince you to be Ken.<eos> Me, Ken?<eos> I don't think I could pull off Ken.<eos> I think you could.<eos> No, trust me. I'm not your guy.<eos> Well, if you say so.<eos> But I am definitely going to the party, so I've gotta come up with a costume.<eos> I'll see you there?<eos> Yeah. Well, yes, you will.
- We're prepared to go as high as $150,000.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Too low.<eos> You'll have to do better.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Too low.<eos> Do better.<eos> - No. No.<eos> We'll take it.<eos> - No, we won't.
Moving.<eos> Could be a host of things.<eos> Look, just 'cause he moves a finger, doesn't mean he's gonna wake up today.<eos> But it doesn't mean he won't.<eos> Okay, let me hear it.<eos> Now is the knee too much?<eos> No, no, no, the knee totally makes it.<eos> All right.<eos> I can't imagine my life without you, so, Karen Ann Churley, will you marry me?<eos> Why, yes, I will.
It's gonna be okay, okay.<eos> It's gonna be okay, right? Mmhmm.<eos> I'm not gonna remember?<eos> Remember what?<eos> Remember dying.<eos> No.<eos> No, Pete.<eos> You won't remember.<eos> But I will.<eos> I will.
Damned...<eos> My mobile...<eos> Barbara, it can't go on like this.<eos> I totally agree.<eos> Release me.<eos> The program represents thousands of euros.<eos> You know we won't release you.<eos> It's been 10 years since the last time you came.<eos> - I needed to go back to my roots, to catch my breath.<eos> - With us you won't.
Excuse me.<eos> Hello. Is this the Post?<eos> Wait!<eos> I work with Peter.<eos> I set up a shell corporation.<eos> We steer a little bit of his paycheck into a quiet little slush fund.<eos> He can do whatever he wants with it.<eos> And if he were using this slush fund to binge on his favorite bad habit, where do you suppose we might find him?<eos> I rented an apartment in Tribeca under the name of the dummy corp.<eos> Yes, I will!

No.<eos> I don't want her involved in this, Moz.<eos> What if she's willing to help?<eos> You talked to her?<eos> She's worried about you.<eos> And I'm sure she'll give Peter a glowing recommendation.<eos> Neal, this plan sounds incredibly intricate.<eos> It is.<eos> What happens if it doesn't work?<eos> It will.
I assumed that he knows that.<eos> Ricky, he knows that we're not married.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> He looked it up on the Internet.<eos> It's public record.<eos> And?<eos> And...<eos> He said he wouldn't say anything, but...<eos> But he won't.
Welcome.<eos> Some think it is with practice.<eos> I tell them iA to this conviction aside.<eos> iI must Pius to succeed in this type of action.<eos> Knowledge and harmony Ies among members of a ceIIuIe, who must learn living ensemble and to know.<eos> You have an idea the place of the operation?<eos> I heard we were going blow themselves purpose I do not know not exactly where.<eos> I think it's a bar.<eos> On after you, there will be that Jews and Christians?<eos> In my opinion, there will also Muslims.
Got a great happy hour special in from A E.<eos> I was thinking we normally only see babies with this condition.<eos> Husna's five years old so...<eos> You were thinking that as she was older you might be able to do the operation?<eos> Well, I'm afraid the answer to that is "No".<eos> If she dies during the operation, which is very possible, I want her family to know the most experienced surgeon was operating.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> Of course.<eos> I know, you hate me for refusing.<eos> But one day you won't.
She'll be found eventually.<eos> If it comes out later that we had knowledge of this and we didn't report it, they can use it against him at trial.<eos> I'm not gonna tell anyone.<eos> How will it get out later?<eos> This is beyond risky.<eos> The upside... I've done time before.<eos> - But that was before Dylan.<eos> - You'll make bail.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
In other words, if he takes even one step outside, he is breaking the law.<eos> Time is running out.<eos> Find the General and make it clear to him. He must drop everything right now and get back to the palace.<eos> I understand.<eos> If he makes the slightest mistake, our general will be accused of treason.<eos> Even the King is starting to be suspicious of him, so...<eos> I will go and bring him back immediately.<eos> If by chance... although the General would never do such a thing... the General cannot step even one foot outside with the Prince, otherwise, everything is over for him.<eos> Tell him those words clearly.<eos> I definitely will.
- Mister?<eos> - Call me Mose.<eos> Why are they doing this?<eos> They wanna break him out, I suppose.<eos> But killing innocent people?<eos> Why kill Gus?<eos> He had nothing to do with keeping that old guy locked up.<eos> I get the feeling that killing ain't too much of a stretch for this bunch.<eos> What if no help comes?<eos> It will.
Which you did.<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Must have known you'd have people watching the place.<eos> My parole officer knows where I'm staying.<eos> I knew I would be arrested within minutes, so why go back?<eos> Because I have just as much incentive to figure out who set that fire as you do.<eos> Someone clearly wants to frame me, someone who has waited a long time for me to get out, but would prefer that I stay caged up in that cell.<eos> And you might know who that someone is?<eos> I'm offering my services.<eos> As a... arson investigator... if you will.
Wow, that's great.<eos> She must've been happy you were there for her.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So... are we on for a jog Monday morning?<eos> 'Cause I gotta say, I miss my workout partner already.<eos> Actually, Hank, I think I'm gonna have my associate cover for me next week too, and not rush back so fast.<eos> Yeah, um...<eos> Well, have fun up there.<eos> And... and tell your family... I'm really sorry I missed out.<eos> I will.
I'd love to be on your team.<eos> Yeah, you can be on my team, Jason.<eos> Hey, Jenny.<eos> What's up, girl?<eos> This is Desean.<eos> Oh, hey, Desean.<eos> You draft me, I'm talking about two touchdowns a game.<eos> Oh, I want all your TDS.<eos> And don't forget about the punt returns.<eos> Oh, I won't. Oh, shit!
No, I know.<eos> What I mean is...<eos> You've come a long way, you know, from that trailer park in Tuscaloosa.<eos> You got the world by the tail, Rox.<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> Come see my room, grandma.<eos> It's upstairs.<eos> Upstairs?<eos> Then you better stay close, 'cause I might get lost.<eos> I will.
There's more to life than just what's best for Roxy leblanc.<eos> There's my cab.<eos> I-I said I was taking you.<eos> I'd rather go by myself.<eos> You know...<eos> I admit...<eos> I made a lot of mistakes in my life, but I was a drunk.<eos> What's your excuse?<eos> Have a good semester.<eos> I will.
I believe I can make Downton safe for our children, if we ever have any.<eos> But I can only do it if you're with me.<eos> But what about Papa?<eos> I do love him.<eos> Love him by all means, but believe in me.<eos> There.<eos> Will that convince you?<eos> Convince me again.<eos> And don't say, 'If we ever have any.'<eos> Because we will.
Oh, Shrimpie's not stalking.<eos> He's coming with me.<eos> Mr Crawley?<eos> Mr Gregson?<eos> Is your picnic under control?<eos> Of course.<eos> I'm worried about Mary bumping through the glen.<eos> She doesn't have to come.<eos> No, I know.<eos> But she will.
Yes, sir, I did.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Certainly wish you hadn't.<eos> Three states.<eos> If I want to put you boys away here in Nevada, I got to extradite you from Utah and Arizona.<eos> Lot of paperwork.<eos> I hate paperwork.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> Shoot 'em.<eos> If you won't, I will.
Well, good riddance.<eos> Wait.<eos> Um... What happens after his three months are up?<eos> Assuming he gets clean, he can go wherever he wants.<eos> Meaning he's coming back here.<eos> Don't know that. We can't control his movements, Joan.<eos> Well, did you tell him he could see David again?<eos> (Water splashes) No, but I didn't rule it out, either.<eos> Roland... I told him it'd be one step at a time.<eos> No, it won't.
Ice cream.<eos> Ice cream.<eos> Ice cream!<eos> So, what was that back there?<eos> It was nothing.<eos> Really?<eos> 'Cause it didn't look like nothing.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight, okay?<eos> Yes, please.<eos> We will. Okay.
He thinks he knows better than everyone.<eos> Truth is he doesn't know his ass from a hole in the ground.<eos> He needs to declare bankruptcy and he doesn't wanna hear that.<eos> Well, let me keep him in the family in exchange for backing Jessica.<eos> Well, you close him, then we'll talk.<eos> That's not so reassuring.<eos> You came to me.<eos> I didn't come to you.<eos> I'll see you on the first tee.<eos> No, you won't.
They worked here, when it was Emmerson's.<eos> No-one else left who did.<eos> They tell tales in the bays, about how I came to lose my arm.<eos> Ever heard any?<eos> - No.<eos> - A story for every day of the year, most of them not fit to be repeated.<eos> None of them even close to the truth.<eos> Why don't you put them right?<eos> Because the story can change all it likes.<eos> This never will.
How can I know what I know will help you?<eos> You're testing me.<eos> Why?<eos> You don't have issues with authority figures.<eos> You know you're the smartest person in most rooms.<eos> What's your name?<eos> Am I required to tell you?<eos> Well, I'm just a consultant.<eos> You don't have to tell me anything.<eos> Then I won't.
Come on my lap.<eos> You know, it's normal to miss your Mum.<eos> We understand.<eos> We miss her too.<eos> But she won't come back.<eos> You've got to accept that.<eos> She said honey bunny and sweety.<eos> Stop it now.<eos> She'll come back.<eos> -No, she won't.
If you're so worried about that hard drive,<eos> - you should put it in a safe deposit box.<eos> - Robert, all of the tech for the prototype on the "Colorado" is on here.<eos> The only schematic.<eos> You think I'd entrust that to a bank?<eos> That is completely paranoid.<eos> I know.<eos> Don't let anyone in.<eos> I'm not waiting up for you.<eos> Sure, you will.
I can't now.<eos> We came so close.<eos> It can still happen. - One day.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> I'm gonna clear your name,<eos> You got me here.<eos> That's more than you ever had to do.<eos> Hey, you're talking in the past tense.<eos> - Whatever happens or doesn't...<eos> - It will!
Right.<eos> And when you shake their hands, make sure your hands are bone dry.<eos> Dry hands.<eos> Never wet and clammy.<eos> I got it.<eos> Guys, quick announcement.<eos> I'm gonna be popping these crow's eggs in the fridge here so they don't spoil.<eos> Do not touch them.<eos> They are ours.<eos> We won't.
I am deeply, ridiculously in love with you and above everything else, I just--<eos> - will-- - Wait.<eos> - Just--I need to remember this.<eos> - Sure.<eos> - No, no, no, no, hold on.<eos> Just--I need another second, please.<eos> I need to remember every little thing about how perfect my life is right now at this exact moment.<eos> Are you good?<eos> - Yeah. - Okay.<eos> Leslie Knope, - will you-- - Yes!
But that doesn't necessarily--<eos> My father had prostate cancer.<eos> I mean, that's not what he died from.<eos> It changed him.<eos> From the moment he was diagnosed, my father was a dead man walking.<eos> And he mourned his death for years.<eos> He gave up.<eos> It was the most depressing thing I'd ever seen, and...<eos> I don't want that to happen to me.<eos> - It won't.
That's a cry for help if I've ever seen one.<eos> Ahh...<eos> I don't know what hurts worse, this or getting shot with a curare-laced bullet.<eos> Been there, done that.<eos> Definitely the bullet.<eos> Ah... [Sighs]<eos> You know, Oliver, I'm no expert at this, but...<eos> I don't think love is about changing or saving a person.<eos> I think it's about finding the person who's already the right fit.<eos> One day you will.
Because you're an angel sent from heaven?<eos> I wanna bury my head in the safety of your bosom.<eos> Because Mrs. Buckminster is here.<eos> The search is over.<eos> Mrs. Buckminster, we just need to know your salary.<eos> Oh, delightful.<eos> Well, my weekly fee is-<eos> There, there.<eos> I'm sure you'll find someone you like just as much.<eos> - No, we won't.
In fact, it was... one of the reasons that led me... to take the vows.<eos> And recently, I've been struggling with my faith, wondering if I really belong in the church, and it made me think of you and your tragedy.<eos> I thought if I came...<eos> And here you are.<eos> Hank struggled, too.<eos> Um... for a long time, he... he wanted to get revenge on the bastard who ran her over, but I told him,<eos> "Hank, our Missy came home to us with a few broken bones.<eos> We get to live with our daughter.<eos> The monster who left her there has to live with himself."<eos> No. I won't.
Everything's gonna be fine.<eos> Sophie:<eos> Just tell him I love him, okay?<eos> Steve:<eos> - Ed, we're ready to move.<eos> Ed:<eos> - Okay, Soph, I gotta go.<eos> Sophie: Eddie, please, be careful.<eos> Ed:<eos> I will, okay?
No, she's my baby!<eos> She's mine!<eos> Dia Nobile, you're under arrest.<eos> You can't arrest me.<eos> I'm her mother.<eos> I put everything together in a folder.<eos> It's on the dresser.<eos> Just look at it.<eos> I will.<eos> We will.
You think that I'd let you live after everything you've done?<eos> Castle!<eos> Come on.<eos> I want you to watch.<eos> I want you to watch as I take her life.<eos> Over here.<eos> The water's pretty murky.<eos> Haven't seen anything yet.<eos> They still haven't found the body.<eos> They won't.
Robert, I don't know how to express...<eos> Please tell me if there's anything, you want me to...<eos> Everyone's... deeply touched, and we've received many...<eos> They've found her, and they're expecting to bring her up soon.<eos> Then she will be driven to Forensics where...<eos> The police have offered to give you an update whenever you want, but not until it suits you, of course.<eos> - Would you handle the practicalities?<eos> - Certainly.<eos> Prepare the priest and tell him, that it will be as Maja wants.<eos> Yes, I will.
Just because you're from North Carolina doesn't mean you're a bigger fan.<eos> Hey. Soda?<eos> Ooh. Thank you.<eos> We were just talking about our mutual love for The Tar Heels.<eos> Is that a band?<eos> [Chuckles] No.<eos> A basketball team.<eos> Sports?<eos> Party on, you two.<eos> We will.
She'll tell you the same thing I am.<eos> She had it worse.<eos> She'd run away.<eos> Peter saved her from the street.<eos> Say where she was from?<eos> Somewhere out west.<eos> Like the UP or something.<eos> You know what, Beth?<eos> - When we catch this guy--<eos> - You won't.
Jack is right.<eos> Chuck and Blair hold hands?<eos> Chuck and Blair go to the movies?<eos> You said you never wanted us to be boring.<eos> Well, we definitely aren't that now.<eos> I was a stupid child when I said those things.<eos> Life with you could never be boring.<eos> Blair Cornelia Waldorf, will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
General Subutai knew that when he entered Europe, they'd be outnumbered.<eos> And he was ready for it.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> He wanted his enemies to be vanquished by their own arrogance.<eos> When he gave his first order,<eos> Çağatay and Genghis Khan's sons probably gave him strange looks. Because this tactic, worked in steppes and deserts with a few cavalrymen. Not in woods or battlefields against knights.<eos> I understand, sir.<eos> You don't.<eos> You don't understand yet.<eos> But you will some day.
I was gonna bring it to you.<eos> Our agreement remains.<eos> We are going to Storybrooke together.<eos> I'll get it back.<eos> I don't have time for your games.<eos> I've crossed through too many worlds to be brought short at the brink of success.<eos> Who was it who bested you?<eos> The swan girl. Emma.<eos> Rest assured, it won't happen again.<eos> No, it won't.
Well, we'll, let you have some time alone.<eos> - You don't have to go.<eos> - No, it's okay.<eos> We were just leaving. We've been here a while.<eos> I guess I'll see you in a couple weeks.<eos> Yeah, I'll see you there.<eos> We've all been there.<eos> It usually happens first few months after being on the job.<eos> Right now you have nothing to compare it to.<eos> But you will.
But she puts the time of death between 9:00 and midnight.<eos> So is Curt a victim or a suspect?<eos> Maybe both--either way, we gotta track him down.<eos> Well, how are we gonna do that?<eos> No last name.<eos> No print hits from the letter.<eos> So we start with Manor Hill, get a list of Lassiter's students.<eos> Think somebody up at that school wants to talk about abuse?<eos> Have a nice drive.<eos> We will.
It just doesn't make taking a life any easier, that's all.<eos> No.<eos> Catherine,<eos> I think it's happening.<eos> Take it.<eos> Please.<eos> Protect yourself.<eos> Take it.<eos> You know what to do.<eos> No, I won't.
The blade's point is travelling inexorably toward his heart.<eos> Not even you could hope to thwart such magic.<eos> It would take a power as ancient as the dragons themselves.<eos> No. There must be something that we can do, Gaius.<eos> Only the Sidhe possess such magic.<eos> In the midst of the Lake of Avalon there is an ancient isle.<eos> That is the source of their power.<eos> You must take him there.<eos> He won't allow that.<eos> He will.
Well, I guess we just didn't have the nerve to come back and tell you we failed.<eos> You didn't fail!<eos> Look at our new home!<eos> New home?<eos> Who paid for all this?<eos> You did!<eos> The kid's right.<eos> The money's coming out of your pocket.<eos> Sorry, slick, but we don't have that kind of dough.<eos> Oh, you will.
Right.<eos> And where might we find those?<eos> In the Hall of Science.<eos> And where's that?<eos> Helium.<eos> Then quick, let's just head on and turn on back to Helium.<eos> What do you take me for?<eos> I take you for a man who's lost.<eos> I won't be lost if you just tell me how to work this thing!<eos> I will!
Keep quiet.<eos> I'll tell Daphnee everything.<eos> Laurent said the truth.<eos> - I was going to tell you.<eos> - Liar.<eos> It's not the right time.<eos> You know what?<eos> Daphnee thinks the penicillin was you.<eos> - What?<eos> - And after this, she will for the 1st attempt too.
This is Helen.<eos> - I'm guessing the police are there?<eos> By your response I'm guessing I have about 30 seconds before you hand them the phone.<eos> If that.<eos> If you believe someone could frame Barr, you have to believe they could do the same to me.<eos> I suppose that's possible.<eos> She was a sweet kid, Helen.<eos> And they killed her because of me.<eos> They want me to run.<eos> But I won't.
Agent Searle?<eos> Agent Searle, it's good to see you made it.<eos> I'd almost given up hope.<eos> I killed all those men.<eos> It's okay, son.<eos> They were already dead.<eos> The important thing to remember is that you saved countless others.<eos> One of them is still alive.<eos> -Find him.<eos> -We will.
Thank you.<eos> What you doing stood way over here?<eos> Thought I'd stay out the way.<eos> A pity you couldn't have done that a few years ago.<eos> It's not your fault, Joseph.<eos> Dad had a mind of his own, you know.<eos> You just didn't fucking help matters.<eos> Will you come for a drink with me?<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you fucking will.
You don't.<eos> I don't give a shit about friendship this situation, or the past.<eos> Major League Baseball thinks the way I think.<eos> You're not gonna win.<eos> And I'll give you a nickel's worth of free advice.<eos> You're never gonna get another job after this catastrophic season you're about to set us all up for.<eos> You'll have to explain to your kid why you're working at Dick's Sporting Goods.<eos> I'm not gonna fire you, Grady.<eos> - Fuck you, Billy.<eos> - Now I will.
Defeat, victory, defeat, victory.<eos> And one day, here in the neighborhood,<eos> I had to realize, and I did realize, that I was mistaken, I was truly mistaken when I thought that there had never been and could never be any kind of change here on earth.<eos> Because, believe me, I know now that this change has indeed taken place.<eos> Come off it!<eos> That's rubbish!<eos> THE THIRD DAY<eos> Coat!<eos> She's not eating!<eos> She will.
Seriously.<eos> I know this seems like a scary thing, but it's not.<eos> It's like this miracle or something.<eos> I can feel him.<eos> So, it's a bouncing baby boy.<eos> I'm sorry I didn't know. Should've brought some blue balloons.<eos> It's just a guess.<eos> When I picture him, I see a boy.<eos> We'll see.<eos> You won't.
I took them apart to the competition<eos> I was afraid they advance to meet.<eos> Unspoken rules, you know.<eos> Yes, you said that these five will qualify.<eos> Sami, Jill, Justin, Gregory.<eos> Errors. In fact these five gifts do not exist.<eos> I said, after confirmation.<eos> Awesome, but I kind of foreboding!<eos> If there are five individuals They must here.<eos> Yes, they will.
I'm heading back to Tyler right now, there's a Western Union up there.<eos> And... shit I sure hope you get this message. I'm running out of time.<eos> Okay call me okay?<eos> Bye.<eos> Joann, thank you so much for everything.<eos> Oh you're welcome honey and I hope you enjoy it.<eos> Hey if that pink slip shows up while you're packing, will you mail it to me?<eos> Oh, sure will Honey, sure will!<eos> And you have a safe trip back to LA!<eos> I will. - O.K
He's gonna be okay.<eos> Isn't that right, buddy?<eos> See that?<eos> He likes us.<eos> Dylan really loves you, you know?<eos> I know.<eos> He's just mad that his friends don't visit him here.<eos> He thought they would all visit.<eos> But nobody came.<eos> Well, they will.
We found the Great Pumpkin!<eos> You're crazy.<eos> I felt like Flavor Flav.<eos> - I can't believe you chose those girls.<eos> - Are you jealous?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Don't just disappear like that on me.<eos> - You told me to.<eos> - You shouldn't listen to me.<eos> Fine, I won't.
No, I don't reckon a brew's gonna do it this time.<eos> You said you were gonna get us to Inverness.<eos> We wanna get out of here as quickly as possible.<eos> Understood.<eos> Let me just get on to PC Stewart and we'll see where he's got to.<eos> - You don't have to be so rude.<eos> - Fuck rude!<eos> People are dead.<eos> I wanna get out of this village, out of this fucking country.<eos> And we will.
Could you perhaps...<eos> - I mean...<eos> - Let me go.<eos> - Can't you move a little faster?<eos> - Why?<eos> - I must find them.<eos> - The two ladies are gone.<eos> I can see that, but I want to find them.<eos> - Not a chance.<eos> - Ah, but I will!
We wouldn't have come in if we knew you were here.<eos> Just leave.<eos> I would, but I can't be sure you won't call the police.<eos> I won't.<eos> You didn't take anything?<eos> So just go.<eos> I just want to make sure my family is safe.<eos> Why wouldn't anyone be safe?<eos> Unless you call the police, everything will be fine.<eos> I won't.
Nice.<eos> (SERBO-CROATIAN) What are you doing here?<eos> Need to replace the hdmi and reroute the components.<eos> If we don't get 1080p video, we're all dead.<eos> I'm with ati. Understand?<eos> It means, get the fuck out.<eos> We have been facing a challenging and complex new set of threats for this region.<eos> Iran's ballistic missiles prove to be a significant risk to this area.<eos> interceptors... ..will...<eos> Will what?
Now you tell me what the fuck this was all about.<eos> "Was?"<eos> You think this is over?<eos> There'll be somebody else.<eos> Your boy, Fiennes, is gonna die.<eos> Go on, pull the trigger. Kill me and you kill Fiennes.<eos> They won't stop till they get him.<eos> I stopped you, I'll stop them.<eos> I didn't want to kill him.<eos> They will.
Oh, well.<eos> Good luck, everyone!<eos> While Rabbit and the others were busy gathering the Backson's favourite things,<eos> Pooh and Piglet found the perfect place to dig the pit.<eos> Piglet dug, and dug, and dug.<eos> And Pooh supervised.<eos> And now to disguise the pit.<eos> Catch, Piglet.<eos> Gosh, Pooh, I hope this idea works.<eos> Oh, it will, Piglet.
My greatest accomplishment.<eos> And you, you're Ned Stark's bastard, aren't you?<eos> Did I offend you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> You are the bastard, though.<eos> Lord Eddard Stark is my father.<eos> And Lady Stark is not your mother, making you... the bastard.<eos> Let me give you some advice, bastard.<eos> Never forget what you are.<eos> The rest of the world will not.
Let me in, Anna.<eos> Do you like the apartment?<eos> - Absolutly.<eos> Haven't you been awake?<eos> - I slept badly, I just woke up.<eos> You remember the importance of routines?<eos> - Yeah. He sleeps here.<eos> As the court has determined, he doesn't know where you live.<eos> If you want a phone...<eos> - I will not.
I just want you to think about it.<eos> Ask yourself what you think mom would have wanted.<eos> I'm going.<eos> Bye.<eos> Do you have any fours?<eos> - You ask just about fours.<eos> No, go jump in the ocean.<eos> - Do you have any sevens?<eos> Yes, I have.<eos> No, I will not!
I thought I was under water.<eos> - You will not be wet from believeing it.<eos> No.<eos> You have no idea what you were doing?<eos> Right?<eos> It must be absolutely awful.<eos> It is quite possible we can look for each other after this?<eos> You need someone who can take care of you.<eos> Would you do it?<eos> - Of course I will.
You don't understand the risk.<eos> I don't care about the risks.<eos> You remind me of your mother.<eos> Martin?<eos> Dad?<eos> Nathan.<eos> I'm your father, but I'll never be your dad.<eos> I lost that chance a long time ago.<eos> I don't know if you can understand my reasons.<eos> Maybe someday you will.
What's that?<eos> That you leave Kyle here with us until he finishes high school.<eos> I'm his mother.<eos> He belongs with me.<eos> You sure he feels that way?<eos> Don't you tell me what my son feels.<eos> He's coming with me, and there isn't anything you can do.<eos> Then you can't have that commission.<eos> Oh, well, we'll see about that!<eos> Yeah, we will.
Anyone could be next!<eos> It could be you, understand?<eos> - Nobody's safe!<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> We weren't supposed to survived when that bridge collapsed.<eos> And so now it's kill or be killed.<eos> You get that, Denis?<eos> Whatever, I warned you.<eos> Do whatever you want to do.<eos> I will.
I'm not embarrassed to have people over anymore.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're not having people over.<eos> Can one of you take me to the library?<eos> Brick, do you not even notice what they did?<eos> Weird.<eos> So can one of you take me to the library?<eos> I feel like reading about Peru.<eos> No. Brick, sorry, can't.<eos> Actually, won't.
Ever think of that?<eos> It's why she never told.<eos> Look what I found.<eos> See that boy?<eos> That was a happy boy.<eos> He still believes in Santa Claus.<eos> You shouldn't have to go through all this with Tara or... whoever that is.<eos> I'll figure it out, ma.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> No, you won't.
I don't know.<eos> I went to look for it the other day and it was gone.<eos> I-I should have called the cops.<eos> Okay, so does anyone want to speak up?<eos> That's not ours.<eos> At least it's not mine.<eos> No, it's not mine, either.<eos> Someone is trying to frame us.<eos> I don't know anything about it.<eos> Well, we will soon.
We're good up here.<eos> Everything okay down there?<eos> I know that it's a lot to take in.<eos> I'm not sure I'll ever really understand what happened.<eos> And I'm not sure it would make any difference if I did.<eos> You know...<eos> Today was something... I never could have imagined.<eos> But if the impossible is possible...<eos> Who's to say that someday I won't see him again?<eos> Maybe you will.
Dude, I think it sounds like it was Macklin's call.<eos> Look, I get it.<eos> You're young, and trying isn't cool.<eos> But I think you're smart.<eos> I'm gonna be going back to Indianapolis soon, and I think you should come work for me.<eos> Wow, move all the way to Indianapolis, so I can pick up your vitamins and supplements.<eos> Everybody starts somewhere.<eos> You'll travel, and you will meet interesting people.<eos> Think about it.<eos> Okay. I will.
Elijah and I have renewed the terms of our deal.<eos> Really?<eos> The two of you will come to no harm at my hands.<eos> I only ask for one thing in return.<eos> What?<eos> An apology.<eos> A what?<eos> I'm sorry for the part That I played in your death.<eos> I was protecting elena.<eos> I will always
What do you mean, wh...<eos> I told you what happened.<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Tim, you're with Raylan.<eos> Yes, sir. Keep him safe and sound.<eos> Unless you see him attempting to participate in this investigation, in which case you have my permission to shoot him.<eos> Rachel, the, uh, the guest room is just at the top of the stairs.<eos> Thank you, but I'm not here to sleep.<eos> I need to take a look around.<eos> Well, I'll...
You know, I'm trying to make a heartfelt apology here.<eos> No, I mean, it smells like actual crap.<eos> I think we found our ride.<eos> Listen, when I hop off, you're gonna want to stay on this course, find a hole in the fence.<eos> Wait, wait! You're hopping off?<eos> Look, there's too many guards.<eos> We can't outrun 'em.<eos> - I'm gonna have to buy you some time.<eos> - How will you get out of here?<eos> I probably won't.
You got a date?<eos> Just a friend.<eos> Want to tell me what happened today?<eos> I messed up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I messed up, and I'm taking my punishment like a big girl.<eos> It's okay, Uncle jarek.<eos> No, it's not okay, okay?<eos> I'm not gonna lose you to some boneheaded mistake.<eos> You won't.
I know. I have.<eos> - Well, there's a mutable barrier, then.<eos> - Frank's stupid, we knew.<eos> That he's a rat playboy operator, I hadn't realized.<eos> I don't want to turn bitter.<eos> - l worry for Frank. I care about him.<eos> - Well, I'd stop.<eos> No.<eos> I love Frank.<eos> I always will.
Cover song by cover song, we are shaping the youth of America. Unh.<eos> I'm not allowed to do that anymore.<eos> - Are you family?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, only one of you can come in.<eos> Um, Mom.<eos> Mom, go ahead, please.<eos> Just make sure she knows we're all out here, okay?<eos> I will.
You're gonna have a permanent teacher on Monday.<eos> - Where are you going, Mr. Barthes?<eos> - I'll go to another school.<eos> - We will miss you, man.<eos> All those teachers in this place... They're dickheads.<eos> Don't you get tired of moving around all the time?<eos> It's how my job works.<eos> I come in here for a period of time, so you don't have twnenty subs in and I'm outa here, and then, you have a permanent teacher come in and I leave.<eos> Attention to all teachers, this is an special announcement from the Principle's Office.<eos> There will an all faculty meeting today, during nutrition"
He said he'd be back.<eos> That's all I know.<eos> Debbie, just listen to me.<eos> I'm listenin', Marcus.<eos> You're not listenin'.<eos> I ain't goin' away with you.<eos> I can't.<eos> Daddy?<eos> You mean you won't.<eos> Right. I won't.
I stand corrected.<eos> (chuckles) And here I was talking about nannies.<eos> PARSONS: I'm taking my witness's statement in the morning.<eos> HEWES: This is going to be a big step for you, Ellen.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> PARSONS: Thanks.<eos> I... I should run. I'm sorry.<eos> HEWES: I'll take care of this. Don't worry.<eos> So you'll think about the playdate?<eos> PARSONS: I will.
They were gonna retrieve it after the war, but, obviously, that never happened.<eos> How do you know this?<eos> Because one of the crewmen survived.<eos> He was my father.<eos> Why do you need me?<eos> The crew rigged the interior with explosives to prevent enemy access.<eos> I need someone who can open it without setting the charges off.<eos> Luckily, I already know the best. That's why you're here, Neal.<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> You won't.
The time has come, sister.<eos> You must put your plot against Dooku into effect now.<eos> He isn't ready, Mother.<eos> He needs more training.<eos> He has to be ready.<eos> Together, the two of you will be able to eliminate the Count.<eos> But you must act now.<eos> We cannot keep your new assassin a secret forever.<eos> I will have my revenge.<eos> You will, sister.

Impossible.<eos> I have been here for more years than I care to remember.<eos> I am a Jedi.<eos> We don't give up easily.<eos> Jedi?<eos> But so young.<eos> Where is your master?<eos> He will come for me.<eos> And if he does not?<eos> He will!
Now, he's getting his butt branded?<eos> I think Dale wants more than just tradition and brotherhood.<eos> - I can relate.<eos> - It's week one, spidey.<eos> Be patient.<eos> - He wants to meet a girl.<eos> - We'll get you that, too. - That'd be nice.<eos> - No, I meant Dale.<eos> All we have to do is find him a girl before Omega chi does and he'll drop out.<eos> - A little divine intervention, if you will. - I will.
The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring to this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it.<eos> And the glow from that fire can truly light the world.<eos> And so, my fellow Americans, ask not what your country can do for you.<eos> Ask what you can do for your country.<eos> Bahía de Cochino, Mr. President-- Bay of Pigs, on the southern Cuban coast.<eos> For the past 18 months, we at the CIA have been training a brigade of anti-Castro guerillas in Guatemala.<eos> Yes, I'm aware of that.<eos> Then I'm sure you're also aware that President Eisenhower approved this training and its ultimate purpose-- the--the elimination of Fidel Castro.<eos> Well, I'm certainly for his, uh, elimination. I just question whether or not this will, uh, work.<eos> I think-- Yes, it will, Mr. President.
Who started it?<eos> Take Jay out of town for a couple of days.<eos> Everything cash.<eos> I'm not going anywhere.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Feels like I've been away too long already.<eos> He's just trying to steady the boat.<eos> And we don't need you jumping all over it.<eos> We'll have to see what Glickman says about that.<eos> Yeah, we will.
It was my mistake.<eos> Mistake?<eos> It cost my son his life.<eos> Your son was killed instantly, Mr Delaney.<eos> No amount of backup would've saved him.<eos> But you also lost a killer. He got away!<eos> And no-one even knows what he looks like!<eos> We'll find him.<eos> How?<eos> We will.
So you've come here to tell me the truth because you think I'll respect that?<eos> That's how it worked out last time. Hmm.<eos> So what do you want to do now?<eos> Stick to the plan.<eos> Because you like the plan?<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> But right now you owe me one million and in four days' time, if we stick to the plan, you'll owe me four million with no means to pay.<eos> But in three months you'll have turned over 10 million and all our debts will be cleared.<eos> Only if your plan works out.<eos> It will.
I...<eos> Listen, I'm not saying that I think you have to call her.<eos> But I just think that you should.<eos> I'm not trying to pry.<eos> I just want to know what your intentions are about my daughter.<eos> I love her.<eos> You need to call her. Yeah.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I definitely will.
And we've found several other corridors like this one.<eos> There should be enough for everybody, and thanks to the, uh...<eos> Uh, research that Brody and I have already done, we know they work.<eos> Three years.<eos> Give or take.<eos> You keep saying that.<eos> What Eli is neglecting to mention is that a jump like this is going to require every last ounce of power we have, and if his calculations are off--<eos> They're not.<eos> And we fall short even by a fraction, a tenth of one percent--<eos> We won't.
I need a number.<eos> I'll say a dozen.<eos> Plus you and me?<eos> No, including us.<eos> So, 10.<eos> Yeah, look, I've written down most of what I intend to say.<eos> If you've got anything you might want to add...<eos> So, I'll speak when you're done.<eos> But just so we're clear, if we don't get the 10 volunteers...<eos> We will.
Go?<eos> What do you mean go? Where are you going?<eos> Well, we're dying, my love.<eos> It's time for Auntie and Uncle to pop off.<eos> - I'm against it but...<eos> - It's your fault, isn't it, sweets?<eos> 'Cause you told House it was the last Tardis.<eos> House can't feed on them if there's none more coming, can he?<eos> So now he's off to your universe to find more Tardises.<eos> - It won't.
Sir, he is a very decent boy.<eos> I don't know why he misbehaved today.<eos> He didn't misbehave, son.<eos> He has a clear conscience.<eos> His intentions are clear just like yours.<eos> The truth us, son..<eos> ..today he has said..<eos> .. what I wanted to.<eos> But.. I couldn't muster the courage.<eos> Son, will you..
I do not know why.<eos> Excellency,<eos> I also have a letter from your mother telling of a conspiracy against Pope Alexander, forged by della Rovere, the Colonna, the Orsini and Naples.<eos> They plot an attack on the Eternal City.<eos> I must go to Rome and warn him.<eos> Yes. But without the Pope's permission? I will be walking towards my death.<eos> Or towards your life.<eos> This could be the sign from God for which you have been waiting.<eos> I want Giovanni to want me tonight.<eos> He will, Lucrezia.
Yep, yep, yep. Got it, got it.<eos> Got the number.<eos> Wait, are you...<eos> are you still there?<eos> Go ahead, say it.<eos> - Say what?<eos> - Oh, just get it out.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> I don't know how you do it.<eos> Well, you will, one day.
- OK.<eos> You know the first thing he said to me?<eos> - Where did I get this idea?<eos> I hope he told him he got the idea from you.<eos> Well, I mean, you know, we really, he and I really developed it together.<eos> It's changed a lot since the version that I started with.<eos> It's not right.<eos> You should be at the lunch.<eos> - Harcourt should know you. - He will.<eos> He will.
Mmm, that tastes like melted jelly beans.<eos> We should probably be showing some affection if we want to effectively convey that we're a couple.<eos> So...<eos> You can put your hand on my thigh for five seconds. Okay. Any further north, you'll be pulling back a stump.<eos> Okay.<eos> Unpleasant childhood.<eos> Maybe some...<eos> some daddy issues.<eos> Other than that, I can't figure you out, Philly.<eos> You never will.
Then try.<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know what that cab is?<eos> It's a gift, from my father to one of his oldest friends.<eos> And so?<eos> This friend happens to have a daughter who just turned 18 last month.<eos> Is she your girlfriend?<eos> - No.<eos> I've never even met her.<eos> But I will, in a couple of days.
That's really... God, Nick!<eos> What? What?<eos> You're... you're jabbing into me with... it.<eos> Yeah, he's feeling left out.<eos> Argh, not... not there!<eos> Argh, not... not there!<eos> Do you want to go on top?<eos> Quickly.<eos> I'm trying.<eos> It won't...
You'll see two hot wires and a neutral.<eos> Strip the neutral.<eos> Hang on, I got to make a quick wire stripper out of the soda can.<eos> Look at you, improvising without me.<eos> Done.<eos> All right, break the light bulb and attach the filament to the battery of your cellphone.<eos> The filament conducts the charge...<eos> Which creates a surge, shorts the power, and the locking mechanism should release.<eos> "Should"?<eos> It will.
Keller's on his way, too.<eos> FBI!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Jones, it's me!<eos> Yeah, clear around back.<eos> There he is...<eos> Escape artist extraordinaire, Peter Burke.<eos> What happened with Keller?<eos> He hasn't shown.<eos> He won't.
Excuse me, Sam.<eos> Another woman was just reported missing.<eos> Her husband said she had car trouble.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm gonna have to leave.<eos> Promise me one thing.<eos> You'll give me five minutes alone with this guy.<eos> I'll do the same thing to him he did to her.<eos> That's what he deserves, not jail, and he has to pay for what he did to my mother.<eos> He will.
The Ash's compound.<eos> Thank you.<eos> For still looking out for me.<eos> You kinda sprung some big stuff on me!<eos> Trading in your feelings to save my life--<eos> That's one messed-up love letter.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Alone.<eos> You owe me at least that.<eos> We will.
There's gotta be a way out--<eos> Better see to your chores.<eos> Chores? ! Yes, insane Martha Stewart!<eos> That is definitely what we should be worrying about.<eos> Baba Yaga-- Don't say her name.<eos> You really don't want to draw attention to yourself in this place.<eos> C'mon--<eos> Help us prepare to the feast.<eos> Bo, I don't know where I am.<eos> So how will you?
Think about the Marquis.<eos> OK, kisses...<eos> I mean, later.<eos> Thomas!<eos> Yes, Vincent!<eos> What's up?<eos> Thomas, I'm your boss, but I'm also your friend.<eos> So, Thomas, I'll tell you something and in the name of our friendship,<eos> I'll ask you not to answer.<eos> OK, in the name of our friendship, I won't.
Why were you mistaken for the Marquis?<eos> Because I said I was.<eos> How could you pass for the Marquis?<eos> -What marshmallows?<eos> Marshmallows made from beaten egg whites.<eos> Do you realize the shit you got us into?<eos> Wait, it's not my fault. I didn't ask to escape.<eos> Then, let's see how Jo reacts.<eos> I can hear the rip saw.<eos> You won't.
Yeah, he warned me.<eos> Look, it's my fault. Blame me.<eos> It's my fault. No.<eos> No, I'm not gonna blame you,<eos> And I'm not gonna blow up at you And storm of here like some child.<eos> That's not how I want this to end.<eos> All I ever wanted was to make you happy. That's it.<eos> And I'm so sorry that I couldn't do that.<eos> But I still love you, 'nessa.<eos> And I always will.
Are you familiar with minders, finders, and grinders, Pindar?<eos> Yes, minders take care of the clients, finders sign new ones, and grinders do the grunt work.<eos> And what are you?<eos> Somebody has to descend into the coal mine and hunt for precedents and obscure law.<eos> I am proud to be a grinder.<eos> Fair enough, but do you get the respect you deserve from Franklin and Bash for being a grinder?<eos> Pindar, tell the truth.<eos> Yes, he does.<eos> All right, well, let us know if you change your mind and you'd like to join our team.<eos> I will.
Can we talk about something I wanna talk about?<eos> How are things going with you and Lady Bear Cole?<eos> - I don't wanna talk about that either.<eos> - Oh, come on.<eos> She didn't call me back.<eos> Well, when she does, you got a good story.<eos> You were abducted.<eos> That'll score you points.<eos> - Yeah, if she calls.<eos> - She will, Nicky D.
It was kind of starting to feel like home again.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This is always gonna be your home.<eos> But while Koji's a free man, and until this is over and I know it's safe for you to be here...<eos> I'm having a déjà vu moment.<eos> It's just like before, when Dad brought both of us here but put us on different planes back to the mainland.<eos> I haven't talked to you in ten years, and I never saw Dad again.<eos> Hey.<eos> We're gonna see each other again, okay?<eos> Hey, we will.
But we don't have a moment to waste.<eos> Some of you will be taken to the portal array's location to finish the infrastructure.<eos> Depending on your specialties, the rest will do final design work, helping us obtain the rest of what we need.<eos> We own these homes... and the land they sit on.<eos> But this is nothing.<eos> Once we use the portal to bring our people here, then we will own it all.<eos> - Are you ready?<eos> You understand the size of the array we're building, the amount of fuel we're going to need?<eos> - This operation needs to work.<eos> - It will.
I declared my love for you...<eos> I think "Undying"...<eos> I'd have to check my notes.<eos> Look, I'm in a relationship with somebody.<eos> I get that, Rachel, but on the chance you're with that guy by default,<eos> - I'm not.<eos> - Or that you really want to be with me,<eos> - I don't.<eos> - I thought, should you ever want to get back with me,<eos> - I won't.
I'll have to go and get some.<eos> I told you, damn it! I told you we were running low!<eos> Am I supposed to stay here all on my own?<eos> What do you think? You have Lucky.<eos> He'll protect you.<eos> No! You're not going anywhere!<eos> Besides, there are snakes here.<eos> Necla, I'm at the end of my rope.<eos> Get in the car!<eos> No, I won't!
Can I ask you to think?<eos> Banish these dogs!<eos> Come!<eos> General six professors from the University came to tell Aung San Suu Kyi that the people supported it.<eos> That's it?<eos> They are fighting for democracy they want it to take the lead.<eos> It shall not proceed further?<eos> That's it.<eos> Well, okay.<eos> Tomorrow, Aung San Suu Kyi will to Shwedagon.
Those guns.<eos> You know, Ethan could never pull this off.<eos> Equipment manager?<eos> Please.<eos> I know.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll do it if you cover my share for the band for Ben thing.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will, okay?
Whoa, whoa, topless?<eos> Wait a minute!<eos> Where?<eos> How?<eos> Okay, please stop.<eos> What's going on?<eos> She's very symmetrical.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Don't blow it.<eos> No, no, Officer, I won't.
How do I know she's alive?<eos> Daddy?<eos> Josie?<eos> Daddy, I'm so scared.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> There's your proof of life.<eos> Now get the money or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please, she's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.
Daddy?<eos> Josie?<eos> Daddy, I'm so scared.<eos> It's gonna be okay, I promise.<eos> There's your proof of life.<eos> Now get the money or we'll send you proof of death.<eos> Please, she's our little girl.<eos> You have to find her.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
You thought you could keep something like that from me?<eos> - Boy, you're dumber than I thought.<eos> - I had to work the fields.<eos> You are such a pig.<eos> Whoa, I'm sorry I didn't tell you, but you're kind of making me feel bad.<eos> Well, you should feel bad. You're cheating on my mother.<eos> - What? I never cheated on you. Mm-hm.<eos> Then why are you here with your tail between your legs?<eos> I came to tell you I don't have a high school diploma.<eos> And now, thanks to Lumpy, the study partner, I never will.
I don't get it.<eos> Hey, Arab.<eos> There's a bunch of sculptures over there.<eos> Sculptures?<eos> Oh right, yes.<eos> There's a lot around here.<eos> They're paying you overtime, right, doctor?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I expect so.<eos> They will.
- I think I'm a great example. - Mm-hm...<eos> Maybe I could tone it down a little.<eos> But I can't promise it won't happen again.<eos> I've had my share of psycho sorority sister moments in my day, putting you through hell most of your pledging.<eos> So enjoy this place while you're here, because one day you're gonna go off into the big bad world,<eos> and there won't be little sisters to ream or Golden Lilies to get crazy over.<eos> Guess I'll do a shot for you if we win the Lily.<eos> I know we'll...<eos> - I know you'll win it.<eos> - Oh, we totally will.
No.<eos> Does that make you feel better or worse?<eos> It doesn't make me feel anything.<eos> ( Door opens, closes )<eos> She looks like him, don't she, My Lord?<eos> She has his nose, his black hair.<eos> Aye.<eos> Tell him when you see him, My Lord.<eos> If it please you, tell him how beautiful she is.<eos> I will.
For the grad wall.<eos> Okay, let's roll.<eos> Wait, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Put her down. I have got the apnea monitor, the o-2...<eos> Oh, Callie, you need to steal some of those NICU blankets.<eos> - They're the best. - Okay, everybody, stop.<eos> No matter how hard we work at it...<eos> She's not ready.<eos> No, she can't leave. She's-she's been watched by doctors 24 hours a day.<eos> She still will.
- You're gonna be fine.<eos> You're doing great. Come on.<eos> Whew.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Right here.<eos> - Okay. You can let go of my hand now. All right.<eos> Don't trip. Don't trip. Don't...<eos> You're not gonna trip.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
You promised, remember?<eos> I promised you breakfast.<eos> What's going on?<eos> You're right.<eos> Thanks for reminding me, babes.<eos> A treat for doing well in school.<eos> I did promise.<eos> I don't fancy this any more.<eos> Think I might have some cereal instead.<eos> Well, if you won't!
I don't know.<eos> Is he all right?<eos> I {\*just }don't want to go home when he's on his deathbed{\*, you know?<eos> }. I want to be there when he's still my dad.<eos> You definitely need to do that.<eos> And I want you to come with me.<eos> I know that's a lot to ask of a boyfriend.<eos> And I was thinking,{\* you know,} maybe, since given our last conversation,<eos> and that we're both ready...<eos> Michael Scott, will you...
It is impossible.<eos> Would you break hers too?<eos> I will make it up to you.<eos> How?<eos> What is he,Micheletto?<eos> Benedictine,or Franciscan?<eos> He belongs to a mendicant order,Your Eminence.<eos> Well,where is his begging bowl,then?<eos> He has yet to find one.<eos> But he will.
To spill the blood of your mother's husband?<eos> To beat him like a common pimp?<eos> If that is what he is, Father-<eos> If that is what he is, then what does that make you?<eos> You've heard the rumour. That one of us was sired by him, and not by you, not by the Pope of Rome?<eos> And you want to feed these rumours?<eos> What is all of Rome talking about now?<eos> - I will not have him in her house!<eos> - You will-<eos> You will not?
Dottore...<eos> You can leave us now.<eos> I need advice, dottore, on a delicate matter.<eos> The deposition of a pope.<eos> Delicate indeed.<eos> And, if I may say so, dangerous.<eos> Stop that.<eos> You have done penance enough.<eos> Who then will forgive us, Your Holiness?<eos> God will.
Well, have you seen any indication?<eos> What's he been up to lately?<eos> I don't follow... sir.<eos> Well, who's he been meeting?<eos> I'm afraid 'm not able to say anything more, sir, until I'm convinced of your bona fides.<eos> - Hugh?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We're both here.<eos> Where are we? My eyes haven't adjusted.<eos> They won't.
Said it hasn't happened since, but what if he's wrong?<eos> What if the infection in the brain is causing it to happen all the time?<eos> His E.E.G. didn't show any sign of seizure activity.<eos> I didn't say it was a seizure.<eos> I said it was something like a seizure.<eos> And I'm guessing you're about to tell us we need to find something like an E.E.G. to prove...<eos> Nope, 'cause I already got one.<eos> You want me to sing?<eos> How's singing My Bonnie gonna help you see inside my brain?<eos> It won't.
How's Lewis?<eos> Alive.<eos> But not good.<eos> I want to go down there, but the idea of seeing him in recovery strapped to a bunch of wires...<eos> I don't know if I can do it.<eos> Well, there's probably no point to it, Harry.<eos> He'll just be sedated.<eos> Hey, man, get at me soon.<eos> I got nothing so far on which gang we're dealing with, but I will.<eos> I will.
It so wasn't. I said I was sorry.<eos> Tell this wildlife you're sorry when the pipeline blows because we're not there to protect it.<eos> A, all this wildlife can suck it.<eos> Everything out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria.<eos> And B...<eos> No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.<eos> Would you just...? Yeah.<eos> Okay, let's set up a defensive perimeter.<eos> Right after I set up the grill.<eos> Will you just...?
We will.<eos> For Molly.<eos> Okay?<eos> And for Jeremy.<eos> We build it in stages.<eos> - What's this?<eos> - Our new business plan.<eos> We start with six pumps instead of eight.<eos> We can always add more later if we've got the tank capacity,<eos> - which we will, okay?
You mean she'll explode?<eos> I don't think even Odin could make a woman explode with pleasure.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Do what you feel is right.<eos> But how will I know it is right?<eos> You will know.<eos> How?<eos> Only you know that.<eos> No,I don't.<eos> You will.
- If you want me to stay, I will.<eos> - No. No.<eos> You've done enough.<eos> You've risked a lot.<eos> - I had a dream when I was detoxing, And it felt real.<eos> I saw myself in the future...<eos> After I had gotten my revenge, And that person scared the hell out of me.<eos> I realized what you said was right.<eos> I have a chance to get out before it's too late, And I have to take it.<eos> - You will.
- But I would let him go to prison For the rest of his life and yours.<eos> - There's not a prison on earth That division can't negotiate him from.<eos> - Beijing bombing 2008--<eos> Kasim was responsible.<eos> You think that if I drop kasim in the president of china's lap<eos> That division could negotiate his release?<eos> Didn't think so.<eos> Now, be a good boy and do as you're told.<eos> - You're gonna regret this.<eos> - One of us will.
I kissed her.<eos> I saw.<eos> I want a semi-freaking normal life.<eos> Medical examiner determines killer of girl to be animal, not human.<eos> Derek not killer.<eos> Let out of jail.<eos> You did this to me!<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Hunters.<eos> The kind that have been hunting us for centuries. Us?<eos> You mean you!<eos> You did this to me!<eos> Is it really so bad, Scott?<eos> That you can see better... Hear more clearly, move faster than any human could ever hope?<eos> You've been given something that most people would kill for.<eos> The bite is a gift.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> You will.
Your grandaddy is a bit of a bully.<eos> But I must see them.<eos> I've come all this way.<eos> Of course it's a disappointment.<eos> You said yourself there wouldn't be another chance.<eos> Maybe you should write to them after all.<eos> You've nothing to lose. No.<eos> They have to see him.<eos> They must see Charlie.<eos> Well, maybe they will...
I am a priest,<eos> I live alone.<eos> Rodrigo... Be gone from my sight.<eos> And go where?<eos> Rodrigo, please.<eos> Perotto and I long to be married.<eos> As much as we hope to please you, Lucrezia that is not possible.<eos> Tomorrow you will leave for Spain to become a nun, as you so devoutly wished.<eos> And you will care for your brother's orphaned children.<eos> I will not.
Yeah, but what happens if Trevor gets reassigned and you have to leave Fort Marshall?<eos> Well, a lot of things can happen, right?<eos> I just... I got to be more prepared.<eos> Yeah, I don't know, Rox.<eos> I mean, this week has been just awful.<eos> I know I can't wrap my head around anything right now.<eos> Are you sure this is the best time to be thinking about this?<eos> Well, when should I?<eos> No, I'd just hate to see you do anything you'll regret.<eos> I won't.
That way they comp everything.<eos> I call it the Sterling Archer Triple-A Power Play.<eos> And yes, the A stands for "awesome."<eos> - Did you get a receipt?<eos> - Of... Of course I did.<eos> Obviously, I did that.<eos> Now if you will excusez-moi...<eos> Ah, Monsieur Archer.<eos> If you will please to follow me to le suite royale where I took a liberty to have a woman waiting in your Jacuzzi.<eos> Yes, I will.
Well, how did it go?<eos> He wasn't supposed to get all teary on me.<eos> My heart is pounding.<eos> Thank you. Thanks for driving me out. Thanks for coming back.<eos> No... Oh, please, Sarah.<eos> I mean, come on, I'm here for you.<eos> I couldn't get on the plane fast enough.<eos> I don't know how I'm gonna deal with this.<eos> You will deal with this.<eos> Of course you will.
Well, aren't we the fucking Kennedys.<eos> A good breakfast is a good way to start the day.<eos> Yeah, another day of sitting on our asses, waiting for OIS to clear us on the restaurant shooting.<eos> Pancakes?<eos> You do realize the bar is set very high with me and pancakes.<eos> My dad's were the best.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I wanted to do this the other night, but the shooting sort of messed everything up.<eos> Debra Morgan, will you--?
- Sorry I'm late.<eos> - She's Andreea, my friend.<eos> Wanna grab a drink?<eos> What do you say, Andreea?<eos> Let's go.<eos> - God, this is so cold!<eos> - It freezes your mouth!<eos> And your tongue, and your lips.<eos> - Will you come to the seaside with me?<eos> - Yes, I will.
No.<eos> Let's go!<eos> God have mercy on her!<eos> I know you didn't do it.<eos> But I need your statement.<eos> Whom you delivered her to, who was in charge with her.<eos> It's your only chance.<eos> Tell me everything!<eos> I want to talk to my lawyer!<eos> You will.
Hey, Sumida!<eos> What are you doing all wet?<eos> She's here again!<eos> Are you dating?<eos> Are you two in love?<eos> Oh, my God, it's late!<eos> I have to go.<eos> Off I go and I'll be back.<eos> Don't come back!<eos> I will!
It's taken.<eos> I'm, I'm a nonsmoker, good credit, no pets, call me back.<eos> Nice try, nice try, but I already left a message.<eos> Looks like the bull bucked you off, son.<eos> Okay, Dad.<eos> Um, see, the thing is, a friend really screwed me over and...<eos> And I was supposed to take my senior year off and motorcycle through South America, but some skinny Beverly Hills brat told my parents I was growing pot, so, uh...<eos> I'm going to need the place more than you.<eos> So I guess we're just going to have to see who gets it.<eos> Hmm, yeah, we will.
You're a chubby kid in a mascot suit.<eos> That's what I'm saying.<eos> I should cheat.<eos> Dad says it's okay when it's for entertainment.<eos> That's right! Let's cheat!<eos> - You see that pelican? - Yeah.<eos> You're running, right?<eos> You have a switchblade taped to your shoe.<eos> He does?<eos> He will.
Think about your mother.<eos> Hasn't she suffered enough?<eos> Get away from me!<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Listen to me, okay?<eos> I can help you.<eos> All right? I can talk to the D.A. I can tell him it was an accident.<eos> You didn't mean to hurt those people.<eos> - It won't make a difference.<eos> It will, Ben.
I'm happy for you.<eos> It'll be great.<eos> Going somewhere?<eos> No.<eos> Why do you have your passport?<eos> It's- it's not mine.<eos> It's Ian's.<eos> I need it for the insurance claim on my ring.<eos> it still hasn't turned up?<eos> It will.
Okay. See you in a bit.<eos> They're gone.<eos> I'm glad Samantha turned out to be an ally.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Me, too. Did bring up some old ghosts, though... Like Elizabeth.<eos> I know you feel responsible for her death, but it wasn't your fault.<eos> I still think about her every day, Charlie.<eos> My daughter loved you very much.<eos> Never forget that.<eos> - I won't. - Goodbye John.
Go on. Go on.<eos> Poke holes.<eos> You can't, because everything I have done up until now has been completely legal -- you know, except for the murder.<eos> And breaking my taillight.<eos> I'm not just arresting you for murder. I'm arresting you so your clients can get better representation.<eos> Okay, I know that killing an embezzler or even an actor should never have been plan "A," but I never would have done any of this if it weren't for the fact that I am absolutely, totally dead broke.<eos> What?<eos> ! And the money you were paying to have Mr. Hirschbaum served?<eos> I don't have it. I never did.<eos> A-and now I -- I never will.
Spoilsport.<eos> Gaffer, come and have a look at this!<eos> 'I thought we'd never get him out.'<eos> You all right about that?<eos> Maxine and Craig? Yeah.<eos> She's happy, so I'm pleased.<eos> She's a good mate.<eos> Been mates since uni.<eos> That'll change.<eos> Will it?
It might have helped them to see that you would never rape a woman.<eos> They didn't want help.<eos> And I'm not hurting my family any more than I already have.<eos> Not to prove something that the DNA will prove for me.<eos> Those kids are my godchildren.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> And now, because of you people, they think I'm the one who did it.<eos> You know what...<eos> Don't come here again.<eos> I won't.
So what happened that night?<eos> When you saw that gun, you froze.<eos> It's nothing.<eos> Your hand was shaking.<eos> That's not nothing.<eos> Castle, it's my second day back.<eos> That's all.<eos> It's no big deal.<eos> And if it happens again?<eos> It won't.
Rocky's better.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> I'm quitting because I stink.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You're great.<eos> They stink!<eos> Stay in class and we can dance together.<eos> We'll make each other look good.<eos> Really?<eos> Okay. I will.
Maybe we need to stop being so judgmental.<eos> This is that whole 113 years of Zen philosophy, isn't it?<eos> You know what I mean.<eos> I really don't, but I do know what you're going to say.<eos> Something I need you to check for me, Henry.<eos> Of course there is.<eos> No tears, babe.<eos> You said we'd get the money, Bruno.<eos> You said this would work.<eos> It will,
Yes. Yes, you're right.<eos> That ex-Security officer's incredibly slippery.<eos> Apparently he ran some kind of dodgy business in the 1 990s, but nobody's ever been able to prove anything against him.<eos> Dad hasn't done anything to deserve all this.<eos> Eva...<eos> Yes?<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss you, too.<eos> Take care. And kiss dad for me.<eos> - I will. - Bye bye.
- His father was an agent.<eos> - That's just a rumour!<eos> My brother worked with Zygmunt down the mine, so I know.<eos> Because he gabbed to me that it was Zygmunt who started it!<eos> There's a whole security police cordon and he takes them on with a brick?<eos> None of our boys wanted a fight. They just wanted to yell slogans!<eos> They'd have got the shit beaten out of them. But there'd have been no corpses!<eos> Only Daddy had to fucking give things a shove...<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - No, I won't!
We have a situation on our hands.<eos> Should be home soon.<eos> Do you have Jane's phone?<eos> Pretty sure it's in the back.<eos> Look, I need you to text Cassie and tell her that Jane's home already.<eos> Why?<eos> She told Cassie she was going to the lake house.<eos> The kids are headed up there to check on her.<eos> When we made Henry's death look like a heart attack, the idea was that the neighbor would find him, not Faye.<eos> She won't.
I need you to trust me that it's just something I'm dealing with for myself, so...<eos> [Laughter] I really want to play hard to get, but I've never been good at it, so...<eos> I'm glad you're not good at it.<eos> Sajdah's the first woman that I've been in a relationship with who, like... like, she really cares.<eos> And I'm willing to take the risk with her emotionally, um, because I just feel she's worth it and we've had, like, so many great times.<eos> So I... I still believe that we can have a whole lot more.<eos> So this means we're trying it again?<eos> Would you be my girlfriend all over again?<eos> No, I'm playing.<eos> Yes, I will.
It indicates you thought your husband would be a handful... even before you went to pick him up.<eos> GABRIEL It kind of undercuts the whole idea... that you went up on the mountain with Bob and had a spontaneous argument.<eos> All right, well, so I had a feeling he might chicken out, and he did.<eos> Look, I actually made him sound a lot better than he was.<eos> And you have no idea, none, how jealous he was... that Missy and me were on television and he wasn't.<eos> Speaking of which, how soon will this video get out to the media?<eos> I'd say a year and a half-ish.<eos> A year and a half?<eos> But you said people would see me.<eos> Oh, people will.
I will settle this one.<eos> They should've proposed one already anyway.<eos> That's what I'm hearing. It's already underway unless you announce you're not gonna seek reelection.<eos> - Who else is involved?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> Ross-<eos> I need to know where he's vulnerable.<eos> I'm fucking done with him-- Impeachment hearings.<eos> Did you find her yet, the nurse?<eos> - Not yet. We will though.
The Boise police have offered everyone on this list a protective detail.<eos> Like that would have done Chelsea any good.<eos> She was killed in her hotel room.<eos> Jerry's not on the list.<eos> Let him help you.<eos> I'm out.<eos> Ever get volunteered for a job you don't want?<eos> So, as you can see from your board there, this kill list is weirdly similar to high school.<eos> Group one is like the popular kids-- prom court, football team, Dean's list.<eos> The Heathers, if you will.
Why have they been chosen and not the others?<eos> What do they know?<eos> Search me.<eos> I've told Carson.<eos> Will Mr Murray be staying?<eos> No, he wants to get to York.<eos> We'll meet him there the following day.<eos> My dear.<eos> I hope you can be strong if it goes against him.<eos> It won't.
Maybe yes, maybe no.<eos> Technically?<eos> Technically?<eos> Yes.<eos> Did you give Afsal Hamid a razor blade?<eos> No.<eos> That's it.<eos> You're free.<eos> - I hope I never see you again.<eos> - Oh, you will.
Stay close!<eos> Head for those trees.<eos> We'll cover you.<eos> Do you want to live?<eos> Now what?<eos> Now it's our turn.<eos> Who will cover us?<eos> Don't be a simpleton, Merlin.<eos> They haven't found the cargo.<eos> They will.
He was too afraid Little T's boys would be looking for him.<eos> He wasn't going nowhere, especially near the projects.<eos> Do you know of anyone he might have talked to, anyone who could have convinced him to leave?<eos> The only one he really trusted was you.<eos> I wish he'd trusted me enough to tell me about you and Destiny.<eos> Why?<eos> Maybe we'd be dead, then, too.<eos> Nobody could protect him from Little T.<eos> We're gonna get him, okay?<eos> We will.
I'm sold!<eos> Maybe I'll become a cop.<eos> Really?<eos> For sure.<eos> I'll look hot in uniform.<eos> Yeah, I know you'll be a great cop.<eos> So, promise... You'll do it, too, sis.<eos> What?<eos> So, don't give up, sis.<eos> I won't, either.
Get up, sis!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Some cops chase culprits without Knowing their faces.<eos> And some culprits run...<eos> An impairment in the heart<eos> Not being able to see is nothing.<eos> Daughter!<eos> Cheer up!<eos> So, don't give up, sis.<eos> I won't, either.
We're not racist, okay?<eos> We're a little bit narrow-minded and intolerant.<eos> Hey, don't forget. My mother thinks you're a real priest.<eos> Well, I was, once.<eos> What forced you out?<eos> The booze?<eos> Well, a little bit of that, you know.<eos> Mostly the scandals, the cover-ups, the dogma.<eos> Missed the pussy, didn't you?<eos> And you will, too, after three years of marriage.
And he planned on destroying the evidence.<eos> He wanted to have the house torn down right after those murders, but it was declared a landmark.<eos> So he used that passageway to scare off tenants like the Boyers, growing the mansion's legend so that no one would want to live there.<eos> And then when Jack Sinclair came sniffing around, he had to kill him, too.<eos> Great story. The DA will never buy it.<eos> It's all circumstantial.<eos> She's right.<eos> Anyone could've put that bulb in there.<eos> We have no proof.<eos> But we will.
But she's still a prostitute, Mac.<eos> We can get this guy, Jo.<eos> Jo?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanted to apologize for before.<eos> I didn't mean to be presumptuous about what you were feeling.<eos> Don't worry about that, Lindsay.<eos> The trust is, if I were really honest with myself, I do feel a little responsible, so hearing you say that to me, I just lost my cool for a second.<eos> We are gonna get this guy, Jo.<eos> We will.
We've got those traps after us, now we've got this Frank Butler after us.<eos> You know, I would say that things can't get much worse than this.<eos> I've come to collect the bank's money.<eos> The money you took.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> Unless you want to see that school teacher dead.<eos> His man's got Miss Catherine, Dan.<eos> He'll kill her if we don't give him the bank's money.<eos> Did you tell him that we don't have it?<eos> But we will by the end of tomorrow.
I`m so tired, I... But we`re so close. Your baby`s about to come.<eos> Every time you feel a contraction I need you to push. Okay?<eos> kristina: Okay, I will.<eos> I think I need to step out into the hallway for a second.<eos> No, you ain`t. You hold your lady`s hand.<eos> You keep your scrawny ass right where it is.<eos> You know, that`s not my wife.<eos> I don`t care if y`all married or not.<eos> Actually that wouldn`t be a bad idea.<eos> Will you? Okay.
Toothless can't come and go like the other dragons, and that's just not fair.<eos> I was up all night, and I think I found a way to fix that.<eos> No way!<eos> You built him a new tail?<eos> So he's gonna be able to fly without you!<eos> Wow!<eos> What a great gift.<eos> What if he never comes back?<eos> What am I saying?<eos> Of course he will.
No, I only hated what he did for a living.<eos> Ma'am...<eos> Do you know why Benny was in Brighton Beach last night?<eos> Was he--I don't know-- conducting business?<eos> Mrs. D'agostino...<eos> I know that anger you're feeling right now--<eos> What it's like to lose someone you love.<eos> Help us find the men who did this to your husband.<eos> It doesn't matter if you find them.<eos> Elias will.
You don't need that - to ask questions.<eos> - Let me just take care of this.<eos> What do you care, huh?<eos> What, you the loyal son all of a sudden?<eos> I'm counsel for the club.<eos> If she's really sitting on Bruno's murderer, she's gonna be surrounded by Feds.<eos> You think they're gonna let John Bianchi walk in that door?<eos> Fine. Do it.<eos> But if I don't have a name by the end of the day...<eos> You will.
You're weak.<eos> You let this place get the better of you.<eos> The house didn't do this to me.<eos> You did this to me.<eos> If I catch you peeping in my windows one more time... I'm gonna send Travis out to ruin the other half of your face.<eos> They're selling the house.<eos> No matter.<eos> I've told you.<eos> No one can own this house.<eos> No one ever will.
Hi.<eos> Neal?<eos> Lily?<eos> A year ago,<eos> I came here to a wedding I didn't want to go to and I knew that night that I had met my wife.<eos> You make all of my days better and I don't ever want to spend another one without you.<eos> Lily...<eos> Tonight, back where I first set eyes on you, in front of all of our... friends, will you please...<eos> say that you'll marry me?<eos> Yes, I will.
My husband.<eos> Hi.<eos> Good to meet you, Michael.<eos> Great to meet you.<eos> I don't wear a ring to work.<eos> It actually, uh, it nearly fell down the drain while I was washing up.<eos> Honey, we have a reservation.<eos> Yes.<eos> We'll figure it out tomorrow.<eos> Yep, we will.
You said you were gonna talk to her.<eos> Well, then I had a better idea to not talk to her.<eos> How is that a better idea?<eos> Because if we don't let her audition, she's still gonna have this dream, but if we let the universe say "no,"<eos> it'll crush this bad idea forever.<eos> Oh, my God, Mandy, you can't send these photos in.<eos> Girls!<eos> What's all the yelling about?<eos> Kristin doesn't like my photos.<eos> Yeah, well, you won't either.
I'm sure he's heard about my legal troubles at the agency.<eos> A man in my position might need some place to stash the money.<eos> Well, if he suspects anything, he'll kill us both.<eos> Then you'd better be convincing.<eos> I look forward to meeting your husband.<eos> Does Langley know about this plan?<eos> You mean Joan.<eos> Joan appreciates resourcefulness.<eos> All that matters is whether or not the job gets done.<eos> And it will.
Has your mom come to see you yet?<eos> No.<eos> And I don't want her to.<eos> I mean, I know I'll have to forgive her to move on, but... not today.<eos> You sound strong.<eos> Dr. Whitmere warned me it's only temporary.<eos> It's gonna be a long road back.<eos> I'll probably screw it up.<eos> No.<eos> No, you won't.
Why don't you take Zia to your parents' for Christmas while I nurse my allergies in one of the non-Christmas- celebrating states?<eos> You could go back to Michigan.<eos> It's still under Sharia law.<eos> Yeah, but they always make me wear a veil.<eos> Everything looks great, Maggie, but until this baby comes, I don't want you to make a sound.<eos> But she's our lead singer, mate.<eos> I'm sorry, but recent research has shown that the umbilical cord is also a vocal cord.<eos> Now can you tell me who the father is?<eos> Mmm...<eos> We will not.
Let's see... (Just filling it in... )<eos> How long would you sponsor a child like this for?<eos> Usually till they're eighteen.<eos> Eighteen?<eos> How old is she now? She's seven.<eos> Seven?<eos> A lot of them don't live till they're eighteen, do they?<eos> That IS the tragedy.<eos> Mm. So she might not last till she's, I don't know, twelve?<eos> Well, with your help, she will.
-Absolem?<eos> -Who are you?<eos> I thought we'd settled this.<eos> I'm Alice, but not that one.<eos> -How do you know?<eos> -You said so yourself.<eos> I said you were not hardly Alice, but you're much more her now.<eos> In fact, you're almost Alice.<eos> Even so, I couldn't slay the Jabberwocky if my life depended on it.<eos> It will.
Heal her or I'll kill you.<eos> - We have to take her inside.<eos> - No.<eos> - I'll kill you.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> - I can't help her.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> Do it or I'll kill you! - I can't.<eos> I won't!
Yes<eos> Where are you going to go?<eos> I really think that's up to the captain Spencer.<eos> What's with you kids?<eos> Jen shouldn't be coming home to a dark house.<eos> It's not safe<eos> I couldn't agree with you more sir.<eos> Did I leave my keys in the truck?<eos> I am not telepathic Spencer<eos> Maybe I'll just...
You kidding?<eos> Not a day goes by I don't think about that bike.<eos> - Yeah, well, I'm fixing her up.<eos> - You busted my bike?<eos> Twenty years in the shed, no tarp.<eos> I mean, she needed a little love.<eos> How does she run?<eos> Well, when I'm done, better than ever.<eos> Well, man, I'd like to see that.<eos> You will.
Okay. Did the name I got you... did it help?<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> It could be a big break.<eos> Did you find her?<eos> Look, um, I'm sorry. I...<eos> I don't mean to be rude, but, uh, I... I have to get going.<eos> Well, where are you headed?<eos> Just got to tell my wife that we've lost everything.<eos> But that's not what our broker statement says.<eos> No, but the next one will.
Because after having lived my own life for 25 years<eos> I've been living your life for the other 25.<eos> Hussainbhai she will never love Donsai.<eos> probably but she will definitely love Tej.<eos> Lotus, behave yourself and don't shout, Lotus<eos> It's cold.. - No!<eos> - It's quite cold.<eos> So what do you say?<eos> He won't come.<eos> He will.

- What?<eos> - I have to go.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> We can slow down.<eos> - I just have to go.<eos> - Hold on, hold on.<eos> Hold on. Hey!<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> - I know you don't, Nick.<eos> And you probably never will.
No more Chippewa casinos.<eos> You need our help, chief.<eos> - You heard Mike's proposal?<eos> - It's a tough call.<eos> It's a hell of a fees you're asking for.<eos> - But think of the billions that you're gonna saved.<eos> I can guaranteed you that goddamn Jena tribe casino will never opens.<eos> And before you know it, the Jena tribe gonna be back selling moccasins.<eos> You know, Mr. Abramoff, we can't afford to lose this one.<eos> You won't.
I don't want to not make plans with you.<eos> I want to make plans with you.<eos> You do?<eos> Yeah. I do.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> In all my life, I never thought I'd see you down on one knee.<eos> Yeah, it's getting a bit damp down here, so...<eos> What's it to be, Anna from Boston?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I will.
Da said, "guided by the spines of the echidna."<eos> Wait, you're an echidna!<eos> I am the echidna.<eos> And it was foretold you would need some help getting here.<eos> Well, then, I should tell you, we seek the Guardians.<eos> He should already know that.<eos> I do, doubter.<eos> Go on.<eos> Da said your spines can guide us.<eos> And they will.
- No, man.<eos> Lucy's training her to sell seminars with Dr. Bob.<eos> She calls the funeral directors... phone sales.<eos> Cool.<eos> - What's her name? - Connie.<eos> So I'll tell Lucy it's on.<eos> That's my uncle.<eos> Don't mention it. Hey.<eos> That it's... you know.<eos> - I won't. I won't. -
You know, I think it might come down more.<eos> - So do I.<eos> - Good call.<eos> Better to wait it out.<eos> And you call this Byzantine?<eos> Byzantine, Mediterranean. Whatever you need it to be.<eos> Hello, my peeps.<eos> The Fosters, I love them.<eos> - Dad, come play Legos with me.<eos> - Yes, yes, I will.
You sure it was him?<eos> Pretty sure.<eos> Proof?<eos> Just because there's no proof doesn't mean it isn't true.<eos> So you got a look at the plates?<eos> No plates.<eos> You got a candidate?<eos> I got a nominee.<eos> He'll have an alibi.<eos> He will.
Thank you.<eos> I'm not stupid, William.<eos> Three dead bodies and a pocket full of money?<eos> Doesn't take a genius to work out what the pair of you have been up to.<eos> I think it's the best bloody idea you've ever had.<eos> One condition... I want a pound for every body you sell.<eos> A pound?<eos> - Man starts getting fancy clothes... also starts getting fancy ideas.<eos> Just think of it as a tax between a man and a wife.<eos> A kind of nuptial agreement, if you will.
We have sent some letters out.<eos> - Can we have sent them to his mother?<eos> - Martin has no mother.<eos> So I usually get the letters. But I have not seen them.<eos> - She was run over by a roadhog. - I'm sorry.<eos> We are doing very well alone, ain't we Martin?<eos> - Are you going to the colony?<eos> - Yes, if I may.<eos> Of course you may.<eos> Will you?
I explain to you in Russian. They gave me only 3 days to get there and back.<eos> May they give the ticket.<eos> We do not have.<eos> You can go. Listen, he has a wife and small child in Daugavpils.<eos> I have to move the new place of service.<eos> For 20 th July.<eos> That's all I can. Cancel the reservation!<eos> Comrade Commissar, I am telling you as your:<eos> Forbidden to annihilate Reservations! We received a directive from headquarters:<eos> Only by special order. So you will not?
The advantage is that they're foreign Jews.<eos> If the Germans take back the scum that's fled here since '33, I've no objection.<eos> Neither do I, obviously.<eos> But... 10 000 falls a Iong way short.<eos> Offer them to the Germans, though.<eos> I have.<eos> Just in Paris, over half the Israelites are French nationals.<eos> Not to mention their children, all born in France.<eos> The Germans won't take the children.<eos> Won't they?
What is it?<eos> Something wrong with my jeans?<eos> No, nothing.<eos> - So everything's all right?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - You like them?<eos> - Yes.<eos> What have you got here?<eos> Don't mess them up.<eos> I won't.
A minor one.<eos> Try to keep calm.<eos> - Who knows about Antonio? - No one.<eos> Brunetti said he won't tell a soul.<eos> You're all I've got left.<eos> I lost your sister when she married that Neapolitan dickhead.<eos> Your brother won't even talk to me, he might as well be dead.<eos> You're my life, my blood, my breath.<eos> You have to help me.<eos> You will, won't you?
When she flew from the realms and the darker dreams<eos> Daddy!<eos> - Hey, Daddy.<eos> - Hey, morning, baby girl.<eos> Promise me, anything you don't know how to fix, you'll leave it for a handyman.<eos> Leslie, I got this.<eos> You worry about getting to work on time.<eos> - Have fun tonight on your date.<eos> - I will.
- Bella.<eos> - Morgan, his fiancee.<eos> So, I have a romantic dinner planned for us.<eos> And then we can do whatever you want afterwards, okay?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> We'll figure it out. - Hip down.<eos> - Breathe.<eos> - Well, I'll leave you guys to it.<eos> - Yeah, that feels good, right there.<eos> I'll just...
ZZZZZZZ....<eos> He said that he thinks he can get me out of the contract or at least renegotiate so that they have to pay me for as long as it's running.<eos> That's amazing.<eos> Will you guys go to the store with me so that I don't have to go by myself?<eos> Of course, we're almost done here.<eos> I bet you mean I 'destroyed' you.<eos> Oh...<eos> Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> "Unpause."<eos> Hey, no way, you'll a 'quitter' now!
I know you do.<eos> And there's nothing I want more than for you to come with us.<eos> I have been waiting so long for this day.<eos> We both have.<eos> But if something terrible happens, and you could have done something to stop it, I don't think you'd be able to live with yourself.<eos> Dad, it's okay. You can go.<eos> As soon as I'm finished here, I will get on a plane and I will be in L.A., I promise.<eos> - Just be careful, please.<eos> - Come here.<eos> I will.
It was a lot of fun.<eos> But where's this Elvis room you spoke about?<eos> - I know, don't worry.<eos> I promise we're getting there.<eos> Now, if you'll all follow me, please.<eos> Come on.<eos> - All right, best way to take this thing down is- hit the stress points.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Drake, he's gonna have to pay for what he did.<eos> - He will.
Our window of opportunity is closing.<eos> And why didn't the general call me himself?<eos> Perhaps he's losing confidence in your ability to complete our mission.<eos> This is my mission.<eos> My plan!<eos> Of course.<eos> But we're running out of time.<eos> If your brother dismantles our opposition forces, we will no longer be able to reconstitute our nuclear program.<eos> He won't succeed.<eos> At this rate, he will.
Madam President, what's the situation with Hassan?<eos> Is he safe?<eos> They have him, Ethan.<eos> The IRK agents have Hassan.<eos> Oh, dear God.<eos> They're going to kill him.<eos> Not if CTU can get there in time.<eos> There's a rescue operation underway.<eos> They know where he is?<eos> They will shortly.
Two slaves, broken by your hand, Made attempt on my life.<eos> Who purchased them?<eos> I know not of what you speak...<eos> I speak of being fucked. By the gods, by the magistrate, By that cock suck solonius and his grinning schemes!<eos> I'm of proud family!<eos> A family of means and history, you fucking cunt!<eos> You sold the men!<eos> Common slaves, Who tried to kill me, tried to fuck me like a whore!<eos> But I will not be fucked!<eos> I! Will! Not!
You know what?<eos> Just stop.<eos> That's all you do, is talk.<eos> You talk and you fuck things up.<eos> And I rip throats.<eos> I seriously doubt it.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> Well, then, I guess you'll see.<eos> Will I?<eos> Yeah, you will.
feeling good!<eos> Lemonade and dancing, I Iove this country! It's enough!<eos> I don't think it is enough.<eos> It's real simple, just tell us where she is.<eos> Now's the real fun and games, finally!<eos> You let them go and I won't hurt her.<eos> Her?<eos> Go ahead, see if I care<eos> I said let them go, now!<eos> Okay Cody, we will.
I was just never there for her.<eos> So what kind of a father am I?<eos> A father who never knew his daughter until she was 16.<eos> Children need things, but they also need your time, your help, and your love.<eos> Learn from my mistakes, Ricky.<eos> Find a way to be in your kid's life.<eos> You're a dad.<eos> And you're a good dad.<eos> You and Amy will find a way to do what's best for John.<eos> You will.
The ink is still in the deeper layers.<eos> It set off an allergic reaction.<eos> She was fine until she started the long-distance running.<eos> The ultra-marathoning modified her immune system and set off the allergic reaction.<eos> We did a full-thickness skin graft and she'll be okay.<eos> So, you were right in the end.<eos> It was her past.<eos> Did she get her memory back?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Will she?
Oh, Rebecca, thank you. Thank you.<eos> - Hi, darling.<eos> - You want to see your mom?<eos> Hi, sweet boy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'll be inside if you need anything.<eos> Okay. Thank you so much, Rebecca.<eos> Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Oh, Robert... What if I never see him again?<eos> You will.
- Hi, darling.<eos> - You want to see your mom?<eos> Hi, sweet boy.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - I'll be inside if you need anything.<eos> Okay. Thank you so much, Rebecca.<eos> Oh, my sweet, sweet, sweet boy.<eos> Oh, Robert... What if I never see him again?<eos> You will.<eos> You will.
Well, let me tell you... showbiz dreams are the most unrealistic of them all.<eos> But... that's what I want to do with my life.<eos> Oh, look, I'm not trying to hurt your feelings.<eos> I'm just trying to spare you disappointment.<eos> I think we get your point.<eos> Aw, well, Schuester here's a prime example.<eos> He used to have that glimmer ofhope in his eyes... that I can see right now in all of yours.<eos> But... he couldn't make it happen for himself... so he now has to try and convince you all that it'll happen for you. Guess what.<eos> His dream didn't work out.<eos> And neither will yours.
Do we know each other?<eos> You had an affair with me, '92.<eos> Ruth Fischer?<eos> I had an abortion back then.<eos> From me?<eos> For the creation of stem cells the crossbreeding of different cell types is not even necessary anymore.<eos> Didn't you discuss that?<eos> - Yes, we have, and I understand it in principle, but really I don't understand it.<eos> Well, then come and visit me at the institute.<eos> I will.
No.<eos> There's something I have to tell you.<eos> Mom, listen.<eos> It's very, very<eos> - I<eos> - I joined the peace ambassadors.<eos> You don't have to be afraid of the v's anymore.<eos> I'm not afraid of the visitors, ty.<eos> I'm just afraid of losing you.<eos> You won't.
Mercy.<eos> Hell's full of Indians, my friends.<eos> You were lucky tonight, ma'am.<eos> Don't want a blanket.<eos> Don't make it worse.<eos> Cold is the least of my troubles.<eos> It's only a few days north to the Columbia by my reckoning.<eos> I been keepin' notes.<eos> What if we don't find water soon?<eos> We will.
What are you going to do?<eos> Well, the first time he said he went to some woods. So he wouldn't hurt anyone.<eos> Or there's that room where it happened. George said he wouldn't use it again, I could go there.<eos> I mean about telling him.<eos> Oh, I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> Will you come with me?<eos> Well, it's the full moon tomorrow.<eos> I don't want to go on my own.<eos> Of course, yeah. Course I will.
Great to see you, lad.<eos> A hundred pounds?<eos> I'd lend it to you gladly if I could, but I need it to buy next year's wool.<eos> - When would you need it returned?<eos> - Early spring.<eos> Can you manage it?<eos> No. No, not unless...<eos> Why can't I sell you next year's wool?<eos> - You haven't got it yet.<eos> - But I will, in the spring.
This country has taken too much from him.<eos> I have a place.<eos> Come alone tonight, understand?<eos> Are you alone?<eos> I have people close behind, but they'll not interfere with what we do.<eos> Let me tell you something, you're a gangster,<eos> So technically, we really can't be seen together hang around togheter or even doing anything<eos> That's all I'm saying ...<eos> - Keep your words.<eos> - I will
You can make a go of things, get a better job, get out in the world, even... find love again one day.<eos> I want you to promise me you'll start to live your life now.<eos> Are you coming back?<eos> Are you coming back, Nina?<eos> I need you to promise me.<eos> I promise you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I love you, Nina.<eos> I love you too.<eos> I always will.
Step over these swords, it'll take away the bad luck.<eos> When did you become superstitious?<eos> Just getting old, I guess. when you realize you can't beat the odds, you'll become superstitious.<eos> You lost a lot?<eos> Because of what's going on, I didn't have the time to monitor the team.<eos> They bought in Euros and lost big time.<eos> First thing in the morning, got some explaining to do in London.<eos> Told Susan to book you a ticket as well.<eos> My agenda is till... Wednesday.<eos> Then it'll just you and I.
- We don't own a camera.<eos> - No, of course.<eos> Cameras have no optic nerve.<eos> The photos would only show their deformities.<eos> You have to go.<eos> I'm not supposed to have strangers in the house.<eos> Quite right. But may I use your bathroom?<eos> You know, my mother will be home soon.<eos> You should go.<eos> We will.
Homo sapiens persevered 100 millennia ago so something must have killed this virus.<eos> Slower metabolism, evolving blood types.<eos> Unless this wretched virus isn't organism-specific.<eos> If I had an animal, a cat or a mouse...<eos> No. No, no, no. No, there's no time for that, of course.<eos> Walter?<eos> What can I do?<eos> I can't let Peter die again.<eos> And he's going to.<eos> They all will.
But he deserves to know the truth about who he is.<eos> No. No, you don't understand.<eos> Things have never been better between us.<eos> I can't lose him again.<eos> - I can't.<eos> - You won't.<eos> Once he knows the whole story.<eos> Walter. You saved his life.<eos> I am sure that he will understand.<eos> No, he won't.
Denna.<eos> She can't have gone far.<eos> Lucinda, I'm glad you're all right.<eos> Actually, it's Dennee.<eos> It's true.<eos> I'm glad you're with us.<eos> But Lucinda, she lost her life so I could have this body.<eos> There was only enough magic to bring you back.<eos> We should find Denna before the trail goes cold.<eos> We will.
So, brother, do you think there'll be a good dinner?<eos> We'll come straight back if not.<eos> I have made up my mind always to wear black, to free myself from the tyranny of fashion.<eos> But today?<eos> Yes, Aunt, today.<eos> I charge you both, as ye will answer at the dreadful Day of Judgment, when the secrets of all hearts will be disclosed, if either of you know any impediment why you may not be joined together, ye must now confess it.<eos> Wilt thou have this woman to be thy wedded wife?<eos> I will.<eos> Wilt thou have this man to be thy wedded husband?<eos> I will.
The truth of the words of The Book of Counted Shadows can only be insured by a Confessor.<eos> Sorry about your neck.<eos> Leo Dane, though the road will be long and the outcome unknown, will you undertake this journey?<eos> I will.<eos> Will you leave behind your friends and all that you have known?<eos> I will.<eos> And though the forces of evil are sworn to bring about your death, still, will you go on?<eos> I will.<eos> And will you accept the name of the Seeker?<eos> I will.
Come here.<eos> There.<eos> Just... just tell her I'm not here.<eos> - You really like it?<eos> - I love it.<eos> Th... there's something about the way the forms are so constrained and then this blue line in the middle just flies off the canvas like...<eos> Like it just wants to keep going forever or you know...<eos> Honestly, I think it looks like something Libby did in second grade.<eos> Oh. Would you just tell him I loved?<eos> I will.
I'm beyond saving.<eos> We know that.<eos> How can you be so calm?<eos> They're getting closer to youvery day.<eos> We are the respectable ladies of mystic falls.<eos> Thanks to emily, we walk the streets in daylight.<eos> No one will ever suspect us.<eos> Not unless a human tells them.<eos> I'd sooner die.<eos> And soon enough, you will.
Cyril, call 911 from their phone and leave it off the hook... and Sterling.<eos> But this gun, it was a gift.<eos> Oh, please.<eos> Nobody gives you gifts.<eos> You don't know.<eos> Whatever you say, dear.<eos> Dr. Krieger?<eos> Now, then...<eos> Still didn't get the contract.<eos> Oh, but I will.
Um, just one little problem...<eos> No, there's no problem.<eos> You can call her.<eos> Could you give us, like, one quick second? Yeah, sure.<eos> I'll see you at the next hole. okay.<eos> Yeah, we'll, uh, be right there.<eos> There is absolutely no way i'm calling riley... To reminisce about a relationship... That just completely blew up.<eos> Owen likes the dynamic in the script.<eos> What if he senses, like, the major tension between us?<eos> No, no, no, he won't, okay?
It's all right.<eos> Let me look at it.<eos> Why now?<eos> Now is all there is.<eos> Want an apple?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> You've been sitting there all day.<eos> Why?<eos> All right.<eos> I'll just...
It's been a long time,John.<eos> Too long.<eos> No hard feelings.<eos> I wasn't a boy.<eos> We both knew the game. I wasn't the one married.<eos> Ah,it would've ended,anyway.<eos> Another one?<eos> I better not.<eos> I don't wanna regret anything in the morning.<eos> I won't if you won't.
Pardon?<eos> Well, I know you speak English. I believe it's one of your proudest achievements.<eos> Take your clothes off.<eos> You finally coming out as a gay man?<eos> Shit. Good for you.<eos> Somebody took a shot at Ava tonight.<eos> Old Raylan here put one in him.<eos> I want to make sure it ain't you.<eos> Get your clothes off.<eos> Well, I will if you will.
- There's no action?<eos> - No action.<eos> I don't see the point.<eos> He's just joking.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> I really don't see the point.<eos> If you change your mind, here's the info.<eos> We'd love to see you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Maybe we will.
Have some more salt.<eos> I always figured you'd say no.<eos> So why don't you grow a pair and find out?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Of course she's serious.<eos> Fine.<eos> Mike, give me a hand, will you?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> This is so romantic.<eos> Karen, will you...
I touched you!<eos> Happy Valentine's Day.<eos> Oh, my goodness, look at this room!<eos> Champagne!<eos> Roses!<eos> Oh!<eos> And little chocolates!<eos> This is going to be the best Valentine's Day ever.<eos> Yeah, I forgot about all this.<eos> But I never will.
You've got the same blood as me.<eos> The same talent flows in your veins.<eos> See you around.<eos> As she left, I heard the sound of something important to me disappearing.<eos> (Confession: Shuuya Watanabe)<eos> Pop...<eos> Everyone will die.<eos> Want a drink too?<eos> Including me.<eos> My entire world will... 31st August.
She said she's from the Phoenix office.<eos> Well, at least someone showed up.<eos> Worst actor ever?<eos> I know why you're doing this why?<eos> Because that woman called you a crockpot.<eos> Ah no. And I'm not, so.<eos> Yeah cause your life is boring So you're creating melodrama.<eos> No, I'm just trying to help that woman out.<eos> If the widow finds out...<eos> Which she won't.
Madison.<eos> And Lauren.<eos> Look, we have to tell you something.<eos> Are you still with Jimmy?<eos> No. Why?<eos> Ben went out with Grace Bowman tonight.<eos> Ben and Grace?<eos> So you might wanna stick with Jimmy.<eos> Oh, and tell him thank you for dinner.<eos> Okay, I will.
- You were nice about my tie. - Yes.<eos> And today is another cracker if I may say so.<eos> But I just wondered, between you and me, in 100 words, where do you think Van Gogh rates in the history of art?<eos> Well... big question.<eos> Certainly, the most popular, great painter of all time, the most beloved.<eos> His command of color the most magnificent.<eos> He transformed the pain of his tormented life into ecstatic beauty.<eos> Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world...<eos> No-one had ever done it before.<eos> Perhaps no-one ever will again.
Russell looked into the brother--Will Reynolds.<eos> Candace, the kid was reported missing on the same day Eric was assaulted. Really?<eos> So what does that mean?<eos> Well, it could mean a lot of things.<eos> But what if Eric had something to do with Will's disappearance and almost got killed for it?<eos> Okay. So what do I do?<eos> Just take him back to my place.<eos> I'll meet you there with Russell.<eos> And, Candace, be careful.<eos> All right, I will.
Well, then yeah, 'cause there's no place where I'm more at one with-<eos> Just get your coat.<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> Shut up, Alex.<eos> I was just asking.<eos> I'd be nervous if I were you.<eos> Alex, leave your sister alone.<eos> She's gonna be fine. As long as I don't get the same guy.<eos> He's so mean.<eos> You probably will.
Those six weeks are up, Dr. Cooper.<eos> - I...<eos> - please answer your pager.<eos> You heard that?<eos> It's on vibrate.<eos> Someone may be dying.<eos> - Oh, the nurses will keep them alive until I get there.<eos> It's their job. So, uh... what needs to happen in order to keep the campaign going?<eos> I mean, I'm... sorry. I'm totally willing to keep the, you know, campaign going.<eos> I'll... I'll...
You ever face disappointed Persian parents?<eos> My own mother said that I urinated on the legacy of my ancestors.<eos> Harsh.<eos> And very specific.<eos> Yeah, I'm just glad to be back, man.<eos> Especially since I can't destroy Jasper's life from home.<eos> Yeah, it might be time for you to let that go, buddy.<eos> What, are you kidding me?<eos> Well, the last plan didn't exactly go so well.<eos> Yeah, well, the next one will.
- Well, I'm going to write to Murray.<eos> - He won't say anything different.<eos> Well, we have to start somewhere.<eos> Our duty is to Mary.<eos> Well, give him a date for when Mary's out of mourning.<eos> No one wants to kiss a girl in black.<eos> Oh, do stop admiring yourself.<eos> He's not marrying you for your looks.<eos> That's if he wants to marry you at all.<eos> He will.
And how hot is Stephanie?<eos> Whoo!<eos> Well, Stephanie got a date to the dance.<eos> And I can't believe Kendall didn't ask me.<eos> Logan tried asking me, but he's really terrible at it.<eos> Is that Logan... On a horse?<eos> Hello, milady.<eos> Would you like to accompany me to... The dance?<eos> Say yes!<eos> Heck, yeah, I will.
You remember what you said to me our first night here?<eos> What if we ruin it?<eos> Every night I spent away from you, I dreamed about being back here in this room, in this bed with you.<eos> I dreamed about us, Brooke.<eos> And now we're here.<eos> We're back.<eos> And you look even more beautiful than in my dreams.<eos> I love you.<eos> I never stopped loving you, not for one night, not for one moment.<eos> And I never will.
It was the least I could do.<eos> I needed to let you know that I believe in you too.<eos> Hey, what happened, man?<eos> You were almost finished with this thing.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Is Mom still mad at me?<eos> It's not you, buddy.<eos> Your mother really loves you.<eos> She always will.
Amy, what's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Is it Ricky or Ben?<eos> Or the new one?<eos> He said it was my fault.<eos> I don't even know what happened.<eos> And he knows I like wings.<eos> I don't even like pizza that much.<eos> Oh, Amy, you will get through this.<eos> You will. No, I won't.
Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Don't you trust me?<eos> You have to sneak around behind my back?<eos> No.<eos> Wait, how did we switch roles here?<eos> I can't go back to him now.<eos> That would be extremely skeevy.<eos> We just had lunch.<eos> I swear I will never see him again, I promise.<eos> Yes, you will.
She's forbidden us to say anything to her son.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> She's gone home now, but she's still very ill.<eos> Clearly the boy should go and see her.<eos> And I assume you would have no objections? Of course not.<eos> So, do we break a patient's confidence and disobey her orders?<eos> We can't. Lfshe's forbidden it.<eos> - I must say I agree with you.<eos> - Well, I'll tell him.<eos> No, you will not.
- Friends?<eos> - Always friends.<eos> I think we should start the ices now.<eos> - If you agree, Mrs Patmore. - Certainly, Mrs Bird.<eos> Oh, my Lord, listen to that.<eos> It's like the cry of a banshee.<eos> Mr Carson's telephone is ringing.<eos> Isn't someone going to answer it?<eos> I wouldn't touch that thing with a ten-foot pole.<eos> Well, I will, then.
My first week in Tree Hill, I told Haley I was gonna close this place.<eos> Couldn't wait to get out of here.<eos> And now I'm gonna miss it.<eos> What, after last night you're still not ready to marry me?<eos> Last night was amazing.<eos> Every night has been.<eos> But, no, I still can't marry you.<eos> I need you to promise me something.<eos> Promise me that when I'm gone you'll still finish the record.<eos> I will.
Look.<eos> Treasure!<eos> Yes!<eos> You told me to never come back.<eos> I know I did.<eos> But I was wrong.<eos> I'm just gonna be here, okay?<eos> I'll jump.<eos> I mean it.<eos> No, you won't.
What?<eos> The fact that they're families makes it worse?<eos> A family is just a thing that you're part of, and then you're not.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want you to tell me what you see.<eos> I see a lady who won't take no for an answer.<eos> If you change your mind...<eos> I'm gonna give you my card and my home phone number.<eos> If you change your mind.<eos> I won't.
Ms. Jimenez, my name is Frank Sloan.<eos> The family of Lauren Kempton has some questions regarding the circumstances surrounding her death.<eos> Now, I know she had a terminal illness. But by all accounts, she was stable and had a few healthy years left.<eos> She was an elderly woman with ALS. It happens.<eos> Well, the family thinks it's odd, and the insurance company thinks it's odd.<eos> Don't you think it's odd?<eos> I don't know you.<eos> And I don't have to answer your questions.<eos> It would be better for you if you did.<eos> And sooner or later, Ms. Jimenez you will.
I wouldn't care.<eos> As a matter of fact, I'm gonna specify in my will That if I die during any major sporting event, No one has to come to my funeral.<eos> Oh, I have a better idea.<eos> Why don't we take you to the nearest stadium, And we'll shoot you out of the t-shirt cannon At halftime?<eos> Look, it doesn't matter if I want to or don't want to.<eos> This is obviously important to you, and I get that.<eos> I said I'm going, and I'm going,<eos> So just leave it alone!<eos> If you can't go to this funeral with a smile on your face, Then don't go.<eos> Fine. I won't.
Glad that's over.<eos> Wait. Wait, wait.<eos> I-I just...<eos> I wish I could handle this whole selection process some other way.<eos> You know.<eos> It's okay, Will.<eos> It's fine.<eos> My hope is that, uh... You know, when this whole thing is over, we can...<eos> Somehow, you know, find some way to - to keep our relationship.<eos> We will.
Yeah.<eos> What I did was not on a whim.<eos> Your brother does not work and play well with others.<eos> It's not Rick's fault.<eos> I had the key.<eos> - I dropped it.<eos> - You couldn't pick it up?<eos> Well, I dropped it in a drain.<eos> If it's supposed to make me feel better, it don't.<eos> Well, maybe this will.
You want to hold onto your teeth?<eos> Question is, do you trust that man's word?<eos> No, question is what are you willing to bet on it?<eos> Could be more than them guns.<eos> Could be your life.<eos> Glenn worth that to you?<eos> What life I have I owe to him.<eos> I was nobody to Glenn, just some idiot stuck in a tank.<eos> He could have walked away, but he didn't.<eos> Neither will I.
Maybe a scarf.<eos> Why don't you just confess to the truth?<eos> It's gonna come out sooner or later.<eos> He was already dead.<eos> With a wallet lying conveniently next to him?<eos> Look, if you're not going to admit to it, you might at least want to try coming up with a story that's a little more convincing.<eos> It's what happened!<eos> Like you weren't scared.<eos> I want this guy to fry, Beckett.<eos> - Ow. - Oh, he will.
[ Chuckling ] Oh, God.<eos> Come on, now, Tess.<eos> Don't underestimate yourself.<eos> Although, I do have to say, I thought the e-mail was a touch much.<eos> "Oliver...<eos> "I never thought I'd have to tell you how I feel about us, "because the smile on my lips when I looked at you...<eos> "Pretty much said it all.<eos> "But now that you won't be seeing it anymore, "I'll have to use words to tell you.<eos> "I've never loved anyone the way I've loved you.<eos> "And I never will again.
The thing I'd like to point out is that, given the evidence, eight years is reasonable.<eos> - I think you should consider it.<eos> - Lieutenant...<eos> A year ago, I came home to find my wife stabbed.<eos> The wife I love.<eos> I spent the last year trying to convince people that I didn't do it.<eos> And when I finally did, when I finally slept at home again, I...<eos> I will not take a plea of eight years.<eos> I did not do this.<eos> I will not.
I can't promise anything, but I can't locate it.<eos> We have to get his into evidence.<eos> What's up?<eos> They've been talking a lot.<eos> Something's brewing.<eos> You're being paranoid.<eos> Can you tell them I'm not like that?<eos> Tell the judge it's just an act.<eos> I'm not a bad girl.<eos> I will.
I'm going to get the next course.<eos> Luc, would you mind helping me in the kitchen?<eos> Of course.<eos> We'll be right back.<eos> I cannot believe you're pulling this off.<eos> You're such a good liar.<eos> She'd have made a great lawyer.<eos> Sarah, this is ridiculous.<eos> You have to tell him the truth about your age.<eos> I will, Mom.
- Let me finish, please.<eos> I know you don't want anyone to think that you're perfect.<eos> But to me, even with all of this stuff, you two are about as close to perfect as anything I've ever seen.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And I guess because I was raised at a time when a real relationship between two men, much less marriage, seemed impossible, you and Kevin were living my dream.<eos> And when I found out what happened, I just...<eos> Suddenly, everything seemed less possible again.<eos> Saul, everything is still possible.<eos> Don't let what I did make you give up hope.<eos> I won't if you won't.
I told Walt not to work for a slime bag like Dale.<eos> It was a matter of time before something like this.<eos> Dale?<eos> Dale Lawson...<eos> This guy my brother works for.<eos> He's dead.<eos> Walt's no angel, but he didn't deserve this.<eos> Cops better find out who did this.<eos> - Someone's got to bring them to justice.<eos> - Someone will.
Matt Reese.<eos> You come here to steal my info or take out the competition?<eos> No, no.<eos> I just thought we should talk.<eos> Is that why you knocked before you came in?<eos> Give you credit.<eos> Most people, they'd be a bloodstain on my carpet right now.<eos> You made a mistake coming in here.<eos> - You'll never find Bailey without my help.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> Stop.<eos> I just--I know.<eos> That's not gonna happen.<eos> I know.<eos> I just love you way too much.<eos> And I don't know what I would do.<eos> Okay. And then I think about Max and who's gonna take care of him when we're not around.<eos> Mom, I will.
Oh, no, that's totally fine.<eos> I mean, of course it is, 'cause it's okay with me.<eos> That's really cool!<eos> How did you hear about this underground Ben Harper concert?<eos> Yes, please, enlighten us.<eos> You know, I just, um, you hear things, you know.<eos> You meet people.<eos> So, uh, I guess I'm cooler than you think, huh?<eos> We will see.<eos> Oh, yeah, we will.
thanks, Elaine.<eos> okay, well, if you hear she can't have gone far.<eos> I know.<eos> But where is she?<eos> I-I-I've called all of her friends,<eos> Chase is checking everywhere in the neighborhood,<eos> The... the crawl space, the closets.<eos> Well, she can't get past the gate.<eos> Oh, God. I hope not.<eos> No, she won't.
Does that mean that she was strangled?<eos> Denied oxygen.<eos> Suffocated.<eos> She would have fought back, definitely.<eos> This was the hospital she was born in.<eos> Mum...<eos> I don't think I can do this, I don't want to do it.<eos> All right, love.<eos> Will you find who did this?<eos> Yes... ..we will.
Stewart... your client.<eos> - That's you. You're Stu.<eos> - Yes, it's me on the...<eos> - I know you.<eos> - I'm Stu.<eos> You know me.<eos> - You wet your bed.<eos> - I did. I do.<eos> - I don't anymore.<eos> - You will.
- Where's your father? Where is he?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - So we have to go back for him.<eos> - I'm not going back!<eos> I'm not going back!<eos> No, don't go there.<eos> - Wait here, I'll go in and look.<eos> - No! Please!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - I won't.
Yeah.<eos> He's gonna be all over the news.<eos> Once we unravel his need for darkness, we'll find him.<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.<eos> He can't hurt you again, OK?<eos> How do you know?<eos> You didn't find him.<eos> You're right.<eos> But I will.
To tell you the truth, I think I'm... I think I'm losing it.<eos> Have you spoken to your father?<eos> Every time I try to say something, he tells me everything's great, - and I should just be happy. - Ah...<eos> - The sage advice of great men.<eos> - But I can see it in his eyes.<eos> Oh, I am scared.<eos> Well, you know, I'm not a great man, Matthew, but I can tell you that fear... Well, it's just one of those things in this world, that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that you're truly alive.<eos> And I can tell you that you're alive until you're dead.<eos> You are going to die, Matthew.<eos> We all will, eventually.
We'll just leave it at that.<eos> You think you'll be rewarded with money?<eos> That you will sell back to me what is mine?<eos> No, no, I don't want money.<eos> I don't want anything, nothing.<eos> Except, uh, can I get his cell phone?<eos> You want a phone?<eos> Well, his phone actually.<eos> He doesn't need it anymore.<eos> He most certainly will not.
... but you need - to understand...<eos> - You did me a solid by not telling Gretchen what I did.<eos> I'm giving you this as a courtesy.<eos> She doesn't love you anymore.<eos> Do you get that?<eos> She cares about you... She... feel sorry for you.<eos> Okay?<eos> She loves me.<eos> She doesn't even know you.<eos> But she damn well will before the wedding.
Okay, let's talk about the fence, June Rorchek.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Your buddy Liam looks good for it.<eos> You know where he is?<eos> Young lady, this is now a murder investigation, and you are an accomplice.<eos> Just how much jail time do you want to do?<eos> Because every minute of silence piles on the time!<eos> I want you to think about that.<eos> She'll talk.<eos> No, dad, she won't.
- She was fine a half an hour ago.<eos> I mean, totally comped, a dream on the stand.<eos> - Well, apparently alienating the only person That ever mattered to her was more than she could take.<eos> - How do you think she'll take it When I charge her with accessory?<eos> - She doesn't respond well to threats.<eos> She responds to fairness and honesty.<eos> She needs to be convinced that taking the stand Equals doing what's right.<eos> - I thought she understood that.<eos> - She does.<eos> She will.
And on top of that, she's going through a divorce.<eos> And she was held hostage at gunpoint.<eos> I was getting to that.<eos> Okay. She's going to Brown in a couple of years.<eos> I just... I just want to enjoy the time we have left.<eos> - That's all.<eos> - Yeah, well, you're probably gonna have more than a couple of years.<eos> Chances are, she's not going to Brown.<eos> I mean, not if some of her old classmates might be there.<eos> Which they definitely will.
It's the Nabokoff School Of Music.<eos> No kidding.<eos> That's pretty impressive.<eos> I guess I could keep John, but I just pushed Ben to go back with you, so you probably shouldn't just take off.<eos> You pushed Ben?<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, I mean, he was hesitating for whatever reason, and I encouraged him to go back with you, and if it doesn't work out, feel free to blame it on me.<eos> This time it'll work out.<eos> Well, if it doesn't.<eos> It will.
I hope so.<eos> It's time for me to get a job.<eos> In this economy?<eos> [chuckles] I'm just kidding.<eos> I was just repeating your little joke that you made to Jeff.<eos> Jeff told me.<eos> Actually, I thought it was kind of funny, but I'm sure it was much funnier when you said it.<eos> Okay, you know, I think it's great.<eos> You should get a job.<eos> I will.
Is that 'cause you love her?<eos> Yeah, that's a yes.<eos> I see remorse.<eos> Am I reading that right?<eos> We'd been fighting.<eos> He was working long hours, and... I wanted him home. Where he'd be safe.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Do you care about any of that anymore?<eos> No. He loves you very much, you and Sophie.<eos> He always will.
Otherwise, you're gonna join Brennen in the afterlife.<eos> Believe that, Larry.<eos> I wish I could say it's been fun, Larry.<eos> No.<eos> You move, I shoot you right in the head.<eos> Come on, Larry.<eos> You and I both know you're not gonna shoot me.<eos> Try me.<eos> You won't reach the door.<eos> Yes, I will.
Quickly.<eos> Wait. Mr Dread's friends are still here.<eos> Yeah but Androvax is after the vault, we don't know where it is.<eos> This place is huge.<eos> We should split up to find Gita.<eos> Ah, we have to find her!<eos> If you find your mum, don't go near her.<eos> Even if she says it's her, you can't trust her, you call me.<eos> I know.<eos> I will.
"Wife No. 19."<eos> My mother was number 19.<eos> "A complete expose of Mormonism<eos> "revealing the sufferings of women in polygamy.<eos> "By Ann Eliza Young, 1875."<eos> Even I know who that is.<eos> Does Hiram know you have this?<eos> Has it helped?<eos> - You haven't read it.<eos> - I... I will.
It's not my world, Jordan.<eos> It's just new.<eos> No, it's too late.<eos> You're afraid.<eos> I already told you.<eos> I believe.<eos> It doesn't matter that men are weak.<eos> It doesn't matter that the Prophet isn't perfect.<eos> I believe.<eos> And I always will.
It would make me sad,<eos> I do have my ethics, but hey, James Frey still has a book deal.<eos> And I want mine. What if there isn't anything to tell?<eos> Drugs, tunnels, murder...<eos> I know my fucking story.<eos> Who else knows we're here?<eos> My editor knows I found you, but I didn't tell him where.<eos> But if I was able to find you, how long before the bad guys find you?<eos> And I don't mean the FBI.<eos> Because they will. Soon.
Very firm.<eos> Answer the question.<eos> Tell me, Jane...<eos> What would you like to do to me?<eos> I'd like to get my gun And put it in your mouth and pull the trigger.<eos> It is so much better slowly, to take your time.<eos> You know, all my life,<eos> I've been meticulous about finishing what I start.<eos> And that bothers me, because I haven't finished what I started with you.<eos> And you won't, you sick scumbag.
Have you been here all day?<eos> Whoa, good.<eos> Uh, what's my ringtone?<eos> Nice and upbeat.<eos> You should talk to your mom.<eos> She's still mad at me that I won't come home and sleep in my pink canopy bed.<eos> Mm. I always wanted a pink canopy.<eos> I wanted a horse.<eos> Please don't tell me that you always wanted to dissect dead people.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Do you know what you live for?<eos> I don't know either.<eos> I've read a book recently.<eos> About Pugachev.<eos> You know him?<eos> What a man!<eos> He made crazy things to hunt away his boredom, and now kids at school study what he did.<eos> I want kids to study my deeds too.<eos> - Come to my trial.<eos> - I will.
You!<eos> Tomba!<eos> Look at me; it's Henry, your friend, your brother.<eos> He's lying Tomba.<eos> You don't even have a brother.<eos> What kind of a jackal would turn his son against his own father?<eos> The kind who is paid in diamonds - although one less thanks to you.<eos> You dropped that crate on us.<eos> It's too bad you didn't get the message.<eos> But Tomba and his father will...very soon.
I mean, who's gonna love somebody who...<eos> Who what, Molly?<eos> Just somebody like me.<eos> Someone like you?<eos> You mean an ex-actress?<eos> Ex-porn slut.<eos> Just say it in plain English.<eos> No one has to know about what you were doing before.<eos> I mean, past is past, and I won't tell anyone.<eos> Will you?
Let's just speed this up.<eos> Okay, keep it moving. I wanna do all six hours today.<eos> Look, I can't count the hour if you don't talk.<eos> No.<eos> I know my rights, all I had to do is sit here for six hours.<eos> Do my time. Michael, it's up to me to check off the boxes, and I can't do that unless I honestly...<eos> Do you know how... Do you have any idea how angry that is making me?<eos> Tell me.<eos> I think we might be about to maybe really get somewhere.<eos> Yes, I will.
Our dance contest is going to be televised on channel 8.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - What if I trip?<eos> I'll end up the laughing stock of the greater Toledo area.<eos> I'll end up a viral video.<eos> Schoolchildren in Madrid will mock laughs me.<eos> The balerina so ridiculous.<eos> We're gonne be fine.<eos> I need to look great!<eos> And you will...
My shoes are awesome.<eos> So, the police won't know anything about Shane?<eos> You are a devoted mother, aren't you?<eos> You'll say nice things about me to Stevie?<eos> I'll tell him his mother loved him very much. She was willing to sacrifice everything for him.<eos> Even her life.<eos> How about a farewell fuck?<eos> That's crass.<eos> And it won't save you.<eos> - What will? - Nothing.
He had told me that she had hurt herself, and I worried.<eos> I needed to be near her somehow.<eos> For a minute there, it made me feel better.<eos> I know I've made some mistakes, but you've got to let me go find her.<eos> We can't.<eos> In order to keep you safe, we need to keep you here.<eos> She's right.<eos> All right?<eos> You find her... before he does.<eos> We will.
We didn't want to end up like them<eos> -That was one year ago, Birgitte<eos> -Phillip, we need to give it time No.<eos> Please listen to what I have to say<eos> The best thing that's ever happened to me is what you and I had<eos> You and me<eos> But in that interview yesterday we turned all that into a travesty<eos> And we aced it I mean, we...<eos> We sat there betraying it with big smiles on our faces<eos> But I won't, Birgitte.
But what if there is no oil?<eos> If you had given us 24 hours I couId at least have shown you some of what it is all about<eos> Show me what?<eos> You could have met an ordinary citizen but that does not interest you<eos> Kasper and Sanne, come in a moment, will you?<eos> Delay the press conference Move all my appointments.<eos> We're staying till tomorrow<eos> Thank you<eos> -Carsten Ockels hasn't arrived<eos> -He will
I can hardly use it to arrest an innocent man.<eos> It's a serious matter not to act.<eos> - Let's say we're looking into it.<eos> How long is Bayanov staying?<eos> - We need to make him leave.<eos> That would solve our problem.<eos> - But how?<eos> We'll leak Grozin's request for his arrest and hope he skips town.<eos> What if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
Everything's going to be okay here.<eos> You know, you remind me of my nephew.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, he's full of crap too.<eos> What the hell are they teaching you at Quantico these days?<eos> Your guys shot one of the hostages.<eos> That was an accident.<eos> Your people had your gun pointed at a civilian who was clearly in distress.<eos> How did I know you weren't going to shoot?<eos> Any more tricks like that, and we will.
Two DUls in three years.<eos> I guess I messed up.<eos> If she's not a victim, then who is she?<eos> No worries.<eos> When you mess up, it makes me feel better about me. - Dexter?<eos> - No, it's Jordan Chase.<eos> But I'm looking for Dexter. Is he there?<eos> He... He's not available right now.<eos> Can I leave a message? Uh-huh. Tell him I'm just checking in, and I'd like him to schedule another appointment as soon as possible.<eos> I will. Bye.
I almost lost everything today.<eos> Sugar dust... it's all over the refinery.<eos> Don't bother, lieutenant.<eos> There is no way that that was a dust explosion.<eos> That's not what the evidence says.<eos> So you found sugar dust.<eos> Good for you.<eos> Did you find excessive concentrations?<eos> No.<eos> But we will.
If we can't sweep this thing under the rug, we can certainly cut her a deal.<eos> Make sure she isn't tried as an adult.<eos> Thank you, Chester. You're always there for me.<eos> Yeah, well, I gotta get home.<eos> My fuckin' nuts are killing me.<eos> I know what you mean, brother.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I don't. What are you talking about?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I'll, um...
- Doubt, yes.<eos> I don't know how reasonable that was.<eos> Look, the cops figure it was a robbery, fine.<eos> The bartender says it was a gambling debt, fine.<eos> They still gotta prove what Jim knew sitting out there in the car, and they can't. They didn't.<eos> Ah, that kid must've said a hundred times how he didn't know they were going after a gambling debt.<eos> - Yeah. So?<eos> - Well, do you believe him?<eos> Okay, there you go.<eos> Neither will the jury.
He's in your phone?<eos> Yeah, anyone who's anyone is in my phone.<eos> I'm not in her phone.<eos> 130 North Moore, Tribeca.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Let's flag this guy.<eos> His credit cards, phone and license.<eos> He could be a flight risk.<eos> Oh, and if you happen to think of anything else, don't hesitate to call.<eos> I won't, Danny. Oh, and, um...
Let me take point on this.<eos> If vivian is ripping off people's medicine cabinets, We have no idea where her head is.<eos> I just don't want her to do anything stupid.<eos> You got it.<eos> I'll follow, you lead. Come on.<eos> You're not going anywhere.<eos> I'm not?<eos> You have custody of our suspect's son.<eos> And you think that's a conflict of interest.<eos> Her attorney will.
All right.<eos> You'll stay here with Gaius.<eos> I want you to gather firewood and make bandages.<eos> There will be casualties.<eos> All right.<eos> Guinevere...<eos> They'll see.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I want you to know... ..if I never see you again...<eos> You will.
Father, we have to hurry. SHOUTING<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Please, Father, now isn't the time.<eos> BELLS RING OUT What the hell are those two doing?<eos> If we're to go down, we'll go down fighting.<eos> For the love of Camelot!<eos> HE GASPS<eos> I have a feeling I won't be seeing you again.<eos> No.<eos> You won't.
Goodbye.<eos> Is the place he went to very far?<eos> Will it take long?<eos> Did he go on holiday?<eos> I can't tell you anything.<eos> Then please help me convey this to him.<eos> Please tell him that Ma Hye Ri is looking for him, if he calls.<eos> You must help me convey this. Although I do not have any relationship with him, but you only have to tell him Ma Hye Ri.<eos> He'll know.<eos> Lawyer Seo will.
The cow will sweat when pulling a large load on its wagon, and<eos> 'Choong' is 'full', 'Dong' is 'a beam'.<eos> If you stack a load, it will reach the beam.<eos> Therefore, it's saying that you'll have that much more responsibility in life.<eos> Are you dumb?<eos> Baek Eun Jo!<eos> Where are your manners?<eos> Hurry and apologize to your nuna.<eos> I don't want to!<eos> I won't!
Do you want this to be a goodbye show?<eos> Hey!<eos> Are you looking down on me right now because your OST has been doing well lately?<eos> You looked down on people even when you weren't doing well.<eos> That's why I'm better.<eos> I'm consistent.<eos> I don't pretend to be humble because I'm famous.<eos> I must have betrayed the country in my past life, seeing as how I'm doing this with you.<eos> Hurry up and practice.<eos> I will!
I'll rescue Banjjak whatever it takes.<eos> Listen, Jjakgwi Eonni.<eos> Let's get rid of that "Listen," shall we?<eos> We will remain here a few days, so give us lodgings and some food.<eos> Eonni!<eos> Tell Daegil to hurry here.<eos> So I can get rid of him once and for all.<eos> He will soon come looking for us here.<eos> Indeed, indeed...<eos> Indeed he will.
- Oh, shit.<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> ...converting Africans to Judaism. This is station six... Stuff like that.<eos> Let's get ready to move.<eos> There's three to my right.<eos> There's two behind me and one at the northeast exit.<eos> There is a God. - You speak Swahili?<eos> - You don't?<eos> You got enough to work with, kid?<eos> We will.
Oh, Beatrice, I buried this baby a Iong time ago... and I figured I'd find it again someday when I was ready.<eos> I still wish that I could go back and fix... all the stupid things I did when we were younger.<eos> I guess this is as close as I can get.<eos> You kept all this stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's my gum ball ring.<eos> Bea, I don't want to go anyplace else without you.<eos> I Iove you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> You will?
Um, we're gonna try and work through it.<eos> Good.<eos> You know, I might hide it pretty well, but, I mean, I get that depression stuff, too, sometimes.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Don't kill yourself, okay?<eos> I won't.<eos> Seriously.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll call you tomorrow, all right?<eos> Yeah, you will.
Oh! Don't say it.<eos> No.<eos> Here. I know what you're gonna say.<eos> Now here, let me do this.<eos> You're gonna get filthy.<eos> I'll fill it in. Get the next train.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> And you, you stay.<eos> He will.
I'm not asking your permission here.<eos> I think I'm having a heart attack.<eos> - Easy. Easy. - Somebody get a doctor!<eos> You two need to stop fighting.<eos> You'll never see eye to eye.<eos> But you're family.<eos> Promise me you'll stand by Andrew. Even if... if you don't agree with him.<eos> I promise.<eos> Andrew. Promise me you'll work harder to be a part of this family.<eos> I will.
It means I don't wanna live with you.<eos> Oh, so this is all my fault.<eos> - What's all your fault?<eos> - What you did to me!<eos> I didn't do anything to you.<eos> I'm done.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> You're not even gonna come home for Christmas any more?<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I... Of course I will, Mom.
And it means something to be first.<eos> To be most.<eos> It means a great deal.<eos> It means you have an opportunity to reproduce with the highest frequency and with the most desirable partners.<eos> It means your offspring have the greatest chance of survival and a better opportunity to make their own fire.<eos> I personally believe that human evolution has run its course.<eos> We live in a world where the people who can make fire have a tendency to wear condoms, sit in casinos and drink themselves into a stupor.<eos> I believe that individual evolution has been replaced by something else.<eos> By a shared evolution.<eos> A communal contest, if you will.
I mean, the allure of an older woman is undeniable.<eos> In junior high school, I was always more attracted to my older sister's friends.<eos> It has nothing to do with Jill's age. Her energy is incredibly attractive.<eos> She lives in the moment. I understand.<eos> We just don't want to see you get hurt.<eos> Thank you, but I can handle it.<eos> Well, anyway, you'll be going off to college soon.<eos> The most important thing is that you're honest with her, that you treat her with respect.<eos> Thanks, Phil.<eos> I will.
Fucking ghost, yeah.<eos> Sandy's a ghost.<eos> - You go that way. We'll get her.<eos> You're the only one left.<eos> You won.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Do you remember me?<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> Hey, be careful.<eos> You will.
Why my name?<eos> - It's a very pretty name.<eos> - I don't know.<eos> What does grandma say?<eos> What if she doesn't give you the house to do what you want with?<eos> What? Doesn't she want to live better, too?<eos> I don't think she'll agree to all this stuff with her house.<eos> She's old and set in her ways.<eos> - She won't agree to it.<eos> - She will.
It took until I was 13.<eos> When stopped it.<eos> When I started to believe them.<eos> Maybe it never happened.<eos> Maybe I have this gift never had.<eos> But when I found you.<eos> And it started again.<eos> And it's more intense than ever.<eos> And I never want to lose.<eos> I will not.
You know, the terrorist who's intercepting the radio<eos> Why is he called Doctor? Is he a doctor?<eos> He dropped out of medical college after 3 years.<eos> Then he disappeared in the mountains. Nickname stayed.<eos> Why did he drop out? Afraid of dead bodies?<eos> Is this guy nuts?<eos> He should work in a hospital and earn lots of money.<eos> What's he looking for in the mountains?<eos> Commander says, they'll definitely attack.<eos> Then they will.
They just don't.<eos> Look who's talking. That's different.<eos> People make mistakes.<eos> It happens.<eos> I mean, hey, they live all the way out here in the country.<eos> So they're at least normal enough to have real jobs that pay tons of money.<eos> You think having lots of money makes you normal?<eos> You've clearly never met my family.<eos> Well, we'll see.<eos> Yes, we will.
She never got to see the piece or the attention it got.<eos> So they brought me out here.<eos> It's not much bigger, but at least I got my own investigative unit.<eos> And now that's gone.<eos> CJ, you really are a good reporter.<eos> Hey, no no.<eos> You said you had an idea.<eos> Well, go, follow it.<eos> Look, I told you this is not a good time.<eos> All right, I will.
I'm leaving, I said.<eos> Where to?<eos> I'm leaving Alain.<eos> Does he know?<eos> I'll tell him tonight.<eos> I'm sick of his phony cheer, when he's so low.<eos> I've had it with cancer, Yom Kippurs, bar mitzvahs, his parents who make me feel oh so goy, and that damp beach house in Arcachon!<eos> Who is he?<eos> You don't know him.<eos> In time, I obviously will.
But that he didn't have the guts to open his mouth. And he couldn't get anybody to talk for him.<eos> At first, he wanted anybody with a story about him to come.<eos> But he didn't wanna hear their bullshit stories.<eos> Pardon my language.<eos> He wants to tell one.<eos> About time.<eos> Whatever he did has been locked up in him for 40 years.<eos> He can't get it out.<eos> I think he told you, and he wants you to tell it for him.<eos> Because he won't.

No!<eos> Stop!<eos> I do not know any of you people.<eos> I want to speak with Major Mason.<eos> I only trust Major Mason.<eos> Is everything all right?<eos> Take me back to my country.<eos> Princess, I'm sorry, but General Kane has taken control of your country and assumed command of its government.<eos> - But I must go back.<eos> - And you will.
Doll freaking house.<eos> I'll keep saying it, it's fun to say.<eos> Dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse, dollhouse.<eos> You see the Borodins, you say it some more.<eos> You think you want to mess with the Borodins?<eos> No, but they supply girls, some of them very high-end, to fine, upstanding clients.<eos> There's one client I'm interested in.<eos> Find out who's connected to the Dollhouse, the Borodins won't be touched and you'll never see me again.<eos> I haven't seen you yet.<eos> You will.
The Mother Confessor, Kahlan Amnell, you know where she is?<eos> Queen Kahlan?<eos> Queen?<eos> And the Master's mother.<eos> She died many years ago.<eos> You're back, Seeker.<eos> You can kill the Master.<eos> You can free the Confessed.<eos> Please, will you help us?<eos> I will.
- I saved your life.<eos> - Is that right, Jay?<eos> I was there for you, like I've always been.<eos> Like I'll always be.<eos> Come with me, both of you.<eos> You think the first time was good?<eos> Second time's even better.<eos> All the know-how, none of the aches and pain.<eos> No. I won't do this.<eos> I won't.
Why?<eos> Look, I'm telling you-<eos> Because it's not something you're doing, it's what you are!<eos> It means-<eos> What?<eos> Say it.<eos> It means you're a monster.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You never did.<eos> And you never will.
Look, I would've called you earlier, but I kept hoping we'd be done.<eos> We're probably gonna be here all night.<eos> You're upset.<eos> I can tell you're upset.<eos> Just remember this the next time you're mad at me 'cause I have to put my work first.<eos> I will.<eos> I will. Honey, I am so sorry.<eos> You didn't plan it this way, I know.<eos> Just make it to our little ceremony tomorrow, and I'll be fine.<eos> I will.
What did you see and what do you know?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Really.<eos> Harley!<eos> Okay, he checked in, then you arrived.<eos> Then you met at the elevator, possible kiss there.<eos> Then the doctor went up and the doctor came down. Then there was a thumbs-up, but that's it.<eos> I have no idea what happened in between.<eos> Have you told Lauren?<eos> No, and I won't.
Park here for a lifetime or so.<eos> Or... you can go and do something totally fucking amazing.<eos> What about you?<eos> I got my own plans.<eos> We're so perfect.<eos> Immaculate.<eos> Why did you show me this?<eos> Do you want to know what happens when you die?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
Upwind.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the thing.<eos> I can't pay you today.<eos> But I can pay you this week, all right?<eos> Seventeen fifty?<eos> We'll make it 1750, for, like, you know, interest.<eos> - I thought your word was your bond. - Lt totally is.<eos> Definitely. I just don't have the money at this particular moment.<eos> But I will, soon.
No, it's... more like we're from the same village.<eos> Is everybody in a small town related ?<eos> In some parts of the country.<eos> Look, I can't help it if I think Kyle and I are soul mates.<eos> - I just do.<eos> - Soul mates ?<eos> Does Kyle know about any of this ?<eos> He's never said anything.<eos> But I think he feels the same way.<eos> Or he will eventually.
Is there a romantic interest I'm not aware of?<eos> Only Kyle.<eos> - Kyle?<eos> - If you really sense that special bond between you and Kyle, -you should act on it.<eos> -How did you know his name?<eos> I never mentioned it.<eos> There's a lot of things I know about you, Jessi. A lot more than you think.<eos> I think it's time I explained.<eos> As long as you don't rat me out to mom and dad.<eos> I won't. - Fine.
- Exhausted.<eos> Drained.<eos> But a little bit free.<eos> Good.<eos> You didn't tell Nicole.<eos> I don't think anyone should know about this yet.<eos> - I know it's not over.<eos> - No.<eos> We need to find out why he did it.<eos> We will.
So... who are you jealous of?<eos> Angela.<eos> Hodgins.<eos> Cam.<eos> You.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you all want to lose yourself in another person.<eos> You believe that love is transcendent and eternal.<eos> I want to believe that, too.<eos> Hey, you will.
Cam.<eos> You.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you all want to lose yourself in another person.<eos> You believe that love is transcendent and eternal.<eos> I want to believe that, too.<eos> Hey, you will.<eos> I promise.<eos> Someday you will.<eos> You will someday, okay?

DWIGHT,ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT US?<eos> IT IS POSSIBLE THAT I COULD BE TALKING ABOUT US.<eos> SOMEONE COULD SAY IT IS LIKE THE SITUATION THAT WE ARE IN NOW?<eos> ITISTHE SITUATION WE ARE IN NOW.<eos> SO,I WOULD SAY THAT THE OLD BOSS HAS ALWAYS BEEN GOOD TO DWIGHT, AND HE WAS THERE FIRST,<eos> SO HE HAS DIBS. YOU RESPECT DIBS,DON'T YOU?<eos> I'M NOT A BARBARIAN.<eos> GOOD.<eos> WILL YOU ET ME IN 20 MINUTES AT THE SPOT?<eos> I WILL.
vin, don't say a word.<eos> Are you talking to my client without his lawyer being present?<eos> Now you know better than that.<eos> If Mr. Sheridan is in fact your client, then we have a conflict of interest, don't we?<eos> I know the law, Lieutenant.<eos> Mr. Reyes has been notified.<eos> And that's my only legal obligation.<eos> Yes, and we both know Mr. Reyes is innocent, don't we?<eos> Do you have evidence to prove that Mr. Sheridan had any involvement?<eos> I will.
Want your mom To take you?<eos> Come on, andrea.<eos> I'll be home Before dinner. Yeah, right.<eos> You said that last time.<eos> [sighs] I was gonna Tell you this later, But, uh, I really need To see you smile,<eos> So when you've Gotten your license, This little beauty Is all yours.<eos> Dad! Huh?<eos> How do you like Your old man now, huh?<eos> But you can't let Your grades slip. No, they won't.<eos> They won't. All right.
And that much we can prove.<eos> That's a serious felony.<eos> Talking to you doesn't get me anything.<eos> Okay, if you've got nothing to say to us, we'll just put you back out on the street, make sure everybody knows you were in here.<eos> You can go hang out with your buddy Robert Logan.<eos> Oh, actually, you can't.<eos> He's dead.<eos> What the hell are you thinking?<eos> I don't want to end up like Logan.<eos> You won't.
Let go.<eos> Got a cigarette?<eos> You can't smoke.<eos> You can?<eos> What grade are you in?<eos> I flunked out.<eos> Why?<eos> What a fucking question!<eos> I'm talking because I want a cigarette, give me one and I'll leave.<eos> I won't.
- Well, I do.<eos> - I do too.<eos> - You know, I haven't checked out yet.<eos> - Really?<eos> And I have the whole day off.<eos> The whole day?<eos> I think we should go.<eos> Now, I know that you're angry, but there are some things that are difficult for me to compromise on.<eos> - So I don't even get a say?<eos> - No, sometimes you will.
But I think I know what he wanted to tell me.<eos> Based upon the big bonus he fought for Carlos to have, it's fairly obvious he was going to recommend a promotion.<eos> That was my guess, too.<eos> The terrible irony is, he didn't realize the job he was recommending would turn out to be his own.<eos> Wait.<eos> So, you're offering me Bradley's job as president of the company?<eos> I can't think of anyone better suited.<eos> Now, of course, it would be the same compensation package.<eos> - Please, tell me you'll accept.<eos> - He sure will.
So, that's your defense? You thought your back-stabbing was unsuccessful?<eos> Well, I'll admit it's kind of flimsy, but until I've got something better...<eos> Next time you have an issue with me, you know where my office is.<eos> Oh, and as far as Friday nights are concerned?<eos> Don't worry, if you're as bad at coaching as you are at office politics, your daughter won't be missing much.<eos> Found the contract. Everything is in order.<eos> All we need now is your signature.<eos> Mr. Dinsmore, would you mind if I speak to my husband for a moment?<eos> Oh, yeah, please go ahead.<eos> I'll...
I can't say yes.<eos> I love you, and you can do this.<eos> You can do this.<eos> I know you can.<eos> Iz!<eos> See you soon, Dr. Stevens.<eos> - Hope so.<eos> - Know so.<eos> - Dr. Bailey, if something goes wrong...<eos> - It won't.
look, you don't want to take papi to the city?<eos> fine.<eos> i'll do it.<eos> i'll take over.<eos> you'll what?<eos> i'll take over with papi.<eos> you don't wanna help?<eos> i'll just find a way to do it all by myself.<eos> oh, i would like to see you try.<eos> i will.
That sounds great,but I ac-- oh,great.<eos> well,they're good.<eos> hey,mom.<eos> Uh,you know,I'd really love to do that, but molly has a surprise special date planned.<eos> Oh. Well,that's fine then.<eos> But,um,you know,we should do something fun together.<eos> Maybe just later in the week.<eos> That would be nice.<eos> We better make sure this party is good.<eos> Oh,we will.
I really wanted you to put them in the fancy plastic--<eos> Plastic covers?<eos> Relax, daniel.<eos> You're gonna be great.<eos> You've got a wonderful presentation, Amazing visuals and an omelet bar.<eos> Betty, come on.<eos> the man made me dress up in a bunny costume.<eos> I have to prove to him that i deserve respect.<eos> Besides, nothing's official until he signs on the dotted line.<eos> Lower that, will ya?
It's not too late to start.<eos> You want something else for your article?<eos> Let me just get my recorder.<eos> Come here.<eos> I'm opening... for Tommy in Phoenix tomorrow.<eos> Bad Blake's hit the big time.<eos> That's great, right?<eos> That's what my agent says.<eos> You gonna come with me?<eos> - Will you?
I went here and there, good.<eos> Impossible!<eos> This way, there is water.<eos> "That is the problem of the islands.<eos> "That's what I was told.<eos> How do you find my home?<eos> You-you would be killed if the Governor had not given?<eos> Since small-, I dream of dying a martyr.<eos> -I believe that death does not you, will you do about it.<eos> One day you will a little old,
Have you told the children the good news?<eos> What?<eos> Do you think they'll want a little brother or a sister?<eos> You've been spying on us?<eos> I've been looking for an opportunity to get what I deserve - lands of my own.<eos> You will give me yours, lady, unless you want everyone to know your little secret. Very well.<eos> Go to Nottingham, have the deeds drawn up.<eos> Thank you, my lord.<eos> Malcolm, the lands have to pass to Guy.<eos> And they will.
Caught in the web of the combine.<eos> That's a reference to One Fl...<eos> Yeah, One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest.<eos> I know.<eos> And I also know that you didn't mean to kill Jonathan Danson.<eos> I know that.<eos> It happened.<eos> But this is your one chance to get out in front of it, so tell me what happened.<eos> Just tell me the truth, and I promise I'll do everything I can to help you.<eos> I will.
-That I am.<eos> Y eah.<eos> We' re here to talk about Joey Conway.<eos> TONY: I still can't believe he's gone.<eos> Joey built this city, one word at a time.<eos> You're T ony Crane.<eos> I assume at some point there will be a little more to your line of questioning than this.<eos> T ony Crane.<eos> I'm sorry, do we know each other?<eos> We will.
Then who can?<eos> Richard?<eos> Hey, John.<eos> Richard, what is happening?<eos> What's happening is you're bleeding to death.<eos> I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> - Because you told me there was.<eos> - No, I didn't.<eos> Well... you will.
- Shut down!<eos> - No way. - You are so shut down.<eos> - I am not.<eos> If you're not shut down, then answer.<eos> If anyone's shut down, it's you.<eos> You're the one shut down, Crunchy.<eos> I could say you're always broke. At the store, we always have to lend you money.<eos> You don't even have ten cents for a can of pop.<eos> I'll pay you back.<eos> No you won't.
Not now!<eos> At the airport.<eos> 20h, March24,1999,NATObombed SerbiaandKosovo.<eos> We change the creamery!<eos> The world is temporarily on our side.<eos> I stop the killings, I promise.<eos> The eggs are too well protected today.<eos> Impossible to achieve your old friend Stojkovic.<eos> You want to be avenged, no?<eos> Yes, you will.
You need a solid alibi hiding in plain sight. Meanwhile, when you're in the theatre, start texting your friends.<eos> You start texting your friends. Get them to text their friends.<eos> Send out the word that there's something happening at school.<eos> - I don't know. Texting in the theatre?<eos> - That's just not cool. Why can't I really help?<eos> I'm already in so much trouble with dad.<eos> What's the worst that can happen now?<eos> - I heard the word "jail" again.<eos> Um, why don't I just take Sarah to the movies?<eos> - No. No, you will not.
I love you.<eos> I have done for years.<eos> When you knew I loved another?<eos> Why?<eos> Because in time I knew you would be wise enough to let him go.<eos> And now I have.<eos> Only to run from me.<eos> El, do not run.<eos> Come with me.<eos> I will.
And business?<eos> It's growing.<eos> Glad to hear it.<eos> Did you get my proposal on the Oswald property?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> It's an ambitious development.<eos> And a lucrative one.<eos> When this land becomes available, I will need capital investors.<eos> - If this land becomes available.<eos> - It will.
I am.<eos> Are you?<eos> Is he really that good an actor?<eos> Dr. Gallagher, please come...<eos> - Are you his friend?<eos> Are you his family? - Please, Dr. Gallagher!<eos> Or was that just another helping of Hollywood rubbish?<eos> Help him.<eos> Please help him.<eos> I will.
Punishable.<eos> It's how we administer justice.<eos> In your world.<eos> Speaking of which, you were brilliant.<eos> that you could know this, Doctor... but... the trial's already over.<eos> - And that's justice?<eos> - That's reality.<eos> See, I have a sympathetic victim, a nervous defendant, strong evidence.<eos> And you never lose.<eos> Some day I will.
Because if you don't everything we're about to do won't matter at all.<eos> You got it, you got it, you got it, you got it!<eos> - Why did you do that?<eos> - You're supposed to fan it.<eos> - You said you knew how to start a fire.<eos> - You said you didn't care.<eos> - I care about surviving.<eos> - You need to take a timeout, Neil.<eos> You'll get it, Bernard.<eos> You will.
Stay on track, guys!<eos> Bye.<eos> Are you off, baby?<eos> I'm studying at Quentin's. I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> Is that him?<eos> Why not my place?<eos> It's too small.<eos> We'll disturb you if you want to watch TV.<eos> No, you won't.
- Yeah.<eos> I don't know exactly where, but she shouldn't be that hard to find.<eos> Her name is Eloise Hawking.<eos> - Eloise Hawking?<eos> You sure?<eos> - Yeah. Why, do you know her?<eos> Yes, John.<eos> I know her.<eos> I'll miss you, John.<eos> I really will.
See, I had no idea my job was so darn important.<eos> Oh. Here comes my boss.<eos> That little dog is your boss?<eos> Eddy, this is Clark.<eos> - He's an official elf representative. - Hey.<eos> Eli, we'd better get back to the North Pole, lickety-split.<eos> Santa's gonna need all the help he can get.<eos> - He can talk? - Uh-huh.<eos> We don't have enough magic to power the truck.<eos> We will soon.
No, I wouldn't. Not a corn farthing would I bet.<eos> No sir. - What's wrong with you?<eos> - Little wrong in the head, I am, from eatin' some bad sausages. Yes, bad sausages that I eat, indeed, sir.<eos> Yes, I did some bad sausages ate I.<eos> Oh, Griffin, this time together has been the happiest of my life.<eos> Me too, Lady Redbush.<eos> All those months I was without you, I never stopped seeing' your face in the back of my wife's head.<eos> And all those months I was sailin' for the new world I saw your face in every slave's stomach.<eos> Tell me we'll be together forever.<eos> We will.
No lean sacrifice, but fair.<eos> In order to safeguard that pledge, I know make public our intention To return to gath not just port prosperity, But all territory taken in the battle of prosperity<eos> - Including lands north of the river. - That's us.<eos> - ? - He just gave away our home.<eos> Redraw our own map, make our face ugly.<eos> You have to talk him out of this.<eos> - Me?<eos> - You're his hero.<eos> He doesn't listen to people like me.<eos> If he won't, others will.
?<eos> I was up for that part.<eos> I think I'm gonna like it here.<eos> There are so many friends of Dorothy here.<eos> You know what this journey has taught me?<eos> What?<eos> That I want you in my life forever.<eos> Steve?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Of course I will.
He's a work in progress, just like all the rest of us.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Private convCR. The adts are talki Come on.<eos> Adults?<eos> Having a baby does not make either one of us an adult. I don't wanna talk about tonightonth an Frankly,I'm a little nervous.<eos> Don't be nervous. They're nice guys.<eos> Yeah,but I'm not.<eos> - What if they don't like me?<eos> - They will.
And now he's married to the door-breaker.<eos> Well,I promise to never break down your door.<eos> I'm sorry if I seemed meologetic, talking to Mr. Molina Mout marroung<eos> It's just that we bow that that wahe way t a life together,didn'r,d edet married in the fir<eos> I know,but that was if it was okay with your parents.<eos> And it's not.<eos> It's clearly not.<eos> So I can't marry you,Amy.<eos> But we're gonna have to figure out what this non-married, unmarried,want-to-be-marrd relationship is.<eos> And we will.

But I gotta tell you, living clean and sober with a woman I'm in love with, doing work I love each day.<eos> Doesn't get much better than that.<eos> Unless you get it right the first time, without the drugs and the death and the divorce, and still appreciate life this much.<eos> I don't want my parents to get divorced.<eos> So that's what you can do for me.<eos> You can make sure that my parents don't get divorced.<eos> They seem unhappy.<eos> Couldn't help but notice.<eos> But I think they think that if they get divorced, they're gonna be a lot happier.<eos> Yeah,but I won't.
Not interested.<eos> Not interested in what?<eos> The job or the truth?<eos> My loyalty is to Barker.<eos> You know, I thought I made myself pretty damn clear on the train to you and your friend.<eos> What happened to her, anyway, your iceberg girlfriend?<eos> She didn't get you to take the gig.<eos> That's what happened to her.<eos> I guess you'll be joing her, 'cause you didn't, either.<eos> Oh, I will.
OK.<eos> I'm seeing a psychologist.<eos> For my fear of flying.<eos> Really?<eos> Great.<eos> That's great, Yigal.<eos> I'm proud of you.<eos> I'm really proud of you.<eos> I want to come with you to Paris.<eos> -So you will.
- I need you to come with me.<eos> - Something wrong?<eos> We have concerns about some health exposure you may have experienced.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> Michael Scofield, Vincent Sandinsky. Get in the car.<eos> - Wha...?<eos> - Back seat.<eos> Get in!<eos> Please. Don't hurt me.<eos> We won't.
Your sister would freak out if she saw us hanging out together.<eos> Come on. Let her freak.<eos> It's nothing new.<eos> Okay.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Maybe.<eos> I'll think about it.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll see you at the game tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
- I'm not that great a catch. - Mmm.<eos> That's true.<eos> There you go.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Look at this.<eos> He cut off his own hand.<eos> Thought he could stop the bleeding, but he panicked.<eos> - Is he okay?<eos> - Somebody better call his parents.<eos> I will.
*******<eos> And brebd brendan,he's really the sneakiest bastard i have to worry about.<eos> We smile at each other.We've hugged.<eos> I've kissed him on the neck softly.<eos> He's felt my warm breath on the nape of his neck,even the small of his back.<eos> But,you know,as the old adage goes,keep your friends close and your enemies closer,that's right,right?<eos> Here's the thing,if i go with you-- you know-- there are two basic alliances,right.<eos> I know i can get to the final four with taj and brendan.<eos> And i will go with you,with coach,tyson and debbie now if you promise me you will turn on them.<eos> I will.
Julian... I...<eos> I care about you so much.<eos> Never let it be said that Brooke Davis is easy.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> That wasn't fair.<eos> You know what? It's okay.<eos> Someday you'll let someone in.<eos> Today's just not that day.<eos> I don't want this to change anything.<eos> No, it won't.
White underwearwith white.<eos> I always sleep on the Ieft side, with my glass of water on the night table, on the Ieft.<eos> I have lots of little hang-ups like that.<eos> Thank you for asking me here.<eos> It's good to get out.<eos> Change perspectives.<eos> GisèIe?<eos> I know that Fred's body isn't even cold yet.<eos> I don't want to take advantage of the situation.<eos> But... I will, just a little, to...
- Here?<eos> - Here.<eos> This town.<eos> Why?<eos> Because this is where my dad lives.<eos> Aren't you coming with me?<eos> Not yet.<eos> But I want you to meet him.<eos> I brought you here to meet him.<eos> I will.
- Yeah, a home for my baby.<eos> - I'm sure you'll find a home, Amy.<eos> I did find one.<eos> The couple backed out.<eos> For an entire family of children who were in foster care and desperately need a home.<eos> I'm pretty desperate too.<eos> Amy...<eos> There's a couple out there just dreaming of becoming parents to your baby.<eos> I'm sure you'll find them - And if I don't?<eos> - You will.
You're a good man,sergeant.<eos> Neurologically, he's fine.<eos> And doctor's cleared him for release first thing in the morning.<eos> And whatabout the amnesia?<eos> He still claimsto have no idea who heor anyone else is.<eos> What the hellam I supposed to do with that?<eos> I swear to god, marshal.<eos> Relax, I'll have himin denver by 10:00 A.M.Tomorrow,ready to testify.<eos> Straight.<eos> I will.
Hurry up.<eos> We'll help you out, Bertrand!<eos> You hear me?<eos> Remember our tavern?<eos> And Blanche?<eos> Of course.<eos> She has always been in my mind. Every single day.<eos> Life has taken me my daughter but gave me back three children.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> - We will.
Of course.<eos> She has always been in my mind. Every single day.<eos> Life has taken me my daughter but gave me back three children.<eos> Take care of each other.<eos> - We will.<eos> - Promise.<eos> This Officer La Reynie... He killed Blanche too.<eos> I'll cut him open.<eos> Like an animal.<eos> Yes you will.
I wish God would do the same for me.<eos> I would be happier.<eos> You are too young to know what happiness is.<eos> Let us not make your brother wait any longer.<eos> It has been a month!<eos> I know. I am busy chasing a crook.<eos> Yesterday, he killed six of my men.<eos> - God!<eos> Did you arrest him?<eos> - I will soon.
He's on his way.<eos> I need him.<eos> Soon.<eos> I can't wait.<eos> He took Titou home.<eos> We won't grow old together.<eos> That's not true.<eos> You'll survive.<eos> Lucky Charm. - Tell him to remember me...<eos> - I will.
Don't you worry about Eric.<eos> We'll do the job and go home.<eos> A deal's a deal.<eos> Sookie, you know what he's like.<eos> What's it to him to break a contract with a girl?<eos> A woman.<eos> He needs me.<eos> He won't want to make me mad.<eos> I can't lose you.<eos> You never will.
It was Jordan's idea to come here.<eos> I was hoping you'd be gone by now.<eos> I told you he was bright.<eos> You played me.<eos> I needed to get inside your head, see if you should join our club.<eos> But you're not easy to read.<eos> We really need to talk about personal space.<eos> It's not too late, Jordan.<eos> Boodikka believes in my vision.<eos> Others will too.
Chloe would have done that for anyone.<eos> She believes in second chances.<eos> She doesn't actually have feelings for you.<eos> Why, because of what I am?<eos> I didn't want this, Clark.<eos> I even killed myself to try escape this life.<eos> But the darkness, it doesn't come out when Chloe's around.<eos> She makes me human.<eos> What happens when that changes?<eos> It won't.
I think they were ready to get married and have a baby on their second date.<eos> I think they did.<eos> I really hate that I'm gonna miss Jamie getting bigger.<eos> By the time I come home to visit he'll already be walking and talking.<eos> - Not with Nathan and Haley.<eos> He'll be reading and dribbling first.<eos> They are gonna be amazing parents.<eos> And you are gonna be an amazing mom.<eos> You should have that one day.<eos> And you will.
That's not what Lucas said.<eos> He told you.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> I was going to, but I wanted you to go to L.A. With Julian.<eos> And I knew that you wouldn't go if you knew.<eos> You suck for not telling me, and I'm not going anywhere, so...<eos> What are we gonna do, P. Sawyer?<eos> How am I gonna help us get through this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We just will.
It's time for you to become a spy.<eos> Yes!<eos> - Yes!<eos> Love the smell of Burbank in the morning!<eos> Smells like victory!<eos> Hey! We know what you did.<eos> Well, do you now?<eos> You went too far, Michael.<eos> I'm calling the cops.<eos> No, you won't.
Thanks for stopping me back there.<eos> The store doesn't need any more trouble than it's already got.<eos> What is it, sir?<eos> Rumors mostly.<eos> There's been some talk about a store in the area closing.<eos> People being fired-- Times are tough.<eos> Sure, yeah.<eos> We can't let that happen.<eos> Don't worry, son.<eos> We won't.
Last chance for everybody.<eos> And we're gonna need a little luck.<eos> If anything happens to me make sure L.J. and Sofia...<eos> You got it.<eos> - Same for me?<eos> Yeah, put your head down, let's go.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You know, someday, weeks will go by. Maybe even years. It won't even cross our minds.<eos> Yeah, all we gotta do is survive.<eos> We will.
Too bad about Chloe's dad, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> What's she going to do?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Well, her job.<eos> She was working for him, right?<eos> I don't really think that's on her mind right now.<eos> Sure.<eos> Well, tell her we're sorry.<eos> I will.
None of which you ever speak about. My company makes planes. And I don't even run it.<eos> And I travel.<eos> I am no danger to you.<eos> - That's the God's truth.<eos> - I'm sorry you had to go through this. I just want an honest shot... to join this family and to marry Charlie. And now I have to ask the man that I love... to choose between his work and his wife.<eos> Well, I will not ask him to do that.<eos> Do you really love him?<eos> Sometimes things are just what they appear to be.<eos> Will you help me?<eos> Yes, I will.
I'll be damned if i know, but she is.<eos> You just made detective.<eos> Call your sergeant.<eos> You got till my sergeant gets here.<eos> She'll tell the pastor where the baby is.<eos> Well, that's good.<eos> Thank you, nora.<eos> Because the pastor will know what to do.<eos> That's right.<eos> She will.
Nadia!<eos> Time is short.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Stand back.<eos> It's one of the Dharma houses.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> Jack, don't misunderstand who's in charge here.<eos> I'll go first.<eos> If someone in that house is a threat, you might hesitate.<eos> - But I won't.
Who is that man, John?<eos> Me.<eos> Richard.<eos> Richard, what is happening?<eos> What's happening is you're bleeding to death.<eos> I need to get the bullet out.<eos> How did you know there was a bullet in my leg, Richard?<eos> Because you told me there was, John.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Well... You will.
My friend didn't just bail at the last minute.<eos> You never invited anyone.<eos> No, since the accident, nobody gets what I'm going through, but...<eos> With you, it's... it's easy.<eos> You get it.<eos> I should probably get some rest.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I should go.<eos> Hey, but, uh, don't forget to put ointment on it.<eos> I won't.
I just did what I had to do.<eos> No,no.You...you kicked ass.<eos> I'm not like that.<eos> I'm good,but not like you.I'm not... good under pressure.<eos> She's really sick-- really sick-- and I'm not good under pressure.<eos> But even when our hopes give way to reality and we finally have to surrender to the truth... it just means we've lost today's battle... could I have another,please?<eos> Not tomorrow's war.<eos> So I guess a big wedding won't be that bad.<eos> I'm just sad 'cause I didn't get a chance to see you in the actual dress.<eos> -You will.
It's called modeling.<eos> You, uh, model yourself on your subject. Subject?<eos> You're not trying this n.<eos> I.p. crap on me. No.<eos> You said this would establish a rapport.<eos> Well, it needs work.<eos> I'm going back to the office.<eos> Come and see me when you're done.<eos> - I don't believe this n. I.p. stuff works at all.<eos> - You will.
The welcome wagon.<eos> Hey,here's an idea.Get lost.<eos> It's okay.He's just being friendly.<eos> Yeah,papi,chill.<eos> I'm just being friendly.<eos> So how about it?<eos> Want to come over?<eos> Oh,not today,hijito.<eos> But once I've moved in,you and your friends should comeover here.<eos> Okay,fresa.We will.We will.
And when I lost Keebler, it was bad.<eos> People always mock what they don't understand. Right.<eos> So you understand this isn't just another collar for me.<eos> This is my shot at redemption. Please.<eos> This guy's an easy win for you.<eos> If there is any way that you can see clear to hand him over, I swear I will bring him back the minute that he's sentenced.<eos> I can do that.<eos> This is an open-and-shut case for us. Nobody got hurt.<eos> As long as you promise to bring him back.<eos> Oh, I will.
I'm not sure you two formally met.<eos> I'm glad you're here. I got a gift for you:<eos> My daily activity log.<eos> We were just dropping Nate off- just a way to say thank you for chatting to us about his big brother- and I thought it wouldn't hurt to see if you were free today to answer some questions.<eos> I'm crazy busy.<eos> I need to finish my yogurt... then I was planning on working out-<eos> Well, until your calendar clears up, just know... I'm gonna make my way through every friend, relative and associate you have.<eos> Let me save you some time.<eos> My friends and family don't know anything.<eos> Sooner or later, someone will.
- What are you talkin' about?<eos> Six inches?<eos> - Look at your car.<eos> It's in the middle of the street. Look at it!<eos> And you're getting in my face?<eos> It is supposed to only be six inches from the curb!<eos> Say it's eight inches from the curb.<eos> Say it!<eos> - Get off me, man!<eos> - I will.
What are you saying?<eos> -Are--are you asking-- -move in with me?<eos> I mean,we already spend so much time together,and I love it.<eos> But it just makes me want to spend more time with you.<eos> are you freaked out?<eos> You look freaked out?<eos> No,no,no,I'm not.I'm not freaked out.<eos> It--it--it's exciting.It's just big.It's big. I know it is.I'm just asking you to think about it,okay?<eos> But try to think good things.<eos> I will.
THIS IS NOT THE NEW "90210" PREMIERE.<eos> THIS IS SCORSESE.<eos> I AM PUMPED INDEED!<eos> OH, A LITTLE HEAD'S UP, THE WIFE'S PROBABLY NOT GOING TO COME.<eos> WHAT? WHY NOT?<eos> THIS IS A COUPLE'S THING. MY WIFE IS VERY EXCITED.<eos> - AS WAS I.<eos> - WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON WITH YOU?<eos> - WHAT IF YOUR WIFE DOESN'T LIKE MARLOW?<eos> - OF COURSE SHE WILL!
You did what?<eos> Don't be mad at me, OK?<eos> I don't know if I could take that right now. We used protection.<eos> He had a condom in his wallet that he said had been there since high school.<eos> It wasn't love, and it wasn't perfect or anything.<eos> But I'm glad I did it. I got it over with.<eos> - And I wanted to tell you first because I wanted you to know that you didn't fuck me up.<eos> My life is tough and weird and unpleasant sometimes, but I walk around knowing that I have parents who love me, who care about me, who always try their best, even if they screw up sometimes.<eos> I know I gave you a hard time when Mom was gone, but I hope you know that I love you, Dad.<eos> And I always will.
"Without verity, there is no justice."<eos> I am so sorry, thomas, for your... unspeakable loss.<eos> But it's time now to quiet the voicesshouting for revenge, and listen to your ownpraying for justice.<eos> He came to see me last night.<eos> It was obvious he was suffering.<eos> And he paid a heavy price.<eos> He didn't ask for forgiveness.<eos> He didn't ask for anything.<eos> He just said, "do thisand you and all the families "hurt by the bridge collapse will get your justice."<eos> Maybe now you will.
Then tell Sam the truth.<eos> I am sorry Sam.<eos> Sam is not gonna bring me back bunny.<eos> I'm sorry because you made the mistake.<eos> Not me.<eos> You were late.<eos> You were early.<eos> They targeted me too when you got yourself killed.<eos> I love you.<eos> I always will.
Excuse me.<eos> We need some help.<eos> I got it.<eos> You're buying lunch.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I think it's marvelous the hotel has a nurse on duty.<eos> I'm sorry I puked.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Yes it will.
- All is OK<eos> What?<eos> I will work for you<eos> Help me, I need money<eos> I also asked you for help, remember?<eos> And what did I get out of it?<eos> I don't even have money for cigarettes<eos> You are too old<eos> - Nobody would want you<eos> - Somebody will
How's this one?<eos> Let me see...<eos> Not bad!<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where the fuck is he?<eos> !<eos> What if he doesn't come?<eos> He will come.<eos> What if not?<eos> He will!
You're like a young Sue Sylvester.<eos> Now get out of my office... if you can manage to squeeze through the door without your water breaking... all over my new carpet.<eos> You know what? I don't think I wanna be a Cheerio after all.<eos> I don't wanna be on a team where I only appear to belong.<eos> I'd rather be a part of a club that's proud to have me... like Glee Club.<eos> It's my fault.<eos> If I hadn't slept on that mattress... we could have just returned them and moved on.<eos> - Hey, can I give you some advice?<eos> You need to give yourself a break.<eos> You'll...
I am so sorry about rebecca's behavior.<eos> - just please don't say anything to arthur.<eos> Kyle, you can't.<eos> Whatever you did with rebecca...<eos> - i didn't.<eos> - whatever you're going to do, I don't care.<eos> Just please, i'm begging you.<eos> Don't tell him. - i wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.<eos> i won't.
I suppose you mean the Hanbury estate.<eos> I sometimes wonder what will become of England.<eos> When it's not confounded by geography, it's imprisoned by its old ways.<eos> But why should that be?<eos> There are people enough who wish to see things changed.<eos> I count myself among them.<eos> But if I follow the path that my father has laid down, it'll be years before I'll have the power to act.<eos> I may be more than 30!<eos> And by then I might be as hidebound as he.<eos> No, you won't.
And when I stood in our lady of Guadalupe in east L.A.,<eos> I didn't feel any different there than I would've felt at Saint Luke's or Saint Alban's, because I was taught that people are people, and those who work the hardest are those who earn your respect.<eos> Councilman Rizzario...<eos> Hector, the people of Los Angeles want a football team and I intend to give it to them.<eos> So bring on your lawsuit, whoever the fuck you want, and I will prove my stadium will employ more people faster than your opposition research can calculate.<eos> Are you with me?<eos> I hope so, this thing works, you will be the fucking mayor.<eos> Thanks for stopping by, Hector.<eos> So no uncle Bobby, right?<eos> Will you...?
I'm not going to let you down.<eos> I'm not your dad.<eos> Well, then, you just tell me what the birth control is for. Because...<eos> Okay, I know what it's for, but... Yeah, it was... But...<eos> Uh, it's for...<eos> But we don't... I mean, we've never... Tucker, you know me.<eos> I'm a planner.<eos> I didn't know you were planning that.<eos> Listen. I promise I'll never... I'll never do something stupid like go through your purse ever again.<eos> Yes, you will.
Nobody's saying that you're crazy. Okay?<eos> But if we go to trial and lose, you'll end up in jail for a lot longer than the three months they offered before.<eos> This is a much better option, safer, more comfortable.<eos> - I ain't copping no plea.<eos> I ain't copping no plea!<eos> How many times I got to tell y'all that?<eos> We going to trial.<eos> - We will lose.<eos> - We ain't gonna lose.<eos> Yes, we will.
But that's just 'cause you're cursed with schmuckness.<eos> - You're an asshole.<eos> - Okay, look...<eos> The truth of the matter is, you're cursed with schmuckness.<eos> You want my help? Is that what you want?<eos> Fine, I will help you.<eos> My gosh! Thank you.<eos> After I slam his dick in this drawer.<eos> - Let's go, he's not gonna help.<eos> - No, I will.
And even if you did, even if he did, who's going to pay for the tickets?<eos> And where are you gonna live and how are you gonna take care of yourself and him?<eos> Ben will take care of all of that.<eos> You're getting your own place? Your own apartment?<eos> You really want to leave me here for the summer when Ricky's getting his own apartment?<eos> I wonder what they're talking about.<eos> Don't say anything to Ricky about Mr. Juergens.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> He might tell Amy.<eos> No, I won't.

And then the next moment,I can't get you and me out of my mind-- you and me and what we did and...<eos> I just feel so guilty, and I hate myself.<eos> Sometimes I just get angry--really angry.<eos> My emotions are all over the place.<eos> I don't want to say I know because I don't know.<eos> I was much younger when my dad died.But, uh, I remember how I would go from weeping to forgetting to remembering to being screaming angry-- just hitting my bed with a baseball bat.<eos> That helps.<eos> If you want, I'll bring you a bat.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I will.
So you first with all the girls can bouncing?<eos> True, someone Merchandise must be tested.<eos> Seriously.<eos> I may take a few very nice girls for our search.<eos> Admit it, the last one they sent us has been not much.<eos> Come on. No way.<eos> We need you here.<eos> Did you cousin in Romania?<eos> - I think so. Call her directly.<eos> We will a month the salon open.
I can't believethis is happening to me.<eos> Now I lose sofia too.<eos> She grew up with nothing.She'll never goback to that life.<eos> Once she finds out,she'll find a manwho can provide for her, a man who investswith his mind,not his heart.<eos> Well,I hope you don't planto use that misery knife thing on anyone.<eos> I'm sellingmy personal collection.<eos> It's the only wayto keep sofia.<eos> Wait,you're selling off assets to pay for your wife'scrazy shopping sprees?<eos> Why don't you just tell her that you can't afford themanymore?<eos> This will coverour medical bill.
Just you.<eos> Does Michael still ask about his dad?<eos> Every night.<eos> The same question--<eos> "When's dad coming home?"<eos> Counselor, are you okay?<eos> I need a moment.<eos> And what do you tell him?<eos> I tell him that his dad is always with him... always loves him... and I pray to God that as he gets older, Michael doesn't forget his father.<eos> He won't.
Sisterhood.<eos> Maybe it won't work out?<eos> Maybe I'll be back in a month.<eos> You never know.<eos> You never know.<eos> Stay here.<eos> I wanna get a picture.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> You'll see her again.<eos> Sure I will.
- Good luck to you, drama.<eos> And tell that man of yours to keep his eyes pinned wide open 'cause I'm gonna be gunning for him.<eos> I will.<eos> All right, lloyd, I'll sign with you.<eos> Yippie-ki-yay, motherfucker !<eos> - Calm down, lloyd.<eos> - I can't.<eos> We're gonna make magic together, johnny drama.<eos> Let me just please get this show.<eos> You will.

I'm sorry.<eos> You take care of that baby, okay?<eos> You take care yours.<eos> This is for you.<eos> He never said anything to me.<eos> Why didn't he just tell me?<eos> 'Cause he knew you'll try to stop him.<eos> He knew you do anything to protect your family.<eos> But I didn't.<eos> Well... You will soon.
You're not even supposed to be in the building, and you two clowns arewayout of hand.<eos> Let me deal with this.<eos> Come here.<eos> Lisbon, look at me.<eos> Look at me.<eos> I'll handle it.<eos> Will you please trust me?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Later, you will.
That's not what I want for my child.<eos> Okay.<eos> Then promise me if things get crazy, you'll quit your job.<eos> Promise me that.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> But what I can do is try to prove to you... as much as possible that.<eos> I will try my best to do what's right what... whatever that is for us and for our kid.<eos> Every family has these doubts, but... you just have to make a leap of faith.<eos> I just want to make sure we leap together.<eos> We will.
And you do ?<eos> I'm gonna get a place of my own.<eos> I got money.<eos> Money from what ?<eos> Skating.<eos> Right.<eos> Look, I got a sponsor.<eos> Hey, baby, how about giving me some of that money, 'cause... ?<eos> Did you ever give Mick that board I sent ?<eos> Uh... I will, I will.
A kiss for luck?<eos> I thought you were into young brunettes.<eos> No, no, I'm into old brun...<eos> Didn't come out right, did it? No, no.<eos> Hey, actually, you know what? I could use you.<eos> I don't know. I'm not a piece of meat.<eos> I mean, I got feelings, emotions.<eos> Time's a-wastin'.<eos> Drop them.<eos> No, there'll no pant-dropping without a nice dinner and many, many cocktails.
She's so tall. She's beautiful.<eos> Oh, I'm sure she is.<eos> She has such a lovely mother.<eos> Thank you. Nora, you've never told me.<eos> Holly, I smell your cake burning. So do I.<eos> Yes.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> In the kitchen.<eos> I don't smell anything. You will, mother.<eos> You will.
Just ignore me, you sleep.<eos> Okay.<eos> If you want, I could tell your boyfriend that you're better.<eos> My boyfriend?<eos> Well, I knew you thought that you were pregnant.<eos> And I don't see you going the turkey baster route, so I just assumed that you had a boyfriend,<eos> - and I could call him for you.<eos> - Mom. Unless you think he strangled you because he's married.<eos> I don't want to talk about this now.<eos> Then we won't.
- But Mr. Greenblatt...<eos> - died of natural causes.<eos> There was no murder.<eos> No cash changed hands.<eos> I just talked to agent stone.<eos> The case is closed.<eos> I still don't understand.<eos> Why would the mob want to kill him?<eos> Nobody knows.<eos> Probably never will.
You know, you asked me what kind of a man you are.<eos> Do you want to know what I think?<eos> I think you're the kind that married the wrong person.<eos> Maybe she married the wrong person.<eos> Maybe I'm not cut out for all that... -love, marriage.<eos> Maybe I'm... it's just not in me.<eos> It is.<eos> You're a good man.<eos> And in time, eventually, you'll, uh, you'll find someone.<eos> You will.
Is it possible that she's just run away?<eos> Lieutenant...<eos> I know my daughter.<eos> She would never,ever do anything to leave me to wonder.<eos> She would never do that.<eos> Okay,what kind of a car was she driving?<eos> A Nissan.<eos> There's the license number right there.<eos> Tell me you'll help me.<eos> I will.
It always was.<eos> But you never gave humanity a chance.<eos> They've made you weak.<eos> If she travels back in time, then the lives we know will cease to exist.<eos> You have destroyed our world.<eos> Take the ring, put it on.<eos> - No.<eos> - You have to. Now.<eos> What if i never see you again?<eos> You will.
Last week, we got our asses beat. Doing our best and there are no shame on that, gentlemen.<eos> But I tell you what I've got a shame.<eos> I have got shame and I apologize to you.<eos> I apologize for not given you the chance to finish your fight.<eos> I want to finish that fight with you.<eos> And I'm asking you right here.

What happened with Francis? Did you dump him or did he dump you?<eos> Neither.<eos> He's still in a coma from his tractor accident.<eos> - Oh, I wanna go see Francis.<eos> - Don't be such a baby.<eos> Fine, I'll do it, but not today.<eos> I mean, how heartless would it be to break up With someone five months before their birthday?<eos> The follow-through is looking much better, Gladys.<eos> You go, Gladys, you're gonna get it in one day.<eos> - She never will. - No.
- no!<eos> - what's this?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Let us have the money.<eos> The girl might live.<eos> Put your hands behind your back.<eos> You are making a bad mistake.<eos> If you people don't let me go right now,<eos> Mia westlake will be tortured to death If they think you've Done anything to me.<eos> No, they won't.

This means that strong!<eos> now I'm going to kill the demon!<eos> cast!<eos> the demon escaped to the other side!<eos> If no one can help ... here.<eos> tomorrow I will not.

Okay, well, uh, you're really sure that this is what you want?<eos> I already called them.<eos> They know I'm coming.<eos> Maybe you and your friends, you can give me a ride, huh?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You'll call, right, Pop?<eos> I'll call, you'll call, we'll visit.<eos> We'll be sick of each other.<eos> I'll miss ya, Hank.<eos> Of course you will.
They want me to start on Monday.<eos> I know. I heard.<eos> Well, for what it's worth, I think that you are gonna do great.<eos> You know I love you.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> It's just...<eos> You never asked me to go with you, and that kind of hurt.<eos> So you'd have gone with me?<eos> 'Cause, baby, if you want to go... Come to Los Angeles with me.<eos> Will you?
When she denies that she knows anything, she's lying.<eos> When she says she's sorry, she means it.<eos> She cares about Reynolds, but just not enough to tell the whole truth.<eos> We need to up the stakes on her, make it more clear how her actions are affecting Reynolds.<eos> How much pull you got with the Justice Department?<eos> - It depends, what are you asking for?<eos> - I need to call in a favor.<eos> I'm gonna take run at her.<eos> She's not gonna simply crack under pressure.<eos> Under the right kind of pressure, she will.
Once word spreads that you partnered up with them-- the same stickup boys who terrorized every drug dealer in Phoenix--<eos> I think some pretty dangerous people are gonna come looking for you.<eos> You know what I would do if I was you?<eos> I'd turn myself in, let the police protect me.<eos> It's just a suggestion.<eos> Lady, I don't have any idea what you're talking about.<eos> But do yourself a favor.<eos> Don't lose any sleep worrying about me.<eos> (chuckles) Don't worry.<eos> I won't.
You love me so much you couldn't let me go?<eos> Well, you weren't supposed to hear that, mother.<eos> I'm glad i did.<eos> I now have a witness If she ever tries to tell me how insufferable i am.<eos> I'm gonna go clear the table.<eos> Thank you, mother.<eos> So i take it you didn't tell him About your little trip this summer?<eos> No, and i'd like to keep it that way.<eos> When will you learn, my love, That some secrets can't stay hidden?<eos> Well, this one will.
- No.<eos> - Hmm. What's the problem?<eos> - It's a cross!<eos> Well, it does say Mercy Mosque.<eos> On a cross!<eos> It's like putting Jesus on the Star of David.<eos> Oh, now that's just offensive. I can't believe you'd even say that.<eos> Besides, it's white on white. You can't even read it!<eos> Well, the important thing is, you know it's there.<eos> But my congregation won't.
- Oh, gesundheit. [ECHOING]<eos> PLASTIC MAN: Do you swear allegiance to the side of goodness and right?<eos> WOOZY: I do.<eos> Will you strike terror into cowardly and superstitious criminals everywhere?<eos> WOOZY: I will.
Well, it's moments like that we do the job for. Everything was right.<eos> The light was right, blue water, the four tonnes of flying fish all going mental.<eos> Thanks, Barry.You're welcome. But now the fish's attention is turned to something bigger.<eos> Their spawning directly onto the boat.<eos> Barry is worried as he drags up a huge sheet of eggs.<eos> Gotta bring it on the boat and check it out. I cleaned this off like five minutes a go. Right?<eos> Right now the problem is this, there's too many flying fish... Too many...around us.<eos> If we moor through the nights with the lights on and stuff, more and more will keep coming and what they're doing is they're actually laying on the boat now, so the boat has become their object and that is not good.<eos> So basically you're worried that if we just stay on this drift we're gonna sink the boat.<eos> Five hours from now that'll 3,000 pounds.Yeah, yeah.
I'm kind of a downer.<eos> King, that's not true.<eos> - You could introduce me to the king if you want.<eos> Let me see your face.<eos> What is that?<eos> Don't worry, let me see it.<eos> Oooh, good shot, Douglas!<eos> Almost got me. Almost got me, Douglas.<eos> We'll get him next time, won't we?<eos> Yes, we will. We will.
May I suggest we find the city's 9 or 10 best skiers?<eos> Send them. The real test is on foot. Osipov!<eos> Write up an order.<eos> To form two groups, 12 people each.<eos> Two groups are too many, Comrade Zhdanov.<eos> Three groups, 12 people each. And immediately begin a search on foot across the lake.<eos> You have 24 hours.<eos> They won't make it back alive, Comrade Zhdanov.<eos> Out of three groups?<eos> Someone will.
My name's Henry.<eos> How funny.<eos> I have a son named Henry.<eos> But he's just 3.<eos> I met a girl.<eos> And since I've been with her, I feel safe.<eos> I haven't felt that way for a long time.<eos> Not since I was a kid.<eos> I wish she could hear you sing.<eos> Maybe she will one day.
-Big, what you doing?<eos> Sometimes you rise above it, sometimes you step on in.<eos> Don't sing that song.<eos> -l got to.<eos> Check it out.<eos> This industry will turn your best friends into your worst enemies.<eos> Pac warned me, but I didn't believe him.<eos> This song was made months ago.<eos> He probably won't believe me.<eos> Maybe nobody will.
When are you paying my dues?<eos> I said I'll pay you on the 25th.<eos> - That's what you say every month.<eos> Mannu, it's an ISD call.<eos> Talk to me.<eos> Arjun, just a minute..<eos> ..I'm just giving a coin to a beggar.<eos> I told you before, I'll pay you on the 25th.<eos> But in which month?<eos> In any month, but I surely will.
So, what did you do after I left?<eos> You were working hard and I was flirting hard<eos> You became famous, and I was getting infamous.<eos> Do you see that star?<eos> Where?<eos> That one, which is shining the brightest.<eos> Yes.<eos> - I want to shine in the world just liket hat.<eos> One day, the two of us will be shining just like that star.<eos> Yes, we will.
- One, two...<eos> - No.<eos> Two and a half, two and three quarters, three.<eos> Here I come.<eos> - No!<eos> What do you want?<eos> - What you wanted from your mother.<eos> I want you to love me.<eos> Okay.<eos> I will.
Dad, I know you never listen to me, but you have to believe us!<eos> She waited until you were out of town, and she drugged me, and she drugged Alex.<eos> - What?<eos> - She was gonna kill us.<eos> Alex had to do it, Dad.<eos> She saved us.<eos> - Alex? - Alex, tell him.<eos> Anna, what are you saying?<eos> He can't see it, Anna.<eos> He never will.
Please, listen to him, Papa.<eos> He has our best interests at heart.<eos> We are speaking only of the rights to your words, your ideas.<eos> With all love and respect the countess is too interested in making a profit from your work.<eos> She's my wife.<eos> She's part of me. We've been together all these years.<eos> But you're more than a husband and father.<eos> She must understand that.<eos> The best interests of the people are one with your own. - You belong to them.<eos> - She won't.
Well, I was assigned to cover the teacher in space.<eos> - Wait.<eos> So you're a reporter?<eos> - But I thought he was a teacher.<eos> No, I'm with...

I'm not a danger to anyone or anything.<eos> Don't let her get me!<eos> Sorry.<eos> - How long will I be here?<eos> - Indefinitely.<eos> - Can I contact my parents? - No.<eos> - Derek?<eos> - Negative.<eos> - Do they know where I am?<eos> - No, and they never will!
- Double bluff.<eos> I like it.<eos> - Still don't believe you.<eos> What about Chaos Theory?<eos> You do know about Chaos Theory? Oh!<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Chaos Theory is the idea that all actions have consequences... when you take that... quantum leap...<eos> OK, erm, bit of advice.<eos> When you are talking about this stuff, speak with a bit more confidence about it.<eos> OK, well, I will.
But we've talked about the demo, like, a gazillion times.<eos> - He's the one that gave me the budget.<eos> - Jesus.<eos> Everything's all right, Gerry.<eos> I promise. - Marc, we can't do this without Gribble.<eos> - I know that!<eos> I'm going to talk to him tonight. Face to face about this.<eos> I swear to you, when I tell him that we're ready, he's going to jump at the chance.<eos> - And if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
If you stick one more pin in me, I swear I will call the guard.<eos> Your first visit will be the most important.<eos> We cannot have any mistakes.<eos> And always remember, you're first a Coburg.<eos> The King of the Belgians is a Coburg. The King of Portugal is a Coburg. The Queen of England's mother is a Coburg, and you are the next piece in the game.<eos> Now go to England and make her smile.<eos> Is this all the luggage?<eos> - What if she wants to dance?<eos> - It's your first visit.<eos> She won't.
Do you remember?<eos> We came back here for tea.<eos> There were some people on the pavement outside... not many, five or six.<eos> - I remember.<eos> One of them was a middle-aged man... a shopkeeper perhaps, or a bus driver.<eos> He was full of hope and trust.<eos> "Good luck, Winnie," he said.<eos> "God bless you."<eos> I mustn't let him down.<eos> - You won't.
Yes. Fine.<eos> Where's that fabulous brunch I was promised ?<eos> - REBECCA : I have to take mine to go.<eos> - Pass this down.<eos> I have to get a dress for tonight.<eos> My formal event wardrobe is pretty non-existent.<eos> Oh, hey. If you're still out shopping this afternoon, call me.<eos> I need no excuse to buy myself a little new something.<eos> Yeah, cool.<eos> I will.
You did what I would've done.<eos> On my way here, I stopped and I got this.<eos> For when we get it right.<eos> Because we will.<eos> We will succeed and we will save someone.<eos> Then, when we do, we're going to open this bottle of champagne.<eos> And we're going to drink to Phillip Robinson and Darren Covington and all the other patients who helped us change the face of medicine.<eos> And we're going to celebrate.<eos> We're going to use this as our victory dance.<eos> Meredith, we will.
- Definitely.<eos> I don't think, um...<eos> I'm not sure you'll be conscious, uh, before we take Beth, so...<eos> So... so I'll see you after your surgery.<eos> All right. See you after.<eos> - Wait, Jer.<eos> Wait.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - What if you die?<eos> - I won't.

And please do not say anything to Delinda.<eos> She's gonna hate me.<eos> - Yeah, of course.<eos> She and Piper have become pretty close over the last couple of months.<eos> Hate coming right at ya.<eos> - Danny mccoy.<eos> What do you have to say for yourself?<eos> How can you put your head on your pillow and sleep at night?<eos> I can answer that for you...<eos> you won't.
-Yes?<eos> Forgive me, for there is someone over here a friend who wishes a word with you in private.<eos> -Which friend?<eos> -This way, my lady.<eos> Jane.<eos> Your Majesty.<eos> I ask you only one thing.<eos> That you allow me to serve and worship you as Lancelot served and worshipped Guinevere.<eos> Sweet, gentle lady will you let me so?<eos> I will.
He's got it socked away, doesn't want to let on.<eos> That's why he's dresses in the ratty clothes.<eos> And he's lonely, sure, he's lonely.<eos> What do lonely people want?<eos> Friends. - That's right. So I become his best friend.<eos> "Hey, let's have lunch every Thursday.<eos> How 'bout a little business deal?"<eos> He's writing a cashier's check faster than he can change his wet diaper.<eos> I just think he's lonely and his wife died.<eos> So will we.
-I can't.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> It'll be alright. Do you hear me?<eos> -ls he breathing?<eos> -Yes, he is.<eos> Is he a friend of yours?<eos> Stay calm, we'll help you. -Police!<eos> -Someone's at the door.<eos> Open the door! Police!<eos> -I won't.

Send me some of your stories, Nick, especially the ghost ones.<eos> I will.<eos> Try not to let the headmaster pinch you in the butt, Ikey.<eos> He does, I'll knee him in the chestnuts.<eos> And you be nice to the girls, Latekka.<eos> I promise.<eos> My birthday's in two months, Owen.<eos> I'm gonna have a party at my new house.<eos> Make sure you guys come to the Flats for it.<eos> - I will.
What can I get you?<eos> I just wanna talk.<eos> About what?<eos> It's cool.<eos> I get it.<eos> I guess it just took a trip to see my grands to put it in perspective.<eos> Nothing needs to get put in perspective.<eos> It was a disagreement.<eos> That'll happen.<eos> It will.
That's the last time I'm having you take the piss, Pete.<eos> Next time, you're on your own.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just thought that you might've liked a bit of company.<eos> I'm dead, Pete.<eos> What does that tell you?<eos> It tells you that dead people don't like company.<eos> - Now, jog them on.<eos> - All right, I'll tell them to leave.<eos> Yes, you fucking well will. Smelly junkies.
Sometimes You Need To Step Outside, Clear Your Head And Remind Yourself Of Who You Are...<eos> And Where You Want To Be.<eos> Aren't You Supposed To Be At Your Mom's Engagement Thing?<eos> Yeah,Well, I Had To Get Out Of There.<eos> It Was Getting A Little Hard To Breathe,You Know?<eos> Those Parties Can Be That Way.<eos> So Are You,Um, Packing Up Your Music?<eos> Nah.<eos> I Just... Need To Find Something New To Write About.<eos> And I Will.
How do you make it work?<eos> Oh, my god!<eos> Hey, come on.<eos> Come on!<eos> I said come!<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> I hope they didn't scare you.<eos> No, no, it's... We love dogs!<eos> Dude, this idea of yours better work.<eos> It will.
Oh, God, squirt.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Squirt, I didn't mean that.<eos> I didn't mean that.<eos> I didn't mean to do that.<eos> Okay?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?<eos> Daddy's really sorry.<eos> I will never-
How'd you go today, anyway?<eos> He blew it.<eos> Shit! (Reggie) Oh, great!<eos> (Flora) Bit of paint, you'll never know.<eos> Nathan doubled up on Jesse's wave, got his best ride disqualified.<eos> So he came in third and they're only giving out two spots this year, so...<eos> You behave yourself over there.<eos> I don't want his mum calling me with no stories.<eos> No. She won't.<eos> She won't.
I won't do it, and I won't...<eos> You see, what I think it is, is- is I think I'm more comfortable with being disappointed.<eos> I think I'm angry with you for trying to take that away.<eos> Mum, I love you, but not now.<eos> Should I take that as a hopeful sign?<eos> If you give me just a little wider smile.<eos> Oh, shut up, Harvey.<eos> So how's this going to work, Mr. Shine?<eos> I have absolutely no idea.<eos> But it will.
Code name for the president.<eos> Biggest bird in the west.<eos> The watchroom is in town hall.<eos> The president will be making a stop outside of jennings and rail first before heading out to the farm for the speech.<eos> And how long's he scheduled to be on main street?<eos> 20 minutes.<eos> Shake some hands on the rope line, meet and greet with the mayor.<eos> Well,that sounds like the time for us to make our move.<eos> You got the password yet?<eos> I will.
You said you'd have no one at the wedding... so we asked JenningsRall to trace your family.<eos> What did you find?<eos> Nothing.<eos> I mean,we found your father's second cousin on a census in indiana, but the area had already been evacuated.<eos> And there was a woman with the same last name in a nearby refugee camp. But she wasn't related.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I really wanted you to have your family at the wedding.<eos> I will.
Transport's waiting outside to take it to Camp Liberty.<eos> The evidence is here?<eos> Yes, sir, boxed up and ready to ship.<eos> I want to see it first.<eos> Sir, it's catalogued and sealed.<eos> Then I'll unseal it.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We got to get off the street or they're going to be on us in no time.<eos> We're not going to make it to Texas like this.<eos> Yes, we will.

What are you, like 16 years old?<eos> Your brother-in-law is a DEA agent.<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> Skyler...<eos> I just... haven't quite been myself lately.<eos> Yeah, no shit.<eos> Thanks for noticing.<eos> I haven't been myself lately, but I love you.<eos> Nothing about that has changed.<eos> Nothing ever will.
Any time, I never sleep.<eos> Just a reminder, grief counseling will be available in my office throughout the week.<eos> - What are they doing?<eos> - They're writing notes.<eos> For Jordan.<eos> She's dead.<eos> Yeah, I remember watching her fall.<eos> Me too.<eos> How will she get the notes?<eos> She won't.
Just a little girl talk.<eos> Oh, Julia, what I neglected to tell you is the woman Christian's having the affair with is me.<eos> She's a dirty, whoring liar.<eos> And she's been in love with me for years.<eos> But are you sleeping with her, Christian?<eos> No.<eos> She's got the gate to hell between her legs.<eos> Why don't you tell your precious Julia where you were last night?<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> I will.
I don't need you to make me feel better.<eos> What I need are some more painkillers.<eos> I was like you, you know.<eos> Had all the boys eating out of my hand, and the only one that I wanted - was the one I couldn't have.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> When you're a mama lion, and you see a baby cub in distress, you instinctively move to help.<eos> You need to be told the truth.<eos> And what might that be?<eos> Sean doesn't love you.<eos> And he never will.
Their wages go further back home.<eos> So it's a win-win situation.<eos> I can't really see that our situation is anything like that.<eos> Well, I'm sure you can persuade him to do other things besides gardening.<eos> - Patrik, we're going home.<eos> - I'm not done yet.<eos> - I won't get paid.<eos> - I'll pay you.<eos> The boy and I have an agreement, I think you should respect that.<eos> - No, Lennart, I won't.
I do.<eos> I know we have to talk about this.<eos> It's just that...<eos> You know, other than you stealing my toast...<eos> - You saw that?<eos> - I saw that.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> We've been living in perfect marital bliss for three weeks.<eos> I don't want to lose what we have here.<eos> Then we won't.
Off school grounds.<eos> Jessica came to me with a personal issue.<eos> I was helping her deal with it.<eos> That's all it is.<eos> And what's the nature of this personal issue?<eos> Look, the kids know I'm a psychiatrist and that what they say to me is confidential.<eos> So they feel safe coming to me with their problems.<eos> But you can't say what you talked about?<eos> I can't.<eos> And as a man of my word, I won't.
And the strollers.<eos> My God, have you seen the ones they have nowadays?<eos> It's like something out of Road Track.<eos> Well, we haven't gotten all of it yet, but we're making headway.<eos> Good.<eos> You're a lucky man.<eos> The bond between a father and a daughter, nothing like it.<eos> Just make sure you cherish every second of it.<eos> Because let me tell you something, it goes by fast.<eos> - I will.
I don't want to be black.<eos> I hate black people!<eos> They're ugly and stupid!<eos> They have fat lips and fat arms!<eos> - Who does she get it from?<eos> - Mother.<eos> As bad as that?<eos> - I won't be like a monkey! - Afraid so.<eos> I won't be like them! I don't want to be black!<eos> I won't, I won't!
He said, "Just be in your car with the money in the Gables ready to go."<eos> He's doing it walking distance from the hit.<eos> Oh, that is nice.<eos> Okay.<eos> This is what we're gonna do.<eos> You will go where he says.<eos> You will give him your cash, and then you will hit the deck when the bullets start flying.<eos> Once Michael's dead, then you can run.<eos> And Drew, if you ever come back, I will find you...<eos> - I won't. - Good.
Music is a bridge between people and me.<eos> I love Hungarians, I love to play for Hungarians.<eos> And Hungarian women, well...<eos> 'The Crab Crawls Backwards' That's the name of the foundation.<eos> As we know, crabs crawl backwards, so when the crab - that is the cancer - moves backwards it actually advances.<eos> I haven't had much luck in my life so if I succeeded, anyone could succeed.<eos> Tibi...<eos> It just occurred to me:<eos> I don't want to die yet.<eos> Then you won't.
My darling, Anna Vasilievna.<eos> You are my happiness;<eos> I can't live without you...<eos> What?<eos> Their times are over!<eos> I'm leaving Russia.<eos> Why?<eos> What tired eyes you have.<eos> I love you.<eos> And I always will.
You're now officially the Deputy Under-Director of Missing Foreign Agents.<eos> So I was here... Now I'm here!<eos> I've moved up at least an eighth of an inch!<eos> Yes.<eos> And since you're so good at finding missing agents, it should be no problem for you to find these ten.<eos> Find them al lby next Friday, and I'll give you another eighth of an inch.<eos> And I'll take that eighth of an inch, sir.<eos> I'll take it like a man.<eos> - I know you will.<eos> - Yeah, I will.
Yeah, beautiful photo.<eos> Hey, where are you right now ?<eos> What's the address ?<eos> 1) Drop off the car 2) spa<eos> Stay there.<eos> I'm coming over.<eos> Reschedule<eos> Curious.<eos> Can someone do me ?<eos> - I will.

Who would want to live there?<eos> Probably some little old lady with 15 cats.<eos> Several members of the Citizen's League have reported strange smells coming from the place.<eos> Smells?<eos> What kind of smells?<eos> Chemical smells, which makes me wonder if someone hasn't set up a drug lab.<eos> A drug lab.<eos> In Middleton?<eos> You need to check on it.<eos> I will.
Looks good to me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Oh, you're such a hottie<eos> Zack, I love you.<eos> Get back.<eos> I believe this just about sums things up, kids.<eos> Yes?<eos> No? Anyone?<eos> Jason and Cindy cannot beat you again in Miami.<eos> - They won't.
And I don't either.<eos> I'm not gonna lie to you.<eos> Your letter killed me.<eos> I mean, if I don't have you or Michael to come home to... I'm not gonna make it.<eos> It's just that any time I hang on to any bit of hope... it gets taken away from me.<eos> So you tell me.<eos> –Do I wait for you?<eos> –I want you to.<eos> But I understand if you can't.<eos> Well, I will.
There's so much more we can try.<eos> I mean, don't you ever feel like just busting out And doing something amazing ever now and then?<eos> I kind of did this morning.<eos> What'd you do?<eos> I sort of levitated.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Only slightly.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Show me how.<eos> I will.
We are not partners.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> You need to understand something.<eos> No gold, no freedom.<eos> You can't drag us back to jail after this.<eos> I lost two men this afternoon.<eos> You despise your men.<eos> If I send a man to die, I need something to show for it.<eos> You'll get your prize.<eos> One way or another, yes, I will.
I'm sorry.<eos> The child is not safe in nascent city.<eos> I will take him to the settlement myself.<eos> No offense, But aren't the banelands a little dangerous?<eos> Maybe i should come with you.<eos> I will be fine.<eos> I'm sure you will be, but i'm not sure he will be.<eos> So... i... am coming with you.<eos> The deviates will not like you.<eos> Oh, nope, they will.
And fuck him -- we're keeping it.<eos> Where did Nancy go?<eos> She ditch us?<eos> She probably went out to buy a "bed skirt."<eos> Or she's out selling drugs.<eos> - Hey, can I hold the money?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm gonna go hide this.<eos> - We'll find it.<eos> - Yeah, we will.
Oh, my lord!<eos> You cut my toast in those little triangles I like.<eos> - Yep. Just for you.<eos> - That looks so good, boy.<eos> Here you go.<eos> You just wait till she comes back, though.<eos> She's not gonna come back, grandma.<eos> Well...<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yep. We will.
UNTIL TODAY, I DID NOT KNOW THAT MY SON WAS ALIVE.<eos> WHY HAVE YOU NOT TOLD AURA THAT YOU'RE HER MOTHER?<eos> IT WOULD MEAN SO MUCH TO HER.<eos> WITH YOUR OWN LIFE IN PERIL, YOU SHOW SUCH CONCERN?<eos> SHE'S MY SISTER.<eos> THEN KNOW THAT, WHEN MING CAST ME OUT FOR BIRTHING A DEVIATE CHILD, HE FORCED ME TO TAKE A BLOOD OATH.<eos> IF I WERE TO EVER SPEAK OF IT TO AURA...<eos> YOU WOULD DIE?<eos> NO.<eos> SHE WILL.
- Me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Just like that other time with the bad nurse who kept telling on you and me?<eos> Remember we told daddy that you hit her?<eos> This is just like that.<eos> And now everything's going to be fine.<eos> You can keep my secret for me, can't you, baby?<eos> And you'll never tell daddy the truth?<eos> Even if he asks?<eos> No, I won't.
Flash.<eos> Flash!<eos> Flash!<eos> Cut it down!<eos> Cut it down now!<eos> Okay. It is dead.<eos> Your plan worked.<eos> You don't have to sound so surprised about that.<eos> We should really be getting out of here.<eos> We will.
Is the baby going to die?<eos> - Are you off to work?<eos> - If you don't need me.<eos> How are the girls?<eos> They're fine.<eos> I explained there's nothing to be afraid of.<eos> Did you get the building permit for the new house?<eos> - I'll do it today.<eos> - Don't forget.<eos> I won't.
Previously on Kyle XY...<eos> Kyle?<eos> Be careful, even in our backyard.<eos> We have bigger problems than Mrs. Bloom.<eos> Jessi starts back at school today.<eos> I sort of levitated.<eos> - Show me how.<eos> - I will.
- Why?<eos> - I'm just not convinced that he has your best interests in mind.<eos> But he's the only one that understands what it's like to be me.<eos> But he doesn't believe in you.<eos> Not the way that I do.<eos> And the others, Latnok, they-- they just don't think you're as good as Kyle.<eos> But they're wrong, okay?<eos> You can be better.<eos> See, they don't see your potential, and neither does Kyle.<eos> Or he won't.
Look at the odds - it's got to be in the canal.<eos> Just give me a few minutes to look over there.<eos> What am I meant to tell Lester?<eos> - Cover for me. -No. Cos you're wasting time.<eos> Ten minutes.<eos> So what's going on?<eos> I know you.<eos> You know that guy that hit you?<eos> What if he comes back?<eos> He won't.
But the thought of it<eos> - makes me feel so afraid, Robert...<eos> - Emma...<eos> I am ashamed that I have spent the whole day wishing this child away,<eos> wishing my husband didn't have such a good heart.<eos> I do feel that.<eos> If I promise to take it upon myself to find her a family round here to take her in.<eos> I only want to knows she's not to be handed over to the authorities.<eos> - And if you can't find a family?<eos> - I will.
You're so happy.<eos> How do you do it?<eos> Is that the question?<eos> Yes.<eos> Robert!<eos> Robert!<eos> There's a noise.<eos> Someone's downstairs.<eos> I want my ma.<eos> You will, kitten.

Drugs or no drugs, you're gone.<eos> All right, Sean, hold up.<eos> We take him to ER and we say we found him.<eos> It makes no difference.<eos> It still ties him to us.<eos> And when he wakes up and starts bitching to anybody who will listen, it's gonna look pretty fucking dismal for us.<eos> We dump him outside.<eos> There's no connection.<eos> And what if nobody finds him?<eos> - No, they will.
Okay.<eos> Morgan, I'm so sorry that I uninvited you to Thanksgiving. Please, please forgive me.<eos> Forgive you?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> Yes, I understand. I completely understand. You've been so stressed.<eos> And with our new boss at work, and this Chuck and Jill thing is like:<eos> - What Chuck and Jill thing?<eos> - Hmm? Jill thing? I didn't say...<eos> - You tell me everything that you know.<eos> - Mm-hm, absolutely, I will.
She doesn't believe a word you're saying.<eos> She knows exactly what you did back there, Why didn't take down stephen canfield When you had the chance.<eos> Nobody's talking to you.<eos> Claire finally sees you for what you are-a user.<eos> Isn't that right, claire? You used her to try to find that poor man.<eos> Then you used him to try to kill me<eos> Because to you...<eos> I'm nothing but a monster.<eos> He doesn't see our humanity, claire.<eos> He never will.
Bastards.<eos> Call me once the doctor's been. All right.<eos> 7,000 euros wasted. Bravo. You're like him.<eos> You just want to get your money back.<eos> You lost him money with the Russians.<eos> He wants it back. It's normal.<eos> I'm talking about you.<eos> You'll take what you put in and I'll never see you again.<eos> I'll come to Gramsh.<eos> No, you won't.
I may have forsaken the throne to be with you<eos> But I cannot abandon my people and allow them to suffer<eos> Lanquan, wait for my return<eos> Hold on!<eos> How's your wound?<eos> I'll be fine<eos> It took me only three days to cure you the last time<eos> Your country needs you now.<eos> Wait for me<eos> I will...
All she wants is to know you.<eos> And I think you're lucky to have this opportunity to know her.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll come.<eos> This afternoon.<eos> Wait, my address.<eos> I know where you live.<eos> Right.<eos> Tell Jessi... I'm looking forward to meeting her.<eos> I will.
-you're kidding<eos> -Awesome!<eos> -And God exists<eos> -Gotta go<eos> Ciao.<eos> Ciao.<eos> Easy with the meds mum I'm just going to England<eos> That's for bellyaches.<eos> Will you remember ?<eos> I will
Let me tell you where you were, Getting laid by lancu!<eos> Not even wearing underwear.<eos> Dirty old man!<eos> Shut up!<eos> Don't touch me or I'll set you on fire!<eos> Well, I'm off to the store to check they're out of oil.<eos> If not, I'll make you drink some!<eos> Sure! You're going to the bar!<eos> Shut up, woman!<eos> No, I won't!
Why are you doing this?<eos> The mystery of it has got the better of me, I'm afraid.<eos> Well, I have an idea how I might discover more about the panel.<eos> I doubt the panel will give up its secrets.<eos> The only way to unravel this is to investigate Wigmore.<eos> You are a little too sure of yourself.<eos> One only has to look at the embroidery to see IT holds the key to this mystery, so I shall have the Misses Pratt examine it.<eos> Why don't I find out about Wigmore, and you pursue the meaning of the panel?<eos> Then we will see.<eos> We will.
What is so insane about asking my brother, who also happens to be a doctor, to be my health care proxy?<eos> Nothing, except the last two people your brother did that for happened to die.<eos> Valerie Masters refused the heart.<eos> You said so yourself.<eos> She made a decision.<eos> Yeah, but dad didn't.<eos> Look, I-I know my limits.<eos> Ten years ago, I made a bad decision,<eos> - and I'm not doing it again.<eos> - You won't.
And, in my opinion, right now, America could use a lot more people like Molly.<eos> The whole world could.<eos> The clock is ticking.<eos> Judge Tate's decision is imminent.<eos> My recommendation would be to settle this now.<eos> Get out while you can.<eos> We don't want out.<eos> Judge Tate is not gonna insert herself into a school matter.<eos> Consider Mr. Michael's testimony.<eos> Judge Tate certainly will.
Every day, I think of someone else.<eos> All dead.<eos> - Maybe she went away for Christmas.<eos> I'll go out tomorrow, I'll walk into town.<eos> There's got to be work.<eos> Everyone needs secretaries.<eos> Soon as I'm earning, we'll get a proper place.<eos> just you wait, Mum.<eos> What if it never gets better?<eos> Course it will.
No, no.<eos> We're friends. That's all.<eos> I mean, we're not even the same species. There's probably laws against it.<eos> And what's it like, the travelling?<eos> Never a dull moment.<eos> Can be terrifying, brilliant and funny... sometimes all at the same time.<eos> I've seen some amazing things though.<eos> Whole new worlds.<eos> Oh, I'd love to see new worlds.<eos> You will.
You talk all the time, but you don't say anything.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm just...<eos> When I look at her now I can see them.<eos> The hole they left.<eos> All the pain that filled it.<eos> I just don't know if I can face that every day.<eos> It won't stay like that.<eos> She'll help you.<eos> We both will.
- Say what?<eos> - I screwed up.<eos> You can say it, probie.<eos> It was not your fault.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Sure, be right down, boss.<eos> Abby's lab.<eos> I've barely had a chance to finish unpacking this stuff, let alone processing it.<eos> I don't have anything for you.<eos> - You will.

-Well, like her ex-husband.<eos> Smart, funny, sensitive, good-looking.<eos> -And that's not me?<eos> -No, no. You can be funny.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> But if she did agree to go out with me...<eos> -... you'dbeokaywiththat ?<eos> -But she won't.<eos> -But if she did? She might.<eos> -She won't. She won't.
He will, Gramps.<eos> There's something he needs me to do.<eos> I just don't know what.<eos> Well, the whole place is covered, all of London, they're saying.<eos> The whole world.<eos> It's the scale of it, Donna. I mean, how can one man stop all that?<eos> Trust me.<eos> He can do it.<eos> Yeah, well, if he doesn't, you tell him he'll have to answer to me.<eos> I will.
You're going to be okay, Austin.<eos> Austin will be a bit confused.<eos> He's been told that you don't want him. And he believes that woman who took him rescued him.<eos> She used words to gain his trust and love.<eos> He never ran away because she convinced him there was no place to run to.<eos> It'll probably take awhile for him to show affection and he'll want to know why you never came to get him.<eos> Children believe their parents can do anything.<eos> So, saying you couldn't find him or you tried everything, just may not be enough.<eos> Just be patient, Ms. Tanner.<eos> I will.
Thank you for showing me this.<eos> I wanted you to understand.<eos> I do. Finally.<eos> Now I can go.<eos> I wish you didn't have to.<eos> Sara. This is a good thing.<eos> You made me mortal.<eos> Only to lose you.<eos> We should have had more time.<eos> We will.
You see there,christine?<eos> He found a girl.<eos> There's a lid for every pot.<eos> Even a pot in a cheap little suit.<eos> I'm on testosterone right now,and I could kill you.<eos> Marly!<eos> chriE. Stin.<eos> I've taken their crap for three years,richard. For three years.<eos> You didn't stop taking that cream.<eos> No,and I never will.
if I did something wrong...<eos> Can we not talk about this now?<eos> If you tell me what's wrong, we can figure it out together.<eos> Figure out what?<eos> That I'm a freak?<eos> Julian, you're not a freak.<eos> Please, Julian, we've got to talk about this.<eos> This is totally normal, but we can't make it better if you run away from me.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> No, you won't.
The place looks wonderful.<eos> Good. Thank you.<eos> You made it. Mwah.<eos> Well, just barely.<eos> Apparently, there was a confusion Over what track number.<eos> Well, the important thing is that you're here.<eos> Well, that's one theory.<eos> Can i get you a scotch, joyce?<eos> Are you having one? I'm having two.<eos> Well, then i will as well.
Did nothing wrong.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> It's ok. It's ok.<eos> I didn't do anything wrong.<eos> It's ok.<eos> I got to do this.<eos> You have to tell him that i didn't do anything with those other guys.<eos> I never did. I never did.<eos> I will.
What exactly is that pile of ashes?<eos> It turned out to be the victim's intestines.<eos> The abdomen had been slashed opened.<eos> And with a body so badly burned, intestines reduced to ashes, how did you identify the remains as those of deputy director kirby?<eos> I've got nothing to say.<eos> You're under oath as a material witness, ms. Montenegro.<eos> I swore to tell the truth, and the truth is that I am not saying anything.<eos> judge haddoes, could you...<eos> - The witness will answer.<eos> - No, the witness will not.
That so?<eos> I know ain't no pea shooter gonna save you.<eos> What makes you so sure?<eos> Because that's the job, kid.<eos> Even if you manage to scrape out of this one there's just gonna be something else down the road.<eos> Folks like us there ain't no happy ending.<eos> We all got it coming.<eos> Well, ain't you a bucket of sunshine.<eos> I'm what you've got to look forward to if you survive.<eos> Which you won't.
I got no idea.<eos> Look at that, Lafayette. Theme shelves.<eos> Oh, that's pretty, baby.<eos> Would you work for me tonight?<eos> No, ma'am, no, sir, I don't know any Cindy.<eos> But I can recommend the fried apple pie, the frozen Hawaiian pie, the chocolate pecan praline pie, the chess pie, the seven-layer Jell-O pie...<eos> They'll have the peanut butter pie and the Spunky Hollow honey pineapple pie,<eos> - please, Harley?<eos> - Gotcha, Buster.<eos> We will?
A procedure for the prenatal diagnosis of genetic disorders in which small samples of placenta are obtained for chromosomal DNA analysis.<eos> It does require your permission at this early stage.<eos> Well, I think we should do it.<eos> I mean, with the hyperbaric treatment - and Nina's pregnancy. - Good.<eos> I'll get it arranged right away.<eos> Thanks, Dr. Bruen.<eos> What if they find something wrong?<eos> They won't.<eos> - I wanna have our baby.<eos> - And you will.
Well,you got the right idea.<eos> Still... I have to convince him.<eos> Can anyone say... tequila?<eos> Tequila.<eos> Right.<eos> That's it for me.<eos> Thanks for the drinks.<eos> Thanks for your help.<eos> Think about what I told ya.<eos> I will.
Graiman.<eos> But the specifications you presented to dr.<eos> Landafly were completely inaccurate.<eos> Absolutely correct, kitt.<eos> That means you do not trust her.<eos> Yet you plan to meet her at her hotel.<eos> Correct again.<eos> I do not understand.<eos> One day, kitt.<eos> One day you will.
I've got these giant clown feet that aren't always under my control.<eos> Giant feet.<eos> How about let my flip flop make it up to yours.<eos> - How did you... do that?<eos> - It's my secret weapon.<eos> Double-fisting tonight, huh?<eos> Just single-fisting.<eos> I mean, I'm single. Just an FYI.<eos> I hope to see you around.<eos> You will.
-Glad you approve.<eos> Relax, man. Relax.<eos> I'm not like Cruz.<eos> I don't like to micromanage.<eos> I like to stay focused on the bigger picture.<eos> Besides, you're the politician.<eos> You decide how to run your campaign.<eos> Hire who you want, target the areas you want focus on the issues you want.<eos> Just don't lose.<eos> I won't.
And I always know where you're coming from.<eos> Look, I'm appealing to your good judgment. Even if I know I will forever be on the wrong end of it.<eos> You got that right.<eos> Vic is gonna land you, me and him in jail for the rest of our lives if he keeps going in this direction.<eos> Well, he's doing what it takes to protect his family.<eos> That's only one part of the equation.<eos> The other math goes like this.<eos> Vic takes down someone who's done worse deeds than him it balances accounts for Terry. In that big old box of sins God keeps on all of us.<eos> I don't believe in God.<eos> Oh, you will.
I'm trying.<eos> But the more I sit here, the more I wanna stand up.<eos> My legs are on fire.<eos> - It's the adrenaline.<eos> - I know it's the adrenaline.<eos> I just have to get up.<eos> They're on fire.<eos> They're full of ants.<eos> If you move. You will die.<eos> We all will.
But I understand more than you think.<eos> So you understand that I'm gonna keep seeing Riley, even if everyone thinks it's a bad idea.<eos> I understand that it's a bad idea.<eos> And I understand that being John Connor can be lonely.<eos> Oh, yeah?<eos> How do you understand that?<eos> You and I talk about it a lot.<eos> We do?<eos> We do.<eos> We will.
We caught four of them?<eos> Right, but we couldn't find Fischer.<eos> They kept him hidden.<eos> Too valuable.<eos> You really don't remember?<eos> Listen, if he is who you say he is, then he deserves whatever is gonna happen to him in that room, but not until he tells us who he is and what he's doing here.<eos> Do you understand?<eos> - He is who I say he is.<eos> - I want to hear him say it.<eos> He will.
Shut up!<eos> Help me!<eos> Please, someone!<eos> Is everything okay?<eos> Go away!<eos> Sorry, sorry.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Martha, come back here!<eos> Martha, you don't know what you're doing.<eos> I won't!
So, what?<eos> I don't have clearance to know background on a case I'm investigating?<eos> Agent Dunham, if I'm not always completely transparent with you there's a reason.<eos> This little task force you and I call our day job now it sometimes requires some, shall we say, bureaucratic maneuvering to keep it alive and free from meddling.<eos> Which means sometimes I don't tell you everything, for your own protection.<eos> With all due respect, that's not good enough.<eos> Now, I've been trained for a lot:<eos> Hostage crises, terror campaigns suicide bombers, chemical attacks but the things I've seen since I started working for you...<eos> If I'm gonna do this job, I need to know what it is I'm dealing with.<eos> And you will.
At least, I don't think.<eos> Think? I've been drinking a lot.<eos> Blacking out.<eos> I just want... I just want the pictures in my head to stop.<eos> Okay.<eos> Why don't you have a seat?<eos> Okay?<eos> So, what do you think about?<eos> If I tell you, you'll hate me.<eos> Everybody will.
I'm not going there.<eos> Don't go there.<eos> Hey, now, is there some history here?<eos> Some skeletons in the closet I should know about?<eos> Bipolar disorder runs in families.<eos> If we could show the court that Kathleen is predisposed to BPD, then the judge might consider alternative sentencing.<eos> Right. Psychiatric treatment instead of jail.<eos> Yes.<eos> But it will only happen if Kathleen admits she's sick.<eos> She won't.

Well, I was right.<eos> - They're all in their hibernation pods.<eos> - Where?<eos> There's several large chambers in the aft section of the hive.<eos> The weird thing is, though, if I'm reading this right, they haven't given themselves a wake-up call.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> - Well, the normal operating procedure would be to leave a few crew members awake so that they could monitor the pods and bring the others out when it's time, but since they all went in,<eos> I would assume there'd be some kind of an automatic or timed shut-down protocol, but I can't find one.<eos> So if we do not wake them...<eos> Then they never will.
I've been studying the SG-1 report.<eos> This device connects beyond merely psychological.<eos> There's also a physiological connection, as well.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> It means, should Neeva's body be killed, Jennifer's mind would perish along with her.<eos> And we'll be stuck with this other woman in Keller's body?<eos> - We need to get moving.<eos> - Agreed.<eos> Do we know which planet this device is on?<eos> We will.
Be official in two weeks.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> You got everything you wanted.<eos> Not everything.<eos> "Kingdom Afar" ?<eos> You want me to read this to you ?<eos> Just skip to the part where the prince and the princess live happily ever after.<eos> Dean...<eos> So ?<eos> Will you ?
That's right. You can't.<eos> But, um...<eos> I lost my older sister in a car crash.<eos> And it was really hard on our family because she was the responsible one. She was the one that my mother always counted on to watch over us.<eos> And when she died, my mother wouldn't let the police in.<eos> If she didn't let them in, then my sister wasn't really dead.<eos> This man is a monster, and we can catch him. But we need your daughter's help.<eos> - If you accuse her of anything...<eos> - Ma'am- i will be on the phone so fast...<eos> - Ma'am, ma'am, we won't.
You can help your brother forgive himself.<eos> All I ever wanted to do was be with him.<eos> No matter what he did.<eos> She always looked up to you.<eos> She wanted to be with you.<eos> But I was so mean to you.<eos> And you were just a kid.<eos> You were a kid, too.<eos> Will you tell him I love him and forgive him?<eos> I will.
She said that she would protect us.<eos> She promised my dad that she would.<eos> Parents are supposed to protect their kids.<eos> Yes, they are.<eos> Can I see my brother now?<eos> Sure.<eos> I know you weren't thinking right when you did what you did.<eos> Be good to Aunt Jo.<eos> Don't leave your clothes everywhere and be respectful, okay?<eos> I will.
Somebody's gonna be looking for him.<eos> Oh, god, isaac, did you get my husband mixed up with these people?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> I saved your damn life.<eos> That's the only thing you have to know.<eos> Shut up.<eos> Listen... i'll go to the police and i'll tell them that i killed him.<eos> I'll say he broke into the house while you were out.<eos> - it won't work.<eos> - yes, it will.
We searched everywhere.<eos> There's still no body.<eos> We got to keep looking, Eric.<eos> I'm with you, H, what do you want to do?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> You and me?<eos> You and me, Eric.<eos> This never ends, does it?<eos> And it never will.
That was great.<eos> She just moved like 250 pounds.<eos> I was being supportive.<eos> Hey, remember what you saw.<eos> Girl just saved your life.<eos> You don't have to close tonight.<eos> I can do it.<eos> You look tired.<eos> No, it's... it's my turn.<eos> I'll...
Look, I'm sorry.<eos> I'll find another place.<eos> Can I at least wait until it's dark?<eos> Oh, Jesus!<eos> I got to go to county and talk to Jax.<eos> Is my car still out back or did you move that, too?<eos> It's still there.<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> To Jax.<eos> I won't.
And that can't be undone.<eos> Some things just can't be undone.<eos> Well, will you tie my tubes?<eos> Because if so, we thought maybe you could do it today.<eos> We can't...<eos> We can't take another day of this.<eos> Another night.<eos> We didn't sleep.<eos> We just want everything back the way it was.<eos> So will you?

Bet she's staying at the same hotel.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If I could make her see me as a human, she'll have mercy on our case...<eos> She won't see you as human.<eos> You reveal yourself to be the animal you are.<eos> - Give me some credit, will you?<eos> - I'm going up.<eos> - Got too much to go over.<eos> Denny, don't say anything to that woman that she can use against us tomorrow.<eos> I won't.
- Well, you must be happy, Mom.<eos> Why on Earth would I be happy?<eos> Everybody's here, together, for Thanksgiving, just the way you wanted it.<eos> Tommy, that's not fair.<eos> Well, then stop treating this like one of your dinner parties.<eos> I mean, this isn't another Walker family get-together.<eos> - Tommy, that's not what we're doing.<eos> - Just enjoy your dinner.<eos> I hope this works.<eos> It will.
Eva's mom'sgonna be here soon,and I gotta get readyfor a job interview.<eos> You're going back to work?<eos> Oh,if I get this job.<eos> I don't have a choice,honey.<eos> I gotta work.<eos> But this job would be greatbecause I would be ableto work from home so you'd seea lot more of methan when I was workingat ojai.<eos> Promise?<eos> 'Cause you said you'dhelp me with my diorama,<eos> -but it's not finishe<eos> -I will,honey.
- I sure do.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What's going on here? Are you married, Dr. Cominis?<eos> No, but I just moved in with someone.<eos> Well, over time you'll learn that there's a balance of power in relationships.<eos> And if your beloved ever pulls a nasty trick on you, like, say, drugging you into a stupor, then the balance of power shifts to you.<eos> And then you can demand they prove their love by, say, undergoing surgery.<eos> - Do you understand?<eos> - Not really.<eos> You will.
If You're Ready.<eos> Dear?<eos> Mom, There's One More Thing I Have To Tell You.<eos> Could--Could You Give Us Another Moment, Please?<eos> Thank You.<eos> When I Was Clearing Out My Office,<eos> I Accidentally Opened Up A Piece Of Daniel's Mail.<eos> Well, Darling, Given What We're Dealing With Here,<eos> I Think Daniel's Going To Overlook That One.<eos> No, He Won't.
All right?<eos> Let's go.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> Don't call it a comeback, baby.<eos> Don't do that.<eos> How was breakfast?<eos> - So damn good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Hey, will you remind Quentin that he's got a tutoring session after practice today?<eos> - Yeah, I will.
Wake up, donkeys.<eos> The Internet is where it's at, and I'm going to be an Internet sensation.<eos> You're totally right.<eos> If you don't mind, I'm going to come with you.<eos> Maybe I can throw Green Man into a couple of your videos, you know, and work it out. That'll get a lot of hits.<eos> You can help me out, Charlie, but we're not going to put Green<eos> - Man into anything.<eos> - Well, we'll see about that.<eos> - We'll see about that.<eos> - Well, we will.
No, I can't.<eos> Midnight?<eos> Yeah, what's the matter?<eos> Past your bedtime?<eos> Yes!<eos> ( laughing ) Nah.<eos> I just... I just had this party I was supposed to go to, but... you know, I guess I can skip that.<eos> All right, cool.<eos> We'll see you there.<eos> Not at midnight you won't.
About time.<eos> You sure you're okay?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, it was the right thing.<eos> You know, i, uh... I-i'm--i'm sorry.<eos> I cannot believe that Nate Archibald is a gigolo.<eos> You cannot tell anyone, remember?<eos> Hey, who would I tell?<eos> Who would I tell except everyone I've ever met?<eos> I won't.
I mean, they may not care about school right now, but I want them to have choices later on in their lives, and I feel like it's my job to make sure that happens.<eos> I know it sounds stupid.<eos> No, it does not sound stupid.<eos> It sounds like you.<eos> Look, this family may not know how lucky they are to have you, but I do.<eos> Oh, there's my cab.<eos> All right.<eos> Ok.<eos> And I promise to keep writing while I'm down here. I won't spend all my down time getting a tan. Good.<eos> I will.
I can't do this today.<eos> Clark, what are you talking about?<eos> You've given lex, like, 100 second chances.<eos> And if he's out there alive, he hasn't made a move for months.<eos> This can wait 24 hours.<eos> - Chloe can't.<eos> - The wedding?<eos> Is that the real reason you don't want to go after lex, Or is that just an excuse?<eos> Chloe's gonna understand.<eos> No, she won't.
And millicent is moving to be with mouth, And peyton with lucas and they're all moving forward.<eos> And it's like I am stuck here, standing still, and<eos> Brooke, you're 22 years old and the founder Of a multi-million-dollar corporation.<eos> I'd hardly call that standing still.<eos> But it's gone.<eos> You'll do something else.<eos> You're intelligent, you're creative.<eos> You'll figure it out.<eos> Right. but what if I don't figure it out?<eos> You will.
- Yeah.<eos> Well, well. The boozy reporter finally cracks the case.<eos> Well done.<eos> I'll tell you what.<eos> I'm a charitable guy.<eos> You beg for your life, and just maybe I'll set you free.<eos> No.<eos> I'm not crawling anymore.<eos> Not even for you.<eos> And pretty soon, no one else will either.
- I don't know.<eos> Look, I have to focus.<eos> - We're ready for you, Vince. - Okay.<eos> - And these guys...<eos> - Yeah yeah yeah, we know.<eos> We're persona non grata.<eos> - Send our regards to V.V.<eos> - Sorry. - We'll be in the trailer.<eos> - All right. - Wish we could see it, bro.<eos> - You will on the big screen.
You dared to say, 'To hell with the Revolution'.<eos> You're an enemy of the Revolution, the Revolution for which many comrades have given their lives.<eos> I'm warning you, we'll use extreme measures against you.<eos> Your life is at stake here.<eos> It's the poor people's urine and stool samples...<eos> - Comrade Doctor!<eos> We're not here to argue over who's more concerned for the people.<eos> The issue is whether you will retract your statement or not. That's it.<eos> I will not.<eos> You will not?
Think, maybe even before you pull out the fuck the pants next time.<eos> Do you like chicken?<eos> Or do you want another sausage?<eos> Hurry.<eos> Turn off those business!<eos> You can Finally here more 'late.<eos> And not 'what for you signed, right?<eos> I do not Andro 'now.<eos> If you're worried that I you think that the six date a raised legs when I was more 'need you... well, I do not think '.<eos> Si ', it will.
Bye, Teacher.<eos> When Master comes out of seclusion, please say bye for me.<eos> I will, go now.<eos> Teacher, why didn't he come?<eos> Who?<eos> Who is he?<eos> Oh he!<eos> Not coming!<eos> He'll come...<eos> He won't...
Everyone is talking about how you behaved with nothing but class and dignity. L...<eos> I don't think that's what they're saying.<eos> Oh, they are.<eos> I can hear them. - Yeah?<eos> - Listen.<eos> I want one more little favor<eos> - from you and you're done.<eos> - One more... no.<eos> - No, it's gotta stop.<eos> - No, it will, right after this.
For that I have been.<eos> My love began on the day you married Harry Fanshawe.<eos> I did not know I had a heart until that hour.<eos> You filled it with... unknown creatures,<eos> whose names were joy and hope.<eos> Both sharper blades than any that had cut me before.<eos> I have something of yours.<eos> I've kept it on me every day.<eos> Then do not part with it now.<eos> As I will not with you.
i'm sorry.<eos> Did our best.<eos> Um, I know how y canavoid writing that check.<eos> You ready for your close-up? Honestly?<eos> I'm so nervous, I'm starting to wonder why I fought so hard for this.<eos> Just preach it like you did in court.<eos> You'll be fine.<eos> they came for a sermon, reverend.<eos> I just thought... everybody'd come around?<eos> - They will.
- I want the surgery today.<eos> Well, there are no other clinical trials out there.<eos> No one else has any answers.<eos> - Dr. Shepherd has worked hard on this.<eos> - Meredith.<eos> We're not letting you have surgery because you want to die with Jeremy.<eos> If I go home, I die.<eos> I die in a few weeks, a few days.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> Mom, you won't.
Hey, look, there's two more!<eos> Mom?<eos> Say, CC.<eos> Did you say anything to Miss Littleton tonight that might compromise your service record?<eos> - No.<eos> - She's a reporter, Carter.<eos> No, nothing she'd repeat.<eos> - Let me buy you a drink.<eos> - I don't drink.<eos> You will.
Abe?<eos> Red, I'm so sorry, but they're linked.<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Red.<eos> - Liz.<eos> Red, behind you.<eos> You may have mused in the past, "Am I mortal?"<eos> You are now.<eos> Abraham, many people have died for this crown.<eos> He will, too.
Say you want me.<eos> I'm Dale.<eos> Yes, but say it like Gabrielle would say it.<eos> Go on, say it.<eos> Yes?<eos> - I want you.<eos> Do you know where she is?<eos> No. Europe, I think.<eos> What if she comes back?<eos> She won't.
let's go kill Castle in his miserable hole.<eos> not yet.<eos> We're gonna have ourselves a little bit of fun with this.<eos> Next time he has to face us and a fucking army.<eos> Where do we get the army from?<eos> bro.<eos> We recruit in troubled neighborhoods.<eos> Offer a hundred grand towards a college education they'll never get and promise nobody ever has to go to Iraq.<eos> Just as long as I get to kill Castle.<eos> you will.
I'm blessed.<eos> Sometimes it's like the right hand of God is sitting on my shoulder.<eos> I'm not racing tomorrow.<eos> Go fuck yourself.<eos> Wait.<eos> Take his shackles off.<eos> Please excuse us, Mr. Ulrich.<eos> And take Mr. James with you.<eos> Do you recognize these people?<eos> Because your daughter will.
Kainan<eos> There's another one!<eos> Kainan!<eos> everyone's leaving.<eos> Eric, it's not safe here anymore.<eos> Everyone's going to the boats.<eos> You need to go, too.<eos> But, I want to stay here with you.<eos> You'll come back soon.<eos> Everyone will.
Dad, is he okay?<eos> Thank you.<eos> You don't have to thank me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> The Joker won.<eos> Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for, undone.<eos> Whatever chance you got is of fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation.<eos> We bet it all on him.<eos> People will lose hope.<eos> They won't.
It's a name.<eos> A target.<eos> Where do the names come from?<eos> Come out of a necessity, Wesley.<eos> A necessity to maintain balance in the world.<eos> They are orders that must be executed, entrusted to us so that we might forge stability out of chaos.<eos> This one is yours.<eos> I don't...<eos> Look, I thought you brought me here to kill Cross.<eos> You will. In time.
Angel Ahjusshi!<eos> Angel Ahjusshi is here again.<eos> Mother...<eos> Well done.<eos> Being able to save mother, you are incredible, Lee Dong Wook.<eos> But, Hyung. Will everything be alright for you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Don't worry about me and study hard.<eos> Do not forget your promise.<eos> I won't, Hyung.
And she stolemy damn pen.<eos> Okay, it's been saidl don't always play well with others.<eos> Maybe even at times I projecta prickly exterior.<eos> But in response to that, and in my defense...<eos> I have something to say.<eos> Come in.<eos> No, I stillhave work to do.<eos> And we both knowwhat'll happen if I come in.<eos> Well, but it's, like, 112 out there.<eos> This'll justtake a minute.
Sweetheart, what they said to you was trash, wasn't it?<eos> And what do you do with trash?<eos> - You throw it away.<eos> That's right.<eos> You throw it away for good.<eos> Okay, dry your tears and go on to class.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> Oh, I'm just sorry to take over, but I know these children pretty well.<eos> I understand.<eos> - You will soon enough.
Get them to send some marines out here. I've been trying.<eos> I can't get through.<eos> Jack, go into my room.<eos> You'll find what you need in a locker under my sink.<eos> The key's on top of the cupboard.<eos> How far out are you?<eos> Maybe five minutes.<eos> Jack, don't let them take my kids.<eos> Don't let them take the children.<eos> Carl, I won't. Everybody!
Thank you.<eos> Good to see you.<eos> Good morning. - Thank you so much.<eos> You look beautiful, Madame President.<eos> Thank you, Samantha.<eos> Father.<eos> It's nice to see you on time for once. Mm-hmm.<eos> How are you holding up?<eos> It still doesn't feel quite real.<eos> It will soon enough.
Wanted to.<eos> Felt good.<eos> - Let me out!<eos> No!<eos> - You got her? I lost two babies to back alley doctors.<eos> No choice.<eos> Never had the chance to fight for them.<eos> You do.<eos> Don't stop.<eos> I won't.
- And I'm changing all the names and some of the facts, but I just decided that right now.<eos> - And then we'll see how smart you are.<eos> - I like it. It's like a love story/mystery.<eos> - Great.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> You ready?<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> - Take your time.<eos> - I will.
I mean, why do you wanna marry me?<eos> Besides some bourgeois desire to fulfill an ideal that society embeds in us from an early age to promote a consumer capitalist agenda?<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> - You should've got on your knee!<eos> - Just shut up!<eos> Here.<eos> I wanna marry you because you're the first person that I want to look at when I wake up in the morning and the only one I wanna kiss goodnight.<eos> Because the first time that I saw these hands, I couldn't imagine not being able to hold them.<eos> But mainly, when you love someone as much as I love you getting married is the only thing left to do.<eos> So will you...
But that hair it's like a co-op for parakeets.<eos> You know, I pride myself on being honest with everybody.<eos> But there's somebody I've been lying to for a very long time:<eos> Myself.<eos> Because the truth is... Is scary.<eos> And 10 years ago, I got in bed with the wrong girl.<eos> She turned out to be the right one.<eos> I love you, Hannah.<eos> I always have.<eos> And I always will.
I'm not working here anymore.<eos> - You lost yourjob?<eos> - Yes. That happens here.<eos> We'll miss you.<eos> Me too.<eos> If you still plan to come to France,<eos> I'll leave my number.<eos> That's nice. Thanks.<eos> Call me if you come.<eos> I will.
- Is your last name Gallo?<eos> - God forbid. The French have invited... certain American vintners... to compete in a tasting in Paris.<eos> It's Barrett. I am technically not French.<eos> You think you can beat the French?<eos> We don't know, but we, uh- we certainly want a chance to try.<eos> The only problem is we can't get our wine there without your help.<eos> See, I'm only allowed to carry on one bottle of wine, and I brought twenty-f- uh, 26 bottles of wine back to Paris without them being shaken or bumped around.<eos> Will anybody carry a bottle for me?<eos> I'll take one.<eos> And so will my husband.
Bobby.<eos> Bobby.<eos> Oh, my God! Bobby!<eos> - Yeah, come on.<eos> Here. You okay? - Donna, get in the car.<eos> Please. - I'm going with her.<eos> - Okay, get in the car.<eos> Can he come with me?<eos> - Don't leave me. Don't leave me.<eos> - I won't.
- I'll ask.<eos> - That'd be kind.<eos> I can't guarantee anything, mind.<eos> Put it down.<eos> Turn.<eos> Have you lost an arm or what?<eos> Turn.<eos> Put it down.<eos> - It'll never fit.<eos> - Yes, it will.
And now you do.<eos> Mr. Torrelson I'm sorry.<eos> I am so very sorry.<eos> I'm glad I was there.<eos> Me too.<eos> Maybe today's the day you're gonna see those ponies.<eos> - The bankers? - Hmm.<eos> Okay, honestly, they don't come this far down the island, ever.<eos> - But thank you. - You'll see.<eos> One day they will.
Maybe they're preparing for something.<eos> Like a sacrifice.<eos> It has something to do with the ruins.<eos> Now that we're here, they won't let us leave.<eos> So, what do we do, just wait for someone to find us?<eos> Who?<eos> The Greeks.<eos> Dimitri left them a copy of the map before we left.<eos> Yeah, and what if they decide not to come, Jeff?<eos> Then somebody else will.
So... using a reed as a substitute phallus... she performed the wedding rite with Osiris... and brought forth a powerful son...<eos> It's a non-carnal union.<eos> A virgin birth. Exactly.<eos> Only four magnificent times... has this rite been performed...<eos> Joshua with the Magdalene, Abelard with Heloise... these are the two you know already.<eos> Who were the others?<eos> On Friday, when you return... alone, we shall begin your initiation.<eos> I'm not sure I can afford to come back.<eos> Don't worry, Symonds.<eos> This will...
Denny, this is crazy.<eos> That's it exactly.<eos> That's our defense— temporary insanity.<eos> You can't plead your insanity.<eos> You are nuts.<eos> That's the beauty.<eos> –The arraignment is when?<eos> –10:00.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> No, you won't.
–Let me finish!<eos> Who are you looking to protect?<eos> My investigators have seen you with Ms Strickland.<eos> Hey, you want to go after me, sweetheart?<eos> Take your shot.<eos> I will go after you if you have broken the law.<eos> Your honor, this law is about imposing a morality.<eos> What's more, it doesn't work.<eos> Prostitution exists.<eos> It always will.
What's so funny?<eos> That everyone thinks that Scylla's just the Company's little black book.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> I understand from Lincoln your mom had a hamartoma in her right frontal lobe.<eos> That's right.<eos> When a tumor like that gets to be problematic it's gonna come with a lot of symptoms.<eos> Loss of short-term memory problems with your depth perception, with your motor skills.<eos> - Lf you had that, you'd let me know?<eos> - Yes, but I haven't.<eos> And I won't.
- that's impressive.<eos> - Thank you, Alex.<eos> Cristina?<eos> I got to practice stuff on him...<eos> central lines and I.V.S... it was good practice.<eos> You were mean and stubborn and just... a bastard.<eos> You were.<eos> But you were a bastard who knew what you wanted.<eos> And you stuck to your guns and proved that if you want something badly enough, if you're... determined enough and patient enough, eventually it will happen.<eos> It will.
I swear.<eos> I slept with George.<eos> I'm a terrible person.<eos> Which is why I'm gonna let her get one good punch in.<eos> Maybe two, I deserve it.<eos> No, one.<eos> Then you pull her off me.<eos> You slept with O'Malley?<eos> You said you wouldn't say anything.<eos> I won't.
You... you chickened out.<eos> When I... when I was leaving, when I was... when I asked you to give me a reason to stay, you chickened out, which I get.<eos> I get that.<eos> It was a lot.<eos> I came back for you, which basically... makes me a beggar.<eos> I'm a beggar for Halloween.<eos> And now you're mocking me.<eos> I'm not mocking you.<eos> We need... to talk.<eos> We will.
- OK, so maybe I didn't go to a meeting.<eos> Daniel, what are you doing?<eos> You have a problem.<eos> You slept with an underaged model.<eos> Yeah, who turned out not to be underage.<eos> Why are you so "glass half empty"?<eos> No, the glass is crushed into a million little pieces all over the floor.<eos> I'm just waiting for you to step on it.<eos> You got lucky.<eos> Next time, you won't.
Believe me.<eos> I've been trying to figure out how to do that all night.<eos> - You haven't booked the suspect yet?<eos> - No. He's still in isolation.<eos> You know what, Chief?<eos> You have a lot to do still, what with having to look after these other two missing girls.<eos> Why don't I take Roger off your hands? Have Robbery /Homicide book him.<eos> I don't see how that's gonna help me.<eos> Oh, it will.<eos> It will.
- I don't know. You make me nervous.<eos> I make you nervous?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You're scary.<eos> You're this scary lady drug dealer with thugs.<eos> That's me.<eos> Go get the money.<eos> Leave the bag. Go get the money. Now.<eos> I'll be right back. That's right.<eos> You will.
Building foundations for tomorrow.<eos> Technology.<eos> Science.<eos> Art.<eos> Only one company integrates all three for the benefit of mankind.<eos> My mom's been working really hard, but... we still had to make some sacrifices.<eos> The car and the piano were mine.<eos> You two are in it together.<eos> Which is nice, but... it would be nicer if I knew things were gonna get better soon.<eos> It will.
You're actually doing it.<eos> You're really communicating with him.<eos> But what's a church and an old room supposed to tell me?<eos> Maybe there's more to the message.<eos> I tried and got nothing.<eos> Stephen's finally ready to listen and I'm letting him down.<eos> When my dad was alive, we used to sit in the gardens at Lancaster Park and talk for hours.<eos> He always told me I could do anything if I just believed.<eos> But what if I fail?<eos> You won't.
I'm sorry, I thought you were my cab.<eos> I'm looking for a Hilda Suarez.<eos> Flight attendants, please prepare for departure.<eos> I didn't believe hard enough.<eos> Loving is enough.<eos> Not here.<eos> They won't let us be.<eos> Then we'll get away.<eos> Yes, we can.<eos> We will.
The face that my dad makes before he's gonna hit me.<eos> Am I right?<eos> You wanna hurt me.<eos> - Do you know why?<eos> Because when you grow up you're gonna try to kill me.<eos> Maybe even hurt my family.<eos> How... how do you know that?<eos> I just know.<eos> I - I don't even know your name.<eos> You will.
- You know what?<eos> We could've had a really great weekend, Sam.<eos> And then you had to get all caught up in your head and make it weird.<eos> No! I don't think it's weird.<eos> It's the opposite.<eos> It's not weird.<eos> - Yes, it feels weird.<eos> Listen, you're like my best friend, ok?<eos> I really don't want things to change.<eos> And they won't!
Janelle's Gonna Blow A Gasket When She Finds Out.<eos> My Name Is In The Little Black Book Of A Transsexual Hooker.<eos> How Am I Gonna Tell Her?<eos> My Suggestion?<eos> Over Drinks.<eos> Why The Hell Would You Tell Janelle?<eos> She's Gonna Find Out.<eos> How?<eos> I Don't Know How.<eos> She Just Will.
You haven't called.<eos> It's not good for you to be here.<eos> Well, what the hell am I supposed to do?<eos> You can't tell me you love me and then disappear for weeks at a time.<eos> You can't do that!<eos> Please don't raise your voice, honey, okay?<eos> Don't be mad.<eos> Just do me a favor, go to the Ashley Square, get a room.<eos> - I'll come when the party's over, okay?<eos> - Oh, yes, you will.
HE DIDN'T WANT TO COMPLAIN ABOUT THE PAIN.<eos> TECHS FOUND THIS IN THE TRASH CAN AND PUT IT BACK TOGETHER. TO "BETH WILLIAMS."<eos> RETURN ADDRESS "SAM JOHANNES."<eos> I REMEMBER THAT.<eos> YOU HARDLY EVER GET HANDWRITTEN LETTERTHESE DAYS.<eos> I ASKED BETH WHO IT WAS FROM.<eos> SHE SAID AN OLD FRIEND.<eos> YOU THINK THAT'S THE GUY?<eos> IF HE HURTS MY GRANDDAUGHTER, I'LL MAKE THAT SON OF A BITCH PAY.<eos> NO, I WILL.
Hey, baby.<eos> All right,<eos> I'm probably gonna be home in, like, two hours.<eos> (WHISPERS) It's my boyfriend.<eos> - That steak was amazing.<eos> - Yeah, what do you season it with?<eos> (CHUCKLES) I'll never tell.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> You'll tell me.<eos> No, seriously, I won't.
Is there a problem?<eos> What are you doing standing there?<eos> You play the guards?<eos> Jacinta told me you were doing spring cleaning?<eos> She wants to know if you want boxes for your papers.<eos> Tell him it's okay.<eos> Everything is in my room.<eos> - In your room?<eos> - Yes.<eos> will you?
- # Yeah yeah, she gets it...<eos> Stop cockblocking me #<eos> - # Who knows what # - # Who who who #<eos> # Makes love stop or start?<eos> # # I can't help #<eos> # But think that now you're engaged #<eos> # We're drifting apart #<eos> # And who am I to say #<eos> # That love will last?<eos> # # It won't or it will #
You know damn well what it was called.<eos> I guess I do.<eos> I keep thinking what it would be like to actually be one of those guys.<eos> Imagine if you were stuck in the past, just cut off from your friends and your family.<eos> That'd be quite a sacrifice, wouldn't it?<eos> They sound kind of like heroes to me.<eos> Well, heroes don't have people killed, They don't consume the personalities of innocent men and women.<eos> I don't know exactly what The Marked are up to. I haven't seen the movie.<eos> You never will now.<eos> No one will.
I was so careful not to aim at you.<eos> And I came back!<eos> I came back to make sure that you were okay!<eos> I did!<eos> And you are, you know.<eos> You...<eos> You're okay.<eos> People need to know what he did to my dad.<eos> People need to know the truth.<eos> They will.
- What is it?<eos> I have a virus.<eos> You don't have to worry.<eos> I can't make you or anybody else sick.<eos> - What's gonna happen to you?<eos> - Do you remember Dr Suresh?<eos> He is working really hard to find me a cure.<eos> And, when he does, I'll get better.<eos> - Yeah, but what if he doesn't?<eos> - He will.
I have to.<eos> For Kevin's sake.<eos> Nathan, if something happens to me, I need you to take care of him.<eos> You know I would.<eos> And I want you to tell the DOD what's happening.<eos> No.<eos> No, not yet.<eos> One more hour, I'll know if this last trial worked.<eos> What if I don't make it through this?<eos> You will.
- Not bad yourself.<eos> You did great.<eos> System's reset. Nice work, Fargo.<eos> SRT transfer sequence initialised.<eos> - Beverly, no!<eos> - What the hell?<eos> Damnit, her DNA's already programmed in the system.<eos> She reprogrammed the coordinates. She could be anywhere now.<eos> - She'll be found.<eos> - No, she won't.
You've got to keep her occupied.<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> Just turn on the Mick St. John charm.<eos> What girl could resist?<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> If Morgan is Coraline-- And I'm not saying she is-- if--<eos> And she realizes that you suspect her, I don't know what she'll do.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> But one way or another, I will finally find out the truth.<eos> We both will.
I got to figure out my next move.<eos> I just can't believe it's the only thing on your mind these days.<eos> Well,you know what it was.<eos> But there's a reason why it didn't work before.<eos> We were in a war zone.<eos> This is miami,Michael.<eos> Fi,beach is this way.<eos> Actually,I got a little errand to run first.<eos> It'll only take a second.<eos> What will?
Daisuke, you're overreacting!<eos> You're annoying!<eos> Declaring war against me?<eos> Cool.<eos> Annoying!<eos> You don't like being in the country, do you?<eos> That's right!<eos> Got a problem with that?<eos> Then leave.<eos> I will some time!
I'm telling you, He's not like our other patients.<eos> The crimes that got him here are nothing Compared to what he'll do if we let him out.<eos> But he responded to medication.<eos> Medication inhibits his delusions, Not his fantasies.<eos> No pill can alter his sexual proclivities.<eos> But he's only 17 years old.<eos> 17-Year-Old boys don't grow out of their sexuality.<eos> They grow into it.<eos> If he continues his medication--<eos> He won't.
He'll stop taking them.<eos> They all do, and when he does, He'll do this, all of it, Every deviant, sickening detail.<eos> He was adjudicated and committed.<eos> The law says he turns 18, we release him.<eos> Our hands are tied.<eos> It's not your hands i worry about.<eos> You ought to change your name to lucky.<eos> Thank whatever god you got.<eos> You're outta here.<eos> I will.
Just get the shot.<eos> Captain, nice to see you again.<eos> Gee, I wish I could say the same thing.<eos> That the shooter?<eos> - My god, it's Adrian Monk.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> He is off limits.<eos> I just want to hear his side of it.<eos> Adrian Monk just shot Santa Claus. People are gonna want to know why.<eos> And they will. Just not today.
You can't think I have anything to do with this.<eos> I had a couple of beers and then I decided to walk home.<eos> On Monday morning I came to pick up the car, but it was gone.<eos> - They hung up posters all weekend. - And what about you?<eos> Why did you take the surveillance tape from the town hall?<eos> I didn't take any tape. Your number was deleted from Nanna's cell.<eos> - Am I a suspect?<eos> Is that it? - Who were you with?<eos> - Won't you tell us?<eos> - The hell I will.
It was more than a lunch.<eos> It was a test.<eos> Is Charlie Harper capable of stepping up to quality women?<eos> Oh, God, we're back to third person.<eos> Alan, I am tired of having meaningless sex with hot pinheads.<eos> What a coincidence.<eos> I'm tired of hearing about it.<eos> Linda's smart, Linda's sophisticated, Linda's successful.<eos> - Linda doesn't like you.<eos> - She will.
And where was his home regiment?<eos> 18th infantry.<eos> "In omnia paratus."<eos> "In all things prepared."<eos> No medals,right?<eos> Ribbons,yes.Medals,no.<eos> He has a silver and bronze star.<eos> And a purple heart.<eos> And he'll be getting another purple heart?<eos> His parents will.
Needles and pills.<eos> They put a cloud in my head.<eos> It's dark behind my eyes.<eos> I can't see in there.<eos> Who drugged you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I can't... remember.<eos> You got to help me.<eos> At ease, son.<eos> I will.
I'm so sorry. we're just really busy.<eos> Can you give me a day? I'll call you tomorrow, ok?<eos> 'cause I really think that I can help you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hi. all righ here is what I found in the back.<eos> Honey, I didn't even know you were home.<eos> Sorry, I just got in.<eos> Before I left, we got a huge delivery that I had to inventory.<eos> Come on, come on up to bed.<eos> I will.
How do you distinguish from a copy of yourself?<eos> Who will win?<eos> The original or the perfect copy?<eos> It all comes down to the same questions they've been trying to answer for years... what makes us human?<eos> What makes us unique?<eos> Remove the artifact.<eos> What?<eos> I can't... what...<eos> I'll die if I open myself up like that.<eos> You won't.
I know he never could have done the things they're saying he did.<eos> - We know.<eos> - He didn't do it.<eos> What they are trying to do is what they do to all black men who wanna stand up for their rights.<eos> - That's right.<eos> They lynch them. They put them in prison cells that are like graves.<eos> - You tell it.<eos> - Good job, Mom.<eos> I'm asking you, please, help my son.<eos> - We will.
- I will.<eos> Hey, while I got you here, just a couple of little suggestions regarding my design.<eos> Let's face it, these skinny limbs... don't exactly make the teapot whistle.<eos> All that really matters is, hey, don't forget to invent me.<eos> Are you kidding?<eos> No way. - I love you.<eos> There's so many things I wish I could ask you. Excuse me.<eos> Time travel now, questions later.<eos> Just get back to that science fair, and we'll see you real soon.<eos> Oh, right. Right, okay, I will.
I know what I'm talking about.<eos> I've had more affairs than anyone, except maybe Casanova.<eos> Having a mistress is no excuse for deserting the mother of your children.<eos> The world has lost its values.<eos> It's not funny.<eos> It's true.<eos> Bring your children to see me.<eos> Céline does.<eos> You should, too.<eos> I will.
FLEURY: Reminds me of when they hit the towers, first time, in '93.<eos> You remember how they caught the cell?<eos> -Car bomb.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> He went back to get his deposit on the rental car.<eos> $400.<eos> Stupidity.<eos> Then nine years later they come back.<eos> I got a feeling I'm coming back too.<eos> Yes, you will.
You hate me?<eos> Fuck no.<eos> Brother or not, he took my kid. Fuck Lionel.<eos> She could have been hurt.<eos> - What about Amanda?<eos> - What about Amanda?<eos> - Who's gonna watch her?<eos> - Dottie.<eos> Yeah, does Dottie know that?<eos> - She will in five minutes.
- Hi.<eos> - Hey.<eos> Listen, it's starting to get dark.<eos> So we decided we're just gonna spend the night in the car.<eos> We'll just walk to town in the morning, get some help.<eos> Okay.<eos> You okay?<eos> I'm just a little scared.<eos> You think we will find them?<eos> We will.
And what do you think?<eos> - You need a wife.<eos> - I'm getting tired of hearing that.<eos> Let me tell you, there's nothing like a soft body to cuddle up with at night.<eos> I don't want to hear about that.<eos> - You like that Gentile girl?<eos> - Why?<eos> She sure is pretty.<eos> You think she'll convert?<eos> - Maybe I will.
Not as long as it takes to live.<eos> # Hangman, hangman<eos> # Slack your line<eos> # Slack it just a while<eos> # For I see my pappy coming # Traveling many a mile<eos> # Traveling many a mile<eos> # Papa, Papa<eos> # Has you brought gold # For to pay this hangman's fee<eos> # Or did you come to see me swinging # High from this hangman's tree<eos> Of course they will.
I have no immunity to it.<eos> We don't have the heart to tell him it's herpes.<eos> It's not herpes if it's everywhere.<eos> Are you coming?<eos> You know, I'm all dressed, so I'll just hang out.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I'll take a cab home.<eos> Okay.<eos> Be safe.<eos> I will.
It's okay.<eos> We can hide this.<eos> We'll dress you in black, and we'll emphasize your boobs.<eos> Awesome.<eos> I mean, your boobs are gonna be big.<eos> And then they're gonna be, like, scary big.<eos> But then they'll go down. And then they'll stay down.<eos> Just... Just don't say anything, okay?<eos> Please don't say anything.<eos> Oh, no, I won't, I won't.
Look at that piece of work.<eos> Be reasonable.<eos> I offer you the most beautiful girl in town.<eos> And ammount what you write.<eos> I'm thinking... its nice when man stays to the promise.<eos> Testament.<eos> Promise at all.<eos> I need to show Jasna to grandpa.<eos> What if she don't want?<eos> She will, she will.
- Take it easy, man!<eos> Take it easy!<eos> Sometimes there's nothing you can do.<eos> They get you anyway.<eos> - Leo would've gotten us out of this.<eos> - Leo? Leo is dead.<eos> And you and I are the Texan's only enemies!<eos> So if you find a way to get us out of here, let's split.<eos> - What did you say? - About what? We won't find the money, get it?<eos> We won't.
You all right?<eos> - My head hurts.<eos> - What happened?<eos> - You fell.<eos> Hey, uh, Dad?<eos> You got a sec?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Come on in.<eos> It won't be stealing. We'll leave some money, eh?<eos> Rather you will.
Because in the eyes of God, this is forever.<eos> And I mean forever.<eos> Forever.<eos> Teddy, do you take this woman, Ethel Ann, to be your lawful-wedded wife all the days that you shall live?<eos> I do.<eos> Ethel Ann, do you take this man, Teddy, to be your lawful-wedded husband?<eos> I do.<eos> I'll be yours till the day I die.<eos> You better do whatever you're gonna do with that ring.<eos> Jack, will you?
We've made a mess of it.<eos> There's still time, if we use it well.<eos> Christianity has been a worldwide belief for 2,000 years.<eos> How long did the Egyptians worship Isis or the Sumerians Ishtar?<eos> In India, sacred cows wandered freely as reincarnated souls.<eos> In a thousand years, they'll be barbecued and their souls will be in squirrels.<eos> You weren't Jesus!<eos> Oh, Edith.<eos> If...it rains...<eos> It won't.
Is that who you are now?<eos> Defender of the doofs?<eos> Look, i know i got a lot to set right by you, but this is crazy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, nicholson. What i do know is in your big, triumphant return, you seem to have forgotten which side of october road you belong on.<eos> Well, i'm gonna remind you how we roll here in the ridge.<eos> It ain't much, but it's tight.<eos> Let him go!<eos> Hey, stop it!<eos> Come on! No, nicky.<eos> No, i won't.
Sure, I'll help you.<eos> Ooh, ooh.<eos> Sorry.<eos> It's all right, just... It's okay. It's okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Just got here and you're putting me to work.<eos> I think... I got it.<eos> No.<eos> Not yet.<eos> But you will.
If a photon is directed through a plane with two slits in it and either is observed it will not go through both.<eos> If unobserved, it will.
Yep, just it happens and looks a ittle excited for the race.<eos> You don't look so excited.<eos> I was just thinking, maybe you are right,<eos> maybe uncle MicheaI is not such a good guy after all.<eos> What did you say?<eos> Nothing,really. Just the race.<eos> He likes these pep talks.<eos> He likes to win.<eos> I need to win.<eos> You will.
Wait a minute.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You're him.<eos> You're the one.<eos> You actually think she loves you?<eos> Can't you see she is using you?<eos> She's using you.<eos> She doesn't love you.<eos> She never has.<eos> And she never will.
It is perfectly ridiculous.<eos> And if I demanded!<eos> It would prove I was wrong in making the slightest promise.<eos> I wouldn't be so silly to keep it.<eos> Please return when I may be visible.<eos> Madame, I cannot wait.<eos> I am, as you say, a spoiled child.<eos> When I want what we speak of, I will have it.<eos> You will have it?<eos> I will.
-I've kept them all.<eos> -I still want you to come.<eos> -Let's see.<eos> -I have to go now.<eos> Mummy, I need you!<eos> Stupendous. It's stupendous, darling.<eos> Your first play.<eos> Do you think so?<eos> Do you think Leon will like it?<eos> Well, of course he will.
- Well, I guess I have two.<eos> - Mmm-hmm.<eos> The first is going spontaneously insane.<eos> And the second is something happening to my father.<eos> Like him dying?<eos> I really wish you, um, wouldn't say it.<eos> You're afraid of the word?<eos> Yeah, for some reason, I think that saying it might... Make it happen.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - It won't.
- Keep your hands off. - Why?<eos> You know, even if people like us make democracy prosper, we're no heroes!<eos> - Hands off.<eos> - But they are.<eos> I warned you...<eos> - They stand up to tyranny.<eos> - I told you.<eos> We don't have their courage.<eos> - Sorry about this.<eos> - And we never will.
I have a million examples from film.<eos> In Titanic...<eos> You must mix with people in the faculty.<eos> You know, mingle.<eos> Come to the party tonight.<eos> I'm not in the mood.<eos> - Bullshit.<eos> You don't go to the pub anymore.<eos> Everyone should have at least one sin.<eos> Maybe I will.
Help!<eos> Help! Can anyone hear me?<eos> I'll help you!<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> Just trying out my sofa.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> How are you?<eos> OK, fine.<eos> You won't start crying?<eos> No, I won't.
I'm very maternal.<eos> I'll be very caring.<eos> Like a gift.<eos> I thought giving was part of Christian life.<eos> Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via?<eos> The light quivering modestly in the morning.<eos> Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> I won't.
I went to the municipal police, the provincial police... the what's it called...<eos> the Department of Justice.<eos> No one knows anything.<eos> - Since the 9/1 1 attacks, Security Services can hold suspected terrorists indefinitely.<eos> - He's not a terrorist.<eos> - He's an Arab.<eos> - He's a cook!<eos> - A German cook wouldn't have this problem.<eos> - l don't know what he's accused of.<eos> - You never will.
Get out! Now! Let's go!<eos> Get out!<eos> Talk about my wife again, I'll kill you.<eos> You know what? Fuck you, Tom!<eos> At least I'm alive.<eos> You're dead inside and everybody knows it!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I'm leaving for San Francisco, tomorrow, alone.<eos> No, just wait wait until after the hearing and I'll come with you.<eos> No, you won't.
How many of these?<eos> Two.<eos> They're not gonna find out about him.<eos> You have to testify.<eos> So you know for sure.<eos> I know I did the right thing.<eos> Then tell them.<eos> I don't want you to have any regrets, Tom.<eos> Not because of me.<eos> No, honey, I won't.
-I do not want to say goodbye.<eos> I want to stay with you.<eos> -With me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I want to live with you.<eos> She laughs.<eos> "It is not possible.<eos> -If it is always possible.<eos> Just want, and things happen.<eos> Not always, as you will.
We are in a BIT of a hurry, Leo.<eos> I just said that, to shut her up.<eos> OK, lets go.<eos> You calmed down, now?<eos> We won't hurt you, we just want some dough from your daddy.<eos> Who's got so much, he won't even miss it.<eos> He won't give you a thing.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He won't give you anything, that's all.<eos> He will! Of course, he will.
Maybe we could invite her over for tea.<eos> Mom!<eos> She's old.<eos> She's like 20.<eos> Well, then I don't know what to say.<eos> You don't have to say anything.<eos> I mean, I've come to grips with my situation.<eos> And besides, I've got a new four-legged friend.<eos> Just promise you'll be careful out there.<eos> I will.
He was trying to tell you something.<eos> And that's how we met each other.<eos> - Hmm. - See?<eos> It's his destiny.<eos> I don't care how well he jumps.<eos> The fact is... Checkers isn't a blue-blooded thoroughbred.<eos> But that's why he's so special.<eos> He won't be judged fairly.<eos> - Well, they have to at least give him a shot.<eos> - They won't.
Except Guardo's.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Come here.<eos> Wyms and the chief are trying to push through my retirement.<eos> I'm not sure why, but I don't have much time.<eos> - No man. - That's why you... can't get reckless.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I'm gonna need your help to finish this thing.<eos> I can't lose you, too, Shane.<eos> You won't.
To the king's castle?<eos> I will take back what is mine.<eos> Knut... I can understand if you don't want to get involved, but I can't stop thinking of Cecilia.<eos> Cecilia Algots-daughter.<eos> She is promised to someone else.<eos> I will be king.<eos> If I can count on your support, you can count on me.<eos> - How do you know that he will come?<eos> - He will, I am sure.<eos> He will.
- Who would have killed Tory's mom?<eos> The times aren't wrong.<eos> Look, if Bodeen didn't kill Sari, maybe he didn't kill any of them.<eos> Whoever did is still out there walking free.<eos> - You have any idea where Tory is?<eos> - Yes.<eos> She's with Hope.<eos> Faith's coming.<eos> She'll be here any second.<eos> No, she won't.
We're not calling it off, Turtle.<eos> We're not getting any younger.<eos> How many of these things do you think we got left? We got a lot left.<eos> Don't drag us into your twilight years, Drama.<eos> Ha, funny.<eos> Here, get rid of all the high-end brand alcohol.<eos> Go generic. It'll save us a ton.<eos> You know what, why don't we go the complete opposite way and make us a ton?<eos> I don't follow.<eos> You will.
- No !<eos> You're the only chance your family has to survive this, and continue in through you.<eos> Do you understand ?<eos> Do you understand me ?<eos> You carry your family with you, Mary-Elizabeth, but you have to survive.<eos> And then forgive yourself for surviving.<eos> Good.<eos> Good.<eos> I just pray to God that you remember this.<eos> I will.
Ladies,<eos> I think he's finally find closure.<eos> Heavenly Father,<eos> Satan poisoned this young woman's child.<eos> But you, Lord, gave the baby a free will.<eos> Please, Lord, hear our prayer.<eos> Mary-Elizabeth Martino, will you dedicate your life to finding your child, and properly raise him following the teachings of Christ ?<eos> I will.<eos> When you find the demon's child, do you swear before God and His son Jesus-Christ, to protect the baby from all evil, keeping him safe within the support and the protection of the Holy Church ?<eos> I will.
No offense, but that gizmo's not showing a whole lot of promise right now.<eos> It'll work.<eos> I just wasn't ready for this.<eos> I'm probably not going to make it either way. No.<eos> Don't you start to talk like that.<eos> Cam, we have to face the fact that I am going to die here.<eos> No, I don't have to face that fact, because I am not going to let it happen.<eos> I appreciate that.<eos> But the truth is, even if you manage to create a distraction and destroy the device, you are never going to get me to the gate by yourself.<eos> - Yes, I will.
Just please... don't forget about me in here.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> So have you been practicing?<eos> Yes.<eos> You should go back to the drum circle.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.<eos> That will help you.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - I will.
No, I won't.<eos> So have you been practicing?<eos> Yes.<eos> You should go back to the drum circle.<eos> No.<eos> Okay, but listen to that Fela CD.<eos> That will help you.<eos> - I promise.<eos> - I will.<eos> I will.
And then, I figured Marcy had hired him.<eos> Turns out Marcy figured Isabel had hired him and so on.<eos> He needed a place.<eos> I had the guest cottage on my property, so...<eos> And the dreams?<eos> We're all pretty career-driven.<eos> You have your own business, you must understand that.<eos> You focus fully on one thing, other things disappear... cooking at home, lazy Sundays, sex.<eos> There's not much time.<eos> Not much will, either.
No they're Josie's... we have them for after work.<eos> Do we owe you Josie ?<eos> No, they were cheap anyways.<eos> How would you pay anyway Declan ?<eos> Out of your pocket money ?<eos> - The fucking worker !<eos> - Yeah, the fucking worker...<eos> Are you having a can, Josie ?<eos> Do.<eos> I will so, I will, thanks.
Here's a warrant.<eos> Anna Aleksandrowna, born May, 2, 1910... wife of the Polish officer Andrzej... has a daughter Weronika.<eos> No such person lives here.<eos> - How come?<eos> - No such person has lived here.<eos> For over a year. I've lived here... alone.<eos> - So we've come too late?<eos> - Most likely.<eos> Search somewhere else.<eos> We certainly will.
He doesn't want us to.<eos> He said he would stay in touch. Let us know what he learns.<eos> You don't really believe that.<eos> My father says the sticks honor those who died.<eos> Indeed.<eos> Do you know who did this?<eos> Yes.<eos> My father says they are cowards.<eos> They must pay with their lives.<eos> They will.
Come on.<eos> - Where's your mother?<eos> - At Adam's place.<eos> Adam, where are you?<eos> The imam's coming.<eos> Come to me, sweetheart.<eos> What are you looking at?<eos> Keep your eyes to yourself.<eos> I wish you weren't going.<eos> Maybe we won't.
I don't know what happened to me.<eos> Or what it means.<eos> No one does yet.<eos> For right now, I'm just trying to stay focused on the job taking one day at a time,<eos> putting one foot on the other.<eos> Boss, I know where Hyde went on the express elevator floor 1-13 only there is no floor 1-13.<eos> How he accessed it?<eos> No idea.<eos> For what reason, don't know.<eos> But I will.
You two?<eos> Okay... okay, I guess.<eos> It's nice.<eos> Seeing you again.<eos> I know Eddie pulled away near the end, but he pulled away from us all.<eos> I hope you don't blame yourselves.<eos> And don't be strangers.<eos> I'm tired of the lies, Cliff.<eos> I can't do this anymore.<eos> I won't.
So...<eos> You wanna do that meeting now, or what?<eos> Meeting's off.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The police wanna talk to me about Brett.<eos> Just go with the detective.<eos> Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.
No, dinner is ready.<eos> I boiled meat all day long.<eos> What a disaster.<eos> Do you like dental hygiene?<eos> Yes.<eos> Sit.<eos> I thought I could practice here but it's not so easy.<eos> I have to pass four exams and with my English, really....<eos> But they say I can keep testing until I pass.<eos> You will.
BUT IT'S WOUNDED. IT'S SMUDGED.<eos> IT'S UNREADABLE.<eos> GAME OVER. NOT TRUE.<eos> I THINK WE CAN DO MUCH BETTER.<eos> FORGET ABOUT HANDING IN ANCIENT CUMENTS.<eos> NOTHING BEATS A LIVE TESTIMONIAL.<eos> IT'S LIKE I ALWAYS SAY-- IF YOU CAN'T DELIVER THE BACON,<eos> BRING 'EM THE PIG.<eos> YOU ALWAYS SAY THAT?<eos> WELL, I WILL FROM NOW ON.
Right.<eos> You should've never had children.<eos> Not when you knew there was a chance they'd be like you.<eos> All locked up.<eos> Did Ariel say "good night"?<eos> Just not to me.<eos> She'll come around.<eos> Give her time.<eos> What if she doesn't?<eos> She will.
- Yeah, we figured that's why you asked us over.<eos> - Well, you're her friends, she trusts you.<eos> You want us to talk to her for you.<eos> Well, I was going to suggest tricking her into coming here, but if you really think talking will work...<eos> Please guys, I really need to see my little girl.<eos> If it's a matter of expenses, we can talk about that later, if you get my drift.<eos> We're not putting anything on paper of course, but uh... give it some thought, I appreciate it.<eos> Good news!<eos> Uh, I got a call from Mom and she will be in Colorado Springs on Friday.<eos> - She will!
You owe me 30.<eos> I owe you ten.<eos> Test results are back for your STD patients.<eos> And I'm not paying you for them. You already touched them.<eos> How old are you?<eos> 30.<eos> And you've never seen an after school special, Dawson's Creek?<eos> How do you get to 30 and not know about condoms?<eos> Oh, god, I-I have an STD.<eos> No, but you will.
Is that it?<eos> No.<eos> I'm hungry.<eos> Yeah, I...<eos> I love the food at the Mix, and...<eos> But I haven't been able to come in there, because... you know...<eos> Come in and eat.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah...<eos> All right, I will.
She's heavily sedated.<eos> And this time I know exactly what I'm dealing with.<eos> You!<eos> I was caught offguard the first time.<eos> That will not happen again.<eos> It does not matter.<eos> Well, we think it does.<eos> Your fate is sealed!<eos> If you have any reason to suspect that I am not myself, do not hesitate to use that.<eos> I won't.
Anyway, we have some more stops to make.<eos> Are you in a rush?<eos> - No.<eos> Good.<eos> Hey, Bob!<eos> How ya doin', boy?<eos> Ooh, nice tie.<eos> Notice how Bob gets all the attention and we're just the appendages who happen to be nearby.<eos> Oh, don't forget your donation for the silent auction.<eos> Oh, I won't.
It's happening.<eos> I'm losing it!<eos> Well, it's a start.<eos> Peter?<eos> Yes?<eos> I think I found a way to stop him.<eos> - I found him.<eos> - Sylar?<eos> - I thought you had Sylar.<eos> - I will again.
All my clients have their tactics.<eos> But hers was... insane.<eos> She wasn't lying to you, Jesse.<eos> You have 13 alleles in common.<eos> You killed your mother.<eos> Then take me to jail.<eos> You know, call me a killer... a murderer, whatever,<eos> but don't tell me I have a mother... because I don't.<eos> I never did.<eos> And I never will.
No, it's never been just rhetoric.<eos> You know, when people ask me, how can you let your sister spew all that right-wing garbage on television and not disown her, I tell them it's because I know she loves me.<eos> I know she wants what's best for me, what's best for this country.<eos> But the day you start working for that guy, it's not about what you believe in. It's about what he does.<eos> There's not one thing in all this legislation, all these speeches, that suggests he will do what's best for me.<eos> In fact, there's a lot of evidence to the contrary.<eos> All I'm asking is that you consider that before saying yes to this offer.<eos> That's all.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
If you don't mind me asking, why were you so interested in this particular street?<eos> I've been moving around a lot in the last few months, and I need a place where I can really settle down.<eos> You know what I mean?<eos> I wanna live in a place... where people still have some sense of moral value, and where friendships are good and strong and last forever.<eos> That's what I'm looking for.<eos> Then I think Wisteria Lane is the place for you.<eos> Good.<eos> More than anything, I just want to fit in.<eos> Oh, you will, Alma.<eos> You absolutely will.
I can always tell the first-timers.<eos> Now then, may I ask your price range?<eos> I'm not a man of means.<eos> I hope to, you know, one day...<eos> I have just the thing.<eos> This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still, it has the sparkle of life.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I'm... sorry?<eos> It's perfect. I'll take it.<eos> No, you won't.
Since we're eavesdropping, can you find out what else she has on Lex and me ?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Do a little recon while we're at it.<eos> Chloe, what is it ?<eos> Like tomorrow's headline ?<eos> And here I thought you hatred was just professional jealousy.<eos> Who knew you were covering such a scandalous secret ?<eos> You're actually gonna stake your reputation on this tabloid garbage that's not even fit for the Inquisitor ?<eos> Nobody's gonna believe you.<eos> Of course they will.
But I feel ready.<eos> Don't you?<eos> Tell you what, why don't you head over to Bourbon street, check us in, and I'll meet you there?<eos> All right.<eos> And if I'm not there, I'm, uh, out, uh, you know... –Seizing the day.<eos> –Right. Shh...<eos> Denny's going to get a jump on some... research.<eos> Dr Follette, when doctors induce a patient's death, they tend to say they're managing pain.<eos> I understand that.<eos> No doubt a jury will.
Hated my guts.<eos> My dad also had a lot to do with it.<eos> He hated you too?<eos> No.<eos> He died.<eos> Life took on a whole new perspective.<eos> I'm gonna call the lab and see what's taking so long.<eos> Just relax.<eos> I will try to relax.<eos> I will.
Chloe, when you get the satellite, make sure we have coverage of that area.<eos> Let Curtis know that he is to intercept Jack somewhere on route 7 on the way to Newhall.<eos> Fayed?<eos> What is it?<eos> Our scout is reporting increased activity around the Palmdale military prison.<eos> The transport buses are starting to arrive.<eos> Good.<eos> By the time my jailed brothers are boarded on the aircraft, it will be too late for the Americans to realize what's happened.<eos> We still don't have the component.<eos> We will.
An eight-week rock tour?<eos> Can your life change in a month or a week or a single day?<eos> We're always in a hurry, to grow up, to go places, to get ahead.<eos> But when you're young One hour can change everything.<eos> How we doing this morning, seniors?<eos> Anyone wake up with their clothes on from the night before, still drunk but strangely hung-over?<eos> Anyone?<eos> Well, I guess that was just me.<eos> Actually, last night was UNO night at my house and it was a bloodbath, but I care not to discuss it with you right now.<eos> So, we won't.
Do you know him?<eos> Um... no.<eos> He must be one of the old guard.<eos> You can't believe some of the drinking buddies Dad's cultivated over the years.<eos> Oh, there was this one time, we were down in Venezuela, this was before Chavez...<eos> Gray!<eos> I didn't come here to listen to your stories.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> I need to find Dad.<eos> Okay, we will.
Let me speak to Bill.<eos> - He's being briefed on Fayed.<eos> - Have you picked up any threads?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - I've got one--<eos> I want you to send two field units to 5137 Olson Avenue, in Simi Valley.<eos> It should be off the 23.<eos> I want them to wait for me there.<eos> Get Bill to call me back as soon as he's out of the briefing.<eos> Okay, I will.
These guys aren't connected to anyone.<eos> They're not terrorists.<eos> I'm getting Walid the hell out of there.<eos> You spied on us?<eos> You're worse than they are!<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> A nuclear bomb just went off, like, 25 miles from here.<eos> When I'm done with this deal, I may just buy you a small country.<eos> - Have you found an engineer? - I told you I would.<eos> Now I will.
Everyone thinks Jack is so tough.<eos> And maybe he is.<eos> But so am I.<eos> It's nice to know that I can take anything he can dish out.<eos> - You told him about Palmer.<eos> - I had to make him think I cracked.<eos> But I kept you out of it.<eos> It's gonna get a lot worse.<eos> He's not finished. He knows you didn't tell him everything.<eos> Yeah, and I won't.
It's me.<eos> I'm here.<eos> I know that I promised... to take care of you,<eos> and protect you,<eos> but I'm at a crossroads.<eos> Right now, the best way... the only way... to do that is to let you go.<eos> I hope one day you can understand that.<eos> I hope one day you can forgive me.<eos> I love you with all my heart.<eos> I always will.
No, Molly.<eos> David's alive.<eos> What?<eos> You're sure?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> We'll take you to him.<eos> Come on.<eos> He's in that house right there.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
I had no one to turn to.<eos> You recognize him?<eos> Someone I'd buy from at the house.<eos> Madison used to give me that look,too.<eos> So... disappointed in me... again.<eos> Looks like you got clean.<eos> I tried so many times.<eos> But if addiction was a battle,rehab was war.<eos> I'll get clean,Maddy.<eos> This time I will.
He loved it.<eos> Anyway, he stands up, yeah, sixer, and, um, and they all liked him, and, um, he takes my hand, and took me to the toilet.<eos> And then he had me take my shorts off, and then he cleaned me up.<eos> And then he took off his shorts and put them on me.<eos> And then... he kissed me on the cheek, and took my hand, and we both went out there.<eos> Him just in his pants.<eos> No-one laughed.<eos> Best day of my life.<eos> Look, don't, um, don't tell the others, yeah, about...<eos> No, I won't.
Please, Sid. Just check he's OK?<eos> Josh?<eos> OK. I'm leaving now.<eos> It's Tony. He's in trouble.<eos> Tony.<eos> - I'm really sorry. I've got to go.<eos> Do you?<eos> Kiss me again.<eos> No, Sid.<eos> I won't.
Oh, I'm sorry, I thought you were engaged in collective bargaining on behalf of the Colonial Workers' Alliance.<eos> If that's not the case, then...<eos> Madam President, that union died on New Caprica.<eos> Chief, the workers in this fleet, they need someone to represent them and their interests.<eos> And if this society is becoming truly polarized between an entrenched political class and a disenfranchised underclass, we are doomed.<eos> We won't need the Cylons to destroy us, we'll destroy ourselves.<eos> The fleet that arrives at Earth will not represent Colonial society at all.<eos> I am willing to fight for that society until my dying breath.<eos> I would love it if you would fight for that society as well.<eos> I will.

Yeah, looks like blood.<eos> Pandora's box.<eos> So is this animal blood ?<eos> Well, we'll know it in a second.<eos> Oh, boy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You gentlemen have a problem.<eos> The blood is definitely human.<eos> I will take a polygraph. I don't know anything about that.<eos> I will, too.
It won't be long now.<eos> In fact, something interesting happened last night.<eos> Orson tried to kill himself.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> Is he okay?<eos> He'll be fine.<eos> My point is, Suicide is hardly the act of a happily married man.<eos> Gloria, for God sake, give it up.<eos> He doesn't love me.<eos> He will, dear.
I got steamed, and I left.<eos> I went to a Buddy's, had a few beers.<eos> All right, like ten.<eos> Had this crazy idea to run down to the lake.<eos> Without trunks.<eos> It was spur of the moment.<eos> I slipped on something.<eos> I wanted to marry her.<eos> She never even knew.<eos> She will now.
Its true...<eos> - Its a good sketch.<eos> - No, its a very good sketch.<eos> - Damn sketchy!<eos> - I'll tell you what else...<eos> - Its a little sketch that could.<eos> - What do you mean?<eos> That we've been trying to get it on for 6 weeks and we get it this far and it keeps getting cut, but despite the rejection, we keep working on it.<eos> - It is a little sketch that could.<eos> - And if will!

-Shit.<eos> Dynamite?<eos> !<eos> Why do they have to bomb our city?<eos> Why can't they blow up somewhere else, like Cleethorpes?<eos> Guv, this doesn't make sense.<eos> What part of "will explode in 15 minutes" are you finding hard to grasp?<eos> It can't be the IRA.<eos> They don't use dynamite.<eos> They never will.
She's right, Frank.<eos> Guv, please.<eos> But this is the wrong way to go about it, Frank.<eos> If you cared that much for your wife and kids, you'd stop this now.<eos> You wouldn't want hurt them by shooting a copper. Blowing us all up.<eos> Is that what they deserve, Frank?<eos> How old is your boy?<eos> He's ten.<eos> How is a ten-year-old ever gonna understand what you're doing, Frank?<eos> He won't.
WHEVER HAPPENED TOERENCE TRENT D'ARBY?<eos> HE HAD SUCH A BIG HIT WITH "WISHING WELL," AND SUDDENLY, POOF!<eos> HE DISAPPEARED.<eos> I THINK SHE MAY HAVE EXCEEDED THE RECOMMENDED DOSAGE.<eos> THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I WOULD'VE DONE, IF GIVEN THE CHANCE.<eos> I'M JUST SAYIN'.<eos> GOOD JOB, SQUATCH.<eos> HERE, YOU MAY NOT HAVE SOME CAVIAR.<eos> I DON'T WANT ANY STUPID CAVIAR, HIAWATHA.<eos> YOU WILL. MMM!
They're not.<eos> - They are.<eos> - They're not!<eos> - They are!<eos> - I just said they're not!<eos> You're saying it like they are!<eos> Ooh, they are.<eos> I am such a terrible liar.<eos> Look, Christina, you have to promise me. You can't tell anybody.<eos> Of course I won't.
Henry.<eos> Charlie.<eos> Um, this is my friend, Dr. Farkas.<eos> Uh, you can call me Gabe.<eos> - Uh, nice to meet you.<eos> And, uh, this is for the birthday girl.<eos> - A tongue scraper. - Oh.<eos> That's what that is.<eos> So many people forget about the tongue.<eos> Well, now I won't.
You slovenly bitch!<eos> It's peace I need now.<eos> Have your peace then.<eos> But you won't be creeping up to my quarters.<eos> Scorched woman!<eos> One of Péidin's people buried in the Fifteen Shilling Plot!<eos> Clear out of here, you slovenly bitch or I'll tell you in front of the graveyard who you are.<eos> I raised your father since all he could get at home was potatoes and salted milk.<eos> You still haven't a cross as fine as Néra Sheéinin's!<eos> But I will, you slovenly bitch, a cross of island limestone.
But he was relieved when you connected her with the rest of the bodies.<eos> He has no feelings about them at all.<eos> - Doesn't mean he wasn't involved.<eos> - Maybe. But that doesn't look like a man who feels trapped.<eos> That looks like a man who knows he has a way out.<eos> There's something much worse than<eos> Len Grady out there.<eos> Only he knows what it is.<eos> We've got to push Grady harder to tell us what he knows.<eos> He won't.
- I said something was wrong.<eos> - We did the right thing.<eos> The father is going to jail, and Kemal was beaten up.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Buchard wants a meeting with you in the morning.<eos> - What about?<eos> - He just said you should be here.<eos> He's to be taken to task by the commissioner.<eos> I'm not taking the fall with you.<eos> I just won't.
Why, you ever kill somebody?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - No?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Killed a monkey once.<eos> Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.<eos> I won't.
There's no way!<eos> Ah, let me see what I can do.<eos> What?<eos> What can you do?<eos> I have a superpower.<eos> Lily is gonna kill me!<eos> Look at me!<eos> She's not gonna want to marry me like this.<eos> That's crazy.<eos> Of course she will.
But if you ask me questions, I could probably answer them.<eos> Okay...<eos> What'd he say?<eos> He said he told you he was gay because you were into him and he wasn't into you, and he didn't know how to get out of it.<eos> Boy, you asked the right question.<eos> He kissed me.<eos> I can't believe he's lying about it.<eos> Okay, I'll be right back.<eos> - Don't say anything to Joe.<eos> - I won't.
Let me in!<eos> I'm not leaving!<eos> You are risking your life for nothing.<eos> What do you want for her,money?<eos> I need a young one.<eos> Take Kateryna instead.<eos> Blonde,beautiful, doesn't complain.<eos> I want Lena.<eos> Everybody left her,but not me.<eos> - I won't.
- Oh, there's that.<eos> Are you?<eos> You know they charge up to $30 for a bowl of penne?<eos> Vince wants a job, Ari.<eos> Tell us what you got.<eos> - I gotta see the movie.<eos> - Not gonna happen.<eos> Walsh won't even let Rubinstein see it.<eos> He understands that at some point everyone's gonna need to see it, right?<eos> At some point, everyone will.
Literally. - So he could teleport, like Alicia?<eos> It was different.<eos> It was more like Graham Garrett could do.<eos> - So he turned himself invisible.<eos> - Not just himself. He took Lois with him.<eos> And it's not his only ability.<eos> And when he hit me...<eos> Chloe, I haven't felt anything like that since I went up against Titan.<eos> - Clark, we need to find Lois before Wes...<eos> - We will.
Fogia Transcript :<eos> Raceman<eos> Francine, you look great.<eos> Steve, handsome as hell.<eos> Hayley, can you get the door for us?<eos> Dad, I'm going with you.<eos> Oh, sure, you're part of the family when we're going to a banquet honoring minorities in America.<eos> - Hosted by Denzel Washington.<eos> - Thank you, Steve.<eos> But you won't even...
Bad influence.<eos> Well, how can you watch a movie without popcorn?<eos> Did you not listen to my closing, Denny?<eos> I never listen.<eos> Was it good?<eos> –It was good.<eos> –So stop sulking.<eos> –I'm not sulking.<eos> Well, don't even come over if you're gonna be like that.<eos> Maybe I won't then.
- Do you understand that?<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - What are you trying to prove?<eos> - Nothing, sir.<eos> - You're trying to prove something, uh?<eos> - No, sir.<eos> - Don't ever grab that phone again.<eos> - Yes, sir.<eos> - Know your place, corporal.<eos> - I will, sir.
It's a sonogram.<eos> Is this our baby?<eos> Oh, my goodness. It's so beautiful.<eos> It's a boy.<eos> Look at his little hands.<eos> He's so great.<eos> I'm so sorry I didn't make the appointment.<eos> I promise you I will never, ever, ever miss another appointment ever as long he's around ever.<eos> Be careful.<eos> I will.
But now...<eos> Look, I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid.<eos> And I'm trying to get us off this island, Jack.<eos> I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency.<eos> If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can switch off your message and call for help.<eos> My signal has been playing for the last 16 years and nobody has heard it.<eos> - What makes you think you'll have luck?<eos> - Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.<eos> I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.<eos> No, they won't.
Well, they just beat the cave-in. Pure luck.<eos> Then they left town, I guess.<eos> And nobody tried to pin the cave-in on them?<eos> Now, why would they try to do that?<eos> Well, from my experience... The best scapegoats are those... who can't speak English.<eos> You know, that's all ancient history.<eos> But they've been finding some damn strange stuff... down in that hole... in the last couple of weeks.<eos> Carvings and such.<eos> I think... something came out of that mine. Something that... never died.<eos> And never will.
I don't know why he's so happy.<eos> I did remind him that the Vatican is the Vatican.<eos> A 109-acre sovereign state in the middle of Rome, surrounded by a 60-foot wall, which is monitored 24/7, with over 200 CCTV cameras.<eos> That's not even what makes it a challenge.<eos> Getting Davian is good.<eos> But getting his buyers is even better.<eos> If they realise he's been grabbed, they'll disappear.<eos> I'm sorry, what are you saying?<eos> No matter how we grab Davian, his clients are gonna know he's been taken.<eos> No, they won't.
Sorry, I fell asleep.<eos> Well, wake up.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> - I hate the idea of leaving you here.<eos> - I'll be fine.<eos> No, it's just...<eos> That.<eos> How about I promise... that I will call you later?<eos> - You better call me later.<eos> - I will.
She likes you, it's obvious.<eos> Don't play with her.<eos> I mean, she's great, you know.<eos> She's a really nice person but she reminds me of my father.<eos> -What? -Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, we're going now.<eos> Bye-bye, bye-bye.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hey, don't forget the forest and the boat, eh?<eos> Okay, I won't.
Nigel Boswell.<eos> Agent 006.<eos> - Know what that means?<eos> - Of course I do.<eos> You are one short of the big time.<eos> I, too, am on a very important case, inspector.<eos> So you understand what I mean when I say no one must know that I am here.<eos> I have just slipped my cell-phone number into your pocket.<eos> Call me if you need any help.<eos> I will, inspector.
Where can I find her?<eos> This story isn't hers alone but all of ours!<eos> - You people.<eos> You got yourself something.<eos> You know what you got now, Chris?<eos> How about breaking and entering?<eos> By the looks of this, a little assault as well.<eos> Thank you, Thomas.<eos> - This can't go any farther.<eos> - It won't, Sister.
-Who knows and who cares?<eos> -You do.<eos> I know you like the back of my hand, Camilla.<eos> I care about his name.<eos> I want a chance in life.<eos> I want my children to have a chance.<eos> You think you're so smart!<eos> You're gonna write a book and have the world on a string, huh?<eos> -Well, what if you don't?<eos> -I will.
I don't think I've ever been here before.<eos> I don't think so either.<eos> Was that good?<eos> - Please, stay here a little longer.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I have another customer at 1:30.<eos> I work by appointments.<eos> 1:30.<eos> You won't make it in time.<eos> Yeah I will.
Everybody, go back to your seats.<eos> Or I kill myself, and I swear to God...<eos> I'll do it.<eos> We have to let go.<eos> I can't.<eos> You have to let me go.<eos> But the truck will fall, and we'll both die.<eos> Let me go, or I'll pull this fucking trigger!<eos> - No, you won't. - I swear to God I'll do it!<eos> No, you won't.
Hold, hold, hold!<eos> Okay, hold right there.<eos> Hold. I'm bringing them up.<eos> I gotta jam this cable into the drum.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Don't even think about it.<eos> It's not gonna hold us both.<eos> What...<eos> Yes, it will.
Microprocessors?<eos> Oh yeah.<eos> I heard the story.<eos> You arrested some Chinese government guys at the border carrying some light sockets or something.<eos> I can't wait to wipe that fuckin' smirk right off from your face.<eos> Would you rather wipe my ass for me?<eos> ...but there are certain parts of my job, that I'm not gonna be able to talk to you about and I cannot allow you to jeopardise ongoing investigation or your life.<eos> No, really there are things, you don't even wanna know about.<eos> - Ok then just say that.<eos> - All right, I will.
Well, they love pork.<eos> Well, this is awkward, isn't it?<eos> Charlotte!<eos> Charlotte, is it true?<eos> Wilbur, few spring pigs get to see the snows of winter.<eos> No! I can't believe this. I won't believe it.<eos> - Oh, Wilbur. - It isn't fair!<eos> - I want to live!<eos> I want to see the snow!<eos> - And you will.
For writing.<eos> It's all done except the last chapter.<eos> -I want you to help me.<eos> -How?<eos> Finish it.<eos> -Finish it.<eos> -The--?<eos> -I don't know how it ends.<eos> -You do.<eos> You will.
Stop it!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Leave me alone!<eos> Please, please.<eos> I'm afraid.<eos> Will you deliver Spain from bondage?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'm trying. I don't know how.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.<eos> You do.<eos> You will.
Oh, who?<eos> Good afternoon!<eos> You've come to pay me a visit.<eos> How gallant you are.<eos> - Have you seen Marie Thérèse today?<eos> - She's been married off.<eos> Can't we at least wait until she's talking?<eos> If you insist. Come home.<eos> We're having a ball for the soldiers who fought in America.<eos> I will.
What follows through a system of either intimidation, manipulation, or coercion, is the dominant individual begins to focus and influence the thoughts of the subordinate partner.<eos> This process nurtures a subjective gestalt where similar thoughts, fantasies, and other interlocking elements conspire to form a greater and more volatile hold, therefore a merging of like minds.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Hello?<eos> The head's missing.<eos> Nigel got what he wanted.<eos> And what was that?<eos> Eternity.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> You will. You will.
Oh, you got it, huh?<eos> What are you...<eos> Look at this guy.<eos> Special occasion.<eos> Big spender over here!<eos> Come on, Cos, let's go.<eos> Johnny says we're leaving, let's go!<eos> Hey, Johnny, watch this.<eos> Tell Jake we stopped in.<eos> Oh, I will.
Hey, Del.<eos> - Rick working you hard?<eos> - Payroll scam at Warners.<eos> - Well, that's real detective work.<eos> - I'm a real detective.<eos> Anything you guys throwing away?<eos> - Jesus, Lou...<eos> - Look, I'm asking.<eos> The shit you won't touch, come on.<eos> You will?
- What?<eos> One of them!<eos> - One of whom?<eos> Gay!<eos> Gay!<eos> Disgusting!<eos> Diwakar's such a gossip monger!<eos> He'll tell the whole world!<eos> To prove him wrong, you'll have to get married!<eos> I will.
- That's stupid.<eos> - Why's it stupid?<eos> 'Cause people want to see you do good.<eos> I want to see you do good.<eos> You know what?<eos> Georgia, you're my best friend.<eos> And you always tell me I can do things even when I think I can't.<eos> But I gotta tell you something.<eos> If you want to be a flight attendant, you first gotta ride on a plane.<eos> I will someday.
With a book?<eos> Actually, I think I want to kiss you.<eos> Anything to say?<eos> Good luck tomorrow.<eos> You know, I see us together, you and me.<eos> I dream stuff all the time!<eos> Sometimes it comes true!<eos> Hey, I'm just telling you!<eos> I really think it might happen!<eos> Then maybe it will!
She was brought back to the castle... and they were forbidden to see each other.<eos> But soon, they were doing just that.<eos> Over the next few years, they could always find a way to be together.<eos> Quick, come on.<eos> In China there's a magician that could make anything disappear- a house, a wagon, anything.<eos> We'll go visit him.<eos> They can't stop us if we want to be together.<eos> They'll never find us.<eos> Do you promise you'll take me with you?<eos> One day I will.
We should go.<eos> Now.<eos> What have you found out?<eos> - She was last seen riding here, alone.<eos> - Yes.<eos> And based on your information, I then threw her out.<eos> - Did she commit suicide?<eos> - No. It was surely murder.<eos> - Do you have a suspect?<eos> - We will soon, Your Highness.
That's okay.<eos> But who are you?<eos> Madam, I am Nawab Sharif, a friend of Aditya.<eos> I came here forthe marriage.<eos> The marriage procession has come but where is the groom?<eos> I am here, Bebe!<eos> My son, why are you standing so far off?<eos> Come here.<eos> Come and embrace your Bebe.<eos> Yes, I will.
-Who cares what Laird thinks. -I do.<eos> We'll talk about it tonight on the plane.<eos> -No. -No?<eos> It's a mile high here and I want to get acclimated.<eos> You don't wanna have a nose bleed in a presentation. Could be a little embarrassing.<eos> So I'll see you there.<eos> Here.<eos> You can't go on like this. It's 1 0 miles.<eos> No, I don't wanna spoil it for you guys.<eos> -You won't.
But, you know, you do realize how much you love home.<eos> It's good to have you back. Yeah.<eos> It's good to be back.<eos> And the boat.<eos> Congratulations on the boat.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'm waiting for it to get warm, and I'm gonna come by and take a ride.<eos> Well, anytime you want.<eos> It'll be on the house.<eos> Well, I will, then.
We can't forget him.<eos> Whatwas that about?<eos> It must mean something.<eos> I never heard myself ever talk about kids, ever. Not even in fun.<eos> So it's probablyjust a very complicated, uh, Way of wanting to ask you a very simple question.<eos> What's that?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Now, you don't have to answer now,<eos> Just, you, take your time, but... Promise me you'll think it over.<eos> I will.
All right, give me... Give me your engagement ring.<eos> - What?<eos> - Give me your ring.<eos> All right Sue, I know for the last couple of weeks... Maybe even the last couple of months, I haven't been the man I'd promised you I'd be when I first did this,<eos> PBut I want you to know from this moment forward you have me fully, all right?<eos> As your friend, and as your husband,<eos> And as the father to our baby.<eos> And you know I want that baby, Sue. You know that, right?<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes, I will.
- Yes, all of them.<eos> I'm a master student.<eos> - Put it down.<eos> Are you a master student, too?<eos> - No, I'm a killer. Put it down.<eos> You never know what it's good for.<eos> Let those losers fight it out.<eos> It doesn't get my nipples hard.<eos> We're here now... and we'll see this through.<eos> No, we won't, you fucking cunt!
Come on, you're holding us up.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Waylon, would you get up?<eos> We got more ground to cover than the Pony Express.<eos> Now, let's get to work, hounds!<eos> - I guess I gotta go.<eos> - But... but, Copper...<eos> I'll see you later, OK?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, maybe you will and maybe you won't!
-My trip to Argentina.<eos> -l've been getting calls from chat shows in Buenos Aires, in Lima, Rio, yeah.<eos> They want me to go over, all expenses paid.<eos> -But you can't start going on chat shows.<eos> Has nothing I've said made any sense to you?<eos> They'll ask you questions which you won't be able to answer.<eos> -l can answer anything.<eos> -Yes, but the lies have to be consistent.<eos> -They can't keep changing.<eos> -They won't.
You're bleeding.<eos> I have a tissue if you want.<eos> Are you gonna be OK?<eos> I'll be OK.<eos> Could Simona Carboni please come to the science lab, thanks?<eos> Hey, I've been looking for you.<eos> Baby, what's wrong?<eos> Just fuck off, alright? !<eos> There are some thing you just don't talk about, you know?<eos> I won't, alright?
Please.<eos> I thought your birthday would be a suitable time.<eos> You know... I was your age when she killed me.<eos> Come on!<eos> We're still missing one member of the family.<eos> Emily, your daughter.<eos> Nicolai.<eos> Don't be afraid. Your brother is with us now.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> I always will.
You must have his signature on thousands of documents...<eos> He has signed he last page of each of these documents...<eos> pull out the Iast signed page of one of them...<eos> And attach it to a new will... just like my dad had done, leaving it all to me.<eos> Not to that dog.<eos> You are asking me to forge the will.<eos> You want a fake will?<eos> If Arjun Bajaj can con my dad and steal what is my birthright...<eos> I can make a fake will to reclaim what is rightfully mine<eos> Jai, yourfather willed everything to Arjun Bajaj intentionally, and after much reflection.
on time. On time.<eos> Stop.<eos> See anything you like?<eos> No, sorry, I'm into midgets right now.<eos> Hey! Aren't you the new doctor in the clinic?<eos> For you?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Say, l-l... I'm having real bad pains in my chest.<eos> Oh, Is that right?<eos> Well, I'll you what,
How about you, Gallego?<eos> What's your last request?<eos> I want...<eos> I'd like to call home.<eos> And you, Guillermo?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Will you grant it?<eos> We are men of honor.<eos> We are not filthy liars.<eos> Of course we will.
Let go!<eos> I'll nail them all!<eos> - Cool it!<eos> - Fuck it.<eos> I'll nail them.<eos> I'll leave the fucking force!<eos> Shut the fuck up!<eos> It's not over yet.<eos> We'll get them.<eos> I will!
What if it does?<eos> Neale, you're afraid... to give up the very thing in yourself that brought you here in the first place.<eos> Give up?<eos> I'm running on empty.<eos> And that's why you're here.<eos> Uh, well, no.<eos> I'm here because- because I lost my job.<eos> You're here because you lost yourself.<eos> Well, right now I just want to get this job.<eos> You will.
You should eat something.<eos> I will in a little while.<eos> Where is Zack?<eos> He was arrested last week.<eos> I'm thinking we should all sit down, have a nice long talk<eos> - before he winds up in prison. - Waste of time. Mum!<eos> He's just a little lost!<eos> ***<eos> - Why do you always defend him?<eos> - Because nobody else will!
Live and die all by yourself.<eos> No people.<eos> We're up here together, you and me.<eos> In this little box.<eos> Above the clouds.<eos> Overlooking the world.<eos> Imagine when we come down from the mountain.<eos> With this gift of fire?<eos> They'll never understand.<eos> One day they will.
But if you have ever loved me..., even a wee bit...,<eos> give me one chance, please,<eos> I'm a changed man,<eos> Today, this moment...<eos> I'm willing to give up everything,<eos> But if you leave me...,<eos> I'm going to die,<eos> I won't be able to live, Simran,<eos> I won't be able to live anymore!<eos> I won't!
No, no. Why would I mind?<eos> It's a great honour to meet you, Master Muharrem.<eos> Please don't say so.<eos> That sack business is just an excuse. I wanted to meet you and discuss religious matters.<eos> You mean you don't need sacks?<eos> No, no.<eos> I do need sacks. But they were a good excuse.<eos> Well, we'll talk another time, Master Muharrem.<eos> Can you send the bill to this address, please?<eos> As God wills, of course.
What's wrong with you?<eos> You know you have to be careful about who you have over.<eos> You just disregard that and who that affects?<eos> No.<eos> God! - Don't say that!<eos> - Stop yelling at me!<eos> I just think you're being disrespectful.<eos> Well, I just wanted to watch a fucking romantic comedy, Ben!<eos> Please don't tell your dad I said that.<eos> I won't.
I didn't want you to think I had a motive.<eos> OK. What did you argue about?<eos> abigail Zealy?<eos> - No, man.<eos> Just merchandising.<eos> - You argued about merchandising?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Warren thought he deserved 70% for the concept, but I think since I did the drawings, I...<eos> - Do you have a publisher?<eos> - No. And now we never will.
They fired you?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, I did not know.<eos> But I'm not surprised.<eos> You made the mistake of speaking your mind.<eos> So did I, but they can't fire me.<eos> They can just ignore me.<eos> Good-Bye, Jacob.<eos> I'll see you next trip up.<eos> No...you won't.
- 20. - I was 19.<eos> - Were you pregnant?<eos> I'm not sure really.<eos> It was either right after or right before.<eos> It's not really the same thing.<eos> I was still terrified.<eos> What if this is all wrong?<eos> What if i'm marrying the wrong guy and 10 years from now, I look around and go, - "My god, what was I thinking?"<eos> - Truth?<eos> Some days you probably will.
I guess that once the two of us talked to him.<eos> When he killed Bummer Dan by mistake.<eos> And that was high fucking water.<eos> So you'd hold me as fair calling Harry fucking outright dimwitted?<eos> You think better than the sheriff with a shortish temper, which in certain sheriffing situations is a plus, camp be better with Harry?<eos> Anyways.<eos> You gonna have dinner with us?<eos> May be my last fucking meal if apoplexy takes me... off my nervousness.<eos> What if you won?<eos> I won't.
She needs a good bath before tonight or she's gonna be honking.<eos> Rose!<eos> Come to Mummy!<eos> Come on!<eos> There you are, my darling!<eos> Mr Lumic!<eos> Jackie was just saying thank you, that's very kind of you.<eos> Those ear pods are hand made.<eos> Tell her to take care.<eos> Course I will.
And it breaks your heart.<eos> You told me that.<eos> That's not what I meant.<eos> - I'm sorry, I didn't mean... - No, don't...<eos> Don't use that as a reason.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> What if I go shopping and leave it in the supermarket?<eos> Don't worry, I'll do all the shopping.<eos> I'm afraid I'd mess it up, Luka.<eos> We won't.
I've been waiting all this time for the two of you to make things right with each other.<eos> Will you tell my brother that everything's good with me now.<eos> That I'm okay.<eos> Tell him that he's free to take his shot.<eos> Tell him that I'll always be looking out for him. Me and the old man.<eos> Come with me now.<eos> - Who?<eos> - You'll see.<eos> Will you tell Andrea that I had a crush on her, too?<eos> I will.
We gave him the best defense we could.<eos> He was broke,of course. Paid me back in paintings.<eos> You didn't answer my question.<eos> Sorry. It'll have to do.<eos> Now,getting back to leslie.<eos> I don't think she's stable.<eos> Noted.<eos> Do you have her address?<eos> She probably wouldn't want me to give it to you.<eos> So I will.
- Well, I--<eos> You know, Luke was pretty serious about her.<eos> He tell you about them?<eos> No, but I don't tell him about my boyfriends either.<eos> Well, no, because he's met all of them already.<eos> He hasn't met all of them-- some.<eos> Most.<eos> Well, what's the kid like?<eos> Yeah. You get along?<eos> Oh, well, we will.
I can't...<eos> I can't do it, it's your... opening<eos> - No no... Don't even<eos> - I should... I... I am so sorry<eos> Ok<eos> Girl come on...<eos> look... look there's gonna be a lot others parties ok?<eos> ... there's gonna be a lot others parties, don't worry ok?<eos> there's gonna be a lot others parties in Los Angeles with Russel Simmons?<eos> Sure there will...
Hide what you're really feeling.<eos> Seeing Victor and Katherine together... how in love they are... it kind of reminded me of our glory days.<eos> And you know how much I love you, Clark.<eos> But we seem to just keep going around and around.<eos> - We can't move forward.<eos> - I know.<eos> Just tell me the truth, Clark.<eos> Do you still love me?<eos> I've always loved you.<eos> And I always will.
Yes, yes.<eos> The problem with an explosive delivery system is that, because the drug is now an aerosol, a third of the tests ignited the medication, rendering it useless.<eos> They call it flashing.<eos> Long ago, we experimented with gas weapons.<eos> We found them most difficult to use in outer-atmosphere combat.<eos> When fired into an enemy vessel, the weapon caused explosive decompression in the targeted compartment.<eos> We had thought of that, yes, but if you want to affect a large population simultaneously, an aerosol gas is really the only way to go.<eos> Now we have to figure out a way to get it into your enemies' hive ship.<eos> Yes.<eos> We will.
No one's gonna do anything that you don't want to do.<eos> But I'm talking five minutes here man. Sam...<eos> Five minutes?<eos> Go.<eos> Come on.<eos> Look.<eos> I can't begin to understand what you went through.<eos> That's right, you can't. Max...<eos> This has to stop.<eos> It will.
The military promise you one thing and then next, you have to choose between a tape recording of "Taps" and some guy holding a digital horn.<eos> I think playing "Taps" is out of my league, sorry.<eos> You know, I'd really like you to come.<eos> Of course.<eos> - Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just let me know.<eos> - I will.<eos> - I've got a 10:00. - Okay.<eos> Thanks for coming in.<eos> - Sure. Call if you need anything.<eos> - I will.
- No, no. Go.<eos> Have fun.<eos> Enjoy yourself.<eos> O kay.<eos> Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> - Good.<eos> Look, take a break from work later, come visit me.<eos> You gotta eat.<eos> Maybe I will.
Sorry, sorry.<eos> Where is Roberto?<eos> He's not coming.<eos> He says he doesn't want your money.<eos> Papa, it is his job to provide for our baby.<eos> And how does he expect to provide for my grandchild?<eos> He's a clown!<eos> He is an artist.<eos> Brigitte, we agreed that the trust fund would be a safety net in case things don't work out.<eos> But they will.
I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> Yeah you do.<eos> My dad's dead.<eos> They said cancer, but...<eos> Then Warren turned on my mum and me.<eos> He said if I danced at his club, and was nice to some of his friends-<eos> - If you're spinning me another line-<eos> - Setting you up was my last job.<eos> He said if I did that, he'd let me go.<eos> But he never will, will he?
So, Kandi, wanna go out sometime?<eos> Okay, I want you to know I tracked down Kandi.<eos> I told her to move on and she has.<eos> So I got no lifeboats, no life preservers, no water wings.<eos> If the ship goes down, I'm going down with it.<eos> So there's no longer any reason to put off you and me getting naked.<eos> Charlie, I'd like you to meet my parents.<eos> Hello.<eos> What if Dad says I could stay up to watch it?<eos> He won't.
Why did she do it, Dad?<eos> Why?<eos> What did I ever do to her?<eos> - It's all right.<eos> I hate her!<eos> I hate her, Dad. I swear.<eos> I want to kill her. I hate her.<eos> Fucking Bitch!<eos> I want to go back to Princeton.<eos> You will.
All this girl did was disrobe...<eos> In public.<eos> Is she hot?<eos> It's my cousin.<eos> Is she hot?<eos> You,my friend,you are a true-blue knight in shining armor.<eos> Thank you so much,carlos.<eos> Uh,wait.<eos> Maybe i can,uh,see you sometime.<eos> Of course you will.
No,i got them to drop the charge.<eos> But did they take your picture when they booked you?<eos> You should leave.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> I'm sick of running,man.<eos> I just started to feel normal here.<eos> I started to feel safe.<eos> He said he would never stop looking.<eos> He won't.
You're right, I can do it.<eos> You'll never do it.<eos> You'll never be as good as I was.<eos> So stop trying.<eos> Take him out!<eos> Take him out!<eos> Don't save him.<eos> I can't do it.<eos> I couldn't do it.<eos> You will.
I guess maybe Edward was right about them.<eos> Not everything is what it seems.<eos> I have to try and get Ambrose to tell me the truth.<eos> It's the only way that Edward will get closure and cross over.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I always am.<eos> All right.<eos> Your husband loves you very much.<eos> I never loved anyone that well.<eos> And now I never will.
You never saw what was right in front of you.<eos> She's right.<eos> He sees things, he knows things that he didn't know when he was alive.<eos> And now there's nothing I can do.<eos> It's too late.<eos> No, it's not too late.<eos> He knows that he mistreated you both.<eos> He didn't know how much you loved him.<eos> I still love you, Edward.<eos> I always will.
Just relax-- we're not here for you...<eos> We're here for your son.<eos> My son?<eos> All right, this has gone far enough.<eos> He's the one who forged your name to buy chemicals so he could make nitro...<eos> No, I know my son!<eos> This is absurd!<eos> You can search my home.<eos> You will not find anything!<eos> Actually, they will!
Although you seemed to have a hard time Getting out the words, "would you like to have dinner?"<eos> Yeah.<eos> I haven't really been on a date in a while.<eos> Welcome to the club.<eos> You're kidding me.<eos> Man: here we are.<eos> The wine list.<eos> I don't know about romeo here, but i'll have a beer.<eos> And you?<eos> I will, too.
Well, I do. And even when I don't tell you, it means a lot to me to know you're there.<eos> It means everything.<eos> I am here.<eos> We both are.<eos> I know. And it's good being here. Especially with you.<eos> I wish that it was me.<eos> I know that's horrible and I know that's selfish, but I watched you rescue Peyton, and you told me you rescued Dan, and sometimes I just wish you could rescue me.<eos> From what? From all of it.<eos> Okay, then.<eos> I will.
- That's all.<eos> - What's that?<eos> Yeah, if you haven't figured it out by now, you probably won't.<eos> Oh, it doesn't matter just as long as everything is back to the way it's supposed to be.<eos> It will be if you got us back.<eos> I mean, otherwise...<eos> How are we gonna get them back?<eos> Oh, I can take care of that.<eos> Yeah, but how will you know when to take them back to?<eos> Oh, the ring will.
- Who?<eos> - Ma.<eos> Aquamom!<eos> I love it.<eos> There's no way Ma's coming to L.A., bro.<eos> - No way.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> You've never gotten her to come before.<eos> What makes you think she'll come now?<eos> - She won't.
The love in my heart, chili on the stove,<eos> oh, and I ran those financial records.<eos> -I'm a great father.<eos> -Mm-hmm.<eos> None of the families of the crash victims made money on insurance.<eos> They basically got enough just to pay for the funerals.<eos> However, Rhonda's family won a separate lawsuit with a $2 million payout.<eos> You'll never guess who from.<eos> You're right.<eos> I won't.
We've already requested and been granted the authority to go after Tippin ourselves.<eos> We're only telling you this because Will is your friend, and we both know you'd want to be informed.<eos> We are not asking you to end your leave.<eos> We have this under control.<eos> You don't need to come back to work.<eos> Anna's involvement is actually a positive for us.<eos> She's too well-known in the underworld to disappear outright.<eos> We anticipate that she will reveal herself before long.<eos> We will find her.<eos> Yes, we will.
- Yeah, I think so.<eos> We'd be better if you stopped talking when I'm trying to show them how to save his life.<eos> - Listen, Vic...<eos> - I'm all over this.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> Go find Neela, please.<eos> Okay, Abby, look.<eos> Look for the wire in the oropharynx.<eos> I can't see it.<eos> - You will, you will.
There's plenty to split.<eos> The government didn't want any more embarrassment after I took off with the money, so they lowballed it to the papers.<eos> The truth is, Michael, it's not $1 million under that silo.<eos> There's $5 million there.<eos> - You check the chow hall? - Yeah.<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Anybody try his cell phone? - Oh.<eos> Give Anna her Papa's love.<eos> I will.<eos> I will.
Yeah, but... I invested it.<eos> - You invested it?<eos> - At the bookies.<eos> - Dad!<eos> - Sure thing, they said.<eos> - No wonder Mom ran off. - I'd pay<eos> - my debts and forget Paris!<eos> - But I don't want to forget it!<eos> If we don't show up tomorrow, we lose the job!<eos> We won't!
So, I've been thinking.<eos> It's been a pretty rough year, hasn't it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I guess.<eos> You barely talked to me for an entire month, and when you did, it was loud.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't mean to be like that.<eos> I guess I kind of got caught up in all that popular-crowd stuff.<eos> I won't be mean to you anymore, dad.<eos> Sure you will.
Everything's betterwhen you're popular.<eos> Colors are brighter, jeans fit snugger.<eos> You know when you put a piece ofJuicy Fruit in your mouth... and for the first five seconds it tastes so sweet and perfect... like someone sprayed a little miracle on your tongue?<eos> Well, that's what being popular is like, but all the time!<eos> Piece ofJuicy- Oh, my God.<eos> I-I have to sit down.<eos> - I never had it, Steve, butyou can.<eos> - I want it!<eos> - Then take it!<eos> - I will!
Go ahead.<eos> That's the easy part.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I've already sent the remote dial command.<eos> It's just going to take a while because of time dilation.<eos> - Wormhole is established.<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Teal'c, I have a collect call from the Pegasus galaxy.<eos> Will you accept the charges?<eos> I will indeed, Colonel Mitchell.
You have the right to remain silent.<eos> Must you?<eos> I'll waive reading.<eos> I... I'll get you a lawyer.<eos> Evidently, he advised a client to flee the country.<eos> Told him to go where?<eos> Nimmo bay.<eos> The arraignment's at 10:00.<eos> Which I'll handle.<eos> Which you won't.
- That is really not your problem.<eos> - I disagree.<eos> You saw Christina.<eos> That girl had a litter growing inside of her.<eos> You think she could have survived?<eos> - It's not your problem!<eos> - I think it's all of our problem!<eos> And for our kids' sake, just think about what I'm saying.<eos> So does larkin know you're here?<eos> No, but she will.
Yeah, uh... he and, uh, Russell took everyone up to, um... uh... why?<eos> Why do you ask?<eos> Some of our emergency management folks need to talk to him.<eos> Don't you guys have radios?<eos> He's out of range.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what.<eos> If I hear from him, I'll let you know, okay?<eos> When do you expect to be hearing from him?<eos> I don't know, really.<eos> Maybe I won't.
You're here!<eos> - And so are you, honey.<eos> Come on!<eos> Yes, thank you, gentlemen.<eos> Take a seat.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Please, doctor, I assure you, this will be very brief.<eos> I'm sorry your husband isn't with us tonight.<eos> - I wanna see my kids.<eos> - You will.
It's a quantum leap up the social ladder for somebody like Stillson.<eos> Beauty, brains and a gambler's heart.<eos> Lethal combination.<eos> What do you want?<eos> A union between the two of you could help take him to the top.<eos> And you with him?<eos> And if I refuse?<eos> People will die.<eos> Will you do me the honor of becoming my wife?<eos> I will.
You will hold her in your arms, and you'll know for the first time what it is to feel true love.<eos> But you'll lose everything you've done here.<eos> Wish I had some chocolate caramels.<eos> Let's move !<eos> We got some people waiting for their ride down there.<eos> Will you quit looking at me like that ?<eos> Like what ?<eos> You know like what.<eos> Like we're never gonna see each other again.<eos> We will.
I can't even deal with anyone who wants something from me right now.<eos> Sure...<eos> Does this mean we can't spoon... naked?<eos> Ouch! I'm kidding.<eos> You should come work out with me. You've got a nice right hook.<eos> Right. Not as long as you're working out with the Mega-Bitch.<eos> Hey, me and Madison are just friends, alright...<eos> With benefits.<eos> - Does she know that?<eos> - She will.
- Don't you remember ? - no.<eos> Then you don't remember singing the national anthem, either.<eos> I didn't sing that!<eos> Then it must've been Beethoven's 5th Symphony...<eos> Was i shouting ?<eos> Not too loud, but enough to wake half of the neighborhood.<eos> Listen...<eos> I want you to bring your paycheck straight home today, you hear me ?<eos> - i want a real Christmas this year.<eos> - of course i will !
That's called respect.<eos> I have always been there for him,good times and bad.<eos> I didn't learn that from you.<eos> I know I wasn't much of a father.<eos> I tried to be there for you and susan.<eos> Look for understanding someplace else.<eos> In fact,why don't you do us both a favor and just go away?<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Fine.<eos> Then I will.
Which is why no matter what you do to me I'll never help you.<eos> You know what?<eos> I got... a hangnail right there on my thumb.<eos> You mind working on that one next?<eos> Marshall's right about you.<eos> I'm doing what needs to be done.<eos> Does that help you sleep at night?<eos> Eventually, Marshall or Rachel will do what I ask.<eos> No.<eos> They won't.
- He would never do that.<eos> - OK, you know what?<eos> Just stop it, alright?<eos> Lucius is not a superhero.<eos> - Batman: thats a superhero.<eos> - I dont understand.<eos> Your people cannot place their future in Lucius hands.<eos> The time has come for you to save yourselves.<eos> We have no hope of defeating these soldiers.<eos> - You will with our help.
- Like my dad has, little red spots here.<eos> What's it called, though?<eos> - I don't know. "The illness".<eos> Can you die of it?<eos> - Don't think so.<eos> But Yankel had it, too.<eos> And my dad, he wrote a letter.<eos> And he might be going away.<eos> And I don't know if he'll ever come back.<eos> - Of course he will.
Damn straight.<eos> We have Aurora.<eos> We know it works.<eos> You were going to kill Doctor Vonner anyway.<eos> Blade just saved you the trouble.<eos> At the moment, I have different troubles.<eos> Those shipments were your responsability.<eos> And so is Boone, I'll take care of him.<eos> No.<eos> You and Krista will together.
My door's locked.<eos> It's just a precaution.<eos> Newborns sometimes snap.<eos> It's only until your mind and body reconcile with the metabolic changes.<eos> Here I was thinking it was because nobody trusted me.<eos> Perhaps I haven't given you the proper respect.<eos> Yeah, throwing me off the building was a little rude.<eos> Yeah, you were trying to kill me, let's not forget.<eos> I haven't.<eos> You will.
Domic's faction.<eos> You don't think Boone can really get an audience with a Pure Blood, do you?<eos> I'm not willing to risk it.<eos> I want you in Silvan.<eos> I'll send a team to meet you there.<eos> I'm sending Krista back.<eos> No!<eos> Use every asset.<eos> If he gets to Domic and he discovers what we've been doing here.<eos> He won't.
Are students still being taught how to play the block flute in blocked lessons?<eos> Nice joke!<eos> Mr. Lemi, I am against the idea of playing the flute as being complex.<eos> I am trying to make the kids love to play the violin.<eos> Of course, in Yozgat, they used to call the flute the shepherd's pipe.<eos> Students being treated as sheep, how could that be!<eos> It's just for the... stationery stores to make money.<eos> Sir, I also wish to release an album... and want to donate the entire proceeds to our school.<eos> Shall we talk about this?<eos> We will.
It's impossible.<eos> A reputable businessman like you...<eos> I will have to ask you not to talk about this story anywhere.<eos> Oh for God's sake, don't talk about being reputable.<eos> Don't bother.<eos> Besides, if the system has screwed you up, you... screw it up too.<eos> Do you know how many defeats this... system has gone through while trying to defeat us?<eos> That's right, sir. What happened?<eos> Mr. Rafet, you have to sign the papers.<eos> Okay, I will.
I present Ýskender the Great!<eos> Now, let's have one of you join us on stage, shall we?<eos> Welcome! Your name?<eos> Give me a break.<eos> Calm down.<eos> Shut up!<eos> Why were you pushing there, Abi?<eos> What are you talking about? You were pulling, right?<eos> I told you to wear your glasses on stage!<eos> Well I won't!
I promise.<eos> All aboard!<eos> Well, it's time to say so long.<eos> - Good luck, Dad.<eos> - Thank you, Son.<eos> - Take care of yourself, Dad.<eos> - I will.<eos> Don't you worry.<eos> - Remember the North Star, Molly.<eos> - I will.
You know, I had such a great time with you last night.<eos> Listen, there's something I have to tell you.<eos> I just got back from the doctor.<eos> I have herpes.<eos> I think you should get yourself checked out.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Will you stay?<eos> What?<eos> Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?<eos> Yes, I will.
I'm the one who's got to eat the food here.<eos> Dad, that isn't funny.<eos> I know, sweetheart.<eos> I'm going to be fine.<eos> If there's anything that I did to make this worse for you...<eos> No. No, you've been under a lot of pressure.<eos> The last few days have been tough on you two.<eos> Don't worry about us.<eos> Just get better, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
- Let me finish.<eos> Just shut up.<eos> If I play myself, I sell heroin.<eos> - But you don't.<eos> You said so. - Kurt, listen...<eos> Let me just say one thing.<eos> - He got stamped as a criminal.<eos> - Let Jang answer.<eos> - Pay attention, Kurt.<eos> No, I won't.
- Like Ray Charles.<eos> - And, um... you know.<eos> - Yeah? You know, uh, I mean, come on.<eos> Mr. Magoo.<eos> - Who's that?<eos> - Mr. Magoo?<eos> Oh, gosh, he was a great man.<eos> - Um... an inventor.<eos> - Really?<eos> An entrepreneur, if you will.
Or we could assume it's a symptom, in which case whatever's in his lungs is also in his brain, unless you've got something more promising.<eos> I'll go get an MRI of his head.<eos> Keep testing till you find something.<eos> I'm going to my office to rest for a while.<eos> It's been a long time since I took an anatomy class, but I'm pretty sure you're moving farther and farther away from my lungs.<eos> Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> It doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.<eos> Oh, no. Not for six more hours.<eos> - Do you want us to fail?<eos> But you will.
So... please.<eos> Did Gibbs just say...?<eos> What-What did you, uh, what'd you want to know, again?<eos> Signal's strong, no movement.<eos> Got eyes on the target, Ziva?<eos> I did; suspect's in the house and he's not alone.<eos> You sure?<eos> I heard Paulson's voice.<eos> Let me give you some more money, in case you need it.<eos> I won't.
I read the preliminary autopsy report on that, Agent Gibbs.<eos> Seems there's a lack of evidence linking Puchenko to the crime.<eos> He was carrying an illegal firearm.<eos> Not connected to the shooting.<eos> Yet.<eos> Well..<eos> Well, find evidence that he was involved in any serious criminal activity and I promise,...<eos> I'll hand him right back to you<eos> Do we have anything yet, Agent Gibbs?<eos> We will.
Look, you're thinking about Ricky, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Then don't feel bad about it.<eos> Thank you.<eos> This is a hell of a first date, huh?<eos> Well, at... at least we're getting to know each other.<eos> Just so you know... I'm not really into the whole bondage thing.<eos> Well, I hope we get a second date.<eos> I really do.<eos> We will.
I'll do it for you.<eos> Father Job, forgive me, an old fool.<eos> Forgive me the soot and Cain and this sideboard.<eos> - It is all right.<eos> - Forgive me for Christ's sake.<eos> Let bygones be bygones.<eos> You pardon me.<eos> I've been unjust to you.<eos> Pardon me for Christ's sake.<eos> God will.
She'll-- she'll never forgive me.<eos> You gotta risk it.<eos> Look at all the other risks you took.<eos> He says you have to risk it.<eos> And tell him I forgive him for the rest.<eos> And he forgives you for the rest of it.<eos> He does?<eos> He does.<eos> Steve...<eos> she will,too.
And I figured out it was in her burial plot from the way her idiot husband was whining about it.<eos> So you killed her, too?<eos> Why would I?<eos> Hell, I-I didn't want to kill Ed what's-his-name, but he got in the way.<eos> Where's the gold now, Jeremy?<eos> It's not at your place.<eos> I won't be telling you.<eos> I guess that goat's head didn't work after all, huh?<eos> Not much of a prosperity spell.<eos> It will.
She's saying she...<eos> She doesn't blame you for all the pain and the worry.<eos> She's saying it's not your fault, Ted.<eos> She shouldn't be here.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> She's saying it never is.<eos> She said that was the best date. The picnic on the beach and it poured sheets and sheets of rain.<eos> We sat in my car and listened to the whole American Beauty album.<eos> She remembers it all.<eos> She always will.
Have to cross at the light.<eos> There's only one light in this town.<eos> - Get in the squad car, please.<eos> - You're taking me in for this?<eos> I have no idea what my son needs.<eos> You don't need to arrest someone to have a conversation.<eos> - You're the relationship coach.<eos> - Not for families so much.<eos> - Why can't patrick just accept that his father is dead?<eos> - Well,I'm sure he will... eventually.
That plays for us.<eos> It's as good as gold.<eos> Besides, you're the one that told me,<eos> "Hey, nail somebody." Well, there's your guy.<eos> You know how many jobs Pruitt brings to the city?<eos> If Pruitt folds, so do dozens of other ancillary businesses.<eos> Who does that help?<eos> Those are sweatshop jobs.<eos> And if they go away, do you think these people are gonna stop coming here?<eos> They won't.
That rates a jump.<eos> Please compare this against these other samples.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I...<eos> Just do it now, okay?<eos> Miss Boa Vista?<eos> What's going on?<eos> The girl in the tollbooth car is my sister.<eos> We have to find her, Lieutenant.<eos> We will.
Now it's my turn.<eos> Hey, Sean.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - About Matt, I know.<eos> He's adamant about giving me his kidney.<eos> I'm afraid he's going to leave it on my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.<eos> You don't need Matt's kidney.<eos> Because I'm going to give you mine.<eos> That is very sweet, Sean, but I think that we're both gonna feel a little silly when my body rejects it.<eos> It won't.
He drove off before I could get the wig on it.<eos> Earl, thanks again for loaning us all this money.<eos> No problem, Crab Man.<eos> Besides, what kind of man doesn't help his ex-wife make bail ?<eos> Recently, Joy and Bargain Bag had a difference of opinion on their return policy.<eos> You can't return this.<eos> I have returned it, and somehow or another,<eos> I'm gonna get my $3,000 back. - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, I will.<eos> No, you won't.

That's why.<eos> Don't let Randall find out.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - I mean it.<eos> It won't be good if he finds out.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Just trust me.<eos> And nobody else should find out either.<eos> - And tell your boyfriend not to say anything.<eos> - He won't.
You've caught something from that sorcerer!<eos> What will the men think when they can't fight under their gods?<eos> They will lose their nerve, Maxentius will win!<eos> - No, he won't! - How do you know that?<eos> You don't.<eos> Maxentius is my brother, you forget that.<eos> I know him, he's ruthless.<eos> - He'll kill us.<eos> He'll kill you, he'll kill both of us.<eos> - No, no, no, he won't.
So where was THIS sighting then?<eos> In a place called Roundstone Wood.<eos> I know it.<eos> Has an odd history.<eos> How d'you mean odd?<eos> It's always stayed wild.<eos> In ancient times it was considered bad luck to walk in there or even to collect timber.<eos> Even the Romans stayed clear of it.<eos> I've had no report of any sighting.<eos> You won't.
And look, the good news is, Mommy's fine now.<eos> And we'll all see auntie Nora again in heaven.<eos> Or wherever.<eos> Did they let you keep the bullet?<eos> No, no, afraid not.<eos> That blows.<eos> We wanted to bring it for show-and-tell.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you okay?<eos> What if the crazy lady comes back?<eos> She won't.
Eva would so love that you came.<eos> You know, I don't think she'd even remember me.<eos> Oh, she would.<eos> She talked about you.<eos> She said you gave her a great gift.<eos> Well, listen, I really have to get back to upton.<eos> I don't like to come into the city very much 'cause it really makes me kinda nervous, so... so good to see you.<eos> - Bye.<eos> Please come visit us.<eos> - I will.
Take a number and wait in line.<eos> I'm sure he feels the same way about you, too.<eos> I mean, don't you two have some kind of agreement?<eos> Yeah, he dates anything that moves, and I agree to smile and take their messages.<eos> And now I'm sending them flowers, too.<eos> Amanda, if you knew who he was, why did you get so involved?<eos> Because... I thought he would get sick of serial dating.<eos> I sure as hell am.<eos> And what if he doesn't?<eos> He will.
We can take care of each other.<eos> Yes, mom.<eos> But don't worry.<eos> Everything is coming along fine.<eos> That's wonderful, son.<eos> And Maew... how is she doing?<eos> If you're coming home, bring her along.<eos> She's a famous singer now. Has she's forgotten me?<eos> Please tell her that we all miss her.<eos> I will, Mom. 13
It's because you have something to say.<eos> And you know what?<eos> I get it.<eos> Okay?<eos> I understand.<eos> No. No,you don'T.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> You know,I don't care what you read or what you think you read, you don't get it.<eos> But keep watching.<eos> You will.
And you can show up on my doorstep anytime.<eos> And how you live your life is your business.<eos> No, you were right.<eos> You are in love with Che?<eos> No.<eos> No, about the Seth thing.<eos> I have been pulling away.<eos> It's just...<eos> Summer, I understand.<eos> But Seth will, too.
Then have the courtesy to shut up and listen.<eos> We know you made threatening phone calls to Clinton's apartment.<eos> A witness puts you at the scene.<eos> We know you shot Jeremy Clinton.<eos> I'm sure you did it to protect your mom.<eos> If you confess, I'll do whatever I can to help you.<eos> - They won't let me.<eos> - Jordan.<eos> - Who?<eos> Who won't?
--Mostly.<eos> I gave him a shot for the pain.<eos> Probably fall asleep now.<eos> Is this the guy?<eos> The murderer everybody's talking about?<eos> --He says no.<eos> --Oh, no one's going to believe him.<eos> They're out for blood.<eos> He's not going to get a fair shake.<eos> Yes, he will.
It's always been a bad day for you.<eos> And I don't want your bad luck rubbing off on me.<eos> So let's pretend that we don't know each other.<eos> If you're gonna be like that I can just go around telling everyone your past.<eos> Why don't you, you loser.<eos> Hey everyone!<eos> MA Yeon-seong here is...!<eos> Quiet, okay, I'll teach you how!<eos> But once you blabber our secret I'll sew your trap tight!<eos> Okay! I won't.
Are those your glasses, sir.<eos> No?<eos> They are, right?<eos> Sir, what was your question? My question was, why do you come here?<eos> Aside from money, which is probably an obvious factor.<eos> Aside from the food. And Timbits.<eos> Um, you know, honestly, I kind of dig it. I like it.<eos> This is my, uh, second-- well, third favorite part of the job. I like writing.<eos> I like editing. Because editing is kind of like writing. It's like getting to write another version of the script.<eos> Another draft if you will.
If he hurt you, then I'm going to hurt him.<eos> That's funny, Cohen.<eos> See, I knew you could cheer me up.<eos> I'm serious.<eos> You can at least act like it's halfway feasible that I could avenge your honor.<eos> What, you're serious?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I'm going to go so Ryan Atwood on his ass.<eos> Come on, Cohen, I don't like this.<eos> Neither will Che.
Pardon me?<eos> I can tell from your face.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Your face make me sick.<eos> It's been 4 years since Jongsook died.<eos> If she were alive, today would be her birthday.<eos> That's right.<eos> Today's the 29th.<eos> If I die, will you believe me?<eos> will you?
Everyone has his own side of the same story.<eos> If you had believed me, Jongsook would still be alive!<eos> Of course the detective, too...<eos> The DNA tests will tell us who the murderer is.<eos> Can I go now?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You must still be in shock.<eos> February 29th is over.<eos> will the ghost return in 4 years?<eos> will she?
Go.<eos> What's this?<eos> Stop!<eos> Don't kill me!<eos> I won't tell anyone! I won't tell.<eos> Stop!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I won't tell anyone!<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> I won't!
Say no?<eos> And watch him leave?<eos> Don't you think I should then wonder over and over again what sort of life I might have had?<eos> What is it?<eos> Your mother would have done it and not given it a thought.<eos> What is it Sue?<eos> Three thousand pounds Sue.<eos> Marry him Miss.<eos> Mr. Rivers loves you. And love never hurt a flea.<eos> All right, I will.
- Fuck you.<eos> - Too late now.<eos> Consider yourself... forgiven.<eos> It's over... almost.<eos> No. You can't do this.<eos> No.<eos> But you can.<eos> - There's gotta be something we can do.<eos> - You came all this way to save me.<eos> - And you will.
Pretty sure.<eos> You could see it coming.<eos> Anybody could see it coming.<eos> Don't be so serious.<eos> Here.<eos> What?<eos> -We're gonna play a game.<eos> -What kind of a game?<eos> You'll see.<eos> Well, actually, you won't.
A king may move a man.<eos> A father may claim a son.<eos> That man can also move himself.<eos> And only then does that man truly begin his own game.<eos> Remember, how so ever you are played... or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone... even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power.<eos> When you stand before God, you cannot say...<eos> "But I was told by others to do thus"... or that virtue was not convenient at the time.<eos> This will not suffice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I will.
That I would rather live with men than kill them... is certainly why you are alive.<eos> That sort of Christianity has its uses, I suppose.<eos> We must not go to war with Saladin!<eos> We do not want it, and we may not win it.<eos> Blasphemy!<eos> Blasphemy!<eos> An army of Jesus Christ, which bears his holy cross, cannot be beaten.<eos> Does the count of Tiberias suggest that it could be?<eos> There must be war.<eos> God wills it!

Write to me.<eos> Promise.<eos> Do you think we'll ever just have a quiet year at Hogwarts? - No.<eos> No, I didn't think so. Oh, well.<eos> What's life without a few dragons?<eos> Everything's going to change now, isn't it?<eos> Promise you'll write this summer.<eos> Both of you. I won't.<eos> You know I won't.<eos> - Harry will, won't you?
I'll be home tomorrow.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> Yeah, I'll be fine.<eos> Shouldn't you be in bed?<eos> What for?<eos> Sit down.<eos> Breakfast is ready.<eos> I'm taking good care of my guy.<eos> She's got to come back on her own, Jack.<eos> She will.
Go.<eos> Just as you go down... for the third and final time... as your head disappears beneath the waves... and your lungs fill with water... do you know what happens in those last precious seconds before you drown?<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Get up the rope.<eos> Come on.<eos> Get out of here.<eos> Come on.<eos> Your whole life passes before your eyes.<eos> And if you've lived as a true American... you get to watch it all in colour.<eos> Oh, and you will.
Just telling you something you already know. You just haven't figured it out yet.<eos> He's not slow, he's having seizures.<eos> Electro...<eos> Electroconvulsion therapy.<eos> You used it on him. That's how you reset him.<eos> No one would ever use ECT on a child.<eos> I don't know that he is having seizures. If he is, that could send him into status. It's a permanent state of seizure.<eos> Babak is my friend's son.<eos> I would never risk that.<eos> You will.
We have to get her out.<eos> Don't say anything to Mansur.<eos> Ablai!<eos> Ablai!<eos> Forgive me for not being able to call you my son for so long.<eos> I am proud of you.<eos> I did my duty.<eos> I avenged my mother.<eos> Please tell me about her.<eos> Everything... I will.
She's gonna die.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - She's on the tape.<eos> She's on the tape.<eos> She's gonna die.<eos> 'It hurts.'<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - What if I don't wake up?<eos> - You will.
Man, "Ebony and lvory" didn't work.<eos> That's a first.<eos> -Told you we should've rapped.<eos> -Stripes.<eos> Walking away isn't gonna solve anything.<eos> Who cares.<eos> Leave me alone!<eos> -We've gotta get this kid into the race.<eos> -The Chief will never go for it.<eos> Of course he will.
My bag.<eos> Keep pressure here.<eos> My bag.<eos> I need... adrenaline and a shot of... calaphar for Kaylee.<eos> I can't.<eos> River.<eos> River, I'm sorry.<eos> No.<eos> I hate to leave.<eos> You won't.
Emily, you know Elizabeth Young?<eos> You seen her come by in the last few hours?<eos> If I stepped away for a minute, you sure there's nothing you'd want to tell your daddy?<eos> I'm sure.<eos> Good girl.<eos> You can go on up to your room and play.<eos> Cute kid.<eos> Thank you.<eos> If you hear anything, you'll give me a call?<eos> I will, Sheriff.
I'm gonna coach the Tigers today. Ooh.<eos> You sure you wanna do that?<eos> How you doing, Buck?<eos> Players take the field.<eos> Good luck, Buck.<eos> Yeah.<eos> All right. Yeah, good luck.<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> May the best man win?<eos> Oh, he will.
I love it.<eos> I would love a picture of the two of us to also take to Costa Rica.<eos> Sure.<eos> Do you have a camera here?<eos> Uh... Does anyone have a camera here?<eos> No one has a camera here.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'm going...<eos> I'll go get one.<eos> I'll just...
- I don't know.<eos> I ain't never seen nobody do nothin' like that.<eos> Got a twitch or somethin'.<eos> No, Lynn, you fine.<eos> You know, like when I was at Jorge's.<eos> Shoot. You think it wasn't hard bein' the only "moniker" up in the shop?<eos> But I stuck it out, and people warmed up...<eos> And eventually, it was like, blam!<eos> I was doin' the damn thing.<eos> And so will you.
Sorry, Gina.<eos> I'm so sorry this happened to you.<eos> I can't catch a break.<eos> I just...<eos> I have Vanessa's recital tomorrow, and I have to go up in there with all o' this on my brain.<eos> It's okay, Gina.<eos> You'll get through this.<eos> - You'll get through this.<eos> - I wish that was true, Joe.<eos> You will.
- He's a priest!<eos> So what?<eos> And you know what, he was a priest when he came here, but now...<eos> I don't trust him, and I don't trust anyone else in here either!<eos> Well, that's all!<eos> That's the end of it, now stop it!<eos> You must all look inside yourselves... and that which you find there will save you!<eos> Now stop it!<eos> I'm having a drink so don't try to stop me!<eos> No, I won't.
So, I made that all up to help you out.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> But thank you for doing that.<eos> How can you tell?<eos> Well, you know, I go to school with, like, 400 guys... who are all trying to have sex.<eos> And, yeah, so I can tell who's done it.<eos> Of course.<eos> - And you really haven't? - No, I really haven't.<eos> Please don't tell your mom, okay?<eos> - Yeah, I won't.
- Why?<eos> - There are balconies.<eos> When he gets into bed... I give the signal by switching off the light.<eos> And if the bomb's too powerful and you're in the next room?<eos> Well, that won't happen.<eos> Right?<eos> Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> - Robert?<eos> It won't. No.
Well, we expected that.<eos> Lots of people in Mossad don't know about you.<eos> No one knows. So everyone's asking, "Who's killing the fedayeen?<eos> "Is it our guys?<eos> Why weren't we told?"<eos> Big egos.<eos> Lots of screaming.<eos> I can maybe include one or two of you... but excluding Mossad or the army is impossible.<eos> Accept it.<eos> We will, but our source won't.
Third time lucky.<eos> There it is, sortie, way out.<eos> What is it?<eos> Ebb tide.<eos> - It's dragging him back out.<eos> - What if he can't beat it?<eos> Can't we do anything?<eos> - He's in for the long haul.<eos> - He won't be able to last that long.<eos> Yes, he will. He won't.
Come on.<eos> The described cars...<eos> Are you still here?<eos> When I heard that you were here I couldn't stop myself.<eos> Are you some kind of a curse?<eos> Yes, a sweet curse.<eos> I know that you're in trouble because of the show.<eos> But I have a solution.<eos> If you could give me 2 minutes...<eos> I won't!
I'm jealous, OK?<eos> I don't like the idea of you making love with her. I don't like the idea of you going off island-hopping with her.<eos> It's romantic!<eos> Hey, keep your voice down.<eos> You know I make love to her.<eos> And you know it's just routine.<eos> For God's sakes, can't you wait a few weeks?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I just wanna know that something's gonna happen, you know?<eos> It will.

You want kids?<eos> - Oh, yeah. I love kids.<eos> Want that white picket fence, the whole deal.<eos> She might've been the one.<eos> She's good. She was interesting.<eos> I caught a glimpse. Something.<eos> You gotta stop obsessing about the dog-park girl, Jake.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Move on.<eos> I will.
Marta's in the hospital.<eos> Who?<eos> My wife, asshole.<eos> The one whose life I ruined.<eos> She mixed sleeping pills with alcohol.<eos> Not enough to kill herself, but enough to keep pissing me off.<eos> What are you going to do?<eos> Here's your ticket, I'll take the jeep.<eos> - Don't worry.<eos> - I won't.
Surely you are here to prevent bloodshed.<eos> Peacekeepers?<eos> No. Our mandate is very clear.<eos> We are here to monitor the peace between Hutu and Tutsi. That is all.<eos> Why did you bring all these guns?<eos> Our rules of engagement allow the use of weapons only in self-defense.<eos> In fact to use the M-2 machine gun, I must even obtain the approval of the Secretary General himsef.<eos> Our mandate is not to enforce the peace, but to monitor it.<eos> Alright Capitaine, I can understand the difference.<eos> Certainly these people won't.
I bought some shoes.<eos> You could have phoned to say so.<eos> Behave like that and you're out of here!<eos> Recep will stick a knife in your ass.<eos> - Have you seen this?<eos> - What's that, Birsu Abla?<eos> The phone bill.<eos> Since you arrived it's shot up to 100 million.<eos> - We'll share it.<eos> - No, we won't.
He's kidnapping Melek.<eos> Hey, stop you ass!<eos> When did he... son of a gun. He said he was going to buy cigarette.<eos> Hey... Stop!<eos> Hey wait...<eos> Stop!<eos> You shifty bastard, how dare you kidnap my daughter!<eos> - She's my child, too!<eos> - Let the kid go!<eos> The hell I will!
You're right.<eos> She won't be here next year like you.<eos> Whitney, will go to prom with me?<eos> Hi.<eos> Uh, Justin.<eos> I realize you're, like, the hottest girl in school.<eos> I probably shouldn't even try asking you... but a wise man once told me that the... um... the true losers in life are not who, uh, try ahn fail but those who fail to try.<eos> So, uh, you--you want t ogo to the prom with me, Whitney?<eos> Yes.<eos> You will?
Detonation.<eos> The final option.<eos> The nuclear device at the heart of the Central dome.<eos> Today, on the 21st of November, 2059, Captain Brooke activates that device, taking the base and all her crew members with her.<eos> No one ever knows why. But you were saving Earth. That's what inspires your granddaughter.<eos> She takes your people out into the galaxy because you die on Mars.<eos> You die today.<eos> She flies out there like she's trying to meet you.<eos> I won't die.<eos> I will not.
A soul without a body?<eos> He climbed up Xangô's quarry, Son.<eos> So, that 's where I must go.<eos> Hasn't your mother taught you to ask Exu's permission?<eos> I'm sorry, I didn't recognize you.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> - You goin', but you comin' back.<eos> - Sure.<eos> You'll go up, but you'll come down.<eos> I will!
I' ll never make it!<eos> Open the door.<eos> Get down.<eos> No!<eos> It' s been forever !<eos> What has?<eos> Since we were alone.<eos> Get off, will you?<eos> No, I won' t!<eos> I will not!
Business first.<eos> I believe you have something for me.<eos> I tell you, she is very delicate.<eos> Based on the Mk-54 design.<eos> But with 23 microprocessors and eight charges. Each precisely calibrated to fire within two microseconds of the next.<eos> Implosion causes the core to reach critical mass and then...<eos> Well, then you know the rest.<eos> Yeah, she should yield a 5-kiloton charge. Just like you asked.<eos> Small but powerful.<eos> Like the heart, if you will.
The sea will carry me away<eos> Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re... Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Hear the whistle blow<eos> Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Watch the smoke billow Dhadak'dhadak Dhadak'dhadak Call me, oh, watch me go...<eos> When I ride I carry in my hair... The cool whispers of the wind<eos> Ride across the earth, the sky Leave the world behind, unhinged<eos> My forehead adorned, my jewel, the moon I can't walk unnoticed amidst the stars<eos> My forehead shorn of all but the moon I can't live unnoticed up here with stars<eos> Going away, I'm going away Oh Ram Chand re...<eos> Call me, oh, watch me go... watch me go... lt's not going to come.<eos> - lt will lt won't.- lt will
Have you ever managed to do anything alone ?<eos> In any case, Bunty is nothing without Babli<eos> Get up<eos> Unlock yourselves... I can't do it...<eos> We're nearing the railway signal on the outskirts of Delhi<eos> The train halts there for two minutes<eos> The two of...<eos> The three of you can get off and go wherever you wish<eos> No one recognises Bunty and Babli except me<eos> And no one ever will
Only mindgames<eos> Pretend to die...<eos> But don't really die<eos> Please don't die<eos> Sameer... who do I have except you?<eos> But I'm here for you, am I not?<eos> I'm here for you!<eos> I'll marry you.<eos> - No, I know you won't marry me<eos> Of course, I will!

Tikku's place for the ceremonial prayers..<eos> He should definitely come<eos> Sure thing! He will definitely come..<eos> And 'distant aunt'.. you must also come<eos> For sure I will.
It does not replace your mother, but it fills me very differently.<eos> I hope that my presence will not bother you.<eos> We will spend a great summer.<eos> College, it is the foot.<eos> I had to get used to the campus and life in a new city, but New Orleans is top.<eos> Cultural life, music gastronomy ...<eos> I can not wait to return.<eos> This year, I will not be blue.<eos> What do you study?<eos> Next semester, I'll ecology, chemistry,
I needed your help.<eos> - You should have just asked for it!<eos> Would you have helped me?<eos> - No<eos> Don't do that!<eos> What?<eos> Neeeeeeeal.<eos> Don't play cute with me.<eos> It won't work.<eos> So what will?
It was wonderful, really great.<eos> I just don't get it how a man asks you to... you know, to fuck him.<eos> But it was great! He paid a lot of money.<eos> - Was it worth it for the money?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> I'm not satisfied with money only. I want more than that.<eos> - I'd trade the money for a man. - I want more than money too.<eos> - I want jewelry, I want...<eos> - That just won't happen.<eos> - Yes, it will.
I just want you to look at my face, into my eyes... and tell me that you have nothing to do with this painter.<eos> You look at me!<eos> My life's already too complicated.<eos> Who do you think you are... to come to my place at this hour and speculate about my life?<eos> You don't even know me that well.<eos> - Go away! We'll talk tomorrow.<eos> - No way!<eos> You don't want me to go. You want to hear what I have to say about you. Better yet, about that painting and this painter... and just as you wanted it, uncompliant, right?<eos> - I don't want to hear anymore!<eos> - But you will, Inês.
I forgot my backpack.<eos> Well then, skedaddle!<eos> I forgot my backpack.<eos> Nothing else?<eos> We're coming!<eos> Got everything?<eos> Tickets, backpacks, good spirits?<eos> Change trains in Lucerne and make sure that all your bikes reach Langnau.<eos> When you're next in Zurich, look us up.<eos> Sure we will.
Usually he's quicker than any of us.<eos> Yes. Jumping into the river after you.<eos> What'll we tell Wrigley's mom if we come home without him?<eos> She thinks we're his friends.<eos> What next?<eos> Fritzli took the chock from under the chestnut-vendor's stall, it crashed into a railing and sent the chestnuts flying.<eos> Did Fritzli never tell you this?<eos> No.<eos> And here's a really good one.<eos> He never will.
- But you thought it.<eos> Your thoughts are against me.<eos> It's freezing.<eos> What a night.<eos> There's no moon.<eos> It's going to snow again.<eos> We lovers are lying here in the snow in Marona.<eos> Did you know there is such a village?<eos> There'll never be a night like this again.<eos> There will.
Just call her.<eos> - Does it work?<eos> - Sure.<eos> Move your ass and make her your girl!<eos> You lose this crucial moment, you'll lose her forever!<eos> In case any hot son of a bitch makes his move on her... this game is over for you, period!<eos> Okay, you can join the others for lunch.<eos> Call her.<eos> His plan does work?<eos> Probably it will.
So... That's more Mercurochrome, healing ointment and bear's gall bladder<eos> Yes, please<eos> What is Santa bringing you?<eos> A baseball board game<eos> That's great I wonder if Santa's really coming<eos> Sure he will<eos> What do you think, Honey?<eos> I bet he won't this year He only visits good kids<eos> He won't come, then<eos> Yes he will!

You rascals!<eos> You almost gave me a heart attack.<eos> Now we're even.<eos> That should be a lesson for you.<eos> Don't forget!<eos> If you sow wind, you'll gather storm.<eos> I won't forget that.<eos> Let me kiss your hand.<eos> Don't forget your promise!<eos> I won't!
It's Behrooz.<eos> Answer it.<eos> Hello?<eos> Are you almost here?<eos> Yes.<eos> I didn't; I just left.<eos> He was busy working.<eos> What are we going to do?<eos> Wherever we go, he'll find us.<eos> No, he won't.
Please, don't treat these people disrespectfully.<eos> Please don't tell me what to do!<eos> I'll stop telling you what to do when you stop behaving like a child.<eos> What?<eos> You heard me.<eos> There are other people in this world besides you and they have problems, too.<eos> Now, are you gonna get a grip on yourself or am I going to have to call security and have them restrain you?<eos> You're pathetic, you know that?<eos> I will not allow you to talk to me like this.<eos> I will not!
Our vehicle's five minutes away.<eos> Then we'll see you in five minutes.<eos> That should keep them busy.<eos> What do you want to do about bauer?<eos> As soon as we have Behrooz... we kill Bauer.<eos> Who's going to protect me?<eos> We are.<eos> That's why we put trackers on you.<eos> You don't think Marwan will find them?<eos> He will.
- You know what my dad's like.<eos> He's nothing.<eos> He's a big.angry nothing. and that's exactly what he wants me to be. and I can't let that happen.<eos> Now.goddamn it.do something!<eos> It's no good.is it?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> I'm sorry.Greg.<eos> not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.<eos> You'll find a place.<eos> Sure I will.
We tried everything.<eos> Radiation, bone marrow transplants...<eos> Is he really cured ?<eos> Take him back to his doctor. Run some tests.<eos> Peter's leukemia is gone.<eos> This is a miracle.<eos> For now, it has to remain a private miracle.<eos> May i remind you that the confidentiality agreement you've signed is strictly binding.<eos> But people should know about that young man.<eos> And they will.
You just called me "mommy."<eos> You're my mom now, right ?<eos> Now and forever.<eos> - I like that.<eos> So do you think i'll ever go back to school ?<eos> Weren't you just telling me you got, like, a 97 on your math test ?<eos> Not home-school.<eos> Real school,<eos> With a playground, and recess.<eos> Well, sure you will...
I was hoping we could talk about our mother.<eos> Did you bring your passport?<eos> Our mother was killed.<eos> I found her body in a state medical facility.<eos> I identified her, paid for her release, made arrangements with the mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born.<eos> I thought she'd want it that way.<eos> And you have no idea who was responsible?<eos> Who killed her?<eos> I swear to God, somehow, I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.<eos> I will.
Uh, your memo stated you had urgent information about a dirty bomb.<eos> This is a dirty bomb!<eos> A dirty bomb that goes offing your pants.<eos> - And it killed me inside!<eos> - It killed the boy inside!<eos> We must take action!<eos> Well, we're not having much luck catching the real monstrous enemies.<eos> And a good media crusade is always a solid vote-getter.<eos> I'll accept nothing less than total authority... over the entire country's communication system.<eos> - We'll giveyou one town
My record is 6,043 to 0.<eos> Ever hear the one about the fella who died, went to the pearly gates?<eos> St. Peter let him in.<eos> Sees a guy in a suit making a closing argument.<eos> Says, "Who's that?" St. Peter says...<eos> "Oh, that's God.<eos> Thinks he's Denny Crane."<eos> I'm your boy, Walter.<eos> Never lost.<eos> Never will.
- To do research.<eos> - Okay.<eos> If person breaks the law or takes the law into his or her hands... in order to save someone, say a kidnapped child... what is the exposure, either civil or criminal?<eos> - I need the answer 1 O minutes ago.<eos> Go.<eos> - My lawyer dropped me.<eos> - Bugger.<eos> - If you think you won-<eos> - I do. - I'll find another one.<eos> - No, you won't.
I just got the call.<eos> - Where's Grissom ?<eos> - Bathroom.<eos> Working the case.<eos> Hand me my multi-tool, will ya, Greg ? I need a Phillips.<eos> What are you doing ?<eos> Well, the stabbing was brutal, but the crime scene is clean.<eos> No cast-off, no spatter.<eos> So, I want to know if the killer washed blood down the drain.<eos> Swab and phenol this, will ya ?
So I take off.<eos> I heard two shots.<eos> He killed him.<eos> That's it.<eos> It's his word against mine.<eos> Now, who are you gonna believe, a felon, or someone who catches them ?<eos> I will believe the evidence.<eos> Well, good luck with that.<eos> 'Cause last I checked, you didn't have any.<eos> But I will, Mr. Merrick, I will.
Hold on to Franklin tight, baby.<eos> Okay, Mommy, I will.
Felt like it was all good.<eos> Okay.<eos> What about me and you? We good?<eos> We'll see.<eos> We'll see.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> You just talked to Danny about the eval?<eos> You like it?<eos> Hopefully my date will, too.
But I can't.<eos> No one can.<eos> Belyakov means to kill me.<eos> He's a broken down, half-dead old man.<eos> Until his last breath... he is extremely dangerous.<eos> He ain't gonna hurt you. I promise.<eos> What if you're wrong?<eos> I ain't wrong.<eos> If you're wrong... will you protect me?<eos> Yeah, I will.
The problem is the Avatars have insulated themselves now.<eos> Only the sisters can get to them, and only you can reach the sisters.<eos> I'm not going after Leo again.<eos> - Paige'll kill me.<eos> - He's not the only Avatar.<eos> They're never gonna let me use the potion.<eos> - Well, we can help that.<eos> - If we work together.<eos> I can't.<eos> You will.
Now, how many other suspects did the police show you?<eos> Did you view a lineup or a photo array?<eos> No.<eos> The truth is you only saw one man, and at the time, he was under arrest in handcuffs being led to a police car.<eos> It was him.<eos> Clearly, you believe that.<eos> She did the best she could.<eos> You saw the jury.<eos> They didn't know whether to trust the ID.<eos> They will.
I didn't know you did yoga.<eos> Oh yeah, just get back into it.<eos> - I have a private class at home on saturday.<eos> - Oh, that's great.<eos> Can you believe I've never done yoga before ?<eos> You should come on saturday. - Oh.<eos> - Yeah, join in.<eos> Mickey's joining.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Well, we will.
-My nanny<eos> My mom's kind of busy today want to see something cool?<eos> Sure<eos> This's wrong,see?<eos> It says "united sates" not "united states"<eos> My mom will fix that<eos> She's the president now<eos> You know,you're never gonna see her again<eos> Huh?<eos> You just won't
She heard your voice on the answering machine... you told her you were in the library... that you were studying... and she smiled when you said that.<eos> She did ?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You told her that you loved her.<eos> And then she picked up a picture of you... and she held it.<eos> Sarah, your voice... was the last thing that your mother heard.<eos> It was your words, "I love you,"... she held inside her heart... the moment that she passed.<eos> What more could a person want, right ?<eos> If only I could make him understand.<eos> He will.
That is his handwriting, isn't it?<eos> You know what I think?<eos> Rex felt guilty for the way he treated you.<eos> The adultery, the public humiliations.<eos> That's why he forgave you.<eos> He understood why you did it.<eos> How can he have believed this?<eos> Look, my wife cheated on me, too.<eos> I know how much it hurts.<eos> And so will the judge.
Behind door number one... is an "Aquaman" check with two million little fishies on it.<eos> Hopefully, this will take care of your delinquent heating and electric bills.<eos> - We'll take door number one.<eos> - Wait wait wait.<eos> Let's take a moment to celebrate how far we've come, all right?<eos> First check I ever got for you... $668 for what?<eos> - A guest star on "JAG."<eos> - Guest star on "JAG," - and I did not take commission.<eos> - No, you did not.<eos> - This time I will.
You did this.<eos> Didn't you?<eos> I had some help.<eos> You're amazing, you know that.<eos> I love you so much.<eos> I know you do.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Uh, nothing, it's just party planning's surprisingly stressful.<eos> You do realize I haven't actually gotten into the school yet, right?<eos> And you will.
But, as you know, I have erectile dysfunction.<eos> - There we go.<eos> - Thank you, Arthur.<eos> Brian, will you carry me upstairs?<eos> I want to look at my toys.<eos> - No. I'm watching television.<eos> - Come on! I'm sick!<eos> All right.<eos> Todd, I feel like we'll never have a baby of our own.<eos> We will, Kelly.
Don'T... let me go.<eos> I can't do this without you.<eos> That's why I have to go.<eos> What is he saying?<eos> What... he's leaving.<eos> Gwen, he's crossing over.<eos> Wait until after I go,and then tell her when she thinks of all the things we did... it'll remind her that love is possible.<eos> Conor...what?<eos> She'll find it again.<eos> I will.
Can you...<eos> Can you talk to my wife?<eos> Can you let me see her?<eos> I wish I could.<eos> But I can only see spirits who haven't crossed over yet.<eos> Crossed over where?<eos> Into the light.<eos> Does my son know how I died?<eos> Just that you were reported MIA.<eos> Will you...
I'll be the dealer.<eos> Chip Lacey mentioned something about it. Yeah, he's in, and Snake Eyes, too.<eos> But, you see, I had to get them in, otherwise Richie wouldn't be interested.<eos> I could have done with more time... but his father told me it'll be the last drop he gives to Richie.<eos> So I had to find a good player, and fast.<eos> So, what are you saying?<eos> I want to get you in the game. I'll put in half of the £25,000 sit-down money.<eos> You put in the other half, then give me 10% of your winnings... and you get to keep everything else.<eos> -What if I lose?<eos> -Well, you won't.
We'll take you clubbin'.<eos> Have you been down to Floorgasm?<eos> - What is it? - A club.<eos> Loads of ladies.<eos> Loads of bustin' tunes.<eos> - I like music.<eos> - It'll be a laugh.<eos> Come out clubbing.<eos> OK, yeah.<eos> OK, I will, yeah.
Stop it!<eos> I'll take him outside.<eos> Unstoppable.<eos> For two... and another two.<eos> What could I possibly say to him, Tom?<eos> It has to be a miracle, and if he wants to tell the world about it, he should.<eos> I'm left-handed.<eos> - But who would believe him?<eos> - The faithful.<eos> No, they won't.
How'd you do this ?<eos> I was, um...<eos> I was trying to unscrew a light bulb.<eos> So you're going to the meeting tonight ?<eos> - Hmm, I think so.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Would you mind giving me a lift ?<eos> Well, you know, I just don't think I should drive.<eos> - We should have found it by now.<eos> - We will.
If you're not interested, I'm sure the police will be.<eos> Greg.<eos> Would you get her out of here?<eos> It's a complete lie. I believe you.<eos> I just thought it better that I hear it from you what really happened.<eos> What happened was nothing.<eos> This woman, Monica, I didn't even know what her name was... was drunk off of her ass in Mystique.<eos> You can ask Delinda.<eos> She'll tell you.<eos> I will.
He's just really shy.<eos> Hey, little man.<eos> Well, I guess I can't call you that, I mean, because look how big you are.<eos> So, you and I, we're not gonna see each other for a while, Walt.<eos> But you are gonna have a great life.<eos> I know your mommy, she's going to take real good care of you.<eos> And Brian is gonna take good care of you, too.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I just want you to know that no matter where you go, I... That your daddy... Yeah, your daddy, he loves you very, very much.<eos> And I always will.
Jin, I need you to go to the caves and get Jack, okay?<eos> You understand?<eos> We need Jack.<eos> Jack.<eos> Doctor.<eos> Yes. Yes, the doctor.<eos> Please come here.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> Oh, no, no, honey.<eos> I won't.
But you're awake now.<eos> There's no castle, there's no ogre.<eos> So you're telling me it doesn't mean anything.<eos> I have no way of knowing that.<eos> It's just...<eos> Most dreams...<eos> Most dreams don't mean anything.<eos> Once in a great while, certain people will have a dream, and... and then when they're awake, they'll see things in their life that remind them of their dream.<eos> Has that ever happened to you?<eos> Sure, once in a while, I'll...
What are you going to do?<eos> Obviously, he's not afraid of ghosts.<eos> He's not afraid of flickering lights or music.<eos> But if someone, or something, was to blow out the pilot light in the old stove in our kitchen,<eos> and James were to have a cold, not smell the gas,<eos> let it fill the room and James were to light a cigarette...<eos> I wonder what those sirens are all about?<eos> Do you smell something?<eos> Don't forget to bring home those names and that phone number.<eos> I won't, Daddy.
Let him go, baby.<eos> Just let him go.<eos> It's a quarter past.<eos> She said she'd be here at 4:00.<eos> It's called making us sweat.<eos> Look, we don't know why Miss Rivers is coming.<eos> It may have nothing to do with the face mask.<eos> And if it does, we'll just play dumb and tell her to talk to our lawyer.<eos> - We have a lawyer?<eos> - We will.
- Carpeting, very lush.<eos> - It's private.<eos> - And the price?<eos> You can't beat it.<eos> - It's great, Sandy.<eos> It's perfect.<eos> I mean, it'll be fine for the next 48 hours.<eos> It might take me a little longer than that to figure out how to take on your case.<eos> You are?<eos> You will?
I'm so sorry.<eos> Haley, I can't do this.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You need to go, all right?<eos> Please.<eos> I understand... if you don't love me anymore.<eos> Always and forever.<eos> That's what sucks, Haley.<eos> I still do love you.<eos> I always will.
Once the judge hears my side of things, it's not gonna matter if you're there or not.<eos> You know it.<eos> Do you know how it feels, Jake? Knowing that you'll never see your daughter again? Knowing that she'll never be a part of your life?<eos> You'll never see her walk... hear her laugh or watch her grow.<eos> Goodbye, Nikki.<eos> Goodbye, Jake.<eos> Oh, one more thing. Yeah.<eos> The next time you wanna hide my daughter... you've gotta do better that Florida.<eos> Do you know how it feels, Jake? Never to see your daughter again?<eos> Because you will. Nikki!
I'll go with you!<eos> - No, you can't. - But...<eos> Peyton.<eos> Why not?<eos> I mean, what's the point of school and grades and all of this if I'm not...<eos> God Jake, I can't be without you, I love you!<eos> You're meant for better.<eos> - I'm not! - You are. Hey, look, I don't know, maybe I'll find Jenny sooner than later.<eos> Maybe I'll be back-<eos> You won't!
I don't.<eos> I guess the key is, just finding someone who feels the same way you do.<eos> In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School created a time capsule which was to be opened in fifty years.<eos> They were simply asked to talk about their lives.<eos> Isn't it interesting how things haven't changed much?<eos> Within the next week, each of you will go into our converted supply closet... push the green button in front of you... and videotape your thoughts.<eos> Do we have to?<eos> Yes, you have to.<eos> I won't see it.<eos> Nobody will.
You blame me for my moms.<eos> She had a stroke 15,000 miles away.<eos> And it's still my fault.<eos> Jesus, man.<eos> Look, man. Look, I just- I've had it, a'ight?<eos> Just-Just b-back up off me, man.<eos> Mind if we say what we came to say?<eos> Yeah!<eos> I don't wanna hear no advice.<eos> You won't.
The graveyard.<eos> Lucas, what are you doing?<eos> Unlock these cuffs!<eos> Lucas, what is this place?<eos> Lucas, you're in a state right now... but once you calm down you will see everything I did was to help you.<eos> Did you see how evil she got because of me? Lucas!<eos> Lucas, look at me!<eos> We play these games, but you know I love you.<eos> I love you too, Holly.<eos> I always will.
- Well, I guess I better-<eos> - Stay with me.<eos> - Paula.<eos> - Please.<eos> You did that.<eos> You got in my head, and you made me try to hurt Paula.<eos> Christina, if I could make you do things... I wouldn't have bought a house here- I'd just be renting.<eos> None of this would have happened if you hadrt set it up that way.<eos> Maybe not tonight, but it would have happened.<eos> It still will.
Somebody hurts you, they get hurt.<eos> We're all basically bad.<eos> That's the truth, Christina.<eos> There is something pure in her.<eos> - If she really finds faith-<eos> - So we make sure that doesn't happen.<eos> Jesse!<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> - We have to fix this.<eos> - We will.

Justin's probably too modest to show you. Justin's probably too modest to show you.<eos> That's pretty impressive. That's pretty impressive.<eos> He says the house you bought is pretty impressive too. He says the house you bought is pretty impressive too.<eos> A swimming pool, stables... A swimming pool, stables...<eos> He's gonna have a fucking fabulous time He's gonna have a fucking fabulous time when he comes to visit his old man. when he comes to visit his old man.<eos> He could still have a fabulous time when he visits his old man during the summer. during the summer.<eos> Your keeping us here isn't gonna make up for lost opportunities. Your keeping us here isn't gonna make up for lost opportunities.<eos> I want another chance.<eos> I want him to know who I am.<eos> He will.
Sorry, we're ghosts now.<eos> Our spirits live in those two trees.<eos> Or, maybe we're alive and we just feel like jerking' you around.<eos> Or maybe we're one of each.<eos> Look, I'm not taking the scholarship.<eos> You're the one who deserves to go to Yale.<eos> That's so noble.<eos> But what about Jenda?<eos> Hey, I'm waiting till I find a girl who likes me for me.<eos> And you will.
Yeah, mom, you're right, that's it.<eos> And let us not forget, you just had a miscarriage.<eos> Well, I really don't see what that's got to do with it.<eos> Honey, you're still in shock.<eos> I'm so glad that you're more in tune With my emotional state than me.<eos> Well, I'm a very good psychologist.<eos> - I was being sarcastic.<eos> - I know that as well.<eos> Well, don't forget to send me a bill for $200.<eos> Oh, I won't.
I think she's old enough to know her story, And how I came to be her mommy.<eos> There's something I've always wanted to ask.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Lisa's brother-in-law, what was his name?<eos> Hoyt.<eos> Did they ever determine for certain If he was involved in Lisa's death?<eos> - Dad...<eos> - No no, it's all right. It's okay.<eos> Uh... Look, with both Lisa and Hoyt dead, they don't know for sure.<eos> - And no one ever will.
I won't let you make the same mistake!<eos> Mom.<eos> Oh, my little girl.<eos> Maya, are you okay?<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> She's so beautiful.<eos> Hi. We've never met.<eos> I'm Nathaniel.<eos> I love her so much.<eos> And I always will.
(whispers) sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> (whimpers) sorry!<eos> Maria: (over speaker) miss fanshaw and mr. Breedlove,<eos> (knocks) henry? Can I have a word please?<eos> You see? You see what you've done?<eos> He's not coming out!<eos> He's coming out.<eos> Ellen: I wouldn't.<eos> He will. He won't!
Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?<eos> But is it safe?<eos> Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?<eos> No.<eos> Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.<eos> What?<eos> Better to have you on the outside, in case something goes wrong.<eos> - It won't!<eos> - But if it does.<eos> - It won't!
We have to tell them not to dial Earth.<eos> How?<eos> Even if we had the kind of power needed to dial Atlantis, we couldn't, because that would detonate the bomb.<eos> What about the Daedalus?<eos> It's on a return voyage to the milky way.<eos> We could use them to relay the trans...<eos> Oh, no... I mean, wait.<eos> God, there's no way they're close enough, even with our long-range transmitters.<eos> You'll find another way to get the message to them.<eos> I will? Of course you will.
Well, because the second part sends the bastard back to hell. Once and for all.<eos> First things first we gotta find it.<eos> Don't do that!<eos> - Anything?<eos> No, nothing, how much time we got?<eos> 15 minutes.<eos> Maybe we missed somebody.<eos> Maybe the thing is just not on the plane.<eos> You believe that?<eos> Well, I will, if you will.
Yes.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> Ranger...<eos> Wilkinson.<eos> Well, I will tell you exactly what I told her.<eos> Her brother filled out a backcountry permit saying he wouldn't be back from Black Water until the 24th.<eos> So it's not exactly a missing persons now, is it?<eos> Tell that girl to quit worrying.<eos> I'm sure her brother's just fine.<eos> We will.
Savannah! I mean, Iet's not give them an excuse to stay, you know.<eos> Hey, is your brother up yet?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He even dressed himself.<eos> Come on, we'II miss our plane.<eos> Okay. You're the adult while we're gone, understand?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> Okay, you and miles have a second chance to prove you can be on your own here.<eos> Okay, Iet's not blow it.<eos> We won't, Dad. Good.
I'm his "chick."<eos> Jackie, he's a man.<eos> Accept the fact that he is not coming back.<eos> When I was in labor, Red went to get me ice chips.<eos> I didn't see him for an hour and a half because he found a pinball machine.<eos> No way.<eos> But it's fine.<eos> Ha. I laugh about it now.<eos> I do.<eos> I will.
She says she's gonna mail that stuff tomorrow.<eos> Great.<eos> Veronica?<eos> Could you arrange a visitation with my dad?<eos> For the first time I can remember, I really want to talk to him.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Sure, uh, it may take a few days.<eos> Just long enough to get the proof of the Kane payoff.<eos> Shouldn't you be getting ready for your Achiever Dinner?<eos> Scholastic Excellence, I will.
I don't think so.<eos> They had weapons of mass destruction!<eos> There were no weapons of mass destruction!<eos> No?<eos> Well, whatever.<eos> Look, I've got a lot of shit to do.<eos> You name me one thing you have to do that's more important than the corporate takeover of our democracy!<eos> I gotta take a shit.<eos> You gotta help me, man.<eos> I will, I will.
Why don't you tell me what happened?<eos> I went to Gavin's Garage and made them take down the ad.<eos> Good. That's great.<eos> But it's been up for two days.<eos> And I'm terrified to go home.<eos> I've already had two guys knock on my window and I keep getting these disgusting phone calls.<eos> That idiot at Gavin's Garage let someone put up that ad and he needs to pay.<eos> You probably have a very good case against them.<eos> - Will you help me?<eos> - Yeah, of course I will.
What the hell is wrong with all of you?<eos> You're tired, Jack.<eos> Go home.<eos> You're late.<eos> I've been looking for you.<eos> Well, here I am.<eos> I thought they took you away.<eos> Not yet.<eos> Well, I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Well, I'm impressed.<eos> Very impressed.<eos> Sokka...<eos> I'm coming with you.<eos> You're not old enough to go to war, Sokka, you know that.<eos> I'm strong! I'm brave! I can fight!<eos> Please, Dad!<eos> Being a man is knowing where you're needed the most... and for you right now that's here protecting your sister.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> Someday you will.
We got it away from the girls.<eos> That's what matters.<eos> But now the right thing to do isn't using it ourselves, then we're no better than they are.<eos> Think of the power!<eos> It's too much power.<eos> For anybody. Stan's right.<eos> It has to be destroyed.<eos> Are we sure about this?<eos> We'll never know the future.<eos> Nobody will.
Wake up.<eos> Open your eyes.<eos> No.<eos> I do you a solid, you do me one.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> Tell Hook about Mary.<eos> Tell the old woman.<eos> - They'll hear you, if you make them.<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> You will.
I did not ever think I have a wife.<eos> I was too busy as a professor at Oxford.<eos> Anyway, I hoped.<eos> Oh, but it does not matter.<eos> I promised your father I'll take care of you.<eos> I always thought ... I like to leave your wealth to people Your waiting around to die.<eos> So I thought I'd pass my money and properties in your name now.<eos> - No, I can not.<eos> I will not!<eos> - Yes, you will.
No butler, Your Lordship? Not even a houseboy? Very fashionable.<eos> Even Harry Starks has a houseboy or two.<eos> In fact, it was this lad Craig I hoped to have a word with.<eos> The lad who lives here.<eos> Your son, is it?<eos> Or have I got that wrong?<eos> Nephew?<eos> Friend?<eos> Don't forget who I am.<eos> Oh, I won't.
Perhaps then we could see a little more of each other.<eos> Aren't you forgetting my husband?<eos> I never forget anything, Mrs. Crawley.<eos> Least of all an unpaid debt.<eos> She hasn't been at all well, has she?<eos> Must I go?<eos> Must I really?<eos> Can't I stay if I promise to be good?<eos> It won't be for long, old chap.<eos> Yes, it will.
I love you.<eos> My Timmy.<eos> Mom.<eos> Choking.<eos> Not breathing.<eos> And people wonder why I have issues.<eos> I'll be OK.<eos> I know you will.<eos> - Be careful.<eos> - I will.
Aleksic!<eos> - Hey, Luka...<eos> Old pal, where you been?<eos> I have to ask you something. You're my only hope.<eos> Me, your only hope?<eos> If a soldier's your only hope you're really in bad shape.<eos> It's about the war. She's bugging me.<eos> She says he's going to war, not basic training.<eos> There won't be a war.<eos> There won't?
I don't want this to ever end.<eos> Again with that word "end". It's a myth.<eos> - That is a lie.<eos> - Don't be selfish, Melanie.<eos> When you make the leap at the big top, time in the Dust Factory ends.<eos> - Let Ryan decide.<eos> Dust.<eos> I hate it.<eos> I don't wanna jump.<eos> And I never will!
- No.<eos> - Damage anything?<eos> - No.<eos> Kind of nice in there?<eos> No.<eos> Oh, man, they got a basketball court!<eos> He's beautiful, isn't he?<eos> I just want him to have everything I never had.<eos> I know you do.<eos> And he will.
Bert, she's not a little girl anymore.<eos> What are you reading?<eos> José Martí.<eos> It was my father's.<eos> We got rid of all his books just to be safe, but... I kept this one.<eos> Hello.<eos> - Javier?<eos> - Yeah?<eos> - If we don't win the finals--<eos> - We will.
I'n afraid you gotta close it down.<eos> Dig your way out.<eos> I'n sorry, Howard.<eos> I truly an.<eos> Reel 1 0, Mr. Hughes.<eos> Mortgage Tool Co.<eos> -Every asset.<eos> You heard ne.<eos> -lf you do that, you could lose everything.<eos> Well, I won't.
lqbal-bhai... have some food.<eos> You'll die of starvation<eos> The cops have a bad name anyway.<eos> You're the one who'll die... and it'll be our funeral!<eos> Stop bothering me. Eat it up<eos> Mhatre... why're you pestering him?<eos> - He refuses to eat<eos> He'll eat when he's hungry.<eos> Hey... you want something to eat?<eos> No, he won't.
Give it some time and then you'll see.<eos> Will you be all right?<eos> You're the one i should ask that.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> He left. But he seemed calmer.<eos> He's right.<eos> I'll end up all alone.<eos> I'm going to be 38.<eos> I don't have children.<eos> And i never will.
Don't you remember what happened last time?<eos> Though they're both from the same team Arjun and Ranvir are competing for the number one position<eos> Both cars are moving neck to neck<eos> Like every year, we've lost again!<eos> And Arjun who got caught in a spin and whirlwind of dust... emerges at number two position<eos> Hey!<eos> A drink for Arjun! Banna, tell me some thing.<eos> Why is it that you always win and I don't? Your sole purpose is to defeat me and mine is to win!<eos> - Whether it's a rally or the race of life... when you are focused on winning...<eos> you will
It's no good.<eos> Pull 'em out.<eos> Tell Linda I love her that I loved her from the second I saw her.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Yeah, I hear you.<eos> Promise to take care of my kids.<eos> Tell them that I'm always with them.<eos> You tell... You tell them that.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I will.
And I deserve to have some fun.<eos> - That's right.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I am gonna go to that dance.<eos> - Okay, great.<eos> And I am gonna meet my true love and I'm gonna dance all night.<eos> - I can't go.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't have a costume.<eos> - But you will.
I don't have an outfit that goes with that.<eos> Yeah, but I do.<eos> Rhonda, you sure do have a knack for taking something simple and making it beautiful.<eos> Well, you ain't seen nothing yet.<eos> I was saving this dress for my next attempt down the aisle.<eos> Long story.<eos> It's beautiful.<eos> - Rhonda, I can't wear that.<eos> - Yes, you can.<eos> And you will.
- It broke.<eos> Baby, come to mama!<eos> - Did you fall? - Lousy damn bike!<eos> The kick-start packed up.<eos> - What are you gonna do?<eos> - Let's tie it. - You're all useless.<eos> - Tie it to the back.<eos> We'll never see the end of this!<eos> - Will it hold, Oscar?<eos> - Of course it will.
I made a decision.<eos> Game...<eos> Miss Bradbury.<eos> Miss Bradbury wins final set.<eos> Me too.<eos> No. No. Hi.<eos> - Now, listen.<eos> It's not what you think, so don't start...<eos> I'll jump. I'll jump.<eos> I will.
I expect that you're aware of our dilemma with the so-called slave army?<eos> Along with the rest of the world.<eos> I have concluded that the slave general, Spartacus,<eos> - intends to leave by sea.<eos> - Why would you conclude that?<eos> Because it's all he can do.<eos> And because he seems to show an inordinate interest in plunder, leading me to wonder what he is planning to buy or whom.<eos> I'm afraid I can't help you.<eos> Yes, you can.<eos> You will.
Leave us alone this fucking time!<eos> Ow!<eos> Man, what are you doing here?<eos> She ain't got no hair down there at all, does she?<eos> She's all smooth like a fucking candy.<eos> Man, you're scaring the poor girl.<eos> Please. Sorry.<eos> Didn't mean to scare you.<eos> Yeah, I bet you say that to all the girls just before you throw their lifeless bodies into the lake.<eos> - Will you... - Otto?
We found them on her body.<eos> She was still wired up when she was killed.<eos> Guess sometimes you just get lucky on an investigation, huh?<eos> - You're sure you're okay with this?<eos> - Can't wait.<eos> It's only until we're inside. Across the threshold, so to speak.<eos> Till you've hid your girlfriend's knickers, you mean.<eos> - Look, I know how this looks.<eos> - So do we, Veil.<eos> So will the jury.
Isabel, your daddy...<eos> My daddy is the best daddy in the world.<eos> He had a really big meeting one day... but instead, he took me horseback riding.<eos> He would read me stories before bed every night.<eos> Sometimes he would make it up as he went along... and I knew, but I didn't care.<eos> Your mom said I was here to talk about your dad.<eos> But we don't have to do that if you don't want.<eos> I don't want.<eos> OK.<eos> Then we won't.
Here we survive selling lingerie, TV sets, stationery... In the mall, those are the only profitable stores.<eos> She's getting by...<eos> That business is doomed.<eos> It's the cancer of every mall.<eos> Osvaldo is the one who's doomed.<eos> Rita will survive.<eos> He won't have to close.<eos> No, no, no, no, he's not closing<eos> I think he'll have to sell out.<eos> No, he won't.
I forget and start living.<eos> Say.<eos> Say you'll do it.<eos> Come on, please.<eos> Say.<eos> Speak now.<eos> Come on.<eos> You can.<eos> Say.<eos> I will.
The wedding invitations have been sent out. - She and Andrew make a fine pair, I think.<eos> - Yes, they do. She's very set on it, you know.<eos> Clarisse, my dear. Forget the wedding for a moment.<eos> In less than a month, you will no longer be queen, and I will no longer be your head of security.<eos> I think it's time we bring our friendship out of the shadows.<eos> - Yes. Yes, my dear. I would kneel if it weren't for my knee replacement.<eos> Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned. Mia needs to win over the people of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.<eos> Perhaps it's time to consider the duty you have to yourself.<eos> My darling, please think about it.<eos> I will.
She's coming.<eos> -Great.<eos> Your dad's coming too.<eos> The party will be ruined.<eos> Don't you want him to see what you've achieved?<eos> Why don't you reconcile with him?<eos> Not for him, but for yourself.<eos> I'm getting a drink. Auntie Jet.<eos> So when are you going to tell him?<eos> -I will.
Yes!<eos> Can you see them?<eos> We are surrounded.<eos> The Hebalonians are just beyond the forest.<eos> I told you, we should have killed him.<eos> Summon our men.<eos> Hal.<eos> They must have a special route.<eos> We'll never get in there alive.<eos> Oh yes we will.
CHARLES ll: Does not the Earl provide?<eos> The Earl is not one of life's providers.<eos> But the King is.<eos> If you want the best, you may receive it from me.<eos> I shall be everything you wish me to be.<eos> I wish you to be my eyes and ears on his earlship.<eos> I am his lover.<eos> But I am your true subject.<eos> Then you'll serve me in this matter?<eos> Yes, I will.
is it a promised flower? .<eos> is it the weight of betrayal?<eos> The muzzle is right before me, anytime and anywhere.<eos> Whatever I say, I cannot trust the sky or my fingers.<eos> There is a pistol on the table.<eos> Yes, there is.<eos> is it a promised flower? .<eos> is it the weight of betrayal?<eos> I will find it if I'm looking.<eos> Yes, I will.
You'll have the money tomorrow.<eos> All right.<eos> Wager on a lout if you want!<eos> As long as I have money to drink...<eos> Kid, come and lend me a hand.<eos> Right, I'm going now.<eos> Hold on, take the base stone too.<eos> Why?<eos> What if the corpse rises back up?<eos> It won't.
Sixteen cameras.<eos> All new.<eos> Pretty hard. Sharp images.<eos> The aim is to get in the safe.<eos> 500, 000 Euro gets delivered to the bank every day.<eos> It's all black, not recorded and in small notes.<eos> The nice thing is that, as soon as the money is in the safe it's left unguarded for three minutes.<eos> So the money's already ours.<eos> How would you get in?<eos> We won't. You will.
She told me herself in front of the cops.<eos> She asked me not to tell the kids.<eos> What shall I do?<eos> - You got to tell them the truth. - I know.<eos> What's gonna happen to her?<eos> She's got to go to court in the morning.<eos> Copper gave me the name of a solicitor.<eos> - Gonna go around there first thing.<eos> - I'll come with you.<eos> - Yeah? - 'Course, I will.
- Hallbera, don't keep me waiting.<eos> Fire will rain down from the sky very soon.<eos> - And the light of that fire... will reveal your destiny.<eos> So far from home.<eos> What destiny could i have here?<eos> After the fire a man will come, a man as strong as you.<eos> The warrior's strengh will match your own.<eos> He'll even beat you in battle.<eos> No one's ever done that before.<eos> No one else ever will.
Yeah, that's it. That's exactly it. Without Rosemary.<eos> So, have you started your new job?<eos> Yes, I sell clothes for active women at printemps.<eos> It's a department store, but I get the weekends off.<eos> Printemps?<eos> Somehow, I can't imagine you.<eos> It's better than nothing for now.<eos> You'll find something you love. You'll find something else.<eos> I hope so.<eos> Oh, you will.
Go away, Teodoro, I never want to see you again! Go away!<eos> What's the matter?<eos> - Go away!<eos> - What's the matter?<eos> Take your things and leave, for the love of Jesus.<eos> I won't let the devil into my house, go away!<eos> Open the door, Terezinha I can explain.<eos> The devil will not triumph, go away.<eos> - Open this door!<eos> - I won't, I won't, devil.
To poison the innocent fetus is a great sin.<eos> So, to get the wife back one should poison the child?<eos> Don't be scared. I'II clap my hands and it'II die.<eos> And the wife will throw it away, dead.<eos> - You'II take that sin upon you.<eos> - well, I don't...<eos> will you take it?<eos> - The sin?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - I will.
He loved me, understand?<eos> He loved me like crazy!<eos> We can't understand the thoughts of a person who's dying! It's a totally different state of mind.<eos> Two people who belong to each other but can't be together.<eos> Suddenly you realize it's the end, and you'll never experience love again...<eos> - Who knows what's in store for us?<eos> Time is running out.<eos> Perhaps we should enjoy it more.<eos> Will you be gentle with me?<eos> Of course I will...
Well, sir, I'd likes to become the welterweight champion of the world.<eos> And I challenge the Motor City Cobra Thomas "Hit Man" Hearns to fight me for the welterweight championship of the whole world!<eos> Yo, Flip, shut up, man!<eos> You ain't even ranked.<eos> You gotta have at least one fight to be ranked.<eos> Hey, I'll fight any man, anytime!<eos> Hey, you a bad man, huh?<eos> Get in the ring. Go a round with me.<eos> - Shawrelle.<eos> - I will.
Mabye I can't speak English well enough to understand you.<eos> For you understand, I want a fair fight this time.<eos> Jack wants to be the undisputed champion.<eos> This is the fight that I've been waiting for,for a long time.<eos> No, I can not arrange those kind of fight's.<eos> Look, even if you refuse, I can make it happen.<eos> You know Jack Miller, right?<eos> Jack Miller?<eos> He wants to fight you.<eos> No, I won't
Jule called in the middle of the night.<eos> So I brought it with me. It sounded like an emergency.<eos> We could forget all that business about the accident.<eos> I could draw up a document to end it.<eos> I don't think this phone thing is going to work.<eos> - Us three with a 50-year-old...<eos> - Forget it.<eos> The streets are dead at noon. OK?<eos> And if he screams?<eos> He won't.
It's Saturday night, in a college town,<eos> Mating opportunities everywhere,<eos> Damn, baby!<eos> All right, my turn,<eos> I always wanted a girl who could kick my ass,<eos> How about putting a little tongue on that?<eos> You don't want the tongue,<eos> She's not here,<eos> What if she doesn't come back?<eos> - She will,
Whas all this supposed to be...?<eos> Come on, agony is your 'passion'.<eos> This one posed as you.<eos> I gave him '"the treatmen".<eos> He confessed to being false.<eos> When did it happen?<eos> - 600 years ago.<eos> Say, Torqa! During the Inquisition, when you made Jews drink hot oil, how could you hear them declare their belief in the Holy Trinity?<eos> Tomorrow we rehearse your Crucifixion.<eos> '"We will'".
I don't understand you hoods<eos> Why are you asking all these questions? You're a goner!<eos> You come here to have a good time, right?<eos> Stop playing silly tricks<eos> Don't be shy. Let me take off your clothes<eos> Come on<eos> This is no fun<eos> Let's have some real fun!<eos> My, you're tough<eos> Gently, will you?
To want to be a nurse?<eos> Even... a slow girl like me?<eos> I didn't mean it like that.<eos> No innate skill... so I stuck him... over and over.<eos> Over... and over...<eos> -and over-- -l'm sorry!<eos> Please give me the syringe.<eos> You can't take back... what's been said.<eos> Want me to practice?<eos> Then I will.
- When?<eos> - This morning.<eos> - Did I?<eos> He plays with such intense passion.<eos> - Are you almost done?<eos> - Just a second.<eos> - Enjoy the concert.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - And say hi to Edith.<eos> - I will.
It hurts a lot, doesn't it?<eos> I still don't know what's going on... But I'm sure... we can get out of this somehow<eos> Just trust me, okay? Does it hurt a lot, honey?<eos> Try and bear it a little longer!<eos> Do that for me, okay? It will be all over soon<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll make sure you can play again<eos> I love you, honey<eos> Let's be strong<eos> One way or another, I'll...
I just want to talk to him.<eos> It comes when?<eos> You tell him that I recall?<eos> Thank you.<eos> A vodka.<eos> Again.<eos> Another.<eos> I hear no music!<eos> You put stronger?<eos> I will not!
You worry too much.<eos> You'll improve with time.<eos> Relax, your parents will love him.<eos> Huge crowds gathered this morning at the central square of Damascus to pay their respect to the late President and welcome his son, Bashar el-Assad<eos> No, and if not, everything is on.<eos> So what happens to the bride when she crosses over?<eos> She loses her identity on the way;<eos> she'll get a new one in Syria.<eos> But how will she come back to the Golan?<eos> She won't.
Moshe, I'll kill you.<eos> They had a BBQ, they made trouble, people got angry, we sent them home.<eos> We'll get over it.<eos> No harm done?<eos> Nobody hurt?<eos> - No, the guy's just a bit crazy.<eos> Alright?<eos> What's your name?<eos> Don't let it happen again.<eos> - It won't.
It's the first time I'm talking about this.<eos> I've never talked to anyone about this.<eos> Koby, Koby.<eos> Haven't spoken to him in 10 years.<eos> Get your arm up.<eos> Go get Mordechay.<eos> We're going off to the city of Dervichen To buy a turkey.<eos> Carful coachman, the basket torn, the turkey will fly away.<eos> Hey, Menny, you'll come to my exhibition, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.
Don't smoke, by God!<eos> Who do you see from the neighbourhood?<eos> I don't see anybody...<eos> Everybody moved away...<eos> It's not like it used to be.<eos> That's true.<eos> Everybody has moved on and out, right?<eos> You were going to rent a flat, what happened?<eos> We were.<eos> Supposedly we still will...
He's pulling his vote.<eos> - How many senators have we lost?<eos> - Three, all protégés of Milliken's.<eos> Unless Milliken calls off his dogs, we're not gonna get Health Care passed.<eos> He's sabotaging a bill that could benefit millions.<eos> He's showing you that he had the power to help start your political career, but he also has the power to end it.<eos> You can't lose this debate and fail to pass the most important legislation of your presidency.<eos> - We'd hand Keeler the election.<eos> - We haven't lost the senate vote.<eos> We will.
- I'm doing it for your sake.<eos> - For my sake?<eos> For you and your children.<eos> After it's all over, the world will be a better place.<eos> Please, Dad.<eos> Please.<eos> Please.<eos> Don't do this.<eos> Jane, I don't expect you to understand now.<eos> But one day you will.
OK, first of all, you're innocent.<eos> Remember that, all right?<eos> I'm not innocent.<eos> I let Sherry convince me not to give Alan his medication.<eos> - I could have saved his life.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> What about Sherry?<eos> Has she said anything to the president?<eos> No.<eos> No. And she won't.
Harper, we can't just leave him.<eos> Very philanthropic, But existential trumps humanism.<eos> Sorry, pal, welcome to seefra.<eos> Where technology like what you have there is illegal, Or at least i'm assuming, Based on the way you're-<eos> Hey, that is none of your business.<eos> I know a lot.<eos> All right, maybe you'd better come with us.<eos> How's your patient?<eos> She'll live.<eos> No, she won't,
[Thud] What, are you two idiots?<eos> Why didn't you catch him?<eos> I thought you had him.<eos> Blood tests show that there are minimal corresponding sequences between you, Zara, or Lach.<eos> They do confirm that, because you're a heavy-worlder, the disease has run faster.<eos> Now, the medication i've given you has reduced your fever and should help with the pain soon.<eos> It already has, thanks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Beka and Rhade will find something.<eos> Of course they will.
Of course.<eos> Calm and stoic.<eos> Like calvino.<eos> Drunk, dirty, disheveled... he's got the map.<eos> That's untrue.<eos> You have the map.<eos> You again.<eos> If you want the map, i want this man out of here.<eos> I won't stay here if he's here.<eos> I won't.
- What the hell's going on?<eos> Sorry to intrude.<eos> I'm Marcus Hamilton, your new liaison to the senior partners.<eos> - And here.<eos> - You're what?<eos> Along with her immortality and certain other privileges Eve has signed over her duties to me.<eos> Oh, and initial there.<eos> This is about a contract?<eos> I thought you said you were gonna die.<eos> And now, one day, I will.
- Right.<eos> After an evening of drinking, Michael, being the sensible one... offered to give Maggie a ride home.<eos> The next morning, Michael was wondering... how to end his first one-night stand.<eos> - Coffee? - Hi.<eos> Yes, please. Thank you. That's great.<eos> But you know what? I am going to have to read that plea soon, okay?<eos> 'Cause it's a big case.<eos> But I promise later I will call...<eos> Michael struggled to follow Gob's instruction tojust walk away.<eos> I'll... I'll...
If the gas giant pulled her in, its radiation would fry her like an egg.<eos> What about the moon?<eos> The spectroscope people call the atmosphere as CO2, methane, some argon.<eos> The clouds are mostly hydrocarbons.<eos> Cold as hell down there, but she'd survive on the surface.<eos> - Until her oxygen runs out. - When?<eos> Forty-six hours and change, sir.<eos> Hell of a long time to stay in one place.<eos> - What if the Cylons appear?<eos> - They won't, not for a while.
You've certainly been to court before.<eos> I have no doubt you'll do well.<eos> Motion practice.<eos> This is with a jury.<eos> I don't... I don't think I'm ready.<eos> Sally, look at me.<eos> - You trust me?<eos> - I do.<eos> And because you trust me, you'll believe what I'm about to tell you?<eos> - I will.
All right then.<eos> Are you mad?<eos> Mr. Crane, I really don't think that's a good idea. - It's a fantastic idea.<eos> - Denny, the police are already here.<eos> Yes, I can see they got everything under control.<eos> Sir, wejust want to have a conversation.<eos> If that phone even rings, I'll shoot!<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Tara, when I say open, you open that door.<eos> - I certainly will not!
Well, he's still bleeding because there's an irreversible D.I.C.<eos> What is that?<eos> Disseminated intravascular coagulation. That means his blood won't clot.<eos> Look at this, we're not going to win this one.<eos> What are we talking about in terms of time frame, how long?<eos> It could be minutes, hours.<eos> Okay.<eos> Did... we get the bad guy?<eos> No, not yet.<eos> But, Eugene, we will.
But you knew there was still one thing out there that connected you to the victim. Your watch.<eos> You may have started over, but your mother and father never stopped looking for you.<eos> What was his name?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You already know how it ends.<eos> That's not why I'm reading it.<eos> "But what you are left with is a premonition of the way your life will fade behind you, like a book you have read too quickly... leaving a dwindling trail of images and emotions, until all you can remember is a name."<eos> His name.<eos> It's the only thing we don't know.<eos> Now we never will.
And she's got a terrible temper, worse when she's pregnant.<eos> Yeah, that's not much different in our world.<eos> - Trust us, we can handle it.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Your instincts are right to distrust me.<eos> I am evil, after all.<eos> But we both want the same thing.<eos> There's a little problem with that, because your girls didn't uphold their end of the bargain.<eos> - They did not find our guys.<eos> - But you will.
- He an addict?<eos> - Addict, dealer.<eos> Last I heard, he was hustling out of the Badlands.<eos> But what did he do now?<eos> You know what?<eos> Don't tell me.<eos> I don't want to know.<eos> You find Julius Latrell-- whatever the hell his name is, tell him his son's a straight-A student.<eos> He's grown up to be a real man, not like his lying ass.<eos> Yes, ma'am, we most definitely will.
I'll give you the money.<eos> You buy the speed.<eos> I don't want it.<eos> Honestly.<eos> All right.<eos> Look, I got to go, man.<eos> I got to get to the next drop.<eos> Dude forgot his sticks, man.<eos> - Take care.<eos> - I will.
- We can't let the killer get away with this.<eos> - I'm open to suggestions, John.<eos> Can you get me into the evidence room?<eos> Sure.<eos> What do you need?<eos> You working for the Sheriff Office now?<eos> How apropos.<eos> You think?<eos> George claims you're the one who murdered Fernanda.<eos> Of course he will.
I don't want Cy to back me, and I don't know how to do anything without him.<eos> I'll back you.<eos> You don't have that kind of money.<eos> - I will.<eos> - You gonna turn prospector, Eddie?<eos> I'm gonna rob Cy.<eos> Don't, Eddie.<eos> He'll know.<eos> What's the time, kid?<eos> No, he won't.
He's with sandy's family.<eos> Got anything else?<eos> No, that's about it.<eos> You'll need this.<eos> Rabbit's foot.<eos> It's american for good luck, isn't it?<eos> Thanks.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You'd better come back, you know that, don't you?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I'm fine.<eos> We should keep moving.<eos> Captain.<eos> I was afraid you were still inside.<eos> It's all right.<eos> We found the Kir'Shara.<eos> You have always struggled so with your emotions.<eos> I came here.... I did all this to help you.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Trip can be an outlet for these feelings... if you'll trust him.<eos> The emotions he stirred in me were powerful... and frightening.<eos> I tried to push him away.<eos> If Enterprise hadn't been stranded in the past... it's possible I never would have married Trip.<eos> But I can't imagine what my life would have been like without him.<eos> What do you suggest I do?<eos> There's a human expression:<eos> "Follow your heart."<eos> What if my heart doesn't know what it wants?<eos> It will... in time.

No.<eos> You created a device that will prevent a devastating attack.<eos> Your name was to be spoken with reverence for generations to come.<eos> And, instead, you've chosen the role of betrayer.<eos> How I'm remembered isn't for you to decide.<eos> What have we done to lose your faith?<eos> You never deserved my faith.<eos> The Sphere-Builders have lied to the Xindi.<eos> They've manipulated us for decades. I see that.<eos> Perhaps the Arboreals will, but the others...
It really would help me to know that you were ready to be OK with this.<eos> I am.<eos> But...<eos> But?<eos> I'm not ready for other people not to be OK with us.<eos> You know, I don't hide you because you're a constant embarrassment.<eos> I hide you because even if it doesn't feel like it, we're doing something wrong.<eos> So what?<eos> So we get that "this" is different.<eos> But not everybody else will.
And the one thing that you all have in common is you think you can control it, but you can't.<eos> It owns you.<eos> Your eating disorder is going to be the fiercest opponent that you will ever face.<eos> You may never beat it.<eos> And the worst part is that not a single person in your life is telling you that right now.<eos> All they want for you to do is win at State, the whole town does.<eos> So I am going to be the one lone unpopular voice out there when you wrestle.<eos> I'm gonna root against you.<eos> I hope you lose.<eos> I won't.
I'm not lecturing.<eos> I'm saying that maybe there's a reason you didn't tell me you were married.<eos> You didn't ask. How about that?<eos> You think neil goes to the urologist, says:<eos> "By the way, doctor, you should know I have a wife"?<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Look, IVF has helped a Iot of people, and I'm not knocking it.<eos> But truthfully and thankfully, you don't need it.<eos> You have a husband who wants to have a child with you.<eos> -And we will.
I know this might be a kind of confusing so if you have any questions that you want to ask me or your dad, go ahead any time.<eos> Just do me a favor, OK?<eos> This isn't something I usually talk about.<eos> Actually, it's kind of a secret.<eos> Can you keep it for me?<eos> It's OK.<eos> I'm great with secrets.<eos> Unless they're mine.<eos> Then I tell everyone.<eos> I won't.
We had a full schedule this morning.<eos> They all cancelled.<eos> Every one?<eos> For the whole week, the month.<eos> Sal called. No one's coming.<eos> Don't. We knew this would happen.<eos> All that is required is a tinker of time.<eos> The place is empty, Harry.<eos> They're not coming.<eos> They will.
You deserve to celebrate that.<eos> And be celebrated for all of your accomplishments.<eos> For what accomplishments?<eos> It took me 1 3 years to finish 1 2 grades.<eos> -I failed. The end.<eos> -Look, I understand you're upset--<eos> I'm not upset.<eos> It's gonna be freaking embarrassing.<eos> Because everybody there has all these plans and I have nothing.<eos> You will.
I don't know why.<eos> Oh, that decides it, then!<eos> I was on the fence.<eos> But knowing that you two would be our neighbors?<eos> Now we have to get it!<eos> Ellen, we're gonna talk numbers.<eos> This cannot be happening.<eos> The realtor said another couple made an offer.<eos> Maybe the Janices won't get it!<eos> Maybe the other couple will.
Heh heh heh! Remember me, Girardi?<eos> Do I participate?<eos> Wow! This is awesome!<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> It's creepy, and you're losing it.<eos> Look, it might seem strange how I found it, but I did find it, and now they want to publish it in the yearbook.<eos> Tough luck.<eos> Grace, do you know how that touched me?<eos> You have this whole Emily Dickinson crazy talent that no one ever knew about and now they will.<eos> No, they won't!
You can, but you won't!<eos> Mom--<eos> I mean, if you're embarrassed to be with me, why did you even ask me to come? Will<eos> - I'm not embarrassed to be--Luke!<eos> What happened?<eos> I can't really say.<eos> How come he can get away with that?<eos> Because he's confused. You're lying.<eos> Do I want to know about this?<eos> Oh, you will.
She's gonna be fine.<eos> You know, I was never gonna dump her.<eos> I was avoiding her a little.<eos> It got too hard.<eos> I got scared.<eos> Hey, these are intense feelings, Adam.<eos> Processing them at your age... yeah, but she saw me at the bottom, Mrs. G.<eos> Crying and complaining and scared.<eos> How's she gonna forget that?<eos> She won't
- Really great meeting you, Brian...<eos> - Brian Michael David Scott.<eos> - How do you feel about "Dude"?<eos> - Awesome, my brotha.<eos> Joey Tribbiani?<eos> Joey?<eos> Hey, did-did someone say my name?<eos> No.<eos> Uh, no one did.<eos> But someday soon, everyone will.
Why don't you put it in storage?<eos> Because it needs to be driven.<eos> I want you to have it if I don't come back.<eos> - No.<eos> - Please.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Hey, buddy.<eos> Your mother would be proud of you.<eos> Make it back in one piece.<eos> I will.
400?<eos> The IP addresses and codes are in here.<eos> You need to log on at exactly 7:00 p.m.<eos> You miss the time, they'll pull the plug.<eos> You have exactly three minutes, start to finish.<eos> I haven't spoken to him in 13 years.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I suppose it's better than nothing.<eos> Nessa, both your lives, and mine, are in danger if anybody finds out.<eos> They won't.
Room 8004.<eos> Ed, you'll take this?<eos> Could I see this for a minute?<eos> Just a second.<eos> I don't take anything anymore.<eos> I spoke to your doctor.<eos> You don't need it.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'll take this one.<eos> Yes, you will.
I've brought you something.<eos> Insider coupons.<eos> Oh, my...<eos> They're not for the Montecito, but they're good everywhere else.<eos> I need you to be cool.<eos> Not until I leave, okay?<eos> We've heard rumours about insider coupons... but we were sure it was just another urban discount legend.<eos> Well, trust me, it's not.<eos> You two... cannot tell anybody...<eos> We won't.
Then why are you looking for her?<eos> Uh, Mrs. Knowles, before Tricia died she had a baby.<eos> A child?<eos> Yeah, he'd be about one years old right now.<eos> His name is Austin.<eos> Where is he?<eos> We think Lizzie may have him.<eos> Please.<eos> Please you've got to find him.<eos> I will.
My wife is gonna be fine.<eos> The doctors saved her life.<eos> You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too.<eos> You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you.<eos> Are you afraid I'll use it?<eos> I would.<eos> I understand now, Monk.<eos> You can't let it go, can you?<eos> Don't ever lose that watch.<eos> I won't.
They'll cooperate, but he's not too keen on the visible part.<eos> Our shooter isn't a moron.<eos> If he doesn't see police and FBI presence in the neighbourhood, he's going to think something's wrong.<eos> Yeah, I have a problem with that part too, boss.<eos> What's the point in setting a trap if he knows about it?<eos> Part of a sniper's mission is to infiltrate enemy territory.<eos> Our guy wants to prove himself, validate his skills.<eos> He's not gonna pass up an opportunity like this.<eos> - What if he succeeds?<eos> - He won't.
Ducky tell you that?<eos> It's true.<eos> Why?<eos> His eyes.<eos> I was looking into his eyes, and they looked kind.<eos> Did he look kind when he blew out Gerald's shoulder?<eos> You asked me why I couldn't stab him, and I told you.<eos> Contrary to conventional wisdom, Kate, eyes can lie.<eos> You meet him again, don't forget that.<eos> I won't.

Moving those dollars around, Captain?<eos> I'm trying.<eos> Only way I can stay beneath the radar is not make a withdrawal that doesn't exceed ten thousand dollars form any single operational budget.<eos> What's that?<eos> Well, this is an office. People are going to be dropping by with request forms all day long.<eos> Not today.<eos> Send them away.<eos> I keep doing that, they're going to get suspicious.<eos> Okay. Just don't forget what's at stake here, Captain.<eos> I won't.
It's been a long time since I've held a baby like this.<eos> Brings back all those nights with Matt and Annie.<eos> That silent communication.<eos> So uncomplicated.<eos> So intimate.<eos> Sometimes feels more intimate than anything else.<eos> Maybe you could help me with him.<eos> Just until this thing with Gina is resolved, until I get custody.<eos> - What if you don't?<eos> - I will.
I didn't just have sex with her, okay?<eos> ! I'm in love with her!<eos> - I was... I am in love!<eos> - Don't need to hear it.<eos> But Marissa does.<eos> I have to talk to her.<eos> I have to explain.<eos> - Luke, I wouldn't.<eos> - I can't go without making it right.<eos> I won't.
Of course its not.<eos> Let's go ahead and get this over with.<eos> We have a 4 hour drive ahead of us.<eos> A 4 hour drive into a storm?<eos> Well the storms passing through.<eos> By the time we get there it should be gone.<eos> Okay, wait a second.<eos> Shouldn't somebody stay here by the phone?<eos> I mean, incase your dad calls.<eos> I will.
Haley, have you seen my gray T-shirt?<eos> I want to do something, okay.<eos> Haley....<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> -I could love you forever.<eos> -So could I.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
-You were that close to nailing it.<eos> -What time is it?<eos> -9.:00 and change.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> I cannot believe you did that.<eos> Nathan is gonna kill me.<eos> Just play him the track.<eos> He'll understand.<eos> No, trust me.<eos> He won't.
Same wire.<eos> There are a number of wire manufacturers, but these 2 are both from Pacific North.<eos> Okay, so we've explosions at 2 different substations, same wire, can't be a coincidence.<eos> What's around these wires that they like so much?<eos> We're going to Chicago, Bob.<eos> No, I can't,<eos> I have fluorescence-glowing bacteria growing...<eos> I have a meeting.<eos> - Oh. Okay, I'll take Jill.<eos> - You will?
Are they in the city?<eos> Sir, I cannot give you that information.<eos> Just be happy that she's been placed.<eos> - I'm sorry, what was your name?<eos> - Liz.<eos> Liz. Liz, I'm Franco.<eos> Nice to meet you. You know, Liz, if you just happened to leave your computer screen unattended, just for a moment and I just happened to check out that computer screen as a fellow city employee...<eos> That could happen, right?<eos> It could.<eos> But it won't.
You're so much like your mother you wouldn't have listened anyway.<eos> - No biting.<eos> - Just take it, you girl.<eos> Other times, love's obvious.<eos> Anyway, I may not ever be able to tell you how much you mean to me, but I promise I will try to show you for the rest of my life.<eos> I love you.<eos> Aren't they amazing?<eos> I don't love you.<eos> - Please don't cry.<eos> - I won't.
I don't want to slack off like I used to.<eos> I don't want to be so moody.<eos> This is fun.<eos> I don't want to lose you again.<eos> Even if I screw up all the other stuff, that's the one that matters.<eos> I don't want to lose you either.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Yes.<eos> Will you?
It's right over there.<eos> How's the light in here?<eos> good, we're good.<eos> Okay.<eos> Pucker up.<eos> Yeah.<eos> The problem is not nuclear war.<eos> The problem is what's gonna cause nuclear war.<eos> I don't see us living through a nuclear war, george.<eos> Of course no not a whole lot of people will.
I had to put things in order and I guess I fell asleep.<eos> Didn't mean to worry you.<eos> No harm done.<eos> Come on, let's go back to the house.<eos> I can't do that.<eos> Yes, you can, dear, it's where we live.<eos> No, Ruth.<eos> This is where I live now.<eos> Let's get married and have a baby.<eos> Will you?
Coach teague,<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Hey.<eos> I'm doing a story on the "torch" on dan cormier and I was just wondering if I could talk to you for a little bit.<eos> Can it wait?<eos> I'm in the middle of a practice.<eos> It's only gonna take,like, two seconds, I promise.<eos> - I'll do it later.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I will.
It's something that happens over time when you trust each other.<eos> I know what a friend is.<eos> A friend is someone who would stand up for you and protect you.<eos> A friend is someone who would jump in a river to save you from drowning... even if it meant they had to give up their own life for you.<eos> You don't need to tell me... what it means to be a friend.<eos> Then you know that a friend would never keep me locked up in here.<eos> Get used to it.<eos> I did.<eos> People are going to come looking for me.<eos> They won't.
Thank you.<eos> But you have no idea how long the shield will last?<eos> There's no way of knowing, but there's a good chance you'll be grandparents before it goes.<eos> We'll be happy to come back and check in on you every now and again.<eos> In fact Ford will be happy to come back and explain how to be a 25 year old.<eos> - I'll look forward to it.<eos> - You'll have to get used to a few things, now that everything's changing around here.<eos> But we can talk about that next time we visit.<eos> Just promise me you'll stick around.<eos> I will.
It's the end of the line, Maggie.<eos> Please, Nick.<eos> I promise I won't tell anyone what I know.<eos> You're right.<eos> You won't.
No, lives were at stake.<eos> You did something good.<eos> But for reasons I may never understand, you felt like you couldn't come to me.<eos> - I was trying to protect you.<eos> - I didn't need you to protect me. I never did.<eos> What I needed was for you to let me in. To be a part of your life.<eos> But now... God, after this...<eos> Luc, please.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> Maybe not the same way, but it will.
I watched that motherfucker Cheese take re-ups... move weight all day, and not once did he go near a fucking telephone.<eos> Closest it comes is a call to a hanger-on's cell phone ten feet away.<eos> Which brings me back to what I was just discussing with the Lieutenant.<eos> So far, we've been up on some of these cell phones for nearly six months.<eos> The only drug talk we have is from street-level small fry.<eos> So, the feeling is that maybe two weeks from now... we don't go back to the court for another extension.<eos> We charge what we have... we try to roll someone up at Cheese or one of Joe's other lieutenants.<eos> What, are you kidding?<eos> We don't have a case worth making yet.<eos> And at this rate, we never will.
She challenged one of them and she got shot.<eos> Died on the way to the hospital.<eos> We're hoping he's going to try and call you.<eos> If he does, we need you to keep him on the phone as long as you can.<eos> - You mean betray him?<eos> - No. Look.<eos> We don't want anyone to get hurt, okay?<eos> That includes Kevin.<eos> If he hasn't called yet, he's not going to call.<eos> He will, Sara.
Are you afraid, Mr. Ducek?<eos> Of what?<eos> The defendant's outburst yesterday.<eos> It frightened some of the other jurors as well.<eos> It wasn't very good for my heart.<eos> I really don't know if I could take any more.<eos> I'm not gonna do anything right now.<eos> I would like you to think about this for a day.<eos> There's a lot at stake here.<eos> Yes, I will.
Oh, God.<eos> This was the week Gretchen Speck put activator in my shampoo.<eos> God, you're right.<eos> It was a gook for black history month.<eos> Yeah, until it all fell out.<eos> She really was horrible to you.<eos> I'm going.<eos> - What?<eos> - I'll go to your little shindig.<eos> You will?
Well, let's cook up the sausages the girls brought.<eos> And the special sausage for James.<eos> - Keep James' separate, though, 'cause...<eos> - no, mix it all in.<eos> It comes from Rene's so there's nothing that they could've put in it.<eos> Come on!<eos> That was fun today.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really hope he eats it.<eos> He will.
But they knows.<eos> They knows.<eos> They suspects us.<eos> What's it saying, my precious, my love?<eos> Is Smeagol losing his nerve?<eos> No.<eos> Not. Never.<eos> Smeagol hates nasty Hobbitses.<eos> Smeagol wants to see them dead.<eos> And we will.
There's no leaving this city.<eos> Help must come to us.<eos> It must be getting near teatime.<eos> Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.<eos> We're not in decent places.<eos> Mr. Frodo?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will. Of course you will.
The day the human race was nearly destroyed... by weapons they'd built to protect themselves.<eos> I should have realized our destiny was never to stop Judgment Day.<eos> It was merely to survive it... together.<eos> The Terminator knew.<eos> He tried to tell us... but I didn't want to hear it.<eos> Maybe the future has been written.<eos> I don't know.<eos> All I know is what the Terminator taught me:<eos> Never stop fighting.<eos> And I never will.
- I want you with me.<eos> - Just leave me alone.<eos> Are you gonna sit here in this grotty flat feeling sorry for yourself?<eos> Or are you gonna get out there and save your country?<eos> I'm gonna sit in the flat.<eos> - Johnny, this is ridiculous.<eos> - I'm a spent force.<eos> Spent, my ass.<eos> Ow.<eos> Will... you...
Your bodyguard?<eos> If you need a bodyguard, I'm in serious trouble.<eos> I thought I lost him at the coffee shop.<eos> Dad can be a little overprotective.<eos> Oh, Natchios.<eos> Right.<eos> As in Nikolaos Natchios.<eos> That's Dad.<eos> How am I gonna find you?<eos> You won't.
I mean, this is childish. Let's do it again.<eos> No, we will not do it again.<eos> I thought you'd be happy. No.<eos> Not at the expense of you making us look like fools.<eos> He's right. Why do you get dibs on being the hero?<eos> Because it's my damn ship.<eos> Oh, that makes perfect sense.<eos> Look, for 20 years, I've done nothing but Virgil. 20 years.<eos> Virgil belongs to me, and I will not let her fail.<eos> I will not.
One question.<eos> up at Esteridge's, were either of you ever up in the hayloft?<eos> Wait.<eos> Do you believe me at all?<eos> Yeah, I'll be there, Maggie.<eos> Try not to worry.<eos> I'll talk to the judge.<eos> We'll have plenty of time to figure this all out.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Like hell he will.
I'm not comparing them.<eos> Have you ever seen the Sistine Chapel, Miss Watson?<eos> Actually stood there?<eos> I've never been to Europe.<eos> I can assure all of you this is the place I want to be more than anything.<eos> Better discipline next class, Miss Watson.<eos> -It's me.<eos> -Collect from Katherine Watson.<eos> -Will you accept?<eos> -Yeah, sure, of course I will.
Um, it - N-Never - never mind.<eos> So, Paolo wants me to meet him at the Trevi Fountain tomorrow.<eos> So go.<eos> That would mean I would have to sneak away from the group. So?<eos> I'm incapable of sneaking.<eos> Weren't you the one that said we were gonna have adventures on this trip?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We.<eos> We were going to have adventures.<eos> And we will.
Forward this to Rome.<eos> "Christians are to be taught<eos> "that he who gives to the poor<eos> "or lends to the needy does a better deed than he who buys indulgences."<eos> "If the Pope can empty Purgatory, why would he not do so out of love rather than for money?"<eos> My God, who is this Martin Luther?<eos> - Fritz!<eos> - What?<eos> Dr. Luther wanted everyone to see that!<eos> And everyone will.
It's your sister on line four.<eos> All right.<eos> Er, yes, I'm very busy and important, how can I help you?<eos> have you gone completely insane?<eos> - You can't always be sensible.<eos> - 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'<eos> - It's the Chancellor on the other line.<eos> - It isn't!<eos> - 'I'll call you back.'<eos> - No, you won't!
This is a young man who's been spending his entire lifetime wandering around all by himself out on the streets.<eos> Which is quite different than being inside a public school. Right?<eos> Yeah, well, that's the point, isn't it?<eos> Mr. Tucker I am well aware of the liability risk we are running here.<eos> Harold will be first to tell you, my list of reservations is longer than most.<eos> I'm sure that's the case.<eos> But the fact of the matter is, none of us has any experience with having a severely retarded man wandering the halls with our students.<eos> The risk is enormous.<eos> -Please keep that in mind.<eos> -l will.

Father?<eos> Yes, son?<eos> - I don't think they want me.<eos> - Oh, no, they do.<eos> They do, son.<eos> They came a long way for you.<eos> Then can I go with them?<eos> I will still have to speak with them.<eos> Then can you tell them I'm an angel?<eos> I will. I will.
You are such a snob.<eos> -No, I'm not.<eos> -Yes, you are. Your snobbery stops you seeing anything good about anybody.<eos> Just 'cause he's doing a bit of building work.<eos> He's a very clever, talented person, you know. He's artistic and gentle.<eos> He's a very sweet man. And he's just, you know, very weak as well.<eos> I'm gonna leave this tonight, I can't concentrate on it.<eos> You know, in two or three years... I hope I'm gonna be able to support us properly. And then I'm gonna have a child with him before it's too late.<eos> -Does he want that?<eos> -Yeah, he will.
We need backup, quickly!<eos> Hold your fire! Hold it!<eos> Stop this action immediately!<eos> Now we must take action against you!<eos> Notice! You have been warned!<eos> Fire at will!<eos> Get him out of here!<eos> - You know the policy on this?<eos> - Not at all.<eos> - He will.
It speaks high-school French.<eos> Besides, I'm not depressed anymore.<eos> Then what are you still doing living with those losers?<eos> - Those are my people.<eos> - That's not a place you live.<eos> Guys, come on.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> But there is no way I can go on a romantic tour of Tuscany.<eos> - I'm not ready to meet anyone.<eos> - You won't.
Mish, you're in love.<eos> You're getting married.<eos> I mean, what's this like?<eos> It's like it's...<eos> I'm never going to be able to explain it.<eos> I wanted us to write our own vows for the wedding and now I can't do mine.<eos> How do you explain love?<eos> I guess I wouldn't know.<eos> I don't think I've ever felt that way about a guy.<eos> Someday you will.
Leave me alone!<eos> Get away from me!<eos> She doesn't remember.<eos> It can't be her.<eos> It is her, sir.<eos> The gypsy woman prophesied her return.<eos> And now the time has come.<eos> You had best get ready.<eos> But she doesn't remember.<eos> In time she will , sir.
Cecilia, I need... sorry...<eos> Calm down.<eos> What is it?<eos> I must go to Lisbon.<eos> The last flight is at midnight.<eos> Drive me to the airport, please.<eos> I must catch that flight.<eos> - All that talk, and then you skip off!<eos> - Will you, or won't you?<eos> - Of course I will.
What?<eos> Mr Samura?<eos> Well, it's a small town.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> I drove around a bit last night.<eos> Between the crime and the accident he couldn't have gone anywhere outside this area.<eos> Somewhere in here are our steps.<eos> Is that it?<eos> There won't be any steps out there in the woods.<eos> Yes, there will.
"Really Raj, I had never seen" such clouds before.<eos> Then he said...<eos> What did you tell him?<eos> What could I say?<eos> My heart was pounding. I missed you so much that moment.<eos> I thought... "if only you had been there," I'd have asked you for an answer.<eos> I told Karan just that.<eos> - What did you say?<eos> That I can't say yes or no without consulting Raj. "If I forbid you from marrying him," you won't marry Karan?<eos> I won't.
Else," he'll lose his temper for no reason.<eos> I just love this rumaali roti.<eos> I really missed it. Why don't you get married?<eos> You can have rumaali rotis everyday.<eos> "Listen, you were supposed to find" a girl for him.<eos> What progress?<eos> I'd find a girl for him today itself.<eos> But will he marry the girl I choose?<eos> Why won't he? Won't I break the moron's legs?<eos> "I will, on one condition.
Until now" I did not have a shoulder to cry on.<eos> Enough.<eos> "Why did you come, Raj?" To save me?<eos> But my life isn't that precious.<eos> "To me, my friend's life" means more.<eos> Control yourself.<eos> Everything will be all right.<eos> I'll take you out.<eos> "So now, I assume, you will" take care of yourself.<eos> "You will, won't you?"
Mr. Singhaniya called to say that soon he will get Raj and Jiya engaged.<eos> That's great news.<eos> "Know what, Kiran?<eos> Jiya is" our Kajal's sister-in-law.<eos> How does such a big world become so small sometimes?<eos> What medicine are you giving her?<eos> - She needs sleep badly.<eos> "And without these pills," she doesn't sleep a wink.<eos> Why won't she sleep?<eos> She will now.
That I'm glad to have you for a few days.<eos> We never see each other.<eos> You can help me get things ready.<eos> Ready for what?<eos> The wedding.<eos> John and I are getting married.<eos> Silly!<eos> If I thought you'd take it like that I wouldn't have toldyou.<eos> - Have you told Mom yet?<eos> - I will.
Grovel on my knees?<eos> I don't care what you say or do, Antonio. I don't care.<eos> I already said I was sorry.<eos> - It won't happen again.<eos> - I don't believe you.<eos> And I don't love you.<eos> - Don't say that.<eos> - I'll shut up, but it's true.<eos> I don't love you.<eos> I never will again.
Where's my dad?<eos> He has a new id. He's done that before.<eos> I want to see him.<eos> It's too risky now.<eos> I'm sick of risks.<eos> I couldn't live with a hood.<eos> You gotta change jobs.<eos> Or we're through.<eos> - She'll come.<eos> - She won't.
His head always makes that sound?<eos> It must be made of rocks<eos> Shut up!<eos> Stop it!<eos> Why are you so late?<eos> We were waiting foryou<eos> Were you cleaning after school?<eos> No I sent a letterto daddy in Mars<eos> - Dummy, it's not gonna get there<eos> - Yes, it will
I'm getting tired of all this hair<eos> Mom... I want my hair cut<eos> Why?<eos> Sue, your hair is so beautiful<eos> The kids make fun of me They say that I'm a girl<eos> No, Sue Your sister likes it this way<eos> I don't have a sister!<eos> You cut other people's hair Why not mine?<eos> Stop it!<eos> No! I won't!
He's my latest fiancé. Only for two weeks.<eos> He's a doctor.<eos> Then open the door.<eos> - No. I won't. Why not?<eos> - He'll see I cried.<eos> Why did you cry?<eos> Because I had to cry.<eos> Why's that?<eos> Open the door.<eos> - l won't.
I'm not lying.<eos> I offered shelter, now you're stealing our hen?<eos> Her baby is sick.<eos> Give it back.<eos> What are you saying?<eos> Why are you wrongly accusing us?<eos> We offer you shelter and you accuse us.<eos> I raised the little chick.<eos> Will you swear it's yours?<eos> No, I won't.
What kind of a Muslim are you?<eos> I am the devil but kinder than you.<eos> I'm shivering cold but you're in a warm room.<eos> Your prayers five times a day is all lies.<eos> Sell your music and get warm clothes.<eos> I listen to this music either to force you out or myself.<eos> What life is this, listening to music all day?<eos> I am alive with this music and won't leave unless I make you go.<eos> You can't make me go!<eos> This music will!

You'll surely get expelled too!<eos> I won't!
Cheers<eos> Whenever I try to remember the past It gives me a headache<eos> You can't force memories<eos> Just relax<eos> Here...<eos> Here you are<eos> What's that?<eos> We'll get a store when the new mall is built...<eos> You'll be an manager a partner in Tsu Tsu<eos> And we'll...

I said I'm okay<eos> Just get rid of Su-yeon's closet<eos> Su-mi we agreed not to talk about that closet<eos> You promised, right?<eos> Su-mi<eos> I know you're very angry with me<eos> And I know I'm a bad father<eos> You're not even a bad father<eos> It's cold so let's go inside<eos> I will
Imagine!<eos> I had a cleaning lady called Adriana and she was nothing more or less than you.<eos> You won't make a living here.<eos> Do you know "the King of the Alamos"?<eos> No. I don't know that one.<eos> When he was your age nor did Schubert.<eos> - How old are you?<eos> - I will soon be eleven.<eos> Maybe you will, maybe you won't.<eos> For my part you will.
Why don't you ask her what she wants?<eos> -What for?<eos> It's her life, let her decide.<eos> Do you want to go back to him?<eos> Yeah.<eos> -That's what you want?<eos> Yeah.<eos> -OK.<eos> But I don't wanna see you anymore.<eos> -Fine, you won't.
Watch your tongue!<eos> What a disgusting!<eos> Don't you think you go too far?<eos> - What?<eos> Why do you always try to kick up a row?<eos> You think I'm so disgusting that you may leave here.<eos> Why me?<eos> You want to leave, then you leave.<eos> Is that all?<eos> Ok, I will.
He knew what the head shaking meant. And mother shut up as well. Just sat there for a while and then said that... the only thing she would still miss is the squalling of the birds...<eos> She would only miss the screaming of the seagulls. Somnambulance...<eos> I'll write down where I found them and whose things these are.<eos> The chimney bricks are the only things left in the village.<eos> They sure know how to stoke a stove.<eos> Steal them clean and then set them on fire.<eos> Only the outhouses are still standing.<eos> When people start coming back, they'll have nothing left.<eos> Not even a roof. If they come back.<eos> Of course they will.
I never know it is so tiring if you are possessed by spirit.<eos> Mom!<eos> Weren't you going to bring your brother home?<eos> Go home!<eos> Go home!<eos> Go and find him.<eos> No, let's leave together!<eos> You have grown up already.<eos> You have to take care of yourself.<eos> No, I won't.
We have made a very big mistake by allowing that man to stay here<eos> It has now become very important for Kaaya to join the monastery<eos> Does she love him?<eos> - I don't know<eos> All I know is that it would be best if she took the initiation now<eos> Certainly.<eos> But the walls of the monastery weren't built... for people to hide from grief and sorrow<eos> Neither is this a prison<eos> Let Kaaya decide when she wants to join us Why will she?<eos> I will!
Killing Zakir is going to prove very costly for you<eos> Raj has simply got the name Encounter King<eos> People also say about him that he never misses his mark<eos> "But about you, he was off the mark"<eos> "Else, you wouldn't have been talking like this with me today"<eos> "Get one thing clear, sir"<eos> There isn't a bullet that can kill me<eos> I'm going to lead a very long life<eos> Better you understand that and also make Raj see reason<eos> "Oh sure. I will, of course"
Let's keep looking<eos> Hikari<eos> Are you okay?<eos> What were you doing?<eos> Getting more snails<eos> Sure you're okay?<eos> I can meet my mom<eos> When the fireflies fly they will bring her to me<eos> I will make them fly<eos> We will
You're gonna kill him.<eos> You can't keep doing this.<eos> Don't ever touch me again.<eos> - Yes? - Have you made any progress?<eos> - We're still working on him.<eos> - I told you, there's a time issue.<eos> Yes, sir. You told me.<eos> You do not wanna disappoint me on this.<eos> Get me that chip, Stark.<eos> I will.
- I don't wanna argue about this.<eos> Just do it.<eos> Why's it taking so long to get this number?<eos> Barely anything here. There's something...<eos> - We need this, Randy.<eos> Come on. - I'm on it.<eos> They're sending Division to do an evaluation. Why are they doing this now?<eos> We're operational, getting results.<eos> Why don't they leave us alone?<eos> They will.
Being knocked unconscious in my apartment.<eos> I see.<eos> Well, once you're aware that you're in the dream state, your objective will be to pick up the thread of your last memory in as much detail as you can.<eos> How?<eos> Well, you're just gonna have to feel your way back.<eos> It's like using a muscle that you never used before.<eos> If you can get to that point, just stay with it, because, ultimately, you will become aware of what happened next.<eos> I don't really understand.<eos> I know.<eos> You will.
Were you behind them extracting me from the CIA?<eos> I wish I could claim credit for that.<eos> I only learned you were working with us recently.<eos> My tenure began shortly after my father's murder.<eos> They freed me in exchange for my inheritance.<eos> Who killed your father?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But I intend to find out.<eos> Bristow should have to pay for these scars.<eos> She will.
Wanted to tell you what that meant to me before I...<eos> - Damn, I'm good!<eos> - You are?<eos> - Frickin' genius!<eos> Just cancel out the radical...<eos> - Thought you had me, didn't ya?<eos> - Which causes a feedback wave that liquefies half of Los Angeles. - What?<eos> - Oh!<eos> I'll never figure this out!<eos> - Yes, you will!
A means to an end.<eos> Well, people get born for all sorts of reasons.<eos> - He will never love you.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Foolish dead thing!<eos> Oh. Well, that'll work.<eos> FRED: I mean, starting not to look so good for us.<eos> Not that I'm giving up or anything.<eos> LORNE: Hey, you can stop that any time now.<eos> I will.
- They're really strong, right?<eos> - For a human.<eos> God, I can't believe Angelus killed the Beast.<eos> He fought dirty.<eos> Maybe this means we did the right thing, bringing Angelus back.<eos> Right.<eos> He's a real hero.<eos> Connor Angelus cannot fight his true nature.<eos> You didn't have that the first time around.<eos> - But now you will.
Hello, and thank you all for coming.<eos> [IN MANDARIN] [SPEAKS IN MANDARIN]<eos> ANGEL: How do you do that?<eos> Mandarin's not tough when you've been around a zillion years.<eos> No, how is it that you always know exactly what each person needs to hear?<eos> Just look into their hearts.<eos> Or sometimes it's right on their face.<eos> [IN SPANISH]<eos> - I wish I could see what you see.<eos> - You will.
Looks like the Hellmouth is officially closed for business.<eos> There is another one in Cleveland.<eos> Not to spoil the moment.<eos> We saved the world.<eos> We changed the world.<eos> I can feel them, Buffy.<eos> All over.<eos> Slayers are awakening everywhere.<eos> - We'll have to find them.<eos> - We will.
Good job.<eos> Okay, I'm confused. What just happened?<eos> That was the greatest power there is. A mother-and-child bond.<eos> Especially when that child is Wyatt.<eos> So you're saying he vanquished the dragon, and you knew he was gonna do it.<eos> Well, I was hoping he wouldn't want anything bad to happen to me.<eos> Okay, well that solved that problem.<eos> Now what do we do with this mess?<eos> - We'll figure it out.<eos> - No, actually, you won't.
Don't be afraid.<eos> You know you want to.<eos> - What happened? Where did he go?<eos> - Nowhere.<eos> He was right here all along.<eos> I was dreaming about you.<eos> About us.<eos> The way we used to be.<eos> And I don't want that to change just because we're married and having a baby.<eos> It won't.
Then they call you anal.<eos> Like holding your shit in has something to do with why you put the staplers next to the stapler.<eos> "Please, please, please...<eos> I want to hear a voice...<eos> Why am I so lonely?"<eos> Second to last page, right?<eos> This one should be "Why am I so alone?"<eos> Well, you can do the last ones without me.<eos> - Don't forget about that drink.<eos> I won't.
Not here. Not in the house of God!<eos> You used me.<eos> You used me to fill this house. You used me to fill your collection plate every week.<eos> You were doing God's work.<eos> Was it God that took away my childhood? Was it God that wouldn't let me play ball, or be with a girl, or go to the movies?<eos> I'm the only black man in West Indianapolis who can't dance, Daddy.<eos> (preaching) And I heard an angel say, with a loud voice,<eos> "Woe, woe, woe, woe to the inhabitants of the earth!"<eos> I never heard the angel, Daddy.<eos> You will.
- How many?<eos> - At least three.<eos> Listen, take everyone else, leave supplies and come for me in a few days.<eos> - No, I can't.<eos> - I won't leave my patients.<eos> I'll try to reach Angelique on the radio.<eos> - I can stay.<eos> - You want me to stay too?<eos> - No.<eos> No, please. - I will.
She told him to lie.<eos> They didn't go back for hot dogs. She wanted to pick up some beer.<eos> Adam's gonna be all right. He's responding well.<eos> I should never have filed for custody. I should've grabbed these kids and run away somewhere.<eos> She wants to see Henry.<eos> Look, Mr. Martin, I know this is a very difficult time and you're angry but she's going to die and you need to think about what's best in the long run.<eos> She wants him to see her like that?<eos> She wants to say goodbye.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
It's nice you're thinking about everybody for a change. Instead of just yourself.<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> - Look anyway what's the big deal?<eos> No big deal. It's just uncomfortable.<eos> Why?<eos> Whatever.<eos> Look I have no interest in being your boyfriend's buddy.<eos> - You don't have anything to worry about.<eos> - So you won't say anything about...?<eos> No. I won't.
Didn't do so bad yourself, using your voodoo powers of suggestion to bamboozle that poor woman out of her pain.<eos> I am way too tired to take that as anything but a compliment. So you want to tell me why you lied today?<eos> About what?<eos> You're "A" negative - don't think I don't remember.<eos> You always used to tease me 'cause I'm "B" positive, and you would say that you did a half letter grade better on the blood test.<eos> Um... well, you know, I spent over two years insub-Saharan Africa, and hepatitis is epidemic there.<eos> You can take all the precautions that you want, but there's only so much you can do in the field.<eos> I suspect that I might be a carrier, so I didn't want to, you know, plug into her not knowing.<eos> Well, it's not something that you should sit on. Your patients have a right to know if you're at risk.<eos> I will. I will. The doctors Abbott.
This is an act of war.<eos> I assure you, Commandant, you won't be missed.<eos> You would not dare murder me.<eos> We merely want to speak in much more detailed terms about your wormhole capabilities.<eos> You already know that you'll learn nothing.<eos> No, not here.<eos> But our facilities are so much better on Katratzi.<eos> They'll interrogate her now.<eos> What happens when they learn the truth about wormhole weapons?<eos> They won't.
I'll take my chances on my own, thank you.<eos> You misunderstand my objectives, John.<eos> Without Katoya's training, when the Scarrans find you... they will take your wormhole knowledge and then they will kill you.<eos> I would never allow that.<eos> Ah, Scorpy-Sue... after all we've meant to each other, you'd kill me first.<eos> You... have such a limited mental capacity, John, but apparently... an abundant will to prevail.<eos> Well, my advice to you is to use that will right here, right now.<eos> Katoya... is the only one that can give you the tools to resist the Scarrans!<eos> Your Crichton may not survive the training.<eos> He will.
... betheonewiththebesttoys.<eos> Turn this moon into a gorram theme park.<eos> Someone stands up to him... .<eos> He means to burn me out.<eos> Yeah, he sounds like a fun guy.<eos> I'd Iike to meet him.<eos> This won't be solved with talk.<eos> When I'm gonna fight a man, it helps to size him up.<eos> -well, he'II be at the theater tonight.<eos> -And so will I. Inara.
[Door opening and closing] HENDERSON: I just got phone calls from editors of two major newspapers... asking me if I had any comment on my slot machine play.<eos> HENDERSON: They both claim to have photos and video of me.<eos> What the hell's going on, Ed?<eos> HENDERSON:<eos> Do you know what this will do to me?<eos> To my career? I have a pretty good idea.<eos> HENDERSON:<eos> I don't care what you have to do!<eos> You stop this! But I can't.<eos> And more importantly, I won't.
They're already in place.<eos> Trust me, we got everything covered.<eos> You'll let us know the minute this is over?<eos> You have my word.<eos> It's time to go.<eos> It's five after.<eos> He's not coming.<eos> Be patient.<eos> What if he doesn't show up?<eos> He will.
Who won?<eos> Hello, Nasser.<eos> I did not expect we'd meet again.<eos> Neither did I. Remove the shackles.<eos> Now, please.<eos> Where is Gibbs?<eos> Recalled to Washington.<eos> His superiors determined that his concerns were unfounded.<eos> He's not buying it.<eos> He will.
Can't a woman just do something nice for her husband?<eos> A woman can definitely do something nice for her husband.<eos> You driving 20 minutes to bring me lunch... sounds like a woman who wants her husband... to do something nice for her.<eos> All right.<eos> I need a favor.<eos> I want you to take my friend Jude on as an intern.<eos> I know you're not fond of him--<eos> I never said I wasn't fond of him.<eos> I'm just gonna have to ask Christian before we take anyone on.<eos> Will you?
- Ferris wheels, balloon animals?<eos> - Done that.<eos> So, what's the deal?<eos> You ask a lot of questions.<eos> One of us has to.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Well, now that you've asked... I'm having a party at my place.<eos> You live in the Four Seasons?<eos> Come by and I'll explain everything.<eos> Yeah, maybe we will.
What's that mean?<eos> If you don't understand how important this is...<eos> I get it.<eos> I get it, okay?<eos> Too well.<eos> My mom, my dad...<eos> Just because that happened to you, doesn't mean it'll happen to me.<eos> - My parents may get back together.<eos> - No.<eos> They won't.
Fear changes everything.<eos> - Atlas Shrugged?<eos> - Yeah, you read it?<eos> - No.<eos> - It's good.<eos> Anyway, you're gonna be fine.<eos> Just remember... don't let him take it.<eos> - I don't know what that means.<eos> - Yeah, I know.<eos> But you will.
- Okay.<eos> - This one scares you, yeah?<eos> - Yeah, it scares the shit out of me.<eos> - Why, you know it.<eos> - Yeah, of course I know it.<eos> Everybody knows it.<eos> That's the problem.<eos> Why?<eos> Because when I say To be or not to be, the audience will be hearing every, every great actor who ever spoke those words.<eos> - They'll here Olivier, Burton, you.
Then I disappeared to be reborn in England.<eos> So, as far as the Algerian secret services are concerned...<eos> I am dead.<eos> What do you think?<eos> There is a possibility that we are being penetrated by a dangerous double agent, working for God knows whom - the Algerian secret service?<eos> The Pakistani intelligence service? An Al Qaeda offshoot?<eos> - Could be a disaster for us.<eos> - Or he's telling the truth.<eos> Offering his services to a country with which he has fallen in love.<eos> Then, we will.
But on the life of my family, I knew nothing about that.<eos> Get me the memo.<eos> I guarantee your e-mail won't be needed.<eos> But if I were you, I'd talk to the police before they talk to you.<eos> - I-I'll drop you somewhere safe.<eos> - I'm safe.<eos> How much did you get?<eos> Nearly all of it.<eos> If you're going to change your mind, do it before the affidavit's handed over.<eos> I won't.
Kelso can't make it on account of he's got a broken face.<eos> I don't got a broken face.<eos> You will if you keep interfering with me getting Jackie back.<eos> You're the one that's interfering.<eos> You know what? I'm going and Jackie's going, and you're staying home.<eos> - No.<eos> You are.<eos> - No.<eos> You are. - Fine, stay home then.<eos> - I will.
Maybe you should just try and leave the past alone.<eos> I can't... because it won't leave me alone.<eos> Who would have thought of hiding the spare under the doormat?<eos> Please tell me you brought coffee.<eos> Blueberry Danish, tuna, dry on whole- wheat... and a veggie burrito from that place you like on Larkin.<eos> With your bizarre hours, I couldn't decide what meal you'd be on by now.<eos> You are a good woman.<eos> So, how are you?<eos> - Pick a subject.<eos> - I'll take"Boys" for $200.
- I said, I know the feeling.<eos> - What?<eos> I said, I....<eos> Never mind.<eos> How's it possible that you're still single?<eos> My friend Lindsay always says: "If the wrong guy's in the room, I'll find him."<eos> I mean, not now. I mean, not you.<eos> Sorry. That's all right.<eos> Total disaster. Tell me about it.<eos> Okay, I will.
- Come here.<eos> I lose this vote, I'm resigning.<eos> - Will they postpone again?<eos> - Not after two continuing resolutions.<eos> - This expires at midnight.<eos> - Is that our problem?<eos> It massively is, yes.<eos> What about Grace Hardin?<eos> I thought of her. Can she say no to the president?<eos> - She will.
That's what you have to say?<eos> Yes.<eos> All right, it's pretty good.<eos> So what do you think, you wait a few weeks?<eos> - Till the bulk of the bill's appropriated. - Yeah.<eos> Then maybe you cap the percentage of the funding that's covered by the gag rule. - Yeah.<eos> I mean, how do you monitor what a doctor says to a woman in Zimbabwe anyway?<eos> - You don't.<eos> We just get more aggressive on the domestic side.<eos> We will.
Neither do I Let's go in<eos> W-w-w- - What's the rush?<eos> Okay, wait a second Does Jack have his date with Barry tonight?<eos> Is that tonight?<eos> I don't think that's tonight<eos> Please! You're totally spying on him<eos> I am not<eos> What kind of a world do you live in when the only reason people are in a hallway is to either fart or spy?<eos> Well, if you're not spying then go into your apartment like a normal person<eos> Fine. I will
Dude, I heard you telling him.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This whole thing... this whole stupid thing was that so Pilot could... chase after some fantasy girl.<eos> Dude, we macked!<eos> Oh, God... these guys are cool! They're going to Seattle!<eos> And they're tripping to the tits!<eos> What exactly are you on the run from?<eos> Why don't you tell her, Jack?<eos> Tell her, Jack!<eos> I will.
Has been missing, unheard of last three years.<eos> And now, he's back..<eos> Halloween: Ressurection.<eos> Chrygulan tells us.. ..that the human psyche contains.. ..a part of ourselves, that even..<eos> Good morning, Paul.<eos> Thanks to see you in class.<eos> Am I keeping up?<eos> All right.. What do I mean by all these people?<eos> I mean that inside all of us there lurks a dark element figure.<eos> A kind of boogy man, if you will...
- You saw him again.<eos> - We just talked.<eos> - Think I'm stupid? You'd not be the first wife he's...<eos> - l didn't cheat on you.<eos> I neverwill.<eos> I tried my best to love you.<eos> But I can't.<eos> I even prayed, but God didn't answer.<eos> It's true that I love Alexis.<eos> And I always will.
- What, are you mad at me?<eos> - Just want your money.<eos> Look at that. A trio of nines. Pretty.<eos> - You shuffle that deck?<eos> - I certainly did.<eos> Nines bets.<eos> I'll raise it two bits.<eos> Call.<eos> We all got thumbs up our asses.<eos> You won't for much longer.
- Having a couple beers.<eos> - Where?<eos> I just don't really remember, because I was, you know, a little messed up.<eos> - You drove drunk? - I'm sorry?<eos> You were in the car and you were drunk, so you drove drunk.<eos> Not that I can recall.<eos> - What was your friend's name?<eos> - Walter Duffy.<eos> And this Duff will say that you were with him at the time of the robbery?<eos> Yeah, he will.
Leon.<eos> Leon, stakeout.<eos> - What do you want?<eos> - I'm looking for Leon. - Leon ain't here.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> I'll let him know you came by.<eos> I'm Basil. - What?<eos> - Tell him Basil came by.<eos> I will.
Do you know fear?<eos> Do you know what it's like to feel your heart beating so intensely that you can't even breathe?<eos> This is a story of monsters.<eos> Creatures.<eos> Hideous nightmares that crawl in the night.<eos> I've seen them.<eos> I've seen them in visions.<eos> And you will too.
We have killed Mesopotamians!<eos> We have killed Assyrians!<eos> Mycenaeans!<eos> Sumerians!<eos> But we have never had the pleasure of killing an Akkadian.<eos> Which limb do I take first?<eos> May the gods have pity on you.<eos> Because my brother will not.
There's nothing I can do that'll convince you that I'm clean.<eos> It's unhealthy, Roger.<eos> It means we're both hooked.<eos> - Running through a tunnel... between the ceiling and the floor...<eos> Bill packs these mikes... Make sure you keep that needle below 90.<eos> Right, Vlad?<eos> You wanna come up?<eos> We can explore these issues further.<eos> I haven't hit rock bottom yet.<eos> - You will.
Wait.<eos> I've been thinking.<eos> What if I didn't go to Rhode Island next year?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What if I went to Berkeley instead?<eos> We'd be closer when you go to Stanford and...<eos> - We could get an apartment.<eos> - Amy.<eos> - I haven't gotten in yet.<eos> - But you will.
They're great.<eos> No.<eos> You're not looking.<eos> You can't be an artist if you don't see.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They're lonely.<eos> It's me in the center.<eos> It's our secret.<eos> You can't tell anybody.<eos> I won't.
Juni, leave it alone.<eos> He's dead. Thanks to your buddy Gary.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> You like him and believe him?<eos> I don't like him...<eos> Gary's a bad guy, Carmen.<eos> Maybe I know that.<eos> I think I can change him.<eos> I do not understand you.<eos> And you never will.
I think Lecter picked up on something in the missing part of that note.<eos> Maybe not a name, but something, enough to narrow the search.<eos> Even if he did, he won't tell you.<eos> Not unless I can offer him something.<eos> Congratulations, Will.<eos> That was most artistic, the way you disposed of the annoying Mr. Lounds.<eos> Your cell looks bigger with no books in it.<eos> Does it?<eos> I hadn't noticed.<eos> Oh, you will.
George Grosz, Adolf Hitler.<eos> My wife Nina.<eos> - You...<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Grosz: Nice guy.<eos> - Oh, he's a futurist.<eos> - Grosz: Really, what's his name?<eos> - Hitler.<eos> - Never heard of him.<eos> - You will.
It looks like that's just what you did.<eos> This is not just some guy I met at Ollie's.<eos> I'm done with that, this is different.<eos> We were just laying in his bed and talking.<eos> -Talking?<eos> -Yeah, about fixing up his house.<eos> You met a guy with a house.<eos> That's nice.<eos> I hope this one calls you.<eos> He will.
Do you remember anything about that night?<eos> That night with Katie?<eos> Do you remember... How she died?<eos> She told you about a videotape, didn't she?<eos> She was afraid, wasn't she?<eos> Something was happening to her.<eos> How did she die?<eos> Please.<eos> I need to know.<eos> And you will.
The other side of what?<eos> This.<eos> Hi, Dad!<eos> Don't be scared.<eos> He's not too well now.<eos> Did he not take the lemon drops?<eos> I don't think they agree with him anymore.<eos> Why do you have sores?<eos> If I tell you a secret, will you tell nobody else?<eos> No, I won't.
Please, I'm begging you, please.<eos> Johnny, please, please.<eos> No, no, no, no. Please, Johnny, please. No, no.<eos> - Please don't take my new baby.<eos> - I'm not taking her. OK?<eos> Save my baby.<eos> Save my baby, Johnny.<eos> Please, please.<eos> Please.<eos> I will.
This flat's too big for you.<eos> I told you to get dressed.<eos> - I'm not going.This is my flat!<eos> -You must obey me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Here it is.<eos> The old man that lived here died a few weeks ago.These are his things.<eos> -Are you crazy?<eos> I'm gonna live here?<eos> -Yes, you will.
Volodya!<eos> Volodya,what are you doing?<eos> - I'm just sitting here.<eos> - Come down.<eos> - I'm just sitting here.<eos> - Come down, please.<eos> - Come down!<eos> - I don't want to.<eos> - Come down.<eos> - No, I won't.
I heard you weren't feeling very good.<eos> You came to check on me.<eos> You need some help getting home.<eos> It's a long way.<eos> I've gotten this far. I can get back.<eos> You were fine yesterday.<eos> Did you catch something?<eos> Don't look at me like that!<eos> I don't want you to look at me!<eos> Fine, I won't.
I'm gonna kick back, watch my coin multiply.<eos> We're gonna get rich together.<eos> You know, Monty, you shouldn't talk like this.<eos> I just thought, "No, you know, I can take out a little more to live on, a little more."<eos> I got greedy, greedy.<eos> I just fucked myself.<eos> Man, you're gonna wrap yourself around in a twist, you keep thinking about this shit.<eos> That's all I can do is think about it.<eos> - I'm not gonna make it, Frank.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Of course you are. I've got a nice hot stew for you here, Squeery.<eos> And there's bread on the table.<eos> I brought the letters to the boys, I'II read them in the morning.<eos> -I'm doing the brimstone first.<eos> -Of course you are.<eos> What?<eos> Have you....<eos> Did anybody....<eos> Has nothing been heard... about me?<eos> Not a word, and never will we.
Dude, roll that shit up.<eos> Marrying a fuckin' forty year old tramp?<eos> What are you, stupid?<eos> And then when we turn old, We can marry a hot twenty year old.<eos> That makes no sense whatsoever.<eos> Dude, women reach their peak at forty.<eos> I'm talking money, dude.<eos> We'll get young chicks when we're like forty and have money and shit.<eos> What if we don't make any money even when we're forty?<eos> We will, why won't we?
It makes you that happy?<eos> Yes, your hand motion brings back everything.<eos> You must really remember now.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> Drink up, to celebrate.<eos> I'll drink from the bottle.<eos> I wish we could be alone.<eos> I won't lay a finger on you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't, okay?
Where are you going?<eos> You're awake?<eos> I have to attend my cousin's wedding with my mother.<eos> I have a headache!<eos> A headache?<eos> Then get some medicine.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'll be back before noon.<eos> Will you wait?<eos> I will.
Because I heard a little story about your son Michael.<eos> Who told you about Michael?<eos> I don't quite remember...<eos> Who told you about Michael?<eos> Someone in a white coat?<eos> If you ever mention Michael's name I'll...<eos> You'll what? You'll what?<eos> Just tell me!<eos> Come on, Hanne, my lass, come on!<eos> You'll what?
It's not loud enough.<eos> I woke up before mine rang.<eos> I hardly slept all night.<eos> You're cute!<eos> Nervous about your presentation?<eos> Yeah, a little.<eos> The game still crashes.<eos> It does?<eos> - I can't wait to see it!<eos> - You will.
What are you talking about?<eos> I came all the way here to help you!<eos> Give it to me!<eos> I'm in charge of this house!<eos> You're coming with me!<eos> I am not!<eos> Hold it!<eos> What do you want?<eos> Miss Kikuno wants you to give her that money-box.<eos> The hell I will!
Throw, Taboo. See what you can do.<eos> You know I don"t like to gamble, Laurita.<eos> Swearto me That you love me<eos> And Iwill return<eos> But if you love falsely<eos> Your love Iwill spurn<eos> Do you know that beauty?<eos> That thief dated a girlfriend of mine.<eos> - Don"t mix with him.<eos> - Of course I will.
- What'll I do?<eos> - I'll find it.<eos> St. Christopher...<eos> What will I do ?<eos> She's not...<eos> What?<eos> Crispina?<eos> Crispina, what are you doing?<eos> - You'll never find St. Christopher.<eos> - I will!
Why are you still talking?<eos> Just do it!<eos> You're doing it.<eos> Little pigs, little pigs, let me in.<eos> Not by the hair on your chinny chinny chin.<eos> Then I'll huff and I'll puff... and I'll bash your brains in.<eos> I should have known it would be red.<eos> It's pink, Mama.<eos> I can see your dirty pillows.<eos> Everyone will.
- Either you tell her, or I will!<eos> - Shalu...<eos> - Shut up.<eos> One moment. I'll tell her.<eos> Shalu, there's something I want to tell you.<eos> - Actually, I...<eos> - Go on, Sameer.<eos> Well, I have a special show!<eos> I want you to attend it.<eos> - You will, won't you?
Are you... having an affair with Brother Zhang?<eos> No need to see me off beyond the wall.<eos> You should go back. No.<eos> Brother said I had to see you to the station.<eos> It's not necessary. Do as I say.<eos> I'll follow my brother's orders<eos> Make sure you don't upset him<eos> It's not me who upsets him.<eos> Brother Zhang, will he get better?<eos> Yes, of course he will.
Boss<eos> Husband Husband Where's my husband?<eos> Who are you looking for?<eos> Han Joon-tae<eos> You're finally here<eos> Four more whiskey bottles, ten more beers<eos> I'll take off the beers, so...<eos> Where's my husband?<eos> Pay the bill first<eos> - I won't
Beat it!<eos> Shit, these damn bastards!<eos> Smarten up, all of you!<eos> As I said on my first day here this is not a recreation center!<eos> These are animals who gave up the right to be human!<eos> This isn't a place where you just sit around and get paid<eos> It doesn't run on its own, it's a penitentiary!<eos> *For tonight<eos> *I will wear pink lipstick<eos> - For you I will
Do we really have to do this?<eos> Ain't it thrilling to just keep living as fugitives?<eos> It may be hard but it's better than dying!<eos> Step on it!<eos> No, I can't!<eos> This ain't right<eos> Go!<eos> If we go fast enough it'll work!<eos> What if it doesn't?<eos> - It will!
Don't you have any feelings at all?<eos> Do you want to live a normal life?<eos> I'm afraid you've got the wrong person<eos> Charlene is dead<eos> Listen Charlene... or whatever you want to call yourself...<eos> We're stuck here and it's cold... and to be honest<eos> I don't know how much longer I can keep my arm up<eos> I knew you wouldn't kill me<eos> It's not that I can't.<eos> I won't
No.<eos> He doesn't know yet.<eos> Where are you going?<eos> Do you have a place to sleep?<eos> Do you have your own destination?<eos> I'm going to search and search until I find my mother.<eos> Huh?<eos> You're lucky you have something to search for.<eos> Mother, or whatever I hope you find what you want.<eos> I will, I will.
- I'm not angry with you, Sherry.<eos> - Oh, good, David.<eos> I feel sorry for you.<eos> You feel sorry for me?<eos> You've lost touch with what it is to be... a parent.<eos> A friend.<eos> A wife.<eos> What?<eos> After tonight... I don't wanna see you again.<eos> - David, will you just...
David... How did you find out about the military evacuation?<eos> I made some phone calls. Just following up on a rumour.<eos> I can't tell you any more than that.<eos> You will tell me more, and I will not ask you again.<eos> I am not a member of your staff, David.<eos> I am your wife.<eos> Ex-wife, and you will tell me because the safety and security of this country is more important than your power plays.<eos> You know, despite everything that's happened, I love you.<eos> - Oh, please.<eos> - No, I always will.
Yeah, well, celebration's over.<eos> By the way, what are these doing in your sister's room?<eos> They're blackmailing me.<eos> They made me tell about Dad's book so they can outsmart him and go to a concert.<eos> Punish them, Mother!<eos> That's funny.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Let's go tell Dad.<eos> You've done enough, and I will.<eos> Yes, I will.
I got a job selling snowboards at Barenaked Board Skate.<eos> No!<eos> Really?<eos> Let's take me shopping.<eos> Well, I would, but I thought we were still broken up.<eos> For another 24 hours.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Here's... here's a thought, you could say the whole thing was mutual.<eos> - I'll say it if she will.<eos> - I will if he will.
Where does he live?<eos> - Oh, er... Don't tell her!<eos> - New York, Eds.<eos> New York, that's it.<eos> Patsy knew, yes.<eos> My son is gay and in New York and you knew!<eos> My son is gay and in New York.<eos> I'm going to New York. I can see him!<eos> He won't want to see you.<eos> - Of course he will, darling.
-Why not?<eos> -It's 20 years ago, high school.<eos> But we've come a long way since then, haven't we?<eos> -What are you trying to do?<eos> She hurt you.<eos> You're still angry.<eos> Pain doesn't decompose when you bury it.<eos> And that is a Claire Otom-ism.<eos> Dr. Liston said I can come and visit whenever I want.<eos> -And will you?
Did it turn you on?<eos> Watching her up there in front of all those brainiacs knowing she was the smartest one in the room?<eos> - Her theories deserve attention.<eos> I saw the way you looked at her.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> Do you think I care about your little crush?<eos> Moon all you want over the Texas Twig because I know whose bed you'll be crawling into at the end of the day.<eos> Or the middle of it.<eos> You think you know me?<eos> Better than she ever will.
Sorry, dude.<eos> I heard you know your Greek mythology. I'm impressed.<eos> Never would've guessed.<eos> Yeah, I'm a mystery.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> So, where's Nick?<eos> He bugged out early.<eos> Well, good work, you guys... both of you.<eos> Would you let him know?<eos> Thanks. Yeah, I will.
And there's nothing in the world that we want more than to help you find your way home.<eos> We just don't know how.<eos> I think you just did.<eos> I will stand by my word.<eos> You promise?<eos> I promise.<eos> You guys, can we...?<eos> Can we just stay in tonight and not go to the restaurant?<eos> We still have to talk.<eos> Yeah, we will, just at home.
The faces all fade away.<eos> It's the taste you remember.<eos> And what was I, just fast food?<eos> Oh, hardly.<eos> Just relax.<eos> Clear your mind.<eos> You are a hunter now.<eos> You have the ability to find your prey.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> You will.
Maybe we could go with you and watch your back.<eos> That's an awful lot to ask of her right now.<eos> I know, but what choice do we have?<eos> There's gonna be a coronation tonight unless we stop it.<eos> How does it feel?<eos> Heavy.<eos> Focus.<eos> What's the point?<eos> - We don't even have the Grimoire.<eos> - We will.
Thanks to Selena testifying for us.<eos> What about how Agent Jackman died?<eos> They're stumped.<eos> They can't figure out how he shot himself from 20 feet away.<eos> What are they gonna do, subpoena Cole?<eos> You guys stopped one of their own from killing.<eos> - I think they'd be grateful.<eos> - Yeah, one would hope.<eos> At least until they find those files on us.<eos> They won't.
I've tried to reach you, but your sister said...<eos> I know. I talked to her. She said you were tracking down some leads on Ray.<eos> - Yeah. I have nothing solid yet.<eos> - I found him.<eos> - What?<eos> - I found Ray.<eos> - Is he with you?<eos> - No, but I know where my husband took him.<eos> - You've gotta help me get him back.<eos> - I will.
I know you.<eos> How are you ever going to find your soulmate if you won't go and talk to anyone, Walt?<eos> Soulmate?<eos> What the heck is that?<eos> It's the person you're meant to spend your life with.<eos> You really believe in all that stuff?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I really do.<eos> Right now, I'd just be happy to find a good woman, you know?<eos> Well, you will.
Let me know if there's any change.<eos> Why haven't you adjusted your time to our capital city? I apologise.<eos> We weren't aware that it was required.<eos> It isn't a requirement.<eos> It is simply a courtesy.<eos> Something your species doesn't seem to understand.<eos> I'll explain it to the Captain immediately.<eos> You might also explain to your captain... that it's been nearly three hours since he received our transmission.<eos> If he has the slightest hope of acquiring any technology from us... he'd be wise to pay us the courtesy of responding.<eos> I'll...
Ephram, come in.<eos> -Happy Thanksgiving, Dr. Abbott.<eos> -And to you.<eos> -l assume you´re here for Amy.<eos> -Yes, sir.<eos> I´m afraid that she´s gone off to Denver with her mother.<eos> Oh, will you give her this for me?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> Tell her I made it.<eos> I certainly will.
Okay.<eos> Okay. Good.<eos> Thank you.<eos> But I won't be there.<eos> Okay.<eos> Fine. Then you can tell the Williamsons that you're not spending time with them because you have a problem with their child.<eos> I won't have to tell them because I won't be there.<eos> Okay. then. I'll tell them.<eos> - Fine with me.<eos> - Yeah. I will.
A funny story.<eos> Yeah, because sick people are hilarious.<eos> Well, they... They can be.<eos> Uh...<eos> Well, in fact, I remember this time I was working the ER and this...<eos> This, uh... This fellow, this, uh, you know, upright sort of citizen he comes in, and he's, you know, complaining...<eos> Inara, she's gotta have some funny whoring stories, I'd wager.<eos> Oh, do I ever.<eos> Funny and sexy. You have no idea.<eos> And you never will.
The Cobra. - The Cobra.<eos> - Oh, now, stop it.<eos> You're humble, don't be.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Same here. Edna's group wants to give you kudos, too, Emily.<eos> - Make sure to swing by.<eos> - I will.<eos> I should make the rounds.<eos> Say goodbye before you leave.<eos> - I will, Cobra.
What kind of horror have we unleashed?<eos> Where is she, Faust?<eos> Where is the Amazon princess?<eos> -Try to have patience, my lord.<eos> -Patience? !<eos> I have been patient for over 3000 years!<eos> Forgive me. I simply meant that the relics will soon be here.<eos> I feel it in my bones.<eos> And then, Lord Hades, the world will be ours.<eos> Indeed it will, human. Indeed it will.
- Suit yourself.<eos> Why don't you come and join us?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> The Chariot.<eos> You are a very restless soul. Oh. Now this is interesting.<eos> The Knight of Pentacles.<eos> Is that good?<eos> Well, it confirms what I felt earlier...<eos> romance. You know anyone with a British accent?<eos> - No. - You will... very soon.
And that ending.<eos> When you tied it all together, her just sitting there on that porch.<eos> And her mother coming back, and making her breakfast...<eos> No, she made her mom breakfast.<eos> Oh! I didn't get that.<eos> You know, I sent it out.<eos> To this magazine.<eos> No! I didn't!<eos> Honey, that's wonderful!<eos> When will you--
- You know what I did?<eos> - What?<eos> I cut a fucking chunk out of her arm.<eos> - The bitch wore sleeves from then on.<eos> - That put her right?<eos> Fuck, no.<eos> The girl would spread her legs for anything that moved, and sometimes for things that didn't.<eos> I don't like to disrespect the dead...<eos> Hey, you know what, Javier?<eos> You never will again.
- They could die.<eos> - They've had practice.<eos> - Dying?<eos> No, I mean things like this.<eos> Do things like this happen a lot around here?<eos> - Why don't you leave?<eos> - We've tried.<eos> No place like home.<eos> - Lf they get him... LIZ:<eos> They will.
They have an actual abacus.<eos> We were having one of those great first dates... you can only have when it's not an actual date.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - What's that?<eos> - It's stupid.<eos> I collect found playing cards.<eos> - They're all over the city.<eos> - Really?<eos> I never noticed.<eos> Well, you will now.
A rogue elephant, played by my old friend Stampy is about to crush sweet young Milhouse.<eos> Then you run up and save the day by saying Stampy's safety word, "magumbo."<eos> Whoa, he's a big as Brando, but he takes direction.<eos> Eighty-nine percent of Americans would rather have a shoehorn than a computer.<eos> I'd like to 89 you.<eos> I've heard about you vendors.<eos> Hey, lady.<eos> I like the way your body looks.<eos> - Stop objectifying my mom.<eos> - I will in a second.
- Sorry I'm late.<eos> - Nick, I'm shooting off for a bit.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> Why? - Can I borrow a pen?<eos> No?<eos> Never mind.<eos> Oh, look, here's one.<eos> - Who are you working for?<eos> - I don't understand.<eos> You will.
- New front door key.<eos> - At the Hilton, are you?<eos> I know how you feel about living with me and being safe, so I've changed things.<eos> Come back, please.<eos> You can't stay here.<eos> Go and have a look.<eos> Swipe it through the slot, light goes green, you're in.<eos> Go and see, please.<eos> - I'd rather you showed me.<eos> - I will, but...
- Burnt toast?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're not sure.<eos> That's why I had the omelet.<eos> Welfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters.<eos> They use it to measure a president's values on work and responsibility.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We're gonna win the vote.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - We will.
- Burnt toast?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're not sure.<eos> That's why I had the omelet.<eos> Welfare is a core issue with swing and independent voters.<eos> They use it to measure a president's values on work and responsibility.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - We're gonna win the vote.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - We will.
- I wish.<eos> - I know.<eos> Who's Chet Collins?<eos> Chet Collins is a contractor from Rockaway who liked nothing more... than to take his kids camping in the Catskills each summer.<eos> On one trip, his son Sean disappeared in the middle of the night from his tent.<eos> Stolen, wandered off, no one knows.<eos> And that was five years ago.<eos> Jack stayed close with this guy?<eos> We all have our Chet Collinses.<eos> You will, too.
I'll get him alone.<eos> Mrs. Buckman, a veteran prosecutor, appeared drained of emotion... as she concluded a brief press conference just a few moments ago.<eos> I hate that we have to do that.<eos> Abby's face is plastered across every Trinitron in the city.<eos> That kind of publicity can't hurt.<eos> It's a tough bargain because either way... their personal tragedy becomes film at 11.<eos> They're just doing their job.<eos> Yeah, after some ambitious reporter goes behind your back... with an exclusive that blows your case, you might feel a little differently.<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - Yes, you will.
Like maybe something you'd find in an X-File.<eos> If that's what you came looking for, then you came a long way for nothing.<eos> - Then what's with the cavalry?<eos> - Excuse me?<eos> A lot of good shoes out here looking for what's gotta be a dead man.<eos> The guy was killed, right?<eos> A man survives a fall like this, on fire?<eos> It's not very likely.<eos> You got a body?<eos> We will, Agent Doggett.
If it means that much to you, blow up my statue.<eos> Oh, Bender!<eos> When did you come in?<eos> Hold still.<eos> Let's blow this tomb.<eos> Pharaoh Bender!<eos> He once more walks among the living!<eos> How we doing?<eos> Remember me!<eos> I will. I will.
I told you so.<eos> It's alright.<eos> Worse things have happened. To both of us.<eos> Maybe one day we'll build a summer house out here?<eos> Summer.<eos> Do they have summer here?<eos> You'll know it's summer when the partridge berries are out.<eos> And we can make partridge berry duff and sweet berry okie.<eos> Will you show me how?<eos> I will, yeah.
You have nothing to be scared of, Megan.<eos> I'm not scared.<eos> Good.<eos> But you're wondering what's going on.<eos> I know what's going on.<eos> You're a kidnapper, and you're a sick weirdo.<eos> Megan, you're the most opinionated girl in my class.<eos> - Think you got that from your mom?<eos> - I wanna go home.<eos> You will.
-My name is Elizabeth. -Memsahib's name is Elizabeth.<eos> Ali...and what?<eos> My God!<eos> I'll twist my tongue saying that!<eos> It's a nice name. Whatever it may be.<eos> Memsahib, we're leaving.<eos> Come on.<eos> He'll never agree, Bhuvan.<eos> Father.<eos> He will.
William, I love you.<eos> I love you. You.<eos> - I won't see you led to the stocks.<eos> - But you'll see me run? No!<eos> Damn your pride, William.<eos> It is only you that will not see you run.<eos> Pride's the one thing they can't take!<eos> But they can take it from you.<eos> They can and they will.<eos> Oh, they will.
-Some crazy stuff happens.<eos> -Oh, my God, it's amazing.<eos> It's all good fun.<eos> Just makes for good stories, you know?<eos> I'm beginning to have a couple of my own.<eos> You can have a good time as well. It's allowed.<eos> Anything you want.<eos> You just have to ask.<eos> -Don't forget.<eos> -Oh, I won't.
Oh, you have chops, my little one.<eos> I shall call you Ella.<eos> Ko-hoh, my mama done and hatched me.<eos> You have good pipes and bad grammar.<eos> I shall call you Billie.<eos> A son.<eos> My own blessed son!<eos> Welcome, my child, to wind and weather.<eos> I'll...<eos> I'll...
Or...<eos> Just do as I say.<eos> You know, I was run off this place once.<eos> No more.<eos> I'm staying.<eos> I'm with you, Rafe.<eos> If it wasn't for Charlie on that boat, I would have thrown myself overboard.<eos> He kept fighting no matter what.<eos> He never gave up.<eos> Neither will I.
Not Julia Russell.<eos> Not Bonny Castle.<eos> You.<eos> I love you as I know you.<eos> Because I know you.<eos> As you are.<eos> Good and bad.<eos> Better and worse.<eos> I told you this already, but you didn't believe me.<eos> Tonight you will.
Maggie, you know Eleanor Roosevelt?<eos> Nikita Khrushchev!<eos> I'm just writing to them to ask for help for my family.<eos> Well, what is it, Maggie?<eos> Maybe we can help you.<eos> My youngest child, Zsuzsi, was left behind in Hungary.<eos> She lives with a family in the country.<eos> My husband says that the Americans will help us.<eos> So I keep writing them.<eos> Well, they will. We will.
This is really nice of you to do this for me.<eos> And I'm sorry if I went too far, but I did need this ride.<eos> So I really appreciate it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you plan to do with that?<eos> Commit a heinous crime. What else?<eos> You'll wait for me, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course you will.
Very tall.<eos> Of course he's taller than me.<eos> How tall are you?<eos> Tall enough.<eos> I'd say 6 feet.<eos> Long lashes, brown eyes.<eos> He's kind of got that sexy, intellectual, preppy thing going on.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, cool.<eos> Yeah, I will.
Should we go and get the horses?<eos> No, a single horse, and ride like we used to.<eos> The good times have returned.<eos> I hear you've met a hundred princesses.<eos> Come, I'll show you something.<eos> You see that girl down there?<eos> You must promise to tell no one.<eos> We're to be married.<eos> Do you love her?<eos> I will, Sister.
- What happened?<eos> - He died.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorrv.<eos> - Whv should vou be?<eos> Well, vou loved him.<eos> We shouldn't talk like this.<eos> It's not safe.<eos> Your father, he's a good man.<eos> He'll understand vou had no choice.<eos> No, he won't.
We're not just friends.<eos> I'm sorry, Paulie.<eos> Are you okay?<eos> In her eyes, that brightness, heh?<eos> Just like my fake mother... that brightness when she lies...<eos> Make you big and strong.<eos> You can fly far away from here.<eos> You can fly far away from here.<eos> We will fly away from here.<eos> We will away from here forever.
Drake? Did he ever show up?<eos> Uh, no, man. lt's weird. No-one's seen him.<eos> Hey, listen, Danny. This is gonna be a completely different kind of device, OK?<eos> Stupid thing.<eos> D'you have any idea how that made me look? - ln front of Curtis and Lina. - l know, I know.<eos> I'm sorry. lt won't happen again, OK?<eos> I got a brand-new timer plus a back-up power source.<eos> Gotta kill some Jews.<eos> It's all I ever talk about and this time it's gotta happen.<eos> It will.
You go back now... just go back. You...<eos> I have seen you again, that's enough for me.<eos> Go back.<eos> Do you know Bhaiyya, you often said when I was a child That mother loved you more than me.<eos> I never liked it then.<eos> I used to get angry.<eos> But today, I would like to tell you, that you were right.<eos> Mother loves you more than me.<eos> She loves you too much.<eos> And she will always.

Your voice drew me.<eos> I am warrior blood.<eos> You risk death.<eos> I am dead.<eos> My warrior.<eos> Pawan, this place is unfit for a horse like you.<eos> Wait here.<eos> Look, another one in search of the same thing.<eos> You won't find...<eos> Nobody will.
Who are you people?<eos> Let me go.<eos> Wait.<eos> - But Prince Asoka, he tried to...<eos> - Spare him.<eos> 'Prince' Asoka?<eos> - You'll stay here.<eos> - Pawan is waiting for me.<eos> His kind never return.<eos> He will, Bheema.
Then it must be nice to me.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Otherwise, my father will not let go.<eos> Do not say that, did he?<eos> Just kidding.<eos> My father did not can not arrest you there ...<eos> Yes you can! He can arrest me.<eos> So there it is.<eos> But I will not stay, Shelly.<eos> - Okay. - I will not.
They took her.<eos> Now she's lost, like our cause.<eos> Just another bauble in the king's crown.<eos> Look here, we just gotta rescue her.<eos> You know what I'm saying?<eos> Take out the king.<eos> Who here will fight?<eos> Who's ready to rumble?<eos> Nobody? !<eos> I will.
Brought you a brochure.<eos> Know what he's done now?<eos> Dug around in my drawers.<eos> -Are you sure?<eos> -Of course I'm sure!<eos> -He can't do that.<eos> -No.<eos> -Tell him.<eos> -Sure ...<eos> -I will.
Children suffer the worst when parents quarrel.<eos> I've come to know very well<eos> In our case, who suffered?<eos> Our kids<eos> Now that they have found happiness... you are leaving.<eos> No, I'm not going to let you leave Archana<eos> No Raj<eos> I am leaving.<eos> You won't go Archana.<eos> - I will
I like tango.<eos> "I would never make myself as I am.<eos> To do so would be my undoing".<eos> Oli.<eos> What?<eos> You have to find a job.<eos> Do you want to live with me?<eos> What if the electricity runs out?<eos> It will never run out.<eos> But our money will.
He hasn't come home in 2 days.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Men are like that...<eos> He beats me up.<eos> The problem is that he beats her.<eos> She's going through a crisis.<eos> Think about your kids!<eos> - I don't have any.<eos> - She doesn't have any.<eos> - But you will.
I'll stay here and die with you!<eos> Master Transcendental...<eos> We can't get out, we've been surrounded!<eos> It's Insomnia's spirit!<eos> Thunder, take the master and go now!<eos> Be careful!<eos> Teacher, what now?<eos> We must merge.<eos> You must not hesitate like Hollow did.<eos> I won't this time!
One man wasn't enough for a monster who sucked out a man's vital essence and killed him.<eos> That's ridiculous.<eos> Just idle gossip.<eos> You're starting to dry up.<eos> Finished for the day?<eos> I'll be by at four.<eos> What for?<eos> To meet my father.<eos> I guess I'll have to join you.<eos> No you won't.
- Yes, Mr. President?<eos> - Anwar...<eos> Gamal, are you there?<eos> Yes.<eos> Is something wrong?<eos> Abdel Hakim's dead. He committed suicide; I just got the news.<eos> Yet if I were in his place on June 5 I'd have done the same.<eos> My condolences<eos> I want you to come over.<eos> Yes, I will.
Betty!<eos> Came on. Your seatbelt!<eos> When I have my own shop, I'll hire an assistant, an accountant... Then I'll move into my own bedsit, what the fuck!<eos> - You'll be my driver. - Bugger off!<eos> And if she wants to, she can keep the shop in that building.<eos> We have to turn left, via Cernavoda.<eos> And they'll keep the busimess?<eos> Ovarian, you'll be a big boss...<eos> And you'll keep giving them money?<eos> Sure I will.
Sell it if you like, there'd be enough money to start a company.<eos> I see...<eos> you've got everything planned.<eos> When a man grows up, he should marry and have a child. I've always thought so.<eos> You know that.<eos> I forgot.<eos> Finished.<eos> Don't make this harder.<eos> Sit next to me for a while.<eos> Will you?
Today. Now.<eos> This very moment<eos> Now... there's no pain...<eos> I feel good<eos> It's peaceful here<eos> You're a good boy, Siddharth<eos> You always stood by me<eos> You want me to be happy, don't you...<eos> Then... you be happy<eos> You will, won't you?
I'm sorry.<eos> Come on, sis.<eos> I really didn't want to fight but those guys.<eos> Trust me once.<eos> You're starting to piss me off.<eos> Follow me!<eos> Sis!<eos> Sis!<eos> Sis!<eos> Sis, I won't!
He'll never come!<eos> I told him... I'd kill you.<eos> He still won't come!<eos> If he does, the police will be with him.<eos> The pigs?<eos> I still told him I'd kill you.<eos> Screw you!<eos> He'll come.<eos> He won't.<eos> He will.

They made a great team<eos> - There's a girl in STF?<eos> - She's hot!<eos> She's a computer nerd<eos> They say she's hot but evil<eos> Don't get near her, man<eos> I never win anything!<eos> It's a bad omen.<eos> I shouldn't lead the van today.<eos> Who will, then?
Yes I heard right now I'm so happy!<eos> How aboutyou Young-hee?<eos> Well I'm alright...<eos> You knowthat I like waiting<eos> One or two years No... I'll going to wait untill "Busio" back, what ever it takes five or six years<eos> Oh!<eos> I Think, I'm always waiting<eos> Anyway, Sung-hee lt's good for you...<eos> Cheer up!<eos> Maby, I'll... lnnkeeper
Just stand on that tape line.<eos> Look, forget this guy.<eos> I can't waste any more time, J.J.<eos> We need to make a decision now.<eos> All right, we've got plenty of good choices.<eos> Let's cut it off, Kate.<eos> That would be a mistake, J.J.<eos> Kate, the client wants to move on.<eos> We should see this last guy.<eos> It'll... Two minutes!
She intercepted the first one and threw it away.<eos> When she got home, I was so mad at her.<eos> I guess I accused her, and I...<eos> I said things to her I shouldn't have said.<eos> There isn't a parent in the world who hasn't been there.<eos> Last night, when I told her good night, she wouldn't even acknowledge me.<eos> I actually had the thought that I'd be... I'd be so glad when she got out of the house.<eos> When Janet wakes up, she'll know where Kim is and then we'll find her.<eos> - I just hope it'll be that easy.<eos> - It will.
Cheers.<eos> Are your parents really away?<eos> Somebody's always gotta bang the glass.<eos> This year it's me.<eos> I wanted all of you to be here for what I'm about to do, which is probably going to be one of the most embarrassing moments ever.<eos> This thing is burning a hole in my pocket.<eos> The last stop, baby.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, Charlie, I will.
I only talk to Sloane.<eos> That was the agreement.<eos> If you were who you say you are, you would know that.<eos> Mr Schiller, I swear to you.<eos> Sloane is a liar.<eos> He has nothing to do with the CIA.<eos> So you say Sloane is a fraud?<eos> How do I know it's not you who is the fraud?<eos> You don't.<eos> But you will.
Did you bring your passport?<eos> Our mother was killed.<eos> I found her body in a state medical facility.<eos> I identified her, paid for her release.<eos> Made arrangements with a mausoleum in Moscow three blocks from where she was born.<eos> I thought she'd want it that way.<eos> And you have no idea who was responsible, who killed her?<eos> No.<eos> I swear to god, somehow I will find out who did this to our mother... and I will kill him.<eos> I will.
-I hear you're still coming on to Glenn.<eos> -Jenny, they're Christmas songs.<eos> When a guy moves on somebody else's girl, they settle it with fists.<eos> With women, they talk things out.<eos> I prefer the guy way.<eos> -You're gonna hit me?<eos> -That's a warning.<eos> -Excuse me, Jenny.<eos> Don't ever push me.<eos> Oh, but, Elaine, I will.
Shouldn't I be walking you home?<eos> That's okay.<eos> I had such a wonderful time.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Really.<eos> You helped me. You have no idea.<eos> It's late.<eos> My parents are probably wondering.<eos> You know, you will meet somebody.<eos> I will, and you will.
But, you had a deal.<eos> Did you really think that I was gonna stick to that deal?<eos> That is so sweet.<eos> When you get serious, you know where to find me.<eos> And so do you.<eos> She wants me.<eos> She really wants me!<eos> She wants to get you alone, slit your throat, and rifle your pockets.<eos> - But go ahead, see for yourself.<eos> - I will.
Besides, you are...early.<eos> Confession's not supposed to come until after I commit the crime.<eos> I never took you for a man who flees from the consequences of his decisions.<eos> I'm not fleeing.<eos> I just have to run an errand.<eos> - Wanna come?<eos> - Most definitely.<eos> Don't tell me...<eos> You've got a plan.<eos> Okay, I won't.
Dawn is a part of me.<eos> The only part that I...<eos> We'll solve this. We will.<eos> Don't have another coma, OK?<eos> If the ritual starts, every living creature in this and every other dimension imaginable will suffer unbearable torment and death.<eos> including Dawn.<eos> Then the last thing she'll see is me protecting her.<eos> You'll fail.<eos> You'll die.<eos> We all will.
Let me remind you, you have the right to counsel.<eos> I don't need counsel.<eos> The only person I was hiding from was my wife.<eos> She knows everything now.<eos> So ask your questions.<eos> We found some of Paige's hair in your car.<eos> Well, that's impossible because she's never been in my car.<eos> Are you sure it was hers?<eos> You mean, uh, will it stand up in court?<eos> Yes, it will.
Doesn't even come close.<eos> And now the very thing I've been trying so hard not to be is the very thing I might have to become.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> Sykes has done a good job of emulating me, emulating Belthazor, which means, if the potion doesn't work, the only way to destroy him is for me to turn into Belthazor.<eos> Yeah, but then afterwards you'll turn back into Cole.<eos> I may not be able to.<eos> To stop him, I'll have to embrace my demonic self completely.<eos> There may be no coming back from that.<eos> Well, then we'll just have to make sure that potion works very well.<eos> Won't we?
I know she would have made that choice herself.<eos> Although I don't think she would've been too keen on us orbing up here.<eos> Which is why we gotta get out of here before we all get in trouble.<eos> Okay, wait a second.<eos> No five-cent tour, no meet the Elders?<eos> - We're going.<eos> - Leo.<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> It's not like we get to remember it anyway.<eos> You will this time.
- Oh, no.<eos> Leo.<eos> - What?<eos> We killed him.<eos> Oh, Leo.<eos> Thank God you're okay.<eos> Actually, it had more to do with what you guys did.<eos> Vanquishing Zile broke the bond and reversed all the evil you had done.<eos> I just hope the wedding planners don't remember what we did to them.<eos> Unfortunately, they will.
Why can't he?<eos> I don't know.<eos> But look, he's completely different with you.<eos> He never really took me seriously, you know that.<eos> I was just like a sex object to him-- it was embarrassing.<eos> If i wore the wrong dress, he'd have to keep his legs crossed all evening.<eos> I'm sure he's never like that with you.<eos> Really--are you?<eos> It's only that i went out with him for so long-- i got really good at getting him all worked up.<eos> You will, too.
- Let's clear him surgically first.<eos> You want to catch a movie later?<eos> - You didn't get my message, I take it. - No.<eos> Did something change?<eos> The meeting was canceled.<eos> We took a conference call and agreed on a settlement figure.<eos> That means we accept guilt?<eos> It means the hospital's gonna take it in the shorts to the tune of $1.5 million.<eos> But our insurance will pay that.<eos> And so will we, with sky-high premiums.
Not a single trauma in the bunch.<eos> Hello. - That's mine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> - Go home, Dave.<eos> - I'm on till 8:00.<eos> - No, you're not.<eos> In fact, you're not on for the rest of the week.<eos> Says who? - Says me.<eos> - Does Weaver know about this?<eos> - She will.
You telling me that you've never had a CVI malfunction<eos> In the early stages of implantation and adaptation, yes.<eos> There were a number of anomalies so however we have eliminated those.<eos> You forgot to mention the human immune system has made them inaffective.<eos> Yes, they are past the usefulness.<eos> But we believe the technology served its purpose... smoothed the unification of our species.<eos> Ex-protector Robert Brody's CVI just killed him.<eos> Impossible!<eos> - I received no report.<eos> - And you won't.
I went to the streets to find out.<eos> Would you kiss this guy? - Ugh!<eos> No! - No way!<eos> Oh, God, no!<eos> What's the matter with you? Oh!<eos> It's official.<eos> Neil Goldman isn't kissable.<eos> Hear that, Neil?<eos> I don't like you.<eos> I never will!
Is this the truth?<eos> !<eos> Yes, yes!<eos> Every word!<eos> Make this ship operational... and I'll grant you and easy death.<eos> You sure this thing's unlocked?<eos> I'm not feelin' any smarter.<eos> Give it some time.<eos> All right, but somethin' better kick in before that Dreadnought gets here.<eos> It will.
Well, you had better tell that four-armed, bug-eyed, whiny little slijot to get his dren together.<eos> It's not him. The stresses on Moya are frying junctions everywhere.<eos> She's dying, D'Argo.<eos> The wormhole is killing her.<eos> Do you hope someday to be Dominar, Rygel?<eos> I am is still Dominar.<eos> Always Dominar.<eos> I mean, ruling from a throne instead of a throne sled.<eos> They'll never know if I kill Crichton.<eos> But you will...
-Joey, what are you doing?<eos> -Just what needs to be done.<eos> -Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..<eos> -This is crazy.<eos> Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!<eos> -Where were we?<eos> Do you take this man..?<eos> -No!<eos> -You'll take him.<eos> -No, I won't!
- So, would you like some coffee?<eos> - Did you read Rory's paper yet?<eos> - Not yet.<eos> - It's really good.<eos> - I'm sure it is.<eos> - Look, it's right on top.<eos> - Isn't that a coincidence?<eos> There are some really big words in here.<eos> I hope you have a dictionary with you when you read it.<eos> I will.
Good idea.<eos> After all, Sunday's the day of rest... and that's what you'll be doing.<eos> Because it's boring. It's not your fault. You didn't write the damn thing.<eos> I'll come on Sunday, too.<eos> But if you're going to go on Sunday, you don't want to spoil it for yourself.<eos> - It's not like I don't know how it ends.<eos> - Okay, look. Rory, I'll sit in the back, you'll die, and I'll walk you home.<eos> - It's no big deal, right?<eos> - Right. Good. So I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Yep, you sure will.
Bangs would hide that.<eos> Party at my house Saturday.<eos> Dress to impress, please.<eos> - Come?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You could bring your boyfriend.<eos> - I'll see.<eos> - Meet me after Biology?<eos> - And if I don't?<eos> You will.
- Did you?<eos> And what did you expect to say to me when I did come?<eos> When Lorelai showed up on my porch that day... with a tiny baby in her arms, I thought to myself: 'What if this were my daughter... 'and she was cold and scared and needed a place to live?<eos> 'What would I want for her? '<eos> And then I thought, 'I'd want her to find somebody... 'to take her in and make her safe and help her find her way. '<eos> That's funny.<eos> I would've wanted her to find someone who would send her home.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I'd appreciate if you didn't mention this to Lorelai.<eos> I won't.
- It'll work out.<eos> How are the boys?<eos> - 'They're fine.<eos> They miss you.'<eos> Tommy especially.<eos> Says your name every day. He cries.<eos> I don't know what to tell him.<eos> I gotta go now, Stephanie.<eos> Tell them I love them.<eos> I will.
IT'S JUST...<eos> I'M SUPPOSED TO BRING "MY LADY".<eos> DOES TRACY KNOW WHY YOU'RE ASKING HER?<eos> I COULDN'T TELL HER THAT. WELL, DON'T YOU THINK IT'S FAIR?<eos> CONSIDERING SHE'S GOING THERE THINKING THAT SHE'S YOUR LADY?<eos> HOW WOULD I KNOW WHAT SHE THINKS?<eos> BESIDES, IT'S NOT ADATEDATE, IT'S A PARTY FOR THE BOSS.<eos> IT'S BUSINESS.<eos> CHRIST, I WISH EVERYBODY WOULD JUST GET OFF MY BACK!<eos> FINE, I WILL.
Aren't there other patients you need to be seeing?<eos> Me?<eos> No, I've been off for two hours.<eos> So with your precious free time, you've been talking to an old lady.<eos> What about your list?<eos> How many have you done?<eos> For that matter, how many times have you sat on the grass and done nothing?<eos> You need to start taking some time for yourself.<eos> Promise me you'll do that.<eos> - I will.
There's so much I don't understand about bullying.<eos> Yeah. There's a lot of history there.<eos> Did you know it predates agriculture? - Mm-mmm.<eos> - Let's walk.<eos> Finish the job.<eos> I just don't understand Francine's motivation.<eos> Why does she only go after the smart ones?<eos> That's like asking the square root of a million.<eos> No one will ever know.<eos> Someone will.
- Whoa. A solid gold animal cracker.<eos> "Find the golden giraffe, and we'll send you and your family to Africa."<eos> Africa? They're bound to have food there.<eos> And on my free African safari, I wanna do everything on this box.<eos> I want to shoot a lion in the face, fight Muhammad Ali... and ride in a convertible with two happy zebras.<eos> Sir, that contest ended 30 years ago.<eos> We don't even make animal crackers anymore.<eos> We make household poisons and Christmas lights.<eos> Your box made promises of a "vacational" nature... and I expect you to live up to them.<eos> We won't though.
- I don't know.<eos> Shot at a few.<eos> Everybody thinks I burned down this house across the street.<eos> - Did you?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> What's it like to shoot a gun?<eos> You wanna try some time?<eos> - Come down to East Los, be down.<eos> - Are you serious?<eos> Because I will.
I think you should go with your instincts on this, Ralph.<eos> You do?<eos> But Furio took a hit. Chris.<eos> These are made men.<eos> I'll make sure they respect your decision.<eos> Because I'm sure you'll do the right thing.<eos> That's why I made you captain.<eos> This is Rosalie's kid.<eos> That's why I'll understand if you give him a pass.<eos> Everybody else will too.
Just relax.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Where were you ?<eos> - When ?<eos> - This morning.<eos> I was in bed.<eos> Why was today important to me, Tim ?<eos> Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
- When ?<eos> - This morning.<eos> I was in bed.<eos> Why was today important to me, Tim ?<eos> Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Being promoted to sergeant Saturday,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> Being promoted to sergeant Saturday,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> What was that ?<eos> I'm being promoted tomorrow,<eos> - don't forget.<eos> - I won't !
0r have you forgotten the good times ?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> We were supposed to go ghost-hunting last week.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Where were you ?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're happy with your new girlfriend.<eos> Don't forget whose shoulder you cried on<eos> - when you got dumped.<eos> - I won't.

Marsha, what is your problem ?<eos> I'll tell her, then.<eos> Why do you want to spoil her birthday ?<eos> Every second you leave it, it'll make it more painful for her.<eos> - What ?<eos> - I'm telling her.<eos> - Don't !<eos> - I will.<eos> If anyone tells her, I will.<eos> - You won't.
But you will not.<eos> Not now. I have observed.<eos> You value the life ofone.<eos> Yes, we do. This one is important.<eos> She is. For this reason, this one was chosen.<eos> You will not terminate this one in order to destroy me.<eos> It went into Sam out of self-preservation.<eos> I cannot be removed from this mind without terminating.<eos> You will not terminate this one.<eos> None ofyou will.
So you came here to... to what?<eos> - Preserve.<eos> - Preserve your world?<eos> Well, that's not gonna happen.<eos> Transmission was interrupted.<eos> Ifl had been able to complete transmission,... ..you would have been destroyed.<eos> My world would have been preserved. Well, in a way, you succeeded.<eos> We won't go back there.<eos> You can repair the damage and we won't send any more probes through.<eos> Yes, we will.
- We're on our way back from fighting a fire.<eos> - Get away from our house.<eos> We're trying to be nice. We brought some things for after the game:<eos> Some Ben-Gay for those broken, old bodies little box of tissue for the tears, and a telescope so you can see us down the field as we get further and further away.<eos> Whoa, you can't give us your telescope.<eos> How are you gonna find your johnson When you're taking a leak?<eos> How do you think I learned to wrestle a hose?<eos> Thought you learned how to wrestle trying to keep your wife home.<eos> WALSH: we'll see you tomorrow.<eos> - Yes, you will.
The danger.<eos> Her courage will change the world. XENA<eos> Lord Belach...<eos> More bounty hunters, I take it.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> She's staring in the face of her past.<eos> This man is the spitting image of Borias.<eos> -He was Xena's lover.<eos> -Well, have you found him?<eos> Not yet, but we will.
That is the question.<eos> Lots of room.<eos> Marty! We got a new town.<eos> Yeah, it's-- where are we again?<eos> Waterford, Vermont.<eos> It's-- where is it?<eos> That's where it is!<eos> Here, talk to Bill.<eos> You have got to get me Main Street for nothing.<eos> I will.
Sure. Sounds good.<eos> Do we not deserve that, Pelle?<eos> Aren't we worth it, when we've worked so hard?<eos> Only a few more yards!<eos> A new day is dawning!<eos> Come on then!<eos> There's a time for everything, Tomas.<eos> There's a time for everything.<eos> Your time will come, Tomas.<eos> It will...
- That's biblical.<eos> - That's real craftsmanship is what it is.<eos> - Solidas a rock.<eos> - Ooh !<eos> - It's supposed to do that.<eos> - It's perfect, guys.<eos> - And how's that egg coming ?<eos> This is a doubleyolker.<eos> - I don't see what this has to do with--<eos> You will.
Not my brother.<eos> Later.<eos> - Hey, Sleeping Beauty.<eos> - How long was I out?<eos> Not long.<eos> A few hours.<eos> Korso and Preed<eos> - I can't believe it.<eos> How long before they reach the Titan?<eos> They won't.
I used to be addicted to coke big-time. At one point...<eos> But you're better now, your face and everything.<eos> Your color's better, and you've put on weight.<eos> But I have a real hard time breathing. Me too.<eos> I can't get enough air.<eos> And I get tired easily.<eos> I walk for a bit and I'm beat.<eos> And I have a cough in the morning.<eos> I'll give you something, but you have to take it.<eos> I will.
Denise, I just wanna say that... working alongside you this past year, getting to know you and be close to you-- it's been the most wonderful time of my life.<eos> ~ The most wonderful time of his life ~<eos> How lovely.<eos> I'djust like to say that-- it doesn't matter ifyou wanna take that otherjob or if you wanna stay here.<eos> What matters to me most is that you're happy.<eos> Denise, I have something that I wanna ask you.<eos> ~ He wants to ask you ~<eos> Denise-- Denise Gaines--<eos> Yes, Sherman ?<eos> Denise, will you--

I just want you to know that for sure. That's why I wanted you to come out here tonight.<eos> Just<eos> Hope my little friends might be able to... say it better than me.<eos> Yes, Sherman Klump, I will.<eos> Will you really ?<eos> Really ?<eos> Really.<eos> Yes.<eos> I will.<eos> I really will. You will ?
I'm gonna miss playing Walter.<eos> Don't hold nothin' back.<eos> - The ball moved.<eos> It moved.<eos> I have to call a stroke on myself.<eos> No. Don't do it. Please don't do it.<eos> Only you and me seen it, and I won't tell a soul.<eos> Cross my heart.<eos> Ain't nobody gonna know.<eos> I will, Hardy.

Am I supposed to be surprised?<eos> I'll even give you my permission.<eos> Although that doesn't seem to be a thing you have ever required.<eos> Her telephone number.<eos> In the end, Mr. Cole we all get cured of our sentiments.<eos> Those whom life doesn't cure death will.<eos> She will not break her word to me.<eos> You will see.<eos> Yes, ma'am.<eos> We will.
My God, it's the Pope. Come on Dix, let's get out of here before he corners us.<eos> They serve Italian dinner tonight.<eos> I think I'll have the Toreodor.<eos> Yabooty, yabooty, you camel, pay me what you owe me.<eos> Keep a low profile.<eos> Did he call me a camel.<eos> They wanted you to play a saxophone solo after which intermission?<eos> The White House itinerary said after the first intermission that I would appear magically on stage through a trap-door.<eos> But we don't have a sax.<eos> We will.
Norman, this isn't about you.<eos> Something is happening to me.<eos> And it's not to get even, and it's not some warped bid for attention.<eos> Something is happening in our house, whether you like it or not.<eos> Claire.<eos> Claire, stop.<eos> You're overreacting.<eos> Don't tell me how to react.<eos> - Will you keep your voice down?<eos> - I will not!
He hates to fail.<eos> Thanks for a seeing me.<eos> I've got everything that you asked for.<eos> Just once I'd like to get sent something simple.<eos> That never happens anymore.<eos> The downside of being good at my job. Good?<eos> My daughter was told you were the best.<eos> Like most people, I do the best I can.<eos> Last time she passed out she regained consciousness almost immediately.<eos> Next time, or the time after, she won't.
Cum!<eos> We're gonna take it off at the shoulder.<eos> Cum!<eos> It's all right.<eos> Don't worry. You're in a hospital.<eos> - Marion?<eos> - Who's that?<eos> She'll be sent for.<eos> She'll come.<eos> No, she won't.
She melted my heart.<eos> That was it.<eos> You got anybody?<eos> Yeah, kinda.<eos> There's somethin' I gotta work out, but... she's worth it.<eos> No, you, um, go ahead.<eos> You, uh, get some rest. I'm...<eos> I'm tired too.<eos> I almost don't wanna click off here like... maybe we won't get this back.<eos> We will.
I know the feeling.<eos> You once said when I had a family of my own, l`d understand.<eos> You were right.<eos> You`re trying to tell me something.<eos> -Apple?<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Anne Patricia Howard will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage?<eos> Will you love, comfort and honor him for so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
You`re trying to tell me something.<eos> -Apple?<eos> -Thank you.<eos> Congratulations.<eos> Anne Patricia Howard will you have this man to be your husband to live in marriage?<eos> Will you love, comfort and honor him for so long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.<eos> Gabriel Edward Martin, will you have this woman to be your wife to live together in the covenant of marriage?<eos> Will you love, comfort and honor her as long as you both shall live?<eos> I will.
- For 10,000?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> You said we were doin' this for 15.<eos> I changed my mind.<eos> But if you think I should try to find somebody else, I can...<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> Listen, why don't we make it... 12,500?<eos> I can live with 12,500.<eos> As long as my husband doesn't.<eos> He won't.
Move it!<eos> Grab my hand, damn it! Grab it!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> He needs dex. Now.<eos> No.<eos> We stick to the schedule.<eos> In nine hours, the water runs out.<eos> We need it. Our lives depend on it.<eos> He'll die if he doesn't get it.<eos> He will anyway.
Too bad.<eos> I knew you'd return.<eos> But that means that Cosette...<eos> I'd rather not talk about it.<eos> No matter what she may have do to you, I need fighters, no dead bodies.<eos> You'll need the best of luck in particular.<eos> Take this body to my grand father monsieur Gillenormand, rue Filles du Calvaire.<eos> Eponine, what brings you here?<eos> I'll die.<eos> - No, you won't.
And my rule of thumb is, when you get home, get yourself a plant.<eos> I like spider plants, but whatever turns you on.<eos> Then, in about a year, get a pet.<eos> And then, if, in say... two years, the plant and the pet are still alive... then you can start to think about having a relationship.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I'll be fine. I know what to do.<eos> Don't drink, go to meetings, find a sponsor, ask for help.<eos> Don't drink, go to meetings, find a sponsor, ask for help.<eos> Well, I hope he makes it.<eos> Statistically, only three out of 10 of us will.
- I'd have done exactly the same thing. - That's you, is it, Billy?<eos> You could do that to someone?<eos> In principle.<eos> Billy, don't get involved with this bloke.<eos> See him, Peter, oh, he's the top boy. He runs the show.<eos> Him, Wayne, does whatever Peter tells him. And Jason... Well, every firm needs a mad acidbath murderer, don't they?<eos> What do you think of my hair, Billy?<eos> - You look like a fuckin' poof. - Fuck off!<eos> What?<eos> Fuck of, will ya?
I'll be as quick as I can.<eos> Matthew, can you watch your sister?<eos> -Matthew.<eos> -All right, fine.<eos> Come here, Beth.<eos> -Can I come with you?<eos> -No, baby, I'll just be a second.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I'm only sorry you couldn't meet Erin.<eos> -I will.
Be a star<eos> Shine bright, shine far<eos> Be a star<eos> Where you live, where you are Be a star!<eos> Get all of your friends and let's get together<eos> We can make a change that'll last forever<eos> It's all about love...<eos> Did you see that big lady dancing?<eos> - This is a night I'll never forget.<eos> - Neither will anyone else.
I'm retired.<eos> - Do it.<eos> - This is madness.<eos> I've had enough of this Crime and Punishment bollocks.<eos> I'm happy here.<eos> I won't let you be happy! Why should I?<eos> - Friday, the Grosvenor, you'll be there.<eos> - I won't. You will.<eos> I'm telling Ted you're doing it.<eos> - No, I won't.

Then you're pushing him.<eos> You can't humiliate my guy like this!<eos> Ira, I need your support.<eos> File your protest, but don't ask me to get involved.<eos> I will say this.<eos> Let the boxers box, and that'll speak for itself.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Hector, if this happens... I'm telling Adrian no mercy.<eos> You understand?<eos> Yeah. So will she.
Could those words be any sexier?<eos> I want to produce your play.<eos> Okay.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Do you want to go out back?<eos> Yeah .<eos> Come on .<eos> Hey, can you cover my station?<eos> No, not if you're going outside.<eos> Okay, we won't.
I couldn't not get it.<eos> They wanted to take it in a different direction .<eos> My whole life, my destiny stopped 'cause their compass is fucked .<eos> You didn't have to lie about it.<eos> I couldn't have everyone know.<eos> This was the one.<eos> Hey, man !<eos> Congratulations, man .<eos> Who knows the next time I'm gonna get a chance like this?<eos> You will .
life AFTER LOVE<eos> Will you take Sophie foryourwife and love herfaithfully, through good and bad times, forthe rest of your life?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> -We're waiting impatiently foryour answer, Mr. Gervais.<eos> Yes, I want her... I mean, I do, I will...<eos> Yes, I will, too.
That's wonderful.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine. OK.<eos> Denny?<eos> Denny?<eos> Denny! Dad, I'm here.<eos> Oh, OK.<eos> You'll be the ring bearer for now.<eos> I'm not wearing that stupid pillow on my head.<eos> Oh, yes, you damn well will!
And maybe even a bit... hungry.<eos> Bother.<eos> Pooh, you gotta help me find Tigger.<eos> It's all my fault.<eos> He never would have left if it wasn't 'cause of me.<eos> I didn't mean to make him feel bad.<eos> I just- - I-l just wanted him to-- to be my big brother.<eos> We gotta go find him.<eos> We just gotta.<eos> And so we will.
A little.<eos> - Atul. Boys. The cruise tickets have come.<eos> Yours and yours.<eos> The cruise leaves exactly at 9 O'clock for Singapore. Okay? - Okay.<eos> But I don't want to come.<eos> What!<eos> - Come on, Sonia. Don't spoil the fun.<eos> But I'm not in the mood!<eos> Fine! Don't come!<eos> Neither will Rohit!
It's a matter for the individual.<eos> I could start by praying a girl would come along whom I wasn't scared of.<eos> - You could, yes.<eos> - She might also come by herself.<eos> That'd probably be better.<eos> - One can tell you're a pastor.<eos> - Can one?<eos> - It's not going very well, though.<eos> - No.<eos> But it will.
- And Zezinho?<eos> - What about him?<eos> Couldn't he sleep either?<eos> Zezinho doesn't do anything... poor thing.<eos> Are you jealous, Ciro?<eos> Me,jealous of an old man like that?<eos> That's just the way I see it.<eos> Stop that, stop!<eos> Stop that!<eos> I will not.
-Capitalist scum!<eos> -l'll heal you in Moscow!<eos> You wanted your whore?<eos> Up yours!<eos> Asshole!<eos> Take him away.<eos> Now!<eos> -Forgive me, Misha.<eos> -You'll wait for me?<eos> Of course I will.
- Wherever you feel like taking us.<eos> - Up there?<eos> Up. This nice man's taking us where he's headed.<eos> Could you turn off the radio?<eos> Turn it off?<eos> For a lousy fare? This cab cost a fortune!<eos> The lousy fare feeds you!<eos> Gonna eat your tires?<eos> You don't like it, get out!<eos> We will!
But, we don't know each other well.<eos> I'm really serious.<eos> I'm not just saying this.<eos> If you can trust me, maybe you could start a relationship with me.<eos> I'm asking for the last time.<eos> No.<eos> I see.<eos> Then, I should apologize.<eos> I'm sorry. Please forgive me.<eos> I will.
We don't have much more time. - Okay, Coach.<eos> Sit down, boys.<eos> I would have been here earlier, but I wanted to wait for things to calm down.<eos> - It's always the same!<eos> At least, be honest this time.<eos> You didn't come.<eos> - How are you doing?<eos> Very well.<eos> I don't want to lose you.<eos> - You won't.
- I keep my money here.<eos> Want to try?<eos> Want to try again?<eos> I have to get back to work.<eos> - Come and work here, with me.<eos> - No.<eos> I talk to Yasmin and her brother. They want to meet us. I don't want to meet her.<eos> I've told you, I don't like it.<eos> You have to get married.<eos> - I will, but not to her.
Don't tell the agency, but I have a boyfriend.<eos> We moved in together.<eos> So I rarely go back to Seiwa Heights.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> Yes.<eos> I'm from Ebara All-Serve.<eos> Oh, great.<eos> I can't let go right now.<eos> Let yourself in.<eos> OK, I will.
It's the only and last thing that I can do for the tribe.<eos> I'm the only one who can do this!<eos> I'm coming<eos> And you're ruining it!<eos> If you care about me, don't do this.<eos> Nothing ever happened.<eos> Consider it as a dream.<eos> To Mt.<eos> Take me there.<eos> Will you?
How could the High Guard let it happen?<eos> We had ten times as many ships, a hundred times as many men.<eos> And we haven't fought a war a real war, in over a thousand years.<eos> Whereas for the Nietzscheans, every day is a battle.<eos> It can't be all gone.<eos> The Commonwealth spanned three galaxies!<eos> We had over a million member worlds, orbital habitats, asteroid colonies.<eos> Part of it must still exist somewhere.<eos> Then we have to find it.<eos> We will.
We promise to be bad if you do.<eos> Angel....<eos> - I'm sorry I didn't get there in time.<eos> - I'm not.<eos> He's soul-sick.<eos> Not even thinking about his own family.<eos> Only thinking about them.<eos> Come on, love.<eos> I never did get that goodbye kiss.<eos> You will.
'<eos> Where's Manny?<eos> Not here.<eos> Well, how can I find him?<eos> You could become a terrible event and happen to him.<eos> I really wanted to tell him this thing.<eos> What's all this telling Manny everything business?<eos> Tell me.<eos> No, you won't get it.<eos> - No, I will.
He's not even our whitelighter anymore.<eos> Besides, with Dan in my life...<eos> - But if Leo knew you were sick?<eos> - No, and that's final.<eos> No demon or warlock did this to me.<eos> Just let the doctors do their magic.<eos> All right.<eos> Well, I just wanted you to get well soon.<eos> I know.<eos> And I will.
"Tyra L. Wilson."<eos> My daughter.<eos> She was murdered six and a half months ago here waiting for the bus.<eos> I'm looking for a witness.<eos> That's why you were sitting here all day yesterday.<eos> That's why I'm here every day.<eos> I have been since the police quit on us.<eos> I'm not leaving until I find somebody who saw what happened.<eos> How can you be sure that you will?<eos> I will.
Well, he has our powers, but that doesn't necessarily mean he knows how to use them.<eos> Besides, do you have a better idea?<eos> Go home and call it a day?<eos> Funny, come on.<eos> See?<eos> You're not the only one, Gail.<eos> Everybody wants to be young and attractive.<eos> The difference is I knew what I was giving up.<eos> They don't.<eos> Oh, they will, one day.
You can't just leave without letting her know.<eos> I mean, that's not like you.<eos> You don't just stand and let things happen.<eos> And you don't run away, either.<eos> You have to tell her that you love her.<eos> And you have to try to get her back.<eos> Because if you don't I promise you, you will regret it.<eos> -Maybe.<eos> -No, Pacey.<eos> You will.
But that's just a woman thing.<eos> The only problem with children is they grow up to be adults.<eos> Yes, eventually we have opinions.<eos> I know. But do you have to express them?<eos> It's a learned response.<eos> I'll give you that.<eos> I suggest the four of us go out sort of bury the hatchet.<eos> Mark thinks it's a great idea.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> He will.
I don't recall this girl.<eos> You're already charged with murder. Why cause more needless grief?<eos> Needless grief is what I do best.<eos> Oh, fine, then!<eos> Wait.<eos> Wait!<eos> Look, I don't know-<eos> If I talk, will you be my doctor?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Then I will.
Your own history is full of such exemples.<eos> Do not over simplefy what is a terribly complex idea devised by a human.<eos> Our evolution was interrupted by you.<eos> You must take responsability for the changes that we did not ask for.<eos> Thank you, Mr President... for reminding me of what I'm must do.<eos> I will take it under advisement.<eos> You are dismissed.<eos> Fine... and I'll await your decision.<eos> Yes.<eos> You will.
I'll go at once.<eos> Talyn demands that we send over Crais.<eos> What?<eos> - He said he wants Crais?<eos> - He can't have him.<eos> Pilot, get that boy on the phone.<eos> He is unwilling to discuss it further.<eos> He says he'll fire upon us unless we agree to return Crais now.<eos> Pilot, evasives.<eos> Moya won't.
Great...<eos> Now all I have to do is get to the Prowler.<eos> Well I'll give you a diversion.<eos> How much head start do you think you'll need ?<eos> Give me 400 microts.<eos> Go !<eos> One more, sir, please ! Please, one more !<eos> I got my mind right, boss.<eos> - Be nice.<eos> - We will.
Crichton succeeded.<eos> Then I'm not going to die.<eos> As you once said to me... you will die... but not today.<eos> Are you sure about that ?<eos> I'm starting to hallucinate.<eos> You make a worse Peacekeeper than Crichton.<eos> Glad to see you're okay.<eos> Where is he ?<eos> I want to see him.<eos> You will... soon.
My mask!<eos> Help me!<eos> Help me!<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> My mask keeps my energies in check.<eos> I... I wasn't prepared to lose it.<eos> I... I lost control.<eos> I wasn't focused.<eos> D'Argo, that didn't help.<eos> Oh, and Stark's lies will?
Why did that have to happen?<eos> Come on, it's not that big a deal.<eos> Not that big a deal?<eos> There was touching of things.<eos> I know you wanted to bond with my dad... ... butdidyouhavetobond to that part?<eos> I'm sure Dad doesn't care.<eos> He probably thought it was funny.<eos> He'll be telling this story for years.<eos> I don't want him to tell this story for years.<eos> Oh, but he will.
All day we'd play bingo, eat oatmeal and wait for our children to call.<eos> It's more horrible than anything I could imagine.<eos> Oh, my, yes.<eos> Thank you all for saving me.<eos> Especially you, my little clone.<eos> No matter what you decide to do with your life, I'm still proud of you.<eos> I've already decided.<eos> Dad, when I grow up I want to be just like you.<eos> Oh, don't worry, son.<eos> You will.
I'm sure you were a worthy opponent, as always.<eos> I was worried you wouldn't show.<eos> Of course I would have.<eos> When are you leaving?<eos> Ten minutes ago.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry, Mic.<eos> It seems cut short.<eos> Maybe you can visit me down under.<eos> New location, no worries, you know.<eos> Maybe I will.
Who have you told about this?<eos> Looks like now you're gonna need some help calling off your engagement.<eos> Let's just say I have some experience in this arena.<eos> No. I meant what I said.<eos> You take a bullet for her. Jen is my future.<eos> -Are you tellin' me you're in love with her?<eos> Let's just say I'm in love with what she can give me-a get-out-of-jail-free card.<eos> So, tonight, when we're safe, Jenna radios her boss and I give them the fat cat... and we get a little beach house in a sexy, non-extradition country.<eos> If she follows the plan.<eos> -She will.
Come on!<eos> There's no guard.<eos> Where's the guard?<eos> My communication pieces shorted out. Sorry.<eos> Don't you ever leave me hanging out like that again. You understand? - [Alarm Beeping]<eos> - Come on, move! Let's get outta here! Move!<eos> [Groans] Myinsides are starting to boil.<eos> - Come on. It won't be long now.<eos> - [Groaning] I don't want to lose my baby.<eos> - You won't.
- I won't leave you.<eos> - No, no, no.<eos> Max, you have to.<eos> If I'm successful, if I can do this, you and I won't exist.<eos> Not as we do now. Max, if you don't do this, we're gonna die.<eos> Everyone will.
- I don't know.<eos> - You guys just keep going.<eos> - What?<eos> - Maria and I will stay here so they can catch us.<eos> - It's all right. We'll say we got lost in the woods.<eos> This is too important. Keep going.<eos> - Are you sure?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> The important thing is you find what you're looking for.<eos> - I will. - All right.
That's her, John and Mary's baby.<eos> Oh, I see, yes.<eos> Looks very... fully functioning.<eos> Is that really the best you can do?<eos> Sorry, I've never been very good with them.<eos> - Babies?<eos> - Humans.<eos> Moriarty - did he have any connection with Thatcher?<eos> Any interest in her?<eos> Why on earth would he?
Apparently, they're attached to their children, and they want to see them touch the ball.<eos> They can touch it in the team photo.<eos> I'm going to draw up a play.<eos> One where you pass.<eos> Why don't you pass a physical, you boozy bag of goo.<eos> Marge is right.<eos> You're getting spoiled!<eos> Before you strangle me, maybe you should check the scoreboard.<eos> I'm your dad and your coach.<eos> And because no one else would, your godfather.
I'm trying to decide whether i'm happy or sad.<eos> People usually know.<eos> I'm sad because-- Because my husband doubts my love for him.<eos> And happy...?<eos> I'm happy because the first time In a long time, i'm hopeful.<eos> For us.<eos> Would you dance with me?<eos> I just want to hold you,<eos> Look into your eyes, Be in love with you, And feel you being in love with me.<eos> Would you?
And then it got worse.<eos> Clay...<eos> Helmet... your name does not belong on this list.<eos> But you need to be here if I'm going to tell my story.<eos> If I'm going to explain why I did what I did.<eos> Because you aren't every other guy.<eos> You're different.<eos> You're good and kind... and decent.<eos> And I didn't deserve to be with someone like you.<eos> I never would.
He wanted it to be him.<eos> "Duane"?<eos> Benjamin... Benjamin...<eos> That's why Benjamin...<eos> Morgan... let us take our leave.<eos> I was supposed to.<eos> Morgan, you should not be alone here.<eos> Go.<eos> Not now.<eos> - Benjamin not... would not...
But I know now that I was full-tilt delusional.<eos> I have never in my life been as scared as I was that night in the woods, kit to the grit, fully believing my number's about to be called, then seeing it happen to someone brave to a survivor.<eos> And then the pants-pissing terror of the rinse and repeat of that very same event...<eos> I just...<eos> I couldn't.<eos> Being here means I'll never have to again.<eos> And neither will you if you just say "yes."<eos> Please say "yes."<eos> He would want you to.<eos> He wouldn't.
I was just trying to break the tension.<eos> Oh, there's no tension here.<eos> - Right, Mitch?<eos> Back me up, buddy.<eos> Who'd have thunk it, when we first met at your farm stand, that one day, we'd be standing here, shoulder to shoulder... the gay ex-husband, the new lover, supporting our lady.<eos> I mean... your lady, my ex-lady.<eos> It's all good.<eos> We're cool.<eos> I think now might be a good time to go over and say hi.<eos> I wouldn't.
Ma'am, can I get you anything?<eos> My staff.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Back up.<eos> The van that delivered the bombs...<eos> Sekou was driving it.<eos> Well, hello.<eos> Her school is closed, and I've got a crisis at work.<eos> You want me to babysit?<eos> Would you?
I've gone off on vacation somewhere, off the grid.<eos> They need to reach me immediately.<eos> Do I have a favorite place I like to go, somewhere I've always dreamed of going?<eos> And then, it will get uglier.<eos> - "Uglier"?<eos> - The less you tell them.<eos> They'll call me a traitor, want to know if I ever talked of going over to the other side, selling secrets to the highest bidder.<eos> For Christ's sakes, that's absurd, Saul.<eos> Harry and Leo would never believe that.<eos> No one would.
And the whole stadium was getting into it.<eos> And when the ball came over to our seats, you stood up and you just whacked it.<eos> It was the first time I'd seen you smile in forever.<eos> But then the ball went into the aisle... and this usher ran down and grabbed it and he picked it up, and he just squeezed the air out of it.<eos> And then everyone started booing.<eos> Not just the people in our section, but the whole stadium, booing.<eos> He just ruined it for all of them.<eos> They just wanted to hit the ball.<eos> Why would he wanna do that job?<eos> Why would anyone?
U.N. Security Council, I have been monitoring this incredible situation on Eros, and believe I have a solution.<eos> The O.P.A. has a ship in visual range of Eros, that can use its laser-guidance system to paint the target for your missiles.<eos> But given the signal delay to Earth, my technicians would need to steer the missiles in.<eos> I understand the gravity of the request, but need a response before the window of opportunity closes.<eos> This is exactly the kind of opportunity he's been waiting for.<eos> He could re-direct our missiles at Mars.<eos> Or Earth.<eos> It's just the guidance systems.<eos> We still have our abort codes.<eos> Besides, why would he?
She's not like me.<eos> Or you.<eos> The deeper I get into my life here, I'm just... I'm realizing all of these things I just couldn't face.<eos> Like what?<eos> How she used to manipulate me.<eos> Even before my dad got sick.<eos> When I was in high school, she bet me money that I could lose weight.<eos> That's awful.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> Why would you?
And trust me, my friend, that is a huge accomplishment.<eos> Yeah, about that...<eos> I just want to say that I appreciate what you did for me.<eos> Yeah, it's what we do for our friends, right?<eos> Besides, it was a way for me to balance the scales.<eos> Balance the scales, right.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> I just mean...<eos> I can't tell you the amount of times that I've been in your shoes and a man with your face has made me feel better.<eos> Yeah, about that, I would...
You're welcome.<eos> I've never seen a war between the conscious and subconscious before.<eos> Should be interesting.<eos> How is a stupid pageant supposed to remind me of feelings attached to something I haven't even forgotten?<eos> Just... dance.<eos> And trust that Elena is right here dancing with you.<eos> For the sake of argument, if Elena Gilbert weren't tied to your mortality...<eos> Would I become a vampire for you?<eos> Well, you said even if you wanted to.<eos> Oh, would you?
- Thanks, Mom.<eos> - What's up, bro? - What's up, brother?<eos> - What's up, Dre?<eos> - Damn.<eos> Tory Ash.<eos> The whole world is still wondering what happened to her ever since she stripped butt naked onstage at Fenway Park.<eos> Show some respect, Hakeem.<eos> The woman has an illness.<eos> Yeah, you would know a lot about that,<eos> - wouldn't you?
But...<eos> like I said, I know what I saw.<eos> And what I saw was insane.<eos> Right.<eos> Now this is awkward, but, um... hellhounds only come after people who sold their souls... to a demon.<eos> So about 10 years ago, did you really want something?<eos> I don't know, a Hello Kitty backpack or the death of an enemy?<eos> No.<eos> What about Marcus? Did he...<eos> Would he...
Jimmy McGill reached out to people who otherwise may never have seen an attorney in their entire lives.<eos> He took the time to make sure they had wills that accurately reflected their wishes, for a price they could afford, because Jimmy McGill cares about people.<eos> He's devoted the past three years of his life to his brother's welfare.<eos> Waking at 5:00 in the morning to buy Charles' favorite newspaper from the single newsstand in the city that carries it.<eos> Dropping everything to care for his brother through multiple hospitalizations.<eos> Even supporting Charles' career by hand-making a Mylar-lined suit jacket to spare his brother discomfort from exposure to electricity.<eos> And yet, during this time, Charles McGill's irrational animus towards his brother... grew to epic proportions.<eos> So when Jimmy discovered that Charles had used his love and his caring against him, when he discovered he had been betrayed by his only living blood relative...<eos> Jimmy snapped.<eos> Wouldn't you?
You let that she-hound run rings around you, just like that sly harpy upstairs.<eos> Oh, you're a man, all right.<eos> Your brain always in your breeches, too swollen to think.<eos> That's hardly fair.<eos> I should've had a girl.<eos> No daughter of mine would've allowed herself to be duped by a whore.<eos> Why were you the one I chose to keep?<eos> Move aside.<eos> I am not yours to command!<eos> ♪ Would he... ♪
Lydia Quigley.<eos> Her interest in your family is unnatural.<eos> We must join forces against her.<eos> You've preached hatred on my doorstep for weeks.<eos> My little boy goes to sleep with the sound of your evil in his ears like a cankerous lullaby.<eos> If you will not help for my sake, would you do it for sweet Amelia?<eos> Quigley intends some foulness against her.<eos> Help me, Mrs. Wells.<eos> I see virtue in you and... if I have claimed otherwise in the past, it was a lie.<eos> On any other day I would.
James Read can chase us all that he wants.<eos> I only know this.<eos> Us.<eos> I only know love.<eos> The Indians said there was women.<eos> A ship full of 'em came to Jamestown.<eos> Did you not get yourself a wife from amongst them, Henry?<eos> Must you talk all day long?<eos> If I was a man in Jamestown, all them years, I'd want a maid.<eos> What man wouldn't?
I mean, He clearly expected me to zig, and so I zagged.<eos> And does Chloe know that you've zagged Candy?<eos> Yes.<eos> She just fired me.<eos> - Shocking. - I know.<eos> But if you felt so manipulated... why return to Chloe at all?<eos> Well, I mean, I tried to leave, but I just felt that I missed... my work.<eos> Look, anyway, baby, bathwater, the detective and I are quite the crime-fighting duo.<eos> I mean, you wouldn't break up<eos> - Batman and Robin, now, would you? - No.
Would you relax?<eos> I've done hundreds of these arraignments.<eos> You don't know what's about to go down, do you?<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> First of all, forgive me for earlier.<eos> And this is just a formality, so just try to keep it friendly.<eos> Okay?<eos> Martin, would you like to come over to dinner tonight?<eos> No.<eos> He would not.
We're about to begin.<eos> Now, it looks like Miss Thatcher might not be able to make it, but we have a wonderful recital planned for you.<eos> The program will begin with our very own Bill Avery.<eos> Oh! And friends!<eos> Where's Miss Thatcher?<eos> She's feeling under the weather, dear.<eos> But we were supposed to do this together.<eos> I know.<eos> But she'd want you to play anyway.<eos> She really would.
Wow. That is sad.<eos> No question we got to go big.<eos> Mm, I'm really glad you decided to kiss me.<eos> Me too.<eos> This is awesome.<eos> You're awesome.<eos> Let's not tell anyone.<eos> What?<eos> I mean I want to tell people.<eos> Duh. Why wouldn't I?
So this is it?<eos> You resign, and Reed keeps his job at Sheriff's.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> He can prove my involvement, I can't prove his.<eos> Barton destroyed the recording.<eos> When this goes public, they're gonna charge you with a felony, and then every arrest that you made, including the 400 with me as your partner, is gonna be thrown out or subject to appeal.<eos> Regrettably, yes.<eos> That means hundreds of criminals that we put away might be back on the streets.<eos> Yeah, but... this is what I've come to realize, even if that weren't the case, even if I could go back and keep what I did a secret,<eos> I wouldn't.
No worries.<eos> Thanks, buddy.<eos> Okay, so you're eating floor chips and you sent a uni to retrieve your pants?<eos> A wool cap.<eos> It is getting chilly outside.<eos> Duke!<eos> This is looking like a pretty clear cry for help.<eos> Well, as usual, you're not wrong.<eos> Would you like to help me out?<eos> Yes. Yes, I would.
- Objection.<eos> - Withdrawn.<eos> Did your mom know that you asked Tamra out three months ago?<eos> No. Because I didn't.<eos> Did she know that Tamra made up some lame excuse to dump you while she went to a rave?<eos> No. Because that never happened.<eos> Did you ever tell your mom how humiliated you felt?<eos> Why would I care if some bimbo preferred to be with garbage instead of me?<eos> So you'd just as soon sit at home alone on your computer?<eos> As a matter of fact, I would.
Did you know her?<eos> No.<eos> But I know what it's like to lose people you love.<eos> I lost my ma when i was little, and my pa, he did the best he could, considering.<eos> And that's really all Henry was doing.<eos> He's helping me, and I'm gonna help him.<eos> See, I'm leaving tomorrow on my journey, and I was thinking i would take penny with me.<eos> I think that she might like that.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she would.
What, are you gonna go play house with that ugly little girlfriend of yours?<eos> - Maybe I will.<eos> - Maybe you will.<eos> But let me tell you something.<eos> You won't, because you won't have a job.<eos> So I want you to be prepared for what it feels like to be on the unemployment line.<eos> Because as of this moment forward, I'm going to do everything in my power to ensure that you never work in this town again.<eos> Hey, put that in your Facebook.<eos> - Should I put my showcase here?<eos> - Yeah, would you?
No. She didn't want a lot of that.<eos> She didn't.<eos> Okay.<eos> How about you?<eos> Is that how you like it?<eos> How would you like it?<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Having to sit up here in front of all these people, answering this type of question?<eos> That's what you meant.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
- is that what Joe would say?<eos> - No. Well, I mean, yeah, we've had the discussion and everything.<eos> - So...<eos> - Yeah, good.<eos> Yeah, just let me know if we're making too much noise.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Just fuckin' with you.<eos> All right.<eos> Um, do you think i should call my mom to tell her about dad?<eos> - No, I wouldn't, Patty.
Why don't you take a drivers' ed course?<eos> I'm not your chauffeur.<eos> 'Cause dad made me promise not to drive 'til I was 17.<eos> Okay, we'll stick with that then.<eos> Do you wanna stay for dinner?<eos> I think Sandy's mother likes you.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> I happen to know that she does.<eos> This could be good for both of us.<eos> I'd really rather not.
Compared to me, yes.<eos> - You okay?<eos> - No, I just got fired.<eos> - What?<eos> - You should be happy.<eos> You don't have to deal with me anymore, right?<eos> - What happened?<eos> - Hey, you wouldn't understand, all right?<eos> - It's, like, a grown-up thing.<eos> - Yeah, I would.
- It's in the blood.<eos> He looked just like an ordinary man, like an officer, but it was him!<eos> Now, what she should have done was keep him talking, but she got so frightened and she tried to run away, and he grabbed her!<eos> You don't need to worry about him here now.<eos> But you can tell your fortune.. ...if you go out to the barn at night.<eos> - How?<eos> What do you do?<eos> You stand and you listen... and if you hear knocking, that's bad, but if you hear grain pouring, it's good.<eos> But I don't suppose any of you would go out there.<eos> I would.
Come here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hi.<eos> Long night.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Just chilling.<eos> Barb, is that my shirt?<eos> I don't know, is it?<eos> Want me to take it off?<eos> Would you, please?
Don't ask.<eos> You'll gag.<eos> I thought maybe you dopes had stumbled onto some sort of mafia shakedown.<eos> We've been here, like, four minutes. Well?<eos> Anything suspicious so far?<eos> Uh, just you?<eos> What, I'm a flamboyant Hollywood producer.<eos> Not the world's tiniest drag queen? What?<eos> I said we'll keep you updated.<eos> Well, you'd better, missy.
Shut up!<eos> Just at me!<eos> - Pretend you're really scared of me.<eos> - "Pretend"?<eos> Go.<eos> Quick, go!<eos> They're mine!<eos> You can't have them! If you try...<eos> Hurry up.<eos> Well, you'd just better not!
Just make up an excuse and get out of jury duty, Jess.<eos> - Please, I need you.<eos> - No, Nick.<eos> It's a right and a privilege.<eos> In South Africa, they don't even have juries.<eos> They have a-a judge and two assessors.<eos> God, I would have bullied you as a kid.<eos> Jury duty is supposed to be a sacrifice.<eos> Would I like to be at work right now, participating in the Spirit Week assembly?<eos> Yeah, I would.
[Pouch] Hey, you hanging in?<eos> [door closes]<eos> We all have things...<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> - You're fired.<eos> - [files thud]<eos> You got nailed by the SEC, so you tried to sell me out?<eos> You wearing a wire right now?<eos> No.<eos> I would never...
Oxygenates their vaginas.<eos> - They love it.<eos> - Sure.<eos> Hey. Hey, how are you?<eos> Ah, it's nice in here.<eos> I've been watching you very closely this week.<eos> I've wanted you to stare at me.<eos> And I am very impressed with what I see, and we were wondering if you would like to join us full-time at TAC-Van Nuys.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Yes, we would.
This is why teen moms drop out of high school even though we are in our prime childbearing years.<eos> Uh, you can't do that.<eos> My pregnancy is no less punishing to my bladder than your paralysis is to yours.<eos> Right?<eos> I'm trying to wipe.<eos> Do you mind?<eos> - Yeah. Reason for visit?<eos> Uh, I'm pregnant and I need a--<eos> We'd like to learn about prenatal care, please.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
It is goodness.<eos> And if there is a shred of goodness inside of me, then I have to believe that there is a shred of goodness inside of you.<eos> Be the man that your father wants you to be, not the man Savage wants you to be.<eos> Savage, he's coming.<eos> Gideon?<eos> Tor Degaton's forces have surrounded the ship.<eos> I'm afraid our shields will not be able to sustain continued bombardment.<eos> You're afraid?<eos> Here's an idea: why don't you fire back?<eos> I would, except...
- You can't fire me.<eos> You don't interrupt a meeting with the Secretary of State.<eos> I can end Dunbar's campaign. We can end it today.<eos> How?<eos> If I deliver, will you keep me on?<eos> You tell me how first.<eos> Have a seat, Martha.<eos> I've had second thoughts about your resignation.<eos> Would you like to remain as attorney general?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Okay.<eos> - How is it okay?<eos> Six hours after I mention it to this prick, four of my guys get pinched?<eos> Either I'm a fucking jerk, or somebody dropped a dime.<eos> Am I a jerk?<eos> Of course not.<eos> Am I?<eos> Answer the man.<eos> No, you're not a jerk, but I didn't do anything.<eos> Mr. Galasso, please. He would never...
Wait. Ha ha! How does this even grab on?<eos> Yes, yes, yes.<eos> That is pure class right there.<eos> Oh. This is... this is very much me.<eos> Now you have to take up ceramics.<eos> You know, I actually made my mom a mug in summer camp.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> I bet she still has it.<eos> Ha ha. Yeah, she would.
Jake.<eos> - Ha ha!<eos> Angry mother?<eos> Something like that.<eos> I, uh, share custody with his dad's parents.<eos> Long story.<eos> Tonight's their night.<eos> You're under lockdown.<eos> You think that would make a difference, huh?<eos> Yeah. I would. Ha ha!
I don't mind.<eos> Actually, I could put Tucker to bed every night, if you'd like.<eos> Well, that's not necessary.<eos> I'll call a nanny service in the morning.<eos> Is that what Tucker needs?<eos> Another stranger in his life when he's already lost his mami and papi?<eos> He'll adjust.<eos> But if his nanny was someone he already knew, that would keep him calm.<eos> And quiet.<eos> My sister wouldn't...
I need a testimony.<eos> I already said all I've got to say.<eos> Or did you forget to write it down?<eos> Not from you.<eos> From Jack Dawkins.<eos> Dodger?<eos> Fagin has sworn under oath that the boy gave him the dead man's wallet.<eos> You understand the implications.<eos> You're lying.<eos> Fagin wouldn't...
I'm not a traitor.<eos> I was forced into this.<eos> They threatened my family.<eos> There's stuff you don't know about.<eos> - So much of it.<eos> - You better tell me.<eos> Or we can get an interrogation room down at the FBI.<eos> What, like, from the very beginning?<eos> I would love to.<eos> I would.
Do it again.<eos> What would you do differently?<eos> I would fight back.<eos> What if you still could?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> The bullet that we removed is evidence.<eos> With it and your testimony, you could put that guy away for a long time.<eos> Everyone will know what I did.<eos> It's true.<eos> They would.
Could you tell?<eos> I could.<eos> No one knows how to keep a secret.<eos> I got 2 emails inviting me to my surprise party.<eos> Not one.<eos> Two!<eos> You still think about her?<eos> Maybe.<eos> You have any news?<eos> How would I?
Carl, Carl.<eos> Hey. [chuckles]<eos> Wait, making me run after you?<eos> - What's that about?<eos> - I'm going home.<eos> Oh, well, you said you got a recording studio, right?<eos> - You think you could record me?<eos> - Wait, excuse me?<eos> Yeah, I want to go to music camp this summer, and they need a sound file of me playing the violin, so...<eos> I would, but...
Look...<eos> I know your decision to give up your child for adoption probably wasn't an easy one.<eos> But given everything you and Tom have been through,<eos> I get it.<eos> And I want you to know I'm here if you need anything.<eos> Liz:<eos> Did you tell Cooper about the adoption?<eos> You told me to cancel the baby shower.<eos> I told everyone.<eos> Samar, why would you...
I can see.<eos> Vidal Sassoon's got nothing on you.<eos> Business is business.<eos> Stop giving me the side-eye.<eos> I know how it got there.<eos> Life is so tough you can't make it into your own bunk?<eos> I don't feel good.<eos> I heard that Alex told you how our garden grows.<eos> If you say a word, I'll end you.<eos> I would... never.
Very high divorce rate.<eos> Still the Lillian thing?<eos> You know about the picture?<eos> There's a picture.<eos> And I'm gonna get devoured in the briefing.<eos> This isn't going away, and you have been gone, and I know you are grieving your cousin...<eos> Uh, it's difficult.<eos> But I have to say it is not easy around here without you.<eos> Red, you know I'd never tell you how to do your job.<eos> Oh, yes, you would.
Trust me, it's not the...<eos> It's too late. (laughs) Wow.<eos> Look.<eos> Yeah, sorry, kiddos, but the two of you are not the only ones in the family now with ink.<eos> Okay, good.<eos> I'm glad you have ink. (laughs)<eos> So, um, anyway, we never did get to finish the list, but one of the items on Leonard's list was he wanted to drive a police car.<eos> That's such a boy thing.<eos> So, uh, how many ponies under that hood?<eos> I'd really...
I just...<eos> I'd like to know what you guys think.<eos> When do you have to make up your mind?<eos> Soon.<eos> This is a little sudden.<eos> I know, but would you back me if I said yes?<eos> If you win, what happens to you here?<eos> Well, I'd have to resign.<eos> Well, whoever replaces you won't know how we handle things.<eos> No, they would not.
Will you dance with me?<eos> No, the bigger man suggests letting it go.<eos> I'm just waiting for your words to finally travel up here... you are so short.<eos> Hey, idiots.<eos> Look.<eos> Oh, he did it... all by himself.<eos> Mm.<eos> Hey, uh, my phone died.<eos> Would you mind e-mailing me that video when you're done?<eos> Yes, I would.
Where's Jimmy Chun?<eos> He walked right out your front door.<eos> It wasn't my idea, all right.<eos> I swear.<eos> I assume not.<eos> But why let some sketchy stranger talk you into it?<eos> He's not a stranger.<eos> You know Jimmy Chun?<eos> Recognized him.<eos> Anyone from Flushing would.
Without me, you're just... some Philly thug with mental problems.<eos> Please, Rhonda...<eos> Rhonda, please...<eos> I'm okay.<eos> That's it.<eos> They're coming for us from all sides, Bella.<eos> But we're gonna show all these haters just what time it is.<eos> And I want you to know something.<eos> Everything I did was to protect my legacy, and I will do it again.<eos> Yes, I would.
That's it.<eos> They're coming for us from all sides, Bella.<eos> But we're gonna show all these haters just what time it is.<eos> And I want you to know something.<eos> Everything I did was to protect my legacy, and I will do it again.<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> I got it.<eos> I see you in there.<eos> Acting like you asleep when you awake.<eos> Yes, I would.
The only reason you warned Agent Hotchner about this storm is because your son had something to do with it.<eos> And now you need our help.<eos> Not as much as you need mine.<eos> Your son framed a federal agent and manipulated special weapons and tactics operatives to do it.<eos> So, here's the thing about SWAT.<eos> They don't like being manipulated.<eos> So now your son is on a shoot first, ask questions later list.<eos> I want him taken into custody, alive.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> What mother wouldn't?
All day, every day.<eos> I wasn't expecting Jim Gordon to stop by.<eos> You aren't supposed to be here, are you?<eos> How come you're not in jail?<eos> I agreed to testify against Professor Strange.<eos> In case you're about to ask, I don't know who really ran Indian Hill.<eos> I don't care who ran Indian Hill.<eos> Then why are you here?<eos> And why would I know how to find Fish Mooney?<eos> No reason you would.
I thought Eric had been cleared of the charges. Oh, he has.<eos> Because we now know that you're the one who killed your father-in-law, Christi.<eos> What?<eos> Eric's father created fake evidence that you were cheating and tried to blackmail you into leaving.<eos> And then he had a little champagne toast to evil while he did it. No wonder you wanted to jam it down his throat.<eos> I...<eos> No.<eos> No, I did it.<eos> My father, he-he showed me the evidence and I knew it was fake.<eos> Christi would never...
But I believe, based on atmospheric expansion due to global warming, that there's gonna be an impact.<eos> An asteroid is gonna crash into Earth?<eos> Yes.<eos> Then why hasn't NASA said anything about it?<eos> Well, maybe they don't know about it.<eos> Or maybe they do.<eos> I don't know.<eos> They won't respond to me e-mails.<eos> No, I think they would tell us if an asteroid was gonna hit us.<eos> - Would they? Would they?
You don't want to catch Peter Lewis?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> Brian was just a test case.<eos> He'll do this again.<eos> We have the same list.<eos> We're contacting everybody on it.<eos> But you're right.<eos> He will try to do this again.<eos> If you want to help catch him...<eos> Yeah, I would.
Wilson came out of his coma in the middle of the night, and I spoke to him.<eos> He told me a woman stopped him in the middle of the road,<eos> "just standing there."<eos> Damn it.<eos> You just keep getting it right.<eos> The second you left, I took off in my invisible helicopter.<eos> This is not funny!<eos> If you actually listen to yourself, it's hilarious!<eos> Your own piece-of-shit portable containment unit weighed a couple tons, and needed a Mack truck to pull it around.<eos> How the hell would I...?
Great work, everybody.<eos> Hi.<eos> Did you have anything to do with the blackout?<eos> Then... did you... have anything to do with the FBI?<eos> An agent called.<eos> Said he stopped by earlier.<eos> You know, I don't get a lot of FBI agents calling.<eos> Was his name MacLaren?<eos> Would it help you if I told you I work with him?<eos> Yeah, it would.
Is this your house?<eos> [watch beeps]<eos> I've been here for hours.<eos> I wanted to confirm that this wasn't a waste of my time.<eos> - Well, what about my time? - Oh, honey.<eos> My time is much more valuable than yours.<eos> Speaking of, I've only allotted 28 minutes for this conversation, which is very generous of me.<eos> So we should begin.<eos> I'd like to leave.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
How about we, find one of your boys who can give you a lift home?<eos> It's been a long day, honey.<eos> - But we... we will talk?<eos> - Yes, of course we will.<eos> Yes, we will.<eos> Helen, I should be going now.<eos> I just wanted to say thank you so much for everything.<eos> Don't go yet, Julia.<eos> I'd like you to stay.<eos> I would.
- How much?<eos> - Enough.<eos> How do I know I'm not leaving something on the table?<eos> Because I never leave anything on the table.<eos> All right.<eos> You know, I don't get it.<eos> You're obviously a big-time attorney, and now you're subletting to me.<eos> What the hell happened here?<eos> - You don't know?<eos> - Why would I?
RJ, you got to call your dad, buddy.<eos> I... Look, he just left the station.<eos> Did you not hear what I said?<eos> I snuck out.<eos> Riggs, please, I'm begging you.<eos> All right, where are you?<eos> Ms. Abernathy.<eos> Hate to bother you with more questions, but when you went out tonight, did you take your car or did you leave that at home?<eos> I drove.<eos> I would, too.
We're working with black-and-white pictures.<eos> Sounds good.<eos> First challenge:<eos> The shafts and feeding mechanism for the scrolls.<eos> Screw these up, and we'll be in paper jam hell.<eos> All right.<eos> Now to put all the stuff in it.<eos> Hook up a tiny gearbox.<eos> It's gonna slow down the revolutions of the paper feed so that I can actually see the map coming by.<eos> Otherwise it would just:
Like models?<eos> Not even close.<eos> Mascots.<eos> All my high school research suggests that they're awkward loners, not musical enough for the band, too uncoordinated for track.<eos> I know it sounds weird, but school spirit, it's, like, really big here.<eos> And Cash loves school spirit.<eos> Yeah, why do you think Emotacon performs at, like, every pep rally?<eos> - School spirit.<eos> - Yeah, I mean, who wants to be some rando screaming at him from the audience?<eos> - I wouldn't.
- What are you, a psychic?<eos> - No, that's not the point.<eos> Then what is your basis for knowing?<eos> - It's a hypothetical. - It's a stupid hypothetical.<eos> Just use your imagination.<eos> All right?<eos> - All right. - Okay.<eos> Let's accept that there is a world where I know, with absolute certainty, the exact time of your death.<eos> Now, you want me to tell you or not?<eos> Yeah, of course I would. Who wouldn't?
Yeah, they told me.<eos> She always thought the one in print has been cropped a bit too much on the right.<eos> Right here.<eos> Oh, yes, yes. I see what she meant.<eos> So, when I write this article, I don't think I can avoid mentioning how she died.<eos> That is wasn't really an accident.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, are you saying that you want to write that she, killed herself?<eos> Gene, I don't want to be a part of romanticizing what we do.<eos> Isabelle wouldn't either.
One last thing.<eos> If you suspected that Jeanine had corrupted Dauntless, why didn't you just leave?<eos> Why did you stay?<eos> I wanted to leave.<eos> But I fell in love with Tris Prior.<eos> And I couldn't leave her.<eos> Thank you for your Candor.<eos> Thank you for your Candor.<eos> Tobias Eaton, this trial has concluded and you are absolved of guilt on the attack on Abnegation.<eos> Miss Prior if you would.
I'm an art dealer, not a charlatan.<eos> A rogue, perhaps, a scamp or scoundrel, I will grant you.<eos> But never an outright mountebank.<eos> Enough!<eos> You owe me.<eos> I believe a finger would be fair.<eos> Don't you?<eos> No!<eos> Jock!<eos> I wouldn't, mate. I really wouldn't.
I'm reading for the role of Vlad.<eos> We thought you were reading for Chuck.<eos> Nope, reading for the role of Vlad.<eos> That's great.<eos> You can scream all you want!<eos> That effect is killer.<eos> Let's keep it.<eos> Great.<eos> We'll lock that, and... moving on.<eos> Brett, if you would...
Yes, yes.<eos> When I am hanged, Elizabeth will no longer be married.<eos> Soldiers will try to claim her.<eos> Yes?<eos> I want her to marry James, as soon as I am buried.<eos> Would that be possible?<eos> ~ Does she want to marry him?<eos> ~ Yes.<eos> And do you want to marry her?<eos> What man would not?
Fuck.<eos> You've got it all figured out, don't you?<eos> Don't you?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't think.<eos> You have such an easy life, J-Dawg.<eos> - Let's go back to the party, okay?<eos> - Yeah, let's get back in.<eos> J-Dawg wants back in.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
It says here you were apprenticed at the Pittsburgh Ballet at age 18, then took a leave of absence in that first year, and nothing since...<eos> Nowhere.<eos> No, no, no. I do the talking.<eos> I have to say I'm disinclined...<eos> Suspicious.<eos> No one walks away from that kind of opportunity.<eos> Attitude or injury...<eos> Wonder what they'd tell me were I to call.<eos> - You should.<eos> They would...
It's a mess. They had a huge fight in Vegas.<eos> Think they'll break up?<eos> I don't know. Sounds pretty bad.<eos> Penny's back in her apartment all by herself.<eos> Really?<eos> Would you like to hear another reason why men are better than women?<eos> Sure, let's make it an even hundred.<eos> You would never kiss me and make me say "I love you"<eos> and then break up with me.<eos> I wouldn't.
I had a drink.<eos> Then I couldn't stop.<eos> I used to hear my father telling the whole world he didn't have a problem with drink.<eos> ~ Have you spoken to Mr Hereward about this?<eos> ~ No.<eos> Please.<eos> He mustn't find out.<eos> Are you sure that's how you want your marriage to begin - with a deception, a secret?<eos> He won't want to marry me if he found out.<eos> What man would?
He doesn't want to be here.<eos> I know that, Julie!<eos> Jesus Christ!<eos> You think I don't know that?<eos> - What do you know about Polly?<eos> - Who?<eos> His neighbour.<eos> He keeps a picture of her under the visor in his cab!<eos> - No. He said there was...<eos> - How would you?
What are you smiling about?<eos> Nothing. It's just weird that this is coming up, 'cause, uh, the thing, the phone call that I wanted to tell you about earlier, takes care of this problem.<eos> - What is it?<eos> - I don't really want to say in front of everyone...<eos> think I might jinx it, so...<eos> I can't!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Then don't. Look, maybe what we do is...<eos> God!<eos> It really would, though.
- Eduardo, please--<eos> - This is a farce.<eos> Please.<eos> Let me deal with this.<eos> Please. Fine.<eos> Whatever you want.<eos> We can at least begin a discussion, right?<eos> Even though you never stated it, surely you'd like to see the bombings stop.<eos> - Yes.<eos> Yes, I would.
I'll call you back.<eos> Yes, boss?<eos> What's happening outside?<eos> We don't know.<eos> I fucked up.<eos> What's that, boss?<eos> Gather the boys.<eos> And tell the prison guards they're to fire on anyone who tries to come in.<eos> Boss, do you think the prison guards will follow your orders?<eos> They'd better.
Bobby and I will be in the car.<eos> I know you and Ellie are the best of friends, but you've always taken time to make me feel special.<eos> Thank you for that.<eos> This house could be ours.<eos> We could finally do it.<eos> We could start our new lives together and live here as a couple.<eos> We could get matching robes that say "Hers" and "Hers."<eos> I could finally wear all those vests that I love.<eos> You'd probably miss your stupid husband, though, right?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Dirty Arab.<eos> - Little bitch.<eos> - Dirty nigger.<eos> - Bunch of faggots.<eos> - Go, Molly, gol stick with us, Marlowe.<eos> You can do it, Jihad.<eos> Your meeting at school is the 22nd.<eos> - Will you be there?<eos> - Of course. He won't take me.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
I took a look at the report.<eos> The names she called you.<eos> Talentless.<eos> Leech.<eos> Pansy.<eos> Then you get sick.<eos> I can't imagine that turned her into Florence Nightingale all of a sudden.<eos> Leo, I'm married.<eos> I get it.<eos> Any man would.
My name is...<eos> Jornatha.<eos> Jornatha?<eos> That's a-- That's such a beautiful name.<eos> What is that?<eos> Is that Danish?<eos> Is that like Swedish?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> Yes, Jornatha.<eos> I would.
Why did you bring up Claire?<eos> She's... talking privately to Corrigan.<eos> - It's no matter.<eos> - Is there something wrong?<eos> I hope not.<eos> Now, missile defense.<eos> A statement for the Russian media.<eos> - That's all it is.<eos> - Let me ask you something. Would you read that statement if you were me?<eos> Yes, I would.
That was Father Pat on the phone.<eos> I was supposed to have my wedding vows to him two days ago, and I've written thousands of versions, but all of them suck.<eos> Now, you are a great writer.<eos> You come up with all of these brilliant lectures.<eos> - Oh, no.<eos> No, no, no. - I'm desperate.<eos> I'm not writing your wedding vows for you.<eos> - I don't see why not.<eos> - Because it's wrong on so many levels.<eos> I wouldn't even...
The Germans besieged us.<eos> We ran out of food and water and... .. only eight of us came out alive.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> If there's anything I can do.<eos> I can't be in the store any more, not after what happened.<eos> We need you.<eos> I need you.<eos> But if I can't trust myself, how can you trust me?<eos> ~ Anyway, Mrs Leclair wouldn't want to work beside me.<eos> ~ Of course she would.
Milady tricked you.<eos> She tricked everyone.<eos> The Queen should know who she's dealing with.<eos> All our evidence died with the Cardinal.<eos> If you went to the Queen what would you tell her?<eos> The truth.<eos> You know the King is besotted with Milady.<eos> You might do more harm than good.<eos> But what if she wants to harm Her Majesty?<eos> Why would she?
You know, normal stuff millennials do.<eos> Not all millennials do that.<eos> Yes, they do. I read it on a blog.<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Are you happy to hang out, or do you want to go on a date?<eos> (Laughs):<eos> No! I don't want to go on a date.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't... yes.
- Nothing.<eos> Forget it. Just no cops.<eos> Please.<eos> You're the boss.<eos> But you can't sleep here tonight.<eos> You're gonna have to come to my place.<eos> No, thank you.<eos> Doctor says I have to sleep sitting up anyway.<eos> Bed wouldn't do me any good.<eos> Would you...?
I swear to God.<eos> Okay. See? I knew you wouldn't believe me.<eos> Who killed George, then, trey?<eos> Nobody.<eos> Nobody?<eos> I mean he did.<eos> - George killed himself? - Yes!<eos> See? I told you you wouldn't believe me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, trey.<eos> I really would.
The Indian.<eos> He wanted a haircut and I stabbed him with the scissors.<eos> In the back.<eos> Boy, she makes us look like the gang that can't shoot straight, doesn't she?<eos> Our beautician.<eos> It's worth mentionin', you know, in the spirit of full disclosure,<eos> my plan, it worked.<eos> I made a deal for Dodd.<eos> With, what, the Gerhardts?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
And in rare instances, told in legend, those waters have been used to restore the dead to life.<eos> He offered to use the Lazarus pit on Thea, didn't he?<eos> Lazarus, as in from the bible, Lazarus?<eos> The pit's real.<eos> I've seen it.<eos> It can save Thea.<eos> Right. But only if you become the new Ra's.<eos> Ok.<eos> Well, even if a magic hot tub were not crazy talk, we're not going to let you go and join the League of psychotic murderers, even if it is to save Thea.<eos> Which this wouldn't.
Maybe.<eos> What's the scam?<eos> What kind of a man do you think I am?<eos> There's always a scam, Frank.<eos> All right, yes.<eos> I'm very good at sticking it to the man, but this woman...<eos> I don't want to stick anything to her.<eos> Except myself, but she won't let me.<eos> Why would anybody want to be with you?<eos> Well, why wouldn't they?
The People v. Charles Nevine S.<eos> This is the time for the sentencing hearing.<eos> This court has reviewed your probation report.<eos> Does either counsel wish to be heard?<eos> Your Honor, defense would like to reiterate that this is defendant's first arrest he has never been in trouble before and that he has an IQ of barely functional intelligence.<eos> Would the defendant like to say anything?<eos> Charles?<eos> Would you like to say anything before sentencing?<eos> Okay.<eos> I would, Your Honor.
Uh, but you never reported this in your first interview.<eos> I wanted to protect Nate.<eos> Protect him?<eos> When Nate and I arrived at the house,<eos> Sam was in the driveway getting into his car, about to leave town.<eos> Sam?<eos> Sam was drunk, yelling at me.<eos> Nate got out of his car to try to calm him down.<eos> Sam!<eos> Sam wouldn't.
Well, you can't risk it.<eos> He'll react badly.<eos> And it could blow up in our face in a big way.<eos> You can't bring him in on this, Bobbi.<eos> W-what am I supposed to do?<eos> I can't bring him ...<eos> I don't want him here in case he takes their side.<eos> He's a friend.<eos> I don't want him fighting against us.<eos> - He would never. - Oh.
Do they want to...?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> They will brand you ... all of you.<eos> You have power here ... lots of it.<eos> To do what?<eos> Openly attack them?<eos> - Blast their planes out of the sky?<eos> - Well, for a start.<eos> Our daughter wouldn't want that.<eos> And my people would never
We have three employees.<eos> At least two of them aren't blind.<eos> Naysayers, each and every one of you.<eos> Karen, come on.<eos> Batting practice, you and me, Chelsea Piers.<eos> - What do you say?<eos> - Um, I...<eos> Or not.<eos> Totally cool.<eos> No, no, I would, I would.
At the doors to Olympus.<eos> With the witch?<eos> They will return with the wrath of the gods, to exact bitter retribution.<eos> Where did they go, King?<eos> Where did they go?<eos> Perhaps your brother will tell me.<eos> Well?<eos> I don't know where they went.<eos> Would you like me to talk to them, Father?<eos> I would.

No.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> Would you have an abortion if something were seriously wrong?<eos> Xiomara!<eos> What?<eos> That's part of the question, at least, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> And no.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Why are you asking me about this?<eos> Well, because Singh's on his honeymoon, and you're the only other person I can trust to know this.<eos> Okay, what are you asking me to do?<eos> I need to clear a route through the city.<eos> Barricades, police cars, the works.<eos> What am I supposed to tell people?<eos> The President's in town? I don't know.<eos> You think they'll believe you?<eos> No, Joe, no.<eos> They wouldn't.
Special kind of hurricane.<eos> I got the recipe when I was tending bar in New Orleans.<eos> Locals used to dump it on graves, keep the evil away.<eos> How come you didn't bring hot Doug...<eos> I mean Doug?<eos> We broke up.<eos> Turns out it's really hard to maintain the intensity that you get with Internet communication.<eos> You wouldn't know what I'm talking about there.<eos> - It's a whole new thing.<eos> - Actually, I would.
We could watch the TV like we did the other night.<eos> Yeah, well, mighty nice of you to offer, hon, but I still got some paperwork.<eos> - Mm. - And... there's a little extra.<eos> Pretty girl.<eos> Friend of yours?<eos> She could be your friend, too.<eos> - If you want her number, just ask.<eos> - Yeah, no, not tonight.<eos> Well, didn't know you were coming by, but now that you're here,<eos> - w-w-what would you I... - Shh.
Bed rest blows.<eos> But I do have a cool new scar.<eos> You know what, it sounds like maybe it's finally time to get Netflix.<eos> Yeah. Well, I do have a well-loved, well-worn Blu-ray of The Expendables.<eos> Come watch with me.<eos> I saved your life yesterday and that's how you're gonna repay me?<eos> I think my mom just pulled in.<eos> You should come over.<eos> She'd love to see you.<eos> We both would.
You left out the part where Tommy's in jail and you're not.<eos> This is just like Kanan all over again, huh?<eos> I'm not doing this shit here.<eos> Except you didn't want to tell me because you knew that I wouldn't help you sell Tommy out.<eos> This why I saved the fed bitch's life?<eos> So she could arrest Tommy?<eos> It's not like that at all, T, okay?<eos> I would never do Tommy that way.<eos> Yeah, and you know what?<eos> The old Ghost wouldn't.
And... how was your date last night with Josh?<eos> Have you guys done it yet?<eos> Work's good, Josh is good.<eos> All's good, yup.<eos> And I really need a coffee.<eos> I'm finally at the age where I totally get those mugs that are like, "don't talk to me until I've had my morning coffee."<eos> And it's like, so sad and...<eos> Leo and I used to always walk down this street and laugh at the ridiculous things in the windows.<eos> Though, I did always say, I wouldn't mind a pair of Louboutins.<eos> Yeah, who wouldn't?
JOSH:<eos> Hi, Tom.<eos> You are one tough cookie.<eos> But... I have a secret weapon:<eos> My Dell.<eos> You still have that thing?<eos> Now, tell me how to sign onto Facebook and show me Maude.<eos> (laughing)<eos> Oh, I'd like to, Mom.<eos> I really would.
Natalie's Freezing.<eos> Ugh. Natalie's Freezing.<eos> What is this?<eos> I don't know, I.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Honda.<eos> The power of dreams.<eos> Dean Pelton, I know how susceptible you are to advertising.<eos> Would you say, I'm a level seven susceptible.<eos> No, because why would I?
Oh, damn.<eos> It could be that he was at the epicenter of the explosion and was vaporized, but there's a strong possibility that Keller, a.k.a. Lazarus, is still alive.<eos> I let Austin P.D. know, and we're putting out a BOLO to all the local hospitals.<eos> Wylie's putting together a k.a. list, and I'm gonna have agents set up shop at all of them.<eos> Well, did you put out a wire just in case --<eos> He runs for the border, yeah.<eos> All right, well, it seems like you have everything handled.<eos> I don't know if I should tell Jane and Lisbon.<eos> Good question. Yeah.<eos> I wouldn't.
It wasn't her.<eos> - It wasn't?<eos> - Nope.<eos> Did the girl look like her?<eos> Sort of.<eos> Kind of hard to tell...<eos> Are you sure it wasn't her?<eos> For the love of God, yeah, I'm sure it wasn't her.<eos> Well, did the sheriff say anything about where Annika is?<eos> Why would he, Norman?
- That's correct.<eos> This is Mary's place.<eos> I live on the top floor.<eos> Uh, Alfie lives between us.<eos> - So, he has his own apartment?<eos> - During the divorce, we thought it was the best move for him.<eos> Alfie wouldn't do well going back and forth between two separate homes like a ping-pong ball.<eos> Yeah, I didn't like that part, either...<eos> - All the packing and unpacking.<eos> - What kid would?
- Nate Burns.<eos> I see you got a body in a fridge.<eos> I see you're reading our files.<eos> May I ask who called you here?<eos> Technically, it was me.<eos> Well, when Dr. Isles ran your victim's prints, it alerted us.<eos> The victim's on an international criminal database, so we've been after him for a while.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Name's Yuri Yevtushok, though he has a lot of aliases.<eos> I would, too.
What?<eos> Emone and Henriette.<eos> Yes.<eos> You resented their very existence.<eos> All the time that was taken away from you, the loss of my constant attention.<eos> Do you know that you used to pinch them when you thought no one was looking?<eos> - You would hurt them.<eos> - I...<eos> I remember wanting your attention.<eos> - But I would never...
Good. Get your ass up here for sentencing.<eos> Your Honor, we have found the Brady violation, - and we ask...<eos> - Oh, yes, you have your Brady violation - because you delayed me.<eos> - Uh, Your Honor, with respect, I did nothing of the kind.<eos> And we insist that you see this Brady violation.<eos> What did you get?<eos> Kalinda got it. I just pulled it down from her computer.<eos> Your Honor. I ask leave to approach?<eos> With great caution, Counselor.<eos> As you would a lion in a cage.
Big mistake.<eos> Is that like blocking someone?<eos> No, blocking is different.<eos> Unfriending is a statement.<eos> - Unfriending is worse.<eos> - I don't get it.<eos> If you want to confront someone, why don't you just do it in person?<eos> W-What?<eos> Come on, "unfriend" isn't even a word.<eos> - Why would you...
You guys, do we really want to rattle "A's" cage by telling now?<eos> We all know what happens when we do that.<eos> DiLaurentis?<eos> Mrs. Hastings?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I want to know why my daughter and her friends are visiting you all of a sudden.<eos> Shouldn't you ask your daughter that?<eos> She won't give me an answer. So I thought I'd get it straight from the horse's mouth.<eos> I've heard that your own brother refuses to come here.<eos> So why would these girls?
Nice to meet you.<eos> I'm Michelle. This non-golfer here, that's Steve McGarrett.<eos> Hi. How are you?<eos> I'm Steve.<eos> How you doing?<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - What's the matter with you?<eos> - If you don't mind, I just want to give you a tip.<eos> I just saw something from back there.<eos> Oh, I would... yes, please.
Just grabbing dinner with an old friend.<eos> Well, that old friend happens to be a material witness in a murder investigation.<eos> Exactly.<eos> We're at a dead end.<eos> We need a new lead.<eos> - No, absolutely not.<eos> - Why?<eos> - What, are you jealous?<eos> - No, I'm protecting you.<eos> Like I would any of my detectives.
Oh! You're having a gallery show in SoHo?<eos> Good-bye.<eos> Uh, it was nice of you two to, uh, come over, check on me.<eos> Uh... weird, but nice.<eos> Perhaps we could come to the opening.<eos> Oh. Oh, you don't need to do that.<eos> I know we don't need to, but maybe I want to support you and your amazing work.<eos> - And Max would enjoy. the free wine.<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> Oh, I would.
And to hear the jogger tell it, this chick was cool as can be.<eos> She may be a pro.<eos> Does raise the question... what was Henry doing here so late at night?<eos> Waiting for someone. CSU found cigarette butts that match the pack in his pocket.<eos> And if he was up to no good, it wouldn't be his first time.<eos> He did a nickel at elmira for aggravated assault... got out a few years ago.<eos> He's still got his work uniform on, so let's see if anyone at go quick towing - knows how he wound up here. - Let's go.<eos> He wasn't on the job, I can tell you that.<eos> We didn't have any pickups out that way, so I don't know what he was doing there.<eos> Well, who would?
You know, for balloons and streamers?<eos> Word to the wise.<eos> Pink, nothing but pink!<eos> Pink, Laura?<eos> Come on.<eos> Once a year, she just lets that girly freak flag fly. Yeah!<eos> And you're gonna do it at her house, right?<eos> Actually, I was thinking about a bar.<eos> I doubt she wants to be ambushed at her house.<eos> No-no-no-no, she absolutely would.
Homer...<eos> I think we should take down Everscream Terrors.<eos> Wha-<eos> - W-We... we can't!<eos> I'm the Mozart of Halloween decorations, and tonight is the Super Bowl.<eos> Lisa's in a bad place.<eos> You know how sensitive she is.<eos> We don't want her to go back to...<eos> Tailee.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Just what?<eos> Don't appreciate what I did for you?<eos> Why do you always interrupt me like that?<eos> That's not how friends...<eos> Uh, I think I know how friends are.<eos> How would you like it if I interrupted you all the time?<eos> I could've been friends with anybody--<eos> Janey, Sherri, Terri, You wouldn't like it all, would you?<eos> Hubert Wong, Wendy Wang.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Really?<eos> Snickers?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Nobody likes a drum solo.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I'm just really nervous.<eos> I did something horrible.<eos> So did most of the people in this room.<eos> Do you think she's gonna ask about the money?<eos> I would.
I'm not letting this kid out of my sight again.<eos> Oh, son of a...<eos> Wait, wait, hang on.<eos> Before you run off.<eos> Uh... I could be totally off base here, but you and I maybe had...<eos> Would you like to maybe hang out sometime?<eos> Wait, really?<eos> Yeah, yeah, I mean, you'd really want to?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Yeah.<eos> Sorry.<eos> That movie was a real letdown.<eos> Look, sir, I can see you working very hard to present yourself as some sort of monster, but it doesn't strike me as real.<eos> You don't know a thing about me.<eos> Or my brother.<eos> No, but...<eos> I imagine you would like to see him again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
Exactly.<eos> We have scoured every network device on the planet without success.<eos> Until I realized you are the last piece of the puzzle.<eos> The answer is in your head.<eos> [CHUCKLES] I don't have the slightest idea where the machine's located.<eos> Not in your brain, in your head.<eos> Your direct line to the machine.<eos> The cochlear implant.<eos> Your little girlfriend told us all about it.<eos> She would never...
She's worried sick about her brother.<eos> I'm gonna hit the Epsom salts.<eos> Swinging off a crane does a number on your back.<eos> I...<eos> I think might hang back for a bit in case Walter needs anything.<eos> He's doped-up like a Tijuana drug mule.<eos> Just in case. Happy, would you mind keeping an eye on Ralph for a few hours?<eos> Not if he doesn't mind getting his butt kicked in Constructo-Battle.<eos> You want to babysit with me?<eos> Of course I would.
You look absolutely radiant tonight.<eos> Thank you.<eos> We're going to Monaco for the weekend.<eos> I want you to come with me.<eos> I'm not inviting Nick.<eos> He's a nice guy and I like him, but he came with the wrong girl.<eos> I know you think you don't belong in my world... but I don't like my world without you in it.<eos> I'll wait for you.<eos> Would every night truly be like this?<eos> It would.
Gonna have a little visit.<eos> Gonna stay with me for a couple days.<eos> Ooh, and that's good?<eos> I know what you're thinking.<eos> But yes, it's very good.<eos> Senior's back from his little European wingding.<eos> He sounds rejuvenated.<eos> And... he wants to meet Zoe.<eos> She want to meet him?<eos> Why wouldn't she?
Be in touch with you later.<eos> Get this to Sebastian, see what he can find.<eos> I'll talk to Cade.<eos> Why'd you lie to the cops?<eos> Windi was dead in my car.<eos> I'm gonna tell them I got in an argument with her?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Windi was upset about the guy that was bothering her.<eos> I wanted her to tell me his name.<eos> She wouldn't.
Hurry up.<eos> Okay, so the first thing you're gonna learn to build is a CMS interface.<eos> I promise it's not as complicated as I just made it sound.<eos> These days everyone wants a responsive design that adjusts itself to different screens.<eos> So the photo of...<eos> Kimye will look the same on your phone, your smart pad, and your computer.<eos> What's Kimye?<eos> Kanye and Kim?<eos> Yeah, right.<eos> You wouldn't, uh...
Don't move.<eos> Put down your gun.<eos> Go away, Justine.<eos> Go away!<eos> I didn't recognise you.<eos> Stop.<eos> Let me finish it, Raphael.<eos> It's been too long.<eos> For Olivia and Daniel.<eos> You wouldn't?
You're getting pretty good at that.<eos> What's wrong, sweetheart?<eos> Why are there bad people, Daddy?<eos> Is this about the crash you saw on the TV?<eos> The Flight 197?<eos> I don't think that people are born bad.<eos> I think it's their choices that make them who they are.<eos> I think sometimes people convince themselves that doing something bad is okay.<eos> - What if I do that?<eos> - You would never.
So I got to run something past you.<eos> Detective Halstead, uh, his brother Will, you know him?<eos> A little.<eos> So my ex-partner questioned him ten years ago.<eos> He knew one of the victims in the New York.<eos> I'd like to bring him in, you know, ask him a few questions, just check his temperature.<eos> Without Jay knowing why you're bringing Will in?<eos> That's correct.<eos> You want to ambush Will.<eos> [sighs] Well, I wouldn't...
Warehouses, not houses.<eos> And that was only cos my brothers made me.<eos> I'm too easily led, that's my problem.<eos> Bless us, O, Lord, your humble servants, who give thanks for the bounty you have provided here today.<eos> May he be present at the table so that we may join in fellowship with thee, now and for evermore.<eos> Ake, ake, ake, amine.<eos> Amen. And we also give thanks for the safe return of Aumea.<eos> May the journey she is about to embark upon be as blessed as the union from which she came.<eos> Why would anyone want to kill her?<eos> They wouldn't.
But when we switched places, neither of us were.<eos> So, you think...<eos> Perhaps she nicked something.<eos> The tail of the pancreas.<eos> And that could have opened the splenic artery.<eos> We're gonna have to open her up.<eos> Listen, you could find a doctor to perform 20 operations on that leg, and it wouldn't change a thing.<eos> Well, there's only one way to find out.<eos> I know you want to fight for this.<eos> And I would, too.
It's vegetarian.<eos> How many sliders do you think I could eat in two minutes?<eos> Is that Pesto?<eos> Do you think that Catherine's gonna help pick the new chief?<eos> I mean, why wouldn't hunt just do it?<eos> I don't, um...<eos> God, it would save us so much trouble.<eos> The 12-page resumes and the phone calls and the polite vetting and...<eos> Who would want to be chief?<eos> Would you?
Simon, they have literally closed the door on you.<eos> They hate you.<eos> I'm assuming that you didn't tell them in case Chris withdrew the funding.<eos> Yeah, and if I had, we'd be bankrupt.<eos> You want the truth?<eos> Everything we have...<eos> Is invested in Academy Green.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> Neil said.<eos> He wouldn't.
I think it would be a good idea if we talked about the fact I got into the Culinary Institute of America.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, my God, that's huge.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> How did that happen?<eos> I mean, er, congratulations.<eos> So, you think I should go?<eos> No!<eos> I mean...<eos> Yes, ah, why wouldn't you?
It's a hike, Mom.<eos> I mean showing up at our wedding when you're, well, transitioning.<eos> I admire your courage and appreciate your support.<eos> Well, Mom, I just want to support you the same way you've supported me all these years:<eos> By challenging every decision I've ever made.<eos> Should we head back down?<eos> Will you just admit that I'm right?<eos> That marriage can work?<eos> I never said marriage couldn't work.<eos> Just that yours wouldn't.
- And Callie has no idea.<eos> - Happy Birthday! - _<eos> What?<eos> What is this?<eos> Wow, Mariana... what is this?<eos> 600 bucks.<eos> I saved it from my quinceanera and my allowance.<eos> But, I want you to have it...<eos> So you can get a car that moms will approve.<eos> Uh, why would you...
Come on!<eos> Lie down.<eos> We'll return in a moment.<eos> Come in.<eos> Thank Fitz, but there's no reason to dote over me.<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Why do you want to rebuild the portal, Jemma?<eos> I saw the schematics, the data, the astronomical research you've been doing, and I just can't understand it.<eos> After everything you've been through...<eos> - Why would you ...
What if I increase your contract by 50%, Solomon?<eos> It's your war.<eos> You fight it.<eos> Let me give you some free advice.<eos> You've just imprisoned an innocent man.<eos> No one is trying to kill you, Mr. President, except the Caliphate.<eos> It's been a terrible day.<eos> I just wonder who you're crying for.<eos> What?<eos> Why would you...?
It's very small in photo.<eos> That's exactly what I thought when I first was it, so I had this done, this fine grain enlargement.<eos> If I cannot authenticate, I have no right to be in business.<eos> Still, it shows very little detail.<eos> But it's clearly the necklace.<eos> But is this truly proof?<eos> Excuse Paul.<eos> He's a lawyer.<eos> I am not unaware that, for some Americans, there's a sense of victory in deceiving the Japanese.<eos> Mr. Kasoura, I would never...
I was completely overwhelmed.<eos> I had not realized the true power of Mr. Bills...<eos> You can feel the power of it?<eos> Yes, he is traveling at high speed.<eos> What?<eos> Is it possible?<eos> Mr. Bills go toward...<eos> The North Kaibe the planet.<eos> I felt the same.<eos> But why would Mr. Bills behind Goku?
I-I'm sorry. That's all I can say.<eos> Good job.<eos> How's his brother doing?<eos> Kevin? He's stable.<eos> Needs a C.T. scan.<eos> Of course, they're down for hours.<eos> I was just noting his chart.<eos> You want to take it over?<eos> I'm slammed anyway.<eos> Thanks. I would.
Mm.<eos> ♪ ♪<eos> Harvey, no matter how this goes, we don't show weakness, we don't show division, and we don't take it out on Louis.<eos> Well, that's gonna be tough, because we wouldn't even be here if it wasn't for that conniving son of a bitch.<eos> Harvey, Louis came to me last night, said he was gonna flip his vote.<eos> So forgive him or not, don't antagonize him.<eos> There's still a chance you could get out of this.<eos> Good morning, everyone.<eos> Harvey, before we vote, would you like to say something?<eos> I would.
There.<eos> Franco...<eos> He's out cold.<eos> We're going to need an EMT here.<eos> Franco.<eos> You still think I'm your bad guy?<eos> You were on the runway, about to take off in the Skystormer.<eos> That doesn't exactly bode well for you.<eos> I told you.<eos> I would never...
Well, you were brewing.<eos> I was bored, and...<eos> Wow, you sure you want me to go out with a girl who lists sex as an interest?<eos> At least she didn't list it as an occupation, right?<eos> Look, she's hot, she's different, and she's getting her master's degree.<eos> She looks familiar.<eos> Oh, no. I'm not going out with someone you already slept with.<eos> No, from something else.<eos> Definitely didn't sleep with her. Not that I wouldn't.<eos> I totally would.
Not only is it signed to me but this is where he wiped his mouth.<eos> So we are currently in the presence of Leonard Nimoy's DNA.<eos> Um, doesn't Adam count as Leonard Nimoy's DNA?<eos> No offense, but this is pure 100% Nimoy.<eos> Because of your mother, you're only 50%.<eos> Which isn't bad, but anything that you wipe your mouth on gets thrown away.<eos> Okay, enough about the napkin.<eos> What else you hiding in there?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would.
This is about us having the right to do all the things Mom and Dad don't let us do.<eos> I am paving the way for future freedoms.<eos> I did not sit through the first five minutes of "Selma"<eos> when I meant to see "Horrible Bosses 2" for nothing.<eos> Would Oprah have signed on to play Selma if it wasn't a character she thought spoke for something she believed in?<eos> If I can't take a shot to the junk for something I believe in, why am I even here?<eos> I've lost the thread of this conversation.<eos> There's got to be something you want to do that Mom and Dad won't let you.<eos> Well, I would like to walk home from the library at night by myself.<eos> Of course you would.

He said he's "very attracted" to you, and we know what that means.<eos> Oh, God, don't even get me started.<eos> I don't even know what that means anymore.<eos> I do.<eos> A guy says something like that, it means his current relationship is about ready to bite the dust.<eos> He's putting out feelers.<eos> If you could go to his house for the holiday...<eos> I mean, would I like to go to the Chan's?<eos> Would I like to be surrounded by the unconditional love of a hundred Filipinos?<eos> Of course I would.
You feel like you're looking for a member of your own family.<eos> So, when Hector Rodriguez disappeared in 1999, you were the one who found his lunch box?<eos> Yes, I was.<eos> Hundreds of people looking, and you were the one who found it.<eos> I was trained by the NYPD.<eos> And I have good eyes.<eos> Good eyes.<eos> You didn't... you didn't find it because you knew where to look?<eos> No.<eos> How would I?
It's a lunch date.<eos> Don't make this weird.<eos> All right, where were we?<eos> Hold on a second. Rosie.<eos> You know I love Neil, but you have to admit he's...<eos> Talented?<eos> I was gonna say "odd," but sure.<eos> I mean, would you also peg him as...<eos> Sexually frustrated?<eos> Yes, I would.
Now?<eos> Your dad has all kinds of plans.<eos> Bill, why don't you tell him?<eos> Well, there are a lot of great social programs I've been in contact with, helped me find some housing, they're gonna help me find a job.<eos> You know, it is so great to finally spend some time with you, Karen.<eos> It would be even better if you lived closer to Max, you know?<eos> We could...<eos> We could do this all the time.<eos> Right, I'm sure Max would just love that.<eos> Oh, he would.
But now I'm up here and I can't remember why.<eos> Well, I'm sure it'll come to you.<eos> No, it won't.<eos> Please.<eos> Come on.<eos> Sit. It's okay.<eos> Do you hate me?<eos> - Not ever?<eos> Not ever.<eos> Because I would.
And, you know, if we're being responsible, you're stable.<eos> And what we wanted to ask you is...<eos> Is...<eos> Ready?<eos> Would you be our baby's godparents?<eos> Whoa!<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - No.<eos> Sure...<eos> Yeah, we would.
Well, everybody's concerned.<eos> Is something going on?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> There's just really nothing to tell.<eos> - Have you been seeing someone?<eos> - Oh, God, no.<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm married.<eos> I would never...
- So, what did you do...<eos> - ...to cause her death that day?<eos> - I can't tell you.<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because I don't remember!<eos> She was very happy that day.<eos> She asked me to say "I love you."<eos> I didn't.<eos> She wanted me to marry her.<eos> I wouldn't.
- You're not too big.<eos> Now, stand on my feet.<eos> I'm gonna teach you how to dance to your mother's favorite song.<eos> Okay.<eos> There and back.<eos> - Pretty easy, huh?<eos> - Not too bad.<eos> Now get off.<eos> Would you wear this suit tomorrow for me?<eos> Of course I would.
I see no logic in that.<eos> A logical definition ...<eos> Do not oppose evil, it remain indifferent to acts condemned by morality.<eos> It suits you?<eos> And if we were make this absence opposition to evil the principle of our behavior, what would our lives?<eos> What would they look like?<eos> What would they look like?<eos> Thieves, killers, pulluleraient nerds, the world would be ablaze.<eos> - What's left?<eos> - It would ... the crippled and crazy houses.
This is the system!<eos> God created it that way.<eos> What can I do about myself?<eos> In nature either, there is no justice.<eos> Here as elsewhere.<eos> - I mean those who ...<eos> - I have nothing to do.<eos> I wanted to say the same thing, and you leave me morality and conscience.<eos> - I had trouble expressing myself.<eos> - He would not ...
No.<eos> Any of his family, his friends?<eos> Is there talk about wanting a family with you?<eos> No.<eos> We never really talked about the future.<eos> Not really.<eos> Does he love you?<eos> He says he does.<eos> He only said it once.<eos> Why wouldn't he?
Did you quit? Or did somebody figure out that a nigger running like he stole something ain't nothing new?<eos> Emmett, be cool, all right?<eos> - I'm cool.<eos> - All right.<eos> Don't hold back on my account.<eos> A verbal taunt does not fulfill the protocol for self-defense, Sheriff, only a life-threatening act.<eos> And these little men aren't what I'd consider to be threatening.<eos> Fuck you, O.J.<eos> I do believe I now feel threatened.<eos> I would.
I mean, I actually want to go out with the girl who plays the princess.<eos> You are not a hero.<eos> To become a knight and win the hand of the princess, you must become a hero.<eos> Okay.<eos> How?<eos> The cards will show the way.<eos> All right, well, let's see what else Madame Dooriya has to say.<eos> How many bags did we bring?<eos> Madame D really wouldn't like this.<eos> No, she really, really wouldn't.
I mean, guys sitting behind desks, making decisions about other people's lives without being a part of those lives on a daily basis.<eos> It's not me.<eos> Well, hon, if-- then of course I'm okay.<eos> Maybe I'll just-- I'll commute back and forth.<eos> We could talk every night, and it could be fun to catch up on weekends.<eos> If that's what you feel you need to do.<eos> Babe, it's the National Gallery.<eos> I mean, this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.<eos> You wouldn't expect me not to take the job just because you changed your mind.<eos> I wouldn't.
Celorico?<eos> Not at all.<eos> Foz.<eos> I am sick, my dear.<eos> Liver, spleen, an amount of viscera.<eos> Twelve years of wine and eau-de-vie.<eos> I will not go over Celorico.<eos> You do not know the delightful story that I had with my mother.<eos> After finishing my studies at Coimbra, I wanted to settle in Lisbon with a nice pocket money monthly.<eos> She would not.
What?<eos> Mark, what are you doing?<eos> Having a little fun.<eos> It's not hurting anything, and it's not like Joe's calling.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Call her.<eos> And say what?<eos> If Joe were alive, we would know.<eos> Would we?<eos> You would.
I think I've had enough of those for like ten lifetimes.<eos> I feel you, girl.<eos> I just don't think I can open up another door, without knowing what's behind it.<eos> For once, I just want to... play it safe.<eos> Daphne, you got a customer.<eos> Hey. - You sure you're ok? - Yeah.<eos> - You sure? - Yeah.<eos> Would you be better if I kissed you?<eos> - That's cheesy!<eos> - But would you?
And yet here you stand alive...<eos> For now.<eos> Is that a threat?<eos> Oh, there's always another pretty, young body for me to jump into.<eos> From now on, every time you feel a connection to a woman, you'll be forced to wonder if it's me.<eos> You'll trust no one and spend the rest of eternity alone.<eos> I'm afraid you're trapped.<eos> Boundary spell.<eos> The Originals can enter, but they can't leave.<eos> You wouldn't.
Really? Well, then I'll try one.<eos> So, how are you enjoying the hospital so far?<eos> It's been seven weeks.<eos> You've been counting?<eos> Well, the place did get a bit rosier when you arrived.<eos> Do you say that to all the new nurses?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> I was only teasing.<eos> I know you wouldn't do that.<eos> Because I wouldn't.
Why should I believe you?<eos> You just attacked me!<eos> Why would I want to give the flight recorder to Nox if it would prove my own guilt?<eos> All right, I've heard enough.<eos> Let's go. Come on.<eos> You come into my pod and accuse my mother of mutiny?<eos> - Castor said that she and the pilot...<eos> - Enough about Castor!<eos> Nox was smart enough not to blindly trust him.<eos> - Why the hell would you?
Then what were you calling me about?<eos> Let's not talk about that now.<eos> What, Gavin?<eos> - Can I ask you a question?<eos> - Yes.<eos> You're a good-looking dude, don't you think?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I think I'm a good-looking guy, you know?<eos> But I'm not objective, so...<eos> On the good-looking scale, what would you...
You know, more than a few of your recent trips have coincided with in-flight thefts.<eos> That's why I got a brand-new bag.<eos> Tamper-proof zipper and an extra lock.<eos> You know, these days you can't trust anyone, right?<eos> They're awful.<eos> And, by the way, I like watches.<eos> That's a nice watch you're wearing.<eos> Oh. Well, you see, it's new.<eos> Now, if I flipped it over, I wouldn't see an engraving, "Cristal Kenny"<eos> on the back, would I?
I'm on eight right now, and I'm high as a kite.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> Um, so, listen, I'm kinda homeless right now.<eos> So does anyone have a place where I could crash for a few days?<eos> Like maybe Tori?<eos> Hey, Threepeat, how you doing?<eos> I know you wanted that Hong Kong office pretty bad.<eos> You know, it's okay.<eos> I mean, would I really wanna leave my friends and family, move to a strange country, work seven days a week, and have absolutely no social life?<eos> Of course I would.
- Think of a better name.<eos> - Come up with a better name, yeah.<eos> No, we're gonna...<eos> we're gonna make it work, okay?<eos> I'm gonna stay here, and you're gonna go to Hong Kong.<eos> - And you're gonna kick ass.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So we'll just do the long-distance thing, right?<eos> Yeah, I'll probably see more of you on Skype<eos> - ...than I would in Hong Kong.
What are you up to?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Cosima, you should really leave.<eos> Yeah, I know. I probably should.<eos> But they're planning something for Sarah.<eos> Delphine just sent me Rachel's itinerary.<eos> So, we know where she's gonna be?<eos> And we know where Sarah's gonna be.<eos> In 16 days, when you begin to ovulate, we would like to harvest your eggs.<eos> - You would?
It's... it's nothing.<eos> Oh, come on.<eos> It's not just nothing.<eos> So your mom and I've been talking.<eos> And I know you know that we're not exactly on the same page on this.<eos> But I don't know what to do, B.<eos> If we let you have the surgery and it causes more damage, are you gonna blame us when you're older because we let you make this decision when you were only 16?<eos> And if we don't, are we getting in the way of your dream?<eos> - I would never blame you.<eos> - But I would.
- SO WHEN DO WE FIGURE THE GOLD COMES IN?<eos> - WHEN EVERY DEPUTY IN FIVE COUNTIES IS ON DUTY.<eos> I KNOW HOW TO GET THAT INFORMATION.<eos> - BELLE.<eos> - THANK YOU FOR THE PIANO, NATE.<eos> IT'S...<eos> - I COULD COME BY LATER...<eos> MOVE IT WHEREVER YOU LIKE.<eos> - OH...<eos> I WOULD.
- No.<eos> The juice could have gotten in my eyes, Dan.<eos> The spicy burrito juice.<eos> I think you and I have a lot in common, actually.<eos> - We do?<eos> - Yeah. We say it like it is.<eos> So if I did want to run, why would I just step aside for you?<eos> See, that's what I'm talking about.<eos> - Why wouldn't you?<eos> - No, why would I?
It just happened.<eos> I wasn't over you.<eos> It was years later, and I was still in love with you.<eos> We argued and I left, okay?<eos> When did this happen?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Six months ago, maybe.<eos> Oh, around the time that he disappeared off his boat?<eos> No, it had nothing to do with that.<eos> - Karen, I would never...
Motion to dismiss?<eos> The case has been thrown out.<eos> It's over.<eos> What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> It can't be over.<eos> We turned down a half a million dollar settlement to fight.<eos> You're... you're just giving up?<eos> No, I'm not giving up, Lee Anne.<eos> I would never.
Wait a minute. Was that your drone today?<eos> Were you spying on us?<eos> I'm sorry. Your mom made me do it.<eos> She thought you were smoking grass.<eos> - Grass? - Claire.<eos> No one says grass.<eos> I never said grass.<eos> It's not that crazy an idea.<eos> We weren't smoking anything.<eos> Manny would never.
- What the...? - Looks like you got<eos> - a chain gang knocking on your back door.<eos> - Bikers?<eos> - What the hell do they want?<eos> - I think they want us to pull over.<eos> - Obviously, you idiot!<eos> ! - Kidnapping!<eos> It's a kidnapping, it's a kidnapping to kidnap me, Cherlene!<eos> - Why would bikers want to kidnap you?<eos> - Why would anyone?
And thank you, George Bore-well, for that clunky analogy in defense of totalitarianism, but I'm not feeding Shane an<eos> - elephant.<eos> - Who the hell is...<eos> Oh, my God, he's totally a<eos> Shane.<eos> So let me bounce this off you<eos> - guys...<eos> - What say we don't launch this giant nerve gas missile at, uh... where did you say you were launching it?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> I would, actually.
Well, it was with a Cabbage Patch doll and an ax.<eos> But same idea.<eos> Trust me.<eos> I was never late for kindergarten again.<eos> What?<eos> Come on.<eos> I second Marshall's vow.<eos> I will never, ever get that drunk again.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She would.
Okay, see you tomorrow.<eos> Off to bed, please.<eos> Katherine.<eos> She was so charming and nice.<eos> She was everything I wanted.<eos> Unfortunately yeah, she was married.<eos> Sure, I wanted to kill the guy.<eos> I thought about, chopping his head off.<eos> Draining him of every drop of blood that he had.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Now you think you'll simply pick Bash off, once my guard is down, or before they pop out an heir, and the throne will revert to Francis.<eos> - Aren't you ahead of me?<eos> It's as if we had one mind. - Catherine, don't.<eos> He's thought of every angle.<eos> Mary's right.<eos> Because I know your next plan is to kill me.<eos> To remove the largest obstacle and hasten things along.<eos> A stray arrow, a hunting accident.<eos> - I wouldn't dare.<eos> - Yes, you would.
According to Valdes, this meeting's supposed to start in an hour.<eos> Yeah, and Anibal's still up in his house eating pints of Cherry fucking Garcia.<eos> How the hell are they gonna have a meeting without him?<eos> That's because there is no meeting.<eos> Valdes is full of shit.<eos> Who'd you rather bang, Valdes or Frankie?<eos> - Frankie don't take dick.<eos> - I know!<eos> But let's just say she does.<eos> Or she would.
- When do you see each other?<eos> - He lives in san diego.<eos> We go to comic con together.<eos> It's all very normal.<eos> - Really? - Yeah.<eos> Because none of this seems normal to me.<eos> You know, I have the best of both worlds, Uh, being a father and an agent.<eos> - But why couldn't you tell me?<eos> Because you would have wanted to meet him.<eos> - Hells yeah I would.
No. You are worlds apart from those men in the desert.<eos> I'm not an idiot.<eos> I know you value me no more than those bikers back there.<eos> - The truth is...<eos> I don't care.<eos> - Because of what you feel?<eos> I've felt something before for someone on my team.<eos> It seems foolish now.<eos> I would die for you.<eos> Any man would.
Someone locked us in.<eos> - Fitz?<eos> - Sir.<eos> Ward and Lorelei are on the bus.<eos> Where's the collar and Sif?<eos> In there.<eos> That's why I'm standing guard.<eos> Would not want Sif to get out and hurt Lorelei.<eos> Ah.<eos> Of course we wouldn't.
The recordings of the girls talking?<eos> Do you have anything to do with that?<eos> I heard Mrs. Hoving hired a private investigator.<eos> I paid money to make him and the evidence disappear.<eos> So, you "took care of it."<eos> I was trying to protect her.<eos> But she didn't want your protection, did she?<eos> She was always very honest.<eos> You know, she said I'd pay for it.<eos> That we all would.
♪ Make the girl dance ♪<eos> ♪ Dance like no one's watching ♪<eos> Get in.<eos> ♪ Live like no one's out there ♪<eos> ♪ Dance like no one's watchin' ♪<eos> Okay, there's no easy way to say this, so I'm just gonna rip the band-aid right off.<eos> There's something going on between Karma and Liam.<eos> What?<eos> No.<eos> Karma and Liam, she would never...
- Dr. Ludwig?<eos> - I'll show myself out.<eos> Goddamn it, Stackhouse.<eos> Get your fucking eyes off her.<eos> I should've been here.<eos> Maybe I could've saved her. At least just-- Just been here for her when it happened or something.<eos> Hey.<eos> You can't blame yourself.<eos> And I'm sure if she were here right now, your mama would tell you the same thing.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
You know that.<eos> I called it off the second I knew that the family was safe.<eos> Now, I know it's complicated, but the fact of the matter is we are in this together, for better or for worse.<eos> So we don't have any choice but to trust each other.<eos> Just take the deal.<eos> If you do, the GTF can take down the Metas, and Daniel, Silvia and the rest of the family can be saved.<eos> What are you gonna do about Chapel's daughter?<eos> Everything okay with you and Ryan?<eos> If you would ever like to talk, I'm here.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Do you understand?<eos> Jesus!<eos> Peter, you're scaring me.<eos> You should be scared.<eos> These people do not fuck around.<eos> What I wanted... to say to you... is that nobody should have to go through what you went through.<eos> Nobody.<eos> And if that guy shows up here again, I'd say it to his face.<eos> I'd like to see that.<eos> I really would.
How do I know you're telling the truth?<eos> I'll turn the camera off.<eos> I think you know the Doctor's very powerful, and you can imagine he has many people in many places to help him.<eos> Do you believe that?<eos> Finn, I know you care about this girl.<eos> You're smart and you're able to think ahead, so you can imagine what will happen when she wakes up, tied up, with us here.<eos> She'll think we did it.<eos> No, no, we'll explain to her how we rescued her--<eos> And she won't believe it.<eos> No one would.
It wasn't rape.<eos> Okay, we just kind of...<eos> eiffel towered her.<eos> And how long did she party?<eos> I don't know...<eos> A couple hours.<eos> You know, I think she freaked out when she realized how late it was.<eos> You know, Elias said that's why she made up that whole story anyways.<eos> How could they say it was consensual?<eos> I would never...
I saw Pottinger's face when we sat across the table.<eos> He was laughing at me with his eyes.<eos> He knew something about the situation that I did not.<eos> I briefly considered the possibility that somehow you had betrayed me to him.<eos> Oh?<eos> But that rang hollow.<eos> You're a pal.<eos> So you think that Stahma...<eos> She wouldn't dare.<eos> No, she wouldn't.
Sometimes even three.<eos> (Normal voice) No. Oh, hell nah.<eos> Look, nah.<eos> Listen, I say where there's smoke, there's fire.<eos> Which means, girl, get your ass out that building before you get burned.<eos> See? See?<eos> Thank you.<eos> Tucker gets it.<eos> But... but aren't you the one who's always saying innocent until proven guilty?<eos> No. Why would I...
Did you, by chance, spend any time with him alone in your car?<eos> This is crazy!<eos> I'm a married woman and a-a marriage counselor.<eos> Is... is that what this man told you?<eos> Is that the truth?<eos> It's nonsense.<eos> I don't know that man.<eos> I had a few drinks, I paid my bill, and I was at home on the phone with my husband by 8:00 P.M.<eos> Okay, so, then if we got a warrant to search your car, we wouldn't find any of Mr. Strauss' hair or fluids... you know, DNA?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Oh, my God.<eos> Is that Mark Cuban's bodyguard?<eos> Oh, and Mark Cuban!<eos> last night, he and Margie hooked up... until they were havin' sex.<eos> Margie, last night was amazing.<eos> I want to finish what we started.<eos> I'm thinkin' me, you, and a weekend at my mansion in Monte Carlo.<eos> Oh, Cuban, that sounds incredible, but I'm working a flight to Miami which leaves in ten minutes.<eos> Unless... my new friends Stan and Francine could cover for me.<eos> Would you...?
- Who's Haylee?<eos> - My daughter.<eos> She just left.<eos> She went back to New York this morning.<eos> New York?<eos> [ Gasps ] How does she like it?<eos> I mean, based on the t-shirts I've seen, people seem to really love that place.<eos> Why wouldn't you introduce us?<eos> - I didn't know you'd want to meet her.<eos> - Well, of course I would!
What? What's the matter?<eos> Is it not working?<eos> Not yet.<eos> Meaning what, it won't boot up?<eos> Hardware issue. Not your problem.<eos> Pick up those clothes, please?<eos> "A small company... no one expected it to be anything evolved into something great, something magnificent."<eos> You gonna tell us how the booth looks?<eos> Is anyone coming?<eos> I would.
I think I know a few people who know you, Ray.<eos> I've-I've heard your name.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> I got a client who's, uh, willing to pay $20,000 to have sex with one of your actresses.<eos> My choice or his?<eos> Lexi Steele.<eos> Lexi Steele's my wife.<eos> How about I offer you 20 grand to fuck your wife?<eos> You gonna take that deal?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Oh, guilty? Why would I feel guilty?<eos> Huh? You wouldn't.<eos> Why would you?<eos> Who said that?<eos> You did.<eos> Just now. I heard you.<eos> Look, all I meant was I loved Paris... the food, the wine.<eos> And by the way, I don't think you gained any weight.<eos> Why would you bring that up?<eos> I wouldn't.
Oh, God, he's a drunk?<eos> - He's not a drunk.<eos> - Anymore.<eos> - And he's free.<eos> - Anyway, he says that you have to get Luke to sign his rights away before the adoption can go forward.<eos> How could I do that?<eos> Luke's dead-set against it.<eos> Hmm.<eos> Would you mind if I talked to him?<eos> Yes, I would.
Where the hell have you been?<eos> - Uh...<eos> - And you reek of weed.<eos> - [Scoffs] - No, us?<eos> Uh, actually, that's go-kart fumes, and you'd know that if you would ever employee appreciate us every once in a while.<eos> All we want is an entire day where you thank us with go-karts and maybe a cotton candy machine and may...<eos> I was thinking maybe, like, the goo goo dolls could perform, and I could sing Iris with them onstage.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Personally, I don't want the world to see me, 'cause I don't think they'd understand.<eos> They wouldn't.
I knew I loved him from the moment we met.<eos> He moved me here, and pretty soon she was on the way.<eos> And now it's just us two.<eos> I'm sorry it took so long, with all the... issues around Steve.<eos> Issues?<eos> Did Steve stay home every night?<eos> No, he was undercover.<eos> Had to be gone a lot.<eos> Did he wear a ring?<eos> No, why would he?
Is there someone we can call to see if she's up there?<eos> No. It's just an old barn.<eos> There's no record of a marriage license being granted, but if they just submitted it, it wouldn't be in the system yet.<eos> Well, Rita and I can go to city hall and check.<eos> I'm gonna drive up to the barn.<eos> Okay. Follow my lead.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> My fiancee and I would like to get married.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yes! We would.
- Huh?<eos> - That's right.<eos> I'm a married woman now.<eos> I'm jealous.<eos> It's nicer than my place.<eos> I had a tiny room.<eos> I'm happy.<eos> I feel good here.<eos> I'm not surprised.<eos> I would too.
Billy... ..Lizzie didn't send the money.<eos> I'm still waiting.<eos> Right, so here's how we're going to play this.<eos> You're going to give me these two bears for free.<eos> Free?<eos> Why would I do that?<eos> Because if you don't, I'm going to open up the back of my colleague's van here and let two wild animals chew up half your clientele.<eos> How does that sound?<eos> You wouldn't dare.<eos> He would.
I think not, Reverend.<eos> I...<eos> Fetch me Isaac.<eos> Now.<eos> I am, um...<eos> Astounded at the charity you've shown my child, but if I wish to see her, is that not a father's right?<eos> Why, in particular, do you wish to see her, Reverend?<eos> Were you perhaps considering another exorcism?<eos> Do your days grow dull, lacking a child to beat and torture and the nights far too lonely with no daughter to visit?<eos> - I would never...
I'm trying to save you from a life of ridin' the rails.<eos> Dad, that's just an expression.<eos> Tell that to Tony Lura.<eos> He half-assed it all summer on the grill at White Castle.<eos> A lot of people got really sick, actually.<eos> Then he just disappeared.<eos> Last anyone saw of him, he was hoppin' the Union Pacific Line with all of his possessions in a sock.<eos> Well, thanks for looking out for me, Dad.<eos> I sure wouldn't want to end up like Tony Lura.<eos> No, you wouldn't, son.
He's never shown the slightest bit of interest.<eos> When he had his hands on you, he had his hands on England.<eos> So he's decided to wed me, then keep all three crowns for himself.<eos> Thus his suddenly generous acceptance of the fact that you are not pregnant... yet.<eos> He wants to give you an heir himself.<eos> And the spectacle, the carnage...<eos> - Botched display of his prowess.<eos> - Does he honestly think that Francis and I would agree to have our marriage annulled?<eos> It's ridiculous!<eos> Even he wouldn't.
And then the bastard went on to become Boğaç Boray.<eos> Talk about destiny, I'm facing Pepe Muharrem again.<eos> And my dearest Arzu, poor girl, is in seventh heaven over playing with Boğaç Boray.<eos> Look, Zafer.<eos> The actor Arzu deserves By her side is Boğaç Boray.<eos> She is, God bless her, beautiful like the moon.<eos> You should consider it.<eos> "<eos> -He wouldn't accept." "<eos> -Exactly, he wouldn't."
How does it feel to be human?<eos> What'd you find out?<eos> That I'm getting played.<eos> What?<eos> You couldn't find Bannister's studio?<eos> Oh, I found it, abandoned, windows busted out.<eos> Well, then there's a mistake.<eos> It's gotta be a different house.<eos> Or you had me chasing ghosts to get me out of town.<eos> Why would...
Eugene, why did...<eos> Eugene?<eos> Why did you do that?<eos> - Um...<eos> - Answer me.<eos> I appreciate the positive affirmations and looking the other way on the perversion, but I know empirically and definitively I cannot survive on my own.<eos> - I cannot. - So you killed the bus?<eos> If I don't cure the disease, if I don't save the world, I have no value.<eos> - That's not how it works. - If I don't fix things, there's no way you people would keep me around, share resources, even protect me.<eos> Of course we would.
Not in this one.<eos> Salud, gentlemen.<eos> Open your mouth.<eos> Wider.<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> You got to "Ma'am" me tonight?<eos> I wasn't trying to.<eos> We need to go ahead and close up, if you don't mind.<eos> Why would I?
If there are 48 of us here, we still have people out there.<eos> The patrol brought in everyone they could find.<eos> What about the Ark?<eos> It came down last...<eos> We saw it. There were multiple crash sites over 100 square miles.<eos> If there were survivors, we will bring them in, too.<eos> You have my word.<eos> I want to see my people.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> I would, too.
What if I do find it?<eos> I mean, I am not just gonna give it to Klaus.<eos> He and Elijah are both brutal, sadistic monsters.<eos> I do wish I could disagree with you.<eos> Tragically, however, you're quite right.<eos> Although you and I both have excellent reason to find that weapon.<eos> I want it to protect my family, and you want it to protect your friends.<eos> We'd do well to forget our grievances and join forces.<eos> No.<eos> - Davina, would you just... - No.
And I also wanted to study marine biology, and I know the service will pay for it once I get out, so I really hope I can get into scripps in San Diego.<eos> It's the best program in the world.<eos> Brian and I were about the same age, but he seemed so much older.<eos> He knew exactly what he wanted out of his life and how he was gonna get it.<eos> Talking to him made all my worries about college, my mom, Matty, seem so trivial.<eos> I'm gonna go meet my buddies in town.<eos> We're kind of down here for one last hurrah.<eos> But...<eos> Do you want to swap numbers?<eos> I would...
- Yes,<eos> I thought you'd enjoy it.<eos> You cleared it with your folks, right?<eos> Yeah, I don't think they believe me, though.<eos> Cops don't usually bring me home.<eos> To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
- Yes,<eos> I thought you'd enjoy it.<eos> You cleared it with your folks, right?<eos> Yeah, I don't think they believe me, though.<eos> Cops don't usually bring me home.<eos> To their home...<eos> They don't bring me to their home.<eos> I'm confused, this morning you were mad at me.<eos> No, I wouldn't call that mad.<eos> Okay, I really would.
After he convinced me to do so.<eos> How does your body stand straight without a spine?<eos> Xiangyang.<eos> The loss.<eos> Your journey there.<eos> Your time with the whore's whore-friend.<eos> Sanctioned by the Khan of Khans.<eos> You alerted the Song to our pending attack.<eos> You conspired to lead us into the slaughter.<eos> What need would they of warning?
- Hi.<eos> - You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - Hi.<eos> We saved you dinner.<eos> Wow, that was really sweet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Maybe you'd like a... (quietly) drink?<eos> (quietly): Yeah, I would.
- To now.<eos> - To now.<eos> All right, I can't help it.<eos> I got to see what's on Snark Hampton.<eos> Yeah, you and Cinco might want to see this.<eos> Well, my butt looks great, and my friends are douches. [Chuckles]<eos> I just can't believe that...<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Why would Oz want to make Hank look bad?<eos> Why would anyone?
You just have to have a little faith in our shared humanity.<eos> I hope they're all this compliant.<eos> Don't worry about her, dad.<eos> Dr. Tsing isn't big on admitting when she's wrong.<eos> But I got to hand it to you.<eos> We're getting the most effective treatments we've ever had, and it's all because you asked nicely.<eos> You think I'm stupid?<eos> Tell me you weren't behind the breach that almost killed Maya.<eos> I wasn't.<eos> Dad, I wouldn't...
I love you, sweetheart.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> We thought we'd invite you and your family out for a hearty breakfast at Fresco's.<eos> The food is to die for. It's absolutely fabulous.<eos> And afterwards we're going up on the mountain on snowmobiles.<eos> Come on, Carters, you gotta come.<eos> - Dad, let's go, come on.<eos> - Yeah, Dad, let's go.<eos> Kids, your dad already made plans.<eos> Yes... or we would.
Well, maybe I'll get lucky with the dad.<eos> Hmm. You know... I still don't get how you wait three weeks to report your kid missing.<eos> Oh, come on, Murray, Sam's in college.<eos> When I was in school, I'd go a month without talking to my parents.<eos> I can't imagine not knowing where Maia is for that long.<eos> Your daughter's nine years old.<eos> Let's revisit this in ten years.<eos> No, trust me, I will now.<eos> You know what?<eos> You probably would.
- Yes.<eos> The situation of the station is clear.<eos> Fake leather...<eos> My ass is on fire.<eos> - Get better soon.<eos> - This is the "better".<eos> Would you like to discuss the work conditions?<eos> - Is there Social Security?<eos> - Would you like that?<eos> - Who wouldn't?
♪ Arrow 3x08 ♪ The Brave and the Bold Original Air Date on December 3, 2014<eos> == sync, corrected by elderman == @elder_man What about this A.R.G.U.S. angle?<eos> Oh, well, A.R.G.U.S. wiped all evidence of their agent's death after he was killed, or at least they thought they did.<eos> Our boomerang victim, Kai Wu.<eos> The man's profile is so clean, I should have known it was an A.R.G.U.S. cover.<eos> Well, now that we know Wu is A.R.G.U.S., maybe Lyla can get us a lead?<eos> If this an A.R.G.U.S. thing, Lyla's going to want it to stay that way.<eos> Then tell her to stop letting people get killed in my city.<eos> You really don't care about my marriage, do you?<eos> Well, I would...
Spring of '83.<eos> Is there anything in there?<eos> There's some surgical notes, ideas.<eos> Maybe you'll see something. I didn't.<eos> I have a surgery.<eos> Thanks for this.<eos> We need to talk about Maggie Pierce.<eos> The e-mail said for professional and personal reasons.<eos> Now, you know what that could be?<eos> - Well, why would I?
- And you should have had mine.<eos> You listened to my speech.<eos> You said it was good.<eos> - It was good.<eos> - Then what the hell, then?<eos> - Bailey's was better. - Well, that's great.<eos> Alex, you would make a fine board member, but Bailey will make an exceptional one.<eos> Is that what you want me to do... vote for you to be good, to be fine?<eos> You want my pity vote?<eos> I wouldn't.
Wonderful.<eos> Oh, and I'll take a bag of chips.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Just finished entertaining at a children's party.<eos> Mr. Berenstain was a big hit.<eos> How could you let her do this to me, Finch-- tranq me like I'm some kind of animal?<eos> It was for your own good, Ms. Shaw.<eos> You are no longer safe from Samaritan's gaze, and you wouldn't listen to reason.<eos> He's right, Sam.<eos> You really wouldn't.
Are you referring to Mr. Richards?<eos> I never felt the need for security cameras.<eos> This is a good neighborhood, or... or was.<eos> Shut up, Marty.<eos> I'm here about the security cameras on your property.<eos> Looks like one in particular might have recorded our crime scene last night.<eos> I don't want to get caught in skinhead on skinhead violence.<eos> I don't want them coming for me.<eos> Look. I'll look back through the footage myself and let you know.<eos> As soon as possible, if you would.
I don't have a last name, none of us did.<eos> That day, the day before graduation, I admited, I was scared.<eos> Tomorrow we'd be asigned our jobs. Our purpose.<eos> Seemed everyone knew theirs already.<eos> Not me.<eos> I was lost.<eos> I always felt like I saw things ... Differently. Saw things other people didn't.<eos> I never said anything.<eos> I didn't wanna be different.<eos> Who would?
I don't feel sad and I don't feel angry, I just feel... humiliated.<eos> To humiliation.<eos> Okay, God gives you three wishes.<eos> Ah! God's not a Tombola machine, Martin, he just doesn't give wishes.<eos> - Three wishes, anything you want.<eos> - That's easy.<eos> Billions of pounds and my own personal hit man. And a Court waiver over anything I want to do.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Um-hm.<eos> I'd...
Same as the Cubbies!<eos> Yes. Yes!<eos> You make a lot of sense, Victor.<eos> My pleasure. Yeah, my pleasure.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Yeah. May I show you something very, very, very incredible?<eos> Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Wow. You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?
Yes. Yes!<eos> You make a lot of sense, Victor.<eos> My pleasure. Yeah, my pleasure.<eos> My pleasure.<eos> Yeah. May I show you something very, very, very incredible?<eos> Yeah, of course!<eos> For my daughter.<eos> Wow. You think she will love it?<eos> Yeah, well, who wouldn't?<eos> Yeah? Who wouldn't?
- Your grubby paw was in my bed!<eos> Were you kissing my hand?<eos> No.<eos> And what about you with all your shedding?<eos> - I don't shed.<eos> - Really.<eos> Uh...<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - I just want to get my stuff.<eos> - Would you just... - Hey.
Then he kills Paul.<eos> And found he was in both feet.<eos> Victor, I want him to know something.<eos> I want him to know that if there's anything left in this world that he still cares about,<eos> I'm going to find it. And I'm gonna burn it down.<eos> He's probably wondering right now what I'm thinking.<eos> What my plan is.<eos> And how much I know.<eos> Wouldn't you be wondering what I'm thinking?<eos> I would.
One day, years ago, I woke up and I realised that I hadn't a clue what to do with all my money.<eos> Tell us how you got your money, Mr Ryland.<eos> This is an invitation-only event, sir.<eos> You won't answer my telephone calls, Mr Ryland.<eos> How else am I supposed to reach you?<eos> This is intolerable. Eh?<eos> What are you hiding?<eos> Who are the Big Four?<eos> Well, it seems that everyone wants to be here tonight.<eos> And why wouldn't they?
- Well...<eos> - Weird.<eos> Hey, there's Syd and Amber.<eos> - Amber?<eos> No.<eos> - No.<eos> - That's not...<eos> - No.<eos> No.<eos> I wouldn't...
That's all you have to say is "yes"?<eos> I mean, yes, sir.<eos> I'm going to assume that your parents don't know where you are.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I mean, no.<eos> Whichever one means they know I'm here and they're totally cool with it.<eos> What's your home number, Edmund. Now!<eos> 049-157-0158.<eos> They're never going to let me set foot outside the apartment again, are they?<eos> I wouldn't.
You're very quiet, my darling.<eos> Oh, no, I'm just listening.<eos> I hope you're not planning to rush off.<eos> I meant what I said earlier.<eos> But there must be so many exciting things to do in the city at this time.<eos> For a woman just out of mourning, no.<eos> Of course, I... I don't want to impose.<eos> You would never be an imposition.<eos> Livvy would love the company.<eos> We all would.
Well, now's good.<eos> Look, she's there.<eos> Were you planning to stay... in Scotland, with your family?<eos> We're assuming you will, and that's fine, we completely understand...<eos> But we want you to stay with us, because you're sound. Yeah. Quite.<eos> Erm, but this is your home too and you'd be more than welcome to come back here.<eos> I'd like that.<eos> We'd like that.<eos> Well, I'd like it very much.<eos> We would.
Where are you?<eos> Now I'm working in the ministry.<eos> Imagine I'm on the team Department of Climate.<eos> Tell me you would not have to tell me earlier?<eos> What?<eos> I was coming?<eos> Yes, you came.<eos> Why?<eos> Because then I would leave.<eos> You would pro hairdresser, or what?
Well, three years is a long time to go without sleep.<eos> He came in initially to work through his insomnia.<eos> Things evolved from there.<eos> I want to skip to the important stuff, as I can...<eos> I can tell you're a busy woman.<eos> Uh, how would you describe the mental state of your patient, Thomas Grey, in the weeks leading up to his death?<eos> I would say he was accepting of what was about to come.<eos> Really?<eos> Do most people accept that they're dying?<eos> 'Cause I sure as hell wouldn't.
- I was out of line.<eos> - You were out of your mind.<eos> My ears rang like the first time I heard my mom use the f-word.<eos> You ok?<eos> I know it's a stupid question considering that none of us could possibly be ok doing what we do, but... are you ok?<eos> Do I seem different?<eos> You're a little different, but you've always been a little different.<eos> Brilliant strategy... that way no one ever knows if something's up with you.<eos> How would I know if something was up with you?<eos> You wouldn't.
Well... it's a little personal, don't you think?<eos> Okay, well, then I will back up and make with the polite conversation.<eos> Um, what do you do in the real world?<eos> My relationship to the real world would be tenuous, at best.<eos> I hear that.<eos> But, if you must know, I traverse the globe.<eos> In the company of musicians.<eos> You're a groupie.<eos> I prefer muse.<eos> Sure, who wouldn't?
How much assistance?<eos> Ten thousand men.<eos> It would take considerable coin and effort to raise such a force.<eos> And in return you will be offered a command.<eos> Under Cossinius and Furius, of course.<eos> An offer better received from the men themselves.<eos> They've withdrawn to a villa on the outskirts of Nuceria, within short ride of what remains of their legion to the north.<eos> Spartacus continues to gather force in the valley of Campania.<eos> You know I would not have come if situation did not demand of it.<eos> No. You would not.
Put your fork down and get over 'ere.<eos> I'll put my fork down when I'm ready to put my fork down.<eos> I'll finish my pudding when I'm ready to finish my pudding.<eos> You wanna disrespect me, disrespect me.<eos> But then I won't be able to tell you what I know.<eos> And I know you'd like to know what I know.<eos> - What would I like to know?<eos> - Wouldn't you like to know?<eos> - I would like to know.<eos> - Yeah, you would, wouldn't ya?

Get me the address to that paint factory ASAP.<eos> Excuse me, Ashburn? Um...<eos> I was wondering...<eos> Oh. This is a little awkward.<eos> Uh, it's nothing personal, but as a rule I make it a point not to date my co-workers, so... thank you.<eos> I was wondering if you would not talk to me in that tone.<eos> Oh!<eos> Yes, of course!<eos> That's a little different.<eos> I wouldn't. Why would I?
Damn it!<eos> You did?<eos> You didn't, did you?<eos> No, you didn't, did you?<eos> That's Piper's mother?<eos> Yeah, and it's funny that she's jogging, 'cause when we first met, I was the one who was running.<eos> (Rooster clucking)<eos> But I was so struck by her beauty that I had to stop.<eos> (Siren wailing) Hey, you want a free fighting rooster? Ah!<eos> Who wouldn't?
Maybe you wanna tell us about the other missing girls?<eos> You know, the ones with the bar code, like Oksana's.<eos> Were you just passing the time with a few recreational kills until you found the girl you really wanted?<eos> Or did your employer hire you to kill them, too?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That brings up a good point.<eos> At the airport, you were in arrivals, not departures.<eos> You were there to meet your employer, weren't you?<eos> Uh, Kate, I wouldn't... (Slams door)<eos> Yes, I would.
It also tends to keep negotiations to a minimum. Makes it more of a business transaction.<eos> You probably have a million reasons to hate your ex-husband, but this shouldn't be one of 'em.<eos> May I have a moment with you, please?<eos> "Millions of reasons" to hate me?<eos> Three years after a divorce, a rich ex-wife should have a string of young guys helping her forget, but she's still really pissed at you.<eos> That kind of anger is earned.<eos> Right now, I'm more concerned about the chip.<eos> Chip?<eos> Your son has a tracer chip in him, right?<eos> I wouldn't...
- He's here.<eos> He's in America.<eos> And he's planning an attack.<eos> I got him! I got him!<eos> Do you remember that day that that lady came, Carrie?<eos> What she said about... a bomb and you wanting to hurt people...<eos> I don't want to lie to you.<eos> So you were gonna do those things?<eos> But I didn't.<eos> And I wouldn't now.
Of course, you can have another cupcake!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Why didn't you say so?<eos> I'll get you a bigger pond immediately.<eos> I think what Gummy's trying to say is--<eos> He's always wanted a pair of riding pants?<eos> His toenails need a new coat of shellack?<eos> He wants to floss twice a day instead of just once?<eos> I think what Gummy is trying to say is that he'd like a little Spike time.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Um...<eos> I think I should take the leg off first.<eos> Of course.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I can help if...<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Um, Velcro straps and plastic sockets aren't exactly sexy, and I wanted this evening to be all about sexy, so I think that I need to take the leg off myself.<eos> And I need you not to watch.<eos> Oh, you want me to go in the bathroom until your leg's off and you're under the covers?<eos> Would you?
You okay?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> You know, I was only helping Bradley because some of her dad's stuff was at work.<eos> Yeah, whatever.<eos> It doesn't matter to me.<eos> I'm over her.<eos> If you want to go out with her, go for it.<eos> I'm not going out with her.<eos> No, but you want to.<eos> Who wouldn't?
He's dead.<eos> And the lunch rush... (Pats countertop) is about to start.<eos> Okay.<eos> Hold on.<eos> Is there a soup that we should know about?<eos> You know what? (Paper rustles)<eos> Here.<eos> I think Marty would've wanted you to have these.<eos> I don't suppose you'd want to take Marty with you?<eos> I would, but...
You speak your heart.<eos> I know your concern for the boy.<eos> He no longer stands as such.<eos> But in the eyes of his father.<eos> Would my wife could voice such simple wisdom.<eos> I saw the gathering of trunks.<eos> She goes with you?<eos> It was her intent.<eos> Yet I would find no comfort in her presence.<eos> As I would in yours...
- Oh, we're fine, thanks.<eos> You can't just come in here... there are things you don't know about Peter.<eos> - I wrote the article about Roy Kapeniak.<eos> - Please leave.<eos> Right now.<eos> It was Peter who convinced him to talk to me.<eos> What?<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't understand.<eos> - Why would he...
- Raymond Tusk.<eos> The President wants to tap him as the new V.P.<eos> - You and I cannot let that happen.<eos> - Why not?<eos> Because a third of his fortune is tied up in nuclear energy.<eos> Sancorp does not want a pro-nuclear businessman in the White House.<eos> The market is shifting toward natural gas anyway.<eos> But Tusk wants to stall that shift or reverse it.<eos> Vice President doesn't have that kind of influence.<eos> This one would.
You asked me why I didn't want to know the truth about Granddad. It's because I already do.<eos> He killed himself.<eos> Do I have all the answers? No.<eos> But I had to move on.<eos> And your mother is having a very tough time doing that.<eos> And I understand.<eos> I did, too.<eos> I loved your granddad very much.<eos> But if I didn't move forward, I never would have studied law, I wouldn't have become a judge.<eos> I wouldn't...
You're 22.<eos> We can still put him away.<eos> I don't know if I can do this.<eos> It could help your brother do less time.<eos> And we will be with you every step of the way.<eos> The men who beat you up were wrong.<eos> And we were wrong.<eos> You didn't molest Angelica.<eos> You didn't molest Sofia.<eos> No, I would never--
No, no.<eos> I cancelled.<eos> Did you know your daughter is a cynic in love?<eos> No.<eos> I'm pragmatic.<eos> Love doesn't last long, does it?<eos> - Have you seen your sister?<eos> - Not in a week.<eos> - Is she coming?<eos> - Why wouldn't she?
Wylie's here?<eos> Yes.<eos> He...<eos> Caro?<eos> He saved me.<eos> And now he's going to stay with me.<eos> I mean, he'll, he'll always look after me.<eos> I didn't come home when father died.<eos> You couldn't get leave.<eos> You'd only just...
I need to be assured That you'll be ready to act when called upon.<eos> I'll do whatever's asked of me.<eos> All right.<eos> The lamb.<eos> Shoot it.<eos> What?<eos> I'm asking you to kill the lamb you see before you.<eos> Clearly, you doubt me.<eos> On the contrary. I believe in your goodness.<eos> Then why would y-
I mean, how much did you know? Because we had no idea.<eos> Look at Wilson's face.<eos> And that is not my fault!<eos> Tell that to his dad.<eos> Because she doesn't have him, by the way.<eos> Tell us the truth.<eos> All of it, not bits, not pieces, all.<eos> Or I leave.<eos> Would you at least like to sit down first, Becky? No, Jessica.<eos> I fucking wouldn't.
What I talk to Flo about are things that we need to talk about.<eos> These were his terms.<eos> And you agreed to them.<eos> Yes, under pressure, but I didn't know you'd call him every week.<eos> And don't pretend you don't have a choice.<eos> We got ourselves into this.<eos> You can't even cook anymore.<eos> "Baby, baby, baby".<eos> - Do you want me to end it with Flo?<eos> - Would you?
The guy's got jitters.<eos> The Rezident said that?<eos> Yes.<eos> So, he'll want to meet with him soon.<eos> How did you get him to talk?<eos> I sucked his cock, just like you told me to.<eos> I never said that.<eos> I-i never said that.<eos> Nina, Jesus...<eos> I-I-i wouldn't.
Damon, voice-over:<eos> The cure is within our reach, but we're not the only ones looking for it.<eos> You're one of the 5.<eos> Aah!<eos> [Crack]<eos> [Damon grunting]<eos> [Groans]<eos> Something bothering you?<eos> Would you believe me if I said mosquitoes?<eos> Oh, aye, I would.
Well, he admits that he was at her building last night but says that he didn't actually buzz up to her apartment.<eos> Well, let's see if Sarah's DNA shows up in his SUV, and if the rope matches.<eos> Maybe Sarah's stalker showed up last night?<eos> Hey, I think I got something.<eos> I checked out the deal memo and corporate structure.<eos> Sarah had a controlling interest in the company,<eos> - but now all her shares are sold to Jen.<eos> - Sarah didn't want to sell.<eos> She didn't get a chance to sign the deal memo.<eos> Or maybe she wouldn't.
What are you asking me?<eos> I wanted to suggest a deal.<eos> You give me a pass on the journalists and I will charge the police half the usual rate for your room.<eos> You like my company that much?<eos> I've had worse guests.<eos> It must be a bloody hard job running this place.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> How do you relax?<eos> I have my ways.<eos> Would you...
- That's prime real estate.<eos> Watch out, someone's coming.<eos> Uh, uh, just checking out this great project.<eos> This must be a really smart kid, right?<eos> Not as smart as this kid right here;<eos> She's a genius.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I think that kid stole this kid's idea and she should probably get a lawyer.<eos> Oh, he wouldn't dare.<eos> Oh, he would.
- (barking)<eos> Bitsy!<eos> (laughing, kissing)<eos> Oh, what happened to your clothes?<eos> Let's get you into your big-dog pants. (barks)<eos> Come back!<eos> (barking)<eos> - Bitsy!<eos> - Maybe he doesn't like wearing clothes.<eos> With that body, I wouldn't either. (growls)
That it's time to move back to Ohio so I can marry Clay and raise Shania in a place where people still worship God and football and spareribs.<eos> No, it isn't.<eos> Goldie, sit down.<eos> I want to say thank you, Goldie, for changing my life.<eos> Look at what you've done.<eos> You came here, you got this incredible apartment for you and your daughter, you started your own business.<eos> You showed me how to be an independent woman.<eos> And now I've got green in the bank and a black friend named Rocky.<eos> I don't ever want to go back to the way things were.<eos> Why would you?
They're gonna shoot it down.<eos> Probably.<eos> Just hang with us in the meantime.<eos> HANK: No one cares about any Scout rules.<eos> You ever actually read the manual?<eos> Do I look fit of mind and body?<eos> And don't get me started on the self-abuse chapter.<eos> FREDDIE: For real.<eos> What grown man would actually want to live by these principles?<eos> I would.

Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry for what?<eos> Where's Caitlyn?<eos> You know Roddy, don't you?<eos> Good news is you're both here, which means neither of you killed Eileen.<eos> That's off to a reasonably good start.<eos> Gentlemen, please don't even think about it.<eos> E-Eileen would want you two to be making peace.<eos> Like hell she would.
Right here.<eos> Noogie, noogie, noogie, noogie, noogie, noogie.<eos> Damn it!<eos> You messed up my bomb-ass weave, and I'm all out of hair glue!<eos> - Ooh.<eos> - Hey, buddy.<eos> If you want Sonia to like you, you may wanna update some of your moves.<eos> Maybe you can help Danny.<eos> You are very good with women.<eos> Yeah, would you, Ryan?
Almost more than a woman can bear.<eos> And when Clyde wanted his way with me, there wasn't much I could do.<eos> I mean...<eos> I only weigh 106 pounds.<eos> And Clyde is so strong.<eos> And I...<eos> Forgive me, Jesus.<eos> I was so weak.<eos> What me and Bonnie done, those we stole from and the laws, they'd probably tell things different.<eos> Hell, even Bonnie, sure she would, too.
Is that all it takes?<eos> I moved on.<eos> Where?<eos> ! Where can you be now that you can forget something like that?<eos> Spoilers.<eos> No.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> For once, I would like to know where I'm going.<eos> No.<eos> You really wouldn't.
- They found a stash of syringes.<eos> - Well, I'm diabetic.<eos> Those are perfectly legal for me to have.<eos> Black market drugs.<eos> Pretty common in India, right?<eos> They think that you snuck some home, used one of your perfectly legal needles to kill your cheating girlfriend.<eos> Look, I'm not denying that we had troubles, but I would never hurt Mia.<eos> You need to believe me.<eos> I'd like to.<eos> I really would, Ben.
Annoyingly, so am I.<eos> What do you mean, no?<eos> What do you think I mean?<eos> It's not a very complicated word.<eos> Don't you want to be Lady Aysgarth and rank alongside your daughter?<eos> Lord Aysgarth, I'm modern.<eos> I don't hanker for those days before the war.<eos> And I don't really want to spend the rest of my life among people who think me loud and opinionated and common.<eos> But I assure you, they wouldn't.<eos> Ah, yes, they would.
By playing tic-tac-toe?<eos> Yep. Your turn.<eos> Oh, Amy.<eos> And you wonder why people think neuroscience is nothing but a goofy game for diaper babies.<eos> Tic-tac-toe can only end in win, lose or draw... none of which will deny me closure.<eos> Especially since I'm about to win.<eos> B-But we didn't finish.<eos> Exactly.<eos> How does that make you feel?<eos> The same way any normal person would.
- What was the theme?<eos> - Yeah, who cares about the theme?<eos> - What were you wearing?<eos> - I want to know the theme.<eos> ♪ Who's that girl?<eos> ♪ ♪ It's Jess. ♪ It was after prom.<eos> ♪ Who's that girl?<eos> Cece and I were both 18, and we'd rented a hotel room.<eos> So... would you like to freak?<eos> Yes, I would.
Let's hit the showers.<eos> I can't wait to stick it to opposing counsel.<eos> Do you need me to give you a hand out of there?<eos> [Knocking]<eos> [Sighs] I know who you are.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> No, Nick.<eos> You shouldn't be here.<eos> I'd like you to go.<eos> No. You wouldn't.
I don't consider it a win.<eos> Do you really want to gamble five years of her life, so you can prove you're better than Cameron?<eos> You know as well as I do, he's only offering this 'cause he knows he's got a loser.<eos> It's the exact same deal we offered with one technical change.<eos> Do you know how they enter a technical knockout in the record books?<eos> As a knockout.<eos> I would.<eos> What?<eos> You asked me before if I'd do it again.<eos> I would.
- It's two years' work.<eos> - Wow.<eos> - You're gonna get your job.<eos> We'll be like the rockefellers.<eos> We'll be like the rockefellers!<eos> Yeah, if I get it.<eos> I haven't gotten it yet.<eos> Company's been trying to poach you for years.<eos> They'd be lucky to have you.<eos> Yeah, they would.

Why does a guy like Nolan Powers try to burn his house down?<eos> Or why -- why does he do any of this?<eos> Unless it's not Nolan Powers.<eos> I owe you.<eos> All smoothed out.<eos> No charges will be filed.<eos> He's in the holding area.<eos> All right, well, before they release him and he runs off again,<eos> I would really like to speak with him.<eos> Yeah, so would I.
Anyhow, listen.<eos> Speaking of su casa, uh, your mom and I would like to offer you our casa...<eos> or at least the address... in case you want to send Boyd to the elementary school in our neighborhood.<eos> [Sighs] You mean lie to the school district?<eos> [Scoffs] Well, it's not exactly the Lufthansa heist.<eos> People do this all the time.<eos> And besides, I think... your mom might like to have Boyd a couple nights a week.<eos> Oh, it would make mom happy, huh?<eos> - She'd love it.<eos> She really would.
All right.<eos> But it isn't a date.<eos> All right, fine.<eos> It's not a date.<eos> Rudy 1 or Rudy 2?<eos> It's Rudy!<eos> It's just Rudy!<eos> I'm Ghostbusters, he's Ghostbusters II, and everybody knows Ghostbusters II was a right piece of shit.<eos> I quite liked it.<eos> You fucking would, wouldn't you?
[Nina] This is Monica, who has two kids on her own.<eos> I could live without being married...<eos> It's disappointing, but I could not live without these kids.<eos> I'm sure, if I did not have these kids, I would've...<eos> I just don't think I could have been happy. I just don't think I could have had lived a satisfying life.<eos> For me. You know?<eos> But that's a good question.<eos> I don't know why some women can...<eos> I've sometimes thought it would be easier, if I didn't want these kids so much, you know what I mean?<eos> - It would.
Oh, well, then I'm willing to pretend that you're a gentleman.<eos> Okay, you are definitely not a gentleman.<eos> What would we even do it with?<eos> Whipped cream.<eos> Enough about this conversation.<eos> I want to revisit our earlier one.<eos> This is our earlier one.<eos> Come on, you know you've thought about it.<eos> Yeah, I think about a lot of things.<eos> And you would.
She's great, let's beat it.<eos> Yeah, you guys go.<eos> You know, I want someone to be happy.<eos> - Maybe I'll just call Paul. - No!<eos> No, that is the worst thing you can do.<eos> Really?<eos> Haskell, I'm sorry, I can't leave Holly alone tonight.<eos> Would you mind taking a rain check?<eos> - Well, I...<eos> - Of course he wouldn't.
- Hey.<eos> I, uh, know it's only been 24 hours, but were you able to pull anything from that detail I gave you-- a name, a number?<eos> They're ready for you down in polygraph.<eos> Okay, tell them I'll be there in five.<eos> So were you able to find anything?<eos> No.<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> That's disappointing.<eos> I can keep looking if you like.<eos> Would you, please?
Wait, Marina.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I love you!<eos> What?<eos> I'll love you no matter what.<eos> Even if you have the baby, and it... and it looks like a little Greg with a little hat and everything, I'm not going anywhere.<eos> I'll stand here forever if I have to because I love you and I don't ever wanna be without you.<eos> Ever.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> But would you?
Good.<eos> Then perhaps you'll reconsider singing at the stockholder showcase.<eos> - We're looking into it. That's right...<eos> - Sorry. No can do.<eos> Look, this event is crucial to our reboot of the label.<eos> We need the stockholders to get excited about this new direction that I'm taking.<eos> It's a focus on fresh, new talent.<eos> It's a focus that you inspired, by the way.<eos> You know, I would love to reschedule...<eos> I really would... For them.
It's unclear what exactly miss Locke will be talking about, other than the White House spin machine that she says put her in this position.<eos> Come on, Brooke, the real question on everyone's lips is if the president's mistress wasn't Jeannine Locke and it wasn't Olivia Pope, then who was the first lady talking about?<eos> Frankly, Mrs. Grant is a woman of a certain age.<eos> It wouldn't be the first time a powerful man's wife got jealous for no reason.<eos> Which is a shame, because otherwise Mellie Grant is an intelligent, accomplished woman.<eos> She could have had a political career of her own.<eos> I'll be right there.<eos> Jeannine, thank you so much for agreeing to meet me.<eos> Mrs. Grant, I just wanted to tell you that I didn't.<eos> I would never.
I...<eos> I didn't want to get stabbed.<eos> I was scared.<eos> See, that's where I get stuck.<eos> The way you jumped out of that barn, went down in that basement...<eos> I guess I'm just having a hard time believing that you were scared.<eos> I think you knew that my curse would kick in and save me.<eos> I really...<eos> I don't know the first thing about it.<eos> But Audrey Parker would.
You're family.<eos> You'd do anything for each other, right?<eos> Is there something you want from me?<eos> Thatcher Karsten thought your husband was stealing from him.<eos> He wasn't.<eos> Lou Mrozek was the most honorable man I've ever known.<eos> And yet after 27 years of honesty, hard work, and commitment,<eos> Karsten had no problem believing that your husband, Lou, embezzled a million dollars from the company.<eos> That's why Lou did the right thing and he went to the feds, and that's why Karsten sent T.J. to take care of him.<eos> No, T.J. would never --
Yeah.<eos> Except when a bear is chasing you.<eos> Then you get the hell out of the way.<eos> Get enough to eat?<eos> Oh. That t-bone was like something out of "The Flintstones".<eos> I'm very proud of you, son.<eos> Maybe I haven't given you enough responsibility.<eos> I'm gonna fix that.<eos> You'd like that, wouldn't you?<eos> Yeah, I would.
Unless I have to.<eos> Let's go home, my brother.<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - I know.<eos> I got the restraining order, but I just... I had to see you.<eos> I've got nothing to say to you.<eos> But I gotta say this to you.<eos> I did not hurt Tara.<eos> I didn't cause that miscarriage.<eos> - I would never...
I mean, we all understand the way the world works.<eos> You have something these women want, they have something you want.<eos> Exactly.<eos> It's quid pro quo.<eos> Let's pretend I am a scientist and I do want a grant... really bad.<eos> What would I have to do?<eos> Would I have less dignity than a field mouse?<eos> Oh, good Lord, no.<eos> I'm not a monster.<eos> I would just...
My eyes! Put that thing away.<eos> Weaver is, uh, it... he's just right.<eos> What's your favorite position?<eos> Have you tried a Moroccan mustache?<eos> Oh, I don't think so.<eos> What is that?<eos> Oh. It's like a Moroccan cigar, except you don't use as much upper body strength.<eos> A reverse bat cave is my favorite.<eos> - I love a King Henry.<eos> - Yeah, you would.
It that a joke?<eos> I'm being quite serious.<eos> What is it?<eos> It appears Neal marked his days trapped on this island.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Look here.<eos> Neal stopped counting.<eos> 'Cause he got off the island.<eos> He was here longer.<eos> Then why would he...
It's in the manuscript.<eos> A trained policeman would never do such a thing.<eos> I don't care.<eos> I'm sorry, I have to stop you.<eos> Uh, a real coroner would simply not handle the body in such a...<eos> - Hey, would you just mind your business?<eos> - I'm just trying to help.<eos> - Did I ask for your...<eos> - Stop!<eos> Mr. Pendrick, a real coroner would simply not
I tried living on my own for a little bit, but it didn't work out.<eos> And when was that?<eos> 7 years ago.<eos> It was an SRO.<eos> Full of rejects and roaches.<eos> And that's why you moved back home?<eos> I like living in a house better.<eos> Is that a crime?<eos> You like having a backyard?<eos> Who wouldn't?
You rode on the ferris wheel.<eos> You ready to go home?<eos> No. Mom, I really want to go and see Deacon perform tonight.<eos> But Peggy said, "no," because she's a...<eos> Okay. Well, I thought Deacon was playing tomorrow, y'all.<eos> I mean, there must have been a change of plans 'cause it's happening, like, soon.<eos> That was so unfair.<eos> Tell me that you have a name.<eos> - All I asked you for was one thing, and you can't even do that?<eos> I wouldn't.
Second shelf.<eos> The box. Bring it over.<eos> Did they get it?<eos> It's empty.<eos> 16th century Druidic scripture.<eos> What was in it?<eos> Thracian Phiale.<eos> A ancient relic, allegedly protected by warlocks after Cromwell's conquest of Britain.<eos> Why would someone want something like that?<eos> You wouldn't.
Hey. You're up early.<eos> Yup. Crack of dawn.<eos> But, shh, Dawn is still sleeping.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Good morning.<eos> Uh, hey, Jenny, do you have any idea how to get tear stains out of pillows?<eos> It's certainly not more tears, because I tried that.<eos> Have you tried spraying some desperate cry for attention on it?<eos> You want some coffee?<eos> Why, yes, I would.
You'll find that out later.<eos> No way, it must be great being a princess.<eos> Yeah, for the most part.<eos> What's not so great are the pervy dads who are trying to cop a feel.<eos> The other day I was like,<eos> "Do that again, you're gonna find out where else my glass slipper fits."<eos> Is it weird that that turns me on?<eos> Is it weird that's why I told you?<eos> So, hey, would you girls like a little more champagne?<eos> Oh, I would!
Where did you first have sex?<eos> - It's not about...<eos> - Where?<eos> - My studio, if you have to...<eos> - How about here?<eos> - Did you...<eos> - Stop.<eos> - Did you? - No. Okay?<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because I wouldn't.
You blackmailed her?<eos> Yeah!<eos> Let's get something big!<eos> I have to go to the teachers' office.<eos> Eat lunch without me.<eos> What the heck?<eos> So annoying.<eos> Cha Eun Sang has her hands on Chan Young now?<eos> - Just break up!<eos> - Why would we?
Well, I just hope this guy doesn't have any more targets.<eos> If this is rage and addiction... he's not done.<eos> I'm just saying, you could have called me, Dad.<eos> Going straight to my boss?<eos> Oh, and her.<eos> I mean, how do you think this makes me look?<eos> Because why?<eos> Because you have a hunch?<eos> And what would you have said if I'd called?<eos> I'd...
I won't be an accomplice to grand larceny.<eos> I am not confirming or denying a thing.<eos> But there's a really high window in the storage room and if you climb up...<eos> La la la la la, I'm not listening!<eos> I love Barney, but I'm not going to jail for him.<eos> What?<eos> Really?<eos> Why not?<eos> I'd go to jail for you.<eos> No, you wouldn't.

Oh, mother.<eos> Are you sure you're not up to coming by for Christmas tomorrow?<eos> I know Freddie would love to see you.<eos> No, he wouldn't.
He got passing grades.<eos> He hoped one day to become an architect, like his father.<eos> But that dream is gone.<eos> Snuffed out because like so many typical teenagers,<eos> Parker decided to try something that he saw on TV.<eos> - On television, a falling Addy machine doesn't seem like it would hurt.<eos> In fact, it seems almost funny, but...<eos> Parker tragically discovered that life is not always like it is on TV.<eos> Would anyone care to share a few words?<eos> I would.
Ladies and gentlemen, can I have your attention, please?<eos> Sorry to interrupt your breakfast.<eos> Er... it seems that Olly Fisher is unwell.<eos> It's his recurring condition, but he is in the safest hands.<eos> I want to reassure you he's on his way to hospital and he's gonna be absolutely OK.<eos> He's going for a check-up.<eos> Dr Cogan, he is still conscious, isn't he?<eos> He's fully conscious, Norma, yes.<eos> And he wouldn't want any of us worrying, now.<eos> Would he?
Your inbox in gonna be full.<eos> You're an attractive woman, Barb.<eos> You just gotta have a little more-- A little more confidence in yourself.<eos> -Okay, I think I'm gonna go now.<eos> -Yeah.<eos> I should go because....<eos> Thank you so much for the half a beer and I'll see you at practice.<eos> Sure.<eos> If you did know me and you saw that ad, would you call?<eos> Yeah. I would.
Well, you do now.<eos> I was just trying to help.<eos> You always are.<eos> Maybe it was healthy to see her.<eos> Maybe it'll help you get on with your life.<eos> Or maybe, just once, you could have, one time, just minded your own business, Ma.<eos> Maybe that could have happened.<eos> Look, I have Costco today, okay?<eos> I would appreciate it very much if we could just drive in silence until we get to Texas.<eos> I would...
Yes, absolutely.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here you go.<eos> Race number four.<eos> Six furlongs. Yes, sir.<eos> I see.<eos> My bay the girl breezed this morning...<eos> I was wondering if your guy Jenkins would like to ride him.<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> We sure as hell would, sir.
I think I might be a lesbian.<eos> You don't have any problem with that, right?<eos> No.<eos> Well, I got waxed for the very first time, you know, down there.<eos> At the end of the day, I went with the Brazilian.<eos> And, God, I hope I didn't make a mistake.<eos> I just want everything to be pretty.<eos> Would you like...<eos> Would you like me to take a look?<eos> Would you?
- Ballet. - Oh, at the ballet.<eos> - Were you alone? - Yes.<eos> - Did anyone see you or recognize you?<eos> - Why would anyone recognize me?<eos> Sometimes you see people, you talk to someone. They might remember.<eos> - Remember what?<eos> - Remember you.<eos> You would have an alibi, which means you didn't kill Christine Stanford.<eos> Kill Christine? Oh. I could...<eos> I would never...
Right.<eos> God.<eos> What's this?<eos> Your human sacrifice.<eos> Rip my heart out and eat it.<eos> I am yours.<eos> Maybe I should sleep downstairs tonight.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> Yes.<eos> I would.
- Shh.<eos> - It's not deep.<eos> - I thought they were going to kill me.<eos> They thought so, too.<eos> He hated me, the man who hit me.<eos> I saw it in his eyes.<eos> Hated me.<eos> He never met me before, but he wanted to hurt me.<eos> - Of course he did.<eos> - Why? Why would a stranger--
What kind do you want to be?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The good kind.<eos> Most kings grew up as princes.<eos> They spend their whole lives preparing for the crown.<eos> I was raised to be Lord of Winterfell.<eos> I was raised to be a proper little lady, to play the harp and dance the latest steps and recite Valyrian poetry.<eos> I'd like to hear you play the harp.<eos> No.<eos> No, you would not.
Gotta be somewhere.<eos> So do you want to yell at me again?<eos> No.<eos> I... I wanted to say I'm sorry.<eos> You're right.<eos> I was a cock.<eos> You're not getting back in my pants, if that's what you think.<eos> It's not what I want.<eos> Charmed, I'm sure.<eos> Nah... I would.
I should try that.<eos> Why are you nervous?<eos> I know, you know, it's the end of the semester and I also know there's budgetary issues. And that you have to let a few professors go. And so when I got the note in my box,<eos> I think I just assumed the worst. Would you be afraid to get fired if your job was to clean the floor at one of those coin-operated jack-off booths?<eos> You know, where you're the one holding the mop.<eos> Fired from a jack-off booth?<eos> Where the truckers go and masturbate. They're all along the interstate.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I know what you're talking about. Well? Would you?<eos> No. I would not.
She sent that to you on purpose?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You know what this is?<eos> It's 'eau de commitment", OK.<eos> I have the stink of un-attainability on me and these women are just coming out of the woodwork.<eos> You're a free man.<eos> I thought Sandy left things kinda open?<eos> Well, actually, I told Sandy that I would be here when she gets back.<eos> So I would like to be the kind of guy that sticks to his word.<eos> Yeah, we all would, man.
What?<eos> So I've burned my bridges with VR, and now you're telling me I'm no better off than I was before?<eos> Look, talk me through what you heard when Doyle was inside the van.<eos> I told you what I heard.<eos> You mean did he shout, "Argh, my chest hurts?<eos> , I think I'm dying"?<eos> What if I'd opened that door ten minutes earlier?<eos> Or even five?<eos> Would it have made a difference?<eos> Well, would it?
Why should he have to suffer and not have a chance to get with this?<eos> All right, I'll do the "right" thing.<eos> Hey, Mel, you didn't have to wait for me out here.<eos> Yeah, I did. I just didn't wanna get started on the whole dinner,<eos> - because--<eos> - What's up?<eos> Well, I'm sorry, but Lennox is not a big fan of us going out together.<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> So you're saying we're gonna have to sneak around?<eos> No, I would never.
- I loved her too.<eos> It's... so stupid, but I loved Alina too.<eos> I would never, ever...<eos> Where'd you get the bruise?<eos> Oh.<eos> Squash.<eos> Henry.<eos> After the fight at the house, back at my dad's place...<eos> I wanted to... go find Alina, explain it to her.<eos> He wouldn't...

They should have served you both.<eos> [ sighs ] that sounds like a technicality.<eos> Empires have been toppled because of technicalities.<eos> This gets us into court.<eos> Let us do this --<eos> If not for your dad, for rock 'n' roll.<eos> First of all, I don't owe my dad anything.<eos> He walked out on me.<eos> And I'm guessing you'd just like To get off the hook for all of this.<eos> Yeah, I would.
Good manners are never a waste, dear.<eos> That's what I thought. Thank you.<eos> Well, I'm sorry to interrupt. It was nice meeting you. See you later.<eos> Bye.<eos> Still think I'm exaggerating?<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> Oh, I know.<eos> I've been so busy, helping Jackie plan the ceremony.<eos> You wouldn't believe how much work is involved.<eos> Oh, I would.
Oh, yes.<eos> We can resume our efforts to get you home.<eos> Peter...<eos> Good night.<eos> Good night, Walter.<eos> Hey, come in.<eos> I hope you don't mind.<eos> I was just in the neighborhood.<eos> Thought I'd stop by to see how you're feeling.<eos> No, why would I?
Duncan.<eos> Four young boys in Colorado are on a trip from hell.<eos> I was born in 1953 at 6:00 in the morning... on...<eos> Can we please go faster?<eos> We got some lunch set up for you up ahead.<eos> Some turkey sandwiches and Diet Double Dew. I Should Have Never Thought Horseback Riding<eos> Would Be Any Better Than Ziplining.<eos> This here waterfall is called Heartbreak Falls.<eos> Would you all like to know why it's called Heartbreak Falls?<eos> I certainly would!
Wow, you even throw shots at her when she's not here.<eos> Shots?<eos> Are you referring to our little mother-daughter back-and-forth?<eos> You know, that little back-and-forth, I think, is sometimes pretty hurtful to Mel.<eos> My, the staff does voice its opinion around here, doesn't it?<eos> Yes, it does, yeah.<eos> And another thing that it's curious about is:<eos> It's been two years since you came to your daughter's house.<eos> And you'd like to know why I'm here?<eos> Yeah, I really would.
I have a suspicion.<eos> That leaves us with an LR-ZK interactive proof system construction based on standard general assumptions.<eos> And we'll have to leave it at that, because I have someone here who wants to question me.<eos> Yep.<eos> Someone ghosted your laptop a few days ago.<eos> Here's the aftereffect. Good.<eos> Can you tell who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you where it was done.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> I would.
Yep.<eos> Someone ghosted your laptop a few days ago.<eos> Here's the aftereffect. Good.<eos> Can you tell who did it?<eos> No, but I can tell you where it was done.<eos> Would you like that?<eos> I would.<eos> This isn't one of those Columbo-like things where you keep me doing things for you, hoping I'll slip up?<eos> Because I'd rather just confess.<eos> I would rather that, too.
General O'Hara.<eos> Just had the pleasure.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Since I saw you?<eos> Let me think.<eos> Well, I have inspected 2,934 toothbrushes, most of which were clean, as the soldiers use their button-brushes for their teeth, to keep their toothbrushes clean for inspections.<eos> So you betrayed me with a battalion!<eos> You want a brandy?<eos> I'll ring down.<eos> Rum and hot water, if you would. Of course.
Can you think of anyone who might want to do harm to your father?<eos> You make money, you make enemies.<eos> (Coughing) If you know...<eos> - Dad. Can you...<eos> - Just...<eos> - Just please try and rest?<eos> - Yeah, I'm good.<eos> (Coughing) Maybe we could step out?<eos> I'm going to need the names of the executives.<eos> Well, they wouldn't...
What?<eos> What kind of wimp doesn't get hot sauce?<eos> Uh, not me.<eos> I always get hot sauce.<eos> I can't believe she forgot to give me hot sauce.<eos> So, you know you're not making many friends down at the boardwalk.<eos> Been following Twitter feeds.<eos> There's a hell of a lot of complaining about some "dick detective who won't quit bugging Chef Lana."<eos> You don't think they'd ban me from the trucks?<eos> I would.
And the inspection?<eos> - What did they say at the inspection?<eos> - They may have said I shouldn't use him.<eos> That you mustn't use him?<eos> Don't say you let Odi drive you here.<eos> - You let Odi drive the car?<eos> - Odi's an excellent driver.<eos> - It could have killed someone.<eos> - "It"?<eos> - Odi would never...
What are you doing here?<eos> Is... is this your new internship?<eos> Dr. Parish agreed to let me shadow her.<eos> I thought, if I go to med school, this will give me a better grasp of forensic pathology.<eos> I've learned so much in just two days.<eos> Sweetie... why wouldn't you tell me?<eos> I guess I was afraid you'd veto it, like maybe you'd think me being here was invading your territory or--<eos> What?<eos> That's crazy.<eos> I wouldn't...
I have to go.<eos> Well, I just don't think it's a big deal.<eos> I mean, how many people read the "weekly..."<eos> - "Saver"?<eos> - "Saver," anyway?<eos> 22,000... ish.<eos> My company adver-- used to advertise with that newspaper.<eos> And how am I angry and unlikable?<eos> Can I take this one?<eos> I wouldn't.
And we still don't know who killed Fred.<eos> Actually, I may have a lead on that.<eos> Epthelials under Fred's nails belonged to one of the Hicks brothers.<eos> Fred attacked me.<eos> Look, that's how I got these.<eos> That's why you're reluctant to give us your DNA.<eos> You were afraid we were gonna connect you to Fred.<eos> Like I told you, he attacked me.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Dwayne.<eos> I really would.
I think I do, too.<eos> Oh.<eos> Okay.<eos> Wait.<eos> What?<eos> But why?<eos> Why can't you do the surgery?<eos> Uh, the chief of surgery, Ellis Grey, will be doing the... it.<eos> Uh, I mean, I can.<eos> I would.
Mr. Sandow is facing multiple felony charges and has means to flee.<eos> Mr. Sandow has no criminal record and is the custodial parent of a teenage son.<eos> Who doesn't live at home.<eos> Your honor, Sandow is a long-term serial predator.<eos> All right, Mr. Cutter, bail is denied.<eos> Defendant remanded to Rikers.<eos> Dad, dad, I'll get you out.<eos> After all I've done for you, you and your girlfriend turn against me.<eos> What?<eos> No, I'd never--
Yeah, she thinks she is, but at that age what difference does it make?<eos> I mean, what kind of sex is she having, she's in her forties.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Right.<eos> Still...<eos> Still?<eos> Who cares?<eos> Right.<eos> I don't care.<eos> No one in their right mind would.
And the inspection?<eos> - What did they say at the inspection?<eos> - They may have said I shouldn't use him.<eos> That you mustn't use him?<eos> Don't say you let Odi drive you here.<eos> - You let Odi drive the car?<eos> - Odi's an excellent driver.<eos> - It could have killed someone.<eos> - "It"?<eos> - Odi would never...
Will you?<eos> I said I would.<eos> Then I imagine, if you do that, then the police are going to want to taito Ben.<eos> I know that, so...<eos> Are you sure this is something you want me to say now?<eos> If I give the police an excuse to blame this on our children, they might just do that.<eos> Why don't we just let this play itself out, see how it goes.<eos> Do you want Ben to go to prison for something he didn't do?<eos> He wouldn't last two minutes in prison.<eos> Oh, and Dylan would?
- Seitan.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - It's like tofu.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> It's like food, but not.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> Would you like another glass of wine?<eos> Mm. [Snaps fingers]<eos> - Whoo!<eos> - Yes... I would.
And, frankly, I had no idea he harbored such animosity toward me all these years.<eos> He doesn't.<eos> In fact, he intends to provide you with all the tools necessary for your transition to higher court.<eos> He sent you to apologize for him?<eos> No.<eos> But I am apologizing.<eos> You're new in his office, just like the woman I met.<eos> She was quite impressive.<eos> I bet you'd like to be impressive too.<eos> I would.
I'm coming with you.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Son of a bitch!<eos> Lew, thanks for helping.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry about all this, Bobby.<eos> It's devastating what Lobell has done.<eos> I've known him for a long time, and I pegged him as a good guy.<eos> Well, I worked with him for 30 years.<eos> I want to break his neck.<eos> I would, too, son.
My mother?<eos> Looks like I've got a wedding function in the bag.<eos> Fancy running the bar?<eos> How much?<eos> We'll work something out.<eos> You show me the money first and then maybe I'll bite.<eos> You've got that look on your face.<eos> What have you been doing?<eos> Wouldn't you like to know.<eos> No, I wouldn't actually.
And then hating me all the more when they realise I have no use for their treasured rubbish.<eos> No more he and she for me.<eos> I owe it to myself to be fair to Christopher.<eos> He's up in Yorkshire again, seeing Michael.<eos> The move to Gray's Inn has been a success.<eos> He knows his stuff with furniture and pictures.<eos> He'll walk into a saleroom and sniff out what everybody else has missed.<eos> He just knows... everything!<eos> Of course, he wants to make me suffer.<eos> What man wouldn't?
Well, right this way, gentlemen.<eos> I finally make it back.<eos> And believe it or not, they give me a medal.<eos> Come on!<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Never figured out it was me who set the damn thing off in the first place.<eos> Oh, you are the man.<eos> I love this guy.<eos> How much do you love this guy?<eos> Krueger would, too.
We just... we wouldn't want him to get, um, too stimulated.<eos> That's it.<eos> From throwing all our stuff on the floor.<eos> - He's okay.<eos> He's okay, I think.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Um, we just feel it's really important not to put too many boundaries on foster.<eos> - Is that an approach that's...<eos> - yeah, it stifles his creativity.<eos> - Yeah, you wouldn't...
Okay.<eos> But don't get mad.<eos> What?<eos> ! Tommy slept with Lydia?<eos> !<eos> I thought there wasn't any surveillance footage of the victims' offices?<eos> There isn't, but I found a private security camera aimed at the building next to theirs.<eos> Thought I'd see if maybe the killer walked by.<eos> And how would you know if it was the killer?<eos> Probably wouldn't.
- You got it.<eos> Just a, you know, a simple dinner out.<eos> Right.<eos> Out of the house?<eos> Of course. I mean, I can't have my lady cooking on Valentine's Day.<eos> No, you cannot.<eos> And don't go too expensive... st somewhere where, you know, the spoon and the fork are two separate things.<eos> I mean, what was I gonna do, take you to Taco Bell and bowling?<eos> You wouldn't like that.<eos> Would you?
Why?<eos> Because it's like this thing living inside me, telling me what to do, saying I have to kill, not leaving me any choice.<eos> You're not a puppet.<eos> Of course you have a choice.<eos> Actually, I don't.<eos> Come on, Dex.<eos> It's just you.<eos> You're the one who wants the arsonist dead.<eos> And I don't blame you.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Well, say, Friday at eight?<eos> Good for me.<eos> I'll see you then.<eos> Yeah, see you.<eos> So does he know about you?<eos> Know what?<eos> You know.<eos> No, he doesn't.<eos> So don't say anything.<eos> As if I would.
Your business is secrecy, right?<eos> Cover-ups...<eos> plausible deniability.<eos> You probably even know that General in there.<eos> Am I right?<eos> I'm not your enemy, Carlos.<eos> And if the government wants to take charge of this investigation then I'm sure they have a good reason<eos> That wouldn't bother you?<eos> !<eos> Why would it?
Ah, there's Jade.<eos> Jade!<eos> - What's this dark little beverage?<eos> - Soy sauce.<eos> Okay, I'm here... why?<eos> Because you two need to learn to play a husband and wife believably.<eos> What does that have to do with Sushi?<eos> ! Listen, I once did a show where I had to play a man in great pain, so to prepare, I threw myself down a flight of stairs.<eos> You wouldn't believe how many times I hit my head.<eos> - Yeah, we would.

It happens to a lot of guys.<eos> Well, it doesn't happen to me.<eos> It was probably just something you ate.<eos> You know, the body is a real mystery.<eos> Even scientists don't understand the way it works.<eos> I have been eating a lot of soy lately.<eos> If it makes you feel any better, I really picked up the slack in there.<eos> That does not make me feel better.<eos> Would it help if I told you we could barely hear you yelling at your penis in the bathroom?<eos> It would not.
Patrizia's pregnant again.<eos> Our neighbor?<eos> She might not keep it, she's afraid to tell Marcello.<eos> Why?<eos> He doesn't want another kid.<eos> He didn't even want Giada and Michelle.<eos> We'll take 'em all three of 'em.<eos> I want our own kid.<eos> - Do you?<eos> - 'Course, I would.
- Oh, come on.<eos> - Those were his words.<eos> I see no receipt for payment. We assert Mr. Kaswell pre-paid Mr. Rollins his rent in the form of a $34,000 judgment that Mr. Rollins' company owes him.<eos> Come on!<eos> The man's a trespasser!<eos> Simmer down.<eos> Ms. Kaswell, while I find EVK's actions contemptible, I can't justify calling Mr. Kaswell a tenant.<eos> One minute, Your Honor.<eos> We would like to amend Mr. Kaswell's motion.<eos> We would?
One, two...<eos> Damn it.<eos> How would you feel about you and Molly adopting a baby?<eos> It doesn't matter if it comes from her womb or some teen mom in Kentucky, you still gotta raise it.<eos> Well, with adoption you get the exact model you want.<eos> If it was me, I'd get a little Japanese kid.<eos> They're smart, loyal and they don't bring their shoes in the house.<eos> Plus, they'll do your taxes, walk on your back and chauffeur your Green Hornet car.<eos> Are you telling me you wouldn't want to have your own little Kato?<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
But none of that matters now.<eos> I made a mistake.<eos> I hurt you.<eos> And I'm sorry.<eos> I knew it.<eos> Knew what, mama?<eos> Ever since you made friends in fifth grade, you two can't stay mad at each other for more than a couple of days.<eos> You got time to stay for a cup of coffee?<eos> Love one.<eos> Yeah, you would.

Okay.<eos> And how's Alejandro and your son doing?<eos> Alejandro's still not out of the woods yet.<eos> My son- he's holding it together.<eos> And you?<eos> I'm just happy to be working.<eos> - A lot of vans.<eos> - Mm-hmm.<eos> Rick Simms said his smelled like dirt.<eos> These definitely would.
I need fifteen minutes.<eos> Okay, everybody take a break. Nick!<eos> Come over here!<eos> You gotta check this out.<eos> (Laughs) Look at that.<eos> Right? What?<eos> That's...<eos> Right? Nick:<eos> I don't think she'd want you showing me that. Scott:<eos> Oh, she would not.
Shame on you.<eos> Oh, my goodness.<eos> I mean...<eos> Dad?<eos> I don't want to talk about it, Sonny.<eos> Okay.<eos> And I'm pissed at all of you.<eos> That's why I left.<eos> I just want to calm down.<eos> I'd just like a few minutes to myself.
We've been flirty friends for over a year now.<eos> I didn't know... that other thing was on the table.<eos> So are you telling me it's on the table?<eos> You tell me.<eos> Is it on the table?<eos> 'Cause I put it on the table, and you didn't pull up a chair.<eos> Okay. Dallas...<eos> I'd like to go on a date with you.<eos> Would you like to go on a date with me?<eos> Why yes, I would.
Sure.<eos> Hi. I'm Al--<eos> My 14-year-old sister.<eos> Ethan, was it?<eos> Yeah.<eos> And that's my grandpa and his wife Gloria and her son Manny.<eos> Wow. You guys have a big family.<eos> Big family.<eos> She likes him!<eos> Yeah, who wouldn't?
Of course, you were adopted.<eos> I wish.<eos> No, I made some short lists, I had a couple of sleepovers, but I never managed to get in the end-zone.<eos> I don't know what it was.<eos> Not lovable, maybe?<eos> Well.<eos> Listen, I'm really struggling with this form.<eos> But as you know the system, do you think maybe you could...<eos> Absolutely, I know exactly what they want to hear.<eos> I would...
Or rather, you did.<eos> What are you doing, sheriff?<eos> I'm trying to get you to tell me the truth.<eos> There's something you're not telling me about Ray.<eos> N-no, there isn't.<eos> I swear.<eos> Fine.<eos> If that's the case, you're gonna be charged with murdering Ray.<eos> [ Scoffs ] What?<eos> Why would I --
Hi.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I always have breakfast at Ma's house when I do midnights.<eos> This isn't Ma's house.<eos> No, thanks to you, she's crashing on a piece of plywood you call a couch.<eos> Well, I didn't see you step up and help her out when Dad left.<eos> Hey!<eos> Nice manners.<eos> Your mother would be so proud.<eos> No, she wouldn't!
And then he grabbed my shirt and he said if I flirted with his girlfriend, he'd kick my ass.<eos> And who did that to you?<eos> That man.<eos> That full-grown man.<eos> What up, girl?<eos> Did you notice I got my braces off?<eos> Would you say that the Chance family was addicted to illegal sports gambling?<eos> I'd bet my ass on it.<eos> And trust me, honey, that's a bet I'd love to lose.<eos> But I wouldn't.
He's a rock, just like you and me.<eos> Just... just get him through it, all right?<eos> Whatever it takes.<eos> I had your back once, Michael.<eos> Basra.<eos> Kandahar.<eos> You remember.<eos> Yeah, of course I do.<eos> I'll bet you must miss it, in the field?<eos> Who wouldn't?
We know that Coach Burns kept a tight schedule, predictable.<eos> Whoever killed him knew that.<eos> And knew their way around the gym.<eos> Burns was a hard-ass, we all know that.<eos> Maybe he got what was coming to him.<eos> No.<eos> I mean, yeah, Coach is tough.<eos> I mean, sometimes that was hard, but...<eos> I respected him.<eos> I'd never...
You know what I like.<eos> You know what I like.<eos> Oh, geez.<eos> Just go over there and babysit, and let the man get out.<eos> What makes you think he's not out right now?<eos> Uh, you dumped a baby in his arms in the middle of the afternoon at someone else's house?<eos> He deserved it, he dumped him in my arms first.<eos> He and Wife Number One are disgusting!<eos> He's just trying to have sex with her!<eos> Who wouldn't?
!<eos> Hello?<eos> Hello? Hey!<eos> Hey!<eos> Put it on speaker, speaker, speaker.<eos> Hello? back, and I'm prepared to pay for it.<eos> I don't do deals over the phone, Jerry.<eos> Why don't I fly you and your friends to Cowboys training camp, watch a little practice, meet some players, we'll talk a little business.<eos> I can't imagine that my friends would want to... what?<eos> ! Yes, we would!
All right.<eos> Don't come in for like 10 minutes.<eos> Did you give him a key to our apartment?<eos> He's using mine.<eos> Powell Goldman seemed really focused on you last night.<eos> - It's a thing.<eos> - Like in a mentor way.<eos> I mean, it's not like he wants to sleep with me.<eos> To be totally honest, I think he's the kind of guy I've always pictured you being with.<eos> Marnie, he wouldn't.
Till they finish that new highway, we're the last gas till Staten Island.<eos> What's he got in there?<eos> - The truck?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I... fish?<eos> Says fish.<eos> Could be something else.<eos> That come off the ocean, right?<eos> I wouldn't have a clue about that.<eos> Who would?
I got to wash my hair and put my curlers in.<eos> Sit down, sit down.<eos> I was beginning to worry about my uncle.<eos> You seem to have cheered him up.<eos> I cheer everyone up.<eos> I have a knack.<eos> Denise, all the talk from the other girls, it's not true.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> If it was your business, I would like that.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
And if I had been there, he never would have drank that much.<eos> Because he wasn't really a drinker, he was just having a bad day.<eos> Ever since he was a kid, my dad was a really big space buff, and every few years he would apply for this position at NASA.<eos> And he'd just received his latest rejection.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Ellen, your father's death was not an accident.<eos> Of course it was.<eos> Of course it was!<eos> He was...<eos> no, my-my dad would never...
No bridge?<eos> We're gonna have a 6-minute song.<eos> I think we have to have a bridge.<eos> Do you have any orange juice?<eos> I got some vodka.<eos> You think they're still alive?<eos> Hard to say.<eos> I wouldn't want to get in between those two.<eos> Actually...<eos> I would.
'Cause I may move, you know, get out of here.<eos> Gas attacks, explosions--<eos> I was safer in a Russian prison.<eos> Well, if you hadn't been there today, I would be dead.<eos> Actually, I wasn't supposed to be there today.<eos> How could anyone have planned for that?<eos> You weren't the target.<eos> - Who would want you dead?<eos> - In here?<eos> Who wouldn't?
Your mother is now signed up to judge all 22 yuletide events.<eos> That is great.<eos> Tonight I'll take her to the Rammer Jammer and get Wally to tell her all about the new sneeze guards on the salad bar, and then tomorrow night is the tree lighting in town square, so not a second for us to be alone.<eos> Christmas is saved.<eos> Uh-oh, and here we go.<eos> Smiles on.<eos> Hi!<eos> Mom, it is so good to see you.<eos> You remember Lavon.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Why would I do that, Bruce?<eos> We're all family here, aren't we?<eos> I mean, I trusted you.<eos> That is, until you shot your big mouth off about me to your pals.<eos> I didn't say anything.<eos> You wanted privacy;<eos> I gave it to you.<eos> I didn't even know who you really were until today.<eos> I'd like to believe you, Bruce.<eos> I really would.
You were in love with J Cub but he only had eyes for Todd.<eos> I had it all wrong.<eos> J Cub must have followed Todd to the bathroom. To try to have sex with him.<eos> But, Todd turned him down. Didn't he?<eos> Yes.<eos> J Cub was devastated.<eos> And I was there to help pick up the pieces.<eos> But no matter how hard you tried. J Cub was never gonna love you.<eos> And if I couldn't have him.<eos> Nobody would!
I live rent-free in a penthouse in Soho. I do what I want, take what I need, don't answer to anyone.<eos> Except Rosen.<eos> Yeah, I work for Rosen.<eos> Yeah, so you answer to him.<eos> It's a job.<eos> Right, just, uh...<eos> Just punching the clock, huh?<eos> Look, if there's something you want to know, you just ask.<eos> Look, I'm just saying. Most people, if they could do what you do...<eos> Would what?
Right.<eos> Do you know where your dad keeps his money?<eos> Why?<eos> Does he owe you money?<eos> Like for sex?<eos> He just owes me money.<eos> Your hair is so cool,<eos> No one at my school has hair like that.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, the cash would probably in the...
She has a crush on you.<eos> Really?<eos> You know, I was like her.<eos> Yeah?<eos> I was at a convent for six years.<eos> That's where you learned your English?<eos> What happened?<eos> Just another story of misfortune.<eos> It wouldn't interest a passerby like yourself.<eos> Yeah, it would.
- The rest of them stay shut as well.<eos> Of course you're right.<eos> Now what do you want to talk to me about ?<eos> There.<eos> Three minutes ?<eos> Well, either I've saved you nine, or I've talked myself out of a job.<eos> I still think you're cramping my style.<eos> Oh, please. You have no style to cramp.<eos> That lady at the bar keeps looking at me.<eos> As one would something in a museum.
- She's really sick.<eos> - I know.<eos> I'm trying so hard to play along, but I'm terrible at it.<eos> And I-<eos> - I just don't want to ruin her day.<eos> That's the last thing I want to do, so-- bye.<eos> I'll take her home.<eos> - No!<eos> - It would look so nice on you.<eos> - Yes, it would.
And I know he's blaming me that I'm ruining this world, which was supposed to be his.<eos> He might survive this blow, maybe he'll even enjoy it.<eos> It will be another proof that everyone but him is an amateur.<eos> But he'll hate me.<eos> If I'll tell him about this mistake,<eos> I'll be burying our relation for good.<eos> There's no greater betrayal in your father and his principles than what you're asking me to do.<eos> With all of my critique of him, he never looked the other way just because it was convenient.<eos> You know that.<eos> - Yes, but he wouldn't.
So I guess I couldn't have done it.<eos> Our people did find Lee Coleman's epithelial cells on the rope in your supply closet.<eos> Rope burns on your hands and vestiges of your DNA on the rope.<eos> Can you explain that? I didn't kill him.<eos> I'm not crazy.<eos> All right, you just said that as though you know who did kill him. I did?<eos> Yes.<eos> Do you know who killed him?<eos> No.<eos> How would I?
Bottom line -- as long as you're burned, you're not going anywhere.<eos> When you're pursuing someone, it's tempting to focus exclusively on overtaking the other person.<eos> It's often better to force the person you're chasing to go faster than the terrain allows and wait for them to make a mistake.<eos> But even when a chase ends, you can never assume the other person will give up without a fight.<eos> It's over.<eos> It's not over, Michael. One more time.<eos> No.<eos> That was our tie-breaker, Fi.<eos> Best out of five, then. Hate to see you lose again.<eos> Fi! Yes, you would.
My history with your husband.<eos> What history?<eos> We were involved.<eos> Well, this is awkward.<eos> He didn't tell you?<eos> I assumed married people told each other everything.<eos> My marriage has nothing to do with this case.<eos> It does now.<eos> So, Julia Holden agreed to give us a DNA sample but wouldn't say anything else without her lawyer.<eos> Yeah, of course she wouldn't.
I have to work.<eos> Here, on the island, I can work only two months a year, cleaning houses for tourists.<eos> And you too, what's your future here?<eos> I'll take tourists out on the boat.<eos> In summer.<eos> We both have to work, winter too.<eos> And what do I do?<eos> Be alone my whole life?<eos> Stay here with me, wouldn't you like that?<eos> Yes, I would.
So if you love her, take her, find Avery and get out of here before that jackass kills her!<eos> Baby, you know you can do this, right?<eos> I'm gonna take you to Mexico.<eos> And we're, we're gonna get her--<eos> We're gonna her out of foster care, I'm gonna marry you, and what are you gonna do?<eos> You're gonna get clean, baby.<eos> I'm gonna get clean.<eos> But if it turns out that this party's bullshit, what are you gonna do?<eos> I'm gonna kill her.<eos> I would never--
Bodies started turning up.<eos> Ripped to pieces.<eos> Why did no-one do anything, then?<eos> These are homeless people, Connor.<eos> No relatives, no-one to look out for them.<eos> The authorities don't care.<eos> Listen.<eos> If there was a creature, we'd already know about it.<eos> How?<eos> We just would.
But you already know that.<eos> We're already familiar with Alex. How's she involved?<eos> There's a lot she may know about all of this.<eos> Find her.<eos> So...<eos> Alex?<eos> Okay, calling her an "acquaintance" may have been an understatement.<eos> Neal, you don't owe me anything.<eos> I've lived a life, too. But if there is anything between us, then don't lie to me.<eos> I would never. Yes, you would.
Bring him along.<eos> Sooner or later you have to eat.<eos> Say nine?<eos> Is it too late?<eos> Nine then.<eos> You should have made noodles.<eos> He's going to think we're cavemen.<eos> Don't look at him like that, you'll make him uncomfortable.<eos> He likes it, huh?<eos> Why wouldn't he?
- Are you just gonna play the recordings out loud...<eos> - I don't know, I don't know.<eos> The problem is that no one's gonna come and see it, because it's about gay sex.<eos> So the gays will only come because they want a glimpse of a cock and they'll be... And the straights won't come because, well, it's got nothing to do with their world.<eos> They'll go and see pictures of refugees or murder or rape, but gay sex?<eos> Fuck off.<eos> Fuck it.<eos> Doesn't matter, does it?<eos> I'd come.<eos> - No, you wouldn't. - Yeah, I would.
Do you think he was ever physical with her?<eos> Physical?<eos> Yes, we think the relationship may have been abusive.<eos> He's gonna know that I told you, lieutenant.<eos> He's gonna come;<eos> He's gonna hurt me, too.<eos> Lucy, you had to have seen something.<eos> She had a broken wrist, she had a broken cheek bone.<eos> Would I have to go to court?<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Good hunting.<eos> Dad!<eos> Dad, I have to talk to you.<eos> Scott was running these tests with the transmitter, um...<eos> Yeah.<eos> ...Trying to see if he could block the signals between the Skitters and the Mechs.<eos> Yeah, j-- like a, you know, a jamming signal.<eos> Yeah.<eos> How would -- how would you even know if that worked?<eos> We wouldn't, but...
Condoms?<eos> You got a girlfriend I don't know about?<eos> Me?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Then you're a pretty confident guy.<eos> No.<eos> No no no.<eos> I-I-I wasn't--<eos> - I would never--
One hour.<eos> Executive bar.<eos> Shall I come? No.<eos> No.<eos> Anyone for a drink?<eos> No, thanks.<eos> Looks like it's just you and me, then.<eos> Something like that.<eos> Isaac, want me to type it up?<eos> Would you?
What they couldn't have known was that they had just scheduled the most important game of Dungeons Dragons ever, a game which not only might save a life, but which would forever change the balance between good and Pierce.<eos> Hi.<eos> Hey, Neil, this is gonna be awesome, yo.<eos> So we're just gonna ignore that hate crime, huh?<eos> I'm a dark elf, or a trau.<eos> Shouldn't you be wearing armor or something?<eos> I'm an elf, not a nerd.<eos> So you guys suddenly just wanted to play Dungeons Dragons?<eos> Y-yeah.<eos> W-why wouldn't we?
What exactly?<eos> That's a secret, obviously.<eos> Or would you rather be alone?<eos> Wouldn't you rather be alone? !<eos> Would you miss me... if you weren't with me now?<eos> I came looking for you because I missed you.<eos> Would you miss me if you weren't with me here... but at home or wherever?<eos> I'm here, aren't I?<eos> But what if you weren't... would you miss me then?<eos> Of course I would.
Trains, trees<eos> But even<eos> The sky background<eos> I'm not going cheap<eos> So I pray<eos> God forgive me<eos> Without believing in Him<eos> I pray for the man<eos> Who loved me so much<eos> I'd like
In the end, she wouldn't even let him kill me.<eos> "He's just a boy," she said.<eos> "Please don't hurt him."<eos> So he gave me a nice little scar to remember him by<eos> - and off they went.<eos> - Is she still married to him?<eos> Oh no.<eos> He got himself killed before the wedding... ..And she ended up with his brother, an even more impressive specimen.<eos> She loves him, I'm afraid.<eos> And why wouldn't she?
Gator? Talking.<eos> But I do really wish there was a gator.<eos> Hey, come on, not even as a joke, Lana.<eos> It so wasn't. I said I was sorry.<eos> Tell this wildlife you're sorry when the pipeline blows because we're not there to protect it.<eos> A, all this wildlife can suck it.<eos> Everything out here either wants to eat me or give me malaria.<eos> And B...<eos> No thanks to you, Queen Audrey.<eos> Would you just...? Yeah.
Edith, this is a message for you.<eos> Mrs Drake writes that they've decided to hire a man so they won't be needing you any more.<eos> Is that all she says?<eos> Oh, well, she's very grateful.<eos> Here. She says she and Drake send their thanks to you for giving up so much of your valuable time.<eos> I expect it's rather a relief.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't say that... not entirely.<eos> Has Lady Sybil gone already?<eos> She had a tray at half past six.<eos> She would.
What does it mean?<eos> Bet on me.<eos> Make me some dough and I'll tell you anything you want.<eos> The name of the officer, for example. No.<eos> I told you, I won't go there.<eos> If you want a snitch, look somewhere else.<eos> Ask a Freemason.<eos> If this is revenge for Valencia, the killer will come after you.<eos> You'd better watch out.<eos> No, he'd better.
Sounds like you think Scott's jamming idea might actually work.<eos> Well, he's hopeful.<eos> Hail Mary passes seem to be the order of the day.<eos> Setting gun positions and barricades and coming up with an evacuation plan -- it's a long way from the lecture hall.<eos> Tom, I know you're worried about Hal, but he's smart.<eos> If Weaver's mission isn't right, he'll back off.<eos> Oh, he's 16 and he's hurting and he wants payback.<eos> He's gonna see this through, if he can.<eos> How can you be sure?<eos> Because I would.
But I don't think that anyone expects you to be anything but you.<eos> I'm not -- I'm not so sure about that.<eos> You see, there was -- there was kind of a reason why I kept a low profile all these years.<eos> I have some issues.<eos> Okay.<eos> You want to talk about them?<eos> No.<eos> But...<eos> Unfortunately, somebody else...<eos> Would.
Very good.<eos> I think someone in here wants to keep Bernie incoherent.<eos> Who?<eos> I'm in charge of all pharmacology, so I'll make sure you'll only get sugar pills.<eos> Dr. Elliot.<eos> He's in charge of medication.<eos> - It must be him.<eos> That doesn't make any sense.<eos> He's the one who put Bethel on the original dose, why would he wanna reverse the process?<eos> He wouldn't.
Hey, this would be great to play with.<eos> If you couldn't fall asleep at night.<eos> What do you think it should do?<eos> How should I know?<eos> I'm only eight.<eos> But since you ask, I'd make it a whole monkey, dress it in a suit, have him eat plastic bananas and then have them come out the other end peeled.<eos> I'd buy that toy.<eos> Brilliant!<eos> And who knows kids' toys better than kids?<eos> Hey, how would you...
- I'm on strike, bro. - I got nothing else to do. - Go with E.<eos> - I do want to focus. - All right. - We'll check with you later, Vin.<eos> - All right, good luck, Turtle. - Thanks.<eos> - You are worried!<eos> I'm curious. You know what? It just came in on my Berry.<eos> - Now I'm worried. - Let me get it printed, okay?<eos> Raphael, I'm gonna need another 10.<eos> What's the worst that could happen?<eos> In your case, your wife files for full custody of the children.<eos> - She would never!
I was about to ask you the same thing--you seem grumps.<eos> - I'm not grumps.<eos> - Who's grumps?<eos> Shawn, I didn't get any sleep last night.<eos> Aren't you gonna say anything about the phone call you made to me?<eos> - It's--it's kind of a huge deal.<eos> - Phone call?<eos> Yes, of course, obviously, it is huge, isn't it?<eos> Does Gus know about this?<eos> Why--why wouldn't he?
Everyone lost people.<eos> We were all the same.<eos> I wasn't a special case.<eos> Kate, are you there?<eos> We have to leave now, if we want to see the speech.<eos> Laura, I'm sorry.<eos> Uh, you're gonna have to go without me.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> Would you...
You got it all wrong.<eos> Lot of money in MMA these days.<eos> I mean, you turn pro, you get a couple of pay-per-view fights.<eos> We're talking about a lot of money.<eos> It's a lot of money, but Jake was not interested in that.<eos> Right? He didn't want his charity to turn into a business.<eos> You guys fought over it, and when it did not go your way, you shot him.<eos> That's crazy!<eos> Look, did I want to go pro?<eos> Sure. Who wouldn't?
He fought the Whistler fire with Craig Hill.<eos> How many times I got to tell you?<eos> Check my damn alibi.<eos> We are.<eos> And it's a good one, Jim.<eos> Consoling dead firefighter's wife.<eos> Ask her.<eos> You didn't like the fact that Craig Hill had a lower test score, but he was hired before you, did you?<eos> No.<eos> Would you?
- Absolutely.<eos> - Cuckoo!<eos> So what's the problem?<eos> You need us.<eos> No, I don't, okay?<eos> I don't want a background check.<eos> I want adventure and excitement.<eos> Look, if it's a choice between mystery and history, I want mystery.<eos> In fact...<eos> Ted, I wouldn't...
Maybe he didn't want to make a move because he doesn't know you like him.<eos> I leaned in.<eos> I leaned for a kiss.<eos> Maybe you had a breath situation. What did you eat?<eos> What had you eaten?<eos> Nothing.<eos> Okay, but sometimes when you don't eat, it's worse, because you start to grind up your feelings.<eos> Then you get stomach breath.<eos> I wouldn't kiss ryan gosling with stomach breath.<eos> - Yes, you would.
Tacos Mi Corazon was having a special offer.<eos> Get free tacos for life ifyou get a tattoo of their logo.<eos> You don't wanna be buried in a Mexican cemetery either.<eos> The joke is on you, because my corpse will be unrecognizable.<eos> Only you would spend hundreds of dollars on a tattoo just to get a free 99-cent food item.<eos> Well, it also affords me the ability to threaten to get food on your clothes every day.<eos> Oh, no, I won't.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> But I could.<eos> But I wouldn't.
To the freakin' weekend!<eos> Yeah!<eos> Whoo!<eos> Oh, ho. Somebody's having fun, right?<eos> Yeah, somebody likes to show up at detective rackets and drink all our booze, even though he's never been a detective. Never will be either. Couldn't be if he wanted to.<eos> Deputy Chief of Patrol Costello.<eos> Yeah, well, you want me to bum-rush him out of here, man?<eos> 'Cause I will.<eos> You ever wanna haul off and punch him in the face?<eos> - I would.
Binoculars, obviously.<eos> I had to travel light to be as quick as possible.<eos> My expedition journal.<eos> My father's father's camera.<eos> A Brief History Of Time, by Stephen Hawking, that my dad used to read to me.<eos> Cell phone.<eos> Fig Newtons, which I love.<eos> The key, obviously.<eos> And my father's message to not stop looking.<eos> And I wouldn't, not ever.
Besides, Jeep's gonna have your car fixed up quick. -Then you're gonna be on your way.<eos> -Good.<eos> Have a seat wherever you want, ma'am.<eos> Specials are on the board.<eos> I already know what I want.<eos> -Okay.<eos> What'll it be?<eos> -l'll have a steak, please.<eos> -How'd you like that cooked?<eos> -Rare, if you would.
I mean, I have, yes.<eos> I've eaten, but I...<eos> Okay, relax.<eos> Please.<eos> - No more appointments.<eos> Is that a bit of the old country I hear in your voice?<eos> - My husband says I sound like an immigrant.<eos> But we're all immigrants, are we not?<eos> Tell me how I can help you.<eos> First of all, sir, I would never...
That usually means we're not gonna...<eos> You know.<eos> Oh, no, we could... We could still fool around.<eos> Really?<eos> Only if you're into it. I mean...<eos> No, I... No, I would love to.<eos> Let me just get the lights.<eos> Okay, you know what? No. It's...<eos> Honey, I'm totally fine if we don't.<eos> No, I just... I would...
-Hey, watch your mouth.<eos> I get to act crazy and be drunk 'cause I raised you your whole life.<eos> And then he comes around and tells me that he's gonna marry my daughter and take her to Timbuktu.<eos> Oh, yeah, and not bring in a paycheck.<eos> He's gonna be living off of your lawyer checks while he sits around just doing whatever he does.<eos> Are you saying that your daughter is too good for my son?<eos> No.<eos> No, I'm not.<eos> But I am asking you, Marcus, straight up, man to man, would you respect a man who doesn't pull his own weight?<eos> No, sir, I wouldn't.
The sad thing is, I could actually use it right now.<eos> - Then here. You can have it.<eos> - No.<eos> Oh, no. Please tell me that's not a ticket.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> Fuck!<eos> Fuck, fuck! Fuck!<eos> What did I do to deserve this chain reaction of shit all the time?<eos> You know, I feel like if I died, no one would even notice.<eos> Well, I would.
Not at all?<eos> Well, everybody's concerned.<eos> Is something going on?<eos> You can tell me.<eos> There's just really nothing to tell.<eos> Have you been seeing someone?<eos> Oh god no, no, no, no, no, no.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I'm married.<eos> I would never.
Ten seasons.<eos> First two seasons... No, three seasons I was here, I was walking in the same direction, trying to reach the edge of the preserve.<eos> Let me tell you something, there ain't no edge of the preserve.<eos> Maybe you and your friend wanna tell me about that ship?<eos> Let's see.<eos> That's a brilliant idea.<eos> Brilliant.<eos> The whole time I've been here, it never occurred to me to commandeer the alien spacecraft.<eos> But I wouldn't know how to fly it.<eos> He would.
I just don't know how to get people to notice me.<eos> I'm actually not that bad of an actress, you know not that acting has anything to do with getting roles here.<eos> Then why stay?<eos> Why put yourself through constant humiliation when you could go back to your hometown and be homecoming queen again, be a 10?<eos> Because I told everybody back home I was gonna make something of myself that someday they'd be able to say, "I knew her when..."<eos> If I return now, I return a failure.<eos> Then let's try this again, shall we?<eos> Tell me what you don't like about yourself, Miss Hayes.<eos> LIZ: I am so happy that we are doing a simple mammoplasty today and nothing is going to go wrong. Right, Christian?<eos> CHRISTIAN: Why would it?
You know it.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> But not everything true needs to be announced to the worlds on television!<eos> I know, I just did it!<eos> I didn't know what I was saying!<eos> It just happened.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> - You'd do it again?<eos> - Yes, I would!
Russell is gone.<eos> Thank God for small favors.<eos> Eric as well.<eos> -What?<eos> -l ended him.<eos> Why?<eos> He tasted you.<eos> He knew what you are.<eos> Even if we are to go our separate ways, I will make sure that you are safe.<eos> -But Eric would never--
I know the enormity of this, and I am asking you to let me swim<eos> - No<eos> - No<eos> - Jim.<eos> We can't let you mate.<eos> - You can.<eos> The question is: will you?<eos> Has this been your plan all along?<eos> I thought you wanted to live.<eos> Why would ...
We'll have a location in two minutes.<eos> Roland Pike has dodged the Marshals Service, the FBI, and the mob for over five years.<eos> He's already dumped the phone.<eos> Doesn't bother you, working for spics?<eos> See, the spics we got here, they're mostly wetbacks with no papers.<eos> They pick lettuce all day, live like 30-deep in some rat-piss apartment or else, like, you know, homemade tents out by the highway. Point is, they ain't running shit.<eos> - No.<eos> - "No" what?<eos> No, it doesn't bother me.<eos> Yeah, well, it would me.
- It's right there.<eos> Just look for the aquarium.<eos> Oh, look, it's Professor Vocabulary.<eos> Let me explain something to you, tough girl.<eos> Smith didn't walk over to you because he thought you looked classy.<eos> He walked over because he saw your butt, boobs and face, in that order.<eos> And no man in the history of the universe has ever said,<eos> "You know, I met this really cool, stone-cold hottie, but I don't want to get naked and do awful things to her because she doesn't know about politics."<eos> Do you really think he wants to do awful things to me?<eos> - Who wouldn't?
"I hear your heart beating. Mine beating with yours as one.<eos> "I breathe when you breathe.<eos> "Breath to breath, heartbeat to heartbeat."<eos> You believe Martin wrote these letters to me?<eos> Yeah, that imagery.<eos> You know, syntax, the emotion.<eos> So you're saying he was in love with me?<eos> I wasn't sure whether to tell you. But I figured that if I was him, I wouldn't want my fear to prevent you from knowing how I felt.<eos> But he never said anything.<eos> But Martin wouldn't, would he?
- Have you got any warm clothing?<eos> - What does it matter if we're cold?<eos> We have to know what she's up to.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Um...<eos> There should be some stuff down there, have a look.<eos> I want the other life... you know, where we're happy and settled and about to have a baby.<eos> But don't you wonder, if that life is real, then why would we give up all this?<eos> Why would anyone?
- where anything we do to remove it...<eos> - Will kill me.<eos> Audrey, you're not even listening to them.<eos> It doesn't make sense.<eos> I just want one more month.<eos> I'm not gonna risk dying before that.<eos> One more month?<eos> Our daughter is getting married, in a month.<eos> And I would like to see her do that.<eos> I would...
I'll make do.<eos> Let me have it.<eos> I ain't no nun.<eos> Bend over.<eos> Drop your pants and get over my lap.<eos> All you have to do is walk away.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> She's respecting her elders.<eos> See Troy? Did you think I was a hypocrite?<eos> That I wouldn't really...
Must've been quite a mess.<eos> I don't think that's a coincidence.<eos> The stuff that got 'em sick came From your pastry box.<eos> What's the deal, bud? Hmm?<eos> You get tired of the guys in the station Stealing your food, so you thought<eos> You'd lace a few of your goodies with some shigella,<eos> Teach 'em a lesson?<eos> No.<eos> Yes, the guys steal my food, Although those lowlifes would never admit it. But, look,<eos> I would never...
So do you want to tell us about this?<eos> It's a family heirloom.<eos> Right.<eos> Why did MacPherson want it?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Pete, the--the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch.<eos> Yeah, the wiring on the vest matches the wiring on the switch.<eos> That has nothing to do with the vest.<eos> Oh, of course we believe you.<eos> Yeah, right. Why wouldn't we?
I've been through it.<eos> Marshall's been through it.<eos> A lot. And it never gets easier.<eos> That's nice to hear, huh?<eos> So what do I have to look forward to, more of this?<eos> Huh? Feeling like a fat, stupid, ugly nothing?<eos> Dom, come on.<eos> No, hey, everything my uncle said is true.<eos> Who'd want me unless I paid, right?<eos> And who would?
Uh, y-yes, Commander, actually there is something that we could use your help with.<eos> Isn't that right, Lieutenant? Great.<eos> How are you at, "ho, ho, ho"?<eos> Chief Johnson, you can now hear the 911 calls made during Shariq's attack on his son.<eos> Oh, I thought you dropped those off at the sound lab yesterday.<eos> I did, but since they won't get to it till tomorrow, I thought maybe your team could sort it out.<eos> First, I combined the background audio from all the calls to our 911 operators during the attack.<eos> Then I added the sound portion of the film one of our witnesses took with his cellphone, after which I managed to cobble together the argument between Armand and his father. Merry Christmas.<eos> Would you like to hear it?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Well, At's what I'm saying. What if you had elephant man's knob?<eos> Yeah, but it didn't work like that, did it?<eos> That's the thing.<eos> They said he had the body of an elephant, But that's the only thing That wasn't of an elephant's standard.<eos> - ( guffaws )<eos> - His knob was normal. Whereas with this fella, it's the other way round.<eos> Everything normal, took the pants off,<eos> "oh wow, what's going on here?"<eos> But why would you ever take his pants off?<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
== Sync, corrected by jacobian for HDBits.org== Did you hear about the accident at the bio lab?<eos> No. What happened?<eos> They were injecting rats with radioactive isotopes and one of the techs got bit.<eos> Did he get superpowers?<eos> No, he got five stitches and a tetanus shot.<eos> Well, that's disappointing.<eos> Why?<eos> Well, you get bit by a radioactive animal in a lab, you kind of want to turn into a superhero.<eos> Yeah, but who'd want to become Rat-Man?<eos> Who wouldn't?
Susan, you want to get some dinner?<eos> You're asking me to dinner?<eos> Yeah, seeing you in action, you know, you doing what you do, it's, um...<eos> It's interesting to me.<eos> I'd like to know more.<eos> You would?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> Yeah, but, um, I don't think you really would.<eos> But it's, it's sweet of you to say.<eos> Uh, no, I... I, I actually would.
Okay, he's this big.<eos> He has scales.<eos> Oh, he has scales.<eos> Well, one of the places we saw, has a great playroom that I'm sure Marvin would love.<eos> You're still thinking about that one?<eos> What smell?<eos> You know, that funky smell. It's kind of hard to describe.<eos> It's like canned soup or something.<eos> Buddy, you want to live in a place that smells like broccoli soup? Nuh-uh.<eos> Yeah, who would?
No, no.<eos> Yeah.<eos> No, uh, Chloe said she wanted you all to herself tonight.<eos> Yeah, yeah, she said something about wanting to catch the early show at the Clova.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah, that's what I said.<eos> Well, we could see a movie any night.<eos> What are you doing right there?<eos> What, you don't want to see a movie with your fiancée?<eos> He'd better!
Inlaid ivory.<eos> Part of that Pasadena hit.<eos> You got a good eye.<eos> I know.<eos> Everything all right with you?<eos> Sure.<eos> I heard you had a run-in with a toy.<eos> Y-you know, you should go to that place and rip it off.<eos> I mean, t-they'd never suspect a thing.<eos> I wouldn't.
- Like that?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It was gonna be awesome, babe.<eos> That's kinda cool.<eos> Would you have got mad at me?<eos> I would have thought that that was really romantic of you and really thoughtful and adorable, and...<eos> Would it have gotten me laid?<eos> For sure.<eos> I would like us to get married.<eos> - You would?
We're undercover. We're not here to order food.<eos> These earpieces are not for personal conversations.<eos> Remind me to tell you what Sarah thought of your fight.<eos> Sarah? You talked to Sarah?<eos> What did Sarah say? Whoa, whoa.<eos> What are you so nervous about?<eos> I did all the talking.<eos> Kept it simple and explained to her that by not believing in you she betrayed your trust and your family.<eos> - Your words, not mine. - Morgan...<eos> Morgan, why would you...?
You mean an ex-actress?<eos> Ex-porn slut.<eos> Just say it in plain English.<eos> No one has to know about what you were doing before.<eos> I mean, past is past, and I won't tell anyone.<eos> Will you?<eos> You're sweet.<eos> No so much.<eos> I think you'd make a good sister.<eos> Well, so would you.
I overate.<eos> You tire me out.<eos> You exhaust me.<eos> One evening with you is like 10 years with someone else.<eos> I'm completely... you see?<eos> - You left your suit on? - Yeah.<eos> - It looks good on you.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Don't hold it against my father and sister.<eos> I wouldn't.
Get to know a guy pretty well, I guess, huh?<eos> Yeah. Yeah, we get along good.<eos> Hell, good enough to lend him $90,000, was it?<eos> - Well, what does that matter?<eos> - Oh, it doesn't.<eos> Not to me, but the prosecution's gonna claim that Vinnie burned down his place, you know, for the insurance because he owed so much.<eos> Right, right, right.<eos> And I need the jury to know that the two of you were good friends.<eos> So Vinnie wouldn't worry about what he owed you.<eos> Yeah, yeah. He wouldn't.
Hey, Jamie, your niece just said that she wants to be a cop and carry on the family tradition.<eos> What do you think, Uncle Jamie?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> It's a commitment.<eos> It's not just a job.<eos> It's your whole life.<eos> And you're not just a cop, you're a Reagan.<eos> In a lot of ways, I didn't know what I was getting into.<eos> But I wouldn't trade it.<eos> None of us would, kid.
- Have you seen Danburry?<eos> I'm afraid not, sir.<eos> - I don't like him, Wellington.<eos> - I understand sir.<eos> I don't like the way he looks at my precious daughter.<eos> I want to grab hold of that boys penis. Hold it tight.<eos> And then yank it from his groin.<eos> And then I want to bend him over... And insert aforementioned severed penis right up his backside!<eos> I'll teach him never to lay a finger on my angel.<eos> It certainly would, sir.
That so?<eos> Did I do som'thin' wrong?<eos> Yeah, a big one too!<eos> Can't you see why Hani has studied so desperately?<eos> - You're just a moron!<eos> You stupid...<eos> Hey, Hani... you still lik' Seung-Jo... huh? Aft'r all that dissing he's given to ya, you still have it fo' him?<eos> So, that's lik' ya like that kinda pretty boy styl'?<eos> No!<eos> Why would I?
I can't even ask?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Don't ask.<eos> It pisses me off.<eos> Why did you come here?<eos> Why are you following me around and bothering me?<eos> What are your true intentions?<eos> You know.<eos> I don't.<eos> How would I?
Let's get out of here.<eos> For the record, I am so pissed off for you, right now.<eos> Shut the up, Julie.<eos> Okay.<eos> We're still going to the after-party, right?<eos> I'm not sure there's going to be much of a party.<eos> I think a third of the band just went "poom."<eos> Yeah, cool bands never go to their own after-parties.<eos> Just the desperate people trying to rub elbows with the label guys.<eos> Then why would we...
Definitely.<eos> Most definitely.<eos> Hey, Joni, did you tell Paul about your graduation speech?<eos> No, she didn't tell me.<eos> It was so full of wisdom and hope.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey, go get it.<eos> You know, I bet Paul would like to hear it.<eos> No, Mom, I'm sure he wouldn't.<eos> No, no, no, sure he would.
- I couldn't.<eos> - That's not an answer.<eos> Why is this so important to you all of a sudden?<eos> Because I want to remember what you say right now.<eos> For the love of...<eos> I was a coward.<eos> I was weak. I wouldn't kill a dragon.<eos> You said "wouldn't".<eos> Whatever!<eos> I wouldn't!
I'll get some stuff and drop off my attaché case.<eos> As you wish, Hubert.<eos> I'll start investigating on my own.<eos> Oh, that's a pity.<eos> We should stick together. Come see the hotel, at least?<eos> Τhat's kind of you, but I'd rather get to work.<eos> Look, this is ridiculous.<eos> Τhere's a pool and everything.<eos> We'll get cracking on it this afternoon. And voilà, no?<eos> No, thanks, I'd rather not.
You're going to be the first person I thank... in my Newberry Award speech.<eos> It's an award for children's books. No, I know what a Newberry Award is.<eos> Are you still gonna make them talk? Mm-hmm.<eos> They're gonna be a typical New York family... except they live in the park, and they're raccoons.<eos> Okay. Your turn.<eos> I think the father is gonna be in advertising.<eos> Instead of making stuff up... why couldn't you write about the real raccoons?<eos> Because it's a children's book, not a nature book.<eos> Well, I'd probably like the nature book better.<eos> Yeah, you probably would.
We have your confession.<eos> Oh, you do?<eos> - And on tape.<eos> See, in our profession we consider that a "slam dunk"<eos> Oh, really?<eos> I dont think so.<eos> Lets think back.<eos> What did I say?<eos> That I wanted to kill Clarence Darby?<eos> Yeah, sure, what father wouldn't?
What thing?<eos> - That existential crisis spin-out thing that never leads you anywhere.<eos> Hey, maybe you should have a drink.<eos> I've had three.<eos> - Hey, slow down everybody.<eos> Slow down!<eos> Thursday's my day to do this childcare swap thing..<eos> I hate Thursdays.<eos> - Abby, you'd tell me if you thought I was making a mistake, right?<eos> I would.
That's right.<eos> Kim always talks about that.<eos> You were like crazy fat.<eos> - 400 pounds.<eos> That's like a car.<eos> - It's like a golf cart.<eos> I bet you could do a mean cannonball back in the day.<eos> I once displaced two feet of water out of a pool at a child's birthday party.<eos> What did the child do, like, freak out?<eos> - I would.
I'm pretty sure you said 6:00.<eos> Pretty sure I said 8:00.<eos> Oh,maybe you're right.<eos> Either way,you should have called.<eos> We were worried sick about you.<eos> Weren't we,Mr. Deeds?<eos> Yes,we were.<eos> Would you like an apology?<eos> Yes,I would.<eos> I would,too.
Oh,she's,uh,she's watching the video again with scotty.<eos> Wait,wait,wait,wait,wait,wait.<eos> Before we have cake,there's actually,uh,one more present.<eos> -Oh,god.<eos> -It's something for mom.<eos> It's--robert and I,um,spoke with trish,and she said that it would be okay if we were in the delivery room for the birth.<eos> And we asked her if it would be okay if you were there,too. Oh,kitty.<eos> And she said that it would be fine.<eos> So,um,we--we really want you to be there, and I can't imagine anything that would mean more to me.<eos> So,um... would you? Of course.
Wow, that must be nice.<eos> But I can't accept it.<eos> Why not? What's the point of success if you can't share it with the people you love?<eos> Because the people that you love may not be able to pay you back, and then you stop loving them.<eos> Then it's not a loan, it's a gift.<eos> - Don't you have a birthday coming up?<eos> - And so do you.<eos> And I'm going to feel real crappy when you unwrap your lavender bath beads.<eos> Come on, Lynette. You can't tell me this money won't take the pressure off.<eos> It would.
Did you not forget something?<eos> What would I have forgotten?<eos> To tell me you were leaving.<eos> Lord Arathorn needs our help.<eos> Yet whether he rides to Rivendell or leads the Dúnedain to safety elsewhere, you will not stay.<eos> I cannot.<eos> I see that now.<eos> I go to free my heart of him.<eos> Would you not welcome such news?<eos> Indeed I would.
I've been praying I was wrong.<eos> All of her jewelry, Lucian.<eos> Your grandmother's emeralds.<eos> There's a thief in the house.<eos> Would a thief leave this?<eos> What have you been praying you were wrong about?<eos> Mother, tell me.<eos> The boy that she had been seen with in the bayou.<eos> What boy?<eos> - My Abby would never...
Come here.<eos> It's my fate.<eos> There's nothing I can do.<eos> Wish I could tell ya I found every hole and patched it, but no such thing as perfect security.<eos> Perfect, no.<eos> But is it sufficient?<eos> The damn thing is tricky.<eos> Can't know for sure, not really.<eos> - Who would know?<eos> - He would.
Maybe she felt embarrassed.<eos> A healer taking medication for an emotional disorder?<eos> It went against everything she believed in.<eos> New York is gonna be so strange without her now.<eos> - You're still going?<eos> On one of our early dates, Olivia took me to The Cloisters.<eos> She loved the architecture there and the history.<eos> It's where we fell in love.<eos> Spreading her ashes there is what she'd want me to do.<eos> Like hell she would.
Listen.<eos> Really listen.<eos> What do you hear?<eos> That's amazing.<eos> The acoustics up here are incredible.<eos> It's like there's some perfect echo point right here.<eos> Have you completely lost your mind?<eos> That could have really hurt!<eos> No, it...<eos> No, it wouldn't, Clark.
I'm his sister.<eos> I'm Shawna.<eos> You expecting someone about this high,huh?<eos> Well,uh,kinda,yeah.<eos> Still want to do this?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Let's roll.<eos> Even though you know about me,you'd still let me go out with Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
That was the first time any of us knew anything about it.<eos> You see,my brother was afraid that if we knew about it, we wouldn't love him anymore.<eos> So that is why I am glad that you have chosen to talk to somebody.<eos> And if you ever need to talk to anybody about this,you can talk to me.<eos> You can talk to Grace.<eos> No judgment ever.<eos> I promise.<eos> Even though you know about me, you'd still let me go out with Grace?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
It's like I feel so awake and alive.<eos> That must mean it was the right thing, right?<eos> Oh, definitely.<eos> I mean, I know he's been cheating on me for months, and we barely talk.<eos> We definitely don't have sex.<eos> He called this morning, he wants me to, uh, go to his apartment and pick up my stuff.<eos> I should do that.<eos> Get it over with.<eos> Yeah. Um, do you want me to come with you?<eos> Would you?
And why is that?<eos> Because, when I look at that pool table, I keep seeing you on it, and then I can't think about anything else.<eos> What do you say we get outta here?<eos> And go where?<eos> Well, we'll sneak out the back and shift and run and play.<eos> Do it out under the sun.<eos> I would love to, but if I left work, my boss would kill me.<eos> Don't you go and slap me with a harassment suit for this, but if you don't go out back right now and take off all your clothes, I will fire you.<eos> Well, we wouldn't want that.<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Stop.<eos> That's an order from the president!<eos> The voice of the people must be heard.<eos> I am the president!<eos> God bless America.<eos> God bless me.<eos> I have the feeling I'm not gonna have to worry about that murder charge.<eos> Would have been an interesting trial, though.<eos> Wanna stick around for a while?<eos> Lois and I would...
Nobody wants me,betty.<eos> Nobody's called.<eos> And I gave such a good interview at "vogue.<eos> " marc,you are so talented.<eos> Don't!<eos> My flesh rots where you touch it.<eos> It's just that I wanted it so much.<eos> And... I worked so hard.<eos> And I would've made the best junior editor "vogue" has ever seen.<eos> Yeah. You would.
- No, Ray.<eos> I'm worried about the list.<eos> - What list?<eos> Joe says there's a list of everybody getting fired.<eos> He says my name is on it.<eos> What?<eos> Who's they?<eos> Quit worrying about this rumor crap, man.<eos> You want me to go talk to Rhonda so you can calm down?<eos> - Yeah, would you?
would you yes?<eos> I like that.<eos> Ashl's made a commitment not to date in high school.<eos> I don't wa to go out with her.<eos> I just want to marry her and have children.<eos> In that order.<eos> Whoa, okay there, buddy. no no no?<eos> You'reot getting anywhere near her.<eos> I didn't say I was going to. I just- - I wanted to.<eos> but Who wouldn't?
Are you comparing us? No.<eos> I was just saying...<eos> I didn't get sick, okay?<eos> I don't know what you heard. And I don't know what goes on inside your head apart from bad medicine. But you and I got nothing in common.<eos> Yeah. Sorry.<eos> All right.<eos> Dude.<eos> You know, now that he mentions it, you two are kind of similar.<eos> You know, it would be cool if you stopped spreading that around, all right?<eos> I would never.
I almost stayed. My father has a class action firm,<eos> - Allison was a lawyer. And you said that she came here to see you. Is that right?<eos> Yes. We had lunch downtown. She was hoping to get robert and patrick talking again,<eos> What about you?<eos> Did you like her?<eos> Oh, of course. She was perfectly sweet. I'm sure everyone liked allison.<eos> Meaning?<eos> Patrick and i didn't connect. He's convinced i'm an awful person.<eos> Why would he think that?<eos> Well, why wouldn't he?
Paige Sayles.<eos> The church lady's daughter.<eos> Look, she's 18.<eos> She's legal.<eos> And plus, it was her idea.<eos> - And?<eos> Paula Lindbergh.<eos> I think she's trying to get pregnant so her husband would stay in the suburbs.<eos> So, you mind being used as a stud horse?<eos> [Chuckles] Would you?
The 100,000 must be for some serious extras.<eos> How many other people have you targeted?<eos> I want the truth. I have nothing more to say.<eos> Oh, but I do.<eos> I ran into Emma, by chance, a few years ago, at a hotel in Manhattan.<eos> I was working on a case, so was she.<eos> I knew she was married.<eos> But I didn't care.<eos> She...<eos> She wouldn't.
-Ayqe, It's not like that.<eos> -Then what's it like?<eos> You are searching for a name for your unborn child, you prick! What kind of a man are you?<eos> Don't you have any mercy?<eos> I have much more than you've got!<eos> Oya...<eos> What is it?<eos> Oya?<eos> 3ule, I have to go somewhere, would you care to join me?<eos> All right, I would...
¶ They started slow long ago ¶<eos> ¶ Head to toe healthy weathy and wise ¶<eos> Does anybody actually read my column?<eos> - Do your friends ever talk about it?<eos> - Of course.<eos> In fact, Rabbit's ex-girlfriend just said to me last week,<eos> "I should read Foxy's column," but they don't get the Gazette.<eos> - Ash!<eos> Let's get cracking!<eos> - Why would they?
Yeah.<eos> Ten - Can I have that?<eos> - Ten nuns and 90 orphans.<eos> - Angus, go faster. - Ask her why she's following me.<eos> Please. - Why are you stalking him?<eos> I'm not- I'm not stalking.<eos> No, I'm not stalking.<eos> Stalking's an obsessive pursuit of prey.<eos> But you're kind of following alongside his van.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Clearly, you are defective beyond repair.<eos> Guards, take this defective clone to the incinerator!<eos> Well, what are you waiting for?<eos> You and you!<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Take the prisoner and the defective clone to the incinerator!<eos> - Of course, sir.<eos> - Here's a security pass, just in case.<eos> - Would you like a gun?<eos> - Yes, I would.
Because I was thinking it's a good time for me suck.<eos> Ryan for.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Why these games?<eos> You have this fantastic nice clothes and do not want to suck my penis.<eos> What the hell!<eos> - Sorry.<eos> - What the fuck you?<eos> - Sorry, I did not.<eos> - You would not...
Smell.<eos> What?<eos> - What do you smell? - Wh-What?<eos> What do you smell?<eos> What do you smell?<eos> It smells like a farm.<eos> Not a Rose's farm.<eos> Morning, sir.<eos> Patrick Fitzpatrick, I'm with Rose's Manure, and I don't mean to bother you, but could you tell me where I might find a gentleman named Henrick Hanover?<eos> No, I wouldn't.
Any mythic revelations?<eos> Nope.<eos> Nothing to report, sir.<eos> - You were born, right, Saul?<eos> - What?<eos> You were born.<eos> On Earth.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I don't remember.<eos> But I wouldn't anyway.
They have to wipe out a bunch of german dignitaries at a french château.<eos> Franko, posey... maggott.<eos> I got it, Phil.<eos> I so got it.<eos> My old friend died.<eos> And the funeral's on tuesday.<eos> I wanted to tell you that.<eos> I did.<eos> And then I was afraid that if I did tell you, that you wouldn't...<eos> That I wouldn't what?
What kind of 95-year-old woman doesn't wear underwear?<eos> After finding a bitchin' pair of truck stop sunglasses to cover up my red, swollen eyes, Randy tried to find a list item I could do in a coma.<eos> That turned out to be a lot harder.<eos> "Number 116:<eos> Rolled john fenster down a hill in a porta potti."<eos> Do you think Earl would mind if we did that to him?<eos> Randy, if you were in a coma, would you want someone rolling you downhill in a porta potti?<eos> Let me think.<eos> Oh, no.<eos> No, I would not.
Go through.<eos> I was being a terrible tease earlier on.<eos> You don't mind, do you?<eos> No.<eos> Did you like kissing me?<eos> Yeah, I did.<eos> Would you like to do it again?<eos> You look like you would.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Would you, Joe?
I just seems like something I should do.<eos> And was having Morris impersonate me with that cop also something you thought you should do, no matter what happened to him?<eos> But it wasn't a cop.<eos> It was Cromartie.<eos> What?<eos> He's going school to school looking for you.<eos> Trying to match your face.<eos> He's moved on though.<eos> He won't go back there.<eos> I wouldn't.
Look after him.<eos> Please.<eos> Bye.<eos> - No, I can't leave him with you! - Alex, if you have...<eos> - He'll be fine, I have a daughter.<eos> - I know, I know!<eos> And you could be such, such a wonderful mother!<eos> So wonderful!<eos> But I don't remember a boy turning up!<eos> And surely I would!
- There have been studies.<eos> Not double-blind studies.<eos> How could there be? Who would be the control group?<eos> As you can see, detoxing can get pretty ugly.<eos> Let's give them some privacy.<eos> Do you want to come over and have coffee?<eos> Sounds good.<eos> I have a video of me singing last night.<eos> Do you want to see it?<eos> Gee, why wouldn't I?
That's not quite true, though, is it?<eos> No, it is true.<eos> She knows who I am, what I was.<eos> 10 years ago your wife died in a car accident.<eos> Is that why you turned state witness?<eos> I promised my wife on her death bed that... I would do whatever was necessary to protect Lindsey.<eos> Did you tell Lindsey it was supposed to be you in that car and not her mom?<eos> Yes.<eos> Why, then, with all that you taught her, would she allow herself to get caught up in this?<eos> She wouldn't.
And Sir Timothy told me that, since old Chitty the gamekeeper is sick,<eos> - I'd be running things on the estate.<eos> - The whole estate?<eos> That's quite a responsibility for an underkeeper.<eos> I mean the grounds.<eos> A lad could do well by impressing such a respected nobleman.<eos> I don't suppose you'll be impressing Sir Timothy by sitting under a tree with the local postgirl.<eos> Perhaps he isn't the only one I want to impress.<eos> I wanted to ask you.<eos> Would you...
The only real son you have hates you just as much as I do.<eos> That... That doesn't matter, but you've...<eos> You've got to listen to me.<eos> Please! You're right, It doesn't, cause you're just gonna wash your hands of it, aren't you?<eos> Just like you did when you murdered dr. Swann and the Queens?<eos> You haven't changed.<eos> Patricia told me, and you killed her for it.<eos> No.<eos> Clark, no.<eos> I'd never ...
...cannon, neat, neat, neat<eos> She can't afford a gun at all Neat, neat, neat.<eos> S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y<eos> Night! S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y<eos> Night!<eos> S-A-T-U-R-D-A-Y<eos> Look, an American nerd bird.<eos> Nerd bird?<eos> Would a nerd bird have chocolate, huh?<eos> Would a nerd bird?
Yeah.<eos> All right, dispatch says since these two here are pretty well dead, it's gonna be awhile before they can send anybody over.<eos> They're stretched pretty thin today.<eos> All right, so they disagree about the cut.<eos> They start shooting at each other, and one of the shots... hits the car's gas tank?<eos> Looks that way.<eos> Yeah, but you think that's what happened?<eos> No. I just said it looks that way.<eos> Because you really have to be aiming if you want the gas tank to explode like that.<eos> You really would.
I don't want to be so much more!<eos> I want to help Josh ace his exams...<eos> Lori write her song, and Steven prepare the perfect dinner for Nicole.<eos> I want to spend the afternoon with Amanda.<eos> I want to be there for them...<eos> Be the person they need me to be.<eos> Mediocre.<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> You're right.<eos> I wouldn't.
And how did she take it?<eos> Ah,okay,there you are.<eos> She took it well.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - Looking for you.<eos> You must be christine.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have something to say to this therapist!<eos> Would you like to sit down?<eos> No,I would not.
I didn't really click with bree.<eos> You didn't click?<eos> I heard zippers.<eos> Well,yeah,we gave it a shot.<eos> Hey,and what about those ladies in the box next to us?<eos> I thought the whole beauty of being a lesbian was that you didn't have to have sex anymore.<eos> Not in the movies I've seen.<eos> Hey,christine.<eos> Would you ever let me fix you up with someone?<eos> No,I never would.
What are you doing?<eos> I'm just trying to scan on this drawing of justin's, do a search and see if anything comes up.<eos> Yeah,what's that like to know that he could just die at any minute,just like that?<eos> I can't imagine.<eos> Well,if you think about it,that's pretty much what we all face.<eos> Ok,true,but you know,we do a pretty good job of pretending it's a long way off, and,well,the odds are on our side.<eos> But for justin... yeah,he's got inside information,and he knows the odds are totally the other way for him.<eos> That's gotta be hard. I mean,would you want to know?<eos> If you were gonna die in a month-<eos> - Or a week- - Or a year- - Would you?
Come on!<eos> I don't have a crush on him.<eos> Just want to be him.<eos> Well,apparently,Morgan Fairchild wants to be me, or at least she wants to play me in a movie.<eos> Seriously?<eos> How cool is that?<eos> It is,right?<eos> It's just,why me?<eos> Who would want to come to that movie?<eos> I would.
And pancakes with blueberry syrup.<eos> Anybody want anything?<eos> Coffee. Black.<eos> You hungry?<eos> It wasn't the smell.<eos> Let's hit the vic's apartment.<eos> I'm not feeling so hot myself.<eos> I got irritable bowel syndrome.<eos> Why don't I fill in?<eos> Gee, would you, John?
It's the things you don't do you regret.<eos> It's the {kind of }cavalier philosophy that caused my father to leave my mother.<eos> - You go for it.<eos> - Bumder.<eos> And so we headed for Carli's house.<eos> I feel a bit stupid doing this.<eos> This is fine, isn't it?<eos> Yeah. Definitely.<eos> You would tell me if I was being a dick?<eos> - Of course I would. - Yeah, yeah.
Yes, but he's not wrong about this.<eos> If it reaches the conduit, it will have access to virtually unlimited power.<eos> - And what would happen?<eos> - The growth would increase exponentially.<eos> And since we've shut this section down, we have no sensors in the area, so the only way to know how far it's penetrated is to do a visual inspection.<eos> All right, assemble a team.<eos> I need some answers, Doctor.<eos> How do we kill this thing?<eos> Well, we're working on a genetically engineered virus that might be capable of destroying the pathogen that's infecting Dr. Keller, but that wouldn't eliminate the biopolymer itself.<eos> What would?
He used everything in his arsenal:<eos> the health department,even the cops.<eos> He was out for blood.<eos> He had people watching me.<eos> It's why I got the gun.<eos> Sure.<eos> Position you were in,hey,I'd have done the same.<eos> All that rage,but why take it out on the wrong guy?<eos> This epic dogfight between him and Boone, *********<eos> And Dex wouldn't...
From people.<eos> We should send her home.<eos> She's got grade three previa.<eos> She's also got the most viable fetus we've ever seen.<eos> More reason to have her in a hospital under constant supervision.<eos> For a doctor, you can be amazingly stupid.<eos> She should be delivered.<eos> It's too early.<eos> Besides, the baby might not survive.<eos> At least the girl would.
I'd like you to tell me the names of everyone he worked with, and every dead body he worked on.<eos> Today's my son's birthday.<eos> - That's great.<eos> - He's nine-years-old.<eos> We're, you know, throwing him a party.<eos> Check this out.<eos> Look at that.<eos> I am going to destroy you.<eos> You think he'll like it?<eos> Sure, what kid wouldn't?
Well... little gifts are always a nice way to express your feelings.<eos> I know.<eos> Could be as simple as a cashmere robe... or, uh, as extravagant as a new car.<eos> - Yeah, I suppose it could. Ahem. - Yeah.<eos> Excuse me, I got something really cool for Jake.<eos> Doesn't even have to be new.<eos> Certified pre-owned is still very thoughtful.<eos> - Hey, what are you doing?<eos> - I was trying to research cars... but you wouldn't believe what comes up when you Google "Hummer."<eos> Actually, I would.
Seriously?<eos> Sure.<eos> Think about it-<eos> You and amanda out on the town every week,<eos> Having some new kind of crazy adventure.<eos> You have a great dynamic.<eos> The budget's pretty tight,<eos> But i could probably float you an advance<eos> If it sweetens the deal and helps pay your rent.<eos> Oh, it would. It would.
Right. Okay.<eos> Why don't you come to bed, bro.<eos> Ohh, I don't think I'll be sleeping inyourbed tonight.<eos> Doesn't really feel right.<eos> I feel like it might be a little bit better for me... if I spent the night on the couch.<eos> Okay.<eos> That's cool.<eos> Just make sure you go to the bathroom, okay, before you fall asleep 'cause I don't want you to piss on the couch again.<eos> Oh, well, we, we wouldn't want that now, would we?<eos> No! We wouldn't.
Pretty sure that was it.<eos> You said you never felt this way about anyone before.<eos> Is that true?<eos> Okay, listen, after all we've been through...<eos> When you walked away tonight, all I could think was,<eos> "she's the one I want to be with."<eos> So, yeah, it matters.<eos> It's easy for you to say because you didn't just pull a Janet Jackson at the snowflake ball.<eos> Oh. You wanna grab a drink?<eos> Yes, I would.
!<eos> Yes.<eos> It's a new verb that I'm working on.<eos> Of or related to having too much therapy.<eos> It's going to be in the book.<eos> The book I'm never going to finish, Because I have to concentrate on my job.<eos> Duty calls.<eos> Hey, Rose, how is school?<eos> I should just drop out now!<eos> Seriously, I would.
I need to get my strength back, before I go back to work.<eos> Do you like being a priest?<eos> "Like" doesn't come into it.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - I was called.<eos> Do you always come running when someone calls?<eos> When it's God.<eos> If he asked you to throw yourself off a cliff would you do it?<eos> - And if he asked you to murder someone?<eos> He wouldn't.
Listen, kid, the '50s came back in the '70s. I remember when this was quite the thing.<eos> I can still change my mind. I can still walk away.<eos> I could meet myself as a baby, that's so dangerous.<eos> If I touched her there could be a huge explosion.<eos> But you know that, so you won't.<eos> It's your choice.<eos> It's only dangerous to go back in time if you change something, and you're not going to.<eos> What would you do?<eos> I'd go.<eos> Any normal person would.
Great. I'll practise my thank-you speech.<eos> Come on, Sasha, don't be a...<eos> What is the problem with George?<eos> It's complicated.<eos> Over my head you mean.<eos> Well, George wants to pull out of the film.<eos> And I want to persuade him not.<eos> But I also want to find out why he's suddenly doing this.<eos> Maybe he just doesn't want to be on TV.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.
I can't do anything; she really wants to fight you.<eos> No, she doesn't.<eos> She told me she doesn't wanna fight.<eos> She's just stuck, Stan.<eos> Because she knows I'm gonna kick her ass, but she feels like if she doesn't fight me all the kids will call her a chicken.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You know what she did?<eos> She apologized and begged me not to fight her.<eos> I said "Well Wendy, if you're so sorry, then say it in front of everyone."<eos> But she wouldn't.
Aren't you on a date?<eos> A date for all three of us, then!<eos> You're worried that I'll run off again?<eos> Come on, we're pals.<eos> I'd never think that.<eos> You don't have to say that.<eos> What kind of music do you like?<eos> What were you listening to?<eos> Like you'd know if I told you.<eos> Of course I would.
Nice hat, Lexie.<eos> Thanks, I just bought it.<eos> Listen, can you get me in a room with Hank Kelly at the comptroller's desk?<eos> - He won't talk to reporters in fancy hats.<eos> - Hey, Lexie.<eos> You going hunting?<eos> It's a very expensive hat, your whole year's salary.<eos> Harvey wants to see you in his office.<eos> I'd take that mack off before you go in there.<eos> - You would, would you?
Careful!<eos> It looks perfect, madam.<eos> Just perfect.<eos> Amman, Jordan<eos> She'll do it before dinner.<eos> No way, Tala loves her food too much.<eos> The last time she broke the engagement before dinner.<eos> And the first time she waited till Reema had a mouthfull of coffee.<eos> I just hope she keeps the jewelry this time 8 karats, D flawless.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Great for hiding Easter eggs.<eos> Let's get to the point.<eos> What brings you here?<eos> I'm Didier Barleycorn, resident of Le Havre.<eos> High Seas Quarter, behind the velodrome.<eos> I took the liberty of coming to express my feelings for your daughter.<eos> I really have feelings for her.<eos> I love France.<eos> It's nice of you to inform us but if France had a boyfriend we would know.<eos> Wouldn't we, Henri?
Maybe that works for you, but it doesn't work for me.<eos> I'm sorry, I just... I can't.<eos> I know you're hurting because you weren't there with your son last night.<eos> But I want you to know that I envy what you have.<eos> Your kids are very fortunate they have someone who loves them as much you do.<eos> Someone who tries so hard.<eos> And any man is a fool who doesn't know how incredibly lucky he is to have you.<eos> Wait.<eos> Her eyes were dark brown and soft like she'd never hurt a soul.<eos> And she wouldn't, neither.
Men, this man is a murderer Vietcong.<eos> He murdered at least five of our brothers.<eos> We will not have mercy.<eos> We will not have prisoners.<eos> It's crazy.<eos> - Insane.<eos> - Garraty, turn it down.<eos> From where I come to this we call it murder.<eos> You got a problem with the army or me, you idiot?<eos> - Why would a problem with you, sir? "Well.
You got, uh, what, a thousand head of cattle here?<eos> What's your control, really?<eos> I mean, how do you safeguard against, the mad cow or any other disease?<eos> It's not like you can vet every animal.<eos> Well, if I had a mad cow, I wouldn't need a vet to tell me.<eos> My daddy said that the other cows take care of that.<eos> They shun the afflicted animal.<eos> Well, even so, uh, can't you make beef more pure using high-tech methods, like cloning?<eos> No, if I believed that, I wouldn't be fighting this.<eos> I really wouldn't.
It's safe.<eos> Good.<eos> - Then we...<eos> - There's no "we" anymore.<eos> I've had some time to think over the past few days.<eos> The only reason you hired me was to get to Katie.<eos> - Ellen... - Don't bother.<eos> I had that figured out pretty early actually, but then you had Tom convince me otherwise, and I was stupid enough to believe him.<eos> At the time, I didn't realize he's a scared, weak, liar who would do anything to please you.<eos> - I would never...
Simple assault's a misdemeanor.<eos> They'll slap him on the wrist.<eos> But publicity like this is never a bad thing for us.<eos> You heading out?<eos> No, David's working, so I'm sticking around.<eos> I've been thinking about you and David.<eos> You want a drink?<eos> Sure.<eos> I hope it works out for you two.<eos> Well, why wouldn't it?
Oh, thanks, now I know.<eos> I guess you should see this.<eos> Why are you bruised?<eos> What did you do?<eos> I found Piz.<eos> We sort of had it out.<eos> I knew you wouldn't let him tape you like that. Stop.<eos> Just stop.<eos> I don't know why you're involved with this or what the hell is on this thing, but it's not gonna be me.<eos> Piz would never...
Everybody's got one and they all stink.<eos> Okay, either I never noticed your similarities before, or you just channeled my mother.<eos> People at table six need another round.<eos> And why do I get the feeling that I was just insulted?<eos> She dropped in out of the blue last night,<eos> - just made herself at home.<eos> - Your mama?<eos> Well, you should bring her in.<eos> I'd like to meet her.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
Couldn't they get garden gnomes like everyone else?<eos> It's killed all these people, then put them on show like trophies.<eos> Or a warning, and I'm taking it. Let's go!<eos> I'll have to leave you here on your own. I really wish I could help you, Maria, but I have to find Luke and Clyde.<eos> Everything Bea knows about the Gorgon is still inside her head. You just have to find a way to unlock it.<eos> You were right. I never should have got any of you involved.<eos> I'm sorry about what I said.<eos> It's not your fault.<eos> I wanted to see aliens.<eos> Who wouldn't?
When I return, I hope to be a completely changed human being.<eos> That'd be great. Do I believe that Michael possesses the skills... to survive in a hostile environment?<eos> Let's put it this way: no, I do not.<eos> This is what a true survivor man does.<eos> You simulate a disaster, like a plane wreck.<eos> You could only wear the clothes that you have on, and you could only use the stuff you have in your pockets.<eos> Now, in this case, this disaster is a serial killer.<eos> Creepy guy who's abducted me and is taking me out into the wilderness to leave me for dead.<eos> No, I would never leave you for dead. - You would never escape.<eos> -Well, yes I would.
Go back to sleep.<eos> But when we decide to change who we are for someone we love...<eos> What time is it?<eos> ... we can surprise even ourselves with who we've become.<eos> All right, Jordan, you win.<eos> I miss you guys.<eos> I miss you, too, Daddy!<eos> Jordan, would you like to say the same thing?<eos> - I would not.<eos> - She would not.
I'm, I'm gonna call dr. Pullen tomorrow.<eos> We can get a prescription and...<eos> It's what you want, right?<eos> Katie, the more I find out about this, the more I realize it's not a curse.<eos> It's a calling.<eos> I'm doing something important, maybe even vital, and I don't think I should stop it.<eos> What about getting things back to the way they were?<eos> Things aren't going back to the way they were ever, I'm afraid.<eos> I worry for you and I worry for zack.<eos> And I would...
- It's the hair.<eos> - What are you doing?<eos> - That sign.<eos> It's like they covered it up or something.<eos> Ok.<eos> Armstrong Medical Hospital, formerly known as the Arthur Ferrey medical wing.<eos> - Why'd they change it?<eos> - Looks like he got arrested.<eos> You found all that out just right now?<eos> I--I would--it--
- Where we going?<eos> - Just go.<eos> At least you know it works.<eos> Your doctoral thesis was on the origins of the universe, right?<eos> - The first one.<eos> - Hey, is this the new kid?<eos> Who you calling kid, Spartacus?<eos> - Cocky.<eos> I like him.<eos> - You would.
I will if I want.<eos> Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> Look at you.<eos> When's the last time you had a bath? Scum.<eos> - What?<eos> - Scum is what you are. And you.<eos> Why on earth would any girl--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl want to--<eos> Would any girl what?
Who the hell do you think you are?<eos> Look at you.<eos> When's the last time you had a bath? Scum.<eos> - What?<eos> - Scum is what you are. And you.<eos> Why on earth would any girl--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl want to--<eos> Would any girl what?<eos> Would any girl what?
But the answer was nothing.<eos> So our cannibal has a diamond tooth?<eos> Well, not the entire tooth.<eos> The diamond inset; left lateral incisor.<eos> It left a distinct mark on the skull.<eos> So if someone in the building conservancy or cleaning crew has a diamond in his tooth, that's our guy.<eos> You got 'em.<eos> I'd like to be in on it when you interrogate him.<eos> What?<eos> You would?
- Well, what do you want?<eos> Look at you.<eos> It's sad. I don't think you actually smoke pot.<eos> I think you smoke oregano.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - No.<eos> - Look at me, I'm on day 10 of not smoking, and I'm fine. - You feel great?<eos> - Well, no, I don't feel great.<eos> I'd still like to do it. - Really?<eos> Would you?
It was always at the foot of my bed, never at the foot of her bed.<eos> - But she did see it.<eos> - She saw it also?<eos> Absolutely.<eos> And we were both absolutely terrified.<eos> - OK. - I mean, you know, couldn't even move.<eos> You know, you just...<eos> It was just... It was horrifying.<eos> And we would just pray. Please, please let it just go away.<eos> And then, eventually, it would.
You don't.<eos> - You never knew her, then?<eos> - She died when I was born.<eos> I never knew mine neither.<eos> - Don't you wanna find out?<eos> - No, I don't. Not one little bit.<eos> I do.<eos> You wouldn't have said anything, would you?<eos> You'd have kept it a secret.<eos> I would.
- I'm sorry.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> It's been four days.<eos> Not that I was keeping track.<eos> I just thought maybe...<eos> I know Lucy told you.<eos> I knew she would.<eos> So I wouldn't have...<eos> So I wouldn't...
You see now what a patriot I am.<eos> Someone back from somewhere.<eos> - Tell them to close the windows in the balcony, or the dye will run on the new curtains.<eos> - They've shot Hasselburg!<eos> Someone's shot Hasselburg!<eos> In the eye! Th-they shot him through the right eye!<eos> Into his brain! He's dead!<eos> - Hasselburg was killed with a bullet in the eye. Blinded.<eos> A painter would sympathize with such a death.<eos> - So would Samson.
Do you understand what it feels like to want to be loved? All I want is love, Carl.<eos> - Why won't anybody love me?<eos> - Ulla, Ulla. Ulla?<eos> - No, It's not working.<eos> Come on, I could be your mum, Carl.<eos> I could be the one who makes breakfast with you, helps you with your homework, who says "good morning" to you and you say "morning, mum".<eos> But hey!<eos> There's dad! "Hey, dad!" You see, I haven't eaten him.<eos> What if I ate him ...<eos> but of course I wouldn't.
- and, you know, myself...<eos> - What makes you think you'd fuck things up?<eos> Paige,<eos> I mean it, I think you are an amazing woman.<eos> Oh, no no no.<eos> Just stop before you get to the "but".<eos> You're a really amazing woman, but you're not my type.<eos> You're a really amazing woman, but I'm in a relationship.<eos> I'd really love to fuck you, but I won't stay the night.<eos> I probably wouldn't.
Candy? Out now!<eos> Walk the field.<eos> He's going back.<eos> This isn't going to work.<eos> If I had a minefield that he could sweep, then I... I could keep him busy, but I don't have a minefield.<eos> He's ours.<eos> We got a lease on him... no option to buy, and I'm taking him back.<eos> If you do, I'll leave you.<eos> You'd leave me for that weapon detector?<eos> You'd...
- I did not.<eos> Yes, you did.<eos> I mean, it's okay, I guess.<eos> I can't imagine going through something like that, and I'm pretty sure, I wouldn't want to be reminded of it either.<eos> Yes, well, it was a little weird there for a bit.<eos> For the last little while, you've really made an effort to make time for me. And it has been lovely.<eos> It's funny, you know.<eos> I mean, as much as I hate to admit it, seeing my little sister so happy with her family. I just...<eos> Well, it kind of made me realize that, well, I'd like to get married.<eos> You would?
But not on the air?<eos> No, not on the air.<eos> Maybe because you don't have a meteorologist's name.<eos> I don't follow.<eos> Well... correct me if i'm wrong, but "Leonard"<eos> isn't a term for any kind of weather.<eos> No, it is not.<eos> So, if I was to look up "Leonard"<eos> in, say, a weather glossary, there would be no definition.<eos> No, there would not.
Am I sensing something here?<eos> Like hesitation?<eos> No.<eos> No!<eos> If you're suddenly uninterested,let me know.<eos> I'll need adequate time to alert my ego.<eos> Would that bother you?<eos> Me being not interested?<eos> Yeah.<eos> It would.
So, how is my future grandson-in-law?<eos> Great.<eos> Pardon me, I don't mean to interrupt. Excuse me.<eos> -But you were engaged?<eos> -Am engaged.<eos> I am engaged.<eos> Never mentioned that to me.<eos> She...<eos> She never mentioned that.<eos> Well, why would she?
OKAY, RALPHIE HAS TRIED TO QUIT MANY TIMES BEFORE.<eos> BIG TOBACCO'S REALLY GOT THEIR CLAWS IN THAT RACCOON. OH!<eos> DID YOU HEAR THAT?<eos> I THINK RALPHIE MIGHT BE HOME.<eos> RALPHIE, THAT YOU?<eos> WHAT DO YOU WANT, LATEKKA? COME SAY HI.<eos> WE GOT A VISITOR.<eos> LEAVE ME ALONE!<eos> UM, SOMETIMES HE GETS A LITTLE CRANKY.<eos> DUDE, WOULD YOU JUST...
Tell them about the time you thought you had a big head and then tell them what I said.<eos> When I was in fifth grade, I thought I had a big head.<eos> Like this:<eos> She wore her hair to try and hide it.<eos> What'd I say?<eos> Mom said I could have a craniotomy.<eos> There's no such thing.<eos> Right? There's no such thing.<eos> Oh, please, I love her to pieces.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Why would he do that?<eos> You know, I never really got to know him, so... Okay, okay.<eos> What do you know?<eos> The compartments between us are in vacuum. They are possibly damaged by the explosion.<eos> We're cut off from each other.<eos> - What else?<eos> - Look, just give me a second to figure out how screwed we are, and I'll get back to you.<eos> Herick?<eos> We believe he took his own life and tried to kill us.<eos> - Why would he...
I know that my best shot is in the light, not with machines or tubes or a hospital bed.<eos> You have insider information.<eos> It's not fair.<eos> So do you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> It's just, you know... if it came to you, it wouldn't be easy for me, that's all.<eos> Yeah, but you'd do it because you love me.<eos> And you know I'd be ok.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I would.
We have to be perfect.<eos> Your father looks angry.<eos> My father always looks angry.<eos> But your sister looks hot.<eos> For this you leave your job, take an unauthorized vacation.<eos> Gorge yourself on hamburgers and waffles.<eos> Waffles are very good.<eos> You would like them.<eos> No, Hiro.<eos> I would not.
It's a lot to process.<eos> So many people.<eos> Yeah.<eos> And Curtis... I can't believe this.<eos> I know you and he were friends.<eos> Why do people I know keep dying?<eos> Did you find anything out about Fayed?<eos> No, we're still positioning satellites.<eos> (sighs) We've got massive packet loss. Do you want to help me boot up routers?<eos> Who wouldn't?
- Market's already open in Tokyo.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> I'm gonna open some more wine.<eos> Mr. Young wants to make sure you understand that last part.<eos> Do you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I get it.<eos> So when we think of Jane, let us remember her kind heart and her loving spirit.<eos> And now, if there's someone who'd like to share a special memory of our dear friend...<eos> I would.
Hey, Earl, you think she wants me to sleep there or am I supposed to just leave my stuff ?<eos> Only one person knows the answer to that.<eos> God.<eos> Maybe.<eos> And also Catalina.<eos> Oh.<eos> Randy wanted to ask her, but every time he started thinking about sleeping at Catalina's, he started thinking about sleeping with Catalina.<eos> Hey, Catalina, I'm...<eos> And thinking about that made him giggle.<eos> Uh... would...
Six years!<eos> Yes sir, I'm sorry, I thought...<eos> Get out of here, Van Hoogstratten!<eos> - Now!<eos> - A'ight...<eos> Frank Cortland's office.<eos> What are you looking at, floater?<eos> Sounds like you met the one and only Frank Cortland.<eos> Man, I'd like to put that guy through a juicer<eos> We all would.
Stay back!<eos> - It's one of the birds.<eos> - Stay back!<eos> How did you know it was going to be here?<eos> - I didn't.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> You had to.<eos> That's what you and Charlie were arguing about.<eos> You knew.<eos> - How would I?
Just talk to me.<eos> Okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> I know that he didn't live a particularly dignified life, but he was a man of dignity.<eos> And to be exhibited like that, so that the whole world can see his, his ravaged liver and organs while he's holding a liquor bottle and smiling?<eos> Nobody deserves that.<eos> You do realize that this decision legally belonged to your mother?<eos> No, legally, she was to do what he wanted.<eos> This was not his wish.<eos> He would never...
That's a football team.<eos> Yes... and I am their number one fan.<eos> Please, don't go.<eos> I didn't mean to offend you.<eos> It's just...<eos> I get very lonely being German.<eos> And a bigwig in the art world.<eos> - I imagine.<eos> - And gay.<eos> - Would you...
I know we go back to our corners tomorrow, but I owe you one.<eos> You ever need to call it in, no questions asked.<eos> I'll see you tomorrow.<eos> Jo, see you, bud.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You okay ?<eos> Oh, yeah, a maze, right.<eos> You guys risked my life on a maze.<eos> Wait a second... there was no risk involved.<eos> Obviously, I would never...
I've got "Bret." Can't you just have Bret as your rapping name?<eos> No. It's not a rapping name.<eos> It's a good rapping name.<eos> "Hello, everybody, I am Bret."<eos> - No.<eos> - Rhymes with "wet" and...<eos> No, "Rhymenoceros."<eos> Look, if you're gonna have some sort of rap name, just be careful you don't do a drive-by.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Well, you'd better not.
Maybe.<eos> Why, you ever kill somebody?<eos> - Not really.<eos> - No?<eos> Yeah, me neither.<eos> Killed a monkey once.<eos> Don't tell anybody about that, okay?<eos> 'Cause I'm not proud of it.<eos> - Oh, I won't tell anyone.<eos> - You'd better not.
What do you want?<eos> - Come in.<eos> Come on!<eos> Show him!<eos> What is going on here?<eos> Take your seats!<eos> Let's start.<eos> So, girls...<eos> Would you be able to take a disabled person like Quasimodo to be your husband, instead of an important rich man.<eos> Kerli would...
If it gets us past this,I'll give you them two construction jobs you were whining about.<eos> Give me?<eos> They were mine to begin with.<eos> This isn't about jobs.You put down one of my guys.<eos> I did not put him down.<eos> My nephew did, yeah, sure.<eos> But it wasn't any kind of move on you.<eos> You don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> I don't want to go to war over pete mcgonagle.<eos> Michael caffee would, yeah, sure.
Thank you.<eos> So, first plane crash?<eos> - What gave it away?<eos> - You can always spot the newbies.<eos> We're gonna be OK, you know.<eos> Are we?<eos> We're alive, on a beautiful island.<eos> We'll sleep under the stars, and before you know it, the helicopters will come and take us all home.<eos> You really think they'll find us?<eos> Well, yeah, why wouldn't they?
You bitch.<eos> Of course, that certain place is the Ramsap Inn.<eos> The place I told that girl about.<eos> Right about now, a bunch of scoundrels are rushing right in there.<eos> Probably something like this.<eos> But the room they raid will be the one next to hers.<eos> Why would a convenient thing like that happen?<eos> That's because I told them it was the room next to hers.<eos> The stupid woman will hop up because of the gun fire, and she'll run to the hallway to see what's going on.<eos> Well, in that situation, of course she would.
Where do you live?<eos> The Alta Loma.<eos> Bunker Hill.<eos> Old women and weak men.<eos> Perfect place for you.<eos> Couldn't be better.<eos> In my hotel they don't allow Mexicans.<eos> White dough.<eos> No wonder she laughed.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Hooked in something...<eos> Someone?<eos> No.<eos> No, not someone.<eos> I just- - I'm having a time getting used to the move and everything.<eos> - I won't take it personally.<eos> - Don't.<eos> Okay. Blow me off again, I will.<eos> Should I take that under advisement?<eos> - Yes. I would. - Okay.
We'll try again...<eos> Try what?<eos> Marriage?<eos> Not marriage...<eos> We'll try again...<eos> you know this book says...<eos> What are these books that you keep reading?<eos> 'Fighting foryour marriage' bestseller by Anna Marie Lou...<eos> She knows a lot about marriages...<eos> Of course she would...
The portal will only open if we offer the blood of an innocent.<eos> Just a drop of blood. A pinprick, that's all.<eos> It's the final task.<eos> Hurry.<eos> You promised to obey me!<eos> -Give me the boy!<eos> -No!<eos> My brother stays with me.<eos> You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?<eos> Yes, I would.
Hurry.<eos> You promised to obey me!<eos> -Give me the boy!<eos> -No!<eos> My brother stays with me.<eos> You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?<eos> Yes, I would.<eos> You would give up your throne for him?<eos> He who has caused you such misery, such humiliation?<eos> Yes, I would.
So, you could answer a question on Auden, then?<eos> No, sir!<eos> Mr. Hector's stuff's not meant for the exam!<eos> It's to make us more rounded human beings.<eos> Listen!<eos> This examination's gonna be about everything and anything you know and are, and if there's a question on Auden or whoever and you know about it, answer it.<eos> That would be a betrayal of trust.<eos> Yeah! Is nothing sacred, sir?<eos> We're shocked.<eos> I would, sir, and they would.
Okay, why don't you press it?<eos> Um, Miss Duke?<eos> I wondered if I could have next Thursday evening off?<eos> Why?<eos> Just personal reasons.<eos> You know that Maltese cross that I brought back from Paris?<eos> Yeah, it's in the safe.<eos> How do think that would go?<eos> With this?<eos> It would, yeah, absolutely would.
She carves you inside with her finger and then says it was for your own good.<eos> What did you feel when you remembered all this?<eos> I was happy that she died, OK?<eos> I said, "good thing she's dead!"<eos> "Good thing she's dead"<eos> [Skipped item nr. 438]<eos> What if you ran into her now and she smiled like an innocent old lady And asked if you had kids? What if she tried to touch one of your students?<eos> Like Elif, for example?<eos> I'd kill her!<eos> I would!
Wiggin, wait here, please.<eos> I'd like to enquire about my royalty earnings, Mr Copperthwaite.<eos> And whether I might, at some stage, afford a house of my own in the country. You have enough to buy an estate.<eos> Several estates, and a house in town.<eos> You're quite a wealthy woman, Miss Potter.<eos> Am I truly?<eos> Yes, the income has become quite regular.<eos> If your fortune continues to grow, you should have no financial worries for the rest of your life.<eos> Beatrix, come and sit with us, please.<eos> - I'd rather not, Father.
Jeff, if you try to move your wife, she will die.<eos> I can have an ambulance here in four minutes.<eos> Would you like to take your wife out of here tonight?<eos> Would you like to take her to safety?<eos> Stay.<eos> Stand and face me, Jeff.<eos> - Stay with me, please.<eos> - Right now.<eos> Would you like to get your life back?<eos> Would you, Jeff?
Six years ago, I find out I inherited the Philadelphia chromosome.<eos> Ran on my mother's side of the family.<eos> I never knew.<eos> Screwed by genetics.<eos> First time, I was panicked the baby would be bipolar.<eos> I'm not so sure I've changed that much.<eos> The chances are slim, you know that.<eos> Crossing the street is a risk.<eos> If you let it get to you, you'd never have children.<eos> Nobody would.
It should fare very well around her.<eos> Oh, right.<eos> See ya, Ted.<eos> Bye.<eos> Now, do you guys have any specific goals or issues that you want to work on?<eos> Or is this just an ordinary, everyday relationship tune-up?<eos> Uh, no, it's not a tune-up.<eos> Um, we've been going at each other pretty good for a while now and we probably should have come months ago.<eos> Why didn't you?<eos> Oh, she wouldn't...
This is just my mind.<eos> Maybe you're here for a reason.<eos> To make a difference.<eos> Gimme your hand.<eos> What's that on your hands, is that grit?<eos> Sand.<eos> I was running up here and I fell against the fire bucket.<eos> See, why would I imagine that?<eos> Why would I bother to put that kind of detail in it?<eos> You wouldn't.
You're quite correct.<eos> Then for all intents and purposes, I am already dead.<eos> I'm sorry. So am I.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah.<eos> We're all very sorry.<eos> Where's Elizabeth?<eos> She is here also.<eos> And I suppose you'd like us to take your word for that?<eos> Would you like to speak with her?<eos> Yes, we would.
Previously in Smallville...<eos> - a spaceship.<eos> - where ?<eos> you're a public figure now, senator.<eos> it's possible that any association with me... could be dangerous.<eos> i know i should be able to move on, but life without him doesn't feel real.<eos> - why would you lie to someone you love ?<eos> - i wouldn't.
Yeah, just walked in.<eos> I didn't know you were stopping by.<eos> I need a break from drywalling.<eos> You're still into toy cars?<eos> I choose to find that cute instead of creepy.<eos> It's just something someone gave me.<eos> This wouldn't by any chance have anything to do with that Hooters waitress that showed up at your doorstep yesterday?<eos> Jess is just a friend of my brother's.<eos> I'd tell you the whole story, but...<eos> But you'd just rather not?
This had nothing to do with rudeness.<eos> It's Hannah not wanting to ruffle feathers.<eos> It's the same thing she does with you and those keggers.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> She hates going to those things, but does she tell you that?<eos> No.<eos> Instead, she complains to me.<eos> So you keep taking her, she keeps hating it and the cycle continues.<eos> -I thought she liked them.<eos> -Why would she?
It's the name of a well-known establishment on the outskirts of Fairview.<eos> Its clientele is devoted.<eos> Everyone who goes there wants to get their hands on something.<eos> And when they cross a line...<eos> Hey! I warned you, pal!<eos> ...they are punished, as a certain married couple was about to discover.<eos> You want a lap dance?<eos> No, thanks, no.<eos> I sure hope Libby likes this camera.<eos> Why wouldn't she?
He's got family in new york.<eos> He was hoping you could get a message to them. Of course.<eos> As soon as we reach town.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What happened to them?<eos> Ask them.<eos> I'm sorry this place is such a mess.<eos> It's all right.<eos> Do you want a beer?<eos> Actually, I would.
If by "worse" you mean multiple homicides in your park since 2000, then yeah, worse.<eos> Well, there goes that theory.<eos> What theory?<eos> I was prepared to say that this could all be just a coincidence, but when you see them like that...<eos> It's more than a little disturbing.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What can we do to help?<eos> We're looking for someone who knows his way around your park, most likely a local.<eos> We got a list of the usual troublemakers, poachers and vandals, but I never figured any of them for a serial killer.<eos> Most likely you wouldn't, James.
Last time I checked, that was inside the park.<eos> No, that's a damn lie.<eos> I ain't been nowhere near that area.<eos> Know her?<eos> Nope.<eos> How about them?<eos> Like I said, no.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't have nothing to do with this.<eos> I wouldn't...
No, that's a damn lie.<eos> I ain't been nowhere near that area.<eos> Know her?<eos> Nope.<eos> How about them?<eos> Like I said, no.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't have nothing to do with this.<eos> I wouldn't...<eos> Wouldn't what?
I learned how in one of my Classes.<eos> This is the best school In the world.<eos> The teachers, the Students, everyone is so nice,<eos> And they seem to like me. They love you.<eos> Everybody Loves you. Look, jeannie, as<eos> Nice as this place is, I was Thinking it's a little bit far Away from home, and, well, I<eos> Have some brochures here. There<eos> Are places just as nice as this,<eos> And look, it has a lake, they Have a pool, they have aqua Aerobics.<eos> You'd really...
Means she's vulnerable.<eos> Go all in.<eos> But, um, the party's over in less than three hours.<eos> Cuddy: It's over in less than two hours.<eos> Which means you either have three of a kind, or just 3s.<eos> I'm guessing 3s.<eos> I bet 500.<eos> Go all in.<eos> You obviously want to bust me.<eos> Why would you--
I shall do it myself.<eos> Abby, would you... do me a favor?<eos> I mean, just until we finish?<eos> Oh, lovely!<eos> Single malt.<eos> Of course.<eos> Mrs. Mallard?<eos> Would you like to see my mass spectrometer?<eos> What a charming young lady.<eos> Of course I would, my dear.
- You're part of the system.<eos> Taxes we do not like.<eos> It's one of our bugbears.<eos> We'd give that money back to the people it was stolen from.<eos> Where in the castle?<eos> In the vault.<eos> Maximum security.<eos> You'd never get in.<eos> Yeah, you're right.<eos> We wouldn't...
So you reached out to cameron and neal.<eos> Everyone knew their plan,knew they had guns.<eos> And you had all the motive in the world.<eos> - I didn't do anything.<eos> - Now,come on,davie, these guys mauled the girl you're in love with?<eos> You got to settle the score.<eos> Must have hurt... being in love with someone... who didn't love you back.<eos> Yeah,it did.<eos> But maybe if you saved her from the big bad wolves,<eos> - she would?
Let me tell you something, folks.<eos> They wouldn't be... haulin' him away in cuffs if they didn't have the goods on him.<eos> My brother said you had news about the case.<eos> By news, I hope you mean money.<eos> Clarice, we have wonderful news.<eos> Your boss, Mr. Faber, has decided not to terminate your employment after all.<eos> What's the catch?<eos> Sexual favors?<eos> Wants a little of this here?<eos> Who wouldn't?
I have nothing to gain by talking to him.<eos> Look, maybe you don't have anything to gain.<eos> Maybe you just have something to lose.<eos> A little piece of anger or bitterness, or disappointment.<eos> He hurt me so much.<eos> You know what, he hurt me, too.<eos> But you know what happened, I got stronger.<eos> I met the perfect man for me. Found a beautiful place to live, and you, you're married again.<eos> I saw how much you loved your husband when you thought that he was dead, and would you really be this happy if you were still with kyle?<eos> Would I?
Slavery.If anybody can sell this, you can.<eos> No.<eos> Maybe you can.<eos> Me?<eos> Why?<eos> Because you're the best young lawyer in this office.Really?<eos> Of course not.<eos> You're Hispanic, genius.<eos> I look more like Z Pruitt than like someone who understands the plight of these dead workers.<eos> Your colleagues would sellheir mothers for a shot at this, Martin.
Oh, really? You were great.<eos> Well, I mean, I've done loads.<eos> Sorry, have you got a minute to talk to a big fan of yours from the audience?<eos> Joe, this is Andy.<eos> Are you alright?<eos> Can I ask?<eos> Joe's getting into the hospital next week. St Matthew's.<eos> Maybe in for quite a long time.<eos> Would you pop in and say hello?<eos> Would I...?
Maybe.<eos> Bye.<eos> - 3 queens.<eos> - You've been playing queens all night.<eos> Well, what can I say, guys?<eos> The ladies love me tonight.<eos> So, clancy, game at your house?<eos> Man that almost never happens<eos> He wants to keep us away from melinda, doesn't trust us.<eos> - Would you?
And you should go reclaim your bedroom.<eos> Taylor has boundary issues.<eos> Is that a bunny?<eos> Okay, so if I don't call your name, that means you're not coming.<eos> All the hot senior guys already got their invites.<eos> Jeanie.<eos> Kristin.<eos> - Sarah.<eos> - She's got to invite us, right?<eos> She'd better.
So, part two.<eos> Here we are.<eos> Only this time, you came back alone.<eos> Why did you come back?<eos> I'm not sure, really.<eos> Let me clarify, I love my wife.<eos> I want her to be happy.<eos> I want good things for her.<eos> But there are times...<eos> - Honey, would you just...
Listen, I just wanted to say... ... that I am really, really sorry about all this.<eos> Your girlfriend says she doesn't know where my plane is.<eos> Either she's a good liar or she likes pain.<eos> Not sure.<eos> You know her better than I do.<eos> What do you think?<eos> Hey, Derek, why don't you just let her go.<eos> Well, you tell me where my plane is and she walks.<eos> - Let me talk to her for a minute.<eos> - I would.
What are your intentions towards her?<eos> Towards them?<eos> There's nothing in the river.<eos> The river's empty.<eos> We wanna go back to England. Please, can we?<eos> - Where's Captain Newport?<eos> - There's nothing to eat.<eos> Captain Newport will be back shortly.<eos> Will he have food?<eos> He'd better.
If you drove out far enough, it started to look like Scotland a little bit.<eos> Oh, oh, I've never been.<eos> Yeah, well, me neither.<eos> But I've seen pictures.<eos> It must be nice living at the beach. Hmmm.<eos> If you can stand the hurricanes.<eos> - Have you been in a bunch?<eos> They always evacuate us.<eos> Some of the old timers like to stick it out, though.<eos> Yeah, I would.
I wish you'd get a life.<eos> I wish you would.<eos> Yes, I know you do.<eos> Toby, I'm telling you, that's the number.<eos> You've gotta believe me.<eos> Oh, come on, Toby, don't be like that.<eos> We're friends. Aren't we friends?<eos> Well, I like you.<eos> Look, would you believe it if Heck told you?<eos> You would?
Do you work out?<eos> - I jog.<eos> - Mmm.<eos> And I used to wrestle in high school.<eos> You've kept yourself in good shape.<eos> Thank you.<eos> So what shall we do?<eos> I'd like to have intercourse with you.<eos> That sounds nice. I'd like that too.<eos> - You would?
How did the meeting go?<eos> What's going on here? Was he...?<eos> Hello?<eos> What a good listener!<eos> Give me my cell phone back.<eos> Huh?<eos> So you're looking for a lady who's hot, rich, and divorced without children?<eos> They're just options.<eos> What I really want is a girl who's never been married.<eos> What man wouldn't?
We're both exiles.<eos> We've both lost a lot of things.<eos> When you say the Mariano will take time, I believe you.<eos> And also when you say I'll get it back. I trust you.<eos> Business apart, we're friends, right?<eos> I told Laura I wanted us to have a baby.<eos> She said never with me.<eos> - Give her time.<eos> - If I was doing it wrong, if I was screwing her up instead of helping her, you'd tell me, right?<eos> I would.
Are you alright?<eos> Not a scratch!<eos> You're a brave boy!<eos> Second Lieutenant Pyo?<eos> How come these villagers don't eat meat?<eos> It is because it caused them so much nuisances?<eos> Why did they bury such a great thing?<eos> Isn't that right, Second Lieutenant Pyo?<eos> Back on base, they'd call me whenever there were any pigs to butcher...<eos> Like that one, I would...
I have nine more years here.<eos> It's a long time, but since I served all those years inside... it's gonna be a lot easier out here.<eos> I'm getting rid of all those things... that I had, you know?<eos> Because of the space I have here.<eos> If it was inside, it's too many people together.<eos> I saw the front and the back.<eos> I wouldn't live there.<eos> I would've gone away.<eos> Would you like to come inside and see my room?<eos> - Yes, we would.
We've got to throw ourselves on the mercy of the court.<eos> - We got to get Andy Griffith.<eos> - Andy Griffith in the suit.<eos> And Michael went to cancel with Rita.<eos> Sorry.<eos> I just wanted to let you know that I'm not going to be needing your passport, after all.<eos> We're just going to go to court, plead guilty-- that'll be that.<eos> So it's bye-bye to Rita, then?<eos> Actually, I was wondering if-if you might want to...<eos> I wouldn't.
Here, see?<eos> Nothing to worry about.<eos> Wyatt is with Mandi.<eos> Mandi?<eos> You let him go with Mandi?<eos> Well, she has sort of been looking out for him lately.<eos> I'm sure he's having the time of his life with her son as we speak.<eos> Really?<eos> Then why is her son still here?<eos> - She would never...
Yes, I know.<eos> You have something to do with this ?<eos> Oh, I assure you, if I'd wanted Miranda Ellis dead, we wouldn't be having this conversation.<eos> But she isn't dead.<eos> She's very much alive.<eos> The thing you need to ask yourself is, why would the love of your life go to such measures to convince the world she was dead ?<eos> What are you talking about ?<eos> Miranda set this whole thing up.<eos> No, she..<eos> Miranda would never...
That guy.<eos> What a mess.<eos> All melted of flesh, but even so, enough will to keep walking.<eos> Body ruined, but still desperate to live.<eos> And he's alive.<eos> Yeah, I wonder if I...<eos> If I were hurt like that...<eos> If you'd keep on walking?<eos> If anyone would know who I was.<eos> I would.
Apparently, someone sent an anonymous letter to his wife.<eos> You blackmailed Ayersman, he performed the surgery, and you ratted him out anyway?<eos> Doesn't seem fair, does it?<eos> You just can't control yourself, can you?<eos> No matter how stupid, how self-destructive...<eos> To make this conversation easier, can we discard the fiction that we're talking about anything other than what I did to you?<eos> You're not mad because I broke into your psychiatrist's office.<eos> Yeah, I was thrilled about that.<eos> Okay, it was a lousy thing to do. But if what I had found was that everything was all kittens and moonbeams in Markville, you'd be over it.<eos> No, I wouldn't!
Hi, Gina.<eos> I have to apologize for exploding at you.<eos> I'm having issues that have nothing to do with you and I need to address them.<eos> Oh, good, you're here.<eos> Joey?<eos> Hold on a second.<eos> What do you want, Gina?<eos> Come.<eos> I found a way to fix things between us.<eos> Yeah, you'd better.
- "Jess-Jess. " - Can you keep a secret?<eos> And he's rich too. Wow. I've never seen anything that big.<eos> Hey, it's not like I haven't offered.<eos> My plain, socially awkward friend is about to marry the best-looking guy I've ever seen.<eos> Good for her. Really. - Can I try this on?<eos> - No. Seth, I got an engagement.<eos> Can you make something frosted and shove this in there somewhere?<eos> A momentous occasion, and they want cake!<eos> Of course, maybe they'll come to you for a wedding fish.<eos> - In Norway they would.
He wants to meet me for a drink.<eos> So what are you thinking?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You know, I'm curious.<eos> He seems like a really nice guy.<eos> Like a perfect guy.<eos> On the other hand, maybe he's an ax murderer.<eos> So...<eos> Would you like me to come along with you?<eos> Would you?
I never noticed those cushions before.<eos> They're darling.<eos> What did you pay for them?<eos> They look so comfortable.<eos> Mind if I try 'em out?<eos> I'd like you to go now, Claire.<eos> Oh, good, because I have a ton of things to do.<eos> You know how it is, though, something always comes up.<eos> What I would like is for you to be in your own house now.<eos> Boy, so would I.
"Mary had a little lamb"...<eos> Meredith had a little lamb, don't bring that lamb to work or it'll poop on the floor...<eos> Hey ! Oscar ! Come on in.<eos> What's up ? - I'm sorry to bother you.<eos> - No not at all come on in.<eos> - What's going on ?<eos> - My nephew is involved with... With charity for Cerebral Palsy, And I was wondering if maybe you would like to.<eos> - You know, if...<eos> A donate to the charity.<eos> Oh God ! 'Course I would.
What do you mean?<eos> I read this book about coming out... and it said that for some parents... finding out your child is gay is like losing a loved one.<eos> AII the dreams they might've had just vanish.<eos> Weddings.<eos> Grandchildren.<eos> So I think when I told them... I shattered some of those dreams for them.<eos> Even though things are still kind of weird... I don't think I've ever been closer to them... 'cause at the end of the day...<eos> I know they still love me.<eos> And that's what worried me the most.<eos> That they wouldn't.
- Did that sound like prejudice to you, Dim?<eos> Am I not being politically correct?<eos> I'm Iraqi.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> My parents left this primitive shithole 30 years ago.<eos> Geez, I thought you were Persian or something.<eos> No, Persians speak Farsi.<eos> I speak Arabic.<eos> - I guess I didn't even know that.<eos> - Yeah, why would you?
It's so perfect.<eos> The only way that I get to get married in a long white gown Is to have my dead baby leaking out of me all day.<eos> That's me.<eos> That's what i get for my wedding.<eos> You're really upset, maybe you shouldn't be drinking.<eos> This glass of champagne is the only thing in my universe right now.<eos> You have me.<eos> You don't really fucking want me.<eos> Not that I blame you.<eos> Who would?
(light bangs off) Ellen:<eos> (whispers) sorry.<eos> Sorry.<eos> (whimpers) sorry!<eos> Maria: (over speaker) miss fanshaw and mr. Breedlove,<eos> (knocks) henry? Can I have a word please?<eos> You see? You see what you've done?<eos> He's not coming out!<eos> He's coming out.<eos> Ellen: I wouldn't.
How much easier would your life be if you were indifferent to me?<eos> So much, since I'm really struggling.<eos> What do you want?<eos> I don't know if you noticed that I got arrested.<eos> Super fun.<eos> This guy came forward, saying he was the 911 caller the night that Felix got killed, and he's attempting to ruin my life.<eos> I thought maybe you could do a little sleuthing for old times' sake.<eos> Really?<eos> Could I?<eos> But why would you, right?
And I went in to sign a permission slip.<eos> And I came back out and that man was dragging him into the car.<eos> Did you recognize him?<eos> No.<eos> Are you sure?<eos> Yes.<eos> Think about it.<eos> He didn't seem familiar in any way?<eos> No.<eos> Why would he?
You know, that's what you get for being the genius.<eos> - I'm home.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Alright, admit it. She's your favorite.<eos> - Okay, she's my favorite.<eos> You're late.<eos> Heard you made a new friend.<eos> Yeah, and she is smoking hot!<eos> - Was she checking me out?<eos> - No. Why would she?
- So he sent you to protect me?<eos> - Yeah, I suppose.<eos> And what happens if you try it on?<eos> How do you mean?<eos> Well, you're a man.<eos> - Yeah, there is that.<eos> - You could try it on right now.<eos> - Well, I wouldn't.<eos> - Why not?<eos> I just wouldn't.
- Is that all?<eos> - And plumbing and electric.<eos> - And furniture.<eos> - Yes, and furniture.<eos> But it's right on the water. And there's a big old barn out there...<eos> I could turn that into my workshop.<eos> Well, what about me?<eos> Now don't I get any say in this?<eos> You want a say in this?<eos> Yes, I would.
- Yeah, they're bad news.<eos> - Well, what do you think?<eos> - You guys are completely nuts.<eos> - That's one way of looking at it. But it's what we've chosen to spend our time on.<eos> I actually brought you here to ask you if you'd like to join us.<eos> Might like to join you guys?<eos> - If I would like to join you?<eos> - That's what I said.<eos> Let me think about it.<eos> - Like hell I would.
No, that's okay. This whole time I felt alone because I never had any opportunities because I never had privacy, but thanks for proving me wrong. L needed that.<eos> Anna, believe me, this is not about you.<eos> Romance is simply not a feasible option for me right now.<eos> Oh, God. Kill me now. L can't even attract some guy who says stupid things like:<eos> "Romance is not a feasible option"?<eos> You know what?<eos> The joke is on you, my friend.<eos> L was just kidding last night.<eos> L would never go through with it.<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
She gives me what I want.<eos> It's a sublimely happy marriage.<eos> Stop.<eos> I wonder how we'll get caught.<eos> Hank will smell you on me at the gym.<eos> No, I mean Terry.<eos> If Hank caught us, I wouldn't care.<eos> I wouldn't stop unless you wanted to, but you probably would.<eos> Wouldn't you?<eos> - No, I wouldn't.
- It's not illegal.<eos> - Rafi is right.<eos> I'm calling because my father is missing. - Do you find me attractive?<eos> I need to know.<eos> Would you go to bed with me?<eos> You're Leni's mother.<eos> - Pretend I'm not.<eos> - It's not easy.<eos> Come on, I want the truth.<eos> Yes, I would.
As you know, we're getting married.<eos> And I wanted to ask you if you'd be my witness...<eos> Witness?<eos> Like: "It was them, your honor.<eos> I saw them behind the bushes.<eos> "Committing unnatural acts.<eos> "Lock 'em up!"<eos> Something like that.<eos> And then you sign your name and then...<eos> Would you?
Hurry up!<eos> Let me write my name too.<eos> Pull with two "P"s.<eos> She hates mistakes.<eos> - Now isn't the time.<eos> - You could be nicer.<eos> You're sure we can't wake her up?<eos> No, when she sleeps, she really does.<eos> - You're sure it'll work?<eos> - Yes. Why wouldn't it?
Sis!<eos> Who did this?<eos> I'll give you three more hours, but this is the last time!<eos> - Jae-won!<eos> - Don't call me that!<eos> It disgusts me!<eos> What if I refuse?<eos> Then you'll die.<eos> She doesn't want to eat.<eos> Who would?
- What's the situation?<eos> We've taken over buildings on either side.<eos> We've got snipers on the roof ready to go.<eos> - Phones?<eos> - We didn't jam the area.<eos> You said he'd know.<eos> - What about infrared?<eos> - He knows we're here.<eos> - What makes you say that?<eos> - Cos I would.
Just gonna let him take her?<eos> She's one of theirs.<eos> They can handle it.<eos> Besides, you heard the man.<eos> We got enough problems of our own to worry about.<eos> Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, Doc?<eos> I'd give you the finger, but apparently... I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off.<eos> A lot of pain?<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.
Actually, Buster had hit a wall in his Army training.<eos> I can't do it;<eos> I can't make my bed, and I can't do this, either--<eos> Aren't you supposed to yell at me and call me "homo"<eos> We can't do that anymore.<eos> Lawsuit.<eos> In fact, it was a recent ruling, prosecuted by the same man who Michael was soon to meet with.<eos> It's going to be a long time before Sergeant Wendell Baker calls someone "Private Homo" again.<eos> God willing, he'll fail boot camp.<eos> Well, why wouldn't he?
Is that who Denny Crane is?<eos> He's not my son.<eos> What do you mean, he's not your son?<eos> His mother slapped me with a paternity suit.<eos> She came back about 10 years later... with a guilty conscience and admitted that I wasn't the father... just deep pockets.<eos> But I liked the kid... so I kept paying for his education and so forth.<eos> Obviously, he doesn't know.<eos> His mother said it would break his heart.<eos> He so liked being... the son of Denny Crane. Hmm.<eos> Who wouldn't?
And what do you think I think it was?<eos> I don't know what you think it was.<eos> But whatever you think it was, it actually wasn't.<eos> Anyway, uh, I thought I would wait until this morning And read what you wrote and see if I was still comfortable with my decision.<eos> And?<eos> And I liked it.<eos> There was some good advice in there, considering you're a guy.<eos> Well, thanks... I think.<eos> Of course, I wouldn't want to sully your good name.<eos> You'd better not.
- Excuse me, does anybody have a mint?<eos> I got a mint.<eos> It's in my pocket.<eos> Do you want me to hand it to you?<eos> It's loose. It's not in a package.<eos> Or do you want to put your hand in my pocket and get it yourself?<eos> You got three options.<eos> You can do one of those two things or you can refuse it.<eos> - There you go.<eos> - Cheryl, honey, would you...
One mississippi.<eos> Two mississippi...<eos> For most kids, the fun of the game isn't in the hiding.<eos> The fun is in being found.<eos> But not for me. I didn't want to be found.<eos> Here I come!<eos> Ever.<eos> Got you.<eos> They'll never find me.<eos> And they never would.
But fourth, well, this camp has a lot more to offer me than $20,000 as long as i don't get killed by the fucking pinkertons.<eos> Why take the chance?<eos> Go see to the grieving fucking widow.<eos> All right, sir.<eos> Mrs. Garret?<eos> What a tragic turn.<eos> Do you require dr. Cochran?<eos> To treat your terrible grief?<eos> Yes. I would like to see the doctor.<eos> Of course, who wouldn't?
Who's operating?<eos> Anspaugh hopefully, and dean.<eos> Ignacio's anesthesia, shirley's circulating.<eos> Good, that's good.<eos> Platelets are here.<eos> Do you want to stay with her?<eos> What?<eos> Would you like to observe?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I would right.
Do you know who I am?<eos> I'm Leland Stottlemeyer.<eos> I read about you, uh...<eos> How's your wife?<eos> My wife is gonna be fine.<eos> The doctors saved her life.<eos> You should call them and thank them, because they saved yours too.<eos> You might wanna let the lieutenant hold that for you.<eos> Are you afraid I'll use it?<eos> I would.
Uh, dreams of vampires.<eos> I dig vampire dreams. Oh, Tony sure doesn't.<eos> - Well, that's silly.<eos> - Oh, but fear of going into autopsy, which you've done your entire career, isn't?<eos> Of course it is, but it doesn't change anything.<eos> I can't even take the elevator to the basement anymore.<eos> - Wow<eos> - Yeah<eos> So you want me to take this evidence down to Ducky?<eos> - Would you?
My break-even is 212 people.<eos> My shots are dispensed by a machine to prevent any free drinks, and I have internal controls to insure that all cash is accounted for.<eos> What's the deal with your hair?<eos> How do you think a guy from Lexington Park ends up an hour away at a party in Alexandria?<eos> It's easy.<eos> It's a Darin Spotnitz party.<eos> Put a name brand on it, you know it's a name brand.<eos> I mean, no one ever thought to put a brand name on a party till I did it.<eos> - Sorry. I should take this.<eos> - I wouldn't.
-So could I.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.<eos> What?<eos> Marry me.<eos> -Stop it.<eos> -What?<eos> Would you?
He sees it.<eos> Come on.<eos> So... have I atoned for my sins?<eos> That would take an eternity.<eos> But you sure as hell get an "A" for effort.<eos> Please don't say hell.<eos> By the way, I happen to agree with you.<eos> I was damn lucky to get those four extra years.<eos> Sure I'd have liked more.<eos> Who wouldn't?
Yeah, well, I used to trust that. You still can.<eos> Just give me tonight to prove it.<eos> You got tonight.<eos> What?<eos> -Thought we were playing it tight. -We are.<eos> You put us all at risk without letting us have a say.<eos> Over guns we got nothing to do with.<eos> And I'd do it again.<eos> Well, I wouldn't.<eos> I wouldn't.
I just want to get on that boat and go home!<eos> Well, you don't need a boat cause you can walk!<eos> What did those women expect?<eos> When you sign a contract with FOX, you know you're going to be betrayed and humiliated.<eos> Quiet, the commercial's on!<eos> If we don't watch these, it's like we're stealing tv.<eos> Do you love that sooo-weet smell of farmer Billy's bacon?<eos> Do I ever!<eos> Would you like to see how a pig goes from loving life to your fork and knife?<eos> Would I!
Mom did it.<eos> I walked in and I found her.<eos> - That's what I repressed.<eos> - Don't you dare.<eos> I won't let you desecrate your mother's memory like that.<eos> I don't blame her.<eos> I blame you.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> Your mother loved Julian.<eos> She would never...
But, judging by your success, it seems you made the right choice.<eos> I'm not so sure sometimes.<eos> I mean, all the pressure, the hours, putting up with the media... it gets to you after a while.<eos> Maybe I should work here.<eos> Dead people are much less demanding.<eos> Actually, you'd be surprised.<eos> Look, I know this probably seems crazy... but, Erin, she never likes my boyfriends, and I really want her to like you.<eos> - Relax.<eos> She's gonna love me.<eos> - Well, she'd better.
I did a pretty good business with a couple neighbor ladies and the divorcees from the next town over.<eos> But the only customer I ever really wanted was my dad.<eos> Every day, I'd watch him come home from work, and I pray that he'd stop. But he never did.<eos> And I'd think to myself, "Why ? Why ?<eos> What kind of man doesn't want a roadside manicure from his own son ?"<eos> I can't believe I repeated that cycle with you.<eos> - Well, you did.<eos> - Well, I'm sorry, Elliot.<eos> - I'd let you give me a manicure.<eos> - You would ?
Not gonna happen.<eos> This isn't about ankle straps in a two-and-a-half star hotel, is it?<eos> Because the alumni dinner ended an hour ago and I could be back in DC right now...<eos> That's the old me, Terri.<eos> Everything I got now, my wife, my kids... I would not risk losing them.<eos> No way.<eos> Seeing you with your old gang made me think bad thoughts.<eos> Your friends cheapen you, Tommy.<eos> You're just pissed off that they didn't recognize you when you walked in.<eos> And why would they?
And I won't allow my people to do that.<eos> Our feeling is that it's genuinely an aberration.<eos> And if it repeats itself next month... then it bears closer examination.<eos> Otherwise...<eos> Moving on to new business, then.<eos> How are we fixed for witness assistance?<eos> Does the Department have sufficient funds to ensure pre-trial security... for any endangered witnesses?<eos> We have the resources that the city can afford, I'm sure.<eos> I understand you're in no position to criticize the Mayor.<eos> - Nor would I.
You get pregnant out of wedlock?<eos> You must be possessed.<eos> Bam!<eos> They tie you down, tie you down and cast the demon out.<eos> I'm just curious...<eos> How exactly would they accomplish this sort of thing?<eos> Someone took all her dreams away.<eos> What was is no more.<eos> I mean, it's not like she wanted to end up sleeping in a barrel.<eos> Who would?
Mememe!<eos> I'm first!<eos> I'm first!<eos> Ooooh, let's go ride the choo-choo train!<eos> Choo-choo train!<eos> Yay!<eos> Let's ride the train!<eos> The train!<eos> Would you like to ride the train with me, and start a magical journey?<eos> Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson.
Hey!<eos> Stay away!<eos> You hear me? ! We found you, you pickpocketing bastard!<eos> Hey, hold it! Where are you going? !<eos> I got unfinished business with that guy!<eos> There's nowhere for you to run now.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I can't get arrested by those guys, not now. Then I'll be a decoy!<eos> You run away while I have everybody's attention.<eos> Why would you--
No matter what they do, the doctors can't find the reason... why I'm unable to conceive.<eos> What does Muad'dib say?<eos> Muad'dib is afraid.<eos> He fears for me if I have another child.<eos> I can feel it.<eos> He may be right to fear.<eos> Someone has been feeding you a poison.<eos> It's the only possibility left.<eos> But the doctors have never found evidence.<eos> They wouldn't.
Look, I love women.<eos> I do.<eos> Whether they're four, 40, or my 88-year-old grandmother, I respect women, all right?<eos> And I also listen to women, and that's why I can sell myself to any woman, anywhere, anytime.<eos> Make a woman fall in love with diamonds, Benjamin... or with you?<eos> Eh, either one.<eos> Well, that's cocky, Ben.<eos> No, not cocky, confident.<eos> I'd like to see you prove that.<eos> You would?
Where's your grand piano?<eos> I had to turn it over. And Fabian his violin. The telephone, the radio... all our books and records, everything of any value at all.<eos> I had to turn over my dog.<eos> And my canary.<eos> Yes. Aryan canaries are not to sing for Jews.<eos> Ridiculous.<eos> Humiliating.<eos> I cried for three days.<eos> Does the general know about this?<eos> How would he?
I took the liberty of checking.<eos> Historical inventories of the Luna Temple do not list any orb.<eos> Then I want you both to list every orb ever mentioned in Greek history.<eos> Every one?<eos> Ya!<eos> That's... liable... to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you gentlemen would like some tea while you wait?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
I didn't know it'd be, you know...<eos> Older people?<eos> - That's okay.<eos> - Older than me, say.<eos> Are you a little shy, Oscar?<eos> I think you are.<eos> I think you're very nice, too.<eos> Would you like to come home with me?<eos> I know, I can't believe I said it, either.<eos> But would you?
I'm going to Mathilde's.<eos> Jakob?<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Jakob?<eos> Can I stay here?<eos> Just on the floor?<eos> Do you want to come up here?<eos> Would you like to do it?<eos> If you would.
You're not vampires.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Two Skinny Dudes.<eos> Like, me, too.<eos> We're the band Two Skinny Dudes.<eos> I'm Barry and this is my brother Harry.<eos> Finally.<eos> I've heard so much about you from Russell.<eos> Glad you made it here all right.<eos> Why wouldn't we?
It's none of your business.<eos> I thought Eddie wasn't coming.<eos> I guess he was just late.<eos> The material we found in Rebecca McCormick's wound was nylon thread with fragments of ostrich feather.<eos> Oh, I know that look. We're going back to Lady Heather's.<eos> I can take care of this myself.<eos> Gil, do me a favor. Get a sports car.<eos> It's a lot cheaper and easier to handle.<eos> I'd like to come in.<eos> Of course you would.
How about this, uh, ponytail guy?<eos> You starting to recognize him?<eos> Maybe you met him at a bar... a club?<eos> That wasn't me.<eos> What you're saying... that wasn't how it was.<eos> Then tell us, Rosie, how it was.<eos> Uh, Toya... loved her... her... butterfly wind chimes.<eos> I put'em up in a window... for her.<eos> Then he'd come at night... late at night.<eos> Who would?
It's happening already.<eos> I spoke with MacReady.<eos> He agrees that, in light of recent events... some of your laws might be a little outdated.<eos> Before people could travel through space to other planets... they had to get off the ground first.<eos> Almost 40 years after my human ancestors left Earth... two brothers from Ohio became the first human beings... to build a successful flying machine.<eos> Their names were Orville and Wilbur Wright.<eos> Would anyone like to see a picture of their aeroplane?<eos> - Me.<eos> - Yes, ma'am.<eos> You all would.
I think she's upset.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm 10, not stupid.<eos> So why don't you go talk to her, try to make her feel better?<eos> How am I supposed to do that?<eos> I don´t know.<eos> Go tell her that she has nice hair or thatyou like her sweater or something.<eos> Why don't you go tell her?<eos> Because I think it would mean more coming from you.<eos> Why would she -
I just... I got some things on my mind.<eos> So what are you doing?<eos> Colin and I were supposed to see a movie but he's really late.<eos> We'll probably have to catch the next one.<eos> - Did you want to hang out with us?<eos> - No I should get home.<eos> But you'll invite me to your recital right?<eos> I mean when it happens.<eos> You'd want to come?<eos> Of course I would.
Sam? Sam?<eos> I want to drive!<eos> Irma started out growing just a few plants to help her husband.<eos> Oh, now, hold on.<eos> I was Dixon Ferdonia´s physician for years even during his unfortunate battle with cancer.<eos> -He never said anything to me.<eos> -That´s not surprising.<eos> Many patients are uncomfortable discussing it with traditional practitioners. I´m sure you did all you could to help him.<eos> -What are you implying?<eos> -Nothing, but what would you...
Hey, maybe I can fix that. You know, try to turn it into something else.<eos> Oh, don't even bother.<eos> We've already ruined her first birthday.<eos> And do you know how important these early experiences are, Ross?<eos> Very! According to the back cover of that book that you gave me.<eos> Rach, she's not gonna remember this.<eos> I guess.<eos> Oh, I just had such an idea of what this day would be like, you know?<eos> Emma laughing and everybody gathered around her cake, singing "Happy Birthday."<eos> And then we would all...
Why should she?<eos> She knows you'll be along any second to do it for her.<eos> Mom, why do you always make everything so hard?<eos> Don't you understand, this is my last night with my daughter!<eos> She goes off to college tomorrow!<eos> I know, which is why I was so surprised you didn't want to spend the evening with her.<eos> - I do!<eos> - Then you should've come!<eos> - I couldn't!<eos> - You wouldn't!
I'm still on probation as far as this city concerned<eos> We used to always go somewhere for Christmas<eos> Well, thing how it would be for Kevin<eos> Putting him in that same old situation where he has to look at the difference<eos> He needs to start looking at something, besides MTV<eos> There's no rule that says he has to bounce back right away?<eos> It's been a year and a half since the accident<eos> If he did something<eos> If he got a job, I think he'd feel better<eos> He would? Or you would?
-Sean's not the cheating kind.<eos> -That's not necessarily true.<eos> 70°% of all men cheat.<eos> The statistics are astounding.<eos> No, I'm disturbed by this.<eos> A plastic surgeon giving his mistress implants... so that she can be more sexually uninhibited with him.<eos> Don't you find that unsettling?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> Who am I talking with?<eos> Of course you wouldn't.
- I was just following orders.<eos> - I know. - Go ahead. Let it all out.<eos> - You don't understand. You can't say no to him.<eos> - To who?<eos> - Armadillo.<eos> You work for Armadillo?<eos> You've seen him in town?<eos> No. Everything goes through Duardo.<eos> - You know where we can find Armadillo?<eos> - No, but Duardo would.
- That man is an idiot.<eos> - And yet, you let him direct Hamlet. Why?<eos> - Darren Nichols?<eos> - Stop it!<eos> - Let's move on. - Please.<eos> You, Geoffrey Tennant, are a coward.<eos> Fardels!<eos> Fardels.<eos> So... Would you care to comment on any other productions currently onstage at the festival?<eos> Yes, Oliver, I would.
Those codes are in his head.<eos> That's right, I remember everything.<eos> Everything! It's all in here, bro, and you ain't getting none of it.<eos> Now, either charge me or let me see my lawyer, government man.<eos> (Radio) 'Target's proceeding through lobby.'<eos> (Danny) Durand and Hastings are on the move.<eos> (Ruth) 'They're selling to the Chinese.<eos> Keep Jean-Luc distracted.'<eos> - He knows we're on to them.<eos> - 'How? ' Because I would.
His impression of our buffet table seemed favorable. - Katie.<eos> - Is there concern this cultural exchange confers legitimacy on the North Korean regime?<eos> It's hoped exchanges help bring light to such places nudging them toward more open policies.<eos> Is he free to go where he pleases?<eos> His mother didn't want him hitting clubs but, as far as I know, he's seeing the sights even as we speak.<eos> Moving to the economy, do today's unemployment figures indicate recession?<eos> Recession means two consecutive quarters of negative growth.<eos> That's not the situation.<eos> How would you characterize the economy, then?<eos> - I wouldn't.
See for yourself... "what he ca res for, you or family? Is he taking you with him?"<eos> If he isn't ta king you along... then you shall do your mother's bidding<eos> Stop Dave!<eos> I won't let you leave!<eos> Stop.<eos> - Out of my way<eos> "That night, all sense of reasoning deserted me"<eos> "I was left vacillating as if between pendulous scales"<eos> "You wouldn't want me to displease my father to make you happy..."<eos> would you?
Now I see 'em everywhere.<eos> - There was one bouncing against my office window yesterday.<eos> A real one.<eos> She had bought over the Internet... a mobile to put on the baby's crib... of dragonflies.<eos> And then this thing last night with the paperweight.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you are literally going buggy living in that house.<eos> Yeah, you should move.<eos> You're rummaging around in an empty nursery. You're living with a talking parrot who won't even speak to you.<eos> Never would.
Is there something I can do?<eos> No, David.<eos> I need to take Lilo home now.<eos> We have a lot to talk about, you know.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You know, I really believed they had a chance.<eos> Then you came along.<eos> Lilo, honey, we have to...<eos> Don't worry. You're nice, and someone will give you a job.<eos> I would.
At the end, the boy kills himself by jumping over a bridge.<eos> The second story was pretty much the same as the first... except, at the end, the boy kills himself by drinking a bottle of bug poison.<eos> Your stories are intense.<eos> I just want to leave some kind of legacy.<eos> Something great.<eos> And after that, I don't care what happens to me.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> I wish there was a story about me.<eos> I don't know who would read it, though.<eos> I would.
- That's not what you wanted.<eos> - True.<eos> At least you know she's not out of her mind.<eos> You know what, we're not talking about May anymore.<eos> I've successfully escaped that lunatic.<eos> Who's May?<eos> Some weird chick Adam just dumped.<eos> How's your lip?<eos> Stow it, all right?<eos> Would you, please?
I honestly don't know.<eos> I'll know it when I see it.<eos> Would you?<eos> - I'm sorry, forget it.<eos> - What?<eos> I was gonna ask if you wanted to go someplace more quiet.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to stay here.<eos> Right.<eos> - I would....
The light's on your left.<eos> I'll make tea.<eos> Don't worry about it.<eos> Wait in the living-room.<eos> This is quite the collection.<eos> Are they all classical?<eos> Yep.<eos> I don't see any CDs.<eos> I only listen to records.<eos> You would, wouldn't you.
- Be serious! - She was alive.<eos> So you're idiots!<eos> To see if the person's dead, you check the pulse first.<eos> Did they check it?

If you can get us past Highland, we've got a good shot.<eos> - Like you could do better?<eos> - We'll see.<eos> - You think Coach'd start you at quarterback?<eos> - Just saying.<eos> The quarterback is the most important member.<eos> He is like the rudder that guides the ship.<eos> - Right.<eos> Could I give you a hand with that?<eos> - Would you really?
I am one, and who am I?<eos> Why me?<eos> I don't think it was about you, Nick. Or Jane Galloway, for that matter.<eos> I think it was more about Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs.<eos> His premise is that social beings strive to belong.<eos> In Nigel's mind,<eos> Jane Galloway was someone he could control, which was okay for a while, but you... you were someone he could actually become.<eos> See, Maslow's fifth tier of the Hierarchy is Self-Actualization. I am one, and who am I?<eos> The problem for Nigel is that you would have to die in order for that to happen.<eos> Or else he would.
