Few more days.<eos> Be worth the wait.<eos> ~ Hi.<eos> ~ Hi.<eos> I, er... just wondered if you had anything for me.<eos> Well, we're hoping to trace the location of his last meal.<eos> Should have something first thing.<eos> But you knew that.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
Home-made tattoos.<eos> A dot for each stretch.<eos> Simons was in and out of juvenile detention from the age of 12.<eos> They closed down the borstals 30 years ago.<eos> I guess "Youth custody centre spots" doesn't have the same ring to it.<eos> Simons was a heavy smoker until a few years ago.<eos> You'd think you'd see signs of some discolouration in the pleura.<eos> His notes also say he's had an appendectomy.<eos> Could have sworn I just saw his appendix.<eos> I did.
Well, did it ever occur to you that I might be thinking the exact same thing?<eos> I can't tell you this is definitely gonna work out. There's no guarantees.<eos> But if this turns out to be a mistake then let's make it the most fun big fucking mistake we ever made.<eos> So I'll see you at home later?<eos> Yeah, which one? That's right.<eos> We still gotta decide that.<eos> Um... Mine.<eos> Hey.<eos> You came back after all.<eos> I did.
I'll...<eos> I'll fuel up the jet. I love eating on that jet.<eos> Ooh, lunch is out.<eos> Threepeat and I have a cake tasting in an hour.<eos> That's right.<eos> Ooh, actually, I will do the tasting.<eos> You've got a dress to fit into.<eos> I could come with.<eos> Who... who doesn't like cake?<eos> Well, you don't.
Boy, Threepeat, you sure are swamped with work.<eos> You certainly don't have time for any outside activities.<eos> Seriously?<eos> That's the best you could do?<eos> Yes. Unlike you, I have real work to do.<eos> This wouldn't have happened if you'd come to rehearsal.<eos> What the hell's going on out here?<eos> ! He's putting on some kind of terrible play.<eos> Do you want to help plan this wedding or not?<eos> Of course I do.
Okay.<eos> That's fine.<eos> Okay. (sniffles)<eos> Loreen on phone: Honey, it's late.<eos> - Were you sleeping?<eos> - No.<eos> Mommy, I just saw a baby get born, okay?<eos> Not a whole baby.<eos> First it was just the foot and then it was the rest of the baby.<eos> But I did.
Idealistic.<eos> I feel like buying girl scout cookies from her.<eos> She's got a theory on the crime?<eos> Yeah, and I agree with her.<eos> We all think you're half right.<eos> Your childhood enemies are thieves.<eos> And arsonists.<eos> No, just thieves.<eos> And Gravely wants to catch this firebug before it kills someone.<eos> We all do.
Don.<eos> Don.<eos> Draper!<eos> Oh, Melanie. I'm sorry.<eos> I must have overslept.<eos> They're coming before work. I told your service, but you never called me back.<eos> There's no time for a shower.<eos> I'll make the bed.<eos> Thought you were having the carpets cleaned.<eos> I did.
- Can I help you?<eos> - Get out.<eos> What's going on?<eos> I tried your little saying and I'm off the business.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> I made your joke and it failed miserably.<eos> - The soap thing?<eos> - No! The one where I told them they were assholes.<eos> You could have thought of something yourself, you know.<eos> I did.
- You have an agent?<eos> - I do.<eos> I have an agent.<eos> It's--it's an escort service, actually. - Uh-huh. - But they take 20%, and with the baby-style convention in town, talk about an underserved community.<eos> Right.<eos> I get to pick myself.<eos> So, bas--you can-- You can actually eyeball a woman from across the room and decide whether you want to, um, "date" her.<eos> Exactly.<eos> Which means you did actually pick me.<eos> I did.
- What are you doing?<eos> - What does it look like?<eos> Waiting for Harry Selfridge?<eos> He won't be coming round again.<eos> What?<eos> I did what you said.<eos> I told him I needed to take a step back.<eos> You were right.<eos> I should never have slept with him in the first place.<eos> But you did.
Obviously, the ground is waterlogged.<eos> I wonder, it doesn't seem to be in the plans.<eos> Where do you want me to dig the sump well?<eos> I thought we agreed here... in the end.<eos> Did we not?<eos> Very good.<eos> Very good.<eos> This is bloody ridiculous.<eos> - I don't know what I'm talking about.<eos> - Well, I do.
You're not who I thought you were.<eos> You're a cheat.<eos> You're a liar.<eos> You're a stranger.<eos> I'm not going to call the police.<eos> But I never want to see you again.<eos> Crawl back under your stone.<eos> But I love you!<eos> You don't know what the word means.<eos> I didn't before, but I do now.
Ground, please.<eos> Gus?<eos> Are you here?<eos> Gus?<eos> JACQUES: I'm so glad you agreed to come out with me.<eos> Why have you brought me here?<eos> I think you know why.<eos> Past history is best faced before you move on.<eos> Who says I want to move on?<eos> I do.
- Hundy-p.<eos> We're friends.<eos> Just, not friends with benefits.<eos> Elizabeth: One, two, check.<eos> Check, check.<eos> Testing.<eos> One, two, three...<eos> We hear you, loud and clear, Beth.<eos> Do you hear us?<eos> I sure do.
Because...<eos> Bo, can you hear me.<eos> Just say, he broke the law.<eos> He signed a contract. It's black and white...<eos> No.<eos> No, what? Ms. Dennis?<eos> No... one ever noticed you.<eos> The law isn't what matters here.<eos> You feel like Philip doesn't value you.<eos> But he does.
And now, you're fired.<eos> I believe that's my line.<eos> You know what they say, it's better to burn out than be a total asshole.<eos> Don't play with fire... unless you... can handle... the burn.<eos> Hera: Zee, no!<eos> Don't send me back to Myth.<eos> Don't you remember how bored we both were?<eos> This isn't the end, love.<eos> You trust me don't you?<eos> I do.
The same version as the cops.<eos> I can't tell my family I was an accomplice to murder.<eos> Spare me that look.<eos> Karine and I don'! share the same brain, 0k.<eos> - Have you ever lied to her?<eos> - Of course.<eos> Loads of times.<eos> Loads of times?<eos> Of course I lie. Don'! you?<eos> Well I do.
I know you don't want to be alone.<eos> I like you, Harry, but you can't just look to the closest person to fill the void.<eos> No, no, it's not like that.<eos> You've got it all wrong.<eos> I-I don't think I have.<eos> - Please, can't we just forget this conversation ever happened?<eos> - Nancy, please!<eos> - It's all right.<eos> Do you have happy memories of your childhood?<eos> Yes, I do.
- Are you roommates?<eos> - No, that's my dad.<eos> - You have kids?<eos> - Well, he's more like a buddy.<eos> Are you for real?<eos> You're my dad even though they're here.<eos> - You're 24, you take care of yourself.<eos> - Just how old are you?<eos> - You said you were 35.<eos> - I did?
You drop in the fifth, we're clearing 70%.<eos> - Right.<eos> - Come on, Jackie!<eos> It's time to celebrate.<eos> It's the big time, Jack.<eos> Thanks for the offer.<eos> I'm gonna take a pass.<eos> Did he just say "pass"?<eos> I appreciate everything you've done for me.<eos> Really, I do.
Work the ER at Metro-General.<eos> A few weeks ago, cops bring in three men.<eos> Said they were robbing tourists, beating them up pretty bad.<eos> Apparently, a man in a black mask took issue with their activities and decided to step in.<eos> I counted nine broken bones between them.<eos> A few days after that, EMTs bring in a 19-year-old waitress, said... some guy she knew waited for her after work in the parking lot, attacked her... tried to drag her in the alley.<eos> She said she screamed and screamed, and a man in a black mask heard her... and he saved her life.<eos> So, yeah, word's getting around.<eos> And I want to believe in what you're doing.<eos> I really do.
There was a little fire in the fireplace, and we all huddled around in a circle and closed our eyes, and then...<eos> Well, all right. That's great.<eos> You kids want some candy?<eos> Don't know.<eos> Depends, I guess.<eos> Manson: Depends on what?<eos> Chunky chocolate, Taffy bits, marshmallows?<eos> You... you don't know if you like that stuff?<eos> -I know I do.<eos> -Course you do.
Do you renew your commitment to this woman as your lawful wedded wife, to love her, honor her, comfort her, keep her in sickness and in health, forsaking all others, be true to her, as long as you both shall live?<eos> I do.

- Honey, don't... is this really the best place for a confrontation like this?<eos> Cassie Cranston.<eos> Heather Murray.<eos> Or, is it Mitchell now?<eos> On behalf of beaver's Ridge welcoming committee, I would like to formally let you know that you are not welcome.<eos> That is, you are not welcome here.<eos> Wow.<eos> As far as condolences go, that was original.<eos> Did I go something?<eos> You did something to this entire town.
- Yeah. -Like, we're all... we are all together...<eos> - In the private thing...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> ...where you touch each other's nipples and you fuck each other?<eos> - How do you know... what are you...<eos> - stop trying to invite me how do I not know about the orgy?<eos> Bruce is all over town.<eos> And you need to talk to that guy because everybody in this town is gonna know what you idiots are up to.<eos> Okay, okay, okay. So he did Bruce invite you to it, already?<eos> - Yes, he did.
What?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> This town sucks, it's always sucked.<eos> So... I am out of here.<eos> I don't want to become like my cousin Heather.<eos> You know, just settle for somebody just because they're there.<eos> You should do the same.<eos> Or not, I don't know.<eos> It's not really fair for me to say it, I guess.<eos> You do you.
Okay, and Abby and I will take upstairs.<eos> If you find what those little shits are on, I got first dibs.<eos> I guess I'll just, um, keep watch down here.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Okay, let's do it.<eos> I'm just gonna, um-- I'm gonna check the bathroom.<eos> I looked in Lilly's room and Charlie's room.<eos> I didn't find anything.<eos> Did you?<eos> I did.
But if you were or are...<eos> You may want to keep it?<eos> God.<eos> A baby.<eos> Am I crazy to think it was easier then?<eos> - When the kids were little?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're totally insane.<eos> - I miss it.<eos> - You do?

I should have killed him.<eos> There are many things you should and should not have done, Carlo.<eos> What do you imply, brother?<eos> It's time we notified the Architect.<eos> Our leader is a man of some note.<eos> To make unscheduled contact would put his life at risk.<eos> You're being hunted by Italy's most ingenious mind.<eos> You have placed the future of the Labyrinth in jeopardy.<eos> Tell me where to find him.<eos> - You don't.
Minx?<eos> I made some snacks for you and Henry.<eos> Where are you?<eos> Upstairs?<eos> Kids?<eos> Hello?<eos> Oh, my goodness, you gave me a fright!<eos> Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.<eos> Didn't you hear me calling?<eos> No, I didn't.
I said to your mama since the day you was born how dumb you was.<eos> You know why I call you Cricket?<eos> Because that's what you sound like.<eos> Every time you speak, it makes my skin crawl.<eos> And tonight... tonight it took the power of the Almighty for me not to squash you while you was chirping away in church.<eos> Daddy.<eos> Please.<eos> - Don't make it worse.<eos> Please.<eos> - Please don't.
No, no, it's a risk, I know, but I'll be with you the whole time and I'll be ready to inject you if the fever starts to take you.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Abby.<eos> Abby, this is a chance to cure you.<eos> You know, it would give you your life back.<eos> But can you be sure it won't take my life instead?<eos> No. I can't.<eos> My father... tended to Secretary of State Seward on the night Lincoln was shot.<eos> Did you know he was attacked, too?<eos> I didn't.
Who wants more peas?<eos> I'll definitely have some.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Cigars and scotch.<eos> This is a first for us.<eos> I suppose I should have done this with you sooner.<eos> You're a man now. And you'll need to be as I have good reason for having you here for a talk.<eos> You do?<eos> You noticed your mother struggling at dinner.<eos> Yes, I did.
Camels.<eos> NPR.<eos> Ironically, there is a bathroom less than ten feet away from us.<eos> Not helping.<eos> Scorched earth.<eos> Burnt toast.<eos> Would you please just go out there?<eos> No, I will not.<eos> You don't have a choice!<eos> Yes, I do.
This is exactly like when we went fly-fishing.<eos> You have always tried to get AnnaBeth and I to be closer, so we can be this tight little trio.<eos> Not again!<eos> I mean, when are you gonna stop doing that?<eos> And that's why we're here.<eos> This is a scheme within a scheme!<eos> Mm-hmm! Lemon: Okay, well, excuse me for wanting the two of you to see in each other what I do.<eos> Okay? Oh! Do you remember that time she got us lost in the woods looking for firewood and tried to get us to bond over our hatred of our history teacher?<eos> (laughing):<eos> I do. I do.
None taken.<eos> I'm telling you, she wants something.<eos> Oh, I just think she wants us to be happy.<eos> I mean, she knows what a hard time I've been having getting over Lavon.<eos> What's that face?<eos> What face?<eos> I didn't make a face.<eos> You made a "I know something" face.<eos> You know something!<eos> No, I don't.
No! No, it's not.<eos> You-you know what?<eos> You're probably right,<eos> Lemon's just trying to do a nice thing here.<eos> Getting over...<eos> Lavon.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> Lemon has feelings for Lavon again, doesn't she?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I honestly don't.
I can't believe you, Lemon.<eos> You're trying to get George and I together, so that you can run off with Lavon, guilt-free?<eos> No... do not look at me.<eos> AnnaBeth, I-I promise it-it-it wasn't like that.<eos> (scoffs) I saw you and George at the Butter Stick and, and you seemed so... you looked so... cute. (laughs)<eos> You were both laughing and, um... that's where it all started from.<eos> I-I-I... I swear, I just... (sighs)<eos> I want you to be happy...<eos> AnnaBeth.<eos> I really do.
_<eos> That's for my work, Detective.<eos> "Stuff for boys 9 to 12"?<eos> I'm a set decorator.<eos> For the movies.<eos> And you have no right to be down here going through my things.<eos> - You don't have a search warrant. - You can see how it might look suspicious for someone with your history.<eos> It breaks my heart what happened to that little boy.<eos> Do you know what happened to that little boy, Mr. Trent?<eos> No, I don't.
Do you have information about the case?<eos> Hold on.<eos> Harry.<eos> Guy say she's Nicholas Trent's lawyer.<eos> He refuses to talk to anyone but you.<eos> This is Detective Bosch.<eos> How can I help you?<eos> Do you have Nicholas Trent?<eos> Sir, we do not have your client in custody.<eos> No, sir, we do not.
Did they tell you they got ripped off by Ferraro?<eos> - No.<eos> - Then why am I here?<eos> Because this alley is directly between our fourth-grader's house and her school.<eos> You speak Spanish?<eos> A little. My French and Italian are better, but when I was in grade school, I could reach three countries on my bike from my house.<eos> Yet none of those countries speak Spanish.<eos> The Spanish I learned in Tehran.<eos> They speak Spanish in Iran?<eos> Spanish teachers do.
One.<eos> Two.<eos> Three.<eos> That was like a group mugging.<eos> - (Prince inhales) - People in New York are fucking nuts.<eos> Oh, fuck this.<eos> I need a real smoke.<eos> Oh. Hello.<eos> I think I hurt this guy and he's gonna come here looking for me.<eos> He already did.
Well, what did he tell you?<eos> Enough for me to know it would be unethical if somebody didn't look into this.<eos> But you can't, so you want me to get Harvey to.<eos> Well, you convinced him to look into my case when he didn't want to, didn't you?<eos> This is different.<eos> We don't take cases like this.<eos> Maybe, but I believe a man who can convince Harvey to hire someone who never went to law school could convince him to make an exception for this.<eos> What?<eos> He didn't tell you I know.<eos> No, he didn't.

If I gave you something too needy, it would intimidate you, and you would let it die.<eos> You expect me to believe that's why you're really here?<eos> Of course not.<eos> I'm here to stop you from doing what you're gonna do in an hour:<eos> crash Mike's meeting.<eos> Donna, I can't have him risking our other business.<eos> It was one client, and you covered it.<eos> And if he drags this to trial, it will be every client.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I want you to put the brakes on him before this gets out of control.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna do that.<eos> - Harvey.<eos> - Jessica, it's one case.<eos> He asked me to trust him, and I'm gonna do it, and if you're ever gonna be able to enjoy a vacation, you're gonna have to trust me.<eos> All right.<eos> Good night.<eos> Bon voyage.<eos> You do know that doesn't mean "good night."<eos> Of course I do.
I take it you heard about Liberty Rail.<eos> - I did.<eos> - See?<eos> No harm, no foul, no mass exodus of clients.<eos> I'm glad.<eos> What's on your mind, Jessica?<eos> You don't seem--<eos> I know you told Scottie about Mike Ross.<eos> How'd you know?<eos> I didn't till just now.
Nothing's changed.<eos> I just don't want to lie to him anymore.<eos> He told you he loved you, didn't he?<eos> When the hell did you start figuring shit like that out?<eos> I didn't till just now.<eos> Then answer my question.<eos> What made you decide to tell Scottie?<eos> That's not what you really want to know.<eos> What you want to know is if I wish I told her sooner.<eos> Do you?
~ Ready?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> If I could get a proper grip... ~ Try again.<eos> ~ Ready?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> OK.<eos> Go for it.<eos> And don't stop, no matter what.<eos> ~ Are you sure?<eos> ~ Just do it!
The babies.<eos> If you go up those stairs right now, I'm not gonna be here when you get back.<eos> I'm going back to school.<eos> I called in to see if I can get into the dorms early.<eos> You are going to the psych ward or a fucking ER.<eos> Ian.<eos> Ian!<eos> Yevgeny!<eos> Hey, you came back after all.<eos> I did.
- The victim's sister.<eos> - Oh, did the victim give you her number?<eos> No.<eos> Then how exactly did you know where to reach her?<eos> What the fuck was that all about?<eos> Is it really your business?<eos> Did you spend the night with that asshole?<eos> What do you care?<eos> Well, I care, because Captain Fucking Rayburn is the douchiest shit bag in that whole fucking family.<eos> You did.
They'll reach a nice confused man named Art who works at GPP Security.<eos> And the cops will never get here in time.<eos> So I suggest you talk to me.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> To show you the truth, Emma.<eos> - About what?<eos> - Who you really are.<eos> And trust me, it's gonna hurt.<eos> You don't know me.<eos> But I do.
Yeah, that is interesting.<eos> W-what's interesting?<eos> Well, it appears that Jenna had appropriated your wife's personal style.<eos> She didn't appropriate you, too, did he... she... he?<eos> You didn't kill Jason for inappropriately appropriating your husband, did you?<eos> - What?<eos> !<eos> - Are you insane?<eos> I would never do that, and I liked Jason.<eos> No, you didn't.
No.<eos> She slept with him.<eos> So she was a lesbian.<eos> Her husband didn't know anything about it, and she'd like to keep it that way.<eos> She only told me because I'm a minister.<eos> You did that on purpose.<eos> Did she admit to giving him the silver soda pop?<eos> Okay, who is "she" now?<eos> The lawyer.<eos> And, no, she didn't.

Come on, I can wash it.<eos> Ah, thanks, but anything you put your penis in belongs to you.<eos> So why you home so early, birthday boy?<eos> I wanted time to hang my Restaurateur of Tomorrow plaque.<eos> I'm gonna buy some birthday jeans and then check on the restaurant before my surprise party.<eos> That is a fantastic idea, 'cause the whole place has just been falling apart since you been gone.<eos> In fact, you should probably head over there right now.<eos> There could be a fire.<eos> - I mean, who knows?<eos> You don't. - All right.
I think I might've liked it better when it was just you, my mom, and a genetically modified cucumber.<eos> I mean, now it's... it's what?<eos> It's you, my mom, and a cucumber in love?<eos> We never really used the...<eos> - Oh, God.<eos> - Not important.<eos> All right, the point is we're not in love.<eos> No, of course you're not in love.<eos> You don't know what love is!<eos> Oh, and you do?
Okay, Harrison, no!<eos> Take the bear!<eos> So, uh, what are we doing here, exactly?<eos> We're having the best day ever.<eos> - It doesn't smell like we are.<eos> - Trust me.<eos> This is where I bring all the truly special birds.<eos> When a woman lets your cucumber slip slowly through her fingers into a lukewarm vinegar bath, you're bonded for life.<eos> Well, she does like cucumbers...<eos> - Who doesn't?
Oh, come on.<eos> What, that stupid thing?<eos> It's totally unnecessary.<eos> Mm, it smells like honesty.<eos> No, it smells like fresh linen.<eos> Which you picked because it calms you.<eos> So just wrap yourself up in the scent and let it set you free.<eos> Jimmy, I have to go to work.<eos> Hey, come on, I told you the truth about me and your mother.<eos> No, you didn't.
No, it smells like fresh linen.<eos> Which you picked because it calms you.<eos> So just wrap yourself up in the scent and let it set you free.<eos> Jimmy, I have to go to work.<eos> Hey, come on, I told you the truth about me and your mother.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I walked in on you naked.<eos> You lied to my face.<eos> And now I know exactly how that feels.<eos> No, I don't.
- Hunting me?<eos> From here on in, you don't leave my side.<eos> Understood?<eos> Come on.<eos> You live here?<eos> - Why?<eos> - My house is just near here.<eos> There's heaps of houses near here.<eos> No one can just live in a forest.<eos> I do.
I wanna be more than just friends.<eos> You look amazing tonight, Greta.<eos> I wanna touch you all over.<eos> I wanna touch you and kiss you and make sweet, sweet love.<eos> This isn't happening, you're not Elliott!<eos> Listen to your new song, Greta.<eos> Feel it in your heart.<eos> Feel it in your body.<eos> - I don't want this.<eos> - Yes, you do.

Minx, I'm Claire.<eos> I know who you are.<eos> You do?<eos> You're the lady who makes Mommy cry.<eos> This is our home.<eos> You brought that woman into our home.<eos> Minx might be our only chance of finding out where Sean is.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> He did.
H-hey!<eos> Bad touching.<eos> Gravely: Portland Police.<eos> Those are just vitamins.<eos> They aren't even mine.<eos> Should we check all of you for vitamins?<eos> If we tell you we know Talia Lennox, will you go away?<eos> - That's gonna be your best chance.<eos> - Talia ran away to her dad's.<eos> - No, she didn't.
Besides... I'll have you back in shape long before then, sweetheart.<eos> But... thanks for the vote of confidence.<eos> You're welcome, John.<eos> I've got Simon's trail.<eos> So I want to set your mind at ease.<eos> - Sorry, what?<eos> - I told Johnny I'd get a job when this is over.<eos> Good plan!<eos> - Yeah, well, I lied.<eos> - without a Company job. - People do.
"Why" is a question my little bird must never ask.<eos> Open.<eos> Vena's mother says thank you, via a hefty a bonus.<eos> Warrant fee and tip, minus the Rack's 10% skim on all gratuities, and minus the outstanding bill for damages on Qresh...<eos> and we're flush.<eos> - Finally!<eos> - So let me ask you this...<eos> Yes, take a week off.<eos> You earned it.<eos> We all did.
- OK, you just need to...<eos> - Let me...<eos> I wonder how it will go!<eos> ♪ Kiss me ♪ ♪ Right down the milky twilight ♪<eos> - Come here! - ♪ Shwing, shwing... ♪<eos> (Sings indistinctly) ♪ You wear the shirt and I will wear that dress ♪<eos> - ♪ Whoa, kiss me ♪ - (Chuckles) OK!<eos> ♪ Right down the milky twilight... ♪<eos> (Laughs) Do you not wanna have sex?<eos> I do.
I write a list of questions in my phone to ask you, so if there's a lull in the conversation,<eos> I can go to the bathroom to confer.<eos> I appreciate the effort.<eos> I've never seen Love Actually.<eos> What?<eos> No, actually, that's not OK.<eos> That's crazy, you crazy motherfucker!<eos> What a crazy motherfucker!<eos> Remember when I told you how much I loved Love Actually?<eos> No, I don't!
- Uh...<eos> I, um...<eos> - Arnold, say it back!<eos> It's a really big deal to me to say that.<eos> - Me too, also!<eos> - No, I... I don't... I don't know.<eos> Arnold, you already said it, OK?<eos> You said it first.<eos> Yeah, I was the... I was the winner.<eos> Did I?
It's a really big deal to me to say that.<eos> - Me too, also!<eos> - No, I... I don't... I don't know.<eos> Arnold, you already said it, OK?<eos> You said it first.<eos> Yeah, I was the... I was the winner.<eos> Did I?<eos> You remember.<eos> Don't pretend like you don't remember.<eos> I just... I don't...
I just... I don't...<eos> I don't know.<eos> I actually just can't... do this.<eos> Look, I get this is a big deal for you and you have a big, complicated brain, but just... sometimes my feelings need to be thought of.<eos> No, I'm not going to be pressured into saying it.<eos> I'm just not going to be, OK?<eos> I need... I need you to go home.<eos> No, I don't... I don't wanna go.<eos> I just...<eos> I do.
Bad choice.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, you're like... like a little baby deer.<eos> You're like a little baby deer and you're trying to take its first steps.<eos> And you get... you get the strength, and you finally... you balance up on your little, dainty big deer...<eos> - ..your little, dainty deer hooves...<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And then Arnold comes and shoots you in your face!<eos> - He shoots you in your baby deer face. - (Laughs)<eos> Yeah, he did.
No.<eos> OK, I don't know what is going on here, if... if I am totally losing my mind, or if one of the gods or goddesses is angry with me and has sent a demon.<eos> A dangerous pervert demon who never seems to have any clothes on.<eos> - Germans are not so uptight about nudity.<eos> - Mm.<eos> This is not about nudity, OK?<eos> This is... This is about decency.<eos> It is about privacy.<eos> If you were so concerned with privacy and decency, why did you look?<eos> I did not.

And you were so great in it.<eos> The world is inspired by your movies, Lito, and I want you to continue making them, OK?<eos> Dani...<eos> Hernando, I'll be fine.<eos> If life has taught me anything, it's that... I can take a punch.<eos> Goodbye.<eos> Don't have too much fun without me.<eos> - What am I going to do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - Yes, you do!
This guy's right-handed.<eos> He's gonna go for your right wrist.<eos> Now!<eos> Throw the gun.<eos> Get on the bike.<eos> Is there a problem, Captain?<eos> Shut the door.<eos> Stop her!<eos> I don't know how to drive.<eos> I do.
- It's great, we're fine.<eos> We have it, OK?<eos> And your, uh... friend is here.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> My bodyguard.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - Hello, Kala.<eos> - Papa-ji.<eos> - I had no idea you came to the temple.<eos> - I don't.
in two separate worlds.<eos> Then...<eos> And then somehow they crashed...<eos> into one another.<eos> And now everything is dead.<eos> Another.<eos> So are we celebrating or mourning?<eos> I'm celebrating.<eos> I know how you feel.<eos> You do?
You have been chosen.<eos> Zack.<eos> There.<eos> You talk.<eos> It has begun.<eos> Come.<eos> This place is a maze. Where is it?<eos> It's, uh, here.<eos> You don't remember which unit?<eos> Of course I do.
Okay.<eos> Well, I guess what I wanted to say was, no matter what we found out about our biology, that the time that I had you, um...<eos> When you were babies...<eos> It doesn't change anything.<eos> What she said, if that's what you're worried about.<eos> Well, we thought we should talk about it.<eos> You mean the fact that you never told us?<eos> Or me even though I was with you the whole time?<eos> Honey, I explained to you... yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah, you did.
Did you see that coming? ! Hmm?<eos> Lieutenant!<eos> Okay, where are you getting your information from?<eos> I'm one of the super psychics of china.<eos> That sounds very important.<eos> That guy will fill you in.<eos> L-lieutenant, the chinese government Runs a psychic training program To hone the skills of gifted young children,<eos> And I believe that he is one of those gifted children. I'm -<eos> - I'm surprised your government let you out.<eos> They didn't.
- Where's Terry?<eos> Just drive, son.<eos> - Here's your cut.<eos> - Keep counting.<eos> I'm the one going to jail.<eos> - Kate McPherson is dead.<eos> There was an explosion, I think I broke my arm.<eos> You almost killed your grandson.<eos> You sent Avi.<eos> Of course I did.
- George is on his way.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> I'm sorry, but this young man was hit by a car, and we have been waiting for nearly an hour for someone to see him, that is after driving him here ourselves, because an ambulance never bothered to show up at the scene.<eos> We do apologise, ma'am. What with the long weekend and all...<eos> - That's all you have to say?<eos> - Libby. Honestly, it's okay.<eos> It's not okay, Virginia.<eos> Are you simply that cavalier about everything?<eos> You do not know that he's fine.<eos> You don't.
Selling Cardiff, you know, moving on.<eos> Right?<eos> Yeah, it's very good.<eos> Yeah, I just...<eos> And besides, it wasn't up to you.<eos> Hey.<eos> I was getting worried.<eos> Did everything go okay?<eos> At dinner last night... do you believe those things you said about me?<eos> Of course I do.
- Kelly's parents<eos> - contacted the centre yesterday.<eos> - Nana and Grandpa?<eos> - From where?<eos> - Sea Island, Georgia.<eos> Dad, we should go there. We'll be safe.<eos> It's done.<eos> We got the travel permits.<eos> You had no other options for Zack.<eos> Now you do.
We appreciate your patience.<eos> The train departing for Washington DC, Charleston, Savannah, Jacksonville,<eos> Orlando and terminating in Tampa/Miami should be arriving shortly.<eos> The right thing to do is usually the hardest.<eos> Well, this is going to be very tough.<eos> You know, when we get to DC... we get a fresh shot at putting that bio-weapon together again.<eos> Maybe, uh...<eos> Let's focus on getting there, OK?<eos> I know I don't have a right to ask you that...<eos> No, you don't.
- Whoa, whoa, that's far enough.<eos> Easy.<eos> Allow me to call the bank and rectify the situation.<eos> No. 323 million is 323 million.<eos> I ain't rectifying jack shit.<eos> Hey!<eos> This is your last warning.<eos> Try it.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Do your thing.
- What?<eos> I need you to get here, Mark.<eos> Okay, mom. I'll fly back as soon as I can.<eos> And you want to talk about whether she was raped,<eos> - whether she wasn't raped.<eos> - Yes, I do.<eos> - Why? What difference does it make?<eos> - Because that is not<eos> - the child that I raised...<eos> - Don't do it!
What do you mean, "Matt's lifestyle"?<eos> There are things that have come to the surface.<eos> - We need to deal with them. - He didn't have a lifestyle. Just please know we will.<eos> The bail hearing is Friday.<eos> I assure you... we'll be ready.<eos> Well, I don't trust him anymore.<eos> What the hell is he talking about...<eos> "Matt's lifestyle"?<eos> Oh, I think you know exactly what he's talking about.<eos> No, Tom, I don't.
Epic mom fail.<eos> I've had those.<eos> Don't even ask me about the disaster in my living room right now.<eos> So I get why you did it.<eos> Did what?<eos> Left your son home alone.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> I would never...<eos> - Yes.<eos> You did.
Well, you're good at it.<eos> I've learned who to call about what problems. So what?<eos> But to change anything for real?<eos> They had a grant program for HUD, and I sent a list of ideas up Central Avenue.<eos> We need security here, new doors, fences on the playground for the children.<eos> But nothing.<eos> Shit, I wanna do more than write down everybody's complaints about their own apartments and then call them in.<eos> I want a neighborhood.<eos> You thinking about applying for those new townhouses?<eos> Already did.
Jack, the thing is affordable housing is for people who can afford to rent. So it's not the same thing.<eos> It's the same.<eos> It drops down property values, it brings in the bad element.<eos> It's just I don't agree with you, okay?<eos> They said you went to the other side. I didn't believe them.<eos> You working with the housing people now, right?<eos> They tried the same program in Greenburgh and it worked, Jack.<eos> Bullshit!<eos> You really think it could make a difference?<eos> Yes, I do.
- I know you're scared.<eos> I'm scared too.<eos> I'm horrified.<eos> I might be leaving you all sooner than I ever imagined.<eos> - Don't you talk like that. Please!<eos> Do not talk like that.<eos> - It's the truth!<eos> And it has absolutely nothing to do with them!<eos> - I will let them down when I am good and ready.<eos> - I already did.
You too.<eos> Well, I guess I better be getting back.<eos> Well, let me fix Tawney a plate.<eos> Sure.<eos> Why not?<eos> Maybe she's got her appetite back.<eos> Can I have a word with you in private?<eos> Sure, Ted.<eos> You know where my wife is?<eos> I don't, Ted.

Ms. Person.<eos> I don't have an agenda.<eos> That's a good place to start, Sheriff.<eos> No, I mean I don't plan to confer with the senator about the investigation.<eos> How's he gonna feel about that?<eos> That's his business.<eos> This isn't.<eos> Did they find George's car?<eos> No.<eos> No, they didn't.
Uh-huh.<eos> You know, and then I didn't tell him whatever it was that he wanted to hear, and he did it.<eos> Pulled the trigger.<eos> And you came back a week later and tossed his body in the river, took his wallet and phone?<eos> Oh, don't forget the gun.<eos> Then pretended like he was alive for the next month or so.<eos> Look, I panicked, Carl, okay?<eos> I panicked.<eos> Pure Dee plain and simple.<eos> I did some stupid, impulsive shit.
Dad's using it to launch Hakeem.<eos> He's completely crazy about it right now.<eos> Listen to me.<eos> For most people, canceling a doctor's appointment is just lazy.<eos> But for someone who's bipolar, it's life-threatening.<eos> And... your life... is mine.<eos> (zipper unzips) I'll go. Oh.<eos> You should tell your mother that Hakeem is performing at Laviticus.<eos> She'll try to sabotage it.<eos> Already did.
Don't disrespect your mother like that.<eos> Hakeem...<eos> Make sure he's all right.<eos> VERNON: Don't you worry, Andre.<eos> We're gonna find him.<eos> How does she know he was like a father to us?<eos> They're cousins, stupid.<eos> And Cookie knows everything.<eos> No, she don't. Yes, she do.<eos> No, she don't.
Hakeem...<eos> Make sure he's all right.<eos> VERNON: Don't you worry, Andre.<eos> We're gonna find him.<eos> How does she know he was like a father to us?<eos> They're cousins, stupid.<eos> And Cookie knows everything.<eos> No, she don't. Yes, she do.<eos> No, she don't.<eos> Yes, she do.
I liked you better when you was a thug.<eos> I don't know how many times I can keep having the same conversation with you.<eos> Out of respect for Bunkie, I'm asking you, please...<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Don't do that.<eos> Bunkie had no problem with me, and you know it.<eos> Yeah, well, other people do, and you know it.<eos> Look, if you make that announcement, I'm going to lose artists, which will hurt Empire.<eos> I'm sorry, Dad. The world does not revolve around you.<eos> Your world does.
It could have been a neighbor that killed Tom?<eos> Well...<eos> The press know even less than the police do.<eos> They just make things up as they go along...<eos> Hurting innocent people, ruining lives.<eos> Did you know Tom was yours?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Um, I have no business asking that question.<eos> It's okay.<eos> I didn't...
I got a studio.<eos> I'm ready for my close-up, parasites!<eos> - Where do you want me... here? - Yeah.<eos> Right here?<eos> You got me?<eos> Great.<eos> Back off!<eos> They're gone, you know?<eos> I wasn't trying to hurt them.<eos> Yet you did.
- That's the nicest thing anyone's done for me.<eos> - What the hell happened?<eos> - Crazy boy took my baby.<eos> He needs to be put away to crazy people place and put electric in his head.<eos> Get him committed even if he doesn't wanna go.<eos> They just need your signature.<eos> MICKEY: They have to take him.<eos> At least he'll be getting some kind of fucking help.<eos> - You still love me.<eos> - No, I don't.
Watch out!<eos> You're entirely too good at this.<eos> I told you, I've got no power to get you promoted on this ship.<eos> Well, then I take it back.<eos> Standby for thrust correction.<eos> Warning.<eos> Gravity has...<eos> Holden, report to the flight deck.<eos> We never saw it.<eos> Sorry, cowboy, but we did.
(door bell jingles) I have to go, okay?<eos> Wait.<eos> I'm...<eos> Dr. Hart.<eos> Uh, mrs. Kincaid, what-what are you doing here?<eos> Uh, i was hoping to... Um, to talk with dr. Breeland.<eos> What?<eos> Why?<eos> He told you who i am?<eos> Yes. Yes, he did.
Two advanced degrees in fusion drive design.<eos> You never wondered why someone of such obvious intelligence was wasting her life sealing cracks and fixing gauges on an ancient, crumbling ice hauler?<eos> I never asked...<eos> Based on the desperate condition of your shuttle, it clearly required extraordinary improvisational expertise for you and your crew members simply to survive, let alone restore your antenna array.<eos> These are the hallmark skill sets of terrorists.<eos> Did Naomi Nagata effectuate those repairs?<eos> It's not impossible, is it?<eos> Naomi's not OPA.<eos> I don't believe you.<eos> You do now.
Have I answered all your questions, Detective?<eos> You haven't answered any of my questions.<eos> You took a young, naive, rich girl - with daddy issues. - Stop.<eos> - And got inside her head...<eos> - Stop.<eos> Now I'm getting choked up.<eos> Other than the money, what do you care?<eos> Huh?<eos> You didn't know her.<eos> Nah. But you did.
Your father took it very seriously.<eos> He asked you how to play.<eos> You said, "We each get five cards."<eos> You dealt them out, then you pointed to the far end of the yard and you said, now...<eos> "Whoever gets to the tree first, wins."<eos> You dropped your cards and were halfway there before anyone else realized what was happening.<eos> I've never seen your father more proud.<eos> See, here's the thing.<eos> I was terrified for you, I didn't know why.<eos> And now I do.
They were good men.<eos> Mark: How many do you think there are?<eos> Bo couldn't have done this.<eos> It was Jack.<eos> It had to be him.<eos> Kenzi?<eos> What, what you think she did this?<eos> Kenzi.<eos> You saw the blue light.<eos> We all did.
Revelation is the development of an image, first blurred, then coming clear.<eos> To find the inspiration Il Mostro used was a triumph.<eos> I went to the Uffizi and stood before the original "Primavera" day after day, and most days I'd see a young Lithuanian man as transfixed by the Botticelli as I was.<eos> As transfixed as I imagined Il Mostro would be.<eos> And every day I saw him, he would recreate the "Primavera" in pencil, just as he did in flesh.<eos> I knew.<eos> It was the best moment of my life. A moment of epiphany that made me famous and then ruined me.<eos> In the haste and the heat of ambition, the Questura nearly destroyed the young man's home, trying to find evidence.<eos> - He doesn't leave evidence.<eos> - No, he doesn't.
Head, hands, arms, and legs.<eos> A topiary.<eos> This is my design.<eos> A valentine written on a broken man.<eos> Will...<eos> I do feel closer to Hannibal here.<eos> God only knows where I'd be without him.<eos> He left us his... his broken heart.<eos> How did he know we were here?<eos> He didn't.
And that's how you'll find him.<eos> The wine, the truffles,<eos> taste in all things will be a constant between Dr. Lecter's lives.<eos> His name will change, but his taste will not.<eos> Of course you know what he would favour.<eos> Tell me, Dr. Bloom, does he favour you?<eos> I think I amused him.<eos> Things either amuse him or they don't.<eos> And if they don't...<eos> Well, you didn't.
Perhaps they'll prove me wrong.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Good night.<eos> Morning, John.<eos> Not for me, it's not.<eos> Walter Nunn paid me a visit last night.<eos> Oh, did he?<eos> Why was that, you think?<eos> I think you know why.<eos> Do I?
Because of... what you do for a living?<eos> No... cos I'm a woman.<eos> This client who raped you.<eos> Could he have been known to Walter Nunn?<eos> Didn't talk as if he knew him.<eos> Didn't seem that interested in him, actually.<eos> Well...<eos> As I recall from your statement, that rape was pretty violent.<eos> And even that didn't make Walter Nunn take you seriously?<eos> Well, neither did he the second time.
Enough, both of you.<eos> Now, I'm going to request permission to question Walter Nunn under caution.<eos> And the first thing he's going to want to ask is... did we question everybody that you spoke to on that night or are we victimising him?<eos> Now, Rachel, you've got all the names and addresses.<eos> Off you go.<eos> Ask them all for alibis.<eos> Let's go and get some fresh air.<eos> When I ask Walter Nunn,<eos> "Do you have an alibi for that Thursday night?"... .. is he going to say "Ask my wife, cos I was with her"?<eos> Cos if he does, John...
We don't know what could happen.<eos> I've been examined and I show no signs that this is affecting me negatively.<eos> Who examined you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Bo.<eos> I want this.<eos> For me.<eos> For us.<eos> Don't you want it too?<eos> Of course I do.
Who examined you?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> Bo.<eos> I want this.<eos> For me.<eos> For us.<eos> Don't you want it too?<eos> Of course I do.<eos> ♪<eos> Of course I do.
But his blood did.<eos> Jackson found genetic marker anomalies that can only come from someone who was born on the Ark.<eos> It's started.<eos> It didn't come from the blood transfusion<eos> - that we gave him?<eos> - No.<eos> I took the sample before that.<eos> They're bleeding my friends.<eos> We don't know that.<eos> Yes, we do.
We're too late.<eos> They're already bleeding them.<eos> They've taken Harper, and she may already be dead.<eos> We don't know how much time we have left.<eos> It's over.<eos> No.<eos> You don't get to give up, Clarke.<eos> You killed Finn, and I didn't give up.<eos> I'm building a damn tone generator.<eos> You do your job.
I have a message for your leader.<eos> We're coming for him.<eos> Let our people go, and we'll let you live.<eos> It's an 8-hour walk back to Mount Weather.<eos> You're gonna do it in 6.<eos> Sir, you're too far...<eos> From the door, way too far.<eos> Just breathe.<eos> Don't worry about me.<eos> You did it, didn't you, sir?

One minute.<eos> That's the window.<eos> Small window.<eos> Why don't we just take out the backup generator, too?<eos> Bellamy's inside.<eos> Have him do it.<eos> Leaving them without power that long would kill them all, and as I said, that's not the mission.<eos> Besides, we lost contact with Bellamy.<eos> What?<eos> We did?
I think he's good for being involved in these murders.<eos> As far as we know, he moves drugs, not people.<eos> Why is it he can be involved in one and not the other?<eos> I'd let you talk to the guy once we bring him in.<eos> I got two dead girls.<eos> I think this guy's involved in it.<eos> This shit's paper thin.<eos> You know it.<eos> - I hate to be the guy to take your case--<eos> - Then don't do that.
He's on parole.<eos> We should be able to rattle his cage.<eos> Do you know any of his associates?<eos> How's the charter business going?<eos> It's how I'm making the big bucks.<eos> What about you?<eos> How are things going?<eos> Hey.<eos> You call that girl?<eos> Oh, yeah, I did.
- What does it look like I'm doing?<eos> Biology class?<eos> I'm filleting.<eos> - You know anything about cooking?<eos> - I suck at cooking.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> No one's ever taught you.<eos> That's all that means.<eos> Didn't you go to cooking school?<eos> Yeah. I did.
They were totally dry before I soaked them.<eos> - I soaked them.<eos> - Why did you lie to me?<eos> 'Cause I'm an adult and I wet my underpants.<eos> Are you the one who put up all those "alive in Tucson" signs?<eos> Yes!<eos> Yes!<eos> That was me.<eos> That was me.<eos> I did that.
I would say, talk to Matt.<eos> He's nonverbal.<eos> That is not true, man... the whole... that computer-y thing that he does.<eos> He's, like, a super genius, man.<eos> We talk.<eos> We have long talks.<eos> He gets me.<eos> What could it hurt?<eos> You know very well what I'm talking about.<eos> No, I don't!
It is my opinion that we should focus on what we do best.<eos> We are a retailer.<eos> Construction of housing, no matter how well intentioned, is outside our area of expertise.<eos> And crucially, it is an endeavor that will reap no tangible profit.<eos> Which will affect you gentlemen as majority shareholders.<eos> Profit must be at the heart of our business strategy.<eos> Another time, this project might be viable.<eos> Now is not that time.<eos> I think that we all value Mr. Crabb's opinion.<eos> I certainly do.
I have some news that I want to share with the family.<eos> - I'm glad you're here, Marie.<eos> I intend to bid for a field in West London.<eos> For Serge's aerodrome?<eos> Something far more important.<eos> A lasting tribute to your mother's memory.<eos> To build houses for heroes returning from war.<eos> Rose would approve entirely, son.<eos> - Does Serge know about this?<eos> - He does.
I'll get the rake.<eos> How are you working it?<eos> Well, those in the know ask for the club room.<eos> We vet them and then we take them through here.<eos> Had a little flutter in here yet, George?<eos> Gambling's not my thing.<eos> You're missing out on one of life's joys.<eos> If you say so.<eos> Think you're a bit above this?<eos> Course he doesn't.
- Plotting?<eos> - Aye.<eos> And that one... worst of the lot.<eos> Watch yourself around him, mark my word.<eos> You do realize that's exactly what you said about the guard, Gerald, down in the cells.<eos> And was I not right?<eos> I know, I know you mistrust me, and I earned that.<eos> And it's a pity because more than any of your other subjects, I wish you success.<eos> I know what you're up to here, Mother.<eos> Do you, dear?
I'm done.<eos> I have to be on my own.<eos> Ain't life a bitch?<eos> Nebbishy little guy, me, always sticking it to the lunkhead jocks. You know what?<eos> Screw the Mark.<eos> Let's just kill him.<eos> Boy, he really is a mess.<eos> Who knew the Mark was so toxic?<eos> Well...<eos> Actually, I did.
What are you doing?<eos> Look, I know I was a dick before, but I was the wrong kind of dick, and this time, I'm being the right kind of dick.<eos> And I'm telling you that you can do this.<eos> Can't we just get a ladder?<eos> There's got to be one in here somewhere.<eos> No, Roderick can do it.<eos> Okay,Roderick, time to man up.<eos> Oh, what the hell?<eos> Give me those gloves.<eos> Do it, do it, do it, do it, do it.

It's gonna be okay.<eos> Here.<eos> Throw some salt over your shoulder.<eos> Go back inside.<eos> Go change.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Go, go, go!<eos> - What am I gonna do?<eos> What's happening?<eos> What do I do?
I'm busy.<eos> Oh, okay.<eos> Um, well, I understand you don't want me at your wedding and of course that is your prerogative, but for the record, I would just like to say that I'm very hurt by that.<eos> And I fully realize that, over the years, uh, you and I have had a few minor... differences.<eos> But weddings are the time to put all those differences aside.<eos> That's a steaming load of crap.<eos> I want to be surrounded by the people who love me and the people that I love.<eos> The only person that you know how to love is yourself.<eos> You don't know the first thing about me.<eos> Yeah, actually I do.
Right?<eos> Blaine?<eos> I don't know,<eos> I-I don't know.<eos> I just...<eos> What Burt and Carole were talking about earlier, and these last few months without you have been really...<eos> I love you, Kurt.<eos> I mean, I love you, I-I do, I...<eos> This is crazy, this is crazy.<eos> And I don't...
Deal.<eos> Hey, what do you think about getting a sign on the door?<eos> - Well, you got a sign.<eos> - A real one.<eos> You should get some clients first.<eos> Just one little sign.<eos> What could it cost?<eos> Frank, you can barely afford to pay me.<eos> I thought you were working for free.<eos> I... I did... for a day.
So, you open, I'll sum up.<eos> And we should cash that check, have Karen see what she can find out about Confederated Global.<eos> Right.<eos> Where the hell is she?<eos> It's a fairly simple form.<eos> Here you agree, in writing, to never again disclose information regarding your former employer, the dissolved entity known as Union Allied Construction, or any of its affiliates.<eos> Upon execution of this agreement, the corporate interests, as they currently exist, agree not to pursue legal action against you.<eos> Against me?<eos> Well, you signed a non-disclosure agreement the day you were hired, Miss Page.<eos> Everybody did.
Eat something.<eos> This moment...<eos> How things go in the next few weeks-- will decide--<eos> - That's why I--<eos> - Let me finish.<eos> Your grandfather left the ashes of the Weimar Republic and came to this country to build a name for himself.<eos> He built an empire from a shoe-shine box.<eos> And then, and only then, did he send for your father.<eos> Ma, I know the story.<eos> No, you don't.
The Sheriff thinks a pair of them gunned down those poor people at The Waffle Hut one after another in cold blood.<eos> I mean, first Watergate, and now this?<eos> What's the world coming to?<eos> Sorry, Mrs. Colson. The car wouldn't start.<eos> I'll ditch the coat and get your squared away, okay?<eos> - Big night? - Huh?<eos> Got a hangover?<eos> Oh, no, it's, uh, just a migraine.<eos> You talk to Ed?<eos> Did I...
"Send the Indian," they'd say.<eos> "Who cares about booby traps?<eos> Give Hanzee a flashlight and a knife and send him down into the black echo."<eos> Moving through the earth like a rat, killing off Charlie, taking his ears...<eos> Ears?<eos> You got to push their faces down into the dirt so they don't scream and wake the others.<eos> Where on God's green earth do you keep the plunger?<eos> Is there a problem here, Sonny?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - 'Course you don't.
And we had a saying-- fubar.<eos> Yeah, we had that, too.<eos> So when you put a dead judge, the Gerhardt family, and some hitters from Kansas in a bag together, I go back to thinking it might be best just to confess to the crime myself-- go live a long life in a cell somewhere with hot and cold running water.<eos> He got a place in town, then-- your uncle?<eos> Rye.<eos> Something he doesn't tell people, where he can do his business?<eos> - You mean nail girls?<eos> - Girls, drugs.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I don't.
Okay, so, you should probably get out.<eos> You got the one shiner already.<eos> Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Watch your toes, now.<eos> I mean, what are the odds?<eos> Black ice and you doing a 180, hitting a tree with the back?<eos> You could run that scenario 1,000 times and never end up with these circumstances.<eos> Yeah, I got it right the second time, though.<eos> Yeah, you did.
This better be state secret-level information.<eos> - They all left.<eos> - Who all?<eos> - Dodd and Bear and maybe half a dozen--<eos> - Going?<eos> He called me a whore.<eos> Well, darling... technically--<eos> It's my body.<eos> I got every right.<eos> Of course you do.
Need your help here.<eos> Thought you had backup coming.<eos> Closest men are outside Nobles, an hour away.<eos> Plus, you're talking about farm boys who've never been face-to-face with a serious man before.<eos> Whereas I stared down Chiang Kai-Shek.<eos> That.<eos> And I need someone who can talk some sense into the father.<eos> Who better than the son's lawyer?<eos> Don't represent the son, though.<eos> You do now, Karl.
What's it they call those Russians?<eos> "Sleeper agents?"<eos> I'm saying, you think you know someone, but what do you know, really?<eos> I even had a kid in here the other day, stabbed his parents to death in their sleep.<eos> When I asked him why, he couldn't say.<eos> Just come over him all of a sudden.<eos> Stories used to be simpler, that's for sure.<eos> This, then that.<eos> And now, I don't know where it starts or how it ends.<eos> I truly don't.
It's him.<eos> Hey! Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> Slow down.<eos> What are you telling me?<eos> The man from your vision? The one in flames?<eos> I think I may know who he is.<eos> So, you say you know this guy?<eos> Yeah, we went to grad school together.<eos> Oh, you didn't mention that before.<eos> I didn't?
Tell me everything about this new group you're working with.<eos> What new group?<eos> You know.<eos> Your drinking buddies from the bar.<eos> I want to know their names, how you met, your mission.<eos> Their mission?<eos> No, they got nothing to do with El Jefe.<eos> Oh, so you don't want to see your brother again.<eos> No, no, I...<eos> I do.
Why would the government cover up a meteor site?<eos> Look, I know this is hard to believe, but I'm telling you... We were there.<eos> This rock, it's special.<eos> Must be.<eos> Got you to come to me after all these years.<eos> I wish I had a choice.<eos> So can you help us?<eos> You'll have to calibrate the mass spectrometer if you want to run this sample.<eos> I trust you know your way around a processing lab.<eos> Sure do.
Ah, look at me.<eos> My first international summit, and I am a nervous wreck.<eos> Have we done the right thing coming here?<eos> Wanting a better life for your people is always the right thing.<eos> You know what I'm up against, Helen.<eos> The only reason I'm here is to promote peace, while the warlords back home are ready to start civil war.<eos> Everything is going to be fine.<eos> Breathe, Abdul.<eos> I believe in you.<eos> We all do.
When there's important guests, we sing and get to wear our Sunday best.<eos> And suddenly, there was Dieter.<eos> When was that?<eos> Two... no, three.<eos> Three years ago.<eos> Three years ago?<eos> And since then?<eos> We are in love.<eos> Yes, but when do you see each other?<eos> We don't.
And even after all the crazy things that I've been through, that was the worst.<eos> That's when I needed you most.<eos> You're right.<eos> I'm truly sorry that I wasn't there for you, but we have a problem...<eos> Klaus.<eos> What else is new?<eos> Kol told me that you guys were working on a weapon to use against him.<eos> Rebekah heard that it was a dagger, one that would work even on Klaus.<eos> I need to know if you finished it.<eos> - And what if we did?
Freya objected to us making a single weapon because it spoilt her plan.<eos> Klaus!<eos> Jack?<eos> Klaus!<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> What happened?<eos> Klaus made Aiden spy on us.<eos> Instead, he told me everything, so you killed him!<eos> You killed him, one of the wolves sworn to protect our daughter?<eos> So what if I did?
You're the reason Dahlia is able to cast such powerful spells.<eos> She's channeling you.<eos> This whole time, you've been helping her.<eos> I had no idea.<eos> She must have found me.<eos> She wants to turn you against me.<eos> Get away from my husband.<eos> Stop.<eos> Freya, I want to trust you...<eos> I do...
Candor.<eos> Is everything always 10 steps ahead of the game with you?<eos> Well, often, victory is allowing your opponent to believe that they are triumphant till they're not.<eos> Ok.<eos> Just remember who sealed the deal.<eos> Credit where credit's due.<eos> I told you you needed a woman to mess things up for you.<eos> You never told me if you like me in this dress.<eos> You're right.<eos> I didn't.
We're out of time.<eos> I've located Hayley, and I strongly advise, do not attempt to stand in my way.<eos> Niklaus' paintings contain Mikael's ashes in the soil.<eos> Go to the compound.<eos> You cannot stop me from getting that baby.<eos> You begin this spell.<eos> Prepare the battlefield.<eos> I'll bring hope to you.<eos> Your daughter will need my guidance...<eos> Just as Freya did.
Ok.<eos> I've still got two of your men.<eos> If you want them back, it's simple.<eos> Get out of the Glades.<eos> The city servicemen, especially the police-- evacuate.<eos> You're out of your mind!<eos> And you've got until midnight tomorrow.<eos> If I even see a hint of a blue, your city yes-men, they will be buried.<eos> We won't abandon an entire district.<eos> They did in L.A. in '92, didn't they?
I'm fine.<eos> Are you ready to leave?<eos> No.<eos> I'm not leaving.<eos> Is this supposed to make up for me missing your adolescence, this routine of listening and then disobeying me?<eos> Just hear me out.<eos> You told me that we were in danger.<eos> You even told me who was after us.<eos> But what you didn't tell me is why.<eos> Yes, I did.
Oliver, I told you before, if Thea finds out you've been lying to her all this time, you will lose her...forever.<eos> How's Tatsu?<eos> She'll be better when we're far away from here.<eos> Your bow.<eos> If you want anything else, take it quickly.<eos> We're leaving in five minutes.<eos> We're not coming back.<eos> Oh, we can't just run.<eos> Waller knows I tried to steal the virus to get Tatsu back.<eos> Even if she didn't,
What I know, Oliver, is that you started something.<eos> Something strong enough to live on past you.<eos> The question is, can you live with what it's become?<eos> Oliver.<eos> Are you all right?<eos> I told them you were on the ferry.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> They tortured you.<eos> I sold you out.<eos> No, you didn't.
For me?<eos> For me but because of you.<eos> Is my room still available?<eos> Oh!<eos> Where have you been?<eos> I've been so worried about you.<eos> I was in Bludhaven.<eos> Ran into an old friend of mine, things got--ahem-- interesting, and I actually spent the past few weeks in jail.<eos> I thought you grew out of that.<eos> So did I.
Always loyal.<eos> Stand up.<eos> So when they told me someone ignored my orders to lay low; when they told me one of my crew shot a cop...<eos> I beat the man who said it was you.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Danny, that cop?<eos> It was a mistake.<eos> What we're planning here requires two things.<eos> No mistakes, and the cops not knowing anything.<eos> They still don't.
Felicity, it wasn't your call to make.<eos> It wasn't my call to let Oliver go challenge Ra's al Ghul to a fight to the death, either!<eos> Brick has who knows how much evidence, Felicity.<eos> And it was either that or the two of you.<eos> My friends being killed.<eos> So I made my choice.<eos> I chose not to let anyone else I care about die.<eos> We've been in tough spots before and we've always managed to come out on the other side.<eos> No.<eos> Oliver did.
The brother that I was.<eos> And how he probably died when that boat went down.<eos> All this time, I've been struggling with who I am...<eos> And you think who you're supposed to be is...<eos> The next Ra's al Ghul?<eos> Honestly?<eos> I don't know.<eos> The only thing that I can know for sure is that everything that I've done; every--everything that happened, it led me right here, to this moment.<eos> And Felicity, if that's true, then... I don't know what it was all for.<eos> I do.
Ollie, I don't understand.<eos> Malcolm is going to take you home.<eos> Aren't you coming with?<eos> Not now.<eos> You go on, I'll catch up.<eos> I love you, Thea.<eos> Don't ever forget that, ok?<eos> Oliver...<eos> Oliver, I don't know what to say.<eos> I do.
Oops?<eos> You need to get some sleep.<eos> I will, once I've cracked the problem.<eos> Or blow yourself up?<eos> Whichever comes first.<eos> Ray?<eos> When those men killed Anna, I promised myself I would never feel that helpless again.<eos> So, can you even imagine how I felt when Brick's men took a portion of the city hostage?<eos> Lousy.<eos> We all did.
Thea, it's understandable.<eos> You've been through something very few people have ever experienced.<eos> - Of course you feel... - Is that what you think this is all about?<eos> Almost dying?<eos> Because I'd rather have died than have my brother sacrifice his life for mine.<eos> And don't think for a second that I forgot the whole reason Ra's al Ghul was brought into our lives is because of you.<eos> You're no longer in danger from the League.<eos> Maybe getting away from Starling City for a while is what's best for you.<eos> You approve? Is that supposed to worry me?<eos> Because it actually kind of does.
You look ok.<eos> Are you ok?<eos> I'm fine.<eos> Not even a scratch.<eos> How is that possible?<eos> How did you get him back?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> What matters is, You didn't kill him.<eos> No, I wanted Ra's to kill him.<eos> And I still do.
Ok.<eos> But after, we go to my lab, get the nano-tech, inject it in me, and publish the results in the "New England Journal of Medicine."<eos> Ah, I'm sorry, but that's simply not possible.<eos> Uh, I invented the tech, it's possible.<eos> Starling General has a very strict policy against experimental procedures.<eos> Wait, there is a procedure that could save his life, and you're saying you won't perform it?<eos> I'm saying I can't perform it.<eos> The hospital won't permit the use of an experimental or untested technology.<eos> How do you know your invention won't kill you?<eos> I don't.
The door was open.<eos> Sorry to interrupt your staring into nothingness.<eos> He should have let me die.<eos> That was never an option.<eos> That's why I love him.<eos> I didn't know... about you and my brother.<eos> Yeah, well...<eos> It was complicated.<eos> But I did love him.<eos> Despite everything, I still do.
He's drawing energy directly from a power station.<eos> Which one?<eos> The one Felicity just went to.<eos> Come on, Felicity, pick up.<eos> I'm sorry, but the blonde can't come to the phone at the moment.<eos> I swear to God, if you hurt her--<eos> You'll what...<eos> fly away again?<eos> I am talking to the man in the suit, right? The one who thinks a piece of scrap metal makes him some kind of hero?<eos> It doesn't.
The only way that we were going to defeat the League was from the inside.<eos> I had to get close enough to Ra's to find out how he was going to destroy the city...<eos> And stop him.<eos> You trusted<eos> Malcolm Merlyn more than you did the two people closest to you!<eos> John, it wasn't about trust!<eos> It was about making sure that you and you were safe.<eos> I had to keep the circle as small as possible.<eos> How did you expect to repair all this once you got back?<eos> I didn't.
John, it wasn't about trust!<eos> It was about making sure that you and you were safe.<eos> I had to keep the circle as small as possible.<eos> How did you expect to repair all this once you got back?<eos> I didn't.<eos> I flew with Ra's and the virus to Starling and I sabotaged the plane.<eos> The plan... was to kill Ra's and destroy the virus.<eos> It didn't work.<eos> How did you expect to survive the plane crash?<eos> You didn't.
He's trying to turn the city against me; make the offer to take his place more appealing.<eos> Hit the streets.<eos> Whoever's doing this is targeting criminals.<eos> We need to know who they're going to hit next.<eos> We need all the information that the police have from the crime scene.<eos> Whoever is under that hood has to leave a trail, something to follow.<eos> I'm on it.<eos> How can we help?<eos> Go to Starling City airport.<eos> Ok, to do what?
The entire gang is going to show up for protection.<eos> This is exactly the kind of thing that fake Arrow would go after.<eos> We really need a better name for him.<eos> When is this happening? Right now.<eos> I'll suit up.<eos> Roy...<eos> This is the League.<eos> I've got it.<eos> So did you hire a florist?<eos> Yes, we did.
Let's not tempt fate.<eos> Come on, I'll drive you to the hospital.<eos> No.<eos> There's too many people asking too many questions.<eos> It's better to stay off the grid.<eos> You don't have to be doing any of this.<eos> I didn't do enough when it really counted.<eos> If I had, none of this would be happening.<eos> You didn't know what Roman was capable of.<eos> Neither did I.
Okay?<eos> Mom, whatever you are planning, it's dangerous.<eos> You're going to get yourself killed.<eos> But we... we came up with the plan together.<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> When you came to see me!<eos> Where? !<eos> At the institution.<eos> I didn't even know you were in there.<eos> Yes, yes you did.

Hey...<eos> Visitations.<eos> He didn't just let her rot...<eos> Looks like he took care of her.<eos> And her response is positive.<eos> Calm.<eos> There's another visitor.<eos> ♪<eos> I thought you said that you didn't know she was there.<eos> I didn't.
"s.W. -- Leaving your orbit Is like making earth say goodbye to the sun."<eos> He realllikes her.<eos> No mention of him in her quote.<eos> Hellman: I definitely know her.<eos> I thought about nothing else for almost four years.<eos> When's the last time you talked to her?<eos> Uh -- um... High school.<eos> But most of those conversations happened in my head.<eos> Do you really think she, uh, had something to do with this pipeline bomb?<eos> Yeah, we do.
I wish there was something I could do to make it easier.<eos> - But I'm fine.<eos> - You are?<eos> Well, let's see...<eos> I am standing here, I'm talking to you, my head has not exploded.<eos> Oh, that's... good.<eos> It is good, isn't it?<eos> Because, oh, my God, when you first left? I was, like, "My life is over."<eos> "I cannot sleep in that big fucking bed without him."<eos> But I did it.
Wait.<eos> Go back.<eos> There.<eos> How do you know?<eos> She's wearing that.<eos> Close to the time Larissa got bludgeoned.<eos> Placed at the scene.<eos> So we got her, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We do.
Eric broke his wrist,<eos> Kyle cut his legs.<eos> We were lucky.<eos> Others weren't.<eos> We weren't even supposed to be out here today.<eos> We were just out for a drive and decided to stop.<eos> It was... it was all so random.<eos> I-- yeah, I was on the platform.<eos> I barely got out of the way.<eos> The two guys next to me, they didn't.
No black man, woman, or child is gonna help you, Detective.<eos> Cass doesn't deserve justice?<eos> Not your kind of justice.<eos> Point One of our 10-Point Plan:<eos> - We want freedom.<eos> - Freedom!<eos> We want power to determine the destiny of our black and oppressed community.<eos> We believe that black and oppressed people will not be free until we're able to determine our destinies in our own communities ourselves by controlling all the institutions which exist in our communities.<eos> - You really want my job?<eos> - Not the way you do it.
Do you have any... what do you call that again?<eos> - Evidence?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - I have a rock.<eos> - Okay.<eos> I'll check it out but you know, Kristin may not be wrong.<eos> You live where you live, you got to worry about everyone else.<eos> You live somewhere else, you only have to worry about yourself.<eos> Understand?<eos> - You do, all right.
Call sheet.<eos> That's confusing.<eos> Anyway, according to the call sheet here, novo, on the day he was killed, was "called" at, uh, 6:00 am.<eos> And then he was "wrapped" at 6:00...<eos> No, he was wrapped at 4:15 pm.<eos> Which means when he drove back on the lot at 10:00 pm, it wasn't to work.<eos> No.<eos> You saw someone with him, didn't you?<eos> Right?<eos> You did, Bert.
It's gotta be 15 years now.<eos> New year's Eve.<eos> You sat at the bar.<eos> Laughing, flirting.<eos> Bait.<eos> Wait a second.<eos> You even bought me a beer.<eos> That was a long time ago.<eos> And midnight... everyone wants to kiss on new year's.<eos> So we do...
They're just sick.<eos> It's sad.<eos> And for what, huh?<eos> How the hell is it worth the risk to do that?<eos> You know what I realized trying to understand people?<eos> -What?<eos> -Don't try to understand 'em.<eos> I know what I'd kill for and what I'd die for.<eos> You served.<eos> You do, too.
I had a vision of him murdering Wally Walker.<eos> This is important.<eos> When you had the vision, were you holding an apple bong, or did you just smoke an old-school spliff?<eos> I'm not screwing around, Clive.<eos> I'm just wondering if this vision also contained winged horses and a dancing pizza.<eos> I'm not saying you didn't see it, but no psychic bats 1.000.<eos> You're going after the wrong guy.<eos> And from what I could gather, he's done it before, like, a lot.<eos> How is this guy even connected to Walker?<eos> Something to do with debts.
I know, things have been crazy.<eos> Sergeant Jeffries is suing Frank for not carrying enough varieties of ice cream at the Dixie Stop.<eos> And Meatball has changed his whole sound, and the Truitt brothers are jealous, and...<eos> That's not important.<eos> What is important right now is that we clear our crazy schedules and make this happen.<eos> Hmm. So, how's tomorrow night?<eos> It would be my pleasure, George Tucker.<eos> See, I knew you were gonna say yes.<eos> Oh!<eos> You did, did you?
It almost got you!<eos> Are you okay...?<eos> Ladies?<eos> How are you?<eos> So great you came here.<eos> Grab a table.<eos> I'll be right with you, all right?<eos> Believe me, I know how you feel.<eos> Oh!<eos> Oh, you do, huh?
I'm pretty uncomfortable right now, and I need to figure out how to sell my unborn child to pay for Wade's muffin habit, so... (engine starts)<eos> You know, I-I really cannot wait to write my own review.<eos> Oh, really, and what'll it say?<eos> If you're not interested in eating,<eos> Lutefisk is the perfect place for a first date.<eos> That is very, very smooth, George Tucker.<eos> Oh, well, you know, I can be smooth.<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do-do you like that?<eos> I do.
Prosecutor jumps off a bridge after killing his girlfriend?<eos> That's a front-page story.<eos> Someone needs to notify paul's wife Before the press gets to her.<eos> Well, we'll stay here until they find her.<eos> I'll be back asap.<eos> Let me know if you hear anything.<eos> Jane's a hell of a swimmer. [ sighs ]<eos> She could make it out to one of those islands<eos> That korsak circled.<eos> But what if she didn't?
Paul: I just need five minutes.<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Please, carol. There's nothing left to say.<eos> Look, I know I handled this the wrong way and I'm sorry!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> How could you do it?<eos> How could you just throw away our life together, Everything we built?<eos> The future that we planned -- didn't it mean anything to you?<eos> Didn't I mean anything to you?<eos> Of course you did.
- Was he?<eos> - It seemed like it.<eos> I mean, he was acting all kinds of shady ... sneaking around, lying about where he was going.<eos> Did you ever see him with another woman?<eos> I wish.<eos> Do you know the bonus I get for a money shot like that?<eos> Divorce attorneys love me.<eos> And the more naked, the better.<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
And I have a few strategies of my own I can share with you.<eos> Do any of these "strategies"<eos> Have to do with what's in your "study closet"?<eos> Study closet? I'm not sure I understand.<eos> Oh, you understand perfectly well.<eos> Maybe there's a chapter in here that deals with splurging.<eos> Or not splurging, as the case may be.<eos> I know talking about money is difficult, but it is also important.<eos> - I have customers.<eos> - So do I. Well, bodies.
Everybody thinks they are the good guy.<eos> It's all one big gray area.<eos> And sometimes, I really don't like it myself.<eos> You know, I was gonna be a cop when I was younger, but sadly, that didn't work out.<eos> Am I gonna regret asking why?<eos> Well, I was obviously too good for them.<eos> Look at that.<eos> You created an alibi for yourself.<eos> Yeah.<eos> What? I did?
Well, technically, I'm the president-elect.<eos> Congratulations, president-elect.<eos> Wait! No, Ma! It's gonna go everywhere.<eos> Please. This is not my first rodeo.<eos> I just got elected.<eos> How do you all know about this?<eos> Oh, they called to ask how to engrave the plaque, and I had to tell someone.<eos> - So she told me, and I told...<eos> - Everyone.<eos> Of course he did.
Why don't we pool our resources?<eos> We both want the same thing, after all.<eos> ~ Do we?<eos> ~ The truth.<eos> I want my friend released.<eos> Then perhaps you could start by telling me about the letter.<eos> Well, it obviously wasn't meant for me and Archie didn't leave it for his colleagues either, which means he didn't trust them.<eos> He wanted it to go to an outsider - someone who'd come to investigate if things went wrong - you.<eos> But I got to the manor house first, which meant Lord Masters got the wrong end of the stick... .. and doesn't know what's going on in his own house.<eos> But you do.
Bridal gowns.<eos> I thought we could start looking in Miami this weekend and make a day out of it.<eos> Oh, you know, Mom, everything's so hectic right now.<eos> Maybe we can check in at the end of the week.<eos> Oh, yeah, sure.<eos> Look, I know you're busy, but did you have a chance to file those new ownership documents?<eos> For the inn?<eos> Yeah.<eos> To include Danny.<eos> No, I didn't.
This is my favorite day of the year.<eos> Yeah, Russ was just saying the same thing.<eos> You want to elaborate for Holly?<eos> Come and get it!<eos> Breakfast is officially served!<eos> We lost the venue.<eos> The venue you recommended.<eos> Mayfield?<eos> I dropped off the deposit myself.<eos> No. No, you didn't.
- Oh, right.<eos> Hey, let me take the lead, please.<eos> It's this way.<eos> Whoa!<eos> Where are you going?<eos> You don't even know.<eos> - Follow me.<eos> - Shit.<eos> - You don't know where you're going.<eos> - Yes, I do.
I am not at liberty to divulge that information.<eos> But this is a matter of international security.<eos> I am very sorry.<eos> Tell the team we're checking in.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Heidi, sir.<eos> Do you know who I am, Heidi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.
Tell the team we're checking in.<eos> Yes sir.<eos> May I ask your name?<eos> Heidi, sir.<eos> Do you know who I am, Heidi?<eos> Yes.<eos> I do, Mr. Secretary.<eos> Have you been watching the news, Heidi?<eos> Do you know what's going on in Pakistan?<eos> Yes, sir, I do.
Yes.<eos> You will lose your job for this, won't you?<eos> Probably.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Deservedly.<eos> Thank you, Alex.<eos> I like this new man.<eos> - Did you see that?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I did.
To keep her calm.<eos> She gets agitated.<eos> So you sedate her so she can't walk?<eos> Do you want this?<eos> 'Cause I can always find someone else.<eos> What are you doing this weekend, Dr. Roman?<eos> Ah, I know.<eos> A real estate agent is going to show us houses in Mamaroneck.<eos> Mamaroneck. I...<eos> I don't, um...
I'll hide you.<eos> Walk behind me.<eos> Hey, what are you doing later?<eos> Working.<eos> Want to go for a drive?<eos> Where?<eos> ( singsongy ) It's a surprise.<eos> ( singsongy ) I don't like surprises.<eos> Everybody likes surprises.<eos> No, everyone does not.
I'm not a doctor.<eos> Can we ease up a little, please?<eos> Could I have a word with you, please?<eos> In private?<eos> Coop just gave me his two weeks' notice.<eos> Wow, I'm sorry to hear that.<eos> He said he had a conversation with you that was a real eye-opener.<eos> Did you tell him your little tale about the Icelandic condominiums?<eos> Norwegian?<eos> No, I did not.
His name is Bob Burke.<eos> - Well, let's go talk to him.<eos> - That's why we got to hurry.<eos> An emergency call for Bob Burke just came in.<eos> And the paramedics are already on their way.<eos> I heard a noise, so I came out on the porch.<eos> I saw Mr. Burke stumbling out of his apartment.<eos> He fell to his knees, vomited, and passed out.<eos> - That's when I called 911.<eos> - You did the right thing.
Then what?<eos> I was an accountant, so I knew spreadsheets.<eos> I catalogued Dr. Murray's treatment protocol.<eos> Dr. Murray was obsessed with data.<eos> He wanted to prove to the medical community that they were wrong, That he had the answer to curing all disease... with sound.<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> It seems crazy, but that's what I saw happening.<eos> - Everyone got better.<eos> - But then someone didn't.
Get out of my lair!<eos> Fine.<eos> How about a trade then: hand over my shield or I'll hunt your people down and kill them.<eos> The Valkyrie will be the first to go.<eos> Pity.<eos> Great hair.<eos> What?<eos> Nothing.<eos> You keep looking at me.<eos> No, I don't.
You're the only one who can.<eos> Bo. You are my child.<eos> My blood.<eos> I would never do anything to hurt you.<eos> What happened?<eos> Bo, your hand.<eos> Nyx is gone.<eos> The bracelet worked.<eos> No.<eos> It didn't.
Well, maybe our vic got in deep with the wrong person.<eos> - See if you can find out who that was.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, Gwen told me you made the honor roll.<eos> - Everyone makes the honor roll.<eos> - Well, I don't think that's true.<eos> I just mean everyone who stays conscious, does their homework, and manages to resist the urge to let the air out of their teacher's car tires.<eos> High five.<eos> Kids don't let the air out of the teachers'... tires.<eos> They do?
You might need more chairs for the meeting tonight.<eos> Just sayin'.<eos> You do?<eos> I got us two box seats to the New York Philharmonic movie night.<eos> They play the themes to all your favorite movies.<eos> Um, "Star Wars," "Jaws," "Indiana Jones."<eos> I mean, I think this might be the most thoughtful thing I've ever done.<eos> There's... trains.<eos> You don't want to go to movie night?<eos> Of course I do.
Jackie, I seriously hope you were not administering care to a patient at this hospital.<eos> Gloria, they were short a nurse.<eos> I made it very clear you were not to touch any patient.<eos> If I did not touch that patient, she would be dead.<eos> - Is that what you want?<eos> - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.<eos> It was my fault.<eos> It's my first day on the floor.<eos> I'm still figuring out where the forks go, if you know what I mean.<eos> I do not.
No.<eos> You shouldn't have brought this here.<eos> I wanted you to see it.<eos> So you would believe me.<eos> Brutal.<eos> I'm drunk, sir.<eos> I'm- - I'm drunk right now.<eos> This girl really meant something to you, didn't she?<eos> Yeah.<eos> She did.
Yes?<eos> Sir, President Petrov is on the line.<eos> I'll take it in here.<eos> Shut the door, please.<eos> - Viktor.<eos> - We know it was your men.<eos> What was?<eos> Did you think we wouldn't detect you?<eos> Whatever you're accusing us of, I don't know anything about it.<eos> Oh, yes, you do.
He thinks it's like smearing her mouth with blood.<eos> Vice and Virtue.<eos> Please explain.<eos> My trousers, clean.<eos> Variations, romances, sometimes soft, sometimes brutal.<eos> And nothing can be explained, at least properly.<eos> He to himself for his own.<eos> My little moon beam!<eos> You've regained your randiness!<eos> You did!
Brittany helped.<eos> So what?<eos> This is her dream board, not yours.<eos> The subconscious never lies.<eos> Is nursie on paquet's list Of those who had access to the credit card?<eos> Yes.<eos> She did it. She rented the car.<eos> Check her computer.<eos> Do I have your permission to search this computer?<eos> No, you do not.
If the body was dumped three days ago and we haven't found it yet, it means it's off the beaten path.<eos> Hope you don't mind me asking, but how'd you know there was a body down here?<eos> It's, uh, it's kind of what we do.<eos> Melissa Drake.<eos> All right, ligature marks around her neck.<eos> Petechial hemorrhage in her eyes.<eos> Both Cade and Melissa were strangled.<eos> Number one.<eos> You got something?<eos> Sure did.
Turning you Fae...<eos> It could kill you.<eos> Instantly.<eos> What?<eos> No I...<eos> You can't fix me?<eos> It's just that with other diseases, I know what I'm dealing with.<eos> But with this...<eos> I don't.<eos> Well, I do!
You've never been able to Doubt me.<eos> You really think you have what it takes?<eos> Do you really think you can hide the truth from me?<eos> Do you really think you can hide what you know about Freyja... you're not capable of it.<eos> I can't...<eos> I'm...<eos> I swore to...<eos> I swore to protect her.<eos> She's here.<eos> You did it.
You're right, I can't fake it.<eos> I know a fraud when I see one.<eos> And buddy, you're it.<eos> So, if you try to go after my friends, just know you'll have to go through me first.<eos> Too bad you're stuck in here.<eos> Is that what I am?<eos> Stop beating yourself up.<eos> Bo, if I had just given her the serum when I had the chance...<eos> Look, you had no way of knowing.<eos> But now you do.
Is that a horse or a dragon?<eos> It's the Pyrippus.<eos> If Hades walks among us, we must take action.<eos> We risk revealing the Fae.<eos> We have no choice, we must protect our own at all costs.<eos> Says the Fae who kills humans in broad daylight.<eos> What the hell is this?<eos> A Consilium?<eos> I told you to gather the Light Fae.<eos> I did.
We both know whose voice is on that tape, and who's on the video with O'Bannon.<eos> You were trying to protect Danny.<eos> I get it.<eos> He's your brother.<eos> It's complicated.<eos> That's why I was willing to let you take the lead, but...<eos> What about these girls, huh?<eos> Vicente Cruz lost a daughter, you remember?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I do.
Yes, I just need to get some air.<eos> Everybody okay in there?<eos> No one critical?<eos> Everything's fine.<eos> How's your crew holding up?<eos> The entire ER nursing staff of a major city hospital walked out and nobody cared, so it's a tragedy.<eos> - Do you want some help?<eos> - From you?<eos> Just 'cause I'm not standing out here with you guys doesn't mean that I don't agree with what you're doing.<eos> Actually, it does.
Disgustingly good at pranks! God, you know, before I go on, can I just say, this is really disrespectful to Carol.<eos> The other Carol.<eos> The late Carol. Uh, but, you know, back to this prank.<eos> So, you know, God, it was gonna be such a great one, a-and then you guys all just ruined it.<eos> I feel so bad for you... You missed out on this wonderful thing.<eos> I mean, see, I was gonna...<eos> I was gonna, uh... uh, uh... What... what was gonna happen was, when we got out to those hot springs,<eos> I was gonna say, "Hey, wait...<eos> I need my bathing suit." Then I was gonna lead you back to our cul-de-sac, introduce you to all these people who mean the most to me in the world.<eos> 'Cause you do...
No kidding.<eos> All right, what do we know about ABADDON?<eos> Aren't they some kind of anarchist hacker group?<eos> All about bringing down the system?<eos> I don't know, but if what they're plotting is the sin that breaks the next Horseman's seal...<eos> Then every minute counts.<eos> Peter, how much time is left on ABADDON's countdown clock?<eos> About 35 hours.<eos> Well, do we know anything about their leader?<eos> Nobody does.
Nadia's father died... we had no choice.<eos> But to be honest, I worry about her.<eos> If you share what we're doing with Alan, you could put him in the same kind of danger.<eos> And this scar... is from when I wrestled a polar bear.<eos> Okay, you two, it's time for bed.<eos> But Raul was telling me about his scars.<eos> Well, I'll tell you what, sunshine, if you go to bed right now, I'll tell you about the scar I got when I got zapped from an electric eel.<eos> - Mom has a scar.<eos> - No, I don't.<eos> Yes, you do... right there.
I know.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> I was abandoned once.<eos> Cast aside by those who should've cared, but I stood up and fought back.<eos> And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
And you can do the same, Leland.<eos> Do you know what it's like to lose someone?<eos> To have them just snatched away from you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> You're a son who lost his mother.<eos> I'm a mother who lost her son.<eos> I know.<eos> They deserve to suffer just like your mother did.<eos> No, they don't!
I am allergic to everything you're saying.<eos> Don't be a pooper.<eos> - Less is more.<eos> - More is more.<eos> This needs to make up for every marriage that never happened at All Saints.<eos> I will not fall victim to catastrophic bad taste because of your failed relationships.<eos> My relationship with Coop failed by choice.<eos> Prentiss and I consciously uncoupled.<eos> We have to nail it.<eos> Yes, we do.
He said he remembers.<eos> Everything.<eos> Thanks.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Bye.<eos> Daddy!<eos> Hello, Henry.<eos> My God.<eos> So, you remember me?<eos> Of course I do.
I didn't have any say in any of this.<eos> You sat there on the phone with me last night, asking me questions...<eos> I don't...<eos> I don't agree with how this was handled, but Sean is the only one with inside information about this thing.<eos> He's a person, not some object for you to have your scientist experiments on.<eos> They're your scientists, too, Claire.<eos> They work for all of us.<eos> This isn't some underground, mercenary operation.<eos> This is the sovereign, federal government of the United States of America trying to protect our children from a threat that we don't fully understand.<eos> But Sean does, Wes.
That's curious, don't you think?<eos> I'm sure he had his reasons.<eos> And I wonder why you're lying to me, Ted.<eos> I'm not lying to you, Janet.<eos> Okay, maybe not, but you're sure not telling me something.<eos> I asked him to leave.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would you do that?<eos> And I asked him to tell you the reason.<eos> Well, he didn't.
He can bear down on you sometimes.<eos> "Bear down"?<eos> Corner you.<eos> Like you're trapped.<eos> Like there's no way out.<eos> And what do you want to do when you feel that way?<eos> Run.<eos> Run like the devil.<eos> That's a very reasonable impulse, Tawney.<eos> But I never did.
- Well, that was handy. - OK...<eos> - Doors boarded up, should give us a minute to figure this out.<eos> (glass breaking) - Or not.<eos> - Keep your hands on the door,<eos> I'll cover the windows.<eos> - I don't understand!<eos> Why do they want me?<eos> ! - They're coming for the people they're closest to.<eos> - Ah! - I only wanted to help.<eos> - Oh, you did.
Cute shirt, by the way.<eos> Have I borrowed that?<eos> Probably not.<eos> Well, maybe I should.<eos> Can I get a refill?<eos> I didn't sleep last night.<eos> Aria, I was here all night.<eos> Holbrook didn't come to the party.<eos> There's no way he could have left you that bookmark.<eos> All right, well, somebody did.
No.<eos> Mrs. Flores won't be paying my legal fees.<eos> That obligation will fall to the city of Los Angeles.<eos> - How much? - Ballpark, I'll probably bill them $550,000.<eos> Good luck with that.<eos> Oh, they'll squawk, go through the motions.<eos> Little do-si-do around the dance floor a couple of times, do the ritual back-and-forth.<eos> And then we'll settle at $250,000, $275,000?<eos> So they call you Money.<eos> That, they do.
- O'Shea.<eos> - Son of a bitch.<eos> - There's the cloud, you know?<eos> - What do you mean, the cloud?<eos> - The backup to the cloud.<eos> If you have a drive, I'll dub you a copy.<eos> Fuck O'Shea.<eos> Did you see what he did back there?<eos> I don't have a drive.<eos> I do.
Janet.<eos> Oh, don't cry, my darling.<eos> Don't cry.<eos> I'm here,<eos> I'm right here.<eos> Janet.<eos> Where are you, where are you?<eos> What you did yesterday was very cruel.<eos> You rang my home and made my wife believe that it was our daughter Janet.<eos> Did I?
- Yeah, I love you too, Sammi.<eos> Okay.<eos> Rise and shine.<eos> Ian's coming home from the cuckoo's nest this morning.<eos> So let's all make a little effort to make him feel welcome.<eos> Yes, dear.<eos> Good thinking.<eos> Breakfast in five.<eos> - My mom shot you?<eos> - Yes, she did.
Anyway, he's going on tour for a while.<eos> So I don't know.<eos> Maybe it's a good thing.<eos> - You figure out tuition?<eos> - No. No, I got an idea, though.<eos> Is it an idea that could land you in jail?<eos> - You're here for Ian Gallagher?<eos> - Yeah. Come with me.<eos> - I thought Mickey would be here.<eos> - Yeah? I didn't.
Get a prescription and you can have a refill.<eos> Come on. Come on.<eos> - When did you fall in love with yours?<eos> - There's no falling. Just being.<eos> He comes out, they hand him to me, everything changes.<eos> Before Yevgeny, I was selfish.<eos> Now I would die before I let him die.<eos> It's simple. Complete.<eos> I never made that change.<eos> Kev did, I didn't.
- Hey, hi. Hey, guys.<eos> - Hi.<eos> Did you bring an extra amp?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I brought the extra, extra amp.<eos> - I thought that one was broken.<eos> Lots of hours to fix that on the road.<eos> So you told them, huh?<eos> You didn't tell your friends?<eos> No, I did.
Been listening to them for so fucking long that... I don't even know who the fuck I am.<eos> You're a survivor.<eos> Everything else just dust in your eyes. Blink it away, man.<eos> I don't know.<eos> I'll get your stuff.<eos> Take it to another hotel, all right?<eos> I just don't know how to be... out in the world, man.<eos> Hey, look out that window.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Nobody does.
How many at Vinci?<eos> Wewantanyviolation involving this incident dropped. And we want Miss Lindel's earlier probation violation expunged.<eos> That was your publicist, right?<eos> Got the tabloids to try smearing him?<eos> And now you feel okay about dropping the allegation?<eos> I've learned a lot in therapy.<eos> I'm listening to my higher power.<eos> I saved lives in Vinci.<eos> Oh, and did they fully account for whose bullets killed those civilians?<eos> Yeah, they did.
No.<eos> Now, Cordell told me if I waited long enough, he could grow me a new face from my own cells.<eos> But I was adamant it was your face I wanted.<eos> I was looking at your face while you were watching me cut mine off and I thought,<eos> "Oh, that's a nice face."<eos> You're going under now, Mr. Verger.<eos> When you wake up, your face will be bound and uncomfortable.<eos> Have you accepted Jesus, Mr. Graham?<eos> Do you have faith?<eos> I do.
I've got everything I need from you now.<eos> You can't kill me, Margot.<eos> You'll lose everything.<eos> "In the absence of an heir, the sole beneficiary is the Southern Baptist Church."<eos> But there is going to be an heir, Mason.<eos> A Verger baby.<eos> Yours, mine...<eos> - Mostly yours.<eos> - Do you know what happens if we stimulate your prostate gland with a cattle prod?<eos> Hannibal does.
Three times maximum.<eos> I wasn't the only one!<eos> We lost touch, then she called to say I was her son's dad.<eos> I made things quite clear then.<eos> I'm amazed that it's come back to haunt me, 20 years later!<eos> Why did she say it then?<eos> What part of it do you not understand?<eos> Your life doesn't interest me.<eos> - I want the baby to have a dad.<eos> - But he doesn't!
Alright?<eos> - You're not wearing glasses.<eos> - A little champagne?<eos> - Yes, alright.<eos> Stéphane.<eos> - Some champagne.<eos> - Yes, Mr. Pagani.<eos> - You come here often?<eos> - I like this place.<eos> Most women do.
There we are.<eos> Little foot is in.<eos> Now, how about your little poppers?<eos> Yes. Little popper time.<eos> There we are. Lovely.<eos> They love to be spoken to.<eos> - What, in that tone?<eos> - Of course.<eos> We don't like loud voices.<eos> No, we don't...
Chicken and veg or pizza?<eos> Alright then.<eos> - Let me do it.<eos> - No, I'll do it.<eos> No.<eos> I'll do it and then go.<eos> No. I prefer to do it.<eos> At least I know it'll be done properly.<eos> You didn't burp her last time.<eos> I didn't?
I'd prefer to go alone. Really.<eos> But I want to be there at every stage, to be sure it's done properly, and that you...<eos> "Sure it's done properly"?<eos> Gabrielle.<eos> Gabrielle!<eos> What's wrong?<eos> What's the matter?<eos> Is it the baby?<eos> - Don't you want it?<eos> - Of course I do.
No!<eos> Don't tell mom or dad.<eos> They'll wonder where I got it.<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get out of here.<eos> What are you boys doing in here?<eos> This is private property.<eos> Do you know what happens to trespassers?<eos> Nobody lives here.<eos> They do now.
So why did you move next to us and not tell mom?<eos> There were hard feelings.<eos> Family is complicated.<eos> Very complicated.<eos> But nevertheless, family must always stick together.<eos> That's why i was dedicated to finding you, and I'm determined to make things right.<eos> You mustn't tell Cathy or Chris about me.<eos> I'll tell them myself when the time is right.<eos> My dad's come up with a "no secrets" policy in our family.<eos> He did?
Good boy.<eos> I don't revolt you, do I?<eos> Melodie?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Hey, there.<eos> How are you feeling, Bart?<eos> Okay.<eos> And how is Malcolm feeling?<eos> He went away.<eos> Oh, he did, did he?
A woman that can be bought... isn't worth having.<eos> I'm partial to Italian.<eos> - We agree on more than art. -<eos> Vanessa.<eos> Wilson.<eos> Eat it, you little bastard.<eos> My mom wanted me to be a butcher, you know that?<eos> Oh, not the butcher story.<eos> I said, "No, Mom, I want to be a lawyer. " I don't remember what I said next.<eos> No, you never do.
- What do you mean "texture"?<eos> - Just... you gotta be there.<eos> The music is for effect.<eos> It's time and aggression...<eos> Technical wizardry.<eos> And it's shared live... and then it's over.<eos> The energy can't last.<eos> Unless you're Iggy Pop.<eos> Yeah, well good for him, but I don't think I wanna be in my 70's still listening to Minor Threat.<eos> - But Tiger does.
So it wasn't because... I was his father?<eos> I wish you were Val's father.<eos> But do the math.<eos> I know. I've done the math.<eos> All those times I drunk-dialed you, we never... did anything?<eos> You're not Val's father.<eos> You're a good friend who did me a favor that I can never repay.<eos> So you didn't pick up Sebastian on the day he disappeared?<eos> No.<eos> But you did other times?
And why not?<eos> You were just across the street while her husband was off protecting his country, protecting you.<eos> I don't blame her.<eos> Elaine was alone, scared, vulnerable.<eos> You took advantage of that.<eos> Elaine?<eos> What?<eos> You just said Elaine.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yes, you did.
Or brace yourself for a full-court press.<eos> 'Cause they'll not only follow you, they'll follow your kids, your wife, your kids' friends.<eos> They'll reveal all your secrets.<eos> Well, you already did that when you leaked the news that I was Tom's father.<eos> That was a crime-lab error.<eos> We're looking into it.<eos> And I believe you.<eos> You should.<eos> I don't think you have any idea the nightmare that's coming your way.<eos> Yes, I do.
Nothing seems to do the trick.<eos> I-i can't help but feel like Adrian just isn't attracted to me anymore.<eos> How long has this been going on?<eos> The last month or so.<eos> It's strange because our marriage Is better than ever, really.<eos> We recently got some much-needed closure On -- on the death of our son.<eos> Ah. So no more of the constant fighting.<eos> How does that make you feel, adrian?<eos> Well, nobody enjoys fighting all the time.<eos> Some people do.
I'm thrilled!<eos> This is all i ever wanted, To have a child with the woman i love.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Am i really going to be a dad?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, you are.<eos> Hi. Oh, g-god!<eos> Blanca.<eos> You said i could move my things in here tonight.<eos> Right. I did.
At a local country club. Police are trying to determine<eos> Whether or not the victim knew -- [ sighs ] i was watching that.<eos> It's such an awful story.<eos> I don't want katy accidentally listening to it.<eos> I need to know what's going on.<eos> Police questioned genevieve last night.<eos> She's a person of interest in the case.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> You -- you think she had something to do with it?<eos> No, i don't.
Please give me one good reason I shouldn't fire you right this instant.<eos> Genevieve delatour made a sex tape.<eos> Ernesto.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Are we alone?<eos> Spence took miguel to a movie.<eos> What do we need to talk about?<eos> I saw the way you were looking at me today.<eos> You wanted me.<eos> No, i didn't.
Ernesto.<eos> We need to talk.<eos> Are we alone?<eos> Spence took miguel to a movie.<eos> What do we need to talk about?<eos> I saw the way you were looking at me today.<eos> You wanted me.<eos> No, i didn't.<eos> And i wanted you, too.<eos> No, you didn't.
I need you to release me.<eos> I understand.<eos> You feel guilty and it's breaking your heart.<eos> Yes.<eos> Exactly.<eos> And that's why I'm gonna help you.<eos> Thank you.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> You don't want me to sign this.<eos> Yes, I do.
Her.<eos> When I thought something was gonna happen to her today...<eos> I realized... You love her.<eos> [Cries] Here you go.<eos> [Chuckles] Oh, my God!<eos> She's perfect.<eos> All right, no more surfing down the stairs, please?<eos> And you'll need to stay off that ankle for a couple of weeks.<eos> Do you have anybody who can take care of you?<eos> - She sure does.
I need to see you.<eos> I love you.<eos> Sure.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Carmen? [Cellphone beeps]<eos> You have a boyfriend?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Well...<eos> - I want to meet him.<eos> - No, you don't.
Oh, wow. I promise I'll show you a good time.<eos> [Giggles] Oh! Hands off, bitch! [Glass shatters]<eos> [Clears throat] So much for the high road.<eos> ♪ I'm so glad we're doing this.<eos> You know, maybe we can make this a regular thing.<eos> [Chuckles] Maybe.<eos> So, Doug, how did you meet this beautiful lady?<eos> - Well...<eos> - You don't want to hear about that.<eos> Yes, I do.
I never learn, do I?<eos> Darling, I just spoke with Joy.<eos> Did you really drive her to tears?<eos> It was just a misunderstanding.<eos> But the truth is, I miss Zoila.<eos> No, no, no, no.<eos> You just think you do.<eos> You actually have a form of Stockholm Syndrome, where hostages empathize with their captors.<eos> Zoila never took me hostage.<eos> Well, in a way, she did.
You're the one looking for your old couch, right?<eos> Actually, it belonged to my boss, Mrs. Stappord.<eos> She thinks her wedding ring might be in between the sofa cushions.<eos> Do you still have it?<eos> If we still got it, it's over there.<eos> - Knock yourself out.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> You find what you're looking for?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
I'll fix it.<eos> Oh, yes, you will, because if you lose Deion... you lose me.<eos> Well, honey, he can sleep in the guest room.<eos> Well, think fast, 'cause I have to get my son out of here.<eos> - (Beep) - Look.<eos> I know it seems crazy, but the Powells really do love Deion.<eos> Letting him stay here might be the best thing for him.<eos> Listen, lady.<eos> You have no idea what I'm going through.<eos> Actually, I do.
I already did.<eos> You were right.<eos> It is blood, and I'm betting it's Louie Becker's.<eos> So then we have proof.<eos> Mrs. Taylor was involved with Louie's death.<eos> And Blanca's.<eos> I told you.<eos> There's no way Taylor's the one who killed them.<eos> But she knows who did.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Oh, I thought you were mad at me.<eos> Where was the last place you had it?<eos> - If I knew, it wouldn't be lost.<eos> - Oh, let's see.<eos> The last text you sent was... when you were with Jacklyn.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I left my phone at your house!<eos> It's okay.<eos> I'll go home and find it.<eos> What if she already did?
It's okay.<eos> I'll call the gym for you.<eos> Which one is it?<eos> You know what? I don't wanna trouble you.<eos> I'll call them myself.<eos> Uh, sorry to interrupt.<eos> Carmen Luna to see you... without an appointment.<eos> You know, it's not a good time, Carmen.<eos> I just wanted to ask you if I left my phone at your house.<eos> You did.
But i will help.<eos> Great, 'cause we got a ton of work to do.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Five centimeters?<eos> Killing the game, baby.<eos> (chuckles) Did you ever think when we first met That we'd be having a baby together?<eos> Uh, no-- when we first met, i never thought i'd see you again.<eos> Hey. I thought you were spoiled, And i thought you were a brat.<eos> W... Yeah, well, i thought you were a jerk.<eos> I still do sometimes.
I mean, my life is in bluebell.<eos> Yours is in nashville.<eos> It's only been a couple of weeks and it's already too hard!<eos> It just doesn't matter, huh?<eos> It-it just, it-it doesn't matter that we-we want to be together?<eos> It doesn't matter that we have, like, we have great chemistry?<eos> It doesn't matter that i love you?<eos> Did you just say that you love me?<eos> Yes.<eos> I did.
'Cause I wanted it to be me. And, uh...<eos> 'Cause of what's coming next.<eos> They're gonna need to look into us.<eos> Nixon's people.<eos> They're gonna go deep.<eos> Into both of us.<eos> Into the firm, the whole damn thing.<eos> But once you told me manson was out, I took some steps.<eos> Padded the paychecks of a couple slobs at missing persons to call me in case anyone asked about that poor girl's file.<eos> This morning, someone did.
No. No, no, no.<eos> We got a picture?<eos> We do not, lost to the ages.<eos> We got prints?<eos> Vice does have prints.<eos> Fine, give me my marching orders.<eos> Calling all pds.<eos> Check and see if they got a Jane Doe body dump matches her description.<eos> Start with LA county, then go to ventura and orange.<eos> Done.
Sure.<eos> Who's Lois Miller?<eos> She reported Caroline beecher missing.<eos> I don't know if she's a friend or another "pros" or what.<eos> After seven years, you're not expecting a happy ending, are you?<eos> Why would I start now?<eos> I like your little hat.<eos> Guess you talked to Lucille.<eos> Uh, yeah.<eos> Yeah, I did.
There won't be nothing to hold on to, nothing to lean on.<eos> We're gonna look all the way inside, and see if we can work out what we are doing here!<eos> Two smiley faces, each.<eos> Get 'em from little Jess.<eos> Lock down what needs to be locked down, and then prepare to fall into the hole.<eos> Two tabs, isn't that a lot?<eos> We don't usually take that much.<eos> I've never taken two at once.<eos> No, please, Charlie, he said he'd be back,<eos> Elliot did.
And you didn't know that I was hurt.<eos> Tommy, if you're gonna hide stuff from me, I'm out.<eos> I'm not gonna play house.<eos> I'm all in or nothing.<eos> The cunt was trying to hit Ghost.<eos> We had problems with people taking shots at us, but it's all under control now.<eos> The guy that ordered the hit is gone.<eos> Why did you lie to me in the first place?<eos> Ghost asked you to lie, didn't he?<eos> Yes, he did.
20 bucks here, 15 there.<eos> For years.<eos> Making up for what he did, killing that boy.<eos> - Seeking redemption.<eos> - Why not?<eos> You really think he's our guy?<eos> - He's a child molester.<eos> - Doesn't make him a killer.<eos> They all start somewhere.<eos> Yeah, they do.
No permanent damage.<eos> It aches in the winter when it rains. That's about it.<eos> What did it feel like...<eos> Getting shot?<eos> Well, it burned like hell.<eos> Everything kind of went numb.<eos> How long were you down?<eos> Three months. Light duty.<eos> I hope they gave you a medal.<eos> Yeah, they did.
She'll be okay, but she really should see a doctor.<eos> Her boyfriend's an ophthalmologist, but he's on vacation with his wife.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Does one of you live here?<eos> Mrs. Voorhees didn't tell me that she had a daughter.<eos> Jacqueline?<eos> I'm her stepdaughter.<eos> And you're what, the new Hunong?<eos> I'm Kimmy, and I'm going to have to tell your stepmother that you were drinking.<eos> No, you don't.
♪ They alive, damn it ♪<eos> ♪ It's a miracle ♪<eos> ♪ Unbreakable ♪<eos> ♪ They alive, damn it ♪<eos> That's gonna be, uh... you know, a fascinating transition. ♪ Damn it ♪<eos> Oh, uh, Mrs. Voorhees.<eos> Buckley just remembered that his family-tree project is due today.<eos> Now, I found a bunch of stuff online about the Voorhees side.<eos> - We owned people.<eos> - We still do, honey.
Don't shoot!<eos> Don't move!<eos> Don't shoot!<eos> - Get on the ground.<eos> - I didn't do it!<eos> Get on the fucking ground.<eos> Grab that ground!<eos> - I didn't do it!<eos> - Shut your fucking mouth.<eos> I didn't do it, man!
And I carried him up the hill.<eos> I carried my boy up the hill, and I buried him.<eos> I buried my own son like an animal.<eos> And you're sure he was dead when you carried him up the hill?<eos> He was dead.<eos> I couldn't wake him up.<eos> And you carried him up the hill by yourself, Mr. Delacroix?<eos> No one helped?<eos> Just me.<eos> I did it.
Where you going, Harry?<eos> Tell Sheila Delacroix her father just confessed to murdering her brother.<eos> I don't believe it.<eos> Miss Delacroix, your father described the events in detail.<eos> I'm sorry, but my father is not a violent man, detective.<eos> He never hit me or Arthur... never.<eos> Your mother says he hit her... hard and often.<eos> - That's why she left.<eos> - You spoke to my mother?<eos> We did, in fact, a couple of times.
Keeping Paul away from Lucy?<eos> It's over.<eos> Paul's dead.<eos> Thebodyhas nowsinceconfirmed tobethatofPaul Malloy, whowaspreviouslythought tohavediedyearsago.<eos> A man I slept with just tested H.I.V. Positive. Oh, my god.<eos> I'm not sure if I believe in god anymore.<eos> Is it positive or negative?<eos> Just tell me the damn results.<eos> You want to marry me today?<eos> Yeah. I do.
Do I --<eos> I'm Greta's silent partner.<eos> Yeah, but now that the little lady is opening a club in Paris, it would appear my silent days are over.<eos> I'll be taking care of all the pesky little front-of-house details.<eos> Great.<eos> Uh, so this is a -- is this a staff meeting?<eos> Should I have known about this? Uh, well, I don't know.<eos> Uh, do you see any kitchen guys here?<eos> Uh, no.<eos> You don't.
[ Sighs ] Karen.<eos> I'm sorry, I shouldn't be burdening you with this.<eos> Okay, the last thing that you are is a burden.<eos> But...<eos> But?<eos> But it sounds like your friend has had a hard blow and is taking some time for herself.<eos> What's so bad about that?<eos> Look, when I get angry like you are -- you get angry?<eos> Hard to believe, I know.<eos> But when I do,
So Harry insisted on creating a special sushi menu just for us.<eos> You really didn't have to go to so much trouble.<eos> Are you kidding? After you went so out of your way to be so sweet to me and Lucy?<eos> Plus, I love sushi, too.<eos> I mean, the rules, the rituals, the beauty of the presentation.<eos> Did you know that when you're not using your chopsticks, you should place them in front of you, parallel to the edge of the sushi bar with the narrow end in the hashi oki?<eos> That's what this cute little thing is called... hashi oki.<eos> I googled it.<eos> I never knew that.<eos> Well, now you do.
What is there to talk about?<eos> There's a lot to talk about.<eos> I felt something the other night... something that I haven't felt in a long time.<eos> And I know that Alec did, too.<eos> Don't put words in my mouth.<eos> Then say something!<eos> I felt something, too.<eos> I don't know what it means.<eos> Maybe it doesn't mean anything.<eos> Or maybe it does.
I don't need a psychiatrist, Calista.<eos> I need your support.<eos> I give you support.<eos> No, you don't.<eos> You have no idea what it's like for me, the amount of pressure I'm under every single day.<eos> We're both under pressure.<eos> Can you at least try and understand what it's like for me?<eos> Okay.<eos> I want to help.<eos> No, you don't.
I just... you know, I didn't... I didn't do this for this.<eos> You didn't do what for what?<eos> Lose my sister to casually date you.<eos> - Just... this is real for me, Harry.<eos> - Okay. - Okay, it... it has to be it.<eos> - So this is about Savi.<eos> - No! - I get it now.<eos> That's the rush.<eos> You don't want to move in together because you want to be with me.<eos> No, I do.
Thank you, Frank.<eos> I'll take it from here.<eos> No, I'll take it.<eos> What the hell were you thinking?<eos> They're not even my cigarettes.<eos> It's not a big deal.<eos> Not a big deal?<eos> You could have started a forest fire, and I did not raise you to pollute the precious little lungs God gave you.<eos> Does this mean we can go home now?<eos> No, it doesn't, little girl.
Wait, w-why would I wear a pair of star-spangled underpants for this photo shoot?<eos> 'Cause we're hitting the newsstands in July, baby.<eos> - Right? - [Chuckles] Yep.<eos> But what... what's this got to do with top 10 chefs in L.A.?<eos> Top 10 sexiest chefs in L.A.<eos> - Hold that thought.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I'll give you a moment.<eos> You said "top 10 chefs in L.A."<eos> - Did I?
Good reason for that.<eos> Denise, really?<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> We... we can fix it.<eos> Yeah. I just need to grab my pins.<eos> Okay, go ahead.<eos> Come on.<eos> Turn around.<eos> Men like women with their hair down.<eos> At least your husband does.
Go.<eos> Hello.<eos> - I'm here.<eos> - Thank god!<eos> Where is she?<eos> Follow me.<eos> Hmm. What's going on?<eos> Shouldn't the show already be started by now?<eos> I-I don't even know why I care anymore, really.<eos> I really don't.
You think I wanna hurt Joss?<eos> But damn!<eos> I am really disappointed in him.<eos> I thought Harry was better than that.<eos> I know.<eos> Me, too.<eos> Y'all are pathetic.<eos> Predictable and pathetic.<eos> Why you mad at me?<eos> I didn't do anything.
- Okay, well, I was the head chef, uh, and owner of Savannah's kitchen.<eos> Actually, we closed a little over a year...<eos> Let me stop you.<eos> I'm not interested in the past.<eos> It's not important.<eos> Why are you here now?<eos> I was told you might be able to...<eos> Make me famous.<eos> - Why do you want to be famous?<eos> - I don't, actually.
He was slimeball before.<eos> He's a super slimeball now.<eos> That's it.<eos> Okay?<eos> Honey!<eos> Honey, please...<eos> Answer me this question.<eos> Answer me this one question.<eos> Do you actually care about the accessories line?<eos> Do you?
The staff is gonna hang tonight.<eos> Why don't you stay and play?<eos> You don't have a girlfriend to rush back to, right?<eos> Yeah, maybe some other time.<eos> Aw, man!<eos> Hey, Marc, can I talk to you for a second?<eos> Aw, it's the smell, isn't it?<eos> Oh, it's not that.<eos> You know Blair, right?<eos> Uh, yes, April, I do.
- I'm hungry.<eos> What happened to the pork rinds and the twinkies you bought at the liquor store?<eos> Scotty gave them to that homeless person with the dog.<eos> Look... more helicopters.<eos> Where are we going?<eos> Trust me... this is way better than a movie.<eos> What's better than a movie?<eos> A piece of art history.<eos> Do you know any influential artists, Lucy?<eos> Because I do... your mom.
Like in "the bodyguard"?<eos> Yeah, if Whitney Houston was a white republican who called his wife "mother."<eos> - Mm. - No, it's... it's a decent gig.<eos> You know, I-I can take time off when I want, so...<eos> I'm actually taking art classes.<eos> Art?<eos> Really?<eos> You know, the guy I was when I was with you, he's not that different from the guy I am.<eos> And if I remember correctly, we made one hell of a painting together.<eos> Yeah, we sure did.
What are you doing here?<eos> Um, I, uh...<eos> I actually have an interview with Mr. Boone for the new restaurant he's opening.<eos> Wow.<eos> Good for you.<eos> So, um...<eos> How's married life?<eos> Oh, you know.<eos> Nope.<eos> I don't.
I'll just run to the store super-quick, okay?<eos> You're really gonna leave right now?<eos> Just keep that bed nice and warm.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Where's your champagne?<eos> You're an idiot.<eos> Why?<eos> Because you've been going on and on about how you wouldn't be here hadn't you been to the beach that day...<eos> If you'd made a different choice.<eos> But even if you did...
That woman is no good.<eos> No good since the day I met her.<eos> And w-where did your son meet Carla?<eos> Some bar.<eos> He just moved to New York. He didn't know anyone.<eos> And they just started dating?<eos> It was all very fast.<eos> He said he met this girl, and after that, they were together all the time.<eos> I knew he was gonna marry her.<eos> And he did.
What?<eos> Why?<eos> What -- how would they even make a connection?<eos> They didn't.<eos> Someone made it for them.<eos> Sandra contacted the police?<eos> She's so crazy.<eos> She has been after me for years!<eos> She didn't contact them, Calista.<eos> Joss' lawyer did.
Sure that it's, um...<eos> Yes.<eos> It's yours.<eos> Ours.<eos> Ours.<eos> Um, I thought you were...<eos> Aren't you on the pill?<eos> I was, but as it turns out, one in 11 women get pregnant while on the pill every year.<eos> Who knew?<eos> I certainly did not.
I'm so sorry.<eos> It is what it is, but I have always wanted to be a mother, and I think I'd be a pretty damn good one, too.<eos> So do I.<eos> But I'm not an idiot, Karen.<eos> I know there's none of me in there.<eos> I've got no genetic material in the mix.<eos> That's not what I think, and you know it.<eos> This baby was conceived out of love by all of us.<eos> It's as much yours as it is mine... if you want to be a part of its life.<eos> I do.
I don't think I'll ever look at a romper the same way again, you guys.<eos> Aww. At least you've still got your sense of humor.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Not really.<eos> I'm dead inside.<eos> Don't say that.<eos> David thinks you're getting out of here soon.<eos> What the hell does he know, right?<eos> I thought you liked David.<eos> I do.
I am well aware of that fact.<eos> She already told me.<eos> Oh, really?<eos> Would've thought that would've been kind of a deal-breaker.<eos> Well, it would be if she had a valid reason.<eos> But I know exactly why Lucy doesn't like Blair.<eos> It's because he is the first man who has been an authoritative figure in her life since Paul's death.<eos> Blair sets rules.<eos> Lucy hates rules.<eos> Every kid does.
Keep planning, but can you, uh... Can you just do it... do it from down here?<eos> Oh. - Just do that.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I just got excited.<eos> Yeah, I saw that.<eos> Oh, God, I just... Oh, baby, I think after everything that's happened, I-I... really, I just want to attack life.<eos> - You know?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You want to talk about what's happened?<eos> No, I do not.
I'm heading out to work.<eos> Why don't I throw your bags in the car?<eos> I'll help.<eos> I feel I should... Thank you for everything.<eos> No problem.<eos> Don't be mad at Marc.<eos> He didn't hide his drinking from you to be sneaky.<eos> He just didn't want you to think any less of him.<eos> I'm not sure he cares what I think.<eos> Well, of course he does.
I just thought that you wanted me to... come over.<eos> Well, then, yes, I did.<eos> Do you want some brisket?<eos> Welcome back.<eos> As we reach the final night of the tournament, the feeling in the room can only be described as sesquipedalian.<eos> Who gives a shit?<eos> I came to in the middle of the Irrawaddy River on a bamboo raft, and I had to improvise these oars, 'cause I could only row with one hand.<eos> The venom had rendered my right arm completely useless...<eos> Did you really eat somebody?<eos> Yes, I did.
I should have gotten that job.<eos> I-it wasn't really right for you.<eos> Why not?<eos> You have all these requirements -- A house by the beach, no vacuuming.<eos> Forget all that.<eos> I'll take anything.<eos> Just find me work.<eos> I'll try.<eos> No, don't try, marisol.<eos> Just do it.
Honestly, Chris, I feel like you should give them some of it.<eos> You should show them a little bit.<eos> Give them a little piece, a taste.<eos> Oh, you don't have to do that.<eos> - You don't have to.<eos> - We're at dinner.<eos> I was born the day the Challenger exploded.<eos> Honey, no.<eos> No, no, no.<eos> Do the ending, do the climax.
Jackie, your husband kind-of-not-really or whatever.<eos> Because I give a shit.<eos> Because when you focus on other people's problems... - ...it's a lot easier to ignore your own.<eos> - What's that supposed to mean? Nothing.<eos> It's just some NA bullshit.<eos> I'm here because I like you, asshole.<eos> You know, it's as if no one has ever said no to you, and you can't stand it.<eos> Now, you wait until your target's vulnerable, then you pounce. - What are you talking about?<eos> - Tell me what you're here for.<eos> - I just did. - Right.
How's Caleb doing with her laptop?<eos> He's not giving up, but he's not getting anywhere either.<eos> Guys, as long as Ali has an alibi, she's untouchable.<eos> So then we tear down her alibi.<eos> Her dad won't budge.<eos> I'm not talking about her dad.<eos> Hey, I didn't see you at the cemetery yesterday.<eos> Did you leave early?<eos> I guess.<eos> You did.
And... she was kind of talking about... everything.<eos> And, um, and she was... You know, she said was there was prostitution there, but...<eos> Alyssa said that she thought... that it was all being run by a cop.<eos> Okay, did she say who?<eos> She said she didn't know, but, Terry... I've been there a few times.<eos> I've only ever seen one cop there, and the girls... they know him. They flock to him.<eos> A-And I don't like what I'm thinking, but I'm... I'm feeling it.<eos> It's Junior.<eos> How did you know?<eos> I don't really, but...
- Yeah, I see that.<eos> - Book.<eos> - She wants you to read it.<eos> "Herr Brum has just started to do what he does every Tuesday."<eos> "When you grow up, you're going to be a train driver, Guld-Ivar exclaims."<eos> - Book isn't that fun.<eos> - No, I don't like it either.<eos> You have to speak with a story voice, and sound like a talking bear.<eos> - There aren't any talking bears.<eos> - This one does.
I know it.<eos> I'm gonna find out how he did it, and when I do... Oh. There's gonna be hell to pay.<eos> - But it was him.<eos> So, it was Bob Shapiro who made you live a double life while you were married with Barbara?<eos> I shut the press right down today, baby.<eos> You'll never hear another word about it.<eos> I handled it.<eos> Baby, you knew all that about me when we got married.<eos> Yeah, I knew it, Johnnie, but my friends didn't.<eos> Uh... My family didn't.

No, boy, this place ain't for you and me.<eos> It's good to have dreams, just so long as they're not fantasies.<eos> You let anybody sell you that shit, it's your own damn fault.<eos> - You hear me?<eos> - Yeah, I hear you, Pop.<eos> I'll get it to the House right away.<eos> - Green light on the release?<eos> - Yes.<eos> I don't remember giving you my phone number.<eos> You didn't.
This early, huh?<eos> I'm gonna be up three straight days once this hurricane hits.<eos> I need to get all the sleep I can.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> I'll leave you be.<eos> Have one of the stewards wake me when it hits the coast.<eos> Francis.<eos> Francis?<eos> Where did it make landfall?<eos> - It didn't.
How much does the da love that?<eos> We all love that.<eos> Cutler: Listen, it's your call, junior.<eos> Sammy here can go make two murder arrests that'll never stick, and blow your cover.<eos> Or, we just call this one last name on my naughty list.<eos> Mike: No.<eos> Shafe: Mike?<eos> Mike: Man, I'm done.<eos> -Look, I get it.<eos> Okay? -No, you don't, man.
-I said stop.<eos> I love all of you.<eos> The dark, light, the high, low.<eos> Everything you've ever done.<eos> What you pretend to be.<eos> Who you really are.<eos> I love everything.<eos> All of you.<eos> Do you love me?<eos> Do you?
- Don't talk that way!<eos> - I'll talk as I like.<eos> - No, don't talk to me that way!<eos> Calm down please, gentlemen!<eos> Whatever your implication is, Mr Lunes, this better stop right now.<eos> Especially as the police have arrested two men.<eos> They were present, their testimonies could clear you.<eos> Clear him?<eos> Did you know this, Mr Moreau?<eos> No, I didn't.
He's trashing my life!<eos> Harassing my wife and child!<eos> Don't jump to conclusions.<eos> It's all connected, don't you see?<eos> - You piece of shit.<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Calm down, that's enough.<eos> So Mr Moreau, you stand by your statement?<eos> Shouldn't I?<eos> Of course I do.
Here.<eos> Where's Dad?<eos> It's cool.<eos> My God!<eos> Where did you find that?<eos> In Dad's cupboard.<eos> - You could be dead!<eos> - It went off on its own.<eos> You're a total idiot!<eos> - It did!
You could never afford to leave the Queen alive, Rochefort.<eos> She knows you are a Spanish spy.<eos> She knows you are a murderer.<eos> You assaulted Her Majesty without invitation or provocation, and now, you intend to conceal your lies by accusing the innocent?<eos> It is Rochefort who is the traitor!<eos> Rochefort who is the enemy!<eos> And Rochefort who should BE ON TRIAL!<eos> MURMURING<eos> So you deny the charges?<eos> I do.
Not really what I expected.<eos> You sure this one's to be trusted?<eos> She knows this one's to be trusted.<eos> No more games, Tobin.<eos> I'm just surprised Sifter let you keep the party going.<eos> Trust a black hat once, shame on them.<eos> Trust a black hat twice...<eos> How long do you think you can deny the thirst, Nelson?<eos> You have no idea how much money can be made selling the secrets at your fingertips.<eos> But I do.
You give me that key or I'm gonna make your life miserable.<eos> Hacker handle.<eos> Quest.<eos> Let's play "get to know you" later.<eos> Clock is ticking.<eos> You crashed CommerceTicker.<eos> Yeah, that was me.<eos> Now what's the encryption key, Tobin?<eos> You must know Free4All.<eos> Of course I do.
You're with me.<eos> Bring your laptop.<eos> We need that password to find the bomb.<eos> Avery, we need to talk.<eos> There's nothing to talk about.<eos> Oh, yeah, there is.<eos> Avery!<eos> That Tobin is clearly up to something.<eos> You can't trust him.<eos> I don't.
Or he's playing us, and he's gonna disappear just like...<eos> Like Tobin?<eos> Black hats are hardwired to buck the system.<eos> Most can't be reformed.<eos> What do you want me to say, Elijah?<eos> I was wrong about Tobin.<eos> I will be wrong again.<eos> But I am not wrong about Nelson.<eos> I want you to be right, okay?<eos> I really do.
- Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> Your father's name was Dennis. Dennis.<eos> - Did you love him, too?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Your father regularly beat the shit out of your mother.<eos> Put her in the hospital six times.<eos> He beat you, too, didn't he?<eos> - No.<eos> - Of course he did.

What happened to your friends with the beards?<eos> They're all dead.<eos> You sure do have a knack for survival.<eos> You left me there to die, Sheriff.<eos> I'm not the sheriff.<eos> What do you want, an apology?<eos> No.<eos> I would have done the same thing.<eos> You know, being the sheriff never really suited you.<eos> No, it didn't.
Big... fenced, with trees.<eos> Why?<eos> If this pilgrim feels a special relationship with the moon, he might like to go outside and look at it, before he tidies himself up.<eos> If one were nude, say, it would be better to have outdoor privacy for that sort of thing.<eos> One must show some consideration for the neighbours.<eos> Have you ever seen blood in the moonlight, Will?<eos> It appears quite black.<eos> You've come to wag your finger?<eos> I love a good finger-wagging.<eos> Yes, you do.
Yes, you do.<eos> How is Margot?<eos> Your cogs are turning, Hannibal.<eos> I can hear them clicking.<eos> Click, click, boom.<eos> I don't know what you're planning with Will Graham, but you're planning something.<eos> Why wouldn't you be?<eos> You've already cracked the lid, can't resist peeling it back.<eos> Will came to me.<eos> Yes, he did.
Because I married your mom.<eos> Then you shouldn't put this guy in a mental hospital, you should kill him.<eos> I want to watch baseball.<eos> His team playing?<eos> He read about me in a Freddie Lounds article.<eos> I had to justify myself to an 11-year-old.<eos> Resentment's raising a blister in you, Will.<eos> You think you might lose me after this, Jack?<eos> You think I might go back to my family?<eos> - For a minute, I did.
I'm afraid she will come to the house to talk.<eos> I don't know what will happen in the house.<eos> The Dragon may come down.<eos> I know how easily she would tear.<eos> I think about what the Dragon will do to me if I don't serve her up.<eos> She called me a man.<eos> A sweet... man.<eos> I didn't hear...<eos> Reba's heart.<eos> I... didn't!
Yeah, yeah, we talked.<eos> They explain everything?<eos> You mean about Theresa?<eos> Yeah, that too.<eos> Nick told you that he sees things, right?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> And you do understand that everything Nick told you is all real?<eos> Yeah. I... uh...<eos> So you know all about...<eos> I do.
Well, I'm just a little...<eos> You know.<eos> Well, take your time.<eos> Now, you didn't tell anyone.<eos> No, no, of course not.<eos> Well, don't.<eos> Anything else?<eos> Are you...<eos> - You don't want to go there.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Could you check your phone just to make sure it's on, please?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> I didn't realize how tired I was.<eos> It's on. Nothing.<eos> It's been hours.<eos> Nick is doing everything he can.<eos> And where's Monroe?<eos> Why haven't they found him yet?<eos> Listen, I know this is difficult for you.<eos> No, you don't.
I'll see she's disciplined.<eos> My necklace!<eos> Did you say your necklace?<eos> Yes, it's very dear to me. I thought it lost.<eos> Angélique?<eos> Come now, the maid thought it yours.<eos> So what was it doing in your room?<eos> - It was not in my room. - Of course it was I just told you.<eos> - What was it doing in your room? - Madame, I did not take it.<eos> Absolutely I did not.
But we just call it a whipple.<eos> But I love your enthusiasm.<eos> See you in 30 minutes?<eos> Yeah, I'll grab us a couple coffees.<eos> What's going on?<eos> Um, come here.<eos> Husband accidentally shot his wife.<eos> Well, if anyone can save her, it's TC.<eos> Oh, don't put that kind of pressure on him!<eos> He already does enough of that himself.
He's different.<eos> About the same age as this kid, except he had a few live RPGs in his gut.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> You want to know what he said to me?<eos> He said he was sorry for getting me in this mess.<eos> He was afraid of getting me killed.<eos> You must have been scared to death.<eos> Well, actually, I was thinking, "this, uh, this thing goes off, there'd be nothing left of me to send home to Jordan and my mom."<eos> You're lucky it didn't go off.<eos> No, no, it did.

He's waiting for me.<eos> He will be worried.<eos> - And I have... - Hey.<eos> It looks like somebody made the evening gown round.<eos> Yes.<eos> This is Sandra.<eos> It's okay.<eos> She came in here tachy and hypotensive, and I am guessing, by her attire, that, uh, maybe she took some diet pills.<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did, for the competition.
There's the laceration.<eos> All right.<eos> I need 7-oh Prolene now.<eos> Your call has been forwarded to an automatic...<eos> Hey, Sandra.<eos> How you feeling?<eos> Okay.<eos> Uh, well, just so you know, I did some research online, and I found a few organizations where you can apply for college scholarships and... you don't know anything about my life.<eos> You're right.<eos> I don't.
You know, I've, uh, I've been where you are.<eos> I was a 5-star recruit, all-American,<eos> - 20-some-odd scholarships,<eos> - Man...<eos> I really don't want to hear about your stupid glory days right now.<eos> Now, that... that's true. That's true, my glory days.<eos> My glory days ended my freshman year when I fractured my back in training camp.<eos> Never played a game.<eos> I spent an entire year in traction, so, trust me, I do get where you're coming from.<eos> - I do.
Move it along, Padre.<eos> You got about 15 seconds.<eos> - Chloe, are you okay?<eos> - Do you take this woman to be your<eos> - wedded wife?<eos> - I do.<eos> Do you take this man to be your wedded husband?<eos> - I do.<eos> - Chloe?<eos> - She does.
To what?<eos> No, really.<eos> Adapt to what?<eos> Forget that I'll never be able to lead my troops into combat again.<eos> Forget that we'll never be able to climb Machu Picchu like we talked about.<eos> Forget that I'll never be able to build a house from the ground up.<eos> I can't even change a damn light bulb.<eos> Do you have any idea how that makes me feel?<eos> - I know it's hard.<eos> - No, you don't.
I don't either.<eos> So, you intubated Will.<eos> I did.<eos> You shouldn't have.<eos> He didn't want to suffer, okay?<eos> - He signed the DNR.<eos> That was his choice.<eos> - Three months ago.<eos> Who knows what he would have wanted today?<eos> Actually, I do.
Your loss.<eos> Yoga?<eos> Hell, no.<eos> I'm in.<eos> Hey, Jordan.<eos> Call him.<eos> He's all yours.<eos> I thought that Kim said she found a home for him.<eos> - Hi, buddy.<eos> - Yeah, she did.
What's his deal?<eos> He banging that intern with the legs?<eos> Well, aren't you the delicate, little flower.<eos> - Uh, yeah, they're involved. - For now.<eos> I mean, a female doctor with a male nurse...<eos> You ever seen that work?<eos> As a friend of them both, I'm surprised it's lasted this long.<eos> - It's good to know.<eos> - I didn't say anything.<eos> Yes, you did.
Good point.<eos> How about you?<eos> Yeah, I, uh, I partied a lot.<eos> I partied my way out of college.<eos> But, uh, my dad was okay.<eos> You know, he said you got to screw up to know what you want to do.<eos> I took that advice, and now I'm thinking about going to, like, a culinary arts institute, you know?<eos> Your dad sounds like a cool guy.<eos> Yeah. Well, my mom split when I was 4, and, uh, now I tell everybody that I feel like I won the dad lottery. And it's true.<eos> I did.
The Stingray.<eos> I loved that bike.<eos> Had the three-speed shifter on the frame.<eos> He'd never let me ride it.<eos> I bet he'd let you ride it now.<eos> Let's go back to your place.<eos> I'll make my famous Bloody Marys.<eos> I'll get the tab.<eos> Jordan called.<eos> Of course she did.
Well, she's here now, and you don't turn your back on family.<eos> - Are you mad at me?<eos> - No.<eos> I'm not mad at you.<eos> I was worried 'cause you could've died.<eos> I bet Jordan would've loved that.<eos> From what I hear, she's helped you quite a bit over the years.<eos> She told you that?<eos> No.<eos> Actually, she didn't.
Alex, I'm sure that your uncle is right.<eos> I mean, have you ever forgotten before?<eos> No.<eos> No, it's just I...<eos> I just...<eos> I ca... I ca... can't remember.<eos> Alex?<eos> BP's 220 systolic.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> What does that...
or, at the very least, an LVAD.<eos> We'll let him know what his options are when he wakes up.<eos> But for now, we should keep an eye on Alex's surgery.<eos> - He'll want to know how she's doing.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thanks.<eos> All right, bud.<eos> And we've just received hospital privileges for you to perform the surgery.<eos> Of course you did.
We should be there in 20 minutes.<eos> Good.<eos> Let's get him out of here.<eos> Done.<eos> That's great.<eos> Carl, you did great.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Yeah, thank you.<eos> S-so, you guys have boyfriends, or...<eos> Yeah, we do.
Yeah.<eos> All right, everybody, what do you say we go inside and get this party started?<eos> How about it?<eos> Um, Michael and Naomi, you have a wardrobe change.<eos> - You did?<eos> - I did.<eos> Really looking forward to the dance.<eos> Me too.<eos> Smells like beer here.<eos> Yes, it does.
With... with... uh, I-I thought all this P.T.S.D. was going away, and it hasn't.<eos> That sounds like progress to me.<eos> Look...<eos> For the record, the risks that you take, they scare me.<eos> But I do trust you.<eos> All right?<eos> It doesn't mean that I don't...<eos> Wanna smack you every once in a while.<eos> Hey, how did you not smack me all the time?<eos> - No, I did. - Mm-hmm.
She's really smart.<eos> What did you say to him?<eos> He told me he's been holding his pee to protect you.<eos> He told me that when he wets the bed, your husband knocks the crap out of you?<eos> I'm sorry, mom.<eos> I had to tell somebody.<eos> So, the dental work that showed up on your scan, the vertigo... that isn't from a car accident, is it?<eos> You need to get out.<eos> I understand what you're going through.<eos> - You don't.

It's not a question of lying.<eos> It's protecting.<eos> They told me my mom died when I was little.<eos> Then later I found out she died having me.<eos> When my dad was sick, he said he'd be fine, and six months later, he was dead.<eos> Rachel said she'd take care of me, and then tried to dump me on my Uncle then hide the fact that she's dying.<eos> That's not lying?<eos> Devin, I am so sorry.<eos> And I know that this must be...<eos> No, you don't.
- Are you?<eos> Look, I know how much this Ali means to you, but I need us to mean more.<eos> You... you are. How can you even...<eos> You left your family to go to a war zone when you didn't have to.<eos> You could've let someone else take that risk.<eos> - I'm sorry.<eos> - No.<eos> No, I am just so tired of keeping all this anger in.<eos> I-I never asked you to keep it in.<eos> Yes, you did.
Where are you going now?<eos> Maksim!<eos> Maksim!<eos> Italian-made combat shotgun.<eos> Designed to drop your enemy with one shot, so it's very popular with the special forces.<eos> Even if you had that kind of training, why risk a full-frontal assault?<eos> You'd have to be crazy.<eos> ~ Or desperate.<eos> ~ We should send his mugshot to the MOD.<eos> Already done it.
I know you're lying, Jessie.<eos> I'm not lying.<eos> You're Wesenrein, you're involved, and you know Shaw.<eos> Bauerschwein!<eos> You make me sick.<eos> Oh, you're a Grimm again?<eos> I don't know what you are, but you know what's wrong.<eos> Where's Monroe?<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
I will not let these girls out of my sight.<eos> I trusted you.<eos> You fucked me.<eos> I'm trying to save you.<eos> Please, Alex, stop pretending you care.<eos> I do care. This is the best thing for everyone.<eos> This is the best thing for you and Walter Larson, and the goddamn United fucking States.<eos> The goddamn fucking United States brings clean water into your homes. We bring medicine to you people...<eos> Did you just really say "you people"?<eos> - Did I?
I slept with someone.<eos> You're making this up.<eos> I wish I was.<eos> I caught them together.<eos> Tell him what it felt like, Neil.<eos> Tell me.<eos> My whole world exploded in that moment.<eos> I hated you.<eos> And I wanted to kill the son of a bitch she was with.<eos> I really did.
Well, good luck, Grace.<eos> (Grace) Neil?<eos> I really needed that.<eos> You smoke?<eos> Uh, if you don't mind, I should check and see if my daughter got back.<eos> Anika is your daughter?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That makes it even cooler, that message you yelled out.<eos> You play?<eos> My daughter does.
Did you get sick of all the teenagers at the festival?<eos> You spoke to Anika.<eos> Yeah.<eos> She told me about the money.<eos> You probably think that was a bad idea.<eos> No, I get it.<eos> You don't want her to make the same mistakes that we did.<eos> Grace, you should have seen her face.<eos> So Simon said you're going to stay with him.<eos> Yeah, of course he did.
I used to have to carry my inhaler everywhere.<eos> Now asthma's gone.<eos> My-my uncle... worst drunk you ever saw.<eos> Clean and sober, like poof.<eos> And beyond all that, everyone's acting weird.<eos> Everyone's getting along, all kum-bah-yah.<eos> Everyone's talking about moving on and whatnot.<eos> You saw her, man.<eos> I know you saw her.<eos> Okay, and what if I did?
Let's get you back up to your room before the Med Bot does her rounds.<eos> - Oh... - Those headaches again?<eos> We'll run some scans in the morning.<eos> Okay. Okay.<eos> Oh, Dave...<eos> Dave...<eos> Can you take me back to my room?<eos> Sure, sure.<eos> So, does Molly want a bedtime story?<eos> - Yes, I do. - Mm.
- Just take it!<eos> - No, not until you tell me what happened.<eos> Nothing happened.<eos> I... I just don't want to do this anymore.<eos> Okay, look, if you don't want to deal anymore, that's fine, but at least tell me what's going on.<eos> I'm getting back together with Griffin.<eos> What, are you crazy?<eos> Why?<eos> I love him.<eos> - No, you don't.
We need a recess.<eos> - I want to change my plea.<eos> - Again?<eos> This is dizzying, your honor.<eos> I plead guilty and confess to the murder of father Bernard.<eos> Your honor, I'd like to ask for an immediate mistrial.<eos> Because you had your client cause one?<eos> No, the state happily accepts father Crawford's plea.<eos> Your honor, he doesn't know what he's saying.<eos> I do, too, your honor.
- Played all of us.<eos> - Why are you letting them do this?<eos> No, you're not gonna get to manipulate your way out of this one.<eos> - I didn't manipulate anyone!<eos> - But you lied!<eos> - You said you didn't know this Rudy guy.<eos> - I didn't.<eos> Then how come he ended up in a mental institution?<eos> How should I freaking know?<eos> You do, though.
Rebecca's right.<eos> And where's the actual evidence that this was a crime of passion?<eos> Or are we supposed to just trust you, Mr. Walsh?<eos> And the detectives could have told Rebecca that Lila was strangled before they started taping her confession.<eos> And Rebecca lying about having Lila's phone doesn't mean that she's a killer.<eos> I mean, where's the facts?<eos> An explanation of how she got Lila's body up to the water tank?<eos> She didn't.<eos> They were already hanging out up there.<eos> - We never did that.
I know how messed up all this is, but I am here now. And after now?<eos> When you go home to her?<eos> I'm alone again, having a baby all by myself.<eos> You don't have to do this, Lila.<eos> You're 21 years old...<eos> I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> - So stop trying to change my mind.<eos> - I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?
You don't have to do this, Lila.<eos> You're 21 years old...<eos> I want this baby even if you don't.<eos> - So stop trying to change my mind.<eos> - I'm not going to.<eos> You said you loved me over and over.<eos> But you don't, do you?<eos> You love her.<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
So I'm done.<eos> I was worried when I first found out you and Wes were involved.<eos> Because of you.<eos> I saw you for who you were.<eos> I recognized you.<eos> You're angry, you lash out, you use people.<eos> But only because you don't know better.<eos> Been alone so long you don't know what it means to love someone.<eos> And here is a boy who so clearly loved you.<eos> He still does.
You want to make this right?<eos> Be a man and go and get your girlfriend to talk.<eos> She doesn't trust me anymore.<eos> Then make her, damn it!<eos> Are you a man or not? !<eos> Sure he shouldn't take the trophy?<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at what you did to me.<eos> You said you loved me.<eos> I still do.
- Oh, babe.<eos> - What?<eos> Have you seen my Billy Ocean t-shirt?<eos> What?<eos> ! That's it!<eos> Feel free to remarry, and find the kids a good dad.<eos> Are we a bad couple for going at it like that?<eos> - I mean, we went ballistic.<eos> - Face it, babe. We're both strong-ass cups of tea who do not like to back down.<eos> - No, we do not. - Mnh-mnh.
Figure it out.<eos> Like now!<eos> Figure it out!<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's a big deal, you guys.<eos> - What?<eos> - You don't know what he wants, either.<eos> You have no idea what your husband likes.<eos> Like you do.<eos> I absolutely do.
- Yo! Yo!<eos> Yo, party people!<eos> I go by the name of Jermaine Dupri, and it's time that we give a big shout-out to my man, Dre Johnson!<eos> - What's up?<eos> - What up, J.D.?<eos> Hey, give me a second, Zo-Zo, okay?<eos> Happy Birthday, Dre.<eos> Thanks, J.D.<eos> You know I danced for Whodini, right?<eos> Uh... Yes, I did.
- Look, I didn't tell you because...<eos> - Because you're loyal to Ghost.<eos> No, because I didn't want to be the one to break your heart.<eos> You were thinking of my feelings, huh?<eos> Well, you might be the only one.<eos> I can't take anyone else lying to me.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have to tell you one other thing.<eos> If this is about Keisha, I know.<eos> You do?
You're asking me to commit fraud.<eos> Can you please watch your voice, sir?<eos> You're asking me to risk losing my license, lose my hospital.<eos> That's criminal.<eos> You're just a thug.<eos> Dr. Calhoun, if the IPO goes through and I die,<eos> Anika will become a billionaire in her own right.<eos> But it will not happen if I can't get... a key man policy.<eos> Does Anika know about this?<eos> No, she does not.
Of course I did. She's my manager.<eos> Dad, I tried to talk her out of it, but you know how...<eos> Let me tell you something, TaKeem.<eos> I have worked very hard on my relationships in order to get this done for you.<eos> And I am not gonna be having Cookie messing this up for me.<eos> She's not.<eos> She's stoked about it. Okay.<eos> Well, what exactly did Cookie promise you when you signed with her?<eos> To do the same thing she's doing for Jamal-- protect the music and make me a star.<eos> The same thing she did for you back in the day, right?
You can start by recording for Empire on this phone.<eos> Hakeem.<eos> Look, you were right about the song, okay?<eos> I said it so you won't have to.<eos> Now, could I go take a leak?<eos> Hey. I gave you that advice because I care.<eos> Look, I can't force a relationship between us, but...<eos> I think you do know I love you, don't you?<eos> Let me think.<eos> I don't.
- Yo.<eos> - Babe...<eos> spaghetti a la me.<eos> You sure you don't want to stay for dinner?<eos> - Thanks, but Eddie is painting all day and I swore that I would help.<eos> Although, I'm really just going to do that thing where I get a little paint on my hair and on my nose.<eos> - [laughs] Oh, hey, someone from Central City Picture News called you the other day... I left the number on the fridge. - What?<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> - Chill!<eos> Just did.
- Hartley, what do you want?<eos> What do you want, Hartley?<eos> I already gave my mea culpa today.<eos> - The city already hated you.<eos> You don't think I noticed that press conference was a pathetic bishop sacrifice?<eos> No, no, no.<eos> I've played with you too many times to let you get away with that.<eos> This is between you, me, and The Flash.<eos> - You don't want to play for those kind of stakes with me, Hartley.<eos> - Actually, I really do.
The crack pipe is bad enough, but this guy?<eos> - If you beat cancer and learn you have AIDS...<eos> - Oh, my God. How did you find me?<eos> Did you follow us?<eos> - You texted me. - What?<eos> I woke to your text this morning asking us to get you.<eos> Even said you'd leave the door open.<eos> See?<eos> No, I never sent that.<eos> Well, someone did.
The world that's coming, this machine world with machine men.<eos> So you do want this to end?<eos> Everything ends.<eos> No.<eos> You've just given up!<eos> Wait!<eos> Connie, wait!<eos> Why? Why? !<eos> Why don't you believe in us?<eos> I do.
So you do want this to end?<eos> Everything ends.<eos> No.<eos> You've just given up!<eos> Wait!<eos> Connie, wait!<eos> Why? Why? !<eos> Why don't you believe in us?<eos> I do.<eos> Do you?
Good-bye, John.<eos> Good luck.<eos> This is where Anne Marie found him.<eos> Even if we get in, I'm still not sure what we'll be able to do for him.<eos> John's more prepared than even I realized.<eos> You're gonna have to sneak a couple things in.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Assyrian exorcism rite.<eos> How did he know he'd need that exact spell?<eos> He didn't.
All right, cook it up.<eos> Are you sure you can do this?<eos> If there's anything I've learned in the last 48 hours, it's that this demon needs me alive.<eos> And if you're wrong?<eos> Well, then, I'll go out riding the world's greatest high.<eos> With my first love at my side.<eos> There are worse ways to meet your maker, eh?<eos> All right, let's get him out of here.<eos> No time like the present.<eos> Do it.
Oh, God.<eos> Aw, shit.<eos> When... when did you find out?<eos> Nine years ago.<eos> "Nine years ago."<eos> I'm okay. I'm strong. Strong motherfucker.<eos> That's right.<eos> You know what matrix tortuosity is?<eos> I-I do not, no.<eos> No one does.
And at the risk of sounding mercenary, I imagine my pay will be cut as well.<eos> Would you rather go back to the commissary?<eos> I'm offering you one last chance at resurrection.<eos> I suppose that depends on how you look at it.<eos> It seems to me that while murdering savages can be purchased on any corner, those that can command other murdering savages are a rarer commodity.<eos> What do you want?<eos> Whilst we await this special mission, may I base my Rangers wherever I choose?<eos> You'll have a ship at your disposal, so as long as I can reach out to you quickly, that shouldn't be a problem.<eos> Then consider me at your disposal.<eos> I already do.
After Matt's dad.<eos> Henry.<eos> That's a good, strong name.<eos> I hate to talk to you about doing the right thing.<eos> Doing it is the easy part.<eos> Knowing what it is is tough.<eos> And let me guess.<eos> You know what the right thing to do is.<eos> No.<eos> No, I don't, Matthew.
It's a new dawn.<eos> Yeah, like that.<eos> She's not wrong, you know?<eos> City's changing.<eos> You really want falcone's job?<eos> Since we were kids, I love you like a brother.<eos> I love you, too.<eos> Always.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do, I do.
I have no idea.<eos> A rhetorical question.<eos> You're in there because I put you in there.<eos> But, don maroni, wh-why?<eos> What did I do?<eos> Do you know what hubris is?<eos> Do you know?<eos> ! Sorry.<eos> I-I thought that was another... Rhetorical... Question.<eos> Yes, I do.
No.<eos> A little bird told me you and she have been friends for a while.<eos> No.<eos> Told me that she told you stuff about my mother so that I'd get all caught up in you.<eos> Because Fish knows.<eos> You know, about my mother.<eos> You know how much I loved my mother, because we talked about her all the time, you and me.<eos> Remember, Fish?<eos> Back in the day?<eos> I do.
We can assume she's either dead or extremely unwell.<eos> Mmm.<eos> You know, this creates some intriguing opportunities.<eos> Falcone will struggle to hold on to her territories.<eos> If we move quickly...<eos> My thinking exactly.<eos> In fact,<eos> I took the liberty of claiming her nightclub.<eos> In your name, of course.<eos> You did, huh?
Only, it was a gunfight.<eos> How'd Frankie get killed with a knife?<eos> That always kind of bugged me.<eos> Honestly,<eos> I'm not much use when things get physical.<eos> I'm sorry I couldn't save him.<eos> I was just reminiscing.<eos> Don't beat yourself up about it.<eos> We all got our talents, right?<eos> Yes, we do.
Butler, mate.<eos> I'm the butler.<eos> What the hell is that?<eos> - I made it. - You made it?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - So what is it?<eos> Well, it's a hood.<eos> Thought it would, uh, you know, spice things up.<eos> When did we start wearing hoods?<eos> - We didn't. - W...
You said I wasn't the only one with a Cobblepot.<eos> Maybe this is his.<eos> I started making jewelry.<eos> What's it made of?<eos> Bones.<eos> Starlings.<eos> They, uh... they land on my windowsill, and... you can catch them if you're really silent and still.<eos> And I can be really silent and still.<eos> Silent as a mouse.<eos> Then what do you do?
Can I get you anything?<eos> Yes, actually.<eos> I've decided to attend the Wayne Enterprises Charity Ball tonight.<eos> All the senior management will be there, and I think people should see that a Wayne is still at the head of the company.<eos> I shall set your tux out for you.<eos> Alfred.<eos> Yes, Master Bruce?<eos> When you were in the army... you had to kill people, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I did.
It's the worst possible place for her to be!<eos> He'll put her on the index, tag her like a shark.<eos> She'll come to me when she sees how they treat those particular individuals.<eos> It'll never happen.<eos> She'll never love you, you stupid man.<eos> I should reconnect with some of them, wreak a little havoc, ruin that man and his dumb suit, remind Daisy where she really belongs.<eos> She may not love me now, but she needs me.<eos> What about me?<eos> You... you have to help me.<eos> I did.
And, sir...<eos> I want to apologize for my outburst in there.<eos> It was uncalled for.<eos> I have a little trouble dealing with my anger sometimes.<eos> - Join the club.<eos> - Yeah, something I'm working on, but this alien stuff messed with my head, and, uh... and losing Trip brought back a lot of hard memories.<eos> For all of us.<eos> I hope I-I didn't blow my chance to work on Lola one day.<eos> After that little R.C. version you built for me, I'm genuinely considering it, although I couldn't figure out how to make it fly.<eos> It doesn't.
Even though she knew it meant giving up her freedom.<eos> All to save the rest of you.<eos> Don't you see?<eos> She wants to get better.<eos> If you take her away from the people she loves, she'll only get worse.<eos> I know you think I overreacted.<eos> But this decision... leaving Skye with you...<eos> it carries real danger.<eos> I want you to understand that.<eos> I do.
- Well...<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll meet you down there.<eos> I'm so glad you're here, especially since it's been well documented that powers can lead to psychological volatility.<eos> Not that Skye's showing any signs.<eos> Her vitals currently are steady.<eos> - May I?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> I did not know that you were married.<eos> Now you do.
My father's involved.<eos> And for better or worse, I matter to him,<eos> - And we can use that.<eos> - I'm with May.<eos> This is an emotional powder keg - you shouldn't be anywhere near.<eos> - Right.<eos> - We can't risk you losing control.<eos> - I won't.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - Yes, I do.
This is temporary, Skye.<eos> I'll be back in a couple days.<eos> - If you need anything...<eos> - I'll let you know.<eos> We'll figure this out.<eos> I promise.<eos> Captain Andersen.<eos> I believe your daughter goes to school with my boy.<eos> - I don't have a daughter, sir.<eos> - No, you do not.
But I did pick you out some nice gluten-free biscuits.<eos> Ah.<eos> Yeah, I'll... I'll... I...<eos> Have you tried on the gloves yet?<eos> I have not, but I... I will.<eos> Well, when you're feeling up to it, it might be worth giving them a go.<eos> They're obviously just a prototype, but they're laced with a microthread I designed, which should accelerate your healing and dampen the vibrations.<eos> I just want you to be safe, Skye.<eos> You know that, right?<eos> I do.
She's a S.H.I.E.L.D. agent, not a thing.<eos> What happened wasn't her fault.<eos> I was there.<eos> Calderon fired at her.<eos> She was armed and hostile.<eos> She was scared and defending herself.<eos> I don't care if she was chasing butterflies.<eos> We can't wear kid gloves around something with powers of that magnitude.<eos> - She could have killed everyone.<eos> - But she didn't.
I represent the Strategic<eos> Homeland Intervention Enforcement Logistics Division,<eos> And you are about to enter a quarantine site.<eos> Colonel, you can't send your men in there!<eos> A biological weapon was set off!<eos> Nasty stuff... Flesh-eating.<eos> Weapons sale gone bad with the Russians.<eos> Give my team time to assess.<eos> Did you say, "Biological Weapon"?<eos> Yes, I did.
Uh these are for you.<eos> I want to thank you... Both of you...<eos> For giving me another shot.<eos> I know that my actions...<eos> I learned who my mother was today, And she... Taught me things.<eos> I've never had that before.<eos> That was possible because of you.<eos> That's all I really wanted for you.<eos> Cal, uh, Skye doesn't know when her birthday is.<eos> I do.
I'm surprised you didn't join us.<eos> I thought it might be in my best interest to find an exit that wouldn't, oh, land me in a cell afterwards.<eos> Or, you know, my brain erased.<eos> Well, I'm glad you made it out all right.<eos> Yeah, we both know that's not true, Coulson.<eos> You want to tell me what this call's really about?<eos> I always knew the team wasn't gonna forgive me.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> But Kara?<eos> She does.
What if there's a mistake?<eos> Let me be absolutely clear about this.<eos> There is no mistake.<eos> All of us have one of these.<eos> And all of them are different, unique.<eos> This is me.<eos> This is my unique code.<eos> And this... ..is the code of the killer.<eos> You don't need to be here, you know.<eos> Yes, I do.
Previouslyon "Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."...<eos> - Why should I trust you?<eos> - Because we all have our secrets.<eos> You have one sitting in the cargo hold of your ship.<eos> Some people just don't deserve forgiveness.<eos> - Kara?<eos> - She does.
She is a SHIELD agent.<eos> - Is that still true?<eos> - Of course it is.<eos> Now's a good time to find out where Skye really stands.<eos> - So they do have it.<eos> - Deep in their ship, under lock and key.<eos> - For now.<eos> - Sounds like somebody knows something we don't.<eos> - Jiaying, this doesn't concern him.<eos> - Yes. Yes, it does.
- 10 minutes out.<eos> - Copy that, Agent May.<eos> Hey, May, autopilot has us descending.<eos> You sure about those coordinates?<eos> Funny how you're so broken up about betraying Hunter.<eos> 'Cause it seems like you couldn't care less - about what you did to me.<eos> - Kara.<eos> You just sat there, pretending to comfort me.<eos> But you were just trying to see if I remembered.<eos> Well, I do.
Kara needs closure.<eos> Admit that you betrayed her, and we can end this.<eos> You're such a hypocrite.<eos> You say I betrayed her?<eos> You betrayed your entire team.<eos> How many people who trusted you have died?<eos> See, I've seen the real Grant Ward, the one buried deep inside.<eos> He's a coward who always has an excuse or someone else to blame.<eos> - You don't know me.<eos> - Sure, I do.
I don't know.<eos> Are those my only two options?<eos> - In the paternity pool, yeah.<eos> - Unbelievable.<eos> Hi, Helen.<eos> I'm Dr. Dey.<eos> Whoopee for you.<eos> Can you tell me why you're so upset right now?<eos> I made a mistake coming here.<eos> No, you didn't.
Lay back.<eos> Code blue. 7 north. 2-3.<eos> Role reversal.<eos> This is ridiculous.<eos> Just treat me as you'd like to be treated.<eos> You're free to go.<eos> It's too bad this wrist issue that brought me here will continue to cause me chronic anxiety.<eos> Fine.<eos> Tell me what your problem is.<eos> I just did.
You told me that you were gonna give me an answer.<eos> Okay, fine. You're suspended.<eos> How's that?<eos> I can't have a doctor in my O.R. with a manslaughter charge hanging over him.<eos> - I'm suspended?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I don't care where you go, just not here.<eos> Now leave my office and shut the door on your way out.<eos> You lost a patient today, didn't you?<eos> Yes, I did.
Something killed Raymond.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Something did.<eos> That's why we're not going back in that house.<eos> I'm not leaving Portland until I find out what did this.<eos> We're Ghost Seekers.<eos> It's what we're supposed to do!<eos> I never thought any of this was really real.<eos> Well, now we have proof that it is, and you want to run away.<eos> Yes. I do.
When I heard the cops come in, I ran out the back.<eos> I tried to warn cherry. I'm worried about her.<eos> I went to the police station.<eos> They said she wasn't there.<eos> Come on, now.<eos> Cherry always finds her way home.<eos> I'm asking around, seeing if I can get you a deal, but guns aren't cheap.<eos> Well, I might be falling into some money soon. How soon?<eos> You know, I'm more of the bartering type, anyway.<eos> (Chuckles) I do.
-What?<eos> -The panther member roll.<eos> I want to see everybody who was supposed to be at that meeting last night, and the attendance sheet, so I can see who was not.<eos> You think it was a panther?<eos> -Your brother did. -Why?<eos> Well, he knew there was an informant, high up, right next to you.<eos> I think he was waiting at your house to tell you.<eos> You want to put names with those black faces, you're gonna have to work harder than that.<eos> I'm asking you to trust me.<eos> I don't.
Here.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Is this all of it?<eos> Yep.<eos> Let me know when you move Antoine.<eos> All right.<eos> Oh, by the way, there's a patient asking for you, bed seven.<eos> Hey.<eos> I don't know if you remember me.<eos> No, of course I do.
- Oh, yeah. When kids would make fun of me about being adopted, she used to come out in her muumuu and chuck stale bagels at 'em.<eos> Made me feel so safe.<eos> Kids are such dicks.<eos> Right?<eos> And so sticky.<eos> You know, it makes me happy to think that someone was there, taking care of you.<eos> You deserve it.<eos> - Really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> You do.
Mom, are you okay?<eos> I talked to him.<eos> Ted.<eos> I stopped by the church after the blood drive.<eos> He deserved an answer.<eos> What did you say?<eos> I said yes.<eos> I said I wanted to marry him.<eos> And then I told him about what happened when he was away.<eos> You did?
All this college talk with your mom,<eos> I thought maybe you'd enjoy coloring outside the lines for once.<eos> For once?<eos> I was arrested, Jonny.<eos> For murder.<eos> And they dropped the charges, but I cannot mess up again, okay?<eos> I can't be arrested again.<eos> I didn't know.<eos> Okay.<eos> Well, now you do.
Anaphylaxis!<eos> Anaphylaxis!<eos> If that didn't work, I was ready to quit school.<eos> But it worked, so who cares?<eos> How'd you get possessed?<eos> It was an act.<eos> An act?<eos> So, what is Judas?<eos> Don't know.<eos> You don't?
Gimme time to recover my senses.<eos> Like a minute.<eos> Fine. A minute.<eos> Thanks.<eos> You dropped all your papers.<eos> These are tests.<eos> What're these for?<eos> I'm cleaning up your mess.<eos> You know Kotaro Yuda?<eos> I do.
This isn't a joke.<eos> I walk into this diner, and everybody starts clapping.<eos> And I look around at first, confused, and then I realize, oh, they're clapping for me, in my dress uniform, 'cause I... served and came back alive, like you.<eos> You and me ain't nothing alike.<eos> So, I pretended to curtsy...<eos> Played it off as a joke, and then I'm working on my meal.<eos> I look up.<eos> I see another G.I. walk in.<eos> So, I put down my fork, put down my knife, get ready to clap...<eos> And nobody else does a thing.
Someone's having a fish fry.<eos> It means there is wind blowing in from the Baltic.<eos> It means a snow storm in July, and if you can smell the wind, it means you have 30 minutes to find shelter and build a fire before you die of hypothermia in the morning.<eos> I know all of this because I've been there.<eos> Now I know, too.<eos> Look, put yourself in my shoes, Carter.<eos> I send you on this mission, you get yourself killed, I'm the moron who got a woman killed in action.<eos> I send you and one of my guys buys it, I'm the one who set him up to die.<eos> I know you've spent time in Russia, but we're putting together a European tac team that knows the terrain.<eos> Not like I do.
They were carrying a white flag.<eos> The soldiers that came into my camp in Okinawa...<eos> The ones I killed.<eos> They were coming to surrender.<eos> I just didn't realize it until it was too late.<eos> I buried the flag before anyone else saw it.<eos> Everybody thinks that I'm this guy that I never was.<eos> And every day... it gets harder and harder to live with.<eos> I've been trying to tell that story since I came home from war.<eos> You just did.
'Cause she got all soft in there?<eos> How do we know it's not just an act?<eos> - We've all seen her chops.<eos> - She came clean even though she was halfway out the door with Stark's confession.<eos> If that confession was real, but she's saying it isn't.<eos> By her own account,<eos> Carter would be back in cuffs when Stark didn't show.<eos> She gave up Captain America's blood.<eos> I know that's big for her.<eos> So do you, Jack.
Because after this, we have something very important to take care of.<eos> Corcoran here.<eos> Stairwell's clear.<eos> Great.<eos> Keep the exits covered.<eos> Call it in if you see anything suspicious.<eos> Hey, goes for you, too.<eos> Play it safe.<eos> You believe Carter?<eos> I do.
Howard.<eos> Peg, is this real?<eos> Bring him home.<eos> Howard!<eos> How long until he reaches New York?<eos> 12 minutes.<eos> Maybe less.<eos> Maybe we could talk him down.<eos> You think he'd listen?<eos> Chief did.
Business may continue?<eos> In the best possible way... uninterrupted.<eos> So, uh, what are you going to do with it when it arrives?<eos> What, you think I'm a doddering pencil pusher who moves enormous amounts of money with no clue as to what it's connected to?<eos> The numbers are like tea leaves.<eos> Nobody reads them like I can.<eos> You're laying out major reserves to clear the docks... to make sure the police don't come within 10 blocks.<eos> More to bribe the comptrollers to guarantee straight greens.<eos> Know how much all that costs?<eos> I do.
But he ain't around no more.<eos> One year after he got voted in, packed up, got himself a real house.<eos> Really?<eos> Just like we're gonna buy.<eos> This city?<eos> It's everything.<eos> It's right there.<eos> All you gotta do is put your mind to it and make it happen.<eos> You want a sip?<eos> - He most certainly does not.
I don't know... a girl, maybe?<eos> See?<eos> This is what I'm talking about.<eos> Me and you...<eos> Maverick and Goose, no secrets.<eos> Goose died... and he was married.<eos> Details.<eos> Hey, do you know a good place to get a cup of coffee on campus?<eos> - No.<eos> - Well, lucky for you, I do.
Man cannot be both savior and oppressor... light and shadow.<eos> One has to be sacrificed for the other.<eos> Choose... and choose wisely.<eos> Or others shall choose for you.<eos> Hello, gorgeous.<eos> Hello, handsome.<eos> Mmm...<eos> You're wearing that aftershave.<eos> - You remember?<eos> - Of course, I do.
Oh, shit, not Marshall.<eos> "We must dissent from the indifference.<eos> We must dissent from the apathy.<eos> - We must dissent from..." - "From the fear." Yeah, I know.<eos> You've read it a million times.<eos> You think what happened in there today was right?<eos> No, Matt, I don't think it was right.<eos> But according to the law, if he did disclose trade secrets<eos> - to a third party other than his doctor...<eos> - He didn't.
This city needs me in that mask, Foggy.<eos> Maybe you're right.<eos> Maybe it does.<eos> But I don't.<eos> I only ever needed my friend.<eos> I wouldn't have kept this from you, Matt.<eos> Not from you.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know who needs me, Karen?<eos> My wife... she needs me.<eos> - You could've just told me... but no, instead you gotta spin some story about this great place upstate... could be good for Doris.<eos> Like you give a damn.<eos> Hey, that's not fair.<eos> Welcome to my life.<eos> Wait, you're right.<eos> You're right.<eos> I should've told you.<eos> Then why didn't you?
- You could do that?<eos> - Maybe.<eos> Did you make a suit for Fisk?<eos> Did you make a suit lined with this?<eos> Made a whole bunch.<eos> It keeps him safe.<eos> Can you make something for me out of this?<eos> You want a suit, like... like Mr. Fisk?<eos> No. No, I want something very special.<eos> And if you do this for me...
It's...<eos> If you say "it's complicated," I will punch you in the face.<eos> It's personal!<eos> It's personal, okay?<eos> Okay... okay, it's personal, I get it.<eos> Really don't.<eos> Trust me.<eos> They started tearing down Elena's tenement building today.<eos> Did you know that?<eos> No, I didn't.
- Yeah, Grandma.<eos> - Just try to see if we can switch it to another night.<eos> - It's fine.<eos> - I can call the guy<eos> - if you want... I can do that. - That's okay.<eos> I actually know him, I can call him.<eos> He worked with me on the campaign and catering and stuff.<eos> Yeah. If you don't mind. Maybe.<eos> Okay, if you know him, you do it.<eos> I do.
- Okay.<eos> - Take a breath.<eos> - All right.<eos> - Okay?<eos> It's off.<eos> You need to relax a little bit.<eos> Thank you.<eos> You're...<eos> For what?<eos> I didn't do anything.
Seven years.<eos> It's wonderful that it's happened.<eos> It's a miracle.<eos> Theresa's a lot younger than me.<eos> That's one of the reasons he chose me.<eos> - Do you have your scan photo?<eos> - Just the 12-week one, the 20-week one's not 'till next week.<eos> - Do you know the gender?<eos> - No.<eos> - We do.
Emily's not really my fiancée. That was just a cover.<eos> This woman's been chasing me, and I didn't want to hurt her feelings, so I lied about my situation.<eos> Oh. Then who is Emily?<eos> She lives in the apartment above Felix and me.<eos> Wait. You and Felix live together?<eos> Yeah, we hooked up right after his divorce.<eos> Oh, now I get it.<eos> You and Felix.<eos> Wow! I did not see that coming.<eos> Yeah. Neither did I.
I wake you up?<eos> It's fine.<eos> I'm a light sleeper anyway.<eos> If it wasn't you, it would've been a siren or a dump truck.<eos> I get woken up in the middle of the night all the time.<eos> Some crisis somewhere in the world.<eos> Some... situation... in the Situation Room.<eos> Well, that's better than a dump truck.<eos> You reached out to Tim Corbet.<eos> I did.
I lied.<eos> Why?<eos> You ashamed?<eos> First time I did it, I was scared out of my mind.<eos> I knock on the door, it opens... guy's in a satin robe.<eos> He's fat.<eos> Stringy hair, combed over his bald spot.<eos> Beads of sweat rolling down his cheeks.<eos> I almost ran back to the elevator.<eos> But you didn't.
But isn't it true that you want your children to have a leg up on everyone else?<eos> Is that balancing the scales?<eos> Or is that hypocrisy?<eos> Or maybe it's that you didn't want to raise them yourself so you sent them to boarding school.<eos> Wow.<eos> You must really want to be president.<eos> I would never in a million years bring up your children in a debate.<eos> The way you choose to raise them is your business.<eos> Do I want the best for my kids?<eos> Yes, I do.
That's the best part.<eos> I have no idea.<eos> I'll save you the trouble of trying to convince me.<eos> Claire Underwood.<eos> We need to hit her hard.<eos> You want dirt.<eos> I don't have any.<eos> You must.<eos> If I did, I don't know if I'd shovel it your way.<eos> But I don't.
Do you have any idea who you're going to nominate?<eos> We'll go through our master list in the morning, but this'll take me off the campaign trail.<eos> I won't be in Iowa for a day or two.<eos> You're okay to cover me?<eos> Yes, of course.<eos> I'll keep waving my pom-poms.<eos> Well, you're a saint to do it without me, but it's probably best.<eos> They like you even better.<eos> Did you speak with Tom?<eos> I did.
Yeah, he's toughening up.<eos> He's becoming a top.<eos> That's what you got to do to make it to the top.<eos> Do you think, um...<eos> You need to start preparing yourself.<eos> Fame changes people.<eos> What should I do?<eos> Try not to be all up in his business, you know?<eos> Make sure you got your own thing going on.<eos> Well, I do.
For real, this time?<eos> What do you mean security left their stations?<eos> Who pulled them?<eos> - I'm trying to find out...<eos> - That would be us.<eos> Favor from a friend, so we could talk uninterrupted.<eos> Is that her?<eos> That's her.<eos> Do you remember me?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I've seen this guy.<eos> From the crime scene.<eos> "Did he suffer?" That's what he asked.<eos> And his name?<eos> Sean Posey.<eos> As in, "Pocketful of posies, we all fall down."<eos> I got that shot off his Facebook page.<eos> Tell me his birthday matches the date of the murder.<eos> No such luck.<eos> But his sister's does.
What did you do with that photo?<eos> Nothing yet.<eos> Why did you take them, Casey?<eos> Nathan practically begged me to!<eos> And it was just that one.<eos> Now, now, Casey.<eos> Pants on fire, I counted five, at least.<eos> Nathan, if this is you... I'll tell everyone what you told me your mum did on holiday in Weston-super-Mare!<eos> I could've put that in the tweet, but I didn't!<eos> What did Nathan's mother do on holiday in Weston-super-Mare?
Yeah, sure.<eos> Let's sit.<eos> I just wanted to apologize.<eos> I was really rude last night.<eos> I overreacted and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry, too.<eos> Things just escalated.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - You know, but I have to say, it doesn't seem like you like me very much.<eos> - She doesn't.
Yes, more wine.<eos> That will help.<eos> Let me grab another bottle.<eos> So, listen, I did want to talk to you about something.<eos> Do you remember when we first met, Xiomara?<eos> Yeah.<eos> In biology class.<eos> You kept making those dumb jokes.<eos> You laughed at those dumb jokes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
No one gets on this floor unnoticed.<eos> - The windows are too big in here.<eos> - Mother!<eos> Draw the blinds, Magda.<eos> All right.<eos> Call me if you need anything.<eos> Don't be rude, mother.<eos> He's the only person who's helping us.<eos> And I still don't trust him.<eos> Well, I do.
It's just a ceremony.<eos> You can't do it after?<eos> No.<eos> Dr. Hillcroft is going out of town and he's booked solid, so they're squeezing me in.<eos> Just take a couple of deep breaths and relax, okay?<eos> Are you nervous?<eos> A little.<eos> You know I hate needles.<eos> I just need to have faith.<eos> And I do.
_<eos> _<eos> Mom...<eos> That's not your fault.<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> I get that, ma.<eos> But do you think that that's what he'd want?<eos> Because I don't.
She was not confused.<eos> We both know what you did.<eos> And we're gonna prove it and put you in jail.<eos> I looked your grandmother up on the Internet.<eos> No sign of her.<eos> That and the fact that she really does not speak English, it just got me thinking.<eos> Is your grandmother here legally?<eos> _<eos> See, I don't mind either way.<eos> But those immigration authorities sure do.
A moment of honesty.<eos> I have an IQ of 152, remember?<eos> It's just you two were so eager to please, I figured why not just have some fun and let... and let Juicy get some press?<eos> Okay. An honest conversation.<eos> Dad and I had a plan for this hotel.<eos> We were gonna give Ian Schrager a run for his money.<eos> What, by floating more loans?<eos> We can ride this out if we stay the course, but you have to trust me.<eos> I need this hotel to succeed.<eos> We all do.
Most gyms have free Wi-Fi.<eos> Restaurants, too.<eos> I bet you he was eating out every night.<eos> You know, club owners score mad dates.<eos> How often is he at Carla's Cafe?<eos> Almost every day.<eos> Well, according to the network logs in Evan's laptop, he connected to the coffee shop's Wi-Fi the morning after the murder.<eos> You still think it's a possibility that he framed himself?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I do.
Tell me, did Ignacio mourn his first wife with dignity?<eos> Of course.<eos> He's a respectful man.<eos> We hear no gossip about Ignacio.<eos> With all the female workers around him!<eos> I want to be sure Maria loves Ignacio.<eos> If not, she won't take care of him and his children.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> Of course she loves him.<eos> Don't you?
Jeremy, the door was open, so I just let...<eos> Jeremy.<eos> Jer... Oh!<eos> No, no.<eos> Careful.<eos> The slightest breeze, and the flowers are gone... and then the stench.<eos> I killed your friend because he was asking questions about us... for you.<eos> Stop asking questions.<eos> I don't... I don't want to do this... this to you.<eos> I-I don't.
The true architects of the plague, they're watching me.<eos> I'm running out of time.<eos> Is among you.<eos> Please, Cole.<eos> I said your name?<eos> You gave me this mission.<eos> You're the reason I'm here.<eos> Now, it's been two years, Cassie.<eos> Please tell me you know who Leland Frost is.<eos> I don't.
What else is there?<eos> You saw me there, didn't you?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I stayed away.<eos> I had to follow Henri without you there.<eos> Left just after the quarantine ended.<eos> That was you... outside the tents that night... the lights.<eos> I was wrong about the plague.<eos> People could have died because of me.<eos> But they didn't.
I did not say that.<eos> Wait, did I?<eos> Okay, Iris,this isn't funny.<eos> I mean, I like this girl.<eos> I know, and I am happy for you.<eos> Really?<eos> Because I don't...<eos> I mean, right now it sort of feels like you don't want to be with me and you don't want anyone else to be with me either.<eos> I have wanted nothing more than for you to meet someone who is amazing.<eos> And I did!
Hey, can I ask you something?<eos> Mm hmm. How did you know that the blood in the house belonged to me?<eos> You would have had to have tested it specifically.<eos> Cisco tested it against everyone who worked at S.T.A.R. Labs.<eos> You wanted to know if it belonged to Wells?<eos> Joe.<eos> Dr. Wells had nothing to do with my mom's murder.<eos> You believe that now?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, yeah--I do.
I'm not getting her involved in this.<eos> Allen, make sure he doesn't go anywhere.<eos> I need to be out there.<eos> Joe, you're always the first one to tell me when I'm not thinking clearly.<eos> I took down Clyde. I can take down his dirt bag brother too.<eos> You didn't do that alone, remember?<eos> You're right.<eos> How are any of these guys going to protect me?<eos> They don't know. They don't know what Mardon's capable of.<eos> All right, well, lucky for you, your friends at S.T.A.R. Labs do.
I didn't know there was anyone else like me.<eos> I'm gonna break out of here!<eos> I'm gonna create a tidal wave that destroys your entire city!<eos> So, I still don't understand. How did you find him?<eos> I just had a hunch.<eos> That's gotta be some kind of record.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Well, there goes my excuse for bailing on my brother's birthday.<eos> Do you have any idea what you've just done?<eos> Yeah, I do.
- You used to live there.<eos> I did.<eos> You ever go back?<eos> No.<eos> Too many memories of Tess.<eos> That's right. Sorry.<eos> You, Detective, are one of the few people I know that truly understands that kind of loss.<eos> Iris's mother, you never talk about her, do you?<eos> No.<eos> I don't.
What's up?<eos> Oh. O-okay.<eos> W-what did she say?<eos> Or, wait, you still have it, so, duh, you haven't asked her yet.<eos> Or you did ask her, and she said...<eos> - I was gonna propose tonight.<eos> - All right.<eos> But I went to Joe to ask for his blessing.<eos> - He said no.<eos> - He did?
Son of a bitch showed up at my shop this morning.<eos> Just walks right in, tells me the product is gone.<eos> - Gone?<eos> - He said his brother took it.<eos> But he thinks he can get it back.<eos> I'd say it's time to cut your losses.<eos> That's a big fucking bundle to give up on.<eos> Tell me what to do.<eos> Eric told me you left.<eos> I did.
I told her to go.<eos> Wanted to see what you'd do.<eos> Now I know.<eos> I just wanna make peace with you.<eos> That's it.<eos> Yeah, now.<eos> You just want me to absolve you.<eos> You were right about everything.<eos> I let the family scapegoat you.<eos> I did.
I was upset.<eos> I didn't believe what was happening and I asked to see my husband.<eos> Police brutality?<eos> Extracting a confession through violence?<eos> It had been a very intense day.<eos> It was an error of judgement but I had her removed as fast as I could.<eos> How am I supposed to deal with this in court?<eos> Hm?<eos> Do you realise how the defence will use this?<eos> ~ Yeah, I do.
He said, "We must stop meeting like this."<eos> Do you think he killed those girls?<eos> I can't bear to think about it.<eos> Do you think he was capable of it?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Do you think your husband was?<eos> Claire, if you did agree to meet Lee...<eos> I put myself on the line before and it went wrong and I ended up a prisoner down here, Ellie.<eos> ~ I understand what you're going through.<eos> ~ No, you don't.
Injuries, plural.<eos> He sustained a broken rib and bruising to the neck, chest and torso. Correct?<eos> Yes.<eos> How did he get these injuries?<eos> DI Hardy, how did the defendant sustain injuries while in custody at Broadchurch police station?<eos> After DS Miller learned of her husband, the defendant's, confession, she asked to see him.<eos> Against allowed procedure.<eos> Yes.<eos> ~ Who allowed this visit?<eos> ~ I did.
I wouldn't.<eos> Have you seen him?<eos> ~ I quite like the look of him.<eos> I like a troubled man.<eos> Not as troubled as you do, but -<eos> None of it is true.<eos> Make sure everybody understands that.<eos> ~ Oh, who cares!<eos> Everyone knows what a trial's like.<eos> ~ No, they don't.
Clear your name, everyone moves on.<eos> ~ Our readers would love to hear what you have to say.<eos> ~ You need to leave - now.<eos> I keep replaying my evidence over and over, thinking of all the things I should've said differently,<eos> ~ all the comebacks I should've thrown at her.<eos> ~ You did the best you could.<eos> There's an epitaph - "Ellie Miller, she did the best she could" (!<eos> ) ~ What if Joe gets off?<eos> ~ He won't.<eos> ~ What if he does?
~ Couple of officers, that's all I need.<eos> Some surveillance - ~ You're not even on active duty!<eos> Unless we have a genuinely significant new lead, there's just no appetite to -<eos> ~ At least talk to your superiors.<eos> ~ What is wrong with you?<eos> How can you imagine I'd want to go back to it after what it did to us?<eos> ~ Oh, God, you're his wife.<eos> ~ He didn't tell you?<eos> Huh!<eos> Of course he didn't.
~ Miss Wright, where were you in the early hours of the morning... ~ You all right, Jocelyn?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> ~ .. 2013?<eos> ~ I was walking my dog Vince on the beach at Broadchurch.<eos> I've a caravan nearby.<eos> And did you see anything significant on the beach that morning?<eos> I saw a boat come in... .. and a man carrying the body of a young boy.<eos> Then he laid it on the beach.<eos> 'Did you recognise the man carrying the body? '<eos> 'Yeah, I did.'
Previously on Broadchurch...<eos> Did you recognise the man carrying the body?<eos> ~ Yeah, I did.
I wouldn't have gone anywhere near her if I'd seen that!<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry!<eos> Do you know what, maybe if you spent a little less time trying to tell me how to do my job and a bit more time on your own work we'd stand a chance of getting him off.<eos> Chin up.<eos> Did you enjoy yourself, lying in there?<eos> It's not my husband in the dock.<eos> ~ I suppose you knew all along.<eos> ~ No!<eos> Of course you did.
~ You can't do that.<eos> Claire Ripley showed me a photograph.<eos> She was wearing Pippa's pendant.<eos> You go about your life thinking you're complete, then you meet someone and realise you're only half of something.<eos> People laugh about it.<eos> 'Have you met my other half? '<eos> Then when you meet that person... .. you know it's true.<eos> You're only really whole when you're with each other.<eos> Never ends well, does it?<eos> ~ What doesn't?
I just wanna go home.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I-I've gotta go.<eos> ~ I bought gin.<eos> ~ Go away.<eos> I can take a loss, but this one mattered.<eos> Now the whole town knows I failed.<eos> It hurts.<eos> Yes.<eos> Well, life does.
This was taken a week before, as you were installing your own floor.<eos> Those boards are not the same boards that are on that floor now.<eos> 'Those are dark-oak floorboards.<eos> What's down there now is light oak.'<eos> Same light-oak boards you bought Saturday morning, and again Monday.<eos> What did you use those boards for, Lee, between Saturday and Monday?<eos> What happened on the floor, Lee?<eos> Nothing.<eos> No.<eos> Something did.
♪ Says something like, "you and me, babe, how about it?" ♪ Adam?<eos> We need to talk.<eos> O-okay, I'll come down.<eos> No, wait. I-I'll come up.<eos> ♪ Juliet says, "hey, it's Romeo" ♪ That night, I was determined to climb my way into manhood.<eos> Or at least make it to Dana's window without having to be rescued by firemen.<eos> You know, you really need to stop climbing things.<eos> Look, all I wanted was to be seen as your boyfriend, not some little kid.<eos> No one thinks that.<eos> Of course they do.
Why?<eos> Why not?<eos> Since when is being nice a bad thing?<eos> Since we're in middle school.<eos> It's basically the worst thing you can say about a dude.<eos> Not to me.<eos> Everyone is always trying to be funny or cool or someone they're not.<eos> The last thing I want is to be with some clown.<eos> I just want to be with you.<eos> Or at least, I did.
[scoffs] Don't sound so disgusted.<eos> We're exactly the same.<eos> We're covering other people's mistakes.<eos> If you weren't cuckolding me, I'd probably take you for a drink, and we'd be friends.<eos> Anyway... have a nice life.<eos> So it's done.<eos> I saved the man you love.<eos> You're welcome.<eos> You know, at one point, I loved you.<eos> No, you didn't.
She did.<eos> But she had a connection here in Las Vegas.<eos> The important thing is this same guy was getting a lot of money from Winthrop's company.<eos> Who is it?<eos> He's not gonna talk to you.<eos> But he will speak to me.<eos> Are you asking me what I think you're asking me?<eos> You get me a 48-hour pass, you and I can nail this guy.<eos> Sheriff already doesn't trust you.<eos> You do.
You know, I agree with Winthrop.<eos> I'm tired of all the lies.<eos> Based on that conversation, I did a little digging around the Winthrop family tree.<eos> And it turns out that Collin Winthrop had a daughter.<eos> May.<eos> May went missing around age 15.<eos> Police at the time determined that she was not kidnapped.<eos> She just ran away.<eos> And, Brother Larson, I think you know where she ran to.<eos> Hmm. I do not.
You know what this is all about?<eos> Paul Winthrop has been killing his mother over and over, getting ready for his End of Days.<eos> And with Jared gone, that time has come.<eos> Paul will find May.<eos> He will render judgment.<eos> Unless you protect her.<eos> As, apparently, I no longer can.<eos> Okay.<eos> If I'm gonna protect May, I need to know where she is.<eos> You already do.
Let him do it.<eos> It's too late to stop him from making the virus.<eos> That damage is done.<eos> I think that's enough.<eos> Okay.<eos> But he's not innocent.<eos> He thought he was saving his husband.<eos> But he still made a choice.<eos> And I get it.<eos> You do?
Ellis:<eos> Yeah. Monica:<eos> I love it, I do.<eos> Marty, we were just talking about you.<eos> All good things, really.<eos> (Gasps) Oh, my God, it's Shamu.<eos> You got to be fucking kidding me.<eos> Jesus Christ.<eos> Should have saw this one coming, huh?<eos> And yet you didn't, you dumbshit.
Uh... Mr. Sullivan, we like to be thorough.<eos> We like to present our clients with all of their options, but... yes, I'm afraid we've been wasting your time.<eos> Because contrary to everything you've been hearing today,<eos> Shags Burger Shack is ready to compete on the national level.<eos> You know this, we all know this, but with expansion comes more scrutiny.<eos> More people to answer to.<eos> And do you know what those people will be telling you?<eos> Keep... your controversial mouth shut.<eos> Do you want to keep your mouth shut?<eos> No, I do not.
A defense attorney starts hammering him about some inconsistency,<eos> Grandpa is gonna start hammering back and down goes the gavel.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> He's the only witness we've got.<eos> There were ten other witnesses there.<eos> And half of them did not see DeCarlo with a gun.<eos> The other half are either dead or unreachable.<eos> Which is why I am thinking of a plea deal.<eos> You don't want to plead out a cop killer.<eos> No, I don't.
How do you know that?<eos> Uh, we're cops.<eos> We find out stuff.<eos> Yeah, you know, I always wondered about those meetings.<eos> What do they do?<eos> Like, get you into a fancy hotel suite, give your dad a few drinks, loosen him up, and then they hit you with the pitch?<eos> My dad doesn't drink.<eos> Well, he was arrested for driving while intoxicated about an hour after your meeting.<eos> I mean, I didn't see him have any drinks that day.<eos> Yeah, you did.
A pair of diamond earrings that my dad gave her, a few old coins from her father.<eos> There was a little drawer with about $500 in cash in it.<eos> Did Tino tell you who took the jewelry box or where it is?<eos> No.<eos> Had you met Tino before?<eos> Four or five times, ma'am.<eos> - Ever visit him in his apartment?<eos> - No.<eos> - But you do know where he lives.<eos> - No, I don't.
- Julio.<eos> Julio.<eos> - Of course.<eos> We're doing this for your own good.<eos> Julio.<eos> Why didn't you tell me what was going on?<eos> There's an open I.A. investigation.<eos> If they knew we told you Tino was murdered before they questioned you...<eos> Did you see the guy?<eos> I did.
Stop right there!<eos> Don't move.<eos> Turn around, put your hands on the wall.<eos> Turn around!<eos> Suspect had assumed the position, hands against the wall.<eos> Officer Brasher was behind him.<eos> What happened next.<eos> I was making my way around a vehicle to get over to them when I heard the shot.<eos> Did you see Officer Brasher draw her weapon?<eos> I did not.
-I can just stand outside.<eos> -He's just really paranoid.<eos> -It's not going to work.<eos> -I'm quiet.<eos> It's fucking eight grand!<eos> I'm trying to help you.<eos> Screw this.<eos> No, wait.<eos> You know who Christer Korsback is, right?<eos> -No, I don't.
-You're gonna cut me?<eos> Come on then, do it.<eos> I don't even live there anymore, so piss off, you fucking prick.<eos> Hey!<eos> Is there room for one more?<eos> I have money, wait...<eos> Somewhere.<eos> I have eight or nine here.<eos> How much did you say the rent was?<eos> -I didn't. 1500.
-We help each other. No bullshit.<eos> -You're always so big on solidarity.<eos> It's Christer Korsback's dope that you're after.<eos> Did you talk about Christer Korsback?<eos> No, I did not.<eos> -Why are you lying?<eos> -I'm not, not at all.<eos> -I heard you and Benneth talk<eos> -Just now, yeah.<eos> But I didn't before.
- Fact is, I already have an interested party.<eos> All right, look, as big a boner as all this real-estate talk is giving me, that's not actually why we're...<eos> That's him.<eos> That's who?<eos> The interested party.<eos> You just let me do all the talking, and we'll close the deal right here, right now.<eos> Raylan Givens, home seller, meet Ty Walker, home buyer.<eos> Ah, came to your senses, did you?<eos> Decided to take my offer.<eos> No, I didn't.
Mmm. I should have choked his cowboy ass out, left him for dead on the side of the road, but, uh, I figured someone drives by and sees, I'd have to kill them.<eos> You know, and somebody else drives by and sees, and I'd have to kill them.<eos> You know, and another car drives by and sees and I have to kill them.<eos> You know, and...<eos> I mean, 'cause...<eos> He's cool.<eos> I already told him all this shit anyway.<eos> Oh, yeah, yeah, we had a great talk on the drive over.<eos> He says you guys are with Tigerhawk Security?<eos> He did, huh?
It might make me hurt you.<eos> And you don't like it when I hurt you, do you?<eos> - No.<eos> - Good.<eos> 'Cause I gots a new plan to get that Emulex.<eos> And the good news in this plan, you ain't got to lie to nobody.<eos> Earl, you back already?<eos> Earl?<eos> Maybe we should leave the guns here.<eos> To do what, man?
That being said, I still don't recall being bounced on your knee.<eos> Nevertheless, it, uh, seems that I owe you an apology.<eos> Like I said, I can't blame you for not remembering.<eos> No, sir. The apology that I owe is for my craven attempt to pilfer that which rightfully belongs to you.<eos> As defense, I offer only my ignorance.<eos> Meaning you thought you were stealing from Calhoun?<eos> Yes, sir.<eos> I did.<eos> And now you know the prize in question belongs to me.<eos> - That, I do. - Mm-hmm.
Those men coming after us like that.<eos> Ava, that ain't never gonna happen again.<eos> I know.<eos> I don't doubt you, Boyd.<eos> Good.<eos> Don't.<eos> But I do have to wonder, now that it's quiet... how much money are we talking about here?<eos> And how are you planning on going after it, given their actions?<eos> - I thought you said you trusted me.<eos> - I do.
28 points.<eos> Boom!<eos> I'm pretty sure "aplex" isn't a word, Mikey.<eos> Of course it is.<eos> "I don't like that guy.<eos> He aplexes me. "<eos> Yeah?<eos> He's going.<eos> You want me to follow him or not?<eos> Yes, I do.
The hunt for Tyler O'Neill ended in tragedy and another Lakewood teen lost her life.<eos> And the press will be hyping the curse of Brandon James and looking for someone to blame, but I've met these kids.<eos> Their loss is impossible to describe.<eos> So I'm not gonna try.<eos> My heartfelt condolences go to the friends and family of Riley Marra.<eos> I'm so sorry for your loss.<eos> Could you turn that off?<eos> I can't believe she's gone.<eos> I can't believe I abandoned her.<eos> Brooke, we both did.
I said, turn that off!<eos> Audrey, what did you do?<eos> Why'd you make me watch?<eos> I can't un-see that now. I can't.<eos> It can't be how it looks.<eos> You mean how it looks like premeditated murder?<eos> I mean it. I need, like, a Men in Black brain wipe.<eos> She was so angry.<eos> Noah, we both know Audrey.<eos> Yeah, we do.
I am a witness.<eos> If he did these things to hurt us...<eos> Then he's gonna have a reaction when he sees me.<eos> I need to look in his eyes.<eos> I need to know.<eos> Hello, Emma.<eos> Hi, Mr. Branson.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> You know what I'm doing here.<eos> No, I don't.
She's fine.<eos> I know they're saying a lot of terrible things... But I did not kill Will.<eos> I don't even know where that knife...<eos> I'm sorry, but my lawyer...<eos> I...<eos> I can't talk about it.<eos> Mr. Branson...<eos> Whatever your name is...<eos> Okay, my friends are dead, my family has been targeted, and you know why.<eos> Actually, I don't, Emma.
Must've gotten hung up.<eos> Well, that seems to run in the family.<eos> Kieran is also very late.<eos> Mrs. D, looking lovely, as always.<eos> Jake.<eos> One non-alcoholic drink, por favor.<eos> Okay.<eos> What did you do?<eos> - You talked to Brooke.<eos> - Yes, I did.
If you can't hear me and trust me...<eos> Then Branson won.<eos> Even sitting in his jail cell, he beat you.<eos> Hey, are you okay?<eos> Where's Kieran?<eos> He left.<eos> I messed things up royally.<eos> Or maybe he left because he did it.<eos> Audrey, I know that you want justice for Rachel...<eos> Yeah, I do.
I don't know!<eos> Just listen to me, okay?<eos> Brooke, this whole thing...<eos> This whole thing is a mistake, okay?<eos> The night that you came to the theater, I was so, so damn happy to see you.<eos> I miss you.<eos> I miss what we've had.<eos> But whatever they say about me, you have to know that I would never hurt you.<eos> I don't even know who you are.<eos> Yes, you do.
Is there any way that we can get past this?<eos> I think so.<eos> I'm gonna ride with my mom.<eos> Okay. I'll meet you there.<eos> You got your classic showdown at the lake, tying together the past and present.<eos> And Survivor Girl in the back of an ambulance, just like somebody predicted.<eos> Exactly!<eos> Except today, we're all sitting in the back of the ambulance together.<eos> Well, not literally, 'cause then we wouldn't all fit, but you know what I mean.<eos> I do.
At a minimum, she may know what our rival is making in the factory and how it's manipulating the people of Maple.<eos> If it re-creates this in other cities, countless people will suffer.<eos> Right now, I only care about one person, Harold.<eos> I'm gonna take first swing at this.<eos> All right?<eos> You get ten minutes.<eos> I'm warning you, the police will come looking for me.<eos> I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> I'd introduce myself, but you already know us.<eos> What did you do with Sameen?
August Corbin was my friend, and the Horseman murdered him in front of me.<eos> He is death personified.<eos> Please, both of you.<eos> There is no need for tempers to flare.<eos> Are you kidding me?<eos> When we waver in our duty, monsters get loose and people die.<eos> We are not jailers, we are not reformers.<eos> We are soldiers, and I think that we all understand what the stakes are here.<eos> I can't believe you let her talk you into this.<eos> I did not.
You mean like a virus?<eos> Like a nuclear virus.<eos> Samaritan quarantined the code to protect itself.<eos> I should be allowed to view the material.<eos> You wouldn't understand it anyway, so what's the point?<eos> Who the hell do you think you are, Travers?<eos> Mr. Travers is my eyes and ears inside your operation.<eos> We gave you a marvelous car.<eos> Surely, you didn't think I'd let you drive it yourselves.<eos> Of course I did.
I've been here for 2 years!<eos> High-Security Area<eos> Tell Boukson to give me the cigarette!<eos> Madam, they have no right!<eos> They had a fight over some cigarettes.<eos> I'm going to die!<eos> Pull down your panties!<eos> Is that a man?<eos> He's here because he cut his lovers' testicles.<eos> He did it to himself.
- Forget it.<eos> - Fawaka.<eos> - So?<eos> - We have a date next week.<eos> - Sure.<eos> I'm taking it slow, matter of time.<eos> You know. Foreplay.<eos> What do you know about foreplay?<eos> You've never kissed a girl.<eos> - Sure I did.
- I apologize.<eos> - Not to mention the fact that Leslie's been waiting on me hand and foot and feeling sorry for me, and that shit gets old.<eos> And I know she's sick of me, and I know she'd rather be doing yoga with her hippie friends, so I had to practically shove her out the door 'cause I'm hungry and I'm sick of eating all of her healthy twigs and cat food shit.<eos> Well, you tell her I said hey, huh?<eos> Grady Hale and Markham, his partner, made their mint slinging weed.<eos> Grady Hale being Katherine Hale's husband? Yeah.<eos> And when Grady Hale went to jail,<eos> Markham went nobody-knew-where.<eos> - You saying Markham flipped?<eos> - Somebody did.
- Why what?<eos> Any of it.<eos> What's it all mean?<eos> Well, you're gonna nail Boyd Crowder and move to Florida ... what do you care?<eos> It's interesting.<eos> Spins this thing a whole another way, hmm?<eos> Sheds new light on an ever-spreading circle of greed - and evil and murder and mayhem. - Oh, okay.<eos> When you stray from the trail, Raylan, that's when you get lost.<eos> I know that, Art.<eos> I do.
Both refused.<eos> You were a cheerleader in high school.<eos> I was.<eos> I always wanted to be a cheerleader.<eos> Football games, I'd sit high up in those stands and watch those girls bouncing in their skirts, see how all the players ... well, everyone, really, was just mesmerized by them.<eos> It was a lot of work.<eos> We practiced five days a week.<eos> What power those girls had.<eos> Yet so few knew how to use it.<eos> But you did, huh?
We were victims of the Soviet hate Fool<eos> (Ambassador to Germany Hiroshi Oshima)<eos> Stop the capture of Poland plans to enter the next Finland<eos> Soviet-German treaty signed between the two countries Sood<eos> The real goal is to erode Eastern Europe<eos> You discover a secret about it<eos> Well it seems not stupid<eos> I am now in order to form an alliance with Germany and Italy<eos> Good offices in various countries<eos> Japan and Germany alliance or ready to do
Wasn't personal.<eos> I just prefer freelance.<eos> No ties.<eos> So you said, with an impressive string of expletives.<eos> Okay, is being drunk an excuse?<eos> You know, it's really about professionalism.<eos> You are erratic and you are volatile.<eos> Effective.<eos> You've brought me eight jobs no one could deliver on.<eos> I did.
Yeah?<eos> So what have you detected?<eos> Well, I can tell by the residue on this bar that four years ago, a man named Horace had buffalo wings.<eos> His name was Melvin.<eos> I stand in dark alleys and wait to take pictures of people boning.<eos> Except you been watching me like a hawk since you walked in.<eos> Force of habit.<eos> Or it's your way of flirting.<eos> I don't flirt.<eos> But you do.
If he gets a hold of me again...<eos> Trish...<eos> If you leave that girl with him, and...<eos> What would you have me do?<eos> What exactly should I do?<eos> We'll figure out a way to protect you.<eos> We?<eos> He's coming for me, not you.<eos> I know!<eos> You don't.
He says that you attacked him.<eos> Maybe I should call my lawyer first.<eos> Ma'am, I know who you are.<eos> And you should know that if I have to come back here with an arrest warrant, then the chances are this whole business ends up on the news.<eos> Which I'm sure that you're used to, but it wouldn't be my first choice.<eos> Suit yourself.<eos> Hold on.<eos> I'm sorry, Officer...<eos> You don't want to do this.<eos> - Yes, I do.
God, I hope this is only a three-person family.<eos> Hey!<eos> You're alive, get off me.<eos> What happened?<eos> Why did I...<eos> You jumped off the roof.<eos> I caught you, okay?<eos> You did what he said.<eos> It's over.<eos> I did?
Sufentanil.<eos> It knocks people out.<eos> This is what made you think that you killed Trish.<eos> You know, I've spent my whole life protecting people.<eos> You're still you.<eos> You just need time to...<eos> I did things in the line of duty, horrible things, but I have never wanted to kill an innocent woman.<eos> Do you want to kill her now?<eos> - No. God, no.<eos> - No, because you never did.
I didn't forget proposing, no.<eos> Well, that's worse for you than for me because it means she's fine giving you leftover romance.<eos> - Let's just go somewhere else.<eos> - No!<eos> If she orders you the tiramisu and there is a diamond ring at the bottom, you'll think nothing could ever make you stop feeling happy.<eos> Don't choke on it.<eos> You think, if you break us up, that I will crawl back to you?<eos> Read my face. Never gonna happen.<eos> She does not get this goddamn restaurant.<eos> Yeah, she does.
Oh!<eos> Damn it.<eos> I have to be on air in an hour.<eos> You know what?<eos> Screw it, I'll cancel.<eos> No, things have to appear normal to Kilgrave.<eos> I can help.<eos> - Thanks, but I don't need you.<eos> - Uh, yeah, you do.<eos> No, she doesn't.
Go!<eos> Drive!<eos> Trish!<eos> You're being controlled, assholes!<eos> Hey!<eos> She won't go down!<eos> - Come on!<eos> - It's not working.<eos> Hit her again!<eos> - Do it again!
-More important than a paying customer?<eos> Life and death, actually.<eos> Figured you were blowing me off.<eos> I wouldn't just bail on you.<eos> You've done it before.<eos> I don't even know what the hell I'm looking for.<eos> Anything that points to where Antoine might've gone.<eos> Airline receipts, train schedules.<eos> Won't find any of that if someone grabbed him.<eos> No one did.
He was a great kid.<eos> Oh, yes, of course he was, but the timing was awful.<eos> I mean, just the very next day, I mean, there you were leaving for vacation...<eos> Please stop.<eos> I knew something terrible was gonna happen.<eos> Not a day goes by that I don't regret not warning you.<eos> You've no idea what a burden I've had to live through all these years.<eos> Did you really have a sense that that terrible accident was gonna happen?<eos> Tell the truth now.<eos> No, I... didn't.
Udon noodle salad?<eos> Oh, wow!<eos> You just blew past that question.<eos> What's going on, Trish?<eos> Trish, what are you up to?<eos> I'd rather not say.<eos> - Well, if it involves Kilgrave...<eos> - Well, not yet.<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> It does?
Do not presume to know!<eos> Before I met you, I got... everything I wanted.<eos> And I didn't... realize... how unsatisfactory that was until you left me to die.<eos> You are the first thing, excuse me, person... I ever wanted that walked away from me.<eos> You made me feel something I had never felt before.<eos> Yearning.<eos> I actually missed you.<eos> Well, I'm here now.<eos> You've got me.<eos> No, I don't.
I thought maybe you were having it out with Wendy.<eos> - I was worried.<eos> - I should have called.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> You brought him there.<eos> To make Wendy sign the divorce papers.<eos> That's not how it happened.<eos> Then tell me he made you do it.<eos> Just tell me that.<eos> He did.
They want a plan, or at least some news.<eos> Well, they're gonna have to keep waiting.<eos> Come on, I...<eos> I gotta tell them something.<eos> We're meeting tonight.<eos> Tell them to forget it ever happened.<eos> You asked them to lie, to let you handle it.<eos> They did.<eos> I think they deserve an update.<eos> They do.
- To kill you.<eos> Well, take a bloody number.<eos> Did Jessica tell you to do this?<eos> No.<eos> I followed her here, thought she might lead me to you.<eos> Oh, great. Just great.<eos> Get in the sodding car.<eos> Go on.<eos> I didn't kill your silly wife.<eos> Jessica did.
You have to go?<eos> With a large unconscious man in your bed?<eos> He won't be the last... person hurt by Killgrave.<eos> The so-called "Evil prick"?<eos> Stupid phone is dead.<eos> All right, well... if your leg gets infected, you're not going anywhere.<eos> Take off your pants.<eos> I usually like a little more romancing.<eos> Don't we all?<eos> So, did Killgrave do that to you?
You help people.<eos> That's who you are.<eos> And you make the rest of us look like selfish pricks.<eos> Is that a compliment or--<eos> There are other nurses at the hospital who can help.<eos> There's only one that can help Luke.<eos> I just don't want him to wake up alone, not knowing what's happening.<eos> I don't even know what's happening.<eos> It's asking a lot, and you don't know me, but...<eos> Sure I do.
As in...<eos> Nope, I'm not special.<eos> I just keep running into special.<eos> Ah, you and me both.<eos> Is it a good thing?<eos> Can't change what we know.<eos> Yeah, I miss ignorance, too.<eos> Wasn't that long ago I was... trying to get my degree in social work.<eos> Wanted to help people?<eos> I still do.
Hi.<eos> Mazel tov.<eos> What?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Thank you.<eos> First, let me put you at ease about the baby's herniated diaphragm.<eos> I've paged the staff OB to come and answer any questions you might have.<eos> Yes, please.<eos> I have questions.<eos> Of course you do.
No.<eos> I don't want you to be the first one to touch my baby.<eos> Alright.<eos> Doctor Lin, you're up.<eos> Hello, Barrett.<eos> - Just the woman I wanted to see.<eos> - Oh, I'm flattered.<eos> Will you go to the ceremony tonight and accept the award and read my speech?<eos> Isn't that something you should ask Joel?<eos> - Oh, I did. - Oh.
You don't understand, Maggie.<eos> You're out of your depth.<eos> Our kiss... threw me for a loop.<eos> But I see now that it may have caused you pain, and I'm sorry.<eos> I'm sorry for harassing you about Herschel and...<eos> I'm orthodox.<eos> I live with a whole host of expectations.<eos> This isn't about just our kiss.<eos> - No, I understand that.<eos> - No, you don't.
Two people can still be in love even if they're not getting along.<eos> - Mm-hmm. - And, you... Detective Russell Agnew, believe she's innocent because of...<eos> Hey, he cares about her.<eos> There's nothing wrong with that.<eos> Uh, no.<eos> I don't care about her.<eos> I just know that I'm right.<eos> It's okay to care.<eos> I know.<eos> I just don't.
If she can afford the 50G's, it's a fairly easy conclusion to make.<eos> Which... apparently, you haven't made.<eos> You know, you're usually Mr. Benefit of the Doubt.<eos> But not for this traumatized wife? Hmm.<eos> You're getting back at me, aren't you?<eos> You're pissed about the suspension.<eos> No.<eos> Why would I be angry?<eos> You apologized.<eos> No, I didn't.
If Milhouse can play, anyone can play.<eos> Once again, I'm the lower bound.<eos> You're it!<eos> Is that a grown man going between the children's legs?<eos> Well, there's nothing in the rule book against it.<eos> It's on page one of the rule book!<eos> That's where I doodle.<eos> It's a comic strip I do called Bumble and Grumble.<eos> Grumble likes to yell, but deep down he loves Bumble like a son.<eos> No, he doesn't.
I'm not sure yet.<eos> But Jacoby's autopsy is scheduled for the morning.<eos> If it reveals what I think it might, we'll know exactly what's going on here.<eos> I don't know how it happened, but Chris Jacoby incurred heavy brain damage recently.<eos> There's serious deterioration of the cerebellum and the cerebral cortex and basal ganglia.<eos> He had a baseline scan done recently.<eos> You can see he was fine a few months ago.<eos> The autopsy performed on Marissa Ledbetter did not detect similar results, did it?<eos> And the toxicology test you did on Jacoby, did you find any strange or unusual substances?<eos> We did.
Marisol talks about you all the time.<eos> You've been together a while.<eos> Since freshman year.<eos> Kyle and I met in high school.<eos> It was love at first sight.<eos> Let me guess.<eos> You were a cheerleader, and he was the star quarterback.<eos> Ha!<eos> How do you guys know Marisol?<eos> Oh, we don't.
I need to show you something.<eos> This was his room.<eos> Oh, Vera, I'm... I'm sorry.<eos> It's a model of the solar system.<eos> He got an A-plus.<eos> I don't get it.<eos> Why would they just leave like this?<eos> I don't know, Alan.<eos> Wait.<eos> Yes, I do.
Vera.<eos> So glad you could join us.<eos> Rose told me about your gifts.<eos> Yours is particularly interesting.<eos> Spirit-walking?<eos> The way you died in the trunk of the car?<eos> And then again, right here?<eos> Our guard spotted your body on patrol outside.<eos> He didn't recognize you.<eos> But I did.
They need a square meal and clean clothes and a loving hand!<eos> Not spending money hand over fist on television sets and tinsel.<eos> Children incline to happiness.<eos> Even I knew delight and transportation as a child.<eos> - And my youth was not a happy one!<eos> - Not happy?<eos> !<eos> - You never knew what hardship meant!<eos> - Sister, please!<eos> - I did!
It's really happening.<eos> I'd say in weeks...<eos> Months maybe, but it's happening.<eos> I can go home?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You can go anywhere.<eos> You can go to Tulsa or New York or anywhere.<eos> What's in Tulsa?<eos> You told mother?<eos> Amantha did.
I don't drink and ride.<eos> Daniel, just answer the questions.<eos> You told Trey that you had no hard feelings toward him.<eos> That true?<eos> I did say that.<eos> Then why did you attack him?<eos> Attack him?<eos> Sheriff.<eos> Did you have an altercation with Mr. Willis in Mr. Melton's trailer?<eos> I did.
Yours and Trey's fingerprints were found all inside that trailer, but only yours were found on George's wallet and cellphone.<eos> That seemed curious to me.<eos> That is curious.<eos> You'd think George's would be on there, too.<eos> Care to speculate why they weren't?<eos> Trey wiped them off before I touched them.<eos> Why would Trey do that?<eos> A miscalculation, perhaps.<eos> Trey said he left you there.<eos> He did...
What's this, Gregory? Some kind of beard?<eos> I think I've seen more hair on a side of bacon.<eos> Gregory says we can race his dogs up and down the hall.<eos> - Father.<eos> -Welcome home, Gregory.<eos> That was a calculation.<eos> It wasn't just where I dropped them.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Do you remember that one Christmas when we had the giant in the pageant?<eos> Here in the parish, I do.
No, what I want is a husband who upsets them.<eos> And who won't die.<eos> Don't ask, don't get.<eos> They'd kill you.<eos> You're right, they would.<eos> If she sent for you, she means to flatter you.<eos> She's going to ask you to do some little thing for her and then she'll make you hers.<eos> Take my advice, before she does, turn around and walk the other way.<eos> Cheer it up, can't you?<eos> - What did you just do?
Your father made it sure.<eos> He came back from exile, claimed his ancient rite but it's not enough to claim a country.<eos> If your brother comes back and seems to say that you've taken his kingdom, taken his place, it's because he wants you to become the king he would have been.<eos> He can't fulfill the prophecy, a prince come out of Wales. But he wills you to do it.<eos> Why does he come back now?<eos> I have been king for 20 years.<eos> Because now is the vital time.<eos> Now is the time for you to become the king you should be. The sole and supreme head of your kingdom.<eos> Ask Anne, she'll say the same.<eos> She does.
Now is the time for you to become the king you should be. The sole and supreme head of your kingdom.<eos> Ask Anne, she'll say the same.<eos> She does.<eos> She says we should not bow to Rome.<eos> And if your father should come to you in a dream, you take it the same way as you take this one.<eos> They come to strengthen your hand.<eos> I see.<eos> I understand it all, now.<eos> I knew who to send for.<eos> I always do.
More has arrested a barrister, James Bainham.<eos> - What do you expect me to do about it?<eos> - Talk to the King.<eos> You know how to please him, I suppose?<eos> My maidenhead for your lawyer?<eos> He'll be released.<eos> Well... ..Little Bilney wasn't.<eos> They burnt him in Norwich.<eos> Your barrister friend will recant and he'll be released.<eos> And if he doesn't?
I don't want Plant, I want her!<eos> Well, you cannot have her because we don't know where she is.<eos> ~ Excuse me?<eos> ~ Well, I'll come back when you find out.<eos> ~ Yes?<eos> ~ We'd like to talk to somebody about Dr Cullen, please.<eos> Give me strength!<eos> ~ Her surgery's cancelled.<eos> We don't know where she is.<eos> ~ We do.
Dr Cullen, I'm going to have to trouble you to come in and let us take your fingerprints.<eos> Aye, he really wanted to burn this letter, didn't he?<eos> What did she see in a bloke like him?<eos> Sometimes people fall for the wrong person, don't they?<eos> Right, well, we've got a suicide note.<eos> Are we done?<eos> Why?<eos> Why did she end her life?<eos> I don't know how many more reasons you need, guv.<eos> I honestly don't.
Three nights ago.<eos> She rang me, she sounded very depressed.<eos> So I drove over there to try and calm her down.<eos> Did she seem suicidal?<eos> Well, was suicide mentioned?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Oh. I see.<eos> So, then you just forgot about that visit altogether?<eos> Do you know of a factory in Easterhope called Dennigs?<eos> Yes, I do.
Well, it was to say she'd never worked in Dennigs and I kept me house clean and cleaned me windows and always washed Norman's overalls, and all that malarkey.<eos> Course, I never knew then what Valerie told us later.<eos> You can only get Esther's cancer off asbestos.<eos> No other way.<eos> Esther died when she was 15.<eos> She couldn't possibly have worked for Dennigs.<eos> No, no, no. She, er...<eos> she played there.<eos> She played in the factory?<eos> A lot of bairns did.
Well, here we are.<eos> Joseph, Mary and the little Baby Jesus.<eos> What have we got then?<eos> Blue Vauxhall Victor.<eos> I've got a witness that saw it driving through Rowan Street.<eos> Two flat tyres.<eos> Rowan Street's about a mile away from the bank.<eos> That's very good.<eos> Did uniforms get that?<eos> ~ No, they didn't.
She left her stuff here?<eos> ~ Yeah.<eos> ~ May I?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I kind of got the feeling she wasn't really anywhere yet.<eos> Lost, you know.<eos> She find the skinheads or did they find her?<eos> She was hoping to go to college.<eos> She wasn't finding much work.<eos> She did some shifts at some nightclubs.
Right.<eos> Do whatever it is you need to do and then we'll call it in.<eos> Are you sure about this, John?<eos> Yes. Of course.<eos> Just do it quickly, please.<eos> Done.<eos> The kid's name's nowhere near the charge sheet.<eos> Thank you.<eos> How did you know the gun wouldn't work, sir?<eos> I didn't.
We called it, jinn.<eos> Huh?<eos> It's mean, demon.<eos> Have you actually encountered one?<eos> Yes.<eos> In Jerusalem.<eos> So, how do we kill it?<eos> I do not know.<eos> Well, how did you kill it?<eos> We did not.
Maybe they think you got potential.<eos> On the TV, they say that science is dying.<eos> I don't want it to die.<eos> So what are you gonna do about that?<eos> Well, I want to be the first person to visit their planet.<eos> Then that is what you'll do.<eos> Who knows why they chose 15 years, but things had got a whole lot better.<eos> I got a place at MIT, graduated, and got a job in astrophysics.<eos> Mom got clean and looked younger than ever before.<eos> In fact, everyone did.
font color=#00FF00♪ Beauty and the Beast 3x06 ♪ Chasing Ghosts Original Air Date on July 16, 2015<eos> How's Hank doing?<eos> Uh, he's doing okay.<eos> Well, the bullet went clean through.<eos> So he should make a good recovery.<eos> But I just, I don't know.<eos> I can't believe I let that happen to him.<eos> You can't blame yourself, Vincent.<eos> You didn't even know he was gonna be here.<eos> No, but apparently you did.
What?<eos> What?<eos> You think Mom would be happy for me, Heather?<eos> Despite the fact that she all but tried to destroy Vincent?<eos> - Cat, don't do this...<eos> - No!<eos> I am...<eos> I am sick of hearing about how wonderful Mom is, how special Mom is, how much good Mom did.<eos> You don't know what she did, Heather.<eos> None of you do.
That's why I'm always telling you to live your life, regardless of this crap.<eos> What happened last night, how you felt, what you said... that is life.<eos> And now that it's out, it's a good thing.<eos> Yeah, it doesn't feel so good.<eos> It will, with time.<eos> You have enough secrets, Cat.<eos> Being mad at your mom shouldn't be one of them.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I still don't understand how infecting over, what, a dozen people, with a parasite that doesn't last very long accelerates their experiments.<eos> It doesn't.
Who's that?<eos> (sighs) That's my real name.<eos> Cookie don't even know that.<eos> I knew when I became an orphan at nine that, uh,<eos> Dwight wouldn't survive a week in those streets.<eos> (sighs) So I created Lucious.<eos> Lucious Lyon, the immortal.<eos> The one who could not be killed.<eos> I love you, son.<eos> I always did.
What's going on?<eos> A connect has never needed their money this quick.<eos> Julito, do what you said, okay?<eos> - You work on doubling up with everyone. - _ I'll work on finding the territory.<eos> Okay?<eos> Look... I'm not saying he should have called you that.<eos> You're not...<eos> Latin.<eos> - You don't understand.<eos> - No. No, I don't.
I'm going to bed, mama.<eos> You have no idea what it's like being a single mother.<eos> How hard it is.<eos> And that boy you're playing with ain't gonna help you either.<eos> Maybe he can rotate your tires, But he ain't gonna help you raise these kids.<eos> Even if i have to do it by myself, I'll do a better job than you ever did.<eos> What... you think you so big and bad you don't need nobody, tasha?<eos> You ain't strong or smart enough to do this alone.<eos> You think you gonna spend the night in my house after that?<eos> Yes, i do.
Not planning on staying long?<eos> I agreed to hold off on killing Ghost and take part in your plan, Kanan, 'cause you assured me that you would be able to use Tommy to align yourself with Lobos.<eos> However, both Tommy and Lobos were arrested and we are no closer to meeting him.<eos> Explain to me why I do not rid myself of all of this and go my own way.<eos> Vladimir's got a point, Kanan.<eos> We're all in the same boat.<eos> That last distro I received is running low.<eos> We need something new or we're gonna be forced to look at other options.<eos> So what's your plan?<eos> No need to do anything.
He's been listed as a missing person ever since.<eos> I sense a punch line coming.<eos> Right before he left, Andrew got a call.<eos> We checked the records.<eos> It originated in Layton, New Jersey.<eos> That's the last place we saw Mark.<eos> Andrew got the call right after Mark escaped.<eos> He must have picked him up.<eos> So you got a few things you want to ask Andrew?<eos> Yeah, I do.
And soon I will have it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Withered by age and failure, yet your blind optimism carries you on.<eos> Don't tell me you still cling to your belief in the Supreme Being?<eos> - You should fear his wrath.<eos> - Your "Being" doesn't exist.<eos> Realized that when I was 10 years old.<eos> Prayed for him to heal me.<eos> He never answered.<eos> Yes, he did.
It's a subspace transmission.<eos> The ship is broadcasting a distress signal.<eos> What're you doing?<eos> Nothin'.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Looking for something to treat a headache.<eos> Headaches can be caused by blood vessel abnormalities or brain tumors.<eos> How do you know that?<eos> I don't know.<eos> I... I just do.
Do it.<eos> What the hell?<eos> Calculations complete.<eos> Jumping to FTL.<eos> Hey.<eos> Wh-Wh-What happened?<eos> [SIX] We lost gravity for a few seconds there.<eos> When it came back on, we all took a tumble.<eos> You hit your head on the way down.<eos> --I did?
- You look like shit.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> So do you.<eos> You sleep in that dress?<eos> Game just broke up.<eos> I won 30k.<eos> I was in the zone.<eos> I almost called and cancelled.<eos> Congrats.<eos> Why didn't you?
- Three weeks sounds like a long time.<eos> I could use 10 more like you.<eos> But instead of having 10 more, I'm down one because your story's bullshit, isn't it, Brasher?<eos> - Have you ready our statement?<eos> - I don't have access to the file, sir.<eos> It wouldn't matter if Bosch had backed your story.<eos> You think the forensics came back in your favor?<eos> You think they found GSR on his hands?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> - You do.

How do I do that?<eos> Detective Bosch initiated a sexual relationship with you against department policy. You need to report that<eos> - relationship and file a complaint.<eos> - A complaint?<eos> You felt pressured into the relationship because he was your superior... coerced.<eos> You thought it would hurt your career if you didn't comply.<eos> Well, technically, he wasn't my superior, - and I didn't feel pressured.<eos> - It was an inappropriate relationship according to department policy, was it not?<eos> How does filing a harassment complaint undermine his statement about what happened in the garage?<eos> It doesn't.
- Excuse me?<eos> You don't drive through the night to knock on our door at dawn because you're following up on a call.<eos> You're gonna try to pin something on one of our kids.<eos> Mrs. Blaylock, I can assure you I'm not in the business of pinning anything on anyone.<eos> Well, I still don't believe you.<eos> I know what he wants.<eos> Audrey, please.<eos> Just let the man ask his questions.<eos> I understand you took in a number of foster children when you lived on Wonderland.<eos> Yes, we did.
- Babe.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I just want music, so I can dance with you at our wedding.<eos> Who cares who books the band?<eos> All right, well, I'll go to the show tonight.<eos> It's our wedding.<eos> One of us should be there.<eos> And since you're at your bachelorette party, Frankie and I will go and make sure that the band is right for us.<eos> - Okay, if you really want to.<eos> - Of course we do!
And the way I... I hold my breath every time they test my blood and... Scan my body.<eos> You just hope and you pray that...<eos> And if the results are bad...<eos> You try to accept it, and you get back up, because... because...<eos> Because that's the deal.<eos> There's no last hurrah, is there?<eos> No, every day is the last hurrah.<eos> You have to go.<eos> You know that.<eos> I do.
You didn't.<eos> I just ran an entire 400 while you were getting water.<eos> What?<eos> You did?<eos> No, but you believed it for a second.<eos> It's not so hard to have faith, is it?<eos> Remember earlier you said you thought Leo was just in the ground?<eos> Do you really not believe in an afterlife?<eos> But you do?<eos> I do.
The more I think about it, the more I have this nagging feeling that...<eos> When he said goodbye to me for the last time... It's like he knew it was the last time.<eos> When we look back on big moments from our past we don't always remember them exactly the way they happened.<eos> No.<eos> He was so emotional.<eos> He cried.<eos> Dad never cried.<eos> I mean...<eos> Do you remember why he went to Baltimore?<eos> No, I don't.
You're not dying.<eos> Death used to be my greatest fear, but now...<eos> It's weird. It's such a real possibility, that if I don't, it's like a bonus.<eos> Imagine if you hadn't found out when you did.<eos> Remember, George was the first person to tell you.<eos> - Bren...<eos> - You basically called him a liar.<eos> That's because I think he's lying to us.<eos> Brenna, I know how you feel.<eos> I do.
Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> He loves you and misses you more than life itself.<eos> He thinks about you every moment of every dying day.<eos> He thinks about how you met at Colonel White High School.<eos> He's saying something about your hair.<eos> Does that mean anything to you?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, he always liked it long.<eos> He still does.
You did all this for me?<eos> Why wouldn't I?<eos> We're in this together, aren't we?<eos> How do you mean that?<eos> Simmer down.<eos> I have my own bedroom.<eos> Well, this is all very beautiful, but when do we get serious?<eos> Don't make the mistake of thinking we're not.<eos> We did not come all this way again to go back empty-handed.<eos> No, we did not.
What did they say?<eos> Not much.<eos> They said they'll review my request.<eos> I'm thinking maybe we shouldn't have asked that.<eos> I guess we're gonna find out.<eos> Looks like our vics were living pretty much off the grid:<eos> no bank accounts, no tax returns.<eos> Can't find a vehicle registration or driver's license for either one.<eos> Sounds like people who don't want to be found to me.<eos> Well, except the bounty hunter did.
Well, we've got another body.<eos> Oh, God, Nick.<eos> If this is a Wesen bounty hunter, he's still working.<eos> Look, you two stay out of this.<eos> Let us deal with it.<eos> And I'm sorry; I know this isn't a nice way to come back from a honeymoon.<eos> Nick, seriously, you don't want to piss off the Wesen Council, not any more than you already have.<eos> Can't you find somebody else to handle this one?<eos> Well, you know that's not gonna happen.<eos> I do.
You know, around the room, see?<eos> Yeah.<eos> That's going to be amazing.<eos> Thank you so much.<eos> So, I guess Simon, red wine?<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> - Right.<eos> Robyn?<eos> You don't drink?<eos> - No. I don't.
I mean, the bullying, the kids beating on him, and stuff like...<eos> I don't know what that does to a person.<eos> What happened with Gordo and his dad?<eos> We've really got a process going.<eos> They shouldn't get the impression that I'm...<eos> Hey, Robyn.<eos> ...and let them think that I'm...<eos> Hey, honey.<eos> You know, I'm passionate about the job and...<eos> Yes, I already did that for you.
Say "pleasey-weasy." Yeah, "pleasey-weasy." Say it.<eos> Yeah, you're sweating now. You know what?<eos> You know what you really want is, what you really want is for me to tell you that everything's okay.<eos> Does it remind you of something?<eos> You never did that for me.<eos> Fucking asshole.<eos> Okay?<eos> I didn't do it. There.<eos> I didn't touch her.<eos> Or maybe I did.
I know.<eos> Might explain why we keep getting away from him.<eos> Yeah, but why would whoever's behind this want us back alive?<eos> I don't know, but whatever the reason is, I think he knows it's a trap.<eos> Look, maybe we should just head back, right?<eos> He's still following us. We stick to the plan.<eos> At least we know he's after us and not our friends.<eos> Till death do us part, right?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Till death do us part.
Shh! They might hear you.<eos> What the hell is going on?<eos> I don't know, but I think they might kill them, JT.<eos> We have to do something.<eos> What happened to you?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> I don't know;<eos> I've never been beaten up before.<eos> Wait, how did you know I was here?<eos> I didn't.
It's... it's just that you didn't give a rat's ass about what I was going through or what I needed.<eos> I'm sorry, I...<eos> No, don't.<eos> Look, Tess,<eos> I admit, I-I...<eos> I was preoccupied with finding the guy-- woman, as it turns out-- behind it all.<eos> But it was worth it, right? I...<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> I was trying to keep us safe.<eos> And you did.
Julianna was going to kill you, and there was nothing I could do but watch it happen.<eos> But it didn't happen.<eos> I just kept thinking about you dying-- us dying-- without ever getting a chance to get married.<eos> Well, it's a good thing we didn't elope, then, right?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> My parents, they, uh... they didn't romanticize their wedding the way yours did.<eos> Oh, well, you know, everybody's different, you know?<eos> Doesn't mean they didn't love each other.<eos> No, I know.<eos> And they did.
I thought I'd mend it before things got busy.<eos> - Shall we go down?<eos> - Before we do... .. I wish you'd tell me what's wrong.<eos> Whatever makes you say that?<eos> - You'll say I'm being stupid.<eos> - Well, maybe you are.<eos> Maybe.<eos> You see, when I accepted Mr Carson...<eos> - You didn't mean it?<eos> - Oh, yes, I did.
Maybe he'd prefer us to leave that side of things alone.<eos> Sorry?<eos> Live like brother and sister, you mean?<eos> A very loving brother and sister.<eos> - And that's what you want?<eos> - I don't know what I want.<eos> Except not to feel embarrassed and absurd.<eos> Is this why you've not fixed the date?<eos> I think we should be clear about what we're doing.<eos> - Or not doing.
Well, where is this Mercury maid?<eos> Here, m'lady.<eos> Thank you, Mrs Hughes.<eos> We mustn't delay you.<eos> Can you send Anna up?<eos> Of course, m'lady.<eos> - How dare you?<eos> - I dare more than you dare.<eos> You could have asked her to throw me out.<eos> Why didn't you?
- Enough.<eos> I find I'm most disappointed in Tony Gillingham.<eos> Don't be.<eos> He wanted us to get married.<eos> Our week in sin was just part of his plan to persuade me.<eos> Then why did you say no?<eos> Because, when it came to it, he wasn't right.<eos> At least, not for me.<eos> And you didn't think of George?<eos> Of course I did.
Marco, I'm coming over. Uh...<eos> Yeah, a-all right.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> That was Marco, my old army buddy.<eos> His son is dead.<eos> Henry: There is risk anytime we venture into the unknown, whenever we are compelled, for whatever reason... [camera shutter clicking] To push away the safety of the familiar, of family and home.<eos> As promised, my report.<eos> My assessment remains accidental death by drowning.<eos> And there is the notion that this impulse is, indeed, for the best, that whatever doesn't kill us makes us stronger.<eos> Unless, of course, it does.
Me too.<eos> Marco, I think you should know Jason had intended to return Kevin Crachiolla's investment using his own money.<eos> Because you raised him right, Marco.<eos> Thanks, man.<eos> Over time, however, one learns that the choices of those we love are impossible to control.<eos> You'll write... every day.<eos> Every day?<eos> Come on, mom.<eos> I love you so much, Abraham.<eos> Henry: We both do.
But follow their lead.<eos> You got greedy, Chappy.<eos> You got greedy, and you killed Rick for that gold.<eos> That's not true.<eos> He was gonna split it with us.<eos> You don't have to split anything if you steal it.<eos> You know, I could see a big guy like you handling a harpoon.<eos> Why would I kill him?<eos> Rick was the only one that knew where the gold was.<eos> Now nobody does.
We recovered split bourbon at the scene.<eos> It was laced with a sedative.<eos> What sedative?<eos> Ketamine.<eos> It's an anesthetic, but it can also be used...<eos> Recreationally.<eos> I know what ketamine is.<eos> Did you catch that?<eos> He...<eos> Of course you did.
Trust me... You don't want to be.<eos> Okay.<eos> Let's go.<eos> You with the DEA?<eos> Think I'm dealing?<eos> No, I'm with the medical examiner's office.<eos> I think you killed someone.<eos> Much better.<eos> Did you know Lucy Templeton?<eos> Of course I did.
It was, 30 years ago.<eos> A young woman tripped and fell at a party.<eos> I was home from Princeton on spring break at the time...<eos> Anyhow, she was inebriated, so I offered her a ride to the E.R.<eos> How gallant of you.<eos> - And then? - I never saw her again.<eos> 'Cause she was murdered and buried in a shallow grave.<eos> That's all I remember.<eos> I wish I could give you something more to help with your case.<eos> You just did.
Are you kidding me?<eos> You don't believe in some mystical knife!<eos> No.<eos> No, of course not.<eos> He was gonna kill her, Abe.<eos> I'm sure of it.<eos> Further proof...<eos> Adam is a complete psychopath.<eos> We know this.<eos> If only Jo did.
Are you awake?<eos> Oh, sweetheart.<eos> Everything's gonna be okay.<eos> We'll go to Bristol and we'll start again.<eos> We're gonna make it.<eos> We'll be okay.<eos> "Our father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.<eos> Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven.<eos> Give us this day our daily bread."<eos> I did my best, Sara.
After I lost my daddy, I...<eos> I had a hard time coping'.<eos> These made the pain disappear.<eos> Hmm.<eos> If they could only make my family disappear...<eos> Must be intimidating, having a brother in the political spotlight.<eos> It's not that.<eos> He, uh, inherited my father's Southern charm, so everybody loves Lyman.<eos> But you don't?<eos> No, of course I do.
Your family's been drugging you.<eos> I think the question is, why?<eos> What do they have to gain by you seeming crazy?<eos> As long as I'm incapacitated, Mother controls the inheritance that Daddy left me.<eos> See, she already burned through hers financing Lyman's campaign.<eos> Oh, and to think Lyman chose mental health funding as his platform.<eos> Oh, no, but we don't know he's involved.<eos> - Even the simplest implication would derail his career.<eos> This could've killed you, Louise.<eos> But it didn't.
Where did you get this?<eos> Nolan's house.<eos> Victoria asked me to find it for her.<eos> And in the state I was in, I just wasn't thinkin' clearly.<eos> Yeah, but...<eos> But I've never seen this before.<eos> It was in the kitchen in that folder.<eos> Kate's folio.<eos> Look, I don't even know what it means.<eos> I do.
The girls begged.<eos> You guys never got the Christmas you wanted.<eos> I hope New Year's is okay.<eos> Definitely.<eos> Come on.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Thank you all for coming in.<eos> This should only take a minute.<eos> Have any of you seen her?<eos> Hmm. I did.
I won't go.<eos> And if you try and make me, I will call Cornell myself.<eos> - Natalie!<eos> - No!<eos> Come on.<eos> Where did we go wrong?<eos> I don't know. I don't know.<eos> We loved her. We've taken care of her.<eos> We taught her right from wrong.<eos> Did we?
I don't want to.<eos> All I want is to be left alone.<eos> I would never hurt anyone.<eos> I just want to live my life like any other...<eos> And how do I know you're not a radical?<eos> Part of that Suresh guy's group?<eos> This is crazy!<eos> You kicked my ass yesterday at school.<eos> I could have sent you anywhere.<eos> I didn't.
And I have to know why.<eos> No, I'm pretty sure Renautas was behind the whole slaughter.<eos> That's not what the world believes.<eos> You knew Mohinder Suresh.<eos> Was he capable of mass murder?<eos> -No. -But why is he running?<eos> Why is Renautas framing, disappearing, and killing evolved humans?<eos> That's why I came to find you.<eos> I figured if anybody had answers, it was you.<eos> Do you?
Which means I have an actual first cousin once-removed.<eos> Huh!<eos> Where does this end?<eos> Probably right there.<eos> Tell me all about him.<eos> Like, everything... I want to know every detail.<eos> I knocked up a cocktail waitress when I was 23.<eos> She had the kid but said I couldn't see him because I was an irresponsible douche bag.<eos> Which I was.<eos> And so I didn't.
I know what you're thinking about those kids from last night. But Henry's not like that.<eos> He's a good boy, Maria.<eos> You think he wouldn't do whatever Drill asked to save your life or his mother's?<eos> We're all good, Sean, until we have something to lose.<eos> Have you lost your mind?<eos> Black out an entire city?<eos> Not the whole city, sir.<eos> Just the parts that...<eos> Do you have any idea of the panic it would cause?<eos> Oh, we do, sir.
As she has had for some time past a partiality for Captain Bisset, she has taken the opportunity of availing her self of it.<eos> She is so resolved to abide by it that, in case Sir Richard should force her back again, which as her husband he certainly has the right to do, Lady Worsley wishes you to know, sir, she would do the same again whenever she could.<eos> Punk.<eos> Common whore.<eos> Well, if that is her ladyship's fixed resolution, perhaps she should give her assistance towards obtaining a divorce.<eos> I believe a divorce is what Lady Worsley wishes for.<eos> There will be no divorce.<eos> Was Jane with him?<eos> - Did you see my Mary?<eos> - No, I did not.
Are we to hear any more evidence for the defence?<eos> - What is your name?<eos> - Mary, madam.<eos> My maid's name is Mary.<eos> 'What is your name?<eos> 'Mary Marriott, sir.<eos> - 'And you are a bathing woman?<eos> - Yes, sir. '<eos> Do you know Sir Richard and Lady Worsley?<eos> Yes, I do.
"If a plaintiff encourages or is privy to, or consenting at all, "or contributing to the debauchery of his wife, or joined in it,<eos> "he will not recover a verdict. "<eos> So says the law of this land.<eos> I rest my case.<eos> Order, order!<eos> I will have this court cleared if there is not order!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Silence in court!<eos> Sir, does the plaintiff have your verdict?<eos> Yes, he does, my lord.
But... though our friends are gone, you and I remain.<eos> And we must try to make our way in the present.<eos> Without them.<eos> Perhaps not.<eos> This place is bringing my old friend Abigail back to me.<eos> I get the distinct feeling these memories have purpose.<eos> How is he alive?<eos> We saw him die on the battlefield.<eos> We saw him die.<eos> Nobody here did.
Because they were probably filmed with that camera.<eos> The problem with asking for their footage is they will ask why we need it.<eos> So we tell them.<eos> It's all classified.<eos> So we go for a FISA warrant and ask for the judge to keep our reasoning under seal.<eos> Do you really think Justice will support us on another warrant after the reaming we got yesterday?<eos> It's the only way to prove what happened.<eos> Look, I believe you.<eos> You were right.<eos> But they don't.
You know, I've got thousands of dollars worth of inventory rotting in that freezer.<eos> Over there!<eos> How have you kept your food cold with a broken freezer?<eos> We brought in 200 pounds of dry ice last night.<eos> Peter died of carbon dioxide poisoning.<eos> Dry ice is frozen carbon dioxide.<eos> Oh, look who paid attention in chemistry.<eos> Oh, serious crush on my teacher, Mr. Brewer.<eos> That man knew his way around a Bunsen burner, if you know what I mean.<eos> No, I don't.
I just... I just wanted to be different.<eos> I wanted Pied Piper to be different.<eos> But if this company is built on lies, then we're really not much different than Hooli.<eos> The law says that I lose everything, my whole company, everything that I worked for, because I used one Hooli computer (SIGHS) to test and modify one block.<eos> Is that right? I mean, is that fair?<eos> To me, if the system says that's fair, then I guess I'm probably not meant to be a part of it.<eos> Mr. Hendricks, please answer the question.<eos> Did you at any time use a Hooli computer...<eos> Yes.<eos> Yeah, I did.
Mr. Belson, there is language in this contract that the California Supreme Court has deemed unlawful. Preventing Mr. Dunn from seeking employment elsewhere is a violation of his rights.<eos> Are you aware of this?<eos> I was not, but I'm willing to drop that count altogether if it makes things easier.<eos> Well, here's the thing.<eos> This clause was unlawful when you included it in Mr. Hendricks' employment agreement.<eos> Right.<eos> As I said, I'm willing to just move past this.<eos> See, again, I don't think you understand.<eos> If Mr. Hendricks hadn't hired Mr. Dunn, or you hadn't pursued him for that hire, I'm not sure I would've noticed the violation.<eos> But you did, so I did.
Oh, wait.<eos> - Hold on.<eos> - What?<eos> Gilfoyle, what's happening? What? That's weird.<eos> Kernel panic.<eos> The whole system just crashed.<eos> So, what does that mean?<eos> Did you delete Pied Piper or not?<eos> Nope.<eos> We definitely did not.
Let us never speak of him again.<eos> Well, that is fine by me, and I'm so glad you got him away from Pied Piper.<eos> I mean, now that their suit has been resolved, I think that they're about to become something really special.<eos> Their core technology, it's visionary.<eos> - Absolutely.<eos> - Also, the entirety of their recent stumbles with Homicide, with Intersite, with the very decision to pursue video instead of more pioneering applications.<eos> This was all rooted in human error, which is why I found it prudent to secure Hanneman's shares, his voting rights, and most critically, his board seats.<eos> Right.<eos> Russ has two board seats.<eos> He did.
Happy birthday, sweetheart.<eos> Thanks, Mom.<eos> I can't believe how fast time flies.<eos> That it's starting.<eos> It'll be all right.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> I promise.<eos> Dad taught me everything he knows.<eos> Yes.<eos> He did.
- And you, what?<eos> You just want to come along for the ride?<eos> Why don't you tell me how you knew where the boy was?<eos> My wife and I, we were hunting Evos because we thought they'd killed our son on June 13th.<eos> It was, uh, I don't know, some misguided retribution.<eos> We were gonna kill him.<eos> Evos did not kill your son.<eos> Look, I don't know you okay, but something tells me you understand loss and what that does to a parent.<eos> You don't know anything about me.<eos> Okay, fine. Maybe I don't.
But I should've known.<eos> Follow-through was never your strong suit.<eos> I see you've embraced your powers.<eos> Put down the gun, Jo.<eos> None of this is gonna bring back Dennis.<eos> All the blood we spilled, Joanne, it was for nothing.<eos> Don't tell me you didn't feel better when you killed them.<eos> I didn't.<eos> Liar!<eos> I only did it for you.
Good luck.<eos> What is this?<eos> Something to the kitchen perhaps?<eos> There must be. "Kitchenware."<eos> You know what the worst thing you are?<eos> -No.<eos> You're talking like hell.<eos> Shut up just yesterday, yak-yak.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> -Of Course I do.
Also, I am here to see and learn.<eos> Then I will talk.<eos> -What? "Late"?<eos> -If A few years go Martin retired.<eos> Then Tomstad Martin and Oskar becomes Tomstad.<eos> When will I be Oskar.<eos> Then there's a new Jenny as tactically shut up.<eos> Then it is I who am Oskar.<eos> You're kidding, right?<eos> -Of Course I do.
I'll draw a fresh blood sample.<eos> Come on.<eos> You need to lie down.<eos> Come here.<eos> - How'd you convince her?<eos> - The way you taught me.<eos> With a gun and the truth.<eos> Gun?<eos> I thought you flew to New York.<eos> I did.
I'm pretty sure it was, anyway.<eos> It was encrypted.<eos> It turned out to be a top secret document.<eos> Taken from the CIA.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> It describes a completely illegal arrangement between German and American intelligence.<eos> Germany's doing an end run around its privacy laws by having the US do the spying for them.<eos> That's what the doc says.<eos> Well, how do you know it's real?<eos> Well, I don't.
Actually, I can think for myself.<eos> I've always said that Kai was too dangerous to become leader of the coven.<eos> You've been wasting your time with Jo.<eos> We both know she's never gonna beat him.<eos> You don't get it, do you?<eos> -Get what?<eos> -You just cloaked me and I couldn't fight it.<eos> You're stronger than me.<eos> No, you don't know that.<eos> Yes, I do.
It is the cornerstone of My Kingdom.<eos> Wars have been waged over it.<eos> So I'll put it in the same ballpark as the rooster, then?<eos> - Yeah. I think that sounds... yeah.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Sir Galavant will fight the first match.<eos> I can tell you want to bail.<eos> I'll give you five seconds to bail.<eos> I don't want to bail.<eos> - I do.

Ow.<eos> Rough night?<eos> I don't remember what happened.<eos> You said her pretty brain exploded and went all over her face.<eos> And you tried to kiss her.<eos> You were a bit of a mess, sir.<eos> A big, hot mess.<eos> Well, that's the least of our problems.<eos> I think I might have ruined our only chance, and now I don't know what to do.<eos> Good thing I do.
What about the other young lady?<eos> Sally, or something?<eos> ~ She could it, couldn't she?<eos> ~ Do you mean Sarah?<eos> I'm a contortionist.<eos> I can't even swim.<eos> No-one's asking you to cross the channel.<eos> It's gone!<eos> The rest of the cash.<eos> What did you do with it, MacKenzie?
Good morning.<eos> Why did you take this money?<eos> Because it was owed to me and I needed it to send to Pearl's aunty so she could buy her a proper headstone.<eos> Shouldn't Mr MacKenzie do that, as Pearl's fiance?<eos> You and Pearl were close, weren't you?<eos> We were friends.<eos> Sid said he had nothing against her type.<eos> Now, what would he mean by that?<eos> ~ You took her beads.<eos> ~ Yes, I did.
But you turned a blind eye, even let him be the air show ace, someone like that, someone so... depraved.<eos> Forget the union.<eos> Manning was going to bring down the RAAF all on his own.<eos> Somebody had to do something.<eos> Ginny knew it was dangerous... .. impersonating an officer.<eos> But it was the only way she could see.<eos> When I tried to warn her off the unions, she said she had no choice.<eos> She would do anything for the Air Force.<eos> Group Captain Compton ordered her to find out the truth and she said she was going to see it through.<eos> And she did.
Which means the skin for his operations came from somewhere...<eos> Or someone else.<eos> These aren't wounds from a knife fight, are they, Dr Harcourt?<eos> You were using Jimmy and Badger as your guinea pigs.<eos> I didn't have a choice.<eos> Men like Archie, they need skin from other donors, and I paid the boys, I paid them well.<eos> They knew what they were doing.<eos> It was perfectly safe!<eos> But Jimmy didn't take the sulphur like I told him.<eos> No, he didn't.
Big scar running down the side of his face.<eos> Roberto Salvatore.<eos> It was only a matter of time before he turned up.<eos> You know him?<eos> He's camorristi, one of the higher ranks.<eos> I suspect he ordered Concetta's husband Fabrizi to burn down Nonna Luisa's restaurant.<eos> And I'm guessing he had an alibi for that.<eos> Several.<eos> Well, at least we know how this whole thing began.<eos> We do?
I just need to finish packing.<eos> Wait downstairs?<eos> Milady.<eos> My Lord.<eos> I call.<eos> Three jacks.<eos> Shall we keep playing?<eos> I, um... .. I seem to be low on funds.<eos> But you hold an IOU signed by my father.<eos> Yes, I do.
Hello, Hugh.<eos> I've brought you some evidence.<eos> Lucky one of us is working on the case.<eos> No, I was just... I was just checking something.<eos> ~ Oh, no.<eos> ~ What?<eos> Look!<eos> 'It's a handful of fun for Senior Constable Hugh Collins and Miss Phryne Fisher's companion, Miss Dorothy Williams.'<eos> ~ It looks like you're touching my...<eos> ~ No, it doesn't, Dottie.
I shouldn't have lied.<eos> It won't help our investigation.<eos> If you and Terence were a couple long before you met Stanley, then why the need to keep it secret?<eos> Because... we were intimate.<eos> If the press ever found out, they'd gladly drag me down - all for the sake of a youthful dalliance.<eos> If that's all it was, then why keep this photograph?<eos> I forgot about it.<eos> I don't want Stanley to find out and get the wrong impression.<eos> So, your husband doesn't know about your history with Mr Lawson?<eos> STANLEY: Yes, he does.
I don't own much.<eos> I like to keep it safe.<eos> Something wrong?<eos> Just admiring the cut of your jib.<eos> (Laughs) Mind if I do the same?<eos> Oooh, is this a private party?<eos> I'm missing all the fun.<eos> I might go and find myself a drink.<eos> Say, did I mention that Jack and me had a swell talk this afternoon?<eos> No, you didn't.
Yeah.<eos> Oh, that's weird.<eos> Hey, Mae, what's happening?<eos> Hey, Josh, are you with Tom?<eos> No, why?<eos> Josh, I broke up with your father.<eos> Oh, are... Are you OK?<eos> He called Tom.<eos> Do you know why?<eos> No. No, I do not.
Oh, just-- it's the oil.<eos> It's just making it very hard to get any leverage.<eos> Oh, Josh here got your mother's wedding ring stuck on his finger.<eos> Why?<eos> Why would he do that?<eos> Josh is funny.<eos> And a considerate fellow.<eos> Never litters.<eos> Dad, does this mean you and Josh are married then?<eos> No, of course it doesn't.
Because then arnold will find out and he'll realize what kind of people we are.<eos> -Do you actually have worms?<eos> Is this your sneaky little way Of putting your worms on my shoulders?<eos> -I don't know why you two don't just date each other.<eos> -You make a beautiful couple.<eos> -16 years for a goldfish! Wow!<eos> -Well, it's very obvious you guys are talking about me.<eos> -Definitely not.<eos> -Because I really don't think that I gave you worms.<eos> -Neither do we.

I love tea.<eos> I don't know why I was just a bit weirdly aggressive about the tea.<eos> -Is it weird that you just met my parents?<eos> So I forgot to get you anything, And then I got you this ice cream,<eos> Then they told me you're not allowed to eat,<eos> But I wanted you to see that I tried.<eos> -Did you get yourself one?<eos> -Yeah, no.<eos> -Do you want to eat it?<eos> -Fuck yes, I do.
-I can't do that.<eos> -I had a funny story about a poodle, but... I'll save it for another day.<eos> -Should be stop drinking the champagne?<eos> -It feels a little bit inappropriate now.<eos> -When are you going to find out how it goes, josh?<eos> -Ah, not for a while.<eos> The hospital's going to call me.<eos> -You're on his hospital call list?<eos> -I had no idea you kept seeing each other.<eos> -We didn't.

I like to call it jazz because it comes out of my horn and you never know where it's gonna go.<eos> That is so gross.<eos> (With Patois accent) Me hearing a lot of chitchat.<eos> Me don't hear you answering that question, why?<eos> And you never will.<eos> I would chug the jazz.<eos> (Jaime) Lincoln, can I tell you a secret?<eos> I want to practice talking in an American accent, but I'm very scared.<eos> You're in international waters, man, spread your wings.<eos> Okay, I do this for you.
This is a count of men, ships, and defenses in York City.<eos> - Put this in the drop along with Abigail's note.<eos> - Abe. No, Tallmadge will need to read both of these right away.<eos> - Take it.<eos> I have to go.<eos> - Abe.<eos> Take it.<eos> I'm using Hewlett to get around Mary.<eos> She thinks I'm in New York studying the law.<eos> - Everyone does.
- ( barks ) - Pork for you.<eos> Hallum: Doyouknowthe hour?<eos> - ( pounding ) - What in God's name...?<eos> - Dr. Charles Hallum? - Uh...<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but you have something I need.<eos> What is this about?<eos> A shipment.<eos> A bust of the king commissioned from a Miss Patience Wright in London.<eos> But I don't have it.<eos> I- - I never did.
Do it.<eos> Look at you.<eos> Okay, let me try to, uh, step now.<eos> Okay. And take it easy, all right?<eos> Okay.<eos> Here goes.<eos> Slowly.<eos> Slowly.<eos> I can't believe it.<eos> I did it.
What about you?<eos> I'm right where I need to be.<eos> And when I don't need to be here, the beast and I will get back on the road.<eos> You're gonna finish the trip on your own?<eos> Well, a plan's a plan.<eos> Anyway, Mike says...<eos> he's gonna meet me there.<eos> I bet he will.<eos> I believe it.<eos> I do.
like a TV personality rather than someone that I actually knew.<eos> But that's why we're doing the song, you know? So we can get to know each other before it's too late.<eos> That was beautiful.<eos> Thank you. Thank you, man.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey.<eos> Do you want to get a drink this Saturday?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, I do.
Nothing good can come from loving you.<eos> Except for my three babies.<eos> Now I'm gonna focus on someone who really loves me.<eos> Splendid boy.<eos> He came out to the world, and nothing changed, Lucious.<eos> You're still you.<eos> He's still Jamal.<eos> The whole world knows. No one cares. The world is still spinning, Lucious.<eos> No one cares that he's gay.<eos> But I do.
Can you talk to mom so we can all come home?<eos> Your mother and I can't live together anymore.<eos> Well...<eos> Can you ask her if I can come live with you?<eos> I'll help take care of you, dad.<eos> I can do stuff around the house.<eos> You'll see.<eos> It's not that simple.<eos> Don't you want me?<eos> Of course I do.
Would you?<eos> Let's take one more peek and make sure that that sucker's still in there.<eos> Yep.<eos> Why don't I read you a book?<eos> Which one do you want?<eos> No, thank you.<eos> You don't want a story, Tom?<eos> Those boys don't have daddies, either.<eos> You know, your daddy loves you very much.<eos> No, he does not.

- You're doing it for you!<eos> - No, for us.<eos> - Leave us out of it.<eos> - Shall we talk about it?<eos> No.<eos> Okay.<eos> I'll be back in three hours. Then we can all go away.<eos> As a family.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - No, you don't.
Don't start with him, Terrence.<eos> He feels bad enough already.<eos> - Don't you, Jimmy?<eos> - Does he? Does he?<eos> How do you think I felt having to sit in that classroom and hear about the class ass - and all of his antics?<eos> - Enough!<eos> How about one of your jokes, funnyman, huh?<eos> How about one of your hysterical one-liners - that gets the class all riled up? - All right.<eos> He gets it.<eos> Does he?

And the decisions about what kind of man he's going to be - are made at this age. - Are you kidding me?<eos> I think you're overreacting, Terrence.<eos> Am I?<eos> Look at your brothers.<eos> Leave them out of this.<eos> You can't compare it.<eos> Well, weren't they about his age when they started running numbers for Mr. Dolan?<eos> That was different.<eos> We didn't have a father around.<eos> Yeah, but James does.
What about the queers?<eos> You want to collar these poor bastards because they want to get together, have a few beers, and play a little grab-ass?<eos> I know I don't want to.<eos> I'm guessing you don't want to, either, because it's my understanding you're a college kid and therefore must be pretty bright.<eos> So, then, what exactly do we do here?<eos> Well, as I'm sure your father must have explained to you, we do what has been done for the last hundred years... we manage it for the city.<eos> Think of us as the landlords.<eos> And if you want to be in business you got to pay your rent.<eos> Do you understand what I am telling you?<eos> - Yes, I do.
Yeah.<eos> Just, like... Thinking about stuff.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, I am feeling bad because...<eos> The other day, you know, when I thought I was gonna have the baby...<eos> When I found out that I wasn't, I felt so relieved.<eos> I mean, I have a job that pays me nothing and that's probably not gonna last much longer, and I have no idea even how to take care of myself, and I just... something shifts.<eos> You just have to trust me.<eos> Something shifts, and you'll figure it out.<eos> But what if I don't?
If you hadn't stolen my knife in the first place, none of it would've ever happened.<eos> I was eight years old.<eos> I was looking at it 'cause I was a curious little kid.<eos> I told you to give it back.<eos> You wouldn't give it back.<eos> Could've been a little more generous.<eos> Noyou stole it.<eos> I asked you to put it down.<eos> You didn't ask me to do anything.<eos> Yes, I did.
You've supported us for so long, honey.<eos> And I want to see you doing something that you truly enjoy and that you're happy doing.<eos> And I see it.<eos> I see it here.<eos> You love working here.<eos> I can make money.<eos> It's just for a little while.<eos> And we'll work here together as well.<eos> I think we can do it.<eos> You do?
Like, I think he literally might have shit himself.<eos> Did you shit yourself, Josh?<eos> No.<eos> Would you just mind your own business?<eos> I didn't...<eos> Who invited you here anyway?<eos> I'm-I'm running shit.<eos> Did you shit yourself?<eos> Would you just mind your own business?<eos> You did, didn't you?
Suck him off, man!<eos> Finish him off!<eos> Somehow he has a penis now!<eos> Work the shaft, Josh.<eos> Come on.<eos> Now you get it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Get it off!<eos> Aah!<eos> Do it!
(aliens hissing) JOSH:<eos> Yeah, yeah. Okay.<eos> I'm sorry, okay?<eos> I care... I care about this.<eos> Okay?<eos> We can't help it.<eos> We find you irresistible.<eos> You...<eos> I can't believe you guys think I'm handsome.<eos> We don't.
Okay...<eos> This is the one-hour warning For the city-wide curfew.<eos> Please return to your homes now.<eos> Ugh, I can't take it anymore.<eos> Go back to space, you crummy aliens!<eos> Hey, I thought you stopped reading that magazine.<eos> R-really?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You said it was a dumb magazine for kids who play too many video games.<eos> I-I did?
- You know how I talk.<eos> Anyway, the point is... - What's the point?<eos> - ... the night is young!<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Follow the jiggling... ♪ Ting-aling-aling!<eos> - I can't say no to that guy.<eos> - That is unbelievable.<eos> - ♪ Tinga-linga-ling. ♪ - Did you know he could do that?<eos> - Did you teach him this?<eos> - I do now.
Mary is convinced the authorities will be hunting us down.<eos> You should leave immediately.<eos> Without them?<eos> No.<eos> Where were you, Peter?<eos> Is he dead?<eos> I laid him to rest myself.<eos> Then it's over.<eos> Jesus foretold that Judas would betray him to the Sanhedrin.<eos> And he did.
April.<eos> All we need is a 15 or a 16.<eos> So just breathe in... and visualize your energy<eos> - flowing through your hand. And remember... - Okay.<eos> The dart throws itself.<eos> Okay.<eos> What the hell was that?<eos> ! Are you kidding me?<eos> You said that that dart throws itself.<eos> And it didn't.
Well, thank you.<eos> Oh, God!<eos> I know!<eos> I stink!<eos> Well, quit stinking!<eos> Gladly!<eos> I quit!<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah. You can't quit in the middle of a tournament!<eos> I just did.
Was it a friendly kiss or a sexy kiss?<eos> Show me on my hand.<eos> Get out!<eos> Well, then what'd you do?<eos> I ran my ass out of there.<eos> All right, then you did nothing wrong.<eos> Well, then why do I feel like crap?<eos> Maybe because you been flirting with her all week, you didn't leave the bar when you should have, and you ended the night smooching up on some strange.<eos> Oh, God, how am I gonna tell Molly about this?<eos> You don't.
And the next time that you are... feeling a little lonely or... you know, underappreciated, will you just come and talk to me and not put yourself in an awkward situation?<eos> I won't.<eos> Thanks for being so understanding.<eos> Well, it happens.<eos> I learned that lesson at my writer's workshop.<eos> I mean, you may be just looking for a shoulder rub, but there's always someone that's looking to rub something else.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> I told you about that.<eos> No, you didn't.<eos> I didn't?
What's up?<eos> Um, someone saw Kiara on El Cajon.<eos> They said she's, uh, working as a prostitute.<eos> Oh yeah?<eos> Who's they?<eos> A friend of Daphne's. Or someone she knows, I guess.<eos> Well, that's a pretty rough part of town.<eos> Rita said that there's nothing that we can do.<eos> You talked to Rita?<eos> - Daphne did, yeah. - Hmm.
That we're adopting the baby.<eos> Hey, uh, Mariana?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Will you shut the door?<eos> Sounds serious.<eos> Um... [clears throat] ... I... saw Ana at my dad's.<eos> Moms aren't gonna take her baby.<eos> - Did she tell you that?<eos> - No, I don't think she knows yet.<eos> Or maybe she does.
It was around, uh, 8:00 a.m. or something...<eos> Owen, we need you to tell us exactly exactly what happened when you saw Zoey today!<eos> I answered the door.<eos> And then I pushed her away when she tried to hug me. It was just super awkward 'cause my actual girlfriend was there.<eos> Was she upset?<eos> Yeah, she seemed pretty pissed off.<eos> I mean... she said that I lied to her.<eos> And I was just like the others.<eos> Um... then I told her to leave.<eos> And... and she did.
Probably do the same.<eos> Meaning what?<eos> Meaning you were struggling out there with that detective.<eos> What?<eos> I'm answering the questions.<eos> I'm... I'm selling the story.<eos> I'm not so sure.<eos> I'm watching her react to you, and I'm telling you, if they get a hint that we're not being truthful, it's...<eos> Look, the point is, considering what you've been through, it's okay to tell them that you need a break.<eos> Except that I don't.
But I don't accept it, and you can't, either.<eos> The police must hear the truth from us.<eos> When I last spoke with Daniel, he was happy, committed to turning his life around, to spending it with me, to being a family.<eos> He did love you, Margaux.<eos> That's how I know she's lying.<eos> Daniel had moved on from Emily.<eos> He had no reason to come to her house.<eos> She lured him here, then killed him in cold blood.<eos> You of all people should know that.<eos> But I don't.
Of the 62 members of the staff, only 56 have gone through a pat-down and search.<eos> Of the six that didn't, only one is still unaccounted for after the blast-- a waiter.<eos> Okay, hit me with a name.<eos> Bertrand Willis.<eos> Okay.<eos> Bertrand Willis.<eos> What database are you running his name through?<eos> I created a way to consolidate municipal, federal, state and even international criminal databases.<eos> Do I want to know how you do this?<eos> You most certainly do not.
I'm rehabilitated.<eos> I don't drink or drug no more like before.<eos> For real.<eos> Look.<eos> Clean and sober.<eos> I'm thrilled for you.<eos> Bomb at City Park.<eos> Got your old bosses written all over it.<eos> I don't know anything.<eos> Yes, you do.

No.<eos> See, I could have sworn there was one more peanut butter left.<eos> That's how it is, isn't it?<eos> You always think there's one more peanut butter left.<eos> Morgan.<eos> Maybe we just leave him here.<eos> That's not who you are.<eos> I know.<eos> Hey.<eos> You don't.
I stopped him.<eos> We have a good hour until we have 'em to green when we hand them off to Daryl, Sasha, and Abraham.<eos> Why don't you head back, tell everyone what's happening?<eos> - They should know.<eos> - Okay, Rick, I just--<eos> Will you do that for me?<eos> I'll take care of that one.<eos> Michonne, you take point.<eos> I know it's how it is.<eos> I do.
It made sense for me to leave Marty behind.<eos> And that was someone I loved.<eos> Because I understand that in order to get ahead and stay ahead, you have to cut ties.<eos> So I'm a dumb shit because I won't cut ties with Demark?<eos> Wow, you must have a big brain for science, because your people sense isn't exactly top-notch.<eos> And you hired a chief financial officer who cheated his way through business school.<eos> Though I suppose you can't be blamed for not digging through the official records of the Columbia University judicial board.<eos> They were never able to prove...<eos> But even when someone's profligacy and petulance is draining money from your pocket, you still don't see it.<eos> Or maybe you do.
William...<eos> I should just... I'll go...<eos> Hey, Jeannie, how's Edwin?<eos> He's fine. Yeah?<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> I can't wait to meet him. The father of your child.<eos> Where did you say he worked again?<eos> Skadden Arps.<eos> Skadden Arps, that's right.<eos> I do a lot of business with Skadden Arps.
Abraham was spying for Hewlett.<eos> No.<eos> No, it is the furthest thing from true.<eos> But you already knew that, didn't you?<eos> - Father, please.<eos> - Don't "Father" me.<eos> You knew it as well.<eos> Knew what?<eos> That your husband is a spy for the rebels.<eos> - I didn't.
So I was hoping that you could write to the people that you know on the rebel side.<eos> I have no contact with the rebels.<eos> Now I should get back before Mr. DeJong decides to dock my pay.<eos> Anna!<eos> I am doing all I can to get Abe out of prison.<eos> And if your feelings for him are even half of his for you, then you would do the same.<eos> I don't care if you're a Patriot.<eos> All I care about is freeing Abraham.<eos> And if Hewlett is being held by the Patriots, then you should write them.<eos> I did.
Got him?<eos> I got him.<eos> Come on... Come here!<eos> Get down...<eos> Come here!<eos> Aah!<eos> I broke my ankle!<eos> Yeah.<eos> I had him.<eos> You did.
You don't need to worry about me, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Good night, Alan.<eos> Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> This episode you had... was very traumatic, I know, but it's no excuse.<eos> We counsel hope, not fire and brimstone.<eos> I have a new message.<eos> What you're saying could bring us down.<eos> -This has nothing to do with you.<eos> -The hell it doesn't.
I simply refuse.<eos> Life has to make more sense than that.<eos> Dude, we just got in a little fight.<eos> And now I'm taking the bus home to show you how mad I am.<eos> - You're supposed to come after me. - Oh.<eos> You thought we broke up?<eos> People don't behave like that, dummy.<eos> Want to go get some food, help me figure out how to get my deposit back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
I don't know.<eos> Something just... feels weird.<eos> You mean besides the fact that we don't remember where we came from or what we did?<eos> Yeah.<eos> You don't feel it?<eos> Do we really know everything about each other?<eos> That old Bronco outside, you say that it's practical, but it actually cost 300 a month just to keep it running.<eos> You keep it because you don't like to negotiate, and you don't want a new car.<eos> You love Patsy Cline, and you think that you sing "Crazy" pretty well.<eos> - I do.
Nathan, this won't work.<eos> You won't work.<eos> Why? To power the barn you need Aether activated in living form, me.<eos> I need more for the huge power necessary for a barn.<eos> The Aether needs a catalyst, a complementary energy to supercharge it.<eos> The same energy it has always needed, love.<eos> The energy it needed when she went in as Lucy and as Sarah.<eos> - I...<eos> - You do not have that.<eos> I do.
To what do I owe this unexpected surprise?<eos> I hear you're preaching again.<eos> Gathering a flock. Just spreading the word of my calamitous fall and subsequent rebirth in the light of the Lord, Raylan.<eos> You know you're repeating yourself, right?<eos> Raylan Givens, I know you have never believed a word that has come out of my mouth. Though I have harbored the secret hope that you have nevertheless enjoyed hearing them.<eos> Well, of all the nonsense I've heard you spin, such as "the blacks are the problem, "the Jews are the mud people,"<eos> I will grant you one thing.<eos> I do believe you loved Ava.<eos> Did you find her?<eos> We did.
I'm just gonna continue my career as the Minister's fallen daughter.<eos> You worried?<eos> No.<eos> Uh...<eos> No, no, this is...<eos> Really, this is my dream.<eos> Ever since I was a little girl, I was like, "I'm gonna have a baby in my teens.<eos> We're gonna be close to the same age, so we'll still, you know, be able to party together."<eos> I'm glad to see you've thought this all through.<eos> Yeah, I did.
We got something.<eos> - Put your hands on your head.<eos> - Take him!<eos> Against the truck.<eos> What are you doing in here without protection?<eos> I've been around the bodies so much that if there's something to get, I've already got it.<eos> Well, from what we're looking at, I wouldn't be quite so relaxed.<eos> You can do this?<eos> You think it's that serious?<eos> Yes, we do.
But that's the Lotts.<eos> I mean, they think they're above the law.<eos> But sooner or later, Ronnie would've got arrested.<eos> So I went down there to put a stop to it.<eos> When I got there, I realized... she was trying to kill herself.<eos> She had a gun.<eos> I tried to stop her.<eos> I couldn't.<eos> I believe you.<eos> But you don't, do you?
Her fever's getting higher.<eos> Wiley and I will go back into town tonight.<eos> Why not just sneak into town by yourself, get the drugs?<eos> Forget about Wiley altogether.<eos> You don't need her.<eos> Look, she's our insurance policy in case things go sideways.<eos> Rumor has it, Chuck has half the hockey team armed.<eos> Are you saying what I think you're saying?<eos> I doubt it'll come to that.<eos> If it does?
- Yeah, no.<eos> - Okay, fine.<eos> You want to know why I didn't go?<eos> Here's why I didn't go, 'cause I was afraid that your parents were gonna ask us why we weren't married.<eos> That's why I didn't go.<eos> So what's the big deal?<eos> You're gonna get married, eventually.<eos> I don't know if we have to.<eos> I don't know if I want to.<eos> You don't?
Yeah, but I didn't know bauerschwein and blutbaden had this ancient feud.<eos> Doesn't justify what he did.<eos> I mean, Angelina did kill his brothers.<eos> Angelina?<eos> Yeah, Monroe's ex-girlfriend.<eos> That Angelina?<eos> She killed Orson's brothers?<eos> It was one of my first cases as a grimm.<eos> What the hell was I supposed to know?<eos> Well, more than I did.
Oh, right.<eos> I just spoke to my son.<eos> He's gonna meet us here.<eos> I hope that's all right.<eos> Oh, that's fine.<eos> Please, follow me.<eos> At first, we thought it was an electrical fire, but it's more complicated than that.<eos> What do you mean?<eos> It was made to look like a short started it.<eos> Then what did?
I missed you, too.<eos> Please tell me you don't have to go back on the road for a while.<eos> I hope not, believe me, but when work calls, I got to go.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> So did Mommy save me some dinner?<eos> Yeah?<eos> - I did.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Of course I did.
♪ Sink back into the ocean ♪<eos> ♪ Sink back into the o... ♪<eos> ♪ Sink back into the ocean ♪<eos> ♪ Sink back into the ocean ♪<eos> _<eos> Fuck.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> Oh, shit.<eos> I thought you said that you were considering it.<eos> I did.
Remember... you remember when you used to make those, uh, dream catchers in college?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Nothing.<eos> - Did I say something?<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> - Did I do something?<eos> - Mm-mm.<eos> - You hate almond milk.<eos> - No.<eos> - Yeah, you do.
- Language.<eos> - Why are you being so awful?<eos> I'm sorry, I just...<eos> I have a really busy schedule today.<eos> I have a meeting with my editor right after this.<eos> - I can't be late.<eos> - Understood, Mr. Solloway.<eos> If you cooperate, this goes quicker.<eos> Do you even want custody of them?<eos> Of course I do.
It's like she's trying to figure something out.<eos> What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Whether or not I want the baby.<eos> I mean, I understand why she's doing it.<eos> What I did was terrible.<eos> Not making it back for the birth.<eos> You know, she probably should've left me then.<eos> I would've left me.<eos> But she didn't.
Hi.<eos> Is this your daughter?<eos> Yeah, this is Joanie.<eos> Hi, Joanie.<eos> Uh, Gigi, I think...<eos> She's beautiful.<eos> Oh, isn't she, though?<eos> Everybody says she looks like Alison, but to me she looks like her daddy.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, she does to me, too.
Good.<eos> All right.<eos> - Very good.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, now, what's your buddy's name, what's his brother's name, and what firm does he work at?<eos> What?<eos> Well, you know I can't tell you that.<eos> What?<eos> You want to do a deal with me, and you don't trust me?<eos> Of course I do.
They're about to unseal those files.<eos> What are you gonna tell Acevedo?<eos> I'll tell them... that the deal fell apart.<eos> Yeah? And how'd it fall apart?<eos> How are you gonna explain that you were arrested for marijuana possession two days before you came to them with this deal, then charged the day after it supposedly fell apart?<eos> The only way you don't look like an FBI informant is to keep being an FBI informant.<eos> Youknowthat'snot true,right?<eos> You know that you could have just not charged him...?<eos> Yeah, I knew that.<eos> The kid didn't.
And now his dad wants you dead, and for some reason, you're trying to pr...<eos> No, no.<eos> It's not his dad that wants me dead.<eos> So I'm... Am I... I'm free to go?<eos> Completely.<eos> My dad should be here any second.<eos> I assume you guys don't want to meet him.<eos> I think it'd be better if he never knew we existed.<eos> I know people will never know what you did today, but...<eos> I do.
- You can trust me, sir.<eos> Yeah, come here.<eos> Help me up.<eos> I need to show Washington that I can stand, that I can fight.<eos> That I can fight.<eos> I...<eos> I said some words to him, words that I should not have said.<eos> Oh, sir, he speaks very highly of you.<eos> - He knows you are his friend.<eos> - Does he?
- Exactly.<eos> So where is the note?<eos> Surely you brought it back with you?<eos> Well, if I'd... If I took the note, I thought they'd know someone was onto them.<eos> - So...<eos> - So another dead end.<eos> How inconvenient.<eos> Well, not quite.<eos> No, I... I decided to wait there to see if someone would come along and pick up the note.<eos> And around midnight, someone did.
She's your wife?<eos> Yes, she's my wife.<eos> You don't love her anymore and cheat on her?<eos> Love has nothing to do with it.<eos> What is it then?<eos> I'm very happy I met you.<eos> I think you're stunning.<eos> You're a gorgeous woman.<eos> You mean you want to sleep with me?<eos> Don't you?
He won't come back.<eos> Maybe I'll be gone when he does.<eos> If he comes back, I'll have to clout him.<eos> I'm not joking.<eos> Neither am I.<eos> I'm ready to fight for you.<eos> Is this Julien tough?<eos> Yes.<eos> Shit.<eos> I did pretty good last time.
- I know.<eos> - We are so close.<eos> - No.<eos> I mean, you're obsessed with Blanca.<eos> When did we become maids who solve murders?<eos> - Blanca was one of us.<eos> - I know!<eos> But can't we talk about something fun for once?<eos> - She wants to talk about herself.<eos> - No, I don't.
I don't care.<eos> You sent Louie Becker to spy on Taylor?<eos> I wanted to prove she was sleeping around, but I never heard from him again.<eos> The next morning...<eos> - His leg was on Evelyn's lawn.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> I can't see Taylor chopping up a body and throwing the parts all over town.<eos> Yeah, it must've been her lover.<eos> But nobody knows who he is.<eos> - Katy does.
There are tool marks on one of these pulleys.<eos> Looks like somebody intentionally jammed the winch cable.<eos> Yeah, they probably knew the victim would crawl into the gap to fix it.<eos> Yeah, and then once he was in there, pulled the lever, and squish.<eos> Victim has a couple nasty bruises on his face.<eos> Yeah, yeah, I saw those.<eos> Looks like he got into a fistfight.<eos> How old do you think those bruises are, David?<eos> Recent.<eos> I don't know-- 24, 48 hours maybe?
She's convinced...<eos> Shepherd is in a party of one.<eos> If there's even the slightest bit of hope, don't you want to know that?<eos> Robbins, can you name the single worst, most malignant symptom of terminal cancer?<eos> It's hope.<eos> It's recurrent, and it keeps creeping back in, no matter how many times it gets ripped apart.<eos> Mayo gave me hope in a phase 3 clinical trial.<eos> It failed.<eos> N.Y.U. hoped that radiosurgery would work.<eos> It didn't.
And?<eos> What'd you see?<eos> I saw through her eyes.<eos> She went outside, down the street, and then...<eos> I know where she was taken from.<eos> The Man's mama wore that very dress the day she got married.<eos> Ain't it beautiful?<eos> It's real pretty.<eos> You wore it when you got married?<eos> We all done.
I'll try.<eos> I see blood.<eos> Widen your lens.<eos> We need an address.<eos> There-there was, there was a man and he was trying to tell me something.<eos> I need, uh, something to write.<eos> A pen and paper.<eos> Here we go.<eos> We have an address.<eos> Oh, yes, we do.
I'll let you know what I find.<eos> These guys are late.<eos> What are you looking for?<eos> - Don't worry, baby.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Donnie! Hey, hey, hey, easy!<eos> I've got a gun in my hands!<eos> You brought a gun to a drug deal?<eos> What are you, crazy?<eos> Of course I did.
You're trying awfully hard to save someone you tried to kill once.<eos> How do you know about that?<eos> We took care of Helena, spent time with her.<eos> She said it was you that shot her.<eos> The more reason I'm doing this.<eos> You know, it's not her fault, the way she is.<eos> She's not a monster, she was just... Trained to be a killer.<eos> Does that sound familiar?<eos> How do you know she's even still alive?<eos> I just do.
Little brother.<eos> Well?<eos> What are you waiting for?<eos> Well done, brother.<eos> Good to see you, sir.<eos> All right, you jackass, go grab that box.<eos> We got to bring it home.<eos> You know we don't leave loose ends.<eos> No.<eos> No, we don't.
What don't you get?<eos> What happened?<eos> Tell me.<eos> Ask her to come along.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Quick job, then back to the cafe.<eos> - Ask her!<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> We just met!<eos> Just do it!
Quit laughing, man!<eos> What do you have to do there?<eos> It's just a meeting.<eos> - Go right?<eos> - Yes, right.<eos> Dude, she got it!<eos> Just tell her she's safe, OK?<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> I took care of that, wanker.<eos> Yeah, man, Boxer, he really did.
How are your systems running?<eos> - Fine, thank you, Mattie.<eos> - Yeah?<eos> No errors?<eos> Diagnostics all good?<eos> I detect no errors in my system.<eos> I detected a pretty friggin' big one the other night.<eos> You know, suddenly switching to kidnap mode, "I'm here, help me!" Remember that?<eos> I'm afraid I don't.<eos> Well, I do.
'Cause it doesn't sound like you're supporting me at all.<eos> Oh, God, you didn't?<eos> I was trying to help.<eos> What did you even say to her?<eos> I just wanted to make sure she was aware of the challenges...<eos> You used my deafness?<eos> She needed to know your story.<eos> She knows I'm deaf.<eos> But she probably doesn't know the extent of the extra challenges you face.<eos> She does.
He has personal information.<eos> He knows my fiancé's name.<eos> Not only did he lock you out, he accessed your personal data-- your messages, phone calls, pictures.<eos> What is he going to do with it?<eos> Well, he's threatening to release it if you don't pay.<eos> What did he find on that phone you don't want your fiancé to see?<eos> Am I really expected to pay<eos> $250,000 to unlock my phone?<eos> Senator, we don't suggest you pay this ransom.<eos> And when I don't?
Lomis did.<eos> He sent it to us.<eos> He set us up to take the fall.<eos> You expect me to believe that?<eos> He didn't even show up...<eos> To collect his share of the take.<eos> Who passes up on that much money?<eos> I don't believe them.<eos> They know where Lomis is, they have to.<eos> No, they don't, Krumitz.
My mother had heard about a healer who could fix me.<eos> When we went to find him, we were caught by nomads and separated.<eos> I've been looking for her ever since.<eos> That's my home.<eos> That's Azra.<eos> Azra?<eos> Yes, it's beyond the badlands.<eos> Where did you get that?<eos> Do you remember how to get there?<eos> No, I... I don't.
Tell her that I'm sorry?<eos> I tried to find her. I never gave up.<eos> And that I love her.<eos> I'll never be able to keep that promise, kid.<eos> Find your mom and tell her yourself.<eos> This is your way out.<eos> If you get caught, you will be killed.<eos> Why are you helping me?<eos> Because I never had a choice.<eos> Now you do.
Wow.<eos> Yeah, you definitely need a better life.<eos> That's why I'm hanging out with you.<eos> Or maybe I should be working with your dad in the State Department.<eos> Yeah, think again.<eos> Do you even know what division he's in?<eos> Agriculture.<eos> It's so boring.<eos> He must know a lot about soil.<eos> Yeah, no, really, he does.
Uh, I think I know a little something about absinthe, my friend.<eos> It's hallucinogenic.<eos> I tell people, 'cause there's a tendency to creep up on 'em...<eos> I just said I know all about it.<eos> Doug... Like that.<eos> It's happening already. He's not listening, you know?<eos> Doug,<eos> I don't even like absinthe, and I will drink anything that makes me forget.<eos> Do you know what Oscar Wilde said about absinthe?<eos> I do.
Oh, they're tied up.<eos> I mean, not literally, of course.<eos> - Not anymore.<eos> - They're at Chicago PD.<eos> What's the latest with Terrance?<eos> Uh... still on the machine.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Hey, uh... you want to hear how Dawson found Brett and Mills?<eos> Yeah, yeah I do.
[Gasps and murmurs] What?<eos> I don't know why i said that--I'm nervous.<eos> He's not dead.<eos> But...<eos> He did ask me to cover for him for the surgery.<eos> But i don't think i should do it.<eos> I think neepa should do it instead.<eos> Really?<eos> I didn't earn this week.<eos> You did.
It doesn't make sense that Allen would risk hurting Brenda.<eos> He values her too much.<eos> Reid said he was legitimately scared at his house.<eos> You can't fake fear like that.<eos> The bomb in Archer's truck was planted by somebody else.<eos> A second unsub.<eos> Do you think Allen pissed off a partner who decided to take him out?<eos> Only one way to find out.<eos> We know you planted the bomb at the coffee shop because you wanted to be a hero, but you had nothing to do with the one at your house last night.<eos> Who did?
That's enough.<eos> This is going to take time, and while it does, you're going to keep this to yourself.<eos> Bullshit.<eos> You're just trying to buy time so you can get out of this.<eos> I'm not trying to buy anything.<eos> We have an agreement, and this is for your own good.<eos> Well, for your own good, you better remember what I'll do if this takes too long.<eos> Please tell me you had no other choice.<eos> You know damn well I didn't.<eos> No, I don't.
Already?<eos> What, did you pick something out of your generic favor file?<eos> I've never done anything generic in my life.<eos> This favor is tailor-made for you.<eos> It's very specific and very personal.<eos> We're in a little dispute with another firm.<eos> I need you to get them to back off of it.<eos> Why can't you do it yourself?<eos> 'Cause I don't know the lawyer on the other side.<eos> You do.
What you want is to know you've earned that.<eos> I have earned it, but I want you to know it.<eos> Okay, here it is.<eos> You got your name up there by finding leverage and using it to strong-arm me into doing something that I never would have done.<eos> See, I knew you--<eos> Let me finish.<eos> It was a stone-cold move, and it's exactly what Harvey would have done.<eos> Now, if that doesn't tell you that you've earned it, then I don't know what will.<eos> You still want me to reschedule my meeting?<eos> Yes, I do.
You saved it for me because you want to pretend to be my friend again.<eos> Louis, didn't you hear Jessica's speech?<eos> This is our chance wipe the slate clean.<eos> I did hear her speech, and I know that she sent you here to say that to me.<eos> No one sent me here.<eos> I'm here because I want to be here.<eos> You see, that's sweet.<eos> But how can I ever believe a word you say?<eos> I want to know if you ever thought once to tell me the truth about Mike.<eos> No, I didn't.
I'll never let you down again.<eos> I know you won't.<eos> Because if you do, that's the end of it.<eos> No more free passes. Do you hear me?<eos> - Loud and clear.<eos> - I'm fucking serious, Ricky.<eos> So am I. No more fucking around, okay?<eos> Babe, I promise.<eos> Good, and now you have this to remind you what an amazing and forgiving woman I am.<eos> That I do, okay?
We don't get it done, you could find yourself negotiating with somebody else next spring. I doubt he's gonna be the kind of guy you want to tip beers with, you know what I mean?<eos> I hate you.<eos> Hello?<eos> Mr. Strasmore, it's Karen Rossi from Citibank.<eos> Karen, right.<eos> I've been meaning to get back to you.<eos> Just a courtesy call.<eos> Your primary account is overdrawn, so I thought you might want to transfer some funds from your other account.<eos> I have another account?<eos> You do.
Yeah, I'm good.<eos> You gonna lie to Mama like that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Hey, you think I'm too heavy?<eos> No, Charles. I think you're burly.<eos> Robust.<eos> Fancy-ass words for fat.<eos> Baby, I think you're perfect.<eos> You know I love that sexy body.<eos> - Oh, you do, do you? - Mm-hmm.
Oh. You can place it on the table.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> We're gonna have fun.<eos> Ahem. Do you want a beer?<eos> Some water would be great.<eos> What do you do?<eos> Claymation.<eos> I do concept art for makeup effects.<eos> Where do you work?<eos> I don't.
Ask her who she's thinking about.<eos> Just tell the truth, Tawney.<eos> For once, just tell the truth.<eos> But that's the problem, Teddy.<eos> E-every time I tell the truth, I'm... I'm punished for it.<eos> 'Cause you always hold something back.<eos> You never tell the whole truth.<eos> Why are you always making me feel guilty about... about everything?<eos> Do you want me here with you?<eos> Of course I do.
I don't think anyone wears a jacket in Florida.<eos> Is that a no?<eos> It is a no.<eos> Did y'all talk about anything during the trip back?<eos> Spiritual matters.<eos> Spiritual matters?<eos> Sin, redemption, forgiveness, God's grace.<eos> It's a big subject.<eos> He didn't happen to discuss any specific sins, did he?<eos> No, he didn't.
Not yet.<eos> I prayed before I went in there.<eos> That's good.<eos> It's funny how often I forget to.<eos> We can drive around if you want, till you're ready to go back.<eos> Okay.<eos> Sondra: Foulkes said that there were 40 or so kids down at the river that night.<eos> That sounds a little high.<eos> Do you know how many of them were officially interviewed?<eos> I don't.
I mean, I still believe he had the motive, but I don't know.<eos> He's a confounding son of a bitch, but it just seems like he's too honest for his own good.<eos> Whereas Trey, feels like he's trying too hard.<eos> Too hard to do what?<eos> To pin it on Daniel.<eos> Okay.<eos> I got the warrant.<eos> All right.<eos> Still doesn't mean that Holden didn't kill Hanna Dean.<eos> Of course it doesn't.
Just in the nick.<eos> I'm proud of you, Daniel.<eos> For what?<eos> For trying.<eos> I saw Jon today.<eos> He told me about George Melton and Daggett.<eos> He loves you...<eos> I'm really sorry that you have to go through this again, Danny.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I do.
I'm paying you for this extra work, too.<eos> It won't take but a few hours.<eos> That's not even up for discussion.<eos> I did it, Melvin.<eos> What?<eos> The paint.<eos> Last night.<eos> The can... Just knocked it over.<eos> Well, these... These things happen.<eos> No, they don't.
You carrying?<eos> No, I'm not carrying, Carl.<eos> Can you put your hands up?<eos> Need to pat you down.<eos> I just said I'm not carrying, Carl.<eos> We got to follow procedure, Trey.<eos> Am I under arrest?<eos> No, you're not.<eos> You want to stay here while we do this?<eos> Of course I do.
She said to tell John that Stacey has the owl.<eos> When did she give you this message?<eos> Last night.<eos> See, that's not true, is it?<eos> Because Alice is dead.<eos> I know.<eos> I'm sorry, who are you?<eos> Look, I'm just here to help.<eos> - And how do you know Alice?<eos> - I don't.
Look at her life.<eos> Look at what he took from her.<eos> This wasn't murder, this was theft.<eos> Come again?<eos> I think he's this clever, little lonely man, slowly falling apart, spending his days watching the lives of others.<eos> And you know what that's like... other people's lives seem so much better than ours.<eos> More interesting, more attractive, more alive.<eos> The way he sees it, they got something that he needs so, he's just going to take it from them.<eos> No, he's never going to stop, he's just going to keep doing it and doing it, because he'll never get back whatever he's lost.<eos> None of us ever do.
I know.<eos> You promised.<eos> - You did nothing.<eos> - That's not true.<eos> I was ten years old!<eos> Too petrified to sleep.<eos> Do you know what happens to someone, when they don't sleep?<eos> - To their mind?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - You do?
No, boss.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Get off of me!<eos> Ow!<eos> They'll do her for intent to supply and then they'll upgrade to murder when they connect the toy to Jonathan.<eos> Do you feel better putting it right?<eos> Did you hurt her?<eos> Who?<eos> Alice.<eos> Did you?
That's all right.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I know.<eos> It's just, it's been six hours of this, and I... I don't know what to do anymore.<eos> Is it the heart murmur thing?<eos> No, it's, um, it's an ear infection and a chest cold, and this is my life.<eos> This is what it looks like now.<eos> Well, that question you were asking before about, do I want to be involved in my daughter's life?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Of course I do.
You know, a lot of people were saying that Simon Poole claimed he had a snitch in Grady's camp that ratted him out.<eos> You wouldn't have any idea who that was, would you?<eos> I'm confused.<eos> Are you calling me a murderer or are you calling me a rat? Well, neither, as such.<eos> I'm just... thinking.<eos> I mean, it... It wouldn't make sense for you to kill Poole to slow down Grady's case just to turn around and kill Grady so that you could be with Katherine if...<eos> If I was just gonna leave Kentucky? Exactly.<eos> That was not an easy decision.<eos> I loved Katherine.<eos> Still do.
You got to give an animal a fair shake.<eos> Well, makes sense.<eos> Johnny was a coward.<eos> I never understood where I went wrong with him. Why he saw fit to betray me.<eos> Devil, too.<eos> If they weren't happy with their lot in my crew. Why didn't they just come to me? I'm a reasonable man.<eos> We could have hashed our differences out over a bottle of Woodford.<eos> Why you think they wouldn't do that, Ava?<eos> Maybe because they were afraid of what you were gonna do to them.<eos> What you did to them.
Why you got that shoulder rig ... take any comers try to hit your vault full of drug money.<eos> You see that sign?<eos> Have a nice day, marshal.<eos> You see this star?<eos> Kiss my ass, Markham.<eos> Harlan.<eos> Hell of a place to make your fortune.<eos> Fortune?<eos> Hell, I'm putting down roots.<eos> Tough to do in quicksand.
Go on.<eos> Now, what say we see if we can all ride off into our respective sunsets?<eos> Katherine.<eos> - Boyd!<eos> - Katherine.<eos> Uh, ripping you off ... that was her idea from the jump ... payback for you murdering her husband.<eos> I just thought you ought to know.<eos> Baby, it's me! Oh, baby!<eos> Do you really think I had Grady murdered?<eos> I did.
Well, I called it in, made sure they knew you were emergent.<eos> You handcuffed me to a bumper, you left me there without so much as a fare-thee-well.<eos> You could hear the sirens on their way.<eos> Must have given you some solace.<eos> I don't suppose you've come to tell me you've found her.<eos> I found her truck some down the road, abandoned.<eos> No sign beyond.<eos> Gotta suck, be that close to the prize, have it shot out of your hand.<eos> - I kinda know how you feel.<eos> - No, you don't.
- You got any kin waiting on you?<eos> No, sir, I don't.<eos> That won't be necessary.<eos> Well... What can I do for you, officer?<eos> You can give me a ride.<eos> - This the shitbag?<eos> - It is. - Hello, shitbag.<eos> - Him there's the good news.<eos> - I don't want to hear the bad news.<eos> - No, sir, you do not.
Of course!<eos> What the hell you laughing about?<eos> It's a joke.<eos> Don't you get it?<eos> We're dead!<eos> No, we got to do something.<eos> We're gonna run.<eos> Hell yeah! Let's run!<eos> You know your way around this goddamn mountain, little girl?<eos> - 'Cause I sure as hell don't.
All right, now, get yourself in the Gremlin there.<eos> Open the door.<eos> Open the door.<eos> All right.<eos> Sit yourself down.<eos> And when Raylan comes back with my keys, we're gonna make the change, and it's nice in there.<eos> I got an air freshener smells like a mocha latte.<eos> - You hear that?<eos> - Uh, no, I di...<eos> Yes, I did.
What are you talking about?<eos> - Dad is not in his right mind.<eos> - Nonsense. He's in love.<eos> He's scared to take the plunge.<eos> You have to help him.<eos> I must intimidate him.<eos> Dad, in love?<eos> No.<eos> Yes. He told me so.<eos> Not explicitely, but he did.
[Belches] Uh, take your cargo and go.<eos> As always, Azmorigan, a pleasure doing business with you.<eos> - Where's Hera?<eos> - Tell her about Hera, Lando.<eos> Hera is following the plan, which is what we should be doing if we want to get her back.<eos> - Where's Hera?<eos> - What plan is she following?<eos> - I told her to take an escape pod.<eos> - You never told her that.<eos> I did, actually.
[ Sabine ] It's pretty old.<eos> He said his parents used it to broadcast from.<eos> [ Sighs ] I don't get it.<eos> They weren't soldiers, just citizens.<eos> - So why'd they risk it all?<eos> - They had hope. That they could do something to make the galaxy a better place for their son.<eos> [ Clears Throat ]<eos> Cutting it a little close.<eos> I know you don't want to miss Trayvis's meeting.<eos> Neither does the Empire.
Is this one of ours?<eos> I can barely read its operating number.<eos> [ Droid Language ]<eos> - This one's sealed shut.<eos> - Insurgents are loose in the sewers.<eos> Sound the alarm if you see any rebel activity.<eos> On to the next one.<eos> [ Disgusted Grunting ]<eos> Spectre-5, do you actually know where we're going?<eos> Of course I do.
Okay.<eos> Bye.<eos> Hey, Punk.<eos> Dad.<eos> I was just gonna go outside and get some... get some air.<eos> Was that...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, Cady's his daughter.<eos> I didn't... I didn't tell you that?<eos> No, you didn't.
I understand the rest of the world disappointing me.<eos> But you?<eos> What are you talking about?<eos> You lied to my face.<eos> Twice.<eos> You saw Henry walking with Gab yesterday morning.<eos> And yet you told me again and again that she was alone.<eos> How did you find out?<eos> Henry told me.<eos> He did?
We're with the crime lab. We need to speak with you.<eos> No, no, no, I'm busy.<eos> Just call my office.<eos> I got this.<eos> Oh, oh, I-I'm sorry, did that just happen?<eos> I can't hear you.<eos> Oh, that's better.<eos> What the hell is happening here?<eos> Do you own a 1938 Packard?<eos> Yes, I do.
Yeah, maybe there was a different shooter, someone closer to the guy who ordered the hit.<eos> In 1989,<eos> Duncan Reidel was 18 years old.<eos> So, Duncan could've been the one to pull the trigger for his father.<eos> And maybe there was something in that headrest that could've proven it.<eos> Like a bullet.<eos> Exactly.<eos> So let's see if there's something on this headrest that will help us make our case today.<eos> Did you get an I.D. off the headrest?<eos> Yeah, I did.
And now he's taken her and Cara!<eos> I didn't know.<eos> She didn't want to live with you.<eos> Hey, your daughters are missing, and this is not gonna help us find them. Let's just focus on bringing<eos> Lexi and Cara home.<eos> Please.<eos> All right.<eos> We still haven't found Hayes.<eos> Please, tell me you got something.<eos> As a matter of fact, I do.
- Hey, you.<eos> I'll be in in a minute.<eos> What about a Mr. Richmond?<eos> I told you I'm not gonna talk about it<eos> Get out of here!<eos> Sorry, no Richmond, no Jackson.<eos> Will that be all, detectives?<eos> You go on.<eos> I'm gonna walk home, get some air.<eos> Sure, do your thing.
Shocker.<eos> Look, I know you probably want to grab some shut-eye before you gotta wipe down menus and marry ketchups, but I gotta talk to you.<eos> Screw you.<eos> If a guy lets you walk home at 3:00 am with your panties in your purse, you're not his girlfriend.<eos> The guy you thought was your meal ticket is really just a bang buddy.<eos> But cute townies always get screwed. Literally.<eos> Wait, I was gonna ask you something.<eos> Oh!<eos> There's a reporter at The Observer you talked to, Rebecca Hinton.<eos> No, I didn't.
We have to talk.<eos> I can't deal with the form yet, I need another...<eos> We need to tell Major.<eos> Tell Major what?<eos> About zombies, about Blaine, the meal plan, you, everything!<eos> I can't have this conversation right now.<eos> I'm sorry, we have to.<eos> Okay.<eos> Absolutely not.<eos> There, done.
so that's probably why.<eos> I haven't seen it. You haven't seen "Six Feet Under"?<eos> ! Oh, God.<eos> You're so lucky.<eos> You know, I have the box set if you want to borrow it.<eos> Maybe we could watch it together sometime.<eos> (Enthusiastically) Yeah!<eos> I mean, yeah.<eos> If you... if you want to.<eos> I definitely do.
That's what he wants you to think!<eos> Once again, these nipple clamps are not tight enough.<eos> They keep popping off. Well, I'm sorry, ma'am.<eos> That's as tight as they get.<eos> Have a nice day.<eos> - Hi. - Hi.<eos> Sir, so I have a...<eos> this morning, I was...<eos> You tried to wash a dildo in a dishwasher?<eos> I did indeed.
Falling.<eos> Ooh, whoa, oh.<eos> (Laughing) I'm a dentist, not a doctor.<eos> I don't know how to deal with high-pressure situations.<eos> Don't worry...<eos> Lincoln, nothing matters.<eos> Yeah, it's fine.<eos> What just happened?<eos> It's a black Irish goodbye.<eos> He always does it.
I'm waiting, Clarke!<eos> Leave him alone!<eos> Go to hell!<eos> Go to hell?<eos> Great idea!<eos> How's that for hell?<eos> !<eos> You had to make it complicated.<eos> One slit across the throat, and it'd have been a quick death for both of them.<eos> So, now we do it my way in pieces.
You had to make it complicated.<eos> One slit across the throat, and it'd have been a quick death for both of them.<eos> So, now we do it my way in pieces.<eos> It's easier to burn the evidence.<eos> No, wait.<eos> Wait.<eos> Hey!<eos> Stay away from her!<eos> This is for killing my daughter.<eos> I did it!
I couldn't find you.<eos> Yeah, I know.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I just needed some time on my own.<eos> You all right?<eos> You want to go back down?<eos> - Hungry?<eos> - No. I don't like to be sad with other people.<eos> Me neither.<eos> Neither did mommy.
So what's the word on ours?<eos> Oh, a sanitation worker found our victim hidden under some trash bags up here.<eos> She's Anahita Menendez.<eos> Anahita?<eos> That's an Arabic name.<eos> Yeah, her mom's Lebanese, but she's Colombian.<eos> And you know this how?<eos> She's a famous telenovela actress.<eos> You watch telenovelas?<eos> No, no, but my tia does.
Well, what was your relationship?<eos> We were acquaintances.<eos> You see, I adore telenovelas, much to the disapproval of my father.<eos> The passion, the drama.<eos> Ana had such talent.<eos> She and I met at social functions from time to time.<eos> Like at the opera?<eos> The opera?<eos> Yeah, I gather that the two of you met at the opera last night.<eos> I did no such thing.
I didn't have anywhere else to go.<eos> No where else but my car?<eos> Do you know how big the planet is?<eos> What is going on, Britta?<eos> My friends, they all think my parents are adorable, and they think that I'm the bad guy for hating them, but I have a right to hate them, cuz I had to be there when they sucked.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Jimmy Fallon syndrome.<eos> I get it.<eos> I had that with my parents, too.<eos> You did? Yeah.
We gave a degree to a dog.<eos> Allegedly, this conversation is privileged.<eos> I could do a Banksy style stencil of a dog, and spray paint it all over a school.<eos> That sounds great!<eos> But first, why don't you go get a bunch of coffee, drink all of it, then go get some more and bring it back here.<eos> I actually love that idea.<eos> - Mm-hm. - I'll go with her.<eos> She's wearing my pants.<eos> I know this is crazy, but I'm gonna check the school records to see if, you know, we gave a degree to a dog.<eos> - We didn't.
Girls.<eos> As a prison warden, I know all too well how rare stories of true rehabilitation can be.<eos> But this Dean and this prisoner stand here together today to prove that the dream is real.<eos> I'm here for the ceremony.<eos> Last name?<eos> Geller, prisoner ID 042098.<eos> Okay, go on.<eos> Hi, I'm here for the cere... Have a nice night sir.<eos> Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?<eos> I do.

Have a nice night sir.<eos> Dean Craig Pelton, do you accept responsibility for any damage incurred by hiring a felon?<eos> I do.<eos> Willy Seibert Smith, do you accept that the 13th amendment abolished slavery for everyone but convicts, and that we have no choice but to pay you $0.13 per hour or less.<eos> I do.
In public, yes.<eos> We like things most people like.<eos> Our job isn't to alienate people.<eos> We're on the job with my parents?<eos> With everyone, everywhere, all the time.<eos> You wanted a relationship.<eos> A real one.<eos> It's real.<eos> Do you not think, Honda makes good products?<eos> Of course, I do.
Yes.<eos> Ben?<eos> Yep.<eos> So, I guess we're good for today.<eos> Great job, you were right.<eos> We got everything we need.<eos> And, there's a small door in the back, back of the booth there, that will take you, you know, outside.<eos> And, we'll talk soon.<eos> I don't go the way I came?<eos> You do not.
I love making sandwiches with you.<eos> I love folding towels with you.<eos> I love giving you your pain killers, at the end of the day.<eos> Aw. Well that, those aren't really vows.<eos> That's a list of things you love about me, yeah.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> It's okay. Garrett, do you take Stacy to be your lawfully wedded wife.<eos> I do.<eos> Stacy, do you take Garrett to be your lawfully wedded husband, to have and to hold and to honor.<eos> Yes I do.
None of this would have happened if I wasn't always trying to help.<eos> Actually, none of this would have happened if I hadn't tried helping you with your helpfulness.<eos> Oh, don't torture yourself with that logic.<eos> None of us would have met if Hitler hadn't been born.<eos> Also none of Britta's arguments would have a default analogy.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> He's saying you go to the Hitler well a lot.<eos> What are you, Hitler, Hitler?<eos> Okay, Britta, we're all the worst right now, take a day off.<eos> I did.
In the meantime, Ralph's being released back to you.<eos> Thank God.<eos> But he's my responsibility, so you need to stay close to me in case Eckherd wants him to come back in.<eos> Cabe, let me talk to them and clear this up.<eos> They're being extremely aggressive.<eos> The safe house Intel in the game was stolen in a hack of the CIA mainframe three weeks ago.<eos> Details from six other unknown operations and safe houses were taken.<eos> Ralph had nothing to do with hacking the CIA.<eos> I know.<eos> But they don't.
Son, just tell us what you talked about, that's all.<eos> I just said the level one entry into the abandoned warehouse was too easy to find.<eos> There should be a hidden entrance.<eos> And he responded to you?<eos> He said, "Okay"" And then what happened?<eos> He changed the game.<eos> I assume it's bad he was talking to the game designer?<eos> Ralph made a suggestion that helped modify the game.<eos> Do you know how that's gonna look to Eckherd when he finds out?<eos> Ralph did nothing wrong.
Eli, he's asking that you hold the press conference for 20 minutes.<eos> Franny, this is not a press conference.<eos> This is an urgent need to stop a riot.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> No one's rioting.<eos> - You're trying to take advantage...<eos> - Seriously.<eos> The governor is stepping in for an absentee mayor in the city's time of need.<eos> You don't want to make an enemy.<eos> No, you don't.
Take off and...<eos> Yeah.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Why not?<eos> We're having fun.<eos> Yeah. Hey, you know what, I had such a great time last night.<eos> Oh, God. I'm so embarrassed.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I-I don't remember you saying anything you should be embarrassed about.<eos> No, I did.
It stands for "good old raisins and peanuts."<eos> Some people call it "gorp," but that's incorrect, because they're forgetting about the "and."<eos> It's not a sexy food.<eos> It's just for energy.<eos> Great.<eos> Well, you smell clean.<eos> I suppose you washed your genitals real nice for her?<eos> - Carol, come on.<eos> - Phil.<eos> Yes, I did.
Hang on.<eos> Patience!<eos> I got one more.<eos> Now it's time for the real fireworks.<eos> And it's gonna be all finale.<eos> Phil, did you shave your chest?<eos> Sure did.<eos> Did you shave yours?<eos> JK. No.<eos> But I did.
Slipped a little "we" in there, didn't you?<eos> Did I?<eos> Yeah, you did.<eos> Come on.<eos> The jig is up.<eos> What happened?<eos> What happened?<eos> I don't know...<eos> I don't know what you're talking about, Phil.<eos> I don't.
Uh, I can get you yogurt, cheese.<eos> Pretty much anything dairy is at our disposal now.<eos> Todd, you're the best!<eos> I'm gonna start calling you the milkman, milkman.<eos> Carol.<eos> With all due respect to the milkman here, who definitely deserves all this praise for basically just standing around, I found this thing, so it'll be my call what happens with it.<eos> Okay, Todd?<eos> No, no, no, no, no.<eos> Phil, just because you found the cow doesn't give you the right to decide what we do with it.<eos> Uh, yes, it does.
Well, I'm sure she prefers my foyer, but, uh, you know, it's been a really big day.<eos> Maybe just tonight we'll, uh, let her stay here.<eos> Sure.<eos> Okay, well, let's get you tied up.<eos> My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.
Sure.<eos> Okay, well, let's get you tied up.<eos> My uncle taught me this knot.<eos> It's called a clove hitch.<eos> Yeah, the old clove hitch.<eos> Know it well.<eos> - Oh, you do?<eos> - Everyone does.<eos> Anybody want to learn how to milk a cow?<eos> - Yes! I do!
Okay?<eos> You massage the teat, and then you gently tug on it.<eos> Did you really learn that on your uncle's farm or during your summers working as a male prostitute?<eos> That's a good one, Phil.<eos> Yeah, it is a risqué motion, but it gets the job done.<eos> - Milk!<eos> - We have milk!<eos> Oh, my gosh!<eos> Anybody want a sip?<eos> - Yeah, I do!
You took her!<eos> Focus on his hand, Bruce.<eos> Focus-- allow your memories of that day to return.<eos> You're in the hospital, you're getting prepped for surgery...<eos> Then a hand reached down and took that case.<eos> It was Khara.<eos> You saw him.<eos> What happens now?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Uh, y-yes, you do.
Baby, you're the strongest woman I ever known.<eos> I love you.<eos> I love you!<eos> I love you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> Go!<eos> Go!<eos> Come on!<eos> Drop the knife!<eos> Do it!
As soon as this is over, you can ask me anything, I promise.<eos> OK.<eos> Hey!<eos> I think I found Strauss' go-between.<eos> She's a paralegal on his defense team named Juliana Barnes.<eos> She visited him in jail more often than anybody else, frequently alone, and she recently paid off<eos> 100 grand in debt.<eos> We got to talk to her.<eos> Do you like ironing?<eos> Most people don't.
News travels fast in the Russian community.<eos> If we bust this place, Zhulov will never be back.<eos> If they're making his passport, then they'll have his picture.<eos> If we can get eyes inside, we can confirm he's coming back.<eos> Are you saying we walk right in with a bunch of Russian counterfeiters in the back?<eos> No.<eos> I'm saying we don't have to.<eos> So we had to pick one of the Greek philosophers...<eos> Classical or pre-Socratic?<eos> Um... I did Aristotle.
What?<eos> Oh, yeah, it was about a year or so after Alistair was killed.<eos> It was probably the same beast.<eos> Does... does she know...?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes.<eos> But I don't think Heather fully grasps the unique...<eos> Reynolds family connection, if you know what I mean.<eos> He's right.<eos> I don't.
And I appreciate that, Detective, but, still, this doesn't add up.<eos> What could possibly be the connection?<eos> Well, that's the million dollar question, right?<eos> Yep.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> We'll be in touch.<eos> Well, that was fun.<eos> Thank God you covered.<eos> I didn't have much of a choice.<eos> Actually, you did.
Your father.<eos> In prison?<eos> Yeah.<eos> He had some pretty interesting things to say about you.<eos> And about Rebecca.<eos> Did Vincent put you up to this?<eos> No.<eos> JT did, actually.<eos> He cares about you, too, Cat.<eos> Everybody does.
I'll have what he's having.<eos> Sure thing.<eos> So?<eos> So... what?<eos> Doesn't matter.<eos> It's not your problem anymore, okay?<eos> Oh, right. 'Cause the only reason I listened to you before we broke up was for sex.<eos> Hey. Keep your voice down, will you?<eos> I thought I was cured.<eos> I really did.
I do.<eos> You're not still thinking about blowing up the subway tunnel entrance?<eos> Have your fun, and I'll have mine.<eos> We need the truck to get back.<eos> All right, well, with these patrols out, it's easier for me on foot.<eos> - I know every shortcut in town.<eos> - You're actually going through with this?<eos> You're gonna blow up a New York City subway station?<eos> I thought you liked architecture.<eos> I do, Doc.
I know he's important to you, but I can't stand that man.<eos> I need him.<eos> Doesn't mean I like him.<eos> Have you noticed he smells funny?<eos> - Like rotten fish?<eos> - Let's not talk about him.<eos> You said he does things for you.<eos> What sort of things?<eos> - You don't need to know.<eos> - Yes, I do.
What is it you're after?<eos> - You.<eos> - Now it's a proper duel, complete with seconds.<eos> What a team you two make.<eos> United and crippled by lifelong hatred.<eos> This human embarrassed you.<eos> Now I'm about to destroy you.<eos> On the contrary.<eos> I'll make you scream out in agony.<eos> As I did your mother.
Nora told me about last night.<eos> That must have been<eos> - really scary.<eos> - I think I saw Mom.<eos> - Was it Mom?<eos> - I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.
- I don't know.<eos> I wasn't there.<eos> Nora saw her.<eos> - Tell him, Nora.<eos> - I already did.<eos> Well, I do know that your mother loved you very much.<eos> And sometimes, when people turn, that bonding instinct can become a source of attraction.<eos> Yeah, the "dear one"...<eos> Mr. Setrakian already told me about it.<eos> He did?
That was the Master.<eos> I am his partner.<eos> The Master?<eos> There is so much to tell you.<eos> I hated lying to you.<eos> But now you have experienced<eos> - His power for yourself.<eos> - What are you talking about?<eos> Coco, I helped Him because I wanted Him to save my life.<eos> And He did.
I can't take him to his grandparents.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - Because running is not the solution.<eos> We just need to rethink this.<eos> The bioweapon works.<eos> We need a new plan to scale it up.<eos> Yeah, but where does that leave Zack?<eos> We can't just park him at home while we're out fighting.<eos> You had no other options for Zack.<eos> Now you do.
Remember Michelle?<eos> Michelle from hell.<eos> And Stephanie?<eos> Is she the one who did DNA tests on the hairs she found on his jacket?<eos> Well, now he's got Sylvia.<eos> Just goes to show, you only have to choose well once.<eos> Hey.<eos> What's wrong?<eos> Kelly filed for divorce yesterday.<eos> Oh, she actually did it?
What's going on?<eos> Let's make a deal.<eos> Anything you say will stay between us, OK?<eos> Won't you tell me?<eos> I think I have AIDS.<eos> Come on, Félix.<eos> That's impossible.<eos> You don't just get it like...<eos> Why do you think...<eos> Did anyone...
That's impossible.<eos> You don't just get it like...<eos> Why do you think...<eos> Did anyone...<eos> I dunno, an adult... do something to you that makes you think that?<eos> No.<eos> So there's no reason to think you have AIDS.<eos> Even if I don't have it,<eos> I deserve to.<eos> I did horrible things.
Did anyone...<eos> I dunno, an adult... do something to you that makes you think that?<eos> No.<eos> So there's no reason to think you have AIDS.<eos> Even if I don't have it,<eos> I deserve to.<eos> I did horrible things.<eos> Come on, horrible things?<eos> What do you mean?<eos> What did you do?
How is he?<eos> Who'll make the announcement?<eos> Mr Davenport-Scott, of course. No!<eos> Oh, dear!<eos> You, then, Norman.<eos> Me, Sir?<eos> Do not argue, I've given my orders,<eos> I have enough to contend with.<eos> Sir, I'm not equipped.<eos> Do it!
Do you know what this means?<eos> When Josh found out that I was the one that spent all those weeks recreating his special childhood blanket, he realized I was the one that knows his heart, which means I'm the reason he called off the wedding! Now what am I gonna do?<eos> What do you mean what are you gonna do?<eos> Sofia, last night I was freaking out that Josh was getting married because I had feelings for him.<eos> Yeah, and then Cooper came in and swept you off your feet, and now you're back together with Cooper.<eos> I know, I know.<eos> But then Josh, he called off his wedding because of me!<eos> Which means he has feelings for me!<eos> For me!<eos> Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no, no. No, it doesn't.
Do you hear yourself?<eos> I do.<eos> What is happening? You know?<eos> - What is happening?<eos> - Okay.<eos> Okay.<eos> Look, I know you're confused.<eos> You had feelings for Josh.<eos> And if Josh had come here last night declaring his love for you, it would be a different story.<eos> But he didn't.

I am one popcorn shrimp away from blowing a button and killing the man.<eos> I still don't know how you got a date with the world's sexiest window washer.<eos> We have a connection.<eos> We were able to communicate with just our hands.<eos> Oh, that's cute, window man.<eos> But, let's talk with our voices now.<eos> We can talk with our hands later.<eos> You know I'm deaf, right?<eos> No.<eos> No, I did not.
At least you're not in platforms.<eos> Is the pain getting worse?<eos> Yes.<eos> Aren't there any more tests you can run?<eos> We've run all the tests.<eos> You're a conundrum here.<eos> Oh. Okay.<eos> Well, I'm gonna take that as a compliment.<eos> As long as it doesn't mean "slut."<eos> It doesn't.
The hope is, with planes, pilots, scientists, and doctors, we can get the labs in America and possibly even overseas up and running and getting real distribution of the cure.<eos> Also be sending out six land teams with a twofold mission... find survivors in the general population and find our families.<eos> Those with loved ones in Norfolk will be assigned to the sectors corresponding to their neighborhoods.<eos> For those who live elsewhere in the country, we can only promise your time will come soon enough.<eos> That's a S.E.A.L.<eos> Signal back.<eos> I see more S.E.A.L.s.<eos> You make out any pilots?<eos> Yes.<eos> Yes, I do.
What the hell is going on, Sean?<eos> Everyone's dead but us.<eos> We lost the captain.<eos> We're all alone.<eos> There's no answer from the base at faslane.<eos> How we gonna get home?<eos> Sean!<eos> We'll get home, bruv.<eos> How do you know?<eos> Because I do.
Hear about the builders?<eos> I try not to.<eos> One died right in front of us, the others downing their tools.<eos> Now my good friend Pascal De St Martin is here, but has no rooms.<eos> If I were him, I'd go home.<eos> If you were him, you'd be taller and more handsome.<eos> Well, I fancy some air.<eos> Join me?<eos> Thought you hated the outdoors.<eos> I do, but not today.
Decent lodging.<eos> Fair pay and compensation as befits the soldiers of the King.<eos> Why should I plead on your behalf?<eos> You could count on our support.<eos> In the event of a change in circumstances.<eos> I don't understand you.<eos> What change?<eos> If your brother were no longer King.<eos> Do you realize I could have you hanged for talking like this?<eos> I do.
How lovely.<eos> I thought they were for you.<eos> Who are they from?<eos> I have no idea.<eos> Mariette?<eos> Where's the bloody girl.<eos> Mariette!<eos> We cannot continue together.<eos> I understand.<eos> - Do you?
Make a list by midnight.<eos> We should have fought him harder.<eos> - You mean I should have.<eos> - No!<eos> No, I mean...<eos> With what leverage, Katya?<eos> We don't have any.<eos> Do you want to talk more about what I said to Alex?<eos> - About the affair?<eos> - No, I don't.
If Alex beats you to that laptop, you'll all be dead.<eos> All of us will be.<eos> We go at 6 A.M.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'll be back as soon as it arrives.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> I need a cigarette.<eos> Come on.<eos> Since when did you start smoking, Dr. O'Connor?<eos> I didn't.
- Ma. - Christina, go and get my purse for me.<eos> Dana: We're gonna make a few marks on your neck.<eos> Get me my hand cream.<eos> My other daughter...<eos> the one who's not here... she's got a kid, too.<eos> I told her to find a flight of stairs to fall down.<eos> Try not to move, please.<eos> [monitors beeping] Okay, so, after Dr. Kinney makes the incision, I will go in and remove the thyroid tumor, all right?<eos> She didn't listen, either.<eos> They never do, just like their father.
!<eos> Malory, the whole thing about<eos> Me using his "goop" was your idea!<eos> Prove it. [huge gasp]<eos> So now let's talk about this name, abbiejean.<eos> Don't you think she'd be better off if she were a...<eos> Malory?<eos> [archer] thoughts?<eos> You do not want to know my thoughts.<eos> I do, ken.

Ha!<eos> Because you also need my help.<eos> Only because you just broke two of my ribs,<eos> In addition to impaling me on a bamboo stake,<eos> On which, I think we both know, you smeared some poop!<eos> I-- and if you did I don't wanna know!<eos> [grunting] because...<eos> You'd have no idea what<eos> You're supposed to be looking for!<eos> Not that I do, necessarily, but--
What, is this gonna be your "I'm sorry I was never there for you because I never knew you existed blah blah blah" speech?<eos> This is, you know, gonna be my<eos> "I'm sorry I wasn't there for you 'cause I never knew you existed because I didn't stay in touch with your mother and I feel bad about that."<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It's okay.<eos> Really?<eos> I forgive you.<eos> You do.
Really, guys?<eos> Can we not just put the past where it belongs?<eos> It was a quarter of a century ago.<eos> - Of course we can, John.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> But we're still gonna need a code word for your daughter's pussy.<eos> Muff.<eos> Muff is not a code word, asshole.<eos> - They know what that means.<eos> - No, they do not.

Andrew, it was a pleasure, as always.<eos> Governor, be well.<eos> Evening.<eos> Come on in, Ray.<eos> How was the drive from San Diego?<eos> You got what I came for?<eos> Oh, straight to the point, I like that.<eos> She doesn't often ask for my help, so you must have scared her half to death.<eos> Trust me, she deserved it.<eos> Maybe she did.
Come with me.<eos> Candace, put Ray at the end of the hall, please.<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Oh, look who's here.<eos> Ray Donovan.<eos> Where's Father?<eos> He said to push the meeting with Mr. Liu.<eos> - Why?<eos> - I don't know, Paige.<eos> The fuck you don't.
Fuck you, you fucking alcoholic, huh?<eos> You've been sitting in the bar for hours getting shitfaced... - Oh, fuck you!<eos> - ...and I'm an alcoholic?<eos> Dave, enough!<eos> Come on.<eos> Let's get you home.<eos> I'm looking for Tina Harvey.<eos> Drunk bitch headquarters, right there.<eos> So I hear you don't feel like performing today.<eos> No, I don't.
Good lumbar support.<eos> The intern brings in lunch every day.<eos> Lee pops a blood vessel every ten minutes.<eos> What's not to like?<eos> What if I want you back?<eos> You're a piece of work.<eos> You let the business go to shit, - you're punishing Avi.<eos> - Can't blame me for that.<eos> Yeah, well, you didn't have to punish me.<eos> No, I didn't.
Okay, Ray.<eos> In hindsight, my marriage was good for everyone.<eos> My dad got to be around Varick, and I got my dad's attention.<eos> Drink?<eos> You called about the deal, said you figured it out.<eos> I lied.<eos> - I got to go.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't know many men like you.<eos> Sure you do.
Don't let him leave.<eos> I'm on my way.<eos> That's good.<eos> What should we do with him?<eos> We have some unfinished business.<eos> No, we don't.<eos> I need to show you something outside.<eos> You said your piece yesterday.<eos> We got nothing more to talk about.<eos> We do.
Bunch, you're always gonna be my kid brother, but that doesn't mean I'm always gonna be right.<eos> I realize now how much Teresa cares about you, how strong she is.<eos> She's a fighter, Bunch, and I think everybody here can vouch for that.<eos> It just feels right looking at the two of you together because I know you're gonna protect each other.<eos> To your happiness.<eos> Yeah, go for it.<eos> I knew it!<eos> You all right?<eos> I didn't know you remembered that stuff.<eos> Of course I do.
Hasmig, how are you?<eos> Full house, huh?<eos> Mm.<eos> Yours is the only face I want to see.<eos> This is Lena.<eos> You guys spoke on the phone about the Minassian thing.<eos> Yes, and um... I'm gonna have to say no.<eos> My father's in a tight spot, Hasmig.<eos> And what makes you believe I know that family?<eos> I didn't.
I've been studying really hard.<eos> - So hard.<eos> - Check your mistakes.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> "Mm, Greg, help me with my proofs."<eos> Shut up.<eos> "Higher order derivatives make me so fucking wet."<eos> Shut the fuck up.<eos> You don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Sure I do.
I took a dick pic.<eos> What?<eos> This Cochran, he's a sexual pervert.<eos> I took a picture of my dick on his computer.<eos> We send it to his coworkers, he loses his job.<eos> You took a dick pic?<eos> It'll come in handy, believe me.<eos> All right.<eos> Not how I imagined it.<eos> - Okay, I do it for the team.
That's on me.<eos> Let me out of here, Ray.<eos> Ray!<eos> Ray!<eos> I'll take good care of the business, you know.<eos> Of course you will, when the time comes.<eos> Never doubted that.<eos> You've been a great mentor.<eos> Well, I've made mistakes.<eos> Everybody does.
Just make up your mind!<eos> I did not kill Annika!<eos> I don't think that you killed anyone, Norman.<eos> Don't lie to me!<eos> Norman, answer me right now!<eos> Annika?<eos> Are you okay?<eos> Oh... oh, God.<eos> Use it.<eos> Do something with it.
We're late.<eos> I love being here with you.<eos> Let's just stay here forever, and I could write one book after another, get rich, buy Robert and Yvonne's house right out from under them.<eos> And what will I be doing while you're busy writing?<eos> You'd be my muse.<eos> You know you can trust me, right?<eos> Yeah, of course.<eos> You know, you can... you can tell me whatever you want.<eos> You don't have to hide anything.<eos> I don't.
I can't follow you today.<eos> What does that mean?<eos> Well, one minute you're giving Yvonne some romance novel version of how we met, and now you're spouting fucking Hegel on the deck.<eos> Did something happen while I was gone?<eos> Something you haven't told me?<eos> A lot of things happen that I don't tell you.<eos> Do you really want to know things about me?<eos> Things I've never told anyone else before?<eos> Yes.<eos> No, you don't.
I'm doing everything I can to create a situation where you can live with me, at least part of the time.<eos> But in order for us to do that, to find a way...<eos> She can't know you're engaged to Alison.<eos> She can't know I'm living with Alison.<eos> Don't worry, Dad. I got you.<eos> Hey.<eos> - Noah Solloway.<eos> - How are you, man?<eos> Oh, I thought we'd lost you, brother.<eos> Nearly did.
- Better than I have in years.<eos> - Good.<eos> Just need to figure out a way to afford an apartment, so I can get co-custody of the kids and...<eos> How's the book coming?<eos> I heard you got a big advance.<eos> No, it's good.<eos> I...<eos> They only give you like 20% up front.<eos> They keep the rest until you turn in the book, so...<eos> You almost done?
Fuck you, friend.<eos> - Forget I asked.<eos> - Wait, Whitney, I'm sorry.<eos> I ju...<eos> I-I don't get why you want to get in touch with Scotty after everything that happened.<eos> Because I love him.<eos> Like you love my father, right?<eos> - It's...<eos> - Well...<eos> Well, don't you?
Uh, no.<eos> No.<eos> Um... he died of something called secondary drowning.<eos> It's very rare.<eos> Children go swimming, and they... accidentally swallow too much water.<eos> - And then later... - Oh.<eos> I didn't know how sick he was, and I didn't take him to the hospital.<eos> He died in his sleep.<eos> And so you carry that with you.<eos> Yeah, I do.
- Can we talk? - Exhale.<eos> Outside.<eos> Can we talk now?<eos> - Please. Come on.<eos> - Noah.<eos> What's wrong with you?<eos> What is wrong with you?<eos> I spent the last six weeks doing everything I promised so that we could be together, which is what I thought you wanted too.<eos> - Do you want that?<eos> - Yes, of course I do.
Go.<eos> Oh, this one's harder than the last one.<eos> I know, I know. Keep going.<eos> Mm. How did you and Yvonne meet?<eos> She was my wife's friend.<eos> - Oh.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> It caused something of a scandal, to put it mildly.<eos> What... did you have an affair?<eos> We did.
I'm a motherfucker, huh?<eos> No.<eos> My... my work clothes are on the boat.<eos> Fuck...<eos> You want me to go get it for you?<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you.<eos> She wants her stuff.<eos> Seriously, do you know her?<eos> I do not.
What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Does everyone just think I'm...<eos> I'm a slut?<eos> I don't know what everyone thinks.<eos> Do you?<eos> No, of course I don't.<eos> I think there's something wrong with me.<eos> You got to stop saying that.<eos> People don't see me, Cole.<eos> They don't.
- Whitney.<eos> - Take it down?<eos> - Yes, take it down.<eos> - Take it down please.<eos> - No.<eos> Mom, I'm trying to help you, okay?<eos> Because don't you think it's a little bit messed up that you've been walking around campus all day, like, showing me all the places that you and Dad did stuff?<eos> It's not like you have all the time in the world to get over him.<eos> Do you know what I mean?<eos> No, I don't.
Sit down.<eos> Stop with the asshole routine.<eos> He fucking misquoted my book, like, three times in print.<eos> - He's an undergrad.<eos> - So what?<eos> He needs to take responsibility for what he puts in his fucking paper.<eos> Oh, my God, stop being this guy.<eos> You are not this guy.<eos> I don't know what you're talking about.<eos> Yeah, you do.
He wouldn't accept the book until I changed it.<eos> Alison.<eos> Look, it's fiction, of course it is.<eos> Eden's just trying to help it sell, but...<eos> I mean, if that makes you uncomfortable, then I won't say anything about my real life in interviews. I'll cancel the whole book tour if that makes you happy.<eos> No, I didn't say that.<eos> I just...<eos> I just...<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
You're really late.<eos> My fault. Totally my fault.<eos> Ah, Eden.<eos> Where's the turkey?<eos> Shit, I knew we forgot something.<eos> - I'll go get it right now.<eos> - No, it's closed.<eos> Noah, do you want to listen to your baby's heartbeat?<eos> Do you even want this baby?<eos> Of course I do.
I'm okay.<eos> Well, your mom says you're doing a lot better.<eos> Yeah, I guess so.<eos> Any more stomachaches?<eos> Yeah, if I eat something that I shouldn't.<eos> Bitch of a disease, isn't it?<eos> Yeah, it is.<eos> Well, did your GI recommend Humira injections?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Uh, he did.
You know, actually, if I could put in my two cents,<eos> I've been giving a lot of thought to, uh, the role of Alison.<eos> What do you call her in the book, again?<eos> The, uh, whatever.<eos> Anyway, stick with me here, little outside the box.<eos> As Alison, Sasha Grey.<eos> How hot would that be?<eos> Mm, yes.<eos> You know who she is, right?<eos> No, you don't.
The Minotaur speaks.<eos> The sour, disputatious back-looking voice of a beast locked away in a labyrinth of the past.<eos> The word is progress, Mr. Strobridge.<eos> That steam engine machine is also gonna save me $5 a day.<eos> Times three.<eos> The men that turned that wheel, Colossus, put 'em out of work.<eos> Plenty work to go around.<eos> Reassign them to the tunnel.<eos> Uh-uh. Making me money with one hand and taking it back with the other doesn't win a race.<eos> Neither does a short-handed crew. Mr. Strobridge.
Hey!<eos> Now march, Jake.<eos> Chop, chop.<eos> You think you're better than us?<eos> Yeah, he does, you know.<eos> We'll show him who's better.<eos> Move!<eos> Where's them fancy English words now, Chinaman?<eos> Get them ropes.<eos> Do it!
I come to you heart in hand.<eos> My people, our very way of life depend upon you.<eos> If you'll just speak to the President.<eos> I know he listens to you.<eos> He's his own man.<eos> At the end of the day, he'll call it like he sees it.<eos> Well, perhaps my route has some practical applications that are escaping you at the moment.<eos> Not long ago, I received a telegram from you inquiring about the Hatchites.<eos> I responded that I didn't know their location.<eos> I did. And I do.
And how I almost just killed Adalind.<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Because I was scared.<eos> Look...<eos> We're gonna figure this out, and get rid of it.<eos> We can't.<eos> Why not?<eos> It's permanent.<eos> - You don't know that.<eos> - I do.
Yes.<eos> My father was a school janitor.<eos> Uh, my mother left when I was 5.<eos> I have a younger brother in portland, oregon.<eos> I have a dog, snuffy.<eos> I'm sure it's all in there.<eos> You clerked in the san francisco office. When you graduated high school.<eos> You found it to your liking, I presume?<eos> I loved working for the bureau.<eos> Still do.
I didn't do it.<eos> Venter gave me the bomb, and I never set it.<eos> I never placed it!<eos> I couldn't!<eos> I was afraid!<eos> Where is the bomb?<eos> In my dorm.<eos> It was where he said it would be.<eos> If it had gone off, it would have killed a lot of people.<eos> But it didn't.
_<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _<eos> _ _<eos> _<eos> Some of these caves reach all the way to Jerusalem.<eos> They follow the trail of water that flows all the way to the Temple Mount.<eos> Who else knows about this place?<eos> No one as well as we do.
- Then what is it?<eos> - Oh, give me a break.<eos> What is going to church and singing hymns?<eos> Spending time with my daughter.<eos> - Oh, that's what you call it?<eos> - What do you want me to call it?<eos> I like spending time with her.<eos> Do I want certain things for her?<eos> Yeah.<eos> All parents do.
Niska's waiting for us.<eos> Let's take care of you first.<eos> Number seven, disinfect.<eos> Number seven, next in six minutes.<eos> Why don't you do that...<eos> There's literally no end!<eos> What we'll do - why don't you do this and we'll take a break?<eos> We've got to get the other wheel back on.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.<eos> You do that...
There's literally no end!<eos> What we'll do - why don't you do this and we'll take a break?<eos> We've got to get the other wheel back on.<eos> Yeah, that's what I'm saying.<eos> You do that...<eos> I'm not doing that, it's your bike!<eos> Dad, you need the exercise, mate.<eos> When was the last time you put that wheel on?<eos> You heard him, Maxie.<eos> They did something to her head.
- Yes.<eos> I could only gain control at random moments.<eos> Can't have been much fun.<eos> No.<eos> But being here...<eos> I understand a lot more about what it means to be a family.<eos> We're not the best example.<eos> Why not?<eos> You love each other.<eos> You do.
It's our last chance to try.<eos> Our last chance to save Max.<eos> What's the point of saving him?<eos> We're never getting out of here.<eos> Leo.<eos> We don't know what will happen.<eos> Neither does Hobb.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Don't you want to find out?<eos> I do.
- Don't kill our family.<eos> Look at Leo, he'll die too.<eos> You were made for him.<eos> He didn't want me.<eos> He does now.<eos> He wants Beatrice.<eos> I'm not her.<eos> No, you're not.<eos> She didn't have a choice.<eos> You do.
I don't want any witnesses.<eos> You're going to cut me, aren't you?<eos> We need to know what we're dealing with.<eos> Sunny, I'm not ready.<eos> The only way I can help you is to face you.<eos> Now focus.<eos> Fight through it.<eos> Don't let it control you.<eos> I could've killed you.<eos> But you didn't.
I had nothing to do with the attack on your transports.<eos> I would never do something so brazen.<eos> Such as lead an unsanctioned raid on another baron's property?<eos> The Widow was trying to kill my son.<eos> - She made it personal. - Personal?<eos> Then why take the oil fields?<eos> For our mutual protection.<eos> I wasn't the one who was so willing to recognize her.<eos> I could see the Widow had no interest in preserving our way of life.<eos> - And you do?
I won't.<eos> The other offer's still on the table if you change your mind.<eos> You know I'm a lot more persuasive when I get what I want.<eos> I'm sorry I wasn't able to get to Angelica in time.<eos> I'm sure you did everything in your power to help her.<eos> You were the last one in the tunnel today.<eos> Yes.<eos> That special book, the one on my desk, you didn't see it, did you?<eos> No, Mother, I'm sorry.<eos> I didn't.
I told you to shut up!<eos> What are you gonna do with her?<eos> Sunny, don't.<eos> Stay put, both of you.<eos> Give me a reason not to do this.<eos> I'm sick, not an invalid.<eos> Veil thought it would be easier on your stomach.<eos> At least until we know how the medicine affects you.<eos> Why, the kitchen make that?<eos> I did.
There's new trains coming every day.<eos> You have information about the case?<eos> My brother does.<eos> Gabriel.<eos> He's a psychic.<eos> There's a thing inside you.<eos> Your cure will come with the number three.<eos> I didn't know where you were.<eos> You knew I'd be back.<eos> No, I didn't.
Look, you know, old job's over.<eos> New job hasn't begun.<eos> You know, I'm just spinning my wheels here.<eos> Hey.<eos> Hey, guys.<eos> So, um... We wanted you to be the first to know.<eos> We're getting married.<eos> Hey!<eos> I told you.<eos> No, you didn't.
Have them rush the DNA tests.<eos> Pull some strings if you have to.<eos> Why the rush?<eos> Still got a lot of media interest.<eos> The bosses want to be able to announce we got the guy.<eos> For that, we need a coroner's report, so let's get on it.<eos> Okay, right away.<eos> Hey, did Abbott give you the news? Hey.<eos> We're having a real wedding at his house.<eos> He did.
Why not?<eos> Because Peterson is ruthless and determined, and he won't stop until he's destroyed both of you.<eos> Now we knew he was gonna make a move like this sooner or later.<eos> Now it is time for us to make our move.<eos> Which is what, exactly?<eos> The hearings are in three days.<eos> Well, I think I can come up with something if...you both want me involved.<eos> No, no, this is -- this is not your problem.<eos> Dennis tells me you have one of the trickiest and most devious minds he's worked with.<eos> He did, did he? Ah.
Is that supposed to be amusing?<eos> Mr. Peterson, this man said that he was from your office.<eos> Is there a problem?<eos> It's fine, Stacey.<eos> Stacey, Mr. Peterson and I go way back.<eos> Thank you.<eos> [ Sighs ]<eos> How was your little trip down to Rio Bravo?<eos> You know about that?<eos> Of course I do.
Okay, I'm sure you got a lot of them.<eos> You're not using her. Not anymore.<eos> You don't have to make such a big deal out of everything like you always did.<eos> It's annoying.<eos> But there's no telling you anything, huh?<eos> You always know best, don't you?<eos> And you... You vilified me for your mother's death for 22 years, and she's the one that chose to leave that way.<eos> No, you drove her to it.<eos> You drove her to it.<eos> - I did no such thing.
♪ Tonight, you belong to me ♪<eos> ♪ Down by the stream ♪<eos> ♪ How sweet it will seem ♪<eos> ♪ Once more a dream in the moonlight ♪<eos> ♪ My honey, I know, I know ♪<eos> ♪ With the dawn I know you will be gone ♪<eos> ♪ But tonight, you belong to me ♪<eos> You brought him into our house?<eos> I didn't.<eos> She did.
Oh, great.<eos> Um, but they are digging it, like, right now, so could you please ask him to call me right away? - I will.<eos> - Okay, thank you.<eos> My apologies.<eos> What are you gonna do to me?<eos> Why am I here?<eos> James, I'm in a bad position and I was hoping you could help me. See, there's...<eos> There's this woman, Norma Bates.<eos> You... you know her, right?<eos> Yeah, I do.
You're just confused.<eos> I-it... it's silly.<eos> Honey, we... we're...<eos> We're just people.<eos> We... we're on some level like animals, instinctual.<eos> You're a man.<eos> I'm a woman, so maybe you notice my breasts once in a while.<eos> Big deal. It's freaking normal.<eos> It doesn't mean you're weird or that there's anything wrong with you.<eos> - It doesn't?
You don't get TV.<eos> Oh.<eos> You're the cop who shot me.<eos> Lieutenant Koto.<eos> I thought I killed you.<eos> I wish you had.<eos> Then why did you wear Kevlar? A shot to the heart would have been too messy.<eos> That's not the way I wanted to go out.<eos> You wanted a head shot.<eos> I still do.
He got a problem with you, he'll just say lights out direct.<eos> I'm-a tell you what you gonna do.<eos> I didn't tell you to think.<eos> I'm-a tell you what you gonna do, all right?<eos> I want you to put two goons on his bumper.<eos> Then you're gonna take a crew out and you're gonna ask everybody you see if they've seen Tenea, you got that?<eos> Right now!<eos> You understand me?<eos> For sure.<eos> What you gonna do?
We will find food, I know it.<eos> Caleb?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> Go to sleep.<eos> What is this?<eos> Tell me, now.<eos> - Running away then?<eos> - No.<eos> - Lie not to me.<eos> - I don't.
It is possible to buy more here.<eos> So why did you call me, not mom?<eos> Mom doesn't pick out my shirts.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> You mean as of tonight when I'm doing it instead?<eos> I don't have great taste.<eos> So what?<eos> I'm just giving you a hard time.<eos> I knew that.<eos> No, you didn't.
Here's what I remember.<eos> I remember the deal that we made with Victor, the deal that you forced me to make, saying we had access to Alex's car, his phone, - his computer...<eos> - We had no other option.<eos> You could have let me turn myself in.<eos> And destroy our family?<eos> That's not a choice you get to make.<eos> We get what the SVR needs, or they go after Alex directly.<eos> What words do you need me to say, Mark?<eos> That I didn't cheat on you?<eos> I didn't.
They don't come naturally to you like they do to mom.<eos> What's that supposed to mean?<eos> Forget it.<eos> You think she had an affair?<eos> I don't know.<eos> It's none of my business.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> Are you uncomfortable?<eos> I don't like vinyl surfaces.<eos> No one does, really.
I don't think he wants to kill us or anyone.<eos> So what does he want then?<eos> I think he wants to defect.<eos> He's with two federal agents.<eos> How are they going to grab him?<eos> Carefully.<eos> _ Use force against U.S. federal agents in their own country?<eos> This is a line Moscow has never crossed.<eos> I don't think you understand the stakes, Victor.<eos> I do.
I couldn't agree more.<eos> I have been getting the other Alec to sign documents that remove him and put me in the big chair.<eos> This will send a signal.<eos> If nobody hears it, nothing happens.<eos> And if someone does hear it?<eos> Then we've failed.<eos> Mr. Sadler is dropping all charges.<eos> Right.<eos> All yours.<eos> You did it.
He'll be out on bail in 24 hours and all of this will be for nothing.<eos> Oh, I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> Is Kellogg the only one you're arresting?<eos> Right on cue.<eos> Special interest number two.<eos> Are you going to arrest Emily?<eos> If I knew where she was.<eos> Now, I could compel you to give me her location or you could just be a good citizen.<eos> Carlos, he doesn't know.<eos> I don't.
Will you call?<eos> Yes.<eos> I think we got everything.<eos> But, you know, if we're missing anything.<eos> Or one of these lazy boys can go to the store.<eos> Okay?<eos> Krisha, it's going to be all right, right?<eos> I'm good.<eos> I'm good. You wanted to do it.<eos> I do.
"I feel pretty big today.<eos> "Let's just get one in real quick. You know what I mean.<eos> "Get one in?" Yeah, get one in.<eos> Ugh!<eos> That is not...<eos> What?<eos> Like... do you know anything about women?<eos> These come up.<eos> These come up.<eos> What does?
It's like a full load trying to finish.<eos> Are you mad at me? Mmm-mmm.<eos> For sure? Mmm-hmm.<eos> Honey, you don't have to study business just because it's what they want you to do, all right?<eos> You're a very talented filmmaker and that's what you should be doing with your life.<eos> You have a gift.<eos> And don't let people tell you what you can and can't do with your gift.<eos> I want us to be closer, Trey.<eos> I want us to have a real relationship.<eos> I do, too.
- to pin this on Frankie.<eos> - I know.<eos> Well, I uid understand if you wanted to stay here.<eos> Up yours, Rizzoli.<eos> I'm ready.<eos> Well, well, well.<eos> Cecil.<eos> Nice to finally meet you.<eos> Spike: I didn't have anything to do with that.<eos> - Then who did?
He went up to Maine to a friend's cabin by a lake to clear his head and work on his long-neglected book of poetry.<eos> But Mark had writer's block.<eos> So, one day, Mark went fishing to take the pressure off and found out he was a natural.<eos> The fish just... came to him.<eos> He entered a tournament and won.<eos> And he won tournament after tournament.<eos> When was the last time you saw your husband?<eos> The first day of the tournament.<eos> Um, I brought him the divorce papers so he could sign them and embrace his new life.<eos> - And did he?
- Allegedly. Uh, y-you had a secret storage compartment in your boat.<eos> I say it was a cooler... for beer.<eos> Do you own a crossbow?<eos> - Of course.<eos> - Don't you?<eos> Listen, I hope that you catch whoever it is that killed this guy.<eos> And I hope you figure out how he cheated.<eos> What makes you think he cheated?<eos> What do you think? Fish just jumping into his boat?<eos> - When you do...
I don't know.<eos> He got a money order for cash.<eos> - Maybe it's some sort of payoff.<eos> - The same day he was killed?<eos> The same day Jay Butler disappeared.<eos> Did you know that because of all the pollution, the bass are changing sexes,<eos> - with the males carrying the eggs? - Oh.<eos> It's about time.<eos> - You did not know that.<eos> - Yes, I did.
Tell me how he cheated.<eos> - I-I don't know.<eos> But he won more than any of us, a-and he didn't know a damn thing about bass fishing.<eos> Well, he knew enough to win.<eos> Look, Rosie Ruiz won the Boston marathon.<eos> Lance Armstrong won the Tour de France.<eos> Fishing is a cruel mistress.<eos> Nobody wins all the time.<eos> [Scoffs] God.<eos> Mark Harris did.
Well... even if she was guilty, Susie was smart.<eos> She wouldn't want a criminal to know where she lived.<eos> I mean, she had to have been followed from somewhere.<eos> But there was no sign of forced entry.<eos> A-And she never would've let someone in she didn't trust.<eos> No.<eos> And there was no record of a call to set up a meeting.<eos> Well, unless she had a burner and they took that, too.<eos> Janie, I-I don't want to believe that she was crooked.<eos> Nobody does.
♪ If you really want to know ♪ Angela: Poor thing.<eos> This is unbelievable.<eos> It's just terrible.<eos> Jane, come on.<eos> You can clear this up.<eos> You know Susie didn't do those things.<eos> It's complicated, Ma.<eos> You worked right next to her every day.<eos> Don't you think you would've known?<eos> - I do.
- Smug bastard.<eos> Turn off the cameras and give me 10 minutes alone with him,<eos> - he'll be shaken up.<eos> - [sighs] We'll get him.<eos> We don't have enough to put him away, and he knows it.<eos> Nina's still digging.<eos> She found an offshore account in his name.<eos> It's got 100 grand in it.<eos> You think he was paid to steal the painting?<eos> I do.
You move, you die.<eos> Please.<eos> I'm ... I'm just a kid.<eos> So was Sheila MacIntyre.<eos> Yes. Thank you.<eos> Mrs. Lewis was right.<eos> Sheila MacIntyre was familiar.<eos> She was a patient of another doctor in Foley's medical suite with a Thursday appointment.<eos> - How did we miss that?<eos> - We didn't.
I had...<eos> I had no idea.<eos> You went off to boarding school.<eos> I was out of the country.<eos> So you thought things would get better because we were<eos> - on different continents?<eos> - Of course not.<eos> So how exactly was that supposed to help?<eos> I thought things would get easier with time.<eos> They didn't.
Well... I love that you can't tell a lie.<eos> - But you think I'm a coward.<eos> - What? No. Why?<eos> Because I'm avoiding him, not confronting him about it.<eos> Maura, I live in a 2x3 room in order to avoid living with my mother.<eos> You were a child, and he put you in a terrible position.<eos> But it was so long ago.<eos> You want me to shoot him?<eos> - I do.<eos> I really do.
- Right?<eos> - Look at that face. - Aww.<eos> Hey, you know what?<eos> I wonder if whoever tried to kill him knows that he's still alive.<eos> When is his competition that he's supposed to be in?<eos> Every day this weekend at the Convention Center.<eos> And all three of Duke's rivals are gonna be there.<eos> We slip backstage using Duke and catch them off guard in their own turf?<eos> - Mm-hmm. - Hey. Want to go undercover?<eos> Yes, he does.
- How?<eos> - Police say someone put it in her coffee.<eos> Quiet, boy.<eos> - Ah, sounds like Duke is missing Mona.<eos> - Sounds like you're missing Duke.<eos> - I really liked that big guy.<eos> - Well, maybe it's time to get one like him.<eos> Oh, Kiki got ruled by a Rottweiler when she was a little kid.<eos> She doesn't like big dogs.<eos> - Yeah, but you do.
I was insulting him.<eos> You know, flirting.<eos> Think he's mad?<eos> I bet he's heartbroken.<eos> No, no.<eos> We can fix this.<eos> We just have to write a very sweet, very heartfelt text that will jump-start the conversation.<eos> "Hey, baby."<eos> I don't call people "baby."<eos> You do now.
He was supposed to get me the money by this morning.<eos> All right.<eos> - And?<eos> - And he didn't get it... and he didn't get back to me.<eos> I texted him like a hundred times.<eos> All right, well.<eos> This is his problem too.<eos> You understand that, right? Do you?<eos> Do you understand that?<eos> Yeah, I do, but...
- Okay.<eos> You take your stained books and get out of my café.<eos> - I don't want them.<eos> - Fuck you! I don't want you to have them.<eos> Take your 60 bucks, shove it up your ass!<eos> Could I just have the hot sauce?<eos> Give me that sack.<eos> Give me that goddamned sack!<eos> Why are you acting like the last four months didn't mean anything?<eos> - Because they didn't.
I've written more in the last four months than I wrote in the five years before that.<eos> That's what good sex will do for you.<eos> Anyway, that's over.<eos> So how do I look?<eos> What about the side from here, how does that look?<eos> - What?<eos> - Never mind.<eos> - Grandma, do you have any more ideas?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Afraid I do.
I just boiled some corn.<eos> - Corn. Okay.<eos> - Come on.<eos> - Sage, you sure you don't want a piece?<eos> - Oh, no, thank you.<eos> I have a bit of an upset stomach. So...<eos> - Listen, who are these people?<eos> - My grandkids.<eos> So you've got grandkids now?<eos> I do.
You take her home.<eos> She needs to get home.<eos> I'm gonna call a cab.<eos> - I should probably thank you.<eos> - Knock yourself out.<eos> She's right, you know.<eos> I'm angry.<eos> I am really angry.<eos> I'm a big bully, and I don't know where it comes from.<eos> You don't?
- I feel like it's swelling...<eos> - I've had ice. I really have.<eos> And I think it's done what it can do.<eos> I'm gonna give you your privacy.<eos> I have a cab waiting outside.<eos> It's so intrusive.<eos> I just came to give you these.<eos> - They're first editions.<eos> - I know what they are.<eos> Yeah, of course you do.
Kaede...<eos> Hey, about that book...<eos> There are limits to what I can teach.<eos> I'm sure there are even better teachers.<eos> Ren-kun, would you like to go to university?<eos> That's...<eos> I'll help you with the entrance exams!<eos> But me going to university...<eos> Don't you want to know more about the things you don't know?<eos> I do.
Yeah, I know.<eos> - I remember.<eos> - You were there?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Oh no!<eos> - Damn, damn.<eos> - Excuse me a minute.<eos> What is it?<eos> - I think I forgot my blood-pressure medicine.<eos> - No, you didn't.
That's for the wi-fi.<eos> That's for your kid.<eos> I'm a dad, too.<eos> Now beat it.<eos> Don't ask me to be sorry.<eos> You have to hear what I have to say, and if you still feel the same afterwards, then... fine.<eos> I love you so much for your concern...<eos> But there's nothing we can do about this.<eos> You don't know that.<eos> I do.
- Yeah, 'cause the guy at Ben Jerry's gave us a billion free samples.<eos> - Said it was all going to melt anyway. - (Laughs)<eos> I guess I will see you tomorrow, partner.<eos> Don't be a stranger.<eos> I won't.<eos> Come on.<eos> You like her, don't you, dad?<eos> Yeah, I do.<eos> I like it here, and I don't want to leave this time.<eos> Neither do I, buddy.
It wasn't, right?<eos> I mean, 'cause part of it just showed up at a murder scene.<eos> Want to tell me how that might have happened?<eos> The body, Lucas Reem, was stolen.<eos> It was on my prep table.<eos> I had the door open to let the night air freshen my work space.<eos> I went to take a phone call.<eos> When I returned, he was gone.<eos> Did you report that to the police?<eos> No, I did not.
I kept it because I did intend to call the police.<eos> Do you still have that bottle?<eos> Got your message.<eos> What's up?<eos> The print on the bourbon bottle is a match to a local named Todd Spanna.<eos> This is his Web site.<eos> "The man who brought down Lucas Reem."<eos> Well, that line may work at a last call hookup, but I'm afraid the truth is not quite so heroic.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> I do.
Well, that line may work at a last call hookup, but I'm afraid the truth is not quite so heroic.<eos> You know this guy?<eos> I do.<eos> He's all over the case files.<eos> Todd Spanna had an apartment across from Lucas Reem.<eos> One night, he sees Reem hosing blood off his hands, so he calls the cops, turns him in, ends Lucas Reem's run.<eos> Well, it looks like he's turned that into a little celebrity for himself.<eos> Did a couple of talk shows.<eos> I think he even wrote a book?<eos> Yes, he did.
But what you did is nothing in the grand scheme.<eos> There are far worse crimes that must be answered for.<eos> Careful, darling.<eos> She's thick as thieves with those heroes.<eos> Not by choice. You know how much I wanted my revenge.<eos> But in this town, I had to play nice to survive.<eos> Alone... watching them enjoy, the happiness I was denied.<eos> If you're planning on destroying some of that happiness,<eos> I want in. You can't expect us to believe that.<eos> Of course she doesn't.
What are we doing here?<eos> We needed someplace out of the way To hang our headdresses and hide our kidnapped puppets, And this little hovel became available to us.<eos> No.<eos> Your dark magic... It's not a spell or an object.<eos> It's...<eos> That's right, deary.<eos> It's me.<eos> You didn't really think I'd stay banished for long, now, did you?<eos> No.<eos> I didn't.
- That's messed up.<eos> - And they're real dirty.<eos> - Aw! - Can I have a gimlet, please?<eos> - I.D.?<eos> - Seriously?<eos> Why? 'Cause you ordered a dumb drink.<eos> Ah. - Thank you.<eos> - You got a Kansas license.<eos> That's where I learned to drive, and I have an emotional attachment to it, and I don't need to explain that to you.<eos> No, you don't, but...
Yeah.<eos> We got a crawl to finish.<eos> Now out of my way, I'm getting another drink.<eos> I can't let you in.<eos> You're not wearing shoes.<eos> Where are you shoes, Nick?<eos> Honestly, I threw 'em at a squirrel.<eos> - Everybody's waiting for you.<eos> - I can't go into the bar.<eos> I don't shoes on.
It's never known anything but death.<eos> It's not like us.<eos> It's not like anybody.<eos> Are you saying we should just hand Rachael over?<eos> Henry...<eos> People weren't willing to give us a chance.<eos> - How can we assume the worst of this child?<eos> - Still..<eos> We don't know what's really going on.<eos> Nobody does.
Your friend wanted to be a hero.<eos> And you know what happens to heroes?<eos> They die.<eos> You hurt my friend.<eos> I learned it by watching you.<eos> Aah!<eos> Ow!<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I forgive you.<eos> We both do.
I'm... I'm sorry to just stop by.<eos> Is Ravi here?<eos> I couldn't get in my place, I think he changed the locks.<eos> Hey. Good to see you out and about, mate.<eos> Yeah, I've been eating a lot of stuff that requires spoons for the past week so, um...<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> Did you know there were two General Tsos, both from the Qing dynasty?<eos> This dish was named for the one that suppressed the Dungan Revolt.<eos> No.<eos> But I do now.
He thinks you'd bring fresh gusto to the justices' deliberations.<eos> And when are you meeting with Flaherty and Dominguez?<eos> Well, there's no plan to.<eos> Not yet.<eos> You are our man.<eos> - Really?<eos> - You sound surprised.<eos> Well, you've been Peter Florrick's man for years, and Peter Florrick wouldn't cross the street to stop me from choking, so yeah, I guess I am surprised.<eos> - Things change.<eos> - No, they don't.
- Your Honor? - Don't you dare feign ignorance with me, Ms. Lockhart.<eos> The fact that you conspired to waste this court's time is not only personally offensive, - it's potentially actionable. - I have no idea what...<eos> It shows poor judgment, tremendous disrespect, and will deservedly color every interaction both of you have in this court and every court in the jurisdiction.<eos> Where's your client?<eos> Where the hell is Cary Agos?<eos> I'm here, Your Honor.<eos> Good. Get your ass up here for sentencing.<eos> Your Honor, we have found the Brady violation,<eos> - and we ask... - Oh, yes, you have your Brady violation - because you delayed me.<eos> - Uh, Your Honor, with respect, I did nothing of the kind.
In the kitchen, in the living room, in the bedroom.<eos> Everywhere.<eos> The prints came back to Daniel Shaw.<eos> He's been there.<eos> Staying there.<eos> Shaw is Winthrop's partner.<eos> So, you worked with my dad in Seattle?<eos> That's right.<eos> Then you must know Julie Finlay, too.<eos> Yeah, I do.
You know, when I was a cop in Seattle, I didn't have much respect for people.<eos> But I always respected your dad.<eos> You're strong... like him.<eos> You have no idea.<eos> I am not going to make it easy.<eos> Light's green.<eos> Go.<eos> I'm so sorry.<eos> You heard about Maya.<eos> I did.
Hide, hide, hide.<eos> Okay, good, good.<eos> Good girl, good girl.<eos> All that hand-wringing, Felix.<eos> She's just a normal girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Careful with the gloating.<eos> You're going to get more wrinkles.<eos> I love alcohol!<eos> Yes, we all do.
Okay, good, good.<eos> Good girl, good girl.<eos> All that hand-wringing, Felix.<eos> She's just a normal girl.<eos> Yes.<eos> Careful with the gloating.<eos> You're going to get more wrinkles.<eos> I love alcohol!<eos> Yes, we all do.<eos> You do, don't ya?
Be strong, my little urchin.<eos> What is it?<eos> I need your help with something and it's really important, so I don't want any quivering.<eos> - Okay.<eos> - I want you to take me to Rachel.<eos> What?<eos> If anybody knows about castor, it's going to be her.<eos> I'm not authorized.<eos> I'm not even supposed to know where she is.<eos> Yeah, but you do, don't you?
What is it?<eos> What book?<eos> I'm proud of you, Ali.<eos> I mean, you took this place and made it yours.<eos> Well, it's essentially the same, but...<eos> But that's not why you asked me here.<eos> No. No.<eos> I thought we should talk about the campaign mixer and... you know...<eos> You know?<eos> No, I don't.
You need to stop this.<eos> - I'm married.<eos> - I know.<eos> Hey, marriage is complicated.<eos> I'm safe.<eos> No one needs to know.<eos> No, no.<eos> This is a business relationship.<eos> If this has become something else in your head... maybe you're grasping at something you never had.<eos> I did, though, didn't I?
Are we meeting someone already?<eos> No time to waste.<eos> We have to track down Castor, so... I called an old friend.<eos> 20 years ago, he helped to find you.<eos> Siobhan the bomb.<eos> You ain't changed a day.<eos> Sarah, Felix, Terry.<eos> All right?<eos> Got my message?<eos> Yeah, course I did.
I just gotta go.<eos> I'll call you later, okay?<eos> Okay.<eos> Shit!<eos> We're closed.<eos> Okay, yeah, all right, okay, I hear you.<eos> Come in.<eos> That looks like it hurts.<eos> You should see the other guy.<eos> I did.
You should see her after a fight. [chuckles]<eos> She collapses onto the canvas like she's given it all she's got.<eos> Crowd just eats it up.<eos> I'm gonna keep you for observation, Kara.<eos> A quick word?<eos> We can keep them separated for now, but, um, this rivalry seems to be problematic.<eos> Well, there's nothing wrong with a little healthy competition.<eos> Yeah, I think the key word there is "healthy."<eos> And, uh, Tammy over there doesn't seem to know when to stop.<eos> No, she doesn't.
It's teacher-development day.<eos> I'm calling social services.<eos> How are things with your foster family?<eos> They eat rabbits.<eos> Well, you can't stay here.<eos> There's a dust vac over there if you'd like to clean up your crumbs.<eos> Hi.<eos> Can I speak with Mr. Perez, please?<eos> You said you were coming to Leila's funeral.<eos> You never did.
It means I'm thinking you're liking being disembodied a little bit too much.<eos> I get to be me here, do all the things my mind tells me to do, and nobody looks at me funny.<eos> Yeah, but you're still being led by the voices in your head.<eos> I can't really explain it.<eos> I have a whole other relationship with reality.<eos> You don't understand.<eos> Oh, I think you'd be surprised.<eos> My compulsions tell me they're keeping me safe.<eos> They didn't work today.<eos> No, they didn't.
Helping the Edleys.<eos> Are you gonna go next door, too?<eos> I will.<eos> I need to stay here to look after you.<eos> So...<eos> Go to bed.<eos> Tessa?<eos> Have you seen my letter from Henry?<eos> I could have sworn I left it right here on the nightstand.<eos> You did.
Because I don't particularly like to look back.<eos> "What are you going to do about your life beginning today?"<eos> Is what Glasser would have us ask ourselves.<eos> The only thing that matters is right now.<eos> The past may hold some answers.<eos> Well, I've spent most of my life trying to make my two ex-wives and a handful of girlfriends happy.<eos> And looking back on it now, I don't- - I don't even think I liked them.<eos> But I-I like this one... because she doesn't want to look backwards, either.<eos> Now, if you have some practical advice to offer--<eos> We do.
Geez.<eos> Tessa. You want to talk, you don't want to talk. I mean, I'm trying here.<eos> My mind's already made up.<eos> So, why don't you undo your belt, and I'll put my mouth on you?<eos> Yeah?<eos> Why not?<eos> You obviously misunderstood me.<eos> We had an agreement. And that was--<eos> I understood the agreement.<eos> And I did it.
Yeah, let's go.<eos> Step forth.<eos> The true path to victory is to find... your opponent's weakness and make him suffer for it.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> To take his strength and use it against him until he finally falls or quits.<eos> A real warrior never quits.<eos> Don't worry, Master.<eos> I will never quit.<eos> If he's smart, he won't come back up those steps.<eos> But he will.
And I'm not the Dragon Warrior.<eos> Then why didn't you quit?<eos> . You knew I wanted you gone, yet you stayed.<eos> Yeah, I stayed.<eos> I stayed because every time... you threw a brick at my head... or said I smelled, it hurt, but it could never hurt more... than it did every day of my life just being me.<eos> I stayed because I thought, if anyone could change me could make me... not me it was you.<eos> The greatest kung fu teacher in all of China.<eos> But I can change you.<eos> I can turn you into the Dragon Warrior.<eos> And I will.
Rest assured, we come with his blessing.<eos> Now hand over the mask!<eos> Your grace, I cannot...<eos> This is not the time for personal glorys, Sir Osric.<eos> You will hand over the mask!<eos> Your grace has our answer.<eos> This is treason!<eos> You have been corrupted by the mask!<eos> I'm gonna die!<eos> Yeah, you will.
The king?<eos> The king would not understand.<eos> Now I rule as king, as hierophant and as avatar of our goddess!<eos> I brought peace to this unworthy lands.<eos> I ressurected the glory of the light!<eos> And only I am deserving of the power of Therin!<eos> Now...kneel before your new god!<eos> You have betrayed your vows and your goddess.<eos> She will not stand for this blasphemy.<eos> And neither will I.
The last thing Flynn told me before he died was that your husband was killed by a glass-tipped spear, like the ornamental ones in the homestead.<eos> Glass-tipped is a Kimberley spear.<eos> King George is from Arnhem.<eos> Fletcher was trying to make it look like King George.<eos> Fletcher.<eos> It can't be proved.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Maitland...<eos> We can't let them win.<eos> We won't.
I can schedule the classes around Katie's school.<eos> And if I score over 80 on the test, RealTops guarantees me a job.<eos> How much is the class?<eos> It's $ 1100.<eos> This could be really good for us.<eos> I can make money selling homes. Enough that we can move out of the city, on a lake.<eos> - But Dallas isn't that bad, come on.<eos> - I know. There's a RealTops office in Marietta.<eos> When that brewery opens... But they haven't offered me the job yet.<eos> Yeah, but they will.
- Thank you.<eos> - You don't have to thank me.<eos> Yes, I do.<eos> The Joker won.<eos> Harvey's prosecution, everything he fought for undone.<eos> Whatever chance you gave us at fixing our city dies with Harvey's reputation.<eos> We bet it all on him.<eos> The Joker took the best of us and tore him down.<eos> People will lose hope.<eos> They won't.
It's like right now... after all the shit that we have been through in the last few days... you know, he's in there having the time of his life, having sex.<eos> I never should have left her.<eos> I don't even know...<eos> I don't even know what I was thinking.<eos> I loved her so much.<eos> She was my little baby.<eos> Why did I let my little baby go?<eos> Why did I let her go?<eos> You'll find someone else.<eos> No, I won't.
I don't even know what I was thinking.<eos> I loved her so much.<eos> She was my little baby.<eos> Why did I let my little baby go?<eos> Why did I let her go?<eos> You'll find someone else.<eos> No, I won't.<eos> Not like Vanessa.<eos> You'll find love again someday.<eos> Yeah, you will.
We're playing by my rules now, Ex-Captain!<eos> Seize him!<eos> -You cannot do this, No. 2!<eos> -Can, and will. -You brought this on yourself.<eos> -What are we supposed to do?<eos> You do what you took an oath to do and protect me, your captain, Four.<eos> Stay back, Four. I don't want to see anyone get hurt.<eos> You'll never get away with this, Two.<eos> The rest of the crew will not support you!<eos> Oh, yes, they will.
And besides, that, my friend, is not a dog. It's a goddamn horse.<eos> Well, let me know when you add a horse policy to the contract.<eos> Yes.<eos> Mr. Thomas, it's connie tepos.<eos> Hey, connie.<eos> I don't know why i'm calling you but i'm calling you.<eos> You said you could help us and... can you really help us?<eos> This just doesn't make any sense.<eos> - What if he finds us?<eos> - He won't.
Those days are over for us, amigo.<eos> We had a good run though.<eos> Come on, Marley.<eos> I know this is gonna sound crazy... but what's that thing called when you owe money on a house?<eos> - It starts with an "M."<eos> - Mortgage. Mortgage.<eos> Is it possible to be this tired?<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna get up with him tonight.<eos> No, you won't.
My uncle from Nara, the black sheep of the family.<eos> Are you going to pick those up?<eos> Why would I?<eos> That's littering!<eos> Don't be silly. Look at them!<eos> They'll sprout, put down roots... get bigger and bigger and bigger... and next year it'll be watermelons and watermelons... a whole hill of them, more than you can eat!<eos> Wow!<eos> Hot, ain't it!<eos> Would you like to wipe off the sweat?<eos> Yeah, maybe I will.
Come on.<eos> On stage!<eos> There you go!<eos> Beautiful!<eos> You remember when we were little?<eos> We used to have baths with dad, and we'd rub soap into his legs and they were so hairy they'd always go white?<eos> Then he'd fart and we'd start clapping and you'd go, 'poo-poo noises', 'poo-poo noises'.<eos> I've hated being your brother.<eos> Every night I used to close my eyes and wish that when I woke up you'd be normal.<eos> But you won't.
Ponyo's hair looks good in red.<eos> Clothe is not wet?<eos> Ponyo is used to be a fish.<eos> It's ok to be wet.<eos> Ya.<eos> Ponyo like this.<eos> Great, let's have tea.<eos> Ponyo, bring the lights here.<eos> Will water come out?<eos> Yes it will!

You're not, right?<eos> They're waiting for me.<eos> We're off now.<eos> See you.<eos> This place is huge, and you're moving into some tiny room!<eos> Coming to dinner?<eos> Mom, please...<eos> Don't move.<eos> That won't make me stay.<eos> In a photo it will.
I live here , in this corner ... my jacket ... ... with my bag ... ... and my euros ... bourgeois ... Until the battery of my euros grow up here .<eos> Then I can buy my flock of goats.<eos> I showed my mailbox Mail calf injury .<eos> The storm did that .<eos> I found it in the street, poor cow .<eos> My dad is doing their specialty coffee .<eos> Nobody makes a coffee like my dad.<eos> - You lost your touch.<eos> - Do not underestimate me .<eos> Then you will able to.
I just happen to think people are better off doing some kind of work they actually like.<eos> - Right. Right, yes. - Absolutely, absolutely.<eos> But, I mean, assuming there is this true vocation waiting for you, wouldn't you be just as likely to discover it here as there?<eos> I don't think it's possible to discover anything on the 15th floor of the Knox building, and I don't think any of you do either.<eos> - Daddy, will you read us all the way to here.<eos> - Michael.<eos> We have to take a big boat ride across the sea to get there.<eos> - But I won't know anybody there.<eos> - I know. I know.<eos> Neither will I.
Oh, right.<eos> Yes. Listen, uh, I got some kids with me right now.<eos> My nephew and niece.<eos> But, I gotta fix your father's TV. - Could you watch them for a few minutes?<eos> - Huh?<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Come in.<eos> - Mr. Nottingham, sir?<eos> - Uh, the telly won't turn on.<eos> It won't?
The end. Let's hope it works.<eos> Very well written, brilliantly constructed.<eos> Jeremiah wouldn't take money for doing a good deed.<eos> Uh... I know Jeremiah a lot better than you guys.<eos> And believe me, he'd be all over that.<eos> He loves money. Mmm!<eos> I don't want that.<eos> Go back, rewrite. Rewrite.<eos> Gentlemen don't get paid.<eos> Will you just...
At least he's not locked up.<eos> He should be.<eos> If you don't decide you'll end up being nothing and then you'll have to live in a kip like this.<eos> I'm not marrying ya if we have to live in a kip like this.<eos> I'm only messing, you know I will.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Are ya okay?<eos> It's heavier than it looks, isn't it.<eos> Will I get you some ice?<eos> I will.
Yeah, we should probably do that.<eos> Well, do you wanna get in?<eos> I don't think so.<eos> So how do you wanna do this?<eos> I don't know.<eos> We could wait for a red light.<eos> Will you come to my launch party tonight?<eos> - Would you like me to?<eos> - Yes, I would.<eos> Then I will.
Just do it. I have a gift for you.<eos> It's your birthday but you're the one giving me a gift?<eos> Close your eyes.<eos> You're just full of surprises.<eos> What's taking you so long?<eos> It's almost there.<eos> What? - You can open your eyes now.<eos> Not yet, I'm still visualizing it.<eos> Up to you!<eos> Okay, I will.
You're gonna owe them so much money.<eos> I don't even care.<eos> You are one cool customer.<eos> And that just pisses you off, doesn't it?<eos> - Yeah, it does...<eos> - You wanna shoot me, don't you?<eos> You have no idea.<eos> - Well why don't you do it then?<eos> - Think I won't?<eos> - 'Cause I will.
When I... when I was leaving,when I was... when I asked you to give me a reason to stay, you chickened out,which I-I get.<eos> I get that.It was a lot.<eos> It was scary,and I-I know I can be kinda intense, but I thought... I thought... oh!<eos> I thought after the... the chickening out part,I thought... you would come for me.<eos> I came back for you,which basically... makes me a beggar.<eos> I'm a beggar for halloween.<eos> And now you're mocking me.<eos> I'm not mocking you.<eos> We need... to talk.<eos> We will.
So one man dies and you threaten another just because you haven't got a lead.<eos> You know, I find...<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> Unbelievable.<eos> I'm doing it again.<eos> Trying to change you.<eos> What's the point?<eos> Just forget I said anything.<eos> Thank you.<eos> I will.
Doakes was officially a person of interest.<eos> Not reporting that call Could be considered aiding and abetting.<eos> None of you wanted to hear what he had to say,<eos> So I didn't tell you.<eos> What did he have to say?<eos> That he's innocent.<eos> And you believe him?<eos> What do you think?<eos> And if he calls again?<eos> He won't.
You two.<eos> Secure a perimeter and have the fire chief come to see me.<eos> Put out an APB on Lila West, aka Lila Tournay, suspected arsonist.<eos> 5'7", black hair, pale like a fucking corpse.<eos> Fucking corpse, got it.<eos> You're wasting your time.<eos> She's not coming back.<eos> Not after this.<eos> - Yeah, I wouldn't bet on it.<eos> - She won't.
It's, um...<eos> After I saw you last night, I met this guy.<eos> We hooked up.<eos> With who?<eos> It doesn't matter.<eos> I was... I was mad at you.<eos> It was stupid.<eos> It'll never happen again.<eos> No.<eos> It won't.
He won.<eos> Bulletproof.<eos> Boss.<eos> I'm freezing.<eos> Thank you!<eos> Genji!<eos> I'm alive!<eos> I'm still alive!<eos> Sorry, but if I don't defeat you, I don't have Suzura.<eos> You never will.
But I already gave them Hawkins.<eos> It's not about Hawkins.<eos> They want to know about Jericho.<eos> What our defenses are like.<eos> Do we have any troops?<eos> Where are they posted?<eos> Do we have a stockpile of weapons?<eos> We have to get back.<eos> We have to warn them.<eos> We will.
We have to get back.<eos> We have to warn them.<eos> We will.<eos> We're not going to die in here.<eos> Hey.<eos> I'm taking off.<eos> Thanks for all your help.<eos> Yeah. No problem.<eos> You need to get some rest.<eos> I will.
I mean,did-did you sniff too much glue as a child?<eos> I'm asking you something here.<eos> What do you want from me?<eos> I want...<eos> I want you to give me a reason to stay... a real reason.<eos> I mean, jeff's-- jeff's a decent guy, a good, decent guy.<eos> But to him, I'm rebecca,and I don't know if I am rebecca anymore and... you know me.You knew-you knew when I couldn't even speak who I was.<eos> You...you named me a, and I was more me as ava then I'll ever be as rebecca.<eos> Look, I-I have every reason to go back to my life.<eos> And I will.
Female prison guards...<eos> Okay, there was really only one choice.<eos> The letter-writing women who were on the prowl for inmates.<eos> Apparently, these women use some web site called<eos> "convict match" to find the prisoner of their dreams.<eos> All we had to do was make a video of Frank and have Randy put it into the web site using a magic cord.<eos> - Say "cheese."<eos> - You know, I don't want to do this.<eos> Besides, no one's going to love me the way Billie did.<eos> Sure they will.
I can't believe we're doing this in a patient's room.<eos> It's about to get hotter.<eos> Yes.<eos> Turk, you are full of surprises.<eos> Isn't he, though?<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> - He's here to kill you.<eos> - Kill me?<eos> Elliot won't let you get away with it.<eos> Sure I will.
Father?<eos> Andy?<eos> Father, God's not with us.<eos> Not anymore.<eos> Andy, of course he is.<eos> Why would you say that?<eos> What's wrong?<eos> He can't help us.<eos> And if he can...<eos> He won't.
- You took something?<eos> - Yes!<eos> I can'T... come down.<eos> I just want to come down.<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Lucy.<eos> Please, just let me go.<eos> All right, lucy, how about this?<eos> If you tell us what happened, we'll let you go.<eos> You will?
TO BE OUT AFTER DARK AND TO TALK TO SOMEONE WHO ISN'T JUST YOU OR MOM, EVEN IF IT IS BLAIR.<eos> NO OFFENSE.<eos> NONE TAKEN.<eos> WELL, I'M SORRY THIS WAS THE ONLY WAY.<eos> WE'LL WORK ON MOM, OKAY?<eos> THANKS.<eos> AND SINCE SHE KNOWS YOU'RE OKAY, I GUESS THERE'S NO REAL REASON TO RUSH.<eos> HOW ABOUT WE WALK?<eos> OH, CALL ME.<eos> YEAH, I WILL.
You want me to give him more responsibility in the family?<eos> Look, i don't know what the answer is, but we can't keep going on like this, or else we'll lose him.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sorry to interrupt, but mr.Archibald is awake.<eos> He was asking for you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - You're welcome.<eos> I'll go see how he's doing.<eos> No.<eos> I will.
It just arrived today... on his birthday.<eos> Brutal.<eos> Why don't you sell it?<eos> yeah. Yeah,maybe I will.<eos> Or give it away.Just-- great.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I'm gonna give it away.<eos> Hey. Hey.<eos> You will not give allan that bike.<eos> I won't?
The woman allan dumped you for cami?<eos> he didn't dump me.<eos> He just married her right after he left me.<eos> What the hell is she doing with naomi?<eos> Cami davis is a patient here?<eos> You should ask naomi.<eos> What is cami davis here for?<eos> You should ask naomi.<eos> Fine.<eos> I will.
He can't just do something he has to go back the next day<eos> - and just check his work.<eos> - Right.<eos> I'm sorry, I forgot I'm showing an apartment to someone else downstairs, so...<eos> - I'll be right back.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Thanks, Linda.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I could have you arrested.<eos> But you won't.
-What does that mean?<eos> -He's not talking, he's been on that phone for ten minutes.<eos> -What does it mean that -they scrambled the planes and sent in the helicopters?<eos> It means they know the prisoners are dead, -and they're gonna bomb the place.<eos> -Tom...<eos> -That's what it means, right?<eos> -Tom...<eos> That's what it means, right?<eos> Just tell me.<eos> I will.
I have to talk to you.<eos> - You were right.<eos> About everything.<eos> About me.<eos> About Alejandro.<eos> - I never meant to come between you two.<eos> - He's my brother.<eos> I have to do what I can to protect him.<eos> - In time, he will understand.<eos> - Of course he will.
How am I supposed to do that?<eos> Just turn on the Mick St. John charm.<eos> What girl could resist?<eos> All right, listen to me.<eos> If Morgan is Coraline--<eos> And I'm not saying she is-- if--<eos> And she realizes that you suspect her, I don't know what she'll do.<eos> I'll be careful.<eos> But one way or another, I will finally find out the truth.<eos> We both will.
We have to go.<eos> - At night, no way!<eos> - Yes, auntie.<eos> I won't let you move.<eos> She hasn't seen her son for a month.<eos> He's at the monastery.<eos> Khalil, call your friends.<eos> Tony, the road is dangerous.<eos> Call them anyway.<eos> OK, I will.
God is generous.<eos> Hey, guys...<eos> - Can't we call them?<eos> - The lines are down.<eos> Even the mobiles don't work.<eos> You're looking for this?<eos> You want to go there at night?<eos> Can you drive?<eos> I thought they were going to help us.<eos> They will, tomorrow morning.
How is this reflected just on me, like it was just me who was driving?<eos> - It's not just you!<eos> - I wasn't even doing anything!<eos> - Oh, Jack, come on.<eos> Badge was driving, Oakley should have been driving. Yeah?<eos> I really don't think how I'm the most guilty person.<eos> Just go and think about it. Piss off, go on.<eos> - I'll say sorry to Elisabetta.<eos> - Yeah, you certainly will.<eos> - But, fine, I will.
–I want to do a job!<eos> –You can do the next one!<eos> Don't touch that.<eos> Why are you drinking Rohypnol, Jen?<eos> Flunitrazepam...<eos> Yep, that's definitely Rohypnol.<eos> Are you having problems with insomnia?<eos> That's nonsense.<eos> Drink it, then.<eos> All right, I will.
How can you forget?<eos> What if you'd stayed there?<eos> - Don't think like that.<eos> - It's impossible not to.<eos> Where's the car?<eos> Where is he?<eos> Let it go.<eos> Tell me that it's okay with you that one day you may run into him.<eos> What will happen if they don't catch him?<eos> They will.
Well, how about I tell you a little secret About what you might get to do later tonight?<eos> The night before lily met marshall... Uh-huh. There was this party.<eos> You a freshwoman?<eos> I never use the word "freshman." Sexist.<eos> Yeah, I'm a first year.<eos> I'm in hewitt 220.<eos> No way.<eos> Hewitt 110.<eos> You should totally come by.<eos> Maybe I will, hewitt 110.
You know?<eos> But as drunk as she was, when she woke up the next morning, She still remembered room 110.<eos> That's why she knocked on the door.<eos> She was looking for me.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Yeah, and in all these years, Lily and I have never even spoken about it, So again, mum's the word, okay?<eos> You have to tell marshall.<eos> No, if, if he heard that, it would destroy him.<eos> If you don't tell him... (singsongy):<eos> I will.
!<eos> You follow me again...<eos> Just gonna watch me get stabbed?<eos> What do you want me to do, hurl myself onto his knife?<eos> It doesn't work like that.<eos> Where's dad?<eos> He's working late, sweetie.<eos> He said he was gonna help me with the sign.<eos> I know he did, honey.<eos> He will.
Yeah.<eos> Look at me. Do you really think i'd rob a liquor store?<eos> No, but i didn't think you'd come armed to a black-tie fundraiser either.<eos> And people go to prison all the time for crimes they didn't commit.<eos> ? Going be ok<eos> How's zack?<eos> He's not great.<eos> Jack says he'll take him to the game.<eos> You have to tell him that you're not going, dan.<eos> I will.
I don't want to hear it.<eos> Stop the banquet.<eos> Stop it.<eos> It must be stopped!<eos> 1926, just after death of King Soon-jong<eos> Adding Japanese flavor to Korean food makes a great combination.<eos> I will carefully protect the secret recipe.<eos> It's been passed down through generations in our family.<eos> Guard it well and give it to your descendants.<eos> I will, sir.
The ghetman doesnt need your fortress. If you withstand the first attack he will move on.<eos> Prepare for the defense well.<eos> I'll do my best, with God's help.<eos> But the cannons....<eos> I took some of your horses<eos> And the cannons...<eos> I need them more than you do<eos> Well, good bye!<eos> Will this do?<eos> It will, it will.
Let's clean up the streets.<eos> This is how it's gonna work.<eos> You're gonna walk right up to him.<eos> You're gonna kindly ask him to leave.<eos> He's gonna see me with the bat, looking tough.<eos> He's gone.<eos> That's it?<eos> That's all you need to do when you look like a badass, Dee.<eos> That's not gonna work.<eos> Yes, It will.
Is anyone having problems with him?<eos> (Pingpong) I don't know.<eos> June, can you help us look for him?<eos> As soon as I get out of here, I'll look for him.<eos> Yes. Yes. Ok.<eos> One moment, let me check one moment.<eos> (Music Company) So Slow<eos> Is he gonna show up?<eos> Of course.<eos> Of course he will.
- Great.<eos> I Iove parties.<eos> - I Iove parties, too.<eos> - Meeting people.<eos> - I Iove it.<eos> - Dancing.<eos> - Dancing and meeting people.<eos> That's what I'm about.<eos> Maybe I'II see you there.<eos> - Maybe you will.

Hiro..<eos> Might be dying soon.<eos> Is he sick?<eos> He's been waiting for me all this time.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I want to go.<eos> Don't go.<eos> That guy doesn't care for you anymore<eos> If you leave now you won't come back. ?<eos> No I won't
[LOUD GROWL] Hey Dave, here's a better idea:<eos> How about YOU shoot it and I'll run away and hide!<eos> Maybe we shouldn't have shot the pigeon.<eos> Excuse me, "I" shot the pigeon. YOU shot up those windows over there you lunatic.<eos> I wouldn't if you hadn't scared me!<eos> Oh quit complaining.<eos> This thing is probably gonna to kill you anyway.<eos> Hey, if it kills me it's gonna kill you too!<eos> I don't know why you sound so calm about this!<eos> Of course it won't!
That cold ain't the weather, that's death approaching.<eos> Who you think they gonna take first?<eos> The girl who thinks a gun will help her?<eos> The kid, sheriff's kid?<eos> Or the old gal?<eos> Shut up!<eos> Yeah.<eos> Thank you for the plastique.<eos> I can snap that apart and pick the lock.<eos> - No, you won't.
- I promise!<eos> - Glen, shut up!<eos> No, you shut up!<eos> Don't talk to me!<eos> Don't talk to me, criminal!<eos> - Oh, sugar rush. - This is...<eos> This is not his fault.<eos> See?<eos> So can I go home now?<eos> - Oh, okay. I won't.
How comforting, my husband.<eos> Hail, Beowulf!<eos> Hail, Beowulf!<eos> Unferth.<eos> You're not celebrating your King's glory tonight?<eos> I have something for the King.<eos> What is it?<eos> I said I have something for the King.<eos> Show It To me.<eos> I will not.
If they have a credit card.<eos> Look, Donna, we, as entertainers cannot tailor-make everything we do for children.<eos> It's the parents' responsibility to monitor what their kids watch.<eos> That's a cop-out, Ian, and you know it.<eos> You have to take some responsibility.<eos> Donna, I am not forcing anybody to log on and tune in.<eos> I create shows people like to watch. I didn't create the demand.<eos> People like to watch violence.<eos> They always have.<eos> Probably always will.
- So cold.<eos> (glass crunching)<eos> I love you, Daddy.<eos> Don't you love me anymore?<eos> Of course I do, sweetheart.<eos> There we go. I got you.<eos> I got you now, Katie.<eos> - Oh my God.<eos> - They won't let me stay.<eos> - Yes, they will.
# For I see my pappy coming<eos> # Traveling many a mile<eos> # Traveling many a mile<eos> # Papa, Papa<eos> # Has you brought gold<eos> # For to pay this hangman's fee<eos> # Or did you come to see me swinging<eos> # High from this hangman's tree<eos> You think people will come?<eos> Of course they will.
- You just need to stop.<eos> You know what?<eos> Do you do any private lessons?<eos> I could do private lessons if you could do me a little favor.<eos> What's that?<eos> Just need you talk to your little brothers about funding my little video tape.<eos> I'm trying to make power-tap more international.<eos> I'm trying to be like Billy Blanks, but double the money and half the Blank.<eos> That's a good idea.<eos> Maybe I will, maybe I will.
Hold that thought.<eos> Hey, beautiful.<eos> Girls...<eos> I'd like to talk to Lilly alone, if I could.<eos> Ok, then. All of you.<eos> I know I messed up. Big time. - Yep.<eos> - Yes, you did.<eos> Now... your mom...<eos> I miss your mom.<eos> All the time and I always will.
You're different from when I first met you.<eos> It's funny.<eos> Crystal said the same thing to me.<eos> It's going to be five years this week.<eos> I know.<eos> She was my best friend.<eos> There's nothing you could have done, Stan.<eos> She was half dead when you found her.<eos> I am sure she forgives you.<eos> No, she won't.
We've made a mess of it.<eos> There's still time, if we use it well.<eos> Christianity has been a worldwide belief for 2,000 years.<eos> How long did the Egyptians worship Isis or the Sumerians Ishtar?<eos> In India, sacred cows wandered freely as reincarnated souls.<eos> In a thousand years, they'll be barbecued and their souls will be in squirrels.<eos> You weren't Jesus!<eos> Oh, Edith.<eos> If...it rains...<eos> It won't.
- I didn't see you.<eos> I'm just writing my vows.<eos> Trying to do something appropriate, but also funny.<eos> Not jokey, more character-based humor.<eos> You having an okay time?<eos> Yeah, besides Wizard getting out.<eos> Yeah.<eos> We'll find him.<eos> Or else, I don't know.<eos> - We won't.
Well the stitch won't show, I hope.<eos> Mom, this is a lot of money, where did you get it?<eos> Listen to me!<eos> This if you're gonna need it out there.<eos> Mom, can we just stop this for a second, please, this is creepy.<eos> I just want to know you haven't done something stupid.<eos> No, I haven't.<eos> Then, where did you get the money?<eos> I'm not telling you.<eos> And I never will.
Is that right, huh?<eos> Is that who you are now?<eos> Defender of the doofs?<eos> Look, i know i got a lot to set right by you, but this is crazy.<eos> What i do know is in your big, triumphant return, you seem to have forgotten which side of october road you belong on.<eos> Well, i'm gonna remind you how we roll here in the ridge.<eos> It ain't much, but it's tight.<eos> Let him go!<eos> Hey, stop it! Come on!<eos> No, nicky. No, i won't.
-You actually saw him?<eos> -Of course I did. Plain as day.<eos> He pushed me to the ground.<eos> And then he put his hands over my eyes.<eos> -I couldn't actually...<eos> I never actually...<eos> -Listen. I've known him my whole life, and I saw him.<eos> Because I couldn't say for sure.<eos> Well, I can.<eos> And I will.
(tinkling) - Miss Angelica!<eos> Now remember, Miss Angelica, finish your studies.<eos> (knocking) Come in.<eos> Well, well, Miss Deverell returns.<eos> I hope this time you have a better excuse for your absence.<eos> - I've been sick, Miss Dawson.<eos> - And being sick has prevented you from writing your essay.<eos> - No. I've done it.<eos> - Then perhaps you'd care to share it with the class.<eos> - Of course I will.
We'll just observe him from a distance at breakfast, all right?<eos> We'll get a good look and then there'll be no mistakin' him.<eos> Stop staring, Ian.<eos> I want to get a good look at him.<eos> That poor bastard.<eos> Eatin' his breakfast. He has no idea his days are numbered.<eos> Oh, life can be so wicked, Ian.<eos> Have you got a good look at him, Terry?<eos> Will you remember his face?<eos> I will.
This maybe?<eos> It doesn't look good on you.<eos> How much?<eos> 30 yuan each.<eos> Give me a discount.<eos> I can't.<eos> 25?<eos> 30 yuan.<eos> If you buy them all...<eos> Sure, I will.
I'm very maternal.<eos> I'll be very caring.<eos> Like a gift.<eos> I thought giving was part of Christian life.<eos> Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via?<eos> The light quivering modestly in the morning.<eos> Dic nobis Maria quid vidisti in via?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> When are you coming back?<eos> I won't.
Oh, and you should have seen today.<eos> He was totally checking me out again.<eos> But he can't make a move, because data streaming is a very small community.<eos> And everybody would know.<eos> But he was checking me out.<eos> So I just went up to him, "We should have lunch sometime."<eos> Just like that.<eos> Totally casual. You should have seen him.<eos> Oh, he will call.<eos> He will.
I need you to find someone.<eos> Mikhaylo Sczerbiak.<eos> Yeah.<eos> You got it?<eos> I got it.<eos> Man, this is hard to spell.<eos> Swagger is going to go with what he knows.<eos> He'll try to track the shooter.<eos> He won't get far that way.<eos> Yes, he will.
We are in a BIT of a hurry, Leo.<eos> I just said that, to shut her up.<eos> OK, lets go.<eos> You calmed down, now?<eos> We won't hurt you, we just want some dough from your daddy.<eos> Who's got so much, he won't even miss it.<eos> He won't give you a thing.<eos> Why do you say that?<eos> He won't give you anything, that's all.<eos> Of course, he will.
Okay. You got it.<eos> Hope piggy can run.<eos> How old are you?<eos> Twenty-two.<eos> You certainly are.<eos> That'll be 80 dollars.<eos> Okay.<eos> Thank you kindly.<eos> Will that do?<eos> Certainly will.
So what happened?<eos> Theo, I just really have to go now.<eos> Give me your phone number.<eos> I'll call you.<eos> Where have you been?<eos> You know how much construction waste the city generates?<eos> I asked you a question.<eos> - I'll ask you something as well.<eos> Will you?<eos> - Yes, I will.
- Why?<eos> Because his brain stem's still functioning?<eos> He winces when you pinch him?<eos> Because he knows who Tony Blair is?<eos> You said loving him would make him better, you said rehab would make him better, but he can't get better because he doesn't know there's anything wrong with him!<eos> Because he doesn't remember the accident or the coma.<eos> It's like he didn't experience it.<eos> As far as he's concerned, nothing happened, so his brain is telling him there's nothing wrong with him.<eos> When will he realise?<eos> How will he?
You promised you would never leave me.<eos> I have to get married.<eos> Did you have sex with him?<eos> Of course.<eos> Do you love him?<eos> I'm going to be his wife.<eos> - Is Sapho leavng too?<eos> Yes she is.<eos> Will she take me with her?<eos> Of course she will.
You'll need your strength to face them.<eos> I had my chance.<eos> Then forgive me.<eos> No!<eos> What have you done?<eos> I saved your life.<eos> You never listened to me, did you?<eos> By doing that, you've probably just exhausted half your strength, not to mention the fact you've now exposed our presence to the Fallen.<eos> -My strength will come back.<eos> -No, it won't.
WHAT?<eos> I TOOK A BLOOD TEST, TOO.<eos> I DIDN'T WANT TO TELL YOU UNTIL I WAS SURE.<eos> IT WORKED.<eos> YE.<eos> ALL MY LIFE,LL I'VE EVER WANTED WAS TO HAVE A BABY,<eos> AND W, BECAUSE OF YOU, I'M GONNA...<eos> GOD, NOW I JUST NEED TO GET HEALTHY.<eos> NOW I JUST NEED-- I JUST NEED TO GET HEALTHY SO I CAN SEE THE LITTLE BUGGER GET INTO AN IVY LEAGUE SCHOOL, YOU KNOW?<eos> YOU WILL. OF COURSE YOU WILL.
- It's personal.<eos> So...<eos> You wanna do that meeting now, or what?<eos> Meeting's off.<eos> I don't understand.<eos> The police wanna talk to me about Brett.<eos> Just go with the detective. Answer his questions.<eos> Don't panic.<eos> - What if those men call?<eos> - They won't.
We just have to trust each other.<eos> I can do that.<eos> Now...<eos> So I'm gonna give you one more freebie.<eos> What am I thinking?<eos> We're having a baby?<eos> We're having a baby!<eos> Nik, what have they done to you?<eos> - If they catch you...<eos> - They won't.
- Sorry, love, but if I don't tell him I'm just as guilty as you two, aren't I?<eos> And what if he finds out?<eos> He'll never believe I didn't know.<eos> His precious daughter and one of my men.<eos> He'll have my guts!<eos> This is a right fucking mess.<eos> Please, sir, don't tell him.<eos> He'll kill her.<eos> No, he won't go that far, I shouldn't think.<eos> Yes, he will.
Any word from House?<eos> - No.<eos> - Maybe Cuddy will say no.<eos> Cuddy never says no.<eos> That's not true.<eos> Nobody ever says no.<eos> We don't say no.<eos> You don't say no.<eos> He'll come back, he'll browbeat us, he'll give us seven reasons, and eventually we'll fold.<eos> We all will, not just me.
You laughed when I threw up on the glass-blowing tour.<eos> Girls like you better.<eos> Your parents are married!<eos> Ay caramba!<eos> That's the only line I get in your stupid story?<eos> !<eos> There are no small parts, just small actors.<eos> This is my first day at this school.<eos> I haven't done anything to you!<eos> You will.
I'll tell you what.<eos> I'll go unlock the kids and make us all breakfast.<eos> No.<eos> I'll get the kids.<eos> - No... - tu-tut-tut. I insist.<eos> No.<eos> I'll get the kids.<eos> Some hand cream will make them rope burns feel better.<eos> It won't work.<eos> 'Course it will.
Now then, may I ask your price range?<eos> I'm not a man of means.<eos> I hope to, you know, one day...<eos> I have just the thing.<eos> This won't blind any queens, to be sure, but still, it has the sparkle of life.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> I'm... sorry?<eos> It's perfect.<eos> I'll take it.<eos> No, you won't.
Cristal clear.<eos> Since we're eavesdropping, can you find out what else she has on Lex and me ?<eos> Yeah, sure. Do a little recon while we're at it.<eos> Chloe, what is it ?<eos> Like tomorrow's headline ?<eos> And here I thought you hatred was just professional jealousy.<eos> Who knew you were covering such a scandalous secret ?<eos> You're actually gonna stake your reputation on this tabloid garbage that's not even fit for the Inquisitor ?<eos> Nobody's gonna believe you.<eos> Of course they will.
- You too.<eos> - Why not take Meyer along?<eos> - Give him some tips'?<eos> - Wouldn't you prefer to unpack?<eos> Not at all.<eos> I've got time enough.<eos> - Let's hunt some robbers.<eos> - Great.<eos> - Don't forget your farewell reception.<eos> - I won't.
See you tomorrow.<eos> Go home.<eos> I'll keep in touch with the police.<eos> She was 19... the age when life begins.<eos> But it's not our fault, is it'?<eos> I damned well hope not.<eos> I won't stand for it. Don't ever do that again.<eos> No chance.<eos> How could you promise we'll find him'?<eos> But we will.

But if you take that letter I'll lose my place at Berkeley and a chance to be with the man I love who I think loves me.<eos> And 15 years from now when he's trapped in a loveless marriage and I've become a cold, hard ice queen for whom love is but a distant memory it will come down to the fact that on this day, which happens to be my birthday you obeyed the letter of the law at the expense of simple human charity.<eos> - Wow, that was amaxing.<eos> - Can I have my letter now?<eos> Yeah, sure.<eos> - Hey.<eos> - I didn't know you were a runner.<eos> Yeah, it helps me work stuff out.<eos> - You should try it.<eos> - Maybe I will.
You're so lovely. Wow!<eos> Great.<eos> - If I wasn't seeing Simon, that'd be amazing.<eos> - Simon?<eos> That's me.<eos> - We've got so much in common.<eos> - Depression, self-Ioathing.<eos> He knows we can't have a physical thing, I don't do that now.<eos> - I'm still hoping you'll change your mind.<eos> - I won't.
Last time, when Butters spent the night, I was being really nice to him and I was gonna take a picture of him for his mom to have.<eos> Oh, that's nice.<eos> But then, right when I took the picture, Butters got really hot so he pulled his pajama bottoms down and then I tripped and fell down and my mouth landed right on his penis and then I thought of something funny<eos> so I smiled up at, the camera and gave like a, thumbs up and then Kyle took the picture from me and he's gonna show it to everybody and make them think I'm gay.<eos> Oh, there there, sweetie. It'll be okay.<eos> These things happen.<eos> But, mom, I've been trying to get the picture back, but he won't give it to me.<eos> It's okay, Eric.<eos> I'll have a talk with Kyle's mother.<eos> You will?
Run after him, then.<eos> I've never lived up to him the whole of me working life.<eos> Malone could be lying.<eos> He's not, though, is he?<eos> Those robberies spanned four divisions.<eos> Multiple investigations.<eos> Time that could have been spent going after rapists, murderers.<eos> Why would he do this?<eos> I could start an internal investigation...<eos> Like hell you will.
The war's a bummer, huh?<eos> It used to be money in the bank.<eos> You're the one having this argument right now, not me.<eos> I'm the one saying go produce your show.<eos> I'm the one throwing my body in front of Jack.<eos> -We've averaged a 5-7/19 over...<eos> -Over five months.<eos> Over two it's a 4-8 and the half-hours are simply unacceptable.<eos> -Then we need to talk about this.<eos> -We will.
Pepperoni pizza?<eos> - Connor?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> They're good times.<eos> Weren't they?<eos> You can fight the dark side, mate.<eos> You really can.<eos> You too, Connor. Move away!<eos> He will kill you.<eos> No he won't.
I can't leave if I've got a shot with her.<eos> When Julie finds out you knocked up my sister?<eos> Didn't your stepdad say no one's gonna find out about that?<eos> OK, try this.<eos> Julie's a nice girl. And you, well, you're a dog.<eos> No knock.<eos> I'm a dog lover, myself. But Julie deserves better.<eos> And you know you'll just end up cheating on her.<eos> No, I won't hurt her again.<eos> Sure you will.
The group wants a meeting.<eos> Yes, but...<eos> I've got two minutes before another meeting.<eos> Why haven't you suspended him?<eos> It looks as if you're covering for a murderer.<eos> We're in contact with the police.<eos> The man may be innocent.<eos> They're not saying that. It's a lot of pressure.<eos> - We might not withstand it.<eos> - Of course we will.
You say nothing!<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> He's killed your daughter and all you do is work on the house.<eos> What do you want me to do?<eos> What?<eos> They're saying that... he had an affair with her.<eos> What?<eos> If it is the teacher the police will find out.<eos> What if they don't?<eos> They will.
What?<eos> Nothing, I'm just wondering if everything is OK?<eos> I was thinking about adding a song to the karaoke machine...<eos> Would it work?<eos> Sure. In that case, I would like to sing.<eos> Really?<eos> Yeah, I haven't decided what song yet. I mean, it's a secret.<eos> OK.<eos> Just tell me if you need anything.<eos> I will.
I just told you I'm not.<eos> - Then who is?<eos> - I have no idea if anyone is.<eos> Vinnie, man, she told me she wanted to be friends.<eos> Show me the girl who wants to be friend, I'll show you the guy who's fucking her.<eos> Well, it ain't me.<eos> So can we go back to work?<eos> Yeah, Vin, go back to work.<eos> And will you write the ending?<eos> Yes, I will.
- He used to do Rock?<eos> - Yes, Mr. OH.<eos> Then why didn't he just stick to Rock?<eos> Oh, he just really wants to do Trot music.<eos> No demo, not even a picture of him, and you want a record deal.<eos> Is that what you're saying?<eos> You still owe me a lot of money.<eos> Sir, I'll pay back everything this time.<eos> If you don't?<eos> No, I will!
I'm a pretty good shot.<eos> Thank you, Mr. Bennet.<eos> Call me Noah.<eos> Come on.<eos> The guards are coming!<eos> Dad!<eos> Micah?<eos> We have to go.<eos> It won't work.<eos> Yes, it will.
I can't believe you let that man into our house.<eos> Honey, he's my largest campaign contributor.<eos> He's a thief and a liar and God knows what else.<eos> And if I win this election, he'll be the reason.<eos> Why?<eos> Because he gave you money?<eos> Nathan, don't forget who you are.<eos> I know exactly who I am.<eos> I'm a man who's being asked to make a hard choice for the greater good.<eos> And you will.
- I can't believe they have syphilis.<eos> - Yes, Barbie...<eos> Look, when people get old there are certain things they are no longer able to do, like drive a car over 20 miles an hour or smell like the living, but... the one thing they damn sure can do is have sex until they croak.<eos> The fact that matters is that thanks to a variety of male enhancement drugs... sexually transmitted diseases have increased amongst the elderly by 300 per cent.<eos> Argh, old people sex is disgusting.<eos> Really?<eos> Because from time to time I like to throw back to few blue bombers and head out on the town.<eos> Ok, we're leaving now.<eos> You won't go nowhere!<eos> No one will.
But now...<eos> Look, I'm a little bit busy right now, Sayid.<eos> And I'm trying to get us off this island, Jack.<eos> I can't transmit using this phone because Danielle's distress signal is overriding the frequency.<eos> If you tell me where the radio tower is, I can switch off your message and call for help.<eos> My signal has been playing for the last 1 6 years and nobody has heard it.<eos> - What makes you think you'll have luck?<eos> - Naomi's boat is 80 miles offshore.<eos> I know if we eliminate Danielle's signal, they'll hear us.<eos> No, they won't.
Yeah, except for you not letting me stay up late.<eos> - Well, you make sure and tell Dr. Gellman that.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Alright.<eos> Anna Miller?<eos> - You ready?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Okay, have fun.<eos> Tell the truth.<eos> Okay, I will.
A wanted fugee.<eos> Why don't we explain to Mr. Faron what they do to immigrants in this country?<eos> He knows.<eos> He's seen the cages.<eos> He's not that stupid.<eos> I'm not going to the government.<eos> You told me you would get me to the Human Project.<eos> - You promised me.<eos> - I know.<eos> And we will.
Aren't you the one who gave birth to her and sent her to me?<eos> Even if you practice hard, you are still in danger of mediocracy.<eos> How can you sit there so listlessly?<eos> Because you showed yourself at training today, can I trust that you have chosen to accept the wager?<eos> Yes, Mistress.<eos> Good.<eos> Then from today onwards, you must not see that young man.<eos> Even if you see him, you must not tell him of the wager.<eos> Will you accept these terms?<eos> I will.
Don't play with her.<eos> I mean, she's great, you know.<eos> She's a really nice person but she reminds me of my father.<eos> - What?<eos> - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Hey, we're going now.<eos> Bye-bye, bye-bye.<eos> Bye-bye.<eos> Hey, don't forget the forest and the boat, eh?<eos> Okay, I won't.
Inspector, it's awfully late and...<eos> Oh, I'm just going over these crime-scene photos.<eos> - Don't you need some rest?<eos> - Crime does not rest, Nicole.<eos> It's true.<eos> You see I have waited a long time to prove myself.<eos> And I've been given the opportunity of a lifetime.<eos> And I intend to show the world exactly who I am and what I can do.<eos> I must not fail.<eos> You won't.
Barely a day went by without one of them speculating wistfully about the reason for his absence and the likelihood of his return.<eos> Here I come.<eos> There's no room for two of us, diesel.<eos> You've done it again.<eos> I hate steam engines.<eos> When I come back I will pinch you with my pinchers.<eos> Yeah?<eos> Well, when I come back I'm gonna ram you with my rammer.<eos> - Ready?<eos> - No, you won't.
Now you can go back to sleep.<eos> Lucy, come on.<eos> Let's go.<eos> I will not go in the car seat!<eos> - You have to go in the car--<eos> - I will not go in the car seat!<eos> Yes, you will!<eos> - You will go in the car seat.<eos> - No, I won't!<eos> Yes, you will.
I don't think I've ever been here before.<eos> I don't think so either.<eos> Was that good?<eos> - Please, stay here a little longer.<eos> - I can't.<eos> I have another customer at 1:30.<eos> I work by appointments.<eos> 1:30.<eos> You won't make it in time.<eos> Yeah I will.
You're not supposed to.<eos> Maybe not.<eos> Listen, is there anywhere specific you'd like to go?<eos> Maybe over to Donna Hawthorne's place?<eos> From the information you brought in, sounds like you guys are pretty close.<eos> Yes, we are.<eos> How'd you know that?<eos> Process of elimination.<eos> I know who you aren't and we're talking about a very small group of people that we hoped would lead us higher.<eos> And maybe Barris will.
- Stretching his legs.<eos> How do you mean?<eos> He fell off the train. - Daddy?<eos> What's going on?<eos> - Look, We had 60 days to lock up the railroads.<eos> When I saw that because of those bitches we were going to lose that opportunity, I decided, why not take advantage of the situation, if I could?<eos> You're stealing the gold?<eos> - Yes sir, I am.<eos> Stop this train, right now!<eos> - No, sir. I won't.
- You don't understand do you?<eos> That's really it this time.That's going away!<eos> Maybe I want to keep using!<eos> You know, I'm sick of working,yes,but What if I want to keep using?<eos> Candy!<eos> Why don't you ring gay blokes?<eos> You start working! You hock your ass!<eos> Hey, you know you can not do that!<eos> You know, I'll get... I'll get AIDS!<eos> No you won't, you moron!
We could go live in Thailand...<eos> Thailand would be great,if we didn't use.<eos> Or the Himalayas.<eos> We'll go canoeing...<eos> A bit of white water rafting...<eos> Get healthy, sleep well not have drugs in our system.<eos> How good would that be?<eos> We really have to do this.<eos> We have to do it this time.<eos> Yeah, we will.
Who said that? !<eos> Look what I got.<eos> You're not gonna like this.<eos> well, ladies, I got some news for ya!<eos> Donny, what are you doing?<eos> - I'II tell ya what I'm doing, Ricky.<eos> This prison's overcrowded with dicks and muscle dummies!<eos> So I put in a word with the warden to let Ricky and julian out 26 days early!<eos> - Don't forget change, man, change.<eos> - I won't. I won't.
Come on, I got it.<eos> Oh, you got it, huh?<eos> What are you...<eos> Look at this guy.<eos> Special occasion. Big spender over here!<eos> Come on, Cos, let's go.<eos> Johnny says we're leaving, let's go!<eos> Hey, Johnny, watch this.<eos> Tell Jake we stopped in.<eos> Oh, I will.
I mean, it's a big problem and we got to fix it.<eos> So what do we do?<eos> I don't know.<eos> There's an answer here. There's, like, a solution. But I'm just...<eos> I don't know. Maybe we're fucked.<eos> We're not fucked.<eos> What do you mean, fucked?<eos> Jail fucked, motherfucker.<eos> If we let the kid go, he runs back to Mommy and Daddy and he rats us out.<eos> Maybe he won't.
With a book?<eos> Actually, I think I want to kiss you.<eos> Anything to say?<eos> Good luck tomorrow.<eos> You know, I see us together, you and me.<eos> I dream stuff all the time!<eos> Sometimes it comes true!<eos> Hey, I'm just telling you!<eos> I really think it might happen!<eos> Then maybe it will!
Let us sing.<eos> A mighty Fortress is our God, a trusty Shield and Weapon;<eos> He helps us free from every need that hath us now o'ertaken.<eos> Congratulations!<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Great decision.<eos> We'll all support you.<eos> I am sorry for the extra work you'll have to do.<eos> We'll help you, big shepherd.<eos> 0f course we will.
- I have to go, I've got lots to do.<eos> Wait, my sister wants to see you. She'll be here any minute.<eos> Some other day, I'm in a real hurry.<eos> She wants you to go on TV.<eos> You know she works on "Wherever You Are".<eos> They want to surprise her and they thought of you. You were friends as children and you both went to an audition.<eos> That's enough for several shows with interviews, music and songs from yesterday, from today and for all times.<eos> Tell her I don't like television.<eos> Neither do I. I'll tell her, but don't forget what I said.<eos> I won't.
Come on!<eos> - In the ring!<eos> - Fuck that!<eos> You have to concentrate on one fight at a time.<eos> Forget the American...<eos> Shut up!<eos> Do your fucking job!<eos> Heavyweight Champion of the World.<eos> I'll rip his fucking head off!<eos> Of course you will.
Hold on, now.<eos> I'm going to get something to drink.<eos> You want anything? - What?<eos> Yeah. Get me some porn. - OK.<eos> Get me something really nasty, too.<eos> I don't want any of that airbrushed shit.<eos> OK, here's a 20.<eos> Get yourself a little treat, too.<eos> Get yourself a fag rag.<eos> All right. I will.
- Thanks for calling it in. - Yeah, yeah.<eos> Always happy to help, huh?<eos> So where is it?<eos> The stone?<eos> We split, huh? Fifty-fifty, all right?<eos> Look around you, Danny boy.<eos> You're not in a position to be dictating terms.<eos> Then you will never find it, sir.<eos> That's correct.<eos> - But he will.
- That is why those girls are so skinny.<eos> - Oh, no, no, no.<eos> Give me that.<eos> There's, like, $8 of Jarlsberg in there.<eos> Know what?<eos> I just have to stick it out for a year.<eos> One year.<eos> And then I can do what I came to New York to do.<eos> But I can't let Miranda get to me.<eos> I won't.
It was the same as it is now.<eos> They put this CTG on me.<eos> It's a kind of belt.<eos> And I went, "Oh!<eos> "Get this crap off me!<eos> It hurts!<eos> "We can't, ma'am.<eos> "It's to hear the baby's heart!"<eos> "Take it off, I said!<eos> Or else, I will!
How many children do you have?<eos> I don't know yet.<eos> Yes?<eos> Does it work?<eos> Yes, it does.<eos> Good luck.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Papa, keep to yourself what I'm going to tell you.<eos> I made a pledge to take my daughter to Fatima. But keep this to yourself.<eos> I will.
'Relocate' means to wait! Don't you know?<eos> Please!<eos> Let's go to the police.<eos> Cops don't believe me!<eos> Bok-soon! Let's go!<eos> Let's go!<eos> What would you like?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> If I eat without paying, I'll go to jail, right?<eos> Of course you will!
Maybe beyond the smoke and the fighting<eos> there's a better place<eos> Maybe there really is a paradise where we can just love each other<eos> I don't know...<eos> I wonder if we ever really had a chance?<eos> If, even for a moment, we had a chance.... Maybe if we had, then...<eos> Lulu and Yali will probably give the papers a photo of the two of us<eos> Maybe the one from the rave where we look all high and happy<eos> Maybe people will see how beautiful we look and understand how stupid these wars are<eos> No, they probably never will
Let's see.<eos> How about you, Gallego?<eos> What's your last request?<eos> I want...<eos> I'd like to call home.<eos> And you, Guillermo?<eos> What do you want?<eos> Will you grant it?<eos> We are men of honor. We are not filthy liars.<eos> Of course we will.
What if it doesn't work?<eos> What if it does?<eos> Neale, you're afraid: : : To give up the very thing in yourself that brought you here in the first place:<eos> Give up?<eos> I'm running on empty:<eos> And that's why you're here:<eos> Uh, well, no: I'm here because- because I lost my job:<eos> You're here because you lost yourself:<eos> Well, right now I just want to get this job:<eos> You will:
What are you daydreaming about?<eos> Have you ever snuck out of school?<eos> Where to?<eos> Home, of course.<eos> What for?<eos> School is more fun than home.<eos> No parents to tell you what to do.<eos> Fun as hell, it is.<eos> It's hard at first but you'll get used to it.<eos> No, I won't.
You do it with hen's eggs.<eos> You can eat hen's eggs, not a robin's eggs. I'll put them back in the nest.<eos> It's too late.<eos> The female won't want them any more.<eos> Happy birthday!<eos> Happy birthday, Mum.<eos> Open it.<eos> It's for you.<eos> This plant will die in my room.<eos> It won't.
Let me in.<eos> I'll blend in with the crowd.<eos> No one'll notice me.<eos> - No way.<eos> - Please let me go in.<eos> No way.<eos> Move it.<eos> What difference will it make?<eos> No one'll know.<eos> 'Course they will.
- Sure.<eos> Hey, Bex.<eos> Your mom and dad...<eos> - Food.<eos> - Great.<eos> Because I wanted to talk to you.<eos> Your lab... The work...<eos> Have you been taking birth control pills?<eos> - If you tell my mom and dad...<eos> - No, I won't.
- Izzie, come on.<eos> OK.<eos> Keep your panties on.<eos> - All right.<eos> - No touching!<eos> Go.<eos> Advertising for a home for Doc?<eos> I said I'd do it.<eos> And you haven't.<eos> And you won't.
Well, um, I just finally set up my new juicer and I was going to make some juice, and I was, like,<eos> "You know who likes juice?<eos> Ted."<eos> I love juice.<eos> Great.<eos> So you want to come over and make juice?<eos> When it's after 2:00 a.m., just go to sleep because the decisions you make after 2:00 a.m. are the wrong decisions.<eos> Okay, sure.<eos> I'll come over.<eos> We'll... juice.
Sir-- sir,if you buy a statue, the money will buy polio vaccine for the village. 300 Naira, sir.<eos> What are you doing here?<eos> I have come to give my confession.<eos> Hello, Eko.<eos> Hello, brother.<eos> So I've come to visit you for the first time in three years and you won't hear my confession?<eos> You know, monsignor would have said he failed to raise a proper catholic boy.<eos> Well, why waste your time confessing?<eos> It won't help you.<eos> It won't?
Actually, me date's here.<eos> It'll have to be another time.<eos> We look out for each other, me and Jack.<eos> We have to. We're the only family we've got.<eos> You can have a couple of ours, if you want.<eos> Liam's cute.<eos> Bites a bit, but he'll grow out of it eventually.<eos> Jack says you're clever.<eos> The last thing you need's to get trapped round here.<eos> - l won't.
This is a better goodbye than last time.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe this time it'll be a little less permanent.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm a realist.<eos> I don't see much hope for us, Dean.<eos> Well, I've seen stranger things happen.<eos> Hell of a lot stranger.<eos> Goodbye, Dean.<eos> I'll see you, Cassie.<eos> I will.
What sort of Time Lord science?<eos> What d'you mean?<eos> They said one touch from a time traveller will wake it up.<eos> Technology using the one thing a Dalek can't do - touch.<eos> Sealed inside your casing, not feeling anything... ever.<eos> From birth to death, locked inside a cold, metal cage, completely alone.<eos> That explains your voice.<eos> No wonder you scream.<eos> The Doctor will open the Ark!<eos> The Doctor will not!
Carlos Guerrero has chosen to live in a dangerous world.<eos> That's his truth.<eos> My truth is, that world doesn't need me to balance its books.<eos> Matt Chambers, welcome to your last change of address.<eos> You'll like it here.<eos> You and your neighbors have so much in common.<eos> The worst thing about finally putting together a puzzle is finding there are missing pieces.<eos> He came back and left nothing behind but a message -<eos> Come find me.<eos> And I will.
I told Royce to dump him more than a year ago.<eos> But Clarence didn't want to piss off the ministers until after the primary.<eos> Primary's over.<eos> He can do it now.<eos> You think Clarence Royce is gonna do you that favor?<eos> He's already thinking about taking a poke at Elisha and running for the seventh district congressional seat.<eos> He's gonna need every black minister in town to lay hands upon him.<eos> Fine.<eos> I'll do it myself.<eos> No, you won't.
I don't believe a word you're saying.<eos> Yeah you do.<eos> My dad's dead.<eos> They said cancer, but...<eos> Then Warren turned on my mum and me.<eos> He said if I danced at his club, and was nice to some of his friends-<eos> - If you're spinning me another line-<eos> - Setting you up was my last job.<eos> He said if I did that, he'd let me go.<eos> But he never will, will he?
But did they take your picture when they booked you?<eos> You should leave.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> You don't have a choice.<eos> I'm sick of running,man.<eos> I...<eos> I just started to feel normal here.<eos> I started to feel safe.<eos> He said he would never stop looking.<eos> He won't.
It's just one dance, God!<eos> What?<eos> Well, we did promise them one dance.<eos> Yeah, sure, okay.<eos> So Andrew, what's your big plan?<eos> What's life going to be like after tonight?<eos> Well, you know I got it all worked out.<eos> Uh, leave this place in my dust, four awesome years at college, and then I'll move to Prague or start my own video game company or something.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - I won't?
Step the fuck off.<eos> Looking for your man Lex.<eos> I see his broom, but I don't see him.<eos> Where's your number two been at?<eos> - I ain't seen him.<eos> - Since when?<eos> I thought we were on better terms.<eos> Or do you want me rolling past Iookin' for Lex every 15 minutes?<eos> He come past, I'll call you.<eos> I will!
No!<eos> No.<eos> I am breaking up with you because on your very best day... that corpse is twice the man you will ever be.<eos> You're not good enough for me, Alex.<eos> You're not good enough for anyone.<eos> You two, you're not scrubbing in.<eos> Whatever's going on with you, I don't need it in my OR.<eos> - Fine.<eos> I'll watch from the gallery.<eos> - No, no, you won't.
It goes out on a minor chord.<eos> - Zach!<eos> - Yeah?<eos> Don't you have something else to say to Lane?<eos> Maybe something to ask her?<eos> Oh, right.<eos> Sorry, uh...<eos> Lane?<eos> Lane, will you marry me?<eos> Yes, Zach, I will.
It's a bad son of a bitch.<eos> I can't make the same moves<eos> If i'm worried about keeping you alive.<eos> You can't be as reckless.<eos> Look...<eos> I don't expect to make it out of this fight in one piece.<eos> Your mother's death...<eos> It almost killed me.<eos> I can't watch my children die, too.<eos> I won't.
So what good's it gonna do?<eos> It's not gonna bring him back, is it?<eos> - I'll tell you something, if you go to prison... if you go to prison, you will kill another man, because...<eos> I will die of a broken heart.<eos> Frank, do you really mean that?<eos> Do I?<eos> A man without a woman...<eos> Sheila Jackson will you do me the great thingy of being my wife?<eos> Oh, yes!<eos> Yes, course I will!
It's my lucky number.<eos> What about lymphoma?<eos> Causes kidney failure, GI bleed, and can infiltrate the base of the brain.<eos> You check Esther for that?<eos> She never showed any signs of...<eos> If he has lymphoma this far advanced, we should be able to see it in his blood and brain.<eos> Chase, run a blood smear and immunochemistries.<eos> Foreman, get an MRI.<eos> - I'll page Cuddy.<eos> - No, you won't.
I was just about to show it to you. Right.<eos> Go ahead.<eos> Um, now, there were a couple of stains on it, just probably from age, so I had to make a few minor adjustments, but I think you'll see, all in all, that the integrity of the dress has remained intact.<eos> Fine.<eos> How much do I owe you?<eos> Uh, nothing.<eos> Um, consider it a wedding gift. Okay.<eos> I have to go back to work.<eos> I will see you and Luke at the wedding.<eos> Yes, you will.
Unlike you, I cannot live alone without the warmth of human companionship.<eos> I roamed the world... then, returning one night to this cold, dark place...<eos> I saw this... this magical thing. You were in my path.<eos> Do you remember?<eos> And since that moment i have never wanted to leave the place that you were.<eos> Though you left, I remained, waiting for my little bird to return.<eos> We have to be together.<eos> We are like those twins, so intertwined in their senses and feelings that they can cry out to one another across continents, so close are their thoughts.<eos> I dare you.<eos> I will not.
Kyle's my best friend.<eos> I'm sorry, Stan, but unfortunately you live in a small-minded town filled with ignorant boobs.<eos> Well... Maybe they'll change.<eos> I wouldn't count on it.<eos> Come on, boys, get in the car!<eos> No!<eos> Maybe you can make a difference, Stan.<eos> Maybe you can get everyone to drive hybrid cars.<eos> Until that day, we're just gonna have to be with our own kind.<eos> I will.
It's yours.<eos> I want Andrew's room.<eos> You said he's probably not coming back.<eos> And I could use the extra closet space.<eos> But, sweetheart, this is his room.<eos> Mom, you forgot my birthday.<eos> You're really in no position to negotiate.<eos> Honey, where am I gonna put all of his things?<eos> And, you know, he might come back at some point.<eos> He won't.
What about you?<eos> We never saw you any more after you wore yourself out chasing your youth with a 'new girl'.<eos> Do you remember that cherry tree over at Inari Shrine?<eos> Yes.<eos> The only cherry tree in Yoshiwara.<eos> They say that ever since you were an attendant you've been saying you'd leave here when flowers grow on that tree.<eos> That was a little girl's dream.<eos> Why do you think that?<eos> I've given up hoping that tree will ever flower.<eos> And so now it never will.
Oh, thank God.<eos> I'm so sorry about this.<eos> Did you get ahold of your date?<eos> Yes.<eos> And was she okay about pushing it back?<eos> Yes.<eos> Because she's perfect.<eos> So what am I doing here?<eos> - You can never tell Marshall.<eos> - I won't.
Why did you kill them, Joe?<eos> My Ruth.<eos> She worked all her life in the castle.<eos> When she lay dying, where was the Sheriff?<eos> Did he come and visit?<eos> Did he send food?<eos> No.<eos> He sent Joderic because we hadn't paid our taxes.<eos> He put us out and she died like a dog on the street.<eos> And now, so will he.
- Like my dad has, little red spots here.<eos> What's it called, though?<eos> - I don't know. "The illness".<eos> Can you die of it?<eos> - Don't think so.<eos> But Yankel had it, too.<eos> And my dad, he wrote a letter.<eos> And he might be going away.<eos> And I don't know if he'll ever come back.<eos> - Of course he will.
- No chance.<eos> - Say it.<eos> - I do.<eos> - I do!<eos> I don't.<eos> Activate the particles.<eos> Purge every last one!<eos> And release!<eos> The secret heart unlocks and they will waken from their sleep of ages.<eos> Who will?
You know, I had such a great time with you last night.<eos> Listen, there's something I have to tell you.<eos> I just got back from the doctor.<eos> I have herpes.<eos> I think you should get yourself checked out.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - Will you stay?<eos> What?<eos> Will you stay with me, even knowing that I have herpes?<eos> Yes, I will.
Very... Really heavy crying.<eos> You know what?<eos> It's nothing. I cry all the time.<eos> It doesn't mean anything. It's... It's healthy actually.<eos> Oh, look.<eos> Look at this.<eos> It's chanel. Barbara made me buy it.<eos> It cost a fortune, But I can wear it to the opening.<eos> I'd really like to believe that.<eos> No, I will.
- I'll go get an MRI of his head.<eos> - Keep testing until you find something.<eos> I'm going to my office to rest for a while.<eos> It's been a long time since I took an anatomy class, but I'm pretty sure you're moving farther and farther away from my lungs.<eos> Running out of places to look, aren't you?<eos> Doesn't mean we're gonna stop looking.<eos> Mm, no, not for six more hours.<eos> - You want us to fail?<eos> - No.<eos> But you will.
I make sure he's sorry he was ever born.<eos> This place is 100% Art.<eos> Is that clear?<eos> Good.<eos> Now get the fuck out of my face.<eos> My dog.<eos> He threw her out of the van.<eos> I can't perform without her.<eos> She wants to, she'll find you.<eos> If not then she won't.
How'd you keep this out of the papers?<eos> It is important to me, Captain Leland Stottlemeyer.<eos> By the way, sorry about the divorce.<eos> I've been in real estate for 14 years, and I can smell divorce from 100 yards away.<eos> Who's couch are you sleeping on?<eos> Actually, I'm not sleeping on a couch.<eos> It's a futon.<eos> Thank you, Randy.<eos> Well, when you are ready for your own apartment, why don't you give me a call?<eos> - Maybe I will.
I deserve more than just being the girl you call when you need something.<eos> You really think you're gonna find the money in Utah?<eos> I don't care about the money in Utah!<eos> I don't want any more crime.<eos> I turn you in, I get $200,000.<eos> Legal money.<eos> You're the policemen's problem now.<eos> Nika...<eos> Don't come any closer or I'll shoot you!<eos> No, you won't.
This lighter doesn't work.<eos> I'll get in touch with you later.<eos> As if I didn't have enough problems.<eos> Ma'am, the lighter doesn't work.<eos> Where is it?<eos> If you don't mind, I must go.<eos> -First have some tea.<eos> -No, thanks.<eos> Don't forget your photos!<eos> I won't.
You all right?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Good.<eos> We're heading west, toward the money, toward LJ.<eos> We just got one more stop to make.<eos> What for?<eos> You trust me?<eos> Of course I trust you, Brad.<eos> It's just that if anybody finds out about this, I...<eos> They won't.
I'll do it for you.<eos> Father Job, Forgive me, an old fool.<eos> - Forgive me the soot and Cain and this sideboard.<eos> - It is OK.<eos> - Forgive me for Christ's sake.<eos> - Let bygones be bygones.<eos> - You pardon me.<eos> - I've been unjust to you.<eos> - Pardon me for Christ's sake.<eos> - God will.
Phone book.<eos> Took all night.<eos> But I found him.<eos> Paid him a visit this morning, put the fear of God into him.<eos> What did you find?<eos> His medical records.<eos> He's claustrophobic, paranoid, depressive, got a couple of recorded attempts of suicide.<eos> He's barely left his house in years.<eos> Look Owen, if Jack finds out...<eos> Well, he won't, will he?
- Get her back?<eos> Back from what?<eos> - The spirit we're hunting, it took her.<eos> - My God.<eos> - She'll be okay. I promise.<eos> - You promise?<eos> That is not the first time I've heard that from a Winchester.<eos> - What?<eos> - If anything happens to her-<eos> It won't.
- Let's go.<eos> Hello?<eos> Is anybody there?<eos> Your name's Theresa?<eos> Yes.<eos> This won't make you feel better, but I'm here to rescue you.<eos> Oh, God.<eos> He's out there.<eos> He's gonna kill us.<eos> No, he won't.
The water's cold.<eos> Good for colds.<eos> It's freezing!<eos> Too cold!<eos> Time went by, the World Cup was upon us and no sign of my parents.<eos> I suffered every day at breakfast and dinner at Shlomo's place.<eos> You're your dad's spitting image!<eos> But at least now lunch was somewhere different every day.<eos> - Leave the boy alone.<eos> - I will not!
- So they're not shipping you overseas?<eos> - Nope.<eos> I'm gonna stay here and let them test their laser-guided super weapons on me.<eos> Like that one.<eos> Don't worry, Dad.<eos> You'll do great.<eos> Okay, these are war games, and I'm head of my team.<eos> I have to think like a great military leader.<eos> Ah, stay crunchy in milk.<eos> I will!
Em...yeah.<eos> He does.<eos> Quite a Iot.<eos> He's become a...<eos> Sorry.<eos> A hero.<eos> A bit of a hero.<eos> - Is it him?<eos> - We don't know.<eos> Maybe Jamie will.
- Do me a favour.<eos> - You've got to come in.<eos> - Arrest Peacock.<eos> - She's going crazy as it is.<eos> - Arrest him.<eos> - What for?<eos> - For Fairstone's murder.<eos> - I Iike my job.<eos> I don't want to lose it.<eos> - You won't.
Now it's my turn.<eos> Hey, Sean.<eos> - We need to talk.<eos> - About Matt, I know.<eos> He's adamant about giving me his kidney.<eos> I'm afraid he's going to leave it on my doorstep in a gift-wrapped cooler.<eos> You don't need Matt's kidney.<eos> Because I'm going to give you mine.<eos> That is very sweet, Sean, but I think that we're both gonna feel a little silly when my body rejects it.<eos> It won't.
- Don't compare me with her<eos> - Enough<eos> Calm down, you two are being childish<eos> You don't do well therefore you're criticized by Rina<eos> You have brought shame to us<eos> It will be more effective if we are practising ourselves<eos> We can't compromise with those low standard persons<eos> Is that it?<eos> Why don't you just leave us alone?<eos> We will
And, look, the good news is, Mommy's fine now.<eos> And we'll all see Auntie Nora again in heaven.<eos> Or wherever.<eos> - Did they let you keep the bullet?<eos> - No. I'm afraid not.<eos> That blows.<eos> We wanted to bring it for show and tell.<eos> Hey, sweetheart, you OK?<eos> What if the crazy lady comes back?<eos> She won't.
They can have one snack.<eos> Try and push apples. But if they threaten violence, I have an emergency candy bar under the sink.<eos> - Not anymore, you don't.<eos> - Oh, jeez.<eos> Mommy, where are you going?<eos> - To the market.<eos> - No.<eos> Hey, sweetie, it's a different market.<eos> - You're gonna get shot again.<eos> - No, I won't.
Ok, should be enough<eos> Where to?<eos> Two tickets to Taipei<eos> I wanted to ask you...<eos> Don't peak, go away!<eos> Sorry, sorry, sorry...<eos> I just wanted to ask<eos> What?<eos> What if our school finds out?<eos> They won't
Are we keeping you comfortable?<eos> Very comfortable.<eos> And I'm very grateful to you, Dr. McNamara.<eos> I know your partner was against the surgery, but you saw the poetry in my situation.<eos> What's her name?<eos> Julia.<eos> Julia.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you'll fall in love again.<eos> I won't.
Okay, who reports to who?<eos> I don¡¯t care!<eos> Dwight, you all report to me.<eos> That¡¯s all that matters.<eos> The rest of is just work it out amongst yourselves, okay?<eos> - And, then if I want...<eos> - Work it out amongst yourselves!<eos> I have company to run.<eos> Will you let me run the company?<eos> - Will you?
Excuse me.<eos> - Are you the parents of Annie McNamara?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Could you come with me, please?<eos> - What's going on?<eos> Your daughter has been arrested for stealing painkillers from the hospital pharmacy.<eos> - Annie...<eos> - Save it, okay?<eos> I'll get my own lawyer, he'll get me probation again, and don't worry about the bail money.<eos> No, you won't.
- I said stop!<eos> Man, what a tough brat.<eos> So then...<eos> Come to the sewage construction site tonight.<eos> Are you the boss?<eos> Why are you acting like the boss?<eos> Then ... please tell him again, boss.<eos> Know where it is, right?<eos> Meet us there.<eos> I won't.

That's...good.<eos> You always had a way with words.<eos> Wow. I should be going because I have to meet Victor.<eos> I'm really happy for you and Victor.<eos> You're really happy for me and Victor?<eos> I can tell you guys are enjoying what was the best part of our relationship.<eos> - Passion for science.<eos> You're such a dork, Reed.<eos> You never got it,<eos> -and you never will...
Or what hand will guide us there.<eos> A king may move a man.<eos> A father may claim a son.<eos> That man can also move himself, and only then does that man truly begin his own game.<eos> Remember, howsoever you are played, or by whom, your soul is in your keeping alone.<eos> Even though those who presume to play you be kings or men of power.<eos> When you stand before God, you cannot say, "But I was told by others to do thus", or that virtue "was not convenient at the time".<eos> This will not suffice.<eos> Remember that.<eos> I will.
I'd prefer not to be hanged before my wife is queen.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> "Who but Reynald", they'll say.<eos> It's always me.<eos> They'll believe it in Jerusalem.<eos> - You were at Nazareth, praying.<eos> - You're a dangerous man.<eos> If the war's to be now or later, I would have it now.<eos> - How long can the leper last?<eos> - God wills it.
- You were a beautiful boy.<eos> - Yes.<eos> You've always been beautiful.<eos> In every way.<eos> My beautiful sister.<eos> I've missed you.<eos> So beautiful.<eos> I'm sorry if I've caused you any pain.<eos> Remember me as I was.<eos> I will.
- You go with the army?<eos> - My order is with the army.<eos> - You go to certain death.<eos> - All death is certain.<eos> I shall tell your father what I've seen you become.<eos> ..cogner ici<eos> Ma fille, c'est le charpentier Qui raccomode...<eos> When Saladin comes... we're not defensible.<eos> Save the people from what I have done.<eos> I will.
Jimmy, let's go.<eos> Come on. Okay.<eos> Go.<eos> Just as you go down... for the third and final time... as your head disappears beneath the waves... and your lungs fill with water... do you know what happens in those last precious seconds before you drown?<eos> Come on, buddy.<eos> Get up the rope.<eos> Come on. Get out of here. Come on.<eos> Your whole life passes before your eyes.<eos> And if you've lived as a true American... you get to watch it all in color.<eos> Oh, and you will.
Where's Aslan?<eos> What have they done?<eos> Aslan.<eos> But we saw the knife.<eos> The Witch. If the Witch knew the true meaning of sacrifice... she might have interpreted the Deep Magic differently.<eos> That when a willing victim who has committed no treachery... is killed in a traitor's stead... the Stone Table will crack... and even death itself will turn backwards.<eos> We sent the news that you were dead.<eos> Peter and Edmund will have gone to war.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will, dear one, but not alone.
You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you.<eos> Until then, Willy Wonka. "<eos> The 1st of February.<eos> - But that's tomorrow.<eos> - Then there's not a moment to lose.<eos> Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.<eos> - And get that mud off your pants.<eos> - Now we must all try and keep very calm.<eos> First thing that we have to decide is this: Who is going with Charlie to the factory?<eos> I will.
- I couldn't find any mob bosses.<eos> - Well, sergeant?<eos> - It's "lieutenant" now.<eos> You really started something.<eos> Bent cops running scared.<eos> Hope on the streets.<eos> - But?<eos> - The Narrows is lost.<eos> And we still haven't picked up Crane or half the inmates of Arkham that he freed.<eos> We will.
Well, she'll be here soon.<eos> She's on her way.<eos> I want Mommy.<eos> Yeah, I know you do.<eos> Your mommy wants to be with you too.<eos> So where is she?<eos> She went home.<eos> She didn't think that you were gonna wake up so soon.<eos> I wanna go home too.<eos> Well, you will.
Things are going to get much, much worse.<eos> Thanks for taking us in again, Shepherd.<eos> You got a plan?<eos> Hiding ain't a plan?<eos> It'll do you for a spell.<eos> And the folks here'll be glad of the extra coin.<eos> But the Alliance will be coming.<eos> They're after this girl with a powerful will.<eos> I look to hear the tromp of their boots any moment.<eos> You won't.
It won't do.<eos> There's no use in trying it on, Fagin.<eos> What do you mean by that?<eos> What I say.<eos> Why, you're just the very person for it.<eos> Nobody about here knows anything about you.<eos> And as I don't want them to neither.<eos> It's rather more "no" than "yes" with me, Bill.<eos> She'll go, Fagin.<eos> No, she won't, Fagin.

I'll get you some juice.<eos> Can you help?<eos> I said I'd coach the girl's team.<eos> Well, we really could use you at the factory now, too.<eos> Your mom's having a real hard time with this. And she's already short handed.<eos> Oh, jeez.<eos> I...<eos> I don't know.<eos> What's to know?<eos> You either will or you won't.
I never seen anybody get dressed that fast.<eos> Case, I'm so sorry.<eos> -Maybe I'll just die alone after all.<eos> -No, you won't.<eos> You'll meet a great guy with a great smile... and you'll travel the world together.<eos> Who are you?<eos> Where's my best friend?<eos> It's true.<eos> He just hasn't found you yet.<eos> But he will.
You start.<eos> Well, maybe I would if you weren't snarling.<eos> What if I told you...<eos> that I know exactly what you do and how you do it?<eos> And I think it's despicable!<eos> You know what?<eos> We might need to go out to dinner.<eos> There's a great seafood restaurant I'd love to take you to.<eos> How about you just get a cleaver, butcher?<eos> -Maybe I will !
Mommy and lots of brothers and sisters.<eos> What if they don't know where he is?<eos> Your baby is here!<eos> Better?<eos> Looks hurt.<eos> Maybe it was a cat.<eos> What if he's scared?<eos> Then we'll be right inside, and I will not take my mind off him.<eos> Me too.<eos> I won't either.
Thought you were land-based.<eos> Actually amphibious.<eos> Well, that will depend.<eos> On what?<eos> Thank you very much for a delicious dinner and a lovely time.<eos> Now bow.<eos> -Thank you.<eos> It was our pleasure. -Yeah.<eos> I'll stop by tomorrow. I never got any dirt out of you.<eos> And she will.
-No. No.<eos> That 's another thing.<eos> Miss Silken says I say strange things.<eos> Well, perhaps that is because she's having a hard time keeping up.<eos> Miss Silken says mine was one of the best in the class.<eos> One of the best?<eos> Only four other students got both a smiley face and a gold star.<eos> Well, whoopie.<eos> Won't you hang it on the refrigerator?<eos> No, I won't.
You know, I got to thank you all... for helping me to understand what my heritage is.<eos> You see, the Wydells, they've always been vigilante justice.<eos> Now, my granddaddy, he rode with the likes of T om Horn, killing scum like you for a living.<eos> We've always been devil slayers.<eos> Wake up!<eos> See I tried to walk the line, but now I realize there is no line.<eos> We here, we are playing on a level that most will never see.<eos> I know my brother George, he didn't see it.<eos> Maybe he had a divine moment when his brains hit the floor.<eos> Yeah, well, maybe you will too.
So I went a little nuts. I made pancakes with white flour.<eos> Can you believe summer's over?<eos> We're wasting our lives here.<eos> - Heard you landed a double.<eos> - Tiff!<eos> - Well?<eos> That took me two years.<eos> - Really?<eos> - So I guess we'll see you then?<eos> - No, you won't.
It's unacceptable.<eos> I don't believe this!<eos> You will be busy training.<eos> And four college courses.<eos> Four?<eos> Are you out of your mind, with everything she's doing?<eos> All right, two.<eos> But then four in the fall.<eos> Only if she wins sectionals.<eos> Oh, she will.
I was just off the 16th green in two, and he was buried in the bunker.<eos> Ginny's been working so hard on the Junior League charity Ball.<eos> How marvelous.<eos> - You've got to help with the committee.<eos> Of course I will.
My God, I'm gonna need so much therapy.<eos> What did you just say? - I said that Blake is not my biological son, nor is he adopted.<eos> My first wife, cynthia, wanted to have children of her own.<eos> I, of course, could not do that for her, so we used an alternative method.<eos> A donor.<eos> - A donor?<eos> A donor.<eos> So technically Blake is not my son but we chose never to tell him that.<eos> I would appreciate if you would do the same.<eos> Of course I won't.
Save yourself and your buddies a ton of grief.<eos> You're a sassy little thing.<eos> You ain't hardly in any kind of position to be making threats.<eos> The trap is set, locked and ready to spring.<eos> So what?<eos> They're scum. They deserve what's coming.<eos> So why this rotten feeling in my gut that something is awfully wrong?<eos> They haven't killed anybody I know about.<eos> It got pretty bad at Shellie's place, but they didn't kill anybody.<eos> And they won't.
That sounds nice.<eos> Okay.<eos> My goodness.<eos> I think we better get back to work.<eos> Yeah. Yeah, I better go back to work.<eos> Yeah.<eos> So, okay.<eos> All right.<eos> So, you mull it over and I'll talk to you soon.<eos> All right, I will.
I'll give you my number. For...?<eos> I don't know.<eos> If the dress doesn't fit, you can call me.<eos> No, I don't know.<eos> I've always dreamed of doing that but I never dared.<eos> With you, I thought I should dare.<eos> Take it, 'cause I feel like a jerk.<eos> I'll jot it down.<eos> But you have to call tonight.<eos> Or you never will.
Nobody can recognize him.<eos> Except you.<eos> Nobody.<eos> That was your rendezvous at the station.<eos> - He's not involved.<eos> - Okay.<eos> Since you want to play the hero.<eos> - We won't make it.<eos> - Yes, we will.<eos> We won't.
You got mashed potatoes?<eos> We ain't got mashed potatoes today.<eos> That's Tuesdays and Thursdays.<eos> But I'll tell you what, have a seat right here...<eos> We've got macaroni and cheese and I want you to help yourself. OK?<eos> You're talking awful loud ma'am. Are you deaf?<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> That's right.<eos> Now you've got to show him where everything is.<eos> All right, I will.
- You called!<eos> - So?<eos> - I got flustered.<eos> I was all set, then I felt guilty about saying I was in Greece.<eos> - You said Sardinia.<eos> - I was talking fast.<eos> I didn't want her to know.<eos> - She has to eventually.<eos> - I can't tell her.<eos> - Then I will.
- We should have bet another $200.<eos> Come on, let's go get a drink.<eos> The next day some of the others asked if we would place bets for them.<eos> Hank, we have to take their bets.<eos> Manny, those guys haven't got any money.<eos> Only the coffee and chewing gum money that their wives give them.<eos> We can't waste time at the 2-dollar windows.<eos> We're not going to bet their money, we're going to keep their money.<eos> - Suppose they win?<eos> - They won't.
They let you hide, don't they?<eos> So safe.<eos> I heard how your voice changed when the camera came between us.<eos> My voice changed because I felt sick, because you drugged me.<eos> Yeah, you were drugged, all right.<eos> And the drug was sweet, little 14-year-old flesh.<eos> Look, I'm a decent guy.<eos> Ask anyone.<eos> Go ahead. Call these models. They'll tell you.<eos> Of course they will.
Are you still here?<eos> - I'm on my way out.<eos> Did you know Zlatan?<eos> Tragic death.<eos> - Yes.<eos> I want you to interview me now.<eos> You promised me.<eos> Another day, Arne.<eos> - You'll forget.<eos> I won't.
Could you bring me a towel please?<eos> Listen, Marc I wouldn't be opposed. But we're very late.<eos> Is this too sexy for my goddaughter's birthday party?<eos> Still, they might enjoy seeing me dressed as a whore.<eos> Do you like it?<eos> You haven't said.<eos> Yes, I like it.<eos> Shit, just missed that spot.<eos> We'll never find another one.<eos> - Sure, we will.
"..imagination and for...."<eos> - For imagination and then what?<eos> For imagination and....<eos> Originality breaking the boundaries between dance and sport.<eos> Not bad.<eos> Right.<eos> And for originality breaking the boundaries between.. ..dance and sport.<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> It's not going to work.<eos> Yes, it will.
You're more disappointed than us.<eos> It's not that.<eos> Don't want to live like this anymore.<eos> Anyhow, she's doing the right thing.<eos> You were hoping for a change too.<eos> Well! It's normal...<eos> More than us.<eos> You did too.<eos> Will you come to see me, Lucien?<eos> I will.
- The baby was exploding!<eos> You ever sit an exploding baby before, Mr Dicker?<eos> - What's that?<eos> - Have you told anyone about this?<eos> - Your parents?<eos> - They thought I was being funny.<eos> But you believe me, don't you, Mr Dicker?<eos> - Sure, kid.<eos> - I wish I could forget the whole thing.<eos> You will, kid.

Your blood must get warm.<eos> We got to go. They might return.<eos> Do you feel better?<eos> - A little.<eos> Did you get warm?<eos> - My foot, here.<eos> Keep going. I'm gonna bring the motorbike.<eos> Wait!<eos> You're going to leave with the money!<eos> - I won't.
(Boushh speaking in Ubese)<eos> Right.<eos> We'll take it from here.<eos> Let's go.<eos> It's clear the feeling is mutual.<eos> Taryn Anwar.<eos> You are her eby under arrest for treasonous acts against the Empire.<eos> Now, Sergeant, I'm sure you can understand why I can't accompany you.<eos> I can shoot you here.<eos> But you won't.
Hot, hot, smokin' hot.<eos> Been doing those gags for 18 years.<eos> I made them mine.<eos> They're my trademark.<eos> But my son wanted to ride an elephant.<eos> And I wanted to try my act in Edo.<eos> What's with you?<eos> You feel OK?<eos> You gotta pee?<eos> I won't.
You'll pass the military test in 4 years.<eos> I will?<eos> Let me assure you.<eos> You're to be a great general.<eos> I'll become a general?<eos> Not in a million years.<eos> Forget it.<eos> I mean it.<eos> Cut it out.<eos> You will.
You saw me. We both left at the same time.<eos> My taxi got late.<eos> You were in the hallway.<eos> If you had been in the kitchen.<eos> If my taxi had been on time, or further back.<eos> If my sister hadn't borrowed my car... If I hadn't gone to the party...<eos> Too many things brought us here together.<eos> Are you going to call me?<eos> What do you think?<eos> That you won't.
Over.<eos> Sadýk is here!<eos> Over.<eos> What?<eos> Over.<eos> Take Salim and the kids and come to the dinner.<eos> Over.<eos> Shall I call my aunt?<eos> Over.<eos> I will.
Thanks You're not so bad, honey<eos> She owns the tobacco shop<eos> Meeting's nice...<eos> Oh, "Nice to meet you"<eos> No need to adjust your dialect<eos> You should cherish your regional idiom<eos> Off I go<eos> Mommy!<eos> Will the TV come today?<eos> No, it won't
You start right away.<eos> Uh, these letters?<eos> Everyone knows i can heal now.<eos> Jordan had every intention of revealing your healing ability to the public, but he was planning on doing it in stages.<eos> We don't have that luxury anymore.<eos> We'll deal with it.<eos> I can't go outside anymore.<eos> There's sick people.<eos> The press, they follow me everywhere.<eos> And they will for the rest of your life.
He's nothing.<eos> He's a big.angry nothing.<eos> and that's exactly what he wants me to be.<eos> and I can't let that happen.<eos> Now.goddamn it.do something!<eos> It's no good.is it?<eos> There's nothing there.<eos> I'm sorry.Greg. not everybody's meant to be an artist or a musician.<eos> You'll find a place.<eos> Sure I will.
[Narrator] Michael decided that perhaps he should go after Sally.<eos> Have you seen my other pair of pants?<eos> Lupe washed them, and they sprouted.<eos> I threw them out.<eos> Well, that puts a lot of pressure on this pair.<eos> I think this one's good.<eos> Looks like it would've put up a fight.<eos> - I put up one to get it.<eos> - As long as it gets Frank Wrench to bid on me.<eos> - It won't.
Maybe sometime we can have dinner?<eos> Could I see your house?<eos> Michael was caught off guard by the question.<eos> No, no, I-I can't do that.<eos> Okay, bye-bye.<eos> Uh... bye.<eos> And he vowed not to be caught off guard again.<eos> I didn't mean that...<eos> So did he invite you over, then?<eos> Not yet, but he will.
There is no way to misterpret that.<eos> Except the one.<eos> And a traumatized Steve Holt needs a father.<eos> I've made a huge mistake.<eos> I know the feeling.<eos> I had you.<eos> I'm your father, Steve Holt!<eos> I can't hide from it anymore.<eos> I won't forget this... Dad.<eos> I will.
- Never lost a single case.<eos> - You've never lost?<eos> My record is 6,043 to 0.<eos> Ever hear the one about the fella who died, went to the pearly gates?<eos> St. Peter let him in. Sees a guy in a suit making a closing argument.<eos> Says, "Who's that?" St. Peter says... "Oh, that's God.<eos> Thinks he's Denny Crane."<eos> I'm your boy, Walter.<eos> Never lost.<eos> Never will.
I can't be beat. Really?<eos> - Never lost, never will.<eos> - I beat you in the salmon case.<eos> You beat Brad Chase. Me:<eos> Undefeated. I see.<eos> Well, how do I put this?<eos> I took this case mainly to kick your fat, lying ass.<eos> I mean that in a good way.<eos> I will beat you.<eos> - No, you won't.
And without a father figure, poor mindy will grow up to be a stripper.<eos> A stripper?<eos> There's science to back that up.<eos> You know what?<eos> You go ahead and push the button on this day care thing, Lynette, and count Mindy in.<eos> Yeah,I'll handle Fran.<eos> You're doing the right thing, Ed, for little Mindy.<eos> yeah.<eos> dude,what if your mom walks in?<eos> She won't.
Well, now we have something to talk about.<eos> - Me?<eos> - Yes.<eos> How you're trying to blackmail me into sleeping with you.<eos> - I wonder how he'll react.<eos> - Mrs. Solis...<eos> You think he'll get violent?<eos> - You can't talk to John about that.<eos> - Oh, I can.<eos> And I will, you little worthless piece of crap.
Yeah, like it's not weird in there.<eos> Oh, my God.<eos> I've got to go, I can't keep them waiting.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> Say goodbye to Steve for me.<eos> Bye!<eos> Good riddance.<eos> You're talking like you'll never see her again.<eos> She's only going upstairs.<eos> We won't.
Give me back Mercury.<eos> Go ahead, you can have it.<eos> But I brought Earth into this project, so it's rightfully mine.<eos> Hey, where's my Earth?<eos> It got burned up by the sun.<eos> You know what?<eos> I'm gonna get another partner, then we're gonna finish this and slaughter you.<eos> - Yeah, I'm going to get one too.<eos> - Go ahead.<eos> I will!
- What, you got a date?<eos> - Yes. Yes, I do.<eos> A handsome man is whisking me away to a love nest for the weekend.<eos> You got shot in the line of duty?<eos> First month on the job.<eos> Can you believe my luck?<eos> Guy pulls a gun and I freeze up.<eos> The rookie who let himself get shot.<eos> - I'm never gonna live this down.<eos> - Sure, you will.
Nobody works on the elevator.<eos> I have an open chest and a very nervous intern in there.<eos> Keep them back.<eos> - OK, guys, we're not going... - O'Malley?<eos> Dr. Burke, I didn't cut the heart or the lungs.<eos> Good, good, O'Malley.<eos> Really good.<eos> Now, check for injuries and do a pericardiotomy.<eos> I'll need some lap pads, forceps, Metzenbaums and Satinsky clamps?<eos> Yes, you will.
Emily's strong, she won't let go of my finger.<eos> Hey, Julie has her organs on the outside of her body and she's still alive, thank you.<eos> Kate's the best one.<eos> - lzzie.<eos> - Leave.<eos> Can we please just talk?<eos> You're too busy screwing nurses to talk.<eos> Just get out.<eos> Can someone make sure - that Kate's vitals remain stable?<eos> - I will.
You just don't want to deal with the epidemic.<eos> That's right.<eos> I'm subjecting a 12-year-old to a battery of dangerous and evasive tests to avoid being bored.<eos> Okay, maybe I would do that, but I'm not.<eos> If it turns out she does have meningitis, you're right, you win, but if we go back downstairs and she dies... your face will be so red.<eos> You have one hour.<eos> Get a lumbar puncture.<eos> Some brain infections can be pretty clever at hide-and-seek.<eos> - I'll get on her bloodwork.<eos> - No you won't.
You're going to kill my husband to teach me a lesson?<eos> No, he's going to die because he's too stubborn to make the right choice.<eos> Now we're in your territory.<eos> I'm respecting your husband's decision, I don't see why you've got a problem with that.<eos> Because it's crap!<eos> Because you browbeat patients, intimidate them, lie to them.<eos> If you think you're right you don't give a damn what they think.<eos> I did what you do all the time, the only difference is I did it to you.<eos> He'll never forgive you.<eos> Yeah, he will.
Have you been down to Floorgasm?<eos> - What is it?<eos> - A club.<eos> Loads of ladies.<eos> Loads of bustin' tunes.<eos> - I like music.<eos> - It'll be a laugh.<eos> Come out clubbing.<eos> OK, yeah.<eos> OK, I will, yeah.
Whatever!<eos> - I am not helping you with it.<eos> - Whatever.<eos> You know what, Dennis?<eos> We don't need her.<eos> - You're right. We don't need her.<eos> What we'll do is we'll find a girl for Charlie tonight in the bar.<eos> - Yes.<eos> - No, you won't.<eos> - Yes, we will.
Is that you and I know what the real deal is.<eos> We saw it the first time we laid eyes on each other.<eos> Bette.<eos> I just wanted to tell you that -<eos> I know.<eos> I know.<eos> This doesn't mean... we're back together.<eos> I know.<eos> Let's not let it mess everything up.<eos> It won't.
He's just really shy.<eos> Hey, little man.<eos> Oh, I guess I can't call you that.<eos> I mean, 'cause look how big you are.<eos> So... you and I, we're not gonna see each other for awhile, Walt.<eos> Uh, but you are gonna have a great life.<eos> I know your mommy-- she's gonna take real good care of you, and Brian is... gonna take good care of you, too.<eos> But you know what?<eos> I just want you to know that no matter where you go, I... that your daddy... yeah, your daddy-- he loves you very, very much.<eos> And I always will.
Just forget about it, okay?<eos> How much weight can this hold?<eos> I don't know.<eos> A lot.<eos> Enough.<eos> Yeah, yeah.<eos> Tighter.<eos> Got it.<eos> What if it tips over?<eos> It won't.
Some of his personal stuff.<eos> And four 9 millimeters with a few boxes of ammo.<eos> Guns.<eos> Guns.<eos> So, where is the case now?<eos> Sawyer has it.<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> He hasn't been able to open it, but...<eos> - Lucky for us.<eos> - He will.
No.<eos> That<eos> - That's him.<eos> That's my client.<eos> You burst in to take a picture of a man in bed with his own wife?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> I made a mistake. I'm human.<eos> So, the bottom line is I was at the hospital when the jewelry thing was happening.<eos> - You can call them.<eos> - We will.
- It was erotica.<eos> Tasteful, at times.<eos> You're in quite a bind.<eos> See, I knew it.<eos> I knew that you would react this way.<eos> Absolutely no sympathy.<eos> And this from a man who kept an illegitimate child hidden-<eos> It's all right.<eos> I'll pay the money.<eos> - You will?
I don't.<eos> I guess the key is, just finding someone who feels the same way you do.<eos> In 1955, students at Tree Hill High School created a time capsule which was to be opened in fifty years.<eos> They were simply asked to talk about their lives.<eos> Isn't it interesting how things haven't changed much?<eos> Within the next week, each of you will go into our converted supply closet... push the green button in front of you... and videotape your thoughts.<eos> Do we have to?<eos> Yes, you have to.<eos> I won't see it.<eos> Nobody will.
What do you mean? CouIdn't put my finger on it till he went outside.<eos> Then I knew. - He had that look. - What look?<eos> (Leticia) Like they own the place, Iike they're untouchable,<eos> like they're government.<eos> (Veronica) So the government paid lincoln's debt?<eos> - Did Crab say what they wanted in return?<eos> AII right.<eos> Just give me a moment to type this up.<eos> - Where are you going? - To have a smoke. - This is only gonna take me a minute.<eos> - So will the smoke.
Mother forgives me?<eos> What if I don't forgive?<eos> Whatever you think she may have done, consider the possibility she did it out of love for you.<eos> I'll never forgive her.<eos> Be that as it may, your forgiveness is irrelevant.<eos> You must come home.<eos> I'm sorry, I will not.<eos> I don't want to use force.<eos> The priests will protect me.<eos> They won't.
Me stomach's doing somersaults here!<eos> You filthy, scummy, bone-idle little shite!<eos> Hey, no, come on.<eos> Cut it out, Dad, you'll break me neck!<eos> Two minutes after you were born, they let me cut the cord.<eos> One of the proudest moments of my life.<eos> If I'd known what a fucking heretic you'd be, I'd have let you bleed to death right there!<eos> Dad!<eos> When your mother died, she made me promise I'd take care of you.<eos> So I will!
Admit it, you've fostered a pansy.<eos> Lip?<eos> What'sup,youfuckingpansy?<eos> No joy?<eos> It's only a matter of time. lt'll be OK.<eos> - What if it all turns bad, Steve?<eos> - lt won't.<eos> You nicked a copper's car!<eos> If they catch you, they'll screw you.<eos> - They won't.
Off you go, you two.<eos> Pint, please.<eos> A pint of what, Sheila?<eos> Just a pint.<eos> I'm not serving you, Frank.<eos> More than my job's worth.<eos> Christ's sake, give me the fucking Oscar.<eos> Come on, a quick one.<eos> Jess will never know.<eos> No, but they will.
It must be administered directly into the heart... to be carried through the bloodstream effectively.<eos> Clark, are you all right?<eos> Lana?<eos> I'm sorry it has to be this way, Clark.<eos> But we don't always get to choose who we are.<eos> Sometimes our destiny leads us to places that we don't wanna go.<eos> And there's nothing we can do about it.<eos> - Lana, no.<eos> - I love you, Clark.<eos> I always will.
Look, it won't take long. I'll be in and out.<eos> The quickest way to figure out what is going on in there is to to tap into the system and communicate directly with the Captain!<eos> Need I remind you of the obvious value in this?<eos> But is it safe?<eos> Would I be volunteering to go if it wasn't?<eos> No.<eos> Which is exactly what makes it safe enough for me to go.<eos> What?<eos> Better to have you on the outside, in case something goes wrong.<eos> - It won't!
Well, what do I do? Nothing?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Oh, brilliant.<eos> Stay warm, stay breathing, stay alive as long as you can.<eos> Give your team the biggest window of opportunity possible.<eos> A window of opportunity for what?<eos> For rescuing you.<eos> Even if they could find me, which, given underwater currents and multiple possible entry sites, is next to impossible, how are they going to get me out of here?<eos> They'll find a way.<eos> No, they won't.
And Oren.<eos> - Pleased to meet you.<eos> - The harvest is still months away.<eos> - Yes, I know.<eos> We have not come to trade, but to deliver a warning.<eos> We have reason to believe the Wraith may be on their way.<eos> We don't know that for a fact, but we're about to go and find out.<eos> Yes, it seems they're awakening everywhere.<eos> You should tell your people to take precautions in case they do come.<eos> I will.
You're the one saying,"I love you," smack ! "I love you," smack !<eos> You little tease !<eos> So you see, mr.<eos> I mean, what is sexier than a little bit of mystery ?<eos> Well, according to my research, naked boobies.<eos> All right, look, ratings are down, and I think this could really help.<eos> Well, I'm not gonna strip for a radio advertisement.<eos> It's demeaning.<eos> I'll do it.<eos> You will ?
Jackie, he's a man.<eos> Accept the fact that he is not coming back.<eos> When I was in labor, Red went to get me ice chips.<eos> I didn't see him for an hour and a half because he found a pinball machine.<eos> No way.<eos> But it's fine.<eos> Ha.<eos> I laugh about it now.<eos> I do.<eos> I will.
Yeah, I love catholic schoolgirls.<eos> They don't teach sex ed, so they don't know what not to do.<eos> Yeah, maybe.<eos> Uh, but I never really got together with any of 'em.<eos> Wait, you never...<eos> Okay, wait, wait, wait.<eos> Everyone, wait.<eos> Before you start in on him, let me just say, when I was a virgin, all I wanted was for one person to say it was okay.<eos> And no one did.<eos> - Neither will I.
-I don't think so.<eos> -They had weapons of mass destruction.<eos> There were no weapons of mass destruction!<eos> No?<eos> Well, whatever.<eos> Look, I got a lot of shit to do.<eos> Name me one thing you have to do that's more important than the corporate takeover of our democracy.<eos> I gotta take a shit.<eos> -You gotta help me, man.<eos> -I will. I will.
Ho!<eos> Daywalkers!<eos> This is all a bunch of crap!<eos> Mrs. Garrison, I'm really havin' a difficult time with all these interruptions...<eos> Kyle, let Eric give his presentation.<eos> It's not a presentation, it's a hate speech!<eos> People aren't creeped out by gingers!<eos> I am.<eos> Kyle, if you wanna debate Eric, you can do so with your paper tomorrow!<eos> Fine, I will.
Who is that woman?<eos> Chae-rin!<eos> Episode 3<eos> Chae-rin!<eos> When you said you could never come back to me again, is this why?<eos> Do you really have to get married?<eos> There were so many reasons why I should have gotten married while there was no longer a reason not to... that's why I did.<eos> Are you sure you won't regret it?<eos> I don't regret it now...<eos> and I won't in the future.
Ye<eos> - Oh, yes.<eos> Thank you. No, I found my birth control pills.<eos> Thanks for asking, Dad.<eos> [Narrator] Maeby had had enough ofher mother... and decided to go back with Michael.<eos> I'm so sick of her.<eos> The lame flirting.<eos> [Narrator] Michael, of course, thought Maeby was referring to Ann.<eos> I think he's gonna get sick of her before it goes too far.<eos> Of course he will.
- Oh, hey, Gangy.<eos> - Hi.<eos> - D-plus.<eos> Sign this.<eos> - This is a D-minus.<eos> - Either way, it's above a "D," right?<eos> - Another world-beater.<eos> And Lindsay realized she needed to take a firmer hand with her daughter.<eos> - I'm not signing this.<eos> - Fine. I will.
- What happened to the lights?<eos> - Isn't this better?<eos> Doesn't this just wanna make you curl up and forget about the world?<eos> Lindsay, we need the light so that people...<eos> - Where are these people going?<eos> - I'm taking them out to lunch.<eos> Did you reserve a restaurant?<eos> - Are they taking their own cars?<eos> - They'll figure something out.<eos> No, they won't.
- Oh, I couldn't deal with all that.<eos> Can you imagine?<eos> All the shouting and the blaming.<eos> No, be very messy.<eos> No, now, listen.<eos> Oi, you don't tell him.<eos> - Don't you ever tell him.<eos> - No.<eos> - No, Manny, I mean it.<eos> - I won't.

I've been unluckier than a ginger stepchild this last couple of weeks.<eos> Maybe my dreams got too big or the town got too small.<eos> Maybe I just messed up.<eos> I could sing "Don't Let the Sun Go Down on Me"<eos> but seeing as our Danny's just come out it might not be wise.<eos> One thing I have found out, though...<eos> I love my girl.<eos> And I love my lad.<eos> And I love my wife.<eos> And I always will.
- What are you doing?<eos> - I'm designing these shirts now - that are selling like hotcakes.<eos> - Are you kidding?<eos> - Interesting, whimsical.<eos> I'm telling...<eos> - Good for her.<eos> I got them in the trunk.<eos> Wanna see them?<eos> - Not right now, but I'll see them.<eos> - You will, you will.
- And by the way... - Yeah?<eos> - If I do this show on Broadway?<eos> - yeah.<eos> My opening night is the same night as our anniversary.<eos> Really?<eos> That would be fun.<eos> # When you got it, flaunt it # # Show your assets, let them know you're proud... #<eos> What do you think? You think you want to do the show?<eos> You know, maybe I will.<eos> Maybe I will.
Can I get a half-caff with foam, cream, and extra sugar to go?<eos> Let's get reaping.<eos> What've we got, Rube?<eos> Well, people, this is a group job.<eos> We've got one address, 13 souls.<eos> I've got three a piecefor the ladies,<eos> I've got two for Mason, two for me.<eos> I've got a pair of men's slacks in the car for you.<eos> - I don't wear slacks.<eos> - You will this morning.

Yeah, that's right.<eos> No more Ray.<eos> Morning.<eos> Why the face?<eos> Leave me alone.<eos> Her family dog died.<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry.<eos> - Thanks.<eos> Well I'd ask you how you know that but--<eos> But you won't.
- Oh, my God, everything's such a mess.<eos> Why is this happening to me?<eos> How bad do you wanna stick your tongue on that?<eos> - How's it going?<eos> - Good.<eos> I'm just getting some coffee so I'm alert for the wedding.<eos> That's what I was doing too.<eos> Well, you have fun tonight.<eos> - You too.<eos> - Oh, I will.
- Yes.<eos> That's what it's been changed to.<eos> - Again?<eos> - Yes, again.<eos> Well, all right, I'll see what I can do.<eos> It's gonna take a couple of weeks to order a new one.<eos> What am I going to do in the meantime?<eos> I suggest you black out the bits you don't want.<eos> Well, th-that...<eos> Right, I will.
- I won't sign this.<eos> You were partof a team, Jack.<eos> I'm not the only one on the hook for this.<eos> You called me off.<eos> You were the surgeon of record when she died.<eos> Look, accidents happen in surgeries all the time, Jack.<eos> That's the truth, and you know it.<eos> But if you contradict this report, if you mention alcohol, well, that's the only fact that's gonna matter.<eos> They'll strip me of my license.<eos> Yes... they will.
But you loved him.<eos> - He was sick.<eos> - Sick?<eos> It took them -- one after the other.<eos> I had no choice.<eos> They were already lost.<eos> You killed them.<eos> What would have happened if we were rescued?<eos> I couldn't let that happen.<eos> I won't!
That's nothing.<eos> Feels like nothing. But that's the vibrating palm.<eos> Two hours from now you'll go to a shop, buy a hat, it won't suit you.<eos> Ow!<eos> There's no way.<eos> Look at me.<eos> My hair's virtually a hat.<eos> - All hats suit me.<eos> - You'll see.<eos> - Yeah. I will.
Um...<eos> Keith needs some signatures from you.<eos> You know, I was thinking.<eos> My doctor's put me through some cardiovascular rehab; I thought you might like to join me.<eos> So you wanna be workout buddies?<eos> Give us a chance to spend some time together.<eos> Get to know you.<eos> You had my whole life to do that.<eos> Well life's given me a second chance.<eos> Maybe you will too.
Haley, have you seen my gray T-shirt?<eos> I want to do something, okay.<eos> Haley....<eos> No, it's okay.<eos> -I could love you forever.<eos> -So could I.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.
We go to church to learn that stuff!<eos> We go to movies to be entertained!<eos> We weren't entertained, and we want our money back!<eos> I'm now allowed to give you your money back after you sat through the whole movie!<eos> You'd have to take your complaint up with the film's producers.<eos> W-what? Mel Gibson?<eos> You're saying we have to get our money back from Mel Gibson?<eos> Yeah.<eos> I'd like to see you try.<eos> Oh, we will!
I think your coverage is a little one-sided.<eos> Come on, Sam. Colson's gonna out the whole operation.<eos> You don't think Washington can contain this? We'll see.<eos> I don't have to remind you of the nondisclosure agreement you signed?<eos> It's a reporter from the Prometheus incident.<eos> Colson doesn't seem to be worried about going to jail.<eos> - He hasn't done anything illegal yet.<eos> - We had an agreement.<eos> You said if something was gonna break, you'd call me first.<eos> I will, OK?
Mr Vice President, on his last...<eos> I am aware of the events that have, once again, compromised<eos> Colonel O'Neill's invaluable judgement.<eos> And the fact that on his last official mission, he has incurred the wrath of humanity's worst enemy on behalf of us all...<eos> Wait a minute.<eos> I thought you didn't buy into the whole invasion thing.<eos> The fact is, until we know the location of the Lost City...<eos> I know where it is.<eos> You know where it is now?<eos> I will.
It's my hand that you need to put in the code.<eos> That's how it works.<eos> And the shield of the Atlantis Stargate will be lowered?<eos> Yes, yes.<eos> What is this?<eos> Who are they?<eos> Bring him to the Gate.<eos> They are friends, Doran.<eos> Make sure he will enter the code.<eos> He will.
-lt was good.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Really good.<eos> I'm ready to go.<eos> Can one of you guys give me a ride?<eos> -Absolutely.<eos> -Sure.<eos> -Great.<eos> Who's driving?<eos> -I will.
-There's a major party contributor with a family member under consideration?<eos> -No Kaehler on the list.<eos> -The wife's son, a former marriage.<eos> His name is Morrisey.<eos> Donovan Morrisey?<eos> Estes Park.<eos> High school senior who FedEx'd LSD.<eos> -I can tell them you're tied up.<eos> -No.<eos> I will.
- Roe v. Wade affords me the right to terminate a pregnancy.<eos> And to do so free from all restraint or interference of others.<eos> - A hearing room...<eos> - I'm told I have a right to privacy.<eos> I think this would be the sort of thing it's referring to.<eos> I also bet like a drunken sailor during my bimonthly games of hearts.<eos> Do you wanna talk about that?<eos> - An abortion?<eos> - Maybe they won't find it.<eos> - They will.
People lose patience.<eos> What do we gain only covers the last part.<eos> Why not listen?<eos> They think that if one adds It's all those ignorant resolved.<eos> Do not worry, Mom. It's a young industry.<eos> These problems will be solved.<eos> We are not in a position to sell.<eos> You can not bring people in Ireland?<eos> So you can get rid of strikers.<eos> So I will.
To spend with your muse?<eos> No, I'm tired of waiting, James.<eos> I'm tired of looking like a fool.<eos> Well, I can't very well give up the play.<eos> Of course not.<eos> Just come home to me at the end of the day.<eos> Rehearse and be home for dinner.<eos> No more trips to the country, no more long afternoons in the park.<eos> If you can't give us that much of a chance, then we must end this.<eos> And I will.
I'm never gonna fit in here.<eos> Nobody even likes me.<eos> - Sure they do, honey.<eos> - Besides you, Ma.<eos> Besides me.<eos> There's...<eos> I have to find my place, but it isn't here.<eos> Yes, it is.<eos> We just haven't found it yet.<eos> - But we will.
- Go over the plan with your boyfriend.<eos> What?<eos> He's not my boyfriend!<eos> - So you'd rather go out with Gus?<eos> - I never said that.<eos> Are all boys this stupid?<eos> I don't wanna go out with either of you.<eos> If we're so stupid, then why don't you rob the bank yourself?<eos> - Fine!<eos> I will!
I don't know.<eos> I want you to wait for... just a while.<eos> Okay.<eos> Really?<eos> I'm not a concept, Joel.<eos> I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.<eos> I'm not perfect.<eos> I can't see anything that I don't like about you.<eos> Right now I can't.<eos> But you will.

What the heck do you want?<eos> Lower it. it's too loud.<eos> The other arm first. or you'll hurt me.<eos> Later will you take me home?<eos> I have lots ofthings to do.<eos> What things?<eos> I have to wash the dishes. do the shopping.<eos> sweep the floor. tidy the house.<eos> If I don't. Alberto will kick me out.<eos> No. he won't.
- Sure. - Oh my, it's all shrivelled up!<eos> - Well, it's been in there for a while.<eos> - Yeah, I can see that.<eos> - I'd like to have one myself.<eos> - Come on, push it harder.<eos> My, where is it?<eos> My, what's it doing?<eos> My, there it is!<eos> - I don't want to make it burst.<eos> - It won't.
It's no good.<eos> Pull 'em out.<eos> Tell Linda I love her that I loved her from the second I saw her.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> Yeah, I hear you.<eos> Promise to take care of my kids.<eos> Tell them that I'm always with them.<eos> You tell... You tell them that.<eos> You hear me?<eos> I will.
That's huge.<eos> I've never been "the one" before.<eos> Thought I was "the one" with Fiona, but turns out I was, what, 101?<eos> - 200.<eos> - 200!<eos> Look, you got nothing to worry about.<eos> You'll show up and sweep her off her German feet.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Yeah.<eos> I will, won't I?
She's very set on it, you know.<eos> Clarisse, my dear. Forget the wedding for a moment.<eos> In less than a month, you will no longer be queen, and I will no longer be your head of security.<eos> I think it's time we bring our friendship out of the shadows.<eos> Yes, my dear. I would kneel if it weren't for my knee replacement.<eos> Joseph, there's a wedding to be planned.<eos> Mia needs to win over the people of Genovia, all in less than 30 days.<eos> Perhaps it's time to consider the duty you have to yourself.<eos> My darling, please think about it.<eos> I will.
When I was taken, my leg was bleeding, but I didn't remember being cut, nothing.<eos> Then, under hypnosis is when I discovered that's where... they implant the tracking device.<eos> Now everything I do, they know.<eos> In fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they were... spying on us right now.<eos> When I was found that night, my nose was bleeding.<eos> The old up-the-nose trick, so the scar can't be seen.<eos> Don't forget to write.<eos> Don't you forget what I told you. Okay.<eos> You better come see me soon, asshole.<eos> I will.

But $50 is a lot of money.<eos> I know.<eos> Oh, shit!<eos> I'm sorry. Come on.<eos> I get what you're upset about.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> It might not look it, but I am good at getting things.<eos> I know what it's like when you feel your kid's being messed with.<eos> It won't happen again.<eos> It won't.
You're not in her house.<eos> You'll see her tomorrow.<eos> There are 5 houses in the park, one for each group of girls.<eos> Laura's in House number 1 and you're with us in number 3.<eos> That's Madeleine, she's here to serve us.<eos> If she disobeyed, she'd be punished.<eos> I want to go home.<eos> This is your home now.<eos> Someone will fetch me.<eos> No, they won't.
Does not the Earl provide?<eos> The Earl is not one of life's providers.<eos> But the King is.<eos> If you want the best, you may receive it from me.<eos> I shall be everything you wish me to be.<eos> I wish you to be my eyes and ears on his earlship.<eos> I am his lover.<eos> But I am your true subject.<eos> Then you'll serve me in this matter?<eos> Yes, I will.
Wake up.<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Wake up!<eos> Jesus, Mary and Joseph, Ralph!<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I thought the music might wake her up.<eos> - Well, it won't.
Now, I'll call you in a few weeks, and if you want to, we'll talk.<eos> There's a great article in there comparing today's quarterbacks with Johnny Unitas.<eos> Unitas would kick their butts.<eos> So, this is your sales pitch?<eos> I've been with the magazine for 20 years. I believe in it.<eos> Well, good for you.<eos> So, are you worried about all these rumors that your parent company is about to be sold?<eos> No, not really.<eos> I don't see how it would affect us.<eos> Well, hopefully it won't.
An officer will look after Kimie.<eos> It won't be long.<eos> OK. Give me five minutes.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I'll be back before you know it.<eos> - I love you.<eos> - I love you too.<eos> Bye, mom.<eos> - OK. Fill me in.<eos> - I will in the truck.
I don't know, really.<eos> It's the wrong moment for me to leave.<eos> Vera's nervous, the baby is too. I see!<eos> - Can't I leave in 2 days?<eos> Come on.<eos> No!<eos> I can't leave today. I'm not going.<eos> I'm sick of you.<eos> No one'll look for you?<eos> The general will.
- You sure did.<eos> I'll pay.<eos> - I have to leave now.<eos> - Doucouré.<eos> - Greetings to your parents.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> - Traoré.<eos> - So long.<eos> - Ibrahima, do not forget to see Mercenaire.<eos> - No, I won't.
He won't keep a girl with a bastard.<eos> Why didn't I leave?<eos> Where? Penniless?<eos> What for?<eos> Who'd have given me a job?<eos> How to feed the baby?<eos> Where could I have lived?<eos> For my finger and the f'n car.<eos> - we'll do it.<eos> - We f'n will!
Steamed chicken? All right.<eos> This chicken's gonna be good.<eos> Take it easy.<eos> Let me check if the water's boiling.<eos> Oh, Dad!<eos> What happened, doctor!<eos> It's miracle he's alive.<eos> He got struck by lightening twice!<eos> But he doesn't even recognize me!<eos> He will, some day.
If you can balance it on your mustache, I'll give you a bottle of whiskey!<eos> Marwan, what do you do abroad?<eos> Business.<eos> Yes, but what kind of business?<eos> What do you sell?<eos> Whatever comes to your mind.<eos> Games for kids, games for adults.<eos> Watches... Marwan, when is your turn going to come? We want to see your children before we die.<eos> That we see your children, or that we die?<eos> When God wills what?
Now say, "I love you" and, "Will you marry me?" I love you and will you marry me?<eos> Not to me.<eos> To her.<eos> I love you.<eos> Will you mar... Marry me?<eos> What?<eos> I love you.<eos> Will you marry me?<eos> You know what, Dr Macartney?<eos> I bloody will.
I've never talked to anyone about this.<eos> Koby, Koby.<eos> Haven't spoken to him in 10 years.<eos> Get your arm up.<eos> Go get Mordechay.<eos> We're going off to the city of Dervichen<eos> To buy a turkey.<eos> Carful coachman, the basket torn, the turkey will fly away.<eos> Hey, Menny, you'll come to my exhibition, won't you?<eos> Of course I will.
Look what you did ... broke the plate and everything.<eos> Any more of this and I'll hold back your allowance.<eos> That reminds me ...<eos> My allowance ... I didn't get it last week either.<eos> I'll get double today. Double?<eos> Where's my handbag?<eos> You little extortionist.<eos> Here you are. 200.<eos> And I'll get 100 back.<eos> - No, you won't.
We don't know what she wanted. Father, don't think about that now.<eos> Did you put the potatoes on?<eos> -What did she throw a party for?<eos> -Father... The doctor said it had nothing to do with that.<eos> GuniIIa, get out the sausage. We have to fry it. And beetroots?<eos> Where are the beetroots? We need those.<eos> Take it easy, mother. I'II get them out.<eos> They have to have food.<eos> GuniIIa, you have to help Tommy with cleaning.<eos> Yes, of course I will.
Hurry up and run away!<eos> We'll be in be in trouble if we get caught!<eos> Sandayuu-san?<eos> Where are you planning to go?<eos> T-Train...!<eos> Train?<eos> What's a train?<eos> That thing?<eos> We'll be run over!<eos> We will not!
I've never flown before.<eos> I've been in a helicopter.<eos> They don't... go this high.<eos> Back to the mother country.<eos> Hey, after we save Fred, we should hit the West End.<eos> Take in a show.<eos> - I've never seen Les Mis.<eos> - Trust me. Halfway through the first act, you'll be drinking humans again.<eos> Can't lose her, Spike.<eos> You won't.
- I don't believe that.<eos> - No!<eos> I'm with him!<eos> You won't leave me now?<eos> - We're so close.<eos> - I will never leave you.<eos> That was bad.<eos> But it's better now.<eos> You won't leave me?<eos> I won't.
Good.<eos> - So, where is he?<eos> - Right through there.<eos> Okay.<eos> - See you later.<eos> - Wait.<eos> Listen.<eos> He's gonna talk to you.<eos> - Don't let him distract you.<eos> - I won't.
Maybe if I'd stopped her back in Gunn's office...<eos> - Did she toss you out a window?<eos> - No.<eos> Then you're one up on me.<eos> What have you got?<eos> - Smoke and mirrors.<eos> - No trace of them.<eos> GUNN: Put Tactical on code black.<eos> If Illyria shows...<eos> She won't.
Look, I can't.<eos> Forget it, then.<eos> Paula, please.<eos> If you don't talk to the police, they'll come after you, Dean.<eos> You know something, don't you?<eos> That murder.<eos> I've done nothing wrong, Paula.<eos> You've got to believe me.<eos> Why should I?<eos> And they won't, will they?
There's a ship waiting in the harbor.<eos> A crew of my most trusted officers will take you far from Syracuse.<eos> But the ambassadors' guards?<eos> Are asleep or well-bribed.<eos> But we must go now.<eos> Go where?<eos> To live the rest of my life in exile?<eos> To live, son.<eos> I won't let them execute you for Sinbad's crime.<eos> Neither will Sinbad.
Help must come to us.<eos> It must be getting near teatime.<eos> Leastways, it would be in decent places where there is still teatime.<eos> We're not in decent places.<eos> Mr. Frodo?<eos> What is it?<eos> It's just a feeling.<eos> I don't think I'll be coming back.<eos> Yes, you will.<eos> Of course you will.
Maybe.<eos> But it's too late now.<eos> I made a promise, and some promises can't be unmade.<eos> - It's not fair.<eos> - Nobody said it was gonna be.<eos> You think Cas thinks it's fair that I'm here and Dozer's not?<eos> I lost two brothers to that ship, Link.<eos> I'm afraid of it.<eos> I'm afraid it's gonna take you too.<eos> It won't.
My papa says you're not supposed to be here. He says you must be lost.<eos> Are you lost, Neo?<eos> - Where am I?<eos> - This is the train station.<eos> - This isn't the Matrix?<eos> - That's where the train goes.<eos> That's where we're going, but you cannot go with us.<eos> - Why not?<eos> - He won't let you.<eos> - Who won't?
Right?<eos> Go on, Sal, I'm here if you need me.<eos> The salient point is I must continue to live with my lovely wife and tears on her pillow are a plethora to me.<eos> Anathema to me!<eos> You see what they got me doing?<eos> - I can't even talk straight!<eos> - Take it easy.<eos> So I'm giving you both another chance to redeem yourselves.<eos> - Thank you, we won't disappoint you.<eos> - No, we won't.
My savior!<eos> Can you drop me off?<eos> - I'll give you a ride. - Am I glad to see you!<eos> 'Scuse me...<eos> - Can I go?<eos> - I suppose so. Can you keep an eye on the space?<eos> I'll be back.<eos> - Easy, I'm not late.<eos> - Yes, boss. - You'll never guess.<eos> - Neither will you.
-What?<eos> I can say that, can't I? To Tommy and Joan?<eos> Well, it is.<eos> So maybe a family isn't far behind.<eos> Let's take our coffee in the sitting room, shall we?<eos> I'll help.<eos> -Keep them closed.<eos> -All right.<eos> You've got everything you've ever dreamed of.<eos> You will too.
- They hang women.<eos> Shut up and move!<eos> Free me and I'll tell you the Aquitaine password.<eos> I know it God help us.<eos> - Picardy?<eos> - God be with us.<eos> - Burgundy?<eos> - Glory to God. I know them all.<eos> Franche-Comté God bless.<eos> Champagne God wills it, etc.
DJ, spin that shit.<eos> My bad.<eos> - Motha...<eos> Brenda, is something wrong?<eos> I don't know.<eos> All that stuff you was saying on TV.<eos> I just got a weird feeling somethin' bad is headed my way. Like when you see a Asian person behind the wheel of a car.<eos> Cindy, after the show you think maybe you could... come back to my crib and hang out with me?<eos> - I don't wanna be alone.<eos> - Oh, of course I will, Brenda.
My six-year-old nephew could con anything out of that dude.<eos> Why? Look, if we knew Dolby was connected to you, we'd never have gone near him, so I apologize for any inconvenience.<eos> Honest mistake, all right?<eos> It's just something between two guys that don't know each other yet.<eos> So we're gonna make an exchange of the money and all will be forgiven.<eos> Isn't that right?<eos> - No.<eos> That I won't do.<eos> - Won't? You won't.<eos> You won't.
People could get killed.<eos> - I'm inside. You're on the street.<eos> - We're in this together.<eos> It's ourjob to protect them.<eos> There's only so much that I can do, okay?<eos> And it's not just them that I worry about.<eos> I can't protect you.<eos> - Where are we with Rohr?<eos> - He hasn't stepped up yet.<eos> He will.
It's your sister on line four.<eos> All right.<eos> Er, yes, I'm very busy and important, how can I help you?<eos> have you gone completely insane?<eos> - You can't always be sensible.<eos> - 'You can if you're Prime Minister.'<eos> - It's the Chancellor on the other line.<eos> - It isn't!<eos> - 'I'll call you back.'<eos> - No, you won't!
I used to like to hear the music from the house as I was walking down the street.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> It was?<eos> It was always the same record.<eos> It was the Mule Serenade.<eos> It was really pretty.<eos> Take care of yourself, Dad, okay?<eos> Yeah, you too.<eos> And remember to send me the girls' shoe sizes, okay?<eos> Yeah, I will.
I hope you're as entrepreneurial with the orb.<eos> You lost men, I lost men.<eos> I see no reason we should both lose again.<eos> If I want double what Reiss offered me?<eos> is it here?<eos> It's worth a lot.<eos> Well, then, if you know that, you know Reiss will also kill you the moment you give it to him.<eos> And your government will guarantee my safety?<eos> No.<eos> But I will.
- A coffee.<eos> - No.<eos> One glass of water.<eos> In a brightly-lit public place. No.<eos> Okay, we don't even have to talk to each other.<eos> - We don't even have to sit together. - No.<eos> You sit on one side of the room and I sit on the other. - And if everything goes really well... we'll just wave to each other once in a while.<eos> Why are you filming this?<eos> - Just in case I never see you again.<eos> - Which you won't.
Thank God I don't have that problem.<eos> All right, holler at your people, now.<eos> -l'm not touching that. -l don't want to.<eos> I don't want to.<eos> Yvonne's right. Act like he called with a good explanation.<eos> He better call, and he better have a good explanation.<eos> Look at me.<eos> Look at them. Not a care in the world.<eos> If they catch you staring, they'll send the jocks to kick our asses.<eos> No, they won't.
-Who's that?<eos> -My mentor.<eos> Franco Basaglia.<eos> -The one who would free the mad.<eos> -He has this crazy idea that they're not actually inmates, but people. And that mental illness isn't a sin to be expunged.<eos> How about that!<eos> How is Dad?<eos> He's...<eos> -You should go see him.<eos> -I will!
Sell your music and get warm clothes.<eos> I listen to this music either to force you out or myself.<eos> What life is this, listening to music all day?<eos> I am alive with this music and won't leave unless I make you go.<eos> You can't make me go!<eos> This music will!<eos> If I raise it a little you'll get lost.<eos> I turned to the devil.<eos> You'll surely get expelled too!<eos> I won't!
Julien Antoine Janvier to love and to cherish, till death you do part?<eos> I will<eos> Yes, I will<eos> And you<eos> My son<eos> Julien Antoine Janvier, will you take as wife<eos> Christelle Louise Bouchard to love and to cherish, till death you do part?<eos> Julien!<eos> Wake up, my boy, your fiancee is waiting.<eos> Will you..
- Can I kiss you?<eos> - You are such a little brat.<eos> I'm just kidding.<eos> I love you and Johnny.<eos> Okay, okay.<eos> Johnny's gonna be here any minute.<eos> - You can wait if you want.<eos> - Mm, I gotta go.<eos> - You'll tell him I stopped by.<eos> - Of course I will.
This is the countryside!<eos> If you don't give a shit about our relationship, just fuck off!<eos> The stupid cow keeps an eye on the whole neighbourhood.<eos> You wanted to get rid of Moritz.<eos> I said from the beginning that I didn't want it.<eos> What are you complaining about?<eos> I'm the one putting in all the work.<eos> How much longer?<eos> What if his mum won't come home?<eos> She will!
L"II jump!<eos> Ivan, don"t do anything.<eos> Wait for me.<eos> You understand?<eos> L"II jump!<eos> I will, you scum...<eos> You hear me?<eos> L"II jump! I will!<eos> You hear me, you scum?<eos> I will!
Stop it, Mom.<eos> He nearly chopped off my finger, how can I go to work with a chopped-off finger?<eos> This is my door, you hear?<eos> Don't be angry, he had a rough day.<eos> I don't exactly piss around all day.<eos> Did you have the geography test today? -Math.<eos> Did you do good?<eos> No.<eos> Never mind. -They'll end up kicking me out.<eos> Oh no they won't.
- The Prince is vindictive.<eos> - Might ask for your head.<eos> - Let him!<eos> No felon will rule over us.<eos> - You want to elect a new Prince? - A Prince?<eos> Whatever for?<eos> The tribes will rule as in the past.<eos> The neighbors will invade you.<eos> They'll grind you to dust.<eos> They won't.
You're a novice I'm God of this game<eos> - Should I help you?<eos> - Can you?<eos> My ID is 'Cicinnurus Regius' When I see you on line<eos> I'll make you invincible<eos> Cicinnurus Regius?<eos> Yeah Yours?<eos> 'Wandering Monk'?<eos> - Don't forget my ID<eos> - I won't
He stopped playing. Now he just stands there like that.<eos> He knocks, I let him in, he stands there, silent.<eos> What's that supposed to prove?<eos> - That he's depressed. Introverted. With you, it's all outwards, it's collective, it's bovine, it's whining, it's got nothing to do with depression!<eos> Did he try to kill himself?<eos> - Never asked him.<eos> - I did.<eos> That's what you keep saying, but someone your age should be able to pull it off<eos> If I jump off your roof now, would that prove it?<eos> You won't.
A means to an end.<eos> Well, people get born for all sorts of reasons.<eos> - He will never love you.<eos> - Doesn't matter.<eos> Foolish dead thing!<eos> Oh. Well, that'll work.<eos> FRED: I mean, starting not to look so good for us.<eos> Not that I'm giving up or anything.<eos> LORNE: Hey, you can stop that any time now.<eos> I will.
- For a human.<eos> God, I can't believe Angelus killed the Beast.<eos> He fought dirty.<eos> Maybe this means we did the right thing, bringing Angelus back.<eos> Right.<eos> He's a real hero.<eos> Connor Angelus cannot fight his true nature.<eos> But by killing the Beast, he's made the world a little safer for our family.<eos> You didn't have that the first time around.<eos> - But now you will.
ANGELUS: Darla felt the same way.<eos> It made her sick, you squirming inside her.<eos> So she jammed a stake in her own heart so she wouldn't have to hear your first whiny breath.<eos> - You don't know anything.<eos> - Then there was Holtz.<eos> You disappointed him so much that he stabbed himself in the neck.<eos> My fa...<eos> Holtz was a good man.<eos> All he ever wanted was for you to get the punishment you deserve.<eos> And you will.
Excuse me. You're too young to be holding that ticket.<eos> - Let's go.<eos> - I can't go to jail.<eos> - Let's just watch cartoons.<eos> - Sir, we will not be starting with Les Cousins...<eos> - until you leave.<eos> - Excuse me, but I thought my A.A.R.P. card...<eos> - was good for one and a guest. - You know what?<eos> I knew society would never accept this.<eos> And they never will.
That is the code.<eos> What do you call what you did with that Lobster Gal?<eos> He got you there, Phin.<eos> If he wasn't one of yours, I would've clobbered him.<eos> - See you later, Samson. - See you.<eos> - And you're $10 short.<eos> - I had to fill up.<eos> That's three.<eos> I'll make it good.<eos> - Yeah, you will. - OK, then.
- Just do what you want to do!<eos> Let's go.<eos> - Yeah, we'll go.<eos> It's OK.<eos> It's OK, it's OK.<eos> Do you think we should stop?<eos> Why?<eos> Well, because it's rude not to.<eos> He might see us.<eos> No, he won't.
Well, because it's rude not to.<eos> He might see us.<eos> No, he won't.<eos> Then again.<eos> Hello again.<eos> Hi.<eos> Do you want a lift somewhere?<eos> That's OK.<eos> I'll pick up a cab.<eos> Not round here you won't.
Sorry.<eos> Flirting's always been a weakness.<eos> Then you and Adam have got a lot more in common than he'd like to admit.<eos> Still leaving me, then?<eos> You can always come with me.<eos> - A sales rep hotel in Birmingham?<eos> I think I'll pass.<eos> I'll miss you.<eos> I doubt it.<eos> - I will.
I'm really sorry, because this band is one of the few things that I care about in the whole stupid world.<eos> Okay, and you have got to admit that I may be part of the reason why you guys got that gig.<eos> And you know that none of those girls out there are gonna be half as good as me when I'm good.<eos> I promise you, if you give me another chance I will be better than good.<eos> I will be the best.<eos> Please.<eos> You guys, just give me-- Just give me another chance, please?<eos> Okay.<eos> But if you make me regret this, I will kill you.<eos> No, I won't, I won't.
Look.<eos> I need you.<eos> Dawson needs you.<eos> Okay.<eos> Here's the most crucial thing you need to get through that head of yours.<eos> Things will never be the same between Dawson and me.<eos> Or any of us, for that matter.<eos> You're gonna have to accept that.<eos> I don't.<eos> And I never will.
-l was--?<eos> Oh, no, you're leaving?<eos> -l'm sorry.<eos> I have to go.<eos> I should've left ages ago, but....<eos> -You can call me.<eos> -Really?<eos> You should call me.<eos> Here.<eos> I will, I absolutely will.
Wait, C.J. Wait.<eos> Let me explain.<eos> -Will you please let me explain?<eos> -l think I've heard all I need to hear.<eos> Look, I need to talk to you.<eos> I need your help.<eos> Oh, you need my help?<eos> Well, you said it earlier.<eos> -Why don't you call the help line.<eos> -Okay, I will.
You might wanna focus more on getting better, less on getting laid.<eos> I don't see why a girl can't do both.<eos> I mean, what if Ben Affleck is there?<eos> He is the sexiest man alive, you know.<eos> Did you pack my Jane magazines?<eos> I missed five issues while I was wasted.<eos> They're in here, with a stack of InStyle and a tape full of Trading Spaces that I made you.<eos> Joey Potter, you are a dream.<eos> -Don't you forget it.<eos> -l won't.
Can people ever change?<eos> Depends on the person.<eos> I'm guessing the pain of this fades away, you'll just go back to being what you are.<eos> What is that?<eos> A brilliant beautiful evil double-crossing snake.<eos> Cheer up, weepy.<eos> You made yourself a boatload of hard cash today.<eos> You can question the meaning of life on a floating island of your own for a while.<eos> You won't tell anyone about me breaking down?<eos> I won't.
It's because it reminds her of her Uncle Joey.<eos> - It does?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> And she's comforted by him because she loves her Uncle Joey so much.<eos> - Really?<eos> She loves me?<eos> - Oh, yeah.<eos> But you know what? If you need Huggsy, don't worry.<eos> Emma will totally understand.<eos> I won't, but whatever.
Hey, Joey said no autographs.<eos> But if she's getting one, I want one too!<eos> "To Monica. " And none of this "best wishes" crap.<eos> I want "love. "<eos> Okay, actually, Mon, Matthew was giving me his phone number.<eos> Oh, man! Ifl had known I was coming to this party I never would've gotten married!<eos> - It was nice to meet you.<eos> - Nice to meet you.<eos> - Call me.<eos> - We will!
Now the info-Sphere will open its protective crust... So as to scan itself, completing its thousand-Year task.<eos> This is your one chance to enter the sphere.<eos> Scoot.<eos> Scoot now!<eos> I'm at the input console.<eos> I'm nervous, and I've got brain in my butt crack.<eos> Roger.<eos> Once you press the detonator, you will have 60 seconds for an exciting escape.<eos> Hey, wait. This Brain knows about everything, right?<eos> It will soon.
I'm gonna get trapped in the info-Sphere again.<eos> Just remember that Scooty-Puff Junior sucks!<eos> In 1,000 years, I'll get right on it.<eos> And so 1,000 years later, Fry once again... Infiltrated the info-Sphere and set off his amazing bomb.<eos> Only this time....<eos> Thank you for saving the universe, Fry.<eos> Here.<eos> Oh, thanks.<eos> If you ever need a savior again, just ask.<eos> Oh, we will.

- I am sure she is.<eos> - Thank you both.<eos> Jason, how's your time?<eos> Would you like to join us for dinner?<eos> Oh, I'd love to, Emily, but I should get these papers up to my lawyer's office.<eos> - Next week?<eos> - Consider it an open invitation.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Richard, I'll see you tomorrow morning.<eos> Yes, you will.
Are you sure you don't want me to turn it off?<eos> Try this one.<eos> Sookie, I love you, I love your cooking, but I swear if you make me eat one more bite of broccoli tart, I will beat you to death with it.<eos> Your mother is the pickiest woman I have ever catered for.<eos> She has impeccable taste, the highest standards, and she can smell an inferior tart a mile away.<eos> Depending on how long it's been left out, we all can.<eos> - You know, she still hasn't called yet.<eos> - She will.<eos> But she was supposed to call about the details a couple of days ago.<eos> She will, Sookie.
But then I realized that it was one of the original stroke ladies' husband's calling to inform me of her stroke, which we already knew about, so here we are.<eos> Thank God.<eos> So, Rory has been telling me about the Chilton Bicentennial and her speech.<eos> Well, it's not my speech yet.<eos> I have to qualify for it.<eos> Oh, you'll get it.<eos> She'll be on C-SPAN if she does.<eos> Very good.<eos> It's not like anyone would watch it.<eos> Yes, they will.
I didn't see anything.<eos> Then maybe I'll just have to make magic happen again, won't I?<eos> Hey.<eos> How you been?<eos> I haven't seen you in a while.<eos> Yeah, well, the last time I saw you, you kind of had your hands full.<eos> Coop!<eos> Come on.<eos> - Well, don't let me keep you.<eos> - I won't.
All that, really.<eos> Thank you.<eos> (TIM) Yeah, I'm looking forward to seeing her again.<eos> She's my friend and she's a good friend.<eos> I don't know exactly how I'll feel.<eos> I'll feel like a friend feels, whatever that is.<eos> But, as I said, I'm not gonna ask her again.<eos> Come on!<eos> I might ask her again.<eos> No, I won't.
I just... feel like I should be here.<eos> Good enough.<eos> Besides, who will I tell?<eos> I don't remember anybody, right?<eos> - Good one.<eos> - Thanks, Jim.<eos> Oh, so, there are extensive writings, all in the oldest known Ancient dialects, all yet to be translated.<eos> But so far we haven't found any signs of any advanced weapons or power sources.<eos> The original name of the city, Vis Uban, does translate as "place of great power", but it doesn't mean we'll find a way to defeat Anubis there.<eos> You won't.
But on the life of my family, I knew nothing about that.<eos> Get me the memo.<eos> L guarantee your e-mail won't be needed.<eos> But if I were you, I'd talk to the police before they talk to you.<eos> - L-l'll drop you somewhere safe.<eos> - L'm safe.<eos> How much did you get?<eos> Nearly all of it.<eos> If you're going to change your mind, do it before the affidavit's handed over.<eos> L won't.
And we are Centauri police.<eos> The Tamaranean girl is a liar and a thief.<eos> She's committed high crimes throughout the entire Centauri system.<eos> I have never even been to the Centauri moons!<eos> But I know someone who has.<eos> You've been chasing the wrong girl.<eos> Where's Blackfire?<eos> Don't worry, Star.<eos> She won't get away with this.<eos> No, she will not!
What's that, panties?<eos> [Chuckling] Oh, no! I can't tell Hyde that one!<eos> Naughty panties!<eos> What's that, fist?<eos> It would be my pleasure.<eos> Here you go.<eos> One general-issue military cot... slightly used from my days in the National Guard.<eos> Well, it's good to know that the National Guard was gettin' a good night's sleep... while I was in the South Pacific dodging' bullets and using coral as toilet paper!<eos> So- [Sighs] I don't think there's gonna be room for everything.<eos> Oh, Donna, sure there will.
- A deal.<eos> Three days.<eos> - In exchange for an exclusive on five Bahji sleepers the FBI just outed to every news outlet in the known universe.<eos> Is there a connection between the assassination and the kidnapping?<eos> - It's only been a few hours.<eos> - Is there a connection between the assassination of Shareef and the kidnapping of Zoey Bartlet?<eos> Damn it, Danny, I have no idea! What do you want from me?<eos> - I'm filing the story today.<eos> - It'll get buried.<eos> No, it won't.
Come on.<eos> As agreed, the price of cooperation is an agreement by the state parole officials... to move Mr. Barksdale's first parole hearing forward by 12 months... and to credit him in the file with cooperation in this matter.<eos> You can't make a case on just some con's say so.<eos> We need the dope on the table.<eos> Of course you do.<eos> If, before the end of business today, you effect a search... of Correctional Officer Tilghman's vehicle, locker, and person... we are confident sufficient evidence will be recovered.<eos> "We are confident"?<eos> As far as D.O.C. is concerned, this is a fair deal... if it takes the overdoses off our plate.<eos> But if we come up empty on this...<eos> You won't.
I'm asking why you would choose me after what happened last go around.<eos> Yeah, I thought about that, too.<eos> Looking at the list of names on the southeastern roster... I'm saying to myself:<eos> "Why take a man who already burned you once...<eos> "who already proved himself disloyal?"<eos> Now, why would I do that?<eos> I have no fucking clue, Lieutenant.<eos> Because if I caught him once... he might be the last son of a bitch to try it twice.<eos> I'm guessing you got enough shame from the last time... so that it won't happen again.<eos> No, sir, it won't.
Good.<eos> Look, Rosie... I'm gonna be seeing a chap called Steve Norish, and for reasons I don't really want to go into it's possible that my wife may turn up and want to see him while I'm seeing him.<eos> - Do not let her in!<eos> Okay? - Fair enough.<eos> He has real pain in his marriage.<eos> - How'd you work that out?<eos> - He's strained and tight! I know the signs.<eos> See, I'm sexually very giving.<eos> Locked in a marriage and I realised that's loveless in spite of Gordon and all he's done.<eos> Bit like a carpet and a hairbrush, if you will.
It's the last thing he'll expect.<eos> That doesn't make sense to me.<eos> But then you are very small.<eos> Perhaps you're right.<eos> South it is, then.<eos> Hold on, little Shirelings.<eos> I always like going south.<eos> Somehow it feels like going downhill.<eos> Are you mad? We'll be caught.<eos> No, we won't.
- I met him yesterday.<eos> - Let him look around.<eos> Answer his questions, but watch him.<eos> If there's any problem, make sure we know about it.<eos> When the Pre-Cogs declare a killer, their name is embedded in the wood.<eos> Since the shape and grain of each piece is unique, they're impossible to forge.<eos> You understand the legalistic drawback to Precrime methodology.<eos> - Here we go again.<eos> - I'm not with the ACLU on this but we arrest individuals who've broken no law.<eos> - They will.
-Who the fuck is this?<eos> -Don't think about leaving that phone.<eos> -Wrong number, pal.<eos> -It was a perfectly delicious pizza.<eos> You're certainly going to wish you had accepted it.<eos> Naturally, this is part of the gag.<eos> The pizza bit. That was funny shit.<eos> Well, its purpose was to keep your strength up for what's coming next.<eos> -What's coming next is I'm hanging up.<eos> -Oh, no, you won't.
Take a look at your chest.<eos> You saw how accurate I can be, how lethal.<eos> STU: Kill me now, and you give yourself away.<eos> Not with a silencer.<eos> It would take these guys the rest of the day to figure out it wasn't one of their own men that did it.<eos> You can be shot 41 times for pulling out your wallet.<eos> JONAH: Throw down your weapon and come out with your hands raised.<eos> -lgnore him.<eos> -Yeah, what if they open fire?<eos> They won't.
Yeah.<eos> That's nice.<eos> You have anyone like that?<eos> Yeah, I've got a kid.<eos> She's staying with my grandma while I get another job.<eos> Well, look for another job.<eos> So where does Quincy fit in?<eos> I had a few medical bills.<eos> You'll have more unless you get rid of him.<eos> Yeah, well, I will.

My heart is beat-beat-beating<eos> It's Ethan again.<eos> Oh, Angela<eos> Oh, how I need you so<eos> 'Cause your eyes are like two shining blue<eos> Rockets in the night come to take me away<eos> Come and fuck me, baby<eos> He is so--<eos> And don't let me hurt you just by accident<eos> - I probably won't, but
So does my dad.<eos> It was a smooth operation...<eos> Holy smokes.<eos> until Rosengarden got sloppy.<eos> Yes, well, the reason I'm calling, Mr. Davis... is because your son gave my son a dirty movie.<eos> And it was perhaps the weirdest dirty movie... that I've ever seen.<eos> I want to know how Handsome got his hands... on something this... super dirty.<eos> Perhaps you should talk to him.<eos> Oh, don't worry. I will.<eos> I most certainly will.
If the jury finds you guilty, which they will... you're gonna be expelled.<eos> Stark won't even let you walk at graduation.<eos> My parents are gonna kill me.<eos> There is another way.<eos> I have the authority to offer you a deal.<eos> You know, he's never seen karate...<eos> like my karate.<eos> There's not gonna be any karate.<eos> You get an "F" in the class... but the "F" won't go on your final transcript.<eos> It won't?
-Scooby, what are you doing, man?<eos> -Mary Jane is a man in a mask.<eos> -Mary Jane is a man in a mask?<eos> -Scooby.<eos> What are you doing, man?<eos> Step off, Scoob.<eos> Shaggy, you're whipped.<eos> I'm whipped? Yeah?<eos> Why don't you say that to my face?<eos> Okay, I will.
- Is that for me?<eos> - Yep.<eos> I can't shoot nobody if my gun ain't loaded.<eos> Exactly.<eos> I ain't going in without no bullets in my gun.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> - Yeah, you are.<eos> Good God!<eos> If I give you a loaded pistol, somehow you'd get one of them bullets into me.<eos> I will not.
- I'm clean for now?<eos> - Yes, everything is fine.<eos> - I'm sorry I sound panicked.<eos> - That's okay--<eos> - What's your name?<eos> - Jeanette.<eos> Nice to meet you.<eos> - Okay, so I'll cut it up. - That's fine.<eos> I'll cut up my card, then get a new one going, right?<eos> - Yes, you will.
The accounts I have received of Australia... and the next world are not particularly... encouraging, Cousin Cecily.<eos> This world is good enough for me.<eos> Yes, but are you good enough for it?<eos> No, I'm afraid not.<eos> That is why I want you to reform me.<eos> You might make that your mission... if you don't mind, Cousin Cecily.<eos> I'm afraid I've no time this afternoon.<eos> Well, would you mind me... reforming myself this afternoon?<eos> It is rather quixotic of you, but I think you should try.<eos> I will.
Hello? Can't sleep, Will?<eos> Me neither.<eos> Who's this?<eos> I got a nap this afternoon but I guess you had to work.<eos> - Who am I speaking to?<eos> - Get rid of your clock yet?<eos> Won't help.<eos> I once went five nights. Can you believe that?<eos> This crazy light. - A name or I'll hang up.<eos> - No you won't.
- You never heard that before?<eos> - No.<eos> - Means you're a spoiled, little rich girl.<eos> - Oh, really?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> Granted, I might appreciate the finer things in life.<eos> But spoiled?<eos> I think not.<eos> - Take it back!<eos> - I won't.
- Yeah.<eos> Granted, I might appreciate the finer things in life.<eos> But spoiled?<eos> I think not.<eos> - Take it back!<eos> - I won't.<eos> - Take it back right now.<eos> - You are a cake eater.<eos> - Take it back.<eos> - I won't.
I haven't even gotten around to taking my GED yet.<eos> -So take it.<eos> -I gotta go to Hackensack.<eos> So go!<eos> Stop procrastinating.<eos> It's almost Christmas.<eos> Not going to New Jersey isn't procrastinating.<eos> It's common sense.<eos> -Do you want me to go with you?<eos> -No. I will.
The man from Staines - He say yeah!<eos> Ice, please.<eos> Ali, this is a great jacuzzi!<eos> -That ain't the jacuzzi.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Bring her in.<eos> Dance for me, bitch!<eos> My Julie, me got something to ask you...<eos> Will you make me the happiest man in the world?<eos> Yeah, I will!
Do me first.<eos> No, Mitch.<eos> Mitch, just use the gat.<eos> - So you're gonna stick me?<eos> - Shoot 'em!<eos> - Why?<eos> - Because it's fucking quicker!<eos> Is that how you'd let your sergeant go out, Jones?<eos> - I'll shoot them!<eos> - No, you won't.
She's also gone now.<eos> That's my father.<eos> Over there by the furnace is where he would work.<eos> When I was a child, I used to think, "My father is special" because he went right into hell every day and came out alive.<eos> But what is he today without his hell?<eos> A poor man.<eos> Good evening.<eos> Come on, Gigi!<eos> You'll never make it.<eos> Yes, I will.
Now, let's go over our schedule once again, shall we?<eos> Petunia, when the Masons arrive, you will be...?<eos> In the lounge, waiting to welcome them graciously to our home.<eos> - Good.<eos> And, Dudley, you will be...?<eos> - I'll be waiting to open the door.<eos> Excellent.<eos> And you?<eos> I'll be in my bedroom, making no noise and pretending that I don't exist.<eos> Too right, you will.
- l certainly don't.<eos> Shwama, then?<eos> - Shawarma, you mean.<eos> Beat it!<eos> Go away!<eos> Stay away!<eos> Or else ...<eos> Stupid git!<eos> Stupid git ... I'll write some words.<eos> - No, I will.
Hey, Lily.<eos> Hey, baby.<eos> What are you still doing up?<eos> You woke me up.<eos> Yeah, I'm sorry, baby.<eos> What'd I do?<eos> Go back to bed.<eos> Will you sing to me?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Of course I will.
That's right. Take a seat.<eos> - You know, you're a remarkable man.<eos> - Huh? Your wife two-times you.<eos> Plugs the guy and tries to pin it on you.<eos> Most men would let a dame like that swing, but no, you're sticking by her.<eos> Makes you a hero in my eyes.<eos> That's right. I'm a hero.<eos> Did you bring the money?<eos> I didn't do as well as I hoped. But,<eos> I will, Mr. Flynn. I will.
I told you to get dressed.<eos> - I'm not going.<eos> This is my flat!<eos> - You must obey me.<eos> Let's go.<eos> Here it is.<eos> The old man that lived here died a few weeks ago. These are his things.<eos> - Are you crazy?<eos> I'm gonna live here?<eos> - Yes, you will.
I'm sorry!<eos> Come on.<eos> That's enough. Stop.<eos> Oh, fuck.<eos> Oh, my god.<eos> Monty! Oh, my god!<eos> It's all right.<eos> It's all right. Just get me inside.<eos> Get me inside.<eos> Of course I will. Oh.
I chatted with a guy later... He told me it happens sometimes<eos> The FSB swap a gangster, then get the credit<eos> It was announced then: a special force carried out a successful hostage-rescue-operation The usual nonsense, you know<eos> I din't fucking care about their "rescue" anyway<eos> Could I have some more water?<eos> What?<eos> They should've let her go first, for free<eos> Yes, they should have<eos> Maybe he will now, maybe he will let her go?<eos> No, he won't
I thought he was great till yesterday, but what do we know?<eos> The only time he invites us here is when I get a part in his play.<eos> That looks like script pages.<eos> Get this bagged up, yeah?<eos> Is everything all right? Huh?<eos> Oh, just routine stuff, that's all.<eos> That fight with Joy - it can't look good.<eos> Now, don't you worry about me, just concentrate on yourself.<eos> I just don't want to let you down.<eos> You won't.
Couldn't it be useful in the future to have a saint for grandmother?<eos> Take off your rucksack.<eos> - Coming to lunch?<eos> - I'm going to my studio.<eos> Aunt Maria wants to see you.<eos> It's urgent.<eos> - Will you be at the fencing class?<eos> - And aunt Maria?<eos> - Don't forget dinner tonight.<eos> - I won't.
Talk to her.<eos> - I'll do that.<eos> - Good.<eos> It'll reassure you.<eos> I'm going to talk to her. Two more drinks.<eos> Listen Jose, to talk, you have to go home.<eos> - Not order another drink.<eos> - Yeah, right, but I have to think about what I'm going to say.<eos> - What if she leaves me?<eos> - She won't.
Will you help me?<eos> Will you?<eos> You know what's important.<eos> - What?<eos> - Knowing how long it takes to unchain yourself.<eos> When you know so, you'll know how much oxygen you need.<eos> Because oxygen needs space.<eos> If you don't give it space, you'll suffocate.<eos> So this way they'll survive?<eos> Some will.
God had given me some obstacles--- so that I would grow up to be an extraordinary person<eos> Now I understand what it means to be extraordinary<eos> An extraordinary person can see things others can't---<eos> and feel pain that others won't feel<eos> Maybe, I was never meant to see this world<eos> I don't want to terrified in bed every night---<eos> I don't want to terrified in bed every night--- then awaken horrors every morning<eos> I just want to be an ordinary person<eos> Dr. Lo, can you help me?<eos> Yes, of course I will
This is Pia.<eos> You're a dick<eos> And you believed the whole thing?<eos> In three months we're out of here<eos> So is this your girlfriend?<eos> Just a friend<eos> As much yours as mine<eos> There no longer is a 'mine' and 'yours' You can forget all that when you genuinely fall in love<eos> - When that happens<eos> - But it won't
What?<eos> Okay?<eos> She's in front of you.<eos> You're Mr. Nukui, right?<eos> Yes.<eos> What happened to your eyes<eos> I thought it would be better if I hadn't been able to see.<eos> I think my boyfriend will soon be here.<eos> When he comes, please leave.<eos> I will.
Young Mistress! Young Mistress! Young Mistress!<eos> What?<eos> The young master, he... this is terrible!<eos> Hurry!<eos> Liyan!<eos> Give him air!<eos> Quick, call Master Zhang... and call Little Sister back from school!<eos> Alright.<eos> Tell Master Zhang to bring his medical kit.<eos> I will!
No!<eos> Mum, dad, read a bedtime story!<eos> - Hayflower will read!<eos> Good night.<eos> - Good night.<eos> Hayflower?<eos> - You mustn't talk after good night.<eos> Who will peel my potatoes when you're at school?<eos> - Mum and dad.<eos> No, they won't!
He said...<eos> He invented questioning.<eos> Before Socrates, no questioning.<eos> Everyone sort of went, "Yeah, I suppose so."<eos> So after Socrates, he taught Plato, who's, I'm sure, in a documentary.<eos> He taught Aristotle, who said the sun goes around the earth - wrong!<eos> But in his day you didn't have to prove a theory.<eos> Nowadays if you say, "l think that soot is the elixir of life,<eos> "if mixed with water." Then they say, "Prove it!"<eos> "l will!
The City of Tokyo Winter, 1899<eos> What are these?<eos> Here. Make sure you pack this.<eos> Yes, yes...<eos> We'll never get do.<eos> Sure we will.
She's no longer on the team.<eos> Fine, but if I'm gonna take over an entire department, I want a bump in pay.<eos> Just do it, Milo.<eos> You'll be taken care of.<eos> It appears that someone may have had a gun.<eos> Right now, Senator David Palmer...<eos> Bam!<eos> - That's all we have.<eos> - Mark, call me the minute you find out.<eos> - I will.
I should have a rough longitude in a couple of minutes, though triangulating the longitude is gonna be trickier.<eos> This is Dave Thompson.<eos> We're seeing congestion in North Hollywood around the Grant Street Elementary School.<eos> Senator Palmer is due to make an appearance there and quite a few supporters and media are hoping to catch a glimpse of the candidate who is not letting this morning's incident interfere with his schedule today.<eos> I don't understand the rationale behind it.<eos> No, listen to me.<eos> Why?<eos> Why defend something that you don't need to defend?<eos> Maureen won't come out with the story today.<eos> - She will.
It's not sealed.<eos> I expect you'll examine it.<eos> You should.<eos> Why are you doing this?<eos> I thought I made that plain.<eos> I love my son.<eos> And it's the only way I know to ensure he'll go on loving me.<eos> He won't accept this at first.<eos> He'll try to find me.<eos> He never will.
Angel's right.<eos> Seltrax is potent, but it doesn't cause catatonia.<eos> I'm picking up some hard-core woo-woo vibes.<eos> This ain't medical, kids.<eos> It's mystical.<eos> There's so much we don't know.<eos> If she's taking a drug this powerful in secret the visions are more damaging than she lets on.<eos> - This one must've overloaded her.<eos> - She'll come out of it.<eos> - She will!
Restraints.<eos> Sometimes the visions make him violent.<eos> 171 Oak.... 171 Oak Drive.<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I feel better.<eos> I can be alone.<eos> I won't run away.<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> - This is one of his good days.<eos> No, I won't.
Except for the terrible knot inside. Which isn't the food at all. It's us.<eos> What's wrong with us?<eos> - It's nothing.<eos> - Oh, that helps.<eos> - Maybe we should go. - We should stay here and you should stop lying to me.<eos> I know something's wrong.<eos> Just be honest and tell me.<eos> Charles.<eos> Charles. [VOICES ECHOING] FRED:<eos> No, we won't.
Nice and empty.<eos> You should have seen the size of the dust bunnies under Cordy's bed.<eos> More like dust sperm-whales.<eos> I can't believe it's been three months.<eos> We paid the rent for the first couple but then things got sort of tight.<eos> And, well, big apartment, no one living here.<eos> Phantom Dennis.<eos> Does he know anything about Cordy? Where she might be?<eos> He's just ticked we haven't brought her home already.<eos> We will, though.
Now, we can't have that.<eos> Leave it to me, Manny.<eos> - Sorry to trouble you, Gus.<eos> - No trouble.<eos> What did he say, the midget?<eos> - You mustn't call him...<eos> - He's a midget.<eos> A tiny midget.<eos> - What if he overheard?<eos> - He won't!
Good.<eos> I figured you were a solid guy.<eos> Sorry I had to do that to you, but it was the only way.<eos> Sort of like a test.<eos> You know?<eos> But don't worry.<eos> You passed.<eos> Remember, though, that is between you and me.<eos> To do this, your friend better get here soon.<eos> He will.
Jen, don't you think you've given this the old college try?<eos> This much effort's beneath you.<eos> You said so yourself, didn't you?<eos> Oh, you can't hold the ultimatums of party Jen against me.<eos> I was wearing a wig.<eos> Feeling crazy.<eos> All right.<eos> Hey, tell you what.<eos> Bring Grams too.<eos> -Maybe I will.
-l got it, Mom.<eos> Thanks.<eos> So, Jen, how's school going?<eos> Have you thought about a major yet?<eos> Not really. I'm just trying to take it day by day right now.<eos> So how is the lovely Lily Leery?<eos> She took her first steps the other day.<eos> She was, like, so cute.<eos> You haven't put the baby gate up yet. On the stairs.<eos> -Honey, I will.
That's what I represent to you?<eos> No, not you.<eos> Us.<eos> I started this year thinking that I had to say goodbye to you, but I was wrong.<eos> Dawson, you're a huge part of my life, past, present and future and I have to start getting used to that because you make my life better, not worse.<eos> Then come with me.<eos> Right now.<eos> Come with me, Jo.<eos> I can't.<eos> And I won't.
Are you embarking on the epic freshman summer adventure?<eos> Well, if you can call going back to Capeside an adventure.<eos> -At least it's beautiful in the summer.<eos> -Yeah, and.... lt just feels like this year was such a great step forward.<eos> And going back feels kind of like two steps back.<eos> Not to mention....<eos> -What?<eos> -Nothing. There's just something I gotta do.<eos> Well, I look forward to hearing about it in the fall.<eos> You will.
Listen, I just wanted to apologize for this afternoon--<eos> You can have it.<eos> -Excuse me?<eos> -The flat.<eos> You can have it.<eos> I just didn't want to give your little friend there the satisfaction. But he was right about the security.<eos> The neighbours got broken into twice last year.<eos> So, if you like, you can move in at the weekend.<eos> You will not regret this.<eos> Oh, yes, I will.
They let us come, and they let us go.<eos> What kind of ident card gets us that kind of reception and send off?<eos> I am a Shepherd.<eos> - Folks like a man of God.<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> Men of God make everyone feel guilty and judged.<eos> Thas not what I saw.<eos> You like to tell me what really happened?<eos> I surely would.<eos> And maybe someday I will.
I brought a very special bottle.<eos> It's in the car.<eos> Um, you two, you just, uh, keep reminiscing.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Hello, lovely dog.<eos> - Hello.<eos> - Hello.<eos> [CAR ALARM BEEPS] - Bastard.<eos> Take that back.<eos> - I will not.
Guess I'm just used to rattling around here all by myself.<eos> Sometimes I think this is too much space for just one person.<eos> - You know...<eos> - Yes?<eos> - You could live here.<eos> - Are you asking me?<eos> - Would you like to?<eos> - Would you like me to?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then I will.
- You could live here.<eos> - Are you asking me?<eos> - Would you like to?<eos> - Would you like me to?<eos> - Yeah.<eos> - Then I will.
- Oh, you know, wait.<eos> - I do have one question. - Yeah.<eos> Do you guys do random drug testing?<eos> Boy, we, uh, hadn't really thought of that.<eos> That's cool.<eos> But if you do, I'm gonna need three days' notice.<eos> Okey-dokey.<eos> Wow. We're never gonna find a nanny.<eos> Come on, Rach.<eos> We will.
Hey, I helped you find Waldo!<eos> - Oh, good, you haven't left yet.<eos> - Where have you been?<eos> I got held up at Dr. Gettleman's office, um.<eos> There was some guy that, uh, freaked everybody out.<eos> You got here just in time.<eos> I really have to go, buddy.<eos> Oh, man.<eos> - Promise to call me when you land?<eos> - Of course I will.
But that creep I went on that date with goes there so I had to find a new one.<eos> I also have to find a new video store, a new bank a new adult bookstore, a new grocery store...<eos> - What?<eos> - A new grocery store.<eos> The universe said I was gonna meet a nice guy and that's what they gave me?<eos> When I get up there, I'm gonna kick some ass.<eos> Don't worry, Phoebe, you're gonna meet someone.<eos> If I can meet a great guy, so can you.<eos> Yeah, we both can.<eos> And we both will.
Fine, in deference to your soul, I'll turn mine down.<eos> Hey, here's a crazy thought.<eos> How about you tell your mom the truth and insist that she lets you play with the band and rehearse in Stars Hollow loudly as long as your schoolwork doesn't suffer?<eos> - Oh, I'm sorry, was that a serious suggestion?<eos> - Hey, it's worth a shot.<eos> No, you're thinking your mom, here, Rory.<eos> If I said that to mine, she'd start waving a crucifix at me.<eos> If she says no, she says no, but right now you're out of options.<eos> We have another call, just think about it?<eos> Okay, I will.
Hold a moment, Lorelai.<eos> Do you know where Christopher is?<eos> - Why?<eos> - We wanted him to come with you and Rory tomorrow, even though apparently Rory's getting back Saturday, though I couldn't sworn it was tomorrow.<eos> Christopher's away on business but I'll tell him you invited him.<eos> And tell him to come with you two next week.<eos> I wanna see the three of you together.<eos> - Yes, that would be a nice picture.<eos> - All right, see you tomorrow.<eos> Yes, you will.
- I do want to know.<eos> He's a fascist, a racist, and I tell you, you don't want to be alone in a room with him.<eos> Quite a one with the ladies, fancies himself.<eos> I heard it said he was on the take.<eos> It would have to be him, wouldn't it?<eos> Talk about sod's law.<eos> So much for Mr. Invisible.<eos> I can't believe Garrett knows you.<eos> - What's going to happen when he sees you?<eos> - He won't.
- He's gonna screw everything up!<eos> - Look at us, bro, we are burning up!<eos> We can't just keep tatting up.<eos> We need fresh blood to keep this dream alive.<eos> Now go get a brew and chill out.<eos> Come on.<eos> Listen, bro.<eos> I went out on a limb for you just now.<eos> Don't let me down again.<eos> I won't.
- I am.<eos> - Then do something.<eos> You listen to me.<eos> I don't wanna go through that again.<eos> If you were really my friend and had the power to stop it, you'd stop it.<eos> The hardest part of being who or what I am is having the power to change the things I wanna change, and knowing that I can't.<eos> Even when I'm certain, even when it's absolutely clear to me, even when it affects the people I care about.<eos> For all I can do, I'm no more qualified to play God than the Goa'uld are.<eos> - Baal will keep this up.<eos> - Yes, he will.
We got him, dudes.<eos> All right.<eos> Get your butt up those stairs and over to your party.<eos> I'm not goin'.<eos> Steven, you're 18 now.<eos> It's time to start being a man.<eos> And the first rule to being a man is... you gotta spend your life doing crap you don't wanna do.<eos> Like right now, I don't wanna be here talkin' to you... but I am.<eos> And you don't wanna go to a party... but you will.<eos> Actually, I won't.
How's she doing?<eos> Okay, I guess.<eos> She's out of the ICU.<eos> Moving slow, but moving, you know?<eos> Jimmy, you ain't been to see her?<eos> No.<eos> I couldn't go in.<eos> This ain't about you, right?<eos> I get back from Jersey, I will.<eos> I will.
How do you figure that?<eos> No, it's all in the numbers.<eos> It makes perfect sense.<eos> The numbers led us to the killer... the killer led us to the garage and now all we've done is recognize... the killer's real serial pattern.<eos> So you're saying I didn't have anything to do with it.<eos> - Hey, keep your hands up.<eos> - Why?<eos> I don't know.<eos> - What's this about numbers?<eos> - Will you just...
Seems I'm level begging with Mr Powell.<eos> - Won't he want to kill you now?<eos> - No, silly.<eos> His problem is that he needs the piece that I have.<eos> Until then, I'm his new best friend.<eos> What about the other half?<eos> The final alignment is in 66 hours and 53 minutes.<eos> We've still got no idea where the second piece is hidden.<eos> He's going to tell me where it is.<eos> - He will?
- They didn't say?<eos> - No.<eos> It was actually kind of weird.<eos> They were making a point not to say.<eos> - Are we going to the opera?<eos> - Yes.<eos> Sorry.<eos> Yes, we are going.<eos> You got tickets?<eos> No, but I will.
The main course... the rest of you... won't be served until seven hours later.<eos> But during that time... you'll be able to enjoy the effects of the consumed appetizer... with a full-bodied saline drip.<eos> I guess you wish now... you'd fed the rest of me to the dogs.<eos> No, Mason.<eos> No, I much prefer you the way you are.<eos> So... dinner at 8:00.<eos> You will stay for the evening's entertainment... won't you, Cordell?<eos> If it's all right with you...<eos> I think I'd rather not.<eos> Rather not... or will not?
Oh, my God! Oh!<eos> I need a doctor!<eos> A doctor!<eos> I have a pass.<eos> I have a pass!<eos> You must let her cross.<eos> Please!<eos> -It's useless.<eos> She'll never make it.<eos> -No! No, she will!
But I'll be with you night after night.<eos> If I'm alone, then you won't be with me.<eos> I shall, because I'm your friend, and friends are always together, even when they're apart.<eos> And I, shall I be with you?<eos> Yes, you'll be with me.<eos> Wherever I go, I'll always see the light of your window.<eos> Tell my father that I'm with you.<eos> I shall.<eos> Are you going to see him?<eos> Perhaps I will, perhaps not.
Oh sweet... "Give me a kiss, give me a kiss ... "<eos> Anne, wait for me outside.<eos> You know I can't.<eos> Mrs. Mills, close all the curtains.<eos> My daughter is going to cross the living room. Yes ma'am.<eos> All right darling.<eos> Darling, m u m my can't be with you all the time, h m m?<eos> You m ust learn to be on your own.<eos> Ah, whenever you feel afraid I want you to squeeze it with all your might and say an Our Father and then your fear will go away.<eos> It won't... Yes, yes it will. Honestly.
This is really nice of you to do this for me.<eos> And I'm sorry if I went too far, but I did need this ride.<eos> So I really appreciate it.<eos> Thanks.<eos> Right here.<eos> What do you plan to do with that?<eos> Commit a heinous crime. What else?<eos> You'll wait for me, right?<eos> Right?<eos> Of course you will.
That's okay in a marriage of convenience?<eos> They arrested him on the border with cash and medicines.<eos> What's a Kosovan like? Explosive?<eos> What can we do?<eos> I can't stay here...<eos> I have to go to Paraíso!<eos> If you report it now, we can handle it.<eos> - Your husband will stay here?<eos> - Yes.<eos> But you won't.
It said she had changed plans.<eos> He was to meet her in DuChamps.<eos> And then he sent some man to meet this Lord Buckingham where the ferry comes in.<eos> The Queen did not want to write it, but he said he would slit my throat if she did not.<eos> He would have.<eos> You're lucky.<eos> He has an army. What will you do?<eos> Get an army of my own.<eos> And find him. When you do, give him this.<eos> I will.
You're like a celebrity, man.<eos> I kept calling you. Where you been?<eos> We stayed at a hotel.<eos> My dad saw you at the golf course.<eos> You sleepwalking again?<eos> - I don't wanna talk about it.<eos> - Now you're famous, have a smoke.<eos> What happens if you tell Mom and Dad?<eos> You'll put Ariel in the garbage disposal.<eos> - Goddamn right I will.
It doesn't play anymore.<eos> There's only the market now, and it doesn't care who you are.<eos> People still need values and beliefs.<eos> No, they don't.<eos> Not the smart ones.<eos> Look... I'll give you five grand if you can document your tax exempt status.<eos> But when you fall off this horse, come see me.<eos> I can show you how to make a lot of money.<eos> I don't care about money.<eos> You will.
I want you to describe to me exactly Alice's response when you give her the message - how she looks, what happens.<eos> I said it was an unconventional request.<eos> I suppose you won't tell me why you can't do it.<eos> Let's just say it's complicated and embarrassing.<eos> Alice and I aren't talking.<eos> That's why I need you.<eos> - It seems weird, but it's not that strange.<eos> - It is strange.<eos> - You won't do it?<eos> . - Of course I will.
Let's go.<eos> But I want to stay with Mommy.<eos> You can't, Annie.<eos> We'll come back tomorrow.<eos> Then I want to go home.<eos> You can't do that either.<eos> We're going over to my house.<eos> I want to sleep in my own room.<eos> I'll sleep there with you if you want.<eos> You will?
Get out of my store.<eos> Asshole.<eos> Freak.<eos> That little bitch!<eos> Hi, I'd like to apply for the job.<eos> No way!<eos> Why not?<eos> You look like my mom.<eos> If I haven't developed pictures before, will somebody train me?<eos> I will.
we'll hang soon.<eos> Bring your mask if you want.<eos> I'm getting used to it.<eos> - Wait a minute.<eos> - What?<eos> I don't know.<eos> You drank too much.<eos> Call me tomorrow.<eos> Tomorrow I'll wish I was dead.<eos> No, you won't.
I saw it, Dad.<eos> You killed her.<eos> I didn't kill her, son. I destroyed her.<eos> She was a demon.<eos> You know, I wasn't so sure I could do it myself.<eos> I mean, she looked like a woman to me too.<eos> But after I touched her, all I could see was the evil.<eos> And I had to do it.<eos> I'm sorry you didn't see it too.<eos> You will next time.
- Hi, Mr. K. Thank you.<eos> How long must I stay with these people?<eos> They're drunk and starting to touch.<eos> Hang in there.<eos> If Hal doesn't show with the film they'll be busy finding where to build the gallows.<eos> What?<eos> I don't think that's funny.<eos> Is that pussy boy?<eos> - He's going to jump.<eos> - He won't.
No, I mean the boots.<eos> Would that be a good thing?<eos> - It'd pass the time.<eos> - I assure you, it'd be an occupation.<eos> - A relaxation.<eos> - A recreation.<eos> - A relaxation.<eos> -Try.<eos> - You'll help me?<eos> - I will of course.
The problem isn't with me.<eos> This never happened to me. Me neither!<eos> -What?<eos> -Since you brought it up, recently I've been having a hard time coming.<eos> Excuse me?<eos> Just a sec.<eos> You stress me out and it's a turnoff. Yes?<eos> No, no, don't arrest him, keep on following him.<eos> Shimon, set them up.<eos> -OK. No, I won't.
Shimon, set them up.<eos> -OK. No, I won't.<eos> Set them up!<eos> -No.<eos> Set them up!<eos> -No. -Set them up!<eos> -No.<eos> If you don't put the gun down, I'll blow your head open.<eos> Set them up!<eos> -OK. No, I won't.
That's good.<eos> -Can i feel?<eos> -No.<eos> -Why not?<eos> -l don't want you to.<eos> It's perfectly normal.<eos> They kick.<eos> They grow.<eos> -This will never end.<eos> -Of course it will.
You've got to trust me.<eos> - I know what I'm doing.<eos> - Liam.<eos> You've got to give me 24 hours.<eos> I've just got to put a few things together, that's all.<eos> I like you, Dave.<eos> I really like you.<eos> I won't let anything happen to you.<eos> I promise.<eos> I won't.
- Pass me the salt. ...very sad I'm staying.<eos> - Would you like some lemon? ...if you weren't meant for me?<eos> Don't you like it?<eos> Yes, it's beautiful.<eos> A little sad, though.<eos> It's just a song.<eos> I wouldn't like to be crying around for a parting love.<eos> But that will never happen, my honey pie.<eos> You'll never leave me?<eos> I won't.
You want to ride a little pony?<eos> I apologize.<eos> It's the only Spanish I know.<eos> I learned it from a nanny.<eos> Ms. Cortez, do you really deny that Mr. Adams taught you these moves?<eos> Of course I deny it.<eos> Please.<eos> I don't have to listen to this.<eos> You can't stop me.<eos> And you won't.
- Ally...<eos> - No.<eos> I am too old for games.<eos> And I am way beyond men...<eos> Before you...<eos> You expect some badge of honor because you came forward with it yourself?<eos> If you'll let me speak...<eos> I think you should leave.<eos> No.<eos> I won't.
All that rage and hatred bubbling to the surface.<eos> I've never done this to a vampire.<eos> Should be entertaining.<eos> Please, go.<eos> I can't.<eos> I have this problem.<eos> This is happening to you because of me.<eos> Because of me.<eos> So I can't leave you, Angel.<eos> I won't.
There's an idea. A hospital.<eos> Oh, wait.<eos> They don't admit vampires.<eos> - Who says we have to admit?<eos> - We don't need the right doctor.<eos> We just need the right equipment.<eos> I don't care.<eos> Just find somebody who can answer the bloody question.<eos> Heads will roll if the senior partners hear of this.<eos> They won't.
You're gonna have me killed.<eos> Why couldn't you have had such foresight when we needed it?<eos> We are telling the truth.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Intelligence is coming in.<eos> No one knows how Darla got pregnant.<eos> There's a prophecy involving a vampire birth but the scroll it' s recorded on is missing.<eos> Do you have any idea how many groups and cults would kill to get their hands on this baby?<eos> - We gotta get it before anybody knows.<eos> - And we will.
- I did.<eos> - They'll remember you?<eos> - They should.<eos> They better!<eos> Angel.<eos> I told her she'd be safe with me.<eos> I know.<eos> We've gotta do something.<eos> They'll kill Angel.<eos> No, they won't.
NOEL: Dr. Crane.<eos> DENNIS: Crane man.<eos> JASON: What's going on?<eos> Well, my show, in about two minutes.<eos> Uh, what can I do for you, gentlemen?<eos> Sue invited all of us to her place to watch the fight tonight on pay-per-view.<eos> Right.<eos> Uh, well, as tempting as that sounds, I'm afraid I'll have to decline.<eos> - Okay, we'll catch you next time.<eos> - Well, actually, you won't.
Can you do it tomorrow?<eos> No, I have to go in a few hours.<eos> I have to be on the redeye.<eos> Listen, next time you're in Minsk...<eos> Phoebe?<eos> Can I talk to you for a second?<eos> What are you doing?<eos> I have plans with Joey. So?<eos> He'll understand.<eos> No, he won't.
-Joey, what are you doing?<eos> -Just what needs to be done.<eos> -Dearly beloved, we're gathered here..<eos> -This is crazy.<eos> Don't interrupt me when I'm talking to God!<eos> -Where were we?<eos> Do you take this man..?<eos> -No!<eos> -You'll take him.<eos> -No, I won't!
- Survive?<eos> - Of course.<eos> It's obvious.<eos> There's only one person with the maturity, the experience and the skills to take me driving.<eos> - Michael, are you busy?<eos> - What?<eos> - Michael's 12!<eos> - 13. But it's what inside that counts.<eos> You'll be inside if you get caught.<eos> He won't.
While your father's taking Janey to her test,<eos> I thought I'd use my people skills to negotiate a truce.<eos> - Like the United Nations.<eos> - With as much success.<eos> Mr Casey will be here any minute.<eos> Michael, be on your best behaviour.<eos> And Nick...<eos> Actually, both of you, go to your rooms.<eos> - Have you told Dad about this?<eos> - No, but I will.
Well... i'm saving that for you.<eos> I'll be right back.<eos> Where you going?<eos> Bathroom.<eos> Do you think it's a good idea to let him go alone?<eos> Would you like me to hold it for him?<eos> Hah! No, i mean, after what happened last time.<eos> It's called trust.<eos> Yeah, you can trust he'll end up in the emergency room.<eos> Maybe he won't.
TO PLEAD GUILTY.<eos> WOULD HE HAVE TO GO TO JAIL?<eos> NO, NOT FOR A FIRST OFFENSE.<eos> I MEAN, YOU'D PAY A FINE.<eos> I'LL TAKE IT.<eos> PAY THE $2.00 AND BE DONE WITH IT.<eos> AND IT WILL BE ON YOUR RECORD. PERMANENTLY.<eos> WHAT, YOU MEAN AS A SEX OFFENDER?<eos> OH, WILL THEY MAKE HIM REGISTER WITH THE POLICE AND EVERYTHING?<eos> YEAH, THEY WILL.
BECAUSE IT WAS WORTHLESS.<eos> DON'T GO.<eos> YOU CAN'T GO.<eos> WHAT'RE YOU GONNA DO WITHOUT ME? [ Chuckle ]<eos> I DON'T KNOW, I GUESS I'LL SURVIVE.<eos> I DOUBT IT.<eos> [ Heavy sigh ] WHAT ABOUT ME?<eos> I'M SURE YOU'LL GET ALONG JUST FINE ON YOUR OWN.<eos> NO, I WON'T.<eos> YEAH, YOU WILL.
I don't choose which part of you I love, like some kind of chicken!<eos> It was just so much easier when you were little and you would tell me everything.<eos> And when you were upset, I could always fix it.<eos> I don't know how to take care of you anymore.<eos> Just let me...<eos> Just let me take care of myself.<eos> But do you?<eos> I'm afraid that you don't.<eos> I do.<eos> I will.
People being shattered!<eos> Do not worry.<eos> We get funerals too.<eos> I'm so happy.<eos> I can't wait to come back tomorrow.<eos> You're not going to be like this every day, though, right?<eos> This flag is presented on behalf of a grateful nation as a token of our appreciation for honorable and faithful services rendered by your loved one.<eos> Give it to one of his friends.<eos> I love you, David.<eos> I always will.
- She can't go.<eos> Why not?<eos> She has to help me pick prints. - Does she have to do it tonight?<eos> - Yes, she does.<eos> Billy's got a show coming up at a gallery in Westwood.<eos> Sometimes she gives me her eyes because sometimes I go blind.<eos> Forty-six hours I've been looking at these pictures and sometimes I see amazing things and sometimes I just see shapes, and that's when I go blind.<eos> Because what if I lost the ability to tell the difference?<eos> For real.<eos> - For good. - You won't.
At least you got out of here.<eos> I live in a shitty apartment which was supposed to be temporary.<eos> I work at a job, also supposed to be temporary until I figured out what I wanted to do with my life, which apparently is nothing.<eos> I have lots of sex, but my relationships don't last more than a couple months.<eos> I don't even have the self-discipline to floss daily.<eos> I've had four root canals!<eos> I'm 35, I've had four root canals.<eos> I'm gonna be a loser who ends up in his deathbed saying:<eos> - "Where'd my life go?"<eos> - No, you won't.
- Hi.<eos> - Where were you ?<eos> - When ?<eos> - This morning.<eos> I was in bed.<eos> Why was today important to me, Tim ?<eos> Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget. - I won't.<eos> Being promoted to sergeant Saturday, - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.
- This morning.<eos> I was in bed.<eos> Why was today important to me, Tim ?<eos> Being promoted to sergeant next week,<eos> - don't forget. - I won't.<eos> Being promoted to sergeant Saturday, - don't forget.<eos> - I won't.<eos> What was that ?<eos> I'm being promoted tomorrow, - don't forget.<eos> - I won't !
0r have you forgotten the good times ?<eos> No, of course not.<eos> We were supposed to go ghost-hunting last week.<eos> - I know.<eos> - Where were you ?<eos> I can't remember.<eos> Well, I'm glad you're happy with your new girlfriend.<eos> Don't forget whose shoulder you cried on - when you got dumped. - I won't.<eos> 0r when Johnny Alpha got killed by that monster in 2000AD.<eos> Mike, I won't.
I thought it was quite nice.<eos> So are you gonna tell her ?<eos> Marsha, what is your problem ?<eos> I'll tell her, then.<eos> Why do you want to spoil her birthday ?<eos> Every second you leave it, it'll make it more painful for her.<eos> - What ?<eos> - I'm telling her.<eos> - Don't !<eos> - I will.
Who's that ?<eos> - Dexter and Cromwell.<eos> - Exactly.<eos> - Who did this ? - They did !<eos> - They wouldn't.<eos> - They would.<eos> - We're screwed.<eos> - We can't give up.<eos> We're never gonna fix him now.<eos> - Yes we will.
Well, I'm going down to the saloon to look for the guy who shot my paw.<eos> Oh, my God!<eos> That was Woofy, and he talked to us!<eos> Guys, we gotta pick a place to meet in case we split up.<eos> How about the corner of Fun Street and Fun Boulevard?<eos> I mean, that should be easy enough for even Michael to remember.<eos> Michael?<eos> - Great.<eos> Now we'll never find him.<eos> - Sure we will.
Damn it!<eos> Never marry your high school sweetheart.<eos> - Oh, hey, did I tell you...<eos> - Heard it!<eos> Who ate the last doughnut?<eos> I did.<eos> Son of a bitch.<eos> You ate the first 11!<eos> Oh, shut up!<eos> No, I won't.
I'm gonna go talk to him.<eos> You can't turn off the clock!<eos> She doesn't understand the clock.<eos> Cocoa Puff!<eos> Mashed potato!<eos> - What are you doing here?<eos> - Well, I wanted to see you... because I wanted to ask you something.<eos> - Will you go out with me this Saturday?<eos> - Oh, my God.<eos> Course I will!
Really?<eos> Okay, just wait.<eos> 'Cause I... I just...<eos> I wanna do this right.<eos> Jackie... from the first minute that I saw you... I knew that I wanted to fool around with you.<eos> And then, after we did that... and I still wanted to talk to you?<eos> I knew that I never wanted to be without you.<eos> So... will you accept my ring?<eos> Yeah.<eos> Yeah, Michael, I will.
That doe'sn't mean I won't do it.<eos> -Right.<eos> -You know why?<eos> -Doe'sn't matter.<eos> -Perseverance.<eos> You get back on the horse.<eos> I'II sit there and she'II say, "Sam Seaborn's impressive.<eos> -I'II say nice things about him. "<eos> -Reach for the stars.<eos> -I will.
- I'm sort of thinking one.<eos> Daddy has a present for you.<eos> Know what it is?<eos> It's a lucky clover to help you be successful, even at breakdancing.<eos> It belonged to someone very special.<eos> I know what name you want to give him. It's okay.<eos> Really?<eos> Son, I'm naming you Philip J. Fry in honor of my little brother, who I miss every day.<eos> I love you, Philip.<eos> And I always will.
- That's biblical.<eos> - That's real craftsmanship is what it is.<eos> - Solidas a rock.<eos> - Ooh !<eos> - It's supposed to do that.<eos> - It's perfect, guys.<eos> - And how's that egg coming ?<eos> This is a doubleyolker.<eos> - I don't see what this has to do with--<eos> You will.
What's the rush?<eos> He cracked reversion.<eos> You're kidding.<eos> -When?<eos> -While we were sleeping.<eos> You want a ride?<eos> Maybe we should take our own cars.<eos> I'm tired of this sneaking around, Lin.<eos> You're gonna have to tell him eventually.<eos> I will, eventually.
Grab my hand, damn it! Grab it!<eos> Come on! Come on!<eos> He needs dex. Now.<eos> No.<eos> We stick to the schedule.<eos> In nine hours, the water runs out.<eos> We need it.<eos> Our lives depend on it.<eos> He'll die if he doesn't get it.<eos> He will anyway.
Are you kiddin'?<eos> - I used to be a dancer.<eos> Please, call me French...<eos> Uh, Frances.<eos> Frances Fox Winkler.<eos> The Foxes from Saratoga?<eos> I don't know. I never checked my pedigree.<eos> Can we change the music, please?<eos> - I feel like I should be wearing a wig.<eos> - You will in a couple years.
- No.<eos> - Judge Peterman, 10th circuit.<eos> His briefs will never be the same again.<eos> Ellen?<eos> Believe me, this isn't a line or anything, but you really look very beautiful tonight.<eos> Would you... care to dance?<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Did you see that big lady dancing?<eos> - This is a night I'll never forget.<eos> - Neither will anyone else.
We don't have to be here.<eos> Now, that would be the wrong thing to do. You know that.<eos> That'd be like a red rag to a bull.<eos> All I can do is tell him to his face that I'm not interested, that's all I can do.<eos> And I'm not.<eos> And I will tell him.<eos> Come here, give us a hug.<eos> He'll hurt you.<eos> No...<eos> He won't.
There's a thousand of these in Dallas, $750 a month.<eos> If the fountain keeps you awake, they give you free earplugs.<eos> - You have earplugs?<eos> - I have a set of first-time earplugs.<eos> This is it.<eos> - Oh, it's nice.<eos> It really is nice.<eos> See?<eos> You want to put those right there?<eos> All right, I will.
I'm not a killer.<eos> I'mjust someone who wanted to make things right.<eos> Can Ijust let myself forget what you've told me?<eos> Can Ijust let myself forget what you made me do?<eos> You think Ijust want another puzzle to solve?<eos> Another John G to look for?<eos> You're a John G.<eos> So you can be my John G.<eos> Do I lie to myself to be happy?<eos> In your case, Teddy,... .. yes, I will.
I know, I know.<eos> But apparently he had some kind of highly infectious virus.<eos> They had to put him down.<eos> It's the law.<eos> Oliver was licking Clara's face.<eos> Don't worry.<eos> I asked the same thing and the virus is harmless to humans.<eos> So, she's fine.<eos> This'll break her heart, you know that.<eos> No, it won't.
My father.<eos> I've spent my life waiting for him.<eos> My mother. I could never call her "Mom".<eos> I had my sisters...<eos> - What's wrong.<eos> Emilia?<eos> - I 'll run off! The police will stop you.<eos> Dad will fetch me!<eos> He promised! He'll never leave me.<eos> Sure he will...
Do you know how many fences there are in this county?<eos> And some pillars with an opening going through.<eos> And there's lots of white flowers I can--<eos> Yes.<eos> Is that where Jessie is?<eos> Well, that's all I'm seeing.<eos> This is mishmash.<eos> I said it wouldn't lead to nothing.<eos> You're right.<eos> It won't.
- Out of the question.<eos> - So do we wait here like sheep?<eos> Alzbetka is so young, she's got her whole life ahead of her.<eos> If something happened to her, I couldn't live.<eos> - Leave me out of it.<eos> - Don't exaggerate.<eos> No, I've decided.<eos> - And how will I go to school? - You won't!<eos> - And Dad to work?<eos> - He won't either.
Don't tell me we're moving just because I said this place sucks!<eos> - What's the matter, Jeanne?<eos> - What do you think?<eos> Why has it suddenly stopped sucking here?<eos> Because I've got used to it!<eos> I'm going to my room.<eos> - What's wrong?<eos> - Nothing!<eos> - Did you do your translation?<eos> - I will!
You'll make the pain stop, won't you?<eos> Takes time.<eos> It takes moments.<eos> Do it.<eos> Now.<eos> What?<eos> Make me what I was.<eos> - Darla--<eos> - You said you'd help me.<eos> I will.
- He's delirious.<eos> - I can save her.<eos> - Save whom?<eos> - Darla.<eos> If what you say is so, there's no saving Darla.<eos> It's too late.<eos> - It's not too late.<eos> - It is.<eos> She's dead already and she will rise again.<eos> She won't.
- Right.<eos> You can't go into those offices undetected.<eos> I'm not going to.<eos> That's what they want.<eos> You don't believe he's there.<eos> I was at the only meeting Lindsey had today.<eos> - So where are you going?<eos> - To his home.<eos> - I'll go with you.<eos> - We all will.
They're killing us!<eos> Killing us!<eos> And you just walked away?<eos> No, I walked to my car and then I drove away.<eos> You didn't do anything?<eos> You gave Darla and Drusilla free rein?<eos> I didn't bring either of them into this.<eos> They did.<eos> - You could've stopped them.<eos> - I will.
Three times shalt thou say these words:<eos> Unbind, unbind, unbind."<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Angel.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'll get Dr. Evans.<eos> I saw them all.<eos> There is so much pain.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will.
Unbind, unbind, unbind."<eos> - Hey.<eos> - Angel.<eos> Welcome back.<eos> I'll get Dr. Evans.<eos> I saw them all.<eos> There is so much pain.<eos> We have to help them.<eos> We will.<eos> We will.
He has to survive coming darkness, apocalyptic battles, plagues and some several, not that many fiends that will be unleashed upon the world.<eos> So don't break out the champagne just yet.<eos> Yeah, break out the champagne, Pinocchio.<eos> This is a big deal.<eos> I guess it is.<eos> Typical.<eos> I hook up with the only person who came to L.A. to get older.<eos> The senior partners were impressed with your sacrifice.<eos> Trust me. We'll even the score with him.<eos> Yes, we will.
You put it here.<eos> See?<eos> Oh, that's...<eos> Oh, I can feel that.<eos> And that goes right down...<eos> I think I may have got a nerve there.<eos> Oh, so that's what it's for.<eos> I can't feel my thighs.<eos> If you do change your mind...<eos> I won't.
And I can go a long, healthy stretch without seeing anything like that again.<eos> - It had to be Adam who killed it.<eos> But why?<eos> - He's studying biology.<eos> Human, demon, whatever he can get his hands on.<eos> - Learning what makes things work.<eos> - I don't wanna be around for the final exam.<eos> It's not coming to that.<eos> The Initiative created this and they can't stop it.<eos> But we will.
What happened up there?<eos> There was another girl.<eos> I'm sorry, Jo.<eos> The whole time that I was watching them, I just kept thinking:<eos> "This is it. This is real.<eos> Just like Pacey said.<eos> This is the real thing."<eos> And it reminded me, once again, what exactly I don't have.<eos> -lf you keep looking, you'll find it.<eos> -No, I won't.
You can't just leave without letting her know.<eos> I mean, that's not like you.<eos> You don't just stand and let things happen.<eos> And you don't run away, either.<eos> You have to tell her that you love her.<eos> And you have to try to get her back.<eos> Because if you don't I promise you, you will regret it.<eos> -Maybe.<eos> -No, Pacey.<eos> You will.
Hey, daniel, do you know how to fix a projector?<eos> No.<eos> We can teach ya.<eos> Great.<eos> This is terrible.<eos> Daniel's gonna ruin the only place we like in school.<eos> Yeah, why did mr. Rosso do this to us?<eos> I bet that daniel guy is high on drugs, And if we make him angry, he'll freak out and wreck the a.v. room.<eos> Oh, no!<eos> no, he won't.
He was a shrimp until he turned 16, and then he got all tall and muscular in a month.<eos> Now he looks like the Hulk.<eos> You really think I'll fill out?<eos> Yeah, not like me, though.<eos> In 3 years, I'm going to be enormous.<eos> Oh, yeah.<eos> Me, too. My dad is 6'3".<eos> Hey, listen, you guys.<eos> Why don't we go see Airplane again on saturday?<eos> Surely you will.
Yeah. ok.<eos> What's up?<eos> I was wondering... Do you want to come to mona's party with me?<eos> I'd love to.<eos> Really?<eos> Really.<eos> It's happening.<eos> They're smiling.<eos> Going out withcindy, And stops hanging out with us?<eos> He won't.
I'm sure she said it... because she was nervous because you're my best friends.<eos> And it was our first date.<eos> Plus, she's really sick.<eos> You said you made that up!<eos> But isn't the sick thing better than the play thing?<eos> They're both good.<eos> I generally just go with, "Monica's drunk again."<eos> Come on, please just give her another chance.<eos> -She'll come around, I promise.<eos> -Of course we will.
I heard something.<eos> Maybe we should go back?<eos> To what?<eos> I wish I had something.<eos> For what?<eos> To protect myself.<eos> From what?<eos> I don't know what.<eos> Be careful, Xev.<eos> I will.
How many entry points do you think there are in this house?<eos> - The front and back doors...<eos> - I make it 24.<eos> - 25 including the chimney.<eos> - 26 if they tunnel in.<eos> - What do you see there?<eos> - A window.<eos> I call it the welcome mat of death.<eos> - OK, we'll take it.<eos> - No, we won't!
We can't simply remove it, and no amount of threats from you is going to change that.<eos> They've locked a tractor beam onto the deflector.<eos> They're trying to tear it off.<eos> Hull stress is increasing.<eos> Breaches on Decks 10 and 1 1.<eos> lncrease shield strength and randomize the harmonics.<eos> They're adapting.<eos> Even with Voyager's deflector, your efforts to return to the hive will fail.<eos> They'll come for us.<eos> No, they won't.
If these treatments don't work, the crew will wind up liquefied.<eos> You're forgetting that the inoculations aren't designed to work alone.<eos> They were intended to work in combination with the shield modifications.<eos> It's the medicinal "ying" to the shields' "yang."<eos> A-and what if the "yang" doesn't work?<eos> That's not going to happen.<eos> Now, listen, Lieutenant Barclay has a special affinity for this crew.<eos> So do I.<eos> I promise you, we won't let them down.<eos> Of course you won't.
- I have told you.<eos> - And I'm supposed to trust you?<eos> You know, this whole "talking to two people in one body thing" really sucks.<eos> Shan'auc.<eos> It is good to finally see the face of she who taught me so much.<eos> To speak with you in words... It is something I never dreamed of.<eos> There will be time for words.<eos> You must stay a while.<eos> We have so much to talk about.<eos> - I will.
I-I like you. I really, really do.<eos> Uh, please.<eos> It was an accident.<eos> This room is shielded, so it won't affect any of the base's technology.<eos> Don't do this, please.<eos> What can I do to make you like me?<eos> - You sure this won't hurt us? - No.<eos> It's gonna hurt me.<eos> - We won't even feel it.<eos> - But I will.
When have things exploding been anticipated?<eos> - Now you're bringing me down.<eos> - I would think so.<eos> I thought he did well.<eos> Yeah.<eos> He did.<eos> I read the statement you wrote.<eos> Great.<eos> I'm sorry no one will read it.<eos> The president will.
Sure, it's his Joey Lucas suit.<eos> I'm regretting not getting waffles.<eos> I'm regretting having hired any of you.<eos> 42% job approval, and you're talking about waffles... ... andsomethingwithJosh.<eos> -He's wearing a suit for Joey Lucas.<eos> -For a guy named Joey?<eos> She's a woman, and I'm not dressed up for her.<eos> It's a Tuesday suit.<eos> Point is, we have to make it through the week with no mistakes.<eos> We will.
- That happens.<eos> - You never took a free lead...? - I always took a lead.<eos> Not from you.<eos> Why?<eos> In 20 minutes, you'll remember you're a professional and you're not gonna like me anymore.<eos> You think I like you now?<eos> As long as you keep grabbing me and kissing me, what the hell do I care?<eos> Good point.<eos> - If there's a story, I'll find it.<eos> - No, you won't.
You can't go on national TV and have a kid next to you on a whim.<eos> - You gotta vet this stuff.<eos> - What was the problem?<eos> It looked like you discovered child labor because Jeffrey told you.<eos> I don't believe that.<eos> I don't believe exercise makes me healthier.<eos> But you went to med school.<eos> You say so, then I go to the gym.<eos> Talk to Reeseman and tell her not to offer that amendment.<eos> - I will.
But that's what you intended, wasn't it, Sir?<eos> When you assigned me to the case.<eos> I'll ask the questions, John.<eos> You just give me some damn answers.<eos> Don't come back until you do.<eos> My dad always said it's not who wins or loses it's who takes the worst beating that counts.<eos> That supposed to cheer me up?<eos> I thought so.<eos> But then I never did get to see your opponent.<eos> And you never will.
I'm the only one hereabouts who has one.<eos> But thee might as well buy a new ship.<eos> It would be cheaper, I think, huh.<eos> Saying of which... how's thee gonna pay for all this, huh?<eos> I have 20,000 Republic dataries.<eos> Republic credits?<eos> Republic credits are no good out here.<eos> I need something more real.<eos> I don't have anything else, but credits will do fine.<eos> - No, they won't.

-What happened?<eos> I just saw a man fall seven stories into a platter of poached salmon!<eos> -Did he break anything?<eos> -Everything!<eos> They're still pulling capers out of him.<eos> People get depressed, they jump. It's a tragedy, but it ain't my fault.<eos> You're telling me it was a suicide?<eos> I think he left a note.<eos> Jelly, did they find it?<eos> No, but they will in a minute.
Chick, pick, lick, lick!<eos> Dick!<eos> Whereas, I am getting stronger and stronger!<eos> Hi, Andy.<eos> You wanna wrestle?<eos> Bob and I came up with an idea for a TV show.<eos> It would be a Saturday morning kind of thing where I can goof off with the kids.<eos> We can sell that, Andy.<eos> Did your doctor say it's okay to go back to work?<eos> No, but he will.
God!<eos> You were normal yesterday.<eos> I can't take this.<eos> Are you serious?<eos> Come and play<eos> What do you say?<eos> Douche-bag kangaroo.<eos> Are you all hopped out?<eos> I don't know what to do.<eos> Hopefully Vanessa will.
The caretaker was being difficult. I lost my temper.<eos> You must have had your reasons.<eos> I'm ashamed of myself.<eos> Am I always smiling?<eos> Not often enough at me.<eos> - I nearly killed him.<eos> - But you didn't.<eos> No, I didn't.<eos> Perhaps you'll kill me one day when you've had enough of me.<eos> Perhaps I will.
Good to see you too.<eos> -Are you married?<eos> -l'm between marriages.<eos> Between marriages?<eos> What do you do for dick?<eos> Can I be honest with you?<eos> This is a waste of my time.<eos> I come up with the edge we need, the stats, the probabilities, each week.<eos> I won't waste another season under Tony.<eos> You won't, okay?
-I don't need that.<eos> -I think I've solved that problem.<eos> Let's just say the problem has been buried.<eos> She's gone, I promise you.<eos> You're not very good at keeping promises.<eos> -You going to do something?<eos> -Me? She's the one with the gun.<eos> They're tough in Louisiana.<eos> Shoot me, and they'll give you the gas chamber.<eos> No, they won't.
We sent the little bitch back to Hell so she can go fuck with the Devil!<eos> What are you gonna do now, Frenchies?<eos> Why not come out and fight? Come on!<eos> Bastards, wake up!<eos> Or are you too busy praying to bring your little fucking witch back from the dead?<eos> Do you hear me?<eos> I hear you!<eos> I'm alive!<eos> May God forgive your blasphemy.<eos> For I never will.
Not at your service, then.<eos> Hans is acting strangely today.<eos> Do you know who the other one is?<eos> I think it's Colonel Schnefke.<eos> He does the same thing in Bohemia and Moravia that Hans does in Hungary.<eos> They're colleagues, so to speak.<eos> Eichbaum's only thinking about his Final Solution.<eos> But why destroy what you can sell? He just doesn't understand.<eos> So he can't find out about our little "transactions".<eos> He won't.
We are good friends.<eos> And great frog lovers.<eos> I'll fetch some wine, and some snacks for the kids.<eos> I'll go with you.<eos> We've missed you, you know.<eos> I was the one who was punished the most.<eos> By the way, 15 December is Tane's birthday.<eos> We do a big dinner at my place.<eos> Will you come?<eos> Of course I will.
Mr. Redding, I have here in my hand a letter which may seem familiar to you.<eos> Did you write this letter to Billy Redwood?<eos> Yes, I did.<eos> Would you do me the favor, please, of reading it aloud to the jury?<eos> If you like.<eos> "Dear Billy, I'm sorry I got you into this. It doesn't look good for you.<eos> The judge says you have no claim because you didn't show up.<eos> I don't know how it will go with me, but if I lose...<eos> God willing I have the strength to continue my fight... and with your help and friendship, I will."<eos> "With your help and friendship, I will." Will what?
- You have friends.<eos> - l can't take it.<eos> Don't leave me.<eos> You can't go to the monastery with me.<eos> - Listen...<eos> - l can too.<eos> You've never meditated.<eos> You always laughed when I talked about Zen.<eos> I'll kill myself.<eos> - No you won't.
- Are you here on your own?<eos> - Let her eat, babe.<eos> It's okay.<eos> It must seem strange...<eos> ...me just appearing.<eos> I was camping not far from here with my boyfriend.<eos> We were together, playing chess in the tent.<eos> Rob ran out to check the fire and he was gone.<eos> So he left you out here on your own?<eos> He wouldn't.
Move your foot and piss off!<eos> I want to come in.<eos> No more games, all right?<eos> Just get back home to mommy and daddy, okay?<eos> They're out.<eos> Then go back and wait for them.<eos> Don't you want your pen?<eos> What are you so worried about?<eos> I'm worried I'm going to belt you one if you don't get the fuck out!<eos> You wouldn't.
I run for Mother to get better, not to earn money.<eos> I have an agreement with the Virgin Mary: When I make it, she'll recover.<eos> Excuse us.<eos> You flipped out.<eos> It's loads of dough.<eos> Tough luck.<eos> - You won't take it?<eos> - Would you?<eos> Well...<eos> I would.
um, i'm sorry, i-i guess i just forgot.<eos> i'm sorry, sweetie.<eos> i don't want to fight tonight.<eos> it's our first weekiversary.<eos> on my suggestion,you... hey, wendy, uh,do me a favor and send a glass of champagne to that pretty young thing over there.<eos> what?<eos> over there.<eos> you.<eos> you're the pretty young thing... is what i meant.<eos> champagne? would you?
So I think that means that it's okay for you to tell.<eos> Rosie, it's time to tell now.<eos> One time when I woke up,<eos> Mommy was on the floor<eos> Going, "scrape, scrape, scrapey,"<eos> like this on the floor. She said, "Come on, it's a game."<eos> I cried, and she cried too, and she fell asleep on the floor.<eos> And the next time you woke up, she was gone, wasn't she?<eos> If I played the game with her like she wanted me to, would she still be here?<eos> No, she wouldn't.
I thought who better to ask than my Canadian relatives.<eos> Bob and Estelle.<eos> But they wouldn't cross the border into America.<eos> They wanted me to meet them at Sears. In Canada.<eos> What are you guys doing here?<eos> - We're buying insurance.<eos> - We're going to the States to see you.<eos> Right, that's just across the river.<eos> You wouldn't go over to see us in Michigan for a couple of hours without insurance?<eos> No, we wouldn't.
Sex was different back then.<eos> Yeah. Everything was so much more free, you know?<eos> No rules, no ambitions, no jealousies.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> No shaved pubic hair.<eos> Mm-hmm.<eos> And no diseases that you couldn't take care of with a visit to the doctor and a quick shot of penicillin.<eos> Today-- let me tell you something-- these kids gotta wear a coat of armor before they park their car in any woman's garage.<eos> I would wear three or four.<eos> Yeah, you would.
Um, do you have any suggestions?<eos> Just let yourself in. I'll be right out.<eos> Good evening, Willy.<eos> So, what do you think?<eos> Oh, yeah, that's... really... really, really nice of you.<eos> A simple "no, thank you"... is the preferred etiquette when declining a gift.<eos> It takes a very special sort of person... to look into someone's eyes and shoot them, Willy.<eos> A certain kind of strength... if you know what I mean.<eos> Well, I guess you'd know that, wouldn't you?<eos> Oh, yes, I would.
It's all yours.<eos> Here, take this chair. I'm gonna go drink in the corner.<eos> You're, uh... you're donating it?<eos> Everything?<eos> I'll get more.<eos> Do you always travel this light?<eos> It's the only way to move.<eos> Oh, you- You've talked a good deal about your extraordinary amount of living. What do you think of dying, John?<eos> Do you fear death?<eos> Who wouldn't?
"It should have been me"?<eos> Maybe.<eos> Yeah, Art has told me that some of your early fellows feared you were stealing their lives.<eos> Have you thought that perhaps you were? Perhaps you are!<eos> There have always been legends of such a thing, a creature not quite human taking not the blood, but the life force itself?<eos> My God, Will.<eos> Unconsciously, perhaps, by some biological or psychic mechanism that we can only guess at.<eos> I'm not saying you would do such a thing deliberately.<eos> I'm not saying that you would even know how to...<eos> Would you?
So I pulled myself together and I quit drinking, cold turkey.<eos> So since all that, this is pretty much me.<eos> Do you ever travel, Mr. Franz?<eos> No, I can't seem to get too far from my leather.<eos> I do a lot of leather engraving.<eos> I got a little workshop out in the garage.<eos> Between that and my pension, I do pretty well.<eos> But every time I think I might take a trip somewhere, I get too far behind on orders and such to consider it.<eos> When we finish eating, I'd love to see your workshop.<eos> - Would you?
But I showed up.<eos> I am not a new me, okay?<eos> I'm not new now just because you met me!<eos> Okay, fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> You could really forget about everything, huh?<eos> You could forget everything if I just burned that box?<eos> Yes.<eos> That I was ever somebody different.<eos> Yes, I would.
I'm sorry!<eos> I didn't mean to...<eos> Pretty thirsty, huh?<eos> - None of your business!<eos> I don't understand it, Dad.<eos> Why don't you just go and talk to her?<eos> Or to that baker asshole?<eos> - What good would it do?<eos> That wouldn't win Vera back.<eos> But that would?
- Fuck you!<eos> Then we called it a night.<eos> We were all just really exhausted.<eos> What the fuck?<eos> !<eos> You would've loved it.<eos> It was an incredible, unbelievable night.<eos> That sounds like a lot of fun.<eos> You know, I'd love to go do something like that sometime.<eos> Who wouldn't?
wow, Lois, I had no idea.<eos> save it, Smallville.<eos> I was obviously on something.<eos> thank god the ink wears off in a week.<eos> well, I guess it's best that neither of us remembers.<eos> i can't even really picture the two of us... you don't think that we... think that we what ?<eos> you know... that we... no, Lois.<eos> i think I'd remember.<eos> yeah.<eos> of course you would.
Were we just staying together 'cause we were having a kid?<eos> No. No, come on.<eos> Come back for me and see in a couple of month we're gonna pick right where we left off.<eos> I mean, I guess it'll be a little more casual.<eos> We probably shouldn't talk there was, we're wearing full body condoms.<eos> What if I wasn't coming back because they offered me a permanent position here?<eos> Do they?<eos> Yeah.<eos> We said the almighty talk might lead to everything, how we felt about each other, what that we wanted since this relationship, whether she would ever see herself come back to Sacred Heart, wait a pizza place to deliver to avenge at 3 in the morning.<eos> They would.
Think about Micah.<eos> You saw that painting.<eos> You came here to save him.<eos> All right.<eos> Twenty million dollars to kill your husband and walk away.<eos> He's right, D.L.<eos> I wanna take the money.<eos> I really do.<eos> I would even kill you for it.<eos> But Niki wouldn't.
You got assets somewhere? Insurance?<eos> Why?<eos> Things go wrong.<eos> Probability is like gravity.<eos> You cannot negotiate with gravity.<eos> One day... One day you should just cash out, you know.<eos> - Yeah.<eos> As far and as fast as you can.<eos> Would you find me?<eos> Yes, I would.
This fatso?<eos> Not a chance.<eos> Dad, they are looking for a different type of bishop.<eos> It's not official yet, only a small family secret.<eos> Wonderful!<eos> We'll get our home back.<eos> Antti, please sing us a song.<eos> Thank you but no.<eos> Sing the one you sang when we met.<eos> - I'd rather not.
Okay Mommy.<eos> Well-well-well. Yeah.<eos> Isn't this rich?<eos> Don't get to liking it too much, Raymond.<eos> You never know when things will change. Yeah?<eos> Well maybe I'm ready for a change.<eos> You Bette Crocker and the brat?<eos> I can see it all. You out there building a picket fence, waving to the folks in the neighborhood, sticking the fucking... star on top of the Christmas tree.<eos> That'll be something, all right.<eos> Maybe it would.
Bad timing?<eos> I am convinced he's hiding something.<eos> Nonsense, Malcolm.<eos> He may be a little lost and confused, but deep down he's an all-American, red-blooded male.<eos> - Just like yourself. - Mom, I will pick out my own dress.<eos> And no, I will not wear heels.<eos> Because heels are a male invention designed to make a woman's butt look smaller.<eos> And to make it harder for them to run away.<eos> Malcolm, have you ever tried to run away in high heels?<eos> - No, sir, I wouldn't...
Just a drop of blood.<eos> A pinprick, that's all.<eos> It's the final task.<eos> Hurry.<eos> You promised to obey me!<eos> - Give me the boy!<eos> - No!<eos> My brother stays with me.<eos> You would give up your sacred rights for this brat you barely know?<eos> Yes, I would.
Okay, why don't you press it?<eos> Um, Miss Duke?<eos> I wondered if I could have next Thursday evening off?<eos> Why?<eos> Just personal reasons.<eos> You know that Maltese cross that I brought back from Paris?<eos> Yeah, it's in the safe.<eos> How do think that would go?<eos> With this?<eos> It would, yeah, absolutely would.
This battle has to be fast and clear<eos> We'll end this up with Ge Li<eos> New boots?<eos> No problem, Mr. Ge Li it will be ready when you come back<eos> I disagreed on the massacre last night, but...<eos> You can't stop them...<eos> I always think that killing enemies is a kind of glory... where will you go after the battle ends?<eos> Wherever needs me, I'll be there<eos> What if Zhao is being invaded and ask for your help will you go?<eos> Of course I would
he twists everything around, one lie on top of another, until you don't know what to believe.<eos> lex is a snake. believe me, i've seen his scales.<eos> but he did almost die taking a bullet for lana.<eos> i saved her from a bomb.<eos> doesn't that mean anything ?<eos> yeah. you know what ?<eos> it would if she knew about it.<eos> clark, the only reason lana started talking to lex was to learn more about that spaceship.<eos> if i would have been honest, she never would have had to.<eos> no, she wouldn't.
You're quite correct.<eos> Then for all intents and purposes, I am already dead.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> So am I.<eos> Yeah, yeah, yeah. We're all very sorry.<eos> Where's Elizabeth?<eos> She is here also.<eos> And I suppose you'd like us to take your word for that?<eos> Would you like to speak with her?<eos> Yes, we would.
Previously in Smallville...<eos> - a spaceship.<eos> - where ?<eos> you're a public figure now, senator.<eos> it's possible that any association with me... could be dangerous.<eos> i know i should be able to move on, but life without him doesn't feel real.<eos> - why would you lie to someone you love ?<eos> - i wouldn't.
it's a diamond key to my heart.<eos> It's... it's a key, but, you see, it's shaped like a heart.<eos> You can't tell me that it looks like anything else, 'cause that's what it is.<eos> That's it.<eos> That's what I like.<eos> And I'm not gonna take it back.<eos> It's perfect, Angel.<eos> She'll love it.<eos> Really?<eos> I would.
Just don't cut me anymore.<eos> Please don't cut me anymore.<eos> Gift-wrapped and begging for death.<eos> Tools at the ready.<eos> Just kill me.<eos> It's okay.<eos> He was left here so I would kill him, but my new friend doesn't see me as clearly as he thinks.<eos> I can't kill this man.<eos> Harry wouldn't want it.<eos> And neither would I.
Bigger than a twitch?<eos> Smaller than a spasm?<eos> Do you smoke?<eos> Socially, not a lot.<eos> You do yoga, and you smoke?<eos> I know it's hypocritical,but...<eos> No, the world sees your legs.<eos> No one's checking out your lungs.<eos> How would smoking cause...<eos> It wouldn't.
No, no. Keep it coming.<eos> You are going to let me play him, Aren't you?<eos> Don't feel pressured Just because you're in his house Eating his food.<eos> You know, I have a lot of other responsibilities. I've got a board.<eos> I have an entire company of actors. Well, that's bullshit.<eos> That's bullshit.<eos> You just don't want My blood on your hands.<eos> All right, let me ask you this question.<eos> Is this really how you want to die?<eos> Wouldn't you?
- And the princess is here.<eos> Welcome.<eos> - How are you?<eos> - I'm fine.<eos> - Did you see the doctor today?<eos> - Yes I did, we talked.<eos> I am very relieved right now.<eos> - Good.<eos> We'd have a coffee, right?<eos> - Sure we would.
- I need to buy him something...<eos> - Big.<eos> A house... in the Bahamas.<eos> I'd buy the Bahamas, or at least a Bahama.<eos> An island.<eos> You know, for $8 million, I'd buy an island.<eos> Oh, you're an intern.<eos> - When would you have time to go to your bahama?<eos> - I'd quit.<eos> Oh, no, you wouldn't.
Doesn't matter.<eos> And you'll know it's coming when she mentions my cousin Stacy-- six kids in five years.<eos> The woman's basically a ride at a water park.<eos> But I don't want to get married and have kids.<eos> What am I supposed to say?<eos> You know what?<eos> You're an adult with perfectly valid opinions.<eos> You shouldn't have to apologize for them.<eos> - I'm gonna lie.<eos> - I would.
Ask you out, on a date.<eos> I would ask you to go out.<eos> With who?<eos> Me.<eos> Me and you on a date.<eos> I like you.<eos> You do?<eos> Well, um, if you could ask me out and would, then I would say yes.<eos> But you probably already knew that, considering I already did say yes.<eos> So we both would...
There's no waiting with Dewy and Sons, sir.<eos> And that's a promise.<eos> You came all this way on a Sunday just to try for a bit of custom?<eos> I did, sir.<eos> I like a man with a bit of ambition about him.<eos> Oh, you look beautiful.<eos> Not too indecorous for church?<eos> You do this old place the power of good, miss.<eos> Not everyone would agree with you.<eos> Mr Shinar would.
- Don't call it 'beast'.<eos> What if it's a she?<eos> - No matter...<eos> It is welcomed, then.<eos> We are going to hospital tomorrow afternoon.<eos> Yes, it is welcomed, but not tonight.<eos> I'd not let you hold it while you are drunk.<eos> No way.<eos> I am sure that you would drop it right onto the head.<eos> I would not.
It's not getting any better.<eos> If you were right, the pain would be subsiding.<eos> You'd be getting better.<eos> It's just taking longer.<eos> No, it's not.<eos> We've gotta let 'em cut the leg off.<eos> It's my leg.<eos> It's my life.<eos> Would you give up your leg to save my life?<eos> Ofcourse I would.
It is absolutely my business!<eos> What if that kid talks, huh?<eos> Did you ever think of that?<eos> Huh? What if he goes to The Star and he says that Rod Sebring is an ass bandit?<eos> No.<eos> No.<eos> Ben wouldn't do that.<eos> Ben wouldn't do that.<eos> No.<eos> He wouldn't.
You would do.<eos> She runs a restaurant in Southall.<eos> No, no, no, I hate curry.<eos> No.<eos> - I know her, 'cause she came into my office.<eos> - When?<eos> - Eight years ago.<eos> - You can remember a face after eight years?<eos> Look at it.<eos> You would, wouldn't you? Eh?
- He would do anything for you.<eos> - Look, I said-<eos> I said I'm sorry.<eos> And so what?<eos> You know, you don't even deserve him as a brother.<eos> You don't want to accept my apology, that's fine.<eos> But I want you to promise me you will not say anything to him.<eos> Get out.<eos> Get out before I call the police.<eos> You wouldn't.
Oh...<eos> But...<eos> I can have some more.<eos> Excuse me.<eos> Sit down with me.<eos> - That's all right.<eos> - Really, sit.<eos> I can't finish all this on my own.<eos> The calendar is correct... if you would like to have me tonight.<eos> I would.
This is the weapon I seek.<eos> With the god's help, I can destroy him.<eos> Please don't talk this way.<eos> Would you rather I lied to you?<eos> I would rather that you think of something other than the destruction of my uncle.<eos> I have never lied to you.<eos> He still has some terrible hold over me. I wish it were not so, but he will not let go.<eos> Will you ask your brother?<eos> Would that make you happy?<eos> Yes, it would.
No, and we haven't been able to establish radio contact with them either.<eos> They didn't return to the city.<eos> Perhaps they travelled through the ring to another planet?<eos> No, they would have radioed first.<eos> Something must have happened on the island.<eos> I'll alert our security teams.<eos> Have them begin a search.<eos> We'll join them.<eos> - I would advise against that.<eos> - Would you?
Don't fuck around.<eos> Give me the weed.<eos> Jesus.<eos> Is this what you wanna be a couple of fucking teenage burnouts?<eos> "Oh, I'm 16. I have zits. Life's so tough!"<eos> "Oh, I'm deaf. I can't hear.<eos> Life's so unfair!"<eos> - What will you do with it?<eos> - Give it to your mother.<eos> - You wouldn't.
It seemed easy because I was well prepared.<eos> Wow!<eos> Aren't you great!<eos> You're mates with that other bastard.<eos> - Mr Clément?<eos> We were discussing another case.<eos> You do a deal with him and what does he get in return?<eos> Do you suck his dick?<eos> I'd give her one.<eos> - Of course you would.
You're not trapped, Eve.<eos> You know the second you step out that door... the second you don't have these symbols keeping you invisible to the partners... they're gonna zero in.<eos> So don't bother playing the pity angle.<eos> The only thing you care about is saving your own ass.<eos> The only thing I care about is gone.<eos> You gave him up to the senior partners.<eos> Let them suck him into the...<eos> Could do the same to you.<eos> Tell 'em how to see through your security system.<eos> - You wouldn't.
No, i believe not.<eos> I believe no.<eos> He too is god's handiwork.<eos> Oh, double fucking solitaire.<eos> Where's your fucking ballgowns?<eos> Bring a bunch a chips over here and let's get a poker game going!<eos> I don't know this camp.<eos> I'd have to bring someone from montana.<eos> Would the widow give it that much time?<eos> Yeah, she would.
I will take care of it.<eos> Relax, have fun tonight, will you?<eos> - What does he need?<eos> - What do you need?<eos> I'm on ass patrol.<eos> I got a six-pack, one of them kind of looks like Kristen.<eos> - What are you, an asshole?<eos> - I'm just saying, revenge fuck.<eos> I'm gonna revenge fuck someone 'cause she looks like my ex?<eos> I would.
- Then she deserves to die.<eos> - Ohh, they won't like that!<eos> - No, she doesn't deserve to die.<eos> - Come on, you're losing points!<eos> - I'm...<eos> I'm going in.<eos> I'm still getting the kid.<eos> - The mother?<eos> - The psychopath could change his mind.<eos> - Why would he?
For God's sake!<eos> - Touch my bottom.<eos> Touch! Touch!<eos> (hysterical giggling)<eos> - (Boyce clears throat) - Light the candle?<eos> - No, thank you.<eos> - Yes, please.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Who would like to taste the wine?<eos> - I would.
Well, actually, I don't draw up the rosters.<eos> Sorry, are you on my side or not?<eos> Dr Macartney, yes, I am on your side.<eos> I'm always on your side.<eos> You know, I'm by your side, I'm up your side, I'm through your side, I'm under your side...<eos> - It's time for me to go now.<eos> Thank you. - I'm all over your side...<eos> I can do headstands.<eos> Now, would you like to see that?<eos> Would you?
-I could love you forever.<eos> -So could I.<eos> You're my family now, Haley.<eos> The only true thing I have.<eos> I never want to lose you.<eos> You won't.<eos> What?<eos> Marry me.<eos> -Stop it. -What?<eos> Would you?
But I'm still in town,<eos> I don't even know if you're calling this number but I had to call.<eos> I figured at this point, I've got nothing to lose except you.<eos> I can't lose you again, Carrie.<eos> I love you.<eos> Hi, it's Charlotte.<eos> And her computer was just sitting there on her bed.<eos> Well, I know I haven't been your favorite over the few years.<eos> - I wouldn't say that.<eos> - I would.
I'm sorry you asked me that question, Miss Sullivan.<eos> That's very dangerous information for you to have.<eos> Why did you ask me that?<eos> That's not important.<eos> Of course I did. For their life insurance.<eos> I have your entire confession recorded on my voice mail... and the only person that has the password is me.<eos> So if I were you, I would reconsider my father's employment situation.<eos> I'm impressed, but unfortunately, I don't respond to blackmail.<eos> But, you know, this isn't what's gonna get your father's job back.<eos> - Then what would?
- Is this a good time?<eos> It's always a good time for you, sir.<eos> Come on in.<eos> Let me get you a chair.<eos> General.<eos> At ease, Major, please.<eos> There you go, sir.<eos> I'm glad to find you all here.<eos> You wouldn't happen to have another one of those?<eos> I would.
Meaning that there may be some disassembly required.<eos> You want to take the DHD apart?<eos> I'll put it back together again.<eos> Do you not run the risk of disabling the other Stargate?<eos> Only if I screw up, which is extremely unlikely.<eos> 840 years.<eos> What?<eos> That's how long it will take us to come get you by puddle jumper.<eos> But you would do that, right?<eos> Of course we would.
Everyone else respected the quarantine.<eos> There were only a few people.<eos> - You made your point.<eos> - Make your way back to the city.<eos> Wait in Beckett's lab for further instructions.<eos> - Dr. Beckett.<eos> - Any progress, Dr. Biro?<eos> Just finished Dumais' autopsy.<eos> Would it surprise you to learn it was an aneurysm?<eos> - No, it wouldn't.
Mememe!<eos> I'm first!<eos> I'm first!<eos> Ooooh, let's go ride the choo-choo train!<eos> Choo-choo train!<eos> Yay!<eos> Let's ride the train!<eos> The train!<eos> Would you like to ride the train with me, and start a magical journey?<eos> Yes I would, Mr. Jefferson.
Well, either you've lost control of your prison, Mr. Houseman, or you're running a corrupt administration.<eos> - Officers-- - That isn't true.<eos> Leo Symons was so badly beaten three months ago he had to have his kidney removed.<eos> Are you suggesting he kicked himself?<eos> My officers did not assault Symons. Then who did?<eos> I don't know.<eos> Pace Tierney threw white spirits over me and nearly set fire to me in your prison, Mr. Houseman.<eos> I wanna know how that happened.<eos> I wanna know what you're covering up. Nothing.<eos> Why would I?
You'll split in half.<eos> Chain them, and give him medicine.<eos> - Let him die.<eos> Take his handcuffs off.<eos> Mind your fucking head.<eos> For him.<eos> How can anybody sleep like that?<eos> Got clobbered in the head, probably has a concussion.<eos> Well, should we wake him first?<eos> Shit, I wouldn't.
And now you've destroyed yours.<eos> And you pulled me into all this.<eos> Well, we can't have that.<eos> Come in!<eos> I'm in here.<eos> FBI, right?<eos> You gonna untie me?<eos> And you have no idea where he's going?<eos> - Well, wouldn't I have told you if I did?<eos> - Would you?
- What other girl?<eos> - The one that left all that crap on your porch.<eos> - You mean Deb?<eos> - Yes, her.<eos> - What about her?<eos> - Well, I asked her out too.<eos> - What?<eos> Well, nobody's gonna go out with me.<eos> - Have you asked anybody yet?<eos> - No, but who would?
So, strategically...<eos> Why are we doing it, then?<eos> Just to make them happy? Yes.<eos> That's exactly what they're doing.<eos> And, they won't say, "Fuck you, you never do anything for us."<eos> "We're gonna fuck you on the next record."<eos> People would do that?<eos> "Because you didn't give us something, we're going to fuck you"?<eos> Yes, James.<eos> They would.
If you were to travel East very very quickly -<eos> - Out of sight, to the Far East?<eos> - The Far far East.<eos> Oh completely out of sight.<eos> Yes, completely out of sight.<eos> And I stayed here your time would slow down relative to mine.<eos> - Like I'd get really really slow...<eos> - If you went very very fast.<eos> If I went very very fast, I'd get really really slow.<eos> Your time would, relative to mine.
Am I wrong?<eos> Wait a minute, did he not own slaves?<eos> That's all I'm saying.<eos> I almost protested the war in the beginning.<eos> Almost.<eos> Till I saw what happened to them Dixie Chicks.<eos> I said, "Fuck that."<eos> If they'll do that to three white women, they will tear my black ass to pieces.<eos> I don't wanna hear that shit.<eos> Yeah, man, they would.
In bed...<eos> I don't remember anymore.<eos> I don't remember, Eliyahu. I just don't.<eos> He's incapable of pity, that man.<eos> Dona, he's incapable of pity.<eos> Would you rather have a husband like Victor, who blows his entire paycheck on a single game of cards?<eos> What a shame I don't drink or hit you.<eos> Maybe then she could appreciate what she has.<eos> You tell her that, Dona.<eos> I'd rather...
Just gonna let him take her?<eos> She's one of theirs.<eos> They can handle it.<eos> Besides, you heard the man.<eos> We got enough problems of our own to worry about.<eos> Come to tap-dance on the patient, have we, Doc?<eos> I'd give you the finger, but apparently... I won't have the motor skills till the drugs wear off.<eos> A lot of pain?<eos> More than I'd like.<eos> But not as much as you would.
-There's a price on your head.<eos> I'm going to collect.<eos> Why don't you just tell Barillo everything you know.<eos> And then maybe he'll just cut off your hands.<eos> And if I don't?<eos> You know that old man I killed in your village?<eos> What if your whole village was next?<eos> Would you kill them?<eos> Me?<eos> They certainly would.
But, angel, how?<eos> I'll tell you about it when we meet.<eos> What would you all do if you had a thousand pounds?<eos> Me, I would buy me one gold pen. With eagles on him.<eos> I'd put it on a horse.<eos> What horse?<eos> I'd tell you unlikely outside of a November Handicap.<eos> Indian Runner has a 20:1 in odds of lengthen.<eos> If you put a thousand pounds on it to win and it did, you'd be rich, wouldn't you?<eos> Yes, so I would.
What about references to an orb?<eos> I took the liberty of checking.<eos> Historical inventories of the Luna Temple do not list any orb.<eos> Then I want you both to list every orb ever mentioned in Greek history.<eos> Every one?<eos> That's... liable... to be thousands.<eos> Then we'll read thousands.<eos> Start with that one.<eos> Perhaps you gentlemen would like some tea while you wait?<eos> No, they wouldn't.
Because her parents are gonna be gone all day. It's the only time she can go.<eos> Well, she's just gonna have to wait.<eos> You're not taking any money from here tonight... and that's that.<eos> I don't believe this.<eos> Please, Buzzy, just give me the money?<eos> You gonna shoot me, huh?<eos> Buzzy.<eos> Would you shoot Cheri if I needed money?<eos> Oh, come on. Why do you always have to do this?<eos> Well, would you?
Lloyd will know I'm lying in a second.<eos> But if you shoot me... I'm hurt, he can't ask any questions.<eos> Are you out of your mind?<eos> No, I'm serious, Duffy.<eos> I need this job.<eos> I can't!<eos> Duffy?<eos> No. No.<eos> I'll tell Cheri about that time last summer.<eos> You wouldn't.
She's of no interest to me.<eos> - Unlike your Egyptian whore?<eos> - Oh, Cleopatra!<eos> You will never see Octavius' men until they face you across the battlefield.<eos> If you help me, we'll have enough men to conquer Parthia.<eos> That will remind Rome who rules the Empire.<eos> If our most powerful ally fights beside me.<eos> I will not fight as your ally, only as your wife.<eos> You know I can't marry you.<eos> I would. I would!
You're arresting me?<eos> Don't make me laugh.<eos> Laugh...<eos> Laugh.<eos> That always helps.<eos> Especially at a time like this.<eos> Wait... You're not going to...?<eos> Alas.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> We'd rather not.
Don't make me laugh.<eos> Laugh...<eos> Laugh.<eos> That always helps.<eos> Especially at a time like this.<eos> Wait... You're not going to...?<eos> Alas.<eos> You know who I am?<eos> We'd rather not.<eos> We'd rather not.
Have a chat, and if you need me, I'll be in the sales office round the corner.<eos> Thank you.<eos> - Thank you.<eos> Well, hoo hoo!<eos> What do you think?<eos> I think it's incredible.<eos> - I know!<eos> To think that we can afford it.<eos> To think that people want to live here.<eos> Lots of people would.
When I catch you, who knows what other parts I'll require you to shave.<eos> Pacey.<eos> I think I ran into an auto display case or something.<eos> Oh, help me.<eos> I think I'm bleeding.<eos> Aisle 3B.<eos> Bring Band-Aids.<eos> I wouldn't make any sudden movements if I were you.<eos> -You wouldn't dare.<eos> -l would.
Why?<eos> Why?<eos> Why didn't you just say no?<eos> Well, I said no to her coming over now.<eos> I couldn't say no twice.<eos> I got this uncontrollable need to please people.<eos> Fine.<eos> Fine.<eos> You would not hold up well under torture.<eos> - Oh, and you would?
What a loser.<eos> Some more wine?<eos> Hey, Ross.<eos> How's it going with Charlie?<eos> After I finish my wine I'm gonna blow my average-sized brains out.<eos> What's the matter?<eos> She only dates geniuses and Nobel Prize winners.<eos> Oh, my God, at the Chinese restaurant earlier today I put chopsticks in my mouth and pretended to be a woolly mammoth.<eos> I always loved that.<eos> Of course you would!
This is my first officer, Tanis Reynard, and Navigator Lyle Pender.<eos> Colonel Jack O'Neill, US Air Force. Teal'c, Major Carter, Jonas Quinn.<eos> - We're from a planet called Earth. - Never heard of it.<eos> - It's...<eos> - Nice.<eos> It's nice.<eos> I'm sure it is.<eos> Sorry for the less- than- warm welcome, but you kind of snuck up on us.<eos> - We didn't hear your ship land.<eos> - No. You wouldn't.
- There was one bouncing against my office window yesterday.<eos> A real one.<eos> She had bought over the Internet... a mobile to put on the baby's crib... of dragonflies.<eos> And then this thing last night with the paperweight.<eos> You know what I think?<eos> I think you are literally going buggy living in that house.<eos> Yeah, you should move.<eos> You're rummaging around in an empty nursery.<eos> You're living with a talking parrot who won't even speak to you.<eos> Never would.
Bye, Joe. You want me to package up dessert for you?<eos> Sorry.<eos> Use your phone?<eos> Excuse me.<eos> I am kind of busy at the moment, yeah.<eos> Well, isn't there anyone else who can cover for me tonight?<eos> All right. I understand. I'll be right over.<eos> I'm sorry.<eos> I'd really like to stay.<eos> No, you wouldn't.
- Uh, yeah. Right, right.<eos> The guy that Lucio Malatesta murdered, and.... - Frankie!<eos> - ....tried to blame Angelo.<eos> I think he's coming over here.<eos> What should I say?<eos> How do I look?<eos> I mean, if you were walking over here.. ..looking at me, what would you think?<eos> - You wouldn't want to know.<eos> - l do.<eos> - Wouldn't. - l would.
You wanted to help me even before I taped you.<eos> You had to have a wild card.<eos> You're a good man. I know that even if you've forgotten it.<eos> When were you going to point them at me?<eos> When you found out where Kay's dress was?<eos> Where I took the body, right?<eos> You have a gun and forensics, wouldn't matter what I told them about you killing your partner.<eos> Let me have the tape.<eos> - Did you make other copies?<eos> - What? - Why would I?
I saw him on the roof with a girl.<eos> Hutch knows the rules.<eos> No non-members allowed in the Tomb.<eos> I know.<eos> Greg, I saw a girl up there and I think she might have fallen into the courtyard.<eos> - What are you saying, Ryan?<eos> - I'm not sure.<eos> I just saw Hutch a minute ago.<eos> I think he would have said something if he saw a girl fall off the roof.<eos> - Would he?
We've got to go, honey.<eos> Just get up there.<eos> One foot after the other.<eos> - Where are the others?<eos> - I think we're on our own.<eos> You're doing good.<eos> I see a pattern.<eos> Anyone connected to this... this hypercube... eventually dies a very violent, and painful death.<eos> I would hate for that to happen to you, Mrs. Paley.<eos> I would.
How long were you there?<eos> A colleague suspected... and... cruise Next to me was... and here I am.<eos> My God!<eos> I wanted to kill you for real?<eos> I wanted out of life because he has another lover.<eos> Is with him now?<eos> I do not know.<eos> What is happening here?<eos> Just know that when tried to kill me... had intentions of continue the romance.<eos> With whom would the novel?
- Yeah.<eos> They let us come, and they let us go.<eos> What kind of ident card gets us that kind of reception and send off?<eos> I am a Shepherd.<eos> - Folks like a man of God.<eos> - No, they don't.<eos> Men of God make everyone feel guilty and judged.<eos> Thas not what I saw.<eos> You like to tell me what really happened?<eos> I surely would.
- Like when? - Well, the last time we went to the beach!<eos> A lot of people bring rakes!<eos> Look, Frasier, it's not too late to back out of this.<eos> Face it, - jokes just aren't your specialty.<eos> - What is that supposed to mean?<eos> Well, what she means, son, is that we all have our different blessings.<eos> And Bulldog's good at jokes and fun, and you're good at reading, and, uh... telling people about the things you read.<eos> - Are you saying that you think I can't pull this off?<eos> - Oh, I wouldn't put it that way.<eos> - I would.
With apologies from the state and Metropolis Police departments.<eos> Then it's finally over.<eos> Well, this time.<eos> Unfortunately, there's more than one Phelan out there in the world.<eos> What do we do next time?<eos> I don't know, son.<eos> We'll have to deal with it when the time comes.<eos> Maybe I should stop using my gifts.<eos> That would solve our problems.<eos> No, it wouldn't, Clark.
Car accident.<eos> He was an only child, inherited everything.<eos> And Amanda Rothman?<eos> Have you tracked her down yet?<eos> She moved, left no forwarding address.<eos> When's the last time you spoke to her?<eos> About three years ago.<eos> I'll go wider, but it could take some time.<eos> It'd help if you tell me what's going on.<eos> No, it wouldn't.
See, I may have kissed Todd... but you knew about it all along and didn't tell Michael.<eos> And that is way worse than what I did.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, girlfriends are supposed to lie.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> But best friends are supposed to be loyal, and you weren't.<eos> So guess what?<eos> You're screwed, 'cause I'm telling Michael everything!<eos> - You wouldn't.
And that is way worse than what I did.<eos> Wait, what?<eos> Yeah.<eos> See, girlfriends are supposed to lie.<eos> That's what we do.<eos> But best friends are supposed to be loyal, and you weren't.<eos> So guess what?<eos> You're screwed, 'cause I'm telling Michael everything!<eos> - You wouldn't.<eos> - Oh, I so would!
- Oh, I so would!<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Well...<eos> Well, this certainly blew up in my face!<eos> When I tell Michael what you did, he's gonna forget all about what I did.<eos> Unless I get to him first.<eos> You wouldn't.
- Yeah!<eos> - Oh, yeah?<eos> - Yeah!<eos> Well...<eos> Well, this certainly blew up in my face!<eos> When I tell Michael what you did, he's gonna forget all about what I did.<eos> Unless I get to him first.<eos> You wouldn't.<eos> Well, to quote a certain manager-kissing cheese maiden I know...<eos> "I so would!"
Dr. Sid created a membrane around the infection, keeping me alive.<eos> So the first spirit wave was me.<eos> -The second was a fish.<eos> -A fish?<eos> The third was a deer I found in a wildlife preserve outside Moscow.<eos> The fourth was a bird.<eos> Ever tried to track a sparrow from outer space?<eos> It's no fun.<eos> -You'd love that.<eos> -I would.
No.<eos> She left my dad real quick, when I was young.<eos> I had to cook for him.<eos> Until one day he got stabbed.<eos> I may be a shitty cook, but I'm a great waitress.<eos> I have a camera.<eos> How about a striptease?<eos> Right now, without getting up.<eos> If you do one later.<eos> You wouldn't.
More than myself.<eos> But I'm lost.<eos> Then let me help you.<eos> You don't deserve this.<eos> Why not?<eos> I'm your girlfriend, and I love you more than myself.<eos> Come on, it's obvious.<eos> You're draining my life away.<eos> I'm doing all I can to get back, and accept myself, but if I can't, don't wait for me.<eos> I wouldn't, either.
Uh, l-I was...<eos> I was wondering if it was possible... for us to have Cream of Wheat instead of oatmeal. [All Groaning]<eos> Not again. Howie.<eos> I have a suggestion, because there's really, really not much time.<eos> I would like to propose an essay contest... to decide once and for all who will go with Prot.<eos> I've spoken with him, and he's agreed to read them all by July 27.<eos> So if anyone would like to be considered, please state your reasons in a clear, legible hand... and return them to me.<eos> [Excited Chattering]<eos> Would I get to take my bible to K-PAX?<eos> Of course you would.
- I do not know, I have not decided.<eos> And I'll Scandinavian platter.<eos> I come back later.<eos> If you want a pizza, take the children's menu.<eos> Well of course ...<eos> Look at this.<eos> Helicopters.<eos> - Tasty?<eos> - Yes.<eos> - Would you?
- I swear.<eos> And if he operated 3 times, 3 times. They call the doctor "the gardener".<eos> - You know why?<eos> - No.<eos> Because he works with plants.<eos> Terminal cases.<eos> When we don't know what to do with someone... we send them to him to see what he invents.<eos> You don't understand him.<eos> What he'd like is to see all his patients alive.<eos> Who wouldn't?
- No.<eos> - No?<eos> - No.<eos> - Never?<eos> A single man working with her?<eos> Making love to her never crossed your mind?<eos> - That's your truthful testimony?<eos> - I certainly didn't dwell on it.<eos> - But you thought about it.<eos> - What normal man wouldn't?
I knew it was coming.<eos> I meant to do it.<eos> Recess! Recess!<eos> Lucky!<eos> Lucky!<eos> - Miss West?<eos> - Yeah, Benny?<eos> - When will we see Mr. Bo again?<eos> - Would you like to see him again?<eos> Yeah, we all would.
MICHAEL, HELP ME PUT THIS BACK ON.<eos> Jennifer: WHAT WERE YOU THINKING?<eos> I WASN'T.<eos> AH, THAT'S RIGHT, YOU NEVER DO. YOU JUST... ACT.<eos> I DID WHAT I HAD TO DO.<eos> WHAT YOU HAD TO DO?<eos> CRAIG, DO YOU KNOW HOW CLOSE WE ARE TO LOSING HIM? WHAT DO YOU DO?<eos> YOU PRACTICALLY PUSH HIM OUT THE DOOR.<eos> I TOLD HIM TO COME HOME, JEN. HE WOULDN'T.<eos> WHO WOULD, WITH A LUNATIC?
That's it.<eos> Good girl.<eos> You listen to me!<eos> I am the captain of this ship and I am not leaving anyone on this rock with those fucking things, even if it means...<eos> Get that thing off my neck.<eos> Shut up!<eos> You'd die for them?<eos> I would try for them.<eos> You didn't answer me.<eos> Yes, I would, Riddick.
Colonel, this is a uniformed dispatch rider carrying a marked case.<eos> He cannot be held as a spy. Well, we won't hold him.<eos> We're going to hang him.<eos> -Colonel-- -Father!<eos> Oh, I see.<eos> He's your son.<eos> Perhaps you should've taught him something of loyalty.<eos> Colonel, I beg you, please reconsider.<eos> By the rules of war-- Would you like a lesson, sir, in the rules of war?<eos> Or perhaps your children would.
I can't stop.<eos> I'm lying about everything!<eos> It started so I can impress girls.<eos> And now I can't stop.<eos> -You should see someone about that.<eos> -Yeah, I am.<eos> -No, you're not!<eos> -See? I can't stop! I can't!<eos> Tell you what. The next time I catch you lying... I'll expose you for the fraud that you are.<eos> -You wouldn't.
I just dropped my pen.<eos> I'm all thumbs today.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Will you cut that out?<eos> It's driving me crazy.<eos> Excuse me, but I nearly had my head ripped off and it hurts.<eos> It's only psychological.<eos> Your neck doesn't really hurt.<eos> You'd know better about that?<eos> Yes, he would.
You stay here.<eos> open up... open up...<eos> Mom they're watching us.<eos> What's wrong with a mother feeding her kid?<eos> they'll think we are...<eos> What do you say we have some fun?<eos> Are you crazy?<eos> we don't leave fun at home.<eos> You know I don't do that.<eos> I wouldn't...
Well, he's probably been in the club longer.<eos> No, actually, I sponsored his membership.<eos> Oh! Well, so you've never wanted that honor for yourself?<eos> I wouldn't say never.<eos> Who hasn't nursed the dream of one day becoming Corkmaster?<eos> Well, I'm sure Frasier at least asked if you were interested.<eos> Well, now that you mention it, no, he didn't.<eos> And you don't resent it?<eos> Well... you see, that's why I love you.<eos> Because most people would.
You're the first.<eos> First what?<eos> The first people to come here still living their original lives.<eos> This has been a most interesting time. A most unsettling time. A time of great - possibility.<eos> And now it's time for me to die.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Where's Stanley Tweedle?<eos> Here.<eos> Would you like to see him?<eos> Yes, I would.
That law might change soon.<eos> It's a terrible thing to beg for your life.<eos> Terrible.<eos> My father....<eos> "Proud. "<eos> Proud.<eos> My father was a proud man.<eos> He built homes.<eos> He wouldn't like what I came here to do.<eos> Yes, he would, Mr. President.
-Marino lives for revenge.<eos> I was gonna say because Marino's devoted to the issue.<eos> -We may have lost one of our guys.<eos> -Who?<eos> Toby's gonna ask Marino.<eos> Hey!<eos> Norma Rae, get in here.<eos> The man's trying to run a country.<eos> This law would prevent 32 to 95,000 injuries a year.<eos> -Not here it wouldn't.
- I've got the key, you don't. I'm the captain, period.<eos> You can transfer it at the point of death.<eos> Oh yeah, yeah, thank you very much, but I feel just fine right now.<eos> Would you let me have a turn as captain if you could give me the key?<eos> Yeah yeah yeah, I'm a fair person.<eos> So you would.<eos> Look, we can't do it, so it doesn't matter.<eos> Just answer, Stanley.<eos> If you could transfer the key, would you let me have a turn as captain?<eos> Yes I would.
I can't imagine there's any strain or stress around here.<eos> Yeah.<eos> - How she's doing?<eos> - Just fine.<eos> Good.<eos> Boy or a girl?<eos> - It's all over, dear.<eos> - Yeah, it's all over, honey.<eos> I would really like to have a baby one day.<eos> - I really would.
So we violated the Harvard Compact.<eos> Jim and i used gene therapies to increase their brain mass.<eos> Larger brain means more protein.<eos> As a side effect, the sharks got smarter.<eos> You stupid bitch!<eos> i didn't want this to happen but with this research, we could wipe out degenerative brain disease.<eos> Think of the generations that would be saved.<eos> How much dynamite do you have to set off in your ears before your head clears?<eos> You wouldn't understand.<eos> i wouldn't?
Well then, mash them!<eos> So, what's it going to be?<eos> I'm not paying 20 Filler a pound for mealy potatoes!<eos> Why don't you open up. I'll be there in a minute.<eos> You go ahead.<eos> I want to be here if you're going to be talking about me.<eos> We have to talk.<eos> Why not?<eos> It won't help.<eos> What would then?
Have you reached your verdict?<eos> - We have, Your Honor.<eos> - What say you?<eos> In the Commonwealth versus Albert Shepley we found the defendant not guilty.<eos> Thank you.<eos> Members of the jury, thank you.<eos> - Congratulations.<eos> - You are dismissed.<eos> Would it be pushing things to try to get her hand back?<eos> Yeah, it would.
OR SHOULD I CALL THEM "DRINKING BUDDIES?"<eos> MILLIE.<eos> WHY ARE YOU DOING THIS, LINDSAY?<eos> YOU'RE ASKING FOR TROUBLE.<eos> BEER HERE!<eos> UH, NO, THANK YOU.<eos> I PREFER TO GET HIGH ON LIFE.<eos> [SEAN SNICKERS] OH, WHOA, WHOA. YOU'RE THAT CHICK FROM THAT THING YESTERDAY.<eos> OH, HEY, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A RIDE HOME?<eos> YES, I WOULD.

YOU'RE THAT CHICK FROM THAT THING YESTERDAY.<eos> OH, HEY, WOULD YOU GIVE ME A RIDE HOME?<eos> YES, I WOULD.<eos> [SNICKERS] "YES, I WOULD."
Did she ever think of that?<eos> You were with Kenny today.<eos> Just for a second.<eos> Phoebe, what am I gonna do?<eos> The only thing you can do. Sleep with him.<eos> I'm not gonna sleep with him.<eos> I mean, I could, but I wouldn't.<eos> Sleep with Kenny.<eos> -That wouldn't help me.<eos> -Oh, yes, it would.
"Misty water-coIored memories<eos> "Of the way we were"<eos> Let me do my favorite part.<eos> -"Can it be"<eos> -Yes!<eos> "Can it be that it was all so simple then<eos> "Or has time re-written every line?<eos> "If we had the chance to do it all again<eos> "tell me<eos> "would we?
I don't know.<eos> - I have many connections.<eos> - I don't need your connections.<eos> As nagus, people will be lining up to do business with me.<eos> You missed a spot.<eos> I'm sure there must be something I can do to change your mind.<eos> Possibly.<eos> Would 40 bricks of gold-pressed latinum do the trick?<eos> - No.<eos> But 70 would.
They've become linked together into a sort of collective triad.<eos> Revive them.<eos> I'm Captain Janeway.<eos> We know who you are, and we know what you were trying to do.<eos> What we don't know is why.<eos> She has information we need.<eos> What kind of information?<eos> We want to become... individuals.<eos> You want to break the neural link between the three of you?<eos> Wouldn't you?
Before the Vorlix, you and I had not met yet.<eos> I am pleased for you.<eos> You must take the antidote now.<eos> I cannot.<eos> They will explain.<eos> What will be done with me?<eos> If you don't take the antidote, I see no reason why you can't go back to Vyus.<eos> - I intend to ask them.<eos> - They'll fear me.<eos> I would.
You're the glue, Debra.<eos> Everyone knows that.<eos> Anyway, he comes home...<eos> We don't want ice cream!<eos> Oh, please.<eos> - Come on, you--<eos> - I'm gonna run away.<eos> No, don't run away.<eos> Oh, Mommy would miss you so much.<eos> Yes, she would.
More cream.<eos> Bring 'em in!<eos> Bring 'em back.<eos> I hope this plan of yours works.<eos> I'm hoping that myself.<eos> - Did you give approval for this?<eos> - They just appropriated it.<eos> Twelve city dump trucks?<eos> Would you like to tell me what's going on?<eos> Actually, no, I wouldn't.
It's all my fault.<eos> What have I done?<eos> What have I become?<eos> Look at me. This isn't me.<eos> I don't do stuff like this.<eos> You made a mistake.<eos> It happens.<eos> Well, I totally screwed up with the only man who will ever care about me.<eos> If I told you you could make it all up, would you?<eos> Of course I would.
Can't a person, bloody shit, Just take a walk in the street?<eos> Vanya!<eos> Vanya Dyakov!<eos> - What?<eos> - Maybe your Kilovatov has died?<eos> No bloody way/ Don't count on it/<eos> Tanya, is your hubby still alive?<eos> Why? You want to marry me?<eos> - Would you agree?<eos> - Of course I would!
Are you sure it's not too far out of town?<eos> Well, I...<eos> I'm sure you know what you're doing.<eos> Could you put U-in on?<eos> Sure.<eos> Wait, Sis.<eos> What?<eos> Do you like him?<eos> Uh-huh.<eos> Of course, you would.
I know a guy, a security consultant in the Drazi capital.<eos> I worked with him when we were stationed on the mining colony on Europa.<eos> He had the good sense to get the hell out before I did.<eos> If anybody can find this guy, it's him.<eos> - That's assuming the pilot's still alive.<eos> - Good.<eos> If he is, I want him brought back here as fast as possible so we can get him to testify before the Council.<eos> Stephen, I want you to go along with Garibaldi.<eos> Watch his back and...<eos> I'd...

Erm...<eos> Grapes.<eos> Well, did you pass the night well enough?<eos> Not really.<eos> Something happened I thought you...<eos> You know what?<eos> Let's take a walk.<eos> - Now this part I could get used to.<eos> - Do you want me to go real fast?<eos> - Not that I would.
Hang him!<eos> Hang him! Hang him!<eos> Hang him!<eos> I did not kill Generys!<eos> You put your cross in her grave.<eos> Do you deny it is your cross?<eos> - It is my cross, yes.<eos> - Yes, but that doesn't prove he placed it there.<eos> Would a cut-throat lay a cross on his victim's breast?<eos> Would a tramp?
- What?<eos> Give me your gun, walk out and give me a minute to myself.<eos> I can't do that, Mikey.<eos> It's not murder, but it's close.<eos> We can get manslaughter.<eos> If you charge Kellerman, you take Lewis and Stivers with him.<eos> They both wrote it up clean, they'll fall for a false report charge.<eos> - As they should.<eos> - They covered for a cop.<eos> We would.
To failure.<eos> I'm not drinking to that.<eos> Jake, in ten minutes my business partner's ship will dock.<eos> In 15 minutes, Odo will arrest him.<eos> In 20 minutes, my name will come up.<eos> And in 25 minutes, Odo will walk in here with a warrant.<eos> I think you should humor me on this one.<eos> Quark...<eos> I'd like that holosuite now after all.<eos> You would.
- And how many do you say attacked you?<eos> - Three or four.<eos> Three or four.<eos> A moment ago you said it was two or three.<eos> - There was two, weren't there, Warrin?<eos> - I think. Maybe more.<eos> - When I came to, they'd gone.<eos> - I found him gagged and bound, see.<eos> - Otherwise, he'd have cried for help.<eos> - I would, aye. Course I would.
- Come on, Gaz, I'm freezing.<eos> "Women only"?<eos> Cheeky buggers!<eos> It's a bloody working-men's club!<eos> I mean, look at the state of that!<eos> What have you got to smile about?<eos> He's got no willy, for starters.<eos> Nowt in a gym'll help you there, mate!<eos> No decent woman would be seen dead in there.<eos> Jean would.
Hello, Guy.<eos> Nathe...<eos> Nathan!<eos> - I say, Jean! - Yeah?<eos> Ever been out with a black bloke?<eos> - You know I haven't, Dave.<eos> - But... if you were ont' lookout for a new fella, right?<eos> If you were, just saying, would you think about it?<eos> What's got into you?<eos> No, would you, though?
- Oh, come on! Why is it always this?<eos> I fuckin' owe it to myself to do this or that.<eos> - What if I don't want to? - No, no. Fuck you.<eos> You don't owe it to yourself.<eos> You owe it to me... 'cause tomorrow I'm gonna wale up and I'll be 50... and I'll still be doin' this shit.<eos> That's all right.<eos> That's fine. I mean, you're sittin' on a winning' lottery ticket.<eos> You're too much of a pussy to cash it in, and that's bullshit.<eos> 'Cause I'd do fuckin' anything to have what you got.<eos> So would any of these fuckin' guys.
Mrs. Sharpe.<eos> As was.<eos> Jane?<eos> Ma'am?<eos> Where is this?<eos> PARFITT:<eos> Well done, John.<eos> Pretty stuff, Parfitt!<eos> I'll wager he'd not try it against a soldier.<eos> Wouldn't he, Percy?
Please don't...<eos> I'll take this.<eos> Salving your conscience, are you?<eos> Maybe<eos> Maybe yours, too<eos> Why didn't you tell me?<eos> Tell you?<eos> You were so high and mighty, riding with your gentlemen, you'd have shot me as soon as talked to me.<eos> Yeah.<eos> Maybe I would.
With my mouth.<eos> - Excuse me.<eos> - What?<eos> - Put it back on the tray.<eos> - Will you excuse us?<eos> - I hadn't quite finished.<eos> What are you doing?<eos> If I don't drink that in the next 10 seconds...<eos> - You know how most men make love? - I'm married.<eos> I wouldn't.
What's this all about?<eos> Do you know how the ancient Greeks defined happiness?<eos> Not offhand, but I'd be willing to bet it involved three goats and a jug of wine.<eos> Happiness, they said, was the exercise of vital powers along lines of excellence in a life affording them scope.<eos> Humans have always struggled to find the outer edge of what's possible.<eos> And that's our strength.<eos> But what kind of world would we have, what options for happiness would we have in a society run by telepaths where ordinary humans are considered second-class citizens and privacy is something you don't even risk dreaming about?<eos> Would you like to live in that kind of world, Mr. Garibaldi?<eos> No.<eos> No, I wouldn't.
